requests and a few announcements I want to announce I'm sorry about the carrion it'll be June 28th so I said the 21st but it's Father's Day I didn't check the calendar so I'm sorry about that so usually for Father's Day Mother's Day everybody knows like I'll I'll just do one service then you can spend the rest of day with your family by God's grace so hope that's okay by God's grace Oh carry on June 28th not next week and next week is Father's Day so look forward to that I always think about our Heavenly Father on that day that's a great day to say thank you Lord for being my father praise God also we'd like to get July testimonies I think I'll do a sign-up sheet okay so I like everybody to give their testimony in July and we'll probably like one in the a.m. I'll preach like a short sermon because I can do it I can preach your short sermon I proved it to you last Wednesday kind of my wife said kinda yeah but I do want to make I want to do I want to do it in July I want to do like I'll preach a short sermon on Sunday morning and then we'll have like somebody give their testimony for 30 minutes or something like that because I want the young I want the kids to hear about the reality of Jesus Christ I want the next generation to know about the power of Christ so I'll probably do a sign-up sheet Lord when I might write that down so I get that because I want everybody everybody to testify and I also want to get my cousin add him out here to testify about what God has done for him because we seen him a few weeks ago and he's doing great by God's grace so I want him to testify also one more I just want to apologize again to Johnny and Sarah publicly last Sunday I said that they had already decided to come here why kind of jumped the gun I apologized to Johnny on the phone I want to apologize to you Sarah and I apologize to brother Jim because he was actually listening when I announced it and that was my fault I should not have done that I just was you know I was in my mind I was placing things together and I thought you know that but we are happy while while they're praying and deciding we're so happy and we're so blessed by the sacrifice you make think about that ones last time everybody here drove two hours for a Sunday morning service and then two hours home so let's support them and pray for them as they're deciding and praying about that it's a it's a fantastic sacrifice you know we think of Wendy she's done it for what 10 years or I get my numbers wrong eight or nine years she's driven three and a half hours one way to come to our church so it's a great sacrifice and so we appreciate the plans and the Lord will guide them we know the Lord will guide them all who have the Holy Ghost he said I'll guide you into all truth so we always want to support God's people and I just want to offer that public apology by God's grace I make mistakes to who who's I telling us tell Malachi and Lydia or no cell in Haven this morning daddy makes mistakes all the time I don't want to though I hate making them but brother Graham said I make thousands of mistakes every year and if you divide that up that's five or six mistakes every day that's it's just if you do 2,000 because thousands more than 1,000 so I don't ever want to do anything wrong I'm ashamed and Haven I'm ashamed when I do make mistakes I'm ashamed of myself I don't I don't I don't like doing that so amen thank the Lord for that so we appreciate the Bland's and we appreciate all the saints in Albion hallelujah always have always will praise God so here's a prayer requests here let's do a men's dad I'm sorry Amon has an unspoken request for his dad very good godly request so let's remember his dad in prayer praise God while we're at it let's remember my dad in prayer - but yeah especially you buddy and we appreciate your requests there also let's pray for brother Jose he's got that dental surgery on Thursday let's pray God would give him grace we're just thankful you had enough strength to make it here this morning brother with all that pain you have praise the Lord and yet a little testimony there christopher was reading and writing this week right so the so

cares about every one of our requests and our God is so great and merciful praise God also let's pray for everybody around the country especially those in Atlanta there was a shooting again yesterday and it's just awful you know the only thing that's gonna change is when hearts are healed by the love of Jesus Christ I was showing this the musicians in there that Magazine of brother branham from Life magazine from 63 that magazine is filled with articles about race relations and dog I can show you afterwards dogs were biting the clothes of the black people and there's a picture of a white officer dragging a black woman upside down she's got a skirt on dragging her upside down into the the wagon the the police wagon I mean this nothing's gonna change until people's hearts change but we can pray for mercy we can pray for Souls saved we can pray for justice amen a justice will be done to any cop or anybody any civilian who breaks the law but so it's so heart-wrenching it's so awful

understand that God creates all skin colors and they're all beautiful in his sight and God loves that he died for all of them all the iniquity of all man was placed upon him once and for all and he paid that price that all might be forgiven praise God oh my it's just so heart-wrenching anybody have any prayer requests they'd like to share publicly anybody have anything on their hearts okay no

people so bless us now nigh divine presence in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god bless you being seated praise God so brother bang before I forget buddy I got brother Jose I brought another Life magazine for you if you want one okay it's the 1963 version with the cloud picture okay you don't have to have it but if you want it we got extra for you so praise the Lord all right now you know this last night this morning I was caught I was trying to study on the Philippian series but then I felt like the Holy Spirit just guided me back to this thought on the Holy Ghost we had a wonderful service two Saturdays ago I think that was the highlight service of the meetings just such a tremendous atmosphere of surrender and worship and prayer and so I wanted to continue looking at the thought on the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I want to continue there by God's grace in a little bit I'll switch over Keysha but not right now I want to switch over a look at a few quotations and some scriptures I believe there'll be a help to us so let me take off my jacket here real quick we'll start in acts 2 verse 33 is where I get this principle from and the reason I call the principle is because there's so many quotes where brother Branham says the new birth is just like a natural birth yeah he said just like a baby being born the natural he said they come out screaming and crying Vauban so they come out speaking in tongues right they don't know any language now that's just a joke but they come out trying to talk right they come out screaming and with needs crying out so we know the same thing happens in the spiritual because here Peter says something you both see and hear now there's a little bit of confusion with one quote in particular and I think I'll pull it up here it's okay so you can switch over it's without sensation Holy Ghost without sensation I think a lot of people misunderstand that so let me pull it up here I just I'm kind of going off I got a special sensation right then I'll get it so a lot of people take this quote and they say see brother Jess you don't need a an experience programs now this is where he's listing the 12 mysteries I'm writing that book on by God's grace and I just got another chapter done this week so I'm 85% done so I'm excited I hope to get out by the end of the year Lord willing cuz I I believe it's got its brother Rams message all in one book that's what I believe it is it's gonna put it all in one place because this is where he talks about it yeah he said the mystery of the Baptism Holy Ghost without sensation but see people stop right there they failed to keep reading but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did remember when Jesus was baptized how do you get the Holy Ghost the Bible said heaven spoke amen they could see it in a year something happened praise God to the body of Jesus the Dove came down to dwell in the tabernacle of Christ amen you could see it you could hear it praise God John saw it now we know not everybody saw but it was seen and heard by some people okay and now you also here's a good one I heard brother Donnie Reagan preach years ago the same people that you know they say oh you don't need a sensation they failed to read on after the seals brother Graham said that's exactly what the church has done it has come from Luther Wesley now back to the original grain back to its original glory back to the glory it was at the beginning he said the Sun that rose in the east it's the same Sun that's manifesting the same thing in the West changed you from glory to glory I'm skipping down he said now it's right to bring back exactly like he was at the beginning same ministry same Jesus same power same Holy Ghost the same one that found the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost that's manifested today from glory into glory to glory and it's back to its original seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the same signs same lunders same baptism same kind of people acting the same kinda way with the same power with the same sensation see that's what false doctrine people always do that they take one whoa and they say look I got a quote but there's so many more quotes amen and then you that's not it I mean first you gotta have a quote but then either the quotes got to be taken back to the word amen I hope our live streamers probably missed on that because I wasn't speaking on the mic so forgive me live streamers there it is I just keep forgetting but so see you can see this is after this is well after this the sermon of where he said without sensation that was from New Year's Eve 1962 so this is what this is - almost a year and a half later yeah almost here have later June 29th 64 now while I'm here I want to just lay something out the Lord really blessed me a few weeks ago I felt like he gave me a little bit of better understanding on the seven thunders so can I just can I just share a few quotes on the seven thunders real quick I was amazed I was listening to brother Jason to Mars you everybody probably members Jason to Mars he preached here a couple years ago and so I was just listening to one of his messages on Facebook it was a really great message on the seven thunders and I came across this really beautiful quote that he was sharing so I want to read it I want to get it up here and read it to you now uh while I get it go to acts 10 and let's look at the seventh under scripture now and church I'm not trying to be uh a know-it-all I'm not a know-it-all but I think the best I'm trying to just express that the way we believe the seven thunders I believe is the right way and I'm not trying to be critical but I'm just trying to say it's the only way that fits scripture okay a lot of people they're still waiting for the seven thunders Oh God's gonna say some seven thunders you know before the rapture and now I know there's quotes on that but and brother branham gives us other quotes on it and then you got to line up with the word so while you're turning there let me pull up the quote that I'm gonna read to you where brother man plainly says it like I said I am enough time these were just kind of quicken to me this morning I think you know as a preacher are you probably aware of it you know sometimes you got the messages way in advance other times it's like waiting on the Lord like Lord am I ever gonna can you please give me some help here yeah and I always I always have many sermons just waiting in the banks I just waiting in my pocket you know I got I always got I got plenty of sermons waiting I could preach that I've already studied and preached but I just want to find what the Lord wants me to do right now now what's interesting is church here's what I want to share this this morning this quote about the thunders was on June 14th 63 today's June 14 2012 and when to share this quote for weeks and I'm like this morning I'm like when was this quote and it was this day 56 years ago so I thought you know that's a pretty good witness that I need to say that I'm not a prophet but it's a pretty good witness like wow that sir that quote was 56 years ago today I thought and it was in the morning sermon too because he preached two sermons that day so I thought I better share this morning because I think is just it's a nice I don't believe in coincidences it's a nice vindication that I was under the thought God wanted me to share okay I just try to look for those things you know as a Christian in the mouth of two or three witnesses that every word be established so I try to just balance my life out like that especially when I'm dealing with preaching now revelation 10 you know the mighty angel comes down we know it's Christ it can only be Christ it matches his description from revelation 1 it has to be Christ the feet of pillars of fire and the rainbow and everything faces the Sun that it has to be Christ and he has a book open it was the book of the seven seals from chapters four and five the book that Christ opened in Chapter six is now being brought to earth right and then verse three and cry with the loud voice as when a lion roar and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices so when this book is brought to earth seven thunders sound right now John is told he's gonna ride him down but he said don't ride him he said seal him up and don't ride him he said seal him up so that's all we know is all we know is that when that book came down seven thunders uttered their voices and God did not want what was uttered written amen and but then remember verse seven the angel gets the open book and he and then the Bible said the mystery of God is finished amen that means whatever those Thunder said gotta be finished amen right because the mystery of God everything that's mysterious about God that we need for the rapture is already finished because it's already been brought down to earth the but is open the seven thunders of God and the Bible said the mystery of God is finished and then you and I take it to the rest of the world praise God John eats it and verse 11 then he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings so whatever those thunders said it's got to be part of the finished mystery and then it's got to be taken around the world how can we prophesy again if we don't know what it is the reality is we know what it is it's the revelations of the seven seals it's the only one that makes sense and now look at this quote program he add Recker I'm sorry he directly addresses how the seven thunders cannot be something outside the Bible they gotta be in the Bible you'd be surprised how many preachers believe the thunders are gonna be something outside of the Bible they can't be because Jesus said you can't add to it or take away from it and brotherman plainly says it everyone has come to me and said brother Brennan I look at this brother and says they're trying to trick him so it's Satan Satan got in these brothers a brother and he them seven thunders at the voice uh Terr he said write him not see close it up and that'll be the seven thunders that'll be revealing the last AC the seven thunders that'll tell us now don't that sound real good see but watch what you're talking about when you say that I'll tell you I just rejoice for the Jose I just rejoice when I heard brother Jason read this I'm like where was I I've listened this sermon before how did I miss this quote but see God lets me forget and then he brings it back at a time when I need it and you'd be surprised every seems like every month I get somebody emailing me what huh what is about the seven thunders what about the trumpets what about the seals and so I got these quotes I just give him write to him so they don't get mixed up in some fanaticism now I said he said write it not oh yeah he said seething riding out see the seven thunders other voices he he said don't write that but it's to be sealed up in the book until the last days now someone has been Manning now look many has been saying to me can you imagine people asking you all the time brother Brandon with the Lord if it with your experience that the Lord has given you for his people humbly saying this and I look at humbly you you spoke to the smoke and squirrels into existence you've done all these things and humbly do you think you can tell us do you think the seven thunders have come later look what he says with your experience the Lord has given you humbly you would be eligible to ride a Bible yourself couldn't you a prophet write your own Bible see your word if God is manifested I said that might be true see he was trying to catch me so of all these many people one of them was anointed of the devil trying to catch him see be careful people that like you not everybody likes you is really for you brother bang they're trying to catch you they're trying to get you to say something that will go outside the word brother BAM had enough to sermon to know it oh this this humble supportive person was really led of the devil he was trying to catch me look at that in that awesome little man lets us know this oh I love it he said but you see couldn't do that he said well why couldn't you you have all the qualifications I said but you look one word cannot be added or taken away so church let me just say like this as we get closer to the rapture get your eyes in this word it's okay to pray for and seek revelations I do it to many men but I know any revelation that's worth anything it's gonna come out of this word amen now here's where it deals with the seven thunders and he said well well them seven thunders you see wouldn't them seven thunders blasting now won't that be a revelation to be give to some man I said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking something from it so his whole reason behind it was to try to pressure brother Branham give us seven thunders give us some revelation that's outside the Bible and brother Branham was a god-sent prophet amen he said don't pressure me to do that it ain't gonna be you can't add to the Bible you can't take away from the Bible it's all revealed in there now he's talking about the thunders it's all revealing there and the seven seals opened up what the revelation of that was Amen see you and brother and preached the first seal the seven thought the first Thunder under his voice amen as he preached and said that's thus saith the Lord that was the thunder we heard on Wednesday night when that beautiful that was so awesome I finished my sermon and we hear the thunder of God amen oh I thought thank you Lord Jesus amen what a good timing praise God he said no he's a no sir he said the seven seals open the revelation of what that was that's what it was see it's still in the word Amen see it won't leave the word he said you can't get out of that word it won't leave the word and God's Spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word blinding some and open the eyes of others it'll always do that and the church said well bang I could share there are many quotes for mother madam said those seven thunders gonna be real right about the end time listen we're listening to right now to the Seventh Seal that's where he says it the most but later months later the Holy Spirit is the obviously dealing with him for these people trying to get him to say the seven thunders and finally the Holy Spirit strikes him and said that's wrong it can't be anything outside the word it has to be in the Bible does everybody understand now there's two quotes you know after there's one in questions and answers I'll pull it up real quick cuz I succès didn't have time to get all these going here oh there it is okay he said have the seven thunders they asked brother Brad specifically have the seven thunders been revealed yeah have the seven thunders which equals seven mysteries already been revealed were they revealed the seven seals better are yet but are not known to us as the thunders yet he said no they were revealed in the seven seals this is two months after the quote I just read you that was June member June July August two months later the people asked him straightly arthas are the thunders revealed or not he said yes they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the thunders was about so you have seven thunders you have seven seals that's what each thunder was about one of the seals the seven thunders that had uttered their voices no one could make out what it was John knew what it was but he's forbidden to ride it he said with the seventh angel son look what he ties it again see he ties it in again revelation ten seven but in the days of the sounding the seven mysteries of the seven thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is the messenger of the seventh church age okay and then now you know the you probably know if you've been around here a little bit is the seven thunders quote he will reveal brother Branham says that's what the seventh messenger will do here the mysteries I better get my words right here so I'm sorry for taking the time but I just want to nail this down I thought you know since the date of that quote was today I wonder if I would want to preach it for a while I thought I just better do that now the messenger of Malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi he will turn the hearts of the children to the father's see our hearts should we turn to the book of Acts praise God we should say God give us a church like they had in the book of Acts amen we've seen we have the same baptism we we've seen many of those same signs but we are promised the fullness of that church right before the rapture amen that's why we know there's more of it to come because God said I will restore what should our prayers before now restore the power amen we've seen power but restore more of it praise God amen we've seen people save but restore all the people that can be saved see we got we have the restored word we have the restored doctrine but we want to see all that they had in the book of Acts we want to see that restored to the Bride of Christ that's thus saith the Lord I'll show you that one next according to Malachi 4 turn the hearts to he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truce that literally turned the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal father's exactly so and the church said now it's on tape George Smith who was brother and son-in-law said that brother Branham probably read this book over five times before it was published because his wife Rebecca SH now she passed away she would read it to her dad sometimes while they're driving down the road and then there's audio tapes of lavell and brother Branham giving their ideas back on editing this book they edited it for about four years four or five years so brother Graham read this through or heard it at least five times and see these quotes match the quotes I just read you from the questions and answers so anybody that's trying to get you to find you look for something that's contrary to the word just tell them say get behind me Satan I'm staying with God's Word I've heard the thunders of God amen I think the Thunder of God has roared out and its impact in my life praise God amen it's turned my heart back to the Apostolic father's glory all right now let me poke that one real quick again as I've always said this is one of these days Lord willing I want to buy one of those stickers you know how people can hang skips or stickers on the wall and it's like a Bible quote one of these days I want to put that scripture over there the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride thus saith the Lord because that's our vision any church without a vision will perish right but what about the true seed it will happen just as we've said the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the Spirit will bring the people right back to where they were the beginning that is thus saith the LORD Oh what are we doing church we are prophesying again to every nation kindred and tongue amen we are part of Revelation 10 11 we're doing it here in America praise God we're prophesy again and every week I get another request somebody overseas likes my video and they start listening to our sermons I got one this week from Uganda another brother wants to follow our the preaching because they they can sense the Holy Spirit's in it so see even even our little church is doing its part to take this mint this revelation this mystery and prophesy it again that's the age we're living in then he quotes the scripture I will restore where is it there it is Joel - 23 to 26 is our scripture for the latter rain before the rapture I'll restore all the years the loketh is eaten by and ye shall here's here's our prophecy church this is what we're going to come to we are going to eat in plenty and be satisfied and we're gonna praise the name of Jesus before the rapture we will eat all God's food will be satisfied will praise His name then we will have the fullness of Pentecost back in the church the program says how it's gonna be done now he says it twice did I miss it yeah he says it twice thus saith the Lord it is thus saith the Lord for that is what Joel 2:23 says and then he tells us the latter rain is rapturing faith at the bottom he said God is doing it he's restoring his church by 23 verse 23 the former and latter rain next will come the harvest rain a rapture in faith so we got to stay under this and this is what I believe it now - I know many preachers disagree with me the rain we're getting right now is teaching rain people don't want to be taught the Word of God they just want to come to church and live however they want to live but if you're a real child of God you'll be enjoying the rain from heaven and it's gonna teach you this message amen it's gonna teach you the message because Jesus said go into all nations and teach and make disciples amen praise God they said baptize them in the name of the father's and only ghost let's pull that up real quick he said teaching all nations where's my Bible app there it is so I wasn't really planning this is one of those nervous sermons well Jose where I was trying to get a message ready but I felt like the Holy Spirit gave me some kind of just waiting on his leading you know Lou usually I got all the quotes lined up and it's just picture perfect not today and these are the days I don't like preaching like that but God can still use it praise God okay what Scripture was I going to are you forgot hmm help me Lord oh yeah yeah thank you thank you brother appreciate that teaching all nations yeah thank you brother yeahthere's yeah you know and in church even I think a lot of people misunderstand these are God's last work these are Christ's last words before he leaves the earth he says all power is given to me in heaven and earth go either for and teach all nations teach teach baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the son of the Holy Ghost teaching them he says it twice people need to learn how to obey God amen how do you get children to obey at school Johnny I just got to tell them over and over they got to erase their their capital letter capital T when it should be a lower case they got erase it and erase it and rewrite it until they learn it praise God same way for us a preachers got to preach it brother cams got to preach it brother Brooks has to preach it brother Jesse's got to preach it all these preachers and I gotta learn it too we all got to learn it we all got to be taught the things of God amen that's the rain that's falling now but about the time of the rapture there's gonna come a greater anointing praise God it's not the latter rain it's gonna be rapturing faith amen and don't worry God will get you ready for it amen if God got them ready for the first Exodus if God got them ready for the second axis then you know God's going to get us ready for the third accidents amen we will not glory in our ability always we will do is just yield to the Holy Spirit the same way they did if the second Exodus was the day of Pentecost what do they do they just let the conditions they kind of got nervous of the conditions the conditions squeeze them to the upper room come on church and then they started praying brother Johnny and they started crying out to God for 10 days and then the fire fell a man the scripture the promise was fulfilled see God is going to get us ready for the rapture amen you don't to rely upon a man you should trust man and and love your Christian family but God is going to get us ready because Jesus does all three the shout voice of the Trump as he descends amen he does all three that's what Paul said Paul said Jesus will give a shout a voice and a Trump Jesus does all three Jesus is gonna get glory not us nobody's come nobody's gonna come in heaven and worship and say oh you're a Laodicean Church age bride member oh you're so holy that not we need to get that nonsense if it's in our minds we need to get it out of our behinds we're not gonna get any glory will get honored by Jesus will get it rewards from Jesus but Jesus is gonna get all the glory praise God amen see we got to teach well the RAM says the rain right now is the teaching rain how many want to learn just how to live the message I'm constantly I want to always learn how I can live the message especially for my children that I can be good examples to my children for the next generation I'm constantly seeing my failures here my fairs there but I'm also seeing victories here amen like my children coming up for the Holy Ghost I didn't tell them to come up God brought them up now their experiences they got a lineup just like just like I do they got a lineup their experience to the word just like I got do it too I can't give them the Holy Ghost I can't I don't beg them to get the Holy Ghost now when they when they were little I'll be I'll be honest when they were little sister Naomi I go up to their bed I remember Malik guys bunk and ladies bunk and while they're sleeping I pray God please fill them with the Holy Ghost I did that numerous times but I don't think I ever told them that I mean if maybe they were half awake one time and heard me do that but I would go in there and say God fill them with the Holy Ghost God let your Holy Ghost come upon them let them be real Christians and for the girls I pray God send Holy Ghost fill men that they'll marry and not these scallywags that say they believe and don't have the Holy Ghost I think that's a pirate term or something like that but that's just the word that came to my mind so forgive me you know what I mean some in in sincere unrepentant churchgoer that's not born again that doesn't love the blood of Jesus Christ that doesn't love the cross of Jesus Christ God sends some men who are really born again that love Jesus Christ more than everything else amen don't have these perverted message churchgoers that are addicted to pornography try to woo my daughter's and I pray the Holy Spirit protect this church from that amen I know yeah that's my prayer or some Jezebel that would try to trick maokai into it and lord willing our next son we'll see but you understand church we need taught the Word of God all of our trials in life are to teach us God's Word how many believe that everything in life is a lesson so we can learn how to better serve the Lord but a lot of people don't like to learn these are just to turn on the TV or it's easier to turn on your phone or your iPad right it's easier to turn that on rather than just pray it now it's okay if your turn on to worship right but if people are in other words they're trying to escape repentance if they're trying to escape dealing with problems or escape dealing with their situation and just escape that like they would alcohol I mean that's all I can was saying we're that beautiful that's all people's smartphones are they're just another form of alcoholism it's just another way for people to escape and and feed their fleshly lusts it's just a different form right it's just another idle see just like a bottle of alcohol so idle just like a pack of cigarettes as idle people's phones can become idols too and so we must make sure nothing is idle we must use that phone we must use all that God's given us to help us glorify the Lord yeah we know that priests long and hard on that so see don't and I know there's quotes but you have to balance out all the codes brother and says see the gospel is not done in teaching it's done in power and demonstration that's true but but it's both true both are true you got to have the power of God then you got to come around and teach him how to live right right because we've all seen people that have had miracles happen like I was telling that brother at cancer he used to walk on a cane God healed him I was there and God did it and now they're back stirred in living in the world so you need the power of the power of God was there to show them how real God is to show them God's love but then you got to be trained and taught God's Word afterwards amen because we all got away we all got to come God's provided way through justification st. vacation that's holy ghost my okay now I think I'm yeah okay now let me pull this out here let me post next chord out here I've used this in the past but as I was praying this morning at the altar this script this quote came to my mind oh yeah there's only one okay okay so Bob Rams preaching or teaching in the Laodicean Church age and he's saying how he's saying how denominations have enough of the Holy Ghost they don't want more that's what I love how everybody supported our special meetings and I love even more how you're here the next Sunday because special meetings aren't enough you need more of God today right anybody can get excited for special meetings I get excited too but who can get up the next week when there's no special guests no visitors there's nothing there's nothing fantastic going on but who just wants more of God amen that's who's got the Holy Ghost that's quarter brother branham he said he said compare the twentieth century Church to the first century Church go ahead where's the power where's the power and denominations and mega churches just to overcome lust or greed where's the power there they don't have it where's the love who was it telling me this week a preacher former domination oh yeah yeah there's a brother well there's a brother from Columbus yeah the brother from Columbus one of his buddies went to a new church and the pastor buddied him up they were Pentecostal they were speaking in tongues and believed in all kinds of supernatural things but the pastor buddy them up and then said hey can you invest this certain number of thousands of dollars we're gonna try to do this business investment and then a week later the pastor stopped contact him he just took the money man can you imagine that church that's that's in Columbus that's not a message church but it's people that used to in the message and they go to the visit these churches you better watch those preachers you better watch those preachers where's the love you don't have enough the very purpose he brought him in was to get money from them and then just go ahead and go I got a big enough Church you can go ahead and go Devils and shoe-leather is what they are where's the purified Church that withstood sin and walked with fate toward Jesus where's the unity you can't find it if this church has all it needs speaking of the denominator church why were they in Pentecost crying out for more of God in the book of Acts as though they didn't have it at all and yet they had far more than they have today go to acts 4 here's where they're crying out for more of God they just got the Holy Ghost I think a few days or weeks previous to this and we read it on a little bit on Wednesday night but go back there acts 424 this is the quote this is the scripture brother Rams referring to the original Holy Ghost field st. they got the Holy Ghost Peter and John did that miracle on the name of Jesus Christ rise up they got persecuted they got brought before the council they got beaten and they were so there were a little bit discouraged so they went to have a prayer meeting and then they prayed and the Holy Ghost filled everybody that wasn't filled so church like this is a good idea when we get discouraged we need a fresh prayer meeting we need a fresh time in the closet sister Beatrice we need a fresh time on our knees amen and ask God restore my boldness amen I need more of God romance in the early church they were crying out for more of God that's proof that they had a see proof that people don't have it is they don't want more of the Holy Ghost they're lukewarm see verse 24 and when they'd heard that they lift up their voice to God with one Accord and said Lord thou art God which has made heaven and earth and the sea and all that is in them now go down to verse 29 and now Lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word by stretching forth thine hand he that signs and wonders may be done by the name with I Holy Child Jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and then they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the Word of God with boldness this is the scripture brother Rance referring to people that had the Holy Ghost said I can see I'm not bored as I should be Lord send the power give me a fresh anointing in my mind praise God thank the Lord the church sometimes you'll see me come up here for prayer that's because I need a fresh anointing I'm saying God restore my boldness how many can say amen to that you've needed a fresh anointing from time to time when you go through trials and you get discouraged you got a that's what we have to do we have to cry out for more with the danger as we said in message churches as people that go for weeks and years and months and decades and never cried to God for fresh experience and I think I can share like it when I was there at Albion last time in September I had grown people 60 and 70 years old walking up they've been that they've been in the message longer than I've been alive and they're weeping and crying say I don't even feel like I'm saved now why now we had a good prayer and I gave him some quotes in the scriptures and later that over Facebook I get I shared some things and I think they got their victory back but see church you know we shouldn't go decades and decades and decades without a fresh experience where we know God's Spirit came down and anointed me it failed me it gave me power and I'm walking in victory praise God let's be one of those Saints that you have victory you go from victory to victory from glory to glory from faith to faith more and more shining brighter unto a perfect day praise God let's be like that and I'm not speaking against that the sweet people out there Alby and I'm just saying it could have been any Church you know I'm just saying that was one example yeah I thank God for the that they came up for prayer that's a good sign that the Holy Spirit's deal with you when you come up for prayer for things like that but you don't have to come up for prayer God can meet you right at your seat how many believe that it just raises your faith many times when you come up for prayer because you're gathering your faith you're putting it with a minister or a brother sister something along those lines okay and I want to read this too and then I'll get back to my my text here I guess it's all kind of the same program tells us Jesus now look at this you know who Jesus his biggest enemy was his flesh well Ram said in his own personal life contending with himself can you imagine that Jesus had to drive away the devil the angels came and strengthened him but brother have said he was contending with his own flesh in that encouraging your greatest enemy is gonna be yourself if you can just overcome your flesh your sin nature how did Jesus overcome by obedience to the Word of God there's no other way to overcome then obey God's Word in other words don't sin next time don't let that addiction get you again don't let it happen overcome it Hebrews 5 7 it says who in the days of his flesh we need to offer the prayers and supplications with strong crying in tears under him that was able to save him from death he was heard and that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all that obey Him what was the obedient to the Word of God and now let's bring it down to you and I now then there will not be one person who will sit in the throne with the Lord Jesus unless he's been living that word so brother that makes it clear the only way you're gonna sit by Jesus is to cry out and say God deliver me from my flesh amen and then get victory over my flesh amen that's the only way how many want to sit by Jesus I know I already know my seat if I make it my seat is the last one in the the last one because I'm the least of all God's servants I believe that I really am but I'm doing a seat there praise God they said the only way you're gonna do that is if you're living the word you're overcoming the sin nature in your flesh now look you says your prayers your fastings your repentance is no matter what you present to God none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that throne see something that denominations they fast think of Muslims they fast all the time at their holidays and Jews they fast way more than probably we do see fasting prayers repentance see that's probably half harder repentance no matter what you present that won't gain you the privilege of sitting in that throne it will be granted he says only to the word broad as the throne of the king is shared with the Queen because she's United to him so only they who are of that word even as he's of that word will share that throne and this is where I've been laboring on Peter said if you want to overcome giving all diligence right so it's gonna take here Peter says everything you get is by a promise see that by these you might be partakers of diet into by nature by what promises so we have to read a promise like let's say justice overcoming greed or pornography you got to look at the promise and you gotta look at Joel where he said I made a covenant with my eyes I won't look upon a maid you have to read that promise and say God I believe that I'm gonna obey that next time the tempter comes see what I mean and now you're an overcomer you got to believe that promise and then when you obey that promise now you overcome amen but see it's gonna take some effort see that's what Americans don't like Americans don't like effort they don't want to give effort because life gets so easy well the rams have a higher paying job we'll just make things a little bit easier for your flesh it's not gonna make it easier on your spirit right now the god we get you know job increases you know money increases but that's not the answer the answer is increasing your love for God that's the answer increasing your time coming to church increase your time praying an increase increase your time serving other people that's the answer if you can have that with that then praise God if not God may take you through a season of loss so see escaped corruption and then give all your diligence if we want to get closer to God we got to give all diligence but man says I don't care if you faster pray or try to repent you've got to live the word if we overcome and give all diligence we'll sit with him on his throne he's got a seat ready somewhere by him I imagine you know Paul might be here Peter might be there it's up to the Father but I want a seat up there by the grace of God now he says it again just so you know yeah Peter repeats it you know why they do repeat it to emphasize it he says wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fail in other words prove it to everybody prove to everybody which side you're on if you want people to know you're a wise version then prove it to them when sin is placed before you cast it down overcome it and be an overcomer praise God when your flesh when it's just you and your flesh and no one else is around prove that you're the word bride cast that down overcome it and the Bible said that he'll give you the victory in due season praise God amen all right is that helpful by God's grace now that's my introduction praise the Lord so now let's uh let's move on here I didn't really plan to preach all that go to acts 11:15 that's all that kind of came to me and a lot of that is review but we need to review it from time to time don't wait Church how many appreciate that reminder I hope somebody appreciates it now what convinces this group of Jews who really they think all Gentiles are dirty filthy human beings and they won't eat with them what convinces them that the Holy Ghost did fall on Cornelius and his house verse verse verse 14 who shall tell the words which whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved and I see as I began to speak the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning then I remembered I the word of the Lord how that he said John indeed baptize with fire but I shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost for as much then as God gave them the like gift as he dosnt us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ what was I that I could withstand God look at that he was trying to withstand God he was trying like I don't want to go to the Gentiles lord I don't want to go there and then eventually he went through the three visions remember the visions of the sheet drop down finally then he said okay and then corniest falls down to worship him he said get up I'm just a man he knew he was a man cuz he failed he denied Christ three times I'm sure that was fresh on his mind I'm nobody Church we should have the same attitude who are I Who am I who are we were nothing but with God all things are possible so raised him up he started preaching the Holy Ghost falls on them and then the next verse I believe it's a 18 and when they heard these things they helped their peace and glorified God saying then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life so how did Peter convince these Jews that were staunch we don't like Gentiles they're just their unholy rollers we won't even eat with him how'd he convince them he used experience and the word glory that's what you and I need praise God to convince us of anything we've got to see God vindicated by a supernatural power and first it's got to be in the word see that and here's what I believe with amen since those guys since those Jews were filled the Holy Ghost as the Holy Ghost anointed Peter I believe the Holy Ghost came in like a rushing mighty wind and just swept over those men's minds in there there discriminator racism right against Gentiles that's what is the same thing you'll do today same thing you do today let the Holy Spirit anoint a man he'll just talk about the Holy Ghost if that person's really born again the Holy Spirit will change their minds if they're willing to accept correction imagine that some brilliant man some of these men were probably 40 50 60 years old and they knew Gentiles were dirty filthy pigs dogs seek Jesus call them dogs and in a moment their mind has changed because they the Holy Spirit was there they said well if they acted like us and they must be one of them praise God and they got excited about Jesus and looked like they were drunk and declaring the wonderful works of God they must be born again and so the Holy Spirit changed their minds after decades of this disgrace towards Gentiles and look and putting their nose up at him and all those things God changed their minds in a moment by the power of the Holy Spirit glory remember they thought they were drunk now well Johnny spent a long time since I've been around drunk people so I've been a Holy Ghost field sanctified Saint for a long time but the last time I remember being around drunk people where they meant was that some parties and they just had this the big red you know how their faces were red I don't know and I got smelly breath I never really got drunk all the way I just kind of got a little buzzed I guess you saw you say like that but I always knew I was kind of in control I said but I started saying things as soon as I started saying things I'm like I didn't know that was gonna come out of my mouth I started losing my inhibitions as soon as that happened I turned out and I never liked the taste of it anyway it's poison you know but you know when you see a drug person a lot of them just get really lose their inhibitions right and they stick out their chest and they start talking real loud a lot of them do well what do you think the Holy Ghost does the people and then they're fearful it's caring and doubting the Holy Spirit sets them free praise God and they worship God and they said they're a bunch of drunk people it's 9:00 a.m. what are they doing and running around the streets here what are you doing and praising God crying they must be drunk and Peter said no this is what Joel spoke up this is that which the Prophet Joel spoke up this is divine wine praise God this is that this is God pouring out shedding his spirit upon us and we're declaring the wonderful works of God so much so the three thousand people got saved the same thing they wanted in Chapter four give us boldness they were boldly praising the Lord oh thank you Jesus brother Branham calls his experience booooo-whoo experience maybe I can find out a little quote I mean I got it on my notes but let me see if I can just pull it up real quick here in the app he says I think every once in a while when it comes back on me yeah here's the new verb there's no different from any other birth it's a mess so children think about what happened two Saturdays ago it's got to be a mess it's got to be like you've lost you lost your control of your of yourself and you start praise and glorifying God you ought to see what mess I was when I got it and every once in a while see I like that seat we got to have fresh experiences every now and then and every once in a while when it comes upon me again again I get messy again with it I cry and boohoo and carry on till guests I don't know I don't look very good to look at when I got something on the inside of me that's taking me on and on and on it's new life I don't care what it looks like I want to know what it is that's the main thing hey man see when you come to church and just get a boldness or maybe you're not both happy maybe just crying and boldness and praising God but when you leave out of here with new life then God has given you a fresh anointing and you're to use that anointing to serve the Lord and that anointing is let you know you are born again is to remind you I'm taking you higher I'm taking you further I'm gonna keep you pray like brother even I was thinking about he will hold me fast hey man he gives you a fresh anointing to hold you for another couple years or maybe months or weeks whatever you need praise God I'm gonna give you a fresh anointing so you can have power and strength to continue on the journey he said I'm he said it comes upon me I don't care how I look I just need new life thank the Lord and that's honestly what a lot of drunk people I've seen look like you know they're all red red eye they look kind of tired and some of them get sad and angry you don't see them fight well that's a program says boohoo carry on praise the Lord now one thing go to second Corinthians you know I'll just pull it up here this is the thing I've seen the message where I think the most people well you understand it except probably I've said it before yeah there's two kinds of weeping at the altar right it's either galley weeping or it's worldly weeping for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of so when you have a really godly cry you'll see because your life will be more obedient that's godly repentance but the sorrow of the world worketh death okay so anybody and I've seen it you know I'll share it again just because you know Johnny and Sarah here a couple years ago we had a brother I was really trying to help him out you know becoming the message and there was twice I pray with him at least an hour and a half on two occasions so for a total of three hours we cried at this altar right here this altar and I tried casting off that devil often brother amen about 10 times and he wept and cried and scream you probably know who I'm talking about but I'm just using it as an example and the very next Wednesday he wasn't even in church already fought after weeping and cried for an hour and a half it was worldly sorrow because they everybody has a conscience that they're doing wrong and everybody they're honest will feel bad about it and when they finally face up to it they're gonna sorrow you're gonna have a motion one way or the other you're gonna be emotional and either continue in it or get emotional and and die yourself and that the power of Christ guide you so there's two kinds of emotion so children that's what you should be examine your life if you are really repentant Paul says you're gonna see it your repentance onto deliverance you're gonna be delivered you're gonna see your little you're living a victorious delivered life okay so no make sure I say that that's where there's a lot of confusion people in the message say they're born again because they cry at the altar well that just might be worldly sorrow it's gotta be genuine repentance and then he says later he says you will have zeal I like this if you want to get revenge on the devil do it by obeying God's Word don't badmouth somebody that's us uh that's what is that that's hatred that's wrath that's jealousy don't badmouth somebody you obey God's Word that's how you get vengeance on Satan because he says it right here he says yes you saw it after a godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yay what clearing of yourself what indignation see zeal when you really repent you got zeal to do what's right next time what the Hemet desire what zeal what revenge there it is right there revenge amen glory in other words like for me it was I'm gonna take a revenge on those cigarettes and I'm gonna write walk right past him at Walmart and I'm not gonna buy him and then people I see smoking I'm gonna try to witness to them and say God deliver me from smoking say I would take revenge on that I'm gonna have zeal and desire to do what's right the next time because I really had godly sorrow praise God all right now now let's go through a few more things I want to bring up here by God's grace how am i doing okay let me set my timer I usually do about a hour and a half on Sunday morning and that's right yeah so let's uh let's finish with a couple more things here I want to say give me 15 more minutes I set my timer the next thought I want to bring out is this thought on not only will you have an emotional experience you have to have one of those to be born again right you got to have some something's got to happen to you when you're born again it might be it might be fire over your forehead it might be running in the streets it might be shouting about we might be magnifying God might be prophesying speaking in tongues now most people I know don't have the prophecy or speaking in tongues or we just have mostly magnifying God you know which is good that's that's that's that's right that's that's fine uh because it's all ordained of God because the gifts and callings of God are without repentance and let me lay this in here before I forget brother Cameron brother Brooks told all these stories about speaking the word right brother Brooks would speak to a paper and let me just remind our church of this brother cam Wood spoke to the cat right josè spoken to the barren woman right I spoke to who is that right spoke to the mountain that was in front of them I'll say like that and God honor those requests I just want to reiterate to you we can only do that as letter the Lord because I talk to brother Brooks and cam they both have problems you talked to me I have some problems I wish we could figure out you know well if it's so easy to speak to everything why don't we just want me to speak to our problems because you can't do it until God tells you to do it let me tell you brother Oaks can they have some real problems with people in their church and family they have some real family problems look at my family look at my parents we have some real problems and I do anything but Johnny I'd do anything to speak right now to that mountain but I can't do it until God tells me to do it does ever understand I want to just encourage you like whether even Jose this week with Jose I was just use you I was like Lord just annoying me to speak to your mouth situation because remember those quotes brother Ram said we gotta have faith to cure a toothache right and so my heart I'm like Lord anoint me while I'm still waiting right here but I can't do it not in my flesh I want to but I can't do it until God tells me to do it but see if we all get under the spirit and we all go under God's anointing maybe God will have somebody do it that's the thing that's where Paul says you got to not just you just got to not just go to church you got to walk in the spirit we got to constantly pray and say God speak to me and have me know what you had me to do help me to be able to speak to it I'm glad I'm glad Jose's feeling better he can come to church now thank God for that we prayed for that there's everything to understand I just want you to understand so much that just like brother Branham said we can't speak anything until God tells us to but we got to be sanctified and set aside so God can tell us to do something like that because I was really moved by those testimonies I love I love the one I was a witness of cam situation cam let me know about that that man that kind of swindled the money from him cam let me know about that a year ago now and I'll tell you bout Johnny I was mad on the phone I was like brother cam you need to take him to court I think I was saying stuff like that I was like man that was a lot of money it was thousands of dollars I don't suppressions say the number I remember it was a lot of money and I felt bad for my brother amen I was like feeling bad like what should I do I'm gonna call that guy in Tomah and I never did but I felt the flesh and it's so awesome to hear I didn't even know that story till cam told it the Holy Spirit just said wait on it you know just wait just forgive forgive and then he got some of that money back years later I was a witness of that because I was cam told me about it right after it happened and see Church God work everything out if you just leave it in his hands we got to leave everything in those precious nail-scarred hands alright now let me go through this thought this is the one I want to close with here you will do more than just come to church pay your tithes we know all those things those are all excellent oddly things to do we wouldn't have a church without it right so remember speaking in tongues I got six things we know tongues isn't the evidence but I'll skip those but in the book that's coming out Lord willing if God will help me the sixth reason that tongues aren't the Holy Ghost is because Jesus told us what the real evidence of the Holy Ghost was and he says the Holy Ghost he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance that's in John 14:26 John 16:13 howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth has come he'll guide you into all truth he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he hears that shall he speak and he will show you things to come see the evidence you're a child of God but have says that you can be taught the the Word of God from your father that's in John 6:45 it is written in the prophets and they shall all be taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the Father cometh unto me so see when we get message people that hang on the message but they never learned how to serve God better it shows they're not born again because Jesus had teach them to observe all that I command you they gotta have supernatural yes they got to have some miracle some something supernatural some vision or something they got to magnify God but after that they got to learn to be taught all the word and that's why I know it's the evidence because most people don't like that most people don't like to be taught the word then they got apologize and they gotta say they're sorry but most people if they're not born again they don't want to apologize okay the Bible said sinners will increase unto more and more ungodliness that ii corinthians 2:16 paul said evil men and seducers or wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived to see church you're either going to grow one way or the other right you're going to grow in a nick witty I know I should be doing this my it's too long I need to get right with God but you keep saying that over and over you're gonna grow thatwe are gonna grow up into him into all things even Christ see we're growing one way or the other now there might be an argument where you say the foolish virgin just has a stalemate and I believe that might be true because see she's a virgin she doesn't interact she doesn't worship and have intercourse with the world and it's idols she just stays virgin but she never goes into the Holies of Holies as we heard last Saturday right to have relationship with Christ amen of Christ in part is life into their souls praise God so that I think there can be something said for that that's something I have to study out a little more by God's grace okay last things here last things I have seven quick scriptures one more evidence you're born again the notice evidences brother BAM said there's no certain evidence the evidence is you believe all the word not let you said there's no certain evidence he said you just believe all the word and you live all the word here's the next evidence John 13:35 by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one to another now remember brilli love is the step before the baptism Holy Ghost so when you see people that can't love other people they hate people they badmouth people they lie against people now how can they have brotherly love even brotherly love let alone the Holy Ghost but then when you got the Holy Ghost you have the fruit of love it's mature love right it's ripe love it's it's seasoned it's been brought forth it shines it's it's beautiful print like we had some shiny strawberries yesterday they were all they were ripe I'll tell you I was like man that's the color red right there that's glorious that's how the your love should be praise God people should see my that's that's weathered fruit that that fruit is ripe but just delicious that's how a Christian should act that's more evidence you have to love he said you'll know my disciples cuz they love one another second they'll have supernatural signs and wonders and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils speak with new tongues lay hands on the sick and they shall recover mark 16 third they'll remember Jesus's words jesus said the Holy Ghost shall bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I said unto you fourth they here's here's one thing I like to church testifying and glorifying Jesus Jesus said the Spirit of Truth he shall testify of me and he shall glorify me let me share this brother hope this okay do you remember when we had the testimony services a few years ago up here we had some people that testified up here and if you listen to their testimony closely they never talked about the cross or any supernatural you probably know what I'm talking about and they've since left the message listen to people's testimony Church Jesus said if you got the Holy Ghost it'll testify of me re amen see there's some people that can testify facts there's other people that can testify of supernatural Holy Ghost power praise God and like I said there's been preachers we had up here that I've left the message now what happened in their testimony they didn't have the right testimony see that's one of the evidences you're born again you will testify of Jesus Christ in all things he helped you as you get saved you sanctify you food with all the ghosts he's helping you all throughout your life constant testimonies of God's grace hey man thank you lord almost done he will here's another evidence he'll convict you of your sin and you'll overcome sin John 16:8 jesus said the Holy Spirit will reprove the world of sin that means convict and then first John 5:4 for whatsoever is born of God overcomes the world glory program says that the church age book he said if you're an overcomer you gotta overcome now praise God you always said the only way you're no you're an overcomer is if you're overcoming right now thank the Lord my just oh it's so good it thank the Lord oh I believe I'm one of them praise God God helps me overcome my battles in life I repent of them I say I'm sorry and God helps me overcome the next time six you will know future events Jesus said the Spirit of Truth will show you things to come he'll show us things to come like I've made a whole video on that that's one of my most popular videos right now is thus saith the Lord future prophecies William Branham God has let us know all these things as to come and remember we knew the coronavirus because now I didn't predict it but we identified in the scripture Jesus foretold pestilences will come but it's the beginning of Sorrows that's right in Scripture same thing with h1n1 they're all beginning of Sorrows or the ending of Sorrows and last one that's into our feet here's the another evidence you listen to and believe the human preachers God sends to you in your lifetime that's another evidence you got the Holy Ghost because Jesus Christ said neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word and that they all may be one see that Christians have a oneness real Holy Ghost field Saints will have a oneness with William Branham if he was God's prophet we know he was now has a oneness there there are other preachers in the message that preach the truth whoever oneness I'm glad I got a oneness with cam and Isaiah and all the saints you know I am you got to have that that's one of the evidences you're born again and I hope this was helpful by God's grace I just felt led to the Holy Spirit to go back here and let's invite our musicians to come if you have a song with it okay wonderful just play that song here I'm today I was preaching to the soul I was preaching to the very depths of your being how many believe that when we talk about the Holy Ghost baptism I'm preaching as deep as I can go I can't go any deeper than that I'm not just talking about all you need to you need to wear more modest clothes looks a little too tight that's on the outside right I mean I just talk about mind battles here I'm talking about the soul is Jesus Christ spirit is it quicken your soul can you look down at your nature and say my nature's been quickened my soul's been filled my soul's been sealed amen my soul's been circumcised they met all these descriptions of it's all the one the same my soul the very my very I'll said I this the heart of my heart is God's presence God has come and lived upon the throne of my heart and every now and then glory that Holy Ghost comes on me on a great way again and I boohoo and worship and praise God I get new life to strengthen me for the next phase of my journey how do you what a blessing what a blessing [Music] thank you for being such a wonderful audience here I know some of this was review but I just felt led to tie it all in together Church I hope for you it's becoming more and more clear all the time as they become more clear to you all the time I don't watch you but as these more people fall away all the time it should become more clear to me that we've got it right not because of me but because the Holy Spirit people majored on this major on that man and majored on that got a major on Christ if people born again when they're born again Jesus said you have power amen to be witnesses unto Jerusalem Judea and the uttermost parts of the world you got power don't be a witness power to testify power thank you Lord let's

cry out to God may we be desperate and may we get born again that will be you have power to be witnesses that we can be taught the Word of God and growing race and the knowledge of Lord unto Christ
