[28:53] Lord tonight I just have my brother
[28:56] right here praise God and brother
[28:58] William nice to have him here praise the
[28:59] Lord
[28:59] so thankful for God's grace so I'd like
[29:04] to go to revelation 17 I like to
[29:05] continue this series I don't matter what
[29:08] part this is was it 97 okay 97 or 98
[29:12] okay so we're just gonna lay in some
[29:14] good things here tonight I think you'll
[29:16] be blessed well I know you'll be blessed
[29:18] if you love the Word of God so we're
[29:22] working our way through the book of
[29:23] Revelation and we're we're here in
[29:25] revelation 17 so it's really wonderful
[29:28] you know one
[29:29] my daughter's came up laughs after last
[29:31] service and said daddy I won't tell you
[29:33] I really enjoyed service on Wednesday
[29:35] night I thought what a blessing I sure
[29:36] he didn't hear that you know and the
[29:40] little ones like that they just soak in
[29:42] these things you know and and I always
[29:44] got to remember that there's there's
[29:45] little ones here and and they need to
[29:48] hear the truth just like we need to hear
[29:49] the truth
[29:51] just like in brother Graham's day you
[29:52] know people you know the revelation of
[29:54] water baptism was so fresh all the
[29:56] doubts were all the adults were shouting
[29:58] and glorifying God and today if we're
[30:00] not careful we you know we don't really
[30:01] pull as much maybe when there's water
[30:04] baptism preaching but we got to remember
[30:06] there's some that maybe have never been
[30:08] baptized and so we need to we need to
[30:10] pull for their sake right right we need
[30:13] to get in the spirit for somebody else's
[30:15] sake amen
[30:15] so god help us here tonight we're so
[30:18] happy and thankful to serve the Lord
[30:20] Jesus
[30:20] so revelation 17 I like to start at
[30:23] verse 1 but I may skip a few verses down
[30:25] I want to start with this thought about
[30:29] John admiring this woman it's quite a
[30:34] scripture so let's start at verse 5 here
[30:37] I'll read verse 5 and then we'll all
[30:41] read verse 6 Lord willing and then I'll
[30:43] read verse 7 I want to start there and
[30:45] if you remember we've been working
[30:46] through the eleven proofs that this
[30:48] woman is Rome that this Mystery Babylon
[30:52] is Rome some some recently think you
[30:56] know it's Jerusalem but there's a couple
[30:58] of things we looked at how it does have
[31:00] some things in common but not not enough
[31:02] it's got to be every Bible requirement
[31:05] and it certainly isn't Istanbul Turkey
[31:08] like a lot of people think - although
[31:09] it's on Seven Hills it doesn't it
[31:12] doesn't even get close to all the
[31:13] requirements so it can only be Rome now
[31:16] let's read verse I'll revert verse five
[31:18] and then we'll read verse six verse five
[31:20] says and upon her forehead was a name
[31:22] written Mystery Babylon the Great the
[31:24] mother of harlots and abominations of
[31:26] the earth and I saw the woman drunken
[31:30] with the blood of the Saints and with
[31:32] the blood of the martyr I'm sorry let's
[31:34] read verse 6 together I'm sorry one two
[31:36] three and I saw the woman drunken with
[31:39] the blood of the Saints and with the
[31:41] blood of the martyrs of
[31:43] Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with
[31:46] great admiration I'll read verse seven
[31:49] here says they and the angel said unto
[31:52] me wherefore didst thou marvel I will
[31:55] tell thee the mystery of the woman and
[31:57] of the Beast that carrieth her which
[31:59] hath the seven heads and ten horns amen
[32:04] so let's just bow our heads for one more
[32:05] word of Prayer ask the Lord to help us
[32:07] your heavenly Father Lord your your the
[32:09] great one amongst us Lord where we know
[32:12] we're nothing Lord no flesh shall glory
[32:14] in your presence so father we glory in
[32:17] the cross we glory in the resurrection
[32:19] we glory that your Holy Spirit's here
[32:22] today Lord God and we're humbled by that
[32:24] for we realize that we're nothing Lord
[32:27] God but we ask Lord God that your spirit
[32:29] would come to quicken the Luas Lord and
[32:32] teach us Lord on this fresh bread of
[32:34] your word as we work in our way through
[32:36] revelation 17 Lord God anoint us and
[32:39] help us Lord God we want to draw closer
[32:41] to you Lord Jesus and we want to grow in
[32:44] grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus
[32:45] Christ Lord you said the mystery would
[32:48] be finished in this day and Lord we're
[32:50] looking at a great mystery tonight Lord
[32:52] so help us Lord may the Spirit of Truth
[32:54] and the spirit of Revelation come and
[32:57] especially to the young ones Lord even
[32:59] to the old ones give us fresh things but
[33:01] Lord even the young ones Lord just
[33:03] ingrain these truths in their heart Lord
[33:05] that they can receive truth Lord at this
[33:07] young age in Jesus Christ's name and the
[33:10] church said Amen god bless yous being
[33:12] seated praise the Lord so let's look
[33:19] here to revelation 17 I believe this is
[33:22] part three of this chapter and I want to
[33:25] continue on these thoughts here grace
[33:31] I'm gonna be jumping from I got a few
[33:34] websites I'm gonna show you in just a
[33:36] moment
[33:39] so liddy you can actually switch over
[33:41] here and I'll just have these kind of
[33:42] ready to go so that st.
[33:52] basillica but we'll get to that in just
[33:53] a moment but let's just review real
[33:56] quick last time we were gathered
[33:58] together we went through the first six
[33:59] proofs that this woman is Rome so let's
[34:04] just preview those I'll just take one
[34:05] minute and just review those the first
[34:08] proof it had to be a woman or church so
[34:11] at that point you know it could be Rome
[34:14] or Jerusalem
[34:14] it couldn't be Istanbul because Islam is
[34:19] not a church under Christ so they they
[34:22] don't claim to be married to Christ they
[34:25] don't claim to be Christ's wife so right
[34:26] away that eliminates Istanbul although
[34:29] they're on Seven Hills they meet that
[34:31] one requirement they fail on this
[34:33] requirement right here so second is the
[34:38] Catholic Church is the matter of modern
[34:40] day Babylon now Jerusalem is called
[34:44] Sodom and Babylon Jerusalem is called
[34:46] that but of course we know the Roman
[34:49] Catholic Church is as well it's called
[34:51] Babylon Peter calls for Babylon in in
[34:54] the scripture as well but we're not
[34:57] going to review all that we've been
[34:58] through that now the third is the is the
[35:02] mother of harlots now again Jerusalem is
[35:05] called harlot we looked at that quite
[35:07] length at length and read the scriptures
[35:09] from Jeremiah and Ezekiel but of course
[35:12] the Roman Catholic Church is called the
[35:14] mother they call themselves and I quote
[35:17] the Mother Church the church from which
[35:19] every church took its start what she
[35:22] means though not every church every
[35:24] daughter Church because our church
[35:27] started on the day of Pentecost hey man
[35:30] I don't know yeah we're the same church
[35:32] that Abel was a part of amen we're all
[35:36] the way we could trace it all the way
[35:37] back by God's grace amen
[35:39] we're the same church but Jerusalem
[35:43] could be called a mother church some
[35:44] people might say oh the Holy Ghost first
[35:46] fell there so they might have that one
[35:49] and she's and no doubt Jerusalem is
[35:51] called a a harlot but the next one is
[35:55] where Jerusalem falls off because number
[35:56] four is she has to sit on many waters
[35:59] which are multitudes peoples nations and
[36:02] tongues there's 1.3 billion Catholics
[36:06] and right now there's the same amount of
[36:07] Muslims the Muslims have actually caught
[36:09] up to the Catholics and now they have
[36:11] the same amount of population that's 18
[36:14] percent of the world is Roman Catholic
[36:16] almost 1/5 there's 22,000 parishes
[36:20] worldwide and in parish in nearly every
[36:23] country on Earth now compare that of
[36:26] course to the Jews there's all there's
[36:29] only about 8 million Jews in the world
[36:32] and most of them are in the US and
[36:34] Israel not around the world so it fails
[36:38] right there
[36:38] Jews are rejected at the United Nations
[36:40] Jews are mocked by every neighbor in the
[36:44] Middle East they don't sit on many
[36:46] waters they're not in many nations and
[36:49] not many tongues so right there
[36:50] Jerusalem cannot meet the requirement it
[36:53] has to be Rome amen thank God
[36:56] now fifth it sits on seven hills or
[36:59] mountains now Jerusalem meets that but
[37:01] it doesn't meet the other one
[37:02] Istanbul of course meets that but it
[37:04] doesn't mean any of the other
[37:05] requirements so it cannot be now
[37:08] Cincinnati's on seven hills I heard
[37:09] brother Graham say that today but
[37:11] there's no headquarters of any Church in
[37:13] Cincinnati
[37:14] except little local maybe
[37:16] non-denominational churches number six
[37:20] she had to be a harlot or to
[37:22] Christ now through now harlot means one
[37:28] who yields herself for defilement for
[37:31] the sake of gain and as also means a
[37:34] chief seed of idolatry
[37:36] so Jerusalem of course could meet some
[37:38] of these but because Jerusalem fails on
[37:40] the other ones
[37:41] the only one it could be is Rome because
[37:44] of her false doctrine and we looked at 7
[37:46] false doctrines last time mandatory
[37:49] clerical celibacy so the priests have to
[37:52] be celibate that's that's called a
[37:55] seducing spirit and doctrine of devil
[37:57] transubstantiation is absolute idolatry
[38:00] it brings the sacrifice of Christ
[38:03] present to every one of their mass
[38:05] services and they say that that presence
[38:08] only remains in them while that bread
[38:10] and wine is in their body so it's
[38:12] flushed out every 12 hours that's why
[38:14] they got to keep going back I'm glad the
[38:16] Holy Ghost doesn't get flushed out amen
[38:18] I'm glad weather William that the Holy
[38:20] Ghost will never get flushed out of me
[38:22] because it's a sea
[38:26] they married at that point at the day of
[38:29] my Redemption the rest of my body gets
[38:30] swallowed up in that same type of spirit
[38:33] praise God so all three parts of me will
[38:36] be filled with the Holy Ghost amen
[38:38] hallelujah so it's it's it's idolatry
[38:41] next the Pope is called the Holy Father
[38:43] that blasphemes God because Jesus is the
[38:46] only one who called God holy father and
[38:49] they're so blasphemous that they Rob God
[38:52] the Father the miserable spirit they
[38:54] robbed that title from God and they give
[38:56] it to a man who falls short of the glory
[38:58] of God
[39:00] next they kiss of the Pope's ring which
[39:03] we saw that's documented on CNN is
[39:04] documented everywhere and they bow to
[39:07] Pope's and priests that's man worship
[39:10] and that breaks the first commandment to
[39:12] bow down and give worship to any person
[39:14] next they venerate statues and images
[39:18] they justified it at the Council of
[39:20] Nicaea and 787 ad but the Bible never
[39:25] the Bible never justifies idol worship
[39:28] and there's no virtue in any statue
[39:30] right there's no or there's no venerate
[39:33] there's no reason to venerate it or kiss
[39:35] it and these statues Church have spread
[39:38] around the world you see them all
[39:39] they're all around you drive around my
[39:41] hometown you see little Mary statues or
[39:43] or st. Joseph statues or whatever
[39:46] statues it's spread around the world and
[39:48] that proves it's spread idolatry under
[39:51] all nations my next is communion of
[39:53] saints and they literally say an
[39:56] exchange of spiritual Goods takes place
[39:58] between those in Earth and those in
[39:59] purgatory or in heaven and that's wrong
[40:04] they pray they pray for the dead that
[40:07] they may be loosed from their sins but
[40:09] the Bible said the blood of Jesus Christ
[40:11] already forgives you all your trespasses
[40:14] amen and there's no condemnation to them
[40:18] that are in Christ Jesus amen
[40:21] they say run to Mary they say actually
[40:23] the word fly they say fly to Mary and
[40:25] prayer to intercede to the dead my and
[40:29] brother they asked brother Branham what
[40:31] do you think of Catholicism mother
[40:32] Graham said I wish you would not have
[40:34] asked me that but since you asked me
[40:37] it's the highest form of spiritualism
[40:39] praying to the dead in other words
[40:41] praying to demonic spirits my the last
[40:46] one we looked at was deifying Mary she
[40:49] was called the all Holy One
[40:51] she was preserved from all stain of
[40:53] original sin that's a lie she's called a
[40:57] holy one she's called she said they say
[41:00] she has a saving office so she can save
[41:02] in her heavenly office that's blasphemy
[41:05] blasphemous as well they say she's the
[41:07] Queen over all things the mother of God
[41:11] advocate helper benefactress and
[41:14] Mediatrix but the Bible said there's one
[41:16] mediator between man and God the man
[41:18] Christ Jesus now look how close that is
[41:20] they call her Queen right but that's
[41:23] wrong that she's Queen over all things
[41:25] there is a real queen
[41:27] and it's us by God's grace not by what
[41:31] we've done but what he's done he's
[41:33] chosen his own bride and he chose her in
[41:36] him before the foundation of the world
[41:38] how do you know you're in that bride
[41:40] because you obey every word that's right
[41:42] in here because the bride has to be just
[41:45] as much the word as the husband the word
[41:47] amen amen that's right that's how we
[41:50] know we're the bride word because we
[41:52] keep all the Word of God and they say
[41:58] she's the mother of God but the Bible
[42:00] said that God has no father God has no
[42:02] mother oh the word Amen the word defends
[42:06] itself hallelujah
[42:08] all right so now let's pick up now where
[42:12] we are now let's start with a few quotes
[42:20] let me start with a few quotes from
[42:21] brother Branham about how John admired
[42:24] now look he admired Church now now
[42:27] imagine him imagine John in on the Isle
[42:32] of Patmos right it's just a real small
[42:33] islands kind of like Alcatraz right we
[42:36] say where it's just it's it's a I think
[42:38] it was how many miles think it was ten
[42:39] miles off off the coast land but imagine
[42:42] John being there but man said there were
[42:43] serpents and scorpions and he was just
[42:45] basically trying to live for his life
[42:46] and when he gets caught up in this
[42:48] vision he sees something like this and
[42:52] he sees the the priests all carrying the
[42:54] flags and they're all and they're all
[42:57] walking like this in procession and he's
[42:59] all these worshippers thousands upon
[43:01] thousands and he sees golden cups being
[43:04] raised and he says in he sees priests
[43:06] and these beautiful garments and there
[43:08] are you know there are worshiping and
[43:10] the Bible said John wondered with great
[43:13] admiration now you talk to any Catholic
[43:17] what's one reason they love Catholic is
[43:19] because they had they feel a spirit of
[43:21] reverence when they go to a church right
[43:25] same thing happens to me I went to a
[43:27] Catholic funeral this year I walked in
[43:29] there and I'm just like breath Tate I
[43:31] just lose my breath because all the
[43:32] beautiful artwork and the colors you
[43:34] know and and it's just and then the high
[43:37] ceilings you we're just so used to
[43:39] common buildings that when you walk in
[43:41] the place like that it just takes your
[43:43] breath away because it's physically
[43:45] beauty oh but that's what Cain had he
[43:47] had a more beautiful sacrifice and God's
[43:50] not interested in the Sutton in any
[43:52] sacrifice he wants a specific sacrifice
[43:55] so no doubt John brother Aaron would
[43:58] look at that picture there sorry and he
[44:01] would wonder and he say ma look at this
[44:03] beautiful building this is st. Peter's
[44:06] Basilica
[44:07] now the Catechism says when he sits on
[44:09] that seat and he speaks with authority
[44:13] they say he's infallible when he speaks
[44:15] from that seat I don't know if that
[44:17] seats out here or if it's inside but
[44:19] they said there's a seat in Saint
[44:21] Peter's Basilica and when he speaks from
[44:23] there it's infallible now what a
[44:25] perversion what a perversion because
[44:28] there is such a thing
[44:32] properly speaking with infallible you
[44:36] see that's why it's so close it would to
[44:38] see the very light if it were possible
[44:39] see that they caught like queen like we
[44:42] just said that's so close there is a
[44:44] queen in heaven but she's not Queen over
[44:46] all things amen
[44:48] there is a queen she's a blood ball
[44:50] queen amen
[44:52] she's a queen that rules because they
[44:53] were her godly character that she got
[44:56] from her husband amen
[44:57] and there is such a thing as
[45:00] infallibility in a man but it only comes
[45:03] with dust sayeth the Lord glory they
[45:08] don't come from sitting on a special
[45:09] chair it don't come from anything
[45:11] physical it comes from something
[45:12] spiritual the anointing and leadership
[45:14] of the Holy Ghost the inspiration from
[45:16] God Almighty hallelujah see what a
[45:21] perversion and no no doubt he look and
[45:23] remem I'm quoting from The True Vine in
[45:25] the false fire 1955 he said it's not a
[45:28] communistic anti God affair it's a
[45:31] religious spirit John saw in Revelations
[45:36] and he wondered with great admiration
[45:38] how it set like the Church of the Living
[45:41] God and so forth and yet in the it was
[45:43] found the blood of every martyr that had
[45:45] ever been killed for the Lord Jesus my
[45:47] so John looks at this in the ether smile
[45:49] what a beautiful gathering this looks
[45:51] beautiful I want to just share this if I
[45:56] can real quick I hope I got this okay I
[45:58] preached this a couple years ago but
[46:01] remember there's two sides right there's
[46:02] good spirits there's the Holy Spirit
[46:04] right and then there's I shouldn't say
[46:05] good spirits there's one good spirit and
[46:07] then there's all these evil demon
[46:08] spirits right but have said it won't be
[46:11] a communist experience oh sorry won't be
[46:13] communism it'll be a religious demon now
[46:16] these are exact quotes brother Graham
[46:18] said the spirit of unbelief is the chief
[46:20] of all Devils you can look it up why
[46:23] because when you wear someone's soul the
[46:26] greatest demon is unbelief to pull you
[46:28] to hell right and that's the demon that
[46:32] conquers people's faith right because
[46:35] it's either faith or unbelief right it's
[46:37] one or the other
[46:37] and so the greatest demon of all is
[46:41] unbelief we might call it the Antichrist
[46:44] spirit
[46:45] but in the scripture the Bible said the
[46:47] soul that doesn't believe it shall die
[46:50] so it's like the Antichrist spirit as
[46:53] far as I understand now under this you
[46:56] have other quotes from brother Branham
[46:57] he says the religious spirit is the
[47:00] worst demon to deal with and that's its
[47:02] truth
[47:03] it ain't the sinner ain't the harlot
[47:06] spirit ain't the drug-addict spirit it's
[47:08] that religious one like the Pharisees
[47:12] liked the Sadducees like we are born of
[47:14] Abraham seed we're born to the message
[47:16] we're greater than you what do you how
[47:17] can you teach us anything help us to be
[47:20] humble Lord God that we can always learn
[47:22] something from the Holy Spirit that's
[47:25] the worst one to deal with and now it's
[47:28] been opening up to me lately that that
[47:31] they knew Jesus was the Christ those
[47:34] Pharisees they knew it member Nicodemus
[47:37] he went and said we know you're a
[47:39] teacher sent from God a member in mark
[47:42] chapter 2 if you read mark chapter when
[47:44] I was reading it this week in mark 1
[47:46] Jesus does all these miracles and the
[47:48] Bible said his fame spread all
[47:50] throughout Judea and Galilee everybody
[47:52] knew him everybody knew that this was
[47:55] the Christ and then he came to Simon
[47:57] Peters house and let down that man with
[47:59] palsy right and Jesus said I forgive you
[48:03] and the Bible said those chief priests
[48:06] reasoned themselves how can he forgive
[48:08] sin how can he forgive sin and Jesus
[48:10] rebukes them he said why do you reason
[48:13] in your hearts now how could Jesus
[48:15] rebuked them if for him forgiving sins
[48:20] the only way he could rebuke them and
[48:22] there's the Bible said they were scribes
[48:24] they knew the scripture the only way he
[48:27] could rebuke them for him forgiving sins
[48:29] a man forgiving sins is if they already
[48:32] believed he was the Messiah and they
[48:34] knew the scripture of what the scripture
[48:36] said about the Messiah and Isaiah 7:14
[48:39] 9:6 said he shall be called wonderful
[48:42] counselor the mighty God the everlasting
[48:45] father amen so that's the reason Jesus
[48:48] could rebuke them and say why do you
[48:50] reason your hearts isn't it easier for
[48:52] me to say receive your healing he said
[48:55] but that you
[48:56] that the son of man has power to forgive
[48:58] sins he said take up your bed and walk
[49:01] amen
[49:02] oh yeah raise God and what was he doing
[49:06] he was reed eel with that worse demon
[49:08] the critical spirit see that's been
[49:12] opening to me lately like they knew the
[49:15] scripture about him and they knew that
[49:17] he was something he needed when they
[49:19] knew he was sent from God just like
[49:22] Satan knew he said those demons do he
[49:25] said we know you're that Holy One of
[49:26] Israel they knew he was the Holy One but
[49:29] they didn't know he had to die to be
[49:31] resurrected a man didn't know that
[49:34] praise God it was hidden in one half of
[49:37] a scripture in Psalm 16 but where was a
[49:42] hidden motive just David hid it David
[49:44] hid and said my soul he will and it will
[49:47] be left in hell and my body won't see
[49:49] corruption amen and Satan knew that
[49:52] Scripture but he didn't know the
[49:54] interpretation of it amen so the Bible
[49:57] said that Satan anointed the kings of
[49:58] men of the earth to crucify him but they
[50:01] would not have crucified him had they
[50:02] known that through death he would defeat
[50:05] death amen hallelujah and so here's what
[50:12] we have we have this John wondering at
[50:15] this woman now let me let me just finish
[50:17] with here relevant said nervousness is
[50:19] the worst feeling you could have anyone
[50:21] could ever have he said a nervousness
[50:24] and distress is the worst feeling you
[50:27] can have isn't it Church if you're
[50:31] unsure if you're safe you're unsure you
[50:33] got the Holy Ghost you're unsure you're
[50:35] worried about something and you're so
[50:36] nervous about it you just feel like
[50:39] you're you're shaky unstable that's
[50:41] exact quote quote hide those words and
[50:43] the worst feeling anyone could have
[50:45] nervousness so when we come to church
[50:47] say God call my heart and we should pray
[50:50] and say God give me the peace that
[50:52] passes all understanding the Bible said
[50:54] if you just make your requests made
[50:56] known unto God the peace of God will
[50:59] keep your hearts and minds through
[51:00] Christ Jesus amen
[51:02] that's the glory of just coming to
[51:04] church in a hard week or when you're
[51:05] upset you're nervous you come to church
[51:08] and you're
[51:08] your burdens here you leave him here at
[51:10] the altar and know that God will take
[51:12] care of it amen his time and his season
[51:15] but we shouldn't be nervous because
[51:17] that's the worst feeling you could
[51:19] possibly have
[51:20] doesn't James say that a man that's
[51:22] tossed about
[51:23] he has no confidence to receive anything
[51:25] from God there is great power when
[51:27] people walk out of here or walk out of
[51:29] any church service by the Rays Church
[51:31] wherever there's great power when people
[51:33] say you know what I had a burden but I
[51:35] gave it to the Lord I'm committing it in
[51:37] God's hands
[51:38] oh there's strength in that amen
[51:41] there's peace and that there's victory
[51:43] in that we must commit it unto God
[51:45] brother says the power of committal is
[51:47] such a powerful thing
[51:49] see what is it because you cast down the
[51:51] demon of nervousness and God brings his
[51:53] peace that passes all understanding amen
[51:58] then brother have said about fear he
[52:00] said fear accompanies doubt the greatest
[52:02] thing he said that's the greatest thing
[52:04] against the church is fear so most of us
[52:06] church we're not gonna battle that one
[52:08] right if you're saved you're not gonna
[52:09] battle that one so much one you're gonna
[52:11] battle you and I fear all right we're
[52:16] scared what's gonna happen next
[52:18] it's my family going to be okay is God
[52:20] gonna provide for me we're scared we're
[52:23] nervous remember that's the greatest
[52:25] thing against the church he also said it
[52:28] was the greatest thing against the Old
[52:29] Testament Saints and that's why I got
[52:31] into your Christ had to go down to hell
[52:33] take the keys of death and raise them up
[52:36] and make a whistle-stop in Jerusalem to
[52:38] let them know there's normal reason to
[52:40] fear death you won't be in the heart of
[52:42] the earth you're going up to heaven to
[52:44] paradise amen
[52:45] I don't know about have said in Paradise
[52:49] the Witch of Endor could call people up
[52:52] he could call spirits up because there
[52:53] was no blood to protect them amen but in
[52:56] heaven you've got the blood of Jesus
[52:58] Christ to protect you amen and Satan
[53:00] can't access those souls he can't bring
[53:03] down Souls because the blood of Jesus
[53:05] Christ is your protection right now
[53:07] beware and always will be your
[53:09] protection amen hallelujah
[53:12] just like brother man prayed with the
[53:14] blood of Jesus Christ between you and
[53:15] your sickness put the blood of Jesus
[53:18] Christ between you and the devil always
[53:20] put it right between there the
[53:21] in Christ the Spirit of Christ is your
[53:24] protection amen
[53:28] thank the Lord
[53:30] now that's just for reference I came to
[53:32] me as I was preparing I was like I'd
[53:34] like to show that again so everybody can
[53:35] catch that throughout the week you're
[53:38] gonna battle it through out through your
[53:39] life you're gonna battle fear most did
[53:41] it or Satan will try to get you to thing
[53:43] all you can never be redeemed you know
[53:46] you know God will never answer your
[53:48] prayer you know no you shouldn't speak
[53:50] God's Word it's not the time in season
[53:52] you know how that dirty that devil is he
[53:56] tries to put spirits of fear on people
[53:58] but we got to have the spirit of faith
[54:01] amen
[54:02] the spirit of love because the Bible
[54:04] said faith works by love so we got to
[54:05] pray and get worshiping it so in love
[54:08] with Jesus that faith can start working
[54:10] by the love of God in our hearts amen
[54:13] let's go back there but Rahab said he
[54:17] wondered with great admiration now I
[54:20] want to read two more because I was
[54:22] looking at these earlier I want to read
[54:23] two more and why are we not a
[54:26] denomination he's John wondered with
[54:30] great admiration it was a Marvel thing
[54:32] about her how that I wondered he said
[54:34] let me just take John's place a bit and
[54:37] try to open it up a little bit see so
[54:40] he's gonna take John's place for the RAM
[54:42] said John said there she sits
[54:47] she's pertaining to be a Christian
[54:50] Church so John's looking
[54:51] oh she's claiming to be a Christian
[54:54] Church he said she's got all the access
[54:59] to the monies of the world now John
[55:01] would he would've never seen great
[55:03] things like buildings like this in his
[55:05] day there was nice buildings but nothing
[55:07] like this and so John immediately
[55:10] wonders with admiration while the church
[55:13] is rich now
[55:14] the church has so much backing she's got
[55:17] all kinds of money but Ram said John
[55:20] said she's got the kings of the earth at
[55:22] her feet right because he saw the vision
[55:25] all the kings of the earth wandered
[55:27] after her right he said she's a
[55:32] and colorful thing and how can she be
[55:35] brought drunk with the martyrs of Jesus
[55:38] how can she persecute the Saints how can
[55:41] she kill those martyrs of Christ and yet
[55:43] she's claiming to be a Christian herself
[55:45] a Christian Church all right now I want
[55:53] to skip down here remember on the first
[55:55] sermon we preached what was the
[55:57] requirement to recognize the Mystery
[56:02] Babylon anyone remember what's that
[56:03] spiritual gift Lydia wisdom wisdom
[56:06] that's right wisdom is the gift you have
[56:09] to have in order to not be deceived now
[56:15] one of them mentions this is why we're
[56:17] not a denomination he says how many
[56:20] knows that wisdom is one of the gifts of
[56:22] the Spirit now what kind of group then
[56:25] is he talking to where he says you might
[56:28] you need wisdom to recognize that the
[56:29] number of the beast right and you'd
[56:31] wisdom to recognize as she sits on seven
[56:34] hills but I said what kind of group is
[56:36] he talking to he must be talking to a
[56:39] group of people that has the gifts of
[56:42] the Spirit operating in the church amen
[56:44] huh Larry if we've got wisdom to know
[56:49] that it's role who sits on seven hills
[56:51] and let me tell you we've got the gifts
[56:53] of the Spirit operating in this church
[56:54] ain't matter I bowed and said it takes
[56:58] the gift of wisdom to recognize her he
[57:02] said now you stop find that all through
[57:04] these church ages here how those gifts
[57:07] to be working in the last day now we got
[57:09] gifts of healing working it's going good
[57:11] well brother there's other gifts oh
[57:13] brother have says people are emphasizing
[57:15] healing so much
[57:16] he said we got other gifts than that so
[57:19] we need a balance right we got to
[57:20] emphasize all nine the same way but
[57:24] remember wisdom gets a little bit higher
[57:26] emphasis because brother have said
[57:28] wisdom governs all other eight gifts
[57:32] right that's what he said he said see
[57:37] that just one of them that's just a
[57:38] little minor thing well here's a far
[57:39] greater gift here which would be the
[57:42] best road ram says the gift of Holy
[57:44] Ghost the wisdom to
[57:46] put the word together and the show of
[57:48] the church where we're standing or just
[57:51] somebody getting healed ain't had which
[57:54] is greater healed in your body or to
[57:57] know where you're standing in God's
[57:59] sight amen which is greater Burris and
[58:02] wisdom is the greater gift and they go
[58:06] for healings I thank God when people get
[58:07] healed we rejoice in that but Bernard
[58:10] said which is greater he said we all
[58:12] want to be well but I'd rather had my
[58:14] soul well than my body well anytime in
[58:22] that beautiful church and he says that
[58:26] in a number of places I don't have a
[58:28] mall in front of me I preached that
[58:29] years ago when I preached when te6
[58:30] sermons on gifts of the Spirit back in
[58:32] 2012 looking through him today that's
[58:34] how I know because I was looking for
[58:35] different scriptures and quotes I can't
[58:38] remember all those but see it's so
[58:41] important and that's why the Holy Spirit
[58:43] said wisdom to know she sits on seven
[58:47] hills and John wonders with great
[58:50] admiration
[58:50] let me read one more from the first seal
[58:52] how many member brother BAM says this in
[58:54] the first in the first seal he said
[58:56] where this prostitute of revelation 17
[58:57] she was the mystery Mystery Babylon the
[59:00] mother of harlots and John admired her
[59:02] now look wouldn't you I've talked to
[59:05] message people and they said they had
[59:07] they were amazed they've gone there and
[59:09] they've they've admired just the
[59:10] physical structure of things and we can
[59:13] do that as humans we could a mile out
[59:14] these men and women or whoever built it
[59:16] they did a fantastic job in our hearts
[59:20] we think if only this could be a real
[59:22] place of worship
[59:23] right and we admire that and so look but
[59:28] James look brother J or mother John
[59:30] looks at this and he admires it now the
[59:32] sad part is you can't see it from here
[59:33] but these are all statues of saints up
[59:35] here now that's where it's evil these
[59:39] are all statues of saints so they're
[59:41] surrounded by demons right that's
[59:42] basically they're saying they're
[59:44] surrounded by demons and idolatry so all
[59:47] those demons like those demons are
[59:48] looking down into them right there just
[59:50] surrounded by the demons thank God we're
[59:53] not surrounded by demons we're
[59:54] surrounded by angels amen
[59:57] because angels in camp though
[59:59] that fear of the Lord Amen but Berlin
[1:00:03] said John admired her look wait we get
[1:00:06] here and watch him watching this horse
[1:00:08] here see course horse she's talked about
[1:00:09] the first seal what happened was this he
[1:00:11] admired her with great admiration but
[1:00:16] the mystery who was she drank the blood
[1:00:18] of the martyrs of Christ as beautiful as
[1:00:22] she looked so John masa saw in this
[1:00:24] state but before this state she was
[1:00:27] drinking the blood of the martyrs he
[1:00:31] said a beautiful church set their
[1:00:33] programs I'm still quoting later have
[1:00:34] decked in purple and gold and she had a
[1:00:37] cup in her hand of the filthiness of her
[1:00:39] fornication
[1:00:42] what is fornications her unrighteous
[1:00:45] living that's that's the doctrine she
[1:00:47] was given out and I just did seven
[1:00:48] doctrines there's hundreds and I don't
[1:00:52] want to invest more time because I
[1:00:53] thought these are the major ones my
[1:00:54] Fenny buddy if anybody can't see these
[1:00:55] there's no light in you at all worship
[1:00:58] and marry and praying to dead people all
[1:01:00] kinds of trash calling the Pope Holy
[1:01:02] Father trash like that that's so sad
[1:01:06] alright Hail Marys all kinds of stuff
[1:01:09] now so the next the next proof and this
[1:01:13] is something I'm just gonna look up and
[1:01:14] I'm just pray the Lord gives me grace
[1:01:21] so the next
[1:01:24] in revelation 17:4 now here's what I put
[1:01:29] in my next book it's not out yet but
[1:01:30] it'll be out maybe next year the next
[1:01:33] proof is number seven
[1:01:35] the mother holiday is arrayed in purple
[1:01:37] and scarlet all's I did was type in Pope
[1:01:41] purple red and look at this church I'm
[1:01:44] not gonna scroll down because there you
[1:01:45] know with Google searches there may be
[1:01:47] things down there that are evil and
[1:01:48] immoral but I knew for sure the first
[1:01:50] page is okay because I checked I checked
[1:01:55] now the Catholic websites all say it's
[1:01:59] common to see priests are spaceships and
[1:02:01] the Pope frequently arrayed in these
[1:02:03] colors based upon annual festivals holy
[1:02:06] days and seasons of the church year you
[1:02:11] ever see Muslims dressed up like that
[1:02:13] they'll never see the Jewish well Jewish
[1:02:16] they only have a temple so you can't see
[1:02:18] them dressed up like that so there's
[1:02:20] another one the only one that fits is
[1:02:22] the mother harlot now let me read you
[1:02:25] here's the reasons they do it so green
[1:02:30] is they priests wear for mass as an
[1:02:35] ordinary time green symbolizes hope in
[1:02:37] life why is used for a number of feast
[1:02:40] days including the feasts of the Lord
[1:02:42] Mary and the Saints who are not martyrs
[1:02:45] and angels it's used during the scenes
[1:02:47] of Christmas and Easter symbolizes joy
[1:02:50] light and purity viola is used during
[1:02:54] the scenes of pettite penitence Advent
[1:02:57] and Lent also used for masses for the
[1:02:59] dead and that crave my goodness they're
[1:03:02] still trying to forgive sins after
[1:03:03] people die represents penance and
[1:03:06] morning sometimes blues used instead of
[1:03:09] violet to symbolize the penitential
[1:03:12] nature of Advent so that's the birth of
[1:03:15] Christ the advent of Christ and red
[1:03:17] represents the Holy Spirit suffering
[1:03:19] priests wear red vestments on Pentecost
[1:03:22] and confirmations but also on feasts of
[1:03:24] suffering such as Feast of the Lord's
[1:03:26] passion and peace the marks now why do I
[1:03:28] say all that because this is just that
[1:03:30] see they're just trying to impersonate
[1:03:32] what you've already got you've got one
[1:03:35] closing you're already wearing and it
[1:03:37] the white righteousness of Jesus Christ
[1:03:39] amen
[1:03:41] Jesus told the church age he said walk
[1:03:44] before me in white amen how do they up
[1:03:47] there just trying to impersonate this
[1:03:49] but we're already dressing right and
[1:03:52] we've got the real code doesn't matter
[1:03:53] what colors we have on now God's looking
[1:03:55] at the soul the soul of man must not be
[1:03:58] crimson red by sin
[1:04:00] it must be what the forgiveness of
[1:04:02] Christ see it's a promotion but who's
[1:04:07] wearing purple and scarlet children
[1:04:10] who's wearing that your dad doesn't wear
[1:04:13] that usually not every now and then but
[1:04:15] they wear it all year round and they got
[1:04:18] gold and your dad doesn't wear a gold
[1:04:20] crown I'll tell you that
[1:04:22] I will in heaven but now right now but
[1:04:25] even in heaven it just being for a short
[1:04:26] time because I'm gonna throw it at Jesus
[1:04:27] feet
[1:04:28] I could have earned this without you
[1:04:32] lord I just lay it right there but see
[1:04:36] they're hyper Alessa they're having
[1:04:38] their millennium right now but ours is
[1:04:39] later hey that's okay I'll take my later
[1:04:42] amen
[1:04:43] I'm passing the test right now I'm
[1:04:45] trying to get straight A's amen
[1:04:47] pass the test now the next one this
[1:04:50] one's striking too okay
[1:04:53] number eight the Bible said revelation
[1:04:55] 17:8 she's the wealthy church deck with
[1:04:58] gold precious stones and pearls having a
[1:05:01] golden cup in her hand full of
[1:05:02] abominations and the filthiness of her
[1:05:04] fornication now in 2015 after the Pope
[1:05:11] got elected he was on the cover of Time
[1:05:13] remember and on the cover he's holding
[1:05:16] these golden jewel covered I got a
[1:05:19] picture of my I don't have it there for
[1:05:20] you guys to see but I got it on my home
[1:05:22] computer and if you look on the inside
[1:05:24] all the pictures have gold and jewels
[1:05:27] all over it
[1:05:28] so all of their instruments and tools
[1:05:31] that they use are all gold and diamonds
[1:05:32] and jewels and all kinds of things like
[1:05:35] that but one thing I've never quite
[1:05:38] understood but I'm finally starting to
[1:05:40] get understanding of is how the Catholic
[1:05:42] Church is so wealthy I've always kind of
[1:05:45] struggle with this but
[1:05:47] I went to the Britannic and the
[1:05:49] Britannica says the Vatican receives
[1:05:51] freewill donations from more than 1
[1:05:53] million Catholics worldwide they also
[1:05:58] earn interest on their financial
[1:06:00] investments which this is about will
[1:06:02] reduce in just a moment do they earn
[1:06:04] interest they invest in things and they
[1:06:07] have flocks of tourists and visitors to
[1:06:10] its museums galleries and libraries
[1:06:12] which hold priceless collections right
[1:06:14] maket Michelangelo's art Leonardo's art
[1:06:17] it's priceless you can't put a price tag
[1:06:19] on that
[1:06:23] now let's this article I just found this
[1:06:25] today I was thinking Lord just help me
[1:06:27] so I just typed in Vatican and money and
[1:06:30] it came up now this is from 2015
[1:06:32] actually so here's five facts and look
[1:06:37] at this this was in 2015 it has eight
[1:06:40] billion dollars in assets now this is
[1:06:44] striking look at this church the Vatican
[1:06:46] Bank has about 8 million in assets and
[1:06:49] look it's this is CNN now this is the
[1:06:52] most liberal biased you source on earth
[1:06:56] and they're saying it's often the bank
[1:07:01] in Vatican the Vatican Bank is always at
[1:07:03] the center of scandals and corruption
[1:07:06] since it started in 1942 not sometimes
[1:07:11] always it's always at the center of all
[1:07:15] these financial scandals
[1:07:17] that's that Vatican Bank well why don't
[1:07:19] they shut it down because they can't
[1:07:21] because the Vatican's the boss and who
[1:07:25] can make war against that woman who's
[1:07:28] going to make war against that beast not
[1:07:29] the nation of Italy not that weak little
[1:07:32] government of Italy that big iron tooth
[1:07:34] beast is going to tell Italy what to do
[1:07:37] right Church now they say they're gonna
[1:07:41] clean it up that's nonsense they haven't
[1:07:43] cleaned it up according to Scripture now
[1:07:45] scripture says they won't clean it up
[1:07:46] now it says now here's here's how it
[1:07:50] gets its money they have they have
[1:07:52] thirty three thousand accounts but many
[1:07:55] of these are awarded to powerful Italian
[1:07:58] officials looking this
[1:08:00] - money without paying taxes so they'll
[1:08:04] make deals in their business and instead
[1:08:06] of putting in the bank and saving it
[1:08:08] investments because later when they want
[1:08:10] to get it back they've got to pay
[1:08:11] interest on it and taxes that take it
[1:08:13] out of the bank
[1:08:14] so they don't put it in the regular
[1:08:15] banks they put it in the Vatican Bank
[1:08:17] and they take their money and they give
[1:08:20] it brother William - they're kind no
[1:08:22] priest ah they take their money give it
[1:08:28] there because they put it under some
[1:08:29] false name well I can access this I'll
[1:08:31] just pay off the tellers I'll just pay
[1:08:33] this off and I can go get my money later
[1:08:35] and it'll make all this interest and I
[1:08:37] want to pay any taxes on it eight
[1:08:39] billion dollars in 2015 they close 4,000
[1:08:44] accounts but I wonder how many got now
[1:08:46] right because the stock markets booming
[1:08:49] booming now this was just saying it has
[1:09:01] over 1.1 billion off its balance sheet
[1:09:04] so it kind of cleaned up I'm not going
[1:09:06] to spend much time on that one they ran
[1:09:07] out the Sistine Chapel so the Porsche
[1:09:12] the 40 Porsche group paid almost 6,000
[1:09:14] just to have like a little meeting there
[1:09:16] so they ran it out kind of to make money
[1:09:19] look at thatmy and to make somebody a
[1:09:25] saint they had to raise over a quarter
[1:09:26] million dollars just to make somebody a
[1:09:28] saint and now Michael brother Graham
[1:09:33] said brother Graham said they said do
[1:09:35] you believe in the Saints and RAM said
[1:09:37] yes Saints are their Saints when they're
[1:09:39] alive I do believe in Saints while
[1:09:40] they're alive
[1:09:42] they're Saints cuz Paul wrote to the
[1:09:44] Saints that are in Ephesus and he wasn't
[1:09:46] writing to dead people
[1:09:47] he was writing to living people and then
[1:09:50] tourism is tripled and they make all
[1:09:53] kinds of money that 20 million visitors
[1:09:55] a year and they're all paying money to
[1:09:57] get on like one tour cost about $80 per
[1:10:00] person to go on one tour under it I
[1:10:02] think all the family members and think
[1:10:04] of all the money they're making there
[1:10:07] now let's
[1:10:08] revelation 18 now somehow this and this
[1:10:13] is what I'm waiting for for more
[1:10:14] understanding from the Holy Spirit and
[1:10:16] perhaps God will give it to me you know
[1:10:18] at some point but go to Revelation 18 11
[1:10:21] the merchants of the earth so they have
[1:10:23] all this money they have all this money
[1:10:25] from Italian people maybe and maybe they
[1:10:29] have it from other people too but at
[1:10:30] least this article just says Italian
[1:10:32] officials
[1:10:32] maybe it's worldwide officials I don't
[1:10:35] know I imagine they would because it
[1:10:37] could maybe be all electronic but look
[1:10:40] at verse 11 after Babylon is destroyed
[1:10:44] of merchants of the earth weep and cry
[1:10:48] over the Roman Catholic Church that's
[1:10:52] that's what I just have a I have a
[1:10:54] little question about that I'd like to
[1:10:56] know more about that so I'd like to know
[1:10:59] how is the Vatican Bank connected to all
[1:11:01] the merchants now is it connected to
[1:11:04] Amazon brother how's it connected to
[1:11:06] Walmart and Target how is it that's what
[1:11:09] I want to know so I'm trusting the Holy
[1:11:10] Spirit will reveal that to me at some
[1:11:12] point who the verse 11 and the merchants
[1:11:14] of the earth shall weep and mourn over
[1:11:16] her for no man buyeth their merchandise
[1:11:18] anymore so how is that possible how is
[1:11:22] all merchandise possible through the
[1:11:24] Vatican Bank or through the Vatican I
[1:11:26] don't know I don't have an answer for
[1:11:28] that that's why I liked how to answer
[1:11:30] for now look here's the merchandise
[1:11:33] verse 12 the merchandise of gold silver
[1:11:36] now we know where they have a lot of
[1:11:37] these metals they're in their possession
[1:11:40] precious stones of pearls fine linens
[1:11:43] and I are getting too close right linen
[1:11:45] clothes or sheets or blankets and purple
[1:11:50] and silk and scarlet and all thyine wood
[1:11:54] and all manner of vessels of ivory so
[1:11:57] even into ivory and all manner of most
[1:12:01] precious wood and brass iron and marble
[1:12:03] and cinnamon now you're getting into
[1:12:04] food products odors and ointments and
[1:12:08] frankincense and wine and oil now we
[1:12:12] know there's a lot of vineyards in in
[1:12:14] Italy they're known for their wine right
[1:12:16] they're known for their oils that the
[1:12:19] olive oils and everything out of the
[1:12:21] Italy it's very famous for that how is
[1:12:24] all that connected to the Vatican that's
[1:12:26] my question is it because all those
[1:12:28] people that own it do they all put their
[1:12:30] money in the Vatican Bank maybe maybe
[1:12:34] that seems like the best answer I have
[1:12:36] right now
[1:12:36] if anybody has any other information on
[1:12:38] that let me know so I can nail it down I
[1:12:40] want to put in this book before it comes
[1:12:42] out by God's grace so that anybody who's
[1:12:44] hungry can receive the Word of God yeah
[1:12:50] yeah might be right - yeah yeah at some
[1:12:55] point it will no kid Wow Wow
[1:13:06] I'd like to see that let's try to find
[1:13:08] some articles on that that'd be pretty
[1:13:09] powerful because I have to have an
[1:13:11] article to reference before I put in the
[1:13:13] book you know just cuz it gives you some
[1:13:15] validity but I believe that you know
[1:13:16] like let's say they're Catholic let's
[1:13:19] say they're Catholic then they would
[1:13:20] probably would tithe and give offerings
[1:13:22] based on their business and that'd be
[1:13:23] millions and millions of dollars that
[1:13:26] would be pretty striking but see they're
[1:13:28] crying after the Vatican's the story
[1:13:30] that means the bank is destroyed because
[1:13:31] remember everything the Vatican owns is
[1:13:33] right there in their little city they
[1:13:35] have a pharmacy an observatory they got
[1:13:38] their own everything from Bank they got
[1:13:40] their everything train system you know
[1:13:42] they got they got it it's just a city
[1:13:45] state that's one of our next proofs to
[1:13:48] look at so can everybody understand that
[1:13:50] by God's grace children is that helpful
[1:13:53] all right children okay let me just pull
[1:13:56] this picture back ups and everybody can
[1:13:58] just we'll just leave that as a visual I
[1:14:00] think that's my last one that one to
[1:14:02] show up I'll just leave it up there let
[1:14:03] me go a little bit longer here we go
[1:14:05] about 15 more minutes by God's grace
[1:14:06] number nine so we're going to 11 number
[1:14:10] nine
[1:14:11] the Catholic Church is drunken with the
[1:14:13] blood of the saints now I looked it up
[1:14:14] in the Britannica and it says Protestant
[1:14:17] historians this isn't a biased
[1:14:20] apparently unbiased source they said
[1:14:22] Protestant historians record medieval
[1:14:25] Roman Church practices in the most
[1:14:28] negative terms so proud
[1:14:33] like Luther's they look back at Catholic
[1:14:35] history and they say I can't say
[1:14:37] anything more negative about the Roman
[1:14:38] Catholic Church it's so evil I describe
[1:14:41] it in the most negative terms now what's
[1:14:45] sad is they don't even list it on the
[1:14:46] Britannica see they just kind of brush
[1:14:48] it over and say yeah they did some evil
[1:14:50] things but now they're a great Church
[1:14:53] nonsense
[1:14:56] yeah that's right
[1:14:58] and he said the Protestant historians
[1:15:01] recall the massive corruption of
[1:15:03] Catholic Church leaders including
[1:15:05] adultery's that are already documented
[1:15:09] by Pope's bribes extravagant papal art
[1:15:13] and architecture projects but they say
[1:15:16] worst of all is wars of conquest Wars
[1:15:19] the Pope's issued many Wars and killed
[1:15:22] millions of people and you know Samuel
[1:15:25] Schmucker wrote the glorious Reformation
[1:15:27] and wrote that 50 I'm sorry 68 million
[1:15:31] Christians were killed by the Roman
[1:15:33] Catholic Church because they dissented
[1:15:35] from her teachings and this was possible
[1:15:38] through the Catholic Inquisition and the
[1:15:40] Crusades because they they killed anyone
[1:15:45] they considered a heretic who would not
[1:15:48] bow to their teachings and this is the
[1:15:53] historic undeniable example of the Roman
[1:15:57] Church being drunk with the blood of the
[1:15:58] saints so John sees this beautiful
[1:16:00] building brothers but then he sees the
[1:16:03] woman drinking the blood of the saints
[1:16:05] yet so beautiful
[1:16:08] remember it can't be anyone else it has
[1:16:10] to be it has to be the Roman Church it
[1:16:13] can't be a Muslim
[1:16:14] it can't be Jew it's got to be a
[1:16:16] Christian Church a Mother Church it has
[1:16:18] to be Rome amen no one else even meets
[1:16:22] five of these requirements I think I'm
[1:16:25] sorry Jerusalem meets four I believe if
[1:16:27] I'm not mistaken all right the next one
[1:16:29] I touch on this earlier number 10
[1:16:31] revelation seventeen eighteen said
[1:16:33] Mystery Babylon is that great city which
[1:16:35] reigneth over the kings of the earth
[1:16:39] now the VAT
[1:16:41] is the epitome of city state it's the
[1:16:45] epitome it's the very definition of
[1:16:48] church and state United it's this
[1:16:53] world's smallest fully independent
[1:16:54] nation state it operates tax-free in
[1:16:58] Italy has its own televisions I'm sorry
[1:17:01] telephone station or telephone system
[1:17:03] rather post office garden astronomical
[1:17:07] observatory radio station banking system
[1:17:10] pharmacy and it also has a contingent of
[1:17:14] Swiss Guards who are in charge of the
[1:17:17] personal safety of the Pope since 1506
[1:17:19] they got their own guard system to
[1:17:22] protect the Pope thank God we got the
[1:17:25] guard system of the Holy Angels amen
[1:17:27] hallelujah now anyone who knows history
[1:17:33] knows that Pope's Pope the Pope's
[1:17:35] controlled church and state during the
[1:17:37] Dark Ages now it started there power
[1:17:40] started to wane around 16 and 17 1900 I
[1:17:43] found an article online and it says that
[1:17:46] in 1804 Napoleon Bonaparte was getting
[1:17:51] knighted
[1:17:52] but he did something totally unheard of
[1:17:55] instead of Ted letting the Pope put the
[1:17:58] crown on his head he walked up there and
[1:18:00] snatched the crown from the Pope and
[1:18:02] then he handed one to put one on his
[1:18:05] wife and he put one on himself and that
[1:18:08] was showing how the power was weakening
[1:18:11] the power of the Catholic Church over
[1:18:13] the state was weakening but it still had
[1:18:17] power over her but the physical power
[1:18:20] was coming to an end in fact I found
[1:18:23] this online - Pope John Paul the second
[1:18:27] he was Pope in the 70s and 80s and 90s
[1:18:29] if I remember him he is credited by the
[1:18:34] former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
[1:18:37] as the one who helped end the Cold War
[1:18:41] between Russia and the US this this
[1:18:45] Russian Soviet leader now they're going
[1:18:48] to destroy them the cat the Vatican so
[1:18:49] this is totally crazy
[1:18:51] Rush's thus saith the Lord Russia's
[1:18:54] gonna drop a bomb and destroy the
[1:18:55] Vatican at one hour thus saith the Lord
[1:18:57] that's what my man said but the former
[1:19:00] leader said the Pope is responsible for
[1:19:03] breaking down these walls Mikhail
[1:19:06] Gorbachev see because they still
[1:19:09] exercise power over Kings robe and said
[1:19:13] they're not elected Kings I heard him
[1:19:14] say that today they're not elected Kings
[1:19:15] they're tyrants right and then we even
[1:19:21] know you know the voting system is all
[1:19:22] messed up anyway they might they might
[1:19:25] change the voting system it might be a
[1:19:27] Krupp voting system amen but I still
[1:19:30] vote anyway because I still want my
[1:19:32] voice to be heard I still want to be a
[1:19:33] witness in heaven at least tried to stop
[1:19:36] it with my preaching my voting my
[1:19:38] witnessing everything amen my voice I
[1:19:41] gave everything I could to go against
[1:19:43] that beast system brother have said we
[1:19:46] might not be able to stop it but our
[1:19:47] voices need to cry out against it and
[1:19:51] now a former Polish senator named
[1:19:55] injury's says porzinski said pope john
[1:20:00] paul ii was responsible for the downfall
[1:20:03] of communism Roux worldwide so people
[1:20:08] still today admit the Pope has worldwide
[1:20:11] influence over kings and so let me ask
[1:20:16] you when was the last time a Muslim
[1:20:17] leader caused the end of Wars they start
[1:20:22] wars right where was the last time a
[1:20:26] Jewish priest ended a war they don't
[1:20:31] because they're so small it can only be
[1:20:34] the Pope now anybody with brother ant
[1:20:36] like boba have said about the church in
[1:20:38] his book anyone with any light of God in
[1:20:40] them will see these things the brother
[1:20:43] man was talking about the book of life
[1:20:44] he said anyone who wants to understand
[1:20:46] the book of life he said just get my
[1:20:47] church book he said you understand it if
[1:20:50] there's any life in you at all hey why
[1:20:55] because the lie is the Holy Spirit and
[1:20:57] the Holy Spirit gives revelation it
[1:20:59] gives knowledge it gives understanding
[1:21:01] because it's one spirit a man
[1:21:03] the Holy Spirit hallelujah if you've got
[1:21:06] any Spirit of God anointing you at all
[1:21:08] you'll see these things because it'll
[1:21:10] point you to the word so see how this is
[1:21:16] a great city a great city it's a city
[1:21:20] state the only one like in the world ma
[1:21:22] who reigns over the kings of the earth
[1:21:25] and last but not least number eleven
[1:21:29] this church rides the Beast or the
[1:21:33] spirit of ancient Rome right because
[1:21:36] that's when the brother answer to the
[1:21:37] Beast is Rome
[1:21:38] he said the Beast is always Rome so the
[1:21:42] Beast is the spirit of ancient Rome now
[1:21:45] we know the symbolism symbolism in
[1:21:48] Daniel 7 in Daniel 7 babylons liken to a
[1:21:53] lion right Medes and Persians are
[1:21:56] likened to a bear I remember that
[1:21:58] picture the Grecians are like a leopard
[1:22:01] and then Rome is a dreadful terrible
[1:22:04] beast we're not taught what it looks
[1:22:05] like all we know it's got great iron
[1:22:07] teeth and their spirit beasts and Daniel
[1:22:11] 7 but the Holy Spirit John to look out
[1:22:15] in Revelation 13 and he sees a beast
[1:22:18] coming up that's a combination of all
[1:22:20] four of those beasts amen it's all the
[1:22:23] beasts rolled into one day men are there
[1:22:27] and sitting on her is a woman drinking
[1:22:30] the blood of the saints it has to be the
[1:22:32] Vatican amen hallelujah see it has to be
[1:22:38] and history says this I'm quoting
[1:22:43] although ancient Roman Empire fell in
[1:22:46] the 5th century it fell in the fifth
[1:22:48] century the ancient Roman Empire it
[1:22:51] gained new spiritual authority through
[1:22:54] the Emperor Constantine in the fourth
[1:22:56] century right after their counsels of
[1:22:59] Nicaea and other councils and how did he
[1:23:02] do that it happened this is actually
[1:23:04] history says when Constantine changed
[1:23:07] the Empire's capital from Rome to the
[1:23:10] city of Constantinople in 3:30 Rome's
[1:23:13] civil forty was weakened but it's
[1:23:16] spirits
[1:23:16] authority was strengthened because now
[1:23:22] the title of the supreme priest or
[1:23:25] Pontifex Maximus was now devolved upon
[1:23:29] the Pope amen
[1:23:32] so when he moved the location the
[1:23:34] capital
[1:23:35] it was now at the same place where the
[1:23:37] polis and now the Pope has the title
[1:23:39] Pontifex Maximus instead of the ruler of
[1:23:44] Rome because Constantine must have felt
[1:23:47] that this is going to fall this kingdoms
[1:23:50] gonna fall so he's going to give that
[1:23:52] title over to the Pope and he's sure to
[1:23:54] take that title run with it especially
[1:23:55] during the Dark Ages right specially
[1:24:00] during the Dark Ages so see this
[1:24:04] fulfilled Revelation 13 one two three
[1:24:06] because that beast was wounded to death
[1:24:08] but the deadly wound was healed when
[1:24:11] Constantine Mary R gave that authority
[1:24:14] from himself over to the Pope that's
[1:24:18] right the spirit of Rome lives on in
[1:24:23] this woman this city and just as the
[1:24:28] ancient Rome saw Kingdom our world
[1:24:31] dominance and saw global influence so
[1:24:36] the Roman Catholic Church does that
[1:24:38] today with religious power day ahead
[1:24:42] hallelujah praise the Lord so remember
[1:24:46] it's the same demons because demons
[1:24:47] don't die it's the same demons that were
[1:24:50] all Nebuchadnezzar and all of his
[1:24:51] buddies and Belshazzar the same demons
[1:24:54] that were on them on the Roman Catholic
[1:24:55] Church today because the Bible said she
[1:24:59] is the habitation of devils and the hold
[1:25:01] of every foul spirit and a cage of every
[1:25:04] unclean and hateful bird amen that's why
[1:25:08] they molest children amen that's why
[1:25:11] they murder babies that's why they do
[1:25:15] all these evil things they do that
[1:25:17] because they're filled with all evil
[1:25:19] demon powers that's right let me find
[1:25:25] something to close with here by God's
[1:25:26] grace wow there's so much here let me
[1:25:34] close this veneer I'll just close with
[1:25:35] this thought here about the USA I may
[1:25:40] mention this earlier but I want to just
[1:25:41] close with this here because we know the
[1:25:47] Roman Catholic Church is similar to a
[1:25:49] modern USA I think I preached us did I
[1:25:53] preach on JFK when you were here one
[1:25:54] time brother ray JFK did I preach were
[1:25:56] you here when I preached on that okay we
[1:25:58] showed how JFK brought in
[1:26:02] you know Catholicism the United States
[1:26:05] yeah big time
[1:26:10] now in Revelation 13 the Beast out of
[1:26:17] the sea is the same beast that is the
[1:26:20] beast out of the earth later on the same
[1:26:21] chapter it's the same beast but now he's
[1:26:24] not coming out of many peoples now he's
[1:26:26] coming out of land a smaller number of
[1:26:28] people which both Bram said was North
[1:26:30] America or the Native Americans
[1:26:32] so the beast out of the sea is the same
[1:26:35] beast that is the beast up out of the
[1:26:37] land
[1:26:37] this means the power of the Roman Spirit
[1:26:41] will be exercised by the beast out of
[1:26:44] the land which is the United States and
[1:26:46] there's great similarities between
[1:26:48] ancient Rome and the United States they
[1:26:51] both have the largest economies in the
[1:26:53] world right ancient Rome had the largest
[1:26:57] economy at that time in fact they got so
[1:27:00] stretched out that's why they fell
[1:27:02] history says the reason they stopped
[1:27:04] followers there were so much corruption
[1:27:05] in the government that they stopped
[1:27:07] paying the soldiers and so after you
[1:27:10] know after years and years this the
[1:27:12] soldiers only got paid from time to time
[1:27:13] they stopped being at their post of duty
[1:27:15] they just you know took it lightly and
[1:27:17] that allowed other nations to come in
[1:27:19] because now the soldiers aren't there at
[1:27:22] their posts of duty do you see how
[1:27:25] that's the other Congress was all
[1:27:26] corrupt in their Senate was I just like
[1:27:27] today my goodness mercy in the Lord okay
[1:27:31] yeah there are little oh they're
[1:27:33] concerned about is them getting raises
[1:27:35] right the continent now most of them not
[1:27:37] all of them the congressmen
[1:27:39] and representives they just want to make
[1:27:41] sure if they don't pass any bill you
[1:27:43] know they're gonna pass the bill to get
[1:27:44] a pay raise to get their own pay raise
[1:27:47] all not yeah they sure earned that
[1:27:52] Devils reward just like Judas earn is
[1:27:55] reward right right
[1:27:59] they'll make sure they vote to get their
[1:28:01] pay raise they won't vote on you know
[1:28:03] funding this or funding that but they'll
[1:28:05] make sure they get a raise
[1:28:07] Rome and us also have the strongest
[1:28:10] military number three they had the most
[1:28:15] 100 and respected politics in the world
[1:28:19] everybody looked at Rome and said my
[1:28:21] look at their politics we need to have a
[1:28:23] republic like that same thing about
[1:28:25] United States everybody sees the freedom
[1:28:27] in the u.s. everybody sees the
[1:28:28] legislative process and were the were
[1:28:30] the shining beacon for everyone also
[1:28:34] they had the most advanced technologies
[1:28:36] everyone knows the advances of Roman
[1:28:38] civilization right especially with roads
[1:28:41] that was one of the biggest ones because
[1:28:43] every road leads to Rome I'm sorry
[1:28:46] there's one that leads to heaven that's
[1:28:48] the one I've all and praise God I'm on
[1:28:50] the highway of holiness that road
[1:28:53] doesn't lead to Rome amen it leads to
[1:28:56] heaven and also Rome ancient Rome had
[1:29:01] the most freedom and variety of cultural
[1:29:03] expressions because of all their gods
[1:29:05] and goddesses and all their festivals
[1:29:08] just like America right you got the
[1:29:11] freedom to do about whatever you want
[1:29:12] freedom to pierce your nose and make
[1:29:14] yourself look like a Beatle if you want
[1:29:16] or a lizard with everyone you got the
[1:29:18] freedom to do that but thank God we got
[1:29:20] the freedom to worship Jesus Christ hey
[1:29:23] man thank God for that
[1:29:26] yeah lastly is religious tolerance which
[1:29:29] we kind of overlap that a little bit
[1:29:40] now let's just go for a little bit of
[1:29:42] history a little bit more now brother
[1:29:46] branham interprets this well I just
[1:29:47] let's see here
[1:29:49] there's so much to get into let's just
[1:29:53] let's just go to one more scripture
[1:29:54] let's go to Revelation 13 here I'm just
[1:29:57] gonna close I'm gonna I'm gonna just and
[1:30:00] change one thing let's go to Revelation
[1:30:01] 13 6 I'm gonna close with a triple
[1:30:04] blasphemy thought here let me just close
[1:30:05] with that I thought this won't be
[1:30:07] shorter but it's actually longer the
[1:30:09] American thoughts are the longer this
[1:30:10] shot thoughts are those shorter triple
[1:30:12] blast me this beast blasphemes out of
[1:30:14] this spirit of Rome blasphemes God in
[1:30:17] three ways but brother Branham says this
[1:30:20] in this in the seals when he preached
[1:30:22] the seals is a three-fold blasphemy
[1:30:24] revelation 13:6 and he opened his mouth
[1:30:27] and blasphemy against God who's he that
[1:30:29] Antichrist spirit the beast Rome against
[1:30:34] God to blaspheme his name his tabernacle
[1:30:36] and then there in heaven brother Bram
[1:30:38] calls it triple blasphemy first how does
[1:30:42] he blaspheme God's name he changes it
[1:30:44] from Lord Jesus Christ to Holy Trinity
[1:30:48] or he'll put titles Father Son Holy
[1:30:50] Ghost how does he how do they bless
[1:30:52] every wedding and father son Holy Ghost
[1:30:53] instead of Lord Jesus Christ but the
[1:31:00] bottles
[1:31:00] Colossians 3:17 we do all things and
[1:31:03] word or deed in the name of the Lord
[1:31:05] Jesus Christ Philippians 2 not I'm sorry
[1:31:09] flip Ian's to 9 through 11 says there's
[1:31:11] no other name under heaven I'm sorry
[1:31:13] says Jesus Christ is the name of above
[1:31:16] all names amen
[1:31:18] in Ephesians 4 says there's the entire
[1:31:22] name of the family in heaven earth is
[1:31:24] the Lord Jesus Christ see the Roman
[1:31:27] Church doesn't hollow or reveal God's
[1:31:30] name Jesus taught us to pray and he said
[1:31:32] our Father who art in heaven hallowed be
[1:31:34] your name and so they break the first
[1:31:37] prayer they break the command the first
[1:31:39] command is let God's name be reverent
[1:31:41] they don't reverence the name of Lord
[1:31:42] Jesus Christ they reverence Holy Mother
[1:31:45] of God
[1:31:45] Holy Trinity and father son Holy Ghost
[1:31:47] more than that and they blaspheme the
[1:31:49] name of Jesus Christ but we don't
[1:31:52] blaspheme it we worship it we're married
[1:31:54] into it we run into it the righteous run
[1:31:56] into it and are saying they may we pray
[1:31:59] over our food in the name of Jesus
[1:32:01] Christ we pray over the sick in the name
[1:32:04] of Jesus Christ we baptize in the name
[1:32:06] of Jesus Christ amen but they blaspheme
[1:32:10] it not hallowing the name of Jesus
[1:32:13] Christ hallowed be your name because
[1:32:16] remember jesus said i come in my
[1:32:17] father's name the lord jesus christ
[1:32:22] second they blast me in heaven because
[1:32:25] they call Rome the Eternal City and we
[1:32:29] know it's not eternal on an area and
[1:32:32] they deck it with priceless artwork gold
[1:32:35] and precious valuables of incalculable
[1:32:37] measure Rome is not eternal for her
[1:32:41] plagues come in one day and she'll be
[1:32:43] judged in one hour amen
[1:32:47] because strong is the Lord God who
[1:32:50] judges her amen glory there's only one
[1:32:54] eternal City and that's the one that
[1:32:56] comes down from heaven the New Jerusalem
[1:32:58] in Revelation 21 and 22 and she comes
[1:33:01] down a door like a bride adorned for her
[1:33:04] husband hey man that heavenly tournament
[1:33:08] amen
[1:33:08] there's one eternal City that's your
[1:33:10] city hey men the New Jerusalem that's
[1:33:13] our city by God's grace
[1:33:16] praise God and let me just turn there
[1:33:19] where that scripture says that yeah it's
[1:33:23] verse 8 revelation 18 21 I read this a
[1:33:26] couple weeks ago right brother Aaron
[1:33:27] when we preach part 1 I think we ended
[1:33:29] that service by showing how the mother
[1:33:34] harlot can't be Jerusalem because
[1:33:37] Jerusalem gets resurrected right in
[1:33:39] Isaiah 65 and 66 and the Bible said
[1:33:44] she'll always be there but Rome gets
[1:33:47] destroyed and she'll have an ending
[1:33:49] point amen but Jerusalem will have a
[1:33:51] we'll never have an ending point because
[1:33:54] he's eternal amen
[1:33:55] yeah it's revelation 18 21 and a mighty
[1:33:59] angel took up a stone like a great
[1:34:01] millstone and cast in the sea say thus
[1:34:03] with violence shall that great city
[1:34:05] Babylon be thrown down and shall be
[1:34:08] found no more at all Amen see wrong has
[1:34:13] an ending but New Jerusalem never has an
[1:34:15] ending amen and they clearly were
[1:34:18] eternal were - no that's not eternal
[1:34:20] that's idolatry that will have an ending
[1:34:22] with the pyramid city will have no
[1:34:25] ending and there's a place there there's
[1:34:27] a mansion there there's a hole there for
[1:34:29] you and I man
[1:34:30] that's why Jesus went away I go to
[1:34:33] prepare a place for you that where I am
[1:34:35] there you may be also amen there's one
[1:34:39] thing Jesus asked for in his prayer with
[1:34:41] the father he asked for your fellowship
[1:34:43] for all eternity program says that
[1:34:46] that's the one thing as for Lord make
[1:34:49] them one as we are one that where I am
[1:34:51] there they may be also amen
[1:34:55] he wanted to be with his wife forever so
[1:34:58] he went to prepare a place for her let's
[1:35:01] say in our feet here's last one the
[1:35:06] Bible that spear of Rome blasphemes then
[1:35:09] there are evident
[1:35:11] so Rome blasting the saints in heaven by
[1:35:14] teaching his followers to pray to them
[1:35:16] rather to God Himself can you imagine
[1:35:20] just getting all
[1:35:23] saying Peter help me Peter help me like
[1:35:26] what could Peter do like what what could
[1:35:29] he do
[1:35:31] what could Mary do every way what can
[1:35:33] these people do they can't do anything
[1:35:36] but they're taught that they that
[1:35:39] they're almost like gods
[1:35:40] you know and it's idolatry and it's a
[1:35:43] blasphemy Jesus Christ never taught
[1:35:48] anyone to pray to Mary or any other
[1:35:50] believer and I like acts 14 because any
[1:35:54] true believer whether alive or dead or
[1:35:57] alive in the other dimension would
[1:36:00] instantly reject any prayers sacrifice
[1:36:03] or worship directed to themselves just
[1:36:07] as Paul Barnabas did in acts 14 amen all
[1:36:11] got so filled with the holy spirit he
[1:36:13] saw a man that had never walked and he
[1:36:14] was crippled on his feet and the Bible
[1:36:17] said he said with a loud voice stand
[1:36:19] upright on your feet is because he had
[1:36:21] in the anointing of the gift of faith he
[1:36:24] had faith he had a revelation this man's
[1:36:26] going to walk how to get it by a vision
[1:36:28] from God Almighty Haven Isaiah and he's
[1:36:32] the Bible said he perceived that that
[1:36:34] man had faith in that preacher Amen so
[1:36:39] one omnipotent meant another unlimited
[1:36:41] Amen in other words one who's annoyed
[1:36:44] with the Holy Spirit another person who
[1:36:46] was anointed holy spirit and something's
[1:36:48] going to happen when two people ignored
[1:36:50] do it the Holy Spirit meet together amen
[1:36:53] in other words God has to work on both
[1:36:56] ends he worked on the end of the
[1:36:58] who never walked and he worked on pause
[1:37:00] can you imagine what in the hospital and
[1:37:02] basically foretelling you're going to
[1:37:05] rise up and walk right now you never
[1:37:07] will it before but you're gonna walk
[1:37:09] right now that's the kind of church that
[1:37:10] were a part of although we may have
[1:37:13] never have done it there are those
[1:37:15] around us who have done it praise God
[1:37:16] and it's part of our family tree amen
[1:37:20] holiday up and that same powers in us
[1:37:23] when God wants to use it that way glory
[1:37:27] see and whether the instant they said
[1:37:30] let's let's worship Paul and Barnabas
[1:37:33] they're like Jupiter and Saturn and
[1:37:35] instantly they got on their knees and
[1:37:36] they
[1:37:37] I don't worship both don't make any
[1:37:39] sacrifices to us we we can do nothing
[1:37:42] this was all done by God amen
[1:37:45] see any true man of God any true woman
[1:37:48] of God will instantly reject any worship
[1:37:50] or sacrifice made to them like Peter
[1:37:54] corneas when tonic
[1:37:56] kisses feast and get up man come on guy
[1:37:58] what are you doing man you can't worship
[1:38:00] me Who am I
[1:38:01] God sent me here my vision well I didn't
[1:38:03] have that power I was just up there
[1:38:05] praying at the sixth hour you know I was
[1:38:07] up there praying in my regular prayer
[1:38:09] time I didn't do this go do this amen
[1:38:12] but as he preached the Holy Ghost fell
[1:38:14] and all them that heard the word yes
[1:38:17] that's right so our lesson is that human
[1:38:21] beings are never honored with sacrifice
[1:38:23] prayers or worship that's reserved for
[1:38:26] God amen okay another pulpit here I'm
[1:38:30] sorry come to the piano now Lord willing
[1:38:34] we'll finish next Wednesday if the Lord
[1:38:37] tarries will look at the mark of the
[1:38:38] beast the mark in the right hand or
[1:38:40] forehead the mark of his name these are
[1:38:42] all different things we can look at the
[1:38:46] number again if you look at that or the
[1:38:48] image of the beast some of these are
[1:38:49] review about one of the children to see
[1:38:51] it we'll try to maybe I don't know maybe
[1:38:53] there'll be two more services the false
[1:38:56] prophet Catholicism in the US and then
[1:39:00] there's rewards for receiving the
[1:39:03] revelation of Mystery Babylon
[1:39:04] there's rewards the Bible says so we
[1:39:08] want to go over that so in other words
[1:39:10] if you can recognize this false church
[1:39:11] you get rewards for that by staying out
[1:39:14] of it right
[1:39:16] you always get rewards right you draw
[1:39:19] nigh to God God will draw nigh unto you
[1:39:21] right whatever you sow that's what you
[1:39:23] reap when you receive these seeds of
[1:39:26] Revelation you're going to get some
[1:39:28] benefit from it
[1:39:31] but then there's also reading the
[1:39:33] mystery that's when a lot of people
[1:39:35] gonna have to answer for on the day of
[1:39:36] judgment they won't speak against the
[1:39:38] Catholic Church they won't preach
[1:39:39] against so they won't try to witness to
[1:39:40] their Catholic friends and they're going
[1:39:41] to answer for that god help us praise
[1:39:45] God amen praise God is there a song that
[1:39:49] Amen you sang about you are God alone do
