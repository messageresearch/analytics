Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. Amen. Let's thank God. Hallelujah. Let's change that last song. Let's do Walk it up the King's Highway. That kind of felt impressed on that one. I had a thought about that one. Let's sing the King's Highway. Is it two verses? My memor is right. Oh, three. Okay. Aren't you glad, church, you're walking up the King's Highway? Hallelujah. I'm not on the devil's highway. I'm on God's highway. Hallelujah. Amen. My way gets brighter. My load gets lighter. Walking up the kings highway. There's joy in knowing with him I'm going.

Walking up the king's highway, there'll be a blessing you'll be confessing. Walking up the gates highway. It's a high way to heaven. Glory and shall walk there. It's a high way to heaven. Walking at the King's Highway. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, musicians. God bless you. Let's take our Bibles here tonight. Probably preach a little shorter message here. We got here a little later, so I apologize about that. But just thankful everybody could be in the house of the Lord tonight. 1st Samuel chapter 4. Let's go back. I want to preach a third uh segment on this little thought here tonight. It's the thought we looked at the last few weeks about confidence without character. Of course, the opposite is confidence with character. That's what we want to have. Uh by the grace of the Lord, I believe we have it. But it's good to check up. Hallelujah. preach the word. And uh we know we're following the will of God when we're keeping the word of God. We have to keep the word of God. Hallelujah. 1st Samuel chapter 4. As I was reading through 1 Samuel, I'm not quite done. I think I chapter 18 or 19, but a couple weeks ago, I read over this. I thought my that thought came to me about brother McBride preached to us and uh kind of struck me with that thought. So I wanted to preach on this here by God's grace a false sense of security. So Israel had a false sense of security. We'll just read verse five uh to preserve time here tonight by God's grace. 1st Samuel 4:5. If you got it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Love those Bibles open. I love how those Bibles are just laid across the top of the chairs there. So, that's really wonderful, children. I appreciate that. Hallelujah. God's word is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's read verse five, and then we'll have you be seated. Ready? One, two, three. And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again. May God add his blessing to the ring of his word. May be seated. God bless you. Set a little timer here. Maybe I preach about 45 minutes. Well, we were certainly blessed on Sunday. You know, the morning's message was called the true prosperity gospel. And I thought that was a beautiful thought. How many enjoyed that? Praise God. What a wonderful lesson that was. Just a reminder about godliness with contentment is great gain. Amen. I thought that was wonderful. And it's been on my heart. You know what? I want to preach on finances. I want to preach on at least once a year just to kind of uh revisit that and talk about stewardship. Uh so it was on my heart to preach on finances and then I had up my list of things to preach on and our brother come and preach on finances. I thought that was really great. You can't separate that from the spiritual aspect. Praise God. So I thought that was so beautiful. Uh you know we should one invest in our talents and uh the Lord makes some rich, the Lord makes some poor. Um but I love Solomon's prayer. Solomon's prayer was, "Lord, don't make me rich that I forget you. Don't make me poor that have to steal." In other words, he's asking, "Uh, make me middle class by God's grace." Amen. So, uh, we should all be thankful. I believe everybody here is middle class. Amen. Everybody has food in the refrigerator. Everybody's got a refrigerator. Amen. So, uh, we're thankful for that. And I'll probably preach on finances maybe in a few weeks here, uh, by God's grace, just revisit where we want to be, especially getting out of debt. The Bible says the borrower is servant to the lender. So, we don't want to be in debt uh to someone uh except for the house. That'd be the only thing you want to be in debt for and then pay that off as soon as possible. Most people can't pay cash for a house these days in this economy. Uh but the main thing to do is be debtree as soon as possible by the grace of God. They can really build wealth after that if it's the Lord's will. if it's the Lord's will because God u might not open certain doors for you certain ways. That's why it's so important to be content. So, uh we'll preach more on that here by God's grace in the next few weeks, Lord willing, if the Lord carries. Um we looked at parts one and two. Now, part one, we focus a lot on Eli. And remember, there was numerous sins in Eli's day. The Bible said uh the whole land was full of idols. Remember that? So Eli's land, Eli's time was full of idols. Eli was overweight. He wasn't taking care of his temple. Um he let the lights go out in the holy place. So we see he let down on keeping the standard in the house of the Lord. Uh we saw that was a great sin. So idolatry, uh ignoring the house of God, neglecting the ministry, uh we'd say, uh gluttony, that's the word I'm looking for, gluttony, uh amongst the leadership. The worst part, it seems like though, was him letting his sons uh commit sins in the church. We'd say that was uh probably the worst part. Remember, they would take the offering before it was even sacrificed to God. So, they set themselves above God. Uh they God was supposed to get the fat, but they chose the pieces even with fat on it. And it made the men, the Bible said they abhored the house of God. They hated coming to church because Eli let his sons do awful things in the house of God. Now, how does that apply to me as a pastor? I have to make sure my life, my children, all my life, all my family keeps the right spirit, the Holy Spirit. Hallelujah. As I said, if anyone ever offends you, go talk to them one-on-one. Amen. We know even God sent a prophet to Eli, right? And also Samuel to tell him of his sins, right? So, he had chances, he had opportunities. And even the Bible said Eli could have fronted his sons and said, "Why do you do these wicked things?" Uh, but we'll look at a little a little more at that here tonight by God's grace. And another awful sin was the uh adultery, right? The Bible said the two sons were laying with the women. So the sisters that would come, he would try to get their numbers after service or something like that. Real wretched men like that. Wicked men like that. The Bible said they were sons of Bile or sons of Satan. Hallelujah. Uh, and we saw, we ended part one, and I'm just kind of rehearsing just for my sake. We ended part one by showing Eli trembled at the ark, but he didn't tremble at the sin that was in his family. &gt;&gt; And church, so it is today. People will tremble at the anointing, right? They'll tremble at crowds. &gt;&gt; They'll tremble at big city, big churches, right? Or big revivals. They'll tremble at all these things or a famous preacher who walks in. They'll tremble at that. But do they tremble at obedience to the word of God? &gt;&gt; If not, then they're doing the same thing Eli did and they'll get the same results. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's that's true. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If you love me, keep my commands." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, it's good to tremble at the presence of God. It's good to tremble when people are weeping and that that's very good. It's very good to tremble. But we should tremble at the sin amongst the people and keep sin out of the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. All right. And then part two was last Wednesday on the the evening service there uh from I preached from home because of the snow. And so we looked at verses in Hebrews about uh confidence. The Bible says you have confidence if if you keep your confession to the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? So we looked at confidence. So we looked at how believers should have confidence with character. But it's that Judas's group, the makebeliever group. They're the group that has confidence without character. &gt;&gt; Right? Hallelujah. And church, remember even did you remember that the foolish virgin didn't even have confidence on the day of judgment &gt;&gt; because Jesus said, "Come, come blessed the Lord." And they said, "When did we uh when did we feed you? When did we give you water? When did we take you in? When did we visit you in prison?" They didn't even know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That they were going to be saved, right? &gt;&gt; The foolish virgin. Remember, there's two kinds of Christians. There's wise virgins. They they're spiritfilled. They believe all the word of God. They live all the word of God. Then there's foolish virgins &gt;&gt; who they're virgin to the word. They don't have any idolatry with the world, which is a small group, right, brother Rob? As much as we see people uh intimacy with the world and worldly pleasures, right? What a small group. Hallelujah. My both groups very small. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the foolish virgins even surprised when did we do this? And Jesus said, "When you've done it to the least of these, my brethren, you've done it unto me." &gt;&gt; Amen. So remember, do alms uh give to the poor, give to the needy, visit people, pray for uh yeah, visit sick people in the hospital. Uh if you can invite invite people into your house for a little while, invite them in. Let them in. Whatever you can do because when you do it to the least believer, you've done it unto Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; So we looked at that last week and we also looked, I think, five examples of how people had confidence without character. To me, the my favorite was the one where both men are praying in the temple, right? And one man says, "Thank God I'm not like this publican. I fast twice a week. I give all these alms." He said, 'Thank God I'm not like that unholy man. And then the publicans down there beating his chest say, "God, be merciful to me a sinner." Jesus said, "Only one of them went home forgiven." &gt;&gt; It was the humble one. It wasn't the confident, cocky one, or we'd say the bold one. It was like, "Oh, thank God I'm not like brother so and sister so and so." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It was the humble one who was asking God for mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. So help let us keep that in mind tonight. Yes, I'm going to rebuke sin. I always rebuke sin. I hope you rebuke sin in your house too. Amen. In your life, you should rebuke sin as well. But be humble and say, "God, I've fallen short, so forgive me when I fall short." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be merciful to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't deserve it no more than anybody else. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In fact, church, we got to be more accountable because we have more of the revelation of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now, let's move into part three. That was five five minute uh introduction there. &gt;&gt; Uh eight minute introduction. Amen. All right. Now, go to uh go to uh let's go to 1st Samuel uh chapter 2. In verses 15-1 17, the Bible said, "Before they burnt the fat, before they even gave God an offering, Samuel's sons would take the good parts." Now, see, church, can't you see that? Not every uh the sons of every church leader don't always turn out good. I'm believing mine are by God's grace. But I'm talking about brother Brandham, right? Even brother Brandham's sons. &gt;&gt; Just because a prophet or a man of God, even Samuel's sons fell short of the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Remember the people come and said, "Samuel, we love you, but your sons are not good, godly men. We want a king." &gt;&gt; So just because someone's got a good father, a good mama, don't mean you're going to heaven. Each person's got to repent of their sins and get right. &gt;&gt; Right. God don't have any grandchildren. Right. Very famous saying. Brother Ram quoted that all the time. God don't have any grandchildren. He got it from somebody else too. I forgot he got it from somebody. It might have been brother Shakarian. Uh but the men were saying if you don't give it to us in verse 16 will take it by force. Remember brother says Satan is the god of force. &gt;&gt; Satan will force these evil thoughts in your mind. Right now verse 17 the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord for men abhore the offering of the Lord. Church we want our church to be a place where there's so much holiness. People love coming to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you love coming to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If not, like I said, talk to that person. Uh get everything figured out and then you can love coming to church again. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, verse 22. Now, Eli was very old and heard all that his sons did under Israel and how that they lay with the women that assembled of the door or at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So, Eli hears, "My sons are committing adultery." Remember, they're married. though his two sons are married to women, but they're laying with women. They're committing adultery. And then he said in verse 23, "Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings all or by all this people. Everybody in the churches tell me your sons are sleeping around." And he didn't do anything about it. &gt;&gt; Now see church, that's the difference between a real leader and a bad leader. &gt;&gt; A real leader when he hears about sin, he goes try to take care of it and reach out to those people. He doesn't let it continue. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; This is major sin. Sexual sin is a major sin. Paul calls it levan. And that will that levan that pride will impact the whole church and the whole church will be backed on God. Hallelujah. That's why people sin. I tell them don't come to church or confess. Don't keep coming to church because you're gonna create such an atmosphere of levan where people think it's okay to sin and they forget about the holiness of God. &gt;&gt; Right. Don't bring that levan in here. That's always been my prayer. God, keep the leaven out of the church. &gt;&gt; Even if we're a small church, I'd rather have a small church levven free, unleavened. Amen. Than a big church with a bunch of sin and leaven in it. I'd ra if you gave me the choice, I'd rather have the way with the Lord's despised few. &gt;&gt; Don't bring sin in this church. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, church, when I'm talking about us now, the faithful ones, not just confess it before you get here. Praise God. Right? Come to church. Amen. I'm talking about sexual sin and all these major sins. We're all gonna battle every single day, but we can confess our sins every day when we come to church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he says in verse 24, "No name, my sons, it's no good report that I hear. You make the Lord's people to transgress." &gt;&gt; Verse 25, "If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him. But if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat him? Notwithstanding, they hearken not to the voice of their father because the Lord would slay them." In other words, God was going to slay them. Right? God knew their actions. God knew they wouldn't repent. So God had ordained for them to be slain. They get slain in the battle. The very next battle coming up here. Now, let's go on now. Uh let's go down to verse 27. And there came a man of God unto Eli said unto him, "Thus sayith the Lord." Now, that's a quite a statement. I uh I don't think I've ever got a thus sayith the Lord, but I did have brother Ray tell me a He said, "The Lord wanted me to tell you this, but he didn't say thus sayeth the Lord." And we went search it out and it was exactly right. He said, "Go ask your daughter this, this, that." I asked Lydia that. She started crying and it was vindicated to me. But I've never really had that before. But he Eli gets a thus sayeth the Lord. Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father when they were in Egypt and Pharaoh's house? And did I choose him out of the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon an altar, to burn incense, to wear an epha before me? And did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel? Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at my offering. Now that just struck me. Doesn't that sound familiar? Kick. Who else was kicking against God? St. Paul was when he was Saul. &gt;&gt; Why you kick against the pricks? And the church said. So it's thus sayith the Lord. Eli was fighting against God, not for God. &gt;&gt; How was he fighting against God, brother Jesse? He never he never committed any sin. He let the sin go on. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So imagine that he's kicking against God like God. No. No. Same thing Saul was doing. He was fighting against He was arresting Christians, taking them to jail, holding the coats of those who stoned Stephen. That's kicking against the gospel. That's fighting the gospel. So Eli's guilty of something similar. I just saw that right now. I actually didn't have that in my notes. and at my offering which I have commanded. So any leader that lets the church service get off and it's there's sin in it like that, you know, robbing God or the worship or sexual sin, let it go in the church. Any leader that does that is fighting against God. That's right. And honors, now look at this. And it even goes this far. Honoring your sons above me. So see, when the when the leaders of the church, myself or anyone, any pastor, when they let sin go on, they actually honor the people more than they honor God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So again, that's why I don't let sinners come to this church. Now, church, there's been a couple times I've had to even turn people down. They said, 'Well, I want to attend your church and I can pay tithe. And I said, 'Well, do you have anything wrong with your former church? Yes. I said, 'Well, then fine. Don't come to our church. I don't care how much money you offer me. Don't come to church. Right? Because I don't want sin. I don't want questions. I don't want problems. I want a church that loves Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Don't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Honorest your sons above me to make your Now, this is thus sayith the Lord. You've honored your sons above me by letting them take God's meat, God's fat, &gt;&gt; right? to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of yourselves. So Eli's included in this. So Eli and his sons were overweight, right? With the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel, my people getting fat off the uh the the the the offerings of the people. That was wrong. So other words, they're living off the high horse. We'd say living large as the servants of God, &gt;&gt; right? All right. Verse 30. Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, I indeed said that thy house and the f house of thy father should walk before me forever. But now the Lord saith, be a far from me. For them that honor me, I will honor. That they despise I'm sorry. They that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. A church, I've told this to many young men. I told to my nephews re at the funeral a couple weeks ago. I tell to all these young men I meet and I say, "Hey, God bless you. where you going to college or you know what you're doing. I said I said honor your mother and father and God will honor you. &gt;&gt; That's why I tell the people that still live at their home. You want God to honor you? Honor your mother and father. Young people, &gt;&gt; adults, if your mother and father aren't living in your house anymore, you honor God in your finances, your health, uh your relationships, honor God in everything, and God will honor you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll hear your prayers. Hallelujah. He He'll let you be a light and a witness and a real Christian testimony. Praise God. That's right. Honor God and God will honor you. &gt;&gt; People can't honor God's house by coming to church. They can't honor God with our finances by t paying ti and offerings, right? So many ways we can list people that dishonor God. How's God going to honor you if you don't honor him? &gt;&gt; He's not going to. Verse 34. And this should be a sign unto you, Eli, that shall come upon thy two sons on Hoffne and Phineas, in one day they shall die, both of them. I'll raise me up a faithful priest. Amen. In other words, God saying, Eli, you're not faithful. So, I'm going to raise me up a faithful one. &gt;&gt; That shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind, and I'll build him a sure house, and he shall walk before mine anointed forever. Amen. Hallelujah. So see church, whenever leaders let sin happen, they're not doing what God's heart wants them to do. Amen. Oh, now we can see it. Now we can see how we can be a church after the heart of God. Keep all the sin out. Keep believe every command. Believe every promise. Then we're a church after the heart of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Keep every sin out. Keep all the leaven out. And then we'll be a church after the heart of God. That's the scripture. I'm sure church, if you're like me, you want to have a faithful church to the word of God. Don't you want your life to be faithful to God? I want my life to be faithful to God. &gt;&gt; Now, with my remaining time, I got now on my 30. I've only been preaching about uh let's see uh 20. What am I at? Oh, 19 minutes. Yeah. Oh, not too long. Let's go to first I want to spend the rest of time on family here because that's the the important part of this uh story. 1st Samuel 3, please. Verse two. 1st Samuel 3:2. We'll read uh 2 and 3. 1 Samuel 3:2. And it came to pass at that time that when Eli was laid down in his place, his eyes began to wax dim that he could not see. And air the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord where the ark of God was. and Samuel was laid down to sleep. Okay, now I'm just going to pause right there. Now, if you remember in, I believe it was Deuteronomy or Numbers, God told Moses, the people are going to beat down with their feet the olives to get oil and then they're going to bring the oil in, right? And then that oil will keep the lamp stand going, the seven lamped golden candlestick, right? &gt;&gt; So Eli, he probably had the oil there, but he didn't apply it. Oh, that sounds like good like a good sermon, doesn't it? Having oil, having the Holy Ghost, but not applying it to your life. Amen. Not setting it on fire. Oh my. Hallelujah. Having the spirit of God with you, but not letting it burn. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. Didn't the Bible say, uh, did not the word of God burn inside of our hearts? We heard on Sunday. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did not it burn within us? &gt;&gt; See, we be too interested, we're too, sometimes we're too interested in other things. We let that burn in our hearts and mind. We got to let the Holy Spirit burn in our hearts and minds. Amen. Hallelujah. But see, the people were probably doing their part, but the Bible makes it look like it's Eli's fault. He let it go out. Imagine Eli, in other words, Eli was supposed to keep the lights on. &gt;&gt; But the but I guess only his sons would know like in the holy place, once they got in the holy place, there was no light on. It was dark, right? So the service of the Lord was missing light. Hey, there was enough light in the service of the Lord. And the church said light. What is light? The Bible said it's knowledge. It's understanding for the New Testament believer. Hallelujah. The light of their eyes being enlightened. The Bible says, right? The light the eyes of their understanding being open. So, in other words, he was keeping uh the the candle from burning. The light wasn't shining in order to the service of the Lord. I don't know if that means also, did they replace the 12 loaves every week like they were supposed to? Were they also lacking bread? One thing's for sure, they didn't have the light of the seven church ages. Amen. Hallelujah. So, does that mean uh the shoe bread was out to the bread of his face? In other words, they weren't in the presence of God uh seeking his face through the word of God, eating and feasting on the bread of life. And does that mean they let down on their prayer life then after that? &gt;&gt; Because the altar of incense was next, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; See, so one mistake, one neglect leads to another. &gt;&gt; Now verse 12, I want to focus just on this thought here. Verse 12. In that day, I'll perform against Eli all the things which I have spoken concerning his house. Isn't it interesting? Eli and Elijah are so close together. Eli and Elijah, he says, concerning his house, when I begin, I will also make an end. Now, verse 13. Now, here's the point I want to get to. I preached a series on this many years ago. For I've told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity that he knoweth. In other words, he knew about the idolatry. He knew about no light uh in the candlestick. He knew about his sons taking the meat. He knew about his sons sleeping around. And he didn't do anything about it &gt;&gt; other than just say, "Guys, why you doing this?" &gt;&gt; That's all he just spoke it. &gt;&gt; But church, he had more power than that. &gt;&gt; He was their dad, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He could have removed them from serving in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Find somebody else who's faithful. Find somebody else who's sexually pure. &gt;&gt; Not these perverts, &gt;&gt; these adulterers. Get the ADULTERERS OUT OF THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; I'm not even finished with the verse. He's going to be judged because of iniquity. Sound familiar? The workers of iniquity are going to be judged too, right? false sense of security, confidence without the character. They were confident. They cast out devils, healed the sick, did many wonderful works. But Jesus said, "I never knew you because you were workers of iniquity." Sound like Eli. &gt;&gt; Now, I hope he was saved at the end. I don't know. I hope he was saved. He was still trembling at the ark, but he didn't remove the sin out of his family. So, here we could see of a of a we'd say a deadbeat dad. Can everybody agree with that? He wasn't a good dad. Now, I hope you had a good dad. Some people, some of us didn't. But here's an example of, "Well, my dad wasn't very good, right? My dad didn't correct me like he should have." That's what the boys could have said, but the boys knew better. The dad tried to use his words. But the dad should have did more than just say words. That's according to thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; It was iniquity. He let this go on. He honored his sons more than he honored God. All right. Now, here's the one. Here's I want to read. Because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. Now, Eno Eli neglected God's house and his fatherly duty to restrain his children. So, iniquity is when you know you're wrong. And iniquity means lawlessness. I don't I don't care what the word of God says. I'm going to do whatever I want to do. That's iniquity. &gt;&gt; You already know the will of God. Judgment goes upon workers of iniquity. &gt;&gt; Now, Eli would have escaped this if he would had restrained his sons from their vile acts. In other words, guys, stop taking the meat. I'm not going to let you take the meat. And stop sleeping around here. You guys aren't even going to greet anybody in the tabernacle. Stop it. Get out of here. Stop coming. You're not allowed to do this anymore. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, Chris. Yes. Amen, brother. Exactly right, brother. And even their own children many times too. And wives. Yes. Even the Yes. Even the pastors themselves many times. Very good. Just give Brother Chris two claps. Sorry. Very good. It's the picture of the modern church today. They know sins in the church and they let us sit there. Like I said, that's why brother Rans marriage and divorce was so important because it showed us the difference between adultery and then purity. It showed if anyone gets married two or three times or whatever or get divorced and then sleep around, it shows they're guilty of adultery, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And therefore, God is not blessing those people. &gt;&gt; Right? He's not going to bless their souls. I'm talking about, &gt;&gt; right? The Bible says some some men's sins go before them, some come behind. So some of them God will rebuke, you know, during their life. Some of them God will just let him go just like the rich young ruler, right? But then they'll find out at the judgment that they were wrong. Right? Other words, they'll they might get spanked here or they might get spanked there. &gt;&gt; But they're going to get spanked by God, &gt;&gt; right? Disciplined, judged. Now the word restrain, church, in the Hebrew means to grow weak. Eli's job as a father was to lessen the impact of the sins of his sons. Okay? So that's what it means. He should have restrain them. In other words, you got to stop doing that. I'm going to remove. You're not allowed to work with the offerings until you stop doing this. And he should have watched them to make sure they didn't do it wrong. He had to. you must restrain them. Now, for our church, it would be like me. If I just let Malachi live a sinful life and he can see keep playing the the organ or let my girls or my daughters live a sinful life and they'll keep playing, that would be the same thing that Eli did. Or if I myself lived a double life, &gt;&gt; it'd be the same thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God requires holiness. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we got to stand for holiness. We got to keep the sin out of the church. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. So we we must restrain our children. I'll say like this. We must restrain the church as well because Paul told uh Corinthian church, get that man sleeping around. Get him out of the church. Deliver his soul to Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Give deliver his body to Satan that his soul might be saved. &gt;&gt; So I'm sorry I said that wrong because Paul called him a brother. Still a brother sleeping with his stepmother. Shocking. Now, I want to go this route. I've been preaching 28 minutes here. Um, maybe about 15. I love your encouragement, Brother Chris. 1 Peter 3:1. If you got your Bibles, 1 Peter 3, verse one. So, we looked at parents. Parents need to stop to go to any lengths to stop their children from sinning. you uh you have to restrain them so they're sinning less and less and less. Go to any lengths, right? You parents have to do that. They can't just say, "Well, Johnny's going to do it. Johnny's gonna do Susiey's going to do it. Susie." No, you better stop. You better go talk to them and stop them from doing it &gt;&gt; as much as you can. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Any real parent will do that. If not, the iniquity is also on the parents like it was on Eli. That's thus sayith the word of God, &gt;&gt; right? Eli got a thus sayith the Lord. You're just as guilty because you allowed it to continue. &gt;&gt; That's right. And the Bible said a pastor can't rule the house of God until he can rule his own house. &gt;&gt; So, there's a prerequisite to being a pastor. You have to have a holy house first and then that'll keep this house holy. &gt;&gt; By God's grace, we're coming up on 20 years. I've tried to keep the house of God holy just like I've tried to keep my own house holy. That's right. Now, 1 Peter 3:1, let's get into husbands and wives here. Let's review this here. By God's grace, I thought uh it would kind of connected really well. Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands. Now, I've seen this play out where in marriages, a wife will a wife will take the pastor's word instead of the husband's word. And I've seen that sometimes cause people problems, right? But the Bible says the wife needs to obey her own husband. Now, if her husband's breaking the word, that's different, &gt;&gt; right? Sometimes the devil tries to get in a marriage and uh uh make make it look to get the husband mad to make it look like the wife loves the pastor more than the husband, right? Not doesn't happen very often, but well, maybe it does. I don't this church. I hope it doesn't. If it does, I don't know about it, but I've seen it sometimes. Now, that's that's what my parents went through. Actually, I'll just share that. Uh because uh because my dad had his uh different ideas. Um he he would always tell my mom, "You love the church more than you love me." But my dad didn't realize, well, he realized it, but my mom was supposed to go to church. My dad was saying, "Stay at home." And so my dad would accuse my mom of not uh of loving the the church and the pastor more than him. But he he knew he knew he was wrong. The Bible says we should gather more as we see that day approaching. Amen. Where two or three are gathered, there I am in the midst of them. So I saw that in my family growing up. But see my my mom of course she was right by going to church but she was wrong in other things just like my dad was wrong on other things. Now now but for us let's get back to the scripture that if any man obey not the word. Okay so in a marriage if the husband doesn't obey the word they may also without the word be one by the conversation of the wives. Okay. Now the word one means to gain or acquire to win someone over to the kingdom of God. So they can gain faith in Christ. So a a believing wife can win over her husband to loving God in Christ by her conversation which is her conduct and her behavior. Sound familiar? We just preach on Corinthians, right? 1 Corinthians 7 says, "A sanctified woman sanctifies her husband and the children." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In other words, that woman, if she's living godly, she won't bring sin and make the husband and the children more sinful. Her presence and her hatred for sin makes them more holy &gt;&gt; just by she just by her not allowing sin in the house. &gt;&gt; And same thing about a godly man who has a wife that doesn't believe. That man will sanctify his wife and children just because he's a godly man. And he won't allow he won't speak evil to them. He won't abuse them. You know, he won't say verbal abuse or anything like that. They're more closer to God and sanctified because of his faith. Now verse two, while they behold your chase conversation coupled with fear. Now chase means reverence, sacredness, purity from carnality, immaculate or clean. So if a husband or wife is living living true to God, but the other spouse isn't, especially the woman, the Bible said here, she must be so chased, she must be so clean before God that the husband will pick on pick up on it and say like, "Wow, she's living clean before God." And in time, by God's grace, if that if that husband is elected to salvation, if he's predestinated to eternal life, it will cause him to be won over to the faith. Right now, we saw this in Lima a few years ago. Now, since uh there was a sister who came in the message, followed the Bible teachings of Brother, her husband hated it, fought against it, but then he got cancer and died. But a couple years before he died, he actually got saved. Now, he never accepted everything we believe, but his heart was totally softened and he got saved before he died. And church, you know what his reason was? Because his wife and daughters and son live so holy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've seen it. In other words, I've seen it. I've heard it. &gt;&gt; Your holy life will impact your spouse. It'll sanctify them because you live different. Yes. Yeah. The children, too. Yeah. Yeah. Anyone that's around you. Yeah. Now, 1 Corinthians 7 is just about the husband and wife and the children in one house. But yeah, anyone you live with, brother. Yep. Anyone live with like maybe a sister, brother. Anyone that would live with you, as long as you're serving God, it will sanctify them. In other words, they won't have to deal with any demons on you because you got the Holy Ghost. You're living pure. That's right. Now, uh, let me move on here. Well, let me let me go back to verse one. Let me just say this. In other words, women women can win over their husbands without the word. In other words, they women don't preach at their husbands. They live the life. They preach the life. I'll say like that. &gt;&gt; They don't preach with their words. They preach with their life or they just live the life. Maybe I shouldn't use the word preach just so people don't misunderstand. A woman doesn't preach at her husband with her words. She just lives the life with a chase conversation, a holy immaculate immaculately clean life. Brother Brother gave the example. Brother Chris, you ever hear brother tell this story? He said a sinner was married to a Christian. He was down at the bar drinking with two men and these two men started talking about Christians. They said, "There's never been a Christian. There's no such thing as a Christian. They're drinking, getting drunk." And the man in the middle finally says, "Stop. No, there is." They're like, "Who is it?" "My wife." "No way. I don't believe you." They said, "Let He said, "Yes, she's a real one. She's a real believer." "No, she's not. She's just a pretend." "No, let's go down. I'll prove it to you right now." So, three drunk men go down to the house and he and he told his friends, "Now, watch this. I'm going to get mad at her and she's not going to get upset." He walked, he said, "Honey, give me some eggs. Where's my food? Bring it to me now. Bring it right now." And she walked over, made it as quick as she could. She brought it over. He said, "Watch this, guys." She He took the plate and she said, he said, "YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE MY FOOD LIKE THIS. NOW, WHAT KIND OF IT what kind of treatment is this? I'm supposed to be your husband." And he said, "Now, boys, let's walk out. let's go into the living room. She'll make me some more food." And he said, "Now watch her." Brother Ram said she went over and she got down on the ground, started picking up the pieces, and she started saying, "Should Jesus bear his cross alone and all the world go free? No. There's a cross for me to carry. I'm sorry. There's a cross for him to carry and there's a cross for me." And the and the man looked at his two friends said, "See, there's a real one." And brother Ram said she led all three of them on their knees and they got saved right there in that kitchen. And the church said, "Hallelujah." Because they never they always they thought Christians were all hypocrites &gt;&gt; that if you get mad at them, they'll get mad at you. And she chose not to get upset. Amen. She didn't preach at them. Amen. SHE LIVED A LIFE IN FRONT OF THEM. IN OTHER WORDS, SHE LIVED FORGIVENESS. &gt;&gt; When she was mistreated, she didn't she didn't bite back. She didn't revile. She forgave them. And she said, "This is my cross to bear, church. WE HAVE CROSSES TO BEAR. HALLELUJAH. BUT LET'S LIVE HOLY AND we'll impact the people we love." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like I was telling brother Chris, there are so many in my family when we first came in the message, they hated it. Never ever would I thought they would come. But now that person, some of you know what I'm talking about. Now that person will come to our church and even put on a skirt and tell me how much she loves my preaching. And one time she sat through a two and a half hour sermon I preached in Napoleon and said I loved every minute of it. I thought God is moving. Hallelujah. What's going on? Two and a half hours. Brother Chris I preached. And she sat there the whole time saying it. I like this. But hated it for 15 or 16, maybe 17 years. hate it FOR ALL THOSE YEARS. BUT CHURCH, YOUR LIFE WILL SPEAK LOUDER THAN ANYTHING YOU CAN SAY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; The love and the forgiveness and the patience will speak louder than anything you can try to get mad and try to prove something wrong. Try to prove somebody they're wrong and you're right. Now, there can be times, of course, you can speak the word to your family. I'm not saying you're you're not. Now, the woman shouldn't re shouldn't uh preach at the husband, right? That's what the Bible says there. Now, can the woman give the husband a word from the Lord? Yes. Remember uh in Genesis when Genesis 21 when Sarah told uh Sarah told Abraham, "Cast out Hagar and Ishmael. Cast out the bond woman." Abraham's like, "What are you talking about?" Abraham went and talked to God and God said, "Hearken unto Sarah, for in this way she's right." So, see, if the woman does give a word, well, the husband, well, I'll take this before the Lord. Let me see what the Lord tells me. And that can show unity that can bring unity in a marriage as well. But it has to be a word from the Lord or a leading of the Lord. Right? All right. I'm at 40 minutes here. I'm going to try to maybe five minutes here. All right. Now, I want to deal with this here. Recently, I've been studying uh on family. Let's go to 1 Timothy 5 67 and 8. 1 Timothy 5:67 and 8. Church, it's so important to keep sin out of the house and out of your family. Now, verse six is speaking of a widow woman who instead of serving God and praying and fasting, she marries some sinner man just so she can have money. I'm just paraphrasing it. Other words, she chooses to lose leave the church just so she can have some money and a husband. Now, in that day, it was a hard thing to be a widow because women couldn't have jobs like men and own property like men. So, it was a really big thing for a widow to stay a widow and uh to wait on God for a godly husband. It was it was a really difficult thing. But the Bible said, "She that liveth in flesh," in other words, a woman, a widow woman in the church who marries a sinful rich man just for money, the Bible says she's dead. Wow. She's alive. There's a real zombie for you right there, brother Chris. That's where the word That's where Satan got zombies from the word of God. Because they're alive, but they're dead in their souls. They're dead in sins and trespasses. But you and I, we're not dead. We've been quickened by the word. Amen. THE BIBLE SAID, "YOU WERE DEAD IN SINS AND TRESPASSES, BUT NOW HE HAS QUICKENED YOU." HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO, WE'RE NOT DEAD. WE'RE NOT WALKING DEAD PEOPLE. WE'RE WALKING LIVING PEOPLE. HALLELUJAH. And these I'm sorry and these things that I'm sorry these things give in charge that they may be blameless. Now verse eight is where I want to go. That if any man provide not for his own. So you have a husband and wife with children. If that man doesn't provide for his children especially they of his own house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel. &gt;&gt; Now think of how bad Eli was. Eli provided for his children physically but not spiritually. &gt;&gt; Right? So what did the Bible say? He was guilty of iniquity and he dishonored God because he didn't make them he didn't make them do less sin because he had the he he had the opportunity. He could have made them do less sin. &gt;&gt; But here's what struck me as I was studying this week. Any man who doesn't do that is worse than what could be worse than an infidel? The only thing worse than an infidel would be a blasphemer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now I could be wrong in this. This is not doctrine. I'm just saying it seems to me that a a man who won't provide spiritually and physically for his wife and children is second worst thing you can possibly do outside of blasphemy of the Holy Ghost. I'm not saying that's doctrine, but that's the way I can see it right now. GOD SO LOVES THE FAMILY. AMEN. God so honors the marriage covenant. The church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Because you don't just get you so don't vow to each other. You vow to God. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God so hates that. God so hates divorce. God so hates a man that will leave his wife and children and won't provide physically and spiritually. Paul says he's worse than an unbeliever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And remember Eli. Eli provided na naturally, but he didn't provide spiritually. So God was against him. He was fighting against God. So even if a father, we'd say, or a mom would provide physically, that doesn't mean as much. You have to provide spiritually. You have to train the child in the way that they should go. Right? Proverbs 22:6, train up a child in the way he should go, and when he's old, he will not depart from it. Everybody understand by God's grace. &gt;&gt; So, not only do I have to give food to Malachi and Acacia and Caris and all the all my not only that, that's only part of it. That's half of it. &gt;&gt; The other half is I have to show them the gospel. I have to correct them if they need it. Hallelujah. I got to help them get away from sin and get closer to God. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's just as important if not more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, both are important. Can everybody see that? By God's grace. &gt;&gt; Because if not, you can be like Eli. Right. Now, Eli's one of them. Cain. Cain's the opposite. Cain went away from the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, of course, I'm focusing more spiritually on Cain, but he physically left the presence of God and all none of his family was ever in any spiritual things. Right. You have all these examples. But the real man of God, the real family, the real husband and wife of God, they will provide naturally for their family and spiritually. What does that mean? Well, then you go to the house of God. You you take your family to the house of God and you train them up in the things of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. God is good. And since sister Naomi walked in, I just appreciate how she brings her family to the house of God every time the doors are open. Let's give her a round of applause. Amen. That's right. Amen. Hallelujah. So, it's worse than an infidel to not provide naturally and spiritually. We see it in Eli's life because what? What is it? It's iniquity. That's right. Now to me it's the second worst sin that I can find out outside of blasphemy of the Holy Ghost. You're worse than a inf well infidel is probably going to blasphe, right? But a person who knows better that was part of the church or heard the word of God to not provide physically and spiritually is worse than that. Is worse than a person over at the bar right across this the street there whether he knows about the gospel or not. Right? That man who knows better and doesn't provide both, he's worse than that sinner. That's right. Amen. Now, I'm closing with this here. Uh, I'm at 45 minutes. All right, Lord. What time you got to get up tomorrow, man? Oh, you got the day off tomorrow. Well, glory. Amen. Hallelujah. I'm free now, Brother Jose. Amen. I can preach. Amen. No, I'm always free. I'm just joking. Let me just encourage you now, church. If there's a situation where a father, mother's not doing their part, don't be too discouraged. God will step in and provide. Psalm 68:5. And I can say this in my life. My dad left me when I was 12 or 13. Psalm 68:5. A father of the fatherless and a judge of the widows is God in his holy habitation. So if there's no father there or no mother there who becomes father mother God said I'll step in and I'll do it because the one who doesn't provide it is worse than infidel God says so I'll send someone into God sent coaches into my life sister Naomi when my dad went out um my best friend named Brian his he started inviting me over all the time his dad became like a father figure to me it's like God put godly men father figures my pastor growing up was a a father figure to me. My uncles came to my games. Father God God God brought in other people as well. But God's the one who really stepped in and said, "I'm going to take fatherhood over this. &gt;&gt; I will do it. &gt;&gt; I'm the father to the fatherless." And the church said, &gt;&gt; "It's either wrong or it's right, church. &gt;&gt; It's right." &gt;&gt; Now, that don't mean you don't got to pray for it. You still need to pray for it. &gt;&gt; But trust the Lord. Uh Isaiah 40 verse 29. Isaiah 40:29. I think I'm reading that right there. Now church, if you ever get faint, don't don't be discouraged. The Bible said he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases their strength. And the church said &gt;&gt; now a single mother we say or a single dad all you know so much stress so much so much so many requirements so much on you I feel faint I feel like I don't have strength God says I'll GIVE YOU STRENGTH I'LL PROVIDE IT WHEN YOU'RE WEAK. AMEN. LET THE WEAK SAY I'M STRONG. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; LET THE POOR SAY I'M RICH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; God promises I'll provide it. Just wait upon the Lord. Now he didn't say how long you got to wait but you got to just wait in faith. because he's the high priest of your profession. Hallelujah. I read today. No, I'm sorry. I saw it today. Corey Tenblum. Am I saying that right? Boom. Tboom. I said bloom. Boom. She was a uh Christian woman, right? And she was in Germany during World War II. The Nazis were taking all these Jews away. Church, I'm just talking about waiting. Think about this thought about waiting. She would bring Jews in to protect them from the Nazis. When they'd hear the Nazis walking down the hallway, she had a hiding place, but in the walls, they had 70 seconds to hide all the people in this tiny little space. They had one little pot to use the bathroom in. Some of them had to wait in there 47 hours silently until the Nazis left in a room and they have to share a pot and go to the bathroom. They still got the pot in there. I'm talking about waiting on the Lord. and she saved hundreds of Jews lives. And this is a natural thing. Now, church, if they can wait that long just to save their natural life, what about us with the spiritual life? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Other words, help us to wait on God. And that's why I'm preaching this tonight. I think it'll help you to wait on God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God said, "I step in." If there's a a man or a husband or wife not doing something right, God says, "I'll step in. &gt;&gt; I'll be the father to the fatherness. I'll be the mother to the motherless. Now go to verse 30. What context is this, brother Jesse? Oh, you're gonna like this one. Even the youth shall faint and be weary. Everybody know which verse is next. And the young men shall utterly fail, but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. In other words, God says when you're weak, just wait on me and then I'll give you just the strength you need at just the right time. &gt;&gt; And then pretty soon you have so much strength, you'll forget you were tired. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says you'll run. Now you can run. And now you don't get tired BECAUSE GOD STEPPED IN. GOD ANOINTED YOU. GOD SENT HIS SPIRIT TO PROVIDE STRENGTH FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. The promises of God are yay and amen. I'm almost done. Second Timothy 15. Notice Paul doesn't say uh Timothy. Wow. Uh your dad had such faith. He doesn't say that. His dad was a Greek. Who's how did faith or how did faith come into Timothy's life? Remember Paul SAID NOBODY IS LIKE-MINDED as me except that Gentile Timothy, the one I had to go circumcise. Huh? Who's most like me? Is it the Jews that knew the the Old Testament law or is it this gentile young man, this young pastor who does the work of evangelists as well? Paul says, "When I call to remembrance the unfeign." Now, that means sincere. No mask on his faith. Well, I'm trying to believe. I'm just trying to make it. No, church. He had genuine faith. I'm going to make it by God's grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter what I go through, I'm going to make it. &gt;&gt; I've got faith in Jesus Christ. No matter who leaves me, no matter HOW MANY PEOPLE REJECT ME, I BELIEVE IN JESUS. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I I said I I remember your unfamed faith which first it was in your grandmother Lois and thy mother Ununice. And I am persuaded it's in thee also. Who's the one that invested in Timothy? It was his mom and his grandma. &gt;&gt; But no doubt God was right there as well. God was being a father to Timothy. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God gave him a grandmother and a mom that loved the Lord. Church, I was reading through some of my old newspaper magazines. Z likes to Where's Z? He likes to look at my old magazines when I was high school. I was a sinner in high school. Even when I was a sinner in high school, when I was 17 years old, they interviewed me after we won the state championship. And they said, you know, uh, how does your family do this? You know, and I said, I have a wonderful Christian mother. I wasn't even saved. And I knew the whole secret to my success was my mom's prayers. I had been hit enough times in the head, brother Chris, to know that if there's anything good to come out of MY LIFE, IT WAS MY MOM THAT LOVED ME. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Not my dad who left me. I was, as much as I love my dad, and I forgiven him. BUT IT WAS MY MOM. And I text her last night. I said, "Mom, thanks for never leaving me." She said, "Oh, hun." She said, "I'm just trusting the Lord." I like that. Amen. I'm just trusting in the Lord. Well, me, too. Hallelujah. I'm just trusting in God. And her SANCTIFIED LIFE SANCTIFIED MY LIFE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And now the faith of my mom, I believe, is in me, too. Hallelujah. See, Timothy's spiritual formation is traced back to faithful women, not a daddy. So, that means he had a heavenly father that was watching over him. If his natural dad wasn't there, spiritual daddy was there because I'm a father to the fatherless. And I gave you a grandma and a mom that helped develop real faith in your life. And they restrained I'll say like this. They restrained Timothy. Right. Try to keep parents try to keep them from doing as much sin. Try to keep as much sin out of their lives as possible. GO TO ANY LENGTHS to keep sin out of their lives. Don't become an Eli. &gt;&gt; That's right. go to every lengths to keep sin out of their lives. So, so, so they can be a Christian and they can have they can have confidence with Christian character. That's what we want to be in our church. Christians who have confidence in God because God has developed character in their life. Like I said, remember I said last week, I said we don't look at brother Rod and say, "Wow, you know, brother God gave Brother Rod the gift of character." No, he he has got that character through victory of prayers &gt;&gt; and reading the word of God and confessing sin and pleading the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He just wasn't born with that. Nor are you and I born with character. We've got to go through the hard times. We got to have our faith tested. Amen. IT'S MORE PRECIOUS THAN THAT WHICH GOLD PERISHES. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Let's do one more. All right, let's uh finish with faithful good old faithful verse here. Well, you know what? I'm sorry. Let me go to Let's go to Psalm 25. I'm gonna close with Psalm 25. I got like numerous verses here. Let me close with Psalm 25. Uh verse 9, Psalm 25:9. Remember, Eli trembled at the ark. He trembled at the presence of God, but he didn't tremble at the sin in his children's life. Now, we should do both. We should tremble at the ark. The presence of God. People are emotional. The presence of God. I feel the Holy Spirit's here. We should tremble at that. But we should tremble when we see sin in the church as well &gt;&gt; and get it out. If not, if we let the sin continue, we honor those sinners more than we honor God. And then God will I'll say like this. The Bible said he'll take away our candlestick. Brother said, "That's your pastor." Or that's the church. He'll just take the whole church and the pastor out of the city or out of the location. All right. Psalm 259. The meek will he guide in judgment. Who does who does God guide with the the right judgment? The humble. And the meek will he teach his way. Go to verse uh 10, 11, 12. All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth. Amen. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Well, Jesse, you know, my the paths in my life are pretty hard." Well, the Bible calls them mercy and truth as well. All let's all say all. Can we all all your past? It's God's mercy to you. It's God's truth to you. unto such as keep his covenant. See, we got to keep it. And his testimonies. So covenant is the word. Testimonies are the things he's done in your life. Keep testifying of what God has done. Hallelujah. God did this for me. God did that for me. God's done this. God's faithful. Don't be discouraged. Just keep telling people the testimonies of what God has done. &gt;&gt; Verse 11 and 12. For thy name's sake, oh Lord, pardon my iniquity, for it is great. And the church said, &gt;&gt; right? We all commit iniquities. The church sometimes we commit great iniquities. Now, God help us to keep from the murder, adultery, the major ones. What man is he that fearth the Lord? Him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose? Didn't we end last week with the fear of the Lord? Let me get that verse. This will be my last verses here. Let's stand though. Musicians can come. Let's put those verses back up. Proverbs 14:16. Quesa. So, what I'm going to end it with same thing I did last week. What confidence do you have tonight? A wise man fearthth and departs from evil, but the fool rageth and is confident. You'd be surprised how many people purposely disobey God's word and they're still confident that things are going to work out well. Impossible. A wise man fears God so when he sees evil, he doesn't walk in it or she doesn't walk in it. Go to verse 26 and 27. I'm just reviewing last week. You've been a good audience tonight. Thank you for your attention. Hallelujah. I appreciate that. In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence. So see the sinner, the worker of iniquity is confident, but the believer should have a different kind of confidence. It's the confidence of true Christian character and his children shall have a place of refuge. Now, oh, I didn't even see that. My goodness. Oh my. If the father and mother don't keep the word of God, they don't have the fear of the Lord. The children will be open season for the devil, &gt;&gt; right? Just like Eli's children, right? Because Eli didn't fear God. What happened? His children got they the children got into sexual sins. They got into the obesity. They got into stealing the things of God because Eli didn't fear the Lord. Hallelujah. The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life to depart from the snares of death. Amen. Church, how many you want to have confidence with real Christian character tonight? God sees those hands. Let's have a word of prayer. I trust you were blessed tonight by God's grace. That might be my last part in this series. We'll kind of see. I've got numerous other series I want to preach, but for tonight, let's bow our heads. Dear Lord Jesus, we want to have the fear of the Lord tonight. The fear of the Lord departs from evil. The fear of the Lord is strong confidence. Lord, I felt led to look at the family here tonight. So, I trust that the Holy Spirit now will strengthen our families, God. Lord, I remember I preached that sermon, training and restraining years ago. It is our duty to train the children, make sure they develop good habits, and then also restrain them when they do evil to make it less. Do whatever we have to do to lessen their sins. And then we'll be honoring God. Lord, you see the families in our little church here, Lord. You see the families of those listening online, dear God. I know numerous people look to our archives and our live streaming, Lord God. So, I just pray that the word that was preached tonight, may it fall on good ground. Hallelujah. Which Jesus called, Lord Jesus, you called it an honest heart. May everyone who heard this sermon be honest with what they've heard. And if they're obeying it, may they rejoice and keep the fear of the Lord with strong confidence. If they've sinned against God or if they're tempted as a snare to disobey the word of God, may they run from that wickedness. Grant, Lord Jesus. That's my prayer, Lord God. May the mothers, fathers, husbands, and wives, may they honor God above everything else, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Keep us from loving. Keep us from compromise, Lord God. Hallelujah. Keep us in the word of the Lord. Grant it, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. And let us remember that you're the father of the fatherlessness. Hallelujah. You're the mother of the motherless. Hallelujah. You said you never leave us nor forsake us. You said all things work together for good to them that are the called according to thy purpose. That's what you said. You said the faint would get strength that increases and if they wait on you, they'd rise up like an eagle. That's what you said, Lord God. We choose to believe the word of God. We choose the fear of the Lord tonight. We want to be alive while we live, not dead while we liveth. Dead in sins and trespasses. Oh God. Hallelujah. Let's be quickened by the Holy Spirit, quickened by the word of God to live every word that we know. For Lord Jesus, you told us, Lord, the more we know, the more responsibility that we have. It is required that a steward be found faithful. Lord, we are stewards of the mysteries of God as Paul tells us. God, let us be found faithful. Let us live such holy, sanctified lives that other people will be sanctified by our lives. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. We worship you tonight, Jesus. Bless your people for their attention, their devotion to the word of God. Strengthen the home church, I pray. Keep us unleavened, hallelujah, in your presence. Thank you for the word we've heard last weekend and tonight. Lord God, bless the saints in the house, Lord, tonight in Jesus Christ's name. And the saint said,
