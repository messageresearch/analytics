[3:56] Christ's name and the Saints said amen
[3:58] God bless you you being SE praise
[4:02] God so I want to look at uh the message
[4:04] of Grace part six I was ready to preach
[4:06] you know this part I thought I'd get to
[4:08] David last week but I didn't even get
[4:09] through Moses I really didn't get
[4:10] through all of Moses but I I might go
[4:12] back to Moses I think I maybe one more
[4:14] part on this you I don't understand you
[4:16] know I guess God just doing something
[4:18] you know because when I preached uh uh
[4:21] that first uh sermon um I only have
[4:24] taught two parts on it you know I I
[4:26] think serpent seed I only preached maybe
[4:27] two parts on it but for some reason I
[4:29] can get get you know six and seven
[4:30] sermons out of this one I don't know I
[4:32] guess it's just the it's the need of the
[4:34] people I imagine you know uh we just
[4:36] need we need God's grace Hallelujah I
[4:38] imagine it would just be that um trying
[4:40] to think of the previous title I can't
[4:42] think of the previous title but um oh
[4:43] yeah even perfect Faith just two sermons
[4:45] on that you know but uh we know if we
[4:47] have confessed our sins we can have
[4:49] perfect faith if we have confessed our
[4:51] sins and God makes something known to us
[4:54] then we just have perfect faith it might
[4:56] be something on the job it might be a
[4:58] relationship uh it might be finances uh
[5:01] it might be just personal healing or
[5:03] Victory or whatever uh if we can confess
[5:06] our sins and we're walking in the light
[5:08] as he's in the light then the blood of
[5:10] Jesus Christ cleanses us from all
[5:12] unrighteousness and he can give us a
[5:14] leading right give us a word and then we
[5:16] can have perfect faith in that word amen
[5:19] what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to
[5:20] take all the mysticism from around that
[5:22] that that thought you know I'm just
[5:24] talking about in my life too you know uh
[5:26] and I think around the message you know
[5:27] people they think of perfect faith and
[5:30] like oh it's got to be something like
[5:31] the prophet of God it don't have to be
[5:32] just like that it just has to be you
[5:35] getting a word from God and then you
[5:37] believe God's word that's all had just
[5:39] that simple right the Bible said not all
[5:41] our Apostles not all our prophets not
[5:43] all our pastors not all our
[5:44] deacons everybody's got a place
[5:46] Hallelujah but everybody can have God's
[5:49] word hallelujah for their life so I just
[5:51] thought I just I don't didn't really
[5:53] plan to say that but amen anyhow
[5:54] Hallelujah so we even looked at Adam and
[5:56] Eve Noah Abraham Israel's a nation we
[5:59] looked at Moses I might go back there's
[6:00] maybe one more thought on Moses there
[6:02] but I don't want to get to that tonight
[6:04] and even last week I was very careful
[6:06] what I said with our visitor here our
[6:08] our Paige you know our good friend Paige
[6:10] right I was very careful I didn't want
[6:11] to use brother Bram too much so like uh
[6:14] like Paul said when Paul was here Paul
[6:16] Griffin he said you know when I see a
[6:17] visitor come in I maybe I'll take a
[6:19] little or I'll I'll say things
[6:21] differently you know because I don't
[6:22] want everything to go over their head
[6:25] right and so I tried to do that last
[6:26] week I I didn't maybe read all the
[6:28] quotes from brother Brandon because I I
[6:29] didn't want to uh you know I I didn't
[6:32] want to just maybe overemphasize that in
[6:35] in her sight for you and I it wouldn't
[6:36] be overemphasized because we understand
[6:38] his place in the scripture but with a
[6:40] visitor like that I just felt led to you
[6:42] know use less
[6:44] quotes you know just to uh make us not
[6:47] seem so
[6:49] odd but yet we're oddballs amen
[6:52] hallelujah we're oddballs every
[6:54] Christian always is a
[6:55] Oddball so I'm I'm jumping to David and
[6:58] like I said I had I had most of this
[6:59] ready last um Wednesday but I will let
[7:03] you know the parts as I was driving home
[7:05] today I was getting milk today and I was
[7:07] driving home and the Holy Spirit brought
[7:08] this thought back two years ago I heard
[7:10] a sermon on
[7:12] bitterness and I remember oh there was a
[7:15] part in there about David I knew I was
[7:16] preaching on David tonight uh I I I I
[7:20] relate so much to David you I can relate
[7:22] so much uh you know just wanting to be a
[7:25] just wanting to be a man after God's Own
[7:27] Heart Right yet suffering Temptation and
[7:31] so forth like that and um you know
[7:33] wanting to be victorious who doesn't
[7:34] want to be a Victor who doesn't want to
[7:35] take down
[7:37] Giants I mean Mercy there there's so
[7:40] much we love about David but as I was
[7:42] driving home the Holy Spirit must have
[7:44] brought this back because I haven't
[7:45] thought about this sermon uh on
[7:47] bitterness for two years I couldn't find
[7:50] it in my first search but then I went
[7:51] and found that part and so I'll let you
[7:53] know there's a little part in there I'm
[7:54] going to add in uh and I'm going to give
[7:55] the credit where the credits do it
[7:57] wasn't my thought it was from this
[7:58] brother from Canada
[8:00] so I just love how the Holy Spirit
[8:01] that's how I know it's the holy spirit
[8:02] because I'm not looking for it and then
[8:04] God will bring me thoughts like I was
[8:07] telling William I think I told I don't
[8:08] know if I told amen or Austin but last
[8:11] uh Saturday before the service I was
[8:14] studying and it's like a thought dropped
[8:16] down from heaven and it was two words
[8:18] secret believer and I was like that's a
[8:21] strange thought brother brandom said
[8:23] that and so I went and studied it
[8:24] there's 20 quotes on it so I got a
[8:26] sermon waiting to preach maybe Sunday
[8:27] I'll preach that one but it's that's a
[8:29] moment like I'm not thinking of that and
[8:31] something just drops down that's kind of
[8:33] how it was today that's how God does it
[8:35] with uh any gift you know something you
[8:37] just comes to you it's God coming to you
[8:39] Hallelujah right no man sought God right
[8:43] God's drawing Us in Hallelujah even when
[8:45] we seek God it's really By Invitation
[8:47] God's drawing Us in it's not like oh I'm
[8:50] such a holy Christian I'm going to seek
[8:52] God well no it's God drawing you into
[8:54] Fellowship praise God hallelujah we know
[8:56] we understand that but I want to look at
[8:58] David tonight uh one of of our favorite
[8:59] characters and if I always tell people
[9:01] if you haven't seen that David movie
[9:02] that's the best movie I've ever seen in
[9:04] my life I know I'm young I'm a young man
[9:07] I'm not an old
[9:10] man that's the best movie I've ever seen
[9:12] even my uh uh my brother shared that
[9:14] with my dad my dad loves that movie
[9:16] because it's a story of
[9:18] redemption I love how it focuses on the
[9:21] fall and then the Redemption at the end
[9:23] it's just a beautiful story no wonder so
[9:25] many people can connect to David because
[9:27] we all fall short of God's glory so
[9:29] brother Braham starts on this section he
[9:31] says whatat could we say of David now
[9:32] remember he just preached through all
[9:33] these people with Grace right he chose
[9:35] certain people by the leading of the
[9:36] Holy Spirit remember this remember this
[9:39] whole sermon brother Ram said was to was
[9:41] to prove that God was with his message
[9:43] of Grace just like God was with his
[9:46] message of the godhead where he saw the
[9:48] three rainbows brother said just like
[9:50] that God gave me this message on Grace
[9:53] and over the years I'm sure if you've
[9:55] listened to different ministers maybe
[9:56] brother Jose over the years I've been
[9:58] the message you know 20
[9:59] uh basically 22 years uh I've heard so
[10:04] many preachers preach out of the message
[10:06] of Grace it's it's a very often quoted
[10:10] sermon because I believe because of that
[10:12] brother Braham brought such a great
[10:14] balance on the grace of God right I mean
[10:17] and next week we'll even look at some
[10:18] other statements he makes like you can't
[10:20] bargain for God's grace what an amazing
[10:23] statement like Esau tried to bargain for
[10:25] it well was tears he tried to get it
[10:27] back and God's like no you weren't
[10:28] called for this
[10:29] right you sold it out you know and and
[10:32] so like just amazing facts and then uh
[10:35] the one we we closed with last uh
[10:37] Wednesday night where brother randam
[10:39] said I hope my obituary or he said I
[10:42] hope my commentary about my life is just
[10:45] like Abraham's when God writes it that I
[10:48] didn't stagger at the promise of God
[10:51] that God only saw what I'm trying to do
[10:54] Hallelujah that's what I want written
[10:56] about my life God didn't see that mess
[10:59] up that mess up that mess up God will uh
[11:02] throw those in the sea of
[11:05] forgetfulness thank God for the sea of
[11:07] forgetfulness
[11:08] Hallelujah I guess that's why there'll
[11:10] be no more sea we won't need any more
[11:11] forgiveness of sins because we'll have
[11:12] brand new bodies Hallelujah that just
[11:14] struck me there hallelujah what can we
[11:16] say of David the grace of God that great
[11:19] warrior to whom God himself said he's a
[11:22] man after my own heart that great
[11:24] warrior David how could he do such a
[11:27] thing as he done to take your right his
[11:29] Soldier when he had a handful of
[11:31] Gentiles out there as
[11:33] soldiers listen close to this little
[11:36] story just for a moment he says he says
[11:38] when they had their soldiers out there
[11:40] and Uriah was the one who stood by Dav
[11:42] remember he was I said yuah was a
[11:44] proelite he was a hittite remember even
[11:46] Hittites were not to come to the
[11:49] Tabernacle right God said no hittite no
[11:52] no no Pro no no moabit could come there
[11:55] for 14
[11:56] Generations but see that was hyperbole
[11:59] right right because if they got
[12:00] converted then they could come in right
[12:03] Ruth was a moabitas she came in to
[12:05] worship because she was a proelite amen
[12:09] see so that means a unrepentant
[12:12] hittite a hittite that rejected God's
[12:14] grace a moabit that rejected the grace
[12:16] of
[12:20] God he was a proelite to the Jewish
[12:22] religion and them them men loved David
[12:26] so much I'll say like this we love
[12:28] Christ so much
[12:29] Christ is our David Hallelujah that's
[12:32] what he says next they seen the
[12:34] anointing was upon him although he was a
[12:37] fugitive he was oued out from his own
[12:40] country he had to live with the
[12:42] Philistines Saul was hunting him but yet
[12:45] those men they saw the anointing upon
[12:47] him they knowed he was coming into Power
[12:49] Glory to God now look what brother man
[12:51] says next he takes a spiritual
[12:53] application of this he says I'm so glad
[12:56] to be a fugitive
[12:57] today because I see that Christ is
[13:00] coming in to be
[13:01] king amen remember I can't remember
[13:04] exactly what it said about those uh
[13:06] those men that came to him in the cave
[13:07] they were all debtors the Bible
[13:10] said we had a debt we could not
[13:13] pay Hallelujah but Jesus came and washed
[13:15] that dead away Hallelujah so brother man
[13:18] puts himself as one of those Mighty Men
[13:20] eventually they became Mighty Men but
[13:21] they weren't Mighty Men At first amen
[13:24] Moses became a Meek man but he wasn't
[13:26] Meek at first Hallelujah but God molded
[13:28] him into a Meek man God molded David
[13:31] into a man after his own heart
[13:32] Hallelujah that's right he said he said
[13:36] you can elect all the kennedies and I'll
[13:38] say this the
[13:39] trumps and whatever more you want but
[13:43] Christ will be
[13:44] king the anointing is upon him and upon
[13:48] the me his message of his coming amen
[13:52] the the anointing is on the message of
[13:54] the pre-tribulation Rapture Hallelujah
[13:57] the anointing of God is on that
[13:58] Hallelujah
[14:00] and he'll be king brother Bram said he
[14:02] said what they do one day he was
[14:04] standing up there thirsting for a drink
[14:06] of water now I'm not going to read this
[14:07] tonight but you remember the Bible from
[14:09] the gate out there at Bethlehem when he
[14:11] used to go out there to her the sheep
[14:12] and you know what two of those men took
[14:14] a sword and cut through 15 miles of
[14:17] human flesh to get him a bucket of water
[14:20] because his greatest I'm sorry because
[14:22] his least desire was a commandment to
[14:25] them think of that and they cut through
[14:27] those men all the way to the top of that
[14:29] mountain to where they said he was
[14:31] standing it'd be about 15 miles they
[14:34] went through there and every man raised
[14:36] up they'll duel with him till they
[14:38] killed him went on through and took his
[14:42] bucket and got a bucket of water right
[14:44] through the enemy's line two men to get
[14:45] their King their brother a drink of
[14:47] water when he had the water there to
[14:50] drink but he wanted that water so it's a
[14:53] special request from the King and these
[14:56] men wanted to meet the king's special
[14:58] request Hallelujah he said oh God now
[15:01] now now brother makes himself one of
[15:03] those Mighty Men see he I like that he's
[15:07] placing himself in the
[15:08] scripture he said oh God let me take the
[15:11] sword of the word and cut through every
[15:15] organization to bring now to bring what
[15:17] now look what he's going to make the
[15:18] water to bring the baptism in the name
[15:21] of Jesus
[15:23] Christ that's the drink Jesus wants
[15:25] tonight
[15:26] Hallelujah he wants us to keep baptizing
[15:29] people in the name of the Lord Jesus
[15:31] Christ that's the water Jesus wants a
[15:33] drink
[15:37] of I love this amen he said and the
[15:40] power of the resurrection and the Holy
[15:42] Ghost back to the people because he's
[15:45] coming into
[15:47] Power he's coming into Power he'll stand
[15:49] alone but it's cut through every
[15:51] organization cut through every Theory
[15:53] every man-made Creed until you bring the
[15:56] Savior back a sheep that's gone astray
[15:58] somebody bring back the Bible doctrines
[16:01] again that's what I'm doing
[16:02] amen of Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[16:05] today and forever he says the grace of
[16:08] God hallelujah so whatever part you
[16:10] whatever part you have in there to get
[16:12] people baptized in the name of the Lord
[16:13] Jesus Christ to get them filled with the
[16:15] Holy Ghost in their soul Hallelujah to
[16:17] bring back Bible Doctrine amen whatever
[16:19] part you play You're the you're the a
[16:22] mighty warrior bringing that drink

[16:27] have a good drink of it amen whether
[16:30] it's win Soul whatever it is that's you

[16:38] through every enemy uh Power in order to
[16:41] bring Jesus what he wants Hallelujah he
[16:44] wants so saved amen he wants the power

[16:56] new Believers like brother Nia come up

[17:16] water there's a baptism they got in the
[17:18] Old Testament a a transformed mind and
[17:21] there's a baptism of the soul I said
[17:23] brother Nea you keep pressing in until
[17:24] you get all three I said I know you got
[17:26] one of them amen I I like that amen just
[17:30] keep feeding them the word of God that's
[17:32] what they need amen they need God's word
[17:34] hallelujah and when we draw people in
[17:37] with that we're actually bringing that
[17:38] water to Jesus our David hallelujah
[17:43] amen he said look at David how could he
[17:46] have
[17:47] done he said but then he he jumps back
[17:49] to the Mighty Man one of them jumped
[17:51] into a pit and killed a lion I think
[17:53] that was BAH if I'm not mistaken that's
[17:54] where Cam got that name cam kept that
[17:56] name secret for all those years he's
[17:59] like I didn't want to tell anybody that
[18:00] name I'm going to use that name for my
[18:02] son I'm like good brother good thought
[18:04] there not many Banias out there there's
[18:07] quite a few
[18:08] Malachi I love that name well when I saw
[18:11] my when I saw Malachi it me my messenger
[18:13] I was like God make him a
[18:15] messenger and we brother man said we all
[18:17] carry the message I'm not trying to
[18:19] pressure him to preach you know I
[18:21] already put enough pressure on the boys
[18:22] to preach around here you know uh but
[18:25] just when I saw that like ah so I like
[18:26] how cam you know saw that he's a might
[18:29] man how could David take 's wife that
[18:32] beautiful basba when he had 500 of his
[18:35] own now there just so you know there is
[18:37] no verse that says he has 500 wives the
[18:39] most I found was I think nine if I'm not
[18:41] mistaken nine or eight my wife might
[18:43] remember you remember how many wives
[18:46] okay oh seven okay it might be seven
[18:48] yeah might be seven but it was less than
[18:49] 10 that they actually list them they're
[18:51] listenting in the
[18:53] Chronicles um of course we know Dave I'm
[18:55] sorry Solomon had uh 300 wives 700
[18:58] concubines so the Bible actually lists
[18:59] that but just
[19:02] FYI but he seen her taken a bath and
[19:05] there's the
[19:07] negligence now brother man says but she
[19:09] just forgot to pull the shades down when
[19:11] she was taking her bath and know that
[19:14] King made a trip there by there every
[19:16] day down over that wall now that's not
[19:19] exactly in the scripture either I I
[19:20] don't know if brother R read that from a
[19:22] commentary or uh brother B did read uh
[19:25] biblical fiction right um he talks about
[19:30] it Prince of the House of David brother
[19:31] am read it if you can look up the quote
[19:34] and the Messiah there there's other
[19:36] books he read uh that were biblical
[19:38] fiction so they they you have the Bible
[19:41] story but then they just add details to
[19:42] make it a really good story Lamplighter
[19:44] does that like with Titus comrade of the
[19:46] Cross that's a Biblical fiction story so
[19:49] I'm just letting you know uh alls the
[19:51] Bible says about basba why don't we just
[19:53] read it it's uh 2 Samuel 10
[19:58] what what I've seen is that God showed
[20:00] Amazing Grace to bash Sheba and that's
[20:02] what I like about Sight and Sound you
[20:04] know not that really do any matters I
[20:05] just I just don't want to put anything
[20:06] on basba if she wasn't guilty of it you
[20:08] know like if the Bible don't say it then
[20:10] I just want to I don't want to put much
[20:11] on our sister we're going to see her
[20:13] someday we're going to shake her hand
[20:15] that's our
[20:20] sister it was verse uh two and it came
[20:23] to pass in an evening time that David
[20:24] arose from off his bed and walked upon
[20:26] the roof of the King's house and from
[20:27] the roof he saw a woman walk Wasing
[20:29] herself and the woman was very beautiful
[20:31] to look upon so it doesn't and then
[20:33] David sends for her she didn't you know
[20:36] the Bible doesn't give us any clues
[20:37] about her fault right and the fact she
[20:41] had four Sons a son was a very great
[20:43] blessing in the Bible the fact she had
[20:45] four four is Deliverance right Fourth
[20:49] Man of the fire uh it looks like God
[20:52] delivered her from what David influenced
[20:55] on her because God puts all the judgment
[20:58] on David okay so just just just so you
[21:01] know that that's what brother says
[21:02] brother says she was negle NE negligent
[21:04] to pull the shade down okay I I don't
[21:08] know now but you look at it you know
[21:10] like uh look at it you know like you
[21:12] would think if she lived there she could
[21:14] look up and see the king's you know
[21:15] Palace or whatever more you know just we
[21:18] just we don't want to add to the word of
[21:19] God okay so uh brother Ram then after
[21:24] says that brother talks about how women
[21:26] today they're not negligent they
[21:27] purposely take off their clothes I'm
[21:29] talking about evil women not our
[21:30] precious sisters God blesses you with
[21:32] the spirit of temperance amen hallelujah
[21:36] well brother man said he gets into that
[21:37] and uh uh how they're causing men to
[21:40] lust after them Jesus said whosoever
[21:42] lookth upon a woman to lust after her
[21:44] hath committed adultery with her in his
[21:46] heart already he says remember Sister
[21:48] you'll answer for committing adultery
[21:50] though you never done it actually in all
[21:52] your life but that sinner looked at you
[21:54] the way you dressed be guilty of
[21:56] adultery because remember you have to
[21:58] have a Spirit to wear those kind of
[22:00] clothes because you know and I know me
[22:03] too one time I told you this story one
[22:05] time I was walking around I was a
[22:07] football player I was walking home
[22:09] without my shirt on and these girls R by
[22:10] in a Jeep and they did I'm like who's
[22:13] whistling of me what no world they did
[22:15] the wolf whistle at me and I'm like oh
[22:18] maybe I should put some clothes
[22:20] on right you know it just in other words
[22:23] I know everybody knows if we take off
[22:26] clothes it's a sin and the church said
[22:28] amen it's a sin everybody has that oh
[22:31] what am I doing but you know when they
[22:32] start young they just get used to it and
[22:34] they they uh they get calloused what's
[22:37] the Bible say they lose their feeling
[22:39] they've lost feeling for
[22:41] it says
[22:43] uh she be she you'll answer the day of
[22:46] judgment for committing
[22:50] adultery and uh he he'll say look here
[22:53] look on my book it says committing
[22:54] adultery with who Mrs John Doe then Mrs
[22:57] John Doe what about that
[22:59] and she'd say well you know you I swear
[23:00] you know my record I never live with
[23:02] another man but my own but the angel
[23:04] answer her back but you dress yourself
[23:06] till you cause this man to commit
[23:07] adultery and you're guilty of adultery
[23:10] with him that's when he done it you are
[23:12] to blame you was the one that presented
[23:14] yourself now remember I always remember
[23:15] this verse and I don't want to forget it
[23:17] that's why I love going through the
[23:18] Bible over and over uh Proverbs uh I'm
[23:20] going to keep my spot there Proverbs
[23:24] 7:10 okay
[23:26] y I think that's the verse
[23:29] oh you're so fast bless your heart and
[23:31] behold there met him a woman with a tire
[23:33] of Harlot and a subtle of heart this has
[23:36] been written in the Bible for over 4,000
[23:38] years I'm sorry 3,000 years because this
[23:41] is by Solomon right yeah Solomon 3,000
[23:43] years that means it's just common
[23:45] knowledge right everybody knows when you
[23:47] take off your clothes it's a spirit of
[23:49] lust right and then I believe God will
[23:52] even show the secrets that was in that
[23:54] woman's heart the reason she dressed
[23:56] like that why did she dress like that
[23:57] not just cuz her husband wanted her to
[24:00] she wanted to as
[24:01] well right because we know people that
[24:03] do we love them but they have to have a
[24:05] willingness in their heart to do it
[24:07] don't they right because if they really
[24:10] wanted to be modest they'd be modest
[24:11] because the Holy Spirit would make you
[24:15] modest
[24:17] Hallelujah not didn't really plan to
[24:19] preach that either by God's grace
[24:23] Hallelujah now brother man says basba
[24:25] done wrong just like Eve done wrong and
[24:27] I like how uh they kind of did it on the
[24:29] Sight and Sound it's almost like he
[24:31] David forced bash Sheba into it like she
[24:33] just didn't have a choice I mean it was
[24:35] either death or go to David's Palace the
[24:38] King's
[24:40] house but really she should have chose
[24:42] to die and David probably would not have
[24:43] killed her anyway I don't know who knows
[24:45] maybe he would have I don't know but in
[24:48] other words you always have a choice
[24:50] like we were talking about remember all
[24:51] those marriage questions a few weeks ago
[24:53] there you always have a choice if you're
[24:54] an adult you have a choice death is a
[24:57] choice right
[25:00] because you have a choice am I going to
[25:01] live with a pure heart or an unpure
[25:03] heart a clean conscience or an unclean
[25:06] conscious we always have the choice
[25:09] right he said but basba done wrong just
[25:12] like Eve done wrong but Adam was
[25:13] included in it I think we're always Hing
[25:15] about women too now look what he says
[25:17] you sons of God so now he rebukes the
[25:20] men and the sister
[25:22] said I like brother Ram said uh he said
[25:25] you ought to uh you men ought to love
[25:27] your wives and he thought sister I
[25:29] forget the name of the sister he say
[25:30] sisters I thought I should have heard
[25:31] some more amens from you on
[25:35] that he said you sons of God men I know
[25:39] you're the strongest Bunch that's right
[25:41] the strongest sex you're over the women
[25:43] that's true so act like it but says
[25:45] don't overpower them to try to take some
[25:47] little girl ruin her life but be a Son
[25:49] of God tell her she's in the wrong and
[25:51] stand like a Son of God she's your
[25:53] sister yes
[25:54] sir he says what we try to do what
[25:56] so-called sons of God today belong to
[25:59] churches and take out every little girl
[26:01] they can like boys today will try to
[26:02] date every girl they can Brothers
[26:04] blasting the boys with their lustful
[26:06] Spirits right he says remember that's
[26:09] because uh there's an immoral woman may
[26:12] may be uh because some married man
[26:14] ruined her too so pot can't call kettle
[26:16] black in other words there's women that
[26:18] are guilty there's men that are guilty
[26:19] they're all guilty Hallelujah that's the
[26:21] point he's Mak it so just remember it's
[26:24] sin that does it all and we're all
[26:25] subject to death and should die for it
[26:30] when David did that evil thing look at
[26:31] listen this remember this I love this
[26:33] his own judgment should have killed
[26:37] him David judged himself even though he
[26:40] didn't know he was doing it he was
[26:41] judging himself guilty of
[26:45] death when that Prophet came up there he
[26:47] thought it was hid when that Prophet
[26:49] came up there and stood before him he
[26:51] said David is everything all right he
[26:52] said everything's fine 2 Samuel 11 right
[26:57] David in his high robes in his big crown
[27:00] and he had joob out there that great
[27:01] General and all the fighting going on he
[27:03] was keeping all the enemies off the
[27:04] borderlines and things and everything
[27:06] was going right he had a a baby by this
[27:08] basba and had poor little Uriah go out
[27:11] there and had joab stand by his side
[27:13] until he withdrew from him and the boy
[27:16] died when the son went down with a
[27:18] battle knife in his hand blood on his
[27:19] shield where he had stood for Israel yet
[27:21] a proelite he was to their religion
[27:24] think about that he left the P Pagan
[27:26] religion to come into the True Religion
[27:27] and the true religion is what killed him
[27:29] that's called friendly fire right that's
[27:32] called Friendly
[27:34] Fire he
[27:38] says joab came back and he says David
[27:41] thought well everything's all right now
[27:43] I've got his wife and everything will be
[27:44] all right got a baby but the baby took
[27:46] sick the baby started dying and he done
[27:49] everything he could to save the baby's
[27:50] life perhaps every doctor came no good
[27:53] finally the baby died there was afraid
[27:55] to tell David that the baby was dead and
[27:56] he died then he thought everything was
[27:58] hid so he comforted bash Sheba he had
[28:00] already taken her to be his wife after
[28:02] all those other wives and that old
[28:04] Prophet old baldheaded fellow of
[28:06] something I don't know why he always
[28:07] calls prophets
[28:08] baldheaded but it's I think a dramatic
[28:11] uh a dramatic act right he's trying to
[28:13] make it more dramatic he always said
[28:14] Paul had a big hook nose kind of
[28:18] thing he said old Nathan out of the
[28:20] woodness sat down and said David how's
[28:21] everything going and David said fine
[28:23] fine old prophet of God live forever
[28:27] Hallelujah oh he was just he thought
[28:29] everything was fine he thought he could
[28:31] hide it brother man says but you can't
[28:33] hide from
[28:36] God that's what we all need reminders of
[28:38] right we none of us can hide anything
[28:41] from God I think I said it on Sunday
[28:43] after the service but U brother brand
[28:45] said your thoughts are louder in heaven
[28:47] than your words are on earth that's how
[28:50] much God knows our
[28:52] thoughts right but he I was even quoting
[28:55] this scripture I think uh Sunday where
[28:56] was it uh
[28:58] Sunday night maybe maybe Monday on the
[29:00] drive the Bible said I will keep him in
[29:03] perfect peace whose mind is stayed on me
[29:05] I was like God give me the right
[29:07] thoughts Hallelujah help me to think the
[29:09] right thing I have a choice I can live
[29:10] in peace or I can leave or live in war
[29:12] right I can live in Temptation or I can
[29:15] live in peace peace of God cover me
[29:17] hallelujah amen hallelujah oh prophet of
[29:21] God live forever Hallelujah he was
[29:23] acting all religious but you can't hide
[29:25] from God he knows what you're thinking
[29:26] right now he knows your thoughts for
[29:28] he's God that Holy Spirit that's in the
[29:30] building this morning knows your
[29:32] thoughts who you are where you come from
[29:33] what you've done for Jesus Christ is the
[29:35] same yesterday today and forever God had
[29:38] revealed it to that prophet he said
[29:40] David there's a Rich Man live on this
[29:42] side of the road he had a whole lot of
[29:44] sheep oh he's very rich a man lived on
[29:46] this side of the road was poor had one
[29:47] lamb he treated like a daughter he fed
[29:49] it out of the same spoon he eat with
[29:51] that's like Simon eats from the same
[29:53] cups that his dogs eats from right
[29:56] that's the kind of love that he has he
[29:58] slept with the lamb everything was it
[30:00] was like a daughter to him and one day a
[30:01] visitor come so instead of the rich man
[30:04] taking one of his own sheep and making a
[30:05] feast for the visitor instead of that he
[30:08] went over and took the poor man's Lamb
[30:10] by force took the lamb and slay it and
[30:12] made a
[30:14] feast now that was David's
[30:18] passions see remember you got the three
[30:21] so what did David battle lust of the
[30:23] eyes lust of Flesh pride of life right
[30:28] think about I was thinking about this
[30:29] one think about uh Uzziah what did
[30:31] Uzziah Uzziah was that great king he was
[30:33] one of the greatest Kings of all but
[30:34] what was his battle pride of life he
[30:36] said I can be a I can be a preacher I
[30:38] can be a priest he went right into there
[30:39] and he got
[30:41] leprosy so what I'm saying is that Satan
[30:43] Works in all three channels and all
[30:45] three are equally
[30:46] bad right but every sin has
[30:50] repercussions Hallelujah that was
[30:53] David's passions he had 500 wives but
[30:55] when he seen uriah's wife instead of
[30:57] taking one of his 500 wives to appease
[31:00] or satisfy his passions he went and took
[31:02] another man's wife and killed Uriah when
[31:04] she become a mother David didn't know
[31:06] what he was doing why he was ready to
[31:08] pronounce judgment now he didn't know
[31:10] what he's doing when he's speaking
[31:10] judgment on
[31:12] himself that's the way we are now like
[31:14] this that's the way we are and the
[31:15] church said that's the way I am that's
[31:19] the way you are we can always judge the
[31:23] other fella but when it comes to us oh
[31:26] that's different
[31:30] Hallelujah church I'm talking about your
[31:32] sin nature right I'm not talking about
[31:34] your soul
[31:35] Amen in your flesh or even sometimes in
[31:38] your mind if your mind's not renewed if
[31:40] you don't renew it every day if you
[31:42] don't renew your mind you'll think the
[31:44] worst
[31:46] thoughts and you and you might have done
[31:48] the very same thing but you'll put some
[31:50] judgment on somebody else that wouldn't
[31:52] be the same you'd put on
[31:54] yourself that's why Jesus said like
[31:56] brother MCB was preaching when you stand
[31:57] stand praying and
[31:59] forgive if you want to be
[32:01] forgiven right how many want to be
[32:05] forgiven David didn't realize see
[32:07] because he still had this he had there
[32:08] it is he has unconfessed sin like
[32:10] brother Dennis preached the last time uh
[32:13] hiding a sin right secret sins see see
[32:17] see when when when we when we have
[32:18] unconfessed sin it creates this uh like
[32:21] like a blinders on us right and we don't
[32:23] we can't see our real spiritual
[32:25] condition Hallelujah
[32:28] that's right that's the way we are
[32:30] always ready to pronounce judgment but
[32:32] not on ourselves David said this man
[32:35] will pay with his
[32:36] life that old Prophet them eyes narrowed
[32:39] down he said David surely you'll not die
[32:42] he said you're the
[32:43] man right you're the man that you just
[32:46] pronounced judgment
[32:47] on watch Grace there go to work right
[32:51] quick
[32:53] Amen in the hour when we deserve
[32:55] judgment I pray and I I ask that God
[32:58] will show us Grace in the hour where we
[33:00] deserve judgment
[33:01] Hallelujah that's what David got instead
[33:04] of God's judgment God gave him
[33:07] Grace God gave him Mercy although he in
[33:10] his own judgment remember the word of a
[33:12] king is absolute in his own judgment he
[33:14] should have he should have uh he should
[33:16] have died
[33:18] right and that was according to I I
[33:20] forget the chapter I think it's
[33:21] Leviticus 20 I can't remember the exact
[33:23] might be Leviticus 20 something you
[33:24] don't have to look it up on but I was
[33:26] reading in uh the says any adulterer
[33:29] should be stoned any murderer should be
[33:31] stoned there's two
[33:33] verses right he should have been killed
[33:36] on two
[33:37] accounts but God gave him
[33:40] Grace and the only reason I can think
[33:42] why is because God had to fulfill things
[33:44] through him in the rest of his life
[33:47] there was still work for him to do and
[33:49] also my wife found that verse U sent it
[33:52] to me the Bible makes it sound like this
[33:55] is the only major sin David ever
[33:58] committed that means think about that
[34:00] the rest of his life every other thing
[34:01] he did was really small like we'd say
[34:04] minor brother man tells us there's major
[34:06] sins there's minor sins I made a video
[34:08] of that earli this year that was really
[34:09] well received because people need to
[34:11] know that and with different kinds of
[34:13] sins are different
[34:15] consequences and so it's like David just
[34:17] did all minor sins can you imagine a
[34:20] life like that H God make us like that
[34:22] amen I told you this before I see all
[34:25] these preachers bigname preachers and it
[34:26] seems like every one of them had just
[34:28] one thing that you know I don't want to
[34:31] go through that I want to I I just want
[34:33] to have minor sins amen if God if God
[34:36] needs a like Brother Ray told us if God
[34:39] needs to protect me in a real small
[34:40] Church to do that then praise the Lord
[34:42] amen I'll be happy to be a bational
[34:45] pastor amen I'll be I'll be happy to
[34:47] work my tail off and not and and uh you
[34:49] know not not have many uh uh you know
[34:51] not have a full-time pastorship I'll be
[34:53] happy just keep me from sin amen help me
[34:56] to magnify the name of Jesus may I bring
[34:58] no reproach upon this glorious name that
[35:00] saved me
[35:02] Hallelujah First Kings 15:5 because
[35:05] David did that which was right in the
[35:07] eyes of the Lord and turn not aside from
[35:09] anything that must be major that he
[35:12] commanded him all the days of his life
[35:13] because the Bible said we sin every day
[35:14] right we have to Die daily this must
[35:16] mean in major sins he never turned aside
[35:19] except one time in all the days of his
[35:21] life save only in the matter of Uriah
[35:24] the hittite imagine that testimony
[35:27] there's only one major thing what a what
[35:29] a
[35:31] testimony like I can think of the
[35:32] biggest name message preachers I can
[35:34] find at least one on all the well except
[35:37] for maybe one every other preacher has
[35:39] one major thing like or maybe two I
[35:42] guess the more I think about I probably
[35:43] find more that's good what what I've
[35:45] noticed though is with a lot of them
[35:47] there is something major in every one of
[35:49] them but God help us to live such a life
[35:52] where we don't fall into any major sin
[35:56] now what was this adultery murder major
[35:58] sins
[36:01] right God help
[36:03] us he said watch he said David you'll
[36:06] surely not die that's Grace going to
[36:08] work right quick the spirit struck the
[36:11] prophet and saved David's life amen so
[36:14] so Nathan might have been walking up
[36:16] there to tell him he's going to die but
[36:17] brother man said right at that moment
[36:18] the Holy Spirit struck him and said
[36:19] David you'll not die amen God's giving
[36:23] you Grace in this uh murder and hiding
[36:26] of sin and and adultery I'm giving you
[36:28] Grace but you'll suffer for
[36:32] it let's read
[36:36] it verse 10 now therefore the sword I'm
[36:39] sorry 2 Samuel 12:10 sorry 2 Samuel
[36:43] 12:10 now therefore the sword shall
[36:44] never depart from thine house because
[36:46] thou has despised me and has taken the
[36:48] wife of Uriah the hittite to be thy wife
[36:50] thus sayith the Lord behold I'll raise
[36:52] up evil against thee out of thine own
[36:54] house and I will take thy wise before
[36:57] thine eyes and give them unto thy
[36:58] neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives
[37:01] in the sight of this son for thou did it
[37:04] secretly but I will do this thing before
[37:06] all Israel and before the son talk about
[37:09] a
[37:11] punishment talk about a punishment he
[37:13] brother B said like he had all those
[37:14] wives he could have just took his
[37:16] passions with one of the wives but he
[37:18] didn't he stole another man's wife God
[37:21] said because of this someone will lay
[37:23] with your wives and publicly because you
[37:26] did a private sin so see that church I
[37:28] know we talked about secret sins right I
[37:31] just I just want private sins that don't
[37:33] go publicly David had a private sin that
[37:35] went publicly right we just want small
[37:38] private sins and the church said and by
[37:41] God's grace try to walk out of those
[37:43] amen try to live above those by the
[37:45] grace of God
[37:48] Amen just have little things that you
[37:55] battle verse 13 love this and David said
[37:58] unto Nathan I have sinned against the
[37:59] Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord
[38:01] shall also put away thy sin Thou shalt
[38:03] not die God think about that God put
[38:06] away murder can you imagine that God put
[38:09] away
[38:11] adultery it just reminds me last week
[38:14] three times God could have killed Moses
[38:15] he killed a man God put murder
[38:18] away he didn't circumcise his son he
[38:21] should have died for that God put that
[38:23] away church we serve a God who believes
[38:26] in Amazing Grace Hallelujah amen we know
[38:28] we serve a God who authors Amazing Grace
[38:31] Hallelujah then brother R said he could
[38:33] have died because of uh you know smiting
[38:35] The Rock instead of speaking to it God
[38:38] could have smoted him there but there
[38:39] was a consequence he had to wait about
[38:41] 1500 years to get in the promised land
[38:43] but he got there Hallelujah because
[38:45] God's a god of Mercy hallelujah amen
[38:48] because God won't disappoint us amen God
[38:50] won't let us down Hallelujah God sees
[38:53] all of our labor of love amen God sees
[38:54] our years and our decades God sees our
[38:57] labor love and God's not going to forget
[38:59] all that you do for him Hallelujah
[39:01] that's right Amen
[39:06] Hallelujah
[39:09] by and the prophet said surely you'll
[39:11] not die you'll not die David because
[39:13] Grace has saved you it was Grace at
[39:16] David that saved him brother R says oh
[39:18] my if it hadn't been for Grace where
[39:20] would we all be and the church
[39:23] said what if ever think about that what
[39:25] if your life was written in the Bible
[39:27] like that
[39:28] and some of your mistakes some of my
[39:30] mistakes were written in the Bible and
[39:31] everybody had to read about my mistakes
[39:33] so I I think I feel pretty little don't
[39:35] you everybody had to know all my
[39:38] mistakes but God allowed it
[39:41] right so see we must
[39:43] remember that God had Grace for each and
[39:46] every person and if God had Grace for
[39:48] that God has Grace for
[39:50] us hallelujah if it hadn't been for
[39:53] Grace where would we all
[39:55] be and I love what brother man says
[39:57] Sovereign Graces from a sovereign
[39:59] one he says Sovereign can do whatever it
[40:02] wants to that means God doesn't take
[40:04] anybody else's opinion he does what he
[40:06] wants to do so brother's defending how
[40:10] God forgave David God can do that
[40:12] because God's Sovereign he can do
[40:13] whatever he wants amen he can have mercy
[40:16] on the vessel he can make vessels of
[40:17] Mercy vessels of Honor or he can make
[40:19] vessels of
[40:20] Dishonor he can do whatever he wants you
[40:22] don't have to ask anybody amen so that's
[40:25] why we should pray God have mercy mer on
[40:27] me may I be a vessel of Honor Hallelujah
[40:30] let your mercy be on my vessel
[40:33] Hallelujah especially when I make
[40:34] mistakes Hallelujah especially when I
[40:36] fall short of God's glory let God have
[40:38] mercy on
[40:40] me he said Sovereign can do whatever
[40:43] once Sovereign Grace can only be given
[40:45] by one that's Sovereign and God's
[40:47] Sovereign so he can give out his
[40:49] Sovereign Grace and he said Sovereign
[40:51] Grace doesn't have to ask anybody it
[40:54] don't have to it does what it wants to
[40:56] isn't that wonderful God don't have to
[40:59] ask can I do this or shall I do that can
[41:01] I must I will I it doesn't do it it does
[41:06] it itself because Grace is Sovereign
[41:08] therefore he can save the viest he can
[41:11] save the worst he can save the impur he
[41:14] can save the immoralist and he he can
[41:16] heal the sickest brother said Hallelujah
[41:18] he said he can save a Wretch like Me and
[41:21] what is it it's Grace William brandom a
[41:23] drunker son that don't make any
[41:25] difference the grace of God save
[41:30] me hallelujah praise
[41:33] God he says I'm a son of a drunk man but
[41:37] God's grace could extend to me
[41:39] hallelujah hallelujah I think about what
[41:42] I'm the son of sometimes too my poor
[41:44] father but I'm just praying for grace I
[41:47] I know there's going to be Grace I know
[41:49] there has to be Grace there has to be
[41:52] God has to hear my prayers amen if I'm
[41:54] his beloved I'm just believing in God's
[41:56] grace I'm believing in secret
[41:58] Believers Hallelujah that's what I'm
[42:00] believing
[42:01] amen I'm believing there's secret
[42:04] Believers out there they won't come to
[42:05] church like I was telling brother
[42:06] William I was basically preaching the
[42:08] half of my sermon to him right standing
[42:09] out right out there after service
[42:11] brother let me preach to you you got a
[42:12] few minutes here let me preach my
[42:14] sermonette to you by God's grace he's
[42:16] like Oh Glory you know how he says it oh
[42:19] praise the
[42:21] Lord oh good I'm getting a good test
[42:23] here you know the church going to like
[42:24] this message or not it don't matter I'm
[42:26] preaching
[42:27] anyway God showed it to me I studied
[42:30] myself approved I'm going to preach it
[42:32] anyway I lost my train of thought but
[42:36] praise God God is gracious yeah they
[42:39] they might they might not come to church
[42:42] they might not uh they might not like
[42:44] your posts they might not like your
[42:45] videos they might not ever tell you they
[42:47] got saved but it's between them and
[42:49] God we don't know what happens between
[42:51] them and God that's why brother R said
[42:54] there's going to be surprise on the day
[42:55] of judgment because of secret believers
[42:57] people we never knew we thought they
[42:58] went to hell we never knew they secretly
[43:00] confessed their
[43:02] sins right and that's the group with the
[43:05] six acts in Matthew 25 they said Lord
[43:08] when did we do this see there they were
[43:10] secret Believers when do we when did we
[43:11] see you Jesus they didn't even know they
[43:14] weren't deep enough in the I'm already
[43:16] preaching my sermon for Sunday praise
[43:19] God they didn't know they didn't have
[43:21] enough Bible knowledge to know that
[43:22] Jesus Christ is in his
[43:25] bride like they they didn't know that
[43:27] it's Christ in you the whole they didn't
[43:29] even realize when I went to visit this
[43:30] True Believer When I visit them in the
[43:32] hospital they got sick or when they
[43:35] didn't have food and I fed them I was
[43:36] actually feeding Jesus
[43:38] Christ and so see what are they they're
[43:40] saved by grace because they were already
[43:42] a secret
[43:44] believer and just like on the thief of
[43:46] the Cross all they have to do it think
[43:47] think of that they just have to say in
[43:49] their heart God forgive me Jesus Is
[43:51] Right their their Way's right Lena's
[43:53] right Kristen's right Jose's right I
[43:55] can't live it like them but they're
[43:56] right God the the they serve the true
[43:59] God and if they say that in their heart
[44:00] and they say Remember Me Jesus will
[44:02] remember them Hallelujah because he's
[44:03] the same yesterday today and forever
[44:06] hallelujah amen he proved it right there
[44:08] on the cross without baptism without the
[44:10] Holy Ghost without nothing just a secret
[44:14] believer who in God's
[44:16] mercy just wanted to be remembered in he
[44:20] just wanted to be remembered in Mercy
[44:32] David he gave a judgment on himself 2
[44:35] Samuel 12:6 and he shall restore the
[44:38] lamb fourfold because he did this thing
[44:41] and he had no pity he was talking about
[44:48] himself and I heard a preacher preaches
[44:50] this not my
[44:51] Revelation I'll tell you when it's my
[44:53] Revelation well I'm sorry not mine but
[44:55] when God gives it to me personally like
[44:56] with this the serpent seed in the Seven
[44:57] Seals I'll tell you what that those are
[44:59] just special
[45:01] moments but in David's judgment he needs
[45:04] to restore fourfold what he
[45:08] took this four-fold judgment God poured
[45:12] out on
[45:13] David remember that his four sons died
[45:17] terrible deaths four of his sons died
[45:19] terrible deaths because he killed
[45:22] Uriah it was first that baby 2 Samuel
[45:26] 12148 that first son the baby
[45:29] died because he pronounced judgment on
[45:33] himself and didn't Jesus say judge not
[45:36] that you be not
[45:39] judged so see God is the same yesterday
[45:41] today and
[45:43] forever the baby died even though David
[45:46] fasted prayed and he knew God could
[45:48] change God God can give another word
[45:49] right God can give another thus say the
[45:51] Lord it'd be the permissive will of God
[45:54] right we know that from hezekiah's Life
[45:56] second amn
[45:58] amod Dishonored and I'm saying that in a
[46:00] very general
[46:02] way wickedly Dishonored his half sister
[46:05] Tamar and then he was murdered by
[46:08] Tamar's
[46:09] brother but but amnon was David's son
[46:13] two sons murdered I'm sorry one died one
[46:17] Mur third Absalon was
[46:20] murdered Absalon won the hearts of the
[46:23] people right smooth talking I called a
[46:25] preacher on the internet I said you're
[46:27] you got an Absalon Spirit he's smooth
[46:29] talking people he calls me the Pharisee
[46:31] from akan I call him you got the Absalon
[46:34] Spirit you're a false prophet stealing
[46:36] people out of churches to do internet
[46:39] church I'm sorry you that's not
[46:40] scriptural you have to gather more as
[46:42] you see that day
[46:43] approaching sometimes you got to call
[46:45] him out Jesus called him out
[46:48] sometimes God revealed that to me while
[46:50] I was praying that's why I did that God
[46:52] revealed that to me while I was praying
[46:53] and reading my Bible he'd attacked me
[46:56] and I'm like I I was just waiting to get
[46:57] back at him now not in a bad way but I'm
[46:58] waiting to say what I what I believe and
[47:01] God gave me that I I read oh that's I
[47:03] was praying I read it I'm like there it
[47:04] is right there there it is he's got the
[47:06] Absalon Spirit lording over other
[47:08] people's sheep it's exactly
[47:11] right and remember Absalon was
[47:13] successful with his overthrow of David's
[47:16] Kingdom remember
[47:17] that David fled right and Absalon
[47:21] occupied Jerusalem he was finally
[47:23] anointed king of
[47:25] Jerusalem uh remember he lay with
[47:27] David's wives on the tent in front of
[47:29] everybody in front of everybody he took
[47:30] each one all the people could see him
[47:32] each one take one in at a time because
[47:35] of what David did in secret but then
[47:38] after David was out in the woods you
[47:39] remember this abson went out there to
[47:41] try to kill him he was going to kill his
[47:43] own
[47:46] father he says uh but absalon's forces
[47:49] were totally defeated and while he was
[47:51] trying to escape his long hair entangled
[47:53] him his Beauty entangled him just like
[47:56] Lucifer
[47:59] he got entangled he was lifted up
[48:00] because of his beauty of his heart and
[48:01] that's why brother Bram says oh yeah one
[48:03] of my girls heard uh I think it was
[48:05] Haven or Carris one of my girls I was
[48:07] listening to brother brandom and brother
[48:08] brand said beauties of the devil and
[48:11] they said Daddy is beauty of the devil I
[48:12] said well you got to understand it you
[48:15] know I said was it you Haven yeah and I
[48:19] had to say oh and I understand that's a
[48:20] great question that's a great question
[48:22] it's not a sin to be beautiful it's a
[48:24] sin to make yourself uh
[48:27] uh to make yourself immodest and what
[48:30] and be beautiful according to the
[48:31] devil's
[48:34] standards and people attack brother B
[48:36] for that shame on them they just don't
[48:37] they just take him out of context they
[48:39] just take them they just don't keep
[48:41] reading they just they don't they stop
[48:43] reading right they splice his quotes to
[48:44] their own shame and
[48:47] Folly but look he got entangled because
[48:49] of his so-called
[48:52] Beauty he was left hanging while the
[48:54] mule rode off
[48:57] he was dispatched by
[48:58] joab uh and then he oh yeah yeah then he
[49:03] was killed yeah that's right he was
[49:04] killed while he was hanging he's think
[49:05] about that he's he's got these beautiful
[49:07] hair he's hanging there in the tree and
[49:10] he gets shot and killed and that's how
[49:11] he dies that's number three he
[49:13] pronounced a four-fold judgment on
[49:15] himself the fourth one you might
[49:17] remember this one is
[49:19] adonijah this is the one I needed more
[49:21] reminding on I'd forgotten about him he
[49:24] was the fourth after the death of amnon
[49:27] chileab and abson he became the eldest
[49:31] son and then when DAV was getting older
[49:33] strength was declining he tried to take
[49:36] the crown remember that he tried to take
[49:37] it from Solomon remember
[49:41] that and then remember he ran for Mercy
[49:44] right he took hold of the horns of the
[49:46] Altar and Solomon gave him Mercy but
[49:50] then uh after the death he begged for
[49:53] basba uh so he could marry abishag who'
[49:56] been the wife of David in his old age
[49:59] this was regarded as being equivalent to
[50:01] a fresh attempt on the throne because
[50:05] she was she had to she spent that time
[50:07] with David as a wife he's trying to take
[50:09] the wife of the former
[50:11] King so it is equal to trying to take
[50:14] the throne because he's trying to take
[50:15] the wife of the king the previous King
[50:19] and there uh Solomon ordered him to be
[50:20] put to death by bah there we go another
[50:22] bah
[50:25] there so remember the the Bible says God
[50:27] will not be
[50:29] mocked whatever a man SWS that shall he
[50:34] reap right and he pronounced judgment a
[50:36] four-fold judgment that's what he
[50:39] got right and as Jesus said judge not
[50:43] that you be not judged that's why I love
[50:46] even brother Dennis we I preach it over
[50:47] the years too he said what was the best
[50:49] thing Jesus said on the cross father
[50:50] forgive them they don't know what
[50:52] they're doing Stephen did the same thing
[50:56] think about that even before those
[50:57] stones started deforming his head think
[51:00] about think about how those peaches get
[51:02] deformed that's what his head was like
[51:03] you know you squeeze a peach but before
[51:06] that he'd already fallen asleep
[51:07] hallelujah praise God going home to see
[51:10] Jesus Hallelujah and before think about
[51:12] that before the first th Stone hit him
[51:14] he'd already say forgive these people
[51:16] for now what would you think if someone
[51:17] had a gun at you and they're about ready
[51:19] to shoot you would you say oh forgive
[51:20] them I hope we would by God's grace I
[51:23] hope in that moment the spirit of God
[51:24] will give us Supreme faith for the
[51:26] Supreme hour because we might live to
[51:28] see it we don't know someone's going to
[51:29] live to see it we might have to go
[51:31] through that Christians are already
[51:32] dying in Nigeria Iran China uh
[51:36] Kenya all the hundreds of thousands of
[51:38] Christians are dying around the world
[51:39] already they already go through that why
[51:42] are we here well there must be something
[51:44] God wants us to do praise
[51:46] God but this is the faith that they had
[51:49] and God will give you faith for the
[51:51] hours uh that you needed in your darkest
[51:53] trials Hallelujah for with what judgment
[51:57] you judge you shall be judged and with
[51:59] what measure you meet it shall be
[52:01] measured to you
[52:02] again Hallelujah so however we judge
[52:05] others that's how God will judge us
[52:07] David's the
[52:09] example so how many want to be
[52:13] merciful I want to be merciful without
[52:15] being what's the word without
[52:18] compromising right I want to be merciful
[52:22] without
[52:24] compromising now it might look Mercy
[52:26] might look like compromise especially
[52:27] with David that kind of looks like what
[52:29] is going on there how could this man get
[52:31] to live a murderer and an
[52:35] adulterer like Grace is Sovereign Grace
[52:38] does what it wants God had more things
[52:40] he had to fulfill he had to keep storing
[52:42] up all the uh all the gold and silver
[52:47] and wood for the temple right and he had
[52:49] to get Solomon in there Hallelujah he
[52:52] had to do it there's his his ministry
[52:55] wasn't done yet
[52:57] right so God showed Mercy on David also
[53:00] thought this too God had mercy on David
[53:02] because David could have took Saul's
[53:03] life
[53:04] twice and God saw he said I so respect
[53:09] him I won't touch God's
[53:11] anointed that's one reason I think God
[53:13] had mercy on David he had the spear
[53:15] right there remember the movie he could
[53:16] have he could have took it right there
[53:18] he said I'll just cut off a little piece
[53:19] of the skirt of His Garment I could have
[53:21] taken your life but I'm not going to
[53:23] because I believe in Mercy amen I
[53:25] believe in Gra cuz I'm going to need it
[53:27] Hallelujah I'm going to need it later on
[53:29] and he sure did need it by God's grace
[53:35] Hallelujah church I want to look at this
[53:37] here um I had this in my notes um 2
[53:41] Samuel 12 I didn't read it yeah verse n
[53:44] wherefore hast thou despised the
[53:46] Commandment of the Lord to do evil in
[53:47] his sight so when David decided when he
[53:50] looked down there he despised the
[53:52] Commandment think about that he knew the
[53:54] Commandment don't take another man's
[53:55] wife but in that moment he wasn't
[53:57] fighting he's like I don't care what the
[53:59] Bible says I have passions and I want
[54:02] her go get her the word despise means to
[54:07] disdain I can't stand that
[54:10] command it also means to regard with
[54:13] contempt to scorn or dismiss I dismiss
[54:16] these Ten Commandments why do I have to
[54:18] follow them all the time why can't I
[54:20] just have a break from it every now and
[54:21] then he despised the command of God it
[54:26] means to to be vile to be worthless this
[54:29] these commands are worthless I can't
[54:31] stand I got to obey these all the
[54:34] time that's what happened when he got
[54:36] the comp or I'm sorry the lustful Spirit
[54:37] there it is the lustful Spirit maybe it
[54:39] was a complex too you know complex over
[54:41] a beautiful woman I don't know I'm just
[54:45] saying but this is think about that a
[54:47] mighty king who he wrote songs he
[54:49] praised god let's praise the Lord
[54:51] there's joy in the house of the Lord
[54:53] today but because of whatever happened I
[54:56] can't stand this why disre I'm
[54:58] dismissing this I don't this is a
[55:00] worthless command I need that
[55:04] woman Nathan said because you did that
[55:07] here's what's going to happen the sword
[55:09] will never leave your house David paid
[55:13] deeply for his adultery and murder
[55:15] because he despised the Commandment of
[55:16] God and I love what oh yeah even God
[55:18] said that he said because you despise me
[55:21] God said because you despise me
[55:27] where's that verse I wrote it down I
[55:29] think it was nine and 10 or
[55:33] no was it 10 yes yeah thank you Mal
[55:37] because thou despised me it was thus
[55:39] sayith the Lord You've despised me not
[55:41] only to despise the word of God he
[55:42] despised
[55:45] God now what kind of evil spirit could
[55:47] have convince him to say I have you know
[55:49] that I got to have that woman although
[55:51] I've got all these other ones she's so
[55:53] much better I got to have her than all
[55:54] these other ones the Bible said a a wife
[55:57] is like a a a a well Brothers right just
[55:59] drink from your own
[56:01] well
[56:02] right but this evil spirit come on him
[56:06] and think about that despise where where
[56:08] do we hear that word despise before Mall
[56:10] despised David's
[56:13] dancing she despised him why you got to
[56:16] take off your King's robes and wear that
[56:18] uh ephod why you got to dance like that
[56:19] naked he wasn't naked he just took off
[56:21] the king's robes he had the ephod
[56:23] on so David despises God just like Mcall
[56:27] does Mcall got the Judgment David got
[56:29] Grace amen
[56:31] hallelujah why cuz David was a man after
[56:33] God's Own Heart
[56:35] Hallelujah and it was Grace it was
[56:38] Sovereign Grace amen Sovereign Grace
[56:41] Church that's what I'm trusting in I'm
[56:43] trusting in Sovereign
[56:46] Grace because I won't make it by my
[56:48] works I'll make it by Amazing
[56:50] Grace Hallelujah no matter what mistakes
[56:52] hopefully all my mistakes are
[56:55] small God's grace I got 22 years into
[56:58] this message and all small mistakes as
[57:00] far as I understand as far as I Believe
[57:01] by God's grace now people on the
[57:02] internet might say different they might
[57:04] call me any might call me this and that
[57:06] and he's
[57:09] crazy the way you call crazy that's the
[57:12] way I worship the god of my fathers
[57:13] Hallelujah I'm just quoting
[57:17] Paul so look God had
[57:21] mercy God had Grace on
[57:25] David uh the timeline of David's life um
[57:28] he defeated Goliath around 15 to 20
[57:31] years
[57:32] old then he was a
[57:34] fugitive uh uh from 25 to 30 so about
[57:38] five years he was a fugitive no home
[57:41] from cave de
[57:43] Cate wondering am I going to
[57:46] live uh am I going to die remember he
[57:49] was so convinced he moved to the
[57:50] Philistine country and was on the
[57:51] Philistine
[57:54] Army he was so convinced that his King
[57:56] was or his father-in-law was going to
[57:57] kill him he joined the bad guys Z always
[57:59] talks about the good guys and the bad
[58:00] guys where's he
[58:02] at David joined the bad guys because he
[58:06] was so afraid that's what fear would do
[58:10] right but then he became king of Hebron
[58:13] from 30 years old to 37 at 37 he became
[58:16] king over all Israel now think about
[58:18] your age church at 47 most people
[58:21] believe at 47 is when he committed that
[58:23] with bash Sheba 10 years 10 years of
[58:26] Victories 10 years of undefeated right
[58:30] what's that song say about David David
[58:31] can't do anything right David can do
[58:34] anything this is why God made him King
[58:37] for 10 years he thinks I can do anything
[58:39] and then he thought well I can take her
[58:40] too I can do anything I despise the
[58:42] command not that one can't do
[58:47] that you'll pay for
[58:50] it two years later Tamar was ravished
[58:57] and then his son died right of course
[58:58] the first baby died amnon died two years
[59:02] later when he's
[59:04] 49 from 50 to 53 years old had the
[59:07] three-year famine now look when God
[59:09] brought it look look when God brought it
[59:10] right after he did this evil think about
[59:13] that three
[59:15] years how many of us like to go three
[59:17] years where there's not much in the
[59:18] fridge I don't think anybody would say
[59:20] Amen to
[59:22] that but he had to suffer through that
[59:25] and then he did the at 55 years
[59:29] old remember uh tens of thousands of
[59:32] people died in
[59:33] that tens of thousands people three days
[59:35] of
[59:36] famine
[59:38] right at 61 abson became King as a 61
[59:42] year old man he had to flee and Absalon
[59:46] died when he was
[59:47] 61 of course as then later he got back
[59:51] at 65 to 67 he was so exhausted in
[59:54] battle he couldn't fight anymore they
[59:56] died five to uh five to three years
[59:58] later at
[1:00:00] 70 so from 47 to 70 the last 23 years of
[1:00:04] his life the sword never left his
[1:00:07] house pain here pain here tragedy
[1:00:10] tragedy tragedy tragedy because of he
[1:00:13] despised the word of
[1:00:15] God and he acted on it remember Church
[1:00:18] there's a four-step process for sin go
[1:00:20] to James 1 I just struck me right now
[1:00:22] you got to stop it before uh it
[1:00:24] conceives
[1:00:26] you and I have to stop sin before it
[1:00:30] conceives just like the four horse
[1:00:31] riders right you got to stop it don't
[1:00:35] let it turn into
[1:00:38] action Hebrews and
[1:00:41] James verse 14 James 1:14 but every man
[1:00:44] is tempted when he's drawn away of his
[1:00:45] own lust and entice and when lust hath
[1:00:48] conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin
[1:00:50] when it's finished bringeth forth death
[1:00:53] so you have uh you have lust and then
[1:00:56] lust
[1:00:57] enticed you got to stop it before it
[1:01:00] gets to sin now we know thoughts are sin
[1:01:02] too but I'm talking about the actions of
[1:01:04] sin like David's actions of adultery and
[1:01:06] murder you got to stop it before it
[1:01:08] becomes the actual physical
[1:01:11] act right
[1:01:13] Church you got to stop it there will be
[1:01:18] consequences God will not be
[1:01:22] mocked
[1:01:24] right David paid for every or David paid
[1:01:28] the rest of his life for
[1:01:39] that I will
[1:01:41] uh yeah I'll preach one more I'm gonna
[1:01:43] preach one more thought now this is the
[1:01:45] thought I got from the brother from
[1:01:46] Canada okay this is not my original
[1:01:47] thought I heard it two years ago and I'm
[1:01:49] like I'm going to save this I'm going to
[1:01:50] put this in my back pocket for one day
[1:01:52] well today is that day I take it out of
[1:01:53] my back pocket just a beautiful
[1:01:56] thought um if you got your put up here H
[1:01:59] um geta um 2 Samuel 1623 2 Samuel 16:23
[1:02:06] I'm closing with the life of uh a hopel
[1:02:10] that's a tough name to say a
[1:02:20] hopel now look what the Bible says about
[1:02:22] him and the Council of a hopel which he
[1:02:25] counseled in those days was as if a man
[1:02:27] had inquired at the Oracle of God so was
[1:02:30] all the counsel of ayapel both with
[1:02:32] David and with Absalon so here's a
[1:02:35] mighty Gifted Man talk about
[1:02:39] wisdom think about that you ever had a
[1:02:41] friend or ever had just a moment where
[1:02:43] it's like someone told you exactly what
[1:02:45] you needed to do and it was like the
[1:02:46] wisdom of God opened it up and like
[1:02:49] there it is you just spoke the word of
[1:02:51] God to me that's how ayel was all the
[1:02:54] time he walked up and said say go do
[1:02:56] this brother he say sister you need to
[1:02:58] go say that you're like whoa it's like
[1:03:01] you've been talking to
[1:03:03] God but Church no matter what gifts we
[1:03:06] have we have to be careful to keep
[1:03:08] bitterness out of our hearts because
[1:03:11] that's what happened to him now the
[1:03:12] sermon from the brother was called
[1:03:13] bitterness right and brother Dennis
[1:03:15] preached on it and then I preached on it
[1:03:16] two weeks ago right in the other The
[1:03:18] Green
[1:03:22] Room now what is amazing church is that
[1:03:25] go to 2 Samuel 17 yeah
[1:03:28] 171 when absin comes in a h theel now
[1:03:33] now I'll get to more why later but he at
[1:03:36] at this point in the next chapter he
[1:03:37] turned on David before he gave David
[1:03:39] thus sayith the word it's like I'm
[1:03:41] talking to God wisdom wisdom wisdom
[1:03:43] wisdom all the time you have this gift
[1:03:44] of wisdom but here he turns on David
[1:03:47] we'll see why in just a moment moreover
[1:03:49] a hopel said unto abson let me now
[1:03:52] choose out 12,000 men and I'll rise and
[1:03:55] pursue after David this night I will
[1:03:57] he's like I'm going by myself I'm going
[1:04:00] to go chase that man down so he's one
[1:04:03] man chasing another man right and I will
[1:04:05] come upon him while he's weary and
[1:04:07] weak-handed I'm gonna wait till he's
[1:04:09] weary and
[1:04:11] weak and will make him afraid now look
[1:04:14] see what this bitterness does the
[1:04:16] bitterness wants to find you in a bad
[1:04:19] condition and then bring the fear on
[1:04:22] you like that's what that uh
[1:04:29] that's what that event from April did oh
[1:04:31] the identity theft I can't think of that
[1:04:32] man kind of I didn't get good sleep last
[1:04:35] night not gonna say
[1:04:37] why
[1:04:39] Zion I guess I would say
[1:04:42] why that's just
[1:04:44] Happ we had a long day
[1:04:50] yesterday see that's what the uh bitter
[1:04:53] Spirit would do and church I know what
[1:04:54] I'm talking about I had toward my dad I
[1:04:56] know what I'm talking about I've been
[1:04:58] there Hallelujah the church said I mean
[1:05:00] we all we all battle this and all the
[1:05:02] people that are with Him shall flee and
[1:05:04] I'll Smite the king only so he's like
[1:05:06] I'm going on a oneman mission I'm GNA be
[1:05:08] like a I don't know some type of a
[1:05:11] oneman army and I'll chase him down I'll
[1:05:13] wait till he's he's weak and tired and
[1:05:15] then I'll come on him I'll bring fear on
[1:05:17] him I'll both swords out or however you
[1:05:19] know whatever drama he says and I'll
[1:05:21] strike him dead and I'll kill him I'll
[1:05:22] make him afraid sounds sounds like those
[1:05:24] uh Hamas guys right they want to put
[1:05:26] fear in you before they actually kill
[1:05:28] you that's what but he now remember
[1:05:30] before all he did was talk about God God
[1:05:33] gave him exactly what to say but
[1:05:35] bitterness turned his heart away from
[1:05:38] God and now instead of giving David the
[1:05:40] word of God now he wants to bring death
[1:05:42] on
[1:05:48] David now here's the background that why
[1:05:51] this is important to this uh sermon
[1:05:53] today
[1:05:57] now in this chapter ayapel gives his
[1:06:00] advice and then another man gives his
[1:06:02] advice abson doesn't take a Hy's advice
[1:06:06] so it's like he's sad I've lost my
[1:06:08] anointing I've lost my favor he goes and
[1:06:10] hangs
[1:06:12] himself a man that was so used by God
[1:06:14] all the time to give thus say the Lord
[1:06:16] the oracles the wisdom of God he gets a
[1:06:18] bitter Spirit he wants to kill David he
[1:06:22] doesn't get the chance to he goes
[1:06:23] commits suicide
[1:06:26] now what happened to him here's the
[1:06:29] kicker in the uh Smith's dictionary it
[1:06:33] said he was a prively counselor of David
[1:06:36] whose wisdom was highly esteemed though
[1:06:38] his name had exactly opposite sign
[1:06:41] signification his his name means brother
[1:06:43] of foolishness that's what his name
[1:06:44] means brother of foolishness he became a
[1:06:47] fool because he let the spirit overtake
[1:06:50] him here it is church he was the
[1:06:52] grandfather of basba
[1:06:58] so what caused him to be bitter imagine
[1:07:00] some of you men some of you parents
[1:07:02] imagine your children have
[1:07:04] children ayapel was bash sheba's
[1:07:09] grandfather so he stood there he he knew
[1:07:11] David well he would give David all kinds
[1:07:13] of thus say the Lords right but he
[1:07:16] watched David take his
[1:07:19] granddaughter adultery and then he
[1:07:22] watched David kill his granddaughter's
[1:07:26] husband and that caused him to go
[1:07:29] against
[1:07:30] David now church I'm not saying it's
[1:07:32] easy to
[1:07:34] forgive I've told I've told everybody
[1:07:36] this I've always preached this you have
[1:07:37] to forgive but you're still going to
[1:07:39] have scars you're still going to feel it
[1:07:41] when you think about people right you're
[1:07:43] still going to think about people you're
[1:07:44] still and these are extreme sins most of
[1:07:48] us thank God most of us haven't don't
[1:07:51] have to deal with some of these things
[1:07:53] some people do but H Hy theel instead of
[1:07:57] seeking God for forgiveness and mercy he
[1:08:00] took the
[1:08:01] bitterness and he used it to try to
[1:08:04] destroy
[1:08:07] David see
[1:08:11] that so now we can see a little bit more
[1:08:13] about
[1:08:15] basba and this see this puts basiba in a
[1:08:18] very good light right because even her
[1:08:21] grandfather is trying to avenge what
[1:08:23] happened to her
[1:08:25] right that's why it doesn't seem like
[1:08:26] basba did anything wrong other than I
[1:08:29] mean she could have died right that's
[1:08:31] the only choice she had and then God
[1:08:33] will bless her later on right with four
[1:08:37] Sons they're in the lineage of Jesus
[1:08:39] Christ God puts bash Sheba in his family
[1:08:43] because God is a god of Grace let's
[1:08:47] stand to our feet
[1:08:56] and church why I bring this out is I
[1:08:57] just had my notes here he's a man who
[1:08:59] had such a close walk with
[1:09:02] God but then he became bitter against
[1:09:06] David it seems he was trying to avenge
[1:09:09] himself but remember I love the Bible
[1:09:11] says vengeance is mine sayeth the
[1:09:17] Lord this is a sermon about Grace
[1:09:20] hallelujah thank God for Amazing Grace
[1:09:24] just play marvelous Grace
[1:09:26] I think we sang that a couple weeks ago
[1:09:28] by the grace of
[1:09:35] God yeah I think I'll preach maybe one
[1:09:37] more part on this here uh Lord
[1:09:42] willing let's bow our hearts here before
[1:09:44] the Lord here
[1:09:46] today I love the story of David because
[1:09:48] it's a story of redemption it's such a
[1:09:50] warning to us
[1:09:51] [Music]
[1:09:56] is such a profound
[1:10:01] story such incredible victories in his
[1:10:05] life and then such incredible
[1:10:07] Loaves and
[1:10:11] [Music]
[1:10:12] failures but that's
[1:10:15] why God is a god of
[1:10:20] Grace David's life makes me want to draw
[1:10:23] so close to God
[1:10:26] makes you want to pray and ask him
[1:10:29] repeatedly I don't know if I'd say the
[1:10:31] word beg but I just oh God don't let
[1:10:34] me do a major sin God do everything in
[1:10:39] your
[1:10:40] power to keep me
[1:10:42] humble to protect me as brother Ray told
[1:10:45] [Music]
[1:10:48] us that could live such a humble life of
[1:10:52] [Music]
[1:10:54] Grace that I would never despise the
[1:10:56] commands of God I would never despise
[1:10:59] the word of God I'd never despise you
[1:11:01] Lord
[1:11:03] God but I would just learn to trust you
[1:11:05] like Ron
[1:11:08] hesterman he says the Lord gives and the
[1:11:10] Lord takes
[1:11:13] away we're so richly blessed especially
[1:11:16] to live in America Lord God as
[1:11:18] Christians are dying all around the
[1:11:19] world Lord God
[1:11:25] thank you for the favor you've given to
[1:11:28] us thank you for making us vessels of
[1:11:30] Honor Lord
[1:11:32] [Music]
[1:11:35] God but I believe you brought these
[1:11:37] thoughts to me Lord God today that they'
[1:11:40] be a help to the people of God your word
[1:11:42] is always inspiring your word always has
[1:11:47] [Music]
[1:11:49] life Jesus you said my words are spirit
[1:11:53] and they are life
[1:11:56] [Music]
[1:12:02] Lord I'm reminded of some key points
[1:12:05] Lord help us before we speak a judgment
[1:12:09] against someone help us Lord to remember
[1:12:12] Mercy we're so quick to judge the other
[1:12:15] guys as your Prophet
[1:12:16] said but when we judge ourselves well
[1:12:19] that's different Lord help us to be the
[1:12:21] same for everyone Lord God
[1:12:25] like Nathan to follow the leadership of
[1:12:27] the Holy Spirit Lord
[1:12:32] God Lord this is not an easy part of
[1:12:35] David's life to preach I knew it wasn't
[1:12:36] going to be a
[1:12:40] shouting maybe rejoicing message
[1:12:42] although it does make me rejoice in the
[1:12:43] grace of God hallelujah in my
[1:12:47] soul makes me thankful for your
[1:12:49] protection on my life Lord
