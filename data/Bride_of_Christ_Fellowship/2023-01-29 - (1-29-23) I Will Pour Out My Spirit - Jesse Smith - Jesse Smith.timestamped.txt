[8:14] God's grace go to Acts chapter 2.
[8:25] Acts chapter 2.
[8:35] I like to start reading it
[8:37] verse 4 and then we'll just skip ahead a
[8:40] little bit by God's grace
[8:48] Acts chapter 2 verse four I'd like to
[8:49] speak on
[8:50] I will pour out my spirit this morning
[8:53] by God's grace I will pour out my spirit
[9:02] Acts chapter 2 verse 4.
[9:13] I've been mentioning I've been studying
[9:15] the Zuzu Street Revival so I'd like to
[9:17] preach a little bit on that today by
[9:19] God's grace
[9:21] Acts chapter 2 verse 4. let's read that
[9:24] together
[9:26] on three ready one two three and they
[9:30] were all filled with the Holy Ghost and
[9:33] began to speak with other tongues as the
[9:36] spirit gave them utterance now I've had
[9:39] to verse 15. I'll read a little bit 15
[9:42] 16 and 17.
[9:43] for these are not drunk and as you
[9:46] suppose seeing it is but the third hour
[9:48] of the day but this is that which was
[9:50] spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall
[9:52] come to pass in the last days saith God
[9:56] here's my title for today I will pour
[9:59] out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your
[10:03] sons and your daughters shall prophesy
[10:05] and your young men shall see visions and
[10:08] your old men shall dream dreams
[10:10] may God add his Blessing to dream his
[10:12] word you may be seated
[10:20] so I have a few quotes I'd like to share
[10:22] so you can switch over whenever you're
[10:24] ready by God's grace oh thank you sir
[10:27] before I forget I just got a text from
[10:29] Brother Cam and uh
[10:32] next weekend I'll be preaching at
[10:34] brother Cam's church and we're having a
[10:36] Saturday night service
[10:39] at 6 00 pm and then a Sunday morning I
[10:41] believe at 10. do they do 10 30 or 10.
[10:44] okay
[10:45] so we're earlier than them wow okay
[10:49] and then brother Bender out will be here
[10:51] both services
[10:53] next Sunday by God's grace so look
[10:56] forward to that and then
[11:00] I believe that's the main announcements
[11:01] here uh like I was telling you I may
[11:03] have brother Simon come once a month on
[11:04] a Wednesday night just to give me a
[11:06] little break
[11:07] um
[11:08] as my voice gets really tired and so I
[11:11] could really use some help and then he
[11:12] could do some teaching as well with the
[11:13] young little ones you know and also
[11:15] brother Chris being new to the Faith by
[11:17] God's grace I thought we could do that
[11:18] so kind of and I surely enjoy Simon's
[11:21] Ministry and last time he preached here
[11:23] we got a nice comment on YouTube and the
[11:25] sister said she'd been emailing me now
[11:27] separately and she said that is exactly
[11:29] what I was praying about was the
[11:31] absolute remember when Simon preached on
[11:32] the absolute and she said that was just
[11:34] what I needed for that hour
[11:36] and then she's been listening to our
[11:38] services I think her name is
[11:40] uh well maybe I shouldn't say it but she
[11:43] didn't listen to our services and saying
[11:44] the Holy Spirit
[11:46] has been speaking to her you know
[11:48] exactly what she's been praying for
[11:49] God's been giving it to her so
[11:51] if God's answering their prayers for
[11:54] what they need I'm sure God's answering
[11:55] your prayers as well Hallelujah so
[11:59] that's the next announcement there again
[12:01] no second service today uh this funeral
[12:03] starts at 3 P.M I sent the text a little
[12:05] late but that's when I texted brother
[12:07] Vang for the address and the time and I
[12:10] got it back
[12:11] from Brother
[12:13] Vang and just as you probably know
[12:14] brother amen's home I guess he got home
[12:16] on Friday
[12:18] um I haven't heard from them other than
[12:20] sister Hua
[12:22] so I don't know if he's at the funeral
[12:23] today or if he won't be there or not but
[12:26] we're thankful for that and he may have
[12:28] surgery later I'm not sure I haven't got
[12:29] an update on
[12:31] how he's how his overall health is but
[12:33] let's keep our brother in prayer thank
[12:34] you each one of you thank you for going
[12:36] to visit him if you could
[12:37] thank you for praying for him those of
[12:39] you who could
[12:42] like I told brother amen if time goes on
[12:43] I said brother I said one of these days
[12:44] I'm going to be in that that bed that
[12:46] you're in right now
[12:47] right I said you're going to come visit
[12:48] me right if time goes off
[12:52] because we're all going to get sick we
[12:53] all may pass on if the Lord doesn't come
[12:55] in our lifetime
[12:57] he kept thanking me said oh thanks for
[12:58] coming thanks for coming I said well
[12:59] brother you're going to visit me someday
[13:01] too you know so we'll humble ourselves
[13:04] and be thankful for all God's love and
[13:07] all God's grace to our lives
[13:09] praise God
[13:11] so I'd like to just start here in Acts
[13:13] chapter two I think this was my first
[13:16] yeah I'd like to start there
[13:18] in Acts chapter two of course we're
[13:20] familiar with this this was the day of
[13:22] Pentecost and this was the birth of the
[13:24] church as I've been going through with
[13:25] my family at home and also Emma's been
[13:27] there a couple nights here in a row and
[13:29] uh this was the this was the birth of
[13:32] the New Testament Church this was the
[13:34] time when the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:36] could now fall on their souls
[13:38] all the time before this the Holy Ghost
[13:40] could only fall in their flesh but it
[13:41] would go away
[13:42] it'd fall in their mind it would go away
[13:45] but now the Holy Ghost could fall on
[13:47] their souls and now they could have a
[13:49] permanent anointing they could have a
[13:51] life
[13:52] that looks so different from the Old
[13:54] Testament and isn't that true church
[13:56] look at the life of Peter and Paul and
[13:58] James and John look how their lives were
[14:01] a life of Holiness my goodness Saint
[14:03] John lived until he was a hundred years
[14:05] old did he ever kill a man like David
[14:08] did he ever commit adultery like David
[14:10] no look at this life look at the
[14:12] testimony that this life produced praise
[14:14] God the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a
[14:17] constant presence that they have
[14:18] stumbling here and there well sure they
[14:20] stumbled on minor things you know Peter
[14:22] had some discrimination problems with
[14:24] the Gentiles
[14:26] Paul said the things that I hate that's
[14:28] what I do he would do things that he
[14:29] hated
[14:31] but it never brought such a reproach
[14:33] like a murder or an adultery like David
[14:36] or something along those lines it never
[14:38] brought this major reproach
[14:40] because now they had a a permanent
[14:43] presence now the spirit of God was going
[14:45] to be a constant companion amen that was
[14:48] going to be a friend that was closer
[14:50] than a brother praise God
[14:52] All Because of Jesus resurrection amen
[14:55] he died but then he rose Hallelujah and
[14:58] he said he said once I'm glorified then
[15:01] the Holy Ghost will be in you it'll be
[15:03] like uh Living Waters rushing up in out
[15:06] of your mouth hallelujah how many know
[15:08] it like that praise God Amen it's like
[15:10] Living Waters when it comes out
[15:12] it just flows out praise God it's just
[15:14] the spirit of God
[15:16] Desiring to speak to others it's the
[15:18] spirit of God giving God praise amen
[15:20] it's Fellowship between you and your
[15:22] heavenly father Hallelujah that's what
[15:25] the baptism of the Holy Ghost produces
[15:26] Jesus says it'll be a living water
[15:29] praise God
[15:31] I'm just going to go ahead and read that
[15:32] in Acts 7 because it's a beautiful
[15:33] promise from the Lord Jesus
[15:36] you know brother Ray has been talking to
[15:38] me about this one too
[15:40] and I wrote about in my book as well
[15:43] acts 7
[15:53] verse 30
[15:55] I'm in the wrong chapter there it is X
[15:58] yep
[16:00] X7 37.
[16:05] now this is the Feast of Tabernacles
[16:07] Jesus was attending there in Jerusalem
[16:09] in verse 37. in the last day that great
[16:11] day of the feast Jesus stood and cried
[16:13] saying now we'll pause right there
[16:15] in the book in my book there in chapter
[16:17] 6
[16:19] on the last day of the Feast of
[16:21] Pentecost one of the last things they
[16:22] would do is they would go get water out
[16:25] of the pool of Siloam and they would
[16:27] bring it up and the people would rejoice
[16:29] and say they would praise God for the
[16:31] water that they had of the past year
[16:34] and then they would praise God and I'm
[16:36] sorry then they would ask God lord we're
[16:37] just going to trust you're going to give
[16:38] us water for the next year
[16:41] and church remember this natural water
[16:43] was a sign that they were spiritually
[16:45] right with God because God told them if
[16:47] you don't keep the word I'm cutting off
[16:49] the rain
[16:51] right so in other words this was a
[16:53] celebration we've been faithful to God
[16:54] we haven't backslid on God God's given
[16:57] us rain
[16:58] and then they would praise God and they
[17:00] would bring the waters up and they would
[17:02] say they would Rejoice thank you God for
[17:04] the water and Lord we're dedicating
[17:06] ourselves now and we're freshly
[17:08] dedicating ourselves that that you'll
[17:09] pour out your water in the next coming
[17:11] year
[17:12] and you know for most people it just
[17:14] became an annual tradition
[17:16] but when it first started it was a real
[17:18] important thing
[17:19] they were sincere
[17:21] now little did they know in 40 years
[17:24] Titus would come and destroy the whole
[17:25] Temple
[17:27] right
[17:30] and so this was a uh this was a a moment
[17:33] of rejoicing in the water and now let's
[17:35] finish verse 37. so they're rejoicing in
[17:38] the water but now Jesus cries out if any
[17:40] man thirsts
[17:42] let him come unto me and drink praise
[17:45] God they're rejoicing in the water thank
[17:47] God we have water but Jesus says I am
[17:50] the Living Water praise God
[17:52] Hallelujah they're rejoicing in the
[17:54] water and God's saying the real water is
[17:56] right here right now praise God
[17:58] it's God in flesh it's Emmanuel praise
[18:01] God the real water is in flesh
[18:03] hallelujah amen thank God
[18:07] verse 38 he that believeth on me
[18:11] as the scripture has said out of his
[18:14] belly shall flow rivers of Living Water
[18:16] don't you love those moments when it
[18:18] just feels like the Holy Ghost is
[18:20] Flowing out of you praise God
[18:22] whether you're praising God or whether
[18:23] you're praying or whether you're
[18:25] witnessing or whether you're testifying
[18:27] to somebody or you're singing a song
[18:28] don't you love those moments but you
[18:30] know it's just flowing out praise God
[18:32] Amen this is more than me praise God
[18:34] this is more than my Humanity can
[18:36] produce the spirit of God is like a
[18:38] living water flowing out of me praise
[18:40] God that's what happened that last time
[18:42] I preached on dance like David dance I
[18:44] was just praying out here and it was
[18:45] just flowing and brother amen said I
[18:47] couldn't hold it back he said the spirit
[18:49] of God kept blowing on him like a fire
[18:51] like a wind and he started shouting and
[18:53] crying and praising God hallelujah amen
[18:55] oh I appreciate those moments amen
[18:57] hallelujah when the spirit of God flows
[19:00] out of you like a living water
[19:01] Hallelujah you can't contain it you
[19:04] can't stop it God is Flowing God's
[19:06] speaking Hallelujah God is moving amen
[19:08] that's exactly what Jesus said church
[19:10] I'm so glad to know I can experience
[19:12] what Jesus talked about praise God
[19:15] Church we're not living by a pain and
[19:17] fire today
[19:18] right we don't want to live by a painted
[19:20] fire like oh it's great with the head of
[19:22] Pentecost but we'll just pretend like we
[19:24] got it today we don't have to pretend
[19:25] the spirit of God is the same today
[19:27] praise God
[19:29] the Holy Ghost moves in the same way he
[19:31] did back then he moves like water praise
[19:34] God Amen he moves like living water
[19:37] Hallelujah
[19:38] it is our responsibility here to drink
[19:41] of that water and when we drink of that
[19:43] water then Jesus says it'll come flowing
[19:46] out of us hallelujah like rivers of
[19:48] Living Water
[19:50] verse 39. but this big he of the spirit
[19:54] which they that believe on him should
[19:57] receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet
[20:00] given because that Jesus was not yet
[20:02] glorified
[20:05] Hallelujah so we know we know the Holy
[20:07] Ghost was was was there was available
[20:10] for for the outer core the body and the
[20:13] mind
[20:15] but the Holy Ghost had not yet come to
[20:17] the soul praise God
[20:19] but on the day of Pentecost now I'm
[20:21] turning back to Acts chapter 2.
[20:24] they were in one place in one Accord
[20:29] and the Holy Ghost fell and the Bible
[20:31] said they spoke with other tongues
[20:33] and I and I constantly need help
[20:35] reminders from my wife on this one as we
[20:38] talked about on Friday night at our
[20:39] house they were Galilean but they were
[20:42] actually speaking in other languages
[20:45] they were galling they were speaking in
[20:47] Galilean that's what that's how I've
[20:48] changed my understanding of that they
[20:50] were actually speaking in other
[20:51] languages
[20:52] it was unknown to them but the hears
[20:55] were hearing it in their own languages
[20:57] praise God
[20:58] Hallelujah so the miracle was in the
[21:01] speaking praise God because the Bible
[21:03] said the spirit gave them utterance
[21:06] right
[21:08] Hallelujah
[21:10] and then it's noise the brow abroad and
[21:12] what are they they're just saying the
[21:14] wonderful works of God no doubt Jesus
[21:16] came as the Messiah Jesus died for our
[21:19] sins
[21:20] God raised Jesus from the dead Jesus is
[21:23] alive Jesus is here to give out Living
[21:25] Water praise God because that's what he
[21:27] said he'd do praise God
[21:30] maybe they were saying come to Jesus
[21:32] come and receive Jesus come receive
[21:34] believe in Jesus Christ no doubt they
[21:36] were saying these things because the
[21:38] Living Water was now flowing out of them
[21:40] Church Hallelujah church we got to make
[21:42] sure uh complaining doesn't flow out of
[21:44] our lips
[21:45] we got to make sure uh negativity
[21:47] doesn't flow out of our lips praise God
[21:50] we've got to make sure worldiness and
[21:52] foolishness doesn't flow out of our lips
[21:53] we gotta let the spirit of God flow out
[21:55] of our lips praise God Amen
[21:57] that's what the Holy Ghost does now no
[21:59] we I know we all have human moments like
[22:01] we did last night we just joking around
[22:02] about these some of these funny videos
[22:04] and things but there comes a time we
[22:06] have to move past that and we got to get
[22:08] back into the real the real sincerity of
[22:11] the Gospel praise God
[22:12] we gotta let the Living Waters Flow out
[22:15] of our our lips I've said it before I'll
[22:17] probably say it again
[22:19] I'm tired of just I get tired of just
[22:21] seeing the humanity of Jesse Smith I
[22:23] want to see the deity inside of Jesse
[22:25] Smith flow out praise God
[22:27] and that's what each one of us have to
[22:29] do we have to get tired of just being
[22:30] human and just tired of The Human
[22:32] Experience we want a supernatural
[22:34] experience amen
[22:36] Hallelujah we can't get too comfortable
[22:37] with that
[22:38] if we do we're going to backslide and do
[22:41] things we wish we would not have done
[22:43] praise God
[22:44] it's our responsibility have Revival
[22:46] praise God and the amount of Revival is
[22:48] up to you
[22:50] your amount of Revival is up to you just
[22:52] like it's up to me praise God
[22:55] Hallelujah but here in Acts chapter 2 we
[22:57] see the power of unity when everybody
[22:59] can get in Revival at the same time
[23:01] that's what we want to have here by
[23:03] God's grace
[23:04] is that right
[23:05] that's right
[23:08] and so people start mocking them oh
[23:10] they're drunk
[23:12] and Peter lifts up his voice and quotes
[23:14] the scripture of Joel
[23:17] now um uh that this was my text in verse
[23:20] 17 it should come to pass in the last
[23:21] days I just love this saith God
[23:25] this ain't the devil saying this
[23:27] ain't some man declaring this this is
[23:30] God God says I will
[23:34] Hallelujah
[23:36] let me say that again
[23:37] God said I will
[23:40] if God says it God will do it praise God
[23:44] if you were I say it we might not do it
[23:45] we may do it we may not there can be
[23:48] question on it if we say it but saith
[23:51] God God says I'll pour out my spirit
[23:54] upon All Flesh
[23:56] they didn't say he didn't say just to
[23:57] America or just to Africa or just to
[24:00] Australia he said All Flesh Hallelujah
[24:04] saith God
[24:05] said I'll pour it out so if God says it
[24:09] he's got to back it up praise God
[24:11] right but we know there's conditions
[24:13] that God pouring it out they had to get
[24:14] in condition they had to go to Jerusalem
[24:17] that's the first condition and they had
[24:19] to wait that's the second condition
[24:20] praise God that's all they had to do go
[24:22] to Jerusalem and wait and once they
[24:25] waited after 10 days the Holy Ghost fell
[24:27] praise God
[24:29] church that's what we got to do we got
[24:31] to obey and wait there it is right there
[24:33] amen hallelujah
[24:34] you have to go to some certain place now
[24:36] you might have to if you want to shut
[24:37] away you got to obey God's word and you
[24:40] got to wait on God hallelujah
[24:42] and then God pours out his Spirit as we
[24:45] wait upon him as we obey his promises
[24:47] God pours out his spirit and then the
[24:50] Bible says exactly what happens when God
[24:53] does pour out of his spirit
[24:58] look at this three things I was just
[24:59] meditating on this the last few weeks
[25:01] verse verse 17.
[25:03] I'm skipping down a few lines I will
[25:05] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and
[25:07] what will you see happen your sons and
[25:09] your daughters now this was spoken to
[25:10] Joel so Joel was speaking to the Jewish
[25:12] sons and daughters in other words the
[25:14] next Generations
[25:16] what are you going to see when the Holy
[25:18] Spirit gets poured out on you he says
[25:20] you're going to see prophecy you're
[25:22] going to see Visions young men sure see
[25:24] visions and old men shall dream dreams
[25:28] a church you and I have a right then
[25:31] if God says this you and I have a right
[25:34] to say Lord
[25:35] back up your word
[25:37] Lord you said you'd pour out prophecies
[25:41] visions and dreams
[25:43] Hallelujah every believer
[25:46] has the right to go to God and say God
[25:48] you said this
[25:49] you said you never leave me nor forsake
[25:51] me you said you're not a liar
[25:54] you said you're faithful you say you
[25:56] answered prayer we have every right to
[25:58] go to God and say God you promised this
[26:01] and I want to experience this praise God
[26:03] all right is that right Church
[26:06] now the same is true though
[26:09] for uh the The Sovereign hand of God we
[26:12] also have to understand God has a time
[26:13] and season
[26:15] the Holy Ghost could not have fallen on
[26:17] the ninth day
[26:19] it could not have fallen on the eight or
[26:21] now we think the seventh oh seven is
[26:22] completion it's gonna fall in the
[26:23] seventh day no it had to fulfill a
[26:26] different type it wasn't seven it was
[26:27] 50.
[26:29] 50. Pentecost 50. there's a certain time
[26:32] in certain place
[26:34] but what God does is God gets us in the
[26:37] channel to start crying out for the
[26:39] promise of God when it's about his time
[26:42] to pour it out
[26:43] Hallelujah that's what the Bible says in
[26:45] the days of Moses the first Exodus came
[26:47] because they started crying out Lord
[26:50] Deliver Us Deliver Us From Slavery they
[26:52] started crying out remember your
[26:53] promises you told Abraham you told the
[26:56] prophet we'd go back to Israel you said
[26:58] it you said it and eventually God raised
[27:01] up a Moses amen
[27:03] but what if you're in the generation
[27:05] that didn't see Moses you still cry out
[27:07] to God
[27:08] you still ask God to keep his word
[27:11] here we are we're what three generations
[27:13] for brother Branham and they've all been
[27:14] crying out I'm going to show you the
[27:15] history they've all been crying out for
[27:17] Jesus to come back
[27:19] was there a life was there life a waste
[27:21] absolutely not
[27:23] they were in the season of Jesus's
[27:26] coming praise God they said we're not in
[27:28] the sixth age we're not in the fifth age
[27:30] we're in the last age praise God
[27:33] we're in the age where Jesus is
[27:35] returning so we should sense that and we
[27:37] should cry out to God Lord let me be
[27:39] ready for your coming I sense I sense
[27:42] the spirit of God is moving to for me to
[27:44] draw night to you Lord fulfill your
[27:47] promises
[27:48] amen
[27:52] so there's been a few prophecies you
[27:53] know we've seen over the years
[28:00] you know when we uh when brother Bang's
[28:02] dad got healed I remember I looked I
[28:03] point out there and I said he's going to
[28:05] come out of that hospital completely
[28:07] well in the name of Jesus Christ and he
[28:09] did
[28:10] two weeks later I didn't say thus saith
[28:12] the Lord I just spoke it
[28:14] right when uh it was Beatrice Naomi when
[28:17] Zion was transverse they said it's going
[28:19] to be all right
[28:21] and it was all right the spirit of God
[28:23] doesn't lie
[28:24] Hallelujah
[28:26] so see our prophecies may not all come
[28:28] with us saith the Lord
[28:30] but God does tell us what's going to
[28:31] happen praise God
[28:33] I remember brother Brooks in 2013
[28:34] brother Brook said many or numerous uh
[28:37] famous message preachers are going to
[28:39] die this year
[28:40] and it happened five I counted five
[28:43] major ones died that year
[28:45] he said the spirit of the Lord told me
[28:46] that he didn't say thou saith the Lord
[28:48] but he said the spirit Lord told me that
[28:52] the Bible says when the spirit gets
[28:54] poured out you will prophesy
[28:57] but then the Bible just says do you all
[28:59] prophesy so not everybody's going to
[29:02] prophesy but there's going to be
[29:04] prophecies Among Us praise God
[29:06] Hallelujah
[29:08] in other words the Holy Spirit Will
[29:10] foretell something in advance that's
[29:12] what I think what happened to you
[29:12] brother Chris the Holy Spirit showed
[29:13] you're going to get the job at Walmart
[29:14] right before you got it
[29:18] before you got it
[29:20] it'll prophesy it'll tell you things to
[29:22] come praise God
[29:24] when it gets poured out it will foretell
[29:27] the future in the book of Acts if
[29:28] foretold the famine in Jerusalem
[29:32] right so the Saints could send food and
[29:34] and drink to the Saints there so they
[29:36] didn't die during the dearth it's called
[29:38] a dearth or a famine that's an example
[29:42] right so if the Holy Spirit told you oh
[29:43] there's going to be a recession save up
[29:45] your money or do this or that that could
[29:47] be a very real possibility today the
[29:48] Holy Spirit could warn people of those
[29:49] things now we know there's a recession
[29:51] like every 15 or 20 years you know maybe
[29:53] sometimes seven or eight years there's
[29:54] always a recession but the Holy Spirit
[29:56] Will Never Lie praise God
[29:58] when he pours out his Spirit you'll
[30:01] prophesy anybody else remember any
[30:02] prophecies you've had in your life where
[30:04] you knew there were prophecies
[30:06] you're going to come to pass anybody
[30:07] want to raise your hand in charity
[30:09] that have already come to pass you've
[30:11] seen them coming to pass
[30:12] Austin
[30:14] that's right mccath yes amen let's say
[30:16] praise the Lord can we praise that's
[30:18] right brother that's exactly right
[30:20] Hallelujah that's kind of like what
[30:22] happened to my mom with cancer the the
[30:24] friend came in
[30:25] and she said Ruby the Lord told me
[30:27] you're going to be made well and quote
[30:29] Psalm 118 Verse 17.
[30:33] I shall live and not die and declare the
[30:36] works of the Lord amen it's a prophecy I
[30:38] will not die I'll live and declare the
[30:40] works of the Lord
[30:43] so the Bible doesn't tell us how much
[30:45] prophecy will get but the Bible tells us
[30:47] not all our Prophets
[30:50] and so the Bible says when you get the
[30:52] Holy Ghost poured out you'll prophesy
[30:54] there will be prophecies amongst the
[30:56] people
[30:57] praise God
[30:59] think about brother Brown's Ministry
[31:00] he's told us numerous things to come in
[31:02] the name of the Lord
[31:04] right he's told us about the World
[31:07] Council of churches I was listening to
[31:08] it yesterday uniting with the American
[31:10] government now we haven't seen that rise
[31:12] up recently but we believe it's going to
[31:14] come
[31:15] where the churches will control politics
[31:18] and they'll move the politicians to
[31:20] change laws and then once they change
[31:22] their laws that latter rain is going to
[31:24] fall
[31:24] that's what we're told by brother
[31:26] Brandon that's why we watch the news
[31:28] that's why I watch the lawmakers that's
[31:29] why I pray for the government because
[31:31] that's what brother man told us
[31:32] the spirit of God told him that said
[31:34] pick up your pen and write
[31:36] he said he said the bride will be forced
[31:39] to stop preaching me here we are
[31:40] preaching
[31:41] so that how can these preachers say
[31:43] there's nothing left to be fulfilled
[31:44] they just don't they haven't studied
[31:46] enough I don't know what's wrong they
[31:48] haven't prayed enough they haven't
[31:49] started enough I don't know
[31:50] but there's definitely more to be
[31:52] fulfilled chronovirus was a pestilence
[31:54] are there more pestilences we'll see
[31:56] it's burnt pains it's got to get closer
[31:59] and closer each time to laying down in
[32:01] the mark of the beast but one thing's
[32:02] for sure we know Jesus will be with us
[32:04] in the midst of the birth pains praise
[32:06] God he cannot forsake his his own he
[32:09] said I've got proof on the red letters
[32:11] he said I'll be with you to the end of
[32:13] the world praise God
[32:15] I'm not going to give up at the event
[32:16] right before the end he said I'll be
[32:18] with you to the end Hallelujah he's
[32:21] faithful praise God
[32:23] he keeps his promise Hallelujah
[32:27] and then Jesus says
[32:29] he said these signs shall follow them
[32:31] that believe let's go back there to Luke
[32:33] 16.
[32:35] now this is the verse the NIV takes out
[32:39] I'm sorry Mark 16. I said Luke 16. I met
[32:41] mark 16.
[32:45] I know they put a little footnote at the
[32:48] bottom and it mentions these verses but
[32:50] they still take it out of their Bible
[32:51] they don't recognize it as it's inspired
[32:56] verse 15 Luke 16 verse 15. and he said
[32:59] to them go into all the world and preach
[33:01] the gospel to every creatures that's for
[33:03] Apostles right women aren't called to
[33:04] preach and pastors aren't called to be
[33:06] apostles
[33:07] Apostles a certain gift to go to places
[33:10] where they don't have churches and make
[33:12] converts and start churches verse 16 he
[33:16] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[33:18] saved how many how many know you're
[33:19] saved here today you've been baptized
[33:21] you're saved but he that believeth not
[33:24] shall be damned
[33:26] and these signs are bother them that
[33:28] believe in my name shall they cast out
[33:30] Devils how many have ever seen a devil
[33:32] cast out
[33:34] break your hand couple
[33:38] yeah I've seen it numerous times first
[33:40] time I saw it was in The Message Church
[33:41] it was on a Wednesday night the organ
[33:43] player was a woman she come back here
[33:45] and cast The Devil out of some man
[33:48] and he looked totally different
[33:49] afterwards he was crying weeping
[33:51] delivered because of that I've seen it
[33:53] uh once in Pennsylvania and I've seen it
[33:55] six times there in Guyana
[33:58] where literally saw the people go from
[34:00] like either being all confused and and
[34:02] burdened and angry just to being joyful
[34:04] and free
[34:05] right they're countenance changes
[34:08] right and the demon leaves
[34:12] these signs for all them that believe in
[34:14] my name they shall cast out Devils see
[34:16] in the name of Jesus Christ they shall
[34:18] speak with new tongues right many of us
[34:21] were here when sister Naomi spoke with
[34:22] that new tongue praise God right I've
[34:24] been other churches of brother cams and
[34:26] other churches down in South Africa
[34:28] where I heard speaking in tongues
[34:30] most times it was interpreted not every
[34:32] time but we pray for the interpretation
[34:35] see God will move on someone and he'll
[34:38] speak in a new language he'll speak in a
[34:40] new tongue sometimes the message is for
[34:42] the people
[34:43] sometimes the Bible says they're
[34:45] speaking a mystery in the spirit praise
[34:47] God
[34:48] some spiritual mystery it's hard to
[34:50] understand that
[34:52] when they're speaking some mystery
[34:53] praise God
[34:55] sometime that's just to edify the person
[34:57] who's speaking in tongues
[34:59] God knows they're weak or God knows
[35:01] they're struggling God knows they need
[35:03] something so God's got to send them a
[35:04] tongue to edify them and make them feel
[35:06] stronger praise God
[35:09] God knows what we have need of and God's
[35:11] faithful to give us what we have need of
[35:13] God knows we need experiences with him
[35:16] so he provides them praise God because
[35:18] he promised he would
[35:20] he promised he would
[35:23] Hallelujah
[35:24] they shall take up serpents now that's
[35:26] of course speaking of Saint Paul when he
[35:28] had took up the serpent and didn't know
[35:30] it he was carrying sticks the serpent
[35:31] bit him
[35:32] he threw it off in the fire and all the
[35:35] uh
[35:36] all the Islanders thought he was a God
[35:39] he said no I'm just a man so he had to
[35:41] assure them it was just the power of God
[35:45] right but we're not like those in
[35:46] Alabama or Mississippi where they
[35:48] actually bring poisonous snakes in there
[35:50] they got to pray up and make sure
[35:51] they're holy enough and if they get bit
[35:52] then that and they they're well that
[35:55] proves that they're they're born again
[35:56] well how many people have died you know
[35:58] how many people how many preachers have
[35:59] died from that
[36:01] that's the wrong application of this
[36:03] don't they even know what Jesus said
[36:05] Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God
[36:07] hallelujah
[36:10] but if it happens you get bit by a
[36:12] serpent in the service of the Lord
[36:13] you'll cast it off and it shall not harm
[36:16] you
[36:18] that's right
[36:20] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[36:23] not hurt them
[36:25] so there's I can't think of a new
[36:26] testament example of that but there's an
[36:27] Old Testament example of that in second
[36:29] Kings chapter four we're not going to
[36:31] read that today
[36:33] and then the next one they shall lay
[36:35] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[36:36] how many have laid their hands on
[36:37] someone and they got well
[36:39] praise God
[36:41] anyone else any other hands
[36:43] okay
[36:44] so
[36:45] this is what Jesus Promised Hallelujah
[36:47] this is his last commission to the
[36:50] church Hallelujah and he said I will
[36:52] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh praise
[36:55] God
[36:56] it's his promise saith God and God
[37:00] doesn't lie God's here to pour out his
[37:03] Spirit praise God amen
[37:05] Hallelujah brother man says Mark 16 is
[37:08] the true church in action he said there
[37:11] is not another church Hallelujah
[37:15] God hallelujah we're so glad to be a
[37:17] part of that church praise God and the
[37:20] burden today is you got you and I got to
[37:22] find our place in that church
[37:25] which one is which one is God anointing
[37:27] you for to prophesy
[37:29] to see a vision
[37:30] to dream a dream like the more I think
[37:33] about it when I got the holy ghost that
[37:34] hadn't been a vision because I've never
[37:35] had an experience like that before I'm
[37:37] just standing up there crying praising
[37:38] God and I see them pound the nails in
[37:41] Jesus's hand on the cross and they raise
[37:43] him up and I just see the side sideway
[37:45] view of them like this I see the sideway
[37:47] View and I'm just I'm just so burdened
[37:50] I'm so hurt but I'm so thankful that
[37:52] Jesus Is My Savior
[37:54] I just spend a few minutes praising God
[37:56] and I leave that church and shaking the
[37:59] people's hands just with so much love I
[38:01] just feel like I want to love everybody
[38:02] praise God
[38:04] and I've been a different person since
[38:06] that service praise God
[38:07] but the Bible says when I pour out my
[38:10] spirit you'll prophesy you'll see
[38:12] Visions you'll dream dreams how many had
[38:14] a spiritual how many has ever had a
[38:15] spiritual dream before
[38:17] come to pass right absolutely this
[38:20] follows those that get the spirit poured
[38:23] out on them praise God
[38:26] it's exactly right the true church in
[38:29] action
[38:32] I've been feeling burdened to preach
[38:33] this again by God's grace
[38:37] I just want to make sure I don't miss
[38:38] any of my notes Here Sometimes they come
[38:41] right in at the right time
[38:43] now
[38:45] I don't know uh when I asked a few weeks
[38:47] ago I don't think anybody had read on
[38:49] Azusa Street right right if you read any
[38:52] any writing on Azusa Street is anybody
[38:53] or anything no okay so this is going to
[38:55] be all fresh
[38:56] so everybody can leave this service
[38:58] saying I heard something new today
[39:00] brother Jesse didn't repeat his old
[39:01] sermon
[39:02] I rarely do that anyway sometimes I'll
[39:04] post sections but
[39:07] brother Adam said there was hope at the
[39:09] beginning of this church age around
[39:10] 1906.
[39:12] he said this age started after the turn
[39:14] of the 20th century as it was to be the
[39:16] age in which the true church would
[39:18] return to being the bride she was at
[39:19] Pentecost we know that there must be a
[39:21] necessity be a return of dynamic power
[39:24] now that's what we need more of today
[39:25] praise God right how many want more
[39:28] Dynamic power
[39:29] right like I'm thankful that the sick
[39:31] recover but I'd like to see more
[39:33] miracles praise God would you
[39:36] more new tongues more Devils being cast
[39:40] out but I'll say it like this it's a
[39:42] good sign we don't have more Devils cast
[39:43] out because that proves you don't have
[39:44] devils
[39:46] then we got to clean out Church
[39:47] I'm glad I don't have to cast The Devil
[39:49] out of you because that means you got
[39:50] the devil out yourself
[39:52] right you didn't let it come in and
[39:54] build it up and let it build this
[39:55] complex and and then you're you're all
[39:58] uh
[39:59] carried away with devilish thoughts
[40:02] thank God Amen
[40:06] but how many believe in casting out
[40:07] devils
[40:09] oh yeah I never forget when uh remember
[40:12] Wendy was here she was sitting right on
[40:14] that road right about where uh Jose was
[40:16] and that brother from Illyria
[40:18] what was his name Jason thank you honey
[40:20] this is always my second brain
[40:23] but I preach and they both come up and
[40:24] said the devil is whispering in both of
[40:26] their ears that they need to leave the
[40:28] service
[40:29] and I prayed and the brother said the
[40:31] devil is cast out
[40:33] I think when he said while the preaching
[40:35] was going on that devil was cast out of
[40:36] her mind
[40:38] the spirit just left that's just a
[40:39] moderate example how right right brother
[40:41] Chris you can come into the service and
[40:43] have we talk about this on the text you
[40:44] can have all kinds of Mind battles but
[40:46] you got to press through that and say
[40:48] Satan get behind me
[40:49] you got to point Satan the Bible says
[40:52] this Satan you're a liar God tells the
[40:55] truth all the time amen every word of
[40:57] God is yea and amen
[40:59] that's an example where devils are cast
[41:01] out in the mind battles
[41:02] right and there's not these people
[41:04] weren't demon-possessed
[41:06] because we all have mind battles but
[41:08] Satan is President trying to get two
[41:10] people out of the service and so we've
[41:11] got to preach the word of God and the
[41:13] Holy Spirit will fight for his people
[41:15] praise God the Holy Ghost came to battle
[41:17] today praise God Hallelujah the Holy
[41:21] Ghost came to fight for you Hallelujah
[41:23] it's exactly right church amen
[41:26] amen God's here to fight for you praise
[41:28] God he won't let you be taken over he
[41:30] won't let you fall praise God he won't
[41:32] let you be lost he's the Savior praise
[41:34] God put on the helmet of salvation
[41:36] Hallelujah
[41:37] thank you Jesus
[41:41] see Dynamic power
[41:43] it's your brother Crystal we want to see
[41:45] see more of it you've been with us for a
[41:46] few months
[41:47] over the years we see Dynamic power from
[41:49] time to time
[41:51] where something instant happens
[41:54] we believe in it
[41:57] we're trusting God to do it Hallelujah
[41:59] and you hang around long enough you're
[42:00] going to see it brother praise God
[42:02] you're going to see it
[42:06] the believer sends this in their spirits
[42:08] and began what they begin to do crying
[42:10] to God
[42:11] for a new outpouring
[42:14] such as was in the first century does
[42:16] this sound familiar to anybody
[42:19] this is does this sound like brother
[42:20] Brown's message is to turn our hearts
[42:22] back to what
[42:27] we've been taking notes she's been
[42:28] saying amen hallelujah
[42:31] that's exactly what they were feeling a
[42:33] hundred and fifteen or so years ago
[42:37] the same thing we're feeling
[42:39] it it should be time for the Lord to
[42:41] come we need we need pot we need Dynamic
[42:44] power just like the book of Acts amen
[42:47] so what do we do do we sit sit around do
[42:49] nothing about it no we've got to cry out
[42:51] to God for it
[42:53] that's what we need to do today praise
[42:55] God I'm gonna make time we can do it
[42:56] today I'm going to try not to preach too
[42:57] long usually preach hour and a half I'm
[42:59] not trying not to preach an hour and a
[43:01] half that's why I set a timer I'm
[43:02] already at half an hour already so all
[43:03] right
[43:05] ah
[43:06] busy body back there
[43:11] now just just good just so you know I'm
[43:13] good I'm going to get to this but the
[43:14] Holy Ghost fell in Los Angeles in 1906.
[43:18] but they had been praying for Revival
[43:20] for at least two years
[43:22] because they heard about Evan Roberts
[43:24] Revival in Wales
[43:26] and some of the men traveled from
[43:29] the U.S to Wales to learn from Evan
[43:33] Roberts how the Holy Ghost how the Holy
[43:35] Ghost fell and you know what he said
[43:36] they had house prayer meetings so who's
[43:39] going to open up your house this week so
[43:40] we can have a prayer meeting
[43:42] now we laugh but if one of you do it
[43:45] and if I do it who's all going to come
[43:47] now we know second shifters can't come
[43:51] well so what do we do not have any
[43:52] prayer meetings I don't know
[43:54] I have a prayer meeting as I've
[43:56] announced it before I have a prayer
[43:57] meeting before and after every service
[43:58] if you want to be a part of it I've been
[44:01] having that for years now
[44:03] prayer meetings just calling on God
[44:05] right
[44:06] every Wednesday night there's a prayer
[44:08] meeting every Wednesday night
[44:12] see It's gotta we gotta begin to sense
[44:14] that Christ is coming
[44:17] we want the same Holy Ghost they had in
[44:19] the book of Acts so we got to cry out
[44:20] for it praise God
[44:23] and so far this this month I've just
[44:25] I've just prayed three extra hours just
[44:27] for the power of the Holy Ghost I'm
[44:29] keeping track
[44:31] because they kept track
[44:32] Azusa Street kept track
[44:35] they prayed five that man prayed five
[44:37] hours every day and right before it fell
[44:39] he started going to seven hours every
[44:40] day
[44:42] so I know I'm not I I know I'm not just
[44:45] going to wake up one day sister lean and
[44:47] say well I feel like praying five hours
[44:48] today that ain't gonna happen
[44:50] make it happen
[44:52] we gotta we gotta slowly work ourselves
[44:54] into that
[44:56] praise God
[44:57] we have to have a burden now let me let
[44:59] me show this balance to it too the man
[45:01] that did that had no job
[45:03] he was living on handouts
[45:05] brother Seymour
[45:09] so he had all the Time in the World to
[45:11] pray
[45:12] you and I don't so we got to pray with
[45:13] the time that we got
[45:17] he was living off a handouts he was
[45:19] basically now some people might say that
[45:20] he was bumming off one of the church
[45:22] members he was just living in a church
[45:23] member's house
[45:25] he didn't have a job
[45:27] so I'm going to tell kind of tell that
[45:29] story he was a rejected preacher
[45:32] and so somebody had mercy on him let him
[45:34] into their house and so he's like I know
[45:36] God sent me here
[45:37] I'm just going to devote I'm going to
[45:38] have a season of Prayer
[45:40] and so he prayed from February
[45:43] March April so about about after about
[45:46] two and a half months the Holy Ghost
[45:47] fell in a powerful way
[45:50] now if I said let's pray for two and a
[45:52] half months everybody pray one hour per
[45:54] day who could do it
[45:57] who could do it
[45:58] see
[46:00] it takes a real leading of God it takes
[46:02] God leading you to do it
[46:04] right it has to be God's time and season
[46:08] but Who's Crying Out Among Us who's
[46:11] crying out for God to pour out a spear
[46:14] that's what we got to get to
[46:20] now what seemed to be the answer came
[46:22] now remember they want to return to the
[46:24] book of Acts Church as many began to
[46:27] speak in tongues and manifest the gifts
[46:28] of the Spirit
[46:30] now from what I've read and seen on
[46:32] documentaries is that when the tongues
[46:34] came they were interpreted
[46:37] but then different things I read make it
[46:39] sound like Maybe not maybe as the
[46:41] Revival went on there was just unknown
[46:43] tongues and no interpretation
[46:45] it's kind of hard to know I got to dig
[46:46] into some more personal journals and
[46:49] Diaries of the people that were there
[46:51] but right now I've just read
[46:52] dictionaries and different things and
[46:54] watched some documentaries on it
[46:58] it was then believed that this was
[47:00] indeed the long restored or long-awaited
[47:02] restoration of the of the book of Acts
[47:04] it was not for the latter rain can come
[47:07] only after the former rain which is the
[47:10] spring or teaching rain
[47:12] the latter rain then is the Harvest rain
[47:14] how could this be the real thing when
[47:16] the teaching rate had not come now
[47:18] listen the prophet messenger brother
[47:20] Branham who was dissent to what was he
[47:22] taught to do teach what was he said to
[47:24] do teach brother man was sent to teach
[47:27] that's what this message is this message
[47:29] is a school Master Amen to bring me to
[47:32] Christ Hallelujah that's what the tapes
[47:34] are that's what the books are the books
[47:37] are tapes or so our school Masters to
[47:39] teach us to seek the Holy Ghost
[47:42] and be ready for the Rapture praise God
[47:45] yes there's anointing on those tapes
[47:46] there's anointing on brother Seymour's
[47:48] Journal if you read there's anointing on
[47:50] Evan Roberts Journal praise God because
[47:52] they're anointed men of God
[47:58] the prophet messenger was to be sent to
[48:00] teach the people and turn the hearts of
[48:01] the children back to the Pentecostal
[48:03] fathers had not yet come thus what was
[48:05] thought to be the restoration and the
[48:07] final quickening unto the Rapture had
[48:09] not come
[48:10] but brother man showed us it was Return
[48:12] of the gifts of the Spirit
[48:15] right
[48:16] that's what it was it was a return of
[48:18] the gifts people now see church this
[48:20] tells us if we want to see gifts we got
[48:22] to pray more
[48:23] that's what this teaches us
[48:26] when we sense God wants to move and God
[48:28] is fulfilling his word right now and I
[48:30] don't want to miss it I don't want to be
[48:31] a part of it we got to give ourselves
[48:34] into a season of Prayer
[48:36] praise God
[48:40] was doing something great
[48:43] God was restoring the gifts of the Holy
[48:45] Spirit
[48:46] praise God
[48:49] it was a great thing
[48:51] now later on here here's this is what
[48:53] Brother Brad means because what from
[48:54] what I've read later on it was a mixture
[48:56] of unrighteous partaking a spiritual
[48:58] blessing and manifesting in the Holy
[49:01] Ghost as we as we have kept pointing
[49:04] out to you now what does this mean some
[49:06] of those people were unrighteous in the
[49:08] Azusa Street meetings and the revivals
[49:11] around them in other words some of them
[49:13] just came to get an experience and then
[49:15] they'd start a denomination
[49:18] everybody understand
[49:20] uh even history records that some people
[49:22] came to that Revival just to become
[49:24] popular so they could say they spoke
[49:26] with tongues and then get a following
[49:28] just like it is today people just try to
[49:30] get popular on Instagram just they can
[49:31] get a following that's all they want is
[49:33] to be followed
[49:36] so that was the unrighteous part of it
[49:38] the unrighteous part was I just want to
[49:40] speak in tongues or I just want to see a
[49:42] miracle I just want to be there so
[49:43] people can follow me so I can become
[49:45] famous that's the wrong motive the wrong
[49:47] motive is I wouldn't have experience
[49:48] with God so God can use me whether good
[49:51] or bad or whether rich or poor right
[49:53] like the marriage vow whether rich or
[49:55] poor no matter whether they're healthy
[49:56] or not healthy so God can use me for his
[49:59] glory praise God
[50:01] now later on as I'll show here
[50:04] witches started going into their
[50:07] meetings mediums and they would pretend
[50:09] to speak in tongues to distract the
[50:11] people
[50:13] and Seymour didn't catch it right away
[50:17] and so the the mediums would speak in
[50:19] tongues and distract and do other things
[50:21] and it would distract from the real move
[50:23] of God
[50:28] now we all say we all say we want
[50:30] Revival how many say want Revival
[50:32] but look if we ask for Revival Satan's
[50:34] going to come fight us really hard
[50:36] now don't raise your hands but how many
[50:37] want witches to come in here
[50:40] right see
[50:42] along with Revival comes tests and
[50:44] trials
[50:47] right and from what it says Seymour
[50:49] didn't
[50:50] he didn't rebuke them and send them out
[50:52] right away because maybe he didn't know
[50:53] he didn't maybe wasn't praying enough
[50:55] about it maybe they start to Backside a
[50:56] little bit I don't know
[50:58] but brother man it misses everybody can
[51:00] see
[51:01] at least one unrighteous thing was all
[51:03] the denominations that came out of it
[51:04] and the initial evidence of tongues
[51:08] that was an unrighteous thing
[51:10] because anybody can interpret anybody
[51:13] can impersonate a tongue
[51:15] any devil can speak in tongues and
[51:17] impersonate it right but God has a real
[51:19] tongue thank God for that
[51:21] but Satan impersonates that
[51:24] in an unrighteous way
[51:27] and a real person that speaks in tongues
[51:28] well again after that they'll live a
[51:30] life that's worthy of the Gospel praise
[51:33] God
[51:33] but you had a lot of people there that
[51:35] would speak in tongues and try to get
[51:36] rich off it and start their own
[51:37] denomination
[51:38] well I was at Azusa follow me I spoke in
[51:42] tongues
[51:42] and what does it produce it's produced
[51:44] what we got now
[51:46] a bunch of a bunch of nonsense in the
[51:49] Bethel movement the Hillsong just speak
[51:50] in tongues and you got it nonsense
[51:53] right the charismatics and uh just speak
[51:56] in tongues and you're filled with the
[51:58] Holy Ghost and you can live any way you
[51:59] want that's a bunch of nonsense the real
[52:01] thing is what they had
[52:03] Seymour was taught in the second work of
[52:05] Grace sanctification
[52:09] Hallelujah
[52:10] he was trained under a Wesleyan movement
[52:13] and learned sanctification Church they
[52:15] didn't even wear wedding rings
[52:18] right and so I'm listening I'm like whoa
[52:22] look how far they went
[52:25] but then you I see some of their other
[52:26] false doctrines later so I'm like I'll
[52:28] see it's just a it's a liberty it's a
[52:30] wedding ring is a Christian Liberty
[52:32] they wouldn't allow necklaces they
[52:34] wouldn't allow nothing
[52:38] super strict I mean they were super
[52:39] legalistic strict
[52:43] now are they free to have that yes
[52:45] they're free to have their liberty no
[52:47] doubt
[52:48] but he knew justification and
[52:50] sanctification
[52:51] Seymour did now I'm going to get to that
[52:53] in a little bit hopefully
[52:56] in this movement also was devil Powers
[52:59] men were under the control of devils and
[53:00] yet no one seemed to realize it like we
[53:02] said with the mediums and then with
[53:04] these preachers those false preachers
[53:05] who came in there just to say they were
[53:07] there and then lead people astray and
[53:10] then later Church what I mean is that
[53:11] some of them would then get arrested for
[53:13] doing wicked things later you know
[53:15] sexual sins or money laundering or
[53:18] something like that yet they were there
[53:19] to zoos in they spoke with tongues
[53:22] see so the devil that's what the devil
[53:25] does when God pours out a real blessing
[53:26] Satan comes to break it up
[53:30] you've seen in your life you have uh
[53:32] some season of great time with God and
[53:33] all of a sudden here comes all the
[53:35] trials
[53:38] right like we just had a good season of
[53:39] Dancing and look what happens
[53:42] season of death and morning sickness
[53:45] right after I mean right after
[53:47] we're dancing around here praising God
[53:49] love these are the best Services we've
[53:50] ever had right Haven perfect timing
[53:54] everybody's the best services in all my
[53:56] it's just going to get greater and
[53:57] greater and then tragedy comes loss
[53:59] comes
[54:00] mourning comes
[54:02] two days after
[54:04] two days after
[54:05] but we were warned by the Holy Spirit
[54:09] and God wants us to be faithful in every
[54:10] season
[54:12] then to prove that
[54:15] the tongues as evidence was not real
[54:18] these people even before a second
[54:20] generation had appeared organized and
[54:21] wrote their unscriptural doctrines and
[54:23] built their own fences as every other
[54:25] group ahead of them did
[54:27] the main man that did this was Charles
[54:29] parnam now he got arrested at the end of
[54:32] his life which was not a good thing
[54:34] but he's the one that he said there's
[54:36] three works of Grace but that third one
[54:37] is speaking in tongues
[54:40] okay and so William Seymour learned from
[54:42] him
[54:43] but I mean that was just a few years
[54:44] after Pentecost they set up these
[54:47] doctrines you've got to speak in tongues
[54:50] see forcing people and that's what
[54:51] Seymour said Seymour is the one that
[54:53] said that we've got to seek the giver
[54:55] and not the gifts
[54:57] we don't seek a tongue we don't seek a
[54:59] miracle we see Christ Hallelujah
[55:02] and then Christ gives us what we have
[55:04] need of
[55:05] then Christ shows us what gifts are in
[55:07] our lives
[55:10] what about the true seed you've heard me
[55:12] read this probably 50 times if you've
[55:13] been here a while it will happen just as
[55:15] we have said the people of God are being
[55:17] made ready by the word of truth from the
[55:18] messenger this age brother Ram's message
[55:21] in the bride will be the fullness of
[55:23] Pentecost for the spirit will bring the
[55:25] people right back to where they were at
[55:26] the beginning that is thus saith the
[55:28] Lord I just love reading that praise God
[55:31] Amen I told brother amen one day I want
[55:33] to get that on those plastic letters I
[55:35] want to put it right up here on the wall
[55:37] the Holy Ghost is going to bring us
[55:39] right back to Pentecost it's thus save
[55:42] the Lord praise God
[55:43] Hallelujah I'm going back there and
[55:46] after I go back there I'm going up
[55:48] praise God
[55:49] we've got to go back if we want to go up
[55:52] it's the saith the Lord praise God
[55:55] we got to have what they have on the day
[55:57] of Pentecost
[56:01] so like when I got the Holy Ghost
[56:03] let me compare it to the dead Pentecost
[56:04] and the day of Pentecost they went and
[56:06] sold everything they had because they
[56:07] had a bunch of poor Christians but when
[56:09] I got the Holy Ghost nobody sold out
[56:11] their house and gave me money
[56:14] because I wasn't poor
[56:17] because nobody was poor in the church
[56:19] right so we can't say it has to match
[56:21] everything has to match perfectly
[56:22] because they're we're in a different age
[56:24] we're in an age of rich and increased
[56:25] with goods and people say they have no
[56:27] need of the Holy Ghost
[56:28] what a bunch of nonsense if anybody
[56:31] needs the Holy Ghost we need the Holy
[56:32] Ghost praise God
[56:33] Hallelujah I'm just showing you when I
[56:35] got the Holy Ghost nobody said okay now
[56:37] I'm going to go sell my third home I
[56:39] want to help you out really Jesse
[56:41] now what is that that's okay they didn't
[56:44] have to I had a job
[56:47] I'm sorry I had a school school
[56:48] scholarship yeah I had a job
[56:52] but see the Holy Ghost is going to take
[56:54] us right back to the spirit of love that
[56:57] they had on the day of Pentecost that's
[56:59] where we're going back to
[57:00] and the dynamic power
[57:02] and the right doctor
[57:04] all the fullness of Pentecost not a
[57:07] portion of Pentecost everybody say the
[57:09] phone it's ready though
[57:10] say it again duh the fullness of
[57:13] Pentecost will be in us hallelujah
[57:16] that's what I lived my life for that's
[57:17] what I'm expecting that's what I'm
[57:19] preaching for that's what I'm praying
[57:20] for That's What I'm Living For living
[57:21] for that's what I'll die for praise God
[57:24] if I live long enough to die
[57:26] hopefully hopefully I lived long enough
[57:28] to live
[57:31] so I don't have to die Hallelujah so see
[57:34] church what do we got to have what do
[57:35] they have their Spirits were crying out
[57:37] for more of God that's what we got to
[57:39] have they had two works of Grace
[57:42] they had justification they had
[57:43] sanctification but they said we need
[57:45] more than this
[57:46] praise God now I know we preached that
[57:48] too but in each one of our Lives God
[57:50] knows where each one of us are at
[57:53] I know I've cried out for the Holy Ghost
[57:55] I'd spend an hour up there in my college
[57:57] room just screaming and shouting and
[57:59] singing asking God for the Holy Ghost I
[58:01] go to the Altar and ask God for the Holy
[58:03] Ghost I spend a lot of time seeking the
[58:04] Holy Ghost I've cried out for it I still
[58:06] cry out for it praise God I haven't
[58:09] stopped crying out for it amen
[58:11] every service I cry out for praise God
[58:17] that's what each one of us have to do we
[58:19] have to desire the gifts or the moving
[58:21] of the spirit
[58:22] they thought they were getting the they
[58:24] thought they were getting the latter
[58:25] rain before the Rapture but it wasn't
[58:27] time yet thank God there wasn't time
[58:28] because you and I had to come on the
[58:30] scene
[58:30] God was gracious to us
[58:33] Church they had power they could have
[58:35] gone the Rapture they had power there
[58:36] was blind people that were giving their
[58:38] sight back in those meetings
[58:40] now which one of us have seen that rare
[58:44] but that seems like Pentecost right a
[58:46] paralyzed man walking and leaping
[58:48] instant healing Dynamic power everybody
[58:50] say Dynamic power ready Dynamic that's
[58:53] what the Holy Ghost brings Dynamic power
[58:57] see they could have it could have been
[58:59] but God knew they had more time
[59:01] right
[59:03] don't you think don't you think on the
[59:06] day of Pentecost with Peter and Mary
[59:07] don't you think they would have had the
[59:09] Holy Ghost to go into Rapture could they
[59:10] have had rapturing faith of course
[59:11] they're the standard but it wasn't God's
[59:14] time for it
[59:16] that's why I I really think I really
[59:19] think critical of people that are
[59:20] critical of Azusa Street because it was
[59:22] God pouring out a great Revival they
[59:24] just haven't read about it if they say
[59:25] bad things about Azusa it's because they
[59:27] haven't read about it
[59:28] these people let me ask them when was
[59:31] The Last Time You Prayed five hours a
[59:32] day message preacher or whoever you
[59:34] think you are that you think you're so
[59:35] great when was The Last Time You Prayed
[59:37] five hours in a week
[59:39] and the church said
[59:42] huh
[59:45] when was the last time you had uh three
[59:46] services a day for even one week yet
[59:48] alone for three years like they had
[59:51] and you're so spiritual you can look
[59:53] down on Azusa you don't they don't
[59:54] really know they don't know nothing
[59:55] about Azusa Street
[59:59] they're just as if they're a preacher or
[1:00:00] they're a pastor they're just trying to
[1:00:01] get money and and live their best life
[1:00:03] now that's what they're trying to do
[1:00:07] I better stop there I'm being real
[1:00:09] critical here but you understand right
[1:00:12] there's a few There Be Few there be
[1:00:14] preachers that find it praise God Jesus
[1:00:17] and few people will find the narrow road
[1:00:19] that leads to eternal life praise God
[1:00:21] but blessed are guys when you see the
[1:00:23] way to eternal life blessed are your
[1:00:25] ears when you hear the way to eternal
[1:00:27] life
[1:00:28] now brother Adam says this it was like
[1:00:31] on the day of Pentecost it was like God
[1:00:33] planting a tree that was the church was
[1:00:35] like a tree now when God not when this
[1:00:38] tree that God planted it was to Bear
[1:00:40] nine different gifts of the Spirit
[1:00:43] nine kinds of fruit nine different kinds
[1:00:45] which means nine spiritual gifts nine
[1:00:47] gifts of the Spirit to go with the nine
[1:00:49] spiritual gifts that was God's tree he
[1:00:51] planted it in the Earth on the day of
[1:00:52] Pentecost I'm just going to skip ahead
[1:00:53] I'm just going to skip ahead here
[1:00:56] let me just go to the history here yeah
[1:00:57] let me just skip ahead that's all good
[1:00:59] and maybe I'll preach that Wednesday
[1:01:00] okay
[1:01:01] but let me just skip ahead because I got
[1:01:03] a lot of I got a lot of research yet to
[1:01:04] do on the Susan Street revive
[1:01:06] now I have I have one uh dictionary and
[1:01:09] I have numerous YouTube videos I got
[1:01:11] another book I just haven't read it and
[1:01:12] put it up here so I have two books and
[1:01:14] like four or five YouTube videos
[1:01:16] now the Revival only lasted about seven
[1:01:19] years I think of that brother Brandon
[1:01:21] said a preacher could last his Revival
[1:01:22] lasts for about three years
[1:01:25] in other words that preacher remained on
[1:01:27] fire for about three years but then he
[1:01:28] just has to live off that Revival the
[1:01:29] rest of his
[1:01:30] rest of his life in other words he keeps
[1:01:32] getting greater now I've seen it I could
[1:01:34] name some message evangelists that for a
[1:01:36] few years oh that's getting more and
[1:01:38] more and more excitement around the
[1:01:39] ministry but now it's just kind of
[1:01:40] leveled off
[1:01:42] I could name some up here but I'm not
[1:01:43] going to do that because I'm on live
[1:01:44] YouTube live stream
[1:01:46] I've seen in my life
[1:01:48] well for about three years there I kept
[1:01:50] getting more and more invitations my
[1:01:51] wife and I we traveled all over the
[1:01:52] place my my Ministry kept getting more
[1:01:55] and more accepted and then just kind of
[1:01:57] cooled off now
[1:01:58] it happens every preacher
[1:02:00] right if you really that a god you'll
[1:02:02] just go higher and higher and higher
[1:02:03] then then he's got a message you just
[1:02:05] got to live off that Revival
[1:02:07] you gotta stir yourself up
[1:02:09] stay in the spirit keep all the sin out
[1:02:10] of your life
[1:02:12] you get a reputation off what God did in
[1:02:16] that three-year Revival span that's what
[1:02:18] that's what that's what Seymour did too
[1:02:21] now before the Revival though
[1:02:24] all these subjects were being preached
[1:02:26] for years God's returning us to the New
[1:02:28] Testament glory amen
[1:02:30] expect the latter rain
[1:02:33] expect God to uh that the return to the
[1:02:36] apostolic faith once delivered to the
[1:02:38] apostles Jude 1 verse 3.
[1:02:41] you can experience overcoming life you
[1:02:43] can have personal Holiness you could
[1:02:45] have sanctification the Pentecostal
[1:02:47] baptism of the Full Gospel
[1:02:50] you can have that and there was a book
[1:02:52] even written but wrote about it in 1870
[1:02:54] about the three works of Grace
[1:02:56] Hallelujah
[1:02:58] and they started using the Scofield
[1:03:00] bible because the Scofield bible points
[1:03:02] to a pre uh Millennial Rapture I'm sorry
[1:03:05] no pre-tribulation rapture
[1:03:09] he was very influential in showing
[1:03:10] people the Rapture takes place before
[1:03:12] the tribulation period
[1:03:16] now Los Angeles had heard of Evan
[1:03:18] Roberts 1904 Revival in Wales for the
[1:03:21] past two years and they established
[1:03:22] prayer meetings because that's how it
[1:03:24] started
[1:03:25] Evan Roberts now I I watched a
[1:03:28] documentary on him he said the Lord
[1:03:30] Jesus appeared to him like every day for
[1:03:32] a month
[1:03:33] preparing him to start praying for the
[1:03:35] Revival that's that's what the video
[1:03:37] said I don't know if that's real or not
[1:03:40] but then he started he was a co-worker
[1:03:43] coal miner worker he had to leave the
[1:03:45] coal miner worker job and then he
[1:03:46] enrolled in a seminary
[1:03:48] so he because God Jesus was visiting and
[1:03:50] he devoted his time to prayer
[1:03:53] remember church this is the prayer he
[1:03:55] prayed Lord send the Holy Ghost more
[1:03:57] powerful
[1:03:59] he said Lord send the Holy Ghost to
[1:04:01] Wales for your sake you've heard me say
[1:04:04] that before haven't you Lord send the
[1:04:06] Holy Ghost to Akron for your sake
[1:04:10] and his other prayer was Lord Ben me in
[1:04:12] other words I'm stiff and I'm just a
[1:04:14] human bend me make me flexible help me
[1:04:16] to move by your spirit that was his
[1:04:19] prayer bend me that's why I like that
[1:04:21] song mold me
[1:04:23] how about this break me break me in my
[1:04:25] bad habits
[1:04:28] right break me of my unbelief
[1:04:31] mold me shake me how about this one fill
[1:04:34] me praise God right now I'm filled with
[1:04:36] uh discouragement right now I'm filled
[1:04:38] with doubt or fears fill me with the
[1:04:40] Holy Ghost instead praise God
[1:04:45] so see word spreads when there's a
[1:04:48] Revival word spreads
[1:04:51] right most of you know I got saved in
[1:04:53] that Lima Ohio Revival everybody almost
[1:04:55] everyone in the message heard about that
[1:04:58] we've gone to different places and they
[1:04:59] said oh are you part of that you better
[1:05:01] believe I was part of that Hallelujah
[1:05:03] that's one of the preachers that come
[1:05:04] out of that Revival
[1:05:06] Hallelujah
[1:05:07] see when the when God moves people hear
[1:05:10] about it and it gets exciting
[1:05:13] it spreads
[1:05:16] see
[1:05:17] and what was the cause of that Revival
[1:05:19] brother Craig brother Brooks and brother
[1:05:21] Dave were praying Simon was praying for
[1:05:24] Revelation Simon was seeking God in the
[1:05:26] prayer closet for months
[1:05:29] brother Brooks was fasting for Revival
[1:05:31] and they got the Revival praise God
[1:05:33] Hallelujah
[1:05:36] oh it's beautiful
[1:05:38] now William Seymour was the leader of
[1:05:41] the Zuzu Street Revival
[1:05:42] uh when he had polio and he lost sight
[1:05:46] in one eye so in some one of these
[1:05:48] pictures you might see him like his eyes
[1:05:49] like kind of glazed over
[1:05:51] so he was a one-eyed preacher when I
[1:05:53] preacher
[1:05:55] now he sat under Charles parnam who
[1:05:57] taught the third work of Grace was the
[1:05:59] evidence of tongues now what's
[1:06:00] interesting he preached this even though
[1:06:02] he never spoke in tongues he believed it
[1:06:05] now church that gives us a little bit of
[1:06:06] insight if we want Revival we still got
[1:06:09] to preach it even if we haven't seen it
[1:06:11] the church said if we want Miracles if
[1:06:14] we want more gifts of the Spirit if we
[1:06:16] want more faith we've got to preach it
[1:06:18] until we get it praise God
[1:06:20] to preach it to bring the people up into
[1:06:23] the faith expectation I want more of God
[1:06:25] I want to see more of God Holy Spirit
[1:06:27] flow through me today praise God
[1:06:31] to preach it
[1:06:33] the people got to be under expectation
[1:06:35] so there's a picture there's William
[1:06:37] Seymour uh I think that's his bad eye
[1:06:39] because he's got his right eye that's
[1:06:41] the bad eye
[1:06:43] I don't know any of these guys well
[1:06:44] that's a
[1:06:45] that's Charles partner he was a guy that
[1:06:47] taught three works of Grace So William
[1:06:48] Seymour sat under him now there was
[1:06:50] segregation in those days Seymour
[1:06:53] enrolled in his school but he was
[1:06:54] because he's black he wasn't allowed to
[1:06:55] sit in the room he had to sit in the
[1:06:57] room across the hall and listen but he
[1:06:59] was so hungry for God he even he even
[1:07:01] did that
[1:07:04] anybody know who that is say it out loud
[1:07:06] anybody knows
[1:07:08] FF Bosworth
[1:07:10] Hallelujah Christ's the Healer he wrote
[1:07:13] that book Christ the Healer
[1:07:15] president said FF Bosworth he says one
[1:07:18] of those oak trees
[1:07:19] he said go sit under that oak tree get
[1:07:21] some shade he said learn under FF bosma
[1:07:23] so guess who was at Azusa Street
[1:07:29] who did FF Bosworth come out of
[1:07:31] retirement to follow well
[1:07:34] who did FF Bosworth come out of
[1:07:36] retirement to follow brother Branham
[1:07:40] to see Church Our Roots go all the way
[1:07:42] back to Pentecost
[1:07:44] Hallelujah sorry to lose the street and
[1:07:46] then they go all the way back to
[1:07:47] Pentecost
[1:07:49] Hallelujah I can trace my spiritual
[1:07:51] Roots all the way back to Azusa Street
[1:07:55] right William C Moore FF Bosworth
[1:07:58] brother Branham Tom Brown Isaiah Brooks
[1:08:02] and then me
[1:08:03] I can chase it all the way back to zoosa
[1:08:06] Street and in one way I was there
[1:08:10] right in the mind of God I was there I
[1:08:13] was a part of the family of God
[1:08:14] hallelujah
[1:08:15] in other words brother says you're
[1:08:17] identified with that you you like that
[1:08:20] event you appreciate that event the
[1:08:22] spirit of God that was there is now in
[1:08:23] you praise God and the spirit of God
[1:08:25] that was there is producing the same
[1:08:27] life in your life that it manifested in
[1:08:30] that Revival praise God
[1:08:33] Hallelujah
[1:08:35] see more they say wasn't a shouter he
[1:08:38] was a teacher he they say he talked real
[1:08:40] slow
[1:08:42] he would just talk talk preach teach the
[1:08:45] scriptures but then the Holy Ghost would
[1:08:47] rush you down and they'd rush to the
[1:08:49] altar
[1:08:50] or they'd raise their hands and start
[1:08:52] praising God and have a healing service
[1:08:54] or so it was either it was either a
[1:08:56] healing service a Salvation service or a
[1:08:59] sanctification service or a holy ghost
[1:09:00] feeling service
[1:09:02] three services a day for three years
[1:09:09] and I physically get tired after just a
[1:09:11] one weekend of services
[1:09:13] we'll have a Friday night a couple years
[1:09:16] ago we had a Friday night two Saturday
[1:09:18] and one Sunday I'm exhausted after four
[1:09:22] now of course I'm in I'm like singing
[1:09:24] every service or preaching or praying
[1:09:25] every service I get exhausted after four
[1:09:27] services
[1:09:29] that's just four
[1:09:31] their weekends had Friday three
[1:09:34] right Saturday three Sunday three that's
[1:09:37] nine
[1:09:39] they had nine in the time we had four
[1:09:41] and they kept going why because it's
[1:09:43] Revival
[1:09:44] they're under anointing for Revival they
[1:09:46] want more of this they're seeing it
[1:09:47] change lives they're seeing a reality of
[1:09:50] a living God praise God
[1:09:52] they were under the expected my brother
[1:09:55] amen would preach they're under the
[1:09:56] expectation for God to move and God was
[1:09:58] moving because they prayed for all that
[1:10:00] time
[1:10:02] they thought the Rapture was coming
[1:10:06] you know one of the false doctrines that
[1:10:07] split the church
[1:10:09] was that some of the sisters said
[1:10:12] in the church we're not supposed to
[1:10:14] marry
[1:10:14] because the Rapture is too close why
[1:10:16] should we marry our kids won't go in the
[1:10:18] Rapture did you know that was one of the
[1:10:19] false doctrines that split the church
[1:10:22] so see church we can't all we can't look
[1:10:24] at the Jews and say oh it's perfect it
[1:10:25] wasn't perfect
[1:10:27] and look what look what doctor and Satan
[1:10:29] use oh the rapture's coming don't get
[1:10:31] married we'll uh Seymour went and got
[1:10:33] married then two years after the Revival
[1:10:35] started to just improve it was okay to
[1:10:36] be married
[1:10:38] and pretty soon those sisters and one of
[1:10:40] the sisters wanted to marry him that's
[1:10:41] why she left
[1:10:46] well there's brother Seymour
[1:10:49] a real man of God
[1:10:50] and church
[1:10:52] he was different than all other
[1:10:54] preachers because he left blacks and
[1:10:55] whites come together and praise God
[1:10:57] remember part of them separated them
[1:11:01] because it was you know that was the age
[1:11:02] of the the segregation laws separate
[1:11:05] bathrooms separate schools separate
[1:11:06] water fountains but Seymour said we're
[1:11:08] breaking down all those walls that's why
[1:11:10] God honored him praise God
[1:11:12] he had the unity of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:19] see because he couldn't see that in the
[1:11:21] Bible where in the Bible do you separate
[1:11:22] Jews and gentiles
[1:11:23] Hallelujah and we're all Gentiles here
[1:11:26] right right so the white the white
[1:11:29] people were separating Gentiles when the
[1:11:31] Bible never says to separate gentiles
[1:11:34] see it was just Satan in a different
[1:11:35] form Satan would attack Jew Gentile when
[1:11:37] I was Satan dividing gentiles save Satan
[1:11:40] same liar same deceiver same divider but
[1:11:42] God's a great unifier Hallelujah
[1:11:45] amen
[1:11:50] so there's that Bosworth he was the same
[1:11:52] one that Azusa Street there
[1:11:58] so here's where the prayer meeting
[1:11:59] started just this Bonnie Ray Street in
[1:12:02] California
[1:12:05] now Seymour was living in another house
[1:12:06] I think but then they started they had
[1:12:08] uh they caught it Cottage prayer
[1:12:09] meetings
[1:12:13] I'm almost at my hour okay
[1:12:19] and so when the Holy Ghost first fell it
[1:12:21] was at this house
[1:12:24] so let me keep moving on here
[1:12:26] the Revival was the result of house
[1:12:28] prayer meetings at that house Bonnie
[1:12:30] Bray Street
[1:12:32] it was on a Monday night the Holy Ghost
[1:12:33] fell so teachers don't limit God has got
[1:12:35] to come on Sunday morning
[1:12:36] it can come any night of the week
[1:12:39] April 9th
[1:12:41] well the man was born what April
[1:12:43] thank you it was April 9th was it six
[1:12:46] okay my dad was born the fourth okay
[1:12:47] brother Brad was born in the six okay
[1:12:52] at a prayer meeting Edward Lena Edward
[1:12:54] Lee was the man who let Seymour move in
[1:12:57] with him after Seymour traveled from
[1:12:59] Texas
[1:13:00] uh he got invited to come be the pastor
[1:13:03] of a woman a woman's Church a woman
[1:13:05] pastor's Church
[1:13:07] said I feel the Lord to have you come he
[1:13:09] spent the whole weekend preaching on
[1:13:10] three works of Grace tongues of the
[1:13:12] evidence he went out to get lunch he'd
[1:13:13] come back and they locked the door and
[1:13:15] he got locked out of his own church he
[1:13:18] just preached a few services
[1:13:19] and so this Edward Lee had mercy and
[1:13:21] said I'll just you're a preacher no no
[1:13:23] money no food no job just come and live
[1:13:26] with me
[1:13:27] but then Edward Lee saw Seymour go down
[1:13:29] to his knees and start praying five
[1:13:31] hours every single day and then he
[1:13:33] started praying with him Edward Lee was
[1:13:35] a banker so he would he would pray with
[1:13:38] Seymour and then they would pray
[1:13:40] sometimes they prayed all night the
[1:13:41] history says
[1:13:43] not every time but sometimes they pray
[1:13:44] all night and then he'd get up and he'd
[1:13:46] leave and go work at the bank he was a
[1:13:48] teller at the bank in California
[1:13:51] see that gives me hope if I'm a school
[1:13:53] teacher or if you're a teller the Holy
[1:13:55] Ghost can still fall praise God in a
[1:13:57] powerful way
[1:13:58] amen
[1:14:02] there's my hour so let me see how I can
[1:14:04] close here
[1:14:07] but after praying February March April
[1:14:10] they have a night bible study Seymour
[1:14:12] preached Acts chapter 2 verse 4.
[1:14:15] and after he preached that the verse I
[1:14:17] opened up with after he preached that
[1:14:18] verse Lee came up for prayer
[1:14:20] and Seymour prayed for him who never
[1:14:22] spoke with tongues just preached it and
[1:14:25] he started speaking in tongues
[1:14:29] and that was the night the Revival
[1:14:32] started let me show you his wife uh
[1:14:34] so Jenny Jenny Seymour was there as well
[1:14:37] so they weren't married at that point
[1:14:40] but she's the one she was just sitting
[1:14:42] you know after Edward Lee come up for
[1:14:43] prayer she was just sitting and once he
[1:14:45] started speaking in tongues the Holy
[1:14:46] Ghost knocked her out of her chair and
[1:14:48] she started speaking in tongues
[1:14:51] after she got up she went over to the
[1:14:52] piano this is her own testimony she
[1:14:54] started playing and singing in tongues
[1:14:56] and had never played piano before
[1:14:59] how long do they pray for church
[1:15:01] two and a half months
[1:15:03] how long would they pray for
[1:15:06] now there's no formula but I'm just
[1:15:08] saying if we want to see God move we got
[1:15:09] to be more dedicated
[1:15:12] I mean I appreciate all God's movement
[1:15:14] now but if we want to see God move in a
[1:15:16] more greater way we got to be more
[1:15:17] consecrated to God
[1:15:25] and then of course he married her a few
[1:15:27] years later I think two years later I
[1:15:28] think
[1:15:30] uh this this the woman that wanted to
[1:15:33] marry him was a white woman
[1:15:35] and so uh
[1:15:37] he knew about it Seymour knew about it
[1:15:39] and he liked her but he asked uh parnam
[1:15:41] you know should I marry and he said no
[1:15:43] don't do interracial marriage so he took
[1:15:44] that you know because it was it was
[1:15:46] illegal
[1:15:47] it was illegal
[1:15:49] and so he told the woman no and then he
[1:15:52] took uh Jenny to be his wife
[1:15:55] so these were real I mean you gotta we
[1:15:56] had to live through difficult times
[1:15:58] church we have I mean there's
[1:16:00] we're all called to live through
[1:16:01] difficult times and go through trials
[1:16:03] but the Lord Jesus will guide us through
[1:16:05] all those trials
[1:16:06] he'll give us the wisdom of the Holy
[1:16:08] Spirit how many believe that
[1:16:09] Hallelujah
[1:16:12] and even I'll just I'll just share this
[1:16:13] even after he died in in 1922 she was
[1:16:17] the pastor I think for 14 to 16 more
[1:16:20] years she was the pastor a woman pastor
[1:16:23] now I don't think she preached but she
[1:16:25] she was the one that was in charge
[1:16:30] so we'll we'll learn more about uh this
[1:16:33] Lord willing Wednesday
[1:16:38] yeah so he arrived in Los Angeles in
[1:16:40] February he was instantly rejected
[1:16:41] though he never spoke in tongues
[1:16:43] he was taken in by the two different
[1:16:45] families he had one family then the
[1:16:46] other family and started praying five
[1:16:47] hours a day
[1:16:48] and then the spirit in April the spirit
[1:16:50] said now you've got to increase it to
[1:16:51] seven hours a day of prayer
[1:16:55] praise God
[1:16:59] within one week of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:01] falling at that uh house right there
[1:17:05] that very night all the noise was spread
[1:17:08] abroad people came to see what it was
[1:17:09] they started preaching that night and
[1:17:11] people started getting saved
[1:17:13] they had Services there for about 10
[1:17:14] days they had so many services there to
[1:17:16] that porch
[1:17:18] collapsed
[1:17:20] and they couldn't have service anymore
[1:17:21] so they had to go rent the building on
[1:17:23] Azusa Street that's why it's called the
[1:17:25] Azusa Street Revival
[1:17:27] but then the noise and the worship and
[1:17:29] the praise and the tongues and the
[1:17:30] shouting and the piano it was also
[1:17:32] glorious it attracted all the people
[1:17:35] and it became so much over those days
[1:17:37] that the porch collapsed and they had to
[1:17:38] go rent a building so here's the
[1:17:40] that's the there's brother Seymour right
[1:17:42] there just a small Building compared to
[1:17:44] here's the size of cars this is like
[1:17:46] it's maybe two or three car lengths wide
[1:17:48] to stay in a big building probably like
[1:17:50] a lot a lot like our little place here
[1:17:52] you know
[1:17:53] except smaller
[1:17:55] they had upstairs in the downstairs
[1:17:59] for this this is the is uh this was the
[1:18:02] building on Azusa Street
[1:18:05] now let me I'll just close to this or
[1:18:07] I'm sorry let me read this and I'll move
[1:18:08] to my closing
[1:18:10] so Services were long often spontaneous
[1:18:12] there was no order like we always sing
[1:18:14] first and then preach and then pray or
[1:18:16] sing they had no order there was
[1:18:19] absolutely no order
[1:18:21] whatever God wanted to do they would
[1:18:23] they would just wait
[1:18:24] and do it they would just wait till
[1:18:25] someone was moved by the Holy Spirit
[1:18:29] and music was mostly instrumental you
[1:18:31] know we have the blessing of having all
[1:18:32] the instruments most Services had no
[1:18:33] instruments and
[1:18:35] pardon me
[1:18:37] acapella what did I say
[1:18:39] instrumental yeah sorry thank you
[1:18:42] appreciate that
[1:18:44] so they'd have songs testimonies prayer
[1:18:47] altar calls for each of the three works
[1:18:49] of Grace whatever the spirit said
[1:18:50] whatever the people needed that's what
[1:18:52] the spirit would do call them up for
[1:18:53] sanctification call them up for
[1:18:55] salvation call them up for the baptism
[1:18:57] Holy Ghost call them up for healing
[1:18:59] it was constantly calling the people up
[1:19:01] to the altar to pray
[1:19:05] and then Seymour would preach when he
[1:19:07] felt let the Lord too
[1:19:09] I've heard two different things I've
[1:19:10] heard that he sat with a peach basket on
[1:19:13] his head until he felt led to preach or
[1:19:16] he hid between two empty shoe boxes
[1:19:19] he would just sit in these empty boxes
[1:19:21] and just wait humble himself until God
[1:19:23] said go preach that's how he waited for
[1:19:25] his sermons
[1:19:28] so he was in charge but allowed freedom
[1:19:31] there's prayer for the sick shouting
[1:19:33] some were slaying the spirit sometimes
[1:19:36] there's periods of just extended silence
[1:19:37] just waiting on God
[1:19:40] and sometimes there was singing in
[1:19:41] tongues as well see I don't know if that
[1:19:43] was interpreted or not that's why I
[1:19:44] don't know is that the right thing
[1:19:46] got the wrong thing because the Bible
[1:19:48] says when you walk in and everybody's
[1:19:49] speaking in tongues it's confusion
[1:19:51] so I'm not sure I don't want to call the
[1:19:53] Holy Ghost something wrong if the Holy
[1:19:55] Ghost was doing it
[1:19:56] right never want to blaspheme I know as
[1:19:59] a Believer we never blaspheme on purpose
[1:20:01] God knows our hearts we would never
[1:20:02] Blast From God on purpose
[1:20:04] right we would never say anything wrong
[1:20:05] on purpose
[1:20:10] and no offerings were collected look how
[1:20:12] this man lived he lived off that house
[1:20:15] he lived off Edward Lee
[1:20:18] until they got the church and then they
[1:20:19] just had a box that was set up in the
[1:20:21] back and people would drop in offerings
[1:20:23] and that support the church he never
[1:20:24] asked for it they never took up any
[1:20:25] offerings
[1:20:27] history says people would have to go up
[1:20:29] and push money into his pockets and run
[1:20:31] away just to give him money because he
[1:20:33] wasn't after money
[1:20:35] that's something
[1:20:37] this is how humble this man was brother
[1:20:39] Seymour
[1:20:41] all right let me close to this I got a
[1:20:42] lot of history about I'm gonna
[1:20:45] let me yeah I'm sorry
[1:20:49] I'll go to the lessons on Sunday there's
[1:20:50] a lot of lesson or Wednesday
[1:20:52] so I want to close to this because I
[1:20:53] already preached an hour and seven
[1:20:55] minutes
[1:20:56] the same Holy Ghost Church is available
[1:20:58] to every generation
[1:21:02] brother said that's why each Revival has
[1:21:04] I'm sorry each generation had its own
[1:21:06] Revival a chance at the word aren't you
[1:21:07] glad you get a chance at it
[1:21:09] praise God
[1:21:11] church I feel like if we just prayed one
[1:21:13] hour a day what would happen in our
[1:21:15] lives we're in the midst of later to see
[1:21:17] with all this Darkness I mean most
[1:21:20] deception of any age if we just prayed
[1:21:21] one hour a day what would what would
[1:21:23] change in our lives
[1:21:25] now think about it we can eat over an
[1:21:27] hour a day if you you add up all the
[1:21:28] times you're eating a meal
[1:21:32] think of all the time maybe you're
[1:21:33] listening to listen to something
[1:21:36] for just an hour what if we could pray
[1:21:38] one hour a day
[1:21:43] see each each generation gets its own
[1:21:45] Revival at the word another chance
[1:21:50] so The Sovereign God at the Judgment
[1:21:51] John Wesley's group will raise up and
[1:21:53] these starch wash methodists of today
[1:21:55] will answer for it
[1:21:56] see that's what Seymour was he was a a
[1:21:58] real Wesleyan
[1:22:01] right
[1:22:02] but then the wesleyans kicked him out of
[1:22:04] the church because he believed in
[1:22:06] Holiness he moved on into deeper things
[1:22:08] of God
[1:22:09] so he was actually rejected in his day
[1:22:11] by most of the churches
[1:22:14] Luther will raise up the Catholics Ariza
[1:22:16] back behind iranius Martin cauliflower
[1:22:18] from those and will have to stand the
[1:22:20] Judgment for hybriding the word of God
[1:22:21] to dogmas this group of lutherans that
[1:22:23] filed Luther's Revival will answer the
[1:22:25] same thing they the Buddha group of
[1:22:28] Baptists that followed John Smith's
[1:22:29] Revival will do the same thing Alexander
[1:22:31] Campbell's group would do the same thing
[1:22:32] I don't know about Alexander Campbell I
[1:22:34] never studied him and the Pentecost will
[1:22:36] do the same thing tonight goes to Azusa
[1:22:38] Street that original Revival when the
[1:22:40] Holy Ghost fell caught out of a people
[1:22:41] and God trying to get his word to it and
[1:22:44] they organize it set over there and
[1:22:45] denominated and died right there
[1:22:47] you say but look what they're doing
[1:22:49] we'll get on that a little later on
[1:22:51] today see we're coming right down to I'm
[1:22:53] just putting the seat in now then we're
[1:22:55] going to show you after a while what
[1:22:56] happened
[1:22:59] now as I close Jesus said blessed are
[1:23:01] they which hunger and thirst after
[1:23:03] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:23:08] our hunger must be for the spiritual
[1:23:10] things of God
[1:23:13] and Jesus said ask and it shall be given
[1:23:16] to you
[1:23:17] seek and ye shall find knock and it
[1:23:19] shall be opened unto you everyone that
[1:23:22] asks receives
[1:23:24] and he that seeketh findeth unto him
[1:23:26] that knocketh it shall be opened
[1:23:28] or what man is there of you whom if his
[1:23:31] son asks bread will he give him a stone
[1:23:33] or if you ask a fish will he give him a
[1:23:35] serpent if then if ye then being evil
[1:23:38] know how to give good gifts unto your
[1:23:40] children how much more shall your father
[1:23:41] which is in heaven give good things to
[1:23:43] them that ask him
[1:23:46] in Luke he says it like this if ye then
[1:23:49] being evil know how to give good gifts
[1:23:52] on your children how much more shall
[1:23:53] your heavenly father give to the give
[1:23:55] the Holy Spirit to them that ask him
[1:23:59] and now I just love this next verse now
[1:24:02] look he goes from saying if you want the
[1:24:04] Holy Ghost I'll give it to you and then
[1:24:05] he goes right back to living by the Holy
[1:24:07] Ghost
[1:24:08] being led by the Holy Ghost to cast out
[1:24:09] a devil
[1:24:11] Jesus was constantly filled with the
[1:24:12] Holy Ghost led by the Holy Ghost
[1:24:16] and he was casting out a devil and it
[1:24:18] was Dumb and it came to pass when the
[1:24:19] devil has gone out the dumb spake and
[1:24:21] the people wondered
[1:24:23] Jesus lived under the constant anointing
[1:24:25] of the Holy Spirit
[1:24:28] Hallelujah and I know each one of you
[1:24:30] want to live under a greater anointing
[1:24:31] than what you're living
[1:24:33] or else you wouldn't be here
[1:24:35] if you thought this was a domination you
[1:24:37] would have probably left already
[1:24:39] but we're here to grow closer to God
[1:24:42] and churches I showed you sometimes it
[1:24:44] takes two years it took them two years
[1:24:45] to get in the spot where they could
[1:24:47] start praying for Revival
[1:24:48] two years of prayer focusing on
[1:24:50] Supernatural Revival that's why I'm not
[1:24:52] saying we got to have more Revival today
[1:24:54] I'm not saying that but I'm saying if we
[1:24:55] want more of God we've got to invest in
[1:24:57] it
[1:24:58] because that's how it's always come
[1:25:01] because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:25:02] yesterday today and forever
[1:25:09] this verse has always been striking to
[1:25:11] me and from the days of John the Baptist
[1:25:13] until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers
[1:25:15] violence
[1:25:16] and the violent take it by force
[1:25:20] for all the prophets and the law
[1:25:22] prophesied until John
[1:25:25] so it seems like Jesus is saying those
[1:25:28] that want the kingdom of God they go and
[1:25:30] take the kingdom of God
[1:25:32] right they seize they claim for
[1:25:34] themselves they snatch it out of the way
[1:25:38] right if you were in John the Baptist
[1:25:39] day and you won the kingdom of God what
[1:25:41] would you do you'd go to John and say
[1:25:42] John baptize me I'm going to take God at
[1:25:44] his word I'm going to believe God's
[1:25:45] promise I want to be baptized Hallelujah
[1:25:50] each one of you today each one of you
[1:25:51] today I've taken you down to the waters
[1:25:53] to baptize you in the name of Jesus
[1:25:55] Christ praise God
[1:25:56] that shows at one point we've all had
[1:25:59] this desire to possess the kingdom of
[1:26:01] God
[1:26:03] but if we want more of the kingdom of
[1:26:04] God we've got to put more into the
[1:26:06] kingdom of God
[1:26:07] we've got to go take it we've got to
[1:26:09] possess the promises of God
[1:26:15] we must ask the Lord to pour out his
[1:26:17] spirit
[1:26:18] God promised to pour it out
[1:26:22] so the question is how often has you
[1:26:24] have you asked God to pour out a spirit
[1:26:27] and I want to ask will you ask for the
[1:26:30] pouring out of the spirit today
[1:26:32] musicians could come let's stand to our
[1:26:33] feet
[1:26:36] I preach an hour and 15 there by God's
[1:26:38] grace how many love the Lord today
[1:26:40] thank you Jesus
[1:26:44] how often has you have you asked for God
[1:26:46] departed spirit
[1:26:48] and will you ask for it today
[1:26:51] will we ask for it today
[1:26:54] we all know the scripture Jesus says you
[1:26:56] have not because you ask not
[1:26:59] I read about these Amazing Stories I'm
[1:27:01] thinking wow I can relate to some of
[1:27:03] them in some ways
[1:27:06] but there's some things church we can't
[1:27:07] relate to
[1:27:09] three services a day for three years
[1:27:17] and not that we have to relate to that
[1:27:22] but we have to have a desire for more of
[1:27:24] God because the Antichrist Spirit of
[1:27:27] this day says Be Rich increase with
[1:27:29] goods and have need of I'm sorry I have
[1:27:32] no need of more of God
[1:27:37] I'm sure sister Beatrice I'll just use
[1:27:38] her I'm sure see since she's coming the
[1:27:40] message she's seen how people have had a
[1:27:42] real hunger for God and then it just
[1:27:44] cools off am I right sister
[1:27:47] all right anybody could have guessed
[1:27:49] that I'm not smart
[1:27:51] right you start off with a great desire
[1:27:53] to serve God
[1:27:55] then slowly
[1:27:56] you're not asking for God to pour out a
[1:27:58] spirit anymore
[1:28:04] but God said God said I will pour it out
[1:28:09] that's what we saw with a lot of these
[1:28:10] people they just got they wanted a fresh
[1:28:12] pouring out Hallelujah tell me when a
[1:28:14] fresh pouring out
[1:28:16] and that's all we need give me a fresh
[1:28:17] pouring out so I can prophesy Vision
[1:28:20] give me a dream Lord give me a word of
[1:28:22] wisdom give me a word of knowledge it
[1:28:24] don't have to be just prophecy dreams
[1:28:26] and visions but when the spirit of God
[1:28:28] moves it it does something
[1:28:32] it flows out in other words I want God
[1:28:34] God I want to see you flow out of my
[1:28:36] life
[1:28:38] I want to see you flown to somebody for
[1:28:40] healing
[1:28:41] I want to see you flow through me
[1:28:43] to speak in a tongue
[1:28:45] or to give an interpretation how many
[1:28:48] times have I asked God to speak in
[1:28:49] tongues
[1:28:51] I'm like Lord I've given you 17 years 18
[1:28:53] years of preaching I'd love to speak in
[1:28:55] tongue just one time I've asked God for
[1:28:58] it I guess I got to ask God more for it
[1:29:01] but then again the Bible says do you all
[1:29:03] speak with tongues I might be asking
[1:29:04] contrary to what God wants me to ask
[1:29:08] but I just hear about it I read about it
[1:29:09] in the Bible I hear about it in these
[1:29:11] revivals and I just want I just want
[1:29:12] more experiences with God
[1:29:18] the question is have we asked God to
[1:29:21] pour out his Spirit on us afresh and the
[1:29:24] other question is are we willing to ask
[1:29:26] God for it today
[1:29:28] those are my two questions I'm closing
[1:29:30] the service
[1:29:33] Hallelujah
[1:29:35] I really enjoyed the worship before
[1:29:37] service I really thought the Holy Spirit
[1:29:38] I'm sorry to be in service I really
[1:29:40] thought the Holy Spirit was guiding that
[1:29:41] I was weeping and crying I really felt
[1:29:43] the prince of God
[1:29:48] just play that uh the spiral heads here
[1:29:50] my word of Prayer
[1:29:52] uh spirit Living God fall fresh on me
[1:29:55] because that's what Evan Roberts prayed
[1:29:56] and that's really what Seymour did
[1:29:59] in other words he was praying five hours
[1:30:01] a day saying Lord bend me change me
[1:30:05] in other words prepare me for this
[1:30:07] revival
[1:30:12] foreign
[1:30:14] [Music]
[1:30:34] I want a Revival and I'm here for the
[1:30:37] Long Haul praise God
[1:30:44] the Bible says verse when the Bible says
[1:30:46] follow charity and desire spiritual
[1:30:49] gifts
[1:30:50] desire the best gifts I want to see the
[1:30:53] spirit poured out on brother Chris so he
[1:30:54] can have another vision
[1:30:57] who prophesy I don't see a poured out on
[1:30:59] our sister on our brother on me I want
[1:31:02] to I want the spirit of God on me
[1:31:04] Hallelujah
[1:31:07] have I asked for it am I willing to ask
[1:31:10] for today
[1:31:14] that's the question I'm excited for this
[1:31:17] series I'm really excited you see what
[1:31:21] the Bible says we stir up our minds by
[1:31:24] way over
[1:31:26] I wonder I was thinking I was going to
[1:31:27] ask sister Naomi you remember that
[1:31:29] service when you got the Holy Ghost and
[1:31:31] they had to carry out of the service
[1:31:34] it's like me
[1:31:36] can I remember when I got the Holy Ghost
[1:31:38] what was that like
[1:31:42] what does that do it stirs you up say
[1:31:44] Lord Do It Again
[1:31:47] Lord pour out your spirit once more
[1:31:51] we sense you're coming we sense Jesus
[1:31:55] coming you see the world getting darker
[1:31:58] and more wicked we see our lives be more
[1:32:02] holy
[1:32:03] foreign
