[35:01] he can put up someone like me I don't
[35:02] know that just proves he's got a great
[35:04] gift in his life amen let's go to Acts
[35:05] chapter 2 praise God Acts chapter 2
[35:07] verse one I've been really feeling led
[35:09] to preach on the baptism of the Holy
[35:10] Ghost so I'd like to start that Series
[35:12] this morning part one I'd like to call
[35:14] it the Staggering effects of the Holy
[35:16] Ghost I like to start with there by
[35:18] God's grace The Staggering effects of
[35:20] the Holy
[35:22] Ghost and I've had a few vindications
[35:25] all although the one on my heart has
[35:27] been the most important God had a
[35:29] brother from Ghana two Wednesdays ago
[35:32] travel all the way from Ghana to come
[35:34] preach a message called the assessment
[35:35] for oil assessment is a test I'm a
[35:38] teacher I give assessments all the time
[35:40] the test for the oil and I just
[35:43] announced the Wednesday before I feel
[35:44] led to preach on the Holy Ghost series
[35:46] and here God sends a man all the way
[35:47] over across the ocean to preach there's
[35:49] going to be a sess for oil I Christ
[35:51] Fellowship thank you Lord Jesus amen how
[35:54] much he cares about us amen praise God
[35:57] so I'd like to maybe take three or four
[35:58] sermons or series sermons rather in a
[36:01] series and preach on this by the grace
[36:03] of the
[36:05] Lord Acts chapter 2 please verse
[36:10] one I want to look at the effects of
[36:13] what the Holy Ghost produces first so um
[36:16] we know what it sounds like what it
[36:18] looks like when the Holy Ghost comes I
[36:21] think we've all you know well maybe not
[36:24] I know some of us have uh been in
[36:27] atmospheres like that for our younger
[36:29] brothers they not quite sure so I
[36:31] definitely want to lay it down for them
[36:33] and all of us by God's grace because
[36:36] it's prophecy that it must
[36:39] return every now and then we thank God
[36:41] that it does uh come but it's going to
[36:44] come for a final time in the latter
[36:46] Reign so it's prophesied it's thus say
[36:49] the Lord from the prophet and in the
[36:51] Bible so I want to I really feel like
[36:53] it's it's
[36:54] crucial and uh now's a good time for
[36:57] that amen that's what I believe so
[36:59] that's why I'm feeling LED right now

[37:08] verse1 now if we can um let's read verse
[37:12] one let's read one verse one together on
[37:14] three one two three and when the day of
[37:17] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[37:20] with one Accord and in one place I'll
[37:23] read verse two and suddenly there came a
[37:25] sound from Heaven as of a in Mighty Wind
[37:28] and it filled all the
[37:30] house where where they were sitting so
[37:33] God comes as an eternal spirit but the
[37:35] wind fills the whole house so God isn't
[37:39] everywhere God is a being brother Bram
[37:41] said he's not in the tree although he
[37:43] gave life to the tree but God's not
[37:44] dwelling in the tree God's a being and
[37:47] so God came to come down and fill the
[37:48] whole room praise God Amen like a wind
[37:51] like a sound of a rushed Mighty Wind
[37:53] verse three and there appeared unto them
[37:55] clo and tongues like as of fire and it
[37:57] sat upon each of them let's read verse
[38:00] four together let's begin 1 2 3 and they
[38:03] were all filled with the Holy Ghost and
[38:06] began to speak with other tongues as the
[38:09] spirit gave them utterance verse five
[38:11] and there were dwelling at Jerusalem
[38:13] Jews devout men out of every nation
[38:15] under heaven now when this was noised
[38:18] abroad the multitude came together and
[38:19] were confounded because every man heard
[38:22] them speak in his own language they
[38:25] heard them in their own language verse
[38:28] eight I'm sorry seven rather and they
[38:30] were all amazed and marled saying one
[38:32] another behold are not all these which
[38:34] speak galileans let's read verse eight

[40:26] God bless everybody good be the house of
[40:28] the Lord praise the Lord
[40:31] uh I have a slideshow brother bang I've
[40:33] had trouble the last few weeks here I
[40:36] said a prayer I'm I ask the Lord to help
[40:38] help this will work can we do the HDMI
[40:41] here I just want to show the
[40:46] slides I think you gave me a note we
[40:48] changed it so now
[40:53] it's I don't want to show the quotes by
[40:55] God's grace
[40:57] amen for some reason it kicked me off a
[40:59] few Sunday nights ago and it always
[41:01] grees me to see the
[41:02] TV posters the movie posters and
[41:05] nonsense like that um so I just ask the
[41:07] Lord please help us I got to get
[41:09] something new we'll have to do that by
[41:10] God's grace I want to preach a series
[41:12] here on the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[41:15] uh for the person who wants to go in the
[41:18] Rapture this is the mo most important
[41:20] subject that we have KCK me
[41:25] out
[41:30] it's a ticket to the Rapture I don't
[41:33] know why it does that didn't kick off
[41:34] brother Gabe when he was here and he
[41:36] used it so I don't know by God's grace I
[41:38] guess we'll just get going here and if
[41:40] it just keeps doing that we'll just get
[41:42] rid of it I just you know like I since
[41:44] I'm a pastor I like I like for you to
[41:46] see the quotations and in the in future
[41:49] sermons I'm going to actually be playing
[41:51] some audio from Brother brandom's actual
[41:53] sermons so you can hear what it's like
[41:55] uh when the the Holy Ghost Falls I think
[41:57] it's so critical to do that by God's
[41:59] grace so part one I just want to look at
[42:01] the Staggering effects of the Holy Ghost
[42:04] we going to start seeing what it's like
[42:05] I know I know a couple people if not a
[42:07] few are searching for the Holy Ghost in
[42:09] our congregation amen and uh in that a
[42:12] wonderful thing brother said you're more
[42:14] blessed than anybody else in the world
[42:15] just to want it just to want it the gift
[42:20] of God the Eternal seal of God in your
[42:22] soul you're one of the most blessed
[42:24] people on the whole earth amen right
[42:26] Hallelujah so uh there could be hardly
[42:29] more important sermons other than we say
[42:31] outside of salvation but what I'm saying
[42:33] is this is a major the Holy Ghost is a
[42:34] major just like salvation's a major
[42:37] they're both major so they're both
[42:38] critical uh for us here so uh I didn't
[42:41] get to the next slide I had some I was
[42:43] looking for the quotes I didn't find
[42:45] them so I'm just going to skip that
[42:46] there's some quotes in 1960 where he's
[42:48] talking about the jab burn and tongues
[42:49] and we'll get to that hopefully next
[42:51] time he describes what it sounded like
[42:53] on the day of Pentecost so I want to uh
[42:55] go over what the prophet said it sounds
[42:57] like but are we read our text here 1
[43:00] through eight and uh I want to start by
[43:02] reviewing a few things by God's grace uh
[43:05] the Lord willing um also want to say you
[43:07] know I want to kind of follow up from
[43:08] Wednesday night if you didn't get a
[43:09] chance to listen to Wednesday night's
[43:10] message I hope you will I really tried
[43:13] to labor on the importance of coming to
[43:14] church praise God and uh uh I think I
[43:18] feel it's really important in this hour
[43:20] that we uh come to church every time the
[43:22] doors are open if possible praise God we
[43:24] understand that people are sick or
[43:25] something like that and so forth like
[43:27] that but but brother brandom said attend
[43:29] every service and a prophet said says
[43:31] that and I want to do it by God's grace
[43:33] uh the Bible said brother B says that we
[43:36] must gather more as we see that day
[43:37] approaching and it's hard for a church
[43:39] like ours it's hard if we're all spread
[43:41] out it's hard for us to kind of gather
[43:43] maybe during the week or the weekends uh
[43:45] so one time we can gather is at least
[43:47] twice on Sunday uh and uh I've recently
[43:50] felt led uh you know maybe we won't do
[43:53] as many Saturday night services you know
[43:54] we'll try to just do two on Sunday or
[43:57] something like that because it is hard
[43:59] uh you know I offer people I've offered
[44:01] on the emails if anyone needs a hotel
[44:02] I'm happy to pay for the hotel so you
[44:04] can stay Saturday night Sunday but
[44:05] sometimes people uh maybe don't want to
[44:08] uh don't want to accept that gift or
[44:10] whatever more and that's fine you know
[44:11] people are feel they could be feel free
[44:13] to however they feel led to or however
[44:15] they feel to be led that's fine with
[44:16] them but to me it's just so critical um
[44:20] to be in the house of God every time the
[44:21] doors are open praise the Lord and uh as
[44:24] we set through the scripture that's that
[44:25] was a FR Revelation that came to me when
[44:27] we don't come uh we forsake the
[44:30] assembling and then we we uh we lose the
[44:33] influence that we can have on others in
[44:35] the church because the Bible said we
[44:36] edify and we strengthen and we provoke
[44:39] others when we come and gather
[44:41] physically you phys just physically
[44:43] being here you provoke or Inspire other
[44:45] people to serve God better how many can
[44:48] say Amen to that if you're not here you
[44:50] can't do that and if you don't want to
[44:53] do that something's wrong with you
[44:54] because this is the body of Christ we're
[44:56] going to heaven who doesn't want to help
[44:58] and influence the body of Christ who
[44:59] doesn't want to inspire the body of
[45:01] Christ oh my I want to by God's grace I
[45:05] want to inspire the body of Jesus Christ
[45:07] I want to be a strength to them if I see
[45:08] someone with help I want to go help them
[45:10] praise God because this is God's body
[45:13] and remember Paul
[45:15] said he said many are sick and weakly
[45:17] among you because you didn't discern the
[45:19] Lord's body there it is right there just
[45:21] came to me right there amen you don't
[45:23] judge you don't treat the Lord's body
[45:24] the right way it's so crucial so uh I'm
[45:28] growing as a pastor like I said I needed
[45:30] to apologize to the church I kind of
[45:32] challenged the church two Wednesdays ago
[45:33] I said I challenge you to come to prayer
[45:35] and fasting and later I felt that wasn't
[45:37] the right thing to do so forgive me um I
[45:39] know the Holy Ghost does give challenges
[45:41] but I felt in my heart at that time I
[45:42] wasn't in the right spirit I was a
[45:44] little upset so I hope you'll forgive me
[45:46] by God's grace brother Brandon you ask
[45:48] for forgiveness when he sins you know uh
[45:51] three four four Wednesdays ago we
[45:53] preached on brother BR he asked the
[45:54] church to forgive of a critical spirit
[45:57] and he said I still have it so pray that
[45:59] I'll get delivered so he lets them know
[46:00] I've got a sin in my life I got a
[46:02] complex you pray for me I'm still going
[46:03] to preach but pray for me that it
[46:05] leaves that's that's quite that's quite
[46:07] a thing right there uh God works with us
[46:10] in the midst of our complexes praise God
[46:12] hallelujah how merciful god is and
[46:15] that's my prayer help help me and my
[46:17] human struggles not to hinder the move
[46:19] of the Holy Ghost praise God so I just
[46:21] feel it's important and critical um if
[46:24] brother brandom said it I want to try to
[46:25] do by God's grace I do it with all my
[46:27] heart if the Bible says it I want to do
[46:29] that so uh if you haven't listened to
[46:31] that please do it I think it was a real
[46:34] word from the Lord I really do by his
[46:36] grace now I want to start here a little
[46:38] bit of this is review I remember when uh
[46:40] sister Megan and Sister Amy come up uh
[46:43] in April I preached on the bride and the
[46:45] Book of I'm sorry the bride and the day
[46:47] of Pentecost sister Meg you remember
[46:49] that by God's grace and you said you and
[46:51] Amy the whole way to church he talked
[46:52] about uh I don't know if you remember or
[46:54] not but I went and looked at the
[46:56] and you you both told me after service
[46:57] we were just talking about all those
[46:58] things on the way to church about how
[47:01] does the day of Pentecost fit with the
[47:02] bride of today and so I had the sermon
[47:05] and uh I was so blessed I I appreciate
[47:07] that by God's grace it's nice to know
[47:09] when when God discerns people's hearts
[47:11] you know and and helps people so a few
[47:13] of these first quotations will be about
[47:15] that uh a few of those things I want to
[47:16] just lay this down uh the Holy Ghost
[47:19] experience we just read about is the
[47:21] same today it is not different it's the
[47:23] same praise God uh because of this after
[47:27] the Holy Ghost fell on Cornelius and a
[47:29] bunch of
[47:31] Gentiles Peter goes back to the Jews and
[47:33] he says Brothers as I began to speak the
[47:35] Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at the
[47:39] beginning that's how he knew it was the
[47:41] same because they acted the same amen
[47:44] they did the same thing they got filled
[47:46] with the Holy Ghost so Peter said I seen
[47:48] it once and now I see it again and I can
[47:51] recognize the filling of the Holy Ghost
[47:53] amen the falling of the Holy Ghost
[47:56] Hallelujah let me say like this the
[47:58] prophet understood it how it could be
[48:00] the same every time the prophet Peter
[48:02] and so did brother brandom amen he could
[48:04] recognize when it fell Hallelujah now
[48:06] here's what he says in the to in the
[48:08] pardon message
[48:09] 1963 if the blood applied the token see
[48:12] there's a token given of the blood and
[48:14] that's the Holy Spirit and when the Holy
[48:16] Spirit came down the day of Pentecost
[48:18] you know what it did to the people we
[48:19] just read
[48:20] it and every time that it will ever fall
[48:24] I'm sorry ever will come upon on the
[48:25] people it'll do the very same thing for
[48:29] Peter said the promises unto you your
[48:31] children all them that are called even
[48:32] as far as many as the Lord Our God shall
[48:34] call so let's say very same ready very
[48:37] same so the very thing we read if it
[48:40] falls this morning it'll be the very
[48:42] same thing praise God Sinners that would
[48:44] look at us would say oh they're a bunch
[48:46] of drunk people Glory now I say
[48:48] hallelujah let me be drunk on the Holy
[48:51] Ghost I don't want to be drunk on the
[48:52] world do you I don't I don't want to be
[48:54] drunk on alcohol I don't want to be be
[48:55] drunk in my sorrow I don't want be drunk
[48:57] In My Pride I don't want to be drunk in
[48:59] any of those things uh God said there's
[49:01] such a thing as a Spirit of Slumber that
[49:03] people are drunken with they go to sleep
[49:05] on God spiritually I don't know if it
[49:07] ties with the physical or not it might
[49:09] but they spiritually go to sleep and he
[49:11] said they're drunken with the Spirit of
[49:14] Slumber the Bible said so we don't want
[49:16] to be drunken with that we want to be
[49:18] alert how many our children of the day
[49:20] praise God I'm not a child of the night
[49:22] I'm a child of the day I'm alert during
[49:24] the daytime praise God Amen I'm not
[49:27] trying to wander around in the night
[49:28] time into darkness and sin I'm trying to
[49:30] be a Child of the Light
[49:32] amen different
[49:34] quote now I read this one too if you
[49:36] remember in April if not then you'll be
[49:38] blessed again amen and I heard brother
[49:40] Dwayne Lawson preaches recently which
[49:42] was a huge blessing uh I've inviting him
[49:44] to come but he's I guess looking for
[49:46] some time in his schedule we as the
[49:49] modern Church what any of these here
[49:50] screaming shouting tongue speaking acts
[49:53] 238 youngans around here so the
[49:55] denominational churches don't want the
[49:57] real Acts 2 experience they might want
[50:00] loud music or shouting or dancing but
[50:03] that's not the same as a surrendered
[50:05] life to God that's filled with the Holy
[50:07] Ghost it's different amen it has to be
[50:10] different she don't want any of them
[50:12] whooping and crying and screaming amen
[50:19] hallelujah why such a child would
[50:21] immediately put her out of her
[50:23] denomination okay repeat after me say w
[50:25] ooping readying say cry cry say
[50:28] screaming screaming that's what brother
[50:30] random said it was amen now listen I've
[50:33] been guilty in the past for one to see
[50:35] that every single service and I've had
[50:38] to apologize to the church because I you
[50:39] know as I read these quotes I didn't
[50:41] have enough discernment at the time I
[50:42] was just a young preacher you know 27 or
[50:45] whatever 26 I was so I was just and
[50:47] brother John knows he was here brother
[50:49] bang knows that I would just preach like
[50:50] it had to be every service and if it
[50:52] wasn't every service something's wrong
[50:54] and uh I got had to correct me on that
[50:56] by God's grace I'll say it like this if
[50:59] we're not having this from time to time
[51:02] something is wrong praise God something
[51:05] is wrong and I and I don't know the time
[51:07] to time I don't know if that's months I
[51:08] don't know if that's a year I don't know
[51:10] if that's two years I'll say like this
[51:12] if we're not experiencing the presence
[51:14] of Christ we'll get a little cold in our
[51:16] walk with
[51:17] God
[51:20] Amen so that's what that's what I've had
[51:22] to learn as a preacher just being very
[51:24] honest and I try to be transparent and
[51:26] very very uh
[51:28] sincere he keeps going so the
[51:31] denominational churches are pregnated
[51:32] with something because they're they're
[51:34] bringing forth members all the
[51:36] time but but she don't want none of them
[51:38] screaming say screaming scre hollering
[51:40] say hollering now how about this one
[51:43] blabber how about let's say that ready
[51:45] blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures
[51:49] that she thinks they
[51:51] are Oh Glory it would certainly
[51:54] embarrass
[51:57] now remember denominational churches
[51:58] they get in the spirit all kinds of
[52:00] things like that there must be a
[52:01] difference then between just the
[52:03] anointing and the real Holy Ghost
[52:06] filling right
[52:09] Hallelujah I was raised in Pentecostal
[52:11] churches I seen people shout speak in
[52:13] tongues dance and go out and live like
[52:16] demons I see in the message churches
[52:20] right so how you live proves what
[52:23] happened when the Holy Ghost fell was it
[52:25] just a pre temporal anointing or was it
[52:28] a real filling a real change of the
[52:31] individual amen because look if the Holy
[52:34] Ghost would really fall in a
[52:35] denomination it would ruin the
[52:38] denomination it would ruin their
[52:39] educational system all of a sudden
[52:41] they'd say we don't need our our uh we
[52:44] don't need our seminaries anymore if the
[52:45] real Holy Ghost fell praise God it would
[52:49] ruin all their organizations and
[52:51] intellectualism and their ethical
[52:53] scientific Society Church that she
[52:55] belonged to
[52:57] here so see the real Holy Ghost filling
[53:00] is a different experience than just the
[53:02] anointing just being happy remember I
[53:05] preached on that last winter brother
[53:07] there are two types of anointings
[53:09] there's one that's a real presence of
[53:10] God he said that's where you feel like
[53:12] you're going to
[53:15] die and he said there's one that's like
[53:17] bubble dancing he said that's just for
[53:18] blessings and we thank God for the
[53:20] blessings I almost took around and
[53:22] danced all the way around up here during
[53:23] song service I was said oh Lord help me
[53:24] Jesus maybe I should have maybe I'll do
[53:26] it at the end I don't know but I feel so
[53:28] good today praise the Lord I feel his
[53:30] presence I feel near to the Lord amen I
[53:32] feel refreshed I feel revived amen by
[53:34] God's
[53:35] grace that's what prayer does amen
[53:39] hallelujah so all denominations will
[53:42] look at real Holy Ghost worship and say
[53:45] ah we don't need all
[53:47] that they would throw her out the next
[53:50] Council she can't have the real Holy
[53:52] Ghost baptism so she don't want to be
[53:54] pregnated with the word
[53:55] word because that's the only kind let's
[53:58] say that together ready the only kind
[54:01] the word can bring
[54:03] forth this is a a month and a little a
[54:06] few days before he died and here he is
[54:08] preaching in Louisiana a visible Union
[54:10] the bride but this is the only kind the
[54:13] preaching of the message will produce
[54:15] praise God this kind of Acts 238
[54:18] screaming shouting hollering blabbering
[54:21] acts 238 young amen so that's what we
[54:25] expect when someone gets born again
[54:28] praise God
[54:31] Amen and I'm going to move later on and
[54:34] show what it actually means why do they
[54:37] blabber uh why do they scream why do
[54:41] they shout we're going to find out Lord
[54:42] winning in a minute by God's
[54:44] grace of course you child's being born
[54:46] but there's also something else
[54:48] spiritually that's going on there
[54:50] there's something spiritually going on
[54:51] that's why people aren't ashamed to act
[54:53] that way Hallelujah
[54:55] amen same sermon born of the spirit it
[54:58] has to be the spirit of God in it no
[55:00] intellectual Church join in Creed going
[55:02] bobbed hair pain of face there is no
[55:04] such thing as that all the all of it you
[55:05] don't find that in the word of God you
[55:07] find an oldfashioned Sanctified Holy
[55:10] Ghost filled child born of the spirit of
[55:12] God screaming Hing shouting praising God
[55:16] so when someone gets the Holy Ghost this
[55:18] is what we should hear by God's grace
[55:21] why because God just came down to live
[55:24] in them in a way he's never lived in
[55:26] them before amen glory God has taken
[55:30] residence in the house he's in the house
[55:33] is that right death has to flee amen now
[55:37] there's life where Darkness used to
[55:40] be you got a new person living with you
[55:43] now now he's living in your soul not
[55:44] just on your flesh not just uh in your
[55:47] mind but now he's living in your soul
[55:49] praise God now it's a seal now it's a
[55:51] mark As we were teaching in Sunday
[55:53] school this morning now you're marked to
[55:55] the day of your Redemption he writes he
[55:57] inscribes his word uh you are mine
[56:00] you're sealed you're marked until the
[56:02] day of redemption
[56:04] amen hallelujah I get have you I laugh a
[56:07] little bit forgive me and another notice
[56:09] what kind of children she's buing okay
[56:12] so think about that what kind of
[56:13] Believers are the denominational
[56:15] churches producing what kind of Life do
[56:17] they produce well they produce a life
[56:20] that will wear sexy clothes still right
[56:22] wear makeup they produce a life of men
[56:24] that set up to their wives right live
[56:26] and live a Godly life right still want
[56:28] to go to movies and still do to all
[56:30] kinds of evil things like that thinking
[56:32] about men you know that I meet uh
[56:34] especially at my school that's what I'm
[56:36] thinking about right
[56:38] now they tell that tells what their papa
[56:42] is whether it's the first Adam or the
[56:43] second Adam so everybody's born of one
[56:46] father amen they're either born of the
[56:48] first Adam which was death or the second
[56:51] Adam which is a quickening spirit if the
[56:54] church brings forth a child of the
[56:55] second Adam he acts the second Adam's
[56:59] way of acting like they did on the day
[57:03] of Pentecost that's the real true second
[57:06] Adam's children see right their nature
[57:09] is like his and hers amen how would they
[57:13] act when someone gets born again they'll
[57:15] act just like Acts chapter two praise
[57:18] God that's how they will act because God
[57:21] acts the same way in everybody amen
[57:23] hallelujah now there's little variations
[57:25] as we'll get to there's little
[57:26] variations between the actions but the
[57:29] ACT is a we'll get to a worship here
[57:33] rejected King 1960 remember this is the
[57:35] first time he preached beyond the
[57:37] current of time and he got that title
[57:39] rejected King from scoffield so a
[57:41] prophet can pull inspiration from just a
[57:44] we say a theologian I'll say it like
[57:46] that a scribe he pulls inspiration
[57:49] preaches the rejected King on Christ
[57:51] being rejected as King David being
[57:52] rejected as king and the same Holy Ghost
[57:55] up found the day of Pentecost which we
[57:56] all know that that was the birth of the
[57:59] new church if that same Holy Spirit
[58:02] don't bring the same experience to you
[58:05] then you got a different Holy Spirit
[58:08] than what that
[58:09] was so what do we say if you just get
[58:12] emotional but you can't live the life uh
[58:15] like we see a lot in denominations then
[58:18] the Holy Spirit came in a different way
[58:20] it only came on your flesh or maybe your
[58:22] spirit it didn't come down into your
[58:24] soul
[58:25] amen is that right Church same
[58:28] experience a different Holy Spirit
[58:30] falling it's a falling on the the body
[58:32] it's a falling upon the mind but not
[58:34] upon the soul
[58:36] amen if that don't make you live a what
[58:39] kind of life let's say that together a
[58:41] sacrificial life and not sacrificing
[58:44] what we think we need to sacrifice but
[58:46] sacrificing what God tells us to
[58:50] sacrifice it produces a sacrificial life
[58:54] and a life full of what joy and
[58:58] pleasure and the baptism of the spirit
[59:00] leading you into signs and wonders and
[59:02] miracles and things oh my it leads you
[59:06] into that and then when it leads into
[59:08] you right then these things follow you
[59:10] praise God Amen there's something
[59:13] happened Jesus said these signs shall
[59:16] follow them that believe you like these
[59:19] quotations from a man from a prophet of
[59:21] God Amen it's beautiful it must be the
[59:25] same experience you must act in the same
[59:28] way and it will produce a life of
[59:30] sacrifice that means you're not living
[59:32] for what yourself anymore what you would
[59:34] like to do you can't do anymore because
[59:36] you have to sacrifice that and you have
[59:39] to do what God has called you to do
[59:42] praise
[59:44] God so not just well say I sacrifice and
[59:46] I go to church that's good but how about
[59:48] during the week what does God want you
[59:49] to sacrifice during the week amen
[59:52] hallelujah amen a life of that means
[59:55] some sacrifice something has to die
[59:58] praise God something has some desire you
[1:00:01] have has to die and God his will has to
[1:00:04] be first in your
[1:00:06] life let me read this quote because I
[1:00:08] just felt led i i subl a PA in this
[1:00:10] quote this morning I think I I think
[1:00:13] you'd like to hear
[1:00:15] it if I were you I want to hear it
[1:00:17] that's why I think I'm going to read it
[1:00:19] brother said this in Balman Gilead 1959
[1:00:22] as I was speaking on the private
[1:00:24] interviews today and met a couple a man
[1:00:26] and the son so a man and the son I said
[1:00:28] you can never never go forward until
[1:00:30] you're perfectly satisfied and know
[1:00:32] without a shadow of doubt you're walking
[1:00:33] in God's will how many want to go
[1:00:35] forward this morning you and I cannot go
[1:00:38] forward until we have no doubt what the
[1:00:41] will of God is for our life amen what
[1:00:44] what will happen if you don't know
[1:00:45] you're wondering this for a while wonder
[1:00:47] wonder this for a while wonder that
[1:00:49] you're wanding wandering wondering
[1:00:50] wandering is not a good thing for a
[1:00:52] child of God wandering is not good good
[1:00:54] for sheep and the Sheep
[1:00:56] said wondering is not a good thing for
[1:00:59] sheep sheep need to know where they need
[1:01:01] to be praise
[1:01:03] God said you will never go forward with
[1:01:06] Christ until you know exactly what
[1:01:08] you're supposed to do how do you know
[1:01:10] what you're supposed to do well brother
[1:01:12] M said you can work either way you see
[1:01:13] you can work like Gideon and ask for
[1:01:15] signs or you can sit there and let God
[1:01:17] just sit there and receive the word of
[1:01:19] God and accept the word of God with
[1:01:20] faith drop it in your heart he said you
[1:01:22] can work one of either way and he said
[1:01:24] God will work with you whichever way you
[1:01:26] choose listen in the 1960 uh series on
[1:01:29] adoption that's where he says it he said
[1:01:30] God will work with you in any way you're
[1:01:32] built anything you need God will give it
[1:01:34] like my brother Simon and I we're we
[1:01:36] need signs we need to lay fleeces before
[1:01:39] the Lord and we need to see God give us
[1:01:40] a please and then I can say
[1:01:42] hallelujah right but some people are't
[1:01:45] that way they don't ask God for signs
[1:01:46] they they we say like they don't put God
[1:01:48] to the test with a vow they just they're
[1:01:50] not built that
[1:01:51] way but whichever way you're built you
[1:01:54] need to to find what you're supposed to
[1:01:55] do in this life amen because remember if
[1:01:58] you don't know the will of God Jesus
[1:02:00] said you might be lost because Jesus
[1:02:03] said they said Lord Lord have we not
[1:02:05] done this and he said you haven't done
[1:02:07] the will of God only those who will do
[1:02:09] the will of God enter the kingdom of God
[1:02:12] Amen now God's grace is that you can do
[1:02:14] the will of God the last few moments of
[1:02:16] your life and still go to heaven like
[1:02:17] the thief on the cross that's God's
[1:02:18] grace but that's not the will of God I
[1:02:20] want to live amen that's right I want to
[1:02:22] find out as soon as I can to know God's
[1:02:24] will walk in it do it sacrifice
[1:02:26] everything that would try to pull me and
[1:02:28] distract me away and do have a laser
[1:02:30] vision and be centered in be zeroed into
[1:02:33] the target of God and know exactly what
[1:02:35] I'm supposed to do and do it with joy in
[1:02:37] my heart with full of joy and pleasure
[1:02:39] and Lead Me into signs Miracles and
[1:02:41] wonders that's the kind of life I want
[1:02:42] to live amen
[1:02:44] Glory
[1:02:46] Hallelujah I thought you might like that
[1:02:48] well the cod's not done so bear with
[1:02:51] me then when you know you're in God's
[1:02:53] Will and walking in his way nothing can
[1:02:56] stop
[1:02:57] you it's you're Invincible because you
[1:03:00] know where you're standing you know the
[1:03:02] way you're going you know what's you've
[1:03:04] got in your mind you know what the will
[1:03:06] of God is and then you can do
[1:03:09] it now sister Amy's not here she thought
[1:03:11] told me she was going to be out today um
[1:03:13] but she asked me one time you know she
[1:03:14] said can you preach on the gifts of the
[1:03:15] Spirit and I preached on Jesus gifts of
[1:03:17] the Spirit but then I heard a good quote
[1:03:19] I'd forgotten about so I want to share
[1:03:20] that this morning brother brand said the
[1:03:22] way to know your gift now I don't want
[1:03:24] to get gift before the baptism of Holy
[1:03:25] Ghost baptism the Holy Ghost is first
[1:03:27] but for those of us who say we got it
[1:03:28] I'm just going to add this in here this
[1:03:29] morning brother said they ask how do you
[1:03:31] know you're called to preacher how you
[1:03:32] know you got a gift he said because you
[1:03:34] can do it I'm gonna say that again how
[1:03:37] do you know you have the gift of tongues
[1:03:39] because you can do it
[1:03:41] Hallelujah isn't that so simple how do
[1:03:44] you know you got to get to prophesy
[1:03:46] because you do
[1:03:47] it that's how brother said you know
[1:03:49] you're a preacher you do it you preach
[1:03:53] amen amen is that right how you know you
[1:03:56] got the GI of knowledge I give knowledge
[1:03:58] that's anoint of the Holy Ghost how do
[1:04:01] you know you got to get the wisdom God
[1:04:02] gives me wisdom for people and it's
[1:04:04] anointed to the Holy Ghost and it helps
[1:04:06] them out that's how I
[1:04:08] know God is not going to ask you to do
[1:04:11] something that he hasn't equipped you to
[1:04:13] do praise God so I I take that quote I
[1:04:17] apply it to my life how do I know I'm a
[1:04:18] pastor because I do it I've stood here
[1:04:20] for 10 years recently I'll just share
[1:04:23] this just I'm going to go very very
[1:04:24] superficial recently I one of my closest
[1:04:26] friends tell me they no longer feel led
[1:04:28] to be a pastor because they've had two
[1:04:31] mental breakdowns in numerous years of
[1:04:33] being a pastor so they resigned recently
[1:04:34] for being a pastor and now they're going
[1:04:36] to the field of evangelism I said praise
[1:04:37] the Lord this is a wonderful man of God
[1:04:39] one of the finest men of God I know so
[1:04:42] you might not have heard about it yet
[1:04:43] because I think they're just they don't
[1:04:45] feel led to share with everybody but
[1:04:46] that's fine I that's respectful but I
[1:04:48] know a little bit inside information so
[1:04:49] I'm going to share that with you because
[1:04:50] I think it'll help
[1:04:51] you this person saw I tried to passor
[1:04:54] for years but when I couldn't handle the
[1:04:56] pressure I realized I wasn't called to
[1:04:58] be Pastor it hurt his
[1:05:02] family it it made his family struggle so
[1:05:05] here now listen here he's trying to do a
[1:05:08] gift or trying to think he has a gift
[1:05:10] trying it for years and years and years
[1:05:12] but seeing it really struggles the
[1:05:13] family it's not a blessing i to the
[1:05:16] family necessarily but it brings leads
[1:05:17] to
[1:05:19] breakdowns I've been sting here 10 years
[1:05:21] without a mental breakdown Glory that me
[1:05:24] I can do it by his grace are you with me
[1:05:26] Church you understand what I'm saying
[1:05:28] understand that try to understand that
[1:05:29] by God's grace I had passed out one time
[1:05:31] but that's because I was I was foolish
[1:05:33] and trying to go without without faith
[1:05:36] for healing and John caught me bless his
[1:05:39] heart oh praise the Lord but you see I
[1:05:42] never had a breakdown where feel like I
[1:05:43] wanted to
[1:05:46] quit when God's called you to do
[1:05:48] something he gives you the grace to do
[1:05:50] it you know the word gift means Charisma
[1:05:52] you know where they get that word
[1:05:53] charismatic comes from that's the Greek
[1:05:54] word for gift and that means ability or
[1:05:57] that means power someone has a gift to
[1:06:00] Pastor someone has a gift to to prophesy
[1:06:02] you've got the power already you just
[1:06:04] need the anointing in the timing of God
[1:06:06] Amen is that right that's how you know
[1:06:10] I'm not trying to get the car before the
[1:06:11] horse don't get I'm just saying for some
[1:06:13] of you who say we got the Holy Ghost
[1:06:14] then we should be doing something with
[1:06:16] some type of gift praise God and I'm G
[1:06:19] to hold you accountable because you say
[1:06:20] you believe the message and I want you
[1:06:22] to hold me accountable because I preach
[1:06:23] the message
[1:06:24] so we all hold hold each other
[1:06:26] accountable don't we amen if you see sin
[1:06:28] in my life come talk to me about it if I
[1:06:30] see sin in yours I should come talk to
[1:06:31] you about
[1:06:32] it praise God now we're starting to do
[1:06:35] like Jesus said now it's starting to be
[1:06:38] the real church is that right that's why
[1:06:40] I called the prayer and fasting time and
[1:06:42] Lord willing I'll do that again if the
[1:06:43] Lord leads me I just really felt
[1:06:44] inspired to do that I don't see Jose
[1:06:46] here here so I need to pray for his
[1:06:49] grandson brother BR said they act the
[1:06:51] same way all the way around the world
[1:06:53] whenever the holy Holy Ghost Falls
[1:06:55] here's a man who went seven times around
[1:06:56] the world he knew something about the
[1:06:58] Holy Ghost when it fell praise God just
[1:07:01] like Peter oh oh this is just like that
[1:07:04] oh pray I I feel something here amen I
[1:07:07] feel there's some power here there's
[1:07:09] some Glory here
[1:07:11] amen said this is that praise God this
[1:07:14] is that again Peter could have said 1961
[1:07:18] I noticed Down in Africa the other
[1:07:19] countries where I've been some of those
[1:07:21] people wouldn't even know which is right
[1:07:22] left hand but you know what happens when
[1:07:25] they get the Holy Ghost what they do the
[1:07:27] same thing you do when you get the Holy
[1:07:28] Ghost act the same
[1:07:31] way they will speak with tongues praise
[1:07:35] God how many love
[1:07:37] that Africans act the same way Americans
[1:07:40] do when the Holy Ghost Falls I'm so
[1:07:42] thankful for that Hallelujah now I'm
[1:07:45] talking about the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:46] Ghost here talking about the baptism of
[1:07:48] the Holy Ghost not just anointing you
[1:07:49] know to refresh you or whatever more uh
[1:07:53] I'm talking about the baptism of the
[1:07:55] Holy Ghost talking about when God comes
[1:07:57] down to dwell in you his anointing is in
[1:07:59] your soul and now brother said it's like
[1:08:03] uh he said it's it's h i can't think of
[1:08:06] it's in thirst 1965 he say it's like a a
[1:08:08] timer or like a uh blinker or something
[1:08:11] like that it blinks or it it uh it it it
[1:08:14] makes a movement every time sin comes
[1:08:16] around praise God and he said it
[1:08:18] protects your life I can't think of the
[1:08:20] actual word there the Holy Ghost is
[1:08:22] God's life in you God's spirit in you
[1:08:25] and it gives you the discernment that
[1:08:26] you need praise God to recognize sin and
[1:08:29] overcome it praise
[1:08:31] God because a holy ghost filed Christian
[1:08:33] can live a way higher life than a
[1:08:35] foolish virgin amen the wise can live so
[1:08:38] wise above the foolish Hallelujah that's
[1:08:41] one thing I never got to but if you're
[1:08:42] interested in Reading you need something
[1:08:43] to read I read Proverbs and what I like
[1:08:46] to do is go through Proverbs and find
[1:08:47] all there's I mean there's how many
[1:08:49] scriptures and Proverbs that talk about
[1:08:50] they contrast wise and foolish I thought
[1:08:52] my that'd be so good for a sermon on the
[1:08:54] wise and foolish virgin it totally shows
[1:08:57] the contrast this is Abraham this is a
[1:09:00] lot amen hallelujah Glory Hallelujah
[1:09:04] this is a David and this is a Saul are
[1:09:06] you with me
[1:09:07] church you can see it it it helps gives
[1:09:10] you Grace and helps you give you signs
[1:09:13] to know that you're on the right Road
[1:09:15] amen so in Africa they act the same way
[1:09:18] when the Holy Ghost Falls as in akan
[1:09:20] Ohio hallelujah thank you Jesus you just
[1:09:24] whenever the people in them Heathen
[1:09:26] countries receive the Holy Ghost they
[1:09:28] act just like anybody else no matter
[1:09:31] where it's that it shows it's for
[1:09:33] whosoever Will May Come remember
[1:09:37] revelation 22 the spirit of the Bride
[1:09:39] say whosoever will let him come and
[1:09:40] drink of the Waters of Life freely
[1:09:45] Hallelujah now this is what I was
[1:09:47] talking about with sister Megan and
[1:09:48] sister um Amy I preached this back in
[1:09:52] April I don't remember who is here I'm
[1:09:54] sorry if you weren't but I want to just
[1:09:55] review this real
[1:09:57] quick brother Brandon said we must go
[1:09:59] back to Acts chapter 2 before we go
[1:10:02] up that's why I'm saying this is so
[1:10:04] important I want to start getting in
[1:10:06] your
[1:10:08] mind that our church or whatever Church
[1:10:11] you feel that later to go to wherever we
[1:10:13] got to be a church that has the Holy
[1:10:14] Ghost amongst
[1:10:16] us if not then we need to pray and
[1:10:19] confess our sin and have more prayer and
[1:10:21] fasting times praise God
[1:10:26] because this is prophecy this is thus
[1:10:27] sayi the Lord Brother baram said we got
[1:10:29] to have this before we go up
[1:10:34] amen now this is thus sayi the Lord he
[1:10:36] says it twice in her will be the
[1:10:38] fullness of Pentecost for the spirit
[1:10:39] will bring the people right back so
[1:10:41] remember I said you got to go back
[1:10:42] before we can go
[1:10:44] up you got to go back to Pentecost to
[1:10:47] where they were at the beginning that is
[1:10:48] thus sayith the lord it's thus sayith
[1:10:50] the Lord because Joel 2:23 to 26 does
[1:10:53] anybody remember last Sunday what was
[1:10:54] brother Dale's text Sunday morning
[1:10:57] anybody
[1:10:58] remember it was Joel 2 18 to 26 does
[1:11:03] anybody remember that nobody remember
[1:11:06] that that's all right but as a pastor
[1:11:08] that struck me man and he didn't read
[1:11:11] this quote but this is what brother Ram
[1:11:12] said he mentioned the oil and wine
[1:11:14] remember that he mentioned oil and wine
[1:11:15] last Sunday
[1:11:16] morning we've got to go back to acts two
[1:11:20] before we go up amen says this in CH
[1:11:23] three of the church age book he that
[1:11:26] have to ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:11:27] say to the churches now I'm sorry how
[1:11:30] trag tragic it is that the first age did
[1:11:32] not listen to the spirit instead it
[1:11:33] listen to man but thank God in the last
[1:11:35] age there will be a group rise up the
[1:11:38] true Bride of the last day she will
[1:11:40] listen to The Spirit Well the spirit
[1:11:42] already just told us where we're going
[1:11:44] we're going back to the beginning
[1:11:46] Amen in that day day of gross Darkness
[1:11:50] the light will return by the pure word
[1:11:52] so i' I've got a commission to preach
[1:11:54] the pure word that brother
[1:11:56] bambro and we will
[1:12:00] return to the power of Pentecost to
[1:12:03] welcome back the Lord Jesus
[1:12:06] amen hallelujah we must go back before
[1:12:10] we go up and welcome him back amen are
[1:12:13] you with me
[1:12:15] church but God is g to have a brid tree
[1:12:17] this is 1964 all the korm eat
[1:12:19] caterpillar eat all restore sayith the
[1:12:22] Lord Malachi 4 tells will be brought
[1:12:24] back to the original Faith like it was
[1:12:26] on the day of Pentecost the Faith of Our
[1:12:29] Fathers we believe that it will come I
[1:12:31] believe it's time for it now praise God
[1:12:35] the wheat seed goes back what is it
[1:12:37] what's the whole point of the wheat seed
[1:12:38] to reproduce the same seed that went
[1:12:41] into the ground amen is that right
[1:12:44] Hallelujah that's what this message will
[1:12:47] produce but it's got to have the right
[1:12:49] kind of ground to fall on and that's our
[1:12:51] heart condition Hallelujah that wheat
[1:12:54] plant is going to reproduce seed Again
[1:12:56] The Original Seed the same seed that
[1:12:58] went down the same saints that died the
[1:13:00] same life they had is going to be
[1:13:02] reproduced in the seed at the end time
[1:13:05] at Harvest Time
[1:13:07] amen the Shu will pull away the
[1:13:09] Pentecostal are pulled away all these
[1:13:11] things like that sometimes I wonder if
[1:13:12] they're shucking the message I don't
[1:13:13] know but it's going to pull away if
[1:13:16] there's anything that's not seed it's
[1:13:17] going to pull away from the seed because
[1:13:19] it's not the seed but the seed will be
[1:13:21] seed the seed will have the same life
[1:13:23] they'll act the same way the same
[1:13:25] experience the same God the same love
[1:13:28] the same power the same Grace oh the
[1:13:31] same worship it'll be the same thing
[1:13:33] because it's the same
[1:13:37] seed now this is the quote brother Dale
[1:13:39] even mentioned last week but when I
[1:13:41] preached in April I tried to I tried to
[1:13:45] bring a little bit different angle to it
[1:13:48] we can't stumble at this one quote
[1:13:50] there's one quote in the message and I
[1:13:51] searched the message
[1:13:54] uh there's one quote where he says the
[1:13:55] word for the day of Pentecost won't work
[1:13:57] today but you've got to take that into
[1:14:00] into context now watch let's seek to
[1:14:03] understand the word of the hour now look
[1:14:04] at the sermon this is an invisible Union
[1:14:06] that is the sermon I just read you how
[1:14:08] the word can only produce acts 238
[1:14:10] speaking tongues unions right there's
[1:14:13] only one kind so in the same sermon at
[1:14:15] the end of the sermon he's saying the
[1:14:17] word that fell in the day of Pentecost
[1:14:19] will not work for this day but he just
[1:14:21] said thus say the Lord we got to go back
[1:14:22] to the beginning
[1:14:24] so what we need is an understanding how
[1:14:26] many need an understanding of that
[1:14:28] remember this is just one
[1:14:30] quote but I think it's of course it's
[1:14:32] right but I need to balance it out you
[1:14:34] have to understand this quote because
[1:14:35] it's in the same sermon he said we need
[1:14:37] acts 238 tongue speakers and that's the
[1:14:39] only kind they'll produce in this day
[1:14:43] amen no sir that was for Pentecost this
[1:14:45] is for the bride going home with the
[1:14:47] bride we got something different the
[1:14:49] Pentecostals represented that again
[1:14:51] we're in the bride age no more than the
[1:14:52] word of Noah the work in the days of
[1:14:55] Moses now here's what I brought out back
[1:14:57] in April for those who heard
[1:14:59] it God did the same and the remnant of
[1:15:02] the woman seed that was left upon the
[1:15:04] Earth today is the calling out of the
[1:15:06] Bride out of the church The Exodus for
[1:15:09] the
[1:15:11] Rapture for the church truly goes
[1:15:13] through the tribulation period as you
[1:15:14] Pentecostal Brothers has preached it I
[1:15:16] believe that the church goes through it
[1:15:17] but not the
[1:15:19] bride so we must understand this the
[1:15:22] first EX this brother Bram said was the
[1:15:24] Israel from a natural land into another
[1:15:27] natural land praise
[1:15:31] God the second Exodus brother BR said
[1:15:34] was a church out of a spiritual
[1:15:36] condition a Creed condition into he said
[1:15:39] a spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:41] condition amen hallelujah amen so the
[1:15:44] first was natural out of natural into a
[1:15:46] natural the second one was a bad
[1:15:49] spiritual into the real
[1:15:51] spiritual and now the last one is from
[1:15:54] the real spiritual Holy Ghost into the
[1:15:56] next Dimension praise God into the next
[1:15:59] life amen say it like that Hallelujah
[1:16:02] into the marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:16:03] we'll say like that or the meeting in
[1:16:05] the air it's a change of Dimension
[1:16:08] Hallelujah that's the Third
[1:16:10] Exodus now why couldn't they make this
[1:16:13] Exodus because it why can't they why
[1:16:16] couldn't they make this Exodus in their
[1:16:17] day because it wasn't the word for their
[1:16:19] day their word was to go from a
[1:16:21] spiritual condition of creed into a holy
[1:16:24] ghost experience we're enjoying
[1:16:26] today
[1:16:29] amen so he said the word that fell at
[1:16:32] Pentecost will not work today why
[1:16:34] because the word that fell at Pentecost
[1:16:36] what did Peter say the word was this is
[1:16:39] that which Joel said and it was verses
[1:16:43] 28-32 but brother B comes along and said
[1:16:45] the Rapture of the church the refilling
[1:16:47] of the Holy Ghost is in different verses
[1:16:49] that's why the word that fell on the day
[1:16:51] of Pentecost will not work for today
[1:16:54] because we have a different word it's
[1:16:56] another refilling of the Holy Ghost but
[1:16:58] it's refilling to give power for
[1:17:02] Rapture and we have this scripture as
[1:17:05] well along with many other scriptures
[1:17:06] about the Rapture I just didn't want to
[1:17:08] fill them in you can fill them in 1
[1:17:10] Corinthians 15 you can keep going all
[1:17:12] you want you can do Enoch scriptures
[1:17:13] whatever you want to do so you see so
[1:17:16] you see how that we have a different
[1:17:17] word than the day of Pentecost brother
[1:17:19] bang is that can you see that okay all
[1:17:21] right it's a different word it's
[1:17:23] different scriptures if we just look at
[1:17:25] Joel 228 to 32 there's no Rapture in
[1:17:28] there but the Rapture is in Joel 2:23
[1:17:32] because that scripture is about the
[1:17:33] Harvest and the Rapture is Harvest Time
[1:17:38] amen praise God so don't let that one
[1:17:41] quote stum you I've seen preachers take
[1:17:42] that quote and take all the emotion out
[1:17:44] of the church and now people can't they
[1:17:46] won't let the anointing get on their
[1:17:48] Spirit right they won't let they won't
[1:17:50] let the anointing let them get emotional
[1:17:52] worship God God when many times that
[1:17:54] brings you Deliverance when you get
[1:17:56] emotional praise God because God's
[1:17:59] spirit couldn't flow through your
[1:18:01] emotions but now since you surrendered
[1:18:03] or believed now the Holy Spirit can flow
[1:18:05] through your
[1:18:07] emotions
[1:18:09] amen so just Joel 22-32 will not work
[1:18:13] today we we need more than that we need
[1:18:15] the verses 23- 26 and the Rapture
[1:18:18] scriptures that have not been fulfilled
[1:18:19] by other Church ages that's how that
[1:18:21] makes sense and that's to me that's the
[1:18:23] only way that makes sense because we
[1:18:25] have other thus say the Lord quotes that
[1:18:27] say thus sayi the Lord sh the fullness
[1:18:28] of Pentecost just like at the beginning
[1:18:31] right we it's thus say the Lord all the
[1:18:34] years of cater caterpillar the canker
[1:18:36] worm Palmer worm all these things all
[1:18:39] that he said I'll restore all those
[1:18:40] years sayith the Lord
[1:18:46] amen now here's what the reality of it
[1:18:48] is and if you're you really got the Holy
[1:18:50] Ghost this morning you long for a
[1:18:53] constant return to the Holy Ghost
[1:18:56] baptism or refilling you long for that
[1:18:58] if you're born again now see I had that
[1:19:00] longing when I was hurting the church
[1:19:03] God forgive me I had that longing and my
[1:19:05] Zeal at up my wisdom I was wanting to
[1:19:07] see it so much that it became too
[1:19:10] much I feel like I was trying to force
[1:19:12] the people to get there and that was
[1:19:13] wrong I'm glad God show me my mistakes
[1:19:16] amen so I can do better but said if
[1:19:18] you're not learning constantly
[1:19:19] something's wrong with you if you're not
[1:19:20] because then you're not growing only way
[1:19:22] to grow is get pruned right yeah then
[1:19:24] you can produce more fruit so we need to
[1:19:26] be pruned uh and so we we want to love
[1:19:29] each other amen now a month before
[1:19:31] brother Brandon died he said this I know
[1:19:34] that each of you if you feel like I do
[1:19:35] I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God
[1:19:39] moving it Grieves me when I don't see
[1:19:41] the spirit of God moving in my
[1:19:43] life amen and it makes me hungry to see
[1:19:47] it is that is that how you
[1:19:49] feel he's so hungry here's a man who's
[1:19:52] seen
[1:19:53] in South Africa he'd seen he seen a
[1:19:55] parade of people walking down with a
[1:19:57] truckload full of uh crutches and
[1:20:00] wheelchairs remember that quote singing
[1:20:03] only believe he longed to see the spirit
[1:20:06] of God moving again oh my
[1:20:10] hallelujah look what he says I just
[1:20:13] can't hardly stand a year I'm sorry a
[1:20:15] month before he passes away I just can't
[1:20:18] stand it I want to see God move amongst
[1:20:20] us now look brother Brandon can't force
[1:20:22] to move any more than we can force God
[1:20:24] to move but we should long to see God
[1:20:30] move and we should hunger to see God
[1:20:33] move and that hunger can be satisfied
[1:20:36] right they who hunger and thirst for
[1:20:37] righteous shall be what
[1:20:41] fil some experiences I just had up in
[1:20:43] the mountain just to feel that once
[1:20:45] again that something that when I was
[1:20:47] first Saved our children have listened
[1:20:49] to and read the Supernatural series
[1:20:51] brother BR said when he first got save
[1:20:53] he was so excited got off his knees he
[1:20:54] said he got up and he jumped on the
[1:20:55] railroad track and he started punching
[1:20:57] like a boxer he's like I just got all
[1:20:58] this I just got all this
[1:21:00] energy he just and he starts running
[1:21:02] down the track and he's running all
[1:21:04] around because he's he's got so much joy
[1:21:06] in his heart he don't know what to do
[1:21:07] with it so he channels it through
[1:21:09] boxing he's boxing he's fighting all
[1:21:11] these things that's the only way he knew
[1:21:13] how to let it bent
[1:21:14] out and he said just to feel like that
[1:21:19] again where you feel the freshness and
[1:21:21] it's a reality and you're so sincere and
[1:21:24] you know there's nothing between the
[1:21:26] Lord and I I feel
[1:21:30] forgiven there's nothing wrong with
[1:21:32] hungering for that nothing wrong at all
[1:21:35] Jesus says you're blessed blessed are
[1:21:37] they who hunger and
[1:21:39] thirst that's why when we come to church
[1:21:41] I hunger to see that I've got to make
[1:21:42] sure I don't get upset with anybody or
[1:21:46] myself I got to just make sure I just
[1:21:48] try to love God with all my heart amen I
[1:21:51] got to be able to channel that hunger
[1:21:52] and that desire can't force it upon
[1:21:54] people you can't force God to move all
[1:21:56] you can do is worship and love God
[1:21:58] praise him and when God's timing he's
[1:21:59] going to sweep in here like a Russian
[1:22:01] Mighty Wind amen
[1:22:03] hallelujah
[1:22:05] glory and we can come into a place we
[1:22:08] can sit and seat Among Us that we are
[1:22:10] drying look at this a prophet of God
[1:22:11] saying we're drying out here it was at
[1:22:14] brother man said Arizona he said at one
[1:22:16] time right before he died he said was a
[1:22:19] spiritual desert as well you know he
[1:22:20] said that
[1:22:24] of course it didn't stay that way right
[1:22:25] because there was real good message
[1:22:26] churches out there like Loris and Karen
[1:22:28] things like that saints of God that love
[1:22:30] God was Supernatural with holy lives and
[1:22:32] all kinds of things like that but when
[1:22:33] brother BR was out there he said it was
[1:22:35] a spiritual dry place as well he said
[1:22:37] all the preachers are fighting against
[1:22:38] each other and every there's all kinds
[1:22:40] of division it's one of the most
[1:22:41] spiritual dry places you could go and
[1:22:43] this is one month before the Lord took
[1:22:45] him home he goes on to say as we sit
[1:22:47] here in the desert I get among my
[1:22:48] brethren they talk with me and I talk
[1:22:50] with them always in a little way of
[1:22:53] watching dealing out there with the
[1:22:54] spirit as it was to see just the
[1:22:57] condition of that brother to see what's
[1:22:58] wrong so brother would talk to people
[1:23:00] and listen to what they're what they're
[1:23:02] saying and he would judge huh what's
[1:23:04] wrong with their spiritual walk with God
[1:23:07] you ever try to do
[1:23:08] that
[1:23:10] you he had a gift of what
[1:23:14] discernment so he would do that as a as
[1:23:16] a Shepherd as a prophet he was called to
[1:23:19] lead you know lead God's people yet
[1:23:21] there's a c says he said by the grace of
[1:23:23] God I'm leading I'm spearheading the
[1:23:26] lead of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen I
[1:23:30] leading the Bride of Jesus Christ he
[1:23:32] said so he would talk with brothers and
[1:23:33] he would try to listen because your
[1:23:35] words will tell what's in your heart how
[1:23:36] many know
[1:23:37] that there's either life or death in the
[1:23:40] power of your tongue and your words will
[1:23:42] tell exactly what your heart condition
[1:23:45] is and if people lie and you know say
[1:23:48] things with their mouth and say say the
[1:23:50] right thing but then live the wrong
[1:23:51] thing that's called corrupt fruit that's
[1:23:54] fruit but that's corrupt fruit
[1:23:56] right and that's called hypocrisy right
[1:23:58] saying something different Jesus said
[1:24:00] how can bitter water and sweet water
[1:24:02] come out of the same power it can't so
[1:24:05] it shows hypocrisy has entered the
[1:24:07] person's life they're saying all the
[1:24:09] right thing but their life is totally
[1:24:10] different than what they're talking
[1:24:11] about oh my
[1:24:14] goodness brother Brandon said I began to
[1:24:17] feel us all what's that word reclining
[1:24:20] you ever getting your recliner I just
[1:24:21] bought my first two re I bought them off
[1:24:24] my ant I haven't had much time to
[1:24:25] recline in them lately though but he
[1:24:28] said they're getting away from the
[1:24:29] spirit so spiritually they got the
[1:24:32] recliner and they pulled back on God
[1:24:34] said hold up God I've given you enough
[1:24:37] I'm just gonna recline I give I've given
[1:24:39] you so much now I'm just gonna recline
[1:24:41] back and dry off a little
[1:24:44] bit brother Brandon saw this in 1965 a
[1:24:48] month before he
[1:24:49] passed brother BR said it in 1961 he
[1:24:52] said be encouraged he said because when
[1:24:53] the prophet left Gideon God came on the
[1:24:56] scene who was it that visited Tucson
[1:24:58] Tabernacle with Caren L God visited
[1:25:01] Tucson Tabernacle are you with me church
[1:25:04] amen so it it's a spiritual desert but
[1:25:07] once the prophet leaves then God can
[1:25:09] come on the scene amen I hope you
[1:25:11] understand what I'm saying that we would
[1:25:12] all look to God instead of a man and
[1:25:14] follow a man around and drive around the
[1:25:15] country which is fine all he's here
[1:25:16] that's fine but once he leaves who we
[1:25:18] gonna follow we gotta follow Christ amen
[1:25:22] he said it's expedient it's necessary
[1:25:25] that I go away amen because if I don't
[1:25:27] go away the Holy Ghost won't come you
[1:25:30] have to just follow a man and follow one
[1:25:31] man but if the Holy Ghost comes then
[1:25:33] you'll follow God wherever you are in
[1:25:35] aan whether you're in Pennsylvania
[1:25:37] wherever you are you'll follow God
[1:25:39] wherever you are because you're
[1:25:40] following the Holy Ghost and not a man
[1:25:45] amen it's become a too natural thing to
[1:25:48] us so the Holy Ghost has become too just
[1:25:51] becoming common to us
[1:25:52] uh Church uh prayer
[1:25:56] witnessing it's just become too natural
[1:25:59] we must Worship in the spirit where the
[1:26:01] spirit of God not only our message
[1:26:03] should be the flame of the hour it
[1:26:05] should be the flame in our hearts see it
[1:26:07] shows the message has to be in your
[1:26:08] heart or else you won't be burning
[1:26:10] bright for the lord it's got to be in
[1:26:12] your heart if not you recline away if
[1:26:16] you're not constantly thinking about oh
[1:26:17] this message is wonderful you need to
[1:26:19] find something that will stir up your
[1:26:20] heart find a sermon that will stir up
[1:26:21] your heart how you can say Amen to that
[1:26:24] this message the message the revelations
[1:26:26] God gave us has to be the fire in our
[1:26:31] heart so sometimes it's like this for my
[1:26:33] life it kind of it's just like a cycle
[1:26:35] sometimes Brother Andy I got to turn on
[1:26:37] a preacher like brother Donnie Reagan or
[1:26:39] or Tim puit and that will really give me
[1:26:41] some fire I'm like yes or brother Dwayne
[1:26:43] Lawson that really stir me up other
[1:26:45] times I gotta go back to brother brand I
[1:26:46] constantly listen to brother brand
[1:26:48] understand what I'm saying but sometimes
[1:26:49] you got to go back and listen to
[1:26:50] marriage and divorce and just stir me up
[1:26:53] again right or some of my favorite
[1:26:55] messages you know sometimes you got to
[1:26:57] go back and you gotta keep you gotta
[1:26:59] keep at the flame of your heart this
[1:27:01] message is different than all other
[1:27:03] churches you can attend this morning
[1:27:05] amen as good as Jewish churches might be
[1:27:08] at least they're trying to live holy
[1:27:09] right as good as some of these churches
[1:27:11] may be this message is God's will for
[1:27:14] the bride the true Christian in this
[1:27:16] hour it's a message that's higher than
[1:27:19] all other messages amen it takes more
[1:27:22] than human effort to live this message
[1:27:24] it takes the Holy Ghost amen
[1:27:28] glory it will take more than just a
[1:27:31] regular church membership it will take
[1:27:34] full surrender
[1:27:37] Hallelujah and so the message isn't
[1:27:39] burning in your heart then it's time to
[1:27:40] get revived because you've actually
[1:27:42] gotten the recliner spiritually and
[1:27:43] youve reclined way back I only used
[1:27:46] recliner twice and so Victoria was
[1:27:48] falling asleep on me this summer you I
[1:27:49] didn't have work so I just take her down
[1:27:51] for a nap I set her on my chest I
[1:27:53] recline back she fall asleep and I could
[1:27:54] work on my iPad and
[1:27:56] study I like that reclining that was
[1:27:58] pretty good I never fell asleep either
[1:28:01] time that's the kind of reclining I like
[1:28:03] and then Mom has a break you know the
[1:28:05] kids have a break I can just have some
[1:28:06] cuddle time you know and so for that's
[1:28:08] the kind of reclining I want to do not
[1:28:10] going away from the Holy
[1:28:12] Ghost I want to move into the Holy
[1:28:16] Ghost brother said Believers long for
[1:28:18] heaven to come down on Earth so the
[1:28:20] powers of Heaven can come down to earth
[1:28:24] they can rush in here like A Mighty Wind
[1:28:26] Jesus said it's like the wind you can't
[1:28:28] predict it right we all do that we all
[1:28:30] look at our phones okay weather's gonna
[1:28:32] be like this but sometimes it ain't how
[1:28:34] many times you looked out and it said
[1:28:35] it's supposed to be storming and it's
[1:28:36] not storming out there they're just kind
[1:28:38] of guessing right G geographically
[1:28:41] guessing right or sometimes it say the
[1:28:43] the rain might last was 90% chance till
[1:28:45] 8 o' but it's already done by 6 PM
[1:28:48] nobody can really predict it it's
[1:28:51] spontaneous and that's how God's spirit
[1:28:53] is amen we're sitting there with our
[1:28:55] human Minds is we pray we forget about
[1:28:57] our prayers years later but then the
[1:28:59] wind might rush in amen and answer some
[1:29:01] prayers hallelujah amen that's the wind
[1:29:04] of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah it comes
[1:29:06] when sometimes you're not look for
[1:29:08] it that's how atin and Benjamin came I
[1:29:11] remember I was I was I was a little bit
[1:29:13] discouraged this summer I joined hands
[1:29:15] with my children I said Lord do
[1:29:16] something Supernatural I don't care
[1:29:17] whether you save souls or whether you
[1:29:19] speak in tongues at church or something
[1:29:21] like that and then the very next day
[1:29:22] Gabe came and the rest is history by
[1:29:24] God's
[1:29:25] grace and what is there what greater
[1:29:28] what greater uh is what greater Miracle
[1:29:30] is there than

[1:29:36] don't and I just ask God said God do
[1:29:38] something stir us stir our hearts up and
[1:29:41] God did so I want to thank the Lord for
[1:29:43] that Mary's

[1:29:49] unsearchable riches of Christ because we
[1:29:51] have Fellowship together we set in
[1:29:53] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the holy
[1:29:55] ghost coming upon us and overshadowing
[1:29:57] US empowering us with gifts and signs
[1:30:00] and wonders and miracles why is the
[1:30:01] closest thing to Heaven There is on
[1:30:05] Earth and this is why we should Hunger
[1:30:07] for More of the spirit of God it is it
[1:30:10] is as if Heaven comes down to earth

[1:31:03] Spirit-filled church full of the power
[1:31:06] of God setting together in Heavenly
[1:31:09] places offering spiritual sacrifices
[1:31:12] what are those anybody know they're
[1:31:14] thanksgivings Hebrews 13 says spiritual
[1:31:17] sacrifices are giving
[1:31:19] thanks and if you're really thankful
[1:31:21] it's got come from where it's got to
[1:31:22] come from your
[1:31:24] lips we shouldn't make the song leader
[1:31:26] or the preacher we shouldn't have to
[1:31:28] have them ask us to give God thanks it
[1:31:31] should just flow out of our heart we
[1:31:34] shouldn't have to ask the river river
[1:31:35] can you flow out now can you come the
[1:31:37] river it just automatically flows out
[1:31:39] church are you with me I talk about the
[1:31:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost here when
[1:31:44] someone gets filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:31:45] we'll talk about that's kind of what it
[1:31:47] is the spirit it just has to come
[1:31:50] out but here's what brother man says
[1:31:53] Praises come out the Holy Spirit moving
[1:31:56] among them I like this Discerning
[1:32:00] sin and calling out the things that's
[1:32:03] among them that's wrong straightened out
[1:32:05] and making it a flattened level like
[1:32:07] John the Baptist brought the mountains
[1:32:08] down low brought up the valleys right
[1:32:10] that's what preaching does preaching
[1:32:11] against sin just brings it all level
[1:32:13] let's start all over amen I've got
[1:32:15] mountains in my way if I got valleys I'm
[1:32:17] stuck in let's level it out amen let's
[1:32:19] get so I can walk again amen walk
[1:32:21] straight in there are you with me Church
[1:32:24] sin often causes what remember sin is
[1:32:26] like a mountain right you got to speak
[1:32:28] to the mountain and move it
[1:32:30] amen that's what the preaching of the
[1:32:32] word does when it calls out sin or
[1:32:34] reclining or getting cold on God it's so
[1:32:37] we can we can confess that and make the
[1:32:39] make make the ground level for all
[1:32:41] Christians we can make the road a lot a
[1:32:44] lot easier to walk praise
[1:32:47] God I love that about John the Baptist
[1:32:49] he never did one Miracle the Bible said
[1:32:51] he wasn't Miracle working God as far as
[1:32:53] outward Miracles but he sure did
[1:32:55] spiritual powerful preaching he went up
[1:32:58] to Herod and said it's not lawful for
[1:33:00] you to be married to this woman and what
[1:33:01] was he doing he was raising up those
[1:33:02] valleys he was casting down those
[1:33:04] mountains of sin and leveling it out
[1:33:06] here Herod you can walk the the clear
[1:33:08] path if you just repent and put that
[1:33:10] wife away from you but he denied it but
[1:33:12] still John was doing great work he was
[1:33:14] doing good Landscaping work amen he was
[1:33:16] leveling out the land so that people
[1:33:18] could walk those who want to walk with
[1:33:20] God will walk with God amen
[1:33:26] glory so now I want to get to the day of
[1:33:30] Pentecost I really want to try to be
[1:33:32] mindful of the time here I'm about at 50
[1:33:35] minutes okay I've been always I've been
[1:33:36] constantly preaching an hour and a half
[1:33:37] I try I want to stop that a little bit
[1:33:40] try want to maybe hour 15 here by God's
[1:33:43] grace if we can do
[1:33:45] that I just I get I get nervous like I
[1:33:47] can't finish the topic okay tearing
[1:33:49] let's look at this and behold I send the
[1:33:51] promise Pro of my father upon you but T
[1:33:53] you in the city of Jerusalem until you

[1:33:59] means to wait they're to wait in
[1:34:00] Jerusalem until they're endued endued
[1:34:02] means clothed so see when the Holy Ghost
[1:34:05] falls on you it's like your soul is
[1:34:06] clothed with God's power now it's
[1:34:08] clothed with God's spirit praise God
[1:34:11] it's a spiritual garment the Bible calls
[1:34:13] it in Revelation 19 fine
[1:34:16] linen which is the what righteousness of
[1:34:20] saints you're right your Soul's
[1:34:22] righteous your soul is just because
[1:34:24] God's spirit has come upon that soul and
[1:34:27] God the Bible said once the seed of
[1:34:28] God's in you and anointed you cannot sin
[1:34:31] anymore how many know that this is what
[1:34:35] God's talking about you get endued you
[1:34:37] get clothed with power that's the Holy
[1:34:39] Ghost clothing anointing your soul
[1:34:42] praise
[1:34:43] God power from on
[1:34:49] high let's go to that let's let's go to
[1:34:52] First John if we can I believe it's
[1:34:54] chapter 3 let me turn there real
[1:34:56] quick he that's born of God cannot
[1:35:00] s and I know I'm building I'm building
[1:35:02] because I want the Holy Ghost to fall I
[1:35:04] want people to be filled with the Holy
[1:35:05] Ghost in our church that is the whole
[1:35:07] purpose of my life to preach God's word
[1:35:09] and try to get people filled with the
[1:35:10] Holy Ghost and get them saved that's why
[1:35:12] I was born on this Earth that's what
[1:35:14] God's revealed to me amen so first John
[1:35:19] I don't let anything else by God's grace
[1:35:21] get my way of that that's one thing I
[1:35:22] was called to do in my life and I'm
[1:35:23] going to do it by by his help and by his
[1:35:28] grace okay now looking for it if anybody
[1:35:31] finds it you can just speak it
[1:35:34] out I'll find it just a second yeah 1
[1:35:37] John 39 yeah sorry it's right there in
[1:35:39] front of
[1:35:41] me verse 7 let's go to 1 John 3:7 if we
[1:35:44] can by God's
[1:35:50] grace little children let no man deceive
[1:35:53] you he that doeth righteousness is
[1:35:56] righteous even as he is righteous he
[1:35:58] that committed sin is of the devil for
[1:36:00] the devil sinth from the beginning for
[1:36:02] this purpose the Son of God was
[1:36:03] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:36:05] works of the devil so why did christ
[1:36:07] come to destroy the works of Satan in
[1:36:09] your
[1:36:10] life think about when you were a sinner
[1:36:13] you used to do many works for Satan well
[1:36:15] Christ should have destroy those praise
[1:36:17] God like I was telling the brother
[1:36:18] yesterday or Austin's mom God destroyed
[1:36:22] uh my addiction to video
[1:36:24] games God destroyed my all my addiction
[1:36:26] to chewing tobacco and smoking and
[1:36:28] drinking right he destroyed that that's
[1:36:30] destroyed and I'm not gonna let it be
[1:36:32] build up again right my desire to cuss
[1:36:36] uh look at evil pictures Evil movies and
[1:36:38] things like that he took all that away
[1:36:40] he destroyed that praise God it's just
[1:36:43] like in the Old Testament where they
[1:36:44] would take out the idols they had to
[1:36:45] physically grab an idol and throw it
[1:36:47] down and smash it brother amen until it
[1:36:49] came to dust amen
[1:36:52] Glory that's what God did in my life
[1:36:54] spiritually the idol of sports the idol
[1:36:56] of Pride the idol of whatever
[1:36:58] attractiveness the idol whatever
[1:37:00] handsomeness or you know worldliness
[1:37:02] Hollywood they got to be crushed and
[1:37:04] they got to be stomped down they got to
[1:37:06] be cast down in Jesus name
[1:37:10] amen said we could use a holy ghost dust
[1:37:13] storm I think you said if I'm not
[1:37:14] mistaken a dust storm where where Idols
[1:37:17] are cast down and you stomp them out and
[1:37:20] you stomp them out of your life I can't
[1:37:22] some people ask me well cast this demon
[1:37:23] out of my life you're the one that's got
[1:37:25] to cast it
[1:37:26] out many times it's you're the one
[1:37:29] that's got to surrender you're the one
[1:37:31] that's got to get rid of it the presence
[1:37:33] of God
[1:37:34] removes uh the presence of God removes
[1:37:38] sicknesses for a while but if the
[1:37:40] person's not right with God it'll come
[1:37:42] right
[1:37:43] back praise God I've seen that I've seen
[1:37:46] God heal people one time we had services
[1:37:48] in app Point God healed a woman of nerve
[1:37:51] trouble she said she had all these and I
[1:37:52] remember it really well cuz my grandpa
[1:37:54] got healed that same day when we prayed
[1:37:55] for him he had a he had a numb he had a
[1:37:58] numb leg all the way down from his
[1:37:59] diabetes he never got rid of his
[1:38:00] diabetes but he couldn't feel his leg I
[1:38:02] prayed for him and he said he started
[1:38:03] saying Glory Glory Spanish Hallelujah
[1:38:06] glory glory alos and he come up and
[1:38:08] testified the next night that God
[1:38:09] brought all the feeling back in his leg
[1:38:11] as we prayed for him amen but the same
[1:38:15] night a woman I don't even remember her
[1:38:16] name I'm not going to share but she left
[1:38:18] the message now and I think that's why
[1:38:19] it might have come back on but she
[1:38:21] testified I remember her in tears said I
[1:38:23] all this nerve trouble in my back and my
[1:38:24] neck I can't even move and you know all
[1:38:27] kind like this you know and we were just
[1:38:28] praying there praying with brother
[1:38:29] steveen crestle brother Cam and uh
[1:38:32] different Brothers there praying brother
[1:38:33] Brooks I think was there and she
[1:38:35] testified the next night that God had
[1:38:37] completely taken out of the
[1:38:39] way but then it may come back oh
[1:38:43] my see the spirit of God does remove
[1:38:46] these things but it'll come back if you
[1:38:49] don't fill that with the Holy Ghost
[1:38:51] praise
[1:38:52] God but many times brother said uh
[1:38:55] there's a quote where brother talking
[1:38:56] about
[1:38:57] cigarettes and one time he tells a man
[1:38:59] let God take it away another time he
[1:39:01] said you got to take it
[1:39:03] away so depending on the person's makeup
[1:39:06] if they have if if they're just enjoying
[1:39:08] the sin he would be able to discern that
[1:39:10] and say you got to get rid of your sin
[1:39:12] problem and you got to cast it down
[1:39:14] another guy couldn't had no ability and
[1:39:16] he said just wait on God he believed God
[1:39:18] would do it and God did it amen
[1:39:21] Hallelujah because the quote with the
[1:39:22] one where the brother got delivered was
[1:39:24] the one where brother said do you want
[1:39:25] me to take a a carton of cigarettes up
[1:39:27] to your hospital bed and he said he
[1:39:28] didn't have to do that because he prayed
[1:39:31] for God he committed unto God he would
[1:39:33] go to Bam sermons and go out and smoke
[1:39:35] afterwards it's in the quotes you can
[1:39:36] hear it if you want he said don't worry
[1:39:39] about that he said get your eyes off
[1:39:40] your cigarettes and get them on
[1:39:42] Christ here's a man who couldn't do it
[1:39:44] on his own yet he believed God could do
[1:39:46] it and here's another man who could do
[1:39:48] it and wouldn't surrender and so brother
[1:39:50] R challenges him a different way don't
[1:39:51] you love the
[1:39:53] Lord so not every not every uh direction
[1:39:57] is the same for
[1:39:58] everybody it takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:40:00] discern our hearts where are we at with
[1:40:03] God what can we
[1:40:05] do well that was quite a thing okay so
[1:40:09] listen the disciples
[1:40:11] Carri I got 15 more minutes I'll go hour
[1:40:13] 15 by God's grace help me Jesus 10 days
[1:40:16] to fulfill the Feast of Weeks which was
[1:40:18] a type of the 50th day how many you know
[1:40:19] that
[1:40:21] I'm
[1:40:22] sorry pardon me can we go back to our
[1:40:24] Bibles first John 39 I didn't even get
[1:40:26] to the
[1:40:28] scripture oh help me
[1:40:31] Jesus Lord you know I love you Lord
[1:40:34] Jesus first joh
[1:40:37] 39 whosoever is born of God doth not
[1:40:41] commit
[1:40:42] sin for his seed remaineth in him and he
[1:40:46] cannot sin because he's born of
[1:40:49] God I'm how many how many love that by
[1:40:51] God's
[1:40:52] grace you have to be able to separate
[1:40:54] your three parts and say the seed of God
[1:40:57] doesn't sin I hate to sin I I hate sin
[1:41:00] but then you have to go to chapter one
[1:41:02] let's go to chapter
[1:41:04] one verse eight if we say we have no sin
[1:41:07] we deceive ourselves and the truth is
[1:41:09] not in US amen so what is it my flesh
[1:41:13] has sins my mind has sins but I the seed
[1:41:16] of God have no sin amen hallelujah
[1:41:20] that's the mystery of it that's the
[1:41:22] revelation of it I don't sin the seed
[1:41:25] inside of me does not sin because it's
[1:41:27] born of God and unbelief has passed away
[1:41:30] and faith and life has entered the house
[1:41:35] amen but my flesh and my mind does have
[1:41:38] sin because Paul said my sin that
[1:41:41] dwelleth in my
[1:41:42] members don't let it stumble you other
[1:41:45] one place will say God forgive me I'm a
[1:41:47] sinner saved by grace and another place
[1:41:48] he said a Christian can't even sin he
[1:41:50] says well how do you de with those
[1:41:51] quotes well you gotta look at the three
[1:41:53] parts of man and then you'll understand
[1:41:55] by God's grace Hallelujah that se inside
[1:41:58] of you cannot if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:42:00] seat inside of you that can't produce
[1:42:02] Thorns it will produce wheat praise God
[1:42:05] there's nothing in it to produce Thorns
[1:42:07] Oh Glory there's nothing in our souls
[1:42:09] that wants to sin against God how many
[1:42:11] you feel that way amen nothing in your
[1:42:14] soul the very nature Soul means nature
[1:42:17] the very being the very nature of your
[1:42:19] being doesn't want to sin against
[1:42:23] God all right
[1:42:29] now now back to
[1:42:32] this so disciples had to wait 10 days
[1:42:36] but the requirement today is not 10 days
[1:42:37] of waiting it is meeting God's
[1:42:39] requirement of being fully
[1:42:41] Sanctified so it's not a number anymore
[1:42:44] it was a number in those days because
[1:42:45] they had to wait till the Feast of Weeks
[1:42:46] the day of Pentecost 50 because that was
[1:42:49] the day where they took out the two
[1:42:50] loaves and now you have the Jewish
[1:42:51] church and the Gentile church that were
[1:42:52] two loaves of bread remember Gideon
[1:42:54] Gideon's Army was a loaf of bread the
[1:42:55] Bible said stumbled barley bread
[1:42:57] stumbled down the hill and knocked out
[1:42:58] the the T of the moabites I think it was
[1:43:02] I
[1:43:03] amorites so but the requirement of our
[1:43:07] full obedience before our birth this is
[1:43:10] why people can't get born again they
[1:43:11] don't fully obey the word of
[1:43:14] God they don't fully obey the word of
[1:43:17] God this is probably where I end up
[1:43:19] closing a little bit
[1:43:21] and we Are Witnesses of these things and
[1:43:23] so also is the Holy Ghost whom God have
[1:43:25] given to them that obey
[1:43:28] him when they heard that they were cut
[1:43:30] to the heart and took counsel to slay
[1:43:33] them who does God give the Holy Ghost to
[1:43:35] church those who obey
[1:43:38] him if you can't obey the word you can't
[1:43:40] expect to feel the Holy Ghost come upon
[1:43:42] you feel your
[1:43:43] soul you have to obey what the word says
[1:43:46] in
[1:43:47] [Music]
[1:43:49] everything said when you surrender fully
[1:43:52] you'll come in fully that's why some
[1:43:54] people have a partial experience with
[1:43:56] God sometimes they're partially feeling
[1:43:58] good with God other times they don't
[1:43:59] feel good with God they're not filled
[1:44:02] with God I don't want a half I don't
[1:44:04] want a half full cup I want a full cup
[1:44:06] praise
[1:44:07] God I'm an optimist but my a half cup is
[1:44:10] not a full cup I'll say it like that a
[1:44:12] full cup is a full cup a few a full Holy
[1:44:15] Ghost filled Christian is a full Holy
[1:44:17] Ghost filled Christian he or she is in
[1:44:19] the word all the away and they're
[1:44:21] interested in all the things of
[1:44:24] God but until you surrender he can't
[1:44:26] come in fully surrender surrender your
[1:44:28] thoughts surrender your thinking
[1:44:29] Surrender Your Life surrender all
[1:44:31] surrender your prestige so what people
[1:44:33] think about you I don't care what
[1:44:34] anybody thinks of me praise God Amen all
[1:44:38] I care is what God thinks about me and
[1:44:41] if I care about what God thinks me then
[1:44:43] like brother said then I have fear for
[1:44:44] my wife in other words I I I have a I
[1:44:46] want to live the right kind of life in
[1:44:47] front of my wife he said I I fear the
[1:44:50] kind conation I fear brother Neville
[1:44:52] then I want to serve other people if I
[1:44:54] love God so much then I want to love his
[1:44:56] people that's the only way you can know
[1:44:59] that you love God as if you love other
[1:45:00] people so we should be interested in the
[1:45:02] body of Christ right here if we see
[1:45:04] brother I to say like this I us don't do
[1:45:05] this but from the ppit but amen might
[1:45:07] have a car need you pray about it maybe
[1:45:09] God would use you to help him out amen
[1:45:12] isn't that what the body's for if my leg
[1:45:14] scratches what what do I need I need to
[1:45:15] send a message up to the hand come on
[1:45:18] hand go scratch my knee come on oh yeah
[1:45:22] thank you one part of the body helping
[1:45:24] another part of the
[1:45:27] body or just put an unspoken need in
[1:45:29] here if you don't like people to know
[1:45:31] but that's what a body's supposed to do
[1:45:33] a body's supposed to help out the rest
[1:45:35] of the body what better body to help out
[1:45:37] than Jesus is amen
[1:45:39] hallelujah the body of the Bride
[1:45:42] surrender everything to him now and
[1:45:44] he'll come in and fill you with the Holy
[1:45:46] Ghost like I said earlier until every
[1:45:48] door of every area of life is open to
[1:45:51] Jesus Christ a person won't be born
[1:45:53] again yet they still have more
[1:45:54] sanctification to go that's why I said
[1:45:57] every area of my life it was my words it
[1:46:00] was my relationship with my wife and we
[1:46:03] both said when the message came we're
[1:46:04] willing to leave each other if God wants
[1:46:05] to married or have mared different
[1:46:07] people but God kept us together I'm very
[1:46:09] happy happy for that by God's grace but
[1:46:12] we got to be willing to separate from
[1:46:13] anything anything that any appearance of
[1:46:17] evil the Bible said avoid all appearance
[1:46:18] let's read it first Thessalonians 5
[1:46:20] because I know we got Austin and
[1:46:21] Benjamin here they need to see these
[1:46:22] things by God's grace I tell you it was
[1:46:25] great yesterday I had a chance to sit
[1:46:26] down with Austin his mom here Austin
[1:46:28] starts kind of like just ring off the
[1:46:29] word and all these things he's learned
[1:46:31] at church is sharing with his Bible like
[1:46:32] proud of that
[1:46:33] guy
[1:46:35] glory amen I see Benjamin you know
[1:46:39] correcting his son talking about the
[1:46:40] word oh no we need to go to church I
[1:46:42] said proud of him amen
[1:46:45] GL what we hear we should put it into
[1:46:49] action don't be a forgetful here come to
[1:46:51] church I don't even know what was said I
[1:46:53] don't even know if my life's ever going
[1:46:54] to change that's a that's foolish yes if
[1:46:59] the word says I'm something if I see my
[1:47:00] reflection here then I'm going to
[1:47:02] remember what I look like I'm going
[1:47:04] remember what I'm supposed to look like
[1:47:05] by God's
[1:47:07] grace 1 Thessalonians
[1:47:11] 5 verse 21 look at this well let's go to
[1:47:13] verse 18 and everything give thanks for
[1:47:15] this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
[1:47:16] concerning you even in hard times church
[1:47:18] can we give thanks yes yeah I think I
[1:47:21] need help with that I think we all need
[1:47:22] help with that quench not the spirit so
[1:47:25] don't do something where it would put
[1:47:26] out the Holy Spirit keep your heart and
[1:47:28] mind on God don't think about other
[1:47:30] things have one heart and one Accord by
[1:47:32] God's
[1:47:33] grace despise not prophesyings we love
[1:47:36] prophecy amen we don't actually have it
[1:47:39] operating in here too
[1:47:41] often but prophecy can work without a
[1:47:43] thus say the Lord Jesus never had to say
[1:47:45] thus sayi the Lord un prophesying he
[1:47:47] just told it would happen same thing can
[1:47:49] happen in our lives
[1:47:51] uh verse 21 prove all things hold fast
[1:47:53] to that which is good prove that it's
[1:47:55] the will like we said prove it's the
[1:47:57] will of God for your life prove to me
[1:47:59] that it's God's will for you not to do
[1:48:01] this or for you to do this you should be
[1:48:02] able to prove it's God's will for your
[1:48:04] life I don't know if I'm like sun night
[1:48:06] we're talking about tonight we don't
[1:48:07] know what maybe you don't know the next
[1:48:09] Direction next thing to do you know
[1:48:10] we're talking about work and things like
[1:48:11] that church if we don't know what do we
[1:48:13] need to do we need to ask God and we
[1:48:14] need to be able to prove this is God's
[1:48:16] will for my life because he and I we
[1:48:19] none of us none of us want to make a
[1:48:21] mistake while we're walking this Pilgrim
[1:48:23] Way do we does anybody want to walk off
[1:48:25] the path that God gave for us no sir I
[1:48:27] to follow those bloody Footprints all
[1:48:29] the way to heaven
[1:48:30] amen so prove it I know this is the
[1:48:33] right decision because this this this he
[1:48:35] gives two three
[1:48:36] Witnesses or maybe it's just God put
[1:48:38] such a burden in my heart I know this is
[1:48:40] the will of God it's the right thing for
[1:48:42] me to
[1:48:43] do now here where I go verse 22 brother
[1:48:46] Austin and V abstain from all appearance
[1:48:48] of evil something looks evil get get rid
[1:48:50] of it praise God it even looks this is
[1:48:54] the surrender you must have if you want
[1:48:55] the Holy Ghost if it looks evil get rid
[1:48:57] of
[1:48:58] it we some of us we've lived in sin so
[1:49:01] long we just get used to it we never
[1:49:02] even live without of it just try living
[1:49:05] without it and see how God will bless
[1:49:06] your life
[1:49:07] amen I never knew what a Christian Life
[1:49:09] I could live until I got rid of the TV
[1:49:11] bye then brother amen I started Living
[1:49:12] like I was supposed to live amen I I
[1:49:15] don't waste a whole Sunday I don't waste
[1:49:16] a whole Saturday watching football I can
[1:49:17] do all this for the Lord I can you know
[1:49:19] help out whatever do what whatever God
[1:49:21] wants me to do your life will turn
[1:49:22] upside down if you surrender everything
[1:49:24] because you'll be finally doing what God
[1:49:25] told you to
[1:49:29] do and your choice of what you do in
[1:49:32] your time shows if you're you're wise or
[1:49:34] foolish praise God let's go to Ephesians
[1:49:37] 4 that proves that whatever you choose
[1:49:39] to do with your time that's why I was
[1:49:40] preaching so hard on coming to
[1:49:43] church if you can if someone's not sick
[1:49:46] every time the doors are open what you
[1:49:47] do with your time shows if you're wise
[1:49:49] or foolish
[1:49:50] and the church said it is absolutely
[1:49:53] Bible
[1:49:55] truth what you do with your time isn't
[1:49:58] it strange how we can you know some of
[1:50:00] us we can come here and enjoy the word
[1:50:02] of God all every time the doors are open
[1:50:05] and those live streaming praise God if
[1:50:06] you're enjoying it that's wonderful but
[1:50:08] let's say someone doesn't live stream or
[1:50:09] someone doesn't attend how can we be
[1:50:11] loving God praising God receiving His
[1:50:13] blessings here drawing closer to God and
[1:50:16] then other people okay that they're not
[1:50:18] drawing closer to God how can that be
[1:50:20] possible when we invest our time here
[1:50:22] and they don't invest their time here
[1:50:23] it's because they're a different quality
[1:50:25] of a
[1:50:26] Christian a wise virgin redeems the time
[1:50:30] and the church
[1:50:31] said amen there ain't a choice in it the
[1:50:36] wise I'm sorry it's Ephesians 5 sorry
[1:50:38] the wise Christian redeems the
[1:50:41] time look at verse 15 Ephesians 5:15 see
[1:50:44] then that you walk circumspectly not as
[1:50:46] fools but as wise Redeeming the time
[1:50:48] because the days are evil and be not
[1:50:50] unwise but understanding what the will
[1:50:52] of the Lord
[1:50:53] is praise
[1:50:55] God a holy ghost to a Christian knows
[1:50:58] the perfect will of God for their life
[1:51:00] they know where they come from they know
[1:51:01] where they are and they know where
[1:51:03] they're going praise God they know what
[1:51:06] gifts they got in their life they know
[1:51:08] what God's called them to do they're
[1:51:09] open to receiving more Hallelujah they
[1:51:12] met with God they know God's will their
[1:51:14] mind is transformed because a
[1:51:16] transformed mind is the way to know the
[1:51:17] will of God you know hold ghost anointed
[1:51:20] mind and then you can prove to people
[1:51:22] this is God's will for my life how do
[1:51:24] you know because I can do it with God's
[1:51:26] help I can do it
[1:51:28] amen
[1:51:31] hallelujah Glory I got four five minutes
[1:51:34] bear with me I'm looking at my thing
[1:51:36] here right here five
[1:51:39] [Music]
[1:51:40] minutes I didn't even get to the
[1:51:42] Staggering part I was going to show you
[1:51:43] all the quotes of brother BR said they
[1:51:44] stagger on the day of Pentecost we'll
[1:51:46] get to that by God's grace if the Lord
[1:51:47] willing this is what the Holy Ghost
[1:51:49] produces when someone's born again it
[1:51:51] produces a type of
[1:51:54] reaction let's just since we're here
[1:51:56] let's close
[1:51:57] this understanding about tearing for the
[1:51:59] holy ghost look at this brother Ram said
[1:52:01] God is more anxious to give you the Holy
[1:52:02] Ghost than you are to receive
[1:52:04] it I can't wait till brother so and so
[1:52:07] is ready for me to fill him I can't wait
[1:52:09] for sister so- and so to finally
[1:52:10] surrender that I can come and dwell in
[1:52:12] their heart I can I can live in another
[1:52:14] Temple another
[1:52:15] Tabernacle Hallelujah I can fill another
[1:52:18] Tabernacle oh the Holy Spirit that's the
[1:52:21] house he desires to dwell in not a house
[1:52:23] made by hands but a house made by God
[1:52:26] amen
[1:52:28] glory you don't have to t t t there's no
[1:52:31] such thing while Peter yet spake the
[1:52:32] words the Holy Ghost fell them and heard
[1:52:34] it the trouble is we don't want it
[1:52:35] enough and that's the
[1:52:37] trouble we're not we don't want to
[1:52:39] Humble oursel so to be born again you
[1:52:41] have to humble yourself die to every
[1:52:43] single thing even die to what you want
[1:52:46] to think you're going to act like die to
[1:52:48] that I've got to speak in tongues or
[1:52:51] I've got to cry I've got to shout I've
[1:52:52] got to scream like a siren I've got to
[1:52:54] snot and boohoo on the altar until it's
[1:52:56] wet no just lose all your
[1:53:00] thoughts and just wait for
[1:53:02] God humble yourself now brother Brandon
[1:53:05] mentions is there's no tearing and he
[1:53:07] goes to acts 10 but get your Bibles
[1:53:08] ready I'm going to close with this go
[1:53:10] wor I think this is good while Peter yet
[1:53:13] spake the words the Holy Ghost fell in
[1:53:14] them all that which heard to work while
[1:53:15] he was preaching the Holy Ghost fell in
[1:53:17] way where he had to stop preaching I've
[1:53:19] had that happen to me twice on this
[1:53:20] Earth maybe three times three I preached
[1:53:24] by the Holy Spirit I know God's dealing
[1:53:26] with people and all of a sudden they
[1:53:27] start worshiping so much I got to stop
[1:53:29] and I just say I'm stopping because
[1:53:31] God's glory is here oh I love those
[1:53:34] times I love every time but I like those
[1:53:36] times too praise God when you can't
[1:53:39] Minister because there's so much glory
[1:53:40] of
[1:53:41] God
[1:53:44] hallelujah I like to see that come to
[1:53:46] after by God's
[1:53:48] grace
[1:53:50] we've had great times in the spirit you
[1:53:52] understand what I'm saying um I like to
[1:53:54] see it come again I'm going say like
[1:53:55] that like to see it come again like
[1:53:58] God but actually I don't think it's
[1:54:00] happened here though I just think it
[1:54:01] happened so that's what I'm saying maybe
[1:54:03] it's happened other brothers that
[1:54:04] preached here but I know for sure like
[1:54:07] when brother Tim M Kimmy was here I
[1:54:08] think it's a different times brother's
[1:54:09] been here where there just such a
[1:54:10] powerful atmosphere you know God was
[1:54:12] blessing people answering people's
[1:54:13] prayers and so forth so Peter's
[1:54:15] preaching and all of a sudden the Holy
[1:54:16] Ghost Falls okay I'm done preaching
[1:54:18] let's Worship the Lord
[1:54:20] Hallelujah let's close with
[1:54:23] this now see you don't have to Terry t t
[1:54:26] cornelius's house was not tearing for
[1:54:28] the Holy Ghost but they were being
[1:54:32] Sanctified which made them ready for the
[1:54:35] holy ghost look at the life of cornelus
[1:54:37] church just think about this life and
[1:54:39] honestly look at your heart look at your
[1:54:40] life right now cornelus and his house
[1:54:43] believed in Christ and God and God
[1:54:45] remembered their faithful giving of
[1:54:48] arms are we giving givings like Jesus
[1:54:51] said I'm not talking about offerings to
[1:54:53] the church I'm talking about alms and
[1:54:55] you can't take your ties and gives alms
[1:54:56] because ties are God's money I preach on
[1:54:59] that remember that
[1:55:01] probably here's a man who's already
[1:55:04] giving alms in other words brother uh
[1:55:06] brother Austin he's out there he just
[1:55:08] sees people that need help and he just
[1:55:09] helps him out he don't he doesn't he
[1:55:11] doesn't broadcast and say hey everybody
[1:55:12] look at
[1:55:13] me right Ms Ms are secret giving you
[1:55:17] help out people in secret here's a he's
[1:55:19] going to get the Holy Ghost any day
[1:55:21] right any any moment here in the
[1:55:22] scripture but his life has been given to
[1:55:24] alms he's been helping out poor
[1:55:27] people that makes him ready for the Holy
[1:55:29] Ghost because he's not living for
[1:55:30] cornelus anymore he's living for
[1:55:34] Christ praise
[1:55:37] God and he was fasting and God gave him
[1:55:40] the vision to go call Peter through his
[1:55:42] prayer and fasting here's a man he don't
[1:55:44] even have the Holy Ghost yet he's
[1:55:45] praying and fasting giving arms now
[1:55:47] think about your life are you praying
[1:55:48] fasting giving arms brother Ram said
[1:55:50] it's got to come exactly the same way
[1:55:52] the Bible came how they receive the Holy
[1:55:54] Ghost Falls the same exact way he gives
[1:55:57] the Holy Ghost to them that obey
[1:56:02] him are you fasting are those that want
[1:56:05] the Holy Ghost are we
[1:56:08] fasting and praying God said I
[1:56:10] remembered your prayers
[1:56:12] Cornelius Cornus was a just man and
[1:56:15] feared
[1:56:17] God he feared God because he was praying
[1:56:19] to God Amen he feared God because he was
[1:56:22] helping out the poor this is the kind of
[1:56:24] a Christian he was he was a Sanctified
[1:56:27] Christian so when the message of the AR
[1:56:29] came it was easy for him to receive the
[1:56:31] Holy Ghost because he's already got a
[1:56:32] life that's surrendered to Christ
[1:56:35] amen he's not living for carus anymore
[1:56:38] he's living for the body of
[1:56:42] Christ they were a humble Sanctified
[1:56:45] Gentile group of Believers ready for the
[1:56:48] baptism Holy Ghost to stand our feet
[1:56:50] and just an hour 15 exactly on my clock
[1:56:52] praise
[1:56:55] God and about an hour now an hour later
[1:56:59] in brother R same sermon he said you
[1:57:00] don't have to T there you don't have to
[1:57:02] t t t look what he says an hour later
[1:57:04] he's saying stay right with it stay
[1:57:06] there oh Lord I'm gonna stay right here

[1:57:09] other words he said you might have to T
[1:57:11] all
[1:57:14] night so there's a balance in the same
[1:57:17] sermon he said you don't have to Terry
[1:57:18] Terry T he says you might you said you
[1:57:20] should be willing to stay here all night
[1:57:21] till you get the Holy
[1:57:25] Ghost he said I don't care if it's in
[1:57:27] the morning I'll be standing here God
[1:57:29] praising you I know you're going to send
[1:57:30] it this convention is ending tonight and
[1:57:32] I'm here without the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:57:34] going away from here filled with the
[1:57:36] Holy Ghost so help me you promised it
[1:57:38] where did he promise it in Acts 238 and
[1:57:41] 239
[1:57:43] Glory he who repents and is baptized in
[1:57:45] the name of Jesus Christ shall let's say
[1:57:47] shall ready shall receive the gift of
[1:57:50] the Holy Ghost this promis is unto you
[1:57:53] and your children you promis it
[1:57:56] Lord and if people have to wait all
[1:57:58] night what does it mean they have to die
[1:58:00] out
[1:58:01] more they have to die out
[1:58:04] more you promise it I'll stand here like
[1:58:06] a Weather
[1:58:08] Vein I'll do anything you want me to do
[1:58:10] only I want the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:58:13] determined to get it so God is actually
[1:58:15] the one waiting until you're fully
[1:58:17] surrendered God's actually the one
[1:58:18] tearing Church can I say like that he's
[1:58:21] the one tearing well is brother so and
[1:58:23] so going to get ready is he going to
[1:58:24] surrender this or not I surely like to
[1:58:26] fill him oh I sure like to fill sister
[1:58:28] son so I'm just tearing I'm just waiting
[1:58:30] to fill them whenever they when they
[1:58:32] when they fully surrender to me and obey
[1:58:34] me I just want to fill them so
[1:58:39] much let me end with these
[1:58:42] quotes please thank you Lord I want to
[1:58:45] get to the tongues and help you to see
[1:58:46] what kind of tongues it ain't unknown
[1:58:48] tongues or I'm sorry it isn't unknown
[1:58:53] tongues let's close to this you must die
[1:58:56] to have a birth this is what I was
[1:58:57] saying earlier I was going to reference
[1:58:58] the reason people
[1:59:00] blabber
[1:59:02] Hallelujah the reason people shout
[1:59:06] praise snot whatever jibber jabber
[1:59:10] whatever stammer I said with stammering
[1:59:12] lips in another tongue the reason they
[1:59:14] do that is because they're
[1:59:17] dying amen
[1:59:19] that's why they cry that's why they
[1:59:21] scream that's why they shout someone
[1:59:23] just died and it was them hallelujah
[1:59:27] amen Jesus said except the corn of wheat
[1:59:30] fall on the ground and die it abides
[1:59:32] alone but if it die it bringeth forth
[1:59:34] fruits of the spirit
[1:59:36] amen is that right that's the reason
[1:59:39] they cried that's the reason they snot
[1:59:40] it out brother R said is because they're
[1:59:42] dying to myself somebody's died
[1:59:46] Hallelujah but until they die he can't
[1:59:48] come in because they still have they
[1:59:50] still they're keeping they're pushing
[1:59:51] God out they want even if it's just once
[1:59:54] sin they're pushing God out no I don't
[1:59:56] want to and God's like I'm waiting I'm
[1:59:58] tearing I'm tearing brother said he's
[2:00:00] hunting people to fill
[2:00:03] hallelujah look what he says brother
[2:00:05] says these exact words and I see you're
[2:00:07] afraid to turn yourself loose you're
[2:00:09] scared of something there's something
[2:00:10] wrong God don't make a promise and go
[2:00:12] back on it it's the truth it's up to you
[2:00:15] it's your what
[2:00:17] death that's why people cry go
[2:00:20] Hallelujah that's why I cried and I saw
[2:00:22] visions of Christ when I got born again
[2:00:24] amen because I was dying I recognized
[2:00:26] when he died and recognize that he died
[2:00:29] instead of me Hallelujah he died in my
[2:00:32] place he died for me he died in my stad
[2:00:34] yes he did but I died to wanting to do
[2:00:37] what Jesse Smith wanted to do and I
[2:00:39] lived to the will of
[2:00:43] God they're scared to die they're scared
[2:00:45] to fully surrender and and let go of all
[2:00:48] their sinful Pleasures it's your death
[2:00:51] it's your what
[2:00:55] burial it's your exception there's the
[2:00:59] word a few moments later friends you got
[2:01:02] to get away from that starchy
[2:01:04] Pentecostal way I'll just you know I'll
[2:01:06] just shout a little bit and jump around
[2:01:07] a little bit that's not dying anybody
[2:01:09] can do that anybody can feel good at
[2:01:11] anointed all the time people work I'll
[2:01:13] share testimonies oh I feel shivers down
[2:01:15] my back that's fine I'm not making fun
[2:01:16] of that but that's as far as they they
[2:01:18] think that's as far as you can go with
[2:01:20] God there's something beyond that it's
[2:01:22] called Death to self amen it's a Death
[2:01:25] to Your will it's a burial of your will
[2:01:28] and now the will of Christ can come into
[2:01:30] your soul
[2:01:32] Hallelujah as far as I go I feel Shiver
[2:01:34] I that's good I'm glad the testimony
[2:01:36] brings the Holy Spirit but who's ready
[2:01:37] to die who's ready to have their their
[2:01:40] will buried so that fruit of the Holy
[2:01:42] Spirit can come out of their
[2:01:44] life we're talking about a whole
[2:01:46] different experience this isn't just
[2:01:48] jumping and Shou and bubble dancing this
[2:01:50] is death and
[2:01:53] life you really got to mean it like we
[2:01:56] were talking recently you really got to
[2:01:58] mean I want God In My Soul you really
[2:02:01] gotta mean I'm done with this I'm done
[2:02:03] with that I'm done you really gotta mean
[2:02:05] it and until you mean it he can't come
[2:02:07] because you're still holding Idols in
[2:02:08] your heart and he can't take the place
[2:02:10] as number one in your
[2:02:11] heart you're keeping them out of doors
[2:02:14] in your life doors in your
[2:02:16] heart you got a partial hunger he said
[2:02:19] but not a real
[2:02:20] hunger no wonder there's noise of
[2:02:23] Believers
[2:02:24] dying they show all these videos
[2:02:26] recently of people being you know shot
[2:02:28] and different things and dying what are
[2:02:29] the girls do they're screaming all these
[2:02:31] things like that what is that showing us
[2:02:33] when death is happening it brings a
[2:02:35] reaction does it not
[2:02:38] amen life is leaving here and when a
[2:02:42] Christian dies and really dies out their
[2:02:45] Will dies out it dies and now Christ can
[2:02:49] finally have preeminence in their
[2:02:51] life that's about our heads
[2:02:54] here but L if you'll come
[2:02:57] here you can switch over thank you
[2:03:04] sir just play that I surrender
[2:03:09] all I want to make this a
[2:03:13] series I hope you understand by God's
[2:03:15] grace if you want prayer this morning
[2:03:17] I'm happy to pray with you
[2:03:19] but I found when brother Bron prayed for
[2:03:20] the Holy Ghost he often didn't lay hands
[2:03:22] on people he let them die out to
[2:03:25] themselves until God
[2:03:26] came at church the reason i' I've always
[2:03:29] laid hands on is because in Trinidad and
[2:03:31] Al being in different place where I
[2:03:33] preach and the Holy Ghost fell people
[2:03:35] wanted me to lay hands on them and they
[2:03:36] seem to get good results but here at the
[2:03:38] home church I don't know if it really
[2:03:39] has or not I'm not quite
[2:03:42] sure I'm not quite
[2:03:44] sure I see brother
[2:03:47] brandom letting people wrestled
[2:03:56] out this is the most important time of
[2:03:59] the service if anytime there's an
[2:04:00] important time it's right
[2:04:02] now but said the end of the preaching is
[2:04:05] the climax of the service how many
[2:04:07] believe that you believe it was a
[2:04:09] prophet because now it's on you the word
[2:04:12] has gone forth it's on me what are we do
[2:04:14] what are we going to do with the word
[2:04:16] are we going to mix that word with faith
[2:04:17] or not
[2:04:20] [Music]
[2:04:22] what I'm hoping is this as this series
[2:04:23] goes on this will Cate such a hunger in
[2:04:25] people's lives to die to S and really
[2:04:28] see am I really born again am I really
[2:04:30] interested in all the things of God am I
[2:04:33] re what am I doing with my
[2:04:38] time is my time Redeemed by
[2:04:41] God have I let God redeem all my
[2:04:46] time am I acting like it's the evening
[2:04:49] time and uh we only have a few more
[2:04:52] hours to labor and find a Ministry and
[2:04:53] do something for Jesus what is our
[2:04:55] attitude towards our free time or church
[2:05:02] time I want people to be able to
[2:05:04] say brother Jesse the word has show me I
[2:05:07] really am born again or the word has
[2:05:09] showed me I'm not and I want to die out
[2:05:12] that's what I want this to
[2:05:14] produce because at least if you know
[2:05:16] you're not you God can take you further
[2:05:19] but I don't want people leaving here
[2:05:21] thinking well I'm I guess I'll just
[2:05:23] always think I got it I don't care
[2:05:24] really what the preaching says shame on
[2:05:26] you if you act like that I don't care
[2:05:28] I'm not even listening to the sermon it
[2:05:30] don't mean nothing to me this is the
[2:05:31] most sacred thing we can do is examine
[2:05:33] our souls a Souls worth 10,000 worlds is
[2:05:36] it not 52 million people die every day
[2:05:39] how do you know this ain't your day how
[2:05:41] do you know tomorrow this week won't be
[2:05:43] your week to die 52 million people die
[2:05:45] every every single
[2:05:47] day
[2:05:52] no man knows the day or hour of Christ
[2:05:55] coming no man knows the day or the hour
[2:05:56] of their death God reveals it to
[2:06:02] them dying that's why people blabber
[2:06:05] brother sister that's why people cry
[2:06:08] that's why preachers persuade and beg
[2:06:11] people to get right with God that's why
[2:06:13] we pray and fast so someone will die to
[2:06:17] their selfishness
[2:06:20] die to a path that's lust that's
[2:06:22] ultimately going to lead them to death
[2:06:25] and Hell or maybe the tribulation for
[2:06:27] foolish
[2:06:32] virgin brother said the real Holy Ghost
[2:06:34] Church calls out sin discerns
[2:06:39] it that's the real Holy Ghost
[2:06:42] Church with your heads
[2:06:45] bowed let's go back to Kos let's close
[2:06:48] with that he was a just man that feared
[2:06:51] God how many would raise your hand and
[2:06:53] say brother
[2:06:54] Jesse I need to be more like Kos I need
[2:06:57] to fast pray give
[2:06:59] arms God bless those
[2:07:00] [Music]
[2:07:04] hands can put them down
[2:07:07] there I'm going to pray that your heart
[2:07:10] and my heart would be so focused on the
[2:07:13] baptism of Holy Ghost for the next few
[2:07:15] weeks Lord willing I have a guest
[2:07:16] preacher till the middle of October by
[2:07:18] God's help I want to keep on these
[2:07:20] thoughts unless God would take me out
[2:07:21] something else that would help the
[2:07:25] church we all know there's going to come
[2:07:27] a rapture we all know we've all heard it
[2:07:29] for years but now we know how we need to
[2:07:32] act when it
[2:07:35] comes we need to be fully surrendered
[2:07:38] totally died out all every part of our
[2:07:40] life has to be surrendered to
[2:07:47] Christ
[2:07:50] so old person middle-aged person young
[2:07:53] person in your heart right now listen as
[2:07:56] I pray Heavenly
[2:07:59] Father am I dead to
[2:08:03] self have I really died
[2:08:05] out Lord I've seen so many people say
[2:08:08] they're ready to be baptized and get
[2:08:09] baptized and you never we don't see
[2:08:11] fruit come from that it means Lord
[2:08:14] there's more death that needs to happen
[2:08:16] in people's lives and this is the time
[2:08:18] where it could happen Lord after the
[2:08:21] word has been
[2:08:24] preached Lord I just pray let there be a
[2:08:26] holy atmosphere in this church the next
[2:08:28] few weeks if it be your
[2:08:31] will let there be those like Cornus that
[2:08:34] fear God and they use their time to
[2:08:38] redeem it for the kingdom of
[2:08:40] God as you told Mary and Martha you said
[2:08:44] Mary has chosen the more needful thing
[2:08:47] to sit at the feet of Jesus Jesus and
[2:08:48] hear the word of
[2:08:50] God Mary chose to use her time work work
[2:08:53] work work work I'm sorry Martha did but
[2:08:56] Mary said I'm gonna take a break and I'm
[2:08:59] going to sit at Jesus feet and he said
[2:09:01] that'll never be taken from me
[2:09:04] Hallelujah Lord there's things in our
[2:09:06] lives when the word is preached that
[2:09:08] Satan cannot touch thank you that's
[2:09:11] called a revelation amen Lord let there
[2:09:14] be Revelation in our hearts that we must
[2:09:16] die out that's why people blabber that's
[2:09:20] why people
[2:09:22] scream that's why people don't scream
[2:09:24] and don't worship because they don't die
[2:09:27] out and I'm not talking every service
[2:09:29] I'm talking about being filled with the
[2:09:31] Holy
[2:09:33] Ghost and they wander from this to that
[2:09:36] without any pure Direction any perfect
[2:09:38] will of God lord Jesus I pray Lord God
[2:09:41] let people die out in this
[2:09:46] church I was crying yesterday praying
[2:09:48] for the same thing Lord send the Holy
[2:09:51] Ghost amongst us Lord I don't care when
