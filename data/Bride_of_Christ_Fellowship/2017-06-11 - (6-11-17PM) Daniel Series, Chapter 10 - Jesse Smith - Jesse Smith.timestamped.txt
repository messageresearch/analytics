[33:43] word here let's go to the end of chapter
[33:45] 10 Daniel chapter 10 or the street not
[33:55] leave the first two verses up stick
[34:01] Daniel 10 and 12 a rather short chapter
[34:04] Elevens the long one this would be
[34:07] obvious or message easily to Daniel
[34:11] chapter 10 I hope you're enjoying it I
[34:16] surely have I feel like all the
[34:18] nervousness towards Daniel and these
[34:20] things have all been dissolved and God's
[34:23] grace I mean you're very secure and what
[34:26] our prophet taught us we didn't want to
[34:29] teach this to others as well very
[34:31] thankful for that
[34:32] end of chapter 10 verse 1 Daniel 10
[34:40] verse 1 and the 3rd year of Cyrus king
[34:47] of Persia a thing was revealed unto
[34:49] Daniel whose name was called bel -
[34:51] Shay's our and the thing was true but
[34:54] the time appointed was long and he
[34:57] understood the thing and had
[34:59] understanding of division we'll just

[36:04] seen a race car now that is rich over

[36:10] quotes here and some scriptures tonight
[36:12] by God's grace like I said I know how
[36:15] long we'll be but I don't know about you
[36:17] with it whenever getting the spirit time
[36:18] just flies anyway so don't even worry
[36:21] about the clock play map in order to try
[36:23] to take care of my throat voice rather I
[36:25] try to keep a little shorter on Sunday
[36:27] night let's look at this here Daniels
[36:29] answered prayers here it's Daniel the
[36:32] Daniel series been working on Hart Ted
[36:33] and I trusted blessed by this brought
[36:37] great understanding to me you know next
[36:40] chapter is going to be a little bit of
[36:42] study and looks like it's on the second
[36:45] and third kingdoms of Daniels vision so
[36:48] Persian Empire and Grecian Empire and
[36:51] then we have a lot of the types of ante
[36:53] kiyose I'm sorry anta Caius and then a
[36:56] lot of times as him as the Antichrist so
[36:59] we're looking at that Lord willing next
[37:00] week by the grace of the Lord is going
[37:03] to see our sister Dale may God bless you
[37:04] sister good to see you praise the Lord
[37:08] so that's a look to the Lord here and we
[37:10] preach it his word I think it's just an
[37:14] encouraging message on prayer and
[37:16] intercession seeking seeking God's face
[37:20] is a great chapter on how to seek God's
[37:22] face and to have confidence as you wait
[37:26] upon the Lord and pray God will surely
[37:29] answer you now chapter 10 the background
[37:32] the commentary says this chapter takes
[37:35] place one year after chapter 9 when
[37:38] Gabriel visited Daniel and gave him
[37:41] Daniel seventy weeks so one year later
[37:44] God visits in
[37:45] Daniel's got 84 years old at this time
[37:48] how many would be like Danny when you're
[37:50] 84 years old you're still just fasting
[37:52] and praying as a 9 Laurie go under the
[37:55] Bible said haven't caught him greatly
[37:57] beloved they met because heaven loved
[38:00] him because he loved having a man he was
[38:03] interested in spiritual things a man and
[38:05] the longer time goes on the longer we're
[38:07] going to see the world has nothing to
[38:09] offer us we must see heavenly things a
[38:11] maginot be everything anything of the
[38:13] world will be in vain it will pass away
[38:15] but the things of God are eternally mad
[38:18] now verse 1 we read that for our text
[38:21] tonight now Cyrus followed Darius there
[38:25] is the me who has succeeded belt Shazahn
[38:27] so Cyrus here this takes place in the
[38:31] third year Cyrus alright and the Bible
[38:35] said that Daniel received a true
[38:36] revelation and he understood the vision
[38:40] so we're going to see this is a vision
[38:42] of the visit from the angel of the Lord
[38:44] what a what a great type of brother
[38:47] branham how the angel orbit visit
[38:49] brother Brandon what a great great way
[38:51] to learn how brother Branham must have
[38:54] felt by looking at the life of Daniel
[38:55] it's a great teaching here now verse 2
[38:59] in those days identity was mourning
[39:00] three full weeks I ate no Pleasant bread
[39:04] nor camp flesh nor wine in my mouth
[39:07] neither did I anoint myself at all so
[39:09] three weeks were fulfilled
[39:11] so Daniel mourned three weeks he had no
[39:13] Pleasant or delightful bread it was a
[39:15] partial fast so he ate some bread and
[39:18] water while he was mourning now here's
[39:22] why he was said history says the
[39:25] construction of the temple through
[39:26] zerubabbel had been stopped
[39:28] remember the Samaritan government had
[39:31] stopped them
[39:32] they had a great revival coming back and
[39:34] so forth but the government had lied or
[39:38] I'm sorry people had lied to the
[39:39] government they stopped the construction
[39:42] of the temple so Daniels morning and and
[39:44] he's praying and wondering why the
[39:46] temple had been stopped but as day after
[39:50] Daniel prays of course two prophets made
[39:53] the people's efforts prosper it was
[39:55] Hagee is a Cariah
[39:57] so see a
[39:59] the even though the people look defeated
[40:02] as long as somebody was intercessor
[40:04] intercessing in Prague God could raise
[40:06] up a new prophet under a new messenger
[40:09] here super bowl would had led them there
[40:11] but they needed some encouragement so
[40:14] God raised up two anointed prophets and
[40:16] the Bible said they prospered through
[40:19] the prophecy now how many would say your
[40:22] life has prospered because you heard the
[40:24] Prophet brother Brad a man I can say
[40:26] that did that by the - totally Pross a
[40:28] man spiritually most importantly
[40:30] spiritually right of course naturally as
[40:32] you pay your tithes if your offerings
[40:34] God prospers you but that's not so much
[40:37] the phosphor that we really need to
[40:38] really to prosper in God in spiritual
[40:41] blessings praise that what you're the
[40:43] fruits of the spirit the gifts of the
[40:45] Spirit
[40:45] the revelation of God's Word in that
[40:49] those things are we must prosper in it
[40:52] hallelujah so Daniel was mourning and
[40:55] fasting these three weeks and God
[40:57] eventually brought two prophets that was
[40:59] later of course Daniels now in Babylon
[41:02] of course but the Haggai and Zechariah
[41:05] rose up in Israel you're a little bit
[41:09] years later by God's grace now verse
[41:12] four in the four and twentieth day of
[41:15] the first month as I was by the side of
[41:16] the great river which is high dekho
[41:19] verse five that lifted up my eyes and
[41:23] looked and behold a certain man clothed
[41:25] in linen whose loins were girded with
[41:27] the fine gold of you fast now verse six
[41:31] his body was also like a bear on his
[41:33] face as the appearance of lightning his
[41:35] lamps her eyes as lamps of fire and his
[41:38] arms and his feet like a color to polish
[41:40] brass and the voice of his words like
[41:42] the voice of a multitude and I Daniel
[41:45] alone saw the vision for the men that
[41:47] were with me saw not the vision but a
[41:49] great quaking fell upon them so that
[41:51] they fled to hide themselves now this is
[41:54] an interesting scripture because it
[41:55] seems like this angel looks a lot like
[41:58] Christ in Revelation chapter 1 right
[42:00] eyes afire feet is brass right bright is
[42:04] lightening he looks a lot like Christ
[42:06] but it's not Christ and here's why we
[42:09] know that because this angel was not
[42:12] able to break
[42:13] rude to Daniel on his own power he
[42:15] needed help from Michael
[42:17] but Christ would obviously have all
[42:19] power over all the demons right I'm
[42:21] Frank so he has an appearance like
[42:24] Christ the glorified body of Christ but
[42:28] he's not Christ because this angel is
[42:31] actually a hindered you know for 21 days
[42:34] as we'll see in just a little bit so
[42:37] he's a certain man of I so he's an age
[42:39] of the Lord he has all these attributes
[42:41] his voice is a multitude and he came to
[42:44] Daniel a great vision brother Graham
[42:46] said it was the angel of the Lord
[42:48] Daniel only saw the vision this is
[42:51] really great here the men with him felt
[42:53] a quaking and they ran and fled but they
[42:56] did not see the vision this is the
[42:58] separate of st. Paul's experience on the
[43:00] road to Damascus when the men heard the
[43:03] voice but did not see the vision
[43:05] remember that from acts 9 / 7 so it's
[43:10] kind of it's very similar to that they
[43:12] did not see the vision but they heard
[43:13] something now Daniels case they felt
[43:16] something they felt the holy presence
[43:17] they got a quaking of the angel Lord
[43:20] there so they just ran away he Church
[43:23] Tommy against can see the difference
[43:25] between the two kinds of anointing from
[43:26] God you could have one where about said
[43:28] it's a joyful he called it bubble
[43:30] dancing anointing you could have the
[43:32] happiness of the Lord but the other one
[43:34] he said is a fearful anointing which he
[43:37] says you feel like he said those kind of
[43:39] experiences you never get used to right
[43:41] and he said those are experiences that
[43:44] anchor you in God's Word it's a fearful
[43:46] thing right to be in the presence of an
[43:49] angel of the Lord amen
[43:50] so that's the kite daniel has here he
[43:53] has an experience with the angel the
[43:55] Lord a fearful thing here to be in his
[43:58] presence and program said see look
[44:00] Daniel prayed at the angel or hurt him
[44:02] but couldn't get to him for how many
[44:04] days 21 days so the Prophet tells us
[44:08] this is the angel the Lord praise God a
[44:12] man now programs goes on he says when
[44:15] Daniel was down by the river one day he
[44:17] fell into a trance and saw a vision many
[44:19] of those with it they didn't see the
[44:21] vision
[44:21] was given all the Daniel you see it
[44:24] someone can stand right next to you and
[44:26] see things that you can't see to save
[44:29] your life that's right someone said I
[44:32] don't believe that I never seen nothing
[44:33] that's because it wasn't for you to see
[44:36] it that went with Paul when all was
[44:39] stuck for shrug off his horse and Anna
[44:42] thought of the dirt and the Wallower
[44:43] as it was of the dirt none of that hurt
[44:46] the boys have seen the mission Paul saw
[44:48] none of them saw the star that cost
[44:50] every every Observatory but the Wiseman
[44:54] sandai takes it to Jesus did only the
[44:56] wise men saw the star
[44:58] praise God but man says many things are
[45:01] that way because God has designed for
[45:03] certain people to see and others cannot
[45:06] see oh I love that when God has infinite
[45:10] wisdom has predestinated or for Dane for
[45:13] certain things that happen it can happen
[45:15] to the person sitting right next to you
[45:17] and you'll know nothing about it Dana
[45:20] aren't you glad that God showed himself
[45:21] to you may not know other people could
[45:24] have made the service and they they walk
[45:26] out of the service not feeling anything
[45:27] but you were out of walked out and we
[45:29] knew God was in the place amen and our
[45:32] lives were take impacted our lives
[45:34] because there was ordained for us to see
[45:37] what we saw and hear what we heard they
[45:40] met he said now you can imagine how that
[45:42] prophet that haze' felt that sermon I
[45:46] goes the days of Elijah he looked over
[45:48] at him and said why I don't see nobody
[45:50] and he said God opened the boy's eyes
[45:52] and it as soon as God did something here
[45:55] it is get it when God opened his
[45:57] spiritual sight all around there the
[45:59] profit stood chariots of fire dangers of
[46:01] fire why he's seeing why the chariots of
[46:04] fire outnumber that Syrian army by the
[46:05] thousands the mountains was on fire
[46:08] Ainge was a fire horses of fire chariots
[46:12] of fire look about God said just the
[46:14] same tonight
[46:16] I wonder what would happen if a man here
[46:18] tonight has the power to strike across
[46:20] your eyes and say look standing around
[46:22] this Tabernacle tonight you would be a
[46:25] member here the rest of your life oh
[46:28] yeah if we could see the angels around
[46:31] us we'd want to be a member here the
[46:33] rest of our lives
[46:34] because God backs up his word he's not
[46:38] with denominations there are no longer
[46:39] the mouthpiece of God but the mouthpiece
[46:41] of God is the bride of Jesus cry man
[46:44] exactly right yet he said sometimes you
[46:47] can't see it with your hat tries but you
[46:49] can feel the impulse of it something
[46:52] here a sixth sense that denotes
[46:54] something is near in a head now he said
[46:57] they didn't see it he didn't see that
[46:59] first but Elijah probably didn't see it
[47:02] but he asked for the boy's eyes to see
[47:03] it but he liked she was conscious that
[47:06] they were there amen remember good hazus
[47:10] all yet have his eyes kind of open to
[47:13] see all the angels just like here with
[47:16] Daniel just like here was Saint John I'm
[47:19] sorry
[47:19] nothing huh just like here with the wise
[47:22] men right amen and also st. Paul's what
[47:25] it is I said Thomas one times two let me
[47:27] put my hands at his side and she said
[47:30] now you see him will leave how much
[47:31] greater is their reward who's never yet
[47:34] seen and yet believe that's us tonight -
[47:38] whosoever will believe without seeing a
[47:40] man you realize you get a greater
[47:42] blessing tonight you may believe there's
[47:44] angels here that even if you saw the
[47:46] Angels our reward is crater riot because
[47:49] we are just taking God at face value of
[47:52] his word a man Haven we're just taking
[47:54] it at God's eye but bless you more just
[47:57] for believing my written word and Matt
[47:59] out you even see the supernatural
[48:00] reality man exactly right he said more
[48:03] blessed are you to believe what you
[48:06] haven't seen so God's Word I absolutely
[48:09] not
[48:09] there must be angels and caps around all
[48:11] about all amen amen
[48:13] for the character of those who fear the
[48:14] Lord Jesus amen now Daniel verse 8
[48:18] negative 10 verse 8 their cross up the
[48:21] load and saw this great vision and there
[48:23] remain no strength in me for my Commodus
[48:25] was turned into corruption
[48:28] and I retain no strength yet heard I the
[48:31] voice of his words and when I heard the
[48:32] voice of his words that I was in I was
[48:35] in a deep sleep on my face and my face
[48:36] toward the ground and behold in hand
[48:39] touched me which set me upon my knees
[48:42] and upon the palms of my hands so I just
[48:45] put some notes here Daniel found a deep
[48:47] sleep upon his faith with no strength
[48:48] until I had got you that's very similar
[48:51] to Saint John in Revelation 1 verses 12
[48:54] to 19 memory pause on his face is dead
[48:56] but Christ Himself came and touched him
[48:58] and he received strength praise God
[49:01] verse 11 huh and he said to the old
[49:04] Daniel a man greatly beloved understand
[49:07] the words that I speak unto thee and
[49:08] stand upright for unto thee have I now
[49:12] sent and when he had spoken this word
[49:13] unto me
[49:14] I stood trembling then he said to me
[49:17] fear not Daniel were from the first day
[49:19] that I was set thine heart to understand
[49:21] and to change myself before thy God thy
[49:24] words were heard and I'm come for thy
[49:28] words what a comfort u.s. church amen
[49:31] heaven love Daniel in a great way aren't
[49:34] you glad the Engel stood trembling and
[49:37] the angel said fear not the angel heard
[49:39] day you are day 1 now it was the age 21
[49:41] aren't you glad that God hurt you on day
[49:44] 1 you might be on day 365 you might be
[49:49] on day 30,000 you might be on Thursday
[49:52] but God heard your prayer on day 1 amen
[49:55] my man said he did not bring our brother
[49:58] Daniel such a wonderful salutation from
[50:01] God is Oh Daniel greatly beloved program
[50:03] said what did that make you good to
[50:06] think that God loved you if I wasn't
[50:09] crazy loved I just like to know that I'm
[50:12] kind of a little bit loved up there
[50:13] wouldn't you
[50:15] hey bad but the Bible said with great
[50:18] love wherewith he hath loved us so the
[50:21] Bible said he has great love to all his
[50:23] children amen
[50:24] that's exactly right sure he said you
[50:27] think he said just to think he thinks of
[50:30] me once in a while it would just make me
[50:33] watch the screen amen and
[50:35] sorry that heaven thinks a little Jessie
[50:38] sniff that is family oh it makes heaven
[50:40] what it makes us what a scream ahead
[50:42] I think that heaven remembers up Cygnus
[50:46] just to think that he even cares for me
[50:49] and we have the assurance that he does
[50:51] care for us because he said while were
[50:53] yet sinners Christ died in our stead
[50:55] hallelujah
[50:57] program tries encourages hear about the
[50:59] 21-day so he says sometimes you pray I
[51:03] believe Daniel the angel couldn't get to
[51:04] one time he was asking a probably 21
[51:06] days wasn't it 21 days for if you get
[51:09] there see now if you'd have lost faith
[51:12] they've lost out but you just do exactly
[51:16] what God says do this is his word first
[51:19] the other secondarily a man look what
[51:23] I'm saying
[51:23] the first thing above even a
[51:26] supernatural visitation is the word
[51:28] Emmanuel that's what we need Church
[51:30] that's Loudy that's what we all need we
[51:31] just eat faith in the first thing which
[51:34] is God's right word right then if you
[51:36] get a secondary experience you know you
[51:38] hear a voice you see a vision you have a
[51:40] dream that's wonderful that's just a
[51:42] second identification but all we need is
[51:46] the first one 1980 I meant and he says
[51:49] if you lose faith you Lou Staudt so god
[51:52] help us a persevere of us and never give
[51:55] up
[51:55] that's why we come to the house of God
[51:57] God keeps encouraging us strengthening
[51:59] us stay with it
[52:01] don't doubt don't clear half the side
[52:03] anything that would cause you to turn
[52:05] aside from God's Word and stay with his
[52:07] eternal unfailing word for it will never
[52:10] fail us ain't man hallelujah he's
[52:14] encouraging us don't lose faith and one
[52:17] of these days I want to get to that
[52:18] study that's my next study I think I
[52:20] will not list I would look at the
[52:21] scriptures where it says faint not
[52:23] because we are totally
[52:26] constantly and I punish so faint don't
[52:29] give up don't give up hope don't give up
[52:31] pray don't give up we must not give up
[52:34] we must keep on the firing line and then
[52:36] because as long as it's God's written
[52:38] word God is obligated to his word
[52:41] hallelujah Graham said he cross all
[52:44] heaven earth to make sure one word of
[52:46] his did it fail that's how much he packs
[52:49] up his word other than it's exactly
[52:51] right
[52:52] verse 13 I lost my spot here so pardon
[52:56] me stepping through the Bible lost my
[52:59] spot
[52:59] the Prince of Persia withstood the age
[53:02] of the Lord until Michael one of the
[53:04] chief Prince's
[53:04] came to help the angel the Lord so this
[53:08] angel Lord was withstood he was kind of
[53:10] fighting against so it seems both the
[53:13] age of the Lord at the Prince of Persia
[53:15] were of equal rank in the angel rank
[53:18] they were opposing to be princes Michael
[53:22] was one of the chief Prince's though and
[53:24] his help allowed the angel Lord to come
[53:27] through to Daniel 21 days he wrestled
[53:30] with the Prince of Persia so recall that
[53:33] demons are territorial right he was
[53:37] wrestling the Prince of Babylon though
[53:40] the Prince of Persia was arrested in the
[53:44] Prince of Northwest lling the Prince of
[53:47] Persia because demons are territorial he
[53:51] says and they demons do not even want to
[53:54] leave their own countries remember the
[53:55] demons that were went to the Sligh they
[53:58] said please they told Jesus please don't
[54:00] cast us out of our country
[54:01] and Jesus said fine Jesus can go on the
[54:04] slide see because demons are set down
[54:07] and they like to rule over the place
[54:10] where they are they don't like to lead
[54:12] and brother Branham said demons even
[54:14] have wars amongst themselves see because
[54:18] their kingdoms going to fall our
[54:19] kingdoms not divided our kingdom can
[54:21] never fall right but ze kingdom is going
[54:24] to fall other than a guy man that's
[54:26] exactly right on the 38 now let's go
[54:29] through the quote here where it says in
[54:31] victory day he says we find that because
[54:33] the people do this and cause these great
[54:36] fusses and so forth now see as long as
[54:39] saying controls that there's going to be
[54:40] wars and troubles in war jesus said so
[54:42] in Saint Matthew 24 you'll hear of wars
[54:45] and rumors of wars and Wars of war why
[54:47] because the Prince of the earth the safe
[54:50] and the power of the nations there is a
[54:52] national spirit
[54:53] here at national sphere here it's Devils
[54:55] they can't get along with one another
[54:58] what's our national spirit entertainment
[55:00] right America wants to be entertained
[55:02] make me laugh make me giggle make me
[55:05] excited
[55:06] you do it to me you entertain me you get
[55:08] me to a spot where I'm excited but God
[55:10] but God tells us we've got to die to
[55:12] ourselves amen we can't rely upon
[55:15] entertainment we've got a we've got to
[55:17] get the channel we got to get in
[55:19] preparation we got to create the
[55:21] atmosphere ourselves because we're
[55:22] creators amen amen
[55:24] see that's why we come to church we pray
[55:26] you say God help me to create the
[55:28] atmosphere I'm not here to be
[55:29] entertained by a preacher or a song
[55:31] leader or a piano player
[55:33] I'm here to create an atmosphere on
[55:35] illuminate exactly right I may have said
[55:39] did you ever take a bunch in the Eskimo
[55:41] Eskimo country up there where you go on
[55:44] dog sleds northern Alaska way out there
[55:45] in the northwestern territory when the
[55:48] guy there was tie the dogs off gone
[55:51] Huskies he tied on one here went out
[55:53] there right there I said why you not for
[55:56] said they are so full of the devil they
[55:59] kill one another just kill that's all
[56:02] they think about mothers are there's
[56:05] demons in North America and then demons
[56:07] up in the Eskimo country and now he said
[56:09] the demons even get on animals well he
[56:12] said that's the devil you see he's a
[56:14] killer
[56:15] he's just the nation just even Devils
[56:18] fighting Devils they just fight one
[56:20] another but God is all of see so you
[56:25] can't do nothing but love one another
[56:28] amen see when there's fights and
[56:30] churches see what of this it's Satan
[56:32] getting it because all God wants to do
[56:33] is for us to love each other man so you
[56:37] see the whole principle basis right back
[56:39] against them spirits exactly back to the
[56:42] beginning Genesis is the seed chapter
[56:45] two produces everything then that we
[56:46] have in the earth today not what a
[56:49] striking thought
[56:50] demons body demons right but not only
[56:53] that but then when they angel or once
[56:55] they get through an answer Daniels
[56:57] requests the Prince of Persia so that
[57:00] the chief demon of that Persian Empire
[57:02] he rises up to fight
[57:04] Fortson you're not getting to that
[57:05] prophet of God so fast you're going to
[57:07] go through me and he fought for 21 days
[57:10] until Michael came the Archangel right
[57:13] the Archangel came and helped him out so
[57:16] we could deliver the message to God's
[57:17] prophet see Church there's there's
[57:19] higher principalities there's things
[57:21] going on up above we just need to be
[57:23] patient with the Lord praise God don't
[57:26] get up they should be patient
[57:28] thanks God because there's things going
[57:29] on we can't see we must trust in the
[57:31] unfailing Word of God exactly right now
[57:34] let me get back to Mara at the end of 10
[57:36] to 13 I like that praise the Lord
[57:43] now verse 13 I didn't read that but the
[57:46] Prince of the kingdom of Persia
[57:47] withstood me one of the twenty days but
[57:49] lo Michael one of the chief Prince's
[57:51] came to help me and I remain there with
[57:53] the kings of Persia so see that you had
[57:56] to get help from Michael now verse 14
[57:59] Malachi lydic you need some help tonight
[58:01] read it by God's grace now - you read 14
[58:04] and 15 now I am come to make me
[58:09] understand what shall befall thy people
[58:11] in the latter days we had the vision is
[58:13] for many days and when he had spoken
[58:16] such words into me I set my face toward
[58:18] the ground and I became dumb look just
[58:21] when the angel speaks the word he
[58:23] becomes dumb he becomes powerless just
[58:25] as it just for an angel speaking to him
[58:28] Lydia you read 16 and 17 then I opened
[58:37] my mouth on stage and said that's it
[58:39] before me o my lord by the vision my
[58:42] sorrows are turned upon me and I retreat
[58:45] and go straight for how can a servant of
[58:47] this my lord talk with this my lord
[58:50] press for me straightway there there
[58:52] remain a man verse 18 then there came
[58:57] again and touched me one like the
[58:59] appearance of a man and he strengthened
[59:01] me so we can see the angel or came to
[59:03] help Daniel understand what would happen
[59:05] to Israel in the latter days yet the
[59:08] vision was for many days in the future
[59:10] still hundreds of years and some of them
[59:12] thousands of years because in Chapter 12
[59:14] we start
[59:15] about or props talking about the
[59:17] tribulation and chapter 11 he hasn't
[59:19] been there about Armageddon
[59:21] now strength and breath left Daniel at
[59:24] the presence and the word this angel but
[59:27] the angel touches Daniel and he gains
[59:30] the strength
[59:31] look at verse 19 I like this this right
[59:33] here shows the power of the spoken word
[59:34] let's look at verse 19 have you ever
[59:36] eaten verse 19 sir and Sam open greatly
[59:40] beloved paradise peace be unto thee be
[59:44] strong
[59:45] yea and be strong and when he had spoken
[59:48] unto me I was strengthened and said this
[59:51] my lord speak for thou has strengthened
[59:54] me David so see how the angel spoken he
[59:58] was fearful so the angel I to say fear
[1:00:00] not so I wrote you know I'm just writing
[1:00:02] Daniel breaking below strengthen as the
[1:00:04] angel spoke be strong showing the power
[1:00:07] of the spoken word to discuss that as he
[1:00:10] said be strong he received the strength
[1:00:13] is that what you feel sometimes with the
[1:00:15] preaching of the word you just so much
[1:00:16] preach it and preach it right to your
[1:00:18] life and while the preaching is going
[1:00:20] forth it makes you happy and give you
[1:00:22] strength praise God it gives you courage
[1:00:23] it gives you the confidence that the
[1:00:25] Word of God you receive those strength
[1:00:28] as the word is being spoken to you on
[1:00:30] about - that's how I felt last Sunday
[1:00:32] when brother Sammy was preaching to us
[1:00:33] take that as he preached the word I just
[1:00:36] received strengthened by the discerning
[1:00:38] different things going on I was very
[1:00:40] thankful for that now for the power of
[1:00:42] the spoken word and then notice of verse
[1:00:45] 19 now he's ready to listen once he
[1:00:48] strengthened in the Lord and I'll tell
[1:00:50] you and I will be when we're strong in
[1:00:53] the Lord now we can listen to what's
[1:00:54] being said right but if we come to
[1:00:56] church tired and worn out and
[1:00:58] discouraged and and speaking negative
[1:01:00] and and speaking death rather like we're
[1:01:02] weak in the faith and we can't receive
[1:01:04] the Word of God but we've got to be
[1:01:06] strong praise God I'm going to be able
[1:01:08] to receive it when we're strong we can
[1:01:10] hear the word of the Lord it's exactly
[1:01:12] right
[1:01:12] amen verse 20 then he said no it's
[1:01:16] nowhere for him come unto thee and now
[1:01:19] will I return to fight with the Prince
[1:01:20] of Persia and when I am gone for lo the
[1:01:23] Prince of grisha shall come so verse 20
[1:01:27] the angel Lord would return to by
[1:01:29] the Prince of Persia but he also
[1:01:31] prophesied that Greece would follow
[1:01:33] Persia as the next Gentile word rule
[1:01:36] power so let them know that no member
[1:01:39] Daniel exceed Babylon rise up and
[1:01:40] Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar and now
[1:01:43] he's the mid some Medes and Persians
[1:01:44] right with Darius and now Cyrus but the
[1:01:47] angel lets him know next is going to
[1:01:49] come the Grecian Empire that vision I
[1:01:51] interpreted for Nebuchadnezzar that is
[1:01:54] going to come next
[1:01:54] he let them know numbers 21 is the last
[1:01:58] verse I told you it's going to be a
[1:01:59] shorter message tonight hard to believe
[1:02:00] I could preach this short but you want
[1:02:03] to be mindful verse 21 but I will show
[1:02:06] thee that which is noted in the
[1:02:08] scripture of truth and there is none
[1:02:10] that holds with me in these things but
[1:02:13] Michael your prince so before the angel
[1:02:17] the Lord leaves he would show Daniel
[1:02:19] that which is noted in the scripture of
[1:02:21] truth in other words this seems to refer
[1:02:24] to the word that's already recorded in
[1:02:26] heaven because the Bible said that the
[1:02:29] Word of God is forever settled in heaven
[1:02:31] there must be some copy of God's Word
[1:02:33] somewhere already had it before batik
[1:02:35] and written on earth right because it's
[1:02:37] forever settled it's already settled in
[1:02:39] heaven just as the lamb was already
[1:02:41] slain the foundation or the mind of God
[1:02:43] before the foundation of the world all
[1:02:46] these things have happened beforehand
[1:02:48] that's right now chapters 11 and 12 are
[1:02:52] what the angel is going to show Daniel
[1:02:54] further after a Daniel had fasted and
[1:02:58] prayed and saw the things of God so
[1:03:00] you'll see that I should read Daniel 11
[1:03:01] and 12 maybe agree that this week you'll
[1:03:03] see that it's the angel continuing to
[1:03:05] talk and explain what's going to happen
[1:03:07] with the Grecian Empire and then of
[1:03:09] course with the Antichrist spirit I'm
[1:03:11] sorry the Antichrist person and before
[1:03:14] he goes or before you guys all goes on
[1:03:16] to chapter 11 and 12 he says only
[1:03:19] Michael would hold in these things with
[1:03:22] the angel or fastener key to these
[1:03:24] things
[1:03:24] for some reason that Michael would just
[1:03:27] help out him in these matters Michael
[1:03:30] was the one chosen to hold that Prince
[1:03:31] of Persia aren't you glad God's got
[1:03:33] angels that stronger than demons aren't
[1:03:35] you glad you have nothing to fear no
[1:03:37] matter what demons come your way God's
[1:03:39] got angels that could overpower me
[1:03:41] a man just said his angels to get
[1:03:43] charged over you amen exactly right so
[1:03:46] in Chapter 11 we'll see the fall of the
[1:03:48] Persian and Greek Empire since recorded
[1:03:50] the kings of the north and south brother
[1:03:53] after the king of the north was Russia
[1:03:55] and the king of the south at least the
[1:03:58] history was Egypt at least in history
[1:04:01] but prophetically I'm not sure and then
[1:04:04] it goes into the vile person it spends
[1:04:06] as much of the chapter chapter going
[1:04:08] through the vow person which is
[1:04:09] Antiochus which is a type of the
[1:04:13] Antichrist as we already saw in Daniel
[1:04:15] chapter 8 remember that one and ends
[1:04:17] Antiochus then chapter 12 is a very
[1:04:20] short chapter it's the tribulation the
[1:04:22] Jewish remnant which are the 144,000
[1:04:25] let's save our feet by God's grace I'll
[1:04:27] stop right there I don't preach about a
[1:04:28] half hour hey that's the shortest I've
[1:04:31] ever preached testing right there the
[1:04:33] grace of the Lord but how did he want to
[1:04:34] be faithful to the Lord and they want to
[1:04:37] be able to wait twenty one days I want
[1:04:40] to be 200 days 2,100 days 90 days we
[1:04:44] must wait we must remember that God
[1:04:46] hears us on day number one Amen God is
[1:04:49] faithful to bring us the revelation of
[1:04:52] that which we seek for Daniel was
[1:04:54] seeking memory was fasting he said help
[1:04:56] me understand this how can understand
[1:04:58] this 21 days later God helps him to
[1:05:00] understand the praise God and now we're
[1:05:02] living in the day with everything that
[1:05:04] Daniel wrote even if he didn't
[1:05:06] understand it God has revealed to get to
[1:05:08] us through the prophet of Malachi 4 amen
[1:05:11] blessing praise God let's close with a
[1:05:14] song or two by the grace of the Lord
