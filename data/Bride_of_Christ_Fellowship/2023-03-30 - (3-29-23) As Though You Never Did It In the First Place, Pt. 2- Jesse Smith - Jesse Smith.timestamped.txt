[0:00] God here tonight Heavenly Father we just
[0:02] want to tell you
[0:05] one thing we know that
[0:07] remember
[0:13] your people Lord God

[0:21] we read on Sunday

[1:15] [Music]
[1:52] if I was here tonight
[1:55] like if you would let's go back to First
[1:57] John chapter 3 verse 9 I'd like to
[1:59] continue that thought on as though you
[2:01] never did it in the first place maybe I
[2:03] can finish that tonight
[2:04] here by God's grace
[2:12] First John 3 verse 9.
[2:21] First John 3 verse 9.
[2:32] the scripture we would say is a paradox
[2:34] it's
[2:35] strange or hard to believe but yet it's
[2:36] true praise God there's a part of the
[2:38] believer
[2:40] that cannot sin and never has sin praise
[2:44] God that's God's own life
[2:46] in The Believer praise God
[2:49] First John 3 verse 9.
[2:56] let's read out if we can together First
[2:58] John 3 verse 9. let's begin on three one
[3:01] two three whosoever is born of God doth
[3:06] not commit sin for his seed remaineth in
[3:10] him and he cannot sin because he is born
[3:14] of God may God has blessings Serena's
[3:16] word may be seated God bless you all
[3:18] it's great to see everybody in the house
[3:19] of the Lord tonight
[3:22] I'd like to maybe finish this up here
[3:24] tonight I'm not quite sure tonight I
[3:26] listened to this portion this is of
[3:28] course the end of the sermon uh of the
[3:30] invisible Union
[3:32] of the Earthly bride and the Heavenly
[3:34] bridegroom and there's a 20-minute
[3:37] section right towards the end where
[3:38] brother Brown talks about how we've
[3:40] never done it in the first place praise
[3:42] God of course he's talking about the
[3:43] soul as we looked at last time how many
[3:46] thank God for a soul that never did it
[3:47] in the first place praise God there's an
[3:49] anointing that comes upon the believer's
[3:51] soul that's God's own life that's God's
[3:53] Own Spirit the Bible calls it a seed of
[3:55] God and though of course we know if it's
[3:57] a seed what's going to happen it's going
[3:58] to grow praise God that's what brother
[4:00] Adam said when you get the Holy Ghost he
[4:02] said it's like he said it's like the
[4:03] size of a button he said
[4:06] and he said it just grows out the more
[4:07] you feed that the more you hunger on on
[4:10] the things of God the more you feed that
[4:11] spirit inside it just grows out and then
[4:14] what does it produce it produces the
[4:15] fruits of the spirit praise God it
[4:17] produces all these attributes in your
[4:19] life praise God it's like a seed that's
[4:21] watered and it brings forth and and
[4:23] thank God for that praise God that
[4:25] people can see the fruits of God in our
[4:26] lives amen so I'd like to look at this
[4:29] here tonight as though you never did it
[4:31] in the first place again we're looking
[4:32] at the soul of man by God's grace the
[4:36] soul that gets the baptism of the Holy
[4:39] Ghost praise God
[4:41] so I'd like to uh again just read the
[4:44] origin of the sermon belgram ends his
[4:46] sermon in Shreveport and he says you are
[4:48] standing completely Justified as though
[4:50] you never did it at the beginning this
[4:53] is my message to the church now as we go
[4:54] off the air just a minute you are
[4:56] standing and if you're standing on God's
[4:57] word and with God's word every amen
[5:00] every jot every title how many standing
[5:02] on every word of God tonight
[5:03] hallelujah thank God where are you
[5:06] standing I'm trying to tell you pull
[5:07] away from that Shucks which we have
[5:09] right we've left denominations we've
[5:11] left that we have to make sure we don't
[5:12] become a denomination we have to make
[5:14] sure we keep becoming revived in the
[5:16] Holy Spirit praise God
[5:18] and get out here in the wheat where you
[5:20] can ripe before the sun I hear the
[5:22] coming of the combine you're standing
[5:24] complete and Justified like you never
[5:26] did it in the first place hallelujah
[5:29] amen now if you already brought your
[5:31] Bibles go back to Romans uh seven here I
[5:34] think I just want to read this again
[5:36] just a good reminder here what brother
[5:38] Brown's talking about
[5:43] whatever I was talking about our
[5:44] spiritual
[5:45] relationship with the Lord we were
[5:48] spiritually married to the law we'd say
[5:50] or married to the law of sin and death
[5:53] now Jews of course they would they would
[5:55] have said they were married to Moses's
[5:57] law but we would say if we weren't
[5:58] Jewish we were married to the law of sin
[6:00] and death
[6:01] but then the husband had to die that
[6:04] husband had to die so we could be
[6:05] married to Christ
[6:07] praise God
[6:09] so let's go to verse 4. wherefore my
[6:12] brethren ye also are become dead to the
[6:14] law by the body of Christ that ye should
[6:18] be married to another even to him who's
[6:20] raised from the dead that we should
[6:23] bring forth fruit unto God what a
[6:26] privileged church I just thought of it
[6:27] now just what a privilege to be married
[6:28] to a resurrected savior
[6:31] you know as we come upon that Easter is
[6:34] that is that your Revelation I'm married
[6:35] to the one who rose from the dead
[6:37] that's my that's my ruler
[6:39] that's my head that's the one that I
[6:41] answer to that's the one I listen to
[6:42] that's the one I worship that's the one
[6:45] who I obey the resurrected Christ
[6:48] what a thought my goodness gracious
[6:50] married to the Risen one and church
[6:53] don't feel bad he takes he takes all
[6:55] people that that are faulty and have
[6:58] mistakes if he took Peter he'll take you
[7:00] church
[7:01] amen if he took all those disciples when
[7:04] they all ran away from him then he'll
[7:06] surely take you praise God right because
[7:09] we've all ran from God we've all fallen
[7:11] short of the glory of God but what do we
[7:12] always do the spirit always draws us
[7:14] right back into Fellowship praise God so
[7:16] we are married Church the Bible says
[7:18] we're married to the resurrected Christ
[7:20] Hallelujah if we're married then what
[7:23] the Bible says we have to do we have to
[7:24] submit to our husband in all things
[7:26] praise God right obeying the word of God
[7:29] God help us do that church
[7:31] he will and then we bring forth fruit
[7:33] unto God so as we receive our husband's
[7:36] word and our husband's directions you
[7:39] know it works in our lives and we bring
[7:40] forth fruits unto God we could say that
[7:42] be Soul saved we could say uh that would
[7:45] be all the nine fruits of the spirit
[7:47] praise God we bring forth all those
[7:49] fruits unto our husband our husband here
[7:52] directs us in our lives and all of our
[7:54] works glorify God that's why we glorify
[7:57] God with our jobs
[7:58] that's why we glorify God in our
[8:00] families praise God that's bringing
[8:02] forth fruit unto God when people know
[8:04] you're a Christian when people know
[8:05] you're different when people know
[8:07] there's there's something unique about
[8:09] you that's a fruit unto God you brought
[8:11] forth fruit unto God when you see it
[8:13] when you see your life changing you're
[8:15] no longer addicted to what you be used
[8:17] to be addicted to that's fruit unto God
[8:19] hallelujah amen that's fruit unto God
[8:22] but the things I used to do I do them no
[8:24] more praise God
[8:26] it's a great Victory because we're now
[8:27] married to another we're taking orders
[8:29] we're taking direction from Another one
[8:31] not the law of sin and death
[8:34] uh that that husband is dead praise God
[8:36] can you say Amen that your old life is
[8:39] dead praise God
[8:40] that that old life it's dead and gone
[8:43] praise God
[8:44] right the old husband is dead I'm
[8:46] married to a new one and he's he's Alive
[8:49] forevermore praise God this husband will
[8:51] never die praise God oh what a blessing
[8:54] amen the leadership of Jesus Christ will
[8:56] never die in our lives amen this husband
[8:59] will never die praise God he died once
[9:01] and he'll never he takes a death for all
[9:03] of us but he now he ever lives for us
[9:05] praise God Amen now verse 5 now for when
[9:08] we were in the flesh the Motions of sin
[9:09] which were by the law did work in our
[9:11] members to bring forth fruit unto death
[9:14] but now we are delivered from the law
[9:17] that being dead where and we were held
[9:19] that we should serve in the newness of
[9:22] spirit and not in the oldness of the
[9:25] letter Hallelujah
[9:26] all right so we thank God for that
[9:28] praise God
[9:29] I want to uh look at a few more quotes
[9:32] here by God's grace from the sermon
[9:36] and I want to look at specifically at
[9:37] justification again in the context of
[9:41] this sermon here so
[9:43] here in this here's where brother Adam
[9:45] starts a section on you've never done it
[9:47] in the first place brother Brown says
[9:49] you're not only forgiven but you're
[9:51] Justified Glory Justified Romans 5 1
[9:54] said yeah Romans 5 1 said therefore
[9:57] being justified by faith now that's the
[9:58] verse I'm going to read it since we're
[9:59] already in Romans 6 there 7. we might as
[10:02] well turn one page over to Romans 5.
[10:04] therefore being justified by faith we
[10:07] have peace with God through our Lord
[10:10] Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[10:13] and I also want to read verse 2 by whom
[10:16] also we have access by faith into this
[10:19] grace where and we stand and we rejoice
[10:21] in Hope of the glory of God hallelujah
[10:25] so Jesus gives us peace with God and
[10:27] then Jesus gives us access into Grace
[10:30] Hallelujah Church we've accessed God's
[10:33] grace we have we have the ability to to
[10:36] to to access it to to grab it when we
[10:40] need it praise God help me find yourself
[10:41] needing Grace throughout the day praise
[10:43] God
[10:44] we have access into that praise God
[10:46] let's just use the example of you know
[10:48] when you when you would buy food from a
[10:50] machine sometimes you sometimes you have
[10:52] money to buy food let's say you need a
[10:54] let's say you need a big water bottle
[10:56] from the from the uh the vendor right
[10:58] the vending machine hopefully you don't
[11:00] buy pop like we talked about on Sunday
[11:02] don't buy that buy the water that's
[11:04] better for you much better but see you
[11:07] got access to that if you've got the
[11:08] money you have access to that water
[11:10] praise God and that's what it is here
[11:12] that's the same idea you have you have
[11:14] the money you have brother Adam said
[11:16] that's Faith you have the faith if you
[11:18] have the faith to approach God then
[11:19] you've got the payment to get what you
[11:21] have need of praise God
[11:23] it's a blessing praise God we have
[11:25] access
[11:26] into Grace Hallelujah through Jesus
[11:28] Christ Our Lord amen
[11:31] so if you need that tonight whatever you
[11:33] have need up for Access you have it
[11:34] tonight by God's grace
[11:36] whatever the Bible said all spiritual
[11:38] blessings we have access to every
[11:40] spiritual blessing every spiritual gift
[11:42] we have access to it tonight praise God
[11:45] so we don't have to leave out of here
[11:46] depress or discourage or hope less we
[11:49] can leave out of here hopeful praise God
[11:52] that we have access in the grace praise
[11:54] God
[11:55] we don't have to leave out here for a
[11:56] while I'm going to lose my salvation or
[11:58] I'm going to lose this or I'm gonna lose
[11:59] that we're not going to lose anything
[12:00] we're only going to gain praise God Amen
[12:03] because we have access into Grace praise
[12:05] God oh it's a blessing to know that
[12:07] Grace is with us amen now here's where I
[12:09] want to uh
[12:10] I want to I want to just start maybe
[12:12] rightly dividing a little bit you know
[12:14] like I said I've heard different
[12:15] preachers take some of these quotes and
[12:17] then misuse them like they would tell
[12:19] the people they never did in the first
[12:21] place well if they take it the wrong way
[12:23] then why do we need the cross
[12:25] why do we even need Jesus if we never
[12:27] sinned we actually wouldn't need Jesus
[12:29] right because we never did it in the
[12:31] first place
[12:33] but that's the wrong attitude that's
[12:34] used to kind of pump people up and uh
[12:36] and to try to kind of trick them into
[12:38] thinking everything's right with God
[12:40] church now really in in the Eternal
[12:43] perspective everything is right with God
[12:45] we have peace with God
[12:47] right but we know in our in our in our
[12:49] time in time and space when we commit
[12:51] sins or we're going through battles or
[12:53] we have complexes that we saw on Sunday
[12:55] you know we can feel discouraged we know
[12:58] there's consequences to our mistakes
[12:59] right uh and in those moments that's
[13:01] when we need encouragement praise God
[13:03] that's the moments where we need that
[13:05] praise God and so God offers that to us
[13:08] and we know even in those moments we
[13:10] recognize that we're we still fall short
[13:12] of the glory of God
[13:13] in our minds in our flesh the the spirit
[13:16] is willing but the flesh is weak praise
[13:18] God right we understand that
[13:21] and so we can realize you know yes our
[13:23] soul never did it in the first place but
[13:25] then we find ourselves doing things
[13:26] praise God and sometimes we do it in the
[13:29] first place right away in the morning
[13:30] did I say like that
[13:31] you know our soul never did the first
[13:34] place but sometimes we have a bad start
[13:35] to the day praise God
[13:38] and we make a mistake for in the first
[13:39] place
[13:40] in our first interaction in the morning
[13:42] instead of being happy well we're cranky
[13:44] instead of being joyful uh we're
[13:47] complaining
[13:48] right
[13:51] now brother Adam says Look up the word
[13:52] he said the word don't mean forgiven the
[13:55] word means Justified it don't mean
[13:57] you're forgiven now here's the example
[13:58] he gives for instance you heard I got
[14:00] drunk and done some evil things and
[14:02] everything then you come around and say
[14:03] to me you found out I didn't do them
[14:05] then you come and say brother Ram I
[14:06] forgive you he said forgive me I didn't
[14:08] do it at the first place
[14:11] now that's true like if someone
[14:12] condemned you for something and then
[14:14] they find out you never did it they
[14:15] don't have to forgive you because you
[14:16] never did anything wrong
[14:18] but church that's speaking to your soul
[14:20] praise God
[14:21] that's not speaking to your mind or your
[14:24] flesh because sometimes because
[14:26] oftentimes we do give into those areas
[14:30] right and then we have we would have to
[14:32] admit yes I did say that yes I actually
[14:35] did that and it was sinful yes I thought
[14:38] that was planning that yes I actually
[14:40] did that but with the soul your soul
[14:42] never did it in the first place
[14:45] is that right church that's what the
[14:46] Bible said you're the seed of God cannot
[14:49] sin praise God
[14:50] so this is what brother man is saying
[14:52] here he's saying you can't condemn the
[14:55] seed of God that was predestinated to
[14:58] you from the beginning
[14:59] okay
[15:01] now if I did do it I'm guilty
[15:05] but you could forgive me but I wouldn't
[15:07] but you could forgive me but I wouldn't
[15:09] be guilty but I'm not yet Justified
[15:11] because I actually done it
[15:14] okay
[15:15] but the word Justified as though you
[15:18] never done it amen it's not even
[15:19] regarded at all how's it done so here he
[15:21] gives the illustration he uses Romans
[15:23] seven again with the the two husbands
[15:25] right the husband of the law of sin and
[15:27] death and the husband of Christ the
[15:28] resurrected one how's it done though in
[15:31] God's book of the sea of forgetfulness
[15:32] your old book in marriage is divorce and
[15:35] dead
[15:36] their old life it's not even the
[15:37] memories of God Amen you're Justified
[15:39] therefore being justified it was accused
[15:42] you was con you was accused you've never
[15:44] done in the first place the old Union is
[15:46] the Sea of God's forgetfulness you
[15:48] wasn't married to it to begin with
[15:51] like your soul was never married to the
[15:53] law of sin and death right the part of
[15:56] you that was born from God hallelujah
[15:58] see he the bridegroom bore your shame
[16:01] himself for you and your place he took
[16:03] your place for you were predestinated
[16:05] for him to be in his bride because
[16:07] that's true the Bible said you're chosen
[16:09] in his mind before the foundation World
[16:11] think of that
[16:12] God chose you to be his bride praise God
[16:15] you know as men the men here we got to
[16:17] choose our bride thank God we did amen
[16:19] I'm glad but we also have to recognize
[16:22] Jesus chose you as his bride amen
[16:25] look at all the billions of people he
[16:27] could have chose from and he chose you
[16:29] Hallelujah
[16:31] amen what a blessing he chose me amen
[16:35] he chose us that ought to encourage us
[16:37] tonight praise God
[16:38] Hallelujah he chose you in his mind by
[16:42] predestination praise God
[16:45] before the foundation of the world
[16:48] the Bible said so you are a
[16:50] predestinated seed
[16:52] hallelujah amen
[16:55] now um
[16:57] now personally when now when here's
[16:59] where I'm getting into a little bit of
[17:00] rightly dividing going back to the
[17:02] scripture now personally I I can't find
[17:04] that justified means we never sin the
[17:06] first place because if you look at the
[17:08] actual Greek definition it doesn't say
[17:10] that okay so I want to take tonight I
[17:12] want to look at verses about
[17:13] justification and context like we know
[17:16] what Brother Ray I'm saying brother I'm
[17:17] saying the soul never did in the first
[17:18] place in other words God's spirit cannot
[17:21] sin
[17:22] God's spirit never did Sin praise God
[17:25] right the part of God where he thought
[17:28] about sister who and he sent the holy
[17:30] ghost that part that this is going to be
[17:31] a sister who is eternal spirit that part
[17:34] never sinned
[17:36] right
[17:38] so let's examine these verses about
[17:40] justification to kind of uh get the
[17:42] right understanding here by the grace of
[17:44] God
[17:45] and it seems brother Brandon was
[17:46] emphasizing the soul that cannot sin the
[17:50] soul
[17:51] never sinned and cannot sin praise God
[17:55] now here's the word justify here's what
[17:56] it means so here just so everybody can
[17:58] see it it means you're free it means
[18:00] you're righteous
[18:01] it renders righteous or such as he ought
[18:04] to be
[18:06] it means to show exhibit events one to
[18:09] be righteous such as he is and wishes
[18:11] himself to be considered
[18:12] to declare pronounce one to be just
[18:15] righteous such as he ought to be so it's
[18:18] a declaration that a person is just it's
[18:21] a declaration that someone is righteous
[18:23] praise God
[18:25] all right
[18:27] as he would like to be as he wishes to
[18:30] be praise God now all have sinned and
[18:32] fallen short of God's glory right the
[18:34] Bible says that Romans 3 23 we memorize
[18:37] that when we were little children
[18:37] hopefully and if not we got to start
[18:39] memorize that children and boy am I
[18:41] behind on Bible memorization I'll just
[18:42] say right here so forgive me children
[18:45] uh
[18:46] number of weeks behind on that
[18:49] now I just thought you know here's what
[18:50] you can do with the nice thing about
[18:51] technology you can click that word
[18:54] Justified and it occurs 36 times in the
[18:56] New Testament
[18:58] okay I know it's hard to read but
[18:59] um so it's twice in Matthew five times
[19:01] in Luke once in Acts 14 times the Romans
[19:03] twice in First Corinthians six times in
[19:05] Galatians you get the idea so you can
[19:07] see how does how do Bible writers use
[19:09] this word Justified
[19:11] okay because the Bible says you're
[19:13] Justified
[19:15] you have peace with God
[19:17] you're righteous as you ought to be
[19:19] you're righteous as you wish to be amen
[19:22] oh
[19:23] amen hallelujah praise God how many wish
[19:25] that God forgives all your sins tonight
[19:27] you got it
[19:30] Hallelujah you got it amen that's if
[19:32] you're Justified you got it
[19:34] don't got to worry about it because
[19:35] that's what justification is you're
[19:37] righteous as you want to be praise God
[19:40] I don't want to go to heaven with sins I
[19:42] want to go to heaven forgiven praise God
[19:43] well I got that if I'm Justified amen
[19:47] I've got a full pardon amen I got full
[19:50] forgiveness I have not my righteousness
[19:52] I've got the righteousness of Christ
[19:54] amen
[19:55] is that that's what the Bible says II
[19:56] Corinthians 5 21.
[19:58] he became sin that we might be made his
[20:01] righteousness so I've got to praise God
[20:04] amen thank God Hallelujah my soul's got
[20:07] it Hallelujah
[20:10] now I want to just read this one because
[20:12] this one in this text you know we don't
[20:15] think of the public in leaving saying
[20:17] well I never did it in the first place
[20:18] so let's look at this context remember
[20:20] the Pharisee comes he says thank God I
[20:23] never I never committed sins like this
[20:24] public and I'm so holy thank God I'm
[20:26] such a wonderful message believer they
[20:28] got them I'm better than everybody else
[20:30] that's a real prideful sinner
[20:33] thank God I'm not like him thank God I'm
[20:35] not going to hell like that person
[20:36] instead he should have had compassion on
[20:38] this person
[20:39] but said he went to he went to church
[20:41] just to exalt himself above everybody
[20:42] else now I know nobody does that here by
[20:44] God's grace right right that's why I'm
[20:47] believing right I'm believing with you
[20:48] we don't come here to compare one
[20:50] another to one another we come here to
[20:52] compare ourselves to Christ
[20:54] and we compare ourselves to Christ we're
[20:56] unworthy but we have to recognize he did
[20:58] give us the Divine Exchange
[21:00] he traded my sorrows for his Joys praise
[21:04] God I traded all my ashes for his Beauty
[21:07] praise God right that's that's the whole
[21:10] Isaiah 61. I've traded all this I've
[21:13] exchanged this he's given me the Divine
[21:15] exchange but the Publican he's looked
[21:18] down upon at church everybody's looking
[21:19] down at him and
[21:24] they won't even stand close enough
[21:25] picture that church now everybody here
[21:27] has somebody kind of close to them
[21:28] but picture the Publican he'd be all off
[21:31] all by himself
[21:33] she'll be like if everybody was up in
[21:34] the front row and Republican was in the
[21:36] back corner back there all by himself at
[21:39] church
[21:40] right but here we got all people that
[21:42] when love us Shake our hands say we love
[21:44] you God bless you he's all by himself
[21:46] and he was so humble he wouldn't even
[21:49] look up to heaven
[21:51] but he hid himself when was the last
[21:53] time you hit yourself so ashamed of your
[21:54] sin
[21:55] he smoked himself he said God he hit
[21:58] himself
[22:00] he says he had to hit something
[22:02] he was so ashamed of himself he actually
[22:04] hid himself he said God be merciful to
[22:06] me a sinner
[22:08] I've had times like that I've had times
[22:09] where I've even as a believer
[22:11] I've said God be merciful to me I need
[22:14] your grace
[22:15] and I've cried I've laid here around the
[22:17] floor and cried and said God be merciful
[22:19] to me
[22:20] I need God's forgiveness
[22:21] many times
[22:24] that was his prayer
[22:26] and Jesus says I tell you this man went
[22:29] down to his house Justified rather than
[22:31] the other now do you think he went down
[22:33] saying I never did those sins and
[22:36] all right God don't have to be merciful
[22:37] to me because I never did in the first
[22:39] place
[22:40] is that how he went down his home no he
[22:42] went down just rejoicing I know God
[22:44] forgave me
[22:45] I know God put my sins instead of in
[22:48] front of his face God put my sins behind
[22:50] him
[22:51] he said he went down to his house
[22:53] Justified rather than the other and
[22:55] everyone that exalts himself shall be
[22:57] amazed
[22:59] he that humeth himself shall be exalted
[23:02] so let's come to church like that let's
[23:03] come to church and have compassion on
[23:05] people well I wonder uh brother looks
[23:07] sad I wonder if I could encourage him
[23:09] tonight
[23:10] not like well no wonder he looks sad
[23:12] because he didn't listen to me last week
[23:13] whatever whatever no wonder she looks at
[23:17] it she said that to me last week you
[23:19] know whatever
[23:21] we ought to come to church and have
[23:22] compassion on one another praise God and
[23:24] let's not stand afar off from others
[23:26] let's shake hands with one now let's
[23:28] let's encourage one another by God's
[23:29] grace
[23:31] see he says I'm a sinner but the Bible
[23:34] Jesus says he leaves Justified
[23:38] so see that's why in that context I
[23:40] think brother man was referring to the
[23:41] soul
[23:42] the soul never in the first place right
[23:45] the soul never did it but as a sinner as
[23:47] sinner Say by Grace we leave the house
[23:49] of God saying thank you God for having
[23:51] mercy on me
[23:53] we realize we're still Sinners right in
[23:56] one way not in the soul now not in the
[23:58] soul
[24:01] but in our spirits and our flesh okay so
[24:04] that's a way that's the scripture that
[24:05] uses Justified that we've got to take
[24:07] into account it's the same Greek word
[24:08] we're justified by faith we have peace
[24:10] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[24:11] how do you get peace he confesses sins
[24:14] he asked for God's mercy
[24:17] that's how many want peace tonight with
[24:18] God that's all you got to do say God
[24:20] have mercy on me have mercy forgive my
[24:22] sins
[24:23] oh it's a beautiful beautiful story The
[24:26] Gospel
[24:27] for all of sin and come short of the
[24:29] glory of God being justified freely you
[24:31] didn't have to pay anything for it you
[24:32] just had to confess your sins and
[24:33] believe it
[24:34] freely by his grace through the
[24:37] Redemption that is in Christ whom God
[24:40] has set forth to be a propitiation
[24:41] through faith in his blood how many
[24:43] trusting in the blood tonight
[24:45] to declare Jesus righteousness for the
[24:48] remission of your sins that are passed
[24:50] through the forbearance of God Amen oh
[24:52] it's beautiful praise God thank God for
[24:54] the blood of Christ our faith is in the
[24:56] blood tonight amen
[25:00] but to him that worketh not that's us
[25:02] but believeth on him that justifies the
[25:07] ungodly
[25:08] remember we never in the first place
[25:09] that's just your soul
[25:11] right but God Jesus came to justify the
[25:14] ungodly those who sin in their minds and
[25:17] those who sin in their bodies that's who
[25:19] Jesus came to justify praise God
[25:22] so Paul this is the gospel Paul is
[25:24] giving us the gospel and Romans remember
[25:26] 14 times Paul uses the word justified in
[25:29] Romans
[25:31] 14 times Paul said God has declared you
[25:33] righteous as you want to be praise God
[25:35] oh God 14 times amen
[25:39] you were ungodly you were married to the
[25:42] husband of the law of sin and death but
[25:44] your husband died now you're married to
[25:46] Christ praise God uh you don't all your
[25:49] past is Forgiven all your passes behind
[25:51] you and boy do you have a bright future
[25:53] praise God Amen what a future you got
[25:56] praise God and what an awful future the
[25:59] devil has praise God
[26:01] but as the devil's chained up for a
[26:04] thousand years falling uh in as the
[26:07] Bible says in the bottomless pit while
[26:10] he's falling for a thousand years we're
[26:11] walking around the earth and we're
[26:13] reigning on the earth for a thousand
[26:15] years amen
[26:16] we're Vanishing and then appearing and
[26:18] we're building and we're planting we're
[26:21] doing all these things for a thousand
[26:22] years while he's fallen for a thousand
[26:24] years we're ruling and reigning with
[26:26] Christ for a thousand years amen what a
[26:29] trade amen thank God we're Justified
[26:31] thank God Christ justifies the ungodly
[26:34] praise God
[26:35] oh what a blessing it gives to us praise
[26:38] God and yet that devil at one time was
[26:40] deceiving us
[26:42] but we overcame him by the blood of the
[26:44] lamb and the word of Our Testimony
[26:46] praise God Amen
[26:49] and David describes the blessedness of
[26:51] this bride the bride of Christ
[26:54] unto whom God imputeth righteousness
[26:56] without your Works God makes you
[26:59] righteous before you did anything you
[27:00] just believed you just repented and God
[27:03] imputes righteousness to you
[27:06] saying blessed are they whose iniquities
[27:08] are forgiven and whose sins are covered
[27:13] trust you're feeling blessed tonight by
[27:15] God's grace
[27:17] the greatest blessing you have tonight
[27:18] is not 20 million dollars
[27:21] right the greatest blessing you're going
[27:23] to have is that your iniquities are
[27:24] forgiven and your sins are covered
[27:27] is that right hey man look at that and
[27:29] he justifies the ungodly we were ungodly
[27:32] but he declares us righteous as we wish
[27:34] to be praise God
[27:36] oh my God
[27:38] hallelujah praise God oh my God
[27:41] but God proved his love command his love
[27:43] toward us and that while we were yet
[27:45] sinners Christ died for us
[27:48] so see we did Sin right we did Sin in
[27:50] the first place our minds and our flesh
[27:52] but the soul never did Sin in the first
[27:55] place
[27:56] much more than being now justified by
[27:58] his blood
[28:00] we should be saved from wrath through
[28:03] him Church aren't you glad you're not
[28:05] going to be a part of the Great
[28:06] Tribulation period
[28:08] aren't you glad that the bombs that that
[28:11] Russia has with the names of America on
[28:13] it aren't you glad your name's not on
[28:14] that bomb
[28:16] praise God or however it's going to work
[28:18] out however how are the instructions
[28:19] going to work out aren't you glad your
[28:21] name is is not on the Martyr role of the
[28:23] Roman Catholic Church
[28:26] because you're not going to be here when
[28:27] the Mark is laid down we're not going to
[28:29] be here we're taking the Exodus because
[28:31] we're already Justified amen
[28:33] Justified freely by his blood praise God
[28:37] I'm already declared righteous by the
[28:39] blood because I've got faith in the
[28:41] blood praise God
[28:45] amen
[28:47] so because you're justified by the blood
[28:48] you're saved from Wrath
[28:51] you're not going to experience the wrath
[28:52] of God you're saved from Wrath
[28:55] oh my Hallelujah
[28:58] think about that church think about
[28:59] program said I said thousands of times a
[29:01] year think about thousands and thousands
[29:03] like that illustration I gave at
[29:04] Napoleon did I preach you here about the
[29:06] the sand
[29:09] maybe I just say it okay I was thinking
[29:11] you know the Bible says
[29:13] the love of God will cover a multitude
[29:16] of sin
[29:16] and I was praying there right before I
[29:18] went to Kansas I said Lord can you just
[29:19] give me some simple illustration because
[29:21] I can explain this to the people like I
[29:22] want to know for me too don't leave me
[29:24] out Lord
[29:26] I want to know too like how can you
[29:27] cover a multitude of my sin
[29:31] so I'll just sitting there thinking you
[29:32] know it's probably right there maybe at
[29:34] my desk I can't remember
[29:36] and all of a sudden my mind went to the
[29:37] ocean and sand
[29:39] I thought yeah
[29:47] when you go to the shore and you play
[29:49] around with the sand how much sand can
[29:51] you get how many grains can you get in
[29:52] one handful
[29:53] well corn decides you can get 10 000.
[29:56] grains of sand
[29:58] when you're at the beach how many like
[29:59] the beach
[30:01] ten thousand roll around says I sin
[30:03] thousands of times a year so if he sins
[30:06] if we sin 2 000 times a year
[30:09] then there's five years of sin
[30:11] that are represented with a handful of
[30:13] sand
[30:15] right now Church the devil wants us to
[30:17] look at that sand
[30:19] and he wants to make us guilty look at
[30:22] all those mistakes you made look at all
[30:23] that and then you drop it and you still
[30:25] got sand all over your hand you try to
[30:28] let go of your past right there's
[30:31] they're still sin
[30:34] doesn't seem like the next few years oh
[30:36] look at the Devil brings it up and said
[30:38] look
[30:39] remember you did that remember that
[30:43] devil I remember that
[30:46] right and so the devil tries and what it
[30:49] seems like we have a multitude of sin
[30:51] but church just give the earth a little
[30:54] bit of time
[30:55] I'll say like this just give God a
[30:57] little bit of time because that moon is
[30:59] rotating out there praise God
[31:02] and pretty soon the Earth the moon are
[31:04] moving together
[31:05] pretty soon the Earth the moon's going
[31:07] to get closer to the Earth right
[31:10] and it's going to move the waters in and
[31:13] let's say the devil he likes to take all
[31:15] your sins and he likes to build up all
[31:17] your sins like a dirty old sand castle
[31:20] right the devil says look look I build
[31:22] this up now talk about complexes here we
[31:23] are
[31:25] the devil builds up a complex well you
[31:27] did this and how could God ever love you
[31:28] and the devil's like see Jesse look at
[31:30] all your sins and pretty soon God's
[31:32] clock starts working Hallelujah I've
[31:35] seen it a couple times out there in
[31:36] South America amen give it a couple
[31:38] hours all these sand castles are on
[31:40] there it's a multitude of sin but Church
[31:43] give it the right time and season and
[31:45] the waves slowly come in deep calls unto
[31:48] deep praise God the water get closer and
[31:50] closer and pretty soon the waters come
[31:52] in and the waters wash over all the
[31:55] devil's sand castles and the church said
[31:57] look how easily God can put away your
[32:00] sins God can cover all your sins like
[32:02] the waters cover the Sands amen
[32:05] Hallelujah
[32:06] I don't care how big the sand castle The
[32:09] Devil Makes God's Mercy is more amen so
[32:12] praise the Lord God's Mercy is more
[32:14] Hallelujah
[32:16] amens that's how I explained to the
[32:17] Saints they they like that one over at
[32:19] Napoleon
[32:21] the devil brings up your last five years
[32:22] just show them hey the waters are coming
[32:24] in the love of God's going to come in
[32:26] and it's going to cover a multitude of
[32:27] my sins
[32:29] and God does it quite easily
[32:31] Hallelujah
[32:34] so that really encourage me that's how
[32:36] God that's how easily now that's just
[32:38] the waters think about the whole
[32:39] universe think how easily God can cover
[32:41] over our sins
[32:42] that's just on Earth praise God think
[32:45] about all the vast power God has think
[32:48] how he can easily cleanse us from all
[32:50] sin praise God
[32:52] amen like Waters cover the like Waters
[32:55] cover the sea praise God Waters cover
[32:57] the sands amen
[32:59] no you're not church at the unrighteous
[33:01] Center on the Heritage within the Bible
[33:03] just say you're righteous
[33:04] Obama just said you're righteous
[33:07] so you're going to inherit the earth be
[33:09] not deceived neither fornicators nor
[33:11] idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate
[33:13] that's the child molesters nor abusers
[33:15] themselves with mankind that's
[33:17] homosexuals nor thieves nor Covetous nor
[33:19] drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners
[33:21] shall inherit the kingdom of God did you
[33:22] see that school shooting this week that
[33:24] was a trans person and they're purposely
[33:27] attacking a Christian School
[33:29] going after Christians on purpose
[33:32] because they hate Christians
[33:36] Church you just got to be ready any hour
[33:38] none of us are guaranteed anything
[33:40] we've got to trust in the blood of Jesus
[33:41] Christ the girls were telling me on
[33:43] Saturday
[33:44] Eden was telling me I think it was
[33:45] eating or virtue said my daddy or my
[33:48] parents always say angels are always
[33:50] watching over me or something like that
[33:52] the angels and cap around those that
[33:54] fear the Lord praise God that's what the
[33:56] girls are might have been nature that's
[33:58] a good one I like that that's pretty
[33:59] praise God
[34:01] and I just read that in the scripture in
[34:03] Psalms where the Bible says the angel
[34:04] will not let you dash your foot against
[34:06] the stone praise God it'll keep you in
[34:08] all your ways let's trust God but at the
[34:10] same time you know God may have a
[34:11] testimony
[34:12] like I was texting a guy or emailed a
[34:14] guy this this week from Uganda and he
[34:16] said they have no food I said brother I
[34:18] said that's why I got a waiting list you
[34:19] got to wait till the funds come in so I
[34:21] could help you out
[34:22] and I said let me give you a satisfying
[34:24] scripture and I shared that scripture
[34:25] from Romans 8. even famine cannot
[34:28] separate us from the love of God
[34:31] and he said thank you that really
[34:32] encouraged me
[34:33] now see George because we're all going
[34:35] through different things we're not going
[34:36] through famine over here
[34:39] right we're going through we'd say just
[34:40] uh Temptation we're going through
[34:42] manifold Temptations of the Mind
[34:46] but still even these mind battles can't
[34:48] separate us from the love of God Amen
[34:51] neither can their lack of mine battles
[34:53] and just lack in food separate them from
[34:56] the love of God now he did have a mind
[34:58] battle he's like God God don't even care
[34:59] about us I said I said no sir God does
[35:01] care about you I said but God has to
[35:03] have a Victors who overcome family
[35:06] just like God have to ask Victors who
[35:07] overcome riches or uh
[35:10] surfeiting like the Bible says
[35:12] drunkenness and overeating and the days
[35:15] of Noah God has got to have somebody who
[35:16] can overcome The Temptations of the days
[35:18] of Noah that's right
[35:22] so none of these will inherit the
[35:24] kingdom of God and look such were some
[35:26] of you in other words we were some of us
[35:28] were married to those husbands before
[35:32] but instead we're not married to them
[35:34] anymore now that husband's dead now
[35:36] you're washed now you're Sanctified now
[35:39] you're justified in the name of the Lord
[35:42] Jesus and by the spirit of our God the
[35:44] church said
[35:45] there's some pretty powerful words in
[35:46] there church
[35:47] wash Sanctified justified in the name of
[35:51] Jesus praise God
[35:53] powerful words this is what separates us
[35:56] from our former life this is what
[35:58] separates us from our past this is what
[36:00] separates us from all of those grains of
[36:02] sins that we had all those all those
[36:05] Witnesses against us this is what
[36:06] separates us Jesus separates us praise
[36:09] God
[36:10] Jesus does amen he washes us he
[36:13] sanctifies us he justifies us amen he
[36:16] declares us righteous as we hope to be
[36:18] praise God
[36:19] oh it's beautiful
[36:21] here's the word sanctifying us I always
[36:23] forget brother Branham always says that
[36:25] he says sanctify means cleaned out and
[36:27] set aside for service right that's a
[36:29] good definition
[36:30] this means separated from Pro profane
[36:33] things and dedicated to God
[36:35] so brother Ram's layman's terms are
[36:37] really good it's an easy way separated
[36:40] and dedicated unto God
[36:43] okay so when God sanctifies you he
[36:45] separates you
[36:47] from your uh from your habits right man
[36:49] that's what around labor is on in the
[36:51] future home sermon three works of Grace
[36:53] he saves you and then he sanctifies you
[36:56] he changed your old habits gets rid of
[36:58] all your old habits and then he fills
[37:00] you with the Holy Ghost praise God
[37:03] but he's got to separate you first he's
[37:05] got to purify your cup first
[37:09] all right
[37:11] think about that church how many church
[37:12] members do you know that still
[37:14] enjoy profane things cussing and
[37:16] swearing and dirty shows and
[37:18] Super Bowl parties and Super Bowl
[37:20] halftime shows and wickedness like that
[37:23] have they separated themselves from
[37:25] profane things no they haven't but thank
[37:27] God God called you to a higher walk
[37:29] praise God
[37:31] thank God church that you're called
[37:34] to hire things than that that you're
[37:36] pressing towards the mark of the high
[37:38] calling in God
[37:40] some people look at it as a burden well
[37:41] I've got to live such a high life we
[37:43] should look at it as a blessing
[37:45] I'm glad I don't have to live a low life
[37:47] amen I'm glad I'm called to the high
[37:49] life amen amen the High Calling of God
[37:52] in Christ Jesus
[37:54] a lot of churches most churches don't
[37:55] even separate from profane things
[37:58] they enjoy filthy things and simple
[38:01] things but God has called us to
[38:03] something greater praise God
[38:05] he's taught us to be sanctified
[38:07] amen
[38:11] now here's the last use of the Greek
[38:13] word I didn't go through all 36
[38:14] Justified I try to pull out the ones I
[38:16] thought might help us the most
[38:18] this is the last Justified to also can
[38:20] mean the word righteous now this is
[38:21] speaking of the Rapture at the time of
[38:23] the Rapture the Gentile bride whatever
[38:24] you are that's what you say
[38:27] right because God leaves the Gentiles he
[38:29] goes to the Jews
[38:30] so he that's unjustice unjust still he
[38:32] that's filthy filthy still he that's
[38:33] righteous let him be righteous so he
[38:35] that's holy unto me holy still that's a
[38:37] good that's actually a good verse there
[38:38] for the foolish virgin
[38:40] they are Justified they're declared
[38:41] righteous but they're not fully
[38:43] sanctified
[38:44] right they're not fully sanctified
[38:48] the member Church in heaven will always
[38:50] remember being saved from our sins in
[38:52] order to magnify Christ I use these
[38:53] scriptures last year we preached on
[38:55] doctrine of devils series to show that
[38:57] for all eternity we're not going to be
[38:59] saying thank god sister who you never
[39:01] did in the first place thank God Malachi
[39:02] never sinned in the first we're not
[39:03] going to be going along like that we're
[39:05] going to be thanking Jesus for salvation
[39:07] oh man praise God Amen we're going to
[39:10] spend our time remembering what Jesus
[39:13] did to forgive our sins praise God
[39:17] we're not going to rock around like oh
[39:18] yeah you never did it yeah David you
[39:20] never did that in the first place Moses
[39:21] you never did that in the first place
[39:23] we're actually not going to be talking
[39:25] like that we're going to be worshiping
[39:27] God because of his salvation
[39:29] how many believe that by God's grace let
[39:31] me prove it to if you eat a refresher
[39:33] you might I needed one I always need a
[39:34] refresher praise God and when Jesus had
[39:37] taken the book The Four beasts and Four
[39:39] and Twenty elders
[39:40] fell down before the lamb having every
[39:42] one of them Harps and golden vows full
[39:44] of odors which are the prayers of the
[39:46] Saints and they sung a new song Imagine
[39:48] a new song in heaven
[39:50] Hallelujah and the new song is Thou Art
[39:54] Worthy to take the book and to open the
[39:56] seals thereof now I believe this already
[39:57] happened I believe that already happened
[39:58] in heaven some people don't some people
[40:00] believe it's after the Rapture I believe
[40:02] it already happened I believe it
[40:03] happened around 1963. that's what I
[40:05] believe for that was slain and has
[40:08] redeemed us so these worshipers remember
[40:10] when Jesus was crucified
[40:13] nearly 2 000 years ago oh Church the
[40:16] blood will never lose its power amen the
[40:19] cross will never lose its appeal to us
[40:20] amen the cross will never get old the
[40:24] cross will always be an emblem of
[40:26] Victory praise God
[40:28] it'd always be new it'd always be fresh
[40:30] it'll always be fresh in our minds that
[40:33] this is what made us uh get here this
[40:35] paved the way that we could get here we
[40:37] couldn't get here without the cross amen
[40:39] amen
[40:40] Eddie now these Four and Twenty Elders
[40:44] of the 12 sons of Jacob The Twelve
[40:46] Apostles of Jesus Christ Peter's in
[40:48] there they're all saying he was slain
[40:50] and he redeemed us they're still
[40:52] focusing on the cross we'll be singing
[40:55] about the cross with new songs amen I
[40:58] don't know how you can get new songs
[40:58] after two thousand years but we're gonna
[41:00] get new songs praise God new songs about
[41:03] the cross
[41:04] oh like the Bible said that the song
[41:06] says the half has not been told
[41:08] is that right Church
[41:10] we still got new songs in heaven about
[41:12] the cross
[41:16] I'm convinced Church there's a lot I
[41:18] still don't yet see yes the mysteries of
[41:20] God are finished but let me say this
[41:22] there's a whole lot more that I don't
[41:23] see
[41:24] all the Bible defined Mysteries if the
[41:26] Bible calls a mystery that's finished
[41:28] but there's a lot more for me to
[41:29] understand
[41:31] remember for for ages God's going to be
[41:34] showing us his kindness or last
[41:37] Wednesday or last Sunday
[41:38] for ages to come God's going to show how
[41:40] he was kind to our lives
[41:43] then how he was kind of course to all
[41:44] the seven Church ages
[41:47] I'm going to show how kind he was
[41:48] now think of that he could have been
[41:50] harsh with us but God was kind to us
[41:55] may God give us a fresh appreciation for
[41:57] that tonight
[41:58] that God's going to show me how kind he
[42:00] was in my life
[42:03] she was so faithful
[42:04] he was so loving
[42:06] he was always right on time
[42:11] he's not going to show us how he wasn't
[42:13] fair
[42:14] God wasn't fair God's not going to be
[42:16] showing us that he's going to be showing
[42:17] us his kindness
[42:19] God is writing a story God is the author
[42:22] and finisher of our Lives praise God
[42:24] that's right
[42:26] how do you redeem us Church buy his
[42:28] blood
[42:29] out of every kindred
[42:31] out of every tongue people and Nation
[42:34] now think about that most Amish haven't
[42:36] even heard the message yet
[42:39] there's over 350 000 Amish and most of
[42:42] them have never had a chance that's just
[42:44] in America
[42:45] we got Canadian Amish we got Mexican
[42:48] Amish
[42:49] I was praying that today before service
[42:50] Lord give me Grace give us Grace to
[42:52] reach the Amish so they can hear the
[42:53] word of God because let's just say like
[42:55] that we're not going home until they
[42:56] hear it that's as far as I can see right
[42:59] Jesus has Terry for 2 000 years
[43:02] he's tarried for 2 000 years
[43:05] so may God send us may God help us may
[43:08] God send his word to these people that
[43:10] have never heard the word like we've
[43:12] heard the word praise God
[43:17] and he's made us unto our God Kings and
[43:21] Priests and we shall reign on the Earth
[43:24] he makes us King and Priests there
[43:26] because of how we act right here
[43:30] we've got to rule over sin now we've got
[43:33] to intercede now in prayer in fact one
[43:36] of the last chapter of Colossians says
[43:37] continue in prayer with Thanksgiving in
[43:40] other words don't stop praying keep
[43:42] praying
[43:44] don't stop praying that's what makes you
[43:46] a priest unto God
[43:48] don't stop ruling over addictions keep
[43:50] ruling over addictions keep all
[43:52] addictions under your feet church and
[43:54] the church said
[43:55] keep ruling over that proves you're
[43:58] worthy to reign in the millennium
[44:00] if you can get the victory right now
[44:02] how many are grateful Jesus gave you the
[44:04] victory praise God you just keep the
[44:06] victory by quoting the word I believe in
[44:07] the word love and Jesus amen
[44:09] Hallelujah crucifying the flesh right
[44:11] mortifying the uh the Deeds of the flesh
[44:14] the Bible says
[44:16] redeemed
[44:18] and remember there's that same word I
[44:19] preached it last time I was preached out
[44:21] Hosea when I preach this little topic
[44:23] here as though we never did in the first
[44:24] place
[44:25] Peter is saying I'm redeemed Peter's
[44:28] saying I was in the marketplace but I
[44:30] was brought out Peter
[44:33] John Hallelujah Matthew
[44:37] Luke of course Luke wasn't one of the 12
[44:39] but he was a saint
[44:41] they're all saying we were all in the
[44:43] marketplace we were all sold as slaves
[44:46] and sin but Jesus Paid the price and he
[44:49] bought us out of there praise God
[44:51] amen my Hallelujah this is my story this
[44:56] is my song praising My Savior all the
[44:58] days off because I was in the
[45:00] marketplace and Jesus Paid the price and
[45:02] now I'm out praise God
[45:04] ah what a song to say
[45:09] Hallelujah
[45:12] once was lost but now I'm found I once
[45:14] was in the marketplace but now I'm
[45:15] purchased
[45:17] praise God I once was for sale but now
[45:19] I'm purchased praise God
[45:21] Hallelujah
[45:24] this is what they're saying this they're
[45:25] singing this in heaven to Jesus you
[45:27] redeemed Us by your blood you brought us
[45:30] out of the market
[45:32] you've saved us from a life of bondage
[45:35] amen
[45:37] later on in the same chapter and be held
[45:39] I heard the voice of many angels right
[45:41] about the throne and the beasts and the
[45:42] elders and the number of them was Ten
[45:44] Thousand Times Ten Thousand and
[45:47] thousands of thousands that's quite a
[45:49] choir there
[45:51] that's quite an Angelic choir and what
[45:54] are they all saying
[45:56] praise God we never sin in the first
[45:58] place is that what they're saying
[46:00] no now it's true part of them never did
[46:03] especially the Angels they never said in
[46:04] the first place
[46:05] but they're joining
[46:07] they're joining the the song of these
[46:09] redeemed they're saying Worthy is the
[46:12] Lamb that was slain to receive power and
[46:14] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[46:16] and glory and blessing so all of Heaven
[46:20] calls Jesus worthy praise God
[46:23] all of Heaven even if they never send
[46:25] the first place those angels they're
[46:28] still saying he's where the appraised
[46:30] Jesus has done something the angels have
[46:32] never done praise God Amen Hallelujah
[46:35] Jesus has done so much he's worthy of
[46:38] all the praise praise God
[46:40] now fast forward to chapter seven
[46:43] now I believe this is the bride
[46:45] there are six quotes from Brother brand
[46:46] that says from Revelation 7 9 to verse
[46:49] 17 is the bride there's one quote that
[46:52] says they're foolish virgin I got a
[46:55] whole video on it if you want to like it
[46:56] or you want to watch it not like it you
[46:58] can like it if you want
[46:59] I hope you don't unlike it
[47:01] if not let's talk some scripture after
[47:03] service but the point was all the clues
[47:07] say it's the Bride of Jesus Christ
[47:10] because she's already washed in the
[47:12] blood ah and that's the thing about the
[47:15] foolish versions they're not fully
[47:17] washed in the blood
[47:18] they're not fully Sanctified they're not
[47:21] fully set apart for God's service
[47:25] they're lacking oil too
[47:27] now they're a virgin as far as they
[47:29] don't have any interaction with with
[47:30] devils
[47:31] and idolatry they don't have any Idols
[47:33] in their lives but they're lacking oil
[47:36] and they didn't take time to prepare the
[47:38] oil But Here We Are Tonight taking time
[47:41] to prepare oil praise God
[47:43] how many Christians are not in church
[47:44] tonight
[47:45] how many moms stayed at home because
[47:47] they worked today sister Naomi yeah you
[47:49] came to church
[47:51] is that right
[47:52] think about all the church members
[47:54] that are most most Christians don't even
[47:56] go to church on Wednesday night anymore
[47:58] the only group I know that does is the
[48:00] Kiwanis how do you say that Kiwanis
[48:02] Kiwanis
[48:04] there's a grouping copy they're called
[48:05] the Kiwanis they go on Wednesday night
[48:07] but it's just real short
[48:11] there's I think my mom I don't know if
[48:12] my mom Church does anymore Pentecost I
[48:14] don't know if they do Wednesday nights
[48:15] anymore
[48:16] I don't know but here we are why are we
[48:18] here tonight because we're preparing for
[48:20] the coming bridegroom
[48:22] I'm here making sure I'm ready so when I
[48:24] hear the voice behold the bridegroom
[48:26] cometh I leave this world and I go up to
[48:28] meet Jesus in the air because there's
[48:29] going to be a meeting in the air praise
[48:31] God I'm making ready tonight praise God
[48:34] Hallelujah
[48:36] could all be at home getting rest we
[48:38] could all be at home
[48:40] uh have an ice cream sandwich
[48:43] I did have one on Sunday night by the
[48:45] way but I haven't had one since Sunday
[48:46] night
[48:49] because I don't want to become a bad
[48:50] habit like my wife was telling me that's
[48:51] true I don't want to compromise I don't
[48:53] want to be a bad habit too much
[48:55] so I got to stay off it for a while now
[48:58] a while
[49:02] by God's grace
[49:03] but here we see this picture of the
[49:05] Bride it's a great multitude which no
[49:07] man can number of all Nations kindreds
[49:09] people tongues stood Before the Throne
[49:11] before the lamb clothed with white robes
[49:13] and Palms in their hands
[49:16] think about that sure some of us are
[49:17] going to be holding Palms in our hands
[49:19] in heaven
[49:20] I maybe won't maybe I won't have a harp
[49:22] like you melka you probably have a heart
[49:23] because you know you
[49:25] do that
[49:27] now can I be over there on the harp
[49:29] worshiping god with brother amen and
[49:31] Austin
[49:33] I'll just be in the Palm group
[49:36] oh yeah I like to wave my hands anyway
[49:37] Hallelujah
[49:40] and they're going to be shouting with
[49:42] not Whispers in heaven but loud voices
[49:45] ah hallelujah we're not gonna be
[49:48] whispering like well Jesus he's a pretty
[49:49] good savior
[49:51] he's all right no we're gonna be
[49:53] shouting
[49:54] salvation to our god which sits on the
[49:57] throne and unto the lamb praise God
[50:01] we're gonna be shouting to God and
[50:03] shouting to the lamb where we wave in
[50:04] branches praise God we're in a perfect
[50:06] white garments on praise God we're going
[50:08] to be worshiping God for his salvation
[50:11] hallelujah what does that salvation mean
[50:14] there's uh three definitions there
[50:17] it means you're delivered preserved you
[50:20] got safety
[50:21] you're delivered from the molestation of
[50:23] enemies no more devil praise God
[50:27] you have experienced Messianic salvation
[50:32] Christ salvation Messiah means Christ
[50:36] you have and you you you're saying
[50:39] salvation in other words you have the
[50:40] sum of the benefits and blessings which
[50:43] the Christians redeemed from all Earthly
[50:45] ills and joy
[50:47] you're saying salvation I have all the
[50:49] benefits I'm delivered and I have every
[50:52] benefit of a real born-again Christian
[50:54] praise God
[50:55] and lastly I you're saying I'm saved
[50:58] from the penalty and power and presence
[51:01] and pleasure of sin praise God
[51:03] hallelujah
[51:06] I'm saved from all the effects of sin
[51:08] and I've got all the benefits of being
[51:10] forgiven praise God
[51:12] see we're still we're not going to be
[51:14] shouting thank God I never did in the
[51:15] first place we'll be seeing thank God I
[51:17] did it but he forgave me praise God
[51:20] hallelujah where's brother Diggs when
[51:22] you need him amen
[51:23] he's coming in May by God's grace
[51:27] that's what we're gonna be now thank God
[51:29] our souls never did thank God but we're
[51:31] singing and praising God for delivering
[51:33] us from the wrongs that we did do praise
[51:35] God right
[51:37] maybe there will come a time when we'll
[51:38] never remember that anymore but I doubt
[51:41] it
[51:42] people can speculate all they want but I
[51:43] imagine we'll be singing about the cross
[51:45] I imagine we'll be getting new songs all
[51:46] the time sister
[51:48] oh here's another song about the wonders
[51:50] of the cross
[51:51] let me sing the version I wrote praise
[51:53] God
[51:53] well actually God wrote he said I
[51:56] couldn't I couldn't do anything without
[51:57] him right all inspiration has to come
[51:59] from God
[52:00] they're still singing about the cross
[52:02] two thousand years later
[52:06] and the angel says sir who are these and
[52:09] and John said thou knows Angel and he
[52:11] said these are they which came out of
[52:13] the Great Tribulation and have washed
[52:15] their robes and made them white in the
[52:16] lamb so see the foolish version they're
[52:18] not fully washed that's why they got to
[52:19] go through the tribulation
[52:21] not fully washed and these are not Jews
[52:23] Jews are earlier in the chapter verses
[52:25] one to eight hundred forty four thousand
[52:26] see what the Holy Ghost
[52:29] what does wash mean Saints it means you
[52:31] got new clothes
[52:35] you have appropriated the results of
[52:37] Christ's Redemption as regarded by God
[52:40] and your pure and sinless
[52:43] your wash and God sees you as pure and
[52:46] sinless Hallelujah
[52:49] the voice says these are all these
[52:51] Gentiles that are pure and sinless by
[52:54] the work of Christ's sacrifice
[52:57] oh my hallelujah praise God
[53:02] I'm not going to go over that time I'm
[53:03] gonna try to finish up here I never set
[53:05] a timer so I'm not sure where we're at
[53:06] on time
[53:08] where I'm at occasion how much time
[53:10] hour really oh so that clock's broke God
[53:13] I've only been preaching 30 minutes
[53:18] brother makes it clear that and the
[53:20] Bible makes it clear Grace will never
[53:22] fail us as long as we never fail Grace
[53:26] in other words as long as we never
[53:27] Retreat From Grace
[53:29] and stomp it under our foot and walk
[53:31] away Grace is always going to be for us
[53:34] we're always going to have it the only
[53:36] way to lose Grace is to trample
[53:38] underfoot and run away from it
[53:41] walk away from it
[53:42] that's the only way we can use it or
[53:44] lose it
[53:46] praise God
[53:47] to church if you're planning on being in
[53:49] the house of God the rest of your life
[53:50] you're going to be under grace
[53:52] you're going to have a washed white robe
[53:56] you're gonna have the righteousness of
[53:57] Christ throughout all eternity
[54:00] oh my amen I don't have any plans on
[54:03] going anywhere I want to just draw
[54:04] closer to Jesus all the time Hallelujah
[54:09] right that's what the Bible says the
[54:10] Bible said follow peace with all men see
[54:12] try to have peace in your relationships
[54:13] and your family and your workers
[54:14] co-workers
[54:16] and Holiness without which no man shall
[54:18] see the Lord there's that sanctification
[54:20] you got to be separate from the things
[54:21] of the world
[54:24] looking diligently so look diligently
[54:26] this that you have peace with people and
[54:28] you're living a holy life
[54:30] lest any man will fail the grace of God
[54:35] see lest any root of bitterness that's
[54:36] why the Bible says husbands don't be
[54:38] bitter against your wives
[54:40] remember God says in Malachi that God is
[54:42] the witness between husbands and wives
[54:44] let's read it right now since I'm on it
[54:46] here I've only preached an hour
[54:49] I could probably preach a whole another
[54:50] hour if I you know everybody says amen
[54:55] can I have a little more time Church
[54:58] Maybe
[55:01] maybe brother Malachi chapter I think
[55:04] it's
[55:06] two yeah chapter two
[55:12] yeah verse 14. Malachi 2 14. not Church
[55:15] remember that the Holy Ghost is watching
[55:16] in your house how you treat your husband
[55:18] and wife
[55:19] how you treat your children
[55:21] the Holy Ghost is watching
[55:23] and he's another witness for you or
[55:25] witness against you
[55:27] a church we all how many believe you're
[55:29] saved here
[55:30] let's live a life let's make sure we
[55:32] continue living a life where the Holy
[55:34] Ghost is for us
[55:35] he's going to be a witness for us that
[55:37] we showed Grace and love
[55:39] that our sisters as we said submitted to
[55:41] our husbands in the Lord
[55:43] and that our husbands loved our wives
[55:45] and we were not bitter against them
[55:48] Hallelujah because God's watching
[55:50] God's watching verse 14.
[55:54] yet you say wherefore because the Lord
[55:56] had been witness between thee and the
[55:58] wife of thy youth against whom thou Hast
[56:00] dealt treacherously yet is she thy
[56:03] companion and the wife of thy Covenant
[56:07] here's you know why you know why a man
[56:09] would treat his wife like that because
[56:10] he's got an evil spirit on him that's
[56:12] this or same thing if we mistreat our
[56:14] husbands got an evil spirit we've got to
[56:15] confess it if we do it
[56:17] same things Brothers we just got to
[56:18] confess our evil spirits verse 15 and
[56:21] did not he make one see
[56:23] husband wife one Spirit one flesh yet he
[56:26] had the residue of the spirit and
[56:28] wherefore one that he might seek a Godly
[56:30] seed therefore take heed to your spirit
[56:33] and let none deal treacherously against
[56:36] the wife of his youth
[56:38] yeah let's read verse 16 for the Lord
[56:40] the god of Israel said that he hateth
[56:42] putting away
[56:44] for one covereth violence With His
[56:46] Garment saith the Lord of hosts
[56:49] therefore take heed to your spirit that
[56:51] you deal not treacherously
[56:53] so in other words church just try to be
[56:54] fair with your husband or wife
[56:57] try to be fair because God's watching
[57:00] God's watching you're going to reap what
[57:01] you sow
[57:02] if you sow Mercy you're going to reap
[57:04] Mercy
[57:06] that's what I want to be known for as a
[57:08] brother of Mercy you know why because
[57:10] God's showed me a lot of Mercy
[57:14] I know the kind of life I live in the
[57:15] good but I also know the bad I do
[57:18] and I'm trusting in the same scriptures
[57:20] I read tonight I'm trusting in those
[57:21] same scriptures for me
[57:23] that I'm Justified
[57:25] that Jesus sisters are actually declares
[57:27] me righteous as I want to be
[57:29] and you don't hold my sins against me
[57:31] amen hallelujah because I could have a
[57:34] whole handful of all the years I've been
[57:35] alive now serving God to over the
[57:36] serving God 23 years now I get a lot of
[57:39] handfuls of sins in there but the but
[57:41] the love of God covers a multitude of my
[57:43] sin
[57:44] and now I'm Justified as I'd like to be
[57:48] I want the love of God like a flood to
[57:50] cover over all my sins
[57:52] so you don't even see my sin anymore all
[57:54] you see is God's love
[57:56] hallelujah praise God this I want God to
[57:59] see the waters amen I just want the
[58:01] waters to be seen not all my sins not
[58:02] the sand of my sins
[58:06] now here's the kind of people that fall
[58:07] away like a fornicator someone who won't
[58:09] get married right okay or an adulterer
[58:12] we say the same thing
[58:13] or any profane person like Esau remember
[58:16] Esau said I'm not going to marry a
[58:17] believer I'm going to purposely go
[58:18] against my mom and dad that's what that
[58:20] was his attitude
[58:22] who for one more Soul a meat sold his
[58:24] Birthright
[58:25] now like that's people that leave the
[58:27] the Bible leave the message leave Christ
[58:29] they sell out Christ for whatever
[58:34] that's the kind of people that fail the
[58:36] grace of God they leave Christ they
[58:39] leave the word of God for some worldly
[58:41] pleasures
[58:42] sometimes it's not even for pleasure
[58:44] sometimes it's just for bitterness
[58:46] they're just upset with the pastor
[58:48] Pastor the deacons are the upset with
[58:50] the song leader why don't they come and
[58:52] talk about it by God's grace
[58:54] instead of letting bitterness grow up
[58:55] like a root inside of them see we ought
[58:57] to let the Holy Ghost grow up inside of
[58:59] us and not the root of bitterness
[59:01] let God's spirit grow let God's spirit
[59:03] become more powerful feed God's spirit
[59:05] don't feed bitterness feed the Holy
[59:07] Spirit praise God
[59:09] but this is what this is what the laws
[59:11] do they feed evil spirits instead of
[59:14] feeding the spirit of God
[59:17] there you go but you're here tonight to
[59:19] feed on God's word
[59:21] I got to give it to warning because
[59:22] there are some people that listen praise
[59:24] God
[59:24] and I want everybody to you know I want
[59:27] everybody to always have a warning
[59:28] church we all need warnings because
[59:29] we're all we all find ourselves in
[59:31] different spot spots right sometimes
[59:32] we're right in the midst of the
[59:33] Temptation sometimes we just come out
[59:35] and we're feeling all good sometimes
[59:36] we're coming right up to the door of a
[59:38] temptation
[59:40] oh I feel something coming on I feel
[59:41] this is
[59:42] going through difficult times difficult
[59:44] times on the way
[59:47] so we got to give warnings Church
[59:48] remember Jesus said remember Lot's wife
[59:52] right he didn't say remember Abraham did
[59:55] he I heard a preachers out there that's
[59:57] pretty good thought
[59:58] he said remember Lot's wife the one who
[1:00:00] almost made it out
[1:00:04] in other words remember Judas is scared
[1:00:06] he almost made it out
[1:00:09] see from time to time we need warnings
[1:00:11] from time to time we need remembrances
[1:00:13] don't fall back don't let bitterness go
[1:00:15] up in your heart
[1:00:16] don't deal treacherously with your
[1:00:18] husband or your wife
[1:00:19] don't do that
[1:00:21] remember you serve a god of Grace and
[1:00:23] you have access into that Grace amen
[1:00:26] Hallelujah
[1:00:30] you know I had these thoughts months ago
[1:00:32] and I I just didn't preach him I was
[1:00:34] looking through my sermon thoughts say
[1:00:35] what should I preach today what would
[1:00:36] the Lord have me Preach Today and I
[1:00:38] found these thoughts I'm like I like to
[1:00:39] bring these out today
[1:00:41] Abraham failed in Egypt remember he lied
[1:00:44] about Sarah and he let Pharaoh take his
[1:00:45] wife then in uh in the Philistine Camp
[1:00:48] he let abimelech take Sarah twice he
[1:00:51] lied about Sarah
[1:00:53] and both times God made Abraham look
[1:00:56] good
[1:00:59] Pharaoh had to repent to Abraham
[1:01:02] and abimelech had to repent to Abraham
[1:01:07] and it was Abraham's fault Church
[1:01:11] now how could that be it's only because
[1:01:13] God was looking at the whole testimony
[1:01:17] of Abraham's life overall Abraham was
[1:01:19] living better lives than them
[1:01:21] because the Bible said Abraham was
[1:01:24] faithful in all of his house
[1:01:26] but in Abraham's couple moments of
[1:01:28] weakness he failed but yet God still
[1:01:30] showed him favor because he was the real
[1:01:33] believer praise God
[1:01:35] he was the more dedicated believer over
[1:01:37] the whole span of his life he's a higher
[1:01:39] quality believer over the whole span of
[1:01:41] his life so God gave him favor even when
[1:01:44] he sinned praise God ah Church God's
[1:01:47] Gonna favor you and I even in our sins
[1:01:49] Hallelujah
[1:01:52] that's right
[1:01:53] in other words God won't give us what we
[1:01:55] deserve
[1:01:59] Hallelujah did Abraham get what he
[1:02:01] deserved no
[1:02:02] for lying about his wife and brother
[1:02:04] called him a coward and all these things
[1:02:05] he didn't get what he deserved
[1:02:08] he got Grace
[1:02:10] thank God Amen
[1:02:12] God wants to give you Grace tonight
[1:02:14] Church
[1:02:19] Peter look at Peter he had all those
[1:02:22] mistakes what'd Jesus do Jesus come
[1:02:23] right to him and said Do You Love Me
[1:02:25] Peter
[1:02:27] he said I'm not getting rid of you Peter
[1:02:28] he said do you love me keep preaching
[1:02:31] feed my sheep
[1:02:33] right
[1:02:34] well Jesse makes mistakes and I say Lord
[1:02:36] forgive me and Jesus would say keep
[1:02:38] reaching son
[1:02:40] keep preaching
[1:02:42] keep preaching the word of God
[1:02:43] even in Abraham's mistakes God made him
[1:02:46] the victor
[1:02:48] because he's more than a conqueror amen
[1:02:50] hallelujah praise God
[1:02:53] who shall lay any charge to God's elect
[1:02:55] oh my
[1:03:00] Hallelujah I thought I thought you liked
[1:03:02] that one by God's grace
[1:03:03] yeah
[1:03:05] Elias was a man subject to like passions
[1:03:07] as we are passions this case is not
[1:03:09] sexual passions or anything like that
[1:03:11] it's just suffering it's the passion of
[1:03:13] suffering
[1:03:15] and the the children heard A good sermon
[1:03:17] on Elijah right on Sunday night that's a
[1:03:18] good message
[1:03:20] he suffered right
[1:03:23] he had to be all by himself out there in
[1:03:25] the wilderness a number of times he he
[1:03:26] had death threats on his life and I like
[1:03:28] the illustration he gave it's like
[1:03:30] Elijah went into prayer request and he
[1:03:32] said look he said I'm going to turn my
[1:03:33] prayer prayer request in tonight and the
[1:03:36] prayer request says Lord can you let me
[1:03:38] die
[1:03:40] now I don't think any of you would ever
[1:03:41] put a prayer request in for that
[1:03:43] uh brother Jesse yeah please pray that
[1:03:45] I'll die
[1:03:47] Oh you mean die to sin
[1:03:49] yeah and be born again okay yeah
[1:03:52] right but Elijah was so discouraged he
[1:03:56] was suffering so much he put a prayer
[1:03:57] request and said father can I go home
[1:04:04] not a funeral for me
[1:04:06] not church that's pretty low
[1:04:09] I've never been that low
[1:04:11] I think that's only by God's grace I'm
[1:04:13] not I'm not bragging like I always say
[1:04:16] they're way more man than I am I just
[1:04:18] have more access to the Holy Ghost they
[1:04:19] didn't have it but they're more than a
[1:04:21] man than me
[1:04:23] but this is the suffering
[1:04:25] and look even though I had all these
[1:04:26] passions look he just prayed earnestly
[1:04:28] Church let's keep praying earnestly
[1:04:31] let's pray earnestly for our hearts
[1:04:32] desires let's not give up on God we've
[1:04:35] all got suffering we're all going to go
[1:04:36] through trials but God's going to give
[1:04:38] us favor in the end praise God because
[1:04:40] we are faithful we're the faithful ones
[1:04:43] praise God most church members aren't in
[1:04:44] church tonight they're not praying
[1:04:46] they're not reading their Bibles they're
[1:04:47] not worshiping but we are because we're
[1:04:49] the elect praise God
[1:04:51] we're the elect
[1:04:52] we're the wise virgins we're not foolish
[1:04:55] we know it's coming
[1:04:57] we know the destruction is coming but we
[1:04:58] also know the good thing the Raptors
[1:05:00] come and praise God Amen
[1:05:04] Hallelujah
[1:05:07] I'll be really watching the prayer
[1:05:08] requests the next few services
[1:05:11] I'm gonna have to talk to some of us
[1:05:12] about it let's have hope praise God
[1:05:15] I don't do any funerals anytime soon
[1:05:19] I mean you just want to die to yourself
[1:05:21] okay I'll pray the prayer that you can
[1:05:22] mortify your your lusts and your Deeds
[1:05:27] what kind of man was Abraham normally
[1:05:28] God said I know this is the kind of man
[1:05:31] Abraham is I'll not hide anything from
[1:05:33] him
[1:05:34] because he's become a great man a mighty
[1:05:37] nation I know Abraham's character He
[1:05:39] commands his children and his household
[1:05:41] to keep the way of God Amen
[1:05:45] he stumbles along the way praise God
[1:05:47] and even in his stumbles God
[1:05:52] God made them repent to him praise God
[1:05:56] Glory
[1:05:59] and Abraham was a man normally he was of
[1:06:01] justice and judgment he wasn't in those
[1:06:03] two cases with pharaoh and abiblic but
[1:06:05] in most cases he was a man of justice
[1:06:07] and judgment
[1:06:13] job spoke against God
[1:06:15] he gave himself more righteousness now
[1:06:18] talk about a talk about a legalists here
[1:06:20] I think maybe job was on that side there
[1:06:22] he was more the legalist type
[1:06:26] he thought he was more righteous than
[1:06:28] God
[1:06:30] has anybody ever thought that here don't
[1:06:31] raise your hand over
[1:06:33] you thought you're more holy and your
[1:06:35] plans are better than God's now nobody
[1:06:37] would ever think that here
[1:06:38] right nobody nobody would say well Lord
[1:06:41] you know I think I should have it would
[1:06:43] have worked better if it would have went
[1:06:44] like this
[1:06:45] no nobody would say that here right of
[1:06:48] course not
[1:06:50] nobody would say that
[1:06:53] we can all rejoice in our sufferings
[1:06:57] but look Church even after that God
[1:06:58] honored him and the three friends had to
[1:07:01] repent and pray for him
[1:07:03] and go to him for prayer job had to pray
[1:07:05] for them
[1:07:09] I think that was because really because
[1:07:12] Eli Eli who rebuked job I think job got
[1:07:15] rebuked at the end
[1:07:17] I don't think job sinned against the
[1:07:19] three friends
[1:07:21] they must have been attacking him if
[1:07:22] they had to repent to job they must have
[1:07:24] been an attacking joke
[1:07:25] but job did get reviewed by ilahu and
[1:07:28] also by God
[1:07:30] so he got in other words job had said I
[1:07:32] repent and dust and Ashes he had
[1:07:33] repented
[1:07:34] right
[1:07:36] and remember job was more righteous in
[1:07:38] other words job was just like Abraham
[1:07:39] the on the whole of his life the
[1:07:41] majority of his life he was way more
[1:07:43] faithful than those three guys
[1:07:44] the Bible said everybody wanted to come
[1:07:46] here the wisdom of job they come down
[1:07:48] and sit and say preach a preacher well I
[1:07:50] really like to hear that let me take
[1:07:51] some good notes I got questions and
[1:07:53] answers for you
[1:07:56] they just did not they didn't they
[1:07:57] didn't just didn't see wisdom like jobs
[1:08:00] but then he got in a spot where he only
[1:08:01] had fear
[1:08:03] he was self-righteous
[1:08:05] even in his trials God honored job
[1:08:08] church God will honor you even in your
[1:08:10] trials how do you believe that
[1:08:12] how many have seen that I've seen it in
[1:08:14] my life
[1:08:15] God honored me even when I've fallen
[1:08:17] short of God's glory
[1:08:19] he still honors this church
[1:08:21] because we're his children
[1:08:23] he sees the Integrity of our hearts
[1:08:25] amen
[1:08:27] so you've honored his word church you've
[1:08:30] honored his word
[1:08:32] I'm almost done here let me see am I
[1:08:33] almost done
[1:08:37] yeah
[1:08:39] how many believe

[1:11:06] heard this message I knew this was right
[1:11:09] I just knew it
[1:11:12] was one night I struggled with it you
[1:11:13] know but I got right back on the next
[1:11:15] morning when Craig called me that's part
[1:11:16] of my testimony just one night I
[1:11:18] struggled with it everything every other
[1:11:19] night I'm in it by God's grace
[1:11:23] and my father which gave them me is
[1:11:25] greater than all and no man is able to
[1:11:27] pluck them out of my father's hand
[1:11:28] Church look how secure you are
[1:11:31] the devil can't rip you out of God's
[1:11:33] hand
[1:11:34] right you can't rip you out there's no
[1:11:36] man there's no family member nobody can
[1:11:38] rip you out of the hand of God you're in
[1:11:40] the hand of Christ you're in the hand of
[1:11:42] Heaven's King Hallelujah
[1:11:45] Hallelujah
[1:11:47] you're you're in the hand of the one the
[1:11:49] Angels Sing About praise God
[1:11:52] you're in the hand of the one where
[1:11:54] millions of angels and the four beasts
[1:11:56] and the 24 Elders they all worship and
[1:11:58] sing and say Worthy is the Lamb you're
[1:12:02] in the Lamb's hand praise God
[1:12:04] Hallelujah
[1:12:07] and what's the proof of that you heard
[1:12:08] the word and you believed it
[1:12:11] Glory
[1:12:14] why it was put in there by
[1:12:16] predestination
[1:12:18] you were ordained to a Son of God you
[1:12:21] were in God before the foundation of the
[1:12:23] world you're only manifested in this day
[1:12:25] for his glory and honor
[1:12:27] a church how can you do it without
[1:12:28] honoring his word and stand with every
[1:12:31] word of God
[1:12:32] see the fact you stand with this message
[1:12:34] it shows you're a child of God
[1:12:37] right you can't honor Christ and then
[1:12:40] dishonor his word
[1:12:42] that's why there's so many foolish
[1:12:43] versions that's why there's so many lost
[1:12:45] they won't even honor the word of God
[1:12:48] but what's different about you you honor
[1:12:50] the word because you've been washed by
[1:12:52] the word because you were chosen by the
[1:12:54] word because you have a portion of the
[1:12:56] word in your soul praise God let's stand
[1:12:59] up our feet
[1:13:00] yes sir which you're a part of that word
[1:13:03] see you're not you're not the full word
[1:13:04] musician's Gonna Come
[1:13:05] you're not the forward only Jesus is the
[1:13:08] full word
[1:13:10] you're a part of the word
[1:13:14] because look the word God is the word
[1:13:16] you believe that
[1:13:17] and and the congregation says
[1:13:20] Glory well then if he always was the
[1:13:23] word in the beginning was the word and
[1:13:24] if the Word was God then you were in God
[1:13:28] the word the part that you're to play
[1:13:30] now here's where we get a little trouble
[1:13:32] we want to tell God what part we want to
[1:13:34] play
[1:13:34] or we think we know what part we're
[1:13:36] supposed to play God knows what part
[1:13:38] we're supposed to play
[1:13:41] if we've heard this word we honor it we
[1:13:44] believe it we act upon it but we've got
[1:13:46] to accept God's part for us to play
[1:13:51] Abraham's part included a few missteps
[1:13:53] there right
[1:13:55] he missed that by lying not once about
[1:13:57] his wife twice about it
[1:14:00] right job had a misstep there he got
[1:14:03] fearful and then he got prideful
[1:14:05] self-righteous
[1:14:08] Church none of us want the none of us
[1:14:10] will really want the part of job don't
[1:14:12] raise your hand but who wants the part
[1:14:13] of job who wants to lose all their money
[1:14:14] and all their family I don't want that
[1:14:17] but he had to be willing to play that
[1:14:19] part a church if he can play that part
[1:14:21] how many can say Lord I'll play my part
[1:14:23] that you have planned for me that's the
[1:14:25] one you should raise your hand for
[1:14:26] praise God whatever part God has for you
[1:14:29] we got to be willing to play it tonight
[1:14:31] by God's grace
[1:14:33] amen
[1:14:36] see the part you was was in God before
[1:14:38] the foundation world he seen you
[1:14:41] he knew you
[1:14:42] he predestinated you to it
[1:14:46] how many know that God saw you praise
[1:14:48] God
[1:14:49] how many believe God knows you
[1:14:52] amen praise God let's bow our heads up
[1:14:53] I'll stop right there I had old I was
[1:14:55] going to go a little bit further with
[1:14:56] that but I'll stop right there
[1:14:58] I might say that for the Amish people I
[1:15:00] wonder I want to make a list of all the
[1:15:02] differences between our church and
[1:15:03] denominations I imagine I think I was up
[1:15:06] to 36 at one point but I'm the ram said
[1:15:08] there's hundreds so there's probably
[1:15:09] hundreds think of all the differences
[1:15:11] between
[1:15:14] and our church
[1:15:16] says about our heads here and how many
[1:15:17] thankful that you're Justified tonight
[1:15:21] if you have faith in the blood the Bible
[1:15:22] says you're Justified
[1:15:24] your declared righteous as you wish to
[1:15:27] be that means you don't have to worry
[1:15:28] about well Jesse you got to pay for this
[1:15:30] sin when all you got to suffer for no no
[1:15:32] there's no there's no pain Jesus already
[1:15:34] paid the price
[1:15:37] your soul never sinned in the first
[1:15:39] place
[1:15:41] but we're going to go through our
[1:15:42] eternity thanking God
[1:15:44] that he forgave the sins that we did
[1:15:47] convince in our
[1:15:50] in our we're going to be shouting we're
[1:15:53] say you're worthy of the Norwegian
[1:15:55] you know them
[1:15:57] verses for that you know how to sing
[1:15:58] them
[1:16:01] you're worthy of it all
