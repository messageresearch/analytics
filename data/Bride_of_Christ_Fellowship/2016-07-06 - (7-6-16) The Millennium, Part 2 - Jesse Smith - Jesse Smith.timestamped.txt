[39:08] let's open up if we can uh back to
[39:11] Revelation chapter 20 let's start there
[39:13] by the grace of the Lord because i' like
[39:15] to end there Lord willing at the end of
[39:17] the message here Revelation chapter
[39:21] 20 appreciate all the saints pressing
[39:23] the W to the house of God tonight amen
[39:25] all the sacrific that been made praise
[39:28] God whenever we come expecting God never
[39:31] fails to fulfill our desires praise the
[39:34] Lord I never left a service where God
[39:35] didn't bless me
[39:37] somehow whether through correction or
[39:40] strength or healing or something he's
[39:41] always blessed each and every one of us
[39:44] somehow thank God for that Revelation
[39:46] chapter 20 verse
[39:48] [Music]
[39:55] one like to if we can read through
[39:59] verses 1 through six a very important
[40:04] text and then later you know we'll be
[40:06] looking at verses 7 through uh 7 through
[40:11] 10 but this just for the text I want to
[40:13] read 1 to six kind of getting in of
[40:15] course into future things prophetic
[40:17] things and so forth like that so we just
[40:20] do the best we can to stay with the
[40:22] word and brother's teaching on this
[40:25] topic the
[40:28] verse one Revelation 20 verse1 if you're
[40:30] there say
[40:31] amen and I saw an angel come down from
[40:33] heaven having the key of the balus pit
[40:36] and a great chain in his hand and he
[40:38] laid hold on the dragon that old serpent
[40:41] which is the devil and Satan and bound
[40:43] him a thousand years now look he's
[40:45] called a dragon serpent devil Satan does
[40:47] that mean he's four persons no he just
[40:49] got four different titles there right
[40:52] his actual name is Lucifer but he's got
[40:54] all those different titles verse three
[40:57] and cast him into the bottomless pit and
[40:59] shut him up and set a seal upon him that
[41:02] he should deceive the Nations no more so
[41:05] the Thousand Years should be fulfilled
[41:07] and after that he must be loosed a
[41:09] little
[41:11] season remember the Bible said the mark
[41:13] of the beast would be received by All
[41:15] Nations that includes China the US
[41:18] Australia you name all nations will take
[41:20] the mark of the
[41:21] beast verse
[41:23] four and I saw Thrones and they sat upon
[41:26] them and judgment was given unto them so
[41:29] not him but them and I saw the souls of
[41:33] them that were beheaded for the witness
[41:35] of Jesus and for the word of God these
[41:38] are Christians that believe the New
[41:40] Testament and the Old Testament right
[41:42] because brother B taught that the word
[41:43] of God is the Old Testament and the
[41:45] testimony Jesus was the New Testament
[41:47] being a
[41:48] Christian finishing verse four and which
[41:51] had not worshiped the Beast neither his
[41:54] image neither had received his mark
[41:56] upon their foreheads or in their hands
[41:59] and they lived and reigned with Christ a
[42:01] thousand years but the rest of the Dead
[42:04] live not again until the thousand years
[42:06] were finished this is the first
[42:09] resurrection lesson is Holy is he that
[42:12] hath part in the First Resurrection on
[42:14] such the second death hath no power but
[42:17] they should be Priests of God and of
[42:18] Christ and shall reign with him Thousand
[42:21] Years amen we would be blessed and holy
[42:24] to be part of that first resurrection
[42:26] let's bow our heads if you have a need
[42:27] on your heart just make it known unto
[42:28] God as we pray before we enter into this
[42:31] time Heavenly Father we love you Lord so
[42:33] much the scripture says blessed are they
[42:36] who hunger and thirst for righteousness
[42:38] I believe the Saints here tonight have
[42:40] come not to see a man or a woman or
[42:42] anything Lord but to see you they hunger
[42:44] and thirst for the righteousness of
[42:46] Jesus Christ Lord may you grant that to
[42:49] each of us I'm Desiring that I'm hungry
[42:51] and thirsting for more knowledge of the
[42:53] holy word of God more spiritual strength
[42:56] oh God more Revelation more power in my
[42:59] life Lord to overcome Temptations and
[43:01] sin and wickedness in the world and
[43:03] Satan oh God we know it's possible we
[43:06] know it'll be received tonight as we
[43:08] worship and believe so father take this
[43:10] word break it to us oh God that we can
[43:13] understand it Lord and prepare us for
[43:16] that great Millennial time that we could
[43:18] be a part of it we would be the bless we
[43:19] would be the holy we'd be Lord such
[43:22] character that you could commit Judgment
[43:24] of Nations unto us Lord a rulership of
[43:27] Nations unto us Believers Lord we feel
[43:30] so inadequate but Lord but all things
[43:32] are possible by your spirit as we say
[43:35] not by our might or by our power but by
[43:38] your spirit sayeth the Lord all these
[43:40] things are possible so help us in the
[43:42] midst of Leia and Satan's Eden help us
[43:45] oh God to have a a Christian Eden here
[43:47] tonight Lord a holy atmosphere holy love
[43:50] for you we ask it all in Jesus Christ's

[44:31] by God's
[44:34] grace as we said you know we spend a lot
[44:36] of time here uh trying to just stay with
[44:40] the message say what brother Bram said
[44:41] say what the scriptures say that's our
[44:43] desire tonight just keep doing that uh
[44:46] and being as faithful as we can to the
[44:48] word of the Lord and uh getting the
[44:51] victory praise God we'll be certainly
[44:53] Victors if we're a part of this
[44:55] millennium amen certainly be some Victor
[44:58] so let me pull this up here by God's
[45:01] grace that
[45:06] on so we'll look at a quick review of
[45:09] part one and uh hope everybody enjoyed
[45:12] that by God's grace on Sunday
[45:19] night then we'll go a little bit further
[45:21] here I'm sorry
[45:24] Mercy the one two many times okay so we
[45:28] like to continue on this thought
[45:32] here so we'll look here and
[45:35] uh there we
[45:38] go so I'm just going to quickly go
[45:40] through this we looked at our text here
[45:42] now our main text was out of Isaiah 65
[45:45] so let's just go back there and briefly
[45:46] read that Isaiah 65 from Sunday night we
[45:49] looked at that this is the the scripture
[45:51] we hear most often when you hear people
[45:53] talk about the Millennium you talk about
[45:54] the line laying down with the land
[45:56] and the meeting strong together and so
[45:58] forth let's look at that we'll start at
[46:00] verse
[46:01] 19 Isaiah 6519 and I'll rejoice in
[46:05] Jerusalem and joy in my people and the
[46:07] voice of weeping shall be no more heard
[46:09] in her nor the voice of
[46:12] crying there should be no more V an
[46:15] infant of days nor an old man that hath
[46:16] not filled his days for the child shall
[46:18] die and 100 years old but the sinner
[46:21] being 100 years old shall be
[46:24] accursed and they shall build houses and
[46:26] inhabit them and they shall plant
[46:28] Vineyards and eat the fruit of them
[46:30] verse 22 they shall not build and
[46:32] another inhabit they shall not plant and
[46:34] another eat for as the days of the tree
[46:36] are the days of my people and my elect
[46:38] shall long enjoy the work of their hands
[46:41] they shall not labor in vain and bring
[46:42] forth for trouble for they are the seed
[46:45] of the bless of the Lord and their
[46:46] offspring with them and this should come
[46:48] to pass that before they call I will
[46:50] answer and while they're yet speaking I
[46:52] will hear the wolf and the lamb shall
[46:54] feed together and the lion shall eat
[46:56] straw like the bulock and dust shall be
[46:58] the Serpent's meat they shall not hurt
[47:01] nor destroy and all my Holy Mountain
[47:02] sayith the Lord amen so most of us are
[47:05] familiar with that text there that's
[47:08] where we get a lot of our teaching on
[47:10] the
[47:11] Millennium and as you remember from
[47:13] Sunday night there's a few things that
[47:14] brother Brandon wasn't quite sure about
[47:17] uh they asked him will there be any
[47:18] death in Millennium or there be any
[47:19] children M and he said I don't know it
[47:21] sounds a lot like there could be sounds
[47:23] a lot like there might not be he said
[47:24] when God lets me know let you know about
[47:26] it so as far as we know we don't know it
[47:29] we're not for sure but in the scripture
[47:30] we see it talks about dying and so forth
[47:33] it talks about a cursing even even this
[47:36] in this text here so for for that part I
[47:38] just can't interpret that because
[47:39] brother Brandon didn't really interpret
[47:40] it for us and a prophet is one who's
[47:42] called to interpret the word so we just
[47:45] leave that not sure but we uh went on
[47:47] Wednesday night and we or Sunday night
[47:49] rather we showed how there's three
[47:50] comings of Christ to redeem the bride to
[47:52] Rapture the bride and Rule with the
[47:54] bride in the millennium Prophet taught
[47:56] us that and we read through our teaching
[47:58] on Isaiah 65 where we get a lot of our
[48:00] teaching we showed though how the new
[48:02] Earth is not the millenum on Sunday
[48:04] night they're two different things I'll
[48:05] just show the picture um right there so
[48:09] here's the new Earth and the new heavens
[48:11] and the new Earth it's the eighth day uh
[48:13] the Millennium though is the seventh day
[48:15] or Thousand Years the Thousand Years of
[48:17] Peace we've had 6,000 years of human
[48:19] history since Adam from what brother
[48:21] brandom taught uh but after the Rapture
[48:23] we'll have a Thousand-Year Millennium
[48:24] what God will finally have his day of
[48:26] rest praise God and then after that
[48:28] thousand year Millennium there'll be the
[48:29] Battle of go and Magog and then the
[48:31] white Throne judgment uh and then we'll
[48:34] break into eternity new Heavens new
[48:36] Earth where there's no time anymore okay
[48:39] we looked at that and then we saw how
[48:41] there had to be a cleansing of the
[48:42] battle or the uh the tribulation and
[48:45] battle of Armageddon get the Earth ready
[48:46] for the Millennium and then we'll walk
[48:48] up out on the ashes of the wicked Jesus
[48:52] rules on the earth uh on the throne of
[48:56] David okay as the son of David during
[48:58] Millennium that's what that's for the
[49:00] son of David he son of man he was son of
[49:03] man in his Earthly ministry right now
[49:04] he's Son of God His Holy Spirit and then
[49:06] Millennium he'll be son of David uh
[49:09] ruling the world here and we saw that we
[49:11] saw the pictures here on Sunday night
[49:12] right now he's on the father's Throne as
[49:14] Son of God when the Millennium he'll be
[49:16] on uh his own throne here on the earth
[49:19] the son of David we saw that on Sunday
[49:21] night praise God uh we saw the foolish
[49:23] virgin will not be a part of the
[49:25] millenum miss that because it's only for
[49:27] the elect praise God uh the only ones
[49:29] that'll be able to make that uh okay we
[49:33] went over that the day of the Lord is
[49:35] actually the day
[49:36] when um it's the day where God brings
[49:39] forth judgment we'd say Armageddon and
[49:41] so forth and then the Millennium God
[49:43] gets his day or thousand years with his
[49:46] bride that's the day of the Lord uh we
[49:49] looked at more Bible teaching the the
[49:51] righteous literally walk in the
[49:52] Millennium upon the ashes of the wicked
[49:54] from Malachi 4 uh verses 1 through six
[49:57] there we're not going to like said we're
[49:58] just quickly reviewing um Satan is bound
[50:01] during the Millennium he's literally not
[50:02] on the earth he's literally Bound in the
[50:04] bottomless
[50:05] pit uh and that's important because a
[50:08] lot of people say you know the Rapture
[50:10] is already happened they say the
[50:11] raptures happen because uh they they
[50:14] take the quote where brother R said the
[50:15] shout voice Trump and they say the
[50:16] shouts gone forth so the Rapture is
[50:18] already started and they take that uh
[50:20] and don't realize it's a three-step
[50:22] process right shout voice and then the
[50:24] truck The Voice the resurrection that
[50:26] wakes the sleeping uh bride like St Paul
[50:29] and different ones down through the age
[50:31] and the trumpet brother the trumpet is
[50:32] the voice of Christ so he said the final
[50:35] voice calling the bride off the Earth
[50:36] will be the the Trump so uh they get
[50:40] that confused so it's important that we
[50:42] uh get that
[50:43] straight we went over some quotes where
[50:45] brother B talked about it leoa the leoan
[50:48] age last as long as the brides here at
[50:51] the at the Rapture that's when leoan
[50:53] ends right the age itself ends that's
[50:57] true and then we saw how brother said
[50:59] we're not sure if there's children born
[51:01] in the mnium or not he said if God ever
[51:02] reveals it I'll let you know but it has
[51:04] to come from God okay there's no sin on
[51:07] the earth during the Millennium
[51:09] according to what we understand and
[51:10] we'll be in glorified bodies in the
[51:12] Millennium eating and drinking and
[51:13] building as we saw the Bible said we'll
[51:16] build and so
[51:18] forth okay the honey the Millennium is
[51:20] the honeymoon uh the Rapture is the
[51:22] wedding you went over that uh I
[51:26] think yeah we're Kings we ended with
[51:28] we're Kings and Priests on the earth
[51:30] okay so we saw we Clos by saying uh the
[51:33] Bible said we're already Kings and
[51:35] Priests and brother Braham said we are
[51:36] Kings because we rule over sin right now
[51:38] in our lives so we should rule our homes
[51:40] we should rule the church uh by ruling
[51:43] over sin and then we're priest by
[51:44] praying worshiping and making sacrifices
[51:47] unto God
[51:49] interceding okay so uh I want to just
[51:52] play that now I want to put this up here
[51:54] while I'm
[51:56] preaching I haven't preached this
[51:57] message yet but I want to preach this
[51:59] message on the two resurrections pretty
[52:00] soon I just want to show the picture
[52:02] while we're preaching okay I just want
[52:05] to show this how many know there's two
[52:08] resurrections praise God the first
[52:10] resurrection is the rapture okay and
[52:12] whoever is a part of that Resurrection
[52:14] right there they of course they live
[52:16] they don't live through the tribulation
[52:17] but the tribulation is going on while
[52:19] there're at the wedding supper uh and
[52:21] then they come back all Christ and all
[52:22] the saints come back for the batt battle
[52:24] of Armageddon Earth is burned over with
[52:26] fire and then you uh live as part of the
[52:28] Thousand-Year Millennial Reign and then
[52:31] we also were gathered with the Saints in
[52:33] Christ uh when the Satan you know
[52:36] circles around the the Saints and fire
[52:38] comes down from heaven and destroys
[52:40] Satan so forth uh but the second
[52:43] Resurrection is the white Throne
[52:44] judgment where everybody the Bible said
[52:46] all those that are in the grave will
[52:47] hear the voice of the son of man okay so
[52:50] I just want to leave this up here so we
[52:51] can get this straight uh if you're not
[52:53] if not for certain on that I'll preach a
[52:55] separate sermon on this I just wanted to
[52:57] give you that visual is that okay does
[52:58] that help by God's grace there's two
[53:00] resurrections okay it's important that
[53:02] we're part of the first one those that
[53:04] are in the first resurrection are
[53:05] blessed and
[53:06] holy amen that's what we want to be
[53:09] tonight by God's grace okay now let's
[53:11] get to some fresh stuff that was about
[53:13] seven minutes or eight minutes of review
[53:14] there um I want to read this here
[53:16] brother tells us this in
[53:19] 1961 says but Jesus will not be on earth
[53:23] now the Messiah will not be on the Earth
[53:25] until the Millennium sets in because the
[53:28] church were're caught up together to
[53:29] meet the Lord in the air he never comes
[53:31] to Earth he catches his bride away okay
[53:34] so when the when the Rapture takes place
[53:35] where does Jesus come he doesn't touch
[53:37] the Earth he meets Us in the air right
[53:41] like Isaac Isaac wasn't in his house
[53:44] right uh when he met Rebecca he went out
[53:46] into the field right and he didn't go
[53:49] all the way to Rebecca's home right he
[53:51] met her halfway you would say he met her
[53:53] halfway he met her out in the field and
[53:56] then he took Rebecca into his home so
[53:59] that's a beautiful type of Jesus Christ
[54:01] here so Jesus when he comes back he
[54:03] meets Us in the air he doesn't come down
[54:04] to the Earth because the Earth is filled
[54:06] with sin and so forth brother said he
[54:08] catches his bride away brother said he
[54:10] gets a ladder so Christ has a ladder and
[54:13] it goes from Heaven down to the sky
[54:16] right we have ladders that goes from
[54:18] Earth up to the sky but Jesus's ladder
[54:20] starts from Heaven comes down halfway to
[54:23] the to the air right but man said he
[54:24] gets lad you know like that
[54:26] play uh he says Romeo and Juliet brother
[54:29] R says he put the ladder up and stole
[54:32] his bride away see now he's just coming
[54:34] down Jacob's Ladder and say sweetheart
[54:37] come here we're going up to meet him
[54:40] amen so we put ladders to go from Earth
[54:42] to the air but Jesus uses Jacob's Ladder
[54:45] to go from Heaven down to the sky down
[54:47] to the air amen and we'll rise up
[54:49] Jacob's Ladder for the Rapture amen
[54:52] hallelujah because Jacob's Ladder goes
[54:54] up to heaven and at the top of Jacob's
[54:56] Ladder what we see the son of man praise
[54:58] God Jesus Christ himself amen now
[55:01] brother tells us this so uh we've been
[55:03] looking at this with the Ephesian Church
[55:05] age I'm sorry Ephesians parallels Joshua
[55:08] we I want to read this quote as well the
[55:11] promised land for Israel was not a type
[55:13] of the Millennium it was a type of the
[55:14] Holy Ghost I want to make sure I read
[55:17] that he
[55:19] says many people refer to the promised
[55:21] land as the Millennium it's not the
[55:24] Promised Land had Wars and killings the
[55:26] Millennium won't have any wars or
[55:27] killings it's referred to the Holy
[55:29] Spirit the Battlegrounds okay so in
[55:31] Israel I just want to read over a few
[55:32] quotes when Israel left Egypt that was
[55:35] justification when their Wilderness
[55:36] sanctification when they took over the
[55:38] promised land and went into the promised
[55:40] land that's the baptism of the Holy
[55:41] Ghost praise God them crossing over was
[55:44] not the Millennium brother BR said the
[55:46] Millennium was tiped by Solomon how many
[55:48] knew that Solomon where they had total
[55:50] peace for about 40 years or so that
[55:52] typed of Millennium and he says it right
[55:54] here greater than Solomon is here in
[55:58] 1963 now the days of Solomon any
[56:01] scriptural man knows that was the Golden
[56:03] Age of the Hebrews they had no Wars it
[56:05] was almost like a millennium to them a
[56:07] great day they built the temple All
[56:09] Nations feared them they afraid to do
[56:11] anything because they know that the
[56:13] people was of one heart and one Accord
[56:15] God gave them a gift and they believed
[56:17] it they accepted it with one heart in in
[56:19] one Accord they worked with it praise
[56:21] the Lord all right so I hope just want
[56:24] to read those two quotes and one more
[56:26] here the Bible said this here I'm sorry
[56:29] brother says this in Fellowship
[56:31] 1960 when he lets a man live through the
[56:34] thousand years it's a type and a
[56:37] memorial to that he will never no more
[56:39] destroy man and will never more be there
[56:43] will never be no more sin that he's back
[56:45] in fellowship with God eternally so the
[56:48] Millennium there is to show that God
[56:50] will finish a day he will finish a day
[56:52] with no sin he will finish a day with
[56:55] complete perfect fellowship with with
[56:57] his creation amen so the church has to
[57:01] fight against sin we fight against sin
[57:03] all the way up to the Rapture and then
[57:05] we live without sin for a thousand years
[57:07] showing that there will come a time
[57:09] later new Heavens Earth where there's no
[57:11] sin at all and that restores the
[57:13] fellowship so we're GNA have a whole
[57:15] complete day of that wonderful
[57:17] Fellowship praise the
[57:19] Lord all right thank you now let's get
[57:22] into some scriptures have your Bibles
[57:24] let's look at Revelation Chapter 2 you
[57:26] got your Bibles Malachi you can to be
[57:27] ready to read Lydia you have your Bible
[57:29] honey okay just it's helpful if you can
[57:31] read that Revelation 2 Malachi go to
[57:35] Revelation
[57:38] 2:26 and then Lydia can you go to
[57:40] Revelation
[57:41] 125 so Malachi can you read Revelation 2
[57:45] 26 and 27 can you read both of those
[57:47] Malachi 26 and
[57:48] 27 and he that overcometh and keepeth my
[57:52] Works unto the end to him give power
[57:55] over the Nations and he shall rule them
[57:58] with a rod of iron as the vessels of a
[58:02] Potter shall they be broken to shiers
[58:05] even as I received of my father amen
[58:08] praise God how many believe those are
[58:09] red letter words your eyes tell you that
[58:12] so what did Jesus say to him that
[58:15] overcomes I will give power over the
[58:18] Nations now look at that that's this
[58:19] ain't some fairy
[58:21] tale if you can overcome Satan in your
[58:24] personal life
[58:25] Jesus says you're worthy to rule a
[58:27] nation my goodness and we're elting
[58:29] people that can't even rule over their
[58:31] email right or can't even rule over
[58:33] their tongue they can't even control
[58:34] their cussing and swearing they can't
[58:36] even rule over lust you know because I
[58:39] know certain candidates have uh all
[58:41] kinds of evil clubs and all kinds of
[58:43] been married three four times they can't
[58:45] even rule over their own personal lives
[58:47] Jesus said they're not going to rule in
[58:49] the Millennium amen someone who
[58:51] overcomes Satan will rule in the
[58:53] Millennium praise God
[58:56] now look at verse uh okay now that he
[58:59] shall rule them with a rod of iron
[59:02] right as the vessels of a Potter should
[59:05] be broken to Shivers you see how all the
[59:07] nations will be broken all their powers
[59:09] will be broken all sin will be broken in
[59:11] the
[59:12] Millennium even as I received my father
[59:15] so praise God okay now Lydia Revelation
[59:17] 125
[59:23] please and C
[59:27] up okay so who's that speaking of
[59:30] brother BR said Revelation 12 has
[59:31] nothing to do with the bride Revelation
[59:33] 12 is Israel right so she that's the
[59:37] nation of Israel brought forth a
[59:40] Manchild who is to rule all nations with
[59:42] a rod of iron now notice Jesus rules but
[59:45] we have power over Nations catch that
[59:48] Jesus rules all of it in the Millennium
[59:50] but he gives us power over
[59:53] Nations okay
[59:55] that's the absolute scripture there we
[59:57] can see that now I'm going to read
[59:58] Revelation 19:15 if you want to turn
[1:00:00] there Revelation
[1:00:02] 19:15 so who's in the Millennium Christ
[1:00:04] is in the Millennium the bride's in the
[1:00:06] Millennium the Overcomer in the New
[1:00:08] Testament which is the bride she's in
[1:00:10] the Millennium there's no foolish virgin
[1:00:12] in the Millennium there's no Satan in
[1:00:14] the Millennium thank God for that amen
[1:00:17] now later I'm going to bring a little
[1:00:18] surprise here I don't know if you know
[1:00:19] brother said some things but there's uh
[1:00:21] there are some people there in the
[1:00:23] Millennium according to the Bible there
[1:00:24] are nations in the Millum okay but we
[1:00:28] hit this first okay re Revelation 19:15
[1:00:31] now this is at the battle of Armageddon
[1:00:33] this is what it speaks right here and
[1:00:35] out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword
[1:00:38] that with it he should Smite the Nations
[1:00:41] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[1:00:43] iron and he tread The Wine Press of the
[1:00:45] fierceness of the wrath of almighty God
[1:00:48] Amen so Jesus pours out the wrath of
[1:00:51] almighty God but what does he rule the
[1:00:53] nations with a rod of of iron which is
[1:00:56] his word praise God
[1:00:58] Amen smites the Nations rules him with a
[1:01:01] rod of iron praise the Lord now here's
[1:01:03] what brother ad said in
[1:01:04] 1964 he said there're the ones that will
[1:01:07] go up from the tribulation but the rest
[1:01:09] of them will go through the tribulation
[1:01:10] go down and everything everything will
[1:01:12] be killed before the
[1:01:14] Millennium the righteous shall come out
[1:01:16] in the Millennium and live a thousand
[1:01:18] years and after the Thousand Years then
[1:01:20] the great white Throne judgment comes
[1:01:22] and then the dead both right and wrong
[1:01:24] is raised and the books were open the
[1:01:26] book of life was open and the Saints the
[1:01:28] wife and the husband set and judged the
[1:01:31] world and there it comes to pass the
[1:01:33] saying he'll judge all nations with the
[1:01:35] rod of iron All Nations shall stand
[1:01:37] before him there and he'll judge them
[1:01:39] with the rod of iron he'll separate the
[1:01:42] sheep from the ghats and say the ghosts
[1:01:43] depart and he'll say to the Sheep Come
[1:01:46] Ye bless are my father praise the Lord
[1:01:49] so let's just get the picture after the
[1:01:50] Rapture after the Rapture all the saints
[1:01:52] go up who overcome all sin of of their
[1:01:54] age they're the bride they come back
[1:01:57] down Jesus smites the nations with the
[1:01:59] sword that comes out of his mouth uh
[1:02:01] fire burns the Earth brother said
[1:02:03] volcanic and atomic burns the Earth
[1:02:06] cleanses it so Jesus can stand upon the
[1:02:08] Earth and during the thousand years we
[1:02:10] have the bride which we believe we're a
[1:02:12] part of have power over Nations but
[1:02:15] Jesus rules all nations with a rod of
[1:02:17] iron and then those same uh Saints in
[1:02:20] Jesus Will judge at the white Throne
[1:02:23] judgment they will the Bible said
[1:02:24] judgment was given unto them at the
[1:02:27] white Throne judgment all right what a
[1:02:29] promise Church none of us are worthy
[1:02:32] that promise praise the Lord none of us
[1:02:34] are worthy but his blood makes us worthy
[1:02:36] praise praise the Lord the bible say
[1:02:37] that they that are called are faithful
[1:02:39] and chosen and are worthy but we don't
[1:02:42] feel that way of our flesh we're not
[1:02:43] worthy but by the grace of God he makes
[1:02:46] us worthy by the washing of regeneration
[1:02:48] of the holy spirit amen now I want to
[1:02:51] say this too also in the Millennium
[1:02:53] there's another group right we said
[1:02:56] Satan's not there foolish virgin's not
[1:02:58] there Christ is there the bride's there
[1:03:01] there's another group that's there the
[1:03:03] 144,000 is there brother says this so
[1:03:07] the 144,000 that get sealed during the
[1:03:10] tribulation right they get sealed under
[1:03:12] the Sixth Seal they get sealed during
[1:03:14] the tribulation period and then they
[1:03:15] have to die as Martyrs the Bible said
[1:03:18] they have to die as Martyrs but then
[1:03:19] they get resurrected uh for the
[1:03:22] Thousand-Year millennium
[1:03:25] says this in the church age book now
[1:03:27] these 144,000 are not the
[1:03:30] bride in Revelation 144 they're called
[1:03:33] virgins and they follow the lamb whe so
[1:03:35] whever so he goeth the fact that they've
[1:03:37] not devide themselves with women shows
[1:03:39] they are Unix according to Matthew 19:12
[1:03:42] the Unix were the keepers of the bridal
[1:03:45] Chambers they were attendants notice
[1:03:47] they did not sit in the throne but
[1:03:49] they're Before the Throne no they not in
[1:03:52] the bride but will be in the the
[1:03:54] Glorious Millennial Reign amen so the
[1:03:58] Jews will be there the
[1:04:01] 144,000 now here's what he says again
[1:04:03] teaches in the church ages now after the
[1:04:05] tribulation period during the Millennium
[1:04:07] as seen by Ezekiel 48
[1:04:09] 1-8 we see the tribes back once more in
[1:04:12] divine order let turn there you got your
[1:04:14] Bible Ezekiel
[1:04:17] 48 Ezekiel
[1:04:22] 48 if you remember the seal this is what
[1:04:24] brother Brandon preaches for about an
[1:04:26] hour and a half before he goes into the
[1:04:27] actual seven seal he preaches on Israel
[1:04:30] back in the Millennium how they'll be
[1:04:32] back the tribes will be back in order
[1:04:35] now Ezekiel
[1:04:36] 48 1-8 and then he said 22 to 29 so we
[1:04:40] got time tonight we got time we'll read
[1:04:42] that by God's grace we'll read that one
[1:04:43] through eight now these are the names of
[1:04:45] the tribes from the north end to the
[1:04:47] coast of the way of hethlon as one goeth
[1:04:50] to
[1:04:51] HTH has aan the board of Damascus
[1:04:54] northward to the coast of HTH for these
[1:04:57] are his sides East and West a portion
[1:04:59] for Dan and by the border of Dan from
[1:05:02] the East side and the West Side a
[1:05:03] portion for Asher by the border of Asher
[1:05:06] from the East side even unto the West
[1:05:08] Side a portion for naftali and by the
[1:05:10] border of naali from the East side into
[1:05:12] the West Side a portion for manasse and
[1:05:14] by the border of Manasseh and from the
[1:05:16] East side unto the West Side a portion
[1:05:18] for Ephraim and by the border of Ephraim
[1:05:20] from the East side into the West Side a
[1:05:22] portion for Reuben and by the border of
[1:05:23] Ruben from the east side of the West
[1:05:25] Side a portion for Judah and by the
[1:05:27] border of Judah from the east side of
[1:05:29] the West Side shall be the offering
[1:05:30] which he shall offer of five and 20,000
[1:05:32] reads in breadth and in length as one of
[1:05:35] the other parts from the East side into
[1:05:37] the west side and the sanctuary shall be
[1:05:39] in the midst of it amen so there's a
[1:05:40] sanctuary during the millenni we're
[1:05:42] gonna get to that in a moment
[1:05:44] too the oblation that ye shall offer un
[1:05:46] the Lord shall be of five and 20,000 in
[1:05:49] length and of 10,000 in breadth amen so
[1:05:52] see back in the millenni we have the 12
[1:05:54] tribes of Israel ministering and
[1:05:56] bringing offerings unto the Lord okay
[1:05:59] now he says he quotes the next scripture
[1:06:01] verses 22 to 29 so let's go to
[1:06:04] 22 so here's where he quotes the rest of
[1:06:07] the tribes verse 22 more over from the
[1:06:10] possession of the Levites and from the
[1:06:12] possession of the city being in the
[1:06:13] midst of that which is the princes
[1:06:15] between the border of Judah and the
[1:06:16] border of Benjamin shall be for the
[1:06:18] prince as for the rest of the tribes
[1:06:21] from the East side into the West Side
[1:06:22] Benjamin shall have a portion by the
[1:06:24] border of Benjamin from the east side of
[1:06:25] the West Side Simeon shall a portion and
[1:06:27] by the border of Simeon from the east
[1:06:29] side of the West issachar a portion and
[1:06:32] by the border of isachar from the East
[1:06:34] side and the West Side zebulun a portion
[1:06:36] and by the border of zebulun from the
[1:06:37] East side and the West Side Gat a
[1:06:39] portion it goes up to what 29 yes and by
[1:06:42] the border of GAD at the South Side
[1:06:44] Southward the Border shall be even unto
[1:06:47] Tamar unto the Waters of strife in
[1:06:49] Kadesh and the river toward the great
[1:06:51] sea this is the land which you shall
[1:06:53] divide by lot under the tribes of Israel
[1:06:54] for inheritance and these are their
[1:06:56] portions saith the Lord God amen glory
[1:07:00] so even uh these tribes although right
[1:07:04] now they're not quite
[1:07:05] recognized uh they will be back in order
[1:07:08] during the Millennium and the sanctuary
[1:07:10] the Bible said the sanctuary shall be in
[1:07:12] the midst of the tribes amen just like
[1:07:14] in the days of Moses amen is that all
[1:07:17] the tribes were were in a cross uh four
[1:07:20] sides of the great Tabernacle so will
[1:07:23] they be back in order by the grace of
[1:07:26] God you know I was talking to a brother
[1:07:28] and you know he was telling me he read
[1:07:29] some research I think it was Brother D
[1:07:31] Smith was telling me that uh the Jewish
[1:07:33] people the Jewish scientists were
[1:07:35] actually the ones who have come up with
[1:07:36] all this DNA technology anybody ever
[1:07:39] heard of
[1:07:40] ancestry.com uh I got a little gift
[1:07:43] there so I set my I set my DNA so I'm
[1:07:45] going to get the results back in a
[1:07:46] little bit and see what all the parts of
[1:07:48] my all the parts of H bloodline that are
[1:07:52] in my that in me I guess I guess I'll
[1:07:54] say it like that uh but the people
[1:07:56] behind all that the research was the
[1:07:58] Jews I think they want I think they want
[1:08:01] an award for that some type of a
[1:08:02] scientific award uh but Church you know
[1:08:05] why they won that or you know why they
[1:08:06] studied that because it's so important
[1:08:08] for them that they have their bloodlines
[1:08:09] all set in order right they want the
[1:08:11] bloodline of uh because only Levites can
[1:08:14] handle uh the sacrifices right brother
[1:08:17] bam said thus sayith the Lord they'll
[1:08:19] rebuild that temple in the Holy Land
[1:08:22] they're going to rebuild it and they can
[1:08:23] only have Levites so Israel was at the
[1:08:26] Forefront of bringing uh this DNA
[1:08:29] technology so they can figure out who's
[1:08:30] Levi who's Asher who's napali who's
[1:08:33] Manasseh they got to have the right kind
[1:08:35] of people the right the right tribe
[1:08:37] handling the fire of God again and so
[1:08:40] here they are at the very Forefront of
[1:08:42] Technology preparing uh to know who the
[1:08:45] Levites are so that they can uh
[1:08:47] reinstitute their Temple worship amen
[1:08:50] and then Jesus comes back and he's going
[1:08:51] to say I'm I was that sacrificial land I
[1:08:54] was the Lamb of God that you rejected
[1:08:56] and the Bible said they'll mourn from
[1:08:57] house to house for days and they'll cry
[1:09:00] but when they come down to it the all
[1:09:02] 144,000 will be born again in a day the
[1:09:05] Bible say the nation of Israel will be
[1:09:06] born in one day amen so there we go
[1:09:09] there's a scriptures brother said these
[1:09:11] teach that the 12 tribes of Israel will
[1:09:13] be back in order during the Millennium
[1:09:16] I'm going to keep reading here he said
[1:09:18] Ezekiel 48 we see the tribes back in
[1:09:21] order he says but from the time that
[1:09:23] Ephraim and Dan joined themselves to
[1:09:25] Idols they died and those tribes have no
[1:09:27] more recognition so right now the tribe
[1:09:30] of Dan and Ephraim will have no
[1:09:31] recognition during this of course Church
[1:09:33] age or even there during the tribulation
[1:09:36] he said now realize that since the
[1:09:38] destruction of Jerusalem all records of
[1:09:40] all tribes have been lost that no one
[1:09:41] can say for sure what tribe he's from
[1:09:44] but God knows the great God who's
[1:09:46] bringing Israel back to palestin knows
[1:09:48] exactly which uh tribe every true
[1:09:51] Israelite is from and from all the
[1:09:53] assembled 144,000 Dan and Ephraim will
[1:09:56] be missing so Dan and Ephraim are
[1:09:58] missing in Revelation 7 so let's read
[1:10:00] that you got your Bibles Revelation
[1:10:04] 7 so we read the millennial scriptures
[1:10:08] with 12 tribes but the 144,000
[1:10:12] tribulation Dan and Ephraim are missing
[1:10:14] let's read
[1:10:18] that and after these things I sorry
[1:10:21] Revelation 71 after these things I saw
[1:10:23] Four Angels standing on the four corners
[1:10:25] of the Earth holding the Four Winds of
[1:10:26] the earth that the wind should not blow
[1:10:28] on the earth nor on the sea nor on any
[1:10:30] tree and I saw another Angel ascending
[1:10:33] from the East having the Seal of the
[1:10:35] Living God and he CRI with a loud voice
[1:10:37] of the Four Angels to whom it was given
[1:10:38] to HT the earth and the Sea saying hurt
[1:10:41] not the Earth neither the sea nor the
[1:10:42] trees till we have sealed the Servants
[1:10:44] of God in their
[1:10:46] foreheads and I heard the number of them
[1:10:48] which were sealed and there were sealed
[1:10:50] 140 and 4,000 of all the tribes of the
[1:10:53] children of Israel of the tribe of Judah
[1:10:54] were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of
[1:10:56] Reuben were sealed 12,000 of the tribe
[1:10:58] of GAD were sealed 12,000 of the tribe
[1:11:01] of Asher were sealed 12,000 the tribe of
[1:11:03] nepalian were sealed 12,000 the tribe of
[1:11:05] Manasses were sealed 12,000 the tribe of
[1:11:08] Simeon were sealed 12,000 of the tribe
[1:11:11] of Levi were sealed 12,000 of the tribe
[1:11:12] of isachar were sealed 12,000 of the
[1:11:15] tribe of Zeon were sealed 12,000 of the
[1:11:17] tribe of Joseph were sealed 12,000 The
[1:11:19] Tribe of Benjamin were sealed 12,000
[1:11:22] amen all right I know that's a lot of
[1:11:24] reading there but did you see Dan and
[1:11:26] Ephraim were not a part of that because
[1:11:28] they committed
[1:11:29] idolatry okay now remember what Paul
[1:11:31] said in 1 Corinthians 6 idolators will
[1:11:34] not inherit the kingdom of God praise
[1:11:36] the Lord so someone cannot have an idol
[1:11:39] above God said a piano can be an idol a
[1:11:41] car could be an idol he said your spouse
[1:11:43] or your children can be an idol anything
[1:11:45] that you give more glory to God anything
[1:11:47] gets more time attention more love more
[1:11:49] worship than God is an idol so idolatry
[1:11:52] kept these 12 TR or these two tribes
[1:11:54] from receiving the Holy Ghost and so it
[1:11:56] does today praise God idolatry keeps
[1:11:59] people from being filled with the Holy
[1:12:00] Ghost today because it's something they
[1:12:02] love more than God we must make sure God
[1:12:05] is the greatest desire of our hearts
[1:12:08] that's why I'm constantly saying we
[1:12:09] cannot let anything get in the way of
[1:12:11] Bible reading of prayer time of coming
[1:12:13] to church brother said Never Lose Your
[1:12:16] Enthusiasm what's he saying always keep
[1:12:18] Jesus number one in your life amen
[1:12:20] always make sure he's the number one
[1:12:22] remember he said set your ction on
[1:12:24] things above make sure the things you
[1:12:26] love the most are not the things of the
[1:12:28] Earth but the things from above the way
[1:12:30] you do that is staying in the presence
[1:12:32] of God keeping yourself where the
[1:12:34] blessings of God are flowing out amen
[1:12:37] glory praise God and I know sometimes
[1:12:39] there are temptations there are
[1:12:40] distractions but the thing to do is
[1:12:42] repent and get back to God keep in your
[1:12:44] first love and keep the word of God
[1:12:46] number one in your life always because
[1:12:48] idolators will not have the Holy Ghost
[1:12:50] and they will not inherit the Millennium
[1:12:52] oh my
[1:12:54] so thank the Lord so now we know more
[1:12:57] people that's going to be in the
[1:12:59] Millennium now let me read you this
[1:13:01] quote and if you got your Bibles go to
[1:13:02] Revelation 20 got your Bibles Revelation
[1:13:08] 20 because I want to show just a few
[1:13:10] scriptures here and there's another
[1:13:13] group that's going to be in the
[1:13:14] Millennium according to the Bible and
[1:13:16] brother R tells us it's the Heathen that
[1:13:19] never heard the message okay I know
[1:13:22] that's kind of shocking to us but
[1:13:24] brother Ram said it and the Bible does
[1:13:26] say there's going to be Nations that get
[1:13:28] deceived at the end of the Millennium so
[1:13:30] they're going to live they're going to
[1:13:31] live without deception for a thousand
[1:13:33] years but then at the end of the
[1:13:35] Thousand Years Satan is loosed right and
[1:13:38] he goes out and deceives the
[1:13:41] Nations and that's quite that's quite a
[1:13:43] thing all right so the Millennium we we
[1:13:46] think it just be the Bride In Christ
[1:13:48] 144,000 but the Bible said there's
[1:13:50] Nations during the land that get
[1:13:52] deceived oh my the Bible's Rich okay
[1:13:55] Revelation 20 verse
[1:13:59] three verse uh three and cast Satan him
[1:14:03] into the bottomless pit and shut him up
[1:14:04] and set a seal upon him that he should
[1:14:06] deceive the Nations no more
[1:14:08] till the Thousand Years should be
[1:14:10] fulfilled and after that he must be
[1:14:11] loose a little
[1:14:14] season okay now go to verse 7 Revelation
[1:14:16] 20 verse
[1:14:20] 7 now that might shock you Church
[1:14:23] uh but the Bible said there will be
[1:14:25] Nations remember the Bible said there'll
[1:14:27] be children in the Millennium a child
[1:14:29] will be born and all these things so it
[1:14:31] seems like there there's going to be
[1:14:32] Nations during the Millennium because we
[1:14:34] have to rule over somebody how can you
[1:14:36] have power over Nations if the nations
[1:14:38] are empty and there's nobody in the
[1:14:40] Nations right okay so verse seven
[1:14:44] Revelation 20 verse 7 and when the
[1:14:46] thousand years are expired Satan shall
[1:14:48] be loosed out of his prison and shall go
[1:14:51] out to deceive the Nations which are in
[1:14:53] the four quarters of the earth so Satan
[1:14:57] has to deceive somebody look what
[1:14:59] happens God meog to gather them together
[1:15:02] to battle now listen how many is it how
[1:15:05] many nations are there how many people
[1:15:07] are there the Bible tells us right here
[1:15:09] the number of whom is as the sand of the
[1:15:11] sea that's a lot of people you can have
[1:15:14] a lot of people more than a thousand
[1:15:16] years
[1:15:17] right oh my verse
[1:15:20] n and they went up on the breath of the
[1:15:23] Earth Encompass the camp of the Saints
[1:15:25] about and the Beloved city what city is
[1:15:28] that Jerusalem isn't that the Beloved
[1:15:31] City so Satan deceives all these nations
[1:15:34] the numbers of sand of the sea and he
[1:15:36] brings them to surround that holy city
[1:15:39] that beloved City that lovely city of
[1:15:42] Jerusalem and fire came down out of
[1:15:45] heaven and what devoured them isn't that
[1:15:48] a striking
[1:15:49] picture so for a thousand years there's
[1:15:52] going to be brother Bram says they're
[1:15:54] Heathen now let me read you the quote
[1:15:55] can I read you the quote from questions
[1:15:57] answers
[1:15:59] 1962 and then at the return of the
[1:16:01] church and the bride the Bride In Christ
[1:16:03] shall walk out upon the ashes in the
[1:16:05] Millennium when the earth is purified by
[1:16:07] fire and there they shall reign and the
[1:16:10] heathens that's never heard the gospel
[1:16:13] shall be raised in that time and the
[1:16:15] sons of God will be manifested if he's
[1:16:18] to Reign he's got to have something to
[1:16:20] Reign Over he's got a
[1:16:24] and they ruled and reign with Christ and
[1:16:26] Christ ruled with a rod of iron the
[1:16:29] Nations then the sons of God I'm sorry
[1:16:31] then the manifested sons of God with the
[1:16:33] authority just like he had when he was
[1:16:35] here there will come the Millennium in
[1:16:37] that time he said walking upon the
[1:16:40] ashes okay is that a surprise to anybody
[1:16:43] that that was to me that was to me when
[1:16:45] I read that quote and read these
[1:16:48] scriptures now but let's not stop there
[1:16:50] let's look go to verse 10 revelation
[1:16:52] 20:10
[1:16:53] so we must rule over sin now if we
[1:16:57] expect to rule Nations later we must
[1:16:59] rule over sin we must say no sin no
[1:17:02] temptation you're not I'm not falling to
[1:17:04] you today praise God I'm not gonna be
[1:17:06] weak today I'm gonna be strong I'm gonna
[1:17:08] rule because I'm a king and one day I'll
[1:17:10] be a king or queen praise God and I'll
[1:17:13] rule over Nations but we got to rule
[1:17:14] over sin right now okay verse 10 so
[1:17:19] after fire licks up or Burns all these
[1:17:22] heathen
[1:17:23] verse 10 and the devil that deceived
[1:17:26] them was cast in lake of fire and
[1:17:28] brimstone where the Beast and the false
[1:17:30] prophet are and shall be tormented day
[1:17:32] and night forever and
[1:17:35] ever all that's something so can
[1:17:39] everybody get the picture now according
[1:17:41] to this we're the bride gets raptured
[1:17:43] right tribulation everybody uh is going
[1:17:46] crazy uh there just it's awful it's the
[1:17:48] worst time the Bible said in Daniel 12
[1:17:50] there's never there'll never be another
[1:17:51] time like it never was another time like
[1:17:53] it it's going to be so awful okay the
[1:17:56] two prophets of course it's called the
[1:17:58] tribulation The Sixth Seal the
[1:18:00] tribulation seal Jesus comes back at the
[1:18:02] end with a sword that comes out of his
[1:18:04] mouth and uh brings forth judgment now
[1:18:08] in the Millennium you have Christ and
[1:18:10] the bride and the 144,000 in Jerusalem
[1:18:13] praise God because the Bible said the
[1:18:16] bride will never leave the side of
[1:18:18] Christ so if Christ is there in the
[1:18:20] sanctuary sitting on the The Throne of
[1:18:22] the son of David guess who's going to be
[1:18:24] there as well his wife hallelujah amen
[1:18:27] and the 144,000 will be the Unix that'll
[1:18:30] keep the bridal Chambers oh my for a
[1:18:33] thousand years and you'll have Heathen
[1:18:35] or nations grow up how many ages how I
[1:18:38] don't know but they'll multiply multiply
[1:18:40] multiply for a thousand years and that
[1:18:42] gives Christ and the bride a chance to
[1:18:44] rule the Earth for a thousand years and
[1:18:47] she gets to have power she has power
[1:18:49] over Nations judgment over Nations
[1:18:52] because she's spit to rule because she's
[1:18:54] proved She's Fit to rule during her
[1:18:56] lifetime upon this Earth amen and at the
[1:18:59] very end after the Thousand Years
[1:19:01] expired you the Battle of Gog and Magog
[1:19:03] Satan deceives one more time he deceives
[1:19:06] all these nations and they surround that
[1:19:07] Holy City fire comes down burns them up
[1:19:11] and then the Bible said Satan the devil
[1:19:14] and the Beast and false prophet I'm
[1:19:16] sorry the devil was cast Lake of Fire
[1:19:18] where the Beast and false prophet
[1:19:19] already are because they get tossed in
[1:19:21] there after the of
[1:19:25] armagan all right and then after that
[1:19:27] then the Bible said all the rest of the
[1:19:29] Dead hear the voice of the Lord right
[1:19:31] there so let's go to John chapter 5
[1:19:33] we'll just go just read that by God's
[1:19:34] grace John chapter
[1:19:51] 5
[1:19:57] praise the Lord okay now go to verse 24
[1:20:01] I want to show you the two scriptures
[1:20:02] like I said I'll try to preach a whole
[1:20:03] message on this at some point maybe next
[1:20:05] Wednesday we'll see by God's grace go to
[1:20:08] verse 24
[1:20:10] now verses 24 to 27 is the bride or the
[1:20:14] first
[1:20:15] resurrection versus 28 and 29 is the
[1:20:20] second Resurrection okay so let's read
[1:20:22] verse 4 verily verely I say to you he
[1:20:25] that heareth my word and believeth on me
[1:20:27] that sent me hath everlasting life and
[1:20:29] shall not come into condemnation but has
[1:20:31] passed from Death unto life see what
[1:20:34] what what is that life that's the Holy
[1:20:35] Ghost God's eternal life right so people
[1:20:39] really don't believe God until they're
[1:20:41] born again that's what they really
[1:20:43] believe because now they've got life and
[1:20:45] they pass from Death there's no longer
[1:20:47] death in the soul right there's no
[1:20:48] longer dormant State there's life and
[1:20:51] now they've got the life of God God
[1:20:53] verse 25 verily verily I say to you the
[1:20:55] hour is coming and now is when the dead
[1:20:57] hear the voice of the Son of God and
[1:20:59] they that hear shall live so see not
[1:21:00] everybody hears but all those that died
[1:21:03] in Christ will hear right like Paul said
[1:21:05] the dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:21:08] verse 26 for as the father had life in
[1:21:10] himself so he ha given to the son to
[1:21:12] have life in himself and have given him
[1:21:14] authority to execute judgment also
[1:21:15] because he's the son of
[1:21:17] man that's the first resurrection the
[1:21:20] one we're pointing to over here the
[1:21:21] rapture verses 24 down to 27 is the
[1:21:25] rapture the first resurrection now verse
[1:21:28] 28 and 29 is the second
[1:21:30] Resurrection he says Marvel not at this
[1:21:33] for the hour is coming in which all that
[1:21:36] are in the grave should hear his voice
[1:21:37] all right a l all so that has to be the
[1:21:41] white Throne judgment everyone in the
[1:21:44] grave and shall come forth they that
[1:21:46] have done good unto the resurrection of
[1:21:47] life and they have done evil unto the
[1:21:49] resurrection of
[1:21:51] damnation
[1:21:53] okay so see there's two resurrections
[1:21:55] right the first resurrection is the
[1:21:56] rapture the second Resurrection you're
[1:21:58] either given life or uh Eternal
[1:22:01] destruction or Eternal separation from
[1:22:03] God we say now go back to Revelation 20
[1:22:06] if we
[1:22:08] can Revelation 20 coming a lot of future
[1:22:11] events tonight by God's grace hope
[1:22:13] that's okay it's a good it's a good
[1:22:15] review if you haven't gone over this for
[1:22:16] a
[1:22:17] while now verse 11 let's go let's read
[1:22:20] 11 to the end so you can see the white
[1:22:22] Throne judgment right
[1:22:24] here verse 11 and I saw a great white
[1:22:27] throne and him that sat on it from whose
[1:22:29] face the Earth and Heaven fled away and
[1:22:32] there was no place I'm sorry found no
[1:22:34] place for them and I saw the dead small
[1:22:37] and great stand before God and the books
[1:22:39] were open and another book was open
[1:22:41] which is The Book of Life and the dead
[1:22:43] were judged out of those things which
[1:22:45] were written in the books according to
[1:22:47] their Works look at this remember Jesus
[1:22:49] said there's going to be a day when all
[1:22:50] hear my voice look at the next verse and
[1:22:52] the Sea gave up the dead which were in
[1:22:55] it and death and Hell delivered up the
[1:22:57] dead which were in them and they were
[1:22:59] judge every man according to his works
[1:23:01] and death and hell were cast in Lake of
[1:23:03] Fire this is the second death and
[1:23:04] whosoever was not found written The Book
[1:23:06] of Life was cast in the Lake of
[1:23:08] Fire does that make sense by God's grace
[1:23:11] so the first resurrection is the rapture
[1:23:13] they live a thousand years with Christ
[1:23:15] the second Resurrection some people are
[1:23:17] given eternal life others are given
[1:23:19] Eternal Annihilation at some point
[1:23:21] they'll be annihilated right and they
[1:23:23] might burn for a million years a billion
[1:23:25] years but at some point they will cease
[1:23:26] to exist because you cannot live forever
[1:23:29] unless you have eternal life I just
[1:23:31] heard a famous preacher today on the
[1:23:32] radio he said he said whoever you vote
[1:23:34] for he said you're G to spend eternity
[1:23:36] with you vote for Jesus you get eternal
[1:23:37] life if you vote for Satan you get
[1:23:39] eternal life or eternal life with Satan
[1:23:41] I thought that don't even make any sense
[1:23:43] how can you have eternal life with Satan
[1:23:45] how can you live eternally with Satan if
[1:23:47] you don't have eternal life right you
[1:23:49] got to have eternal life to live forever
[1:23:51] so they have some sort of life but not
[1:23:52] eternal life and at some point they have
[1:23:54] to cease from existing they have to have
[1:23:57] no more
[1:24:00] existence okay so I hope that helps by
[1:24:02] God's grace hope every everybody can see
[1:24:04] that this was kind of new to me where I
[1:24:05] read that quote where brother bam said
[1:24:07] the Heathen will have uh will multiply
[1:24:09] multiply multiply during that time and
[1:24:12] the Heathen will have to be judged by
[1:24:13] the Christ and the bride and then
[1:24:15] they're all deceived they're all
[1:24:17] deceived and they go into uh the goag
[1:24:20] and Magog there and try to surround the
[1:24:21] holy city but Jesus uh or fire comes
[1:24:24] down and protects of course Jesus and
[1:24:26] the Saints and uh
[1:24:28] Israel oh my what a what a string of
[1:24:32] events now let's uh move on here now
[1:24:35] let's go to Ezekiel
[1:24:38] 43 Ezekiel we did Ezekiel 48 now it's go
[1:24:41] to Ezekiel
[1:24:45] 43 and the reason we're going here is
[1:24:47] because brother Braham used this
[1:24:48] scripture in the sixfold purpose of
[1:24:50] Gabriel's visit to Daniel
[1:24:53] and this is the scripture he gave on how
[1:24:54] there'll be a
[1:24:55] sanctuary U and we also saw that in
[1:24:58] Ezekiel 48 as
[1:25:00] well there's a Jewish sanct I'm sorry
[1:25:02] there's a sanctuary uh during the
[1:25:06] Millennium okay so Ezekiel
[1:25:09] 43
[1:25:14] 1-7 afterward he brought me to the gate
[1:25:17] even the gate that lookth toward the
[1:25:18] East and behold the glory of God of
[1:25:20] Israel came from the way of the and his
[1:25:22] voice was like a noise of many Waters
[1:25:25] and the Earth shine with his
[1:25:28] glory so look the glory of God is
[1:25:31] shining upon the Earth at this point now
[1:25:32] verse three and it was according to the
[1:25:34] appearance of the vision which I saw
[1:25:35] even according to the vision that I saw
[1:25:37] when I came to destroy the city and the
[1:25:39] Visions were like the vision that I saw
[1:25:41] by the river chabar and I fell upon my
[1:25:43] face and the glory of the Lord came into
[1:25:45] the house by the way of the gate whose
[1:25:48] Prospect is toward the East so the
[1:25:50] spirit took me up and brought me into
[1:25:51] the inner cour court and behold the
[1:25:53] glory of the Lord filled the
[1:25:54] house and I heard him speaking unto me
[1:25:57] out of the house and the man stood by me
[1:26:00] he said to me son of man the place of my
[1:26:02] throne and the place of The Souls of my
[1:26:04] feet where I dwell in the midst of the
[1:26:06] children of Israel forever and my Holy
[1:26:08] Name shall the house of Israel no more
[1:26:10] defile neither they nor their kings nor
[1:26:13] their by their whoredom nor by the
[1:26:15] carcasses of their kings in their high
[1:26:18] places so look at this God takes Ezekiel
[1:26:21] and he goes in the house of God
[1:26:22] and the glory of God fills the house of
[1:26:24] God he said no more will there be any
[1:26:26] defilement in this Temple and brother
[1:26:29] man says in the 7th week of
[1:26:33] Daniel he says now notice that's where
[1:26:35] we seen her coming back to the
[1:26:37] millennial Temple over here at the end
[1:26:38] of the Jewish age the anointed here he
[1:26:41] come riding on the White Horse there F
[1:26:42] him on white horses horses or Powers
[1:26:45] dressed in white the vesture dipped in
[1:26:47] blood he's talking about the battle of
[1:26:48] Armageddon wrote on him the word of God
[1:26:50] he cometh the mighty conquer yes yeser
[1:26:52] accept the Millennium coming to the
[1:26:53] temple Glory there he meets the
[1:26:56] 144,000 he said now the sixfold purpose
[1:26:59] we find out that the sixth purpose of
[1:27:02] Gabriel's visit to Daniel was to anoint
[1:27:04] the most holy how many remember that
[1:27:05] from the scripture it's in Daniel
[1:27:07] chapter nine so let's go there Daniel
[1:27:09] chapter N I preach on this about two
[1:27:12] years ago
[1:27:14] 2014 Daniel 70
[1:27:21] weeks
[1:27:25] okay it's verse
[1:27:27] 24 Daniel
[1:27:29] 9:24 70 weeks are determined upon thy
[1:27:32] people and upon thy Holy City to finish
[1:27:34] the transgression now that's the first
[1:27:36] part there's six purposes for Gabriel's
[1:27:39] visit to
[1:27:40] Daniel to finish the transgression to
[1:27:43] make an end of their sins to make
[1:27:45] reconciliation for iniquity to bring an
[1:27:48] everlasting righteousness to seal the
[1:27:50] vision and prophecy and to an oint the
[1:27:52] most holy so the last purpose of these
[1:27:57] uh Times of Israel the 70 weeks the last
[1:28:00] purpose is to anoint the most holy
[1:28:02] brother BR said that can't be Jesus
[1:28:04] because he's already
[1:28:05] anointed amen he's already got a
[1:28:08] glorified body he's already perfect
[1:28:09] right he said this anointing brother
[1:28:12] said is to anoint the new Millennial
[1:28:14] Temple the Temple of Israel right for
[1:28:17] the Millennium brother Ram says amen now
[1:28:20] let you read it he said to anoint the
[1:28:22] most holy we find out that the most holy
[1:28:25] always represents the church the
[1:28:27] Tabernacle and the last thing to be done
[1:28:30] was to anoint the most holy that's the
[1:28:32] millennial Tabernacle that Christ will
[1:28:35] live in during the Millennium and will
[1:28:38] live
[1:28:39] in hallelujah amen thank you Jesus so
[1:28:44] the last purpose is to what the Bible
[1:28:46] said anoint that Holy Temple and when
[1:28:48] Christ comes in that Temple is going to
[1:28:50] be anointed amen whoever God is there's
[1:28:52] an anointing praise the lord it's
[1:28:55] exactly right now he says this again in
[1:28:57] the six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit
[1:28:58] to Daniel
[1:29:01] 1961 when the temple is erected the
[1:29:03] resurrection has come the Jews has
[1:29:06] returned Christ and his bride has come
[1:29:08] the Jew the 144,000 are sealed the
[1:29:10] Millennium has taken place there will be
[1:29:13] an anointing when the most holy place
[1:29:15] will be anointed the holiest of holies
[1:29:18] and the most holy the the most holy
[1:29:21] place is the sanctuary where God live
[1:29:23] between the cheram and this time it will
[1:29:26] be Christ sitting in the most holy place
[1:29:29] with the anointing upon Him amen glory
[1:29:32] amen so during the time of Moses they
[1:29:34] had the Ark of the Covenant right where
[1:29:36] there just was a spirit God's spirit
[1:29:38] dwelt there between the cherubs but
[1:29:40] during this time during this 100 this a
[1:29:42] thousand year Millennial Reign it won't
[1:29:45] be an ark sitting there it'll be Christ
[1:29:47] sitting there amen Christ will sit in
[1:29:49] the most holy place and his bride must
[1:29:52] be there too she's somewhere around
[1:29:53] there she's somewhere real close to
[1:29:56] Christ because He Reigns and then she
[1:29:59] has power over Nations isn't that
[1:30:01] beautiful Church you see that right in
[1:30:02] the scripture praise the Lord to anoint
[1:30:05] the most holy the most holy Place Christ
[1:30:08] sits in the holies of holies in the new
[1:30:11] Sanctuary the new Tabernacle in
[1:30:13] Jerusalem during the Thousand Year
[1:30:16] Millennial Reign
[1:30:18] Hallelujah let me read one more quote
[1:30:20] and this is paragraph 119 the sixfold
[1:30:24] purpose he said now watch the
[1:30:26] description of the temple that's to be
[1:30:27] built in the
[1:30:28] Millennium he says is from Ezekiel the
[1:30:31] 40th chapter until about the 44th
[1:30:34] chapter is nothing in the world but the
[1:30:36] millennial temple being erected on Earth
[1:30:39] he said anybody knows that and when the
[1:30:41] glory of the Lord fills it and so forth
[1:30:43] now we're just going to describe it in
[1:30:44] the 43rd
[1:30:46] chapter of Ezekiel that's what we just
[1:30:48] read praise
[1:30:50] God
[1:30:52] now if you got your bibl go to Isaiah 2
[1:30:54] I'm coming down to close I got maybe
[1:30:56] about 20 more minutes maybe 15 more
[1:30:58] minutes go to Isaiah chapter
[1:31:00] 2 there's another interesting scripture
[1:31:03] here I think that you like Isaiah 2 by
[1:31:05] God's
[1:31:12] grace now let's start at verse two read
[1:31:16] 2 three and four you think brother
[1:31:18] Justice is a really strange text I know
[1:31:20] it is but brother Bram was asking a
[1:31:22] questions and answer about this text and
[1:31:24] they asked him is this the Millennium
[1:31:26] and brother Bram said yes this is the
[1:31:28] millennial okay so let's look at it
[1:31:31] Isaiah chapter 2 veres 2 34 and it
[1:31:34] should come to pass in the last days
[1:31:36] that the mountain of the Lord's house
[1:31:38] shall be established in the top of the
[1:31:40] mountains and should be exalted above
[1:31:42] the hills and All Nations shall flow
[1:31:45] into it do that does that fit the
[1:31:47] Millennium yes because we rule all the
[1:31:50] nations and so the Nations have to flow
[1:31:52] into
[1:31:54] it look at verse three and many people
[1:31:57] shall go and say Come Ye and let us go
[1:31:59] into the mountain Lord to the house of
[1:32:01] the god of Jacob and he will teach us
[1:32:03] his ways now look there's a people that
[1:32:04] needs taught the ways of
[1:32:06] God right so it has to be Nations during
[1:32:09] the thousand year reign to learn about
[1:32:12] God right it's got to be Nations it
[1:32:15] can't be the bride because we'll have
[1:32:16] perfect bodies right we'll have
[1:32:18] glorified bodies it can't be the bride
[1:32:19] it's got to be nations of heathens that
[1:32:21] come to the house of God to learn about
[1:32:24] God and we will walk in his path see
[1:32:27] because there can be no sin for a
[1:32:28] thousand years so they'll be ruled for a
[1:32:30] thousand years for out of Zion shall go
[1:32:34] forth the law and the word of the Lord
[1:32:35] from where Jerusalem praise God that's
[1:32:38] where that Sanctuary will be that Holy
[1:32:40] City the most holy Place verse four and
[1:32:43] he shall judge among the Nations and
[1:32:45] shall rebuke many people and they shall
[1:32:47] beat their swords into plow shares now
[1:32:50] look at that they have swords and what
[1:32:53] are swords used for
[1:32:54] fighting but during this time they take
[1:32:57] their swords and they beat them and
[1:32:58] change the shape of them so they can
[1:33:00] plow the fields with them and that fits
[1:33:03] the that fits the Millennium as well
[1:33:05] because the Bible said they'll plant and
[1:33:07] they will also Harvest Right they'll
[1:33:09] build houses during the Millennium B say
[1:33:12] they'll build houses and plant and all
[1:33:13] these things so that fits the scripture
[1:33:15] as
[1:33:17] well and their Spears into pruning hooks
[1:33:20] so they'll be able to prune trees right
[1:33:22] prune plants instead of fight with their
[1:33:26] Spears Nations shall not lift up sword
[1:33:28] against Nation neither shall they learn
[1:33:30] War anymore well there's Wars all the
[1:33:32] time right now so it's not now it has to
[1:33:34] be in a future time it has to be during
[1:33:37] the Millennium they won't fight these
[1:33:38] nations won't fight anymore instead
[1:33:40] they'll have peace and harmony for a
[1:33:42] thousand years God will teach them his
[1:33:44] ways and they will not sin they will not
[1:33:46] war their their fighting instruments
[1:33:49] will be turned into planting tools right
[1:33:51] right and harvesting tools that's what
[1:33:53] the word of God says now let me read you
[1:33:55] the quote this is from
[1:33:58] uh what think I'm sorry no questions
[1:34:00] answer is 1954 so 54 they asked this to
[1:34:04] brother
[1:34:06] Brandon they say is not Isaiah's meaning
[1:34:09] of the beating of the swords into
[1:34:11] plowshares to come to pass during the
[1:34:13] 10,000 year reign of Christ rather than
[1:34:16] something that man can bring as so many
[1:34:19] modern religionist religionist tell us
[1:34:21] he said that's a good question right
[1:34:25] because some people think uh there's
[1:34:26] going to be peace before the Millennium
[1:34:28] there's not going to be any peace but R
[1:34:30] the only way peace will come to the
[1:34:31] Earth is when Jesus Christ comes back to
[1:34:33] the Earth that's the only way there'll
[1:34:35] be no peace even at the Rapture the
[1:34:37] bride taking the Rapture there's no
[1:34:39] peace during the
[1:34:40] tribulation uh the only time peace will
[1:34:42] happen is in the Millennium a thousand
[1:34:44] year rest so see this person has a good
[1:34:47] question is this going to happen before
[1:34:49] or is this going to happen during the
[1:34:50] Millennium now look what brother says he
[1:34:53] said you are exactly right that's when
[1:34:56] the plowshares will be beat when the
[1:34:58] swords will be beaten the plow shares
[1:35:00] that'll bring forth the millennial Reign
[1:35:02] and all those modernistic religious
[1:35:04] cults that's going on trying to educate
[1:35:06] people the kingdom of God that'll the
[1:35:08] Millennium will be when God himself will
[1:35:09] come in a supernatural being and in
[1:35:12] Supernatural power to a supernatural
[1:35:14] believing people that will receive a
[1:35:16] supernatural power that'll mold God's
[1:35:18] Sons Hallelujah it'll never be no more
[1:35:20] reading writing arithmetic it'll be by
[1:35:23] the power of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:35:25] Christ then the world will study war no
[1:35:29] more
[1:35:31] amen
[1:35:34] glory brother said for there's going to
[1:35:37] be an elect who's going to live through
[1:35:39] the millennial age and will go in and
[1:35:41] out with Christ for a thousand years and
[1:35:44] they shall go up into Glory with him and
[1:35:46] return again when the resurrection of
[1:35:49] the wicked is brought forth then the
[1:35:50] Millennium will the L is over then
[1:35:53] Christ will go up with the church and at
[1:35:54] the end of the thousand years he will
[1:35:56] return with the church all right
[1:36:00] Glory now let me read
[1:36:03] this this is from Israel the church
[1:36:05] 1953 Daniel saw Jesus as a rock HED out
[1:36:09] of the mountain rolled in and strike the
[1:36:12] image that Nebuchadnezzar saw in the
[1:36:14] feet and break it to pieces and the
[1:36:16] kingdom of God grew when Christ takes
[1:36:19] over in the Millennium let me know
[1:36:21] sickness no sorrow every all the all the
[1:36:25] swords will be beat in the plow shares
[1:36:27] and will study war no more that's all
[1:36:30] it'll all be over when Jesus comes until
[1:36:32] then as long as Satan's dominating the
[1:36:34] Nations there'll be wars and rumors of
[1:36:36] wars until Jesus comes praise God amen
[1:36:40] amen now since you're in Isaiah go to
[1:36:42] Isaiah 11 go to Isaiah 11 since you're
[1:36:45] there then we'll go to Micah
[1:36:48] 4 Isaiah
[1:36:50] 11
[1:36:52] now Church what I've
[1:36:54] done is this is now this is just me
[1:36:57] adding a scripture that says the same
[1:36:59] thing as Isaiah chapter 2 Okay so this
[1:37:03] to me looks like it might be the
[1:37:04] Millennium as well it might be because
[1:37:06] we see the same wording turning swords
[1:37:08] into plow
[1:37:11] shears and also talks about the wolf and
[1:37:13] the lamb lying down okay so Isaiah 11
[1:37:16] verse3 Malachi can you read three and
[1:37:18] four for me
[1:37:20] please
[1:37:25] Isaiah
[1:37:29] 11:3 and shall make him a quick
[1:37:33] understanding in the fear of the Lord
[1:37:35] and he shall not judge after the sight
[1:37:37] of his eyes either reprove after the
[1:37:40] hearing of his
[1:37:41] ears but with righteousness shall he
[1:37:44] judge the poor and reprove with iniquity
[1:37:47] through the meek of the earth and he
[1:37:49] shall Smite the Earth with the rod of
[1:37:51] his mouth and with the breath of his
[1:37:53] lips he shall slay the wicked thank you
[1:37:55] L are you ready to read honey are you in
[1:37:58] Isaiah 11 okay can you read five and six
[1:38:01] Dar Isaiah 11 5 and6 and shall be the of
[1:38:06] his voice faithfulness his ve the wolf
[1:38:10] also shall BL the lamb the leopard shall
[1:38:12] down the and the Cal and
[1:38:17] theat and a little
[1:38:19] child a little child leading a calf and
[1:38:22] a young
[1:38:23] lion together right okay now verse uh
[1:38:27] what you read five six seven and the cow
[1:38:29] and the bear shall feed their young on
[1:38:30] shall lie down together and the lion
[1:38:32] shall eat straw like the ox and the
[1:38:34] suckling child shall play on the hole of
[1:38:36] the ass and the wean child shall put his
[1:38:39] hand on the cockatrice is dead they
[1:38:41] shall not hurt nor destroy all my Holy
[1:38:43] Mountain for the Earth shall be full of
[1:38:44] the knowledge of the Lord as the
[1:38:47] waters cover the
[1:38:49] sea all right
[1:38:51] doesn't that sound like the Millennium
[1:38:53] because he talks about the animals
[1:38:55] laying down together in peace it talks
[1:38:57] about children remember brother said who
[1:38:59] are those Nations they're
[1:39:00] heathens they're Heathen Nations that
[1:39:02] get to looks like it looks like they get
[1:39:04] to multiply and reproduce that's what it
[1:39:06] looks like could be wrong on that but
[1:39:08] like said brother looks like it might be
[1:39:10] looks like it might not be okay now uh
[1:39:13] one more scripture here go to Micah
[1:39:15] chapter
[1:39:20] 4
[1:39:26] OB Jonah
[1:39:30] Micah Micah chapter
[1:39:33] 4 so we can clearly see how Isaiah 11
[1:39:36] talks about the lion the lamb the wolf
[1:39:38] and the ox all all living in peace
[1:39:40] together that has to be the
[1:39:42] Millennium now Micah
[1:39:46] 41 okay here's where we get the same
[1:39:48] wording as Isaiah chapter 2 at brother
[1:39:50] Ram Isaiah Isaiah when it talks about
[1:39:52] the swords going to plow shares was the
[1:39:54] Millennium so Micah 4 vers1 when the
[1:39:57] last days come to pass that the mountain
[1:39:59] of the house of the Lord shall be
[1:40:00] established in the top of the mountains
[1:40:01] there shall be exalted above the hills
[1:40:03] and people shall flow into it and many
[1:40:06] nations shall come and say come let's go
[1:40:07] up into the Mount of the Lord into the
[1:40:09] house of the god of Jacob and he will
[1:40:11] teach us of his ways and we will walk in
[1:40:12] his paths and for the law shall go forth
[1:40:14] of Zion and the word of Lord from
[1:40:15] Jerusalem that sounds a lot like Isaiah
[1:40:17] right we just read that verse three and
[1:40:19] he shall judge among men people and
[1:40:21] rebuke strong nations of far off and
[1:40:24] they shall beat their swords into what
[1:40:26] plow shares and their Spears into up
[1:40:28] pruning hooks Nation shall not lift up a
[1:40:31] sword against Nation neither shall they
[1:40:32] learn War anymore but they shall sit
[1:40:36] every man under his Vine and under his
[1:40:37] fig tree and None Shall make them afraid
[1:40:39] for the mouth of the Lord of hosts has
[1:40:41] spoken it for all the people walk
[1:40:43] everyone in the name of his God and we
[1:40:44] will walk in the name of the Lord Our
[1:40:46] God forever and ever in that day say the
[1:40:49] Lord will I assemble her that halted and
[1:40:51] I will gather her that is driven out and
[1:40:52] her that I Afflicted I will make her
[1:40:55] that halth a Remnant and her that was
[1:40:57] cast off I'm sorry far off a strong
[1:40:59] nation and the Lord shall reign over
[1:41:00] them in Mount Zion from henceforth even
[1:41:03] forever and thou oh Tower of the flock
[1:41:06] the stronghold of the daughter of Zion
[1:41:07] unto thee shall come even the first
[1:41:09] Dominion the kingdom shall come to the
[1:41:11] daughter of Jerusalem
[1:41:13] amen glory ain't that beautiful praise
[1:41:17] the Lord so so the time will be a time
[1:41:21] of no war between the Nations they'll
[1:41:24] take their swords they'll take their
[1:41:25] pruning hooks I'm sorry the the their
[1:41:28] their Spears and they'll turn them into
[1:41:30] planting and harvesting crops for a
[1:41:32] thousand years of peace upon the Earth
[1:41:35] praise
[1:41:37] God all right
[1:41:39] now
[1:41:40] closing I'm G to try to close down by
[1:41:43] God's grace got a couple more thoughts I
[1:41:45] want to close with this is this helpful
[1:41:47] tonight by God's grace I never preached
[1:41:48] on the Millennium before this the first
[1:41:50] time I preached on it 10 years as Pastor
[1:41:52] I just never thought to really just I
[1:41:54] guess maybe wasn't LED that way I didn't
[1:41:56] think I was really LED that way I've
[1:41:57] always believed in that I've always
[1:41:59] believed I want to be a part of it and
[1:42:00] by God's grace I'll be a part of it uh
[1:42:02] if I'm blessed and holy by God's grace
[1:42:05] but finally able to preach it
[1:42:07] here now I W to um let's go to
[1:42:12] Revelation three back to Revelation
[1:42:14] three I want to close with the
[1:42:16] qualifications of being in the
[1:42:19] millennium qual
[1:42:23] ifications this is why brother Ram said
[1:42:25] Never Lose Your Enthusiasm we can't lose
[1:42:27] on the small things we got to let the
[1:42:29] word be our our love we got to make the
[1:42:31] word our absolute even when we don't
[1:42:32] feel like coming to church we don't feel
[1:42:34] like praying don't don't feel like
[1:42:35] reading your Bible we' just got to do it
[1:42:37] we got to bring this body into this
[1:42:40] subjection we don't want to get lazy
[1:42:42] because that's the spirit of leoa right
[1:42:45] right we can't let that conquer us we
[1:42:48] over if we overcome it Jesus said you
[1:42:50] sit with me on my throne in the son of
[1:42:52] David not my father's Throne we're not
[1:42:54] sitting on the father's Throne Jesus
[1:42:56] sits on the father's throne but we'll
[1:42:57] sit on his throne with him praise God
[1:43:00] which is the son of David's Throne that
[1:43:02] beautiful Sanctuary we just heard about

[1:43:27] Thy works that thou art neither cold or
[1:43:29] hot I would thou work cold or hot so
[1:43:31] because thou are lukewarm and neither

[1:43:35] mouth because thou sayth I'm rich and
[1:43:37] increased with goods and have need of

[1:43:41] brother brandom said we must always say
[1:43:43] we have more need of God praise God
[1:43:46] because the Ley in spirit will say I
[1:43:48] don't I have enough of God what I need

[1:43:57] than I need you now more than ever
[1:43:59] before that song needs to be a living
[1:44:01] reality in our lives amen that's why I
[1:44:03] always get on the church about coming to
[1:44:05] church and reading your Bibles that's
[1:44:07] you have to if not you'll get Swept Away
[1:44:09] by Lea

[1:44:22] enough of God or I don't need more of
[1:44:23] God or I don't need to gather together
[1:44:25] more as we see the day approaching is
[1:44:26] actually naked blind and wretched and
[1:44:28] don't even know it that's Jesus's red
[1:44:31] letter words right this is his Judgment
[1:44:34] of the leoan church
[1:44:36] age because thou sayest I'm rich and
[1:44:38] increased with Goods okay I already read
[1:44:39] that

[1:45:01] through them okay because that's the
[1:45:03] only way you'll have Christlike
[1:45:05] character gold character is to go
[1:45:06] through the fiery
[1:45:08] trials that thou mayest be rich and
[1:45:11] white rment that th mayest be clothed
[1:45:14] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:45:15] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[1:45:17] eyes shall that the man
[1:45:19] SE we must be able to see sin and we
[1:45:23] must be able to discern it from the the
[1:45:25] the truth the holy words of
[1:45:28] God as many as I love what does Jesus do
[1:45:30] to the ones he loves he what rebukes
[1:45:32] them and chastens them which means to
[1:45:36] show them the right way he first he
[1:45:38] rebukes them and then shows them the
[1:45:40] right way praise God as a preacher it's
[1:45:44] hard but many times I have to rebuke the
[1:45:46] church but don't don't feel bad it's me
[1:45:48] being rebuked first when I read it right
[1:45:50] because God's leading me to study it and
[1:45:52] pray about it and then I get rebuked
[1:45:53] first and I got to bring a rebuke to the
[1:45:55] church right that's the way God set it
[1:45:57] up and if I'm not living it I'm a
[1:45:59] hypocrite I need to be voted out we need
[1:46:00] to get somebody in here who's living the
[1:46:01] word of God Amen just because I just
[1:46:04] because we started the church and I've
[1:46:05] always been Pastor don't mean I have to
[1:46:07] be let's be faithful to the word let's
[1:46:09] stay with the word praise God Everybody
[1:46:12] Must everybody answers to Christ the
[1:46:13] word everyone no one's above it
[1:46:17] amen and be zealous therefore and repent
[1:46:19] so we've heard it the Zeal of the hour
[1:46:21] is to repent of our blindness our
[1:46:23] wretchedness or when it seeks into our
[1:46:25] life and to live Above It by God's grace
[1:46:29] remember Jesus said the true ministers
[1:46:31] at the end time will give them their
[1:46:33] meet and due season does anybody
[1:46:35] everybody remember that
[1:46:36] Parable okay so go to Hebrews chapter 5
[1:46:41] people say I want me brother people
[1:46:44] people said this to me before no one
[1:46:45] here but they've said brother Jess You
[1:46:47] Preach too shallow give us some deeper
[1:46:49] things but let me show show you what the
[1:46:50] Bible
[1:46:51] says uh let me tell you what the Bible
[1:46:53] says about meat
[1:46:57] okay I
[1:46:58] like I just I kind of laugh because you
[1:47:01] know sometimes you you people hurt your
[1:47:03] feelings you just try to love them
[1:47:04] praise God you just try to love
[1:47:07] people but let me tell you what meat
[1:47:10] is meat is being able to see sin and
[1:47:14] call Sin Sin and able to overcome it
[1:47:18] that's meat that's meat preacher
[1:47:20] it might not feel like it but the Bible
[1:47:22] says it
[1:47:25] is revelation is wonderful or maybe
[1:47:28] seeing types and shadows is wonderful
[1:47:30] but real meat preaching something you
[1:47:32] really can chew on and digest and help
[1:47:33] you is showing where there's sin in your
[1:47:35] life and getting rid of
[1:47:38] it that's meat preaching and have you
[1:47:41] seen the Holy Spirit the last few weeks
[1:47:43] preach on the lust of the eyes have you
[1:47:44] seen that has it helped
[1:47:47] anybody I know it's gone home with some
[1:47:49] of us like we talked about
[1:47:51] it's getting into our children's
[1:47:52] thoughts and our mind that's a wonderful
[1:47:53] thing it's it's helping me know you
[1:47:56] think about oh make sure you're looking
[1:47:58] at the right thing always keep all sin
[1:48:00] away from your eyes right Hebrews
[1:48:03] 5 verse
[1:48:05] 12 like I said I've had people criticize
[1:48:08] me and say well you're not deep enough
[1:48:09] but the route of it is what they're
[1:48:11] looking for is they're looking for
[1:48:12] something to tickle their
[1:48:14] ears and those same people uh lay out of
[1:48:17] church those same people don't read
[1:48:18] their Bibles the same people criticize
[1:48:20] people all the time on social media or
[1:48:22] you know that they're just not pleasant
[1:48:24] to be around because they got the wrong
[1:48:27] Spirit Glory because they got some sin
[1:48:29] in their life look at verse uh
[1:48:33] 12 for when for the time you ought to be
[1:48:36] teachers you have need that one teach
[1:48:38] you again which be the first principles
[1:48:40] of the Oracles of God and are become
[1:48:42] such as have need of milk and not of
[1:48:44] strong
[1:48:45] meat for everyone that uses milk is
[1:48:48] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[1:48:50] he's a baby look see that preachers that
[1:48:53] Don't Preach a righteous life are using
[1:48:56] milk right that's what the Bible
[1:49:00] said they don't preach and that's what
[1:49:02] most churches are today I'm not saying
[1:49:04] message but I'm saying denominational or
[1:49:06] independent that have denominational
[1:49:08] Creeds they tell you not to sin but they
[1:49:10] don't tell you what sin is they don't
[1:49:13] tell you that but that's a that's an
[1:49:15] unskillful preacher somebody who just uh
[1:49:18] preaches about the cross but they never
[1:49:19] tell you how to get
[1:49:21] clean right they don't tell you what to
[1:49:24] repent of right but look at verse 14 but
[1:49:28] strong meat belong to them that are of
[1:49:30] full age even those who by reason of
[1:49:32] their use have their senses exercised to
[1:49:35] discern both good and evil
[1:49:39] amen so how many want us how many want
[1:49:41] to eat strong meat in this hour those
[1:49:44] who eat strong meat already have their
[1:49:46] senses exercised and they can recognize
[1:49:48] Good and Evil but someone who's
[1:49:51] unskillful with the word they never show
[1:49:53] you what uh unrighteousness is they just
[1:49:56] talk about you know all the the
[1:49:57] blessings and all these things like that
[1:49:59] they never talk about Sin and they never
[1:50:01] called out that's why we're peculiar
[1:50:03] people because we preach on the sin of
[1:50:05] that men commit like smoke and adultery
[1:50:07] and evil thoughts and movies and all
[1:50:10] this kind of non sports and all all
[1:50:12] kinds of Idols that rise up in people's
[1:50:14] lives we preach on women especially how
[1:50:16] they should dress and not be sexy
[1:50:18] dressed and all kinds of you know makeup
[1:50:20] and all kinds of things like that high
[1:50:21] heels and all kinds of things see
[1:50:23] because all that is lustful things and
[1:50:26] they Don't Preach against it so they
[1:50:27] don't so it shows they're in they're
[1:50:29] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[1:50:32] They Don't Preach a righteous life when
[1:50:33] the Bible says they shouldn't do those
[1:50:36] things all
[1:50:38] right so what's the millennial
[1:50:41] qualifications the M the millennial
[1:50:44] qualifications is to have the Holy Ghost
[1:50:46] right and to discern good and evil in
[1:50:49] your life that's why we come to church
[1:50:51] that's why we should always be Desiring
[1:50:52] more Church like I said one of these
[1:50:54] days I want to preach on the uh how to
[1:50:56] do social
[1:50:57] media uh because even that will show if
[1:51:01] someone's got the holy ghost or not your
[1:51:03] whole life shows whether you're born
[1:51:05] again social media only glorifies God
[1:51:08] when you glorify God with it amen right
[1:51:12] that's the only way it glorifies God I
[1:51:14] want to pre I preach to little kids out
[1:51:15] of my school about that I want to preach
[1:51:16] on here at some point I just want to lay
[1:51:18] it out through the scripture
[1:51:20] basically we're not to uh lust we're not
[1:51:23] to be angry we're not to criticize we're
[1:51:27] not supposed to complain on social media
[1:51:29] we're not supposed to uh we're not
[1:51:31] supposed to do anything sinful on social
[1:51:34] media we're still supposed to be
[1:51:36] thankful happy Holy Ghost filled
[1:51:38] Christians amen if you got a problem
[1:51:41] with somebody you go talk to them face
[1:51:42] to face don't do it on social media face
[1:51:45] to face that's right got a problem with
[1:51:48] anybody
[1:51:51] now let's go to uh Matthew
[1:51:55] 5 I am closing here just bear with me
[1:51:58] Matthew 5 last scripture I got for
[1:52:06] you look Matthew 5:3 let's look at the
