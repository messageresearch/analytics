TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to be here and uh we got a lot of stuff that we preach and we come in with a a full heart of expectation uh to see what lord does brother this one uh give me a second here get the right hook up here and uh i'm an inspiration preacher by god's grace some of you know that and uh i i come up here with stuff but uh yet if the lord would have uh would want to draw me in any way i want to be ready for that um you know one thing i'll say is we had brother jesse a few months ago at our assembly over in napoleon and we had just a wonderful time of fellowship in the word amen everybody happy to be christians this morning and you know uh in the old testament there was what they called the feast of pentecost and that feast they had a main requirement that you worship the lord right it said god gave israel that commandments that even if the strangers are here let them rejoice amen amen hallelujah so everything they have breath let them praise the lord amen hallelujah there ain't going to be no rock cry out for us amen no leaves uh to to blow in the breeze of the wind but what we'll receive the wind of the holy ghost and we'll let god know that we love him amen why because look at what his mercy did for us amen we all should be on a path to hell but oh god thank god for that word where he said he first loved us amen hallelujah so man we just appreciate the lord this morning i can say word afterward about your pastor my natural brother but yet uh more importantly my spiritual brother um and by the hand of god almighty uh we uh god allowed us to come out together and we have been pressing this battle for a long time fighting for the truth earnestly contending for the faith amen and uh that's uh where we're at amen so we sure are glad to be here i love my brother's ministry as goes without saying and uh just uh all the work that the lord's doing here we rejoice for it and uh got a brother over here i haven't met yet god bless you brother kim smith and uh anyway we just sure appreciate the lord and uh you know the way i am i kind of i don't mind just getting excited so just bear with me if you could so revelations 5 1. i come here and i have i do i purposely don't look at what your preacher's preaching i don't want to know that he told me over a text one time a while back he says he's preaching on doctrine of the devils i don't come here to speak any doctrines of devils i come here to speak the word of god and i pray that you'll find that that's the truth and uh anything i preach i make sure that you know we're we're we're studied up prayed up we're we're trying to find the mind of god and i and i i'm at a place where i'm past creeds and dogmas i understand what that's about i understand what it nickel aids and spirit's about and god's purpose for this hour is he's trying to get the laity in condition amen uh whether you know it or not that's you amen hallelujah uh remember in first corinthians 14 it says there that if the heathen and the unlearned if they would come into your assembly and all prophesy hallelujah and what the secrets of their heart would be made manifest that they would uh say of a truth you have god amen so those spiritual gifts that god's trying to get as laity he's trying to do that uh what in order to show not just that we're living good clean lives but he is in your midst amen not just to clean you up but to get you in service amen amen hallelujah amen so by uh the lord's leading i had some ideas but uh this is where we'll go today revelations 5 1 got another passage after this it says and i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders saith unto me wheat not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has prevailed to open the book and to loose the sea seven seals thereof and be i be held and low in the midst of the throne and the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain oh what a pristine moment amen having seven horns and seven eyes are you glad to be those seven horns today amen which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne there it is perhaps some of the most uh deeper doctrines that we could work with here i'm not here to do that i leave that to your pastor i don't want to i know what it's like to have somebody come here pulpit and they just kind of unpreach everything you preach so we're not here here to do that we're here to add a thought but this is the direction we'll go amen i mean i'm gonna love this you realize this is the most sublime portion of scripture the prophet said that's right when he took the book because remember he was going to take his possession well what's his possession what's he after he's after you he's after a bride all right one more spot and we'll get going i don't mean to keep standing ephesians 1 3 it says blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love amen having predestinated us unto the adoption of children just the preachers us everybody in that ephesians church you were predestinated to become the adoption of jesus christ amen glory amen hallelujah according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved when did he make you except in the blood and the beloved when he died on that cross for you amen well before that your name was on a book amen amen all right let's bow our heads for a word of prayer hallelujah our most beloved lord jesus christ we just as humbly as we know how god come this to this spot where we're just asking you to bless the reading of your word lord that you come down and see the needs of this people lord thou knowest oh god i i i don't have much to offer lord but all i have i'm just going to give to you lord you don't need my mind so take it oh god you don't need uh my mouth oh god but just take what i have and use it for your glory and lord let them realize that there's an amen in the laity today oh god and the more that they worship and love you the more you will inhabit your police of your people lord so may we see that lord and lord we're just asking that you just reveal these thoughts to the people here lord as uh you gave it to me so gently one day lord uh i'm looking for this word to be fulfilled lord and lord the church hears as well it's getting very dark uh sodom and gomorrah has encompassed this lord and now we're asking oh god just get us ready for this exodus in such a way oh god uh by the companionship that you offer to your children of the head uniting with the body of god and we're just asking over a positionally place your church oh god in the name of jesus christ we love you we ask you to have your way now as we say amen amen amen a little bit of a strange topic this morning but we have felt ready to come this direction i wish that's uh i know i would say this that uh if you have a need on your heart uh just keep on amen in the word keep on loving god sometimes god uh he'll come down and he'll answer your prayers he'll he'll move on you right i remember when i when uh when i started preaching there uh i was just up going and i'm an inspirational preacher by nature uh but i was up there just preaching away and things just started rolling out of my mouth i i i just started blasting i said shame on you people who who go to who come late to church because you want to go grocery shopping before church i just started nailing it and i just went on that rant it's been many years ago and anyway or after service i got done preaching and up comes this couple and they come up in front of me and they said we need prayer and i said well you need prayer for and said well we got a really bad habit i said what's that and they said uh remember you said something about people you know going grocery shopping trying to do everything before church yeah that was us they said in fact we were late tonight because we did it praise god but you know we have a type of god that does that thing does those things amen remember according to hebrews 4 12 that what his word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen so even today you've come to rejoice and worship jesus christ and yet how he answers back to your worship is he will come down and speak to you directly through the word of god amen and what doing that what he wants to do is he wants to hit the needs of your heart amen he wants to touch right where you're at if he if you're sad he wants to lift you up amen if you're frustrated he he purchased it at calvary and now the potential is unlimited amen it's us we've got to believe this word amen if we believe it remember your prophet said whatever you will become on this earth you'll do it by faith amen amen oh my lord or what you believe is it possible he said anything is possible amen if you believe now maybe they're saying those things standing at some picture and looking at a few things up here but i trust this will be a blessing to you yes we're going to go a little line here by the lord's grace the shared power of the signet all right man uh somebody say what's a signal you'll find out momentarily uh but uh we're just gonna bring this thought to you because how many believe that you're closer to your redemption than you've ever been amen amen amen it's drawing nine remember the bible says look up for your redemption draw at night right and we're in those moments right now where god is beginning to positionally place his people like never before how do you say that well if the world is coming to its fruit the serpents are becoming to one of serpentines remember the first serpent hybrid was a murderer that's right that's right hallelujah and what we're living in those days as the days of noah as the days of loss it's getting really dark but your prophet said that watch that when the challenges are harder god will raise a standard amen and lord he will come back what that evil is he said it required a greater thing he said in question answer 64 right so god provides it amen if you need a greater move he's here to give it amen amen because ultimately let's just jump to the end what he wants to do is give you a share of power now we just opened up with revelations 5. i'm not going to go very far here but i'm just going to set a little foundation and what this message has done for us it has revealed the opening of the seven seals amen yes hallelujah there he is and i would consider this the best rendering i can find but right there it is a seven sealed book and that was why in the hands of god almighty amen and watch there what i'd like you to see is here are seals on that scroll amen yes now remember as you see here there's an impression that needs to be made on that seal all right to make that and what they would do is this would be clay right here and while they would actually take a signet and press into it and then make an impression there all right now i'm doing this from uh for a reason because many of us you might be in the thought and say god uh i know by the scripture uh revelations 5 is something so phenomenal and it is but god is what painting a picture through the word of god to show us his plan the whole time all right now the way we'd like to begin this is to show you that that seal according to the prophet he said he said that the seal it actually shows a finished work all right so that seal that we seen right there it was on a scroll all right now somebody wrote that scroll amen and when they were done with it they put a shield on it and it would mean that it was finished completely amen and remember because he put the seal on it nobody could touch it until it went to the proper place to be opened amen yeah yeah we are going to get to a spiritual tie in a minute here but we find that what it secondly it shows ownership amen yes somebody owned that scroll amen yes hallelujah it was his and his alone together amen yes that's why oh if you thank god he doesn't say in revelations 5 it was jesus christ but when we see it was a bloody lamb the bride has the revelation it was jesus christ amen amen thirdly the seal it shows security that nobody can break that seal until the seal or the scroll would go to where it's supposed to go that's right hallelujah why are you saying all that because if you see on the spiritual context you know uh what god allowed that to be shown as ephesians 1 13 says in whom he also trusted oh i hope you've got some trust this morning amen after that he heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believed after you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise amen wait a minute you got to seal the book but yet he says you're sealed amen that means that he'll show an ownership over your [Applause] well how is god looking at you your prophet said when he put your name on the book you can see you no other way than what you were on that book [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] which he says which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession amen that's who you are they purchase you all right we're laying a foundation hallelujah the earnest which means the down payment the down payment was to seal you you have to have the revelation you're finished [Music] he's finished it at the cross of calvary amen you have to not only believe that you have to believe you're secure yes so when the bible says that he's the author of your faith we can get hung out there and say he's the author but he didn't only say that he said he's the finisher all right [Applause] amen amen so we see his desire is to make you full of revelation yes to know what truth is heard someone say here today in the message they said that the doctrine doesn't matter oh yes it does yes it does i disagree with that then why would god send the seventh angel right he sent the seventh angel to finish the mysteries according to revelations 10 7. that's right hallelujah so i say this god open the word ah amen glory so god gave you the holy ghost baptism or christ in you the hope of glory so that you would know who you are so many times in the message the prophet said you don't know who you are you've got to get away from all the fear and the scare amen i'm saying we've been listening this message for 50 years amen 60 years these things have been rolling on a lot of us a little bit too young for that but what you have caused it is trying to get you to believe that amen amen amen hallelujah so he shows that the book in heaven is the same and characteristic as what accompanies your life these principles i just lose everybody on that remember you're a finished product yes you got ownership security you got these things what wooing over your life waking up every morning and lord his mercies are renewed right you're waking up hey the bible says sorrow that's for a night but joy cometh in the morning amen that is the promise of [Applause] he said now those two great things now we're going to start first upon the seal of god now what is a seal the first place to see on the bible back in the days before people had educated like they are now they usually their seal was their signature just like we used today as our name sometimes the romans are and on back in jewish and way way back in the eastern early eastern countries they'd have a ring that had their seal and stamp it on something if they couldn't sign their name that seal a seal was a bonafide statement that was sealed by the seal nauseous and to try to copy this i'm going to go somewhere with that later but he said yeah was a capital fine ah just like it would be now to try to forge a check hallelujah you see you can't fake the seal yes you can't impersonate the seal amen there's a fine with that glory and usually the man wore it and had a seal worn on the back of his wrist or either on his ring and he would seal instead of signing his own name that was to show that it was he had sealed it all right yeah let's look at this real quick here this is why i love i'm gonna do some a little bit of a history lesson for a little archaeology and put right in there because you know there's people that still believe that there's no proof that israel was in that land but if you actually look at what they found and what they've been finding and what they continue to find there is an overwhelming amount of evidence that says that what is real that is her homeland amen right lord it ain't the palestinians it was given to god's people amen and someday the god of the jews will bring his gentile life and settle down there on mount zion amen yes glory there'll be a city 1500 miles by 1500 miles [Applause] [Applause] because there's a rapture that's coming for you [Applause] now watch this i got the writing here that's king jeroboam seal they found he did that i'd like to have my pocket and sure because that's pretty cool i think that's pretty cool then what they recently found hezekiah's yes amen found hezekiah seal now watch this the importance attached to seals in the east is so great that without one no document is regarded as authentic no seal it doesn't mean a thing that's right that's right good amen the use of some method of stealing obviously therefore or promote antiquity notice how great god is from before the foundation of the world he had a book that's right hallelujah yes and what he could want allow that to be a closed book to the people yes yes remember when your prophet preached the sales he said there was elijah he said he was the only one right and brother said it was that god took and broke one of those seals and revealed to elijah that there was actually seven thousand more amen all right brother nice good he opened the word to him amen show him where he was not alone but there were more like him in it oh let his body catch that mind amen there's not sinners sitting next to you but it is the one it is the work of grace the seeds of predestination of god sitting on you right next to me [Applause] some pretty nice king seals but now watch the seal is so important that if there wasn't a seal on it it didn't mean a thing people would people niche they say what's this about right you write a letter ain't gonna see online you give the lydia lady look at that she's from the east she said what's this that is from i don't know if that's from my uncle camera now there's no seal on that's how important then watch from the get-go god allowed the people of the earth to catch the revelation of a seal amen and begin to use it because he had a purpose in the book of revelations that he would reveal to his ending that's right amen glory oh mom that's right don't worry we're just warming up right now hallelujah now watch this where there's a good use of a seal they also these men who have caught the mind of god and used seals they've tried to do it falsely at times that's right they've tried to usurp authority where they did not have the ability to usurp authority perhaps a great example is matthew 27 62 it says now the next day that followed the day of preparation the chief priests and pharisees came together in the pilot saying sir we remember that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days that were raised again command therefore that the sepulcher be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he has risen from the dead so the last heir shall be worse than the first amen there was only one heir and that was on their side amen right but notice what are they doing they're trying to keep christ in the tube your prophet said that's what they've been trying to do all this time is to keep the body of christ in the tomb hold on right right hallelujah but he said they can't do it thank you so much said to them you have a watch go your way make it as sure as you can so they went and made this a poker shirt sealing the stone and sent a watch that seal was so important that they tried to put a roman seal to keep jesus in the tomb right right but remember he has the logos was not in that tomb at that time huh that's right the scripture says he went to the souls in hell that's right right he took the keys of death in hell i noticed he did have to come back why was that he had a dead body in the grave amen and satan was trying to show his authority through a roman seal there is no roman catholic seal that you have to accept that's right [Applause] we changed it but they had no authority to change it this is the book that has been opened [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he's alive when he broke the seals off of that tomb that's right he showed that there was no greater king than who he [Applause] is no was authority than who he was that's right remember according to history they would place roman centurions around there that seal was not hard to break it was easy to break right but they put it on there to show that if you mess with this seal you have to mess with the entire roman army right hallelujah they didn't keep christ in the grain they have a u.n they're going to have a new world order they can have all these things moving they can have lasers and supersonic vests and hypervent and hydrogen this it cannot keep the bride down they are created for [Applause] when the bride comes to redemptive promises amen hallelujah translated jesus cursed the fig tree he said you'll do it right he says say to the mountain and it'll be moved if you believe in you that's right we must know who we are sure there's nothing that can seal you in ain't no devil that can seal you in a lie or a creed or a dog amen or even this laodicea that's right right there's no devil strong enough to make you complacent you have to yield to it but if you yield to the hearing of the word faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word amen yeah glory then faith will come from you so what's possible right now anything amen but the question is he broke to release the body from the grave amen yes yeah that body is released that's why in the third seal there came that voice in the midst and said hurt not the oil in the lie right the devil cannot hurt it yeah you want the holy ghost it's yours amen it didn't work just like it did for peter while peter yes make these words the holy ghost [Music] gentile you have the [Applause] hallelujah we're very good at sealing christ away were they hallelujah looks like they failed greatly all right notice your type here in daniel 6 remember daniel type of christ and what they put daniel in the pit with the lions good notice what they did now remember this is a tie of what christ would do then the king commanded they brought daniel cast him in the dead of lions now the king spake and said unto daniel by god whom thy servants continuing well he will deliver thee that's why jesus said destroy this temple in three days [Applause] [Applause] yes you know the prophet said the holy ghost is a positive force if he's here he's here to be positive he's here to make you more lonely he's here to make you feel more like a failure right he's here to turn your attention to his word why is that because you are a part of that word amen let this mind be in you that was in christ jesus exactly who being in the form of god thought in that robbery to be equal with god because i'll tell you whether you see it or not you've got to stay right there with the purchase power of that blood and say it's mine amen yes oh my i got some stuff tonight man help us to finish this baby but we'll go there or we'll go somewhere if the lord wants i don't know so what a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the net they put a stone over where they placed christ yes and the king sealed it with his own signet the king himself now notice the word and he came out and put a seal on it himself he sealed him with a secret and with the signal of his lords that the purpose might not be changed concerning daniel notice there was king of persia persia and they still had no ability and being the the dominion of power on earth at that time to seal daniel in amen because notice they were trying to make a purpose sure the devil has a purpose that he has for you too but oh praise the living god because we had a prophet that tells us that revelations 13 16 will come yes right there is a squeeze that is coming but when that squeeze hits it'll only manifest that which you are that's right brother that's right amen we're there going to a mark of the beast you have the seal of god already in there [Applause] to the third paul that are yours that's right right there with brother keith randolph last night and he said brother cam he said oh i just lost my train of thought he said brother cam there are people oh where's that thought at help me lord third poll yep five manchester there are people that believe that the third poll is only for brother branham no way no he said they believed that third poll is only for brother raymond i said what did they do with the quote he said he said that that there will be five identification the third fourth to help the church out in that time he said brother cam i don't know and i said here's the thing that gets me brother i said what is the third poll what is it right he's like well brother and i said i just jumped in it does not do my turn and i said it was the opening of the word yes the only thing that the third pole is is the opening of the heart which actually releases all of it right yes well wait a minute are you the wire he said you are part of that word that's right right brother that's right so the opening of the word that third poem must have an identification with you right yes because you are the word to be opened in this right it is went from the prophet to the prophecy amen yes it had to go from moses to joshua jehovah's savior take the people in to the land of what unconditionally overcoming all things glory see they've got a fate for you you're not in the plan they've already started depopulating right but they don't realize they're only getting in god's picture right brother because the bible says you'll walk on the ashes of the wicked that's right brother right yes yeah right oh but you'll not see it amen you will be in that great marriage suffer the land for three and a half years it doesn't matter what they have put you in that's why don't pay all that attention to the news that's right well there's gonna be a food shortage your father owns a cattle a thousand gallons that's right amen i think you bring a cow pie for you hallelujah he'll bring ravens ephesians he's that type of god amen he will take care of the election she was getting ready to die and all she did was watch seen a gentile prophet come that's right he said take care of me first that's right and god will take care of you that's right so she did that she made him watch out of the meat on the oil she made him a of a biscuit if i said it like that and then he said he said what thus saith the lord the meal will not run dry the oil will not dry amen until the falling out [Applause] he said he would take care of you until the latter rain it's real you want me to swear [Music] [Applause] oh i'm so dry maybe you're not taking care of that word of the prophet right brother right glory see it wasn't the man it was the message yeah that's right yeah right oh my all right let's get to where we're going so what made that seal so notice there's really only one seal that has any power god showed that he would destroy all it doesn't matter if they are the king world or the world's king powers he would destroy it their seals were nothing from them what made that seal we shown we showed you what the seal was but now we're going to show you what a signal was the segment was actually they would have an artificer of brass gold whatever it was and they'd have them generally uh speaking they'd have to make a ring and in that ring there'd be all sorts of little dents in there i preached this at home and they for the youth group little youth group they they made little seals for their cygnus from there it was pretty cool hallelujah but what when that man become a king they'd have a seal made up for so that whatever his will or a sickness made form so that whatever his will was they would bring a writing to him and read it over yeah that's what i want and he'd seal it yes with a signet why there's authority of royalty behind that seal going somewhere oh amen that's right anyway so there they have king ahabs his signet then we have king jotham's there is his signet there is his seal for the camp where are you going with all this this is powerful we gotta get got to have you hold on i'm showing you pictures so you get the mind of this yes okay yeah cause i want you to see it who was the one that had this the signet first that made seals gone yeah it's god's word well god's he's fully done with everything the book that was sealed and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah we better just look through the scriptures a little bit and see how these things go right all right so this signal ring it says belonging to josh jotham and with the picture of a typical asuazi sheep it's pretty neat they get whatever that symbol was of what they wanted their kingdom to stand for right there hey man that's something so the seal will be a representation of what the king stands for glory watch us you love the bible are you amen amen that guy 220 and again the word of the lord came into haggai in the 4th and 20th day of the month saying speak to zerubbabel the disperser of confusion governor of judah saying i will shake the heavens and the earth and i will overthrow the throne of the kingdoms and i will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen i will overthrow the chariots and those that ride in them and the horses and the riders shall come down every one by the sword of his brother talk about destruction in that day saith the lord of hosts will i take thee o zerubble my servant the son of shalthya saith the lord and will make thee as a signet amen i'm gonna make you that for i have chosen thee saith the lord of hosts we're getting ready to turn a little spiritual direction here so there he was he wasn't the king this rule but he was what he was a disperser of confusion yes yes god said i'm overthrown and you are my sickness why because he was a chosen vessel to do it amen look at the commentators say and i'll make thee as a signal i will exalt thee to high dignity power and trust look at that you get that he's now placing zerubbabel showing he's high dignity amen and god amen high power and god yes i trust from god to him of which the seal was the instrument or sign in those days thou shalt be under my peculiar care wow oh my god and shall be to me very precious hallelujah i thought that was just in revelations 5 but the seal and the segment go all the way back because god is his word amen amen i'm gonna show you a purpose today notice i will make thee as a sickness you mean god could make a man as a saint this man's rule was a disperser of confusion glory oh hallelujah amen then you know that's not just preachers but your life should disperse confusion amen sisters confusion walking down the streets it's women without clothes on that's right man right women wearing all that sick stuff they do nowadays but you know what that's confusion because they're off the word but your life oh hallelujah walking down the streets with a long hair long dress manage the pal you are dispersing the confusion yes hallelujah amen that's right brothers walking down the streets not wearing ladies bloomers i don't want my kids wearing i don't care what what what the brandons did i don't care any of that hallelujah i got people i know that let their kids wear and now the parents are struggling very difficult because now they want to keep wearing it they want to keep playing basketball or whatever in high school and wear shorts and do all that stuff they say it was never wrong before why would it be wrong now today i didn't either hallelujah right just like women wearing pajama pants right brother yep said somebody from the church go to the big camp they said there's only like three sisters that they've seen that didn't have pajama pants on oh my goodness the sisters were trying to justify they said well this is actually more holy because we're more covered huh wow it's crept in the message right brother you know what i say to that if you think that's okay you come to me after church i'm gonna get you a skirt brother and i want you to wear this skirt to bed that's right that's right brother don't worry i'm gonna get you a nice flowery one too nice colors all up here oh hey sister ladies and the donating printer now glory of god says wonderful but that right there will disperse your confusion but it's these corrupt preachers that go into law and they try to say something's alright i don't know why i'm saying this but i am right amen they okay it for them but they themselves don't do it right brother they're hypocrites yes sir doctrines are devils amen that's right amen oh but somebody's got to disperse this if they confusion god will make them as a savior hearing the power of god the trust of god the truth of god lord god will make them as he is yes who was going to make them as a signet goggles mad now watch i might take a little turn now no one more i'll do it i'll take it i'm gonna be quick here oh good genesis 41 41 pharaoh said to joseph see i have set thee over all the land of egypt watch us and pharaoh took off his ring or his signet i just ate a cupcake that had a plastic one on it i could be doing the doing a little showing you officially it was a little plastic ring had a popsicle on it i was like i should probably save this for something i didn't know what i was preaching yet pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon joseph's hand watch us because we would want identify a signet with a king but watch as this king takes his sediment off and puts it on the hand of joseph amen who is at his right hand which was a type of the father granting the positional placement to jesus christ yes a random investors of lyndon put a gold chain about his net and he made him the ride in the second chair which he had and they cried before him by the knee and he made him rule over all the land of egypt wow it's all about jesus now isn't it amen glory yes he is the king that father had a son a manifestation of a son of man and what after he come forth he said when they saw him they worshipped him some doubt it and jesus came and spoke and i'm saying all power is given unto me in heaven and earth all power was given in unto him all the power yes watch this we'll just say it right here in matthew 17 you have the transfiguration you see it actually happened before the crucifixion that things settled in with christ and jesus christ had lived such a perfect sinless lot not just before the dove came on him but in his ministry so that hearing my transfiguration he could get caught up and watch manifest the coming of the lord but also a bright cloud overshadowed them and beheld a voice of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him amen brother brandon preach that message like 20 times anymore and you know he's really only talking about himself probably oh wait we know better than that that's right i wonder brother cam where are you going with this watch us so god will actually what we say like this so royalty in actuality can actually entrust who they are with someone else amen amen watch this here it is they found another seal it says edina yahoo son of king david king david had so much trust dignity and power as far as looking at his son then yahoo that he would give him a signet so that he could seal as the king did hey man amen hallelujah hallelujah they just found this one this seal translates to belonging to nathan malek servant of the king josiah the king couldn't do all the business himself that's right so the king would find entrusted people in his kingdom that he could what make to have a signet where they could have the authority of the caring and use it amen yes praise god we see this and look at this authority that is given right good what happens when authority is given to evil to the evil and the king took off his ring from his hand and gave it unto haman the son of amadetha the again the jews enemy and the king said unto haman the silver is given to thee the people also to do with them as it seemeth good to thee ma then the kings were the king's scribes called on the 13th day of the first month and there's written according to all that haman had commanded under the king's lieutenants and to the governors that were over every prophets and to the rules of every people of every province according to writing thereof and to every people after their language in the name of king of zurich was it written and sealed with the ring you mean in the natural a man could look so good to the king that they could actually receive the authority of the king and still be a serpent right hallelujah we've been watching it you think all these people that run the world are message believers they have been given an authority right now you say the king controls it or the devil he said these are his kingdoms sure but you realize that the devil can't do anything without approaching god that's exactly right brother yes he standeth day and night before god accusing the brethren hallelujah because what his ultimate goal is what he's after you right right notice so what did he do it's mine he got the authority of the king and it was good he could do anything just like it was the king's will so now he wants to kill god's people right we know how that worked out but notice remember power without character is satanic right but character with power is fixed to rule you say why i need that power in my life because god if you're his son he's got to see the character amen hallelujah hey if other people are getting anointed if other people though they're the ones that got to be means who cares right let them deal with it because you'll find that if it's if it's what if it's somebody with the wrong character given power they'll do the wrong thing that's right brother that's right hallelujah that's why i said well oh brother brother jesse why isn't my church bigger why isn't your church bigger we should be so big brother braham said he said he said don't expect this to get bigger and bigger wow he said expect it to get smaller and smaller all the time another quote he said while coming to the headstone it will come down to a very pinpoint that's right right hallelujah i don't care what's big i just want to stay with him amen because this message was sown for a purpose and that is to what jesus said in john saint john 14 12 he said the works that i do shall ye do and greater work shall ye do because i go to the father amen amen amen he wants you to do the same works and greater but do you think he's going to give it to you before you're ready for it no sir uh-uh but i'll tell you what he will i'll happen he'll allow the evil to come with the power of a saint that's right right brother watch us well jeremiah had a problem he kept warning them tell them to go to babylon tell them do this don't do that and they would never listen to him as i live saith the lord though coniah the son of jehoiakim king of judah were the signet upon my right hand yet would i pluck thee dance i gave you that power and i'll give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life and at the hand of them whose face thou fierce even in the hand of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and then the hand of the chalians he could what grant people authority but it wouldn't be until they're good right amen i don't know about you but this is the day of false anointed ones right what brother branham said and anointed once at the end time he said and it couldn't happen until after the opening of the scene so the seals would release that that's why i'm saying it with the sea of the elected if it was possible that's right you've got to give it the word test hey man oh you know you're talking about bad people yeah i gotta show you the bad so i can show you that good yes sir watch this in the enzyme 62 1 19 brother brandon saying here in the old country old times the seal was usually a ring a man that couldn't sign his name just had a ring he sealed it his ever what he wrote why he just instead of signed his name he put the seal on it it was a penitentiary offense to ever copy that seal yes look at this now today god has a seal and it's a penalty of death to copy that seal and listen you luther methodists presbyterians right and pentecostals and might i add message right don't try to copy it you've got to have christ in his order amen don't tell me that that the the message is the absolute right the bible's the absolute yeah [Applause] that brother said the message is the absolute come my church preached it the crazy thing was before he got up and preached at my church i went back there and it just started rambling on my mouth i'm like you know this bible is the absolute it was coming out of my mouth like what is going on here i mean i guess i'm just gonna do it is this check on common said i said hallelujah this ain't no blipping a prophet this is the message and the message is jesus christ that's right brother right message is the bible amen he said no well he said and he's kind of stood at me like this the whole time and then later he comes up this is a young brother and he just blasted that the message of the absolute he said he said don't you think that brother branham's opinions are better than yours he said his opinions are bad and i said his opinions and i'm just sitting here listening this whole thing i'm like what's going on and after the service i'm like did he do what i think he did he sure did and i called him out on that i said i said well here's here's the thing brother i said brother graham's opinions are better than ours and we better all start driving forwards that's right his opinions very much well not that one i said oh oh i went through several other examples and he said well that's just what i believe i'm like i don't care you believe you better study it up yeah say where's the quote there's no quote that brother branham says the message is the absolute right brother branham says the messenger she said jesus christ he said he is a messenger that's right but not what every word on 1200 sermons or as i find with these brothers now whatever they want to call is truth and whatever they want to call is the message right is what is the message and it is a doctrine of the devil all right brother amen amen so i looked it up and brother branham he said he said my opinion in 64. he said my opinion is no better than the janitors [Applause] today [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] a bunch of parents right god help me because you know i'm not in this the cycle anymore right amen and you know what that shows it's a denominational devil all right i just said it on youtube and it's a truth hallelujah people need to repent and get right they're doing the same thing that they blasted jefferson about that's right jeffersonville that's right hallelujah what can be anointed preachers they say 99 true but they're not going to a messy new birth right they're not getting to a place that the word has preeminence in them brother branham said we've got to take it back to the word yes [Applause] hallelujah show me where john the baptist said everything i say is thus saith the lord right he then he's seen christ coming and he said behold the lamb of god that taken away the sins of the world and the bible says in john 1 that the two that were following him left him and followed the word amen this prophet delivered you to the word [Applause] but you've got to have cracks on the inside [Applause] [Music] people don't want to get messy anymore that's right they'll say oh don't make me sick i'm good enough hold on you got to get messy that's right 59 brother graham said he said he said a new birth is messy he said every now and then he said i get to boohoo and crying that's when it comes on me it's not just one birth you can't live on yesterday's experience you've got to have a new one for today that's right he gave them manna every day [Music] so what do i got to do don't try to copy it i'll say well this is what the church does i guess i'll do that get christ on the inside all right if you've got enough faith to do that do that but don't trust that don't trust your legalism right trust only a com a communication and relationship with christ that is vindicated by staying with every word of the bible amen amen search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have life and they are this must testify hallelujah hold still we gotta do hold still hold still and god will put it on you amen yes and then you'll be an ensign example of christianity and manhood and womanhood the seal of the holy spirit god's inside press into you till your look act walk yes talk the gospel everywhere you go [Applause] thank you jesus hallelujah no copies here the gospel god come all right all right watch again we won't read this they found jezebel's team oh my goodness on that woman right now suffers jezebel to preach so what when it came down to the vineyard of naboth jezebel's wife said in him does thou now govern the kingdom of israel arise eat bread and let that in the heart be merry i will give you the vineyard of naboth the jezreel so she wrote letters in ahab's name she was copying his what his word as if it was hers and sealed them with his seal i might have come to this because they found her seal too and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city dwelling with nevada and she killed him didn't you that's right she would use now notice this when the serpent seed get a hold of the authority of the sickness they try scripturally we seem to destroy the people of god that's right what do you think they're going to do if your pastor stands for the truth they're going to try to destroy him shame on them they need to repent that's right why don't they search out the bible instead of calling the brother on the phone hallelujah right that's what i do i don't believe everything everybody believes i say you search it out right study this out because you see authority in the wrong position you're gonna be destroyed right when she did this elijah comes out and says the dogs are gonna lick your blood up notice with hormone him getting authority brought what he was trying to destroy the elect but it actually came to destroy him yeah that's right that's right jezebel to destroy the elect but the sickness she used would be what would come back to her from the message of a prophet and what caught her demise amen all right that's why we got satan's even the message that's why we got anointed once at the end time because god is giving everyone an equal shot to see what is true authority it's coming down to this you better get ready for power you better get ready for a closer walk with god because there is meal and oil for you amen hallelujah come on brother sister i know we get tired they get tired in my church too look up the message you ever looked up the message brother answered you get tired he said it's a devil getting on you yes well i put you on a go-kart get you riding down the road you ain't gonna fall asleep on your go car right i'll put you in a buffet line you'll sit there for two hours i'm not condemning you i'm trying to show you where we're at all right we wake up and realize that the word is actually bringing you to heavenly places hearing the word it makes you say amen god heals [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i'm an extrovert or introvert excuse me i'm an introvert i'm really quiet i don't say a lot i tried my wife nuts she's a sweetheart put up with me i'm just really quiet but when i get the anointing on me you see it i can't sit still and i can't shut up right and i thought myself a while back and like if the church could only get in a spot that they could carry the anointing just like that because whether you believe it or not there's a holy ghost not just at the pulpit right there's a holy ghost that's trying to amen inside of you you know the holy ghost can amen so much inside of you that god can fill this place with the glory of the lord amen and you'll shut the preacher up that's right yes i had a man come to my church a few years ago he was coming to my church and i told the story here already but i'll tell the gangsters coming my mind and he come to my church and anyways his first time visiting as far as i know and uh anyway he's sitting in the pew and i can't remember if i was preaching what was going on but i wasn't i wasn't backed by him i was up in the pulpit doing something but anyway my wife was across the road from she's seen all this and that brother he was crying and weeping and raising his hands and just enjoying whatever was going on there i can't remember that's how great my memory is but anyway he came up and testified me after church he said he said i was weeping he said so much he said and i looked through my glasses and said couldn't see through i'm like man i am crying so hard that my glasses have fogged up because of the presence of god so moving on yes he said then he pulled his glasses off to wipe him and he looked at their glass his glasses and there was nothing on him and he looked back up and he seen the cloud in the church that's right amen amen oh hallelujah but i'll tell you if you get in the same condition you'll see it today you'll see it when the pastor preaches the ephesians [Applause] hallelujah all right i got to hurry up all right so i showed you what that happens with the evil on that day did the king aziris give the house of haman the jews enemy unto esther the queen and mordecai came before the king for esther had told what he was unto her watch this now look at the transfer that's going on haman is sent to the gallows because he misused the authority yes talk about the binding of the tares yes amen it's gonna be so close it would deceive the elected but watch the king took off his ring when she had taken from her mom and give it unto mordecai and esther set mordecai over the house of haman so the picture was what to bring forth the authority in the right spot amen remember ahmad had the king's sign that all the jews would die that's right but before that he misused the authority and it killed him watch out these people messing with israel right now there's 144 000 thousand two prophets getting ready to rise out hallelujah now watch eighth verse right he also he's saying the mordecai chance you're saying the mordecai uh right also for the jews doesn't like with you in the king's name and seal the king's ring for the writing which is written in the king's name and sealed with his kingdom made no man reverse hallelujah and he wrote king of zero's name and sealed it with the king's ring sent letters posts on on horseback and riders and mules campbells and young dromedaries and wearing the king granted the jews which are in every city to gather themselves together and stand for their life yes oh just stand up you know and just fight to destroy to slay to cause to perish all the power of the people and province that would assault them both literally and women to take the spoil of them for pray and they were they were given the king's weapons too see when the righteous receive the authority it goes to the abundance of god's people it moves them where they might be put in a squeeze god provides a way for them to get out amen amen glory but what was it it was when the false got what they lost their authority because there's a transition that's right it's all heading out hallelujah amen hallelujah i watch you i'm almost done hold on just say yes his name i'm gonna jump to the bottom here it is because this is what i'm trying to show you look what your prophet said remember he preached all those hearing him messages why his name was was just oh no no i got to go up it says and when he did i'm going to go halfway oh yeah and when he did that son's name after that was just as good as the father's name on the check or whatever his signature them days was a seal a ring because many of them couldn't ride it was a penetration effect never copied that seal and they had to on the back of that ring they would mash it like that and he could wear his father's ring amen all right why his name was just as good as the father's one now that's what god's trying to get his church to yes he wants you to have the senate he wants you to what carry all the power of the name of god yes to a place that where we are sons and daughters of god see but we we're troubled are you troubled he said that's a hindrance yes to why you can't wear the father's ring we're letting everything and now the world trying to smother the real thing down it's trying to smother you down more now than what it was to them then right is trying to make people scared of communism right brother right what's going on right now they're trying to take your constitution away that's right they're trying to bring you to communism don't all right don't be misled don't don't don't you bust up a a trump 2024 hat and then start showboating in the church right i'll take that back you're free to do whatever you want but would you wear a papa smurf shirt or pop a smurf hat no sir this guy cusses and swears left and right right brother life right god bless him i thank god for what he did but we'll put no trust in any king that's right amen we put our trust in the lovely lord jesus christ amen hallelujah there's only one superman you can have we don't need satan superman we need god amen amen because he's trying to get you in position right don't worry about communism because all that means if they're trying to put communism on you god's trying to put his ring on [Applause] now just almost done they had to ring them days a sign a signet and they'd they'd spit on it place it there's a cigarette just as good uh he wore his father's ring a signet that was just as good as his daddy's now jesus had been obedient jesus to god god placed him positionally this is him now when the member is born by the holy ghost into the family of god and has proven to have these virtues in it that god can see virtue knowledge tempers patients run kind of scholars in him yes then god seals him or places him and there that's when you see the son's daughters hallelujah remember the same and statutory it he said you'd be living moving idols that's right right you know they tried to worship paul was it paul silas uh mercurus and jupiter right they tried to call you god but the only thing you can do is praise god yeah so we're just men like you let me point you out jesus christ amen amen amen amen so who is god trying to get to where sinners you yes what clothes right here remember judah and tamar yes tama she had to what play the harlot to get the promised seed that god had for which was in the sea lion the promised seed line but notice this she wanted to what have the seed of judah just like we want the seed of the lion of the tribe of judah right to manifest from us amen impregnated by the word right right so notice she required a token of judah for the proof of the prayer nature amen and he said i was sending a kid from the flock she said will thou give me a flesh till thou send and he said what place shall give thee and she said thy sickness my braces my staff is in the head and he gave it her and it came under her and she conceived by him she wanted the yes she wanted judah's authority yes so not only was judah willing to give it but she was calling for the pledge of the segment amen that's right [Applause] just remember it concealed that way it was the proof of that he can trust you with his word that's right power behind it amen there's deliverance behind it there was strength behind it listen hallelujah a little bit we started late we went as fast as we could all right that's why jesus gave you all these look at promises what was the simpsons and said jesus said on the peace be on you and my father sent me so i sent you when he had said this he breathed on them saying let him receive you the holy ghost whosoever sins you remember made it unto them and whosoever sends you retain their return right good good i told you i was gonna see why they try to put it all way back there but jesus says for those that believe that's right oh god he has desires he has desired this church to come and to hear ye in character 50 60 years moving trying to get the church in condition because you see you might see yourself as little and significant but that's not the way he sees you that's right amen you realize john there's no no man born greater women than john the baptist that's right but then then jesus said but but all these that receive the holy ghost he's not even under them do you know what that is supposed to receive the holy ghost that's right that's right amen hallelujah hey times are dark but that don't mean you're gone that's right times might be tiring what the devils think they love you can change laws and times to wear out the saints yeah you can't be worn out he's saying who's going to look at the word i'm not quitting i'm not stopping right i'm going to believe this word amen amen change me by this word amen they don't see that stature of a perfect man right there in me here amen amen hallelujah because he's looking for that character being you yeah because what he wants you to act it walk it live it everybody's gonna see it hey man amen you're not defeated this church is not defeated it makes all things possible amen you mean brother can't go long-winded and god can still do anything absolutely absolutely because it's where you believe right that's why that's why they try and every way to to weaken you down by processed foods by by lack of sleep by stress by everything like that they're trying to wear you down but you don't have to take that yeah that's right amen i can't tell you how many times the dog puts up on me i say return to sender it's not because i'm great it's not because of anything good god just doesn't yeah i don't work the other day and my wife texts me she said she said pray for me she said i got this and this this going on said the devil tried to attack her body physically and i i put the phone down

heard from heaven praise god two beautiful thoughts there god wants to put the seal on you he wants you to be sealed to the day of your redemption praise god but then he wants to put you on as a sickness praise god he wants to use you your humble little mortal life and he wants you to exercise his authority in the amen speak to the mountain and it will move praise god and put that authority in other words speak god's word and watch god back it up amen you and i can't speak anything unless he's spoken to us first that's right and he's waiting for the character like our brother said he's waiting for godly character like i told you on wednesday night every day he wants to see him express that character every day and then those moments those special moments he's going to put you on as a ring and he's going to seal something he's going to put his authority into something in your life and god is going to speak his word and you're going to see god move through your life hey we saw it a few wednesday nights ago when i had uh naomi and hua come up and pray for our kids they put the authority down the spirit of uh horror movies is not going to get in this family we put the authority down in jesus name [Music] i know god heard that prayer the holy spirit fell right there on the wednesday night i love how he falls on wednesday night no matter it's wednesday night sunday morning sunday night it don't matter when god wants to put his authority down on a situation he puts his word in your mouth amen that's right hallelujah such a beautiful picture brother definitely the holy spirit hallelujah he wants to put his seal on your life he's sealing it all that treasure and earth and vessels baby he seals the presence of god he seals all those attributes hey he yeah all that authority all that anointing anointing all the treasure he seals it in there to the day of your redemption hallelujah and then he wants to put that he will put you on his finger praise god and he wants to seal out his authority over situations in your life right pray for the sick like that caring woman in jesus name she's healed see putting the authority down praise god amen this is thus saith the word of god and we might not say it but we believe it praise god amen prophets how many believe that by god's grace glory church if you need prayer i want you to come up here if anyone needs prayer whether it's for the baptism holy ghost to put god's seal on your life if you're surrendered to god or if you need any other prayer you need the authority of god in your life that's what that message that's so glorious this is the word he hands that over yes he hands it over to the enemy but then he hands it over also to the bride esther get it the ancestor gets that authority praise god mordecai gets that authority church when you need god's authority in your life that's why the king is here praise god yeah the king is here to use us to speak god's word hmm like brother said one word from god one authority one seal from god one word from god is more valuable than ten thousand in other words that's right god would speak one word praise god how many
