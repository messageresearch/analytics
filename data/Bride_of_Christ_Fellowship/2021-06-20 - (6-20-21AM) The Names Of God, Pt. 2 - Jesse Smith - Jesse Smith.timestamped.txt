[7:04] so we love you buddy love all the saints
[7:06] here god bless our fathers and
[7:09] so thankful for all they do so let's
[7:11] take a few scriptures here i'd like to
[7:13] you know just i'll just start with a
[7:14] little bit on father's day i do have
[7:15] some slides here
[7:16] so you can pull it up but before we get
[7:18] to the names of god let's just look at a
[7:19] few scriptures
[7:20] let's go let's start with proverbs 17
[7:22] verse 6 i kind of do like a short little
[7:24] bible study on
[7:25] just some father scriptures that came to
[7:26] my heart as i was
[7:28] preparing you yesterday i was preparing
[7:30] i wasn't thinking anything about
[7:30] father's day i
[7:32] was really not on my radar it's not my
[7:34] that that holiday is not my
[7:35] responsibility so i don't have to
[7:37] worry about that one too much um anyways
[7:39] i just had a few thoughts about father's
[7:41] day
[7:41] this scripture has been uh really
[7:43] astounding to me proverbs 17 verse 6
[7:46] and i don't have a slide for it that's
[7:48] okay so i'll just read it
[7:50] one time i had some gift cards to a
[7:52] christian bookstore you know sometimes
[7:54] the parents of my students give me gift
[7:55] cards
[7:56] i was looking for a new king james bible
[7:58] and i walked in there at a 50
[8:00] gift card and i come across the bible
[8:03] and on the front it had this scripture
[8:05] proverbs 17 verse 6
[8:08] and it's like the father's bible so i
[8:10] really like it it's still one of my
[8:11] favorite
[8:12] bibles i have at home it says children's
[8:15] children are
[8:18] the crown of old men
[8:22] right so the grandchildren are a crown
[8:26] for the fathers god bless our
[8:27] grandfathers amen there's your crown
[8:29] brother look at that beautiful crown
[8:30] there
[8:31] three jewels on that crowd and that
[8:32] beautiful jose how many grandchildren
[8:34] you got brother
[8:36] [Laughter]
[8:39] my mom and dad got 24 grandchildren so
[8:42] so that that's their crown but have you
[8:44] counted brother lately all you
[8:46] your parents grandchildren okay so you
[8:48] can do that while i'm preaching here
[8:49] then
[8:50] then you can tell me no i'm just kidding
[8:53] but you can if you want
[8:57] so it's a great crown you know our
[8:59] grandchildren
[9:00] and the glory of children
[9:04] are their fathers now that means
[9:07] ornament
[9:08] or honor so children have a
[9:12] extra dose of honor on them from their
[9:15] fathers
[9:16] and of course that's conditional right
[9:18] so however much they
[9:19] they dedicate to the lord their lives
[9:22] that much honor
[9:24] will be on their children praise god
[9:28] and so i just thought i'd share that you
[9:30] know that's what the bible had on the
[9:32] front as soon as i saw that i'm like oh
[9:33] it's like a leather black bible but it's
[9:34] got this brown strip down the middle
[9:36] like a ribbon
[9:37] and it said the glory of children are
[9:39] their fathers and i'm like as soon as i
[9:41] saw that i said that one's mine
[9:43] i knew it was in the king james section
[9:45] i just read it and it's been a great
[9:47] help to me that's where i got that
[9:48] picture of you know jordan
[9:49] a picture of jordan for joshua you know
[9:51] of the big river there
[9:53] that's kind of where i got that picture
[9:54] from uh so i just want to just
[9:56] express that to you that you know some
[9:58] of our fathers have been
[10:00] attacked by the enemy and may not have
[10:02] served god as well as we'd like them to
[10:04] be i mean i would
[10:05] i managed to imagine we'd have many
[10:07] hands go up if we asked this morning
[10:09] if we said how many wish their fathers
[10:11] would have served the lord you know we
[10:13] my hand would have went up first you
[10:14] know but uh
[10:17] but you know god is the great redeemer
[10:19] and ultimately
[10:20] it's the heavenly father who puts his
[10:22] glory on us
[10:24] because the bible said the mystery was
[10:26] hid from ages
[10:27] christ in you the hope of glory
[10:32] so even if our fathers maybe didn't have
[10:34] a heart to serve the lord or
[10:36] or you know were given over to the
[10:38] snares of the devil
[10:40] if we respond to the heavenly father's
[10:42] call then he puts a measure of glory on
[10:45] us
[10:46] praise god and then we as fathers right
[10:49] bang and jose and william and i
[10:51] we can pass on that blessing that god
[10:53] has given us
[10:54] we can pass on the blessing and wisdom
[10:57] the anointing
[10:58] on to them as well praise god because
[11:00] remember the fathers and
[11:02] brother bang we have to preach on this
[11:03] pretty soon the fathers can bless their
[11:05] children remember that
[11:07] right jacob did it you know abraham
[11:09] isaac
[11:10] fathers have such a power to bless their
[11:13] children
[11:14] so i want to preach on that sometime i
[11:16] did a little bit one time but
[11:17] i want to get under the anointing and
[11:19] pray for my children sometime
[11:21] and bless them with the blessings of god
[11:24] because they have such an ability
[11:26] of course mothers can do we know that
[11:28] right with rebecca really helping jacob
[11:30] a lot right
[11:30] remember because isaac liked esau more
[11:33] so god really anointed right
[11:35] uh a rebecca there to really bless jacob
[11:38] and favor him right and
[11:39] and point him in the right direction so
[11:42] we know mothers have a special place as
[11:44] well
[11:45] but we want to uh just remember that the
[11:48] glory
[11:49] of children are their fathers
[11:52] so you know when people we had somebody
[11:54] yesterday at the uh gas stations
[11:56] commented on my children and i said well
[11:59] all the
[11:59] credit goes to mother you know for that
[12:02] but
[12:02] you know like brother adam said you know
[12:04] give all the credit to my wife nida
[12:06] that's true but part you know but also
[12:08] there's a part the father plays no doubt
[12:10] as well right so
[12:11] fathers humbly say that but uh
[12:14] there's a special blessing that goes
[12:16] upon the children
[12:18] and they wear that so when someone
[12:20] compliments your children
[12:22] i'm speaking to the parents you can
[12:24] thank the lord for that that god has
[12:26] used you you've surrendered to god
[12:28] and god has allowed you to surrender and
[12:31] the blessings that are on your life have
[12:33] transferred actually over onto your
[12:35] children praise god
[12:37] the bible actually calls it translated
[12:39] when you're in christ
[12:40] you're translated into the kingdom of
[12:43] his dear son amen
[12:44] hallelujah the the kingdom is the
[12:47] rulership or the dominion
[12:49] so when you have dominion over satan and
[12:51] you have the power of the holy spirit
[12:53] and you teach your children the same
[12:55] that same power of dominion over satan
[12:58] goes on your children amen hallelujah
[13:01] i think about it even today think about
[13:03] you know i think about my life and
[13:05] if if we get to baptize victoria today
[13:07] think i think i have my children have
[13:09] been what age do you
[13:10] get baptized at malachi and lydia you
[13:12] remember
[13:14] okay should you remember the age you got
[13:15] baptized seven
[13:17] my point is that it's really a lot
[13:19] younger than me
[13:21] i i felt the pull at 16 i got baptized
[13:24] but felt it right away
[13:25] because i wasn't strong enough i wasn't
[13:27] as sincere as i should have been
[13:29] i think my if they're coming to the lord
[13:31] at five at seven i think karis was five
[13:34] if i'm not mistaken
[13:36] amen i think you were five or six or
[13:38] something like that
[13:40] and i think mine my prayers let the
[13:43] glory of god
[13:44] rest on them praise god
[13:47] my humble little devotion to the lord my
[13:50] my sincerity to try to serve him and
[13:52] and be his humble servant i just pray
[13:54] that this scripture
[13:55] that god fulfills the scripture because
[13:57] it's god's promise not mine right we
[13:59] can't give anybody anything
[14:00] but if we keep god's laws he keeps his
[14:03] promises and he blesses
[14:04] our children and the glory of god rests
[14:07] upon our children
[14:08] when we honor god amen that's the
[14:11] promise
[14:12] right uh we see the blessing of of of
[14:15] the
[14:16] father as he's serving god it goes to
[14:19] the children praise god
[14:20] now here's one i just want to say i this
[14:22] is the real
[14:24] uh reality of christianity so second
[14:26] corinthians 6
[14:27] 18. this is the real reality of how god
[14:31] is our father in christianity
[14:33] and i kind of labor on this in chapter
[14:36] six of the book and
[14:37] by the way is your turn there second
[14:39] corinthians 6 18. i read through the
[14:41] book one more time this week and there
[14:42] are
[14:43] there are 212 corrections i had to make
[14:46] it was quite a week uh but i submitted
[14:49] those yesterday
[14:50] and so the gentleman said i'll work on
[14:52] it this week hopefully i get the final
[14:53] version
[14:54] i'll read through it one more time to
[14:56] just check all those 212 corrections
[14:58] then hopefully it'll go to publishing
[15:00] after that so i'm looking forward to
[15:02] that by the grace of the lord
[15:04] uh but the point of chapter six was to
[15:06] share in the old testament god could
[15:08] walk with them right
[15:09] god could walk with adam in the garden
[15:13] god could walk you know with abram right
[15:16] he could visit abram
[15:18] but in the new testament because of the
[15:20] blood of jesus christ
[15:21] now god could walk in their very souls
[15:25] see with david he could walk in his mind
[15:28] for a while but then david would
[15:29] would uh cast so he'd offend the holy
[15:31] spirit and cast aside the anointing
[15:33] right
[15:34] but if we are born again then god the
[15:36] father
[15:37] is constantly walking in his children
[15:39] amen
[15:40] and what greater desire could a father
[15:42] have than to know that he's living
[15:44] inside of his children praise god
[15:47] his character his his legacy right his
[15:52] uh is very personality or say like that
[15:56] is life is inside the children amen
[16:00] 2 corinthians 6 18.
[16:03] now you know this is about not mixing
[16:06] unequally with sinners
[16:09] because christ has no fellowship with
[16:12] belial the devils
[16:15] verse 16 actually let's go to 6 16 and
[16:17] what agreement had the temple of god
[16:19] with idols for year the temple the
[16:20] living god
[16:21] as god has said i will dwell in them and
[16:23] walk in them
[16:24] and i will be their god and they shall
[16:27] be my people
[16:28] so god living in your soul by the
[16:31] baptism of the holy ghost
[16:33] makes you a constant house of god it
[16:36] makes
[16:36] you a constant church amen i like coming
[16:39] to church but i also like knowing that i
[16:41] am the church amen so that means we can
[16:43] have church anywhere we are right
[16:45] wherever two or three are gathered
[16:46] there i am in the midst praise god verse
[16:49] 17
[16:50] wherefore come out from among them and
[16:52] be separate saith the lord
[16:54] and touch not the unclean thing and i
[16:56] will receive you this is new testament
[16:58] right
[16:59] that this is why so many so few people
[17:01] get born again
[17:02] because you've got to come out if you
[17:04] want the father live inside of you he
[17:05] said i've got to clean that out
[17:07] you have to separate yourself from all
[17:09] unbelief and then
[17:10] i'll dwell among you then i'll receive
[17:13] you right
[17:13] the prodigal had to leave the pig pen
[17:16] amen
[17:17] you had to leave your sins behind amen
[17:20] you had to leave that behind and you had
[17:22] to come back to the father's house right
[17:24] you had to come back to the father and
[17:26] the father will run to you
[17:27] receive you but he said separate
[17:29] yourself you know better than that
[17:32] you know the father loves you so return
[17:34] to the father amen
[17:35] verse 18 and i will be a father unto you
[17:39] and ye shall be my sons and daughters
[17:42] saith the lord almighty
[17:46] see the father is so gracious god is so
[17:48] merciful
[17:50] he tells us we must separate ourselves
[17:52] from the things of the world
[17:54] then i'll receive you as a father so the
[17:56] prodigal is the perfect illustration
[17:59] right
[17:59] for becoming a christian the bible said
[18:02] you got to come to your he had to come
[18:03] to himself
[18:04] so that means he had to he had to have a
[18:06] transformed mind and realize
[18:08] i don't have to live like this i can be
[18:10] an overcomer
[18:12] and i can at least be a servant in my
[18:14] father's house in other words if i say
[18:15] like this
[18:16] i can at least be a foolish virgin right
[18:18] but the father said no you're coming
[18:20] back you're going to be the wise
[18:22] you're going to have the blessings
[18:23] you're going to have the oil you're
[18:24] going to have the ring
[18:25] a plate at the table you're going to
[18:27] have full sonship restored amen
[18:30] hallelujah thank god this is what god
[18:34] god almighty does
[18:37] now i want to look at paul's instruction
[18:39] to fathers just briefly and then i'll
[18:41] kind of move on to this thought about i
[18:43] just want to lay these thoughts in here
[18:45] so ephesians 6 4 if you could ephesians
[18:47] 6 4.
[18:52] you know i don't think uh brother brian
[18:54] hawkins would mind if i shared this but
[18:56] i'm just going to share it you know
[18:57] we were talking about father's the last
[18:58] time he was here preaching and
[19:00] i was saying you know i really admire
[19:02] your son david he's in the marines now
[19:03] right isn't the
[19:04] marines okay and uh you know and brother
[19:08] brian started crying he's like brother
[19:09] jesse said i appreciate that he said
[19:11] i just felt like i was too harsh on him
[19:12] like a drill sergeant i said well look
[19:14] at him he's in the military
[19:15] he must have needed a drill sergeant
[19:17] right and i said brother i said
[19:20] i said i'm the opposite of that maybe
[19:21] i'm a little too loose
[19:23] right and i want to be and what are we
[19:25] all trying to do we're all trying to
[19:26] find the balance right in the middle
[19:28] right we all want to find the middle of
[19:31] the road
[19:32] right like one time i talked to some
[19:34] brothers from africa i don't remember
[19:35] which
[19:35] brothers they were somebody who visited
[19:38] brother brooks's church
[19:39] but i said brother tell me about your
[19:41] family how do you run your family
[19:42] he said i get all my children up at 6 00
[19:44] am and we pray and
[19:46] read the bible first and like i'm a
[19:48] drill sergeant
[19:50] i thought my and i started talking to my
[19:52] wife honey could we do that and she
[19:54] didn't you know
[19:55] i didn't think that was the right idea
[19:58] for our family
[20:00] and uh and so we've never gone that
[20:02] route i've never tried to wake them up
[20:04] too early uh but then you know
[20:09] but but uh we haven't taken that route
[20:11] but we've gone a little more slower you
[20:12] know get up you do your hair
[20:14] you know make the bed have breakfast
[20:16] then bible time
[20:18] so we do that you know uh yeah i was a
[20:21] brother that visited brother brooks
[20:22] church i can't remember his name
[20:23] he had a teenage son i can't remember
[20:25] his name either but anyways
[20:27] but you know either way you have to look
[20:29] at what the children become
[20:32] right because not all people are drill
[20:33] sergeants right
[20:35] not our people are relaxed and laid back
[20:37] brother bram calls him kind
[20:38] he said there's some that are dogmatic
[20:40] and nice and kind and
[20:42] he names all these different kinds of
[20:43] personalities
[20:45] he said but the main thing is to get
[20:47] christ in their souls
[20:49] the main thing is to point them to jesus
[20:51] christ i do want to say this we do want
[20:53] to seek the lord first and the children
[20:54] do get up and read their bibles first
[20:56] right that's
[20:57] we train the older ones to do that right
[20:58] there in their bed they just read their
[21:00] bible right there
[21:00] that's better than me because i gotta
[21:02] get out of the bed if i stay in the bed
[21:03] i'm gonna keep sleeping
[21:05] so i gotta get out of that bed i gotta
[21:07] go wake up wake up
[21:09] spray some water on there wake this guy
[21:11] up come on wake up fella wake up you'll
[21:13] get there you know
[21:14] then i gotta read my bible eventually
[21:16] but they could they can somehow do it
[21:17] right in their own bed so i thank the
[21:19] lord for that
[21:20] uh but i want to just lay this in here
[21:22] so ephesians 6
[21:24] 4 ye fathers provoke
[21:27] not your children to wrath so so there
[21:30] are going to be some
[21:31] fathers that are a little more strict
[21:33] like that and the bible says
[21:36] enrage enrage them not or bring them not
[21:39] to being enraged
[21:42] right uh but bring them up in the
[21:44] nurture
[21:45] and admonition of the lord now that's
[21:48] discipline nurtures discipline so we
[21:50] have to discipline them
[21:51] but not to the point of their raging
[21:54] against us
[21:55] right i've had friends from high school
[21:57] that they just hated their dads because
[21:58] of
[21:59] their dads that would tease them or pull
[22:02] pranks on them make fun of them
[22:03] embarrass them publicly
[22:06] that's really how you enrage somebody
[22:07] right is embarrass them
[22:09] the bible said we're supposed to honor
[22:11] especially the weaker vessels right
[22:13] doesn't the bible say that
[22:14] not speaking of the wife but what about
[22:15] the children they're weaker vessels too
[22:18] so fathers especially i've never i've
[22:20] never tried to tease my children if i
[22:22] did god forgive me
[22:23] i've never tried to tease them i never
[22:24] want to embarrass them i want to bring
[22:26] them up in the discipline of the lord
[22:29] but not make them enraged right
[22:32] i don't know have i ever yelled at the
[22:34] home children yet have i ever raised my
[22:36] voice yet
[22:37] lydia's shaking no she wouldn't know
[22:39] she's been around the longest
[22:41] i try not to you know
[22:45] but i could i could and still be loving
[22:49] because it's still a form of nurturing
[22:52] right and admonition is
[22:54] uh instruction and correction
[22:57] so fathers have to tell the children
[22:58] when they're wrong of course mothers do
[23:00] a great job of that too
[23:01] but this is what paul specifically tells
[23:03] them the main thing is don't enrage them
[23:06] you've got to discipline them uh
[23:10] but not enrage them in other words don't
[23:12] purposely hurt them
[23:14] okay so go to colossians now very
[23:15] similar cautions 321 i read that this
[23:18] morning i've been
[23:19] reading through colossians now yeah i
[23:21] finished my old bible that father's
[23:23] bible i finished
[23:24] it's all highlighted all the way through
[23:25] and i bought a new scofield bible
[23:27] and i just thought i'd start on
[23:28] colossians because i want to preach on
[23:30] that eventually we read we preached the
[23:32] galatians the
[23:33] ephesians philippians i want to preach
[23:34] colossians caution's 321
[23:40] nope it's not 321 it's
[23:44] no it is 321 yeah it is i'm sorry i was
[23:46] looking at 221 sorry
[23:49] now don't forget 20 now children well i
[23:52] might as well 19
[23:53] fathers husbands love your wives and be
[23:55] not bitter against them
[23:57] so somehow satan knew i'm sorry somehow
[24:00] satan was trying to make the fathers
[24:01] bitter against their
[24:03] wives in colosse so god had to anoint
[24:06] paul with the holy spirit
[24:08] love your wives don't be bitter against
[24:09] them right
[24:11] children obey your parents in all things
[24:13] for this is well pleasing
[24:15] unto the lord let's not leave out the
[24:18] children right father's got to correct
[24:19] but
[24:19] children have to obey verse 21 fathers
[24:22] provoke not your children to anger
[24:24] lest they be discouraged that means
[24:26] disheartened
[24:27] spiritless in other words after you
[24:30] correct them show them love
[24:32] show them that you love them right that
[24:35] will raise their spirits
[24:36] or like me the next week take them out
[24:39] take them out to eat or something like
[24:41] that i like to take them out to eat
[24:42] that's kind of how i like to show love
[24:44] you know they all made me uh father's
[24:46] day cards this morning and almost
[24:47] everyone
[24:48] i love you they can thanks for giving me
[24:50] ice cream and all these things
[24:51] maybe i'll give them too much sugar i
[24:54] don't think my wife would say that i
[24:55] hope not
[24:57] that's just funny what they remember you
[24:58] know about daddy
[25:02] but but see we don't want to discourage
[25:04] them we want them to
[25:06] have courage right to have heart and
[25:08] hope and
[25:09] have a spirit but we got to correct them
[25:11] at the same time in other words i got
[25:12] gotta correct your son or daughter
[25:14] but you gotta try again you can do it
[25:16] try again
[25:18] obey next time don't disobey obey
[25:23] okay so i just wanna start with those
[25:28] and let me just say this before i move
[25:29] over to my names of god
[25:31] i just want to say this to all of our
[25:32] our our children fathers want to be
[25:35] strong
[25:36] fathers want to love any honest father
[25:39] would want to
[25:41] but that's the battle they're fighting
[25:43] fathers want to be heroic leaders right
[25:46] they want to provide everything they
[25:47] want to do the best they can they can't
[25:49] always do that because sometimes they
[25:50] fall short of god's glory
[25:53] but fathers want to do it like last week
[25:55] i was going through my
[25:57] uh my file cabinet i've been trying to
[26:00] declutter i'll never get to a
[26:01] minimalistic lifestyle
[26:02] i watch all those videos on youtube i'll
[26:04] never get to that
[26:05] i'm just i'm just not built that way
[26:08] like they have nothing on their
[26:09] desk and i'm like how do you do that but
[26:12] i was going through my papers and i
[26:13] found a letter my dad wrote to me when
[26:15] he moved to tennessee like right when i
[26:16] started college
[26:17] he went down there for a couple years
[26:19] and built a little house and
[26:21] but he sent me a letter and it just oh
[26:23] always kept it all these years it's
[26:24] probably been
[26:25] oh 20 years now maybe 21 years
[26:28] and he said he said and he ended the
[26:30] letter by saying i love you
[26:31] i just wish i could have been a better
[26:33] dad to you
[26:35] and so i know although my father hasn't
[26:38] been there and he's left us
[26:39] and i know he would like to be a better
[26:43] father
[26:43] there's something in every father that
[26:46] wants to be a good father
[26:48] but sometimes we fall short of god's
[26:50] glory
[26:51] but we have to remember that god allows
[26:54] these things to happen
[26:55] so that we if we've been hurt we can
[26:58] manifest
[26:59] love and we can manifest forgiveness
[27:01] praise god
[27:02] because that's the greatest expression
[27:04] of god's love for his great love
[27:06] wherewith he loved us he hath quickened
[27:09] us who were dead in sins praise god
[27:11] and raised us up together to sit with
[27:14] christ in heavenly places amen
[27:16] the greatest expression of god's love is
[27:18] his salvation which is why his name
[27:21] above all names is jehovah the
[27:24] self-existent one
[27:25] is salvation so just know that if your
[27:29] father has been absent
[27:30] or if he's been disobedient to god
[27:34] know that he wants to do right he just
[27:36] has not received the power to do it
[27:38] so it's our job my job your job to pray
[27:41] for them
[27:41] until they can amen and if it comes on
[27:44] their deathbed we'll rejoice in that
[27:47] let's pray for that let's pray for that
[27:48] that if it comes to that we'll have that
[27:50] opportunity to say that to them
[27:53] praise god brother bram said he had many
[27:54] death bed confessions
[27:56] many people he led to the lord at their
[27:58] death beds so if we don't see it
[28:00] right soon away we've been praying all
[28:02] these years let's keep praying
[28:04] perhaps it'll have to be at the death
[28:06] bed but even then
[28:07] the precious in the sight of the lord is
[28:09] the death of his saints amen
[28:12] he told that thief on the cross today
[28:14] you'll be with me in paradise he didn't
[28:16] deserve it but he brought him anyway
[28:18] because of repentance
[28:19] the great expression of god's love and
[28:21] the church said
[28:22] all right so let's look at the names of
[28:24] god here our father
[28:26] now i bolded these as we preached on
[28:29] them okay i'm bolding them so we can see
[28:30] where we're going today
[28:32] uh we looked at the primary names
[28:36] and we looked at jehovah names i got a
[28:38] few more jehovah names
[28:39] because i told you the reason i never
[28:41] preached it was because one time i
[28:42] started studying
[28:43] and i saw all these jehovah names in
[28:46] scripture
[28:49] and so what i meant not scripture
[28:53] actually what i meant was in the
[28:54] hebrew lexicon so i'm going to talk
[28:57] about that today as well
[28:59] well we know schofield taught seven
[29:01] compound names i was listening to
[29:02] brother ramsey's sermon on that from
[29:03] 1955
[29:04] he just takes it right out of scope
[29:05] field uh
[29:07] and he gave a lot of testimonies how god
[29:09] was provider healer all these beautiful
[29:11] testimonies
[29:12] savior now there could be more names uh
[29:16] since schofield gave an eighth so
[29:18] because remember go back on that
[29:19] scofield gave us an eighth one didn't i
[29:21] have another slide up there
[29:22] or not yeah so see scofield says there's
[29:25] seven but it's interesting he gives us
[29:26] an
[29:27] eighth why would he give us an eight
[29:30] i don't know because he taught so that's
[29:31] why i don't know
[29:33] he taught seven but then he gave us an
[29:35] eighth
[29:36] just interesting it's not really a
[29:39] doctrinal thing let's just review these
[29:40] again briefly
[29:43] to abraham god was jehovah jireh
[29:46] the lord will provide has he been yours
[29:52] to moses he was jehovah rapha he told
[29:54] israel
[29:55] i am the lord thy god that healeth thee
[29:58] is he your healer today to moses he was
[30:02] jehovah nesi
[30:03] the lord is my banner the lord is my
[30:07] flag
[30:08] the lord is being waved over me praise
[30:10] god
[30:12] right hallelujah he's jehovah shalom to
[30:16] get in
[30:17] the lord is my peace
[30:20] remember he's the he's the piece of a
[30:22] fearful man remember that
[30:24] this is this is still before he defeated
[30:26] the many united
[30:28] he was peace when you don't see the the
[30:30] works of god amen
[30:32] remember he said if god be for us where
[30:34] be all the miracles
[30:35] and then the angel showed up and said
[30:37] god is our peace amen
[30:39] i'm a valiant man although i don't see
[30:41] it right i'm a mighty conqueror i'm a
[30:43] mighty warrior although i don't see it
[30:45] but god is my peace amen i'm going to
[30:48] choose to
[30:49] live in peace before i see all the
[30:51] promises of god come to pass
[30:53] jehovah shalom the lord is peace
[30:58] jehovah rai to david the lord
[31:01] is my shepherd has he guided you all
[31:03] your life church
[31:06] jehovah tiscanu to jeremiah the lord
[31:09] our righteousness praise god
[31:13] and then jehovah shama to ezekiel the
[31:16] lord
[31:17] is present and the church said amen
[31:20] now jehovah sabayoth of course means the
[31:24] lord of
[31:25] hosts the lord of angel armies amen
[31:28] hallelujah he's our banner and also he's
[31:31] the
[31:32] army praise god amen the banner is what
[31:35] all the enemy would see right the enemy
[31:36] would see that banner waving praise god
[31:39] and so he's our banner and he's the army
[31:42] praise god
[31:45] now more i put a question mark
[31:51] uh what did i do this is the same one
[31:53] okay
[31:55] so let's look at the compound names of l
[31:57] here now the first one is el
[31:59] shaddai now if you look just in the
[32:03] hebrew it means
[32:04] almighty that's why when he
[32:07] revealed he revealed himself to abraham
[32:09] he said i am the almighty god
[32:12] right god was l right which stands for
[32:15] the strong one
[32:17] and then shaddai was almighty
[32:20] almighty god praise god
[32:24] the strong almighty sounds like a little
[32:27] repetitious right
[32:28] the strong one who's almighty right and
[32:30] most powerful
[32:32] that's the first appearance now remember
[32:34] genesis 17 was a critical
[32:36] spot let me go back there that's a
[32:39] critical spot in moses's walk with the
[32:41] lord
[32:45] brother branham brings it out uh
[32:48] as the breasted one which we'll look at
[32:50] in just a moment here
[32:54] remember this is after in genesis 17
[32:57] this is
[32:58] after abram had fallen uh with
[33:01] hagar right he let sarah talk him into
[33:04] it
[33:04] and then he gets an ishmael the wild man
[33:07] which they're still battling today right
[33:09] they're still battling them today
[33:10] shooting uh missiles at them and
[33:12] i know there's a little cease-fire oh i
[33:14] heard a little article there's a
[33:15] cease-fire but that's so hamas can
[33:17] can buy up more missiles they use up all
[33:19] their missiles
[33:22] that's the only reason they want to have
[33:22] a ceasefire i tell you what the prayers
[33:24] of the righteous
[33:25] are very powerful and effective praise
[33:27] god
[33:28] the lord makes their their ammunition
[33:30] run out
[33:33] praise god amen and now abrahams 99.
[33:38] and there's no sign he's going to have
[33:40] an ish or an isaac yet there's no sign
[33:42] so god said i am el shaddai
[33:47] you're 99 abraham ebc he said don't
[33:49] forget
[33:50] i am the strong almighty
[33:53] he said walk before me perfect church
[33:56] don't be discouraged
[33:57] just walk before the lord perfect all
[33:59] the days of your life amen
[34:01] if god promised you anything he's going
[34:03] to keep his word praise god
[34:05] when it doesn't seem like it when it
[34:07] seems impossible don't forget he's el
[34:09] shaddai he's the strong
[34:11] almighty one he knows how to bring his
[34:13] word to pass
[34:14] his ways are higher than our ways his
[34:16] thoughts
[34:17] are higher than ours amen much higher
[34:20] praise god
[34:21] he has a better plan for our lives amen
[34:25] see i would have chosen my mom and dad
[34:26] to get reunited many years ago and
[34:28] i would have chosen all these different
[34:29] things but god has a time and season for
[34:32] everything praise god
[34:34] and as i said before i don't even know i
[34:36] don't even have enough said the lord
[34:37] god's going to bring my parents back
[34:38] together
[34:39] i'm just hoping but my hope is in the
[34:42] lord amen
[34:43] my hope is in the el shaddai the strong
[34:46] one praise god
[34:48] someone who believed that god will give
[34:50] me the desire of my heart praise god
[34:52] you don't have to but i'm going to
[34:55] believe it and confess it
[34:56] i'm going to call those things not as
[34:58] though they are now that's the
[34:59] difference with abraham church
[35:00] abraham could do that because he had
[35:02] thus saith the lord
[35:04] we don't always have thus saith the lord
[35:06] but i still like to call things
[35:08] that are not as though they are because
[35:10] i believe there's life in the power of
[35:11] the tongue
[35:12] praise god i say like this it just
[35:14] encourages me to say it praise god
[35:17] because satan has every every attack
[35:20] every device to try to discourage us
[35:22] to make us doubt god's word and i want
[35:24] to have faith i want to be strong in the
[35:26] lord
[35:27] and the power of his might praise god
[35:29] and church there's nothing
[35:31] more powerful than the word of god upon
[35:34] your lips amen
[35:36] jesus said the words that i speak unto
[35:38] you they are spirit
[35:40] and they are life we have life on our
[35:42] tongues when we say
[35:44] thank you god you're el shaddai you're
[35:46] the almighty strong one you'll provide
[35:48] amen
[35:50] you will do what you promised although
[35:52] i'm 99 although the years passed by
[35:54] swiftly and it doesn't seem like it's
[35:56] going to happen
[35:57] i know it will happen amen because you
[36:00] promise it
[36:01] and you're an all time god i love this
[36:04] god reveals himself
[36:06] i'm el shaddai i'm revealing this
[36:10] remember it was abraham after isaac they
[36:12] said oh you're jehovah jireh
[36:15] that was from kind of like his
[36:17] revelation but here god said you need to
[36:19] remember i'm
[36:20] el shaddai i'm revealing myself amen
[36:24] the self-existent one who reveals
[36:26] himself i'm revealing myself
[36:28] as a strong almighty one even at 99
[36:31] i can change your body although it's
[36:33] dead i can make it alive amen
[36:36] hallelujah i seen an article a few weeks
[36:39] ago
[36:40] there was a woman i think in her 80s who
[36:43] gave birth to a baby
[36:44] was it 80 she's got like white hair all
[36:46] these wrinkles and she's holding a baby
[36:49] i thought my isn't that a i should have
[36:51] saved it i didn't think about it
[36:52] i could probably look for and find it
[36:54] you saw it yeah
[36:56] she's got a she's holding this little
[36:57] baby she's all hunched over and your
[36:59] wrinkles and gray hair i'm like look at
[37:01] this modern day sarah
[37:03] our god can do anything praise god i
[37:06] mean it still happens
[37:11] now i just want to share this because
[37:13] i'm a little uncertain
[37:14] uh scofield says shady i comes from
[37:19] or the word shad means breast now it
[37:21] does the word shad means breast in the
[37:23] hebrew
[37:24] but when you click on shady i or should
[37:26] i it doesn't link to that word
[37:30] okay so when i search the hebrew lexicon
[37:33] i can't find the breasted one just
[37:34] letting you know
[37:36] but scofield was a hebrew he knew hebrew
[37:39] so i just i'll just trust him i could be
[37:42] wrong
[37:42] but either way it doesn't matter church
[37:44] i couldn't find the breasted one but
[37:46] either way
[37:46] abraham needed the strong one to be most
[37:50] powerful to give him 99 years old to
[37:52] give a baby give life
[37:53] so he could bring forth isaac praise god
[37:57] and whether he's whether that's el
[37:59] shaddai the blessed one or not
[38:00] god's word he still lived from the word
[38:02] of god and god bless his efforts amen
[38:06] now should i so shady i or should i
[38:08] means most powerful when you click on it
[38:10] in the hebrew
[38:11] lexicon so that's what i'm saying
[38:13] there's a little bit of uncertainty
[38:16] but either one works out right because
[38:18] he had
[38:19] he had to believe god's word we
[38:20] understand that now second he's called
[38:22] el eleon
[38:26] this means highest or most high in
[38:29] hebrew
[38:30] so he genesis 14 18 melchizedek king of
[38:33] salem brought forth bread and wine
[38:35] and he was the priest of la
[38:38] el eleon melchizedek was the priest
[38:42] of al-eleon who is melchizedek it was
[38:47] god in a flesh body but because it was a
[38:50] flesh body
[38:51] that flesh wasn't god right because
[38:54] god's not a
[38:55] god's not flesh god can't be limited
[38:58] right he just borrowed or created that
[38:59] flesh
[39:00] so melchizedek was god in a form but
[39:03] that man was a priest
[39:05] to el elyon the most high god
[39:09] praise god melchizedek was the priest
[39:13] of the most high god now i want to show
[39:15] you what scofield says
[39:16] it also means highest the most high or
[39:19] highest
[39:20] in the first occurrence melchizedek was
[39:22] the priest of the most high god
[39:24] to abram after his victory of the
[39:26] confederated kings
[39:28] abram instantly offered tithes of all
[39:31] and told the king of sodom he wouldn't
[39:32] take even a thread from him
[39:34] because he only wanted el elyon the
[39:37] highest or most high god
[39:39] credited for making him rich
[39:43] so this was a revelation this was a
[39:45] revelation to abraham
[39:47] priest of el eleon this is
[39:51] melchizedek is the priest of the highest
[39:54] strong one and if the highest strong one
[39:58] can help me and my 300 servants defeat
[40:01] five kings i'm not taking anything from
[40:04] any man
[40:04] i'm only taking blessings from el elyon
[40:07] amen
[40:08] he's like you're not giving me anything
[40:10] i'm not taking a thread
[40:12] imagine a thread our daughters are
[40:14] sowing things for 4-h and there's thread
[40:15] all over
[40:16] i they usually have a a pile that they
[40:18] throw away i usually pick it up
[40:20] and dump it down there and abraham dump
[40:22] it in the trash and abraham said i'm not
[40:25] taking one thread from you
[40:27] like that's trash to us but abraham
[40:30] abraham was so sincere
[40:31] he said god amen god has fought for me
[40:35] he's helped me to restore all of lot's
[40:38] family amen
[40:40] all of lot's possessions he helped me a
[40:42] humble little servant
[40:44] what was he 90 was he 85 or 90 i have to
[40:47] look at the
[40:48] the the uh the chronology there 70 or 80
[40:51] or
[40:52] 75 80 90 year old man defeats five kings
[40:56] that made him stand in awe and then he
[40:58] met god in a form
[41:00] and he said i won't take anything from
[41:02] anybody anything good that comes out of
[41:04] my life
[41:05] was from god and i'm giving tithes of
[41:07] everything amen
[41:09] i will not let a man make me rich praise
[41:11] god i will only take the blessings of
[41:14] god
[41:16] so that made abraham no he's el eleon
[41:21] he's the highest right he's the strong
[41:24] one
[41:24] highest oh
[41:28] these names are some they're so similar
[41:30] right strong one
[41:32] highest almighty
[41:36] the third one is el olam
[41:39] now hola means everlasting or ancient
[41:43] so the first occurrence is
[41:47] abraham planted a grove in beersheba and
[41:49] called there on the name of the lord
[41:51] the everlasting god let's turn there
[41:53] genesis 21 33.
[41:56] i kind of forgot the context on this one
[41:59] okay this is after
[42:00] isaac after then they cast out hagar and
[42:03] ishmael
[42:11] oh and they had a little trouble with
[42:13] the flocks there beersheba
[42:17] okay and they made a covenant verse 33
[42:19] and abraham planted a grove
[42:20] in beersheba and called there the name
[42:22] of the lord the everlasting god and
[42:24] abraham sojourned in philistines land
[42:26] many days now this is right before the
[42:28] temptation
[42:30] so god reveals himself as an everlasting
[42:34] god
[42:36] uh in the midst of this trouble with the
[42:39] wells right he had trouble with the
[42:40] wells
[42:42] god shows him that he's the everlasting
[42:44] god
[42:45] the ancient one he knows all things
[42:49] he made a covenant god brought peace
[42:51] between two brothers having a battle
[42:53] right and that caused abraham to know
[42:55] god as you are the everlasting
[42:58] god you keep your covenants you're
[43:00] faithful to your promises
[43:01] and i'm going to be and here he made a
[43:03] covenant he said i'm going to be
[43:04] faithful to my covenant as well
[43:06] church when we make a promise let's make
[43:08] sure we keep it praise god
[43:10] right everlasting gods that one
[43:13] don't really have much on that one
[43:17] okay and i forgot to change this so this
[43:18] is i switched that over
[43:20] uh yeah i must have stopped that's what
[43:21] i must have got interrupted this morning
[43:23] when i was studying so sorry about that
[43:25] my fault that's right yeah i must have
[43:27] left off right there
[43:29] with that one okay so now here we are
[43:33] uh we've covered all that now i just
[43:35] want to give you the meanings i
[43:37] can see i added a column here so god
[43:39] lowercase is strong one
[43:41] el allah elohim lord capital of the
[43:44] self-existent one who reveals himself
[43:46] the lord lowercase is master adonai
[43:50] almighty god is el shaddai
[43:57] everlasting lord god is jehovah elohim
[44:00] the self-existing strong one
[44:02] the lord god is adonai jehovah master
[44:05] self-existent one who reveals himself
[44:07] and the lord of hosts is the
[44:09] self-existent one who reveals himself
[44:11] of the host of heaven a church in that i
[44:14] try to make it as simple as possible
[44:15] does that help by god's grace
[44:18] the main point is that we see god
[44:19] reveals himself
[44:21] and his characteristics in the moment
[44:23] when his people need it praise god
[44:27] so however the people had a need
[44:29] whatever the need was
[44:31] god showed up and either god or his
[44:33] people
[44:34] recognized this is his name this is his
[44:36] power
[44:37] this is his character this is what he
[44:39] does this is who he is
[44:40] and i want to serve this god amen i
[44:43] don't want to serve the gods of the
[44:44] world and i don't want to
[44:45] serve these uh these heathen lying
[44:48] people and
[44:49] priests of baal i don't want to serve
[44:51] them i want to serve the self-existent
[44:53] one praise god
[44:54] i want to serve the almighty god
[44:56] hallelujah i know he's faithful
[44:59] so here we see the meanings there now
[45:01] you've got the meanings
[45:02] i hope that's a blessing there by god's
[45:04] grace
[45:05] now i went through this morning i had
[45:07] time i went through the entire hebrew
[45:09] lexicon i just typed in jehovah
[45:11] so that searches all all the hebrew
[45:14] words and there was 253
[45:16] occurrences so let me just give you a
[45:18] few examples of what i mean by jehovah
[45:20] is used in many names okay it's using
[45:23] many names
[45:27] so uriah remember uriah the husband of
[45:29] bathsheba his name
[45:30] means jehovah is my light this must have
[45:32] been a hebrew name because we know he
[45:34] was a hittite
[45:36] he would not have had a hebrew name he
[45:38] was a proselyte
[45:40] and they became a mighty man a mighty
[45:42] mighty man of valor
[45:44] hallelujah and so they named him as they
[45:46] bro maybe he chose his name i'm not sure
[45:49] his name is jehovah is my light
[45:53] elijah right we got a couple elijah
[45:55] friends
[45:56] that means my god is jehovah
[46:01] zechariah means jehovah remembers
[46:05] hezekiah jehovah is my strength that's
[46:08] so suitable
[46:09] because his father was an idolater and
[46:11] he's the one that
[46:12] he established a new uh temple right as
[46:15] far as
[46:16] he he took off the old door put on a new
[46:18] door
[46:19] took down the old goat or gates sorry
[46:21] kicked out the goats
[46:22] established a new gate right and he he
[46:26] smashed and stomped all the idols took
[46:28] their dust and threw them down in the
[46:30] river praise god
[46:31] so jehovah was his strength in other
[46:33] words they had revival
[46:35] in the days of hezekiah because god was
[46:37] strong in hezekiah praise god
[46:40] now you might see this there was a uh
[46:44] christian rock band when i was come just
[46:46] got saved they were called
[46:47] ja or something like that well josh just
[46:50] jehovah's a shortened form of jah just
[46:52] so you know
[46:53] it's just a shorter form just like
[46:54] jehovah it's kind of like a
[46:56] a nickname for yahweh right the most
[46:59] sacred of all god's names
[47:01] yahweh so it's kind of like well they
[47:03] did another step to shorten jehovah
[47:05] jah okay
[47:08] now joseph interesting joseph means
[47:11] jehovah has
[47:12] added right he's the first son
[47:15] of rachel right see her womb was closed
[47:19] so the lord added seed
[47:23] and he was the most like christ praise
[47:24] god hallelujah
[47:28] first samuel 82 says joel means jehovah
[47:32] is god and
[47:35] jochebed i wanted to put some sisters
[47:37] names in here so the sisters could
[47:38] appreciate that
[47:39] jochebed moses's mom means jehovah is
[47:42] glory
[47:45] moses is mom right out of the water
[47:47] moses means out of the water
[47:49] well he come from god's glory jehovah's
[47:52] glory government jacobin
[47:56] and uh like i said there were so many i
[47:57] didn't know there was probably out of
[47:59] those 250 there was probably
[48:01] most of them were names of people i
[48:03] didn't know from the old testament you
[48:04] know and all those
[48:05] genealogies and lineages jeremiah it
[48:09] means
[48:09] whom jehovah has appointed okay and then
[48:13] i put a little emoji there
[48:14] i finished that study this morning all
[48:17] right now
[48:18] i got this from a website uh this
[48:20] morning god is real

[58:46] amen all we can say is thank you lord
[58:50] jesus christ
[58:52] for being all these things in the old
[58:54] testament
[58:55] and in the new he's everything to us
[58:58] praise god
[58:59] all that we have need of that's just a
[59:01] fraction of the names you can go down
[59:02] through
[59:02] you had enough time you could go down
[59:04] through and name every single title that
[59:06] he was in the whole bible
[59:08] it would take hours and hours and days
[59:09] and days you'd probably run out of time
[59:11] hallelujah now let's go to the book of
[59:14] acts here
[59:15] i want to close with this thought here
[59:16] i'm almost at my hour good
[59:20] let's go to acts i believe it's chapter
[59:21] four if i'm not mistaken
[59:35] acts chapter four this scripture just
[59:38] kind of come on my heart here before the
[59:44] sermon
[59:49] yes verse seven now remember the story
[59:51] they just raised a paralyzed man
[59:54] up uh he went we were leaping and
[59:55] dancing and praising god the
[59:57] lame man healed now look at verse seven
[1:00:00] and when they had set them in the midst
[1:00:01] they asked by what power
[1:00:03] or by what name have you done this
[1:00:07] right because peter and uh peter and
[1:00:10] and john said it wasn't them
[1:00:15] verse let's go down to verse 10 now be
[1:00:17] it known unto you all unto the
[1:00:19] all the people of israel that by the
[1:00:20] name of jesus christ of nazareth whom he
[1:00:23] crucified
[1:00:24] whom god raised from the dead even by
[1:00:26] him doth this man
[1:00:28] stand before you whole this is the stone
[1:00:30] which was his builder
[1:00:31] i'm sorry which was set at naw of you
[1:00:33] builders which has become the head of
[1:00:35] the corner so there's
[1:00:36] some more names stone head of the corner
[1:00:39] neither is that their salvation in any
[1:00:41] other for there is none
[1:00:43] other name under heaven given among men
[1:00:46] whereby we must be saved
[1:00:49] see every time there was something that
[1:00:51] happened they said what name
[1:00:52] what power did you do this so power and
[1:00:56] name
[1:00:56] are synonymous praise god power and name
[1:00:59] are one in the same praise god
[1:01:02] hallelujah then peter says there's no
[1:01:04] other name
[1:01:06] given under heaven whereby we must be
[1:01:08] saved
[1:01:10] i want to look at another one too this
[1:01:12] also works in in
[1:01:13] church correction first corinthians 5.
[1:01:16] this just come on my mind right now
[1:01:22] now remember in chapter five of first
[1:01:24] corinthians there was a man
[1:01:25] sleeping with his stepmom and paul said
[1:01:27] they didn't mourn
[1:01:29] verse three for verily i for i verily
[1:01:33] as abs in the body but present in the
[1:01:34] spirit have judged already as though i
[1:01:36] were present
[1:01:37] concerning him that had so done this
[1:01:39] deed now that's interesting i just read
[1:01:41] that in colossians
[1:01:42] paul said i'm not there but i am present
[1:01:45] in the spirit
[1:01:46] now that's really something right there
[1:01:48] let's just stop for a moment
[1:01:49] i don't know if dead people's spirits
[1:01:51] can be back i doubt it
[1:01:53] it doesn't seem like it but paul says my
[1:01:55] spirit
[1:01:56] is there with you in the church
[1:01:59] now how could that be it could only be
[1:02:01] through the holy spirit
[1:02:03] because the holy spirit is omnipresent
[1:02:06] in other words and what i think i
[1:02:08] believe it means paul's spirit was there
[1:02:10] because
[1:02:10] paul told them the truth and paul told
[1:02:13] them how to solve the problem
[1:02:14] so in other words if they didn't obey
[1:02:17] they'd be responsible and that would be
[1:02:18] recorded as a witness in heaven against
[1:02:20] them
[1:02:21] because the prophet told them what to do
[1:02:24] and so it's as if his spirit was there
[1:02:26] because he spoke it by the holy spirit
[1:02:28] amen
[1:02:29] hallelujah
[1:02:32] so i wonder so i just wonder it makes me
[1:02:36] wonder about branham tabernacle when
[1:02:37] brother brandon was alive makes me
[1:02:38] wonder
[1:02:39] and some other churches that may have
[1:02:40] rejected him and didn't do what he said
[1:02:44] just makes me wonder he said i am their
[1:02:46] present already
[1:02:49] i'm there by the spirit by the holy
[1:02:51] spirit now look he says in verse 4
[1:02:53] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[1:02:56] when you're gathered together and my
[1:02:58] spirit
[1:02:58] with the power of our lord jesus christ
[1:03:01] so see how paul says it's the same thing
[1:03:03] in the name of jesus and by the power of
[1:03:06] the name of jesus
[1:03:07] verse 5 to deliver such as one unto
[1:03:10] satan
[1:03:10] for the destruction of the flesh that
[1:03:12] the spirit may be saved
[1:03:14] in the day of the lord jesus
[1:03:18] so he said when someone's this when they
[1:03:19] won't repent in the name of jesus and by
[1:03:22] the power of jesus
[1:03:23] deliver them uh to destruction that
[1:03:26] their soul might be
[1:03:27] saved praise god there's great power in
[1:03:31] this name
[1:03:32] is there not there's great power
[1:03:36] there's power to save as we saw in acts
[1:03:38] chapter four
[1:03:39] there's no other name given under heaven
[1:03:41] whereby we must be saved
[1:03:43] but there's also power in the name to
[1:03:45] cast out the leaven
[1:03:46] that we might become a new lump praise
[1:03:48] god
[1:03:50] there's power in the name of jesus to
[1:03:52] deliver a disobedient one
[1:03:54] to satan can you imagine delivering a
[1:03:57] disobedient person just
[1:03:58] here's satan go ahead i'm handing him
[1:04:00] over to you can you imagine
[1:04:02] and that's god's love right
[1:04:06] that's god's mercy god loves that
[1:04:08] disobedient person so much
[1:04:11] he won't let their soul be lost so he
[1:04:13] delivers them over to satan so satan
[1:04:15] will destroy their flesh
[1:04:16] that their soul might be saved
[1:04:19] that's love like brother says
[1:04:24] it's the love of god if you find
[1:04:25] yourself on your back in a hospital
[1:04:27] looking up to god for healing
[1:04:28] and you've been a backslider that's
[1:04:30] god's love
[1:04:33] right that's god's love
[1:04:36] because he's brought you to a spot to
[1:04:38] try to make your
[1:04:40] heart right right to repent receive
[1:04:42] salvation
[1:04:43] ask for forgiveness that's his love to
[1:04:46] deliver by the power in the name of
[1:04:48] jesus
[1:04:49] imagine saying that i deliver you in the
[1:04:50] name of jesus to the devil
[1:04:53] that your soul might be saved this is
[1:04:55] the power in the name of jesus christ
[1:04:58] so we have power in the name of jesus
[1:04:59] christ to do miracles
[1:05:01] because he said silver and gold have i
[1:05:02] none but such as i have give i you in
[1:05:05] the name of jesus christ
[1:05:06] rise and walk praise god
[1:05:10] then there's uh then all the baptisms
[1:05:13] should be down
[1:05:14] done in the name of the lord jesus
[1:05:16] christ repent every one of you and be
[1:05:18] baptized like
[1:05:19] like sweet little victoria in the name
[1:05:22] of jesus christ for the remission of
[1:05:23] your sins
[1:05:24] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:05:26] holy ghost amen
[1:05:27] because it's the authority in that name
[1:05:29] praise god
[1:05:31] if god was if if god was jehovah jair to
[1:05:34] abraham and provided all of his needs
[1:05:36] then god's going to provide the holy
[1:05:38] ghost to those who are baptized in the
[1:05:40] name of jesus christ
[1:05:42] praise god he's going to provide that
[1:05:44] because he's jehovah jireh amen
[1:05:47] oh my and devils were cast on his name
[1:05:49] remember paul
[1:05:50] he was grieved many days but they turned
[1:05:52] to that woman with the spirit
[1:05:53] he said to come out of her in the name
[1:05:55] of jesus christ
[1:05:57] great power in this name this name is
[1:05:59] mighty to say praise god
[1:06:01] mighty to save so all we can say is
[1:06:04] thank you lord jesus christ
[1:06:06] for that powerful name that gives us
[1:06:09] everything that we have need of
[1:06:11] now just remember lord means it's
[1:06:14] basically
[1:06:14] curios in the greek which means master
[1:06:17] some say it's adonai
[1:06:19] so master jehovah
[1:06:22] our salvation anointed or messiah
[1:06:27] so jehovah master messiah that's what
[1:06:30] we're saying
[1:06:30] when we say lord jesus christ all the
[1:06:33] power behind all these names
[1:06:36] are coming in one name the lord jesus
[1:06:38] christ praise god
[1:06:40] he's the all of it it's the name and the
[1:06:42] bible said it's the name above every
[1:06:44] name on earth
[1:06:45] but also in heaven amen in this world
[1:06:48] and in the world to come praise god how
[1:06:50] do you do what a name praise god the
[1:06:52] master
[1:06:53] jehovah the christos the christ amen
[1:06:56] the anointed one and he's here today to
[1:06:58] meet our needs amen
[1:07:01] amen his name is above every name name
[1:07:04] not only this world
[1:07:06] but also that which is to come
[1:07:09] praise god i don't do everything we do
[1:07:12] everything we say
[1:07:13] we want to do it in the name of the lord
[1:07:14] jesus christ
[1:07:16] because the power and authority of
[1:07:17] heaven backs us up
[1:07:20] praise god it backs us up now the
[1:07:23] confusing part is when we feel like
[1:07:24] we're getting rebuked
[1:07:27] right or we don't see the power of god
[1:07:29] like paul paul was able to cast the
[1:07:31] devil out of that woman but then the
[1:07:32] coppersmith kicked him out of the city
[1:07:35] right remember that but still he did
[1:07:38] everything in the name of jesus praise
[1:07:40] god god was going to be with him
[1:07:42] uh during the victories and god was
[1:07:45] going to be a witness
[1:07:46] against that man demetrius right
[1:07:49] was alexander the coppersmith i think
[1:07:50] was alexander the congressman god's
[1:07:52] being
[1:07:52] going to be a witness against him and he
[1:07:55] had to let him in other words god had to
[1:07:56] show his humility
[1:07:58] through paul in that case right yet this
[1:08:01] is the name of the lord name
[1:08:02] but this name is so humble praise god
[1:08:04] and allow itself to be humiliated in
[1:08:06] fact i heard by the rabbi say that when
[1:08:08] i was listening to tape yesterday
[1:08:10] uh barbara said god wants to humiliate
[1:08:12] you
[1:08:14] in other words he wants you to be humble
[1:08:17] and he gave an example of speaking in
[1:08:19] tongues at work but for us we may not if
[1:08:21] you don't have the gift of tongues
[1:08:22] you're not going to speak in tongues at
[1:08:23] work but you can't give a testimony
[1:08:25] praise god can't give a testimony at
[1:08:28] work i remember the first time i met my
[1:08:30] uh
[1:08:30] current principal he said oh nice to
[1:08:32] meet you mr smith i've heard about you i
[1:08:34] said
[1:08:34] i said i just want to tell you god gave
[1:08:35] my mom a cancer and i went on and it was
[1:08:37] when i was second grade
[1:08:39] and i said i've seen god do all these
[1:08:41] things and i could tell just a little
[1:08:42] bit too much for him
[1:08:43] but but i just wanted to know the first
[1:08:46] time i met him
[1:08:46] i want to know that i believe in the
[1:08:49] name of jesus
[1:08:50] and he's asked me numerous times to pray
[1:08:52] for him and pray for people
[1:08:53] i want him to know that that's the name
[1:08:55] i stand for praise god
[1:08:57] i don't stand for the cleveland browns i
[1:08:59] don't stand for the cleveland cavs
[1:09:00] that's not my name my name is the lord
[1:09:03] jesus christ that's
[1:09:04] that's the name i'm supporting amen
[1:09:07] that's not my name it's just the name of
[1:09:09] the bride praise god i'm not saying it's
[1:09:10] my name
[1:09:11] i'm a part of that body praise god
[1:09:14] that's the name we stand for and that's
[1:09:16] the name that rules this earth
[1:09:18] and this world and the worlds to come
[1:09:20] praise god
[1:09:21] and yet he gets a new name brother
[1:09:22] william this is my guess i think he'll
[1:09:24] just pack on another few names
[1:09:25] behind lord jesus christ because he's
[1:09:28] got adonai jehovah messiah
[1:09:30] he's got all those there i imagine he'll
[1:09:31] just pack a few more on the on the back
[1:09:33] of that one and
[1:09:34] we'll have this long name kind of like
[1:09:36] zephaniah is that
[1:09:37] how do you say that zephyr pinaya how do
[1:09:39] you say that
[1:09:40] zap path i can never say that name
[1:09:44] that shows my ignorance zap path
[1:09:52] joseph's name in egypt right just as
[1:09:54] long i imagine just be lord jesus christ
[1:09:56] and
[1:09:57] ruler and some other you know some other
[1:09:59] great names that will just pack
[1:10:01] on because this is the name above all
[1:10:03] names
[1:10:04] this is the name that sets you free this
[1:10:06] is the name that healed you
[1:10:08] this is the name that saved you this is
[1:10:10] the name that keeps you
[1:10:12] this is the name that heals you praise
[1:10:14] god this is the name that
[1:10:16] has sealed you into the kingdom of god
[1:10:18] forever amen
[1:10:19] hallelujah it's the name above every
[1:10:21] name in church every knee will bow
[1:10:24] to this name the lord jesus christ i
