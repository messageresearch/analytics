just thought i'd put that picture jose thanks for getting me that picture brother remember all those years ago you got me that picture praise god he bought it off you know voice of god and i appreciate he bought me a bunch of them so thank you brother i appreciate that just want to honor what the lord has done i believe god is fulfilled revelation 10 1-7 i believe he did that in 1963 praise god that's what i believe knows people could say different but that's what i believe and i believe the seals vindicated that it was fulfilled praise god god bless you shane good to see you buddy love you praise god so people have their own opinions and i know brother ram didn't have the dates right but he never said the dates were thus saith the lord he said the revelation was thus saith the lord and that's what we rest our souls upon amen the revelation of thus saith the lord amen praise god that's exactly right that's what they've done through all the ages they had thus saith the lord and they rested upon that praise god hallelujah so let's go to joshua chapter one i'm enthused to be in the house of lord today i trust you are as well i got talked to brother jim shumak this week pastor there i just felt led to call him up and just talk to him a little bit and i told him i said brother i kind of feel like i need a mentor sometimes you know like you know he said raise all those children and i said i've only got two teenagers i kind of feel like i need some more advice so i said i'm going to call you up brother sometime he said sure brother i said you've gone through it you know you he's just been a deer always been a dear friend and always been a real encourager i've always found encouragement from him and um we just i just appreciate him very much uh joshua chapter one and then we'll read the memory verse here uh off the text brother vang again he'll give us the the february memory verse i'm sorry march rather march memory verse forgive me joshua chapter one i trust you're feeling strong in the lord this week amen we all no doubt went through battles but we can all get strong again here by god's grace we can keep our strength we can keep our victory that's god's plan god's plan is through this through this symbolism is to be like an army and to keep marching keep your strength right keep keep keep the power of god going before you keep out all sin and you'll be more than conquerors in christ jesus amen and thank god we don't have to build we don't have to build like a we don't have to build an altar with all these stones we can just use the altar of our heart and say jesus forgive me i'm sorry i lied i'm sorry i lusted i'm sorry i stole that and he'll forgive us by his blood amen what amazing sacrifice we have the all-sufficient sacrifice the blood of jesus christ joshua chapter 1. let's just read let's read verses six and seven i know it's a little bit longer but let's read that then we'll read our memory verse i like to hear your voices too i like you know some some of us aren't gonna say man well i like to hear you read the word then now most of you do but some people may not it could be the just they're quiet it could be they don't have faith we don't know um my brother said amen is sick praise god holy spirit get get that devil chase that devil out of here right chase him up that tree that's what it is we say amen we believe it it drives the demons away praise god joshua 1 verses 5 6-7 let's begin on three one two three there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so will i be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide and inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper wither so ever thou goest amen hebrews 5 i'm sorry james 5 rather james 5 verse seven it's a little scripture my wife had on her heart for february and i've certainly needed this scripture haven't you who needs to be more patient for the rapture anyone else out there need any more patience for the rapture sure we all do we all wish it would have happened last month right or last year we all wish it would have happened but we need patience because god it shows god as being patient god's waiting for those next ones the the current generation to receive the word he's letting the word get to them uh like shang and i reading yesterday the bible said the eyes of the lord run around the whole earth seeking someone that he could show himself strong in amen god is searching uh indonesia right zimbabwe god is searching all the nations europe asia he's searching all the nations who will believe me who loves me who will trust in my word and when they do he raises them up as a soldier amen amen hallelujah james five seven and eight let's read that one two three be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husband man waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the lord draweth nigh let's have one more word of prayer can we let's ask the lord to minister to the needs if you have a need on your heart just make it known unto god by raising your hand or bowing your head heavenly father you know what we have need of today lord we've read your scripture lord you've kind of dealt with me on these subjects i couldn't get past this idea of be strong so lord i just pray you'll use me lord that your word could strengthen your people lord i have no power of my own i'm trusting in your power i'm trusting in your strength each one of us we're trusting in the strength of almighty god so bless us here father in thy divine presence and father we'll be grateful when we leave this house we'll be happy and joyful leaving this house in jesus christ's name and this ain't said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god i do want to ask real quick i think i forgot to ask and you can switch over i got some quotes here um does anybody need to take communion after the first service because you can't make the second is there anybody that would like to take communion with jose yes sir so we can take it so at the end of the service i'll just you know we'll sing i'll say you're dismissed and i'll ask everybody to leave or just you know leave out quietly and then we'll give communion to our brother by the grace of the lord always want to do that always want to give them a chance whoever can take communion to do it as we look at tonight shoe bread means the bread of his face that's what it means the bread of his face so that scripturally you're looking at the picture of the holy place they were eating bread right before his face because his his presence was in the holiest nobody else they all had bread out there right manna israel had men out they had their own bread but there was special holy bread the bible said it was fresh bread there was special bread that was shoe bread and that's in the presence of god so i'm kind of preaching my message for tonight i think you understand my god's grace so let's uh look to the lord here um make sure i got everything here i want to uh i think i'm able to i want to show a few things eventually let me see if i can switch over can you see this okay that'll be okay i just want to show a few things here no that wasn't it actually i want to show this one not that one i want to show that one and that one in a little bit okay just as the lord leads all right praise god let's look at joshua again this morning and i was uh you know praying and waiting for leadership on what to preach on and i'll set a timer let me just preach an hour here uh so tonight we won't do the kids bible study i just want to preach a regular message okay just so i can be as sincere as possible um uh it's such an important thing brother said if we don't take communion the right way we're cursed right with a temporary curse not a not a permanent but it's a temporary chastisement the bible calls it and so we always want to take the lord's supper uh as sincerely and reverently as possible um so now we i just want to look at this thought of be strong and very courageous out of joshua chapter one i just want to linger on this for a little bit longer why was it there was a reason i went back and listened to last sunday's message and i just felt the real good anointing at the end of the sermon and just saw people worshiping and praising god thanking god for his strength are you thankful for god's strength today amen praise god we're so blessed to be able to have god's strength so we ended last week i kind of ended with this thought in deuteronomy god uh moses is telling joshua the prophet saying be strong be strong and then in joshua 1 god's telling him be strong be strong and then finally the officers are telling joshua just be strong and very courageous so in other words everybody is around him telling him to be strong and so no doubt that means he would have had battles to be strong he would have been tempted to become weak right because now i've got a i got to fill the shoes of moses ah he's a great man of god and no doubt there was no man like moses but you know brother man makes an interesting point i don't know if you listen to as i was with moses this week brother branham made a point and he said uh joshua actually had a greater work to do than that of moses now that's quite a statement uh and i'm just taking brother brandon about his word for i don't have a scripture for that but i know he said that what a statement that is how many think it'd be difficult to move uh two million people i moved when i had five kids out to doyle's town that was quite a move with five kids imagine two million kids quite a move moses did that by the rod of god amen he did it by the miracles by the plagues and by the power of god and then he brought them you know out there and he came he brought him all the way up to kadesh but they turned it down so he had to take him in a in a circle a proverbial circle well maybe a literal circle in the desert all those years and take him from place to place and then he finally come back to that mountain praise god uh where they were close ready to take the promised land right uh what what uh what a work that he did but brother adam said joshua had a bigger job to do and if and i guess one the one way i see it brother jose is because he had more kings to defeat moses defeated pharaoh thank god the mightiest army uh the amalekites remember we looked at that a few weeks ago joshua that was joshua's first battle praise god the amalekites moses said get your army ready you're going to fight tomorrow we have no record of him being a soldier or general until that time he said get ready tomorrow you're going to fight and you're going to lead the people tomorrow but it didn't matter because god was with him amen in church i'll say like this we need to be instant and in season why because god is with us amen hallelujah if uh you know there's been a couple of times i didn't know i was going to preach i was at special meetings by shane i didn't know i was going to preach in the book said you're going to preach in a few minutes i said amen the last time it happened was at new york i thought brother brooks was going to preach and the preacher said no you're going to preach and it was just in a few moments and i said good i've been fasting all day amen and it was just the lord you know i i wasn't preaching but the lord said we just got to be instant in season out of season we got to be ready no matter what the lord allows to happen or whatever the lord allows the devil to bring about us we know we're more than conquerors we know that the greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world amen that's why jesus sent the holy ghost he said i'm going to give you power when you receive the holy ghost praise god amen so you've just got to realize that i i've got to get outside of my mind and get in the mind of christ and let god's power flow through me amen church we always got to be ready to pray the prayer of faith for somebody right if they're sick or discouraged or we got to be ready to say god uh we lay my hands on this person i trust you're going to touch them amen and just be ready and instant and always looking for the leadership of the holy spirit amen but i like you know in joshua 10 we finally get to the spot where joshua has put all these uh these five kings under his feet and he's literally got them under his feet amen today we don't we don't fight our we don't fight people to get them under our feet physically but we we speak the word against devils to put them under our spiritual feet praise god amen amen and so once joshua finally gets to that spot where he's he's got the victory he tells the rest of the people now listen he said moses has told me this god has told me this the officers have told me this now i'm telling you this praise god in other words he became what the word of god said he would become amen amen he could say he could say like uh jesus this day this scripture is fulfilled amen i've got the power amen how do you know he got the power because he moved back the devil amen how do you know you got the power because you move back sin unbelief and lies you overcome it you conquer it by the blood of jesus amen that's how you know you got the power amen that's why i that's why sometimes you may hear me you may hear me bring up how the lord help me to be uh porn pictures and and cussing and evil movies and sports and cigarettes now why do you hear me bring that up because those are memorials amen those are memorials god was strong with me then they're encouraging me praise god that the god that was with me there the god that brought down all those demons is the one who's gonna help me overcome this demon amen what they got that's why the bible that's why joshua said you set up these memorials here and when the children ask what is this all about you tell them praise god amen you tell them god is real god brought me through it and he'll bring you through it amen that's what we need today we need the power of the holy spirit in our lives amen we need to remember what he's already done and know that he's faithful and he'll continue doing what he's already done amen now he became you know he spoke it he heard he just he kept meditating on god's word until it became a reality amen that's what i'm doing you know that's what you're doing with our loved ones right we're speaking god's word until it becomes a reality until they accept christ amen if god would grant them salvation we don't know but we are just confessing many of these promises and we're just speaking it and we're just believing god's word until it happens amen and we've got to be willing to do that now whether we're sick like jose's recently spoke to that glaucoma devil amen hallelujah praise god you just speak god's word amen speak the word and go forward god told moses glory and joshua he experienced the same i love it praise god now i've adjusted this a little bit but remember the steps if we want to be strong how many want to be strong in the lord amen god told joshua these three steps uh repent right uh i think yeah humility was the right word there yeah humility we saw that with paul paul said when i'm weak then i'm strong right in church we know this now repentance is a part of this because brother tells us if we don't confess devils a legal right to stay in our lives so repentance has to be on top amen because satan has a right if you've allowed a demon in and you don't confess it and you let him sit there then he's got every right to stay there he's got every right to sit in your house and spoil all your goods and eat your peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and and eat your chicken he's got every right to sit there and spoil your faith or your joy right or your patience he's got every right to spoil that but as soon as you confess that and as soon as you get your muscles back strong man as soon as you get your muscles back strong woman praise god you can bind him with the word of god with the name of jesus and you can cast him out praise god but other than that he's got every legal right to stay right there that's why we've got to confess our sins praise god so if we want to be strong we've got to repent and we've got to expose any uh evil influence on our lives and be humble paul said i have no strength he said but jesus i'm i'm weak then i'm in strong because he's given me the strength my grace is sufficient praise god amen now and then remember god told joshua he said only be strong and he said he said i will be with you i'll never leave you nor forsake you how many know he's with you today how many know he he gave you an angel escort to church praise god i know he gave me about three times a hydroplane i don't know about the lands or anything like that i don't know about brian and george but about three times a hydroplane i was going off the road so i thank god for the angel escort jesus amen thank you for protecting me and thank you because without him i can do nothing praise god amen if there's any good thing that happens it was christ amen amen and so he's always with us praise god and he's always uh trying to work his his will through our lives but we have to remember that he's with us amen we got to repent and remember his promises that he he has it like bone man said he hasn't thrown us on the scrap heap he said that in the statue perfect man he said when people forfeit their faith like judas he said they go on the scrap heap of ministers now we've seen a lot of that lately around the message haven't we but i'm not going to the scrap heap i'm going to the promised land praise god i'm not going to the scrappy i'm going further up the pyramid amen hallelujah i'm on the king's highway praise god i'm not on the devil's scrap deep amen i'm walking on the king's highway amen they can forsake it if they want they can blaspheme this picture if they want they can blaspheme the word of god if they want they can blaspheme the seventh angel they want but we won't we'll honor god we'll honor jesus christ we'll recognize his word we'll believe it we'll act on it we'll live it praise god amen hallelujah and so they fall in this scrap heap of ministers and it proves because they never had temperance to begin with right some of them that commit adultery and and uh all these wicked things they let worldly music into their homes it shows they never had the stature of perfect man to begin with amen they never had enough knowledge to know why women shouldn't cut their hair they never had enough knowledge of the word to understand that what a shame it shows they never had it they were never that strong to begin with what hung on it must have been a religious spirit all those years now the other thing is it could have been they had it and then they forfeit it right like israel they made it all the way up to kadesh but then they backslid right you can make some serious ground but then you can forfeit it right so either way but that's them that's not us we know he's with us amen i know he's so much with me he's not just with me he's in me amen because i see him take over my lips amen i see him take over my thinking amen i see him take over my actions praise god i see him bring me inspiration amen i see him bring me thoughts and prayers and and dreams and songs amen i see him do what he said the bible said he would do amen because it's a living book praise god so you repent you remain humble trust in his power you remember that he's always faithful and then you keep all the commands god told joshua just keep every word of it amen i didn't hear you that's where these message people get so weak oh i can't keep all of it why not there's only one thing you need to keep all of it love paul said love keeps off the commands amen it's not like you gotta have this and that you just need one thing love and jesus said love is the greatest commandment amen huh they make it so hard wow this is so difficult just fall in love with jesus if you just fall in love with jesus if you just get born again by the holy spirit you'll love holiness amen and you'll keep all the word remember church there's 616 laws in the old testament and paul said love fulfills all of them go ahead and try most you can't most of me i can't even remember the first ten commandments who's got it memorized here maybe a couple people may god bless you if you do but who can remember all 616 but the nice thing is we don't have to remember we just got to remember love god with all your heart soul mind and strength and love your neighbor as yourself amen amen he makes it so easy just get the love of god and that's the power the love to keep all the commands and that's what joshua did he kept speaking he kept hearing people talk about be strong be strong he kept hearing it so much so he became it amen hallelujah that's what we're gonna be we're gonna keep talking about the rapture and talking about the holy ghost and talk about the promises of god until we go in the rapture amen amen whether through death or body change i'm going there i'm determined amen my mind is made up amen this home is not my world amen hallelujah heaven is my home amen because that's where my father is amen that's my homeland church i came out of god i was chosen in christ so that's my homeland god almighty amen and then he said you meditate upon them day and night you just talk about when you text somebody text them the word right well how was your week in the lord what'd you study love you in the lord you know just just keep on keep the word of god constantly on your mind and he said you'll finally find success in your life how do you want to be successful amen hey man that's a clue now i want to show bro bam said here how did abraham get stronger i just want to look at a few simple quotes he said but god kept his promise with abraham because abraham kept faith in god so god wasn't forcing abraham to be strong abraham had to make the choice to be strong because god god will not force anyone to heaven nor will he force anyone to hell it's all your choice he said whosoever will amen right if not they could say on the day of judgment god you had favorites you you sent me to hell and i didn't want to go no nobody's going to say god is not a just judge right but man talks about that in first 1965 he says no instead of getting weaker abraham got stronger oh that ought to encourage us as we get a little older praise god he went from 75 to 100 and each year he got a little stronger praise god yeah our bodies get weaker but his spirit got stronger praise god amen now that's what we've got to make sure we got to make sure each year we make it a little more tired we make it a little more gray right but we've got to get a little more stronger with our faith praise god if he could do it amen under the blood of bows and goats then surely the blood of jesus christ has made a way that we can get stronger in faith year after year amen amen hallelujah the bible said he was stronger given god praise he knowed it was going to happen see because god told him he had a revelation right no matter how long it lingers it's going to happen going to happen like people would say oh the bible said it's no different from the time our fathers fell asleep oh i've heard the coming of the lord since i was a kid i've heard brother and since i was a kid my mother said she heard her mother talk about it there's no such thing but the bible said he was not weak in faith the bible said he didn't even look at his own body amen oh let's stop looking at our bodies let's start looking at the word amen always keep your eyes on the word you can't look at the sin you can't look at physical things you've got to look at eternal things amen in other words you've got to have spiritual eyes amen so you can understand spiritual things praise god he said when he was about a hundred years old neither the deadness of sarah's womb he was dying his wife's womb was dead and he said i'm not even considering that talk about a holy roller amen everybody else say no father of nations huh father nations no children he said glory to god it's thus saith the lord amen hallelujah god himself told me not saith the lord amen hallelujah and god himself said thus saith the lord we've seen our last sight amen and we've made ourselves ready by recognizing the last sign amen the discernment of the second poll amen the last sign he said thus saith the lord the last sign before the body change like genesis 17 amen right where god came and discerned sarah's heart behind the back the last sign the last time god visited before he visited for the final time amen the body change amen that's right so he staggered not uh yet he staggered at abimelech huh he's staggering out this proves we're perfect in heaven although imperfect on earth hallelujah praise god like job god is saying job god's in heaven god job is perfect job is perfect job is perfect and on earth god rebukes him amen and said you shouldn't have said this you must repent and ashes see that that's the difference between heaven and earth in heaven we don't stagger all god sees is the blood of jesus making us pure making us wine making us believers amen making us strong in faith amen so don't be discouraged if you haven't been strong for a few weeks days months or years if the if you're under the blood of jesus christ god doesn't see that he sees you coming to church and he sees you as you're staggering not at the plan of god amen you don't stagger you don't stumble because you're forgiven and you keep going you don't give up you keep going he didn't trip at the promise of god he didn't stumble over it and say i give up he said i believe it i'm going through i started with jesus and i'm going through that's what we are we're the seed of abraham and that's not just a quote from brother branham that's a quote from saint brother paul praise god brother paul gave us that quote any man or woman that has faith in jesus christ is the seed of abraham amen but he was strong in faith giving total silence to god in church is that what it says no the bible said he was giving glory i give you glory god you're gonna bring this to pass i don't know how you're gonna do it but your promise is yea and amen i know you can't lie i'm giving you glory i know there's a rapture coming i'm giving you glory i know it can't fail i'm abraham's seed he was strong in faith amen he had a backbone praise god he wasn't a wimp praise god he was strong and he always gave god praise thank you for sending me the rapture message thank you lord i give you glory thank you for sending me the holy ghost baptism message amen hallelujah thank you for sending me the message of the seven church age amen thank you for sending me the restoration message the bible's restored back to who it was brother brian the most churches they're not that way but we've got the apostolic pattern restored back to us amen hallelujah we go as we're led by the holy spirit because they that are the children of god are led by the by the holy spirit they are the sons of god now he was partially persuaded that when he had promised maybe he was going to perform it goodness gracious no he was fully persuaded right service after service word after word the word convinced him and he grew stronger knowing i know god's going to bring this to pass i see all these uniting signs amen i see all the modern events making prophecy clear amen hallelujah that's what we see today praise god lord willing i was listening to some videos yesterday lord willing if i want to do this too for the the false prophets i want to bring out all these false prophets that they were talking about chronovirus the presidency and then all the other ones there's a bunch of them just to kind of give you some uh just to kind of give you a heads up we've got to be very careful who we listen to praise god going to be very lit very careful what we sing and who we follow and everything like that be very careful let me just tell you the one i was looking at uh paula white she was trump's advisor now i like trump some in some ways i voted for him but his do you know his his uh religious advisor was paula white do you know she's been married three times and do you know her and her husband say it's okay for a couple to watch porn together now that's straight from hell i thought i thought there was a mouse back there somebody i thought i heard like a mouse chirping back there sir now he might be brother or trump seemed like a good man now i'm just saying i forgot about that i forgot i was like man and there's so many other false prophecies that these people gave we got to be very careful now i've never listened to a paula white sermon and i don't plan on it but i do like trump and i do follow him you know and what is it called telegram i follow him down on telegram because they kicked him off all the other ones just like they're going to kick you off right because they're gonna eventually kick us off on youtube just for teaching the truth that's fine youtube doesn't save us the blood of jesus christ saves us praise god but i just thought wow it's so close to that we gotta be very careful what we're listening to praise god we're going to be very careful so i want to bring out some of just so you're aware some of these i was just shocked some of the things i heard people say uh someone on her show paula white someone on paula white's show was saying jesus is not the only begotten son of god he said because we're all begotten sons of god and she was like come on amen that's total heresy john 3 16 says he's the only begotten son they're talking about a son from a virgin womb that's what he's talking about we know we're begotten by the holy ghost amen i'm born again amen i'm begotten of god but not through the natural womb but through god's spiritual will amen yeah god's my mother and my father yes he's both praise god amen but she's like sitting there amen oh yeah amen he's not the only begotten that's that's that's from hell right that's a lie but the spirit of truth directs you to the word amen amen so i just want to let you know i've just seen some different thoughts on that and as much as i like trump i don't like pence much anymore because of what he did i still like trump a little bit praise god now so i just want to see well where where does abraham's testimony come in well we know he confessed his sins and he remembered our faith you know god i love this god came to him time and time to remember to remind him that he was gonna do this right all you gotta do is go to genesis 12 genesis 13 genesis 17 genesis 18 god keeps coming back and said i'm gonna give you a seed you're the father of nations and church that's how it is with us we would stumble we'd stagger but god is going to remind us amen god is going to keep bringing his word he's going to keep delivering it to us he's going to keep serving us up his word and we just got to receive it he's going to remind us of his faithfulness he's going to keep healing our sick praise god he's going to keep casting out devils amen he's going to keep filling people with the holy ghost amen he's going to remind us of his power and we've got to keep the commands i see he was constantly speaking glory glory i'm going to get a son glory i'm going to get him son glory i'm going to get a son through sarah sarah is a part of the promise glory even though we've got deadness in our bodies our reproductive bodies are they're dead but god is going to bring him back to life amen he just kept giving god glory one day thank god death is going to swallow this by this death up in life amen life is going to swallow up this body amen death will be swallowed up in life keep quoting the church it's going to happen praise god whether we do it live or whether we do it from the grave and we get there first it's going to happen yeah now look what it says you see now they the sinners they go out eat drink and be married see that they go out and start off because why there's never been any confirmation of it in their heart yet but when once god confirms that in your heart if you're a real seed of abraham instead of getting weaker as you see the days go by you'll get stronger all the time hallelujah church members that don't get stronger something's wrong they went off the holy ghost and they started feasting on the natural things caring too much about the natural more than the spiritual amen praise god if you're getting weaker spiritually it's because you're too you're getting stronger physically right you're you're you're flirting with the things of the world enjoying the things of the world too much praise god brother man tells us plainly this is about abraham how many still believe they're abraham's seed amen instead of getting weaker as you see the days go by you're getting stronger all the time you say well grandmother didn't see it mother didn't see it if i don't see it i'll be looking for it if i don't my children will see it i'm believing it i i fall asleep in the first second third watch he said either church age the first church age your last one those watches with your watches if i fall asleep in each one of them no matter where it is i awake in him that morning so i'm going to be ready believing that he's coming to this age hallelujah praise god i'll be happy to live the rest of my days and not see the rapture why because the rapture's already started inside of me praise god amen i've already heard the shout praise god amen that shout means a stimulating cry that's what it means it's a command it's a warning signal i've heard the first part of the rapture i've heard the shout go up make trim your lamps fill your oil with more fill your lap with more oil praise god amen go you out to meet him i'll be just as happy praise god to give the rest of my days another thing too because the word keeps opening each year brother saying god shows me more and more and more about his word like this week i just had a fresh revelation i always wondered why i was i never really quite understood the blasphemy of the holy ghost i knew it was calling uh you know something i knew it was calling the works of god and the devil but i'd i had kind of found the scripture i'd read it over and i just must have went like this which must went over my head but i was reading this week and mark and the bible jesus says that he said if you blast him the holy ghost he said it will not be forgiven you and then the very next verse says uh they blasphemed because they didn't have or because they called jesus that he had an unclean spirit now i'm really chopping that up so let's go read it please let's go read it here so it's mark chapter 3 i believe i'm not mistaken yeah it's 29 and 30. mark 3 29 30. i really i didn't have like a good understanding of that so what is blasting with the holy ghost it's calling the work of god of satan that's blasphemy right so where does it prove right here but he that shall blast him against the holy ghost hath never forgiveness but is in danger of eternal damnation because they said he had an unclean spirit and i said amen oh there it is right there i just i've i must have it must have slipped over my mind but see the bible says stir up your minds by way of remembrance that's right if you want to be stirred up if you want to be on fire again if you feel ashamed that you're not on fire get in god's word and help and he'll help you remember things amen that will help you in your life praise god amen hallelujah oh that was good to me i thought oh there it is mine i forgot all about that thank you jesus gave me a little give me a little simulation brother george a little stimulation by revelation i sure needed that that's right now here's two little images you know the bible gives us more than this but i just found two this morning and i just want to bring them out the bible says see now here it is you got to repent first right lay aside if you want to be strong i'm going to be strong lay aside all your malice your guile that's pretending hypocrisy right saying one thing doing the opposite envies are want to be like that person and all evil speaking don't say anything evil right you've got to lay aside you've got to repent of all your sins and as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby so see we're not going to grow unless we first confess our wrongs that's why people can come to message churches and they don't grow for days weeks months years decades because they get what i've seen when people leave the message they get complexes uh envyings or they get malice toward preachers or they speak evil and that's why they stop growing and pretty soon they just get used to not growing not being on fire for god and then pretty soon satan will have him shoot one of his arrows he builds up a complex and he shoots an arrow at somebody and then they start attacking the brothers in the message and now satan don't have to do much he let them fight hello and then they can't grow anymore they don't fall more in love with jesus they don't fast anymore they don't pray anymore they don't even witness anymore because they can't grow because they've cut off the food of god's word amen they've let devils move into their minds he said but this is how you grow confess all your sin and just start drinking on the milk of god amen hallelujah right just start drinking god's milk and grow up and pretty soon you'll grow up and you won't you won't get filled up on milk anymore then you need some meat praise god go to hebrews five yeah he responded that's where our memory verse was right no that was james 5. hebrews 5 forgive me now we've gone over this many times can preach it here last time he was here beautiful message that was a highly revelated message man that was straight from heaven i still believe that that message was straight from heaven and i thank the lord i think today's going to be too if we receive it praise god amen but like when cam was here we all got a poll if we all pull and pray we hear from heaven amen but that was a beautiful beautiful message my hebrews 5. now look at verse 14. but strong meat belonging to them that are full of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil let me just share with brother shang here you know because he and i had a bible study yesterday two and a half hours brother just talking about the good things of god so when when a church and this is what we're a little bit we're talking about that's why i mentioned him he was concerned about churches not they're dying right many churches are dying when they stop trying to discern is this good or evil should i say this or should i watch this or should i do this when they stop and say oh it's all good when they stop doing that they start dying right there they instead of instead of feasting on the meat of god's word and growing into a strong man instead of growing into as a christian and judging whether things are right or wrong they backslide and they start withering away and dying you ever seen those big muslim builders brother shang but then if they stop lifting all that flab comes down you ever seen that and they got wrinkles have you guys ever seen that well maybe uh maybe i'm the only one that's seen it you know if you get big muscles that stretches out your skin right but if you stop lifting you get stretch marks on there and then your flab hangs down what happened why aren't they getting stronger they stop working out right they stop breaking down the muscles and and when people stop when people when churches stop breaking down doctrines when people's when churches stop breaking down trends in society right then their spiritual muscles break down and they can't tell if makeup is okay they can't tell if customs okay anymore they can't tell uh if if pornography is okay or not the sports they can't tell because they stopped building their muscles but if they just keep building they'd chew on that thought they'd go study the word and they pretty soon to find the bible says avoid all appearance of evil amen that's real meat brother george amen avoid all appearance of evil so if you see evil shun it walk away praise god with the churches today like by the amen saw out in wisconsin or minnesota they invite drinking into the basement of the church so cena shows they're not even drinking milk brothers and sisters because they don't even know is drinking okay in the house of god this is the only kind of drink and that well there's two kinds then that this and then there's the holy ghost wine praise god that's what you used to be drinking today praise god amen hallelujah amen actually actually two kinds of wine we should be drinking today a little sip of that because jesus said so because it's a figure it's just a symbol of what we should be doing the rest of the time yeah enjoying the world amen hallelujah praise god that's how you grow so they can't say it was jay-z right or not is it okay to listen to beyonce or not and they say no it's okay right there they stop growing right and they're gonna die right they're gonna get lost in sin and possibly go to hell because they stop because what does she bring in she brings in lusts and she brings in all kinds and now lust isn't in here but you well envy right yeah oh that person's got a more handsome husband than i who do and that that that woman's got a prettier that man's got a prettier girlfriend than i do see what that music does it destroys people's souls but the word of god is here to build you up praise god amen the songs we heard this morning i'll build my life upon the word of god that's what we're doing amen we're building our lives truth upon truth upon truth word upon word line upon lies here little there a little that's you and i feasting on the strength of god if so be i've tasted that the lord is gracious have you tasted it i'm tasting this morning it's pretty good it's pretty good i'll taste it last night too it's pretty good praise god i'll taste it yesterday the day before god's word tastes great amen that's just the milk what about the meat now here's a second illustration finally brethren be strong in the lord and the power of his mind well how do i get strong paul put on the armor of god amen slide it on church get you guys put your belt your brother's got your belts on this morning slide it on fred i had to put on my belt and tighten it up i'm going out to war praise god you got to know so in other words you got to put an anointing on right put the anointing on right the girt up the loins of your mind be ready for a mind battle right helmet of salvation i know i'm saying praise god amen jesus righteousness protects my heart it's his righteousness that covers my dirty heart amen praise god i've got feet ready to go i got feet ready to go to church i got feet a witness i got feet to do what god's called me to do praise god amen and i've got faith that can stop every temptation amen it's written satan says this you should do that it's written the word of god says that praise god amen faith blocks it but you got to put it on how many want to be strong you better put it on praise god amen he said put it on the whole armor of god that you could able be able to stand against the wiles of satan praise god and then that last thing he said the sword of the holy spirit amen quick sharper you want a quick victory start speaking that word amen start saying it's written devil amen i'm saying satan get behind me amen take that word and start using it start attacking it pretty soon he's going to flee you cut him enough times that devil's going to flee just like if you got punched or beaten a few times you'd pretty soon give up that's how satan is jesus just gave him three brother bride he just gave him three good whacks one two three and the bible said he rested he was so tired though the angels had to come and anoint him praise god three big strikes but thus saith it was written it's wretched it's written and i'm exhausted somebody come give me some strength and god sent holy angels oh you know god's gonna send you an angel you fight for god you know god's gonna send you an angel amen to strengthen you praise god amen the thing is fight for him amen the thing is put it on praise god put on the word of god put on the armor of god and stand there strong so we got those two so far eat on the word that's delicious taste on that grow up the other thing is put it on saints strap it on yep slide it on there i'm sorry i'm right-handed so i put it on get ready for battle if you want to be strong you got to get ready for battle praise god now remember that's the order now this i got a few more scriptures on strength and i got uh what i got 20 minutes oh that's pretty i'm pretty surprised it usually goes a lot faster than that now here's another thing this all now the church just all fits together it fits in the same thing it'll all fit in here now prayer prayer many times is going to be this right speaking and meditate that's what you do when you pray you talk to god right you're speaking to god say god forgive that person god forgive me god help me to have victory today help me not to be afraid that's what i pray i will not fear praise god amen perfect love casts out all fear i'll not be scared of the squeeze that johnny and i talk about that one time and satan every now and then he'll throw me a a a fear devil like scared about the squeeze right we talked about that so i went home after that no we i remember john and i talked about it i went in my prayer closet i wrote on there i will not be afraid of the squeeze i will not fear the spirit of the lord is my strength amen i just stared at that for a couple days and pretty soon i wasn't afraid anymore amen because i needed i need that word i need that word to build me up you got to speak it amen you got to speak the word you got to meditate upon it how could how could xerxes let esther go through the uh the death he wouldn't because he loved her how much more if that's a love of a man a heathen man how much more the blood of the love of jesus christ amen the heavenly bridegroom protecting his bride amen how much more praise god amen how much more when the government's after you is the heavenly bridegroom going to turn everything around for us at the very last moment praise god amen no reason to fear us sir praise god no reason to fear little bride amen jehovah's with us amen just speak the word you'll succeed you'll overcome the devil you'll make it through the squeeze just speak the word amen i don't know that's if we live to see it right that's if we live to see it it might be the next generation but i said it might be my grandchildren my great-grandchildren that's if we live to see it so why fear now let's be strong and very courageous that's so that's something i battle often i fear i battle that so i need the word of god to overcome amen now how do you build up your faith the bible says there's going to be mockers in the last time who walk after their own god they're going to be mocking christians but they can do they can fulfill all their lust they want now they separate themselves from the bride because they're sensual they don't have the holy spirit so that means some people are going to come in our churches pretty soon they're going to mock us and leave and the real reason they left is because they love the things of the world more than they loved the word of god they're going to leave sisterhood because they weren't born again but amen they're going to leave because they were more excited about worldly things than about the word oh my he said but ye beloved build up yourselves all right so we're talking about being strong right build up yourselves on your most holy faith how brother praying in the holy ghost oh my you want to be stronger pray more amen you want to be stronger pray more but pray in the holy spirit in other words don't tell god what to do say god here's what i want but let your will be done amen that's praying in the spirit letting god's will be done make your requests on unto god and then pray and say god let your will be done and lord keep me in your love amen help me to love those like shane was shane was talking with people that were speaking bad about me and it's okay buddy it's okay because i love them too and i've known that many people told me that so this week shane was talking with some people that you know they don't like me at all but you know what i love them and if they ever needed my help i would help them out and i and i've done that people that have left our church i've showed them love i've sent them gift cards i've told them i've greeted them with love i pray for them praise god any way that disagree with me the difference between us should be the love of god right now hopefully if someone disagrees you both got the love of god right right we've had that too we can still be holy ghostfield saints and disagree but either way we're to pray and if we want to we want to really show the love of christ we got to build up our faith and what is faith assurance so you pray amen you pray until you're assured in your heart you know in your heart god is with you amen and then the love of god moves you forward you keep yourself living in love even if god don't answer my prayers i still love everybody even if god doesn't do what i want to do i still love him amen and i'll still love my enemies praise god and i'll still say this father forgive them they don't know what they're doing that's real love that's the love of christ so he says pray in the holy ghost build yourself up pray in the spirit keep yourself make sure you're always in love with everybody that's why i don't understand why people more people can't smile if you got the love of god how can you not smile you're full of god's love praise god right you you got the love of god amen you want to love people praise god looking you're looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ oh wow so you're pr so when you pray in the holy spirit yours you still see i need god's mercy i'm not perfect sometimes i fall short of god's glory i'm looking for his mercy oh yeah yeah church absolutely i'm looking for god's mercy too give me uh i got 13 more minutes so see praying well you know where it kind of fits in here now i'm just i'm just giving you this as an outline for joshua right this is kind of how god talked to joshua i need to fix that one there's something else in there but here praying would go down here just like giving god glory praise god hallelujah he's going to do the body change he's going to bring forth the seed right and then you pray and you keep speaking the word and meditating upon the word that makes you stronger amen now i hope that's your testimony and i told you this a few weeks ago 2020 really showed me i got stronger in the lord because before that brother johnny i was scared to talk to joseph branham and i was scared to talk to rod bergen god knows my heart i was totally scared to do it but what happened the lord built me up in strength right i kept feasting on his word i just kept growing in his word and then god helped me to do things i never thought brother brian i'd be ever able ever to do a stuttering preacher like me a spitting preacher like me a forgetful preacher like me and yet that's the one god wanted to use i don't know how it worked out that way but i'm just saying look at your life for 2020. hopefully you can see growth amen and i'll say like this i want you to see growth this year as well amen hallelujah we should be growing right now praise god things that may have seemed impossible last year oh they should be getting closer amen we should be getting closer to achieving the promises of god amen i was praying for my parents last night and i got a text right after i got up from my no i got a text right out and it kind of dings on my watch you know because you can have notifications i i i expected oh is this going to be my mom got saved now it wasn't but i'm just trying to show you that's what i want to be i want to be in anticipation of god fulfilling his word i was just praying i was speaking her name and my dad's name and other ones in prayer i got out of the prayer closet and i got that thing and i thought oh is this going to be my mom getting saved and it wasn't i said praise god is going to happen anyway because i'm not getting weaker i'm getting stronger praise god i'm trusting it's god's will to save her i don't know but i'm trusting it's god's will to be merciful and bring her to the message i'm going to i'm just going to keep praying and trusting praise god how many times have i prayed for you over the years but shane i hope you prayed for me too buddy how many times we pray for sister who over the years amen how many times did bang pray for his family you know how many think about that all the years we see we we get stronger we're not supposed to get weaker we're supposed to get stronger hey man my victory's closer than it's ever been ava i'm closer to the finish line than i've ever been hallelujah praise god i'm closer amen so i should be stronger praise god not weaker not a pushover i should be stronger be strong in the lord now here's another scripture that shows paul says i commend you to god i'm committing i'm leaving you in god's care and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up god's grace what's going to build you up the grace of god the word of god as it's preached to you shane and i went yesterday to ephesians 4 where the bible said the five preaching gifts are gonna build you up they're gonna edify you they're gonna complete you amen glory amen they keep building you up building up that's what builds up a believer the real preaching of the word not some dead sermon where they've got no holy ghost we need the power of the holy ghost amen we need the word of the holy spirit we need a god who's here right now praise god i know he is amen hallelujah if we can all just yield to him praise god and give him glory and praise what's able to build you up the word of his grace is going to make you stronger if you're just drinking just drink but some of us are over here give us some time we're eating on the meat that's why i have to preach sometimes brother amen an hour and a half because it takes a long time to chew that meat up yeah it's not just a quick drink like you can go to for a 15-minute sermon now i am going to preach one of those this week just so you know brother ben narada started an online outreach so i think i'm one of his first preachers it's on thursday and i'm going to preach a 20-minute sermon imagine that 20 minutes now 20 minutes how's that going to happen we've got all things are possible brother jose well just so you know i'll try to send the link to the church if i remember i thought that was a great desire you know people can't leave their homes maybe people are well no doubt people are searching on youtube you know for give me something give me some they probably don't even know what they're looking for right yeah but we're trusting god can find some soul there so i'm going to be preaching thursday i think it's like five o'clock or six o'clock i don't know i'll have text everybody i kind of forgot about it i kind of forgot to write it down so i have to do that now look he's going to commit you to god to the word and the word will give you inheritance oh these are all these are all promises that god's going to bless you with amen you got a crown waiting in heaven saints you got a mansion waiting in heaven praise god you've got cities if you're holy ghostfield state you've got cities to rule in the millennium amen that's your inheritance praise god amen and i'll tell you the best thing is you get to see praise jesus you get to see jesus amen you get to see him in his love amen that's the greatest inheritance you could ever have to fall down at his feet and worship jesus for eternity that's the greatest will you could ever receive amen amen that jesus loves me and he granted me eternal life see i could do without the crown i could do without the the treats of gold but i could not do without jesus ah you can have this whole world just give me jesus amen you can have facebook you can have twitter you can have the millions and the trillions you can have silicon valley just give me jesus amen hallelujah i didn't know i was going to preach like this today praise god gotta feel like i'm an evangelist today now this is what brother amen was thinking about build according to the grace of god which is given to me as a wise master builder i've laid the foundation and another build of their own so paul laid the foundation of the new testament right he taught the very first things you need to believe as a new testament believer but he said after that the preachers would build upon it oh glory yeah that's right we got to build for our generation we have a message our message is restoration [Laughter] so we're building that second to last piece right and then jesus is the lat he's the headstone that comes down from heaven glory i've never seen it like that before for other foundation can no man lay that is laid which is jesus christ yeah if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones would hay stubble every man's work should be made manifest for they shall declare it because it is revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is if any man's work abide which he hath built upon he shall receive a reward in other words the fiery trials of this life are going to prove whether my ministry went whether i was building with the right materials or not praise god i'm trusting i am because i'm trying to give all you guys thus saith the lord praise god i'm trying to give you right out of here if it's my thoughts i'll tell you this is my opinion i think this is brother bran's opinion but when it comes right out of the word that ain't brother man's opinion that's thus saith the lord amen amen and that's a building stone amen that's a stone to build your life upon praise god if it's a word confession if it's a word stone build stone upon stone word upon word build it up it becomes a temple unto god that's what the bible says if your work abides when the fiery trials come you get a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer lost but he himself shall be saved so as by fire so there's gonna be a lot of people that go to heaven they don't have any reward they just get saved that's their only reward is to be saved that's all they get because the fire of the trials are gonna prove they didn't build with thus saith the lord thank god we got thus saith the lord my goodness thank god it's not thus saith the seminary can you imagine that brother john was trying to join johnny this is thus a doctor so-and-so oh my we got dr jesus praise god we got the best seminary there ever was heaven amen the best teacher the holy ghost professor praise god the professor holy ghost is going to come in and teach us some lessons today i like that amen now therefore ye are no more strangers than foreigners but you're fellow citizens with the saints of the household of god and you are built see you are built upon the foundation of the apostles jesus christ in other words you and i are only as stable as the stones below us oh my that's why that's why they all shouted out brother brahm we're resting on the fact that you preach what paul preached amen because paul had laid the stones and then brother branham laid the stones and we're all standing on those stones brother you can't knock these stones down amen hallelujah because this is the rock this is the foundation rock amen let the storms come but these rocks are going to stand amen you can't move these rocks brother these are holy ghosts eternal rocks amen honey that's what we're resting on the bible says that's our foundation and the cornerstone of all of it is jesus so you keep going down okay where did luther rest on okay uh let me inspect this uh foundation okay uh what did polycarp okay okay we're almost on the bottom here's paul okay great now where's paul's foundation you go a little farther there's jesus it's jesus jesus is the foundation stone and then if you come back up there he is jesus is coming as the capstone amen he's the first and the last amen the alpha and the omega amen hallelujah just keep searching out pretty soon it's all going to come back yeah there's jesus there oh and there's jesus right there glory amen that's why everything we teach about shane can go right back to the bible because he's at the bottom he's gonna be at the top too praise god we meet him in the air god's own son will be the headstone one at the meeting in whom all the buildings so we're he's likening us now we're like a building we're fitly framed together we grow up into this holy temple of the lord in whom you're also building together for an inhabitation of god don't you know church that's what we're supposed to be we're supposed to be like a temple that god can sweep down in through here every service and that what the bible said we're supposed to be a dwelling place for the holy spirit i know it because brother amen will start singing i'll start feeling the spirit i'll start crying and praising the lord pretty soon i come up here i start preaching in the holy spirit and pretty soon the holy spirit's all around amen and he's trying to meet the needs of the saints amen might just be god wants you to give him glory today like abraham might be he wants to heal your body right like how many times brother jose been healed here praise god how many times mosey my goodness 10 15 20 times he's been healed by the holy spirit year after year remember her sister whoever when that you said you felt the wind of the holy spirit come through through that wall right there and healed you you were sick that day remember you got healed but brother amen was a little sick after that now sometimes i've been sick and god will heal somebody else right sometimes blame it i'll be sick and i'll pray for somebody they'll get healed and i won't because it's god working out his will for his glory jesus would heal people and then we know he got sick he went go he'd go out in the boat he'd be sick you know he it's all according to god's will god don't promise us everything we want but he gives us everything we need amen all right coming down to the final thoughts here well i didn't think i was gonna go this direction man thank the lord now the bible says as you have received christ jesus the lord walk in him yeah rooted and built up so now look you got both directions strange you're rooted you're growing down but you're also growing up like a wheat plant praise god did you know that they go both ways right i'm going both ways i'm going deeper in the depths of love i'm going higher in heavenly places all the time praise god i'm establishing the faith as you have been taught abounding there and with thanksgiving thank you for 2020 lord it was a blessing although i got coronavirus you'd slay the demon of coronavirus in my body praise god now i know 99.9 of people do but they they're just it's just a shame they don't recognize it was jesus amen i just happened to recognize it was jesus amen and i'll keep thanking him amen thank you jesus amen because we must give thanks in the name of the lord he's the only healer that's right i've yet to hear anthony fauci say he's a healer of chronovirus he's not jesus christ is the only healer of coronavirus so beware you don't get spoiled through man-made traditions things of the world let me find a clay place to close i better i i want to close with this i'm going to skip ahead where is it you're all so patient thank you yeah let me close i just want to close with this thought so here that was an hour so that was exactly now that's when it goes to this thought church if you're strong when you and i are strong there's nobody that can stand before us and defy jesus christ they'll come and stand there for a while like satan satan come and stood there before jesus for a while but pretty soon he had to go we know he's going to come it's not that people don't come and challenge you but the difference is that you don't let that devil in you send them away amen you don't let them take shop in your mind and start lusting or you know stealing or murdering or wrath no you send him back into dry places take all your lies and go back to hell where you came from go to dry places for you're not welcome here because i'm a soldier of the lord i'm fighting for jesus amen hallelujah i'm a strong christian praise god i'm not a weak christian i'm not a foolish virgin i'm a wise virgin amen i know how to handle this praise god that's what people are asking no well why do we need brother brother they're asking that on youtube this morning why we need brother brown because he directs us to the word of the day in other words he directs us for the tools of today amen praise god he gives us the tools which are the revelations right because the the mysteries are finished in this day right and we partake of them they're honey in our mouth but they're bitter in our belly and when we eat them they're billet they're bitter but they make us go speak it again right we speak it again we keep speaking it we share it we eat it we become it just like joshua pretty soon we start speaking it amen when we meditate upon it when we speak it when we listen to it it just becomes us and we speak the revelation of god wow hallelujah amen so joshua if you read joshua chapter 12 i don't expect you to read that in fact haven't you read it recently i read it you know a couple months ago i was making through my way through the old testament he defeated 31 kings saints 31 kings and only two men that i found could stand before him all the days of his life just two think about that someone gave a testimony about you shang was a mighty warrior for jesus he only really stumbled twice my i would rejoice if somebody said that about if jesus said that about me he only stumbled twice glory remember with david the bible said he only really stumbled with bathsheba right where he purposely disobeyed god's word god help us i just want you to be encouraged 31 right 31. now here's what i want to just show this i made a list a few years ago and will this help if i yeah that would help church how many do you believe you're in the central promised land amen now here's just 14 church here's just 14 demons now think about this if you kept god's word this year or you know the last few months if these temptations came to you and you resisted them you did the same thing joshua did sometimes we forget how strong god has actually made us when was the last time you got an evil you got someone trying to bring you a false prophecy they do it all the time right brother we talk about it they do it all the time trying to guess what the rapture is going to be here raps are going to be here donald trump's going to win thus saith the lord all the that's a that's a familiar spirit and look if we overcame that and we didn't get under that anointing what happened we just slew that devil we just defeated that king i'm not going to speak for god unless he puts a word in my mouth you might have been you might have been tempted to say something wrong you might have been tempted to uh falsely predict something but what came around the holy spirit came around you defeated that and you slew the enemy and there you stand victorious now i could go through the rest of these but i hope you understand what i'm saying spirit of divination right jealousy someone tried to make you jealous over somebody in the church but instead of getting jealous you got happy for him and you slew that devil right where he was i'm gonna be happy i'm gonna be thankful praise god amen you walk out of church saying praise god i'm not gonna be jealous thank you god for blessing our sister i know my blessings coming around too praise god how many devils have we taken down this last year lying spirit oh don't tell your wife that or don't tell your husband that no this is what happened what happened you just defeated satan amen just like jesus amen you took the word you defeated him some young people ought to be saying amen back there praise god you could have lied to your parents you could have lied to somebody but you told the truth oh you're a mighty warrior praise god hallelujah you put on the armor of god that day i bet some of my children tell me that last few weeks they were going to lie to me but they come up and told me the truth what happened they just whipped satan now satan's over he's quite a foe but he's not quite a foe compared to the word of god hallelujah oh somebody ought to be saying amen out there pride how many times do we get pride of the spirit spirit of perversity oh bro jesse you won that debate no i didn't win the debate jesus won it right that's oh you're you're such a great preacher i'm nothing right there we just defeated the devil hey praise god amen i remember my church is small i'm nobody i'm nothing who am i i can't do anything on my own what happened we just slayed that demon of pride we listened to a lamp fighter book called the giants right the giant of pride that was the last giant wasn't it america the giant of pride trying to get you exalted and look how great you are i'm nothing i know i'm nothing i wake up every morning and i realize more and more brother george i'm nothing i wake up tired exhausted or mean or cranky or upset or something like that i gotta work out of that i gotta put on the armor of god until i finally feel like a strong man praise god amen praise god i gotta start drinking on that milk until pretty soon now let me get some of that meat ah this is good now now i feel strong praise god what do you got to do you got to overcome that devil and you got to slay some some kings yourself hallelujah spirit of whoredoms how many times brothers we got to overcome this how many times brothers oh my when you get the victory you stand there and jesus said he said i'm proud of you that's my boy right there you slay i won't think about that i won't try to get the number i won't try to look at that and you get the victory and you're all tired and worn out jesus like to praise god send him some angels go encourage him answer one of his go give him one of the answers of his prayers amen that's my son praise god amen you just slayed those man because we're more than corkers in christ jesus let's be strong in the lord and the power is might yes let's stand to our feet you might overcome the spirit of infirmity cancer asthma allergies how about coronavirus that's what i was saying how many devils did the lord slay through my life last year i know fear on many ways and many occasions multiple occasions how about the pestilence that was in my body the devil the devil lied or the devil got defeated jesus slew him and then the bible says that we're kings and priests well i really i just didn't do it i just spoke his word and yet he'll call you a king he'll call you a queen because you took his word and you put on the armor of god it was never your armor right it wasn't your strength it was his strength are you thankful his strength is made perfect in your weakness musicians you can come now we want to see this we want to see more miracles mental illness dumb death seizures epilepsy spirit of bondage there it is spirit of bondage that's the king that's the evil king the holy spirit slew in my life last year i don't get me wrong he'll probably come back again that's okay jesus ain't gonna leave me he said as i was with brother branham so will i be with you brother george amen hallelujah as i was with moses so would i be with england amen spirit of fear seducing spirits the spirit of the antichrist spirit of air spirit of death in church you remember brother brahm said all those all those kings were just types of spirits he said you're not ready to live until you get the holy ghost and now you can really start fighting oh my goodness thank the lord you know we've been talking with my family this week and we've realized how many people that are in our family they're so afraid of coronavirus they're camping out in their houses they're not going anywhere and some of our family members won't even come see us because we're with a bunch of people that don't wear masks and i'm glad you don't wear a mask the bible calls that you're guileless right the mask of hypocrisy i don't we don't have to wear the physical mask and we definitely don't want to wear that spiritual mask of hypocrisy i don't want to be a hypocrite i want to be a real christian amen i don't want to wear a mask i want to live and

prayer here think about that maybe i didn't come out the way i wanted to maybe but god has showed us how to be strong now church there's those three steps let's meditate on those as we close in prayer if there's anything you need to repent of i ask you to do it now i believe the lord is asking us to do it now because he said be strong and very [Music] courageous if there's anyone not humble and they're they're trusting in their own ability may you say god forgive me i'm going to humble myself that you might exalt me in due season [Music] i have no power of my own i have no ability lord i'm

think about the word all the time let's pray heavenly father forgive any one lord that sinned and hasn't confessed it we know the devil has the right to stay there in their lives if they won't confess it but i pray in jesus christ's name may the spirit of conviction come in this building hallelujah i know it's already here lord god and may you convict every heart they'll feel guilty of their sins and they'll confess and say forgive me jesus [Music] i don't want to do that again i repent in jesus name grant that lord god if there's anyone that needs to repent just do it right now please do right now say you're sorry another lord you're guilty it's your fault [Music] and ask for his forgiveness now in humility lord god we realize we have no power we're trusting in your grace let your
