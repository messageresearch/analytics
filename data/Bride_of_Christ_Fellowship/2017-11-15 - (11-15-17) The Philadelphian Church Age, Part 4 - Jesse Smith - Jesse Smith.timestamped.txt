[42:37] want to end by showing the plan of

[42:45] that the Bible club and so I've kind of
[42:48] prepared to show just a simple outline

[42:52] and the thought just kind of came to me
[42:55] why don't you show that you know since
[42:57] we have visitors tonight and I'm not
[42:59] sure how clearly the gospel has ever
[43:00] been presented but you know there
[43:02] there's a criticism among you know
[43:04] churches that follow the message that
[43:05] they don't preach the cross enough you
[43:07] know and I I don't want to be guilty of
[43:10] that by God's grace the cross is our
[43:12] only source of strength
[43:14] amen we cannot gain any strength from
[43:17] any man or any woman like there's no
[43:19] strength in a human there's only
[43:20] strength in Jesus Christ for the joy of
[43:24] the Lord is our strength
[43:26] we don't get a strength for anything
[43:28] else but it's God's holy spirit that
[43:30] gives us strength we can be encouraged
[43:31] by of course our prophet and and our
[43:34] brothers have you know our sisters in
[43:35] the Lord we can be courage by everybody
[43:37] we needed a prophet no doubt about that
[43:39] no doubt no no doubt we believe that
[43:41] with all of our hearts here but
[43:43] ultimately salvation comes down to us
[43:44] and Jesus cry
[43:45] will we accept Jesus Christ as the Son
[43:49] of God so look at part 4 here tonight by
[43:53] the grace of the Lord we did our text I
[43:55] remember John Wesley's our messenger
[43:57] Philadelphia Church age there's a little
[43:59] more light in this age and the Sardis
[44:00] Age Sunday we spent a lot of time at the
[44:04] end looking at the synagogue of Satan
[44:06] and how jesus promised jesus promised
[44:09] all the liars all the pretenders all the
[44:11] synagogue of Satan and he said even
[44:13] churches that aren't Jewish anyone that
[44:16] says their spirit filled and are not and
[44:18] are lying they're all gonna have to come
[44:21] to the white throne judgment and bow at
[44:23] the feet of Christ and guess who's
[44:26] standing next to Christ you and I Amen
[44:28] so they bow at our feet they bound
[44:30] worship at our feet but they're not
[44:32] bowing to us or worshiping us we are
[44:35] just there when they're bowing to Jesus
[44:37] Christ so I hope everybody caught that
[44:39] by God's grace that's that was the
[44:41] thought there and I'm gonna spend a
[44:42] little more time on the synagogue of
[44:43] satan' because if you know the
[44:45] progression of the church age book we're
[44:46] not there yet we'll get there by the
[44:49] grace of Lord but remember we're looking
[44:51] at this time period so just in in my
[44:53] mind we're looking at this time period
[44:55] so we're looking at about you know 200
[44:57] 300 years ago 1750 to 1906 we're looking
[45:00] at that time period remember you know of
[45:03] course Luther Martin Luther lived in
[45:05] that day John Wesley's living in this or
[45:07] lived in this church age we're talking
[45:09] about today I remember and then our
[45:11] prophet lived from 1906 to 1965 and and
[45:15] I just used this slide from last time
[45:18] the hour temptation was prophetic he's
[45:20] Jesus spoke it to the Philadelphia
[45:22] church age but there's a lap over and it
[45:24] actually applied to our age because we
[45:26] know dispensations carryover promises
[45:29] carry over into different dispensations
[45:31] the Philadelphia Church H of course
[45:34] Philadelphia is a city in Turkey this is
[45:36] like the zoomed out picture there we're
[45:39] looking at the Philadelphia Church age
[45:40] which was a real city that had a real
[45:43] Church and John sent them a real letter
[45:46] but that letter was prophetic they
[45:48] received it you know sometime after 80
[45:50] 90 or 95 but it actually spoke to the
[45:53] future events of the 1700s now we've
[45:57] gone through some really nice
[45:58] progression I'm
[45:59] happy well this is my 43rd sermon on the
[46:02] church ages themselves I'm pretty happy
[46:04] about that
[46:05] plus I've preached sermons on
[46:07] introducing the church ages and then all
[46:09] the symbols are not all but many symbols
[46:11] in the book of Revelation so I probably
[46:13] have over 50 or you know 55 sermons on
[46:15] Revelation I hope you're blessed by
[46:18] God's grace amen
[46:19] cam said he just preached 50 sermons on
[46:21] the seals I thought that was really
[46:22] encouraging and that's the thought
[46:24] brother Graham said you could spend
[46:25] months on just one one church age he
[46:28] said or one seal he said you could spend
[46:30] months just on that one and so I've
[46:32] tried to shorten them I've tried to just
[46:34] you know preach what I felt led to
[46:36] preach so I preached five on Laodicea
[46:38] you know two years ago and though that's
[46:41] the progression we've gone through so I
[46:42] kind of start with a label to see it cuz
[46:43] I didn't know when the rapture was gonna
[46:44] come I thought well we better start with
[46:46] later to see us so we know our church
[46:48] age first but God's given us grace you
[46:51] know and God may give us more grace you
[46:53] know we may there may be more
[46:54] generations we don't know the day in the
[46:56] hour but I just felt burdened to get
[46:57] that to the people in case the erhaps
[47:00] sure did come so brother Branham said
[47:03] every believer goes down thinking the
[47:04] rapture is gonna take place anytime soon
[47:07] he said so that when they're raised
[47:09] they're expecting it
[47:11] they went out expecting it so when
[47:13] they're raised they they have their
[47:15] expectation hallelujah remember there's
[47:20] benefits of these teachings remember
[47:21] brother Branham said the reason he
[47:22] taught it was to give us a basis to give
[47:25] us a settling you know I've talked to
[47:27] individuals and one individual
[47:28] particular said one thing I want more
[47:30] than anything else as a Christian is to
[47:32] have a settled life they just want to
[47:34] they they're they're tired of being
[47:36] tossed to and fro they're tired of not
[47:38] knowing this am I saved am I am i
[47:40] sanctified in my field the Holy Ghost
[47:41] what do I got
[47:43] they're so tired they just want one
[47:44] thing to be settled in church we can be
[47:47] settled by Jesus Christ amen
[47:48] we don't have to be wandering and tossed
[47:50] to and fro them I saved or am I born
[47:52] again or what it what am I you can know
[47:55] what you are you're a child of God amen
[47:57] you're redeemed son or daughter of God a
[48:00] man you can know that but you got to sit
[48:03] still let God work with your heart you
[48:05] got to be humble you got to be obedient
[48:07] you have to repent you have to be sweet
[48:09] to the Holy Spirit now I'm going to skip
[48:12] past this one but basically
[48:13] I'm saying you can't preach
[48:14] verse-by-verse as an evangelist it has
[48:16] to be a pastoral ministry that's from
[48:18] adoption now here's something I haven't
[48:20] know if you've seen this lately has
[48:22] anybody read the introduction in the
[48:24] church age book lately he's anybody read
[48:25] that I think other than brother Adam
[48:26] maybe in the introduction I want you to
[48:29] see some pretty important things here
[48:31] now I hope I hope you can say Amen to
[48:34] these quotes I hope by God's grace and
[48:37] let me say this I read the church age
[48:40] book before I even started preaching so
[48:43] that was literally the foundational
[48:44] teaching that I had before I even
[48:47] started preaching and then if you know
[48:50] well if you've been here a while then
[48:52] you know I preached on the seals in
[48:54] 2007-8 sister bo is here my wife was
[48:56] here bang was here the Grahams were here
[48:59] that might have been it Carrie and a
[49:01] lady might a minute I preached on the
[49:03] seals in two thousand seven or eight
[49:05] nine somewhere around there I can't
[49:06] remember the exact year but listen to
[49:09] this quotation and listen to what the
[49:10] Prophet says about the importance of the
[49:13] church age how many believe these
[49:14] sermons are important honey believe
[49:15] these 43 sermons have been crucial or
[49:19] the bram said they're absolutely
[49:20] essential it's not optional like well
[49:23] it'd be a good idea sometime brother
[49:25] Amen if you want to preach the church
[49:26] ages you know no it's not even optional
[49:29] it is absolutely essential to know these
[49:31] things if you don't know the symbols and
[49:34] the revelations of the first few
[49:35] chapters then you don't even know you
[49:37] can't even decode the rest of the book
[49:38] you can't if you won't accept what the
[49:40] Holy Spirit said the first three
[49:42] chapters
[49:42] you're gonna miss what he says in the
[49:43] rest I don't know about you but I want
[49:45] to understand what he says at the
[49:46] beginning because if I understand the
[49:48] beginning the book like brother man said
[49:49] you can understand the end we want to
[49:51] understand the whole book through this
[49:54] volume this is introduction will concern
[49:58] I'm sorry though this volume will
[50:00] concern itself with various major
[50:01] doctrines God had water baptism found in
[50:03] Revelation chapters one through three
[50:05] its main theme is the setting forth of a
[50:08] detailed study the seven churches now
[50:09] look at this next slide this is
[50:12] necessary not optional it's necessary
[50:15] for your walk with God it's necessary in
[50:19] order to understand I'm sorry to study
[50:20] and understand the rest of pardon me the
[50:24] revelation so it's absolutely necessary
[50:27] can anybody say amen to that four out of
[50:30] the ages come the seals and out of the
[50:32] seals come the trumpets and now the
[50:34] trumpets come the vials like the first
[50:37] burst of a roman candle
[50:39] so roman candles like a big long
[50:41] cylinder like a pop can shape and they
[50:44] have all these balls in here right and
[50:45] it shoots out one first but there's more
[50:47] balls left in there then another than
[50:48] another and it keeps going so all the
[50:50] balls are gone all those little
[50:52] fireballs right well that's what he's
[50:54] saying that the the book of Revelation
[50:55] is it's like that first blast of fire is
[50:58] the church ages then the seals the
[51:00] trumpets then the vials
[51:01] it just keeps blowing out more power
[51:04] more light of God and so we can't get
[51:06] the other lights until we get the first
[51:08] light does everyone understand that
[51:10] that's his illustration you can't get
[51:12] the other understandings unless you
[51:13] understand the church ages first this is
[51:17] what the Prophet wrote he says like the
[51:20] first verse of Roman can of the church
[51:21] age has come forth with the mighty
[51:23] initial illumination which without which
[51:27] there could be no further light so
[51:31] according the prophet of God you can't
[51:32] even understand the seals the trumpets
[51:34] or the vowels without first being
[51:36] illuminated to see the truth of the
[51:39] seven church ages how many believe that
[51:41] you believe that that's pretty powerful
[51:43] that's pretty and to me it makes sense
[51:45] oh now I see why the Holy Spirit led me
[51:47] to the church age book the very first
[51:49] book I read after I got saved hallelujah
[51:51] why why would he do that because in
[51:54] order for me to understand the rest of
[51:55] the book I had to have the foundational
[51:57] piece amen now he says this but once the
[52:01] brilliance is that what you would call
[52:02] these 43 sermons I hope so because
[52:04] they're not my thought they're God's
[52:05] thought but the brilliance of the seven
[52:08] church ages is given by divine
[52:11] revelation light upon light follows
[52:16] until the whole of the revelation opens
[52:19] wider before our wandering eyes and we
[52:22] and I hope this is how you feel we
[52:24] edified and purified by the Spirit by
[52:29] its Spirit are made ready for his
[52:31] glorious appearing even our Lord and
[52:33] Savior the one true God Jesus Christ do
[52:37] you like that my high
[52:40] I thought all right I've got to put that
[52:43] in there
[52:44] the people have to know these 43 sermons
[52:46] have not been in vain without this
[52:48] illumination you'll never be illuminated
[52:50] afterwards right you have to have that
[52:54] this makes ready this makes you ready
[52:57] for the rapture think about it as we
[52:59] looked at these think about the battles
[53:02] well let me go back here let me go back
[53:04] to that slide here that's number 15 let
[53:06] me go back to this one look at this if
[53:10] you don't understand the battles that
[53:12] you're facing so if you try to go right
[53:14] to the seals but yet you don't
[53:16] understand the deeds of Nicolaitans you
[53:18] don't understand the synagogue of satan'
[53:20] the false doctrine of balaam and nickel
[53:23] aid and doctrines and Jezebel the false
[53:25] spirit and living a name but you're dead
[53:27] if you don't understand these and have
[53:29] these revelations like what about
[53:31] Ephesus and having your first love if
[53:33] you lose your first love you're not even
[53:36] gonna care about the seven seals because
[53:38] you don't love you're not alone with
[53:40] Christ anymore you understand so see how
[53:43] it's so important to understand the
[53:45] seven churches it's so crucial right
[53:48] like you know sometimes you know people
[53:50] might say well well I know the white
[53:52] horse rider was the lying spear well how
[53:54] does that affect me it affects you in a
[53:55] great way because if you know if you are
[53:58] able to discern every lie Satan tells
[54:00] you then the white horse riders already
[54:02] wrote into your life you understand if
[54:05] you accept any lie from Satan the white
[54:08] horse rider has written into your life
[54:10] and he's conquering you does everyone
[54:12] understand by God's grace it's so
[54:14] crucial that's kind of hot in herre
[54:16] mouth God you and turn on the air it's
[54:18] kind of a Zen ebuddy else hot yeah I'm
[54:21] okay all right I got some hands there
[54:23] okay so I know that wasn't just me but I
[54:26] hope everybody understands that these
[54:28] are real battles right the white
[54:31] deception and then the killing of
[54:33] influence or killing of physical bodies
[54:34] that was Roman Catholic Church and the
[54:36] the kingdom building here with the
[54:38] scales kept getting money it's a money
[54:40] system and then spiritual death
[54:42] spiritual death it's so important what
[54:45] is the white horse mean what does the
[54:46] red horse mean to me it means a lot to
[54:48] you are you killing anybody's influence
[54:51] are you accepting any live from the
[54:53] enemy
[54:53] well you're allowed to do this and
[54:55] you're allowed to do that when the Bible
[54:56] says you shouldn't it's so important to
[54:59] understand these things we have to know
[55:01] how Satan works and to me that's not a
[55:04] minor thing to me like what the Prophet
[55:06] said that's a necessity it's a necessity
[55:08] that we understand the church ages it's
[55:11] an absolute necessity we need it by
[55:13] God's grace
[55:14] now here's what I said here's what I
[55:17] picked up remember the scripture but
[55:18] growing grace and knowledge of the Lord
[55:19] and Savior Jesus Christ if you have
[55:22] around the church age book you really
[55:24] need to do it it's a necessity you will
[55:28] grow so much in your walk with God as
[55:30] I've read through it I've know I've
[55:32] grown grown I've missed things I forgot
[55:34] about things there's been things I've
[55:36] read in there that made me cry by that
[55:38] that brought me closer to Christ that
[55:41] made me repent of this and that because
[55:43] it's brought me it's brought me more
[55:44] illumination praise God I'm going from
[55:48] light to light from glory to glory from
[55:51] faith to faith
[55:52] praise God absolutely and then remember
[55:55] we must be overcomers we must overcome
[55:57] he that overcometh inherits all things
[56:00] we have to overcome the Laodicean spirit
[56:02] and we inherit all the other things
[56:03] ruling nations right the Morningstar
[56:06] the Tree of Life if we in overcoming our
[56:09] age God will reward us with everything
[56:11] else so we must not take that lightly
[56:14] we can't take it lightly because we live
[56:16] in America life so easy you know all
[56:18] these things there's no real persecution
[56:20] we must stay on top of our spiritual
[56:22] discernment' amen
[56:24] we must not drop off we must not get it
[56:27] well I've heard enough of the word or I
[56:29] know enough about God you don't if you
[56:31] think that you don't know enough about
[56:32] God because he's the inexhaustible
[56:35] fountain of eternal life Amen because
[56:37] they as we said a few months ago or last
[56:39] month he's the unsearchable riches of
[56:41] Christ
[56:41] you can never search it out he could
[56:43] ever get down to the bottom of it we've
[56:45] got to get past of our complacency I'll
[56:48] say like that now here's what he said in
[56:51] 1960 a month before he preached this
[56:55] series in condemnation my representation
[56:57] he said it's a prophetic message and
[56:59] after that first I'll preach it then it
[57:00] goes on tape magnetic tape from that to
[57:03] records and then to be took off by
[57:05] shorthand and then typed in the book
[57:07] the book is gonna go I'm sorry going to
[57:09] be a commentary on the seven church ages
[57:10] and if I didn't think that it was
[57:13] essential and if I didn't think it was
[57:16] badly needed let me say like this church
[57:20] you badly need to read the church age
[57:22] book or at least listen to the sermons
[57:25] because they're very similar there's
[57:28] more in the church age book because they
[57:29] had five years to write or four years to
[57:30] write it but you it is absolutely
[57:33] essential that you listen to those
[57:35] sermons or read that book because
[57:37] there's probably things you missed you
[57:38] know as we've gone through it there's
[57:39] probably things I miss I plan to go back
[57:41] after my family reads the whole Bible by
[57:43] God's grace we're going to the church
[57:44] age book that's gonna be our nightly
[57:45] devotion they will read one scripture
[57:48] and then we'll read maybe a couple pages
[57:50] we haven't talked about it yet but
[57:51] almost through the Bible
[57:52] we're in Ezekiel right now we read
[57:53] through all the New Testament we started
[57:55] Genesis now or zekiel by God's grace uh
[57:57] I can't wait that's gonna be such a
[57:58] milestone for me because I wasn't raised
[58:01] like that and now by God's grace I can
[58:03] say we have raised our children in the
[58:05] fear of God they've heard the whole
[58:07] Bible by the time they're you know
[58:09] thirteen thirteen what a blessing that
[58:12] can be how many want their families like
[58:13] that how many want their children or
[58:15] grandchildren like that am i what
[58:17] greater blessing could we have than have
[58:18] the Word of God written upon their
[58:20] hearts if I didn't think it was
[58:24] essential if I didn't think it was badly
[58:26] needed I certainly wouldn't take the
[58:27] people's time of saying it if I don't
[58:30] think this was necessary I wouldn't take
[58:32] 43 sermons to preach it to you it's
[58:35] absolutely essential because it's
[58:38] prophecy right it's life its victory
[58:41] it's over coming under wisdom and
[58:42] understanding it's all these things that
[58:44] the Holy Ghost is trying to lead us and
[58:46] guide us into there understand that but
[58:50] I believe that it may be the last time
[58:51] we'll ever receive it from this church
[58:53] especially now that's interesting
[58:55] thought I'm not gonna go far that's
[58:57] interesting thought
[58:58] so now let's be real prayerfully about
[59:00] it real prayerfully now I went over this
[59:05] a few weeks ago sorry two weeks ago but
[59:08] remember I've drawn a lot of inspiration
[59:09] from this series one of them was church
[59:11] attendance and local ministry because
[59:12] Jesus said our works must be more at the
[59:15] end than they are at the beginning a lot
[59:17] of people were going to retire
[59:18] spiritually well I'm I'm
[59:20] now I don't have to serve God no that's
[59:22] when you got to be more dedicated to God
[59:23] you're also gonna be a Solomon we don't
[59:26] want to be a Solomon who when he got old
[59:28] he back slid and had many wives now for
[59:30] us you can remain married but you could
[59:33] have many idols in your life right you
[59:35] could have many idols your phone could
[59:37] be an idol right money could be an idol
[59:38] we could just name all the idols pride
[59:40] arrogance you know fear you can have
[59:42] many idols and mean I don't worship err
[59:46] devote more of ourselves to Christ as we
[59:49] get older it's gonna cost you but that's
[59:51] what you're supposed to be a living
[59:52] sacrifice
[59:53] that's your reasonable service if your
[59:56] sacrifice died for you well shouldn't
[59:58] you die for him that's just reasonable
[59:59] that's your reasonable service
[1:00:01] play the playin tapes only movement you
[1:00:04] know this this really bless my heart
[1:00:07] they found them to be liars so in other
[1:00:09] words anybody that changes anything
[1:00:11] Apostle Paul wrote they're a liar and
[1:00:14] that was a great revelation to me I read
[1:00:17] it I read that when I really needed it
[1:00:19] because I D males coming my way
[1:00:21] I had face-to-face meetings with people
[1:00:22] that believe this and by God's grace I
[1:00:24] was able to stand on the truth of God
[1:00:26] but see that would that meant a lot to
[1:00:29] me God was bringing inspiration to me
[1:00:31] and also this one I think the church
[1:00:34] would appreciate
[1:00:35] God hates when Satan convinces the lady
[1:00:38] they have no ministry that's what the
[1:00:41] deeds of the Nicolaitans are nikkolon to
[1:00:43] means conquering the laity so see Church
[1:00:48] you've got a you and I know I'm the
[1:00:50] pastor so you're the lady right so so
[1:00:52] you've got to let yourself not be
[1:00:54] conquered I've got to make sure I
[1:00:56] encourage you to have a ministry I've
[1:00:59] got to make room for your ministry right
[1:01:02] but Jesus hates when the ladies
[1:01:05] conquered well you're not holy or you
[1:01:07] can't get in the spirit we ought to get
[1:01:09] in the spirit
[1:01:10] we ought to get so happy about Jesus we
[1:01:13] shout or scream or cry or something or
[1:01:15] pray for somebody or do something we
[1:01:18] ought to be so in the spirit as Satan
[1:01:20] doesn't conquer you don't let the
[1:01:22] preacher be the only one who's trying to
[1:01:23] get in the spirit we all got to get in
[1:01:25] the spirit that's what we need we've all
[1:01:29] got to come here pray and I love when
[1:01:31] people come to pray early that's
[1:01:33] the key right there that's the key
[1:01:35] prayer is the key we've got to pray down
[1:01:37] the blessings of God see these
[1:01:40] inspirations these are these are things
[1:01:42] that we need to grow into by God's grace
[1:01:44] and then receiving the hand of man I
[1:01:46] love this thought brother Brennan says
[1:01:50] when we received the message of the hour
[1:01:51] and all these mysteries that's hidden
[1:01:53] manna because we're kings and priests
[1:01:56] and it was the priest who going the
[1:01:57] holiest of Holies and partake of that
[1:02:00] original manna and we get to partake of
[1:02:03] the original apostles doctor in a Amen
[1:02:06] and then brother Ram said in heaven
[1:02:08] we'll ask Jesus the questions that no
[1:02:10] one ever knew why did what happen behind
[1:02:12] the scenes here or why did this happen
[1:02:14] or and then as he gives us answers but
[1:02:16] the RAM said that's our hidden manna in
[1:02:18] heaven that's what he said and I love
[1:02:23] this the new name in the white stone the
[1:02:26] Prophet said is the revelation that God
[1:02:28] gave you of your name as a Christian he
[1:02:31] said it's a revelation in you and the
[1:02:33] Bible said you can't tell anybody your
[1:02:35] name and brother Branham said that means
[1:02:37] you can't you can't really share with
[1:02:39] anybody the revelation that's in your
[1:02:40] heart
[1:02:41] it's it's so personal you can't give
[1:02:44] somebody the oil right the wise can't
[1:02:46] give the foolish the oil you've just got
[1:02:48] enough for yourself amen your name is in
[1:02:53] a white stone your name I'm a Christian
[1:02:55] it's hidden in a white stone and you
[1:02:57] can't give it to anybody else
[1:02:58] just like Jacob Jacob couldn't make
[1:03:00] anybody walk like him that was a hidden
[1:03:02] revelation to him praise God he wrestled
[1:03:05] God he wrestled the angel he overcame
[1:03:07] just like you overcame you can't tell
[1:03:09] anybody else you can't make anybody else
[1:03:11] do it all you can do is testify what God
[1:03:14] did for you you've got a revelation
[1:03:16] you've got a new name in a white stone
[1:03:18] amen
[1:03:19] glory he said that's why Abram had to be
[1:03:22] changed to Abraham Sarah - Sarah saw to
[1:03:26] Paul Simon to Peter they all had to get
[1:03:29] this revelation that was hidden in the
[1:03:31] white stone amen I'm glad I got I used
[1:03:34] to be Jesse the whatever the worldly guy
[1:03:36] the sports guy
[1:03:37] now I'm jet brother Jesse the preacher
[1:03:39] Amen or the godly father of the godly
[1:03:42] husband or the godly schoolteacher I
[1:03:44] have a different name and I liked it
[1:03:47] people about it but they just can't get
[1:03:48] it because it's just for me only my
[1:03:52] revelation of who I am in Christ Jesus
[1:03:54] are you with me
[1:03:56] see these are all revelations that come
[1:03:58] out are these are these sermons that are
[1:04:00] to us they're making us ready for the
[1:04:03] rapture
[1:04:04] they're brilliant amen hallelujah
[1:04:07] they're they're magnificent dins and
[1:04:10] these are some of them that these are
[1:04:12] the first ones I thought of I have to go
[1:04:13] back and listen to him you know to get
[1:04:15] all of them and this is the last one I
[1:04:16] had Jesus told the submerging church age
[1:04:20] I know your sufferings and this really
[1:04:23] encouraged me because brother BAM said
[1:04:24] Jesus knows our sufferings and the way
[1:04:27] we prove our love to God is by just
[1:04:29] carrying ourselves with joy in the midst
[1:04:32] of our trials that's how you can prove
[1:04:35] that you love God God I believe you I'll
[1:04:37] walk through this trial as hard as it
[1:04:39] may be I'll still love you because I
[1:04:41] know you died for me I know I'll never
[1:04:44] suffer like you did you suffered more
[1:04:46] than any other man could ever suffer for
[1:04:48] me and because of that I'll trust you
[1:04:50] that you allowed this to happen I love
[1:04:52] you and I'll have joy I'll go to church
[1:04:54] and I'll be happy instead of being sad
[1:04:56] amen I'll get on my knees and I'll give
[1:04:58] you praise instead of feeling sorry for
[1:05:00] myself all God help us be Christians
[1:05:02] like that to know that Jesus knows what
[1:05:05] we're going through he's allowed it and
[1:05:07] we can trust him now one more and then
[1:05:10] we'll move on to the back to the key of
[1:05:11] David here I haven't actually got to it
[1:05:13] but I wanted to lay this foundation now
[1:05:16] remember the prophet of God I'm gonna
[1:05:17] skip all this but brother Branham said
[1:05:19] he would preach the sermons to get
[1:05:20] inspiration we went over a few weeks ago
[1:05:22] we come here to be inspired amen we
[1:05:24] should be inspired when we leave here
[1:05:26] it's just one diff not many things at
[1:05:27] least one thing you ought to say God
[1:05:29] give me one thing that will inspire me
[1:05:31] to live a better Christian life tomorrow
[1:05:33] amen you ought to by God's grace
[1:05:37] now here's what he says he says and I
[1:05:41] believe it ought to make a striking
[1:05:42] little commentary on the church age have
[1:05:44] you ever been struck by anything good
[1:05:46] preached
[1:05:46] these last forty three sermons I hope
[1:05:48] you've been struck by something by God's
[1:05:50] grace but he said it ought to be a
[1:05:51] striking little commentary on the book
[1:05:54] of Revelation the church ageist Amen is
[1:05:57] that is that okay by God's grace to be
[1:05:59] understanding okay
[1:06:01] remember it's absolutely necessary it's
[1:06:05] absolutely necessary to sit here this
[1:06:07] preaching and not just hear it but
[1:06:08] receive it receive it that's why I want
[1:06:11] to preach on Sunday so I give you I want
[1:06:13] to preach on that thought
[1:06:14] I want to tile it let that quote from
[1:06:16] the church age book I don't have it on
[1:06:18] my mind right now but maybe I can pull
[1:06:21] it up but I want to title it you can
[1:06:24] never overemphasize the power of
[1:06:27] Revelation something along those lines
[1:06:29] you can not over I can never
[1:06:31] overemphasize the importance of
[1:06:33] Revelation think about it and I guess
[1:06:37] I'll just get into the sermon little bit
[1:06:38] if you read the Old Testament what do
[1:06:41] they always start with the word of the
[1:06:43] Lord came to Jonah the word Lord came to
[1:06:46] Micah the word Lord came to Habakkuk so
[1:06:52] what was what was all these books
[1:06:54] written about they're written about
[1:06:55] through the revelation of the Holy
[1:06:57] Spirit we wouldn't have a Bible unless
[1:07:00] the Holy Spirit gave us revelation gave
[1:07:03] some man revelation he wrote it down and
[1:07:05] gave us the Bible you can never
[1:07:07] overemphasize how important is for you
[1:07:09] and I to receive a revelation and I just
[1:07:11] went through those revelations that lead
[1:07:13] to me these are revelations these were
[1:07:16] revelations I just said for I said 5
[1:07:18] that I could quickly pull off a few
[1:07:19] weeks ago and and think about and it's
[1:07:23] because of them it's because of
[1:07:24] Revelation that I overcome the gates of
[1:07:26] Hell pori Amen that's right
[1:07:29] jesus said with the revelation of me as
[1:07:32] Messiah you the gates of Hell cannot
[1:07:34] prevail against you how can Satan defeat
[1:07:36] me if I've got the revelation that Jesus
[1:07:38] Christ is inside of me amen
[1:07:40] how can I be I can't meet and that's why
[1:07:43] I'm standing today glory that's why
[1:07:46] you're standing today if you got the
[1:07:48] revelation that Jesus Christ is the son
[1:07:50] of God he's alive and well today then
[1:07:53] the gates of hell don't prevail against
[1:07:54] you either it's exactly right Church
[1:07:57] exactly right that's how I can stand as
[1:07:59] I said before I know how I used to live
[1:08:01] I know all my habits I used to have all
[1:08:03] my addictions and I know how I'm living
[1:08:04] now Satan knows how I live right now
[1:08:06] glory those demons know how I live right
[1:08:09] now I'm not a hypocrite if I make a
[1:08:12] mistake I say I'm sorry I'm not a dick
[1:08:15] all these things like all that you know
[1:08:16] other people might be I'm living the
[1:08:18] life I know where I stand I'm serving
[1:08:20] Christ with all my god amen I know the
[1:08:22] gates of Hell don't prevail against me
[1:08:23] I know Christ prevails over the gates of
[1:08:25] Hell amen we ought to know that we ought
[1:08:28] to know where say we got to know these
[1:08:30] things by God's grace it's exactly right
[1:08:34] now let's look at the key of David sorry
[1:08:36] I just want to put that in there amen
[1:08:38] hallelujah thank you Jesus a joy it's
[1:08:42] it's a joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:08:46] for glory full of glory it is joy on
[1:08:53] speakable and full of glory and the half
[1:08:58] has never yet been told I found the
[1:09:06] pleasure
[1:09:06] I once craved it is joy and peace within
[1:09:10] that's why I'm offering to Jacinda and
[1:09:12] Gemara tonight
[1:09:13] there's nothing ever get peace and joy
[1:09:15] to you accept Jesus Christ as your
[1:09:17] Savior
[1:09:17] that's when joy and peace comes in when
[1:09:21] I first received not wept like a baby
[1:09:22] and I've been happy ever since I've had
[1:09:24] my trials God my wife knows I've had
[1:09:27] trials but I'm happy in my soul amen now
[1:09:30] let's get the key of David here and I
[1:09:32] wanted like I said I want to end with a
[1:09:33] salvation visual I got some visuals
[1:09:36] because I've been showing the children
[1:09:37] of school just a visual way to salvation
[1:09:41] it's been really really wonderful okay
[1:09:45] so the key of David now if you got your
[1:09:46] Bibles we'll just read a few scriptures
[1:09:49] here the key of David revelation three
[1:09:53] seven let's go there by the grace of
[1:09:58] Lord
[1:10:09] revelation 3 7 now read this for our
[1:10:18] text here and I'm just looking at one
[1:10:24] scripture real quick here I was looking
[1:10:31] up the word veil now what the Bible say
[1:10:34] darlin I'm gonna ask you a quick
[1:10:36] question here the Bible didn't say Sara
[1:10:39] I'm sorry uh Rebekah put a veil over her
[1:10:42] face did she cover her face when she saw
[1:10:43] Isaac and when she first met him in the
[1:10:46] field
[1:10:47] does anybody remember I was looking for
[1:10:50] a scripture it's not veil looked up veil
[1:10:52] unless it's spelled differently but I
[1:10:54] was looking so I want to show this how
[1:10:56] the veil was was connected to weddings
[1:10:59] and I didn't have time to look that up
[1:11:00] here parmie yeah I did yeah sorry
[1:11:11] ok well I know it's Genesis 4 24 so I'll
[1:11:14] just I'll keep my Bible there ok the key
[1:11:16] of David sorry I thought it was the word
[1:11:18] veil he that hath the key of David this
[1:11:22] beautiful phrase follows and comes out
[1:11:24] of the preceding verse he that is true
[1:11:26] Christ is the perfect realization and
[1:11:29] he's contrasted that means he's
[1:11:31] different than the partial realization
[1:11:34] this is what I showed on Sunday I
[1:11:35] thought it'd be good for jamai Rijn and
[1:11:37] Justin if they never seen this before in
[1:11:39] the Old Testament they had a partial
[1:11:40] reality of God so in other words God
[1:11:42] wasn't really he wasn't as real to them
[1:11:45] as he is today in the New Testament so
[1:11:47] in the Old Testament they would they had
[1:11:48] natural bread they read and they get
[1:11:50] they sacrificed bread to God or at least
[1:11:53] said in the temple but Jesus in the New
[1:11:55] Testament is true bread and Jesus said
[1:11:58] if you eat of me you'll never be hungry
[1:12:00] again in other words you wanted to go
[1:12:01] out in the world and say oh I want to do
[1:12:03] some things in the world you'll be
[1:12:04] satisfied with the Word of God so that
[1:12:08] was partial Old Testament was partial
[1:12:10] New Testament Jesus Christ is the true
[1:12:12] bread you'll never be hungry again if
[1:12:14] you partake of Christ in the Old
[1:12:16] Testament they had wine they sacrificed
[1:12:18] wine I'm sorry
[1:12:20] - vine sorry they had a vine that a
[1:12:23] partial vine or a partial understanding
[1:12:25] of God as a vine but jesus said I am the
[1:12:28] true vine in other words he said you're
[1:12:30] truly connected to heaven he said I'm
[1:12:33] the vine you're the branches so we are
[1:12:35] truly connected to Jesus Christ through
[1:12:37] the Holy Spirit he's the true vine we
[1:12:39] have a true connection and if we're
[1:12:41] truly connected we produce true fruits
[1:12:42] which are love joy peace long-suffering
[1:12:45] gentleness kindness godliness in the old
[1:12:49] testament sin could only be covered over
[1:12:51] it could just be covered over but in the
[1:12:53] New Testament it's totally done away
[1:12:54] with and Jesus forgets our sin it's so
[1:12:58] it's just not even there anymore that's
[1:13:00] the New Testament in the Old Testament
[1:13:01] they would sacrifice and go to church
[1:13:04] and they would leave and they still have
[1:13:05] the same desires I still want to cuss I
[1:13:07] still want to fornicate I still want to
[1:13:09] steal I still want to be rich all but in
[1:13:11] the New Testament he takes that desire
[1:13:13] completely away my flesh wants to smoke
[1:13:17] my flesh wants to drink but this guy
[1:13:20] never wants to do it the inside of me
[1:13:23] once that never wants to do it the
[1:13:25] outside is still gets tempted but this
[1:13:27] guy never lets it happen because he's in
[1:13:28] control now Christ is living in me now
[1:13:31] and he's in control of me now so he
[1:13:34] don't let it happen because he don't
[1:13:35] desire those things anymore yes Moses
[1:13:39] was a lawgiver in the Old Testament but
[1:13:42] Jesus gave us the true law he gave us
[1:13:44] the New Testament the new word the new
[1:13:46] promise David was a prophet in Old
[1:13:49] Testament as we'll get to he was a
[1:13:51] prophet King but Jesus is a true prophet
[1:13:54] and he's king of kings and Lord of lords
[1:13:56] they had a they had synagogues where
[1:14:01] they felt God was that but many times
[1:14:03] God wasn't there but in the New
[1:14:05] Testament this is the church really is
[1:14:08] in a building the church is the
[1:14:09] believers by the Holy Ghost so when God
[1:14:13] dwells in you you're part of the church
[1:14:15] we say like tonight well we're going to
[1:14:17] go to church but really wherever we
[1:14:19] gathered if we would want to brother
[1:14:20] amens apartment then we would had a
[1:14:22] church there because that's the real
[1:14:23] church right it's not just a building
[1:14:26] the buildings of the church it's those
[1:14:27] who are filled with Christ they're the
[1:14:30] church and not only the church they're
[1:14:32] called the body of Christ they are
[1:14:33] Christ's body on this earth okay so that
[1:14:37] gives you an idea the key of David comes
[1:14:38] from that idea the partial reality
[1:14:41] versus the perfect reality now David was
[1:14:44] a man for God's own heart was king of
[1:14:46] Israel but Jesus is the greater David
[1:14:48] king of kings and Lord of lords god
[1:14:51] Barry God
[1:14:52] now David was born of the tribe of Judah
[1:14:54] out of whom no priest came yet he ate of
[1:14:57] the shewbread reserved for priests he
[1:14:59] was the great warrior overcoming the
[1:15:00] enemy establishing the people as king he
[1:15:03] sat on the throne he was a prophet he
[1:15:05] was a wonderful type of Christ now
[1:15:09] here's where we get the scripture the
[1:15:10] key of David I don't know if you ever
[1:15:12] seen this before but it's Isaiah 22 22
[1:15:15] so you don't return it like I said I'm
[1:15:17] trying to get somewhere I'm just gonna
[1:15:18] show slides if I want you look it up
[1:15:20] usually I put a little note on there to
[1:15:22] read this and the key of the house of
[1:15:25] David will I lay upon his shoulder now
[1:15:27] this was written by Isaiah who lived
[1:15:29] after David right so this wasn't
[1:15:32] speaking of David himself
[1:15:34] it wasn't speaking of a physical key it
[1:15:36] was the spiritual key of the key of the
[1:15:40] house of David when I lay on his
[1:15:42] shoulder so he shall open and none shall
[1:15:45] shut and he shall shut and none shall
[1:15:47] open so look at the Prophet says the
[1:15:53] Spirit the Holy Spirit uses this Old
[1:15:55] Testament reference concerning the Lord
[1:15:58] Jesus Christ and his ministry in the
[1:16:00] church this is about the church Isaiah
[1:16:03] is writing about the New Testament
[1:16:04] church what the key of David signified
[1:16:07] at that time is mere shadow which is I
[1:16:11] want to emphasize that is now fulfilled
[1:16:14] do you know that the scripture is now
[1:16:16] fulfilled amen it's now fulfilled in
[1:16:20] Jesus standing in the midst of the lamp
[1:16:23] stands in Revelation chapters one two
[1:16:25] and three it has to do with our Lord
[1:16:29] after his resurrection and not his
[1:16:32] earthly pilgrimage so I just put a
[1:16:33] little picture up here the key of David
[1:16:37] is fulfilled as Jesus stands in the
[1:16:39] midst of the lamp stands can never
[1:16:41] understand that if you've been around
[1:16:43] you understand it each each branch
[1:16:46] represented the church
[1:16:47] with its messenger then Christ is
[1:16:51] standing in the midst of the seven
[1:16:52] Church ages so the key of David with the
[1:16:56] government on his shoulder is fulfilled
[1:16:58] after Jesus ascended and he's in heaven
[1:17:01] that's when the key of David is
[1:17:03] fulfilled can the church say Amen so
[1:17:05] they're a sign oh okay this is where the
[1:17:07] key of David's will fill right here now
[1:17:10] don't get me wrong there is a future key
[1:17:12] of David for the millennium I know that
[1:17:13] we'll get to that in a minute but it's
[1:17:16] also fulfilled right now as well it's a
[1:17:19] field right now and here's why what does
[1:17:22] the key signify let me get there here
[1:17:31] okay all right there we go yeah Vail was
[1:17:39] spelled V ail okay just so you know
[1:17:41] forgive me I was trying ve il anyways
[1:17:44] what does this key signify the answer
[1:17:47] lies in the position of the key it is
[1:17:50] not in his hand
[1:17:51] it is not worn around his neck it is not
[1:17:53] placed in the hands of other men
[1:17:55] or the verse could not be saying that he
[1:17:59] alone has the use of that key for he
[1:18:02] alone opens and shuts and no man has the
[1:18:04] right but Jesus himself isn't that right
[1:18:07] but where is the key it's on his
[1:18:09] shoulder but what does shoulder have to
[1:18:14] do with it so we know it's not in his
[1:18:15] hand it's not his pocket the key is on
[1:18:18] his shoulder
[1:18:19] okay read Isaiah 9:6 and the government
[1:18:23] shall be upon his shoulder but what does
[1:18:27] this mean the answer is this the phrase
[1:18:29] government upon his shoulder comes from
[1:18:31] the wedding ceremony of the east so
[1:18:36] government upon his shoulder meaning
[1:18:38] comes from a wedding ceremony when the
[1:18:41] bride has been committed to the groom
[1:18:42] she takes off her veil and places it
[1:18:46] over the groom's shoulders signifying
[1:18:49] that not only is she under his Dominion
[1:18:52] that she has transferred her rights to
[1:18:55] him that he is the head but also that he
[1:19:00] bears the responsibility
[1:19:01] and they care and that he and he alone
[1:19:04] no one else no other man no other power
[1:19:06] has any right and responsibility and
[1:19:09] that beloved is the key of David I knew
[1:19:13] ya so if you got your Bibles going to
[1:19:15] Genesis 24 verse 65 and this is
[1:19:18] scriptural because here Rebecca is
[1:19:20] getting married and she sees her
[1:19:22] bridegroom so what does she do she
[1:19:23] covers her face with a veil hallelujah
[1:19:29] Jer I'm sorry not you Genesis 24 65
[1:19:33] forgive me no all right who'd like to
[1:19:40] read that for me 24 65
[1:19:41] all right Lydia thanks Lydia okay so
[1:19:55] Rebecca is just about ready to marry
[1:19:57] Isaac so she knows that's her husband
[1:20:00] future husband so she says oh give me
[1:20:02] that veil I got to put the veil on right
[1:20:05] so everybody knows that's what that's
[1:20:07] why Christian women today ought to wear
[1:20:10] a veil down the aisle right because
[1:20:12] they're coming to the state I have no
[1:20:14] head you're my head right that's right
[1:20:17] that woman's supposed to say hey I have
[1:20:19] no leadership the God's gonna lead me
[1:20:21] through you don't like that so much
[1:20:25] worldly women don't like that they don't
[1:20:27] want to wear a veil but that's what it
[1:20:29] means
[1:20:30] it means I have no head anymore I'm
[1:20:32] coming to my head and guess who Explorer
[1:20:34] escorts are down daddy daddy was her
[1:20:36] head before right but now daddy's
[1:20:38] bringing her to her new head her husband
[1:20:40] praise the Lord and this is what Rebecca
[1:20:43] did Rebecca was coming to her bridegroom
[1:20:46] so she covers her head with the veil I
[1:20:48] said Isaac I I've no more head you're my
[1:20:52] leader I'm trusting God to lead you and
[1:20:54] I'm gonna follow you all the days of
[1:20:56] your life now look at verse 66 and the
[1:21:00] servant told Isaac all the things that
[1:21:02] he'd done and Isaac brought her into his
[1:21:06] mother Sarah's tent and took Rebecca and
[1:21:08] she became his wife and he loved her and
[1:21:10] Isaac was comfort after his mother's
[1:21:12] death so this scripture doesn't give us
[1:21:14] the
[1:21:15] the actual picture of Vail on the
[1:21:16] shoulder I couldn't find any when I
[1:21:18] looked but this is the closest one we
[1:21:20] have she has to put a veil on goes into
[1:21:23] the tent and we know they have relations
[1:21:25] they they consummate the wedding so at
[1:21:27] some point he would had to take off the
[1:21:28] veil right and then from this reference
[1:21:32] the Prophet and leave ale knew that
[1:21:35] Jewish Jewish people had to take off the
[1:21:37] woman I'd take off the veil and set out
[1:21:39] on her shoulder
[1:21:39] when Simon got married that's what he
[1:21:41] did with sister Beth was anybody there
[1:21:43] here I think I wasn't the only one that
[1:21:46] was there my wife and I so Simon took
[1:21:48] off best veil and put it on Simon's
[1:21:52] shoulders Simon walked down the aisle
[1:21:54] with that veil on his shoulder I thought
[1:21:56] glory that's the key of David amen
[1:21:59] because the government the
[1:22:00] responsibility is on his shoulders and
[1:22:04] that is Christ and the church so Jesus
[1:22:07] is telling the church listen I'm taking
[1:22:09] responsibility for you I'm putting my
[1:22:12] responsibility for you it's all my
[1:22:13] shoulders I'm gonna take care of it you
[1:22:15] have nothing to fear you're my wife
[1:22:18] you haven't denied my name you're my
[1:22:21] wife and I'm gonna take full
[1:22:23] responsibility for your life it's
[1:22:26] exactly right no one has any other power
[1:22:28] no man has any right to tell you what to
[1:22:30] do only I'm gonna tell you what to do
[1:22:32] now we got to be make sure we have to
[1:22:34] make sure we only listen to Christ right
[1:22:37] have to make sure we silence any voice
[1:22:39] that goes against the Word of God and we
[1:22:41] only obey the Word of God that proves
[1:22:43] were the real Bride of Christ because he
[1:22:45] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[1:22:46] Spirit says to the churches God being
[1:22:49] sovereign he foreknew by divine decree
[1:22:51] exactly who would be in his bride he
[1:22:54] chose her she did not choose him he
[1:22:59] called her she did not come on her own
[1:23:01] he died for her he washed her in his own
[1:23:04] blood he paid the price for her she
[1:23:06] belongs to him and to him alone don't
[1:23:08] you love that I'm I belong to Jesus I am
[1:23:11] all Jesus's I don't belong nothin to
[1:23:13] this world amen glory
[1:23:16] she is wholly committed I like that
[1:23:19] wholly committed to him and he accepts
[1:23:22] the obligation
[1:23:24] he is her head for Christ as the head of
[1:23:26] his church as Sara called Abraham rule
[1:23:29] or even so the bride is happy that he is
[1:23:33] her Lord I hope my wife is happy I'm her
[1:23:37] husband tonight I believe she is but
[1:23:40] that's a true marriage right all the
[1:23:42] wives here are happy that God gave you
[1:23:44] the right husband you ought to be right
[1:23:48] because that's what Christ is the church
[1:23:50] we're so happy
[1:23:51] Jesus is our husband I'm glad the devil
[1:23:53] ain't my husband I'm glad Christ as my
[1:23:56] husband amen
[1:23:57] because he takes full responsibility he
[1:23:59] chose me anyway and I just walk in his
[1:24:02] past amen as Sarah called Abraham Lord
[1:24:05] even she's happy let's read that let's
[1:24:07] go to first Peter 3 I want to read that
[1:24:09] once I put it in yellow Jesus speaks and
[1:24:14] the bride obeys for that is her delight
[1:24:17] now see if and if I'm a true preacher
[1:24:20] and I preached Jesus's words you ought
[1:24:22] to be happy leaving Church many times
[1:24:24] because it's not what I'm telling you
[1:24:26] it's what Christ told you already right
[1:24:29] so you should delight in the preaching
[1:24:30] of the word if the word says this well
[1:24:32] I'm happy to do that I'm happy to obey
[1:24:35] my husband I'm happy to take orders from
[1:24:37] the God of heaven because I trust the
[1:24:38] God of heaven
[1:24:39] 1st Peter 3:1 we would like to read
[1:24:42] verses 1 and 2 for me bruh Adam thank
[1:24:46] you sir amen we'll stop right there now
[1:25:07] this scripture says right here that if a
[1:25:09] man is wrong in a woman's right in a
[1:25:12] marriage and the woman is not supposed
[1:25:15] to use the word she's supposed to use
[1:25:17] the power of the Holy Ghost inside of
[1:25:18] her she's not supposed to preach at the
[1:25:21] man she's supposed to live the life in
[1:25:23] front of the man so if the man's making
[1:25:26] bad financial decisions she doesn't take
[1:25:28] her Bible and say look what the Bible
[1:25:29] says you know you're supposed to there
[1:25:34] she's supposed to just pray for him and
[1:25:36] and when that topic comes
[1:25:38] maybe she just be silent sometimes
[1:25:40] silence is more powerful than anything
[1:25:41] you could say just being the humble just
[1:25:45] bow on your head and maybe praying or
[1:25:46] just looking at the person you know look
[1:25:48] at them in the eyes be what they're you
[1:25:51] know with the look on your face she's
[1:25:55] not to preach the word but let me let me
[1:26:00] show you the balance so remember we
[1:26:01] preach it a few well we preach - this
[1:26:02] summer brother branham's wife said
[1:26:04] aren't you ashamed of yourself
[1:26:06] to say that God hasn't called you to the
[1:26:09] ministry she didn't preach one scripture
[1:26:12] does ever understand that cuz I don't
[1:26:14] want the wives to go home and rebuke
[1:26:15] their husbands tonight unless they need
[1:26:17] it so you understand what I'm saying
[1:26:18] she didn't take the scripture she just
[1:26:21] said aren't you ashamed to say that God
[1:26:23] hasn't called you to be a preacher and
[1:26:25] brother BAM said I was glad she rebuked
[1:26:27] me and I let me say like this there were
[1:26:29] some in time many times I made a mistake
[1:26:31] and I'm glad my wife asked me about it
[1:26:33] I'm just being honest my wife's never
[1:26:37] preached to me so I'm very thankful for
[1:26:38] that but she has asked me about that
[1:26:40] well is that exactly right or can we
[1:26:43] talk about this or what do you think
[1:26:44] about this and I'm very grateful for
[1:26:47] that very grateful because I'm not
[1:26:48] perfect so Adam read that it's very
[1:26:52] important for a woman not to preach it
[1:26:53] the husband but just to live a godly
[1:26:56] life and just to let the life of Christ
[1:26:59] another in other words let me say like
[1:27:00] this if a man's wrong he's got a evil
[1:27:02] spirit on him you can ever say amen to
[1:27:04] that
[1:27:04] if he's made mistakes then he's got an
[1:27:07] evil spirit on him he hasn't repented of
[1:27:08] it and the wife doesn't want to get an
[1:27:11] evil spirit on her so she's got to keep
[1:27:14] the right spirit on her and not become a
[1:27:15] preacher you understand that that's what
[1:27:20] we have to remember if someone's making
[1:27:21] a wrong decision well if the man he's
[1:27:23] got a wrong spirit on him maybe it's
[1:27:25] lust maybe it's greed like we talked
[1:27:27] about maybe it's selfishness
[1:27:28] maybe it's pride but she can't let a
[1:27:31] wrong spirit get on her she's got to
[1:27:33] keep the right spirit on her and that
[1:27:36] takes that takes a lot of Holy Ghost it
[1:27:38] takes a lot of diligence but brother
[1:27:42] Graham said my wife is my correction did
[1:27:44] you know he said that my wife is my
[1:27:46] correction
[1:27:47] I love that I just love how baron was so
[1:27:49] honest with us now stop right there now
[1:27:53] verse three I'll read that now who's
[1:27:54] this is helping our sisters well with
[1:27:56] what to wear watch this verse three
[1:27:57] whose adorning let it not be that
[1:27:59] outward adorning of plaiting the hair
[1:28:01] now I looked at up that don't mean that
[1:28:05] don't mean any braid that means an
[1:28:06] expensive hairdo braid now hairdo is not
[1:28:09] the word but it means an expensive braid
[1:28:12] in other words in other words if one of
[1:28:16] these sisters went to the most expensive
[1:28:17] salon in New York and said give me that
[1:28:20] brain just like Beyonce I can but a
[1:28:33] woman who's poor but loves God and
[1:28:35] braids her hair is that demonic
[1:28:37] absolutely not
[1:28:39] she's just braiding her hair so if you
[1:28:42] look it up that's what the history is
[1:28:43] look at the context of this this is
[1:28:45] dealing with money and wasting your
[1:28:47] money everybody's got to wear clothes
[1:28:49] it's not a sin to wear jewelry Jesus
[1:28:52] told the story the prodigal son he said
[1:28:54] put a ring on that man why would Jesus
[1:28:55] tell him to put a ring on if wearing a
[1:28:57] ring was sinful a lot of churches have
[1:28:59] church twists because of jewelry well
[1:29:02] you should wear jewelry but jesus said
[1:29:04] put a ring on his finger
[1:29:05] so obviously jury's not wrong not all
[1:29:08] jury's wrong no some is if I bought a 20
[1:29:11] to $20,000 ring yes that's wrong I want
[1:29:16] to put that to the kingdom of God what
[1:29:17] this this was $99 at Walmart when I
[1:29:19] think I've been 59 actually now I think
[1:29:23] about it back in 19 or 2003 when I
[1:29:25] bought it it's not about the money it's
[1:29:28] about the commitment behind the jewelry
[1:29:31] for the RAM said if you want to wear a
[1:29:33] necklace for your husband do that it's
[1:29:35] about the commitment behind that
[1:29:37] necklace I'm fully committed
[1:29:40] I fully love my husband I'm committed to
[1:29:42] my husband and there's nothing wrong
[1:29:44] with a woman want to look pretty
[1:29:45] she's made to be pretty she's way
[1:29:48] prettier than a man if the man's pretty
[1:29:50] something's wrong with that man it's
[1:29:54] true it's true he all pretties himself
[1:29:58] up
[1:30:00] paints his face or whatever you know
[1:30:02] it's wrong it's the wrong spirit he's
[1:30:06] supposed to be clean I've got try to
[1:30:07] come to church clean you know if I don't
[1:30:10] comb my hair and put gel in my hair it
[1:30:12] just straight stick straight up and it
[1:30:13] looks awful that's why I put gel my hair
[1:30:15] I'm not trying to be pretty
[1:30:17] it just looks ugly if I don't and I
[1:30:19] can't shave it because my wife don't
[1:30:21] want my hair shaved so you understand
[1:30:23] what I'm saying like I I don't do this
[1:30:25] because I'm trying to be pretty I'm just
[1:30:26] trying to look clean
[1:30:27] you understand I'm just trying to please
[1:30:30] my wife you know she wants me to look
[1:30:31] nice to her I think I look pretty good
[1:30:33] with the shaved head but my wife doesn't
[1:30:35] think so you understand like I'm trying
[1:30:37] to here trying to get you understand
[1:30:39] braiding the hair is not demonic but
[1:30:42] spending twenty thousand on it is a very
[1:30:44] prideful act and it's selfish how many
[1:30:48] poor people could you feed with twenty
[1:30:49] thousand dollars you understand how many
[1:30:53] preachers could you send to Thailand or
[1:30:55] Japan with twenty thousand dollars
[1:30:57] people that are hungry for the gospel
[1:30:59] and you spending on a necklace shame on
[1:31:02] that that's just wrong never understand
[1:31:05] he if you look it up it's not just
[1:31:07] braiding hair it's expensive braids like
[1:31:10] we say celebrities let let the woman's
[1:31:13] door outward adorning of plaiting the
[1:31:16] hair and a wearing of gold seeing a
[1:31:18] putting on apparel don't worry so much
[1:31:20] about gold and your fancy clothes but
[1:31:24] what does God interested look at verse
[1:31:25] for God is interesting this in the hit
[1:31:28] but I'm sorry but let it be the hidden
[1:31:29] man of the heart
[1:31:32] God wants gold in your soul
[1:31:36] God wants Christianity in your heart
[1:31:39] that's what's beautiful to God that's
[1:31:41] the fancy hairdo not the fancy jewelry
[1:31:45] think I don't care about that I don't
[1:31:48] want you with the nicest clothes it
[1:31:49] don't matter what the clothes are yeah
[1:31:50] yeah I'm have modest clothes but God
[1:31:53] wants somebody who's really genuine and
[1:31:55] beautiful on the inside
[1:31:56] amen that's why our women don't have to
[1:31:58] like I said paint their faces and wear
[1:32:01] makeup
[1:32:01] that's why our women don't have to spend
[1:32:02] all this money on different things and
[1:32:04] plastic surgeries everything like that
[1:32:06] God's not interested in the outward
[1:32:07] God's interested on the inward what's
[1:32:11] your heart like
[1:32:12] are you really loving your husband I
[1:32:14] really loving your children are you
[1:32:15] really loving your neighbor or do you
[1:32:18] got evil sin in your heart God when
[1:32:20] somebody was beautiful in the heart
[1:32:22] hallelujah because the Bible says it
[1:32:24] next hallelujah and that which is not
[1:32:27] corruptible see gold will corrupt your
[1:32:30] clothes will get old God doesn't care
[1:32:32] about that even the ornament of a meek
[1:32:34] and quiet spirit which is in the sight
[1:32:37] of God great price great price God God
[1:32:42] gets God is cheerful God rejoices when
[1:32:45] we have meek sisters and we have loving
[1:32:49] husbands amen
[1:32:50] when we have meek sisters that can can
[1:32:53] follow other husband's desires and
[1:32:56] follow the teaching the church God loves
[1:32:58] meet women like that and God loves a man
[1:33:00] that will love his family he'll treat
[1:33:04] his wife like he treats himself God
[1:33:06] loves a man like that and that's very
[1:33:09] valuable in the sight of God or valuable
[1:33:11] than any mega church or any building any
[1:33:15] building fun of ten million dollars
[1:33:17] how could you build a ten million dollar
[1:33:19] church when you know Christ is coming
[1:33:20] like brother Rams and how could you do
[1:33:22] that I don't know I've never in that
[1:33:24] situation but are in other words our
[1:33:28] outward appearance shows what's on in
[1:33:29] our heart verse five for after this
[1:33:34] manner in the old time the holy women
[1:33:36] also who trusted in God adorned
[1:33:38] themselves being in subjection their own
[1:33:40] husbands so that's the real clothing
[1:33:42] that's the real appearance God's want
[1:33:43] you to have so for our sisters is to
[1:33:45] obey their husbands and for the men to
[1:33:48] really love their wives no real man will
[1:33:51] treat a woman in a bad way if he does
[1:33:54] he's not a real man there's no man
[1:33:56] inside of him if he won't if you don't
[1:33:58] treat a woman the right way and the
[1:33:59] church said he's not even a man he's a
[1:34:02] beast
[1:34:03] he's nobody no he's no more of a man
[1:34:05] than the monkey down at the zoo the
[1:34:08] chimpanzee because he's a beast he acts
[1:34:10] like a beast he won't even treat a
[1:34:11] daughter of God the right way he's not
[1:34:13] even a man yet to get saved
[1:34:15] look at verse six even as Sara obeyed
[1:34:18] Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters
[1:34:23] you are as long as you do
[1:34:25] well and are not afraid with any
[1:34:27] amazement now the brothers will shout
[1:34:29] Amen at different churches hallelujah my
[1:34:31] wife needs to call me Lord
[1:34:33] well are you doing the next verse
[1:34:35] brothers likewise so see just the same
[1:34:38] brothers well my wife should respect me
[1:34:43] more she should listen to me well let's
[1:34:45] see if you're doing the likewise
[1:34:49] likewise she husband's dwell with them
[1:34:51] according to knowledge now knowledge
[1:34:52] means a deep understanding of
[1:34:53] Christianity so a man has to have a deep
[1:34:56] understanding of how a Christian woman
[1:34:58] needs to be treated she's not a doormat
[1:35:01] she's not any less than him as far as in
[1:35:05] God's eyes she just has a different role
[1:35:07] that's under his role she's no less
[1:35:11] she's just as valuable she still where
[1:35:13] 10,000 world's just like a man soul is
[1:35:15] hey man hallelujah giving honor so see a
[1:35:19] man is supposed to honor his wife not
[1:35:21] disrespect her like I said if he does
[1:35:23] that he's not a real man and to me he
[1:35:26] don't have the Holy Ghost if he does
[1:35:27] that if a man disrespects his wife he
[1:35:29] don't have the Holy Ghost because a
[1:35:31] woman who cuts her hair disrespects her
[1:35:32] husband and she don't have the Holy
[1:35:34] Ghost and it's likewise now that's just
[1:35:39] my opinion I don't have any quotes on
[1:35:40] that but that's just my opinion
[1:35:41] and I believe it's scriptural because
[1:35:42] right here it's I believe in Scripture
[1:35:44] as unto the weaker vessel so she's
[1:35:47] weaker physically and as being heirs
[1:35:51] together the grace of life so see they
[1:35:53] inherit the same rewards that your
[1:35:56] prayers not be hindered and a man will
[1:35:58] not answer God's prayers I'm sorry I
[1:35:59] meant God will not answer man's prayers
[1:36:01] if he's not treating his wife the right
[1:36:03] way now let me close I think I got what
[1:36:06] I got it close because I'm getting let
[1:36:09] me see how many sides I got well I'll
[1:36:19] just go
[1:36:19] let me go fast cuz these I kinda want to
[1:36:23] get the key of David thought finish let
[1:36:24] me just read you these but have men
[1:36:27] heated this truth and this is the truth
[1:36:28] he's talking about the truth that that
[1:36:30] Jesus has the responsibility for the
[1:36:32] church and brother Rams gonna show now
[1:36:34] how no most churches the the preachers
[1:36:38] take control the church now we're
[1:36:41] suppose to have preachers but the
[1:36:42] preachers are supposed to preach
[1:36:43] Christ's word not their own word
[1:36:46] Christ's word see they have esteem his
[1:36:51] person or have they esteem his person
[1:36:54] who alone has the full sovereign
[1:36:55] authority of his church I say no and let
[1:36:58] me say like this if I have offended
[1:36:59] somebody or I've done something wrong
[1:37:01] then you have a right in one month to
[1:37:03] vote me out so let me know if I need to
[1:37:08] pack my bags though alright let me know
[1:37:09] but if I've done wrong that's why God
[1:37:12] set it up that way every year they can
[1:37:14] vote you out if I'm not if I'm if I'm
[1:37:17] mistreating the church if I'm if I'm
[1:37:19] taking respond trying to control the
[1:37:21] people and get them away from the Word
[1:37:22] of God then you got a right to get
[1:37:24] somebody in here who will handle you the
[1:37:25] right way and let Christ take the
[1:37:29] responsibility that's why I love God's
[1:37:32] system praise God for an every Church
[1:37:35] age in every age the church has been
[1:37:37] governed by a hierarchy a priesthood an
[1:37:39] apostolic succession see closing the
[1:37:42] door mercy and grace to whom it will and
[1:37:44] instead of assuming the love and
[1:37:46] responsibility Church it has with
[1:37:48] mercenary lust preyed upon her and
[1:37:51] destroyed her the clergy lived in luxury
[1:37:53] while the poor Church fed on the husks
[1:37:56] of abuse and not one age did any
[1:37:59] different so see most churches don't let
[1:38:03] Christ have the authority of the church
[1:38:04] they take control of it right that's
[1:38:09] exactly right and I was encouraged you
[1:38:13] know everybody wrote that pastor
[1:38:15] appreciation card for me and one of the
[1:38:17] comments in there was brother Jesse god
[1:38:18] bless you he said your they said you're
[1:38:21] a true pastor you care for all the sheep
[1:38:24] and I thought thank you lord
[1:38:27] I don't have favorites like oh I just
[1:38:29] spend time with Naomi's family or her I
[1:38:31] just go to Adams house which I haven't
[1:38:33] meant his house
[1:38:35] you notice that I'm saying but if I hear
[1:38:37] somebody has a need I want to try to
[1:38:38] help you out I tried I want to help out
[1:38:41] everybody and I'm trying not to live in
[1:38:44] luxury when I first got my first job I
[1:38:46] signed my first contract for I think it
[1:38:48] was $29,000 and that was before taxes
[1:38:50] I've worked my way up for 14 years I've
[1:38:53] tried to earn as much money as I can to
[1:38:56] buy that van and I went into debt big
[1:38:59] time to get that van but I want a safe
[1:39:01] vehicle to bring my children to the
[1:39:03] house of God
[1:39:04] every Sunday and every Wednesday and
[1:39:08] I've done that by God's grace for 11
[1:39:11] years that's my reason I want that the
[1:39:13] last as long as I can you know I drove
[1:39:16] that other Kia van I'm just trying to
[1:39:17] tell you I'm out living in luxury I
[1:39:18] agree that a Kia van until it couldn't
[1:39:22] go anymore until the gas tank was
[1:39:24] leaking it was gonna fall off I drove it
[1:39:27] out as long as I could because I didn't
[1:39:31] want to spend my I try to give
[1:39:33] everything back to the church try to get
[1:39:34] everything back to the church to keep
[1:39:35] guest preachers coming in here to keep
[1:39:37] the lights on to keep the air on to keep
[1:39:39] the heat on it has to be done like that
[1:39:42] I'm not trying to live in luxury I'm
[1:39:44] trying to help the people if I ever need
[1:39:46] I want to know about it so I can help
[1:39:47] you out
[1:39:52] each bound itself to organization and
[1:39:54] put the government upon men and commit
[1:39:56] the church to that government there let
[1:39:58] the people rise up and they were butyl
[1:39:59] Issa pressed
[1:40:00] I'm sorry brutally pursue suppress or
[1:40:02] cast out every denomination has the same
[1:40:05] spirit so soon I was getting the
[1:40:06] denominational spirit so we're either
[1:40:09] we're either going to be under the
[1:40:10] responsibility of Christ or we're gonna
[1:40:12] be in the responsibility of a
[1:40:13] denominational spirit one of the other
[1:40:16] and it's your vote that does it right
[1:40:19] you either allow it you allow us to be
[1:40:21] governed by Christ or you allow us to be
[1:40:24] governed by denominational spirit can
[1:40:27] embrace amen
[1:40:28] your vote proves it if somebody's not
[1:40:30] right if bang doesn't right now banging
[1:40:32] are the only officers if we don't meet
[1:40:33] the office you better vote us out
[1:40:35] because it's denominational if not is
[1:40:38] ever understand you got one month to
[1:40:41] pray about that by God's grace he says
[1:40:43] every denomination has the same spirit
[1:40:45] every denomination swears it as the key
[1:40:46] to the government
[1:40:47] Church every denomination claims it
[1:40:49] opens the door but that is not true it
[1:40:51] is Jesus and Jesus alone
[1:40:53] he sets the members in the body he
[1:40:55] endowed them with their ministries
[1:40:57] praise God I never thought I'd be a
[1:40:58] preacher Christ gave me that ministry
[1:41:01] amen
[1:41:01] he puts the gifts at her disposal so see
[1:41:04] the gifts are available but we've got a
[1:41:06] sacrifice if you want a gift you've got
[1:41:08] to pray about your gift you've got a
[1:41:09] sacrifice at your gift how many know
[1:41:11] that by God's grace that's how you
[1:41:14] develop a gift you sacrifice and put
[1:41:15] time into it he cares for her and guides
[1:41:19] her she is his sole property and he has
[1:41:23] no other but her glory what a far cry
[1:41:28] from reality is this church age
[1:41:29] Philadelphia in which we live I'm sorry
[1:41:31] no not he's going to let her see you
[1:41:32] forgive me and one day soon these men
[1:41:36] that even now purport to speak for the
[1:41:38] church will be rising up in the
[1:41:40] ecumenical move to place a living
[1:41:42] Antichrist at the head of their
[1:41:43] organization which deposes the Lord and
[1:41:46] we'll find him Christ outside the church
[1:41:49] saying behold I stand at the door and
[1:41:51] knock If any man will hear my voice and
[1:41:53] open the door I will come in to him and
[1:41:55] will sup word with him and he with me
[1:41:58] but let me say this our Lord has not
[1:42:01] defeated men claim to open the door to
[1:42:03] God and shut the door but they're liars
[1:42:05] all the father has given me will come to
[1:42:07] me amen and he that cometh to Christ and
[1:42:10] no wise will be cast out he will lose
[1:42:12] none of them amen
[1:42:14] that's so encourages me because
[1:42:15] sometimes you know as a preacher I
[1:42:16] preached my heart out and people don't
[1:42:17] get saved no we had visitors Sunday and
[1:42:19] but the atom I was praying and I didn't
[1:42:21] eat that whole day hoping your mom would
[1:42:23] come to the altar you know you know how
[1:42:24] it is and you do the same you were up
[1:42:25] here at the same altar brother and
[1:42:27] sometimes I get discouraged like well
[1:42:29] maybe it was me but I have confidence
[1:42:31] here Jesus will lose none of his
[1:42:33] children amen I've just got to be
[1:42:36] faithful I just got to be a faithful
[1:42:37] seed sower it's up to God God gives you
[1:42:40] increase amen I just must plant in water
[1:42:43] and God will bring every soul to this
[1:42:45] altar that will come to this altar amen
[1:42:47] I can't beat myself up and let the devil
[1:42:50] beat me up you know I've got to stand
[1:42:52] there and say shut up devil get behind
[1:42:53] me I'm just a planter in water of this
[1:42:55] seed God will give the increase in God's
[1:42:58] season he'll do it amen it
[1:43:01] the last selected member to the body of
[1:43:03] Christ comes in then will our Lord
[1:43:04] appear this is the last quote than we'll
[1:43:08] do this quick presentation on salvation
[1:43:09] the key of David was that David the king
[1:43:12] of Israel all Israel all twelve tribes
[1:43:15] and is not jesus the son of David
[1:43:18] according to the fact that he will sit
[1:43:19] upon the throne of David in the
[1:43:21] millennium and reign and rule over his
[1:43:24] heritage surely
[1:43:26] so the key of David signifies that is
[1:43:28] Jesus who will bring in the Millennium
[1:43:30] so see he's got that he's got that veil
[1:43:32] of the bride on his shoulder he's gonna
[1:43:34] take care of us and he's gonna bring us
[1:43:36] in to the honeymoon a thousand-year
[1:43:39] honeymoon amen
[1:43:41] after the marriage supper he's gonna
[1:43:42] have that veil on he's gonna bring us
[1:43:44] into the honeymoon he who has the keys
[1:43:47] to death and he'll will raise up his own
[1:43:49] that they might share in his reign of
[1:43:51] righteousness upon the earth let's stand
[1:43:53] to our feet I want to present salvation
[1:43:56] the open door now I know this is the
[1:44:00] denominational thought so bear with me
[1:44:01] but I think there's a lot of truth in
[1:44:04] this so just watch this video here the
[1:44:06] children we we are buying these for the
[1:44:08] children at the Bible club so and church
[1:44:10] we're doing it so they can understand
[1:44:12] what the gospel is okay so this is all
[1:44:15] it is it's just a cube it's kind of like
[1:44:17] a Rubik's Cube but for someone who's
[1:44:20] never understood the gospel they have
[1:44:21] these seven pictures and I'm gonna go
[1:44:23] through each one slowly now I have all
[1:44:26] the words here so I've been teaching the
[1:44:31] kids it's like the last month about the
[1:44:32] plan of salvation this has seven
[1:44:35] pictures I teach what salvation is
[1:44:37] that's the tomb that's the rock where
[1:44:39] Jesus was his body was laid behind the
[1:44:41] tomb it's just a nice little visual for
[1:44:46] children they can understand the gospel
[1:44:47] then Jesus raised from the dead he came
[1:44:49] out of the tomb and now the cross
[1:44:57] so Jesus Christ believing in that is the
[1:44:59] bridge to eternal life
[1:45:02] and now you have to make a decision are
[1:45:04] you gonna accept Jesus's offer and go to
[1:45:06] heaven or you gonna reject him and go to
[1:45:07] hell and then if you accept him then
[1:45:11] your life is you're a new heart fill
[1:45:13] with the Holy Ghost you're gonna pray
[1:45:15] read your Bible go to church and take
[1:45:17] the gospel around the world let's go
[1:45:20] through those real slowly my god you
[1:45:21] like that by God's grace you know some
[1:45:24] people are really hard against
[1:45:24] denomination but I'm against the spirit
[1:45:27] but this can be a tool to teach children
[1:45:29] about God so see man is sinful God is
[1:45:33] holy but the Bible said and so jamya and
[1:45:36] just so you know and just sin to
[1:45:37] everyone is born and the Bible said the
[1:45:40] heart of man is deceitfully wicked above
[1:45:42] all things
[1:45:43] that's what Jeremiah says we are born
[1:45:45] and all of us have wickedness inside of
[1:45:47] us tomorrow did anybody have to teach
[1:45:49] you to lie or to steal they might have
[1:45:51] to teach you know nobody had to teach me
[1:45:53] either I just came out lying I came out
[1:45:56] lust and I came out stealing I stole
[1:45:58] money from my mom no one had to teach me
[1:45:59] to do that because we're born and sinned
[1:46:01] we're automatically losing the battle
[1:46:04] because sins inside of us but God wants
[1:46:07] us to come to the side of light so what
[1:46:09] he did he sent his son Jesus Christ and
[1:46:12] he placed all of your sins you Myron and
[1:46:14] Jacinda all your sin and my sin was
[1:46:17] placed upon him and he died so you
[1:46:20] didn't have to he was killed so you
[1:46:23] don't have to be killed and then Jesus
[1:46:27] body was put in the tomb but while his
[1:46:29] body was in the tomb his spirit his body
[1:46:32] was placed into him his spirit went to
[1:46:33] hell and defeated hell and death that's
[1:46:37] what I love about this picture
[1:46:38] his body was behind there but his spirit
[1:46:40] was somewhere else I like to add one
[1:46:42] more picture to this queue brother Adam
[1:46:44] maybe we can come up with a new design
[1:46:45] or something like that
[1:46:46] I like to see them to see how Christ
[1:46:48] took the keys of hell because no man
[1:46:51] could people who had risen from the dead
[1:46:53] but they always died after that but
[1:46:55] Jesus rose from the dead and never died
[1:46:57] again
[1:46:57] so now he's got the key of death he's
[1:47:00] got the key to hell because he conquered
[1:47:02] hell amen
[1:47:04] so now Jesus with the keys of death and
[1:47:07] hell he raised from the dead with all
[1:47:08] power of heaven now he's got all power
[1:47:10] of heaven
[1:47:11] power authorities given to me in heaven
[1:47:12] and earth and now he sends his holy
[1:47:17] spirit and it's convicting us we must
[1:47:21] the only bridge we have back to God the
[1:47:22] only way we get to back to God is
[1:47:23] through the cross to remember that he
[1:47:26] forgave our sins so the cross is the
[1:47:28] bridge to forgiveness and our sins
[1:47:30] I'm sorry forgiveness of our sins and
[1:47:32] eternal life that's how we leave from
[1:47:35] the darkness that first picture and get
[1:47:37] to the light is through the blood of
[1:47:39] Jesus Christ and I wish see if I had my
[1:47:41] way but Adam I put blood all over this
[1:47:44] cross if I'd my way sister Naomi I
[1:47:46] that's what I do but that's just me I
[1:47:49] put because because it's the blood of
[1:47:52] Christ that takes us there amen it's the
[1:47:54] life in that blood the Holy Spirit and
[1:47:58] then you have to decide are you gonna
[1:48:01] repent accept God's help to come out of
[1:48:04] that pit of hell are you accept god set
[1:48:06] up to stop lying and stealing and
[1:48:08] lusting and cheating and cussing and
[1:48:09] doing evil and watching evil movies are
[1:48:12] you gonna accept his help and let him
[1:48:13] pull you up out of that pit or are you
[1:48:15] gonna remain in that pit it's your
[1:48:16] choice will you repent and follow Christ
[1:48:19] or reject him it's your choice and then
[1:48:23] if you do accept and he'll fill your
[1:48:24] heart with the Holy Ghost you have a
[1:48:26] brand new heart and faithful followers
[1:48:30] will pray because praying is talking to
[1:48:32] God and that's where God talks to you
[1:48:34] also through preaching but that's a
[1:48:36] personal prayer that he talks to you
[1:48:38] that that's really really important
[1:48:41] praying once you have the Holy Ghost you
[1:48:43] give your life to prayer you got to
[1:48:45] study and learn more about his word got
[1:48:46] to go to church and that fellowship you
[1:48:48] can't love God without loving his people
[1:48:50] I like how that's a black hand and a
[1:48:51] white hand like that because Christian
[1:48:54] doesn't care about your color of skin it
[1:48:56] just cares about your heart what is in
[1:48:59] your heart that hidden man is the real
[1:49:02] Christian right that's what's valuable
[1:49:04] God that inside your heart what's inside
[1:49:06] your heart what's inside your heart
[1:49:07] that's what God cares about and then
[1:49:10] you'll go to church you'll have
[1:49:11] fellowship with all the saints I love
[1:49:12] that we have Asians here black here I'm
[1:49:16] Spanish half and what else do we got
[1:49:19] here what else am I missing anything
[1:49:21] well Jose yeah Spanish Mexican okay
[1:49:25] we got like a whole mix right here in
[1:49:27] the Akron Ohio I love it I love that a
[1:49:31] man I'm so thankful because every every
[1:49:33] culture has something special about them
[1:49:35] God made them special a certain way and
[1:49:39] I love that about everybody I love that
[1:49:40] we have everything here like the
[1:49:41] International Church in Akron and then
[1:49:44] Christians aren't satisfied with just
[1:49:46] Akron they send preachers to Thailand
[1:49:48] they send preachers around the world
[1:49:51] because they want cry they want people
[1:49:52] in other countries who don't have the
[1:49:54] privilege to worship like we do they
[1:49:55] want they want to see them receive
[1:49:57] Christ okay so does that help Jamar does
[1:50:01] that help was that was that good just
[1:50:04] sin does that help a little bit okay and
[1:50:05] if you won't wear those cubes I'll buy
[1:50:07] one for you and it's just nice it's a
[1:50:10] good way to show just simply explain it
[1:50:13] so nobody can come here and say we don't
[1:50:15] preach the cross we preach the cross
[1:50:17] that's all we have is the cross this bar
[1:50:20] has a word of Prayer here Heavenly
[1:50:22] Father were thankful Lord God for the
[1:50:25] plan of salvation Lord God for the open
[1:50:32] door to us which we know in your
[1:50:36] scripture you get open the door to the
[1:50:38] Gentiles in order to even this age
[1:50:40] you're knocking as we read you are
