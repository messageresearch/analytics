[42:48] but you just say god i want to hear from
[42:50] you amen and god will meet that need
[42:51] amen genesis chapter 22
[42:54] and this is uh just want to take a
[42:56] thought this morning of the final test
[42:58] the final test how many believes we're
[43:00] in the final test in the face of the
[43:01] earth amen
[43:02] these are coming to the final test and i
[43:04] believe abraham showed us a very good
[43:06] pattern amen that we can put an example
[43:09] to
[43:09] that we can look and study and see if
[43:11] our life lines up to it amen
[43:14] so we look here in genesis chapter 22
[43:16] and he says and it came to pass
[43:17] after these things that god did tempt
[43:20] abraham
[43:21] and said unto him abraham and he said
[43:23] said behold
[43:25] here i am and he said take now thy son
[43:28] my only son isaac will now love us
[43:30] and get to the land of the moriah and
[43:32] offer him there for a birth offering
[43:33] upon one of the mountains which i will
[43:35] tell thee of
[43:36] and abraham rose up early in the morning
[43:38] and saddled his ass and took two of his
[43:40] young men with him
[43:41] and isaac his son enclaved the wood for
[43:43] the burnt offering and rose up and went
[43:45] to the place which god had told him
[43:47] and then on the third day abraham lifted
[43:49] up his eyes and saw the place so far off
[43:52] and abram said unto his young men abide
[43:54] ye here with the ass
[43:56] and i and the lad will go yonder and
[43:58] worship and come again to you
[44:00] and abram took the wood for the burnt
[44:01] offering and laid it upon isaac his son
[44:04] and he took the fire in his hand and a
[44:05] knife and they went both of them
[44:07] together
[44:08] and isaac spake unto abraham his father
[44:10] and said my father and he said here
[44:12] am i my son and he said behold the fire
[44:14] and the wood but where is the lamb for
[44:16] the burnt offering
[44:18] and abram said my son god will provide
[44:21] himself a lamb for a bird offering
[44:23] so they went both of them together don't
[44:25] you love these scriptures amen
[44:26] they're just beautiful and they came to
[44:28] the place which god had told him of and
[44:30] abram built an altar there
[44:32] and laid the wood in the order and bound
[44:34] isaac his son and laid him
[44:36] on the altar upon the wood and abram
[44:38] stretched forth his hand and took the
[44:39] knife to slay his son
[44:41] and the angel lord called unto him out
[44:44] of heaven and said abraham abraham he
[44:46] said here
[44:47] am i and he said lay not this hand upon
[44:50] thy lad neither do
[44:51] anything unto him for now i know thou
[44:53] fierst god
[44:55] seeing then that thou hast not withheld
[44:57] thy son thy only son from he
[44:59] and abram lifted up his eyes and looked
[45:01] and behold behind him a ram caught in
[45:03] the thicket
[45:04] by his horns and abram went and took the
[45:06] ram and offered him up for a burnt
[45:08] offering instead of his son
[45:09] and abraham called the name of the place
[45:12] jehovah
[45:13] jireh and this and it said to this day
[45:16] in the mountain lord it shall be seen
[45:19] this is our hearts turn one more time as
[45:21] we might become
[45:22] father we've read your word lord god we
[45:25] just ask for anointing to come and

[45:28] children father god speak to me

[45:57] you know sometimes and this is maybe
[45:59] just me but sometimes you begin to talk
[46:01] about bible characters and
[46:03] you know they seem so big amen they seem
[46:05] like oh abraham
[46:07] noah moses they never had
[46:10] any problems they never did anything
[46:13] wrong
[46:14] they were perfect they were in the bible
[46:16] amen but if you read the bible that's
[46:18] not the truth amen
[46:20] amen if you look at the scriptures you
[46:22] know we hold them in such high regard
[46:24] which i believe we should saints of god
[46:26] but we put their lives so
[46:28] untouchable that we can't live that kind
[46:31] of life
[46:31] but if you look back at abraham's life
[46:34] i'm so thankful
[46:35] that abram came out of the earth the
[46:37] child is why
[46:38] because he was a heathen oh glory he was
[46:41] a gentile
[46:42] how many can identify this morning the
[46:45] bible said brother branham said he was
[46:46] an
[46:47] ordinary man how many can identify this
[46:50] morning
[46:51] not somebody special not some way
[46:53] unattainable thing
[46:54] but he was an ordinary man hallelujah
[46:59] you're telling me an ordinary man can
[47:01] hear the voice of god
[47:02] praise the lord this morning i'm
[47:04] evidence of it i'm an ordinary man
[47:06] but the voice of god has come down in my
[47:09] life hallelujah
[47:10] and god brought it and it matched the
[47:12] word that my story is right there at the
[47:15] end of hebrews 11.
[47:16] it matches right up with them how do you
[47:18] say that brother man
[47:19] because they without me is not made
[47:22] perfect
[47:23] but there is one that has come that has
[47:25] made things perfect
[47:26] and he's come to the ordinary he's come
[47:29] to the small
[47:30] he's come to you and i this morning
[47:32] hallelujah
[47:34] you know sometimes in our mind we get
[47:35] abraham father abraham
[47:38] paul motherboard
[47:43] just so high that it's unattainable the
[47:46] saints of god those examples were
[47:48] written
[47:49] for you and i to show us that it's
[47:51] attainable
[47:52] but it's only attainable by the grace
[47:55] and election of jesus christ
[47:58] hallelujah was abraham looking for god
[48:02] no were you looking for god you said
[48:05] brother man i
[48:06] i went to church i i wanted to notice
[48:08] you who led you to go to church
[48:12] who sent that guy down your way who was
[48:15] it
[48:17] it was the trolling power of almighty
[48:20] god
[48:21] that came that it was the grace of god
[48:24] many has rejected that call
[48:26] but aren't you thankful this morning by
[48:28] the grace of god you're still standing
[48:30] you're still walking you're still going
[48:34] it's the grace of god
[48:37] it was nothing abraham did he was not
[48:40] some special person
[48:41] but he was ordinary saints of god all
[48:44] right
[48:45] makes me feel good this morning i don't
[48:47] know about you i'm nobody

[49:06] sometimes like samuel
[49:08] hallelujah he didn't know what was
[49:09] speaking to him but let me hear you this
[49:12] morning
[49:12] god comes knocking on young people
[49:14] because i believe there's young people
[49:16] in this message that need this voice of
[49:18] god speaking to their hearts
[49:20] i believe they have it speaking to their
[49:21] hearts and they don't realize it right
[49:23] amen thank you god you young people let
[49:25] me tell you stupid before the scars of
[49:27] the world come down upon you

[49:41] hear the testimony of young people
[49:42] well i did this and you know all these
[49:44] all these young people hear this
[49:46] testimony
[49:46] of how well he went in the world and i
[49:48] don't have a testimony the one that
[49:50] stayed true to god
[49:51] that's the one that has the true
[49:52] testimony hallelujah
[49:55] you don't have to go this way to be
[49:57] scarred to it but the one that is sealed
[49:59] before they even
[50:00] come into that contact that's the one
[50:02] that has the testimony
[50:04] praise oh do you love him this morning

[50:24] worshipper
[50:25] of idols amen that's what he said says
[50:27] god do you think you think abraham

[50:31] washed up these idols
[50:33] you normally do what your daddy does
[50:34] don't you amen so he was right there in
[50:37] it but there came a call upon his life
[50:41] hallelujah aren't you thankful for that
[50:43] call upon your life
[50:45] amen did abraham make mistakes
[50:49] did god see him read his testimony in
[50:53] the new testament

[52:34] same way we're just gonna have a great
[52:36] time tonight
[52:37] i mean he's almost like just coming out
[52:39] of his shoes
[52:41] brother everything is so good i'm
[52:43] thinking man does this guy live on a
[52:44] different planet
[52:46] is he living in the same skin i am no
[52:49] but he's doing what
[52:50] our prophet told him to do amen it
[52:52] doesn't matter how you feel
[52:54] [Music]
[52:59] so about hallelujah i don't feel like
[53:00] coming to church this morning why are
[53:01] you here it was something greater within
[53:03] you moving
[53:04] i said i'm going to overcome that i got
[53:07] a headache this morning you know jesus
[53:09] had a headache too he knows how you're
[53:10] feeling
[53:10] hey man but he also knows you're still
[53:13] sitting in the house of god saying
[53:15] praise the lord anyway
[53:18] bless our sister karen this morning amen
[53:20] i love her with all my heart amen
[53:22] amen amen
[53:27] listen now brother said this i just want
[53:29] to paint this picture of abraham
[53:30] so you can directly identify with
[53:31] abraham so many times we get these
[53:34] characters in the bible and we get them
[53:35] so big that we can't ever identify with
[53:36] them they're so much better than us
[53:38] they they uh they know everything that
[53:40] they didn't have any problems but that
[53:41] is not the truth
[53:42] that is absolutely not true god put
[53:44] weaknesses in that bible so that you and
[53:46] i could see that when they had
[53:47] weaknesses they knew where to go
[53:49] where was abraham consciously going if
[53:50] you watch the life of abraham
[53:52] everywhere abraham did you know what he
[53:54] did he built an altar
[53:56] he knew that altar why because he knew
[53:59] he needed to hear the voice of god for
[54:01] the next move
[54:02] [Applause]
[54:03] you know i saw this thing the other day
[54:04] of baptist preachers telling mother
[54:05] jesse about this it blessed my heart he
[54:07] took a woman there was like
[54:08] probably a uh uh a thousand people in
[54:11] the audience maybe it was 500 to a
[54:12] thousand people a lot of people he took
[54:14] a woman out of the middle of the
[54:14] audience put a blindfold on her
[54:16] and said now follow me and the only
[54:19] thing that she had to follow
[54:20] with it was not her visual sign but it
[54:22] was by the voice
[54:24] and he said follow me he walked away
[54:25] from her real quick he said now listen
[54:27] he said that's not the voice of god the
[54:28] voice of god will give you specific
[54:30] instructions
[54:32] amen so what did she do he started
[54:34] walking her around the audience
[54:36] and the only way she couldn't see she
[54:38] didn't know what was in front of her he
[54:39] put obstacles in front of her but he
[54:41] told her take a high step
[54:42] over this next one with your right foot
[54:44] now hold still now stop
[54:46] and he showed her how god aligns
[54:48] everything the steps are ordered
[54:50] of the lord amen but we walk by faith
[54:53] not by
[54:54] faith amen not by what you see not by
[54:57] your understanding
[54:59] amen so many times we won't take a step
[55:01] because we don't understand what god's
[55:03] doing
[55:04] but that's not how he called you he
[55:06] called abraham by faith
[55:08] he called you by faith amen what did he
[55:10] tell abraham
[55:11] separate from the things of the world
[55:13] separate from your family
[55:15] it's a god there needs to be a
[55:17] separation like never before
[55:20] our lives need to be pure
[55:22] [Applause]
[55:23] and it's not you doing it but it's the
[55:25] holy ghost pulling you i feel the pull
[55:27] lord let me give my all that i may be
[55:30] what you want me
[55:34] amen abraham made mistakes
[55:37] abraham lied that's right it's the truth
[55:40] yes but aren't you thankful for i will
[55:45] i will aren't you thankful for an
[55:47] unconditional covenant
[55:48] that he called you aren't you thankful
[55:50] for the grace
[55:52] unmerited favor
[55:59] i want to do right then amen think about
[56:01] it you don't want to just talk well i
[56:02] can do whatever i want no
[56:04] that's the wrong attitude i question
[56:05] your call at the beginning that's right
[56:07] amen right
[56:10] but when that holy ghost checks you you
[56:11] say oh lord i'm sorry that's what
[56:13] abraham did
[56:14] yes amen he went back to the altar when
[56:16] he went down into egypt what did he go
[56:18] back to
[56:18] he had to come back to the place and god
[56:20] intended him for it and he was back on
[56:21] the altar before god and god doesn't
[56:23] want a lamb on the altar he wants you
[56:27] he wants you on that
[56:34] praise the lord yes that only one foot
[56:38] on the ground either
[56:39] that means get up there
[56:43] that doesn't mean one eye over here you
[56:45] could
[56:46] get up there and let god the consuming
[56:50] fire come down
[56:52] consume every one of those desires
[56:54] consume it all
[56:55] that now that holy ghost that fire
[56:57] dwells within you
[57:00] praise the lord amen yes now listen here
[57:02] in verse verse one we're getting our
[57:03] message now by the grace of god
[57:05] it said it came debase it came to pass
[57:07] after these things
[57:08] that god did tempt abraham
[57:12] brother said this he says god loves to
[57:14] test his people
[57:17] every child that comes to god must be
[57:20] tested i'll train no
[57:24] exceptions everyone yeah
[57:29] hey how many once that free pass
[57:38] how many likes to go through trials how
[57:40] many likes tests nobody does
[57:42] all right but saints of god without this
[57:45] he must prove his child
[57:47] to show that that faith is rock solid in
[57:50] the word of god
[57:52] he is going to test you if you're going
[57:55] through tests and trials
[57:57] don't think you've done anything wrong
[58:00] don't get discouraged
[58:02] look at the word they're there for you
[58:04] it's for your good you're going to love
[58:06] them
[58:06] you're going to see character that's
[58:08] changed through your tribe
[58:09] [Applause]
[58:11] you're going to see faith that's going
[58:13] to move mountains through your trials
[58:15] hallelujah other people said you're
[58:17] either going 10 2 coming out of one
[58:19] going in you're coming out of one
[58:21] why even so much more now because he
[58:24] said he'd make a quick word
[58:25] that character must be in you to rule
[58:28] and reign
[58:30] and the only way that it's done is to
[58:32] fire
[58:34] but don't lose fellowship in the fire
[58:38] don't lose fellowship in the fire yes
[58:40] when the hebrew children walked into the
[58:41] fire where was god
[58:43] right there with them
[58:45] [Applause]
[58:48] don't lose fellowship in the fire don't
[58:50] get so downhearted that you quit praying
[58:52] that's right don't get so hard in your
[58:56] child that you can't open your bible
[58:57] say brother matt when i open it it just
[58:58] condemns me it makes me feel bad
[59:00] get right in there and read anyway
[59:04] say i haven't been there i've been there
[59:06] do you want to
[59:11] yes right you know abraham
[59:14] probably was that way too when he failed
[59:17] god sure
[59:18] he was human
[59:21] don't make him some something he's not
[59:24] you're human too the saints of god
[59:26] there's a grace
[59:28] of an unconditional love that says i
[59:30] will i will i will he has not given up
[59:33] on his own his elect will make it
[59:35] amen so listen in order to pass this
[59:38] final test
[59:40] you're going to go through trials you're
[59:42] going to go through trainings amen
[59:44] and a final test is accumulative
[59:46] [Music]
[59:47] when you go in high school and you come
[59:49] to that finals it's not just what you
[59:51] learned a week ago
[59:52] it's what you started off on that first
[59:54] journey that you went in that final test
[59:56] how many's ever come to a test before
[59:57] you're like i've been through this
[59:58] before right hey
[1:00:00] i remember what i did last time what do
[1:00:02] you do you just apply
[1:00:04] what god has already showed you to that
[1:00:06] trial
[1:00:07] now it might come in a different way the
[1:00:09] next time but god's testing you and
[1:00:11] trying to
[1:00:11] like i i had the answer in the word last
[1:00:13] i came from the word last time
[1:00:15] i prayed like that whole night man i
[1:00:16] just i just got down before god and also
[1:00:18] and then and then brother jesse came out
[1:00:20] the next morning said i just can't
[1:00:21] understand why i got to say this but i
[1:00:22] got to say this
[1:00:23] and you're back there going you got to
[1:00:25] say that because i prayed all that long
[1:00:26] because god heard me and he uses uses in
[1:00:28] the mouthpiece to speak to me
[1:00:30] hallelujah what is it saints of god
[1:00:33] these
[1:00:33] trials are to mold your character that
[1:00:36] you will pass this final test amen
[1:00:40] amen amen lord i believe this is the
[1:00:42] final test of abraham it doesn't say
[1:00:43] anything more about abraham being tested
[1:00:45] like this amen
[1:00:46] saints of god we need to pass these
[1:00:47] final tests of this end time
[1:00:49] hallelujah and i believe we're going to
[1:00:51] i believe god said his word said that we
[1:00:53] would be
[1:00:54] overcomers praise the lord
[1:00:58] amen so in order to pass this final test
[1:01:01] what did he say he said abraham there's
[1:01:03] significance in the word abraham
[1:01:06] that is a changed name there's a
[1:01:09] prerequisite to take this final test
[1:01:11] you must be born again you must have a
[1:01:14] change of nature
[1:01:15] you must not be like mommy and daddy any
[1:01:17] longer you must have a change
[1:01:19] name your name doesn't match the word
[1:01:22] of the world any longer but it matches
[1:01:25] the word of god
[1:01:26] line upon line preceptable precept
[1:01:29] your testimony is found right in the
[1:01:31] word and your name is not this that or
[1:01:34] the other
[1:01:34] but it's misses jesus christ there's an
[1:01:36] identity that you've been baptized in
[1:01:39] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:01:40] you've taken that name lord amen
[1:01:46] praise the lord you love him this
[1:01:47] morning hey man
[1:01:49] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[1:01:51] amen take your liberty this morning amen
[1:01:54] take your liberty this isn't just for
[1:01:56] brother matt to feel good and preach the
[1:01:57] word of god this
[1:01:58] is for you to draw off of him
[1:02:17] don't you just love him amen with all
[1:02:20] your heart just tell him you love him
[1:02:21] this morning
[1:02:22] lord i love you lord jesus hallelujah
[1:02:25] hey man you know what he loves you back
[1:02:26] amen
[1:02:27] he gives you a hug right back amen you
[1:02:30] kiss him he kisses you
[1:02:32] praise the lord amen so what was it
[1:02:36] abraham he was on a first name basis
[1:02:39] with god
[1:02:40] i don't know he said to god you need to
[1:02:42] know him like that it didn't
[1:02:43] make me oh i met that guy what's his
[1:02:45] name i can't remember him
[1:02:48] depart from me you work of iniquity i
[1:02:50] never even
[1:02:52] do you what is new you that goes back to
[1:02:54] the garden of eden
[1:02:55] it's an intimacy with god you
[1:02:58] and god alone
[1:03:04] now when we say that you think this is
[1:03:06] what brother matt when he first started
[1:03:07] preaching
[1:03:08] i've got to know everything god i got to
[1:03:10] know what seven seals are i got to know
[1:03:11] this i can know every mystery i've got
[1:03:13] to know i've got to know i got to know i
[1:03:14] got a
[1:03:15] just tell me lord i'm a preacher you're
[1:03:17] supposed to tell me just tell me what's
[1:03:18] it say
[1:03:19] but that's not how it works you want to
[1:03:22] know the man
[1:03:23] christ jesus in such a personal way
[1:03:27] and that you and him are on a first name
[1:03:30] basis he says your name
[1:03:34] and you respond you're in communication
[1:03:38] with god
[1:03:39] how did he know his voice
[1:03:42] it wasn't sarah calling the other room
[1:03:44] there wasn't some hay guy or somebody
[1:03:46] else calling from a tent out there
[1:03:48] but there was a still small voice
[1:03:51] that said abraham he calls you
[1:03:54] by name he knows who you are
[1:03:57] he's always known who you are he knew
[1:04:00] abraham before he ever got to abraham
[1:04:07] said brother matt why would he put me
[1:04:08] through all these things god knows what
[1:04:10] you need
[1:04:11] so you'll pass this final test he
[1:04:13] prepares his people
[1:04:14] that they will pass this final test you
[1:04:16] know where he prepares his people
[1:04:17] right here judgment begins at the house
[1:04:19] of god
[1:04:21] amen he begins to test you right here
[1:04:22] you think the messages that come across
[1:04:24] this pulpit
[1:04:25] it's just brother jesse it's just
[1:04:28] whoever steps behind her
[1:04:29] no it's the same holy ghost it's
[1:04:31] preparing his people that they'll pass
[1:04:32] this final test
[1:04:34] [Applause]
[1:04:36] how many has ever heard something on
[1:04:37] sunday and then by tuesday you're going
[1:04:39] man look at that brother jesse just told
[1:04:42] me about that
[1:04:44] no no it was the holy ghost through
[1:04:45] brother jesse that just told you about
[1:04:46] that
[1:04:47] that's right because if brother jessie
[1:04:48] could place it just out for you he
[1:04:50] would probably do his best but that's
[1:04:52] not the way god gives it to you he gives
[1:04:54] you a message you come out here and you
[1:04:55] begin to speak the word of god you begin
[1:04:56] to pull on god you say things you didn't
[1:04:58] even know before you get out here
[1:05:00] when you get out here you can study as
[1:05:02] hard as you want give every ability you
[1:05:04] have but god can't use our abilities
[1:05:06] he just wants a sacrifice vessel to say
[1:05:08] lord use me he wants you to do the same
[1:05:10] thing he just wants ones that will say
[1:05:11] lord use me
[1:05:13] hallelujah praise the lord

[1:16:21] son i that who thou love us
[1:16:23] man you talking about a test do you
[1:16:25] think abraham understood this test
[1:16:28] no my brother matt
[1:16:32] he had to understand he was abraham no
[1:16:35] come on now could you i mean think about
[1:16:39] this
[1:16:40] do you think you understood that's why
[1:16:42] we walk by faith
[1:16:44] not by sight sometimes we don't
[1:16:46] understand
[1:16:47] why we're going why god would tell me
[1:16:49] that
[1:16:51] why would god say do this
[1:16:56] i know what i'm talking about i don't
[1:16:58] understand sometimes
[1:17:00] when i go through things but that's
[1:17:02] where i lean
[1:17:03] not to my own understanding hallelujah
[1:17:06] you're not trying to comprehend it with
[1:17:08] your own mind i love it when god gives
[1:17:10] you the understanding of things
[1:17:12] it's easier to walk through it but
[1:17:14] that's when you've got to have strong
[1:17:16] faith that your face said god said this
[1:17:19] that's what i'll do i don't understand
[1:17:22] it cast
[1:17:23] down that understanding do you think he
[1:17:25] had emotions right there
[1:17:28] this is he waited 25 years for this boy
[1:17:32] he waited 25 years for this boy
[1:17:36] amen do you think this boy meant
[1:17:38] something to him
[1:17:39] a very prominent promise vindicated from
[1:17:42] god made manifest in his life
[1:17:46] how much did it mean to abraham it was
[1:17:49] the apple of his eye
[1:17:52] i'm sure he got there morning there he
[1:17:54] is again look at him
[1:17:57] and i waited how much joy
[1:18:00] that he brought to him
[1:18:04] but now your hero's a word from god and
[1:18:06] god said take whom thou love us
[1:18:10] god will test you in a heart hard way
[1:18:14] amen there's been people who've been
[1:18:16] through some hard
[1:18:17] hard trials i think of brother branham
[1:18:21] think about it now he went through a
[1:18:23] test when his wife passed away
[1:18:24] i mean he reads that story and can't
[1:18:26] stand do it with a dry i can't
[1:18:30] and his baby
[1:18:33] but there was a spirit that moved inside
[1:18:35] of him said the lord giveth
[1:18:37] and the lord taketh away blessed be the
[1:18:41] name
[1:18:42] of the lord blessed
[1:18:45] be the name
[1:18:48] take him now love us i think of the rich
[1:18:50] young ruler
[1:18:52] the rich young ruler god came to him and
[1:18:54] he knew that one thing in his life
[1:18:57] that it seemed like he couldn't give up
[1:18:59] oh glory
[1:19:00] let god speak to your heart right now i
[1:19:02] don't know what it is but if god's
[1:19:03] speaking to your heart
[1:19:04] if god's coming to you and say lay it
[1:19:06] down lay it down lay it down
[1:19:08] lay it down then listen to the voice of
[1:19:10] god and follow me he's testing you
[1:19:12] to see whether or not you'll have faith
[1:19:13] in his word
[1:19:15] [Music]
[1:19:16] hallelujah just say here i am lord i
[1:19:19] give it to you
[1:19:22] amen so listen he said he says and get
[1:19:25] thee in the land of moriah offer him
[1:19:27] there for a burnt offering upon the
[1:19:28] mountain
[1:19:29] which i will tell you of here he goes
[1:19:31] again he doesn't even really know where
[1:19:33] he's going
[1:19:35] he tells him to take a step of faith is
[1:19:37] this not how abraham was called at the
[1:19:38] beginning
[1:19:41] he didn't tell him where he was going he
[1:19:43] said separate yourself
[1:19:45] yes separate into a land which i will
[1:19:47] show you
[1:19:50] saints of god do you think those tests
[1:19:51] at the beginning they're clementine
[1:19:53] take the intercede to the things that
[1:19:55] you had heard
[1:19:56] that they might not slip amen amen keep
[1:19:59] practicing the thing that
[1:20:01] god has told you when he instilled that
[1:20:03] prayer life in you when he instilled
[1:20:05] that
[1:20:05] that reading in you when he instilled
[1:20:07] that time with the lord and you
[1:20:09] get back to it amen we just need to
[1:20:18] worship him
[1:20:20] let me sometimes just a a time of
[1:20:22] singing to the lord
[1:20:24] you know there's healing in music they
[1:20:27] say i love in my house you ask my family
[1:20:29] i love for music to be playing almost
[1:20:31] all the time
[1:20:32] and it's just an instrument instrumental
[1:20:34] music in the background
[1:20:36] just a peaceful setting an atmosphere
[1:20:39] an atmosphere that god could come
[1:20:42] atmosphere to be peaceful
[1:20:44] and sometimes places it's not so
[1:20:46] peaceful
[1:20:48] because we're human beings and we've all
[1:20:50] got our own opinions and
[1:20:53] set an atmosphere that god would be
[1:20:56] pleased to dwell in
[1:20:58] so where it is moses is still walking by
[1:21:00] faith
[1:21:02] since god is time we learn we walk by
[1:21:04] faith not by sight
[1:21:06] not by feelings glory some people walk
[1:21:09] in their christian walk like feelings
[1:21:11] and they're up one day and on their face
[1:21:12] the other because feelings will lead you
[1:21:14] astray
[1:21:15] feelings will lead you contrary to the
[1:21:19] bible
[1:21:20] [Music]
[1:21:24] i'm sure jonah didn't feel well with
[1:21:26] wells belly right here
[1:21:28] i don't think he had a lot of room i
[1:21:31] don't think he was in a
[1:21:32] lazy boy down there in the wells belly
[1:21:35] right
[1:21:35] but he set his face back toward the
[1:21:38] temple of god
[1:21:39] amen there's been a temple that was
[1:21:41] rented on calvary
[1:21:43] set your eyes on calvary this morning
[1:21:45] amen
[1:21:49] i will tell you listen now praise the
[1:21:53] lord you love him
[1:21:54] amen listen and abraham
[1:21:58] rose up early
[1:22:02] abraham what did he do he began to act
[1:22:05] upon the word of god
[1:22:06] do you think abraham slept that night
[1:22:11] no do you think abraham had
[1:22:14] mind battles yes
[1:22:18] but abraham had come to the point that
[1:22:21] he started to overcome
[1:22:23] the mouth and he knew what the word of
[1:22:25] god was saying to him
[1:22:27] and he put action behind it even though
[1:22:30] his mind battles even though his
[1:22:31] thoughts
[1:22:32] even though his feelings were contrary
[1:22:34] to what god was saying
[1:22:36] he had said here i am lord he had
[1:22:38] sacrificed
[1:22:39] everything he had you want to pass this
[1:22:42] final test
[1:22:43] it's time we get to kicking out some
[1:22:45] feelings it's time we get to beating
[1:22:47] some of these mind battles
[1:22:48] and keep our eyes on the word of god and
[1:22:51] god's word will
[1:22:52] take us through
[1:22:57] you say hi brother matt i don't know how
[1:22:58] he just said he would he'll do it amen
[1:23:01] each one of us has a different route to
[1:23:02] go each one of us has a different trial
[1:23:04] to go through each one of us have a
[1:23:05] different test
[1:23:06] amen but we all go through them amen but
[1:23:09] god knows how to mold your character to

[1:26:14] of times you try to take that nature and
[1:26:16] you try to mold it with the word of god

[1:27:38] thank you lord jesus thank you
[1:27:42] hallelujah abraham rose up early do you

[1:28:00] i'll be back a little bit all right
[1:28:03] honey we'll be back i'm sure you said
[1:28:05] the same thing you did for the young man
[1:28:07] we're gonna go for a journey of worship
[1:28:08] we'll be back

[1:28:15] in genesis 12 i will take care of you i
[1:28:18] will take care of you
[1:28:19] from him i will raise up a seat from you
[1:28:21] he begin to look at the word of god

[1:28:24] god you know this word of god will help
[1:28:26] you through your final test
[1:28:27] it is the instruction manual amen

[1:28:43] like that
[1:28:44] yeah lord help us to i'm in simplicity
[1:28:47] now
[1:28:47] not something big blown up way out of
[1:28:49] proportion i believe that's why god
[1:28:50] preached
[1:28:51] god preached not by the man god preached
[1:28:54] god in simplicity before he preached the
[1:28:56] seals through brothers
[1:28:57] hallelujah it was god through and
[1:28:59] through why it was to show you
[1:29:01] don't make it so difficult don't make it
[1:29:04] so hard in your mind
[1:29:05] that you can't pass this final test

[1:29:48] god what was jesus doing he was about
[1:29:50] the father's business

[1:30:01] steps are order of god

[1:30:04] maybe that guy next to you needs to hear
[1:30:06] amen
[1:30:07] has he heard if he hadn't heard what's
[1:30:08] your problem amen let him know ask god
[1:30:11] to give you an utterance ask god to give
[1:30:12] you an open door

[1:30:16] god to give you an open door
[1:30:19] my wife was saying the other day i love

[1:30:43] difference when we bring them to the
[1:30:44] message of the hour amen when you show
[1:30:46] them who jesus truly is the revealed
[1:30:48] word for the power
[1:30:49] i don't believe we should just be
[1:30:50] slinging it around half-hazard though

[1:30:55] pearls before swine amen
[1:30:57] god didn't give you just eye who cares

[1:32:21] it don't let anything enter in
[1:32:22] move with the word of god move it with
[1:32:24] the word
[1:32:32] amen what was it rick did she stayed in
[1:32:34] the field

[1:32:51] you stay in that message
[1:32:57] say brother matt but it's hard he didn't
[1:32:59] call us to a cakewalk
[1:33:00] there's going to be a reason they said
[1:33:02] you came from laodicea
[1:33:04] there's going to be a reason but there's
[1:33:05] still an overcoming power that is the
[1:33:07] reason we keep moving
[1:33:08] amen
[1:33:12] look watch where abraham's eyes were he
[1:33:14] was lifting up his eyes
[1:33:16] i believe there's something there for
[1:33:17] you say so god look up your redemption
[1:33:20] drawing night
[1:33:22] set your affections on things above not
[1:33:24] on things in the world
[1:33:25] get them off your problems get them off
[1:33:27] your feelings he had to get his eyes
[1:33:28] somewhere else other than what was going
[1:33:30] on right but
[1:33:31] here he is walking with isaac think
[1:33:33] about it isaac doesn't know what's
[1:33:34] getting ready to happen
[1:33:35] but abraham knows the plan of god he
[1:33:37] knows what the word of god told him
[1:33:40] and he's working to fulfill that out but
[1:33:42] he you think about that
[1:33:43] every time you see guys he's like oh
[1:33:45] lord no
[1:33:47] do you think he was sad human man come
[1:33:50] on now
[1:33:50] he had emotions he's not some fictional
[1:33:54] paul bunyan big massive person greater
[1:33:57] than all of us
[1:33:58] no he's the father of our faith he
[1:34:01] walked the walk on the face of the world
[1:34:04] that you and i
[1:34:05] might take his example and say god beard
[1:34:08] unto me according to the way he
[1:34:10] let me have that type of relationship
[1:34:11] with you when you call my name i respond
[1:34:14] when your word speaks i might walk in it
[1:34:16] lord may i cast down doubt man i cast
[1:34:18] down fear man i cast down emotion man
[1:34:20] cash down all of it lord
[1:34:23] is it hard by the way there at times it
[1:34:25] is sneaking hard
[1:34:27] i'll just be honest with you it's hard
[1:34:28] yes
[1:34:30] but it's a final test but we
[1:34:34] are overcomers by the blood of the lamb
[1:34:37] he's not called you to fail all right
[1:34:42] let me say a minute he's not called me
[1:34:43] to fail
[1:34:46] he's called me to pass
[1:34:49] amen he's called me to take a rapture
[1:34:52] amen he's called me
[1:34:53] to be in the very image of jesus christ
[1:34:56] amen amen let me hurry thank you i'm
[1:35:00] sorry
[1:35:05] and abraham took the word listen in
[1:35:06] verse five and abram said unto his young
[1:35:08] men abide ye here with the ass and i in
[1:35:10] the lab will gather you under and
[1:35:11] worship
[1:35:12] and come again to you abraham did not
[1:35:14] speak doubt
[1:35:16] he did not speak oh glory be negative
[1:35:20] he did not let his testimony match his
[1:35:22] feelings glory
[1:35:23] he did not let testimony match his
[1:35:25] thoughts he let his testimony
[1:35:27] match faith in the word of god and his
[1:35:29] father that he would take care of him he
[1:35:31] would fulfill his word
[1:35:32] that seed would come to fruition
[1:35:35] amen through isaac amen
[1:35:39] he begin to look at the promises of god
[1:35:41] oh saints of god
[1:35:42] there's where we confess our faith it's
[1:35:44] right in the promises of god
[1:35:45] don't confess it on your feelings don't
[1:35:47] confess it on your body don't confess it
[1:35:49] on anything else
[1:35:49] confess it upon the word of god and
[1:35:52] brother branham told us that if we do
[1:35:54] that
[1:35:54] he's the high priest of our confession
[1:35:56] it's right in the word of god and he
[1:35:58] will take our confession
[1:35:59] and let it match the word of god amen
[1:36:01] the problem is it doesn't happen
[1:36:02] spontaneously
[1:36:03] so we begin to doubt but keep confessing
[1:36:06] the word of god
[1:36:06] and tell your body your soul your spirit
[1:36:09] comes in line with the word of god
[1:36:15] until the greatest battle battle ever
[1:36:17] fought becomes not a losing battle
[1:36:18] but one that you overcome and you win
[1:36:21] amen
[1:36:22] one the devil i have to go down there

[1:39:44] we shouldn't do that we should labor in
[1:39:46] the gospel i'm not saying that
[1:39:48] but it's not based on your ability to do
[1:39:50] that it's based on the holy ghost coming
[1:39:52] down
[1:39:53] and leading you into all truth right
[1:39:56] all right praise the lord verse 6 and
[1:39:59] abraham took the wood and the burnt
[1:40:01] offering

[1:40:04] took his burden
[1:40:05] and laid it on the promised son oh glory

[1:40:45] it
[1:40:47] i gave it to god i've committed it to
[1:40:50] god brother brahm said one of the
[1:40:51] biggest weapons we have
[1:40:53] was a christian committal to god
[1:40:56] when it's too big for you to understand
[1:40:58] when it's too big for you to do it
[1:41:00] commit it to god amen man well i think
[1:41:04] we got some committing to do
[1:41:06] when that doubt was in your heart when

[1:41:13] you're not bright amen
[1:41:15] they say so god committed to him said
[1:41:18] god you've called me

[1:41:42] that thing
[1:41:44] what happened instantly i'm not saying
[1:41:46] that i'm not

[1:41:58] way do you
[1:42:00] sometimes you have to suffer but that's
[1:42:02] so you're a partaker

[1:42:10] take that first step on the other side
[1:42:14] [Music]

[1:44:22] amen amen praise the lord
[1:44:29] amen abram said my son
[1:44:32] god will provide himself a lamb
[1:44:36] for the burnt offering so they went both
[1:44:38] of them together they came to place
[1:44:40] where god had told them abraham build an
[1:44:41] altar there laid the wood in order you
[1:44:43] know god likes things in order
[1:44:45] i don't know how they put things in
[1:44:46] order but god likes your life in order

[1:44:54] how they built the tabernacle
[1:44:55] he gave him details amen go back oh
[1:44:58] glory
[1:44:59] what was it abraham was in total
[1:45:01] dependence upon god amen
[1:45:03] god gave you details of noah on how to
[1:45:04] build the ark but he never gave him a
[1:45:06] detail
[1:45:07] on how to guide it did he he never put a
[1:45:09] a wheel in there
[1:45:10] hey turn it left no why because he says
[1:45:13] you depend upon me
[1:45:14] saints of god the only way we're gonna
[1:45:16] pass this final test is we get in total
[1:45:18] surrender and total dependence upon god
[1:45:22] amen amen you love him
[1:45:31] we know the rest of the story we get
[1:45:33] down
[1:45:34] to jehovah
[1:45:41] worried an angel lord called him in
[1:45:43] verse 10 and abraham stretched forth his
[1:45:45] hand
[1:45:45] and took the knife and the angel lord
[1:45:47] called up unto him out of heaven he said
[1:45:49] abraham abraham and he said here
[1:45:52] am hi

[1:46:09] was fighting
[1:46:10] you can't tell me he didn't have
[1:46:12] emotions can't tell me he didn't have
[1:46:13] problems i don't believe that
[1:46:16] like passions i think elijah said yes
[1:46:19] right
[1:46:23] but here he was right the exact place
[1:46:26] doing exactly what the word told him to
[1:46:28] do amen
[1:46:30] did he understand it all no do you think
[1:46:33] joseph understood all of his life
[1:46:36] no but didn't his life perfectly
[1:46:39] tight jesus christ
[1:46:43] isn't god's thinking higher than our
[1:46:45] thinking hallelujah
[1:46:47] then if we've committed it to him and
[1:46:49] we're depending on him
[1:46:51] then walk through the trial knowing he's
[1:46:53] going to take care of you
[1:46:58] and the angel lord called him him out of
[1:47:00] heaven how many wants to hear this
[1:47:02] abraham abraham he said here i am and he
[1:47:04] said lay not my hand upon the land
