[0:05] Let me just sing a little song so I can
[0:08] I just want to worship the Lord myself.
[0:10] Um I just have a couple that I really go
[0:13] to because my voice is doesn't have
[0:15] super range like others. I wouldn't say
[0:19] I've never been invited to do a
[0:22] solo at the choir when I was in high
[0:24] school. They said, "Yeah, brother,
[0:26] you're going to be in the choir, not
[0:27] you're not a lead singer.
[0:29] Praise the Lord. So that's what we want
[0:32] to do uh by God's grace is u just make a
[0:36] joyful noise.
[0:41] See if I can find a list here of songs.
[0:43] There should be a list somewhere.
[0:46] Here we go. Um
[0:50] and uh due to
[0:54] that thing called memory. I remember in
[0:56] high school I was with Jason Colola J6
[0:58] and we're in choir, show choir. For the
[1:02] finale of your senior year, you had to
[1:04] sing a solo. Well, me and Jason Col J6
[1:07] didn't have really
[1:10] ability to do those sort of things. We
[1:12] asked humbly, we said, uh, Mrs. Sh, Miss
[1:15] Shandell,
[1:17] I said, can me and Jason, you know, we
[1:19] came together, can we do like a a duet?
[1:21] And she's like, oh yeah, sure, that'd be
[1:23] fine.
[1:24] So, we chose a actually it was actually
[1:26] a hymn.
[1:27] Uh,
[1:29] it was a Bible hymn and I can't remember
[1:31] what Bible him was. Uh,
[1:35] I'll have to call him, but uh
[1:42] I don't know. Do we have
[1:44] Can I sing I must tell Jesus. Uh, I
[1:47] might just sing that. But anyhow, while
[1:49] we're doing the duet, me and him
[1:50] practiced and practiced and practiced
[1:52] together. And we leaned on each other
[1:54] for uh the melody and for the rhythm and
[1:59] how to start and when to start the next
[2:01] verse. And it was some kind of I can't
[2:03] remember what uh
[2:06] and me and him we did good the first two
[2:08] verses. We did the cho the chorus and
[2:10] then come down to the third verse.
[2:12] Remember this had to be by memory.
[2:15] The piano started
[2:18] and we missed it. We just lost it.
[2:20] I couldn't remember that verse
[2:24] and inspiration hit me as it always does
[2:30] and most time for uh comical reasons or
[2:33] comical uh effect. I just started
[2:35] singing something something.
[2:39] Oh, come all ye faithful. That was the
[2:40] song. Come something something. And I
[2:42] just we did then he joined in with me
[2:44] and we just started singing something
[2:45] something and then we hit the we hit the
[2:47] chorus again and the fourth verse
[2:49] something something and we got a
[2:52] standing ovation.
[2:55] We go back you know and we're just
[2:56] cutting up here. Girls are crying on the
[2:59] sidelines because they missed one one
[3:01] note or one key and me and Ko just
[3:05] winged it.
[3:08] We did our best. Right. So that's what
[3:10] we're doing here today. By God's grace,
[3:12] I don't need the words, sister.

[9:04] every battle. Lord, we fall and we get
[9:06] up, God. Lord, we fail, we get up, Lord.
[9:08] Sometimes we backslide hourly and daily,
[9:11] God, and we get back up, Lord, by your
[9:13] grace.
[9:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:17] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him this morning?
[9:20] &gt;&gt; A lot of times I think saints as I may
[9:23] be seated, I think, why
[9:26] what am I doing here?
[9:30] How did we get to this place? How did we
[9:32] come to this conclusion that This is the
[9:34] truth. What God had to do something to
[9:37] bring us here. He had to do something in
[9:39] your lives to get you here. And we are
[9:41] grateful for those things by God's
[9:43] grace. Um
[9:45] uh the Lord's been good. Thank you
[9:47] musicians so much for your gifts and
[9:49] talents, your sacrifice, giving you
[9:50] time, energy,
[9:52] uh everything that God has given you.
[9:56] Certainly he's faithful.
[9:58] Um I don't know if this is going to kick
[10:00] in. Uh Of course, we this week we've had
[10:05] quite a a week in America u getting
[10:09] texts from overseas and what's it like?
[10:11] What's the condition over there saying
[10:12] what's the condition? What's the
[10:14] condition? What's it like over there?
[10:15] What's going on? this and this and this
[10:17] and uh I said well it shows what has
[10:21] happened this week has showed a lot
[10:22] about people
[10:26] reactions
[10:28] and one of the first things that's come
[10:30] to my mind while I was uh
[10:33] thinking on this and looking at the way
[10:36] family uh the way the uh people reacting
[10:40] in the comments we see a lot of
[10:42] heartbroken individuals
[10:45] yet we're seeing a God that are rejoice
[10:47] with such a thing. You know the Bible
[10:50] says
[10:52] in Revelations 11 that when the two
[10:55] witnesses are are killed and their body
[10:58] lays on the street uh that the world
[11:01] rejoices over the death of the prophets
[11:04] of God.
[11:08] See the condition of the people.
[11:11] We're on the edge of this.
[11:13] We are on the edge of this.
[11:18] I got I got this one.
[11:39] Amen. So
[11:41] in this we see the condition of the
[11:44] people rejoicing over a man who wanted
[11:47] to not necessarily win soul by power
[11:50] demonstration but uh he has he went to
[11:54] come and reason let us reason together
[11:57] scripturally come and let us reason
[11:59] together
[12:02] uh by God's grace and uh we see that uh
[12:08] we see how the out people. We see what
[12:10] the devil had in store, what the devil
[12:11] had in planned for this man, and how God
[12:14] allowed this thing to take place. And
[12:16] now it's uh u
[12:19] it's causing even more division in the
[12:21] nation. It's causing even more turmoil.
[12:24] Um
[12:26] if not, that's no no problem. Um
[12:31] but uh
[12:33] I had went on vacation a couple about a
[12:35] month ago with I brought my mother and
[12:38] she did not to listen to
[12:40] uh the home service via the internet on
[12:44] Sunday morning. So I took her to a
[12:45] church uh up in the UP there. It was a
[12:49] Calvary church, little small storefront
[12:50] church and the pastor was not
[12:52] ministering then but he brought in a man
[12:55] who uh is literally like a Christian
[12:57] military. Uh he is he's he's uh made
[13:01] contacts with XCIA, ex FBI and they go
[13:05] in they're all Christian. They go into
[13:07] war ravaged countries and they rescue
[13:10] orphans. They rescue widows. They whis
[13:12] rescue men who their family been
[13:14] destroyed and slaughtered. They go and
[13:16] sneak in there and try and get them out
[13:18] as many as they can and relocate them
[13:19] and take care of them financially uh uh
[13:22] do their best to do that. And in his
[13:25] little speech and uh he wanted people to
[13:28] help support his ministry. He said 100%
[13:30] of this goes to these people. In fact,
[13:32] you get to choose on the back side. you
[13:33] want to help their their warriors to go
[13:35] in and this and that and support them
[13:36] while they can't have jobs. They just go
[13:38] in and dressed in all gear and just like
[13:41] it's amazing. Uh but he said he said he
[13:44] said saints he said uh um in his 20
[13:47] years of going into war ravaged
[13:49] countries like Sudan and Kenya and now
[13:51] they're in the Ukraine after Russia went
[13:54] through there and certain countries and
[13:55] Russia wiped out towns and towns and
[13:59] many many people
[14:02] but uh They said, "I've never seen the
[14:05] world in such a" They see he's like he's
[14:07] like he said he just called like turmoil
[14:09] and distress. He said this he said this
[14:12] is the worst I've ever seen it. He said
[14:14] something's coming because of what
[14:16] tensions are rising, nervousness,
[14:20] anxiety and all the people they know
[14:22] something is about ready to strike.
[14:24] Saint were right at the doors right at
[14:27] the coming of the Lord. Um so as we're
[14:32] Yeah.
[14:38] So, yeah, the Lord is faithful. Um he's
[14:41] he's good. He's kind. Um
[14:45] we just can't thank the Lord enough. We
[14:47] appreciate the invitation by God's grace
[14:49] to come and minister.
[14:52] Also want to bring greetings from Pastor
[14:54] Cam Smith there. You guys know him.
[14:58] Wonderful brother.
[15:01] So, uh, in that, uh, like I think Jess
[15:06] mentioned there, um,
[15:09] as we went through this week, I had four
[15:11] individuals come specifically. Two of
[15:13] three of them text me and one of them I
[15:15] was at a supply house and I was ordering
[15:17] material for a job and he said, "Simon,
[15:19] let me come out and help you load this
[15:21] up." Okay? And he never done that
[15:23] before. And as we get loading, he says,
[15:24] "Simon, I got to ask you a question.
[15:27] What is going on?"
[15:30] So now there's four people just and and
[15:32] three of them I would have never guessed
[15:35] but what in your days and your who you
[15:36] were you witness right you witness about
[15:38] Jesus Christ and uh the one had actually
[15:40] made comment oh yeah Catholic skill
[15:42] Christians and I was like okay why don't
[15:44] you know well he's one of the one of the
[15:45] men that text me he's like sign where we
[15:47] at and I said sir I said we're he's a
[15:49] young man very very young man I said
[15:51] this is coming this thing is coming
[15:53] you're going to see this this thing is
[15:54] going to unfold in your face and you
[15:56] will see the coming of the Lord now we
[15:59] want be on the right side of it. Um, but
[16:02] as this man uh uh that was helping me
[16:05] load up the truck, he asked me, "Simon,
[16:07] where are we at?" I started sharing with
[16:09] him. The name is George. I said,
[16:11] "George, you've got to come to." He
[16:13] said, "Simon," he goes, "I'm a
[16:14] Lutheran." He said, he said, "Now the
[16:15] Lutherans have fully welcome in all the
[16:17] homosexual." He says, "That is
[16:19] completely contrary to the Bible." He
[16:20] said, "They used to preach Bible, but
[16:22] they don't know more." He says, "Where
[16:23] can I go to church? Where do you want me
[16:25] to Where should I go to church? Where
[16:26] would you recommend
[16:29] How could I point him to a a Pentecostal
[16:31] church? How could I point him to? I said
[16:32] I said, "Brother George," I said,
[16:34] "Brother George," I said, "You need to
[16:35] come to the church I go to or one there
[16:37] up just over Mission." I said, "Uh, and
[16:39] that's the only two I would even
[16:40] recommend in this area." He said,
[16:42] "Really?" I said, "Yes." And I started
[16:44] working. I said, "The repentance and
[16:45] baptism because all the other churches
[16:47] around here baptize wrong and they will
[16:49] not bring in your repentance." He goes,
[16:51] "Simon, what do I repent of?" I said,
[16:53] "Well, you need to know what sin is
[16:54] then."
[16:56] When I first come to the message, I
[16:57] didn't know what sin was.
[16:59] Wow. Complete lack of reverence,
[17:01] complete under no understanding of the
[17:03] word of God, no understanding of
[17:04] holiness, no idea. I said, I'd like just
[17:08] come or I'd like to have some Bible stud
[17:10] to to show you and you'll hopefully by
[17:12] the grace of God, you'll feel
[17:13] conviction. And I felt the presence of
[17:15] the Lord coming. I said, you've got to
[17:16] repent. And when you get baptized, you
[17:18] have to go down dead, George. And when
[17:21] you go down dead, then the spirit of God
[17:22] is obligated to fill you with his
[17:25] spirit. And
[17:26] &gt;&gt; I felt the presence of the Lord right
[17:27] then and he just said, "I'm getting
[17:28] chills." I said, "It's the Lord is
[17:30] calling you."
[17:31] &gt;&gt; And come to find out, uh, we've been,
[17:33] uh, having Brother Randy and Sister
[17:34] Lindsay the last two weeks with our at
[17:35] our house for two weeks. We've had him
[17:37] and Sister Lindsay and my wife woke up
[17:39] that day and asked the Lord to give me
[17:40] somebody to witness to. So God is a He
[17:44] answers prayer. So we want to be uh, and
[17:46] I didn't know that, but what guess what?
[17:48] If the Lord if they prayed for it, then
[17:50] the Lord's going to answer, right?
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's just uh here stand for
[17:54] the reading of the word by God's grace.
[17:56] Um we trust this will be a blessing to
[17:58] you. Um
[18:02] I don't know how this is going to go,
[18:04] but I will we'll see how the Lord but
[18:06] but I just want do I want to be an
[18:08] encouragement. I want to be a strength
[18:09] to the bride. Otherwise, there's no
[18:10] point of me being, you know, it's it's
[18:13] and I and I and I want to approach this
[18:14] because I'm speaking to the bride of
[18:17] Christ. We're at a serious What was What
[18:20] was his ministry? What was Charlie
[18:21] Kirk's ministry? What's the name of it?
[18:23] Turning point.
[18:25] Is this now a turning point in American
[18:28] history? An assassination? You know,
[18:30] assassinations were happening. Me and
[18:32] brother uh uh brother Bart were looking
[18:34] at last night in the 60s right around
[18:36] the opening of seals all the way to 68
[18:38] there was assassinations
[18:41] four in a row almost within the space of
[18:43] like five or six years of political fig
[18:45] figures. Now this isn't a political
[18:46] figure. He's a religious figure trying
[18:49] to do something for the Lord.
[18:51] Um,
[18:54] now no matter what he was, I I've read
[18:56] on the internet that he was a
[18:57] conservative, a Protestant, but then we
[18:59] see his wife been driving by with the
[19:01] rosary in her hand. So where what what
[19:04] he what he was, what they were, I'm not
[19:05] sure, but one thing for certain, he gave
[19:07] his life, right?
[19:09] &gt;&gt; So if we could, let's turn to uh Psalms
[19:12] 65.
[19:19] I I I bring this uh this thought here
[19:22] this morning because I don't want you to
[19:24] think
[19:27] let me say like this there's there's a
[19:29] quote that that the prophet said he said
[19:32] I don't see anything taking place from
[19:34] here to the coming of the Lord or
[19:36] something of that nature to where in
[19:38] other words it when someone would use
[19:40] that over the pulpit would almost give
[19:42] us like a sense of ease or relaxing time
[19:44] or there's nothing to take saints of God
[19:46] there is something to take place.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; We are. We're how many? I was like,
[19:51] we're 48 years past 77.
[19:54] [Laughter]
[19:56] &gt;&gt; Hey, he didn't see. He didn't think we'd
[19:58] make it past 77. Guess what? I was born
[19:59] in 77. So, we're 48 years past that.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; Guess what? Something things have taken
[20:05] place. The message has continued to go
[20:07] on. It's went around the world. Around
[20:09] the world. It's still winning and
[20:11] reaching souls. Pastor Jesse there just
[20:13] baptized 17 two years ago. Oh, down in
[20:15] the south, right? But God is still
[20:17] working, still moving, still trying to
[20:19] what? Win his saints, his children to
[20:22] the gospel. Amen.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Let me get to this. Psalms 65 uh verse
[20:28] one.
[20:31] He says, "Praise waiteth for thee, oh
[20:34] God, in Zion." He says, "And unto thee
[20:37] shall the vow be performed. Oh thou that
[20:40] hearest prayer, unto thee shall all
[20:42] flesh come. iniquities prevail once
[20:45] against me. As for our transgressions,
[20:48] thou shalt purge them away. Now look at
[20:50] here verse four. I want to focus on this
[20:51] this morning.
[20:54] Blessed.
[20:56] Notice this is not present tense. He
[20:58] doesn't give you a blessing. You're not
[21:01] Well, when when he when when the Holy
[21:03] Spirit wrote this through through and
[21:05] gave this to David, when this went out,
[21:08] it didn't mean you were blessed.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; It's past tense. You already were
[21:12] blessed.
[21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; So blessed is the man whom thou
[21:17] choosest. That goes all the way to
[21:19] Genesis 1, right?
[21:21] &gt;&gt; He says, "And cause us to approach unto
[21:23] thee, that he may dwell in thy courts,
[21:27] we shall be satisfied with the goodness
[21:29] of thy house, even of thy holy
[21:32] temple."
[21:34] By terrible things and righteousness
[21:36] will thou answer us, oh God, our
[21:38] salvation, who art the confidence of all
[21:39] the ends of the earth and of them that
[21:42] are a far off upon the sea. Let's bow
[21:44] our heads in a word of prayer.
[21:47] Dear Lord Jesus, Lord, we love you, Lord
[21:49] God. We just ask God that you just uh
[21:52] anoint my voice, God. Lord, anoint our
[21:54] minds, Lord. Anoint us, Lord. Anoint the
[21:56] audience, Lord God. And Lord Jesus,
[21:58] Lord, we want to let you know once
[22:00] again, Lord, you're welcome here, Lord,
[22:01] in this place dedicated for you, Lord. A
[22:05] house, Lord, for your body, Lord. Your
[22:07] body has gathered. The local church has
[22:10] gathered together, God. Lord, to hear,
[22:12] Lord, what you would have uh uh to say,
[22:15] Lord, this little vessel here, Lord.
[22:17] Lord God, I yield myself, Lord, to thy
[22:19] word, Lord, to your voice, Lord, to your
[22:21] mind. And Lord Jesus, we just want the
[22:23] words to come forth, Lord, that are
[22:25] appropriate for this time and this hour.
[22:26] Lord, I don't want anything of my own
[22:28] mind or my own accord, but Lord Jesus,
[22:30] Lord, just place in my thoughts, God,
[22:32] you know, Lord, where I lack in memory,
[22:34] but Lord God, I'm counting on fully on
[22:36] you, Lord, just to bring, Lord, this
[22:37] little thought. Lord, we love you. Bless
[22:39] your bride, your saints, your chosen
[22:42] ones this morning. Lord, we love you.
[22:44] Give them strength, God, Lord, in the
[22:46] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be
[22:48] seated uh by God's grace.
[22:54] So, um,
[23:00] my thought this morning, if I had to
[23:02] preach or or minister on something or
[23:04] teach or however it would be, I would
[23:05] I'd like to minister on approaching God.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; And in this time where there is
[23:14] America's on the brink, I heard a
[23:16] brother from overseas said, "Brother
[23:18] Simon, how is it over there?" I said
[23:19] it's it's heating up, you know, and we
[23:21] don't know what is this going to is just
[23:23] going to cool over again. Is this just
[23:25] going to, you know, just be swept under
[23:26] the carpets or or is the media going to
[23:28] push this? And if the media pushes that,
[23:31] if the powers to be that push that,
[23:33] there's a reason they're pushing it.
[23:35] There is something that they're trying
[23:36] to bring forth and manifest a reaction,
[23:40] a cause and effect. Uh they're trying to
[23:42] build what? Two two sides to everything
[23:45] so there can be a form of a a let's say
[23:47] a little war there, right? maybe in the
[23:49] that we know it's going on in the
[23:50] spiritual realm right now but with a t
[23:52] with a strike of the natural realm. So
[23:54] saints of God I think this is a time to
[23:56] start and if we haven't done it yet to
[23:58] I'm talking pray
[24:02] not just in the morning and and at night
[24:05] but to labor it's time to labor in
[24:09] prayer
[24:11] to find God like it's like he's supposed
[24:14] to be found. Uh on the way here I was
[24:17] listening to revivals. I was listening
[24:20] to how the Welch revival got started. I
[24:24] was listening to the Zuza Street
[24:26] revival. I was into a revival that took
[24:28] place in 1857 in Manhattan or New York
[24:32] City. Saints of God. There were key
[24:35] individuals in each one of these
[24:37] revivals. But notice and I and I like
[24:40] this in our first beginning here of our
[24:42] of our scripture says blessed in whom
[24:44] the man whom thou chooses. So notice
[24:47] that it was ordained all the way back
[24:49] from the foundation of the world even
[24:50] before time began that Charles Finny
[24:54] would have a revival that uh William
[24:57] Seymour would be the one to spark that
[24:59] revival. There's another man in the
[25:01] Welsh revival they credit to him. He
[25:04] started the revival. He was 26 years
[25:06] old, saints. And something in him said
[25:08] he's he wanted to be uh used of God for
[25:11] God's kingdom. Amen. And and saints of
[25:13] God, all these individuals literally
[25:15] quit their jobs and lean fully. I
[25:17] listened to the testimony of George
[25:19] Mueller on the way here. Saints of God,
[25:21] all these men quit their professions and
[25:24] what trusted solely in God for all their
[25:28] finances, all their food, all that they
[25:32] are.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God saw that sacrifice. Pastor
[25:36] Jesse preached it tremendously back home
[25:38] when he came to minister for us. Who is
[25:40] the greatest man that God ever used? Was
[25:43] it Job? Was it Moses? Was it No. Who Who
[25:45] did Jesus say the greatest man was? It
[25:47] was John the Baptist because he gave
[25:50] everything.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; Never married. Moses was allowed to go
[25:55] out in the desert, get married, have a
[25:56] wife, had had a new career as a
[25:59] shepherd, not a ruler over this or that.
[26:02] He's but what God he actually he he he
[26:04] he chose the things he wanted to do for
[26:06] 40 years
[26:08] &gt;&gt; but John the Baptist was solely set
[26:10] aside for one moment a space of time in
[26:14] such a small time was that now we see in
[26:17] the time like I'll say like this in in
[26:19] the time of uh uh of George Mueller you
[26:23] know what he said he said he says as I
[26:24] went to seek God he said he said I would
[26:26] try and pray in the house he said that
[26:28] wouldn't cut it he tried to find a
[26:30] secret place in the house he I could
[26:32] never find a secret place there. You
[26:34] know what he did? He said he woke up
[26:35] early and he went for a walk with his
[26:37] Bible.
[26:40] Well, the Bible says to find a secret
[26:42] place. Well, for him, it was literally
[26:45] getting in the word and taking a walk in
[26:47] the morning reading his Bible. And
[26:49] that's where he caught the inspiration
[26:51] for what that move of God, that that
[26:54] fire revival that he caught. Amen. Now,
[26:56] there's another man, but I can't
[26:57] remember his name right now, but and he
[26:59] was 26 years old, and God used him to
[27:01] spark and bring forth that Welch
[27:03] revival.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Evan Evan Roberts.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; Roberts.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; Evan Roberts. That's it. He started
[27:10] praying hours and hours a day, looking,
[27:14] hungering, and thirsting for a move of
[27:16] God. Amen.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; Now, you know what took place right
[27:21] before the Welch revival, which
[27:23] literally they say sparked the Isuza
[27:25] Street revival.
[27:27] He said three months before the Welch
[27:30] revival kicked in. He said he was such
[27:33] in consecration, such in prayer,
[27:38] and he would pray and pray and pray. And
[27:40] he said one night at late at night,
[27:42] midnight or 1:00, he said he was taken
[27:44] up into heaven.
[27:47] And for three to four hours he would
[27:50] speak face to face with Jesus Christ.
[27:52] And it happened every night for three
[27:55] months.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Well, brother, the day those days are
[28:02] passed.
[28:06] There's got to be a move of the bride of
[28:09] Jesus Christ.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; It is possible. But we have to lay down
[28:15] everything we want to do. Saints of God,
[28:18] the only way revival can take place is
[28:20] if it is has your will has nothing to do
[28:23] in it. You cannot interject one of your
[28:26] thoughts, one of your ideas. I'll say it
[28:28] like this. Saints of God, I was on
[28:30] vacation and Sister Barb, she brought
[28:32] this thing called the called uh this
[28:34] movie or these TV things called the the
[28:36] chosen. In the last three episodes of
[28:38] this, I watched how Judas dealt with
[28:41] Jesus and how Jesus dealt with Judas.
[28:44] Now, we can read in the scripture, but
[28:45] to see it kind of played out, you get a
[28:47] different light kind of like a
[28:52] a look at it. I'll say this or a
[28:54] different view, a different mindset. And
[28:57] as you know, Judas was expecting Jesus
[29:00] when he come to Jerusalem and there's oh
[29:02] hosana, hosana. And they brought the
[29:03] palm leaves and they're waving at the
[29:05] king. He's riding on a donkey or a a
[29:07] colt, right? And they're just welcoming
[29:09] hosana. Hosanna. And and Judas, you see
[29:12] Judas in there? He's like, "Vra God,
[29:13] this is it. Jesus, the Messiah, has
[29:15] come. He's going to take this thing
[29:17] over. We're going to be free. We're
[29:18] coming back. We're going to take the
[29:20] promised land."
[29:22] And what did Jesus do? He gets through
[29:24] there and he goes into the house of God,
[29:26] the temple of God,
[29:29] and he looks at all the money changers,
[29:32] and he starts flipping tables, starts
[29:35] tearing the house of God up.
[29:38] an angry God.
[29:41] And Judas is like
[29:46] he had in his own mind
[29:49] that this was not how this was supposed
[29:52] to go.
[29:54] And in that time we see the Pharisees,
[29:56] the Sadducees cry out. Then they start
[29:58] tempting him. He says, "Who shall we
[29:59] give? Shall we give money to the Romans
[30:01] anymore?" Now Jesus in front of
[30:03] everybody, all the Jews. Should we pay
[30:05] the Should we pay tribute to Rome? Jesus
[30:09] says, "Give me a give me a coin." Whose
[30:11] subscription's on there? Now, all of
[30:13] Israel's like, "Nope." He's going to
[30:15] say, "No." He says, "We're not paying
[30:16] any more taxes.
[30:18] We're going to be free. We want We are
[30:20] under God. One holy nation, one holy
[30:23] priesthood, or whatever you want to say
[30:24] to the Jews." You're right. We're a
[30:26] called out people. We're not many, but
[30:27] we're small, but God chose us. We're the
[30:29] apple of his eye.
[30:35] And Jesus says, "Give to Caesar
[30:36] Caesars's
[30:39] and to God's."
[30:41] &gt;&gt; And the Jews are going, Judas is like,
[30:45] "Oh no." And then the Pharisees come up.
[30:48] Says, "You're doing this and this." And
[30:49] Jesus, "What? Bring seven woes in
[30:51] Matthew 23 on these Pharisees." He says,
[30:54] "Woe unto you scribes and hypocrites and
[30:57] lawyers." He says you you you you you
[30:59] won't even go into the kingdom of God
[31:00] yourself and then you stop it up so
[31:02] others can't go. And at the end he calls
[31:04] them a new generation of serpents. He
[31:06] says he says how can you escape the
[31:07] damnation of hell? Judas is going what
[31:10] are you doing?
[31:12] This is not part of the plan.
[31:15] And directly after this he calls for a
[31:17] meeting
[31:20] a conference with Jesus.
[31:23] Judas is like, "Jesus,
[31:28] I'm one of your disciples." Jesus like,
[31:30] "Yeah, I know. I chose you. I called
[31:32] you." Judas like, "But um
[31:36] you know, you could have preached a lot
[31:38] of other things besides that." You know,
[31:40] that was not the the appropriate thing
[31:42] to preach at that time.
[31:45] We're supposed to be here, Jesus. We're
[31:47] supposed to be here. I'm with you. I am
[31:49] with you. I'm I have your back. But
[31:51] we're supposed to bring the unity. We're
[31:53] supposed to come up out of Romanism.
[31:55] We're supposed to come up out of this
[31:57] and you're supposed to unify the Jews
[31:58] and we're supposed to take the kingdom.
[32:01] He was disagreeing with the word of God
[32:04] that was preached right at the end of
[32:06] the Lord's visit. He had a problem with
[32:09] the word of God. And you know what Jesus
[32:12] answered back in this little this little
[32:14] drama?
[32:16] He said he said, "Judas, don't you think
[32:19] I know what I'm doing?
[32:22] And his response is, well, what am I
[32:24] what am I here for then?
[32:27] So, we see that the word that was going
[32:29] forth, the plan of God was contrary to
[32:32] his plan.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; And then you see interaction between
[32:36] Judas and Peter. And Peter says, Judas,
[32:38] don't you think he knows what he's
[32:39] doing? He says, "Yes, I I sure this and
[32:41] that." But man, he says, "You don't
[32:43] believe, do you? Trust Jesus."
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:50] But you see this, you see the little
[32:52] signs here, little signs there that he
[32:55] really didn't want to go the way the
[32:57] word was prophesied to go in that hour.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; And the thing that blew me away was
[33:04] this. They showed the Lord's supper. And
[33:07] we see John, we see John, Peter asked
[33:09] John, John, ask Jesus who it is.
[33:14] And we see they show him and John leans
[33:17] over and whispers, "Jesus, who is this?"
[33:20] And we see Jesus lean back in. We don't
[33:23] see Jesus's mouth move, but we see
[33:25] John's expression like
[33:28] And then they look at each other. Two
[33:30] omnipotents look at each other.
[33:32] The bride and the king, the bride and
[33:34] the word look at each other. And we see
[33:37] Jesus take, reach down, grab a bread. He
[33:39] break it. He dips it into the sap and he
[33:42] turns and gives this to Judas. And Judas
[33:46] looks at him like this.
[33:49] He takes the sap and he begins to eat
[33:51] it.
[33:54] And G Judas Jesus le leans over to Judas
[33:57] and says,
[34:00] you know, you don't have to stay
[34:02] anymore.
[34:07] and he lean Judas leans back and says,
[34:09] "You know, it didn't have to be like
[34:11] this."
[34:14] Then he gets up and walks out.
[34:19] The bride of Jesus Christ in this last
[34:21] day is in it all the way.
[34:28] Saints of God, if there's something you
[34:30] don't understand right now in the word,
[34:32] in this message bringing forth, put it
[34:34] on a shelf. Do not doubt the Lord Jesus
[34:36] Christ. Remember the Bible says that God
[34:38] lies not. Amen. So if there's something
[34:40] mysterious, if there's something we
[34:42] don't know, things of God, put it on the
[34:43] shelf and wait for God to reveal it to
[34:46] you. Amen. Don't question the Lord.
[34:49] Remember, Brother Ram, he he questioned
[34:50] the Lord one time and the Lord said and
[34:53] he brought a blackout on him. He says,
[34:54] "You owe me a you owe me a explanation
[34:56] on that woman, right?" And God says,
[34:58] "I'm not even talking to you." What?
[35:00] Brother had to go humble himself,
[35:02] repent, say, "Whoa, woe is me. Oh, I'm
[35:04] so sorry." And finally, God revealed to
[35:06] him what had taken place.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; You let God do what God's going to do.
[35:11] You let the Lord Jesus Christ operate
[35:14] his last move on you in this last hour.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Now, remember, blessed is the man whom
[35:19] thou choosest and it causes to approach
[35:21] unto thee. So, notice one of the things
[35:23] right here. He says, first of all, to
[35:24] come to Christ, you have to be chosen.
[35:28] You have to be there in the mind of God
[35:31] before the foundation of the world.
[35:33] Amen. And what that is also the same
[35:36] time the lamb was slain before the
[35:38] foundation of the world. So that blood
[35:40] was for you. Amen.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; He says, "Blessed is blessed is the man
[35:45] whom thou choost and causes to approach
[35:48] unto thee."
[35:50] &gt;&gt; So the chosen any chosen was out in the
[35:53] world sometime. Any of you guys are lost
[35:55] at any specific time in your lives?
[35:57] Maybe. Guess what? If you were chosen,
[36:00] he's going to cause you to what? Come
[36:03] and seek him. Amen. Right.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; I'll say like this. I just went and saw
[36:07] my fraternity brothers from college.
[36:11] Tall cap abson frat boys. They had a
[36:14] little get together. I couldn't make it
[36:15] to their big thing. But I wanted to meet
[36:16] one individual because the Lord kind of
[36:18] showed me.
[36:21] I went and met him. his name, we call
[36:23] him Jersey because he's from New Jersey,
[36:26] very simple. And I said, "Jez, this and
[36:29] this and this." He goes, "Oh, Simon," he
[36:30] goes, "Remember?" He goes, he goes,
[36:31] "Remember when you were down and out?" I
[36:34] said, "Yeah, in my testimony, there's a
[36:36] certain spot in my life where I had I
[36:38] hit rock bottom.
[36:44] God took this away and took this away
[36:47] and I found myself without all the loves
[36:50] of my life, college, my old girlfriend,
[36:53] this and that. Things of God, he caused
[36:55] me to approach him.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; But a lot of times, you have to hit rock
[37:01] bottom. You have to hit literally the
[37:02] bottom of the barrel to where if you
[37:05] scrape any further,
[37:07] you can't go any lower. Anyone ever been
[37:09] to any lower? A lot of people's low time
[37:11] is not as low as other low times, right?
[37:14] It just took me a couple things and I
[37:16] was like, I'm ready to serve the Lord. I
[37:17] don't want to go any lower. This is as
[37:19] low. This is the bottom of the barrel
[37:20] for me. Right here. This is my mark.
[37:22] Yep. I'm not going any further into sin.
[37:24] I'm starting to look up. I want to see
[37:26] where the blessings come from. Where's
[37:27] the blessing? Where is God? He's here.
[37:29] He's here. And I'll tell you what,
[37:30] thanks God. 25 years, 30 years later,
[37:32] what? Here we are. Amen. Serving the
[37:33] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So, I met my
[37:36] fraternity brother and I said I he and
[37:38] when I first met him a years ago,
[37:40] he said, "Simon, I started a podcast."
[37:43] I like, "Okay." He goes, "Eric, it's the
[37:46] name this and this and this." I he said,
[37:47] "Look it up." He said, "Just listen to
[37:48] something." I like, "Okay, I'll check it
[37:49] out." I went on his podcast. He's like,
[37:52] "Two or 300 little podcasts."
[37:56] And you know what name of one of them
[37:57] was? I clicked on it. It was named Rock
[38:00] Bottom. I was like, "That sounds like an
[38:02] interesting one. I can relate to that."
[38:04] I hit it and he was telling the story
[38:07] about me in New Jersey when I was
[38:10] sitting between him and another attorney
[38:12] brother and I told him I said this is
[38:13] the lowest I've ever been.
[38:16] Saints of God that thing was so and I
[38:18] told him I said Jersey remember he said
[38:20] and I went and I clicked on this I said
[38:21] this he said what I said yeah I said I
[38:24] said I Jersey and that was the moment I
[38:26] turned to Jesus Christ
[38:30] &gt;&gt; he said really that was it? I said yes
[38:32] absolutely. In fact, I said I was
[38:34] literally crying, laughing almost as
[38:36] you're bringing your side of the story,
[38:38] what took place. The whole thing was
[38:39] about that trip on spring break and how
[38:42] he went this this he says and oh, Simon
[38:43] was he was brokenhearted this this he
[38:45] says and he was trying to drink a beer
[38:47] this and that and this certain kind of
[38:48] place. He says he looked over he said me
[38:50] and Alvarez and he said this is the
[38:52] lowest I've ever been. And I said,
[38:54] "Guys, I hit rock bottom."
[38:57] And on the podcast, he's just laughing
[38:59] and hooping it up and pumping it up and
[39:01] this and this. They got a lot of views
[39:02] on that one. But saints of God, the
[39:05] witness that he saw right there is what
[39:07] I saw. I said, "That's the reason I'm
[39:08] here right now." Amen.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Because if you're blessed, if you're
[39:13] chosen of God, he's going to cause you
[39:15] to approach him. Amen. Anyone been there
[39:18] this morning? Amen. I've been there.
[39:20] I've been to the bottom of what he calls
[39:22] me. He drew me. Amen. To him. Amen. And
[39:25] he's drawing you right now. Saints of
[39:27] God, if you're here right now, he has
[39:29] caused you. What are what, saints of
[39:31] God? Think about all the things you
[39:33] could be in this world. Why are you here
[39:35] right now? Amen. Because God has caused
[39:37] you. Something has taken place in your
[39:40] life that has like forced you this way.
[39:43] And so the invisible, what presence, the
[39:45] hand of God, I was like a real gentle
[39:48] hand of God dwell pushing you towards
[39:50] these things. Amen.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now notice it's not for any
[39:55] reason that he chose you and he calls
[39:56] you that what we may dwell in thy
[39:59] courts." Amen. He wants you. There's I
[40:01] tell I say it like this. You can go over
[40:03] here. You can go over here. But where
[40:04] are you going to hear the word of God?
[40:08] Notice what's the point of him choosing
[40:09] you and calling you and of causing him
[40:11] to approach him if there's nowhere to
[40:13] send you.
[40:16] So where does he send you? He sends you
[40:17] to the house of God. And I'll tell you
[40:19] this, not to a denominational house, but
[40:21] what to a true house of God where you're
[40:23] going to hear the true word, the washing
[40:25] of the water by the word. And we're
[40:27] going to know what sin is. We're going
[40:28] to know what righteousness is. We're
[40:30] going to know what true holiness is, how
[40:32] to make, and how to please our husband.
[40:34] Amen.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He is faithful. He is true. He is
[40:37] God. Amen. Now, notice here in the
[40:40] approach to God, he says, "And then when
[40:42] God come down hunting for man, he says,
[40:44] I want you to notice this. It's always
[40:46] God hunting the man.
[40:52] In the early
[40:54] mid 2000s, young Malachi is born out
[40:57] from his mother's womb uh sucking on
[41:00] bottles and uh what do they call them
[41:03] things? Binkers or binkies.
[41:07] One day he starts talking. He says,
[41:08] "Lord," he said, "Mom and dad, I'm going
[41:11] to be a Christian."
[41:13] No, that was not it. Anyone just come
[41:17] out of the womb and said, "Ah, I'm born
[41:19] again. My goodness, from a child, I'm a
[41:22] proper child. I'm going to serve God all
[41:24] the way and this and this. I'm going to
[41:25] be a missionary." Uhhuh. Acious like I
[41:28] want to be a missionary. I wish Mary's
[41:31] missionary is a wife. Oh my, we want to
[41:32] go to Africa to the worst spots and
[41:34] witness Jesus Christ. Does anyone ever
[41:37] have that? Just that just But God has to
[41:39] choose you and cause you to do these
[41:42] things. And if we can yield ourselves,
[41:45] really let everything die out,
[41:47] &gt;&gt; it is time. The only way we're going to
[41:50] produce is if we die out.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; You know what I felt when I seen that
[41:54] man get killed last week? I felt like a
[41:57] I felt a surge of faith rise up and
[41:59] said, "I will die with him."
[42:04] &gt;&gt; And I wasn't thinking about him. I was
[42:06] thinking about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[42:08] Millions of our brothers and sisters
[42:10] went that way
[42:11] &gt;&gt; to the Catholic Church and to the
[42:13] Muslims and to whatever else saints of
[42:15] God to all kinds of insanity. Saints of
[42:17] God are brothers and sisters what are
[42:19] died daily
[42:21] &gt;&gt; serving the Lord Jesus Christ.
[42:24] It's always God hunting the man. He says
[42:26] not man hunting for God. Did you ever
[42:28] think of that? He says no no man at any
[42:30] time has ever at any at any age did ever
[42:33] him within himself desire to serve God.
[42:35] Never has been. His nature's against it.
[42:39] Do you see this is supernatural?
[42:41] This guy right there, that pastor right
[42:43] there, he should be in the He should
[42:44] have already been retired out of the
[42:45] NFL.
[42:48] You shouldn't even be sitting here.
[42:51] But God
[42:53] &gt;&gt; has chosen him
[42:55] &gt;&gt; to set him up not to be an NFL
[42:57] superstar. I could walk over to his
[42:59] house, his mansion, be like, "Gus, can
[43:00] you autograph my football so I can sell
[43:01] it?"
[43:03] Just little side gig. That's not it.
[43:08] But God said, "All right, son. You're
[43:10] done with foosball football."
[43:13] He was, "Chase this thing. Chase the
[43:15] word of God.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Chase this seed.
[43:19] Chase the true seed of God. See, so now
[43:21] because of that, you have a pastor right
[43:22] here."
[43:24] &gt;&gt; He says, not trying to lift. I'm just
[43:26] saying this. Look at what God does.
[43:30] one per all he has to do is get one his
[43:32] hand on one man and God can set him
[43:34] aside for this can get him set aside for
[43:36] this get him set you know one of the in
[43:38] one of the in the Isuza street revival
[43:40] they said there's actually brothers and
[43:41] sisters who are specifically gifted in
[43:44] certain situations
[43:46] &gt;&gt; there was one brother he said that he
[43:48] was gifted to pray over those that
[43:50] couldn't hear the deaf and he and one
[43:52] man one of a deaf teacher brought in 20
[43:55] and the guy said he says he took he took
[43:57] all the canes and he broke them and The
[44:00] teacher is like, "What are you doing?"
[44:01] He said, "You act like they're all
[44:02] getting healed." He said, "They are."
[44:04] &gt;&gt; And you know what? They went and prayed
[44:06] for each one. And 20 were healed in one
[44:08] meeting.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "There's another there's a
[44:11] woman who is gifted, who was anointed to
[44:14] pray over people, I believe it was, uh,
[44:16] uh, that were in wheelchairs and were
[44:18] lame, and she would pray over one after
[44:20] the other, and they would get up and
[44:21] walk."
[44:25] &gt;&gt; People say, "Oh, we're in the bride's
[44:27] revival." Um
[44:31] you know there was a time in Isuza
[44:34] Street he said and only these things
[44:36] took place at this time. There was times
[44:38] in Isuza Street in the in their building
[44:41] from the top of their building flames of
[44:44] fly fire would shoot up into heaven and
[44:46] then flames of fire would come down from
[44:48] heaven and they would touch. He says,
[44:50] and the lady said, at that time, he
[44:53] says, that's when limbs started growing
[44:55] back.
[44:58] But only at that time, only when fire
[45:01] from heaven, from earth and fire from
[45:03] heaven met,
[45:06] he said, that's when arms were restored,
[45:08] hands were restored, legs were restored.
[45:11] At that time,
[45:14] saints of God, don't you understand? You
[45:15] have a gift. Remember, those people were
[45:18] not William Seymour. Those are people in
[45:20] the revival.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; What is your gift?
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Are you gifted to pray over this and
[45:26] this or you have a gift of prophecy?
[45:27] Saints of God, this is the pastor's The
[45:30] pastor is a good thing. He's our head.
[45:31] He's the head, right? But notice, you
[45:33] are the body.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus has no other hands and feet and
[45:37] body but you. And he wants to use you
[45:39] and that kind of saints of God. Everyone
[45:41] has a testimony. Everyone has what?
[45:43] Power of God. Amen.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; We've got to get into it.
[45:48] He says, he says, uh, let me jump here.
[45:52] He says, but man never seeks God. God
[45:54] seeks man. God, his nature is holy and
[45:57] high. So, you have to be consecrated.
[46:01] We have to get addicted to the ministry.
[46:05] The book of Acts said they were addicted
[46:07] to the ministry. What is that?
[46:11] Anybody addicted to food?
[46:14] Guess what? We're addicted to air.
[46:17] You have to have it to survive.
[46:19] Addiction is something. You just heard
[46:21] the testimony of addiction a month ago,
[46:23] right? Month and a half ago. My cousin
[46:25] Adam, right?
[46:28] &gt;&gt; He lived for that fix. He lived for just
[46:32] one more line of cocaine or whatever he
[46:35] was on, whatever. Thanks to God, he was
[46:37] he sold out everything.
[46:40] his business, his wife, his children.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; That's addicted. Now to the gospel.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; He said he would forget to eat.
[46:55] How many so caught up with God said, "Oh
[46:57] my goodness, Lord, brother Pastor Jess,
[46:58] I was in so much prayer, I forgot to
[47:00] eat. Oh my goodness, I was so witnessing
[47:03] so much. I was thinking about the things
[47:04] of the Lord as I was working and I
[47:06] completely forgot to eat lunch and
[47:08] breakfast.
[47:11] Saints of God, elevate our minds
[47:14] &gt;&gt; to what? Our forefathers that caused
[47:17] revival back then. They were in revival
[47:21] back then. I'm talking fiery. Jesus is
[47:24] coming. Amen. Repent for the kingdom of
[47:26] heaven is at hand. Oh my.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; He says, "But God," he says, "Nature is
[47:32] holy and high. The man is fall in the
[47:36] fall is low and degraded." He says a man
[47:38] without God is never I guess they will
[47:39] say it isn't he's not mentally right
[47:42] without God they're not mentally right
[47:44] prophecy fulfilled here
[47:45] &gt;&gt; these people crazy they are insane these
[47:48] are the ones the prophet said he said
[47:50] they're going to walk outside and see
[47:51] ants 15 foot high they're going to see
[47:53] this what they're going to be completely
[47:55] gone
[47:57] and we're going to watch it unfold
[48:02] that's exactly right he says I can prove
[48:03] it says that a man without God is no
[48:06] more than a brute fruit animal.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Now, that sounds very deep, but I can
[48:11] prove it to you. Amen. Now, let's
[48:15] continue here by God's grace. He says,
[48:17] "Now, the way that God came for Adam to
[48:20] to approach." Now, watch. Adam made
[48:22] himself an approach. He says, "Now I've
[48:24] got to go out and meet God." So, he made
[48:26] himself an apron. He's a fig leaf to
[48:28] cover up his shame. And he found out
[48:30] that God refused that approach. And
[48:32] today, if man thinks, now here, here's
[48:34] the difference. Now man thinks now I'll
[48:37] go over and help Mrs. Jones over here.
[48:39] She's a woodw woman. She needs some
[48:41] coal. I'll give to the Red Cross or some
[48:44] charity organization out of my
[48:45] abundance. I will join the church.
[48:47] You're only making yourself an approach
[48:49] to God that God will refuse
[48:52] because it's not about works.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Though those things follow, those things
[48:57] are good. But that is not how you find
[49:00] the presence of God.
[49:03] because well Lord because I did this I
[49:05] know you're going to hear my prayer
[49:06] because I just I just helped this
[49:07] brother right here and he needed some
[49:08] plumbing done and I just went and uh
[49:10] plunged this toilet from him and got it
[49:12] going. Oh, praise the Lord. The Lord's
[49:13] with me. No, those are works
[49:19] &gt;&gt; but the way to the presence of God. Now
[49:21] God refused Adam's reproach and then God
[49:23] went and made an approach for Adam. He
[49:25] made Adam, he says an approach to him to
[49:27] himself. And by doing that, he slayed
[49:30] some sheep or something and got them
[49:31] some skins and through the blood brought
[49:34] the first approach to the world to God
[49:37] for sins. And without the shedding of
[49:40] blood, there is no remission of sins.
[49:41] That's right. Only blood can make that
[49:43] way. Saints of God, the only way you're
[49:44] going to find God is at Calvary.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Right down at the altar,
[49:52] &gt;&gt; even the altar of your heart.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Saints of God, you can go through life
[49:56] right now. You can go be driving, you
[49:58] can do this, have an evil thought. And
[50:00] there should be a prick in our heart and
[50:02] say, "Lord, forgive me." Something could
[50:05] rise up on the job and someone could
[50:06] push you, push your button or buttons.
[50:09] Anyone have buttons or just a button?
[50:11] Well, brother, I got everything covered
[50:12] except this one thing. Well, you just
[50:14] got a button. But saints of God, there's
[50:15] many other avenues the devil can work.
[50:18] We've got to thanks of God, we he has
[50:19] obligated to win that one punch, right?
[50:21] Let's keep all the rest. If your
[50:24] weakness is this or weakness is that,
[50:26] just keep it that. Just have one
[50:27] weakness if you best you can. Amen. If
[50:30] what we have three time uh the pride of
[50:31] life, the pride of of uh uh the lust of
[50:34] the flesh, lust of the eyes, right?
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; One of those. Keep all the rest covered
[50:40] and keep your eye on your weakness.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Let me say it like this. One of the
[50:46] greatest times I was ever deceived, I
[50:48] got cheated out of some money.
[50:50] And you know what? I was thinking about
[50:51] it this last month. What was the first
[50:55] thing on how that took place? How did I
[50:58] get brother Simon, you got to take it
[50:59] for money? Oh. Oh, yeah.
[51:01] You know, the first thing I noticed and
[51:04] I've heard it about snakes.
[51:06] When you're when you're in the jungles
[51:08] or whatever and
[51:10] and you you stumble around like a king
[51:12] cobra, you know what the first thing
[51:13] they're going to do? They're going to
[51:15] try and catch your eyes.
[51:19] And I noticed when this took place with
[51:20] me, I was driving and this guy drove by
[51:24] and his eyes were locked right into my
[51:26] eyes.
[51:27] In fact, so much so that my eyes
[51:29] followed. I'm like, my head was straight
[51:30] on my one.
[51:35] And I drove, I parked, here he comes
[51:37] again. And his eyes were like,
[51:41] but it was it was an act. It was
[51:44] complete act. It was a play.
[51:48] said, "Hey,
[51:49] I'm a millionaire.
[51:52] I need your help. I'm stuck in America.
[51:54] I'm trying."
[51:56] But he had to lock the eyes in because
[51:58] the eyes are the window to the soul. I
[52:01] believe that happened to me for a reason
[52:03] to for a real tough learning curve right
[52:06] there. That was a tough one. But one of
[52:08] the things you're going to if you ever
[52:10] come in contact of this last great
[52:11] deception saints, there's going to
[52:13] people come up and say, "Brother, this
[52:14] is the way and they're going to bring it
[52:17] in such a dramatic form.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; They're going to try and deceive you,
[52:22] but they've got to lock your eyes. They
[52:25] can go like this and this, but your eyes
[52:27] are going to be locked right into
[52:28] theirs." What took place with Adam and
[52:31] or sorry, Eve and that serpent? The
[52:33] first thing we see Eve looking here
[52:35] comes the serpent walking into the
[52:36] garden.
[52:38] And no doubt they locked eyes
[52:41] and he was trying to capture hers his
[52:44] attention. Wherever he moved as he's
[52:46] coming up his eyes were locked right
[52:48] onto Eve's.
[52:52] Good morning Eve. How are you? And he's
[52:55] locking into the window now bypassing
[52:59] spirit into soul.
[53:02] And then he started his deception. God
[53:05] bless you.
[53:08] Be very careful someone looks you right
[53:10] in the eyes
[53:12] without bringing the true word of God.
[53:13] In fact, saints of God, just test it.
[53:15] Give it the word test.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, that's what I that's
[53:21] what I seen right there. The first thing
[53:24] contacting those eyes, those snake eyes.
[53:27] Right now, let's continue here. He says,
[53:30] 'Now notice in John 6:44,
[53:33] he says, uh, 43, 43, 44, 45, he says,
[53:36] Jesus therefore answers and murder not
[53:37] among yourselves. He says, no man can
[53:39] come unto me except the father which
[53:40] hath uh sent me draw him
[53:44] and I'll raise him up at the last day.
[53:46] So saints of God, the only way you could
[53:48] be even drawn or even c or even hear
[53:51] this message is to be drawn of God. The
[53:54] father has to draw you. And what's the
[53:56] father, what's that indivisible
[53:57] invisible spirit going to do? He's going
[53:59] to point you to Jesus Christ. Amen.
[54:01] Because that was the that was the lamb
[54:03] of God. That was the sacrifice. That was
[54:05] the one who what bore all our burdens,
[54:07] all of our sins, took all of our
[54:09] iniquities. He was tempted in every kind
[54:11] of way that we could be tempted and yet
[54:13] without sin. Amen.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; So, he's going to point you to the
[54:16] sacrifice. This is going to take your
[54:18] place. Amen.
[54:21] I share with the brothers there at
[54:23] Malachi's thing and my pastor was
[54:26] preaching on uh on Abraham and Isaac and
[54:30] that time where God told Abraham says
[54:32] take your son he's thy only son up and
[54:35] sacrifice him and slay him. Abraham goes
[54:38] and does this and he's takes the wood
[54:39] and lays his son on there and he's about
[54:41] ready to slay him and my pastor's
[54:42] preaching this and I'm like wow this is
[54:45] I'm just just waiting waiting for
[54:46] something and then all the all of a
[54:48] sudden the Lord brought something to me.
[54:50] Uh pastor Gam's preaching he said he
[54:51] says and then the angel stopped
[54:53] Abraham's hand with a dagger with a
[54:55] knife and he looks back and sees what
[54:57] that ram with his horns caught in a
[54:59] thicket caught in humanity. This is and
[55:01] I and I and then it struck me saints
[55:06] that ram was only to take Isaac's spot.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; And the thought came, where's Ishmael?
[55:19] &gt;&gt; The sacrifice is only for Isaac's seed.
[55:24] [Laughter]
[55:26] Ishmamail's he did not lay a double
[55:28] sacrifice Isaac and Ishmael there
[55:30] otherwise ser could be saved but that
[55:33] sacrifice Jesus Christ was not for them
[55:35] even though he gives them the
[55:36] opportunity to accept it they never will
[55:38] but it was only for Isaac and the holy
[55:40] seed line amen right there saints of God
[55:42] that's predestination that's your
[55:44] original sin right there proved in
[55:46] shadow and type Ishmael had nothing to
[55:49] do with it there was nothing no part in
[55:51] fact I was telling a brother about this
[55:53] the other night I said look God had to
[55:55] raise Abraham's mentality to what the
[55:58] sea is God sees because he said go take
[56:00] thy son thy only son
[56:04] &gt;&gt; and yet out of Abraham came Ishmael
[56:08] but that was not his true son how hard
[56:11] would that be for you and I
[56:15] &gt;&gt; could we accept it if God said that
[56:17] could God could we accept it if God
[56:19] showed that see that's why our love for
[56:22] Jesus Christ has to be un
[56:25] un uh uh you can't even challenge it.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; I don't care what happens in this life.
[56:30] I am I am set aside for the Lord Jesus
[56:33] Christ and him alone. No matter what he
[56:36] would show me, it's him in me. Amen.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Not trying to be un uh uh compassionate,
[56:43] but saints of God, we we're dealing with
[56:45] scripture here. We're dealing with
[56:46] truth. Things this is not a this is not
[56:47] a joke.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; This is real life.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; I only got 20 30 years left and I'm
[56:52] done. That's how fast this thing's
[56:55] wrapping up.
[56:58] Let's continue here. I want to I want to
[56:59] get into where I'm going to go here. I
[57:00] don't know what time it is. Uh in
[57:03] uh 2 Thessalonians 2:10, he says, "And
[57:07] with all deceitfulness and
[57:08] unrighteousness in them that perish,
[57:10] because they receive not the love of the
[57:12] truth."
[57:16] Now apply that to this message.
[57:19] Are we looking at every quote of brother
[57:21] random on every topic?
[57:25] Are we just concerned about this or
[57:26] that? We have to what? But we've been
[57:29] chosen because God hath from the
[57:31] beginning chosen you to salvation
[57:33] through sanctification of the spirit and
[57:36] belief of the truth. Notice what we're
[57:39] baptized with the Holy Ghost and what
[57:40] their spirit realms completely clean and
[57:42] they believe the truth. What? And with
[57:44] that obstacle without with with that
[57:46] obstacle on, with that obstacle out of
[57:48] the way for Christ, he can express
[57:50] himself through the flesh. He can
[57:52] express himself through the individual.
[57:54] Why? Because his his he's sealed in his
[57:56] in his soul. His spirit realm is
[57:58] completely clean. And God now has free
[58:00] will to work on the flesh. And the
[58:02] control tower takes over. And you can be
[58:04] used of God.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I want to uh I want to move
[58:08] on here because I want to show you uh
[58:10] some approaches by God's grace. Let me I
[58:13] don't even know where where what time it
[58:14] is now. Let's continue here. Uh
[58:18] and I kind of wonder I came across
[58:20] across this quote here. He says now
[58:22] notice he says and we must meet God.
[58:24] This is 55 1110 the a hidden life in
[58:26] Christ. Now we must meet God upon his
[58:29] appropriated provided plan of how we
[58:31] must approach him. And if we could only
[58:33] approach him through that plan if we
[58:34] could get it right we are sure to get an
[58:36] audience with God. Does everyone want an
[58:37] audience with God?
[58:40] &gt;&gt; In fact I'll say this. If we fail to get
[58:43] an audience with God, we will perish.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; We need to break through.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Not with I hope so or I think so, but
[58:52] with a thus sayith the Lord.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; You know they had thus sayith the Lord's
[58:56] back in the revival.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; I was listening to Isuza Street. The
[59:01] lady giving the testimony of Zuza
[59:02] Street. She said at the end of 1909, 190
[59:05] after the revival died down, William
[59:08] Seymour prophesied.
[59:10] He said, "Around a hundred years from
[59:13] now, there's going to be a revival
[59:14] strike, and it's going to be greater
[59:16] than this. It's going to be like the
[59:18] book of Acts."
[59:20] And she said, "There's another man on
[59:22] the on the East Coast in New York that
[59:24] prophesied the exact same thing." Said,
[59:26] "There's going to be a revival in about
[59:28] a hundred years that's going to be
[59:30] greater than this."
[59:32] And then he said there was, she said,
[59:33] "There's another man who prophesied the
[59:35] same thing.
[59:38] There's a latter rain coming." Amen.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; The bride's revival is going to strike
[59:47] and it's going to produce beyond beyond
[59:50] what Isuza Street produced. It's going
[59:52] to be beyond what the Welsh revival
[59:54] produced in in 1857.
[59:59] That revival that struck Manhattan,
[1:00:02] you know what caused it?
[1:00:05] An economic depression.
[1:00:09] because everybody's working. Oh, I got
[1:00:11] work. Oh, brother, I got to work
[1:00:12] tonight. I'll see you later. 15 hours.
[1:00:14] Sorry. We'll shoot for tomorrow. They
[1:00:17] were working so much and then all of a
[1:00:18] sudden a depression hit. He said there
[1:00:21] childrens were thousands of children
[1:00:22] begging streets for food. The men were
[1:00:24] just sitting around doing nothing,
[1:00:26] starving, hoping. He says, "But in that
[1:00:28] idle time, there were some that started
[1:00:30] seeking God.
[1:00:33] And that brought forth revival. God had
[1:00:36] to take away all their prosperity to
[1:00:39] bring forth a revival.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; What happens if you ain't got no food
[1:00:44] tomorrow?
[1:00:46] The Lord do something. Listen to George
[1:00:50] Mueller's testimony. How many times did
[1:00:53] he have nothing? He didn't beg anyone
[1:00:55] for nothing. And over the course of his
[1:00:58] lifetime, they said that he was given
[1:01:00] $1.5 million
[1:01:03] in back in that money. God provided
[1:01:06] everything.
[1:01:07] He didn't beg. He never begged one
[1:01:09] thing. He just prayed. Alls he did was
[1:01:13] pray.
[1:01:15] He said as the first time he started
[1:01:17] praying, he said the Lord answered
[1:01:18] within he said he said a lot of them he
[1:01:20] said answered within the within the
[1:01:21] first day or two. What that do? It burst
[1:01:24] it brought his faith way up. He said
[1:01:26] God's hearing me. He's answering me like
[1:01:28] this. He said kept praying. Then he said
[1:01:30] as time went on he said then he would
[1:01:32] have to wait sometimes a year or two.
[1:01:33] Then it would have to be wait 10 years.
[1:01:35] But in that 10-year waiting, many other
[1:01:37] prayers are being answered at the same
[1:01:38] time. What? Building his faith, waiting
[1:01:40] for what? That 10-year prayer, waiting
[1:01:42] for this soul, waiting for this thing to
[1:01:44] take place that he needed to take place.
[1:01:45] Amen. He wanted to build this building
[1:01:47] for what? Uh these big for all his
[1:01:49] orphans, big orphan building, this this
[1:01:51] and he had to wait for years and years
[1:01:53] to get the money. Then he had to find
[1:01:54] Lord, where's the land? Then he had
[1:01:56] what? Get in prayer and said, "Lord,"
[1:01:58] the Lord said, "Go to this person right
[1:01:59] here." That person said, he said, "At
[1:02:02] that time, an acre was $200 per acre."
[1:02:05] He said, "Because, but as George went
[1:02:07] there, he says, the man woke up, he
[1:02:08] says, he says, George, I was expecting
[1:02:10] you, the Holy Spirit woke me up at 2 am.
[1:02:11] He said to tell me to tell to sell it to
[1:02:13] you not for 200, but for $120 an acre
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; and he had just enough money to do it.
[1:02:19] Purchased that. He hired three
[1:02:20] architects and he built the whole thing
[1:02:22] by what? Prayer. And faith in prayer.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; All you need is faith.
[1:02:28] We have to look at that isolated
[1:02:31] scriptures. We have to look at those
[1:02:32] basic scriptures and believe
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; and believe. Just simple believe. He
[1:02:38] will provide for me.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; He is not going to let me starve. He's
[1:02:42] not going to leave me for the
[1:02:43] tribulation. He's going to rapture me. I
[1:02:45] will not see death. Saints, you've got
[1:02:47] to believe this. And boy, if you don't
[1:02:50] got it now, just keep saying it until
[1:02:52] you believe it. If you don't have faith,
[1:02:54] just keep speaking faith until you got
[1:02:56] until you believe it. If you're not
[1:02:57] healed, then speak healing until you
[1:02:59] believe it. Amen.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Look at this. This is one of my one of
[1:03:04] my favorite scriptures in Jeremiah 31
[1:03:07] verse 32. Thus sayith the Lord, the
[1:03:09] maker thereof, the Lord that formed it
[1:03:12] to establish it. The Lord is the name.
[1:03:14] Call unto me and I will answer thee. Is
[1:03:17] that a lie?
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Did he lie right there? He's like, well,
[1:03:22] maybe I'll answer you. Does Do you see
[1:03:24] maybe in there? or maybe uh maybe I'll
[1:03:26] send something. He said, "No, I will
[1:03:28] answer you." He says, "And show you
[1:03:30] great and mighty things which thou
[1:03:33] knowest not."
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Does anyone know greater and mightier
[1:03:38] things than what we know right now?
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Do you know there's two other folds in
[1:03:45] the seventh seal?
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; We're going to need those. We're going
[1:03:52] to need those.
[1:03:54] Hey, what is really the third pole? I
[1:03:56] mean, what uh
[1:03:59] he said that persecution. He says we're
[1:04:01] seeing it in small forms. He but then at
[1:04:03] that time we're going to see it in what
[1:04:05] it is. But all we have to do is ask him
[1:04:08] for this.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Not a hope.
[1:04:12] But remember, faith workketh by love. Do
[1:04:15] you love him? If you love him, you know
[1:04:18] he won't lie to you. If you love him,
[1:04:20] you know he's not gonna do it something
[1:04:22] that's gonna hurt you. You're He's not
[1:04:24] gonna make it a hard way. He's gonna
[1:04:25] make it the way he's built for you to
[1:04:27] make it.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, let's continue here. I want
[1:04:31] to I want to move into this. By God's
[1:04:33] grace, let's let me I don't even know
[1:04:34] what time it is. I want to keep rolling
[1:04:36] here. By God's grace, I want to jump to
[1:04:37] something.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Um I'm gonna skip that. Let's turn to
[1:04:41] John 3. John 3:1
[1:04:45] approaching God.
[1:04:50] I want I want to tell you this morning
[1:04:52] how blessed you are.
[1:04:58] Do you know a lot of this scripture
[1:05:01] came to us
[1:05:03] because God has chosen people and he
[1:05:06] caused them to approach him. And as they
[1:05:09] approached him
[1:05:12] the word went forth and without this
[1:05:15] word saints we would be in trouble.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; And there was a man the name of the
[1:05:22] Pharisees called Nicodemus the ruler of
[1:05:24] Jew Jews. The same came to Jesus by
[1:05:26] night. Now notice why did he approach
[1:05:29] Christ
[1:05:31] and he said unto him, "Rabbi, you think
[1:05:34] you think Nicodemus went in there like,
[1:05:37] yeah, all right, Jesus, I mean, who are
[1:05:39] you? Who do you think you are and this
[1:05:41] and that and what?" He he wasn't like
[1:05:42] that.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; But something in him said, "There is
[1:05:47] something about this man. There's
[1:05:49] something about Christ."
[1:05:53] I don't know if he got on his knees. I
[1:05:56] don't know if he said, "Jesus, take us.
[1:05:57] Take a seat. Please take a seat.
[1:06:00] I want to speak to you."
[1:06:03] And this time he locked eyes with the
[1:06:05] word.
[1:06:08] This wasn't a This wasn't a serpent
[1:06:10] Pharisee, a serpent Sadducee trying to
[1:06:12] what? Trick him in his own words. But
[1:06:15] here, God could discern there was a true
[1:06:17] man with a true heart that had what? a
[1:06:19] good heart, a pure heart that wanted to
[1:06:21] know something from God. And he was
[1:06:23] approaching the almighty
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; and what does he confess? He says we
[1:06:29] know he says that thou art a teacher. So
[1:06:31] notice he came to Christ and said you
[1:06:34] are a teacher and that in saying that he
[1:06:38] declared himself as a student.
[1:06:43] Notice the approach. She says, "Now
[1:06:45] remember he said when the Holy Ghost
[1:06:46] comes, he'll lead and guide you and
[1:06:47] teach you what things and show you
[1:06:49] things to come. He will teach you these
[1:06:50] things." The same anointed that teaches
[1:06:52] you all things. Right? In first John,
[1:06:54] saints of God, approach Christ as the
[1:06:56] teacher.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Approach Christ as the savior. Any way
[1:07:00] you approach him, he's going to answer
[1:07:02] back the way you approach him.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; And as he now, I heard brother Von say
[1:07:07] one of the most powerful things I've
[1:07:08] ever heard. He said, ' Do you know how
[1:07:10] you what kind what kind of person you
[1:07:12] want to see coming into the church?
[1:07:16] This brother's like, this brother walks
[1:07:17] in. Maybe today's his first day. I know
[1:07:19] it's not. Let's pretend it is. He comes
[1:07:22] in and he sits here. He's like, "Okay."
[1:07:23] You know, word's okay. And he comes over
[1:07:25] to Pastor Jesse or this sister. Hey, God
[1:07:27] bless you, sister. This And sister uh
[1:07:29] Lena's like, "Well, hey, brother. Do you
[1:07:31] ever been baptized?" I'm good. Don't
[1:07:33] worry about it. Don't worry about it,
[1:07:34] sister. I'm talking talking to pastor
[1:07:36] now.
[1:07:39] You know what brother Ivonne said? He
[1:07:40] says, "One of the things you want the
[1:07:41] people you want to see come into your
[1:07:43] church," he says, "Have a teachable
[1:07:45] spirit."
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; They don't know everything. They're not
[1:07:49] trying to act like this and try to act
[1:07:51] like that.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Me and my pastor, brother Cam, here, we
[1:07:54] just dealt with a certain brother that
[1:07:55] come in. He's telling me about 12 books
[1:07:59] that the
[1:08:01] Freemasonry have that that are kicked
[1:08:03] out of the Bible. He's telling me about
[1:08:05] eight books that the Mormons have that
[1:08:06] are kicked out of the Bible that we need
[1:08:07] to get to this. And he's literally
[1:08:09] arguing with brother Cam. And I'm
[1:08:11] sitting there and I'm just like
[1:08:14] finally I said, "Brother, can we turn to
[1:08:16] Revelations 22?"
[1:08:18] He said, "Yeah." I said, "Let's turn to
[1:08:20] that." I said it says right here that if
[1:08:23] we add or take away anything
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; if you add those books
[1:08:31] you will go right into the tribulation
[1:08:33] the plagues that are written in this
[1:08:35] book that's the tribulation
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; now if you take away anything oh we
[1:08:38] don't need the book of John we don't
[1:08:39] need the book of Genesis then your life
[1:08:42] will be take your name will be blotted
[1:08:43] out I said when I hit that saints of God
[1:08:48] that spirit had to be quiet
[1:08:51] Hallelujah.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Saints of God come with the teachable
[1:08:54] spirit.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; I don't know everything. We don't know
[1:08:57] anything
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; is what we think. Saints of God,
[1:08:59] compared to what we should know, we're
[1:09:01] what brother said he's we're a million
[1:09:02] miles from where we should be.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; We should be getting a spiritual
[1:09:06] algebra. Brother, when it's time, speak
[1:09:07] with tongues, but don't pre don't speak
[1:09:09] with tongues when I'm when I'm when I'm
[1:09:10] preaching. It's be before or after
[1:09:12] service. If you guys are spiritual,
[1:09:13] let's get here an hour beforehand. Start
[1:09:15] get in the spirit. Bring forth a
[1:09:16] prophecy. We got some judges. We judge
[1:09:18] it. Is it good? Good. If not, wait.
[1:09:20] Let's repent. And then what then we need
[1:09:22] to get in these sort of things right
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; now. Is there things moving? Absolutely.
[1:09:25] Pastor Jesse had so many testimonies.
[1:09:26] It's powerful. Now notice here he says,
[1:09:28] "But we know that thou are a teacher
[1:09:30] come from God." He says, "For no man can
[1:09:32] do these miracles that thou doest except
[1:09:34] God be with him."
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; And because this man chose, he came out
[1:09:40] of his denominational system, he had
[1:09:42] some light in him. He was what? Probably
[1:09:44] a seed of God. He came to God, right? He
[1:09:47] came and met him. He left his
[1:09:49] organization. He did it in secret. He's
[1:09:51] But guess what? He still meant it. And
[1:09:53] because he came,
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; we have the first sermon. Thou must be
[1:09:58] born again.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; And because he came, he had enough
[1:10:04] boldness. But remember, God was drawing
[1:10:07] him and caused him something. I'll say
[1:10:09] it like this. You don't you don't doubt
[1:10:10] the man out of Israel rose up and
[1:10:12] started all these miracles and all these
[1:10:14] organizations are doing things. are like
[1:10:15] and they're having meet they're having
[1:10:16] meetings because he he acknowledged he
[1:10:19] says he says uh we know that thou
[1:10:21] knowest they were talking about him
[1:10:23] how can this guy even do this his mom
[1:10:26] and father he's a he's a he's a child of
[1:10:27] fornication how can he do this he must
[1:10:29] be a teacher sent from God how did he do
[1:10:31] these miracles how I've never heard
[1:10:33] anyone speak like that
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; something moved on his heart so much so
[1:10:39] saying that he pushed his way and had an
[1:10:40] audience with God
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; and now what we're given
[1:10:45] John 3:16,
[1:10:49] the most famous scripture in the entire
[1:10:51] history, came because a Pharisee wanted
[1:10:55] what? To hear wanted to have a council
[1:10:57] with God himself.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Don't let's not let's not
[1:11:03] try and run our denominational brothers
[1:11:04] down so much. One day they're going to
[1:11:06] come they might have a greater
[1:11:07] revelation at time. I'll tell you this.
[1:11:09] They might come to this message and have
[1:11:10] a greater revelation than you and I ever
[1:11:12] could.
[1:11:13] Because if they get desperate, they'll
[1:11:15] leave their denomination. Much like us,
[1:11:17] much like the world we live, right? And
[1:11:19] what? God's going to give us great
[1:11:20] things.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; And what for 2,000 years, these
[1:11:24] scriptures in John 3 have been blessing
[1:11:26] people and saving people for all
[1:11:28] generations.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Approaching God. But he came to him as a
[1:11:35] student,
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; thou teacher
[1:11:39] sent from God. Amen.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; And Jesus says, "You must be born again.
[1:11:46] What is this? What is he talking about?"
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; And now this great ruler in Israel, he's
[1:11:51] learning things that are just, "What are
[1:11:54] you talking? How can I go into my
[1:11:55] mother's?" Jesus said, "Son, you don't
[1:11:58] even know what you're talking about.
[1:12:01] Say to God, that's now remember this.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; This is for us." Now remember the
[1:12:09] fullness of this word is supposed to be
[1:12:10] revealed in this day.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; What else is laying here?
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; We have to seek the Lord. Notice that
[1:12:19] didn't stop, right? Whatever Jesus said
[1:12:21] to him in John 3, look what takes place
[1:12:22] in John 19.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; And after this Joseph of Arythea being a
[1:12:26] disciple of Jesus but secretly for fear
[1:12:28] of the Jews, here is a secret church
[1:12:30] believer. He secretly believed in Jesus.
[1:12:32] Yeah. He had to go through his he had to
[1:12:34] go through the way of life and this this
[1:12:35] and not know letting anyone know he even
[1:12:37] believed in Jesus.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; But be because he was a true believer.
[1:12:40] He said besought Pilate that he came and
[1:12:43] took the body of Jesus and Pilate gave
[1:12:45] him leave and he came there and took the
[1:12:46] body of Jesus and there came also
[1:12:48] Nicodemus.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Whatever Jesus said to Nicodemus in that
[1:12:53] night impacted him so much that he still
[1:12:55] believed that this was the Messiah.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; And he craved the word.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word was smoked. It was
[1:13:04] smitten. It was broken. It was beaten.
[1:13:07] It was bruised. It was a dead word. But
[1:13:08] he cared even for the dead word. Even
[1:13:12] the word that has no effect right now,
[1:13:13] it was not living. But what? He dressed
[1:13:15] it up. He He craved the very word, the
[1:13:18] body of Christ.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Beautiful.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it looks like we read the
[1:13:25] Bible and it's it's not striking us.
[1:13:28] It's not having any effect. These
[1:13:30] sermons maybe they just not having an
[1:13:31] effect. But saints of God, just keep
[1:13:32] craving that body and that spirit's
[1:13:35] going to rise up in that word again and
[1:13:36] it's going to set us on fire.
[1:13:39] It's going to set us ablaze. Amen. He
[1:13:42] says, "Then took the manner of the body
[1:13:44] and they took the body of Jesus and
[1:13:45] wound it in linen clothes with spices
[1:13:47] for as the manner of the Jews for to
[1:13:50] bury."
[1:13:51] Saints of God, these were this was a
[1:13:53] believer.
[1:13:55] And now look at the beginning of Jesus
[1:13:57] ministry and the end. And here he was.
[1:13:59] He was still in denomination
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; and what he helped in the keeping of the
[1:14:04] body of Christ. He made sure this thing
[1:14:07] was ready and per and was fulfilling
[1:14:09] prophecy putting it into a grave that
[1:14:11] was prophesied thousands of years back.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; There's more of our brothers and sisters
[1:14:16] come out of denomination.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; There's more of our brothers and sisters
[1:14:19] going to come out of the world.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Now let's continue here.
[1:14:26] John 13, seven parables, right? I know
[1:14:30] this is simple, but watch this. In verse
[1:14:32] 36, then Jesus sent the multitude away
[1:14:36] and went into the house. And the
[1:14:38] disciples came unto him, saying, Declare
[1:14:40] unto us the parable of the tears of the
[1:14:42] field.
[1:14:47] You know, Jesus was going to preach
[1:14:48] seven parables, interpret one, and just
[1:14:51] leave it good.
[1:14:54] But look at the power of approaching
[1:14:57] God.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Now they had full access to Jesus. Do we
[1:15:00] not have full access to the Holy Ghost?
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; We do. We have the exact same access.
[1:15:08] The only thing is not in the flesh now.
[1:15:10] But we have to what? Wait in wait for
[1:15:13] God in prayer.
[1:15:18] The only reason we have the
[1:15:19] interpretation of the wheat and tears is
[1:15:22] because the disciples,
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; something struck the disciples about
[1:15:26] that of all the parables, that's the one
[1:15:29] they wanted to understand.
[1:15:32] Something deep within them.
[1:15:35] Notice, and that wasn't Jesus. The word
[1:15:37] went forth and the Holy Spirit, the
[1:15:39] father started wooing on the disciples
[1:15:41] heart saying, "What does this mean? What
[1:15:44] do you know now? He's now now they
[1:15:45] caught everything he's saying. This was
[1:15:47] this was that which was spoken um in in
[1:15:50] uh dark sayings of old from the
[1:15:52] foundation of the world these secrets.
[1:15:55] But what does this one mean?
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; And then Jesus proceeded to bring forth
[1:16:00] the revelation of this.
[1:16:03] Many of their eyes opened right there of
[1:16:05] this.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we have the
[1:16:08] interpretation because brothers in the
[1:16:11] church wanted to know something deeper.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing what I'm saying? I hope
[1:16:19] you're picking up what I'm trying to
[1:16:20] say. If you could band together,
[1:16:24] there would be some great mysteries
[1:16:26] unfold,
[1:16:27] even greater than what we know right
[1:16:29] now.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; The very secrets the prophet didn't even
[1:16:35] bring. You know what said he says God
[1:16:36] doesn't show the prophets everything.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; So since the prophets's been gone for 60
[1:16:42] years,
[1:16:44] what can we glean from the Holy Spirit?
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Now whatever we glean will be exactly in
[1:16:49] the word will be exactly messaged in
[1:16:51] this message lining up.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; It won't be exactly maybe specifically
[1:16:54] taught like he taught, but I'm telling
[1:16:56] you it's going to be in the word.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; These things are going to open up before
[1:17:01] us.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, let me get to you.
[1:17:08] Well, brother, that was 12 disciples
[1:17:09] pulled on that. In Matthew 24,
[1:17:13] we'll be in closing here. Matthew 24.
[1:17:18] And as he sat upon the mount of olives,
[1:17:21] notice what it says. The disciples came
[1:17:23] unto him privately, saying, Tell us,
[1:17:27] when shall these things be, and what
[1:17:29] shall be the sign of thy coming in the
[1:17:31] end of the world? And what takes place
[1:17:34] directly after this Jesus preach is this
[1:17:38] the six seals.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; This was before they pulled this before
[1:17:46] Jesus even knew what it was because the
[1:17:49] revelation of Jesus Christ didn't come
[1:17:50] all the way until 696 AD or 98 AD when
[1:17:54] it was given to John.
[1:17:56] But by because what his disciples came
[1:17:58] they said Lord in other words tell me
[1:18:01] about the end time.
[1:18:04] What's that word? Tell me about
[1:18:05] esquetology.
[1:18:08] Tell me about the end time things. How's
[1:18:10] this all going to work out? And Christ
[1:18:12] gives him the first six seals.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, and I'll give you another
[1:18:16] sign. When you see that fig tree
[1:18:18] blooming,
[1:18:21] but remember, heavens and earth will
[1:18:23] pass away, but my word shall never pass
[1:18:25] away. Amen.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; He put emphasis on the word. Amen. And
[1:18:30] then he goes into what the last three
[1:18:31] parables,
[1:18:34] wise and foolish virgin.
[1:18:37] Had not these disciples,
[1:18:39] had not the hol Okay,
[1:18:42] brother, that was 12 strong men anointed
[1:18:47] the future apostles of the New
[1:18:49] Testament. Turn to Mark 13:3.
[1:18:53] Mark 13:3.
[1:18:55] Brother, how are we going to get
[1:18:56] Malachi, brother Malachi, these three
[1:18:58] brothers right here, brother Jose, that
[1:19:01] brother, brother, brother Vang, brother
[1:19:03] Jess. How are we going to get all of our
[1:19:04] all of us together? And this brother
[1:19:06] here, how are we going to get all the
[1:19:07] all of us together to do this?
[1:19:13] Matthew 13:3, sorry, Mark 13:3. And as
[1:19:17] he was sat upon the Mount of Olives over
[1:19:18] against the temple, Peter, James, and
[1:19:22] John,
[1:19:24] and Andrew,
[1:19:26] only four
[1:19:29] of the 12,
[1:19:31] only four brothers had any interest in
[1:19:33] the end times.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Faith, hope, and love. And then Faith's
[1:19:40] brother. Wait, no. Love's brother,
[1:19:43] Andrew,
[1:19:45] or Howard was
[1:19:49] It only took four brothers
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; to get into a praying atmosphere, to get
[1:19:54] into an approach atmosphere, to get into
[1:19:57] a spot where they could approach Christ
[1:19:58] in such a way.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Matthew knew nothing about this. Maybe
[1:20:04] they heard it, but alls I know is four
[1:20:06] brothers were hungering to know the
[1:20:09] deeper things of God.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. of the entire
[1:20:13] spectrum of of of disciples only four.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; See, it doesn't take many.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; At the last supper,
[1:20:25] there was only two involved. Peter,
[1:20:29] John, ask Jesus.
[1:20:34] John askked Jesus. There's faith moving
[1:20:37] to love. And love says, "Jesus, who is
[1:20:40] it?"
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; It only took two brothers to find out
[1:20:45] the faults.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; The seed of discrepancy only took two.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; God's not a god of numbers.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; He's a God of quality.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; If he can get one man, two men in his
[1:20:59] hand, two will chase 10,000, one man a
[1:21:02] thousand, two chase 10,000. See, he
[1:21:04] multiplies.
[1:21:07] And what do we get? We get all these
[1:21:09] mysteries unfolding to us.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; In closing, saints,
[1:21:17] look at this. Revelations 1:1.
[1:21:28] Now the word is finished.
[1:21:31] We can't add anything or take away.
[1:21:34] But the but St. Paul called this Bible
[1:21:37] the unsearchable riches of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:40] You mean we can if the Lord Terry
[1:21:43] another hundred years saints of God, our
[1:21:45] grandchildren, our children's children
[1:21:46] will know things we know nothing about
[1:21:48] revelation wise. They'll taste wine
[1:21:51] we've never tasted.
[1:21:53] They've had stimulation of revelation.
[1:21:55] Saints of God you you and I might not
[1:21:57] even know about.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; But
[1:22:01] look here in Revelations 1:1. the
[1:22:03] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:22:04] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[1:22:06] things which must shortly come to pass
[1:22:08] and he sent signified by his angel and
[1:22:09] to his servant John right now why was
[1:22:12] John there look at John Revelations 1:9
[1:22:15] I John who also am your brother and
[1:22:19] companion and tribulation in the kingdom
[1:22:22] and patience of Jesus Christ was in the
[1:22:24] aisle that is called Patmas for the word
[1:22:27] of God and for the testimony of Jesus
[1:22:29] Christ
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; there was one last book to be scribed.
[1:22:34] There was one last thing, one last book
[1:22:36] called the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:22:41] And we needed this book.
[1:22:44] This book is only understood by us in
[1:22:47] this day. Do we get that?
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; You are the only generation or since the
[1:22:54] 60s that know what this these things are
[1:22:56] meaning. They have the true
[1:22:57] interpretation.
[1:22:59] But how did it come? Well, brother Sy,
[1:23:01] the Bible says, look what John says. He
[1:23:03] was in there for what? He was trying to
[1:23:04] gather the word. He was trying to write
[1:23:06] compile all these letters and get them
[1:23:09] into a book and for the testimony of
[1:23:11] Jesus Christ. He was still preaching.
[1:23:13] But look what the prophet gives us
[1:23:14] little insight.
[1:23:17] Brother Bam's dealing with John now. And
[1:23:19] that's the reason Patmas vision 120460.
[1:23:22] And that's the reason they put him out
[1:23:23] there. Why was he on the aisle? They
[1:23:25] thought he was dangerous to be among the
[1:23:27] society. But he was only carrying out
[1:23:30] the will of God. And God had a purpose
[1:23:32] under all that condition.
[1:23:35] Do you want to do you want to understand
[1:23:36] the deeper things? Look what took place
[1:23:39] here.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; God could not use him in all the
[1:23:44] persecutions and things. So notice the
[1:23:47] condition before the revelation, before
[1:23:49] he was on the island. Remember Jesus
[1:23:51] said, "I'm coming back." The angels,
[1:23:52] they saw all the two angels said, "The
[1:23:54] way he left is the way he's coming."
[1:23:56] Amen.
[1:23:58] And now notice Peter's already martyed.
[1:24:00] James is martyed. All the us the rest of
[1:24:03] the apostles are martyed. John is
[1:24:04] getting older. And now notice the
[1:24:07] antichrist spirits trying to notice
[1:24:09] Ephesus had already fallen. The
[1:24:11] antichrist spirit was in. The nickelens
[1:24:14] were in.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; The persecution was rolling. But because
[1:24:17] of the pressures of the church,
[1:24:22] there was persecution over here. This
[1:24:24] brother's wavering. This sister's
[1:24:25] waving. They're coming. Look what look
[1:24:27] what look what the prophet says.
[1:24:29] Causing the saints was coming because
[1:24:32] the saints was coming. Oh, brother John,
[1:24:36] what will we do about this? And what
[1:24:38] will we do?
[1:24:40] The people from John's church in Ephesus
[1:24:42] were coming to him saying, "John,
[1:24:45] what are we going to do? I thought Jesus
[1:24:47] was coming.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; What are we going to do? We're going to
[1:24:51] all die. There's going to be no
[1:24:53] Christians left.
[1:24:55] Rome is going to persecute everything.
[1:24:57] The Jews are going to kill everybody.
[1:24:59] We're all dying. And John's over here
[1:25:02] dealing with this, dealing with this,
[1:25:03] dealing with this. Where? And he's like,
[1:25:05] "Lord, what do we do?" And God had to
[1:25:07] anoint the Roman Empire. What? To take
[1:25:10] him and try and kill him. They could not
[1:25:12] boil him in oil. So they sent him out on
[1:25:14] the island. And that's exactly where God
[1:25:16] wanted him.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:25:19] So notice, it wasn't necessarily for
[1:25:22] John,
[1:25:23] but because the people in the church,
[1:25:26] they were so hungry, saying, "Lord,
[1:25:29] where are we at?
[1:25:31] How much longer do we have?" And God had
[1:25:36] to take John out into the island
[1:25:39] with all these snakes and with all these
[1:25:42] heathens and all these criminals so that
[1:25:45] John could get aside by himself,
[1:25:49] get in the spirit of God and the last
[1:25:52] portion, the last puzzle piece of the
[1:25:54] Bible would be given at that time.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; And it only took one man.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:03] But that one man was for many people.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Saints of God, look at everything that
[1:26:08] has been given to us is because people
[1:26:10] have sought God.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; You know why? When we come into the
[1:26:14] message, we heard about service because
[1:26:16] God sent a prophet.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Because it was time to what? Prepare a
[1:26:20] bride.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Saints of God, we're not lifting up
[1:26:24] ministers. We're lifting up Jesus
[1:26:26] Christ.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; There is a perfect purpose for
[1:26:30] everything. So, saints of God, I want to
[1:26:31] encourage you as we stand
[1:26:37] in this last move
[1:26:41] at the coming of the Lord
[1:26:44] in the church age book. What does the
[1:26:45] prophet say us? Let me just read this as
[1:26:47] in closing.
[1:26:49] You will recall that I mentioned at the
[1:26:52] beginning of this message that this book
[1:26:53] we are studying is the actual revelation
[1:26:55] of Jesus himself in the church and his
[1:27:00] works in future ages. Then I mentioned
[1:27:02] that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[1:27:04] revelation. See brother I listen to
[1:27:06] tapes. My pastor preaches all the time.
[1:27:10] But it has to be revealed to us.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; This has to be fully revealed to us.
[1:27:19] He says, "Then I mentioned it takes the
[1:27:20] Holy Spirit to give us the revelation or
[1:27:23] we will fail to get it."
[1:27:26] There's a last move coming. Bringing
[1:27:29] these two thoughts together, you will
[1:27:30] see that it won't take just ordinary
[1:27:32] study. Well, brother, I read my Bible. I
[1:27:34] I pray. I listen to tapes. It's not
[1:27:36] going to take ordinary study.
[1:27:44] He says to bring he says to bring these
[1:27:46] things it will not take ordinary study
[1:27:48] and make and thinking to make this book
[1:27:50] real.
[1:27:51] It's going to take the operation of the
[1:27:53] Holy Ghost. That means this book cannot
[1:27:55] be revealed to anyone but a special
[1:27:57] class of people. You know Nicodemus was
[1:28:00] a special class of people. The disciples
[1:28:03] were special class of people.
[1:28:06] You know in the in the time when Jesus
[1:28:07] was born brother said there was what six
[1:28:09] believers Mary Joseph
[1:28:12] uh Zachchariah his wife the prophet
[1:28:15] Santa then there's one other guy there
[1:28:17] were six true believers those were a
[1:28:19] special class that could what receive
[1:28:21] that what Jesus Christ is born is going
[1:28:23] to be born in a virgin
[1:28:26] he said that means this book can't be
[1:28:28] revealed to anyone but a special class
[1:28:30] of people
[1:28:32] it will take one with a prophetic
[1:28:35] insight
[1:28:36] even after the prophet's gone. Yes,
[1:28:40] it will require the ability to study for
[1:28:43] 12 hours a day. Let's say that it will
[1:28:46] require the ability to to memorize every
[1:28:48] quote, to memorize every scripture. It
[1:28:51] will require the ability to hear from
[1:28:53] God.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; But we've got to have the approach. Come
[1:28:57] to him as a student. Come to him as a
[1:28:59] wife.
[1:29:02] He says it will require supernatural
[1:29:05] instruction.
[1:29:07] Not just a student comparing verse with
[1:29:08] verse, though that is good. But a
[1:29:12] mystery requires the teaching of the
[1:29:14] spirit or it never becomes clear.
[1:29:19] So if there's anything you're hearing
[1:29:20] that's a little bit hazy or there's a a
[1:29:23] dark cloud or some uh you're in the fog,
[1:29:25] saints of God, just seek the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:28] Yes, sir.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Seek the one that inspired the very
[1:29:32] writing of this book. If you seek the
[1:29:34] one that wrote the book, he knows
[1:29:36] exactly what he meant when he penned it.
[1:29:39] Jesus knew exactly what he meant when he
[1:29:41] said it. Amen. You can have confidence
[1:29:43] in that. He says, "But a mystery
[1:29:46] requires a teaching of the spirit or
[1:29:48] never becomes clear how we need to hear
[1:29:50] from God." He says, "And to lay
[1:29:52] ourselves open." What's laying? It's a
[1:29:55] humbling. It's a humiliating hum
[1:29:58] a humiliating time and become yielded to
[1:30:02] the spirit to hear
[1:30:05] and know.
[1:30:07] Do you want that? It's time we lay down
[1:30:11] everything.
[1:30:14] After I was listening to your revival, I
[1:30:16] know exactly what I need to lay down in
[1:30:18] my life.
[1:30:24] The one thing Abram had to lay Abraham
[1:30:27] had to lay down was his son. He loved
[1:30:29] his son. He didn't ask him to bring
[1:30:31] Sarah up there,
[1:30:33] but this promised son that he longed for
[1:30:35] for a hundred years.
[1:30:38] This is my boy.
[1:30:42] Remember, Brother Jesse, every time
[1:30:43] Sister Kristen got pregnant, boy, boy,
[1:30:45] boy, girl, praise the Lord, we got a
[1:30:47] girl. But when Malachi Malachi
[1:30:53] Zia,
[1:30:54] that's just something with the the dad,
[1:30:56] right?
[1:30:59] Nothing. Sisters are great. The
[1:31:01] daughters are amazingly sweet honeys.
[1:31:05] But God wants us to come in contact so
[1:31:08] he can display. Saints God, he will be
[1:31:11] so pleased when we perform these things
[1:31:14] to where he will answer back.
[1:31:18] We cannot quit until we get an audience
[1:31:22] with God. Do never become satisfied in
[1:31:25] this condition.
[1:31:27] When have I when have I heard from the
[1:31:28] Holy Spirit in the last two years, year,
[1:31:31] six months, yesterday? Do we hear? Are
[1:31:33] we hearing from the Holy Spirit like
[1:31:35] they did in the revival days?
[1:31:39] Remember that brother from the Welsh? He
[1:31:42] met with God for three months every
[1:31:44] night. He was taken, say thanks to God,
[1:31:47] he was taken into heaven before the Lord
[1:31:51] Jesus to prepare himself for the
[1:31:54] revival.
[1:31:56] And they commune for two to three hours
[1:31:58] a night for three months every night.
[1:32:03] Forget what you think desperation is,
[1:32:07] what you think it is. Forget what you
[1:32:08] think uh uh being approached. Praise
[1:32:10] God. We have to get to that level.
[1:32:13] It's still possible. The lamb is still
[1:32:16] on the throne.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; He is still He's waiting for us to get
[1:32:20] that yielded.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; And I'll say it like this. I don't know
[1:32:24] of anyone else in that revival that did
[1:32:25] that. It takes one person.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; God would usually deal with what? One
[1:32:31] person at one time.
[1:32:34] Three months he spoke face to face with
[1:32:37] God, asking him questions, knowing God.
[1:32:41] He had to know God like Moses knew him
[1:32:44] to bring that kind of revival.
[1:32:46] He had to look into the eyes of the of
[1:32:48] the of the eternal one and ask him in
[1:32:51] that presence where John felt and
[1:32:53] fainted and almost felt as dead. He was
[1:32:56] in that presence but he was so humble.
[1:32:59] What kind of person must he been like?
[1:33:02] What kind of person was he
[1:33:05] that God said come up here and talk with
[1:33:07] me?
[1:33:09] come up hither like John.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; But what? He was hungry. He sought the
[1:33:15] Lord Jesus Christ. Musicians, if you
[1:33:18] come up, saints of God, don't stop till
[1:33:21] you get there.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Remember, it's still possible. You know
[1:33:26] what what the end of the end of
[1:33:28] Mueller's testimony was? He said, "A lot
[1:33:30] of people think I'm a special person or
[1:33:32] I'm a special man." He said, "No, this
[1:33:35] faith that I have is available to
[1:33:38] everyone."
[1:33:40] He said, "I am nothing special. This is
[1:33:43] Jesus Christ."
[1:33:46] Well, brother Sai Mueller's this and
[1:33:48] Finn's this and no, no,
[1:33:53] there is no great ones.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; All of you sons and daughters of God
[1:33:58] have this potential inside of you right
[1:34:01] now.
[1:34:04] But we have to do it. It's good to hear
[1:34:07] these things. It's good to see these
[1:34:09] things. But there's come to a spot where
[1:34:10] we have to perform it.
[1:34:14] The tribulation is just months and
[1:34:16] years, months or weeks or whatever way.
[1:34:18] It's still coming. Saints of God, death
[1:34:21] is still coming.
[1:34:24] The Philistines are among us. What What
[1:34:27] Chiniki say? 1850s. The Jesuits already
[1:34:31] had New York. Chicago and LA, they
[1:34:33] already had them back 100 plus years
[1:34:35] ago. 200 plus years ago almost
[1:34:38] they have everything in line. This thing
[1:34:40] is a giant worldwide trap. The prophet
[1:34:43] said we had better get we better find
[1:34:46] the true approach and go through the
[1:34:49] blood of Jesus Christ. Start right there
[1:34:51] at Calvary. Say, Lord, thank you for
[1:34:54] dying for me. Take communion. Do this in
[1:34:57] remembrance. Not of what he's doing. Not
[1:34:59] at the not he didn't say do this in
[1:35:00] remembrance of what I'm going to do in
[1:35:02] the future at the rapture. He always
[1:35:04] pointed back to Calvary. The point was
[1:35:06] not to the future. It was point to right
[1:35:08] here when I died for your sins. When I
[1:35:10] gave my body when I when I purchased
[1:35:12] you.
[1:35:13] Go back to that right there. Start right
[1:35:15] there. Let's bow our heads. Saints of
[1:35:19] God. If you need prayer, we'd be more
[1:35:20] than happy to pray for you.
[1:35:24] If you have an aquest request a silent
[1:35:27] request an unspoken just raise your hand
[1:35:31] or if you need anything
[1:35:35] Lord Jesus Lord this was the thought you
[1:35:37] gave me
[1:35:39] and Lord look at what all we have been
[1:35:42] given
[1:35:44] because you sought Moses. Moses never
[1:35:47] sought you. But then when you sought
[1:35:50] Moses, Moses fell deeply in love with
[1:35:52] you. And Lord, then from that point,
[1:35:55] Lord, he wanted a conference with you.
[1:35:57] And time and time again, you would draw
[1:35:59] him and call him into your presence. And
[1:36:01] look, we have five books because of one
[1:36:03] man being hunted down. And Lord Jesus,
[1:36:07] you gave him the revelation. And then
[1:36:09] now look at what we have in the New
[1:36:10] Testament, Lord. And what you did with
[1:36:12] Nicodemus and uh Peter, James, and John,
[1:36:15] Lord.
[1:36:17] Look at all this. Look at the mind of
[1:36:19] God. The things you shared and the
[1:36:20] secrets, Lord, you gave to these, Lord.
[1:36:23] And Lord, they didn't just give them for
[1:36:25] for them, Lord. You gave them for us as
[1:36:27] well. But Lord,
[1:36:30] we can't add to the word now, Lord. Now,
[1:36:32] it's time, Lord, to catch the full
[1:36:34] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:36] Lord Jesus, we want to know you in a
[1:36:38] greater way. And Lord, as our as Pastor
[1:36:42] Jesse Lord wrote a book about the 12
[1:36:44] mysteries and how one of the mysteries
[1:36:46] is finding the very will of God for your
[1:36:48] life.
[1:36:50] Lord George Mueller found the will of
[1:36:52] God for his life.
[1:36:55] Mr. Seymour, Lord, found the will of God
[1:36:57] for his life. And Lord Jesus, Lord, the
[1:37:00] one in uh the Welsh revival, Lord, the
[1:37:02] ones in Manhattan revival, Lord, and all
[1:37:04] the other revivals, Lord, you had a man
[1:37:06] that was ordained, God, to catch these
[1:37:07] things, Lord, to catch the mind of God
[1:37:09] and to lead the people, God, into the
[1:37:11] presence of of you, Lord, your presence,
[1:37:13] Lord. We love you. And Lord God, we ask,
[1:37:15] Lord, you work on their hearts, Lord,
[1:37:17] just like you said you would. Draw them,
[1:37:20] Lord. May you put such a spirit of
[1:37:21] prayer upon us today,
[1:37:24] Lord, that we will run to the closet,
[1:37:27] Lord, that we can't get wait to get out
[1:37:28] of the presence of our loved ones and
[1:37:30] come and pray to you, Lord. God, we're
[1:37:32] Lord, we're even reading the Bible,
[1:37:34] Lord. We need to get we need to talk
[1:37:35] with you, Lord. Your word's great, but
[1:37:37] Lord, we need spirit and power, God. We
[1:37:39] need spirit and word, Lord. Lord, we
[1:37:42] want to come in conference, Lord, with
[1:37:45] you, your presence, Lord. And Lord, if
[1:37:48] we could just get like that brother in
[1:37:51] in Wales, Lord, you called him up for
[1:37:54] three months and spoke to him, Lord. And
[1:37:57] Lord God, we still believe it's
[1:37:58] possible, Lord. Lord, I believe, Lord,
[1:38:01] it's even more possible for us, Lord,
[1:38:03] with this revelation. But you said to
[1:38:05] whom much given, much is required. It'll
[1:38:07] take a greater sacrifice in this day.
[1:38:09] Lord, we love you. Bless the people,
[1:38:11] God. Lord, you saw their hearts. You saw
[1:38:13] their hands. Lord God, answer their
[1:38:15] prayers, God. draw them into thy
[1:38:17] presence. Woo them, Lord God, in the
[1:38:20] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. We love you.
[1:38:23] Saints of God, we hope that you've heard
[1:38:25] from the Lord this morning.
[1:38:31] You know, God can use a sister to catch
[1:38:33] a revelation that will set the brothers
[1:38:35] on fire.
[1:38:39] I heard that there's a sister over in
[1:38:42] Lraine
[1:38:43] that was reading the Bible
[1:38:46] and the Lord showed her uh Lot and her
[1:38:48] his two daughters. Well, how can
[1:38:50] anything good come out of Moab? And here
[1:38:52] we see Ruth come out of it. And because
[1:38:55] God allowed that interaction between Lot
[1:38:58] and his daughters to bring forth a Ruth.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; That nugget, that revelation came from a
[1:39:05] sister reading the word of God and God
[1:39:08] just dropped the golden nugget right
[1:39:10] there and she's like swapped it up and
[1:39:12] she what? Started sharing it with the
[1:39:13] brothers just like the woman at the
[1:39:15] well. Come see this revelation God gave
[1:39:17] me.
[1:39:19] Praise God. Because what? If God gives
[1:39:21] you something, it's not necessarily for
[1:39:23] you, but it's for all of us. Amen. We
[1:39:26] hope you're blessed this morning.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; May God bless you. Just skip RS around.
