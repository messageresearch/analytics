[14:31] on we will do parts of the video so
[14:33] we'll have to watch the volume again on

[15:14] I'll read the beginning and that we can
[15:16] all read this last part alone I'm sorry
[15:19] together rather howbeit when he the
[15:20] Spirit of Truth has come he will guide

[15:32] he will show you things to come amen may
[15:36] God as busing the reading of his word
[15:37] you may be seated god bless you so we
[15:44] like to look at this thought here
[15:46] tonight about thus saith the Lord for
[15:48] the future and we'll review just briefly
[15:52] very briefly I want to be mindful of the
[15:56] time last week I think I preached a
[15:58] whole hour I didn't mean to preach that
[16:00] whole hour and okay let me just get it
[16:03] on yeah it's showing the wrong thing
[16:07] there I said I want what it's not what I
[16:09] want to see there so forgive me okay
[16:15] that's what I think we need to do
[16:23] well I guess we have to deal with that
[16:25] I'm not sure what happened here so
[16:27] anyways welcome again nice to have our
[16:30] visitor with us Alice we appreciate her
[16:31] coming back by the grace of the Lord and
[16:34] we like to look at thus saith the Lord
[16:36] for the future last week we looked at
[16:39] the stay at the Lord for today and there
[16:43] was about 79 or 80 some views on that on
[16:45] YouTube so that was nice to see that
[16:48] some people are watching and our job is
[16:51] to scatter as much seed as we can we
[16:55] cannot give the increase God must give
[16:57] the increase but our job is to scatter
[16:59] the seed and so that's how I felt led
[17:02] you know to reintroduce or reap reach
[17:05] these foundational doctrines that
[17:07] someone out there and even in internet
[17:10] land will be able to hear the word of
[17:12] God and be blessed by the truth of God's
[17:14] Word and trust as we saw last week come
[17:18] into a real spiritual relationship with
[17:21] Jesus Christ that's what we want to see
[17:22] happen by the grace of the Lord so let's
[17:26] look at let's all just briefly review
[17:28] last week we looked at thus saith the
[17:30] Lord for today and so we saw how we went
[17:35] through numerous doctrines that people
[17:38] need to honor today according to the say
[17:40] at the Lord
[17:40] we found America's destiny which we'll
[17:43] look at a little more tonight but they
[17:45] need to know that for today that America
[17:47] as a whole will not come back to God
[17:50] America will receive the mark of the
[17:52] beast according to Revelation 14 verse 8
[17:56] every nation will take the mark of the
[17:58] beast every nation will be deceived so
[18:00] when people try to tell us that America
[18:03] will be revived and come back to God we
[18:05] know that's not going to happen that's
[18:08] wishful thinking but that's not going to
[18:10] happen according to the Bible in
[18:12] Revelation 14 8 also it was thus saith
[18:15] the Lord that we must dress in modest
[18:18] apparel because those who dress
[18:21] immodestly will answer the day of
[18:22] judgment for seducing others and causing
[18:26] them to lust
[18:27] that's according to 1st Timothy 2:9 and
[18:31] also Matthew chapter 5 where Jesus said
[18:33] if you if a man looks upon a woman and
[18:35] lust
[18:37] he's already committed adultery in his
[18:38] heart with her so they're both in it
[18:41] together if she presents herself
[18:43] immorally and he thinks immoral thoughts
[18:46] they're both guilty and so that's thus
[18:49] saith the Lord that's the Word of God
[18:51] hair length we know that women should
[18:53] have long uncut hair as long as God will
[18:55] let them grow it out God's not looking
[18:57] for a certain length like 12 inches or
[18:59] 24 inches he's not looking for that he's
[19:02] looking just for long uncut hair and for
[19:05] men he's looking for men to cut their
[19:06] hair and look like a man if he grows it
[19:09] long it's a shame unto God and so we
[19:13] must honor God as long hair long uncut
[19:16] uncut hair represents that a woman is
[19:19] under full submission to her head which
[19:22] is her husband and then her husband's
[19:25] under the headship of Jesus Christ and
[19:27] Christ is under the headship of God we
[19:29] know Christ and then God also we know
[19:33] the Bible says only men should preach
[19:35] the gospel and that's according to 1st
[19:37] Timothy 2:12 that's thus saith the Lord
[19:40] for today so we're grateful to know that
[19:43] also we know it's thus saith the Lord
[19:45] that we need to be baptized in the name
[19:47] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[19:50] according to acts 2:38 and acts 19:5
[19:53] also we saw the identity of the mother
[19:57] harlot which was the Roman Catholic
[19:59] Church and the daughter so any
[20:01] denominational Church or
[20:02] non-denominational Church that holds the
[20:05] same doctrines as the Roman Catholic
[20:07] Church and denies the Word of God would
[20:11] be the daughters of the mother harlot
[20:13] and will thus be judged and that's a
[20:16] very serious topic very personal topic
[20:19] but it's thus saith the Lord so we don't
[20:21] argue with that we don't get upset with
[20:23] that we just accept it and then we do
[20:26] what we must do to get in a real church
[20:28] or church that preaches the truth of God
[20:30] amen and we also looked at the mark of
[20:34] the beast last week and we saw that it
[20:37] is joining into this world religious
[20:41] system that will ultimately control
[20:43] finances and everything about the lives
[20:47] of people on the earth so it's going to
[20:49] be a religious Union
[20:50] or organization okay so let's look at
[20:54] the Scriptures for tonight by God's
[20:56] grace so thus saith the Lord for the
[21:00] future so God has told us a lot about
[21:02] the future and let's look at this here I
[21:06] believe and I made a video on this you
[21:09] can watch the whole video I think it's
[21:10] like 15 minutes but God has told us
[21:14] about the advances in science that are
[21:16] going to happen especially with
[21:17] driverless cars God has told us in fact
[21:20] God's prophet brother RAM told us this
[21:22] will be this is the part of the vision
[21:24] that was the head of it or this was the
[21:27] very height of technology in other words
[21:29] brother Branham saw driverless cars on
[21:32] beautiful highways so that's that's the
[21:36] very height of the advances in science
[21:38] so that's what we know we're looking for
[21:41] that mark of the beast will seem a
[21:44] little more about that America will take
[21:46] the mark of the beast we'll look at the
[21:48] Destiny of the United States again we'll
[21:50] see more about that we'll look at the
[21:52] Destiny of Rome and Vatican we have
[21:54] prophecy about that and then we have
[21:55] prophecy for the reassurance for true
[21:58] Christians so we have all these
[22:00] prophecies that we'll watch and we'll
[22:01] listen to brother Branham God's prophet
[22:04] speak them with us say at the Lord so I
[22:07] believe now I'll probably switch over
[22:09] here and we'll begin watching about the
[22:13] driverless cars but if you have your
[22:14] Bible you can go to Daniel 12:4 and we
[22:18] see this as kind of an indirect prophecy
[22:20] of what we're going to hear brother
[22:22] Branham say where the Bible says
[22:24] knowledge will be increased the Bible
[22:26] says the end times will have an
[22:28] increasing of knowledge we see it with
[22:30] the internet we see it with all the
[22:34] technology and the Prophet foresaw that
[22:39] the very height of this technology would
[22:41] be cars that drive themselves so daniel
[22:44] chapter 12 verse 4 and I'm gonna read it
[22:52] like I said because the live streamers
[22:53] can't read it or can't hear it if you
[22:54] read it so I'm gonna read it I like when
[22:57] you read it but I'm doing it for the
[22:59] live streamers but Thou O Daniel shut up
[23:01] the words and seal the book even to the
[23:03] time of the end
[23:04] many shall run to and fro and knowledge
[23:06] shall be increased okay so we see an
[23:10] increasing of knowledge and we see men
[23:13] and women I'm sorry we see many people
[23:15] running to and fro and so we get an idea
[23:17] that this is through transportation and
[23:19] travel so let me in a a switch over this
[23:24] video here so we can watch and listen to
[23:27] brother Branham as he preaches it okay
[23:29] good so the volume is pretty good okay
[23:31] so I'm skipping ahead to one minute and
[23:34] 45 seconds okay so here we go
[23:37] and this will start talking about
[23:38] driverless cars what brother Ram said to
[23:47] the authoritative phrases thus saith the
[23:50] Lord and in the name of the Lord just as
[23:53] the Bible teaches in James 5 10 and
[23:55] judges 6 8
[23:58] we begin with advances in science
[24:00] driverless cars in 1958 William Branham
[24:07] shared and recorded a prophecy he
[24:09] originally spoke back in 1933 before the
[24:12] end of the world there would be
[24:13] driverless cars in a type of shape they
[25:00] look like an e the BTCC
[25:05] that will be
[25:09] [Music]
[25:16] we Branum summarize the prophecy about
[25:19] self-driving cars and wrote about this
[25:21] in 1965 the fourth vision showed the
[25:25] great advances in science that would
[25:27] come after the Second World War it was
[25:30] headed up in the vision of a plastic
[25:32] bubble top car that was running down
[25:35] beautiful highways under remote control
[25:38] so that people appeared seated in this
[25:40] car without a steering wheel and they
[25:43] were playing some sort of a game to
[25:45] amuse themselves an exposition of the
[25:47] seven churches 1965 page 321 without a
[25:54] doubt we can easily see how this
[25:56] prophecy is in the process of coming to
[25:58] pass if you pay attention to the news
[26:01] you will recall that numerous car
[26:03] manufacturers and other companies like
[26:06] Google are putting lots of time and
[26:08] resources into creating driverless cars
[26:11] this prophecy is soon to come to pass
[26:15] all right we'll pause right there okay
[26:17] so we saw the vision brother branham
[26:21] said he said the vision of advances in
[26:22] science was headed up in a driverless
[26:25] car on beautiful highways now a few
[26:28] years ago we saw an article I think it
[26:29] was last year and one of the one of the
[26:32] CEOs of Google I guess there's two guys
[26:34] that started Google one of them said our
[26:36] goal is to have Google cars
[26:38] I'm sorry driverless cars by 2020 so my
[26:41] 16 year old son when he turned 16 in
[26:43] 2020
[26:44] he doesn't have to drive he can just buy
[26:46] a driverless car so that's his goal we
[26:49] know his goals in two more years to have
[26:52] it on the roads and I don't know if you
[26:54] saw this year though but a goober car
[26:56] that was driverless crashing and it hit
[26:59] a person because the gentleman wasn't
[27:01] paying attention so there may be some
[27:04] delay in that but I'm just letting you
[27:05] know it seems like science is really
[27:07] advancing trying to get this to come to
[27:09] pass and a prophet of God saw that this
[27:12] was the very height of technology and
[27:14] there we have a couple quotes or brother
[27:16] branham says we have the technology
[27:18] we're just rating weighting on the road
[27:20] system so we all see it when we drive
[27:23] around
[27:24] talk about all the time wow these are
[27:25] beautiful highways or the highways are
[27:26] just getting better and better so we
[27:28] know it has to happen the United States
[27:30] we need better highways the technology's
[27:32] not quite there but it's getting there
[27:33] and so we believe this this this
[27:36] prophecy rather will come to pass very
[27:38] soon okay so that covers advances in
[27:43] science now let's look at the United
[27:47] States so if you ever Bible go to
[27:48] revelation 16:18 revelation 16:18
[27:53] because you're gonna hear a prophecy
[27:55] about the United States brother branham
[27:56] prophesied that Los Angeles was fall
[27:59] into the ocean after an earthquake and
[28:03] he said thus saith the Lord so let's see
[28:05] where that is in the scripture
[28:07] revelation 16:18
[28:12] so after the seventh vial if you read
[28:14] verse 17 in Revelation 1617 the seventh
[28:18] vial of course is the very last of the
[28:21] vials but in verse 18 it says and there
[28:24] were voices and thunders and lightnings
[28:26] and there was a great earthquake such as
[28:29] was not since men were upon the earth so
[28:32] mighty an earthquake and so great okay
[28:37] so there was going to be a great
[28:38] earthquake that's never happened before
[28:39] it's gonna have such an effect that the
[28:41] great city in verse 19 divided into
[28:43] three parts and the cities of the
[28:45] nation's fell right to her it is my and
[28:48] great Babylon came in remembrance before
[28:50] God to give unto her the cup of the wine
[28:52] of the fierceness of his wrath so there
[28:55] is coming a great earthquake and not
[28:57] just one nation or not just one city but
[28:59] numerous cities other nations are all
[29:01] going to be destroyed at this earthquake
[29:04] alright next go to Revelation 13 now we
[29:10] don't have time but revelation 13 verses
[29:13] 11 to 18 is prophecy about the United
[29:17] States which we'll see next
[29:20] revelation 13 11 through 18 and brother
[29:25] Bram tells us this is thus saith the
[29:27] Lord
[29:27] so verses 1 through 10 are about pagan
[29:31] Rome okay and then verses 11 through 18
[29:34] is about papal Rome in the United States
[29:38] so that's what these scriptures are
[29:40] about now let's go down to verse 16
[29:42] though and he causes all both small and
[29:47] great rich and poor free and bond to
[29:49] receive a mark in their right hand or in
[29:50] their foreheads that no man might buy or
[29:53] sell save that he had the mark or the
[29:55] name of the beast or the number of his
[29:56] name
[29:57] here his wisdom let him that hath
[29:58] understanding count the number of the
[30:00] beast for it is the number of a man and
[30:02] his number is six hundred threescore and
[30:04] six so based upon these scriptures we
[30:09] will see that William Branham prophesies
[30:10] about the United States and it's not
[30:12] very positive in fact it's all negative
[30:14] there's really no hope for the u.s.
[30:16] other than individuals inside this
[30:18] nation who want to accept Jesus Christ
[30:21] amen
[30:22] so let's look at this here I believe it
[30:24] at the right spot here yeah 419 yeah I
[30:33] apologize for all that dramatic music I
[30:35] just kind of put that on there to kind
[30:37] of make people pay attention you know
[30:39] sometimes music can have an effect but
[30:41] it's super dramatic and I'm not really
[30:43] that dramatic but but I did it for the
[30:45] effect to try to catch the attention of
[30:47] people as a nation but individuals must
[30:56] seek God for His grace and mercy in this
[30:59] hour in order to be saved from
[31:00] destruction
[31:01] we begin with a quick summary of the
[31:04] prophecies related to the United States
[31:06] Los Angeles will be judged and will sink
[31:09] into the ocean America we're seeing the
[31:12] mark of the beast a powerful woman
[31:16] perhaps a politician or the Catholic
[31:18] Church will rule the United States
[31:20] before the antenna because of all the
[31:23] sins our country has allowed the God
[31:26] America claims to serve will destroy her
[31:30] America as a whole has turned down the
[31:33] Holy Ghost revival and will never come
[31:35] back to God the United States will come
[31:39] into a persecution like pagan Rome ishi
[31:42] in the fourth and fifth centuries a
[31:44] terrible explosion will come to America
[31:47] and caused craters and debris
[31:52] let's listen now as God's prophet
[31:54] William Branham speaks in the name of
[31:56] the Lord about each prophecy now that's
[32:00] okay there's a lot of prophecies about
[32:02] the u.s. as you can see if it's okay
[32:04] let's listen to them so you can hear
[32:06] them and remember these all come from
[32:09] the scriptures we read revelation 13 and
[32:11] then also revelation 16:18 they all come
[32:15] from there Hollywood will be welded by
[33:42] sender or it'll be the plastic surgeon
[33:44] or a grateful nation about it will be
[33:48] one before
[34:03] hey you take that whatever you wish
[34:08] what we need is down with the author on
[34:11] there this America has become too and
[34:15] what did she do a card revision she
[34:17] elected the wrong person
[34:19] no how long we were taking to run out
[34:21] will be some days thus saith the Lord
[34:26] well she'll never come back again
[34:31] she's gone right in 1965 william branham
[35:32] wrote about a vision he saw of the
[35:34] united states the last and seventh
[35:36] vision was where an i heard a most
[35:39] terrible explosion as i turned to look I
[35:41] saw nothing but debris craters and smoke
[35:44] all over the land of America amen
[35:56] alright so Bray understand that by God's
[35:58] grace oh my now we see all the prophecy
[36:02] is negative right about the nation but
[36:06] there is grace for all of us who will
[36:08] come down to the altar right whether you
[36:10] hopefully you've done it already if not
[36:12] you need to get down the altar and get
[36:13] saved amen get filled with the Holy
[36:15] Ghost but if not
[36:18] I'm sorry but for those who love God
[36:21] they will be kept from this destruction
[36:23] and we have two scriptures to back it up
[36:25] revelation 3:10 if you have a Bible you
[36:27] go to Revelation 3:10 revelation 3:10
[36:33] Jesus gives us a promise a red-letter
[36:36] promise from his precious mouth that if
[36:39] we keep the Word of God he will keep us
[36:41] from destruction revelation 3:10 because
[36:45] thou has kept the word of my patience I
[36:47] will also keep thee from the hour of
[36:49] temptation which will come upon all the
[36:50] world to try them that dwell upon the
[36:54] earth and the church said and this is of
[36:57] course revelation this is speaking of
[36:58] when the mark of the beast is being laid
[37:00] down all right now next just so you know
[37:04] that last statement about America having
[37:08] fire and craters that's from second
[37:11] Peter 3 so we can go there verse 7
[37:15] second Peter 3 7 because the Bible says
[37:19] 2nd Peter 3:7 but the heavens and the
[37:23] earth which are now by the same word are
[37:25] kept in store reserved unto fire against
[37:29] the day of judgment and perdition of
[37:31] ungodly men so there's the but the Bible
[37:34] says right there it could come as it'll
[37:37] come as atomic bombs it'll come as
[37:39] volcanic fire all this destruction
[37:41] brother Branham saw America being
[37:44] destroyed with fire debris craters and
[37:46] the Bible says this is what God is gonna
[37:49] do to pour out judgment upon ungodly men
[37:51] so we must be godly in this hour amen
[37:55] and we will as he'll keep us from the
[37:57] hour temptation if we live godly amen
[37:59] what a beautiful promise of the Lord
[38:02] okay now next we'll look at the mark of
[38:06] the beast
[38:06] we looked at this a little bit last week
[38:10] so let's look at it again now the
[38:12] scripture want to go to is back to
[38:13] revelation 13:16 and I'll take a moment
[38:16] after watch the video I'll take a moment
[38:18] to show you what the number of the beast
[38:20] will be so let's go back though to
[38:22] revelation 13:16
[38:25] now I don't have this quote up here but
[38:27] brother Branham said the Holy Spirit
[38:29] told him to pick up his pen and write
[38:30] and
[38:31] brother branham said according to
[38:32] revelation three I'm sorry thirteen
[38:35] sixteen he says I believe that the
[38:38] denominations will keep the bride from
[38:41] preaching to the elect of God so the
[38:44] Holy Spirit told brother Branham that in
[38:46] America the government is gonna keep the
[38:49] bride from preaching the true Word of
[38:51] God so we know that is something future
[38:54] if we live long enough and this
[38:55] persecution happens in our day they're
[38:58] gonna close down churches like ours
[39:00] because that's what the Holy Spirit said
[39:03] now you can see it already in the
[39:04] government it's getting so divided
[39:06] between Republican Democrat and
[39:08] Democrats are saying oh you shouldn't
[39:10] serve Republicans in the restaurants and
[39:14] then you know the president before he
[39:17] got president he was saying you should
[39:18] beat people up if they don't agree with
[39:19] you you know
[39:20] I don't know what he says now but I know
[39:21] he said that in his campaigns because I
[39:23] saw it that's not godly that's that's so
[39:25] you can you can in other words you can
[39:26] see the hostility on both sides well at
[39:29] some point they're gonna turn that
[39:30] hostility towards the true believer you
[39:33] can already see it now building up they
[39:35] already don't like each other but the
[39:37] somehow the Beast will cause them to
[39:39] unite and though unite against real
[39:41] spirit-filled Christians and all that
[39:44] hostility will be brought upon us or
[39:46] whoever's left of us you know should the
[39:48] Lord tarry and they will stop us from
[39:50] preaching the true Word of God according
[39:53] to that verse revelation 13:16 okay so
[39:56] let's watch this the mark of the beast
[39:58] and then we'll prove to you what the
[40:00] what the number of the beast is we'll
[40:02] prove his number 666 religion and
[40:17] Christian denominations will take the
[40:19] mark of the beast
[40:33] [Applause]
[40:35] [Music]
[40:40] you can are they will they going to
[41:37] you
[42:46] yes the Medes and Persians in the Book
[42:48] of Daniel took over after Babylon fell
[42:51] so these two are undisputable by the
[42:54] Bible if you follow history though
[42:56] you'll see the next ruler after the
[42:58] Medes them Persians was the Greek Empire
[43:04] and we can prove this I prove this by
[43:07] its I the roll
[43:09] o pyar took over which of course rule in
[43:11] the days of Jesus but then at the bottom
[43:12] the feet were divided of iron and clay
[43:17] and this is where we are today where
[43:20] Rome is ruling through Catholicism which
[43:23] is iron and clay which is Protestantism
[43:26] so that's how that's how is at the end
[43:30] time so we know in our time right where
[43:32] we are we're we're living in a time
[43:34] where Catholicism and Protestantism is
[43:37] ruling the world through politics right
[43:40] through their influence especially the
[43:43] Catholic Church the Roman Catholic
[43:44] Church so we know and Jesus said this
[43:47] has to stand until the times of the
[43:50] Gentiles are fulfilled in Luke chapter
[43:52] 21 so this image that Nebuchadnezzar saw
[43:56] Daniel interpreted it and we know Rome
[43:59] is gonna rule to the end time now let me
[44:02] show you how the number of the beast is
[44:05] 666 and how it refers to the Pope of
[44:09] Rome okay so the number of his name the
[44:13] number of the beast is the number of a
[44:15] man the Pope one of the titles of the
[44:18] Pope is vicarious Phil I I don't know if
[44:22] I'm saying the rightful a Philly is it
[44:24] Philly okay Vic Harris Philly day I know
[44:27] it's a day Agnes day I know that so and
[44:30] that means Vicar to the children of God
[44:33] in other words the leader the person
[44:36] who's in the place of God to God's
[44:38] children and you can prove it right here
[44:40] so the number is 666 and the title the
[44:44] Pope is vicarious Philly was it Philly
[44:47] that's right Philly day and that's in
[44:51] where we are right now in our Bibles
[44:52] revelation 13:16 so you can see from
[44:55] this if you take the Roman numerals for
[44:59] this
[44:59] lat Latin word if you take the Roman
[45:02] numerals and the values you add them all
[45:04] up you get to 666 okay so there's one
[45:09] there's one view of it and it shows how
[45:11] one I'm sorry I equals one V equals five
[45:14] x equals ten l equals 50 C equals 100 D
[45:18] equals 500 and M equals 1,000
[45:21] okay so here's another another visual
[45:24] here's vicarious philly day just another
[45:28] visual it must be noted that in romans
[45:30] i'm sorry that the romans wrote the U as
[45:33] a V sobic Arius will actually be the
[45:36] same amount as a V over here and thus
[45:39] when you add that up then you can get
[45:41] the value of 666 that's the number of
[45:45] his name okay also this is another it's
[45:50] a little more clear did you see how you
[45:51] how you added up it's just a little
[45:53] better visual there you can see how it
[45:55] adds up to 666 now this is easy to
[45:58] calculate church I went on Google and I
[46:00] went to Google and I said translation
[46:02] from Latin to English and I did
[46:04] vicarious which means vicar Philly which
[46:08] means children and day which means God
[46:12] so in other words and then if you type
[46:14] in the whole thing Vic eres Philly day
[46:16] it's the it means the Vicar the vicars
[46:18] I'm sorry Vicar of gods
[46:20] so other mean in other words they're
[46:22] saying the Pope is the in the place of
[46:24] the Son of God they're saying the PO
[46:27] takes Jesus place and church he doesn't
[46:29] he doesn't because he teaches false
[46:32] doctrine
[46:33] he calls himself Holy Father and Jesus
[46:35] called said there's only one holy father
[46:37] and that's the Heavenly Father he takes
[46:39] on the name of God and he blasphemes the
[46:42] name of God by doing that encouraging
[46:44] people and remember the Pope said if if
[46:46] you don't believe Mary as your mother
[46:49] the Pope said you're an orphan and I'll
[46:52] have you to know I'm not an orphan
[46:53] because God is my Heavenly Father my
[46:56] father is alive and well tonight by
[46:58] God's grace I'm not an orphan I'm bought
[47:00] with the price I'm the purchased
[47:02] property of my father the Lord Jesus cry
[47:05] okay so that should be pretty simple to
[47:09] see that that's the number of his name
[47:13] okay so here's where we are all right so
[47:18] we didn't mark of the beast' correct we
[47:19] didn't mark of the beast so now we're at
[47:21] the next part which will be Rome and
[47:24] Vatican ok the Roman Vatican and for
[47:27] your scripture let's go to Revelation
[47:32] chapter 18 Revelation chapter 18 18
[47:39] verse 10 Revelation 18 verse 10 the
[47:42] Bible says Mystery Babylon will be
[47:46] destroyed in one hour and brother friend
[47:48] tells us to destroy this the Vatican
[47:54] City in one hour he says it'll and he
[47:57] says thus saith the Lord
[47:59] so the prophet tells us revelation 18
[48:03] drum on and again and that's hard to say
[48:07] and I have friends at her Catholic I
[48:10] nice people sweet people we're not
[48:13] against any people were just again in
[48:14] the Spear organization which teaches
[48:16] people to not honor the Word of God
[48:18] alright so let's watch this here as we
[48:21] look at Rome and the Vatican here should
[48:23] start with okay so we never watch that
[48:27] do we ever watch that do we watch the
[48:30] mark of the beast
[48:30] okay so let's watch that and I think
[48:33] it'll just flow right into Rome in the
[48:35] Vatican yeah yeah we watch that for some
[48:50] reason I went back okay so I'm sorry
[48:52] it's at 10:50 so let me just get ahead
[48:53] here sorry about that church my father
[48:59] sees the mark of the beast Rome in the
[49:08] Vatican
[49:10] now it's profit for told us that world
[49:12] will rule the world not look how there's
[49:17] these statues
[49:18] you know they worship these statues you
[49:19] know it's a it's a place of idolatry
[49:23] ultry it's the mother of all denied
[49:26] enamel because the denomination limits
[49:28] the word of God
[49:29] a denomination says this is all the
[49:31] truth there can be nothing else but when
[49:33] that happens God moves on from those
[49:35] people because they reject the rest of
[49:38] the revelation of the Holy Spirit but
[49:40] you can just see the idolatry right
[49:41] there
[49:48] [Music]
[50:03] [Music]
[50:12] [Music]
[50:20] therefore we should fight Romanism it's
[50:23] spiritual influence and not necessarily
[50:26] the country gods pop hope everybody
[50:29] catches that we're not saying we should
[50:30] fight a war we should fight with prayer
[50:32] right with prayer to call people out of
[50:35] that denominational system so Bram says
[50:38] fight Romanism he doesn't mean go get in
[50:40] a fistfight with somebody or try to
[50:42] knock them out or start a war he's
[50:44] saying pray and battle spiritually put
[50:46] on the full armor of God right you
[50:48] soldiers and pray and ask God to bring
[50:50] people out of that denomination I just
[50:52] want to make sure that's clear
[51:18] okay so everybody see that
[51:20] so that's revelation 1810 standing afar
[51:22] off for the fear of her torment saying
[51:24] alas alas I'm sorry that great city
[51:27] Babylon that mighty City for in one hour
[51:30] is thy judgment scum so I'm gonna take
[51:33] one after all the thousands of years
[51:34] where she's tormented the church God's
[51:36] gonna take care of her in one hour God's
[51:38] gonna pour out his wrath and judgement
[51:40] oh my lord have mercy so we've been told
[51:43] a prophet tells us who's gonna destroy
[51:45] one hour it's gonna be Russia
[51:47] okay now lastly reassurance for true
[51:51] Christians so go to first Thessalonians
[51:53] 5:9 and you'll see the reassurance for
[51:56] true Christians first Thessalonians 5:9
[52:01] now of course we don't have time to read
[52:03] all this - but if you read chapter 4
[52:06] first Thessalonians you'll read about
[52:08] the rapture and if you read chapter 5 it
[52:11] talks about how God is going to deliver
[52:13] his people from the tribulation because
[52:19] in first Thessalonians 5:2 the Bible
[52:21] says the day of the Lord cometh as a
[52:23] thief in the night no one's going to
[52:24] know when this rapture is gonna come
[52:26] jesus said no man knows the day or the
[52:28] hour and then in verse three for when
[52:30] they shall say peace and safety then
[52:32] sudden destruction cometh upon them as
[52:34] travail upon a woman with child and they
[52:36] shall not escape if we go down to verse
[52:39] 8 but let us who are of the day be sober
[52:41] putting on the breastplate of faith and
[52:43] love and for an helmet the hope of
[52:46] salvation now here's verse 9 I sought to
[52:47] make you rejoice for God hath not
[52:49] appointed us unto wrath but to obtain
[52:52] salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[52:55] this is the context is the rapture and
[52:59] then the tribulation and Paul says we
[53:01] were not ordained to wrath but we're
[53:04] obtained were ordained to salvation
[53:06] which means deliverance through our Lord
[53:08] Jesus Christ amen
[53:10] okay so here brother branham gives us
[53:12] some reassurance that we will not go
[53:17] through the tribulation we will end this
[53:26] video by sharing the good news for the
[53:28] true believer in Jesus Christ Jesus will
[53:32] first-night his bride and then keep his
[53:34] bride or Holy Ghost filled Church away
[53:37] from any doom that comes upon the United
[53:39] States
[54:15] [Music]
[54:30] all right so buddy hear that before God
[54:33] would break down any denominational
[54:36] barriers as any barriers we have with
[54:38] other churches let's say or any other
[54:39] Christians anyone who's a true member of
[54:42] the Bride of Christ God will break down
[54:43] all the barriers and will be united as
[54:46] one true church one true bride so see
[54:49] the world is doing a false unity there
[54:51] United around sin but we are united by
[54:54] the blood of Jesus Christ and the Word
[54:56] of God amen and it's not just our idea
[54:59] it's thus saith the Lord any barriers we
[55:02] have with any believer will come down
[55:03] we'll be united in Christ
[55:13] now be careful with this quote brother
[55:17] brother Bram's says the bride will be
[55:20] gone before any Russian soldiers invade
[55:23] now I don't know that Russian soldiers
[55:25] are gonna invade or not but I just want
[55:26] to prepare you I don't think that part
[55:28] was thus saith the Lord
[55:29] thus saith the Lord par is that the
[55:32] bride of be gone before any invasion
[55:35] would happen but we don't know if it's
[55:38] going to be Russia we don't know who
[55:39] it's gonna be I imagine we got to be
[55:40] careful not to that's what I'm trying to
[55:42] say let's not add to the prophecy
[55:51] [Music]
[56:04] [Music]
[56:11] [Music]
[56:18] notice that brother branham never said
[56:20] in Russia would invade with us say the
[56:23] Lord but only that the bride would be
[56:25] gone in the rapture before any invasion
[56:27] would take place all the satanic aahs
[56:35] will be inland in 64 the people of God
[56:39] are being made ready by the word of
[56:41] truth from the messenger to this age in
[56:44] her will be the fullness of Pentecost
[56:46] for the Spirit will bring the people
[56:49] right back to where they were at the
[56:50] beginning that is thus saith the Lord
[56:53] it is thus saith the Lord for that is
[56:56] what Joel chapter 2 verses 23 through 26
[57:00] says thank you for taking time and watch
[57:04] this video thanks thank thank all of you
[57:07] for watching this video as well amen
[57:10] now I want to tell you Church where all
[57:13] those came from one time a few years ago
[57:15] I I just really stirred up by they
[57:19] believe the sign and stuff and I said
[57:22] well I want to see every every prophesy
[57:24] brother Branham said I don't want to see
[57:26] I don't want to prove he's a prophet so
[57:28] I went through over 3,000 almost 4,000
[57:31] quotes of thus saith the Lord or in the
[57:35] name of the Lord and then I found every
[57:37] quote that pertained off the ones that
[57:38] were pertain to us okay I save that and
[57:41] then I made this video so that was the
[57:42] video based upon all the future prophecy
[57:45] that I could see that relates to us now
[57:48] there's more of course like you know the
[57:49] move is the on the bride the stay at the
[57:51] lower orders like that but the ones for
[57:54] the future that we can clearly see this
[57:57] is gonna happen that's gonna happen I
[57:58] tried to put those all in this video and
[58:01] I hope that was a blessing by God's
[58:02] grace so that's where I got all that I
[58:06] went and studied you know it took it
[58:08] took me a month or so to get through all
[58:09] those 3,000 or 4,000 quotes and this is
[58:13] what I can see God has showed us cuz
[58:14] remember when the Spirit of Truth has
[58:16] come he will guide us into all truth and
[58:18] he will show us things to come
[58:20] all right so I'm gonna I'm gonna end on
[58:23] time tonight so give me a few minutes
[58:24] here I'll be done in about five minutes
[58:25] so very thankful for that by God's grace
[58:27] I hope somebody here is being blessed
[58:29] and I hope someone out there is hearing
[58:31] the Word of God and rejoice
[58:32] and God's promises and also taking
[58:34] warning because some of these are
[58:35] warning prophecies a lot of them are
[58:38] because there's a lot of destruction we
[58:39] know that's to come upon the earth okay
[58:42] so I'm gonna just kind of repeat this
[58:44] again from last week what does this mean
[58:46] for you and I first we need to pray
[58:49] listen to the sermons and seek God to
[58:51] decide if this man was a true prophet or
[58:52] not I don't know about you but every
[58:55] time I showed you a prophecy I showed
[58:57] you in the Bible where it was so these
[58:59] are not just made-up prophecies this is
[59:03] a true prophet of God who is telling
[59:04] what's already written in the Word of
[59:06] God he's not adding to it like the
[59:08] Mormons add to it they have a whole
[59:09] separate book added to the Bible but
[59:12] here God has just sent us a true prophet
[59:14] that's just office those things in the
[59:23] Word of God
[59:25] [Music]
[59:27] what's gonna happen amen
[59:30] Sikhs you'll find that the word prophet
[59:33] of God we've been explaining at the last
[59:34] watch last Sunday okay next
[59:37] again pray listen to sermons ask God
[59:40] help you to live the original faith the
[59:42] Apostles because we just saw in Joel
[59:43] chapter 2 God's taking us right back to
[59:46] there then we have on our video like I
[59:49] said on our website over 50 he teaching
[59:53] videos we just uploaded one this week I
[59:55] think it was revelation chapter 12 we
[59:57] just uploaded if I can do it this week I
[59:59] want to make the next video on jewelry
[1:00:01] tattoos in the Bible and you'll see
[1:00:04] there are certain kinds of jewelry the
[1:00:05] Bible says we can work there's other
[1:00:07] kinds that we can't wear and of course
[1:00:09] tattoos you know God will forgive you if
[1:00:11] you do but God never wants us to right
[1:00:13] and Mark permanently on our body
[1:00:15] that's a perversion because God wants to
[1:00:17] write his word upon your heart and
[1:00:19] that's called the mark or the seal of
