on this holy word delivered to us from heaven through a prophet praise God let's take our Bibles go to Ephesians chapter 5 I'd like to continue on this series here by the grace of Lord like to do Ephesians five verse eight on Wednesday we looked at the fruits of the spear we kind of worked our way in chapter 5 verse 8 and 9 with the fruits of the spirit if you get a chance to listen that and you're wondering about the fruit of the Spirit it would help you because some people think the Pharisees had more fruit of the Spirit than Jesus but that's impossible because Jesus was the seed of the woman and he brother BAM said he had all the fruits of the Holy Spirit just people don't understand the way brother Ram explained it he tried to make a point how the Pharisees looked they looked more holy than Jesus but they weren't they tried to act more holy and pleased the people and look like they were more sanctimonious but they weren't they did not have the true fruit of the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ had the whole fruit of the Spirit praise God so visions 5s2 verse 8 9 and 10 and 11 or then we have our memory verse today I sent sister Wendy a text and she liked to do Romans 12 so read our text here and then we'll go to Romans 12 five-eight I'll read five eight nine and then we'll all read verse eleven I'm sorry nine and ten and we'll all reverse 11 so let me read eight nine and ten and we'll all read verse 11 for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the Lord walk as children of light for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable unto the Lord now let's read verse eleven one two three and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them now go to Romans 12 let's read one and two this be our memory verse four marks here verses one and two so that's all read these together Romans 12:1 and 2 Romans 12:1 and 2 let's read this on three one two three I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God amen let's have a word of Prayer if ever needed on your heart just make it known unto God here let's pray together Heavenly Father we read your word it's powerful it's living it's sharp it's more powerful than any double-edged sword father it's already beginning to touch our hearts now as we read it father let your Holy Spirit Lord Lord just give though the words of life to us here Lord God let it cut away anything of the world dear God and father let these seeds of truth fall upon the good ground of our hearts let them be watered with praise Father that they might grow up and produce fruits of the Spirit in our lives thank you Lord that you had your prophet 2,000 years ago write these holy unchanging words Lord while in prison that we might benefit Lord God overcome we'd say the prison's of darkness in this our Lord God that we might be free in Christ in this our Lord thank you for the liberty of the Holy Spirit thank you for Lord the ability to walk in the spirit Lord God and father will give you all the glory today in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless you mean see they praise the Lord let's look to the Lord here as we take these thoughts now by God's grace we'll look at chapter 5 working at part 20 here of the Ephesians series I just have a few slides so Keysha if you want you can pull it over there so Lord we lingual will look at part 20 here by God's grace seasons 5 we'll continue looking here so I wanted to share too about that dream my mother had I guess in the dream she was in Israel and she was came into a house in Israel and was kind of panicked she's like where's Jesse where's Jesse and one man found or one man kind of saw her and brought her over to the stairs and I guess I was upstairs working on the plastering and had tools in my hands and some other strange details but she said I came down the stairs I got all these tools in my hands and she just run to me and hugged me and was crying and praising Lord and she woke tup that same way just uncontrollably weeping and praising God that we were back United together so I look at like I look at like this I'm up here and God's gonna bring her up there and unite us together in some house I don't know his house in the promised land praise God so that's how I'm looking at a bus even by God's grace and the trust of the Lord to to quicken these things and you know what brother Troy was here I spent part of that time weeping and crying that God would bring my mom and dad in the message and I'm just gonna keep praying and believing and these are things that I can't do I've said words to her I've given her book I tried to have witness to her in the past numerous times and tried to share some things brother Bram said about dreams and prophecies and but you know this is God when God sends a dream God's talking to them in the night vision praise God God is talking there so I just rejoice than that I'm really encouraged and I'm thanking the Lord that God is speaking to each person praise God while this whole world's being shook by the virus you know we're being you know God's also promised to shake every soul praise God I wanted to read this real quick I found this online yesterday in the year 2000 everybody thought y2k was gonna destroy everything did you see this meme huh okay I don't remember that I remember that I thought all the computers are gonna fail year 2000 it didn't happen in 2001 everybody was scared of anthrax in 2002 the West Nile virus somebody was scared of that in 2003 SARS everybody was worried about that in 2005 it was the bird flu in 2006 it was ecoli in 2008 the financial collapse with the housing market in the US everybody thought is all destruction there 2009 was the swine flu 2012 the Mayan calendar predicted the world's ending and boy did that fail in 2013 everyone thought North Korea was going to cause World War 3 in 2014 it was the Ebola virus in 2015 it was Isis they thought you know the show the videos remember they were persecuting Christians everybody thought that was the end then 2016 was the Zika virus and now here we are 2020 it's the corona virus now I'm not sharing that to make light of this because we are praying for that we want to use wisdom we want to wash our hands you know we want to be very careful but the fact is we can't let fear take us I remember when Isis was persecuting the Christians I was really getting shook up by that like it might come to the US I remember all these you know I was really y2k I think would have been the biggest one shaking me up there as far as all these because it seemed like it was legitimate but it's it's a reminder for us to put our confidence in God's Word and not put our minds too much in the media right and the world of course they're not much anyway you know but it's just a great reminder that we do not fear we cast out all fear we use wisdom understanding pardon me but we must cast down anything that results itself against the Word of God and so I just thought that was a great meme I thought man I just need to share that with the church I think they'd like that because it reminds us how important it is to not fear right the Bible said things can't happen to Joe because he feared them right and I'm sure we can look at our lives some things happen because we feared it right we allowed it to happen we we gave it a home or debride itself that lie we gave a place to the devil right and then it happened we say God forgive me I'm sorry and then God gives us strength for the next battle praise God so just thought I'd share that because I've lived through all those those are not things I didn't live through those are things I've lived through I remember anthrax I remember all that Oh am I gonna get a package in the mail that's got it's coated with anthrax on it you know I just living a type of those things we got to use wisdom and we got to trust God so let's look here I just thought I'd start with that we did our memory verse in our text now we're in our third theme according to Scofield the walk and welfare of the believer or warfare rather I just want to go back for a few moments to chapters 1 and 2 and I just want to review your position just very briefly I just want to take maybe two or three minutes and just review this briefly here by the grace of the Lord because I was reading through your eyes I saw I thought this morning I just want to go back and read through Ephesians one to four and kind of review who Paul was writing to remember it was two Christians that that started off they just started off as a real small Church twelve Holy Ghost filled Saints how many we got here today that's about that many very similar praise God but now time has gone on since he started the church I think it was four years he's writing this from prison to the Saints in Ephesus and Ephesus is the second biggest city we'd say as far as prosperous rome had the most idolatry it was a worship of women area with princess diana it's not Princess Diana the goddess Diana sorry Princess Diana was from England but the goddess they had goddesses and gods and all kinds of idols but Paul was writing to a special group of believers who were born-again they believed but they were baptized under John and then Paul came and said but have you received the Holy Ghost or you have a greater power than what John had they said we didn't even know there was so he baptized them prayed for them the Holy Ghost came upon them they spoke in tongues they prophesied and they were filled with God's Spirit amen that's where they came from and so before going on because chapter five deals with marriage and children right at chapter five and six before going on let's recall who Paul is addressing in verse one and verse three of chapter one he's addressing those who have been blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen that's who's Paul's talking to so these words and we'll get to it just in a little bit the Paul's telling these people not to lie Paul's telling these people don't give place to the devil yet at the same time these are the same ones who have all blessings into something church how we can have all blessings but many times we forsake them just for a few minutes or for your few hours of our day maybe a week we get backslidden or maybe a month or you know depends how long we battle but Paul's saying we have all spiritual blessings but he's telling these people don't forget he said you still got a battle line you still got our battles stealing you're at the battle keeping your mind right and walking in the holy spirit he said but your soul he says is in heavenly places in Christ Jesus Amen thank the Lord that's verse three now verse four it's he's writing to those who were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love and so see those people that need to be holy like Paul says need to be reminded about what they need to do to be holy stop lying right always tell the true stop stealing don't let don't have wrath against Christians don't have wrath against anybody praise God the people that are chosen need reminders to live holy now amen you and I need reminders to lis be holy praise God it's not just enough to say you're in the message you believe God sent a prophet that's not enough we need reminders to live the way we're supposed to live praise God that's what he's writing to he's writing to those who are predestined to the adoption amen of children by Jesus Christ to himself God's riding their children who are going to be adopted right they're gonna take full a full possession of God's inheritance for them amen that's what adoption is right it's taking full inheritance or full possession of what God's called you to do amen how many predestinate souls we have here you are gonna take full possession of what God's called you to do hallelujah and that's and that's done Paul says in verse six and seven this is for those who are accepted in heaven amen in the beloved in the bosom of Christ Paul's writing to those who are accepted in Jesus Christ and are redeemed through the blood and have forgiveness of sins like we sing about today when his love ran red at the cross I surrender my life I give all to him praise God that's Wiis writing to those who know about the cross that are forgiven by the blood amen he's writing to those who know the mystery of his will and church remember God's will is revealed one step at a time you and I don't always know all the steps that God is going to lead us in his will but we know the midst of his will is to be holy amen because he's given us a holy calling praise God and you like Abraham we're not told all the details right away we're just told follow me leave your family leave your sinful things behind right and walk in obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ amen still love your family right we have to leave anything that would hinder us we gotta leave it behind and follow Christ yes so God's will is progressive one step at a time he reveals his will to us praise God he's writing to those who I like this the spirit of wisdom but I want to read this cuz it was powerful when I read it this morning that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and the revelation in the knowledge of him Paul's writing the people that have wisdom now not like the world I got I got a nice family friends my wife and I know him very well they're Catholic and their daughter yesterday went to a Catholic ceremony where they sprinkle her and they put it on Facebook now I'm not making fun of it but this is what they believed when they got sprinkled in there confirming the church their Facebook post said praise God our daughter received all the gifts of the Holy Spirit today at their sprinkling now Church that's that's a man-made denominational idea that you just go you're a certain age you finish your confirmation they sprinkle you now you got all the gifts of the Spirit the fact was that God chooses the gifts of the Holy Spirit for you and he places them into you before you were born amen now all of them now some of that some people may have all of them like Martin Luther brother Brad who probably had all of them he spoke in tongues he prophesied did all the healing wisdom I know I'm sure he had all of them I'm sure Paul had all of them cuz he said I spoke in tongues more than all of you he prophesied right he had words of knowledge and so forth but see this is something that church God places in our lives and I just love the difference the difference is that we know God's placed it there a man a priest cannot put it there but God put it there amen because your predestinated to it God chose you for God's called you for something and God's the one that put it there praise God now I'm going to get to this later because in chapter 5 it said the wise Christians redeemed the time and I've been going out over that over and over but I want to look at that again the reason people don't redeem the time is because they haven't received the spirit of wisdom the reason they waste their time is because they don't have the spirit to give them wisdom to manage their time the church said house how people use their time and this message is the great indicator of whether they're born again or not because when you're born again you have the spirit of wisdom no one's got to tell you to do it as far as I mean the preaching will but no one at your home no one has to urge you to do it because the Holy Spirit is inside of you urging you to do it praise God because you've received the spirit of wisdom you've received the spirit I have a revelation right from God I have a spirit of revelation revealed to me that I must manage my time carefully I must live for God's glory if you didn't see it this morning I put up my next YouTube video the Lord helped me get this one done fast it was called the morning routine seeking first the kingdom of God so if you like that one share that with people if you feel led if you feel that but I thought it's just been such a burden on my heart and this proved it I this morning but they ain't meant I didn't realize it so I read it this morning that's the reason people waste their time they haven't received the wisdom to manage their time and how do you receive the wisdom you got to go to Christ again at amen you got to spend time with Christ you got to spend time in his presence and then when you receive that spirit now I know how to manage it because now I've got the spirit of it I don't know yet praise God that's the answer right there you've got to receive the Holy Spirit praise God hallelujah now I don't think that's a separate thing from the baptism Holy Ghost I think that's just an attribute of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so when you're born again you're you're given a portion of wisdom and revelation amen and then you're wise you're not foolish you're wise because you're packin oil that'll last you until the bridegroom comes amen glory I'm feeling good today bro I feel like preaching today amen I don't know yeah I had a good worship in yesterday and how do you sing the word feeling good today by God's grace but notice who's he riding to he's writing to those who were quickened who were once dead in trespasses and sins in other words he's riding the people that used to be dead but now they're alive amen not everybody can receive this if they're still dead in their sins the word won't mean anything to them but Paul was writing to people that I know I was dead but now I know I'm alive amen and so the word is powerful it's quick it's making giving me more strength to live higher in Christ up in those heavenly places amen oh thank you lord oh oh that's like honey in the honeycomb and then boom I'm enjoying it today pretty so be since too far but God he's writing to those I'm sorry who are loved seasons 2 4 but God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us church listen somebody loves you today and his name is Jesus Christ somebody loved you so much he died for you praise God you are loved today someone loves you children it's more than that it's more than mom it's a heavily mom and dad amen God said I love you with great love it's not a it's not a small love it's not a passive love it's an active obvious strong love God loves us so much he proved it through the cross and the Spirit is here to help you to feel loved and if you surrender to that you'll love to worship him you'll just surrender and give over and raise your hands and close your eyes and sing it and worship and love God if you'll surrender that love you'll feel his love amen you'll be able to express love back to him praise God when you surrender because he didn't love us with a small love or a wimpy love but he loved us with a great love hallelujah thank the Lord who is he writing to he's writing to church those who are raised up in verse 6 in chapter 2 he hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus hallelujah we're you're doing more than sitting in Bride of Christ fellowship Church pews or chairs you should be sitting above these seats in a heavenly realm of faith amen well he should be sitting not just here but we should be sitting in the presence of God and the presence of angels the Bible says that's what he said in verse 6 verse yea circs we are sit sitting together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and then we're saved by grace through faith and were created unto good works in chapter 10 he's riding the people that he made them to do a certain job to do good works for his name that's who he's riding he's not writing to people that don't have a job on earth he's writing to people that have an assignment I want you to be holy I want you to do my will I want you to serve me I want you to please me I want you to be a light and the city on the hill that cannot be hidden glory that's who he's riding to today I'm happy to be one of those cities praise God I'm happy to be one of those lights in the midst of darkness hallelujah he's riding the people that are made not all of us we are not far from the throne of God we are close we are not to the throne of God by the blood of Jesus Christ that's in verse 13 to 13 but now in Christ Jesus you who are sometimes far off are made nigh by the blood of Jesus Christ oh sure sometimes the devil tricks us and makes us think we're so far from God yet the Bible says the blood brings us close to God amen and if the reason you don't answer because it's not as will but we can rejoice because we made our requests unto God and we can rejoice that we asked him so he'll do whatever's best and we can rest in his choosing hey man I've been encouraged by that lately that by God not answering some prayers because I know I requested it so it must not be as well that's okay cuz God's gonna have glory anyway praise God I've been encouraged because we have access by one spirit under because we're so close the blood is made us so close we have access to God by the Holy Spirit we just have to pray in the spirit and not the flesh praise God we don't pray with doubt or unbelief we pray with faith by the Holy Spirit we know we're forgiven and we come close to God and we have access God can hear our prayer member Church the prayer of the upright is his delight he loves to hear you pray he loves to hear you talk to him you have access to God you have an open door to God you have God's phone number amen you have God's texting number you you have access to God those who he's writing to later telling them to not sins and live holy that's who he's writing to you and I praise God amen who's he writing to those fellow citizens in other words I'm a citizen just like Abraham was I'm a citizen just like Isaac and Jacob and Moses I'm wondering I'm one of them praise God because we are a fair citizens of the household of God and I love this we are one of the stones we're one of the top stones in God's holy temple because we're built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets praise God we're bill age after age and the Bible said we're built that way so that we can do this in Chapter finish in Chapter three no I'm sorry finished in chapter two that we can be framed together and grow into a holy temple of the Lord in whom we're also build together for a habitation of God through the spirit our church is a house with God's Spirit where God can dwell God wants to dwell here praise God we are supposed to be a dwelling place for God's Spirit praise God where people can access God's Spirit through you and I as we pray for them as we witness to them as we love them and forgive them people experience the presence of God through you and I that's right amen hallelujah we are part of that great Holy Temple Church God is building a temple and Jesus is the cornerstone and he's the capstone and we're finding our spot right here at the top praise God we're a part or one of those stones in the building up very top and that headstone is soon to come and this is a house of worship this is a house of God's Spirit dwelling amongst us living through us feeding us strengthen us the Bible said growing up into him glory amen who's he writing to he's writing to those that have the name the Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven earth is named that's who he's writing to then that had the name of Lord Jesus Christ not father son Holy Ghost not Methodist not Baptist I heard brother Ram say yesterday and God's chosen place to worship he said there's only one chosen place of worship and he said it's not Branham Tabernacle he said if I point you there you'll be just as messed up as anybody else he said God chosen place of worship is Jesus Christ amen go get me wrong that's a good church to go to right as long as they stay with the word I don't know where they are now but well I kind of know where they are now but I have tried to help where they are now but see you and I we just can't have to do more than point to a natural building yes you want to get them to building but once they're in the building physically they got to be part of the spiritual building the body of Christ and how do you get that body you're baptized by one spirit of that body amen hallelujah and we take the name the Lord Jesus Christ now who's he writing to I love this he's writing to those who are strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man right where we're sitting to heaven together in heavenly places in the soul but now Paul starts getting down to your human spirit I'm writing the people that can be strengthened here you ever feel like you're just not mentally strong enough to overcome the devil you ever feel like that I do but other times I feel like I could whip him right see because we got to be renewed we got to cast down anything any thought that exalts itself against the Word of God because we are the war today our weapons are mighty to the pulling down of strongholds praise God and we must receive his strength the inner man and the Bible said that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith by revelation hallelujah whose dwelling in you Jesus Christ is in me how do I know cuz he's revealed it to me praise God I see his life living out through my life amen I know the dead life I used to live but now I see the life that I live I live by the faith of the Son of God hallelujah thank the Lord who's he riding to I'm almost up to chapter 5 see how his working my way up to typify here's the ride to those who may be able to comprehend with All Saints the depth and the breadth and the height of God's love and to know the love of Christ we are people that are constantly trying to understand more of God's love we're trying to just wrap our we're trying to comprehend it and and just try to understand all of God's great love that's why we sing songs about God's love to help us try to remember it and understand it and think about all the love that he's poured out upon us Paul said he that we know the love of Christ that's right now chapter 4 he breaks in a some writing to those who walk worthy of the vocation and brother amen was singing about today as they're so inspired the Bible says there's one body one spirit there's one faith one Lord one baptism amen see that you see that I thought that was astounding that's what I was gonna preach on just a refresher praise God that we are one faith were one body praise God we are one the Rev one Lord one baptism one God we're all united in Jesus Christ he's writing to those who are walking worthy of the calling vocation as a calling you're called leave there to see a leave denominations escape the mother harlot come out of her that you be not partakers of her sins and her plagues amen that's right here's the writings of those who are coming into the perfection of the unity of the faith through the fivefold ministry which we've been majoring on that lately because it's majored in the Bible praise God that's what he's writing to those who are coming into a more perfect life all the time amen he's writing to those who are renewed see goes it goes back to it again he's renewed in the spirit of their minds and these are the people that we showed you in the picture last week let me see I just skip ahead real quick here yeah he's so he's writing to these people here they're renewed in the spirit of their minds the same ones that were chosen before the foundation of the world praise God amen he's telling them that you must overcome lying praise God how many of you have the power to do that he said renew your mind if you're so predestinated if you're so elected recognize your heart high calling let God renew your mind and you'll live above these things amen he gives them all those nice words at the beginning that he starts laying it down now if you say you are this now live this phrase God right just like any any new person you meet any any new preacher that comes in they're all real nice at first and they start laying down the hammer they start laying it to the Lord amen like any good teacher I had many teachers over the years in college and they're real nice at the beginning but then they start getting real rough by the end because they're trying to develop in you a type of character they're trying to teach you and that's what Paul does he starts real good all your predestination all your election all your blessings every spiritual blessing and they says now walk worthy lie no more get let have no wrath no more steal no more don't give out worthless words but build up people with your words hallelujah he said if you're so alive if you're so new if you're so free then live like it I got area and see right there brother bang this discounts all these people that hang around the message that live like Devils it discounts them because our vocation our calling is to live above it with a new man you got to become a new man put on a new garment live a new life and that proves that you're one of those predestinated back there in Chapter one amen hallelujah [Applause] see because you can put that power on they don't have the garment they don't have the Holy Ghost so they can't put that power on but you and I can put it on praise God amen now I'm gonna go back there just a few more things see Paul is writing to those who are can I say that let's all say this together we should be what we should be tender-hearted Paul's writing to those who are tender heart like they have a heart for people and they can feel people's pain and suffering they're not angry and bitter two churches should not be full of people arguing debating over who's better angry people upset people there should be people who are tender praise God and who care about other people praise the Lord we should have a tenderness to about us he said be tender-hearted you can only do that by the renewing of your mind right that's what the scripture says and we don't want to grieve the Holy Spirit praise God because we know when we do those sins we grieve his presence we offend his presence and then the anointing leaves our mind not our soul it leaves our mind and the church said Holy Ghost will not leave your so it sealed its mark to the day of redemption but it leaves our mind it grieves when we send it grieves the Holy Spirit with bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor evil speaking now chapter five we looked at this on Wednesday we must imitate God walk in love and there should not be sins named once among us we should have there shouldn't be fornication in our ranks there shouldn't be adultery in our ranks like Paul said there shouldn't be filthy filthiness or foolish talking nor jesting but instead we should give thanks to God that's right Christians are believed Christians are those who express the love of God and they're thankful for God's love and with all their words right like that goodness of God saw all of our words should praise God and give thanks to God that's right now why now let's go now to a few more verses here I want to start getting it out of the chapter here so today we're looking at verses now now look Wednesday we looked at nine so only those people who walk in the light bring forth the fruit of the Spirit because a scene can't produce anything without God's light praise God so those who walk in the light of the holy spirit if they let that light shine in their souls it will produce the fruit of the Spirit that's what Paul is saying here we used to walk in darkness now we walk in light now look at verse 10 isn't this beautiful but I just got done preaching that whole series I'll improve all things and then Paul comes in here says if we're the children of light with all the fruit of the Spirit and verse 10 he says proving what is acceptable unto the Lord and the church said oh yeah so who is who is going to possibly prove what is right only those people who have the holy spirit can prove what is right amen now the word prove means to test allow or discern or examine what is acceptable unto the Lord so see if there's ever a question about what we should do whether it's God's will we need to examine that in other words you need to sit down and have yourself a little Bible study attend it's one of the easiest times of your ever in history to have a Bible study because you have you have men's manuals and concordance is like matthew henry and naves topical textbook you can now you can and Thompson chain concordance if there's ever been a great time to have a Bible study it's now praise God these men have already done all the labors for us now of course not all because no Ram even had to go back in this concordance or the seven seals and find scriptures about oil and wine and of course that will edify you more make sure the job is fully done right but if ever there's a time where we should approve what we believe is right it should be right now so those who walk in the light the predestinated of God the the adopted are able to prove what God accepts now we're watching a little video on a church and actually there's two churches there's the numerous churches that they major on doing plays well Ram said a Holy Ghost filled Church can do plays for children like at Christmastime but there are certain you know some churches go way far on that let me say what I mean they go so far that though they let the men and women even wear makeup in message churches to put on a play now that's like doing a play and wearing short shorts or something like that or me doing a play breathing then taking my shirt off or walking around in shorts is there ever a good time to break God's word no but then brother bang you look at some of the fruits that come out of their churches and they're not genuine good fruits they're corrupt fruits like abuse right so one church I know that does that they had abuse in their church sexual abuse other one the other one had a church split years before that because the pastor was flirt with girls and women in the church and they split now where there's smoke there's fire hello churches in the church said see when people major on a minor they go way overboard into something and sin has to show up there majored on one quote for the Amen where it says yeah but it's okay for children have please well now they go so far that now the adults are and they're devoting all this time to plays and lights and camera and makeup and all these things is that what God wants us to vote our time - I mean year after year after year is that redeeming the time I don't know not for me that's not I feel a lot of the Holy Spirit I'd rather have a church program said I'd rather have a church that was on their knees praying that God pray not for spiritual blessings and souls to be saved praise God now you can win salt you can use place to try to win souls and I understand that but don't sin if we're doing it right don't have men and crossdresser and women and men wear makeup and wear jewelry and all kinds of you know ungodly jewelry I'm talking about simple things see it's we got to be very careful Satan's very sly and he's trying to get us to get us all into foolishness if if Satan knows he can't drive us out in the world he's gonna try to get us to go to the other extreme and be foolish instead of being wise and redeeming the time but thank God we have the spirit of wisdom hey man I was the spirit of Revelation hey James was clapping for us say Amen all right keep it up buddy you got a ways to go now you're getting good yeah that's it right there hallelujah I remember a little Rebecca Graham used to say man and Malachi yeah that's right getting into it get in the spirit of it that's right that's what we need to do right there yeah everybody get the spirit of the word yeah test it he said tests prove what's the will of God prove that God accepts it right this reminds us of that series we preach prove all things if you ever have a question you want know what I think ask me about it I'll be happy to tell you because we are to prove all things by the word of God a brother recently from another church he asked me to do a YouTube video he said can you do one on gambling he said because I have message friends that go to message churches that will gamble on fantasy sports leagues and then they'll also gamble by buying tickets and think it's led to the Lord now some of these same people are the same ones that have TVs in their homes and they watch TV all the time now something's wrong with that see now you got a lot of bad fruits not just one you got a lot of bad crop fruits over there it stinks right but man to kick all the trash out of your home so it stopped stinking in there right and so if you let to do that I'll do that Lord willing pretty soon we charge if they're if we're not sure what God's will is we need to prove it you think in this whole big book here I forgot how many verses there were how many hundreds of thousands of verses there were you thinking all these hundred thousands of verses guys tell us his will his attitude towards something do you think he's not gonna hide he's he's gonna hide something from us no the Bible says we've got to examine it we got to look at it we got to prove what God's will is that's right and I know I'm a little overzealous um well maybe I am a little overzealous sometimes but I'd rather be on the too strict side than on the loose side because I know one thing for sure it's not legalism I'm not saying you have to this all the time but I am saying stay at far away from anything that seems like it's of the flesh and of the world like program gave that illustration about driving up the drive around the the mountain right if there's a small road on the mountain are you gonna drive on the edge and see how close you can get to the edge before falling off only a fool will do that he said hug the mountain and I like it because Jesus Christ is the mountain ain't him and I'm hugging him I'm in his bosom praise God don't see how far you can get to the edge see how close you can get the Christ amen how true you can stay to the Lord prove all things amen so see those who walk in the light can prove it because they got enough light to prove it praise God they got enough light like I would just sweeping out that hallway out there this morning right before church started and I was I was thought I was doing a pretty good job brother bang I thought man I'm doing a pretty good job I opened the door all the light floods in I sell this Dustin like I couldn't even see it what a perfect example of this when you have light and we run going off the natural light right I thought oh it's all clean by the man-made light and that's what manmade churches and dogmas do praise God they think they're clean but they only got a false light amen they got an imitation light but you when you really get into the light of the Bible it'll show all that nothing there why not you can be sad about it then you can put it at the foot of the cross amen and get clean and walk in the light as he's in the light so you keep your church clean that's what I want to clean Church naturally yet but spiritually more so praise God so test it discern it try it out prove it's acceptable unto God Gloria I'm trying to think I just if there's any examples I could think of real quick I think one of the best examples was in the book that we wrote recently by God's grace with the jury there's such a balance there you really have to be led of the Holy Spirit because Joseph wore rings and a necklace and he was a type of Christ but then you got these women down there in Isaiah 3 where they don't want to hear Isaiah's preaching and they have 21 different accessories on them 21 different accessories on him like isn't 5 enough peg wear isn't 10 enough but they got to be all decked out it's just like the women of the world today how much time did you take to get ready to come outside you know we still have somebody who come to church that used to have a used to come to church years I had an anxiety this person told me that so such anxiety of looking worse that they would spend four or five hours just getting dressed and trying on different outfits before they come out into the public always wondering like how these people were running so late how come we're so late because they have such a there's a soul want to look good they want to impress people there's one person I got impressed or not impressed but please and that's Jesus Christ amen not to get caught up on such careless things I don't even remember what I wore yesterday hardly because it doesn't matter jesus said don't care about the things you're gonna wear and the food and what you're gonna drink he said seek my kingdom amen seek my righteousness and I'll take care of everything else hallelujah prove what's acceptable in to the Lord verse 12 now where am I going with this okay I'm getting to 18 well that's a good thought man I just thought that was so inspired I'll get there normally not verse 11 and have no fellowship which means participation verse 11 have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them now unfruitful means barren they don't produce any fruit of the Holy Spirit and reprove means to convict them don't join them convict them praise God so if you're walking the light you will not go walk in the darkness you'll stay in the light the verse 12 for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret we got to be very careful what we say about sin right because we don't want to say it too much out loud because it'll start tempting us right like if you battles suicide or hopelessness or if you battle us you start talking about some of these things in the news you start thinking oh maybe I should do that or Satan I start taking those I start shooting darts in your mind but you got to hold up that shield of faith praise God many times many times it's better just don't mention it right just don't don't say anything about it it's a shame even talk about some of these sins that people do because it'll start start Tet the Bible said us are working on you Satan trying to get a place in your mind in ters I just heard yesterday you know as far as that suicide I just I don't know if I may be a good time to share it but this one gentleman this one preacher on YouTube said that the suicides have seemed to rise recently since the computer age because that computer gives them it just it takes their whole focus away or no now it's smartphones or tablets right TVs and they get isolated from other people and they get hopeless because they're dangerous all they're doing is just spending time with themselves life is not meant to be lived all by yourself Paul never said you're just you know you're just your own lone lone ranger' Christian Paul said you are part of a body Amen your he said your you're a joint that supplies you need to supply help to other people you need to supply life to other people praise God and so Satan isolates them no computer can be a good thing I thank God for my my phone in my tablet I can preach of it thank God for that but we can't be isolated with that and so people are losing hope because Satan is trapping them and isolating them into their own lusts and their desires I just thought I'd share that just briefly since I mentioned that it's a shame to speak of those things which are done in secret yeah we are not even discuss some of them they're so awful verse 13 but all things that are reproved or corrected are made manifest by the light so the real Christian life will always prove what's good and what's wrong the real light will always prove what darkness is hallelujah that's how we know brother Branham was a true man of God his life was so lit up by the Holy Spirit not just his miracles signs and wonders but his teaching his life style praise God how he lived how he lived such a holy life unto God amen he would go away brother amen just to sit under a tree and talk to God and take his notepad in a pen that's all he took so he could talk to God and that's where God gave the statue perfect man praise God just sitting under a tree just thinking about the good things of God just fellowshipping with God he left all the world behind all the busyness and just to get some tylenol with the Lord amen I like that like oh he scatters darkness and whatever manifest darkness is light pretty pretty simple right Paul's not giving us rocket science huh he said if you are the light of the world he said your life will prove that they're in sin now verse 14 I like this wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest a sleeping virgin write and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light so you got to wake up if you want to walk in the light you got to wake up and come alive praise God reminds me that dry bones song right we cry out to dry bones come alive he said wake up if you're sleeping wake up and Christ will give you the life amen he'll give you the light now here's where it gets to this one I've been so meditating on and I hope I'm not preaching it too much I hope it's a blessing to you about redeeming the time it's kind of where I'm at right now here verse 15 he says see them that ye walk circumspectly that means exactly or diligently or perfectly walk perfectly not as fool's but as wise okay so that means foolish virgins will not be as diligent or as purposeful in the steps there they're choosing to walk in but a wise version the wise version will be so careful to only walk in the perfect will of God why because we got the spirit of wisdom hey Lia praise God see now the reason I rejoice over that church is because I realized that it's not no longer me it's the Holy Ghost in me praise God hey hey it's not me get excited like look what I can do it's thank God he gave me the Holy Ghost amen that's the reason I got his wisdom because I got his spirit praise God it's not no longer me but it's Christ in me to open Laurie that's right ah thank you lord glory he redeemed means to buy up to rescue from losing it to improve your opportunity take it back use it for good have control over can I say I control your day don't let people control you control your day by the wisdom of the Holy Spirit there's times there's accidents and unexpected things but he's saying redeem it use it back for the kingdom of God use it for God's glory see that you walk circular time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is see let's not be foolish virgins let's not be sleeping on the things of God let's be awake but let's apprehend or understand what the will of the Lord is because member is said earlier we know the mystery of as well I know you're right Church so he already said I'm writing to people that know the mystery of God's will and he says make sure you walk in the light make sure you're walking like a wise person amen that means we're going to struggle sometimes the walk in wisdom so he's reminding us redeem the time make the best use of time I want to read a few quotes here from brother Branham so just bear with me here this is from be not afraid 61 but I was talking about the disciples how they're on a boat with Jesus doing a testimony meeting before Jesus walk to him out on the sea and he says he said as you're sailing life's solemn sea testify sing or pray and like bread upon the water it will return to you someday speak a little word for jesus do something testify singer pray yes do something for while you're sailing over life's Alamein and then he quotes Longfellow which I'm just trusting is because I didn't go look up Longfellow sure he's a good Longfellow you know good fellow he said a forlorn and shipwrecked brother in saying shall take heart again said Longfellow yes while we're sailing life's Alamein let's give our testimony let's do something that will leave footprints on the sands of time footprints that perhaps another yes a for loner and shipwrecked brother seeing what we did we'll take heart again make another try he's seen where somebody was pouring it out he made a try and stood on the promises of Christ and became a soldier the cross let's make footprints amen that's why I have to Sunday services because brother Bram did the church said brother Andrews if a prophet of God would have to church services on Sunday as tires I get sometimes I want to try to do it by God's grace because the band then the Bible says gather more as you see that Day approaching well how am I going to do that I got to make more time to do it because the Bible says gather more and we're also busy during the week when are we going to get together he said so look at the footprints that people have left in the sands of time and follow those footprints a god we got a bloody footprint a bloody set to follow praise God we got a bloody set of footprints to follow the footprints of Christ who if anybody redeemed the time it was Jesus Christ and then he says we will fall in the footsteps he says foot steps is possession God told Joshua everywhere the soles of your feet sets I'll give it to you foot steps meant possession go on and get it it's yours every promise in the book everything that God ever promised you is yours he ain't just gonna sweep out the house and say go take it he said I've given you Palestine but they had to fight for every inch of the road he said every time God makes a promise you'll fight for every inch of the road just take the sword of the Spirit and the word and cut every devil and unbelief away from you cut loose the shorelines that hold you bound to the shore launch out into the deep and let down the draw amen oh thank you lord hallelujah I'm taking this cool next quote from taking sides with Jesus 1962 he said I believe with all my heart we're living in the last days I believe there's not too much would break this anything and my interpretation may be wrong of the scriptures that Jesus could not come tonight so he believed Jesus could come that night I believe that what little is left to be fulfilled could be fulfilled before daylight in the morning and I'd see and I may be wrong on the time of that fulfilling but it's at hand I believe that and remember Paul believed that John believed that polic heart believed that Iranians believe that Martin believed that all the rest of them believed that what if God would have told John the Revelator now John it's going to be 2,000 years before my coming he said John would have come back and told the church well I guess we might as well eat and drink and be merry because there's going to be many generations and that awesome God Jesus did not tell John it's going to be 2000 years on purpose because he wanted him looking for the coming of the Lord he didn't want him lazy wasting the time he I'm redeeming the time he said see the church would have been loose we don't want to lead a loose life do we well just we'll do this sometimes and loose with the world other times we'll be right with the word I want to be I'm gonna be I don't the belt on tie all the time praise God he said gird up the loins of your mind put it on tight she can work for the Lord he said after all it's your anticipations if you fall asleep and that watch that you wake with the same anticipations because they ain't gonna hinder one thing you're going to be right there on time anyway see what I mean when st. Maarten awakes in the resurrection st. Paul all the rest of them it'll be just as fresh as if they were right in the battle battling away because they went down right under those same and tesha patients looking for us coming and they will come a scream and up will come the whole church you see so it doesn't matter praise God see we're just supposed to labouring and look for us coming look for us coming and if we go down to the grave while we're looking for we'll wake up the coming amen our whole life is about Jesus Christ is coming back soon I'm looking for the rapture praise God he says we've got to be looking for him right now there's your dream brother right now and brother you know brother anyone was not prophesied he was just telling the dream that he thought the Lord gave him but there said we got to be looking for him now there must be some people in our church that aren't looking for him now and they're acting like he's gonna come later hallelujah and the church said I believe I imagine there are some people in our church they're not living like he's coming now we should live like he's coming soon there it is I did but I didn't plan that that was the Holy Spirit I believe that follow my heart he should be we're looking for him right now remember brother hey man had that dream Jesus came to him and said go tell the people I'm coming now now we know no man knows the day or the hour but then brother am says right here we got to be looking for him now in other words live in the present time we established in the present truth live your life like he's going to come now make sure you're doing the wise things you ought to do redeeming the time because the days are evil praise God he said so see it'll be just as fresh the dead in Christ will rise first we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air whether we're dead or alive it'll be just as fresh he's coming amen now but until that time until he come we want to live every day like he might come the next minute because it might be the end of your life at that minute you know after they found Michael Jackson dead you know what they went in his room and they found all this evil things on his computer now think about that this morning I thought Lord if people search my computer there's gonna find message stuff on there I wouldn't live so close to God that way if I die people go search around all they find is Jesus here Jesus on the computer Jesus in his backpack Jesus in his wall it sees this everywhere I praise God and there's no surprises then everybody knows that's one thing he was looking for he was looking for Jesus to come hey man we don't hide nothing they go looking in my my old boxes of high school with MIDI videos everything wherever they look my no newspapers no they'll just find that I was a true servant of God praise God you'll remember I'm called scrapbooks he said how he liked that look in the old scrapbooks in our lives look at all the pictures from we were growing up he said you don't know you're going this may be our last breath we have it in us now so we want to live like it is he said but to now carry on further we've got to put footprints here on the sands of times that others can see if Paul had it a wet on the way he did John would not have known how to follow God if John hadn't went on the way he did Polycarp would have known how to follow if Pollock heart would have went on Iranians would have known how to follow see what I mean each one has to put footprints on the sands of time that's why the message is by the RAM are so important because they show us how does a prophet of God walk in this hour right and then we can look at his life or at me I'll look at brother Neville's life right because he's a pastor I look at his life and say what kind of life what kind of footprints did he leave on the sands of time I want to follow in those footprints because I want to redeem the time because I know the days are evil and I want to understand what the will the Lord is I got a couple more things I want to share here go back to turn your Bibles in Matthew 6:33 let me read this summary again of seeking first the kingdom of God I want to read it again with the Greek definitions in there it's on the video that I put out today but just so you got it Matthew 6:33 in church of you get up in the morning early and see God I'm gonna pray that you do by God's grace I had to learn it it took me a while to learn it because I had to learn to crucify my flesh I used to boast even I used to love staying up late and boy I paid for it the next day I was exhausted and worn out and I paid for it it was never I realized I'd do much better in the morning when I started get up in the morning Matthew 6:33 yeah Matthew 6:30 seek ye first now seek ye first so aim that means aim or crave or strive crave first the kingdom of God now the kingdom Creek means the rule or dominance of the Holy Ghost baptism so crave first the rule or Dominion of the Holy Ghost in your soul desire first that my soul will be ruled by God's Spirit amen hallelujah and so seek the rule of the Holy Ghost in your soul and His righteousness that word means integrity which means you're always honest and always tell the truth so we're to seek to have more integrity in the morning I'm seeking the dominance and rule of the Holy Ghost and his integrity also means virtue where's it virtually just went out right like this oh there's virtue phrase Lord God misfortune so we're gonna seek Christ virtue I love that name it means purity correct acting so we're supposed to seek the rule of the Holy Ghost and correct acting that will have integrity and virtue in our life purity when you do that first not second and the church said I'm gonna say like today is that the second thing you seek church it's the first thing you seek first thing is aim for God's God's rule and dominion over your life and then also I'm gonna seek to be more have more integrity more purity for Christ that's what Jesus Christ said he's seek the spiritual needs first and I'll take care of the natural and all these things food drink and clothes that he mentions the previous verses will be added to you and the church said yeah that's the Greek summary of that word strive for aim aim at the kingdom of God I want to be part of the rule the holy spirit on earth and I want Christ's purity I want Christ's integrity my heart first and then people will see it when you go to work then your family will see it would come out of the other prayer closet right church they'll see it if you seek that first everything else to be given to you what a promise what a promise am i doing on time okay good alright okay that's right okay thank the Lord now I'm going to try to bring this down to close here just a moment so I hope stress that enough since I think January or the New Year's Eve service I preached on seeking first the kingdom of God that's right on New Year's Eve service we had communion and so forth I've been trying to major on it since then on just putting God first redeeming your time how you use your time shows what you are whether wise or foolish right and the reason people are wise because I got to receive the spirit of wisdom now let's close with these next few thoughts I'm gonna set timer here so don't go too much longer here okay I'll give it 10 more minutes here now verse 18 now I'm getting this right here this was now this is off this video it's a it's a it's a movement called the Bible project and I love it my it's one of the fun it's a fun but one of the most enjoyable things I like on YouTube that like they basically just they just summarized a book of the Bible and they'll draw pictures of it and then they'll zoom in on the pictures and they got this big scroll looks like a Bible and all the pictures it kind of gives visuals to the Bible ah say like that it's beautiful I love it it's just what a and it's all crowdfunded to so I like that too people are supporting it but in verse 18 Paul starts telling them this is how you walk in the spirit now we said it earlier right follow God don't fornicate don't be unclean don't be foolish suggesting and joking too much give thanks to God but then in verse 18 said be not drunk with wine so I guess people in the church battled drunkenness right your battle might be different it's probably different from mine some people in that church by the banging battle being drunk they battle that so Paul said instead of stealin give with your hands instead of getting drunk get food with the Holy Ghost yeah I like that amen instead of drinking the natural drink the spiritual one amen now how do you do that he tells us next I love this amen Lorie cuz I see it happening in our church I see brother Amen introducing new songs I see a blessing my life on a Wednesday night Naomi and Beatrice we can cry and worship God why because these songs they keep walking in the holy spirit where'd you get that from right here he's in Chapter five Paul selling these Holy Ghost for the Saints that listen don't get drunk on wine he said be drunk in the Holy Spirit I do that Paul now he gives a semicolon in verse 18 which means there's an answer to follow he says but be filled with the spirit and then he says here's how you do it verse 19 he said speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns let me pull this up real quick here I got I got some Greek definitions I just just bear with me just give me one minute here yeah speaking yourselves in Psalms I saw him in the Greek as a set a piece of music it's a sacred ode a sacred song or a hymn which is a religious ode one of the Psalms so they they're very similar definitions and spiritual which means supernatural songs which is a chance or ode singing and making melody melody means to play with string instruments right rather I love it praise God God gave us the strings in your heart right speak yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord Robin says a lot of people sing just to make their hear their own voices I hope you and I are not so impressed with our voice I hope we're singing so God's heart is touched amen you sing in your heart to the Lord because you know he's near you know his presence is there you know you're seated you know your your your night in your night to the blood amen you're not at him you're close to his blood you're close to a sacrifice amen you sing in your hearts unto the Lord how do I redeem the time brother Jesse start singing more in your heart and sing to one another right tell each other these songs but you tell tell tell each other oh I heard this new song it's a glorious song it's a spiritual song it's a supernatural song talks about God's miracles and walking on water least we'll see miracles amen we'll walk on water praise God see singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord so they're right if we want to walk in the Holy Spirit and make sure we're drunk on the Holy Spirit we got to sing together and we got to sing alone I started doing that last few weeks I just take my downloaded songs and I just sing I'm like goodness of God and His mercy is more and I'll just sing along I start my prayer now by singing along and I can feel it in my heart I can just feel happiness coming in my heart I'm like why did I do this sooner you know I guess you all go through ups and downs and I walk with the Lord but that's one way to make sure you walk in the Holy Spirit how many believe that remember in the days ahead Sakaya God told him just sing if you just sing the I'll overthrow the enemies praise God remember Paul and Silas they just started singing and God broke the prisoners chains amen that's important note God didn't always break the prisoners chains and the church said he wrote most of the Bible brother Steven from prison why didn't God why did he sing it ever well how come every time he didn't sing the prison walls didn't fall down because it was a time in season for everything see that the CNR human minds what do you want we want a magic pill we want a silver book oh all my problems we go on if I'll just do this the same way every time that's not how it is but that one time they sang the walls came down amen so see it God doesn't want us to make him an errand boy God doesn't want us to order him around but God wants us to sing genuine worship from our hearts unto him and then he will refresh our minds he'll refresh our spirits will feel like we're drunk in the spirit oh thank you lo out of the area did you know this boat motorman met a woman who had nervousness he said nervousness is a horrible thing keeps you tore up all the time of course she was born nervous imagine that born I read you're just nervous about everything nervous nervous all your life you've been nervous I see as a schoolgirl nervous nothing can help it and everybody says get next to yourself in other words can you imagine with a man all your life you'll saying stop being so nervous stop it I mean from a child your teachers to say Stephen stop being so never just pay attention just stop stop but you can't help it it's like you're it's just part of your human grab bag they say hey I inherit that from my dad I heard it from my mom but man says you've been nervous and I see in visions everybody even since your school girl tells you to stop being nervous stop stop stop stop stop but you can't help it he said well that don't do you no good can't help it sister there's something that frights you but Jesus Christ is here to take it from you he said do you believe it God as I lay my hands on this young lady in the prime of her life look she's a prime of her life 20s maybe I curse this affliction over her body so nervousness was a demon affliction over her body since a child he said I curse it she wants to serve you Lord and serve you in freedom church of you and I feel shackled something's wrong we need Jesus the son is free amen so he can be free and worship and love God and praise the Lord amen so it was wrong if we're not feeling free if we're feeling chained up and bound up like we looked at a couple weeks ago I take it away from her in the name of Jesus Christ may it go and never return again for God's glory amen he said now don't fear young lady will you do as I tell you now you feel all right at this time see because it's gone when you come up here there was a dark shadow around you it's gone now it scared you you can't help it it comes to you but look now the unclean spirits gone from you he walks in dry places he would try to return again but you just take my word as God's prophet don't you never have a frown on your face so if she wants to be free by the rain she's got to keep a smile on her face see a spirit will make you be angry a demon will make you be angry and overtake you make him feel like you're was life is so useless in a man I hate everybody you love your enemies right he said don't you never ever frown on your face seeing all day long and praise God no matter how you feel or what takes place it'll leave you and won't come no more now go and do that you believe that with all your heart how would I know that except God told me that hey I didn't tell you praise God look at the power of the Holy Spirit to make you smile people instead of feeling sorry for yourself I mean angry and upset and then if you want to keep that demon away brother bang just sing all day and what does Paul say here Paul says don't be drunk with wine be drunk with the spirit sing to each other and yourself and make melody in your heart to the Lord keep because the Bible said he inhabits the praises of his people he lives in that song a man his presence comes to annoy he comes a quick in that song amen well I've had many of those over the course these years we'll see and come thou fount of every blessing will sing be thou my vision the holy s--t rose just strike me and I feel his presence in that song praise God it's right now it's happening the goodness of God there's mercies more all these other songs but a man's been singing love ran red it happened to be there to praise God where you feel God's presence and you just want to show your love to God coz see you're not now you're not

you'll come by God's grace thank you maybe I'll get to the one I was telling by the Amen about yesterday I'll get to that one you know a purpose of our lives maybe tonight by God's grace how many want to be wise with that spirit of Revelation of wisdom oh that's awesome my heart's desire right now I just want to be so dedicated to the Lord that I just seek Him first search I've been a witness I've watched God just add to my life food clothes shelter money whatever I watch it if I just put God first he just gives me everything I need by his grace he wasn't lying when he said he'd pour out he'd open up the windows of heaven and pour out blessings praise God that you can't receive we've just got to put him first are we let's just bow our heads for a moment are we craving his righteousness are we craving and so hungry to have the Holy Ghost rule our lives because that's what Sikh means [Music] or we crave and Netflix more are we craving natural food my mom was telling me there's somebody in the church gonna die they're back home because they over ate they ate themselves to death and I remember the man I grew up I was a good man nice man he's on his deathbed brother vague because he ate himself to death I remember the family always had a trouble with that see cuz what does that show it shows they just can't get filled but see because they haven't been filled with the Holy Ghost because jesus said when you get filled with this you'll never thirst again amen you'll never hunger again cuz I am the bread of life amen I am the waters of life and he that drinks to me will never thirst again ha ha thank the Lord praise God what are we hungry for what are we craving for now with heads bowed how many raise your hands ago just pray for me that I could sing to the Lord more I can
