TRANSCRIPT
========================================
real i miss it all right let's go to matthew chapter 26 if you would god bless everybody it's going to be in the house of lord tonight i will try to watch it the lord winning matthew 26 55. i just want to read one verse and we'll try to preach hopefully 45 minutes and i want to look at doctrine again you know the power of jesus's doctrine and this is uh that's what i kind of like what i preached on sunday morning if you're able to watch the live stream there or the archive it's been a good a good study for me to kind of go through and see all the scriptures about jesus's doctrine and which really means jesus teaching so for us that'd be the more common word what kind of teacher was jesus what did he teach how often did he teach i think we'll be surprised uh you know by what we see here so matthew 26 55 matthew 26 55. and to me church the the main thought of this is how as we said on sunday morning anyone who's baptized with the holy ghost will be in the word all the way which means they'll be able to be taught as they grow older in the lord we see a lot of people that hang around churches but they don't get on fire for god actually get more lazy for god that proves they're not in the word all the way and i don't care what anybody says there's no way they're born again if you're not going deeper in the things of god falling more in love with jesus yes you're going to have trials yes you have struggles but if you have a continual hunger and thirst for righteousness that proves you've been filled with the holy spirit it's a proof of it so may the lord bless each one of you and this also proves to me that if god wants us to teach us if god wants to teach us more and more then that means there's more and more victories he wants us to gain there's more and more land to take right we have to have the attitude of where i'm not a know-it-all i don't know everything i want to be humble i want to grow in my understanding of god we've got to have that attitude as believers matthew 26 55 thank you for your patience here as i get there i'll set my timer now here and uh try to do i'll set it for 30 30 minutes we'll see how far we do there then we'll give a little closing there 26 55 matthew 26 55. i want you to notice this is jesus uh he's at uh he's being arrested here rather he's being arrested on the night of his arrest right the day before the crucifixion right and notice what he says is he's being arrested here in verse 55 in that same hour said jesus to the multitudes are ye come out as a thief i'm sorry as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me in other words why are you coming at me like i'm a thief you have swords and staves and he says i sat daily with you teaching in the temple and you laid no hold on me so he wasn't a thief he wasn't a type of guy you'd approach jesus and say oh this guy's a violent guy no the bible said he they saw him daily teaching where in the house of god he was about his father's business so when jesus was around that era jerusalem where would he be he'd be in the house of god when he wasn't there where was he was up in capernaum right in his northern residence up there he spent the majority of his ministry up in capernaum and the galilee area constantly teaching in the synagogues he was always in the synagogue as the bible said so every saturday brother austin he was always in church every saturday if it's saturday where's jesus he says he's over in the synagogue he's reading the scrolls he's teaching he's healing people hallelujah that was our savior verse 56 but all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled then all the disciples forsook him and fled imagine that being arrested and all your all your companions all your all your buddies all your best friends they all leave you jesus endured that and he did it with love in his heart as well for the joy that was before him he endured all this all this contradiction of sinners all this abandonment he endured all that because of the love that he had for you and i how many still see yourself as the disciple jesus loved let's bow our heads heavenly father we just love you we we give you praise we love you with all of our heart soul mind and strength lord jesus anoint me god for these few moments as we refocus on you and we give you this sacrifice of praise we've entered with thanksgiving we enter with praise oh god we give you the sacrifice of praise now speak to us through thy word thy holy word and i pray god you minister now in jesus christ's name and saint said amen hallelujah god bless you as you're being seated if jesus wants to teach you all the days of your life then that means he's interested in every detail of your life he wants you to be in the word all the way all the way to your 60 70 80 lord willing 90 even more lord willing a hundred then he must have so much knowledge that he can teach us and that must mean he wants to be a part of all of our day from the very beginning all the way to the wonderful parts you know all the way to the very end right hopefully it's all wonderful by god's grace but you understand what i'm saying i have a few slides here we'll look at this if you have your bibles go to matthew five go to back to matthew chapter five i uh on sunday morning i didn't really spend a lot of time on this but i want to spend i want to show you uh this is part two the power of jesus is doctrine in church it's power not just to do signs miracles and wonders that's part of it but it's also power to make you a daily faithful believer to make you an obedient humble christian to have the the mind of christ have the character of christ every day of your life that's power anybody can go to church and say amen on sunday but if you have the power of god you'll serve god on monday and tuesday and you'll go to church on wednesday you know right see you that's real power when you got it to do miracles because even the uh even the workers of iniquity have miracles they can temporarily meet god's requirements and they can approach god at a service and do a miracle but then the rest of their time they're workers of iniquity right like balaam we know that so that that's really power sometimes we misunderstand power right power uh the bible says power or brother man says power without a character is satanic so that proves it a power do miracles without the character of christ ends up with a worker of iniquity a person who's uh sent to hell who's lost who loves the iniquity more than righteousness so the real power of god is signs miracles and wonders but it's a daily life that wants to grow closer to god and wants to please him and wants his presence all throughout the day amen now we read our text here i'm just going to give you quickly 15 there's probably more i'm going to give you 15 doctrines where jesus taught in the sermon on the mount i think there was that show and my kids were talking about it the chosen they talked about how the sermon on the mount was like one of jesus's major sermons and no doubt it was it was a and they kind of pumped it up or not pumped it up but they kind of worked it up as this the message one of jesus greatest messages and no doubt it was but i'm not sure if people understand every time jesus said do something that's a doctrine because the word doctrine means instruction or command so a doctrine is anything you should do uh preaching is what god has done or will do okay so preaching is the rapture is coming soon praise god and god is healed god god always does miracles those are all that's all preaching but when it gets down to you need to repent and this is how you do it now we're on doctrine amen or this is how you get the holy ghost now we're on doctrine right because it's instruction it's teaching you how to obey so you can imagine here uh that that doctrine is very crucial i think doctrine is greater than what we understand it impacts as we said every detail of our life it ought to because it ought to teach us how to pray teach us how to serve teach us how to interact in our homes teach us how to behave on the on the job amen teaches how to love god at church it should impact every area of our life and there's power in it praise god now the first doctrine is how to be blessed in matthew 5 verses 3 through 12. so you want to be blessed the bible said be poor in spirit that means be humble in spirit right don't be exalted like i know everything or or i'm smarter than everybody that's the way to be cursed the way to be blessed is to be poor in spirit if you do that then you are part of the kingdom of heaven the bible says remember verse 4 how are you blessed mourn and then you'll be comforted see a lot of people won't mourn they'll drown their sorrows away with alcohol right or food or cigarettes or lustful living luxurious living whatever but it really is a blessed thing to mourn over natural things that we should mourn over deaths and sicknesses and all you know whatever whatever we must mourn over because then the bible says then we receive the comfort of the holy spirit verse 5 meek if you want to be blessed be meek for they inherit the earth praise god which very similar to poor in spirit uh verse six blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled praise god you wanna be filled with the holy ghost start hungering for the word right love the word say amen to the word amen hallelujah pray right seek god make that the the best part of your day the best part of your week being in the house of god being with the saints hunger and thirst after and jesus promised you'll be blessed and be filled by the holy ghost verse 7 blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy again this is how to be blessed how to this is doctrine uh verse 8 how are you blessed be pure in heart and you will see god of course that's in his favor you'll see god in his favor of course you'll see god in your life as well hallelujah if you are pure in heart verse 9 blessed are the peacemakers they should be called the children of god right don't stir people up to anger and arguing and fussing and debates but encourage them to have peace and say how can we how can we smooth this out i do it all day and i'm with six and seven-year-olds all day i'm i'm trying to be a peacemaker all day all right this one argue in that argument i'm like can we do we really have to do this but you know they're just learning i think about adults you know i think about people that you know manage over adults there's a lot of arguments in adults right right there's probably more but we should be peacemakers and verse 10 blessed are they when you're persecuted for righteous sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you okay so there's the first doctrine how to be blessed if jesus is speaking here on instructing you how to live that he's giving doctrine he's giving you the doctrine to be blessed how many want to be blessed how many want to be peacemakers tomorrow i want how many want to be merciful tomorrow praise god then act on jesus's commands now go to verse 22 but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause should be danger of the judgment and whosoever shall be in danger of the counsel i'm sorry whosoever shall say to his brother raqqa shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hell-fire here's the how-to on anger here's how to deal with anger do not have unjust anger with people if you have unjust anger with people then you have a murdering spirit on you that's what jesus says right and then if you have that murdering spirit on you you're likely not to repent and jesus said you're likely to go to hell if you can't forgive all because of anger so this is how to deal with anger the bible says you can be angry and not sin like we're going to see with jesus and the cords he was angry but he never sinned in fact we'll see it while he was with whipping them with the cord he was giving them doctrine amen hallelujah praise god that's what it is like today when we get when we start hammering on doctrine people don't like it right they they want because it offends them it makes them want to or makes them have to change their life if they're going to be a real believer people don't like that well that's okay it doesn't matter what the people like it's what god's children like amen and god's children will like it even though it's hard or difficult they'll say amen to every word of god all right that's the second doctrine the third doctrine is verse 23 therefore if i bring thy gift to the altar and therefore remembers that thy brother at the ought against thee leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift in other words if before you come to church try to make everything right before you come to church i know it's not always possible but try to do that before you give an offering or before you give your tithe before you try to do any service to god make sure your heart is right with god see that's how to how do i offer a real sacrifice jesus says this make sure you have no offenses toward anybody that way god will receive your sacrifice how many want god to receive your sacrifice i don't want to be like cain and give god an offering and then god says i don't even receive it that's what a lot of people do today they'll offer some who say well i went to church or where are they saying praises
