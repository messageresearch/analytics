[33:13] [Music]
[33:22] oh
[33:34] [Music]
[33:50] i was looking on this website and had a
[33:52] little questionable verse it said
[33:54] if i get there before you do coming for
[33:57] to carry me home i'll cut a hole
[33:59] and pull you through so i didn't really
[34:02] agree with that one so we didn't sing
[34:03] that one that's strange i'll cut a hole
[34:06] and pour you through oh
[34:08] we don't agree with that jesus is the
[34:10] only one that's going to bring us over
[34:11] to that side right
[34:14] so thank the lord for god's amazing
[34:15] grace
[34:17] we're going to ephesians 5 tonight by
[34:20] the grace of the lord
[34:27] ephesians 5 32 and we'll read our memory
[34:32] verse
[34:41] ephesians 5 32 let's read that together
[34:48] ephesians 5 32 1
[34:50] 2 3. this is a great mystery
[34:53] but i speak concerning christ and the
[34:56] church
[34:57] james 5 please james 5 7 and 8.
[35:09] a beautiful scripture here about
[35:14] the rapture the harvest and the former
[35:17] ladder rain
[35:25] ephesians i'm sorry james five seven
[35:28] eight let's read that on three
[35:29] one two three be patient
[35:32] therefore brethren unto the coming of
[35:35] the lord
[35:36] behold the husband that waiteth for the
[35:38] precious fruit of the earth
[35:40] and have long patience for it until he
[35:43] received the
[35:44] early and latter rain be also
[35:48] patient establish your hearts for the
[35:51] coming of the lord
[35:53] let's have one more word of prayer here
[35:54] let's ask the lord to give us patience
[35:58] and to receive as wheat plants to
[35:59] receive all the water
[36:02] to lay in the prince of the sun to come
[36:04] to maturity
[36:07] to unite with christ the word we see the
[36:09] world uniting
[36:11] being bound together in the tares but we
[36:14] want to unite to jesus christ so let's
[36:16] pray
[36:17] for that tonight heavenly father we
[36:18] gather in your mighty name lord god hear
[36:20] over
[36:21] the livestream god we just pray lord
[36:23] you'll do what you always do lord only
[36:25] you can do it come and
[36:27] preach lord god come and speak your word
[36:30] that
[36:30] by faith lord we can receive your
[36:32] promises lord god let it fall on good
[36:35] ground
[36:35] our duty lord is to make sure the ground
[36:38] is good a good honest and sincere heart
[36:41] lord god we're sincere tonight
[36:43] we love you lord god we're not wasting
[36:45] this moment lord god we're
[36:46] we're focused on this moment dear god
[36:49] and may good seed fall upon
[36:51] good ground here tonight father minister
[36:53] our church and anyone live streaming
[36:55] doesn't have a home church
[36:56] if they don't have a home church i pray
[36:58] you direct them to a home church lord
[37:00] they can have a pastor and a church
[37:01] family lord god
[37:03] and gather more as they see that day
[37:04] approaching lord god
[37:06] so i pray in jesus christ's name give us
[37:08] a portion of thy
[37:09] holy spirit lord a supply of the spirit
[37:12] as paul said dear god
[37:14] that we need to hear tonight father
[37:15] minister to us i pray
[37:17] in jesus christ's name saint said amen
[37:20] amen god bless you as you're being
[37:34] seated
[37:36] so tonight by god's grace we're looking
[37:37] at part six
[37:39] of the church the mystery of the church
[37:42] as the bride
[37:44] even this week i've got a few emails
[37:46] kind of criticizing this uh
[37:47] title of the sermon it's kind of hard to
[37:49] believe
[37:52] but it's a revelation they said they
[37:54] said the church is the mother not the
[37:55] bride
[37:57] and i said no i said the mother is new
[37:59] jerusalem
[38:01] we're not jesus's mother or jesus bride
[38:05] so no doubt and that just goes to show
[38:09] the reason there's confusion is because
[38:11] it's a mystery right
[38:13] and so the true saints have the
[38:16] revelation
[38:16] of the mystery if jesus christ calls
[38:19] himself
[38:20] the bridegroom and john the baptist
[38:22] calls himself a friend
[38:24] of the bridegroom then who's his bride
[38:27] is the church praise god we can see that
[38:29] clearly in the scripture
[38:32] so last wednesday night you know we left
[38:34] off with
[38:37] looking at different names of
[38:39] denominations and we actually showed how
[38:42] none of them could be the bride because
[38:44] they all disagree with
[38:46] 15 of paul's teachings and paul said
[38:50] the bride would obey christ in
[38:52] everything
[38:53] and paul said in romans 2 he said that
[38:57] the secrets of men's hearts will be uh
[39:00] judged by my gospel so let's read that
[39:02] again tonight we'll start with that one
[39:03] uh lydia malachi in case you can get
[39:05] your bibles here
[39:06] and have you read for us uh let me go to
[39:09] romans 2 16. i believe it's romans 2 16.
[39:14] maokai while we're there
[39:28] uh maokai can you go to ii chronicles 16
[39:32] 9 aca john 4 24.
[39:38] i just want to lay down a few scriptures
[39:39] here these are so critical
[39:42] to understanding the revelation of the
[39:44] mystery
[39:45] so may the holy spirit write these on
[39:49] the fleshly tables of our hearts by the
[39:50] holy spirit
[39:52] so this first scripture is where paul
[39:54] says all men secrets will be judged by
[39:56] his gospel think about that every secret
[39:59] a person would have whether they
[40:01] lied or lusted or stole
[40:05] or destroyed someone's character
[40:09] any secret they would have is going to
[40:12] be judged according to paul's gospel
[40:14] the bible says liars and adulterers and
[40:16] whoremongers
[40:18] thieves will not inherit the kingdom of
[40:19] god they'll all be judged by paul's
[40:22] gospel so lydia go ahead romans i
[40:25] believe it's 2
[40:25] 16 in the day when
[40:29] when god shall judge the secrets of men
[40:31] by jesus christ according to my gospel
[40:33] amen so paul makes it very plain there's
[40:36] going to be a day think of that there's
[40:37] going to be a day
[40:39] when every secret is going to be judged
[40:42] by paul's gospel and we know if we read
[40:45] galatians 1
[40:46] it's not paul's as far as his own
[40:49] thoughts
[40:50] it was his dispensation right it was his
[40:53] stewardship that's what the word
[40:54] dispensation means the stewardship
[40:57] he was to take the gospel to the
[40:59] gentiles
[41:00] thank you lydia so every church then
[41:04] all those churches that claim to be
[41:05] christ churches we'll go over it again
[41:08] here
[41:08] uh roman catholic protestant
[41:11] uh eastern orthodox anglican oriental
[41:14] orthodox
[41:15] and all the other ones baptist
[41:18] methodists
[41:19] seven day advance adventists mormons
[41:21] jehovah's witnesses
[41:23] pentecostals none of them can be the
[41:26] bride because they all
[41:27] break some of paul's commands or they
[41:29] disregard them or do away with them
[41:31] or add to them so the bride won't do
[41:35] that
[41:35] she won't add or take away she'll keep
[41:38] every command
[41:39] of her lord her husband jesus christ
[41:42] now i just want to look at a few
[41:43] scriptures here that tell you um
[41:49] any person who's in one of those
[41:51] organizations we name that
[41:53] really is hungry and thirsty for
[41:55] righteousness god is
[41:56] god will search for them and then draw
[41:59] them out of denominations because the
[42:00] bible said come out of her
[42:02] my people the mother harlot come out of
[42:04] the mother harlot roman catholic church
[42:06] and we know she has daughters according
[42:07] to revelation chapter 2.
[42:10] so these scriptures show god is
[42:11] searching the earth to find any
[42:14] member who really wants to be the bride
[42:16] of jesus christ
[42:18] married to christ in everything so
[42:20] malcolm go ahead
[42:21] second chronicles 16 verse 9 for the
[42:24] eyes of the lord run to and fro
[42:25] throughout the whole earth to show
[42:27] himself strong in the behalf of them
[42:29] whose heart
[42:30] is perfect for him amen so no one on the
[42:32] face of the earth has to wonder
[42:34] can god see me can god reach me his eyes
[42:36] go
[42:37] all around the world praise god this
[42:39] world's a small thing compared to an
[42:41] almighty
[42:41] infinite all-knowing omnipotent
[42:44] omniscient
[42:45] eternal god so thank god he's with us
[42:48] praise god he's with us he's with
[42:50] uh africa he's worth he's with europe
[42:52] and antarctica even the arctic he's
[42:54] everywhere
[42:54] thank god he's with us praise god acacia
[42:59] john 4 24 and 20 sorry 23 and 24
[43:04] but the hour cometh and now is when the
[43:07] true worshipers shall worship the father
[43:09] in spirit and truth for the father
[43:12] seeking such to worship him
[43:14] god is a spirit and they that worship
[43:16] and must worship him in
[43:18] him and spirit and truth wonderful so we
[43:20] see again god
[43:21] is seeking true worshipers how's he
[43:23] doing that the eyes of the lord
[43:25] are going around the earth we can say
[43:26] that's the holy spirit the church book
[43:29] brother branham said that's
[43:30] god's messengers his eyes
[43:33] uh go around the the earth preachers
[43:37] right
[43:38] angelus go around the world when god
[43:41] sends a pastor
[43:42] they're the lord the fire of the lord
[43:46] so there god is seeking true worshipers
[43:48] now i have another one
[43:49] acts 10 verse 35.
[43:53] that's what it was 34-35 then peter
[43:56] opened his mouth and said of the truth i
[43:57] perceive
[43:58] god is no respecter of persons but in
[44:01] every nation he that feareth him
[44:03] and worketh righteousness is accepted
[44:06] with him so see every nation right every
[44:09] nation
[44:10] jesus said take the gospel and preach it
[44:11] to every nation for a witness
[44:14] and then the end shall come see god is
[44:17] constantly searching the earth he's
[44:18] seeking he's moving
[44:20] and he's constantly striving with man as
[44:22] we looked at last week he's striving
[44:23] he's pleading with them
[44:25] uh to accept all of his word and the
[44:28] bible says any man that fears god
[44:31] and does righteous works god will accept
[44:33] him
[44:34] any nation so thank god for that no
[44:36] matter where you live
[44:38] uh as long as you're fearing god and
[44:39] doing the right things
[44:41] god will accept you praise god what a
[44:43] great testimony for justification isn't
[44:45] that
[44:47] that shows the person's justified when
[44:49] they respect god
[44:51] they've no doubt repented they're trying
[44:53] to do the right thing
[44:54] god accepts them there his amen
[44:59] now
[45:02] i take a few paragraphs and look at who
[45:05] is the bride and where she's located we
[45:07] kind of went through who she is
[45:08] she's the one that keeps all the word of
[45:11] god
[45:12] uh she's in the all other categories
[45:14] right in the uh
[45:16] pew research centers uh
[45:19] counting of church members but scripture
[45:22] is clear that
[45:24] uh where is she she's all around the
[45:26] world
[45:27] jesus says some will be sleeping when
[45:29] the rapture takes place
[45:30] oh what a great night that would be
[45:32] right to go to bed
[45:33] and wake up and it's not a dream but
[45:37] you're in the presence of jesus christ
[45:38] brother amen has had dreams about jesus
[45:40] and different ones have had dreams about
[45:42] jesus
[45:43] but if it's the rapture that won't be a
[45:45] dream it won't end
[45:46] the bible says then we'll forever be
[45:48] with the lord praise god
[45:51] some will be working in a field some
[45:53] will be grinding at the mill
[45:55] some of our uh brothers and sisters
[45:58] that still grind their uh grind their
[46:00] meal by god's grace
[46:04] so see she's all around the world so it
[46:06] may be night and maybe morning
[46:08] but she's not located in one location
[46:11] physically
[46:12] she's spiritually located in christ
[46:15] by the baptism of the holy spirit she
[46:18] doesn't have one church name like
[46:19] jehovah's witnesses or mormons or
[46:21] catholics they're not all wise virgin
[46:25] churches or holy ghost filled churches
[46:27] or bible-believing churches
[46:29] she has no official name but she does
[46:31] have a spiritual name that's mrs
[46:33] lord jesus christ and the bible says the
[46:36] whole family of god has this name in
[46:38] ephesians
[46:39] chapter 3 verses 14 and 15.
[46:43] now remember she's made of both jew and
[46:44] gentile because the bride has to be made
[46:46] out of
[46:46] every nation under heaven so a few jews
[46:49] will
[46:50] by god's grace not have the spiritual
[46:52] blinders on
[46:53] and they'll be able to have eyes that
[46:55] can see their messiah
[46:58] although ancestors missed it 2 000 years
[47:00] ago
[47:01] they'll be able to see it and they'll be
[47:02] part of the bokeh bride
[47:04] from every nation
[47:07] this church the bride is organized by
[47:11] the holy spirit
[47:12] through her heavenly headquarters
[47:14] there's no physical headquarters
[47:16] uh according to paul's apostolic pattern
[47:20] the fightful ministry all has gifts from
[47:23] jesus from
[47:24] heaven they all when he ascended the
[47:26] gifts descended right through the holy
[47:28] spirit
[47:29] so that's how jesus keeps everyone in
[47:32] the world who's in the bride
[47:33] in one accord not by a man on earth but
[47:36] by
[47:37] the god-man in heaven no earthly
[47:40] headquarters
[47:41] there's no man-made control over the
[47:44] bride of jesus christ
[47:45] like brother graham said she's an
[47:47] independent woman she's independent from
[47:49] satan
[47:49] she's independent from man-made creeds
[47:52] she's fully dependent upon jesus christ
[47:54] amen
[47:58] now let's look at tonight we'll start
[48:00] looking at some of the eight
[48:03] old testament women who foreshadowed the
[48:06] rapture
[48:07] of the bride of jesus christ the jew
[48:09] gentile church
[48:10] now we went over one when we preached
[48:12] part one
[48:14] on a sunday night and you probably
[48:15] remember we looked at esther right we
[48:17] looked at esther
[48:20] so we probably won't get to that one
[48:22] tonight we probably skipped through most
[48:23] of it anyway just maybe rehearse a few
[48:25] things
[48:26] about that now there of course could be
[48:29] more than eight
[48:30] no doubt there's probably more than
[48:31] eight
[48:33] but these are the eight as i studied and
[48:35] prayed and waited on the lord
[48:36] for the few weeks that i wrote this
[48:38] chapter uh these are the eight that kind
[48:40] of came
[48:40] to my mind and my thinking and the bible
[48:42] said the holy ghost will bring all
[48:44] things to remembrance so
[48:46] all that god ordained to bring to my
[48:48] memory i believe came to my memory
[48:51] now i just want to read this as a great
[48:53] reminder here look at the
[48:55] uh the amazing prophecy here
[48:58] that we see so lydia amos 9
[49:03] verses 11 and 12. maokai acts 15 verse
[49:06] 14.
[49:07] look at the amazing uh rich
[49:11] truth that god hides in prophecy
[49:15] like we already looked at a few months
[49:16] ago with galatians 3 where
[49:19] paul says paul's quoting genesis 12 and
[49:23] says that in
[49:24] abraham's seed all nations will be
[49:26] blessed showing that gentiles
[49:28] can have faith and be justified by faith
[49:31] in jesus christ but if you just read
[49:33] genesis 12
[49:34] you wouldn't see that you would just say
[49:36] all families of the earth will be
[49:38] blessed through abraham
[49:39] so in other words god hides deep rich
[49:42] spiritual truths
[49:44] treasures in these old testament
[49:46] scriptures
[49:47] and i love it god's the only one who can
[49:49] interpret his word just like with
[49:50] brother ramsey thus saith the lord
[49:51] prophecies
[49:52] god is the only one who can interpret
[49:54] that we have men today that think they
[49:56] can interpret
[49:56] well they can't unless they're anointed
[49:58] by the holy spirit they'll get it wrong
[50:00] every time and i say that with love
[50:02] because i prayed for those people with
[50:03] tears
[50:05] to repent but god is the only one who
[50:07] can interpret those
[50:09] thus saith the lord's
[50:13] so now let's look here
[50:16] before we start let's remember what
[50:18] beautiful truth god hides
[50:21] in the depths of the riches of his
[50:23] prophecies so lydia
[50:24] amos 9 11 and 12.
[50:28] in that day will i raise up the
[50:30] tabernacle of david that has fallen and
[50:32] close up the breaches thereof
[50:33] and i will raise up his ruins and i will
[50:35] build it as in the days of old
[50:37] that they may possess the remnant of
[50:40] edom and of all the heathen which are
[50:41] called by my name
[50:42] saith the lord that does this amen so
[50:45] the scripture is talking about
[50:46] israel right then it talks about those
[50:48] of edom which is
[50:50] gentile just listening to that or just
[50:54] reading that would
[50:54] would you think that scripture would
[50:56] mean god is gonna put
[50:58] put a pause on israel for two thousand
[51:00] years to pull out a gentile bride
[51:02] no no it doesn't say it doesn't say
[51:04] anything close to that
[51:06] but god hid deep treasures in there god
[51:09] there was glorious truth in there that
[51:12] god was gonna
[51:13] blind the jews because they rejected him
[51:15] and pull out a gentile bride
[51:18] so malachi's got this scripture in acts
[51:21] 15 verse 14
[51:23] saint james is the one who recognizes
[51:25] this
[51:26] scripture i believe if i'm not mistaken
[51:28] it could be barnabas
[51:30] this is james okay yeah sorry about that
[51:33] james is the one who recognizes
[51:35] that god was going to god prophesied and
[51:38] foretold he was going to open up
[51:40] a door of faith to the gentiles so now
[51:43] can i read that for us bless you
[51:45] sirian hath declared how god at the
[51:48] first to visit the gentiles to take out
[51:50] of them as people for his name
[51:53] amen very simple that's why uh
[51:56] the bride is known as mrs lord jesus
[51:59] christ the whole family in heaven earth
[52:00] is named the lord jesus christ proving
[52:02] that's the name of god
[52:04] the lord jesus christ jesus is jehovah
[52:07] our salvation praise god
[52:12] so i just want to lay that in there
[52:13] again so you can see that
[52:15] that this was four told 2 000 years i
[52:18] remember we went through the scriptures
[52:19] already about
[52:20] um i think a couple sermons ago about
[52:22] there was days
[52:24] that god was gonna keep israel silent
[52:26] and then after after two days
[52:28] uh after two thousand years god would
[52:30] return to israel right
[52:32] i think we looked at that uh in part two
[52:34] if i'm not mistaken or part one
[52:36] the scripture i believe was hosea i
[52:37] believe it was hosea where the bible
[52:39] says that
[52:41] so if you put amos and hosea together
[52:43] and all these scriptures together you
[52:45] see god is going to
[52:46] blind israel for two thousand years pull
[52:48] out and rescue a gentile bride
[52:51] now here's the eight sarah rebecca
[52:54] azinath rahab samson's bride from
[52:58] timnath that's five
[52:59] ruth esther solomon's wife the shulamite
[53:03] and that's eight by god's grace no doubt
[53:05] there's more
[53:07] that's the ones and we've already looked
[53:09] at esther a little bit
[53:11] so tonight we'll just go right through
[53:12] order we'll just start with sarah here
[53:15] and we'll look at her we'll have a few
[53:17] scriptures to read in just a moment
[53:23] but generally we know the story of sarah
[53:25] we know a lot about her she's the wife
[53:26] of
[53:27] abraham and she bore isaac at 90 years
[53:30] old
[53:32] and it's such a beautiful example
[53:36] i was thinking about that today how
[53:41] in genesis 18
[53:44] sarah is laughing saying shall i have
[53:46] pleasure with my lord right
[53:48] how am i going to never have a child i
[53:50] we don't even have any we
[53:52] don't we're not even in a family
[53:53] relationship anymore it's impossible
[53:57] and then a few chapters later in chapter
[54:00] uh
[54:01] 20 king abimelech wants to marry her
[54:05] because she's so beautiful
[54:09] so it proves there's a mystery laying in
[54:11] there
[54:12] that just you know chapters before she
[54:15] was an old woman
[54:16] and slowly but surely she started
[54:18] changing and
[54:20] life started coming back to her so much
[54:22] that it came on to mary a beautiful
[54:23] woman named sarah
[54:26] oh it's so awesome how god hides his
[54:28] revelation in the scripture
[54:30] beautiful and so sarah types
[54:35] uh the old jew gentile church she types
[54:38] the
[54:39] uh the church that it's it would seem
[54:41] impossible
[54:42] that she could bring forth life right it
[54:45] seems impossible this woman this old
[54:47] woman
[54:48] this 2000 year old church right
[54:51] impossible how could this church
[54:53] at this old state have a body change
[54:57] impossible but with god all things will
[55:00] be possible praise god
[55:03] nothing shall be impossible with the
[55:05] lord is anything too hard for the lord
[55:08] the lord told abraham
[55:11] so isaac birth then foretells
[55:14] jesus's second coming to earth because
[55:17] both are promised sons that come on the
[55:19] scene
[55:20] right and isaac's birth happened
[55:24] about the same time like right after
[55:26] sodom's destruction
[55:28] so we see the destruction of the
[55:30] homosexual community
[55:32] and the coming of the promised son
[55:35] uh the an impossible emerging of a
[55:39] promised son
[55:40] all linked together right and this fits
[55:42] jesus describing the end time
[55:44] in luke 17 verses 28 through 30.
[55:48] he said it would occur at a time when
[55:51] the world was again
[55:52] in sodomite conditions right as it was
[55:54] in the days of lot
[55:56] here we are at the end time again so we
[55:59] see those
[56:00] two events closely associated together
[56:02] right the destruction of sodom
[56:04] the mob rule like they they're a bunch
[56:07] of
[56:08] the mob mentality on twitter trying to
[56:10] shut people down and
[56:11] on facebook trying to shut people down
[56:14] let them do it
[56:14] mercy god will make a way god god's word
[56:17] will get
[56:18] where it needs to go by his grace no one
[56:20] can stop the power of our god
[56:22] no one can stop eternal prophecy
[56:26] foretold before the foundation of the
[56:28] world written in heaven
[56:30] and then written by man upon the earth
[56:31] no one can stop the mind of god
[56:34] his plan cannot be stopped
[56:37] praise god all right so we see
[56:41] sarah as this type of a woman
[56:44] now let's get the scripture um acacia
[56:47] romans 4 19
[56:49] just a beautiful scripture here and then
[56:52] lydia
[56:53] can you get uh first corinthians 15 51
[56:56] and 52.
[56:58] so i want to i want casio to read this
[57:00] scripture it's so suitable
[57:03] which tells us why sarah was laughing so
[57:05] romans 4 19 whenever you're ready
[57:10] and being that weak in faith he
[57:12] considered not his
[57:13] own body now dead when he was about
[57:17] 100 years old neither yet the
[57:20] deadness of sarah's world thank you
[57:25] i just gotta write this down here
[57:32] all right so we see the scripture the
[57:34] deadness of her womb she realized she
[57:37] knew that's why she laughed at god
[57:39] and god said no you did laugh don't lie
[57:43] she knew her womb was dead impossible
[57:45] that's why hagar you know take hagar
[57:49] so sarah's womb was dead impossible to
[57:51] conceive
[57:53] right so god had to change her body
[57:56] so much so that she could travel down to
[57:58] career i forget how many miles that was
[58:00] now i think it was
[58:02] i think it was 90. i could be wrong on
[58:04] that but it was quite a trip
[58:06] on camel for a 90 or 89 or 85 year old
[58:09] woman
[58:10] and she must have been a he must have
[58:13] got some new looks right must have got
[58:14] some new
[58:15] vitality and new health through the
[58:17] power of the holy spirit
[58:20] and her so her womb was dead she needed
[58:22] a body change that's exactly what the
[58:24] scripture calls
[58:25] the rapture lydia first corinthians 15
[58:28] 51-52
[58:31] behold i show you a mystery we shall not
[58:33] all sleep but we shall all be changed
[58:36] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[58:38] at the last trump for the trumpet shall
[58:39] sound then the dead shall be raised
[58:41] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[58:43] amen the promise is we shall be changed
[58:46] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye it
[58:49] looks like sarah's change was slow and
[58:51] steady doesn't it looks like it's just
[58:52] slow
[58:53] uh maybe she traveled after the the
[58:55] visitation of the holy spirit
[58:57] uh left with the two messengers went
[59:00] down beside him
[59:01] just seemed like it was a slow change
[59:04] but the bible said our change will be
[59:07] instant
[59:08] this death will be swallowed up in life
[59:11] praise god now we're thankful that in
[59:14] our soul we've already had
[59:17] a change right from death unto life the
[59:19] bible said we're quickened or
[59:21] made alive by the holy spirit in our
[59:24] souls praise god we've already had
[59:26] a portion of life come into us
[59:29] hallelujah
[59:30] the new birth amen jesus said my words
[59:33] are spirit and they are
[59:35] life the word of god brings life to the
[59:38] soul
[59:41] so see our bodies must be changed to be
[59:43] christ in the air just like sarah's body
[59:45] had to be
[59:46] changed to bring forth the promised son
[59:49] with god or things are possible sarah
[59:53] doubted god's promise
[59:57] but god kept his word we're so thankful
[1:00:00] that
[1:00:00] god is the one who keeps the word i just
[1:00:03] had an interesting thought tonight maybe
[1:00:05] i
[1:00:05] thought this before and forgot it i must
[1:00:06] have forgot it but
[1:00:08] let's go to genesis 18 here
[1:00:19] let's look at this visit again
[1:00:26] i just want to
[1:00:30] look at this thought again here
[1:00:43] and they're looking for the wrong word
[1:00:45] here genesis
[1:00:48] three angels come down god is one of
[1:00:50] them and then there's two other
[1:00:52] just regular angels they come and visit
[1:00:58] and uh we know that god
[1:01:02] discerns sarah's heart she's uh behind
[1:01:05] the tent right not in the room
[1:01:08] and uh god says in verse 10 he said i
[1:01:12] will certainly return unto thee
[1:01:14] according to the time of life and lo
[1:01:16] sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[1:01:18] sarah heard in the in the tent door
[1:01:20] which was behind him now abraham and
[1:01:22] sarah were old and well stricken with
[1:01:23] age
[1:01:24] and it ceased to be with sarah after the
[1:01:26] manner of women
[1:01:27] therefore sarah laughed within herself
[1:01:29] saying am i waxed old
[1:01:30] sorry after i'm waxed old shall i have
[1:01:32] pleasure my lord being old also and the
[1:01:34] lord said to abram
[1:01:35] wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i
[1:01:38] of a surety very child which
[1:01:39] am old now this is such a beautiful
[1:01:42] portion of scripture for us who follow
[1:01:44] the message of william branham
[1:01:46] because in this scripture we can see
[1:01:49] that the bride sarah represents the
[1:01:52] brighter church of the new testament
[1:01:55] god is represented by the holy spirit
[1:01:57] that anointed brother branham to give
[1:01:59] the gift of discernment
[1:02:01] right so here the the lord discerns
[1:02:03] sarah's heart and he's
[1:02:05] and he's stan and she's about standing
[1:02:07] behind him not even in the tent
[1:02:08] right and so she just he discerns the
[1:02:11] thoughts and intents
[1:02:12] of her heart it's exactly what the
[1:02:14] ministry of brother branham did
[1:02:16] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[1:02:18] the heart so much so brother branham
[1:02:20] said thus saith the lord
[1:02:22] he said the gentiles have received their
[1:02:24] last and greatest sign
[1:02:25] he said call me a false prophet if you
[1:02:27] ever see a greater sign than his
[1:02:29] discernment
[1:02:30] to the gentile people we haven't seen
[1:02:32] anything close to it
[1:02:34] in fact i watched a video where they now
[1:02:35] have a google profit
[1:02:39] it's so fake he gets on his smartphone
[1:02:41] he goes on people's facebook's account
[1:02:43] uh you know some of his friends meet
[1:02:45] people out there and then before the
[1:02:46] service they let know their names
[1:02:48] and he says he discerns them uh through
[1:02:51] notes he took on their smartphone but
[1:02:52] he's actually looking at their facebook
[1:02:54] accounts and
[1:02:55] supposedly telling them secrets and it's
[1:02:58] so fake it's so
[1:02:59] uh it's such a false
[1:03:02] impersonation right but brother ram
[1:03:04] didn't have a smartphone
[1:03:06] brother ram didn't have human sparks he
[1:03:08] had the smarts of the holy spirit praise
[1:03:09] god he had the wisdom of the holy spirit
[1:03:11] the discernment of god to tell people
[1:03:14] the very secrets the thoughts intents of
[1:03:16] their heart
[1:03:17] true gift of god never missed like all
[1:03:20] the prophets we talked about the
[1:03:21] so-called prophets they missed
[1:03:23] on coronavirus they missed on the riots
[1:03:25] they missed on
[1:03:26] the election they missed on everything
[1:03:29] because they're not called of god
[1:03:31] and they're doing evil i want you to
[1:03:34] just notice there
[1:03:36] in verse 10 i just had this little
[1:03:38] thought i may have preached it before
[1:03:40] but the holy spirit seemed to bring to
[1:03:43] my mind that
[1:03:44] this was the first visitation but there
[1:03:46] was going to be another because he said
[1:03:48] surly
[1:03:48] he said certainly i'll return according
[1:03:50] to the time of life
[1:03:52] so in other words there was two
[1:03:55] visitations
[1:03:56] and that should remind us of the former
[1:03:59] and latter rain right amen
[1:04:01] brother branham said his ministry was
[1:04:02] the teaching rain or former rain
[1:04:05] so this is the former rain the first
[1:04:07] visitation
[1:04:08] but then the latter rain what happens
[1:04:11] body change
[1:04:12] amen hallelujah the latter rain is the
[1:04:16] body change the second visitation
[1:04:18] i believe it's chapter 21
[1:04:21] yes 21 verse 1 and the lord visited
[1:04:24] sarah in the latter rain
[1:04:26] as he had said and the lord did unto
[1:04:28] sarah as he had spoken hallelujah
[1:04:31] so i got another scripture i need to add
[1:04:32] that to my notes for the book by god's
[1:04:34] grace
[1:04:35] there's another former and latter rain
[1:04:37] two visitations
[1:04:39] bless you so we're thankful
[1:04:43] somehow the angel maybe an angel will
[1:04:45] visit with the anointing of the holy
[1:04:46] spirit maybe to be the holy spirit
[1:04:48] himself maybe
[1:04:48] we're not sure but we know there's a
[1:04:50] laddering to come it's thus saith the
[1:04:52] lord brother man told us out of joel 2
[1:04:55] 23-26 that's our vision that's what
[1:04:57] we're longing for that's what we're
[1:04:58] praying for
[1:04:59] that's what we're laboring for here out
[1:05:01] in the vineyard praise god
[1:05:02] we're in the vineyard of akron ohio
[1:05:04] right laboring out in the vineyard where
[1:05:06] the 11th hour workers
[1:05:08] we gotta just gotta keep laboring he
[1:05:10] promised to send another rain praise god
[1:05:13] amen and we're gonna work to that rain
[1:05:15] comes amen
[1:05:17] and then the last thought was remember
[1:05:19] hebrews 11
[1:05:22] the bible said that sarah received
[1:05:24] strength oh my
[1:05:25] that anointing is going to be so strong
[1:05:28] it's going to give us the strength we
[1:05:29] need
[1:05:30] for a body change just like sarah
[1:05:33] received the strength for the womb to
[1:05:35] come back to life and the eggs and
[1:05:37] everything on the inside and
[1:05:39] everything inside we had to receive life
[1:05:42] again
[1:05:43] and god did it by his amazing grace
[1:05:46] george that's what we're going to
[1:05:47] receive
[1:05:47] and isn't it something that you know in
[1:05:50] our own human thinking it may seem
[1:05:51] impossible how is god
[1:05:53] i don't even know we might say i don't
[1:05:54] even have faith to heal too thick or i
[1:05:56] don't even have faith to do this it may
[1:05:57] seem impossible
[1:05:59] but sarah you're part of abraham praise
[1:06:01] god right
[1:06:02] church you're part of christ you're part
[1:06:04] of the father right
[1:06:06] you're children of abraham because you
[1:06:08] keep the commands of god
[1:06:10] and god will prove it to you by his
[1:06:12] visitation we're expecting god to visit
[1:06:15] us so i hope it happens in my lifetime
[1:06:16] by god's grace amen
[1:06:19] we see the former rain we see the former
[1:06:21] visitation of the teaching rain
[1:06:23] teaching the people teaching them the
[1:06:25] word revelations
[1:06:27] mysteries finished right the teaching
[1:06:29] reign
[1:06:30] perhaps we're still under it but the
[1:06:32] reality is there's coming a ladder rain
[1:06:34] to finish it
[1:06:35] where the body gets changed thank god
[1:06:37] for the visitation of the holy spirit
[1:06:40] that is to come all right let's go to
[1:06:43] rebecca here
[1:06:44] years ago i preached on rebecca i
[1:06:45] remember when kevin and marie were
[1:06:47] coming they were really enjoying that
[1:06:48] little series there on rebecca now this
[1:06:52] is in genesis 24 i believe the whole
[1:06:53] story is in genesis 24.
[1:06:56] rebecca is espoused and married to isaac
[1:06:59] in
[1:07:00] in there and it types the spiritual
[1:07:02] espousal and heavenly marriage to christ
[1:07:04] the bridegroom
[1:07:05] remember second corinthians 11 3 says
[1:07:07] paul had espoused the corinthians to one
[1:07:10] husband
[1:07:10] even christ so we see a spousals
[1:07:15] represent uh natural spouses represent
[1:07:18] being engaged to jesus christ the new
[1:07:21] testament church
[1:07:24] all right now eliezer abraham's chief
[1:07:27] servant
[1:07:29] was guided by the holy spirit to find a
[1:07:32] suitable wife
[1:07:33] for isaac was it an easy journey
[1:07:37] and he was under great pressure great
[1:07:39] strain right
[1:07:40] but the word got where it needed to go
[1:07:43] praise god
[1:07:44] amen what did it go to the big crowds
[1:07:46] children
[1:07:48] did you go to the big cities no just
[1:07:50] went to a little humble
[1:07:52] place right where rebecca's there and
[1:07:54] she's able to to answer
[1:07:56] the prayer of eliezer through the holy
[1:07:58] spirit that's what it is today but god
[1:08:00] said brother branham just some humble
[1:08:02] family praise god
[1:08:03] there's some humble groups right of
[1:08:05] course yeah he let him all know around
[1:08:07] the world but
[1:08:08] towards the end of his ministry when he
[1:08:09] realized he was the alleys remember
[1:08:12] the last time he said he'd uh he just
[1:08:15] opened up his bible and pointed in 1965
[1:08:17] the holy spirit took him to genesis 24
[1:08:20] where he's the eliezer to get a bride
[1:08:22] for isaac
[1:08:26] and so we know brother branham was the
[1:08:28] eliezer
[1:08:29] to get us ready to meet isaac or christ
[1:08:34] right now once a rebecca's found and
[1:08:38] accepts a marriage proposal
[1:08:40] eliezer gives her gifts of valuable
[1:08:42] jewelry this types the gifts of the holy
[1:08:44] ghost praise god
[1:08:46] so the church needs to have the gifts in
[1:08:49] operation and we looked at them on
[1:08:51] sunday a little bit uh
[1:08:53] in a prayer we had a prayer request and
[1:08:55] come up after service
[1:08:57] and we looked at them on faith and
[1:08:59] wisdom and knowledge and
[1:09:01] and faith and healing and miracles and
[1:09:04] prophecy and tongues interpretations all
[1:09:06] these wonderful gifts
[1:09:08] discernment we see them
[1:09:11] from time to time as they operate we
[1:09:13] thank god for it
[1:09:15] and this bride has all of them praise
[1:09:17] god amen
[1:09:18] the bride of jesus christ has all of
[1:09:20] them praise god i'm speaking of the
[1:09:21] collective bride of jesus christ
[1:09:24] imagine if we went through our church
[1:09:25] and really went down each and every one
[1:09:27] i imagine we'd see
[1:09:28] examples of all of them no doubt
[1:09:35] of course uh eliezer wants to go right
[1:09:37] back after he finds rebecca she agrees
[1:09:41] and she and her maidens make the long
[1:09:44] journey
[1:09:46] i believe there was 10 of them wasn't
[1:09:47] there that types of 10 virgins i believe
[1:09:49] if not mistaken
[1:09:52] and uh on our way back she's carried by
[1:09:54] camels right and camel symbolizes the
[1:09:56] power of the holy ghost
[1:09:58] uh that will carry us to meet our
[1:10:00] bridegroom
[1:10:02] and we just got to keep feeding that
[1:10:03] power right we just got to keep
[1:10:05] blessing that power loving and catering
[1:10:08] to that power right serving that power
[1:10:09] of the holy spirit
[1:10:10] focusing on the power of the holy spirit
[1:10:15] and as we do that that's feeding our
[1:10:17] souls the word of god that will empower
[1:10:19] us
[1:10:20] uh we'll receive the strength right to
[1:10:22] meet our heavenly bridegroom
[1:10:26] and then we see the final type here is
[1:10:29] rebecca
[1:10:30] meeting isaac out in the field
[1:10:33] they don't meet in the tent they don't
[1:10:35] meet in the heavenly house rather
[1:10:37] they don't meet on the road they meet
[1:10:40] out in the field
[1:10:41] and this types meeting christ not in
[1:10:43] heaven or on earth
[1:10:45] but meeting christ in the air praise god
[1:10:52] so that's a really quick go through
[1:10:56] through the the life of rebecca by god's
[1:10:58] grace how am i doing on time
[1:10:59] okay
[1:11:04] so we've been through that before but i
[1:11:05] just wanted to go through that quickly
[1:11:07] here
[1:11:07] now let's go to the next example azinath
[1:11:09] wife of joseph
[1:11:14] let's read this by god's grace
[1:11:23] actually i'm just going to kind of go
[1:11:24] through this one rather quickly again i
[1:11:25] kind of want to end with rahab that's
[1:11:27] kind of what i
[1:11:27] i want to end with i've been listening
[1:11:29] to as i was with moses
[1:11:31] and brother brown mentions rahab a
[1:11:32] number of times but let's just go
[1:11:34] through this briefly
[1:11:35] as an aph the egyptian wife of joseph
[1:11:38] types the new testament church
[1:11:42] her status was a gentile marrying a jew
[1:11:45] and joseph types
[1:11:47] christ of course as paul types
[1:11:50] believers espoused in marriage to christ
[1:11:55] so in azerath we see ourselves the
[1:11:57] gentile
[1:11:58] bride of christ joseph's life before
[1:12:01] marrying aznath clearly types jesus's
[1:12:03] earthly ministry
[1:12:05] they're both rejected by their brethren
[1:12:06] sold for silver
[1:12:09] went to prison they were surrounded by
[1:12:11] two
[1:12:12] guilty ones ones killed one spared
[1:12:18] joseph is exalted to second in command
[1:12:20] which type jesus's resurrection
[1:12:22] going to the right hand of the majesty
[1:12:24] on high and then once
[1:12:26] there on the throne he got a gentile
[1:12:29] wife
[1:12:30] which is a type of christ begins to call
[1:12:33] and espouse a gentile wife to himself
[1:12:36] after he ascends to the throne remember
[1:12:38] i read it this week and
[1:12:39] he said he told the woman of sir
[1:12:41] venetian i'm not sent
[1:12:43] to you i'm just sent to the lost house
[1:12:45] of israel you're a dog basically and she
[1:12:48] said even the dogs get the crumbs
[1:12:50] that fall from the masters table praise
[1:12:52] god look at that
[1:12:53] gentile faith praise god so gentiles
[1:12:56] will take whatever they can get
[1:12:57] amen but we're not dogs anymore we'll
[1:13:01] say it like that we're not
[1:13:03] under the table anymore we're not
[1:13:04] scrounging around the table looking for
[1:13:06] scraps
[1:13:07] we have a place at the table how many
[1:13:09] believe that
[1:13:10] we're the because the jews have been
[1:13:11] blind and the children been blinded and
[1:13:13] now the jews
[1:13:14] i'm sorry now the gentiles rather have a
[1:13:16] place at the father's table praise god
[1:13:20] as paul said be followers of christ he
[1:13:23] said
[1:13:24] imitators as dear children right
[1:13:27] imitate christ as christ's dear children
[1:13:33] then we know joseph revealing himself to
[1:13:36] his brethren types the jews revealing
[1:13:38] himself to the
[1:13:39] faithful hundred forty four thousand
[1:13:41] jewish remnant
[1:13:42] after the rapture the brothers were
[1:13:45] blinded
[1:13:45] to his identity just as israel is
[1:13:48] currently blinded
[1:13:49] as we looked at under the last series to
[1:13:52] recognizing jesus as messiah
[1:13:55] now this revelation couldn't come until
[1:13:57] joseph put out everyone first from his
[1:14:00] presence
[1:14:01] uh even as an ath as she was in her
[1:14:04] royal quarters
[1:14:05] uh when he revealed himself to his
[1:14:07] brethren this types jesus's true bride
[1:14:10] will be in her heavenly royal
[1:14:11] headquarters
[1:14:12] in heaven at the marriage supper of the
[1:14:14] lamb as christ slips down brother
[1:14:16] branham says he slips down
[1:14:18] to make himself known to the 144 000 on
[1:14:21] mount zion
[1:14:23] praise god
[1:14:28] okay so in closing let's just close with
[1:14:30] uh rahab here
[1:14:36] all right so the rescue of rahab the
[1:14:39] gentile harlot
[1:14:41] from jericho's destruction types the
[1:14:43] rapture event
[1:14:45] in 1st thessalonians 4 verses 15 to 18.
[1:14:49] she's a gentile so she has gentile
[1:14:51] lineage
[1:14:52] that speaks of christ rescuing the
[1:14:55] gentile
[1:14:56] people at the very end of the times of
[1:14:59] the gentiles because a small little
[1:15:01] remnant of gentiles
[1:15:02] is saved rahab and her family the rest
[1:15:05] of the gentiles
[1:15:06] perish right the walls come down
[1:15:09] every every protection they have every
[1:15:12] man-made protection
[1:15:13] crumbles right that's what's gonna
[1:15:14] happen to this world right that image of
[1:15:16] the beast right there it is
[1:15:18] there's the crumbling when christ comes
[1:15:20] back as a stone he smites the image and
[1:15:22] it
[1:15:22] scatters away right uh like
[1:15:26] like the sheaves i think it was or what
[1:15:28] was that the chaff like the chaff it's
[1:15:29] scattered like the chaff
[1:15:31] just totally scattered and just like
[1:15:33] when the walls fall down
[1:15:35] the the stones are just broken and
[1:15:36] scattered all around
[1:15:38] nothing left beautiful type there
[1:15:42] connecting those together i've never
[1:15:43] seen that before until tonight
[1:15:46] now what's what was interesting is that
[1:15:50] rahab is saved by a trumpet and a shout
[1:15:52] right
[1:15:53] in joshua 6 verse 5. now the jew gentile
[1:15:57] bride has one more she has a voice
[1:16:00] right a voice of an archangel because
[1:16:03] paul says that
[1:16:05] the rapture comes as a shout voice and
[1:16:08] trump of god
[1:16:09] so very very similar things going on
[1:16:12] there i'm still praying
[1:16:13] still asking god show me that voice
[1:16:15] there praise god i know they shouted
[1:16:17] with their voices but
[1:16:18] a voice of an angel right so one
[1:16:21] archangel not two not three not four
[1:16:23] not a band of angels one angel one
[1:16:26] voice of an angel
[1:16:31] all right now malachi hebrews 11
[1:16:35] 31 can you read that please i don't know
[1:16:37] if it's your turn or not but just
[1:16:38] forgive me
[1:16:40] look at this uh here we pick up
[1:16:44] uh rahab here in the hall of fame of
[1:16:47] faith
[1:16:48] all right and let's see what it says
[1:16:51] here
[1:16:52] uh romans 11 31
[1:16:58] i'm sorry hebrews 11 31 by faith the
[1:17:01] harlot rahab
[1:17:02] perished not with him that believed not
[1:17:04] when she had received the spices peace
[1:17:07] amen so she received
[1:17:11] the spies with peace did say in peace or
[1:17:13] with peace is a with or
[1:17:16] in
[1:17:20] with there you go we see them with peace
[1:17:28] so this is the hall of fame of faith
[1:17:30] chapter so
[1:17:32] we know rahab received faith
[1:17:35] and she received them with peace so when
[1:17:38] she had faith in israel's god it brought
[1:17:41] peace to the messengers
[1:17:42] she expressed peace to them she didn't
[1:17:44] sell them out remember that she actually
[1:17:45] lied through her teeth
[1:17:47] right so her faith
[1:17:51] caused her to express peace to god's
[1:17:54] spies
[1:17:55] god's messengers brother graham calls
[1:17:56] them tape boys
[1:17:59] we know jeffersonville takes that one to
[1:18:01] seed right
[1:18:02] makes it a false doctrine
[1:18:06] but preachers i'll say like this and
[1:18:09] that oh there's another case brother
[1:18:10] brown calls them preachers that's right
[1:18:12] there's another one i found later
[1:18:13] so he said two preachers slip in there
[1:18:16] because state boys don't play
[1:18:17] or i'm sorry hey boys just play they
[1:18:19] don't preach
[1:18:20] so brother i'm called a minister slipped
[1:18:22] in there
[1:18:24] he calls him preachers another case
[1:18:28] so i just think it's so beautiful and
[1:18:29] brother ram
[1:18:31] points it out and as i was with moses
[1:18:34] he said rahab is a type of the gentile
[1:18:37] bride
[1:18:38] who never had to see a miracle to
[1:18:40] believe for the rapture
[1:18:42] right thomas had to see to believe right
[1:18:48] so did peter they all had to believe
[1:18:50] that like all those apostles
[1:18:51] probably said they didn't have time as
[1:18:53] faith but remember thomas was a real man
[1:18:54] of god
[1:18:55] um he just was a man that needed to see
[1:18:58] that
[1:18:59] but this woman rahab didn't need to see
[1:19:01] it
[1:19:02] all she did was hear about this god of
[1:19:05] israel
[1:19:06] because faith comes by hearing praise
[1:19:09] god
[1:19:10] that's all she had to do this is why she
[1:19:12] types the gentile bride
[1:19:14] because we don't even have to we don't
[1:19:16] we didn't even
[1:19:17] most of us didn't even see brother
[1:19:18] branham right we never even met him
[1:19:20] we never saw we never saw water stand up
[1:19:24] on itself right
[1:19:25] we never crossed through the red sea we
[1:19:28] never crossed through a natural
[1:19:30] river the river jordan imagine that 33
[1:19:34] 300 billion gallons in a year would pass
[1:19:36] through there
[1:19:37] well all those millions of gallons were
[1:19:39] stacked up on top of each other
[1:19:41] they walked right through there rahab
[1:19:43] didn't see that
[1:19:44] all israel had had was faith and because
[1:19:47] she had faith in israel's god
[1:19:50] she received the preachers in peace so
[1:19:53] that's
[1:19:53] that's all we have to do we have to have
[1:19:55] faith in the god
[1:19:57] that we know there's only one god the
[1:19:59] true god
[1:20:00] and whether we see or not we hear it and
[1:20:03] then we believe it amen
[1:20:05] that's why especially our young people
[1:20:06] that's why we had those testimonies last
[1:20:07] summer right
[1:20:08] even if you don't see it you need to
[1:20:10] believe it praise god
[1:20:12] even though i've seen a few miracles i
[1:20:14] thank god for them i haven't seen
[1:20:16] loads and loads and tons of them like um
[1:20:20] like extreme amazing ones like water
[1:20:22] being stacked up right
[1:20:23] or someone walking on water or the dead
[1:20:26] rays haven't seen that
[1:20:27] but i believe praise god i know god can
[1:20:29] do it with all with god
[1:20:31] all things will be possible but this is
[1:20:34] the faith of this
[1:20:35] gentile bride she just hears
[1:20:38] and then she believes she receives them
[1:20:41] in peace and they say
[1:20:43] and she said give me a token right give
[1:20:44] me something that i know
[1:20:46] you won't forget and they give her a red
[1:20:49] cord right
[1:20:50] and so they give her this red cord it
[1:20:52] signified her faith
[1:20:53] but ram types it to the baptism of the
[1:20:55] holy ghost read of course the blood
[1:20:57] right the blood of the everlasting
[1:20:59] covenant the covenant is the holy spirit
[1:21:02] the life is in the blood the holy spirit
[1:21:04] is life
[1:21:05] so we can see how the red core the
[1:21:07] scarlet cord types the baptism of the
[1:21:09] holy ghost it's on public display right
[1:21:11] it's the token
[1:21:12] it's the token as we saw in exodus
[1:21:14] chapter 12.
[1:21:17] and it must be on public display it was
[1:21:19] it was it was publicly displayed
[1:21:21] to god's army as they approached
[1:21:23] remember they marched around there six
[1:21:25] times right and then on the
[1:21:26] seventh day they marched around six
[1:21:28] times or seven times was it seven times
[1:21:30] or just one more time
[1:21:32] seven times thank you and so they would
[1:21:35] have had to seen that march around they
[1:21:37] would have seen that red cord right
[1:21:39] the armies of god let's have this the
[1:21:40] angels of god
[1:21:42] know we got the token praise god they
[1:21:44] can see it amen
[1:21:45] because it's a public life uh the
[1:21:48] the church of god the armies of god the
[1:21:50] angels of god
[1:21:52] can recognize because remember the bible
[1:21:53] said they go about the city right
[1:21:55] remember marking with the writers in
[1:21:57] corn
[1:21:58] those who sign cry for the abominations
[1:22:00] done in the city they can see
[1:22:02] they know who's marked by the holy
[1:22:03] spirit
[1:22:08] so we see that's a type the token is a
[1:22:09] type oil is a type
[1:22:11] new wedding garment's a type of the holy
[1:22:13] spirit the dove is the type of the
[1:22:14] baptism holy ghost there's so many great
[1:22:16] symbols
[1:22:17] of the holy ghost only rahab and those
[1:22:20] in her house
[1:22:21] were spared from death
[1:22:25] right everyone else died
[1:22:28] and that's the type of the tribulation
[1:22:30] period
[1:22:31] right they all die but before the
[1:22:34] destruction
[1:22:35] we know they had the red core right they
[1:22:37] were they were saved by grace amen
[1:22:40] so we know we can see the beautiful type
[1:22:42] there of the gentile bride being
[1:22:44] saved from the destruction through the
[1:22:47] red cord token
[1:22:49] praise god
[1:22:54] all right now just a few more things
[1:22:55] here as we close
[1:22:58] now what's amazing is we see in the
[1:23:00] scripture so lydia can you get
[1:23:01] matthew 1 verse 5. in case you can
[1:23:05] get ephesians two verse one
[1:23:10] it's amazing to see that this uh
[1:23:13] harlot who was
[1:23:17] rescued she once lived such an ill-famed
[1:23:20] life
[1:23:23] sexually immoral
[1:23:26] but she found faith she received faith
[1:23:30] so the word of god fell on good ground
[1:23:33] isn't that something
[1:23:34] we know if she was a harlot it would the
[1:23:36] ground wasn't good at one time
[1:23:38] right but the ram makes a real good case
[1:23:41] for her
[1:23:42] like her parents got sick and she had no
[1:23:44] way to to pay the bills so she had the
[1:23:46] only way she could get money was to do
[1:23:48] the work of a harlot but she
[1:23:51] knew it was wrong the whole time she was
[1:23:53] kind of trapped into it just like we're
[1:23:55] trapped into it right
[1:23:56] we got sin trapped into us that's the
[1:23:57] reality of it
[1:24:00] but what did she become after she
[1:24:03] received that token well she became
[1:24:05] i said like this she became a kind of
[1:24:07] like a saver to her family right she
[1:24:09] said getting here getting here she'd be
[1:24:10] him a witness and a testimony to her
[1:24:12] family get inside the house
[1:24:13] and be saying get inside here you'll be
[1:24:15] saved and then lydia uh can you read
[1:24:17] matthew one verse five
[1:24:19] in simon we got boaz of record and
[1:24:22] buzzfeed
[1:24:23] obed of ruth and obedient jesse
[1:24:28] amen
[1:24:30] and so rahab is in this lineage here
[1:24:33] that leads to christ such a beautiful
[1:24:37] story
[1:24:39] so god pulls out a gentile out of the
[1:24:42] world
[1:24:43] with an ill fame destroys
[1:24:47] all the people that would have witnessed
[1:24:48] against her right and said she was an
[1:24:50] immoral woman
[1:24:50] they all were destroyed right
[1:24:54] there was no witnesses against her right
[1:24:55] that's what god does he takes away all
[1:24:57] the witnesses
[1:24:58] right satan has no satan has nothing to
[1:25:00] accuse us of
[1:25:01] because it's all been washed away by the
[1:25:03] blood of jesus christ
[1:25:06] so she marries into the family right and
[1:25:09] pretty
[1:25:09] soon produces a boaz and then a obed and
[1:25:12] then a
[1:25:13] a jess and then a david and out of that
[1:25:16] comes christ
[1:25:17] amen hallelujah oh my
[1:25:20] jesus god chose a gentile
[1:25:24] with an awful previous life
[1:25:28] and chooses her by faith by the hearing
[1:25:30] of faith
[1:25:31] to overcome the destruction of the whole
[1:25:34] city
[1:25:35] through a shout and a trump praise god i
[1:25:38] shout into trump
[1:25:39] just like the shout voice and trump for
[1:25:41] the gentile bride to be raptured and
[1:25:43] saved from destruction
[1:25:45] it's a beautiful picture
[1:25:50] uh acacia ephesians two can you read one
[1:25:53] to six it's a longer portion
[1:25:55] but this this portion explains our
[1:25:58] rags to riches story just like rahab's
[1:26:01] rags to riches story she was under the
[1:26:03] sense of death
[1:26:04] she was a harlot spiritually and then
[1:26:06] physical death she was going to die
[1:26:09] with the messengers i'm sorry with
[1:26:11] israel coming and walking around jericho
[1:26:13] she was going to die
[1:26:14] so she was under the death sentence but
[1:26:16] god saved her by grace amen quick and
[1:26:18] nerve let's read dedication
[1:26:21] you hath he quickened who were dead in
[1:26:23] trespasses and sins
[1:26:25] wherein in time past ye walked according
[1:26:28] to the course of this world
[1:26:30] according to the prince of the power of
[1:26:32] the air
[1:26:33] the spirit that now worketh in children
[1:26:35] of disobedience
[1:26:37] among whom also we all had our
[1:26:40] conversation
[1:26:41] in times past in the less of our flesh
[1:26:44] full fulfilling the desires of the flesh
[1:26:47] and of the mind and whereby nature the
[1:26:50] children of wrath even
[1:26:51] as others the god who is rich in mercy
[1:26:55] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[1:26:59] even when we were dead in sins hath
[1:27:02] quickened
[1:27:02] us together with christ by grace we are
[1:27:05] saved
[1:27:06] amen praise god isn't that beautiful we
[1:27:08] were all dead in sins
[1:27:10] we served uh rest of the flesh
[1:27:13] and the mind like rahab a harlot
[1:27:17] you know sitting in her body and her
[1:27:20] mind no doubt
[1:27:22] but grace came to her she was saved by
[1:27:24] grace
[1:27:25] through faith and she was quickened when
[1:27:29] she heard about the god of israel
[1:27:31] she was quickened to believe and god saw
[1:27:33] that quickening
[1:27:34] and sent her to preachers i was going to
[1:27:37] say preachers
[1:27:38] and she heard the word they rece she
[1:27:40] received the token from their preaching
[1:27:43] started her own home church praise god
[1:27:44] like aquila and priscilla
[1:27:47] hallelujah and then when it came time
[1:27:49] for the armies of god when god visited
[1:27:51] the city
[1:27:52] she was spared praise god such a
[1:27:55] beautiful scripture
[1:27:58] now i want to close with this first
[1:28:00] corinthians 6 the bible says
[1:28:02] know ye not the unrighteous shall not
[1:28:03] inherit the kingdom of god be not
[1:28:05] deceived
[1:28:06] neither fornicators idolaters adulterers
[1:28:09] nor effeminate nor abuse or themselves
[1:28:11] with mankind
[1:28:12] nor thies nor covetous nor drunkards nor
[1:28:14] revilers nor extortioners shall inherit
[1:28:17] the kingdom of god
[1:28:18] now clearly rahab would be either a
[1:28:21] fornicator or an adulterer
[1:28:24] look at verse 11 one of the most
[1:28:25] beautiful scriptures for us
[1:28:27] and such were some of you but ye are
[1:28:30] washed but ye are sanctified but you are
[1:28:33] justified
[1:28:34] in the name of the lord jesus and by the
[1:28:37] spirit of our god
[1:28:39] amen think about that think how
[1:28:42] how long we could imagine rahab was a
[1:28:46] harlot
[1:28:46] maybe a year maybe five years
[1:28:52] consider 10 years how many
[1:28:55] awful experiences would she have had
[1:28:58] to relive and satan could have battled
[1:29:00] her over and over oh you would never be
[1:29:02] saved
[1:29:03] god would never love you how could you
[1:29:04] ever be saved
[1:29:07] right all those all those mind battles
[1:29:10] and all those evil things
[1:29:12] but this proves the quickening power
[1:29:14] someone could be dead
[1:29:15] spiritually but when faith drops into
[1:29:18] their heart it's a brand new life
[1:29:21] and the power of faith will wash away
[1:29:23] all those memories can you imagine
[1:29:25] she went from all those evil memories
[1:29:26] and the late nights and all the evil
[1:29:28] things
[1:29:29] to being married right a new husband a
[1:29:32] new home
[1:29:33] receiving a baby right
[1:29:37] and then seeing the the the family
[1:29:39] lineage go on and now she of course she
[1:29:40] would not have seen all of it
[1:29:42] but eventually would have brought forth
[1:29:44] a king after the heart of god
[1:29:46] amen and out of that would have come a
[1:29:48] real son of david
[1:29:50] jesus christ why because god knows we
[1:29:53] were all fallen short of the glory of
[1:29:55] god
[1:29:56] we were all in sin we were all dead in
[1:29:58] sins and trespasses
[1:29:59] but god sent us the amazing gift of
[1:30:01] grace it justifies us sanctifies us
[1:30:05] it washes us by the power of the holy
[1:30:08] spirit if god can wash that
[1:30:09] jet that gentile harlot rahab god can
[1:30:12] surely wash us and he will
[1:30:14] and he'll keep doing it praise god let's
[1:30:18] stand
[1:30:28] let's play spirit of the living god fall
[1:30:32] fresh
[1:30:34] that's the beautiful part about joshua
[1:30:36] the story of joshua
[1:30:38] i was thinking about that today it's
[1:30:39] such a beautiful story because god
[1:30:42] god said i'm with you as i was with
[1:30:44] moses moses had
[1:30:46] quite a few mistakes he had more
[1:30:48] victories no doubt
[1:30:49] he had quite a few mistakes god never
[1:30:51] left him god never forsook him
[1:30:55] despite all rahab's mistakes once faith
[1:30:58] entered she was a new creature amen we'd
[1:31:00] say a new creature in christ
[1:31:03] her sins were washed away forgiven
[1:31:08] given in marriage fruitful god even
[1:31:10] blessed the fruit of her womb
[1:31:13] after all the evils of the womb she had
[1:31:17] done
[1:31:18] god bless the fruit of her own because
[1:31:21] god
[1:31:23] is the great cleansing agent he's the
[1:31:26] great redeemer
[1:31:26] the great healer the great savior
[1:31:32] the consuming fire the refiners fire
[1:31:36] praise god thank you jesus
[1:31:40] i'm reminded as joshua they just even
[1:31:42] though they lose a battle even though
[1:31:43] they made a mistake
[1:31:45] god was still with them church we may
[1:31:47] have made mistakes this week
[1:31:48] we may have done evil but we confess it
[1:31:52] we need to confess it put it under the
[1:31:54] blood of jesus christ
[1:31:56] we might have lost one fight we'll
[1:31:58] definitely
[1:31:59] win this war by god's grace let's pray
[1:32:02] together
[1:32:03] ask the lord to forgive us if we've done
[1:32:05] anything wrong if we've sinned and
[1:32:07] embarrassed ourselves or
[1:32:08] fallen short of the glory of god that
[1:32:10] god will forgive us just wash that away
[1:32:13] and the faith that god is trying to give
[1:32:16] to us tonight we'd receive it
[1:32:19] it'd quicken us and strengthen us and
