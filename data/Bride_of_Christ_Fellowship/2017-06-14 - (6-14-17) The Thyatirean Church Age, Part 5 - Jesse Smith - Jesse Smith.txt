[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] - I want to continue on the Thyatira church age my view good works again like last month as I've studied prayed and thought about it as a preparedness morning I just thought I would and I felt led to go into the church ages again it increases the Lord I'll probably two more services maybe more running on the side to tear in church age and get to the Sardis church age by God's grace hope it's been a blessing you know you know there's as a pastor you can imagine it's kinda like at your home like let's say you have visitors to your home they can kind of get a sense of what's going on in the home like if everything's going good or if we're struggles right you can kind of get a sense of that but the people that live at home they know everything that's going on okay and so what I mean by that is like for the church as a pastor I know a lot about what's going on the church you know just with different everybody different families individuals and just like you people that all the time you good idea - and the reason I'm saying that is because I feel like these church ages have really given a glimpse into things going on in the church I'll just have to leave it a very broad as pastor tonight I never want to lose any confidence with people I never want to share anything personal I possibly can't for the saints that stay here you know they can make this their church home but I really feel like the church ages these server services have really showed us things that are going on everyone's a life and our lives the good and the bad blessings and also the struggles and I think if you're honest you can see your life in the trees church age sermons as well but I know person I've just been meditating on that this week they could watch these things that we've heard these quotes we preached these scriptures we read they're so applicable to all of us and the things that families are going through right now it's really I really believe it because I can see it I kind of know what's gone you know I can have a little bit idea what's going on in people's lives that let me know it so just be encouraged you know if it doesn't seem like it's maybe client for those live-streaming or anyone here you know it is a lie so we just got to be able to hear what the Holy Spirit setting to us amen so let's look at this here we're look at our text and this part five update tonight and chapter 2 verse 20 so I'd like to do is read that and then have it on the screen relation to 20 through 23 I like to read about four scriptures there I hope to if I can get to verse 23 tonight why don't I read verse 20 and then our everyone else can be 2122 endeavor 3:21 re verse 20 now we're standing out a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which call her self a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat being sacrificed unto idols now let's all reverse 21 ready 1 2 3 and I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she may benefit not thou reversely to behold I will cast her into a bed and then they commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds let's read 23 together 1 2 3 and I will get over her children would it be - and all the churches shall know he which searcheth the reins and hearts now we get it learn to everyone we're not you according to your horses so let's look at those scriptures tonight it's kind of serious scriptures you know it again real serious I remember this was the darkest age so it had to be very serious Christ had to really lay out a very serious warning of this second death that's just our as here as we create more time help me Father Lord have need of you tonight and come humbly reverently speak to us dear Lord of this word doing precious to us as you are precious to us as the Holy Spirit is so sacred we can never get used to it so lord help us to get out of the flesh and get into the sphere of Lord God's we can sense your presence giving warning is giving encouragement sort edification tonight correction give us what we have need of Lord we ask that you bless our time Jesus Christ no reset may God bless you Julian's unit praise God now everybody can switch over let's look at par 5 here tonight by God's grace also got some got some video news today I was able to record the serpent seed video and the beginning of the book of Revelation videos finally after all these hours and weeks of writing script and getting out all the thoughts laying out everything I was able to record that and so now I'm going to edit it hopefully I'll get a first video done by next week if I can God is very really excited to get that done and put it up there by God's grace I think we have a thirteen hundred subscribers to the YouTube channel and almost 150,000 views total that's pretty great by God's grace people are viewing that and hear the message of the hour praise God so let's look at tonight here as our text we read number text here we're still looking at higher tier of course the longest church age the church with the least amount of length because of persecution the darkness of persecution that's why I was called the dark ages and that's why that Dark Horse writer that's why that anointing and he stopped we actually started riding around here when they really started getting the indulgences going at Dark Horse Ryder Road quite a while killing here in the dark ages and of course capturing the wealth of the world this is when you begin our here around a thousand thousand ad started capturing the wealth of the world and there of course is Colombo's life there as we've talked about numerous times so tonight like I said I spent most of my time working on the video so I'm going to I don't have all the quotes out there so I'm going to be reading some of them like I did a few weeks ago by God's grace so hope that's alright I just want to be pulling in some more quotes here from scriptures by the grace of the Lord so I want to look at these paragraphs I just I just typed out the paragraphs so they'd have to just it takes a lot of time to copy and paste them over I think I'll just read these here that woman Jezebel right now that woman Jezebel so I want to start with paragraph 227 yeah I want to start a paragraph two now we end off we ended up looking at Jezebel on Sunday and we looked at how she was the most greatest curse and all the world is a is a woman who's got the iron disposition right swamps her way all the time forces her way right the woman with iron disposition but brother Ram says it's equally perverted for a man to be a weak man so we don't want to preach too hard on the sisters and not the same heart on the brothers however we preach are the brothers we want to preach the same on the sisters so we looked at that and I hope that was helpful by the grace of Lord I was a couple of hands and went up antenna service so I was happy to see that as the needs were met there now brother Branham started talking about Jensen oh so we'll look at a little bit about Jezebel and I found the very day that I did preach that message was when I preach on the spell of Jezebel that's when Elijah said that's when he went to calorie so there must been a good anointing that night and he got baptized later on the same day at Amen was baptized I remember Elijah cry after coming out of the water that was real to the touching time now he was really simply seemed to be sincere so very thankful for that now it says the very first and important thing that we learned about Jezebel is she's not a daughter of Abraham so she wasn't in the right seat right now the right scene light now remember the seed lighting mattered up to the days of Noah right your seat your physical genetic seed line mattered until the days of Noah because you had that you had another good thing preaching on our teaching on serpents II so it's kind of fresh overnight you had in Genesis for you had Cain seed line right and then in Genesis 5 you have Adam seed line and their separate seed lines right because uh shaken interjected his seed into the human race came through Cain and Cain had all the characteristics of the serpent right the characteristics of Satan as well a murderer a liar from the beginning but out of the seed they began to call upon the Lord remember that praised God said what's out of that Seth and had some descendants then men begin to call upon the Lord so they had a good they had a good seed line so that's how you know your seed line today it's not a natural seed line it's a spiritual seed line if you're born again of the spiritual seat of the Baptist and Holy Ghost what do you do call upon God amen you cry out to God you worship God that's exactly right and that makes us the children of Abraham by a spiritual seed by faith in Christ Jesus program said she did not come into Israel by the way that Ruth did she came in by marriage of course 2 a.m. so she didn't come through the blood she came through marriage right and we know we got to all come through the blood right hallelujah Ruth of course came through the blood and of course through marriage but she would have went through all the acts of purification which of course we know Jezebel denied Jezebel was the daughter of a murder remember that her dad was a murderer so she had murder in her lineage just like hey right was like hey in AWS descendants they had murder in their lineage that's right now I want to read that program says this from the time of Abe's marriage to Jezebel idolatry progressed in a deadly fashion so once Jezebel got into the church would say the idols increased drastically right and brother hams have that increase or that was a foreshadowing right of JFK bringing rolling Catholic Church influence back into America and of course we can all see the idolatry that's increased in our day and it just keeps increasing right it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse now you're seeing it you're seeing on Facebook now they're really pushing even children that are wanting to trust or cross-gender right that's a big thing now 7 year olds 8 year olds 9 year olds letting them dress and transgender that's a big thing now is being able to let children go it's not enough for a little an adult to do it now that spirit wants to jump on children and ruin lives right also ruin lies it's awful look that's what you see on the news the total perversion the total idolatry and it's increasing more and more right we're seeing that just like the type show once jessabelle got in there the idolatry starts increasing they met no Milgram said see that's what the Spirit is setting forth in the fire tear in church age 1/2 married Jezebel and she did it as a political maneuver to strengthen his kingdom and secure it that's exactly what the church did when it married under Constantine they both got together for political reasons though they put a spiritual heir to it aren't you glad you got together with your spouse for spiritual reasons aren't you glad aren't you glad you come to this church for spiritual reasons praise God I married my wife for spiritual reason I knew she loved Christ of course I loved her you know as well but the main decision was spiritual decision right that's why we choose our church there's so many churches out here you have many churches you can marry out here right spiritually we could be married to many different churches out here but we choose to be married based upon the word amen Christ the work hallelujah amen that's why we're united with this church tonight with Christ hallelujah is because of the work not because of the carpet not because of the chairs not because of the parking lot but because of the word but many people is not that way many people I talked to many friends I have they choose their church based upon the children's ministry and you'll never find out the Bible you never find children having a separate ministry children were supposed to sit with the families why so the family can feel United the churner could see the parents enjoy the word right love the word and then that would make the children want to love the word you never never saw we never saw the modern evangelism right but I had my cousin my cousin told me he go chooses his church because of the rock and roll right and I have other friends later said that choose it older friends that just choose well so our children can have a ministry so we can sit in peace and quiet in the service that's why and see not understanding that God does his what the pattern God doesn't want the church to pattern off the world God wants the church to pattern off the word and so I met friends I back so we got to be able to and I have like that we've got to be able to keep continue stay married in Christ the right reasons a day I believe you have special Wednesday night when were the only five of the four adults are here tonight tip you gotta love the word to be here tonight Amen Alleluia but that is what it was Jay have a jessabelle was just like Constantine and the Roman Catholic Church the same marriage now Milgram said Constantine's idea was to get everyone together the pagans and Christians he says but the real believers came along to see if they could bring back the ones that had drifted away from the word so once again we see true believers will always try to get people to repent amen always those true believers try to get Constantine's group and member the church in Rome number Polycarp went to the Church of Rome to try to get it to come back and they wouldn't come back so we've got to at least try to get people to come back to the Word of God that should be us holding those who are drifting away like I'm texting brothers or texts hoses brothers or sisters I lead the church you know please come back please come back to the word we should be the ones holding the Drifters back to the word amen that should be our duty to speak our heart but program said the false church will fight the true Pentecostals I don't mean the organization I mean the ones who are Pentecostal because they're filled with the Holy Ghost and have the signs and gifts in their midst because they walk in truth they meant holiday yeah I like that Great Scott he says this next yeah I vote for the next paragraph it's 228 no that's to 20 to 29 yeah our new to 29 now if you remember the scripture Jezebel took the the state money and erect into huge houses of worship to a star T and Bale remember that he we build a house of bail it was a massive house my man said history says that was the big enough for all the Israel to come in worship their act and when Constantine in the church married he gave the church buildings instead of altars and images and organized a hierarchy that had already been shaping up now I don't remember the history but I never read the Bible somewhat after the time of a hab was going for revival I forget who it was it might have been Ju but they gathered they said oh let's go worship Bailey remember that description Lenny remembers that having read through that they gathered all the workers let's go worship Bale now the true Christians into the true Jews did that not Christian they said oh let's go to the office of male worship and once they got all the sinners in there they said this is the judgment of God and they killed all the communal workers in bales house that was God's idea of judgment right because judgment begins in the house of God well in that case judgment began with house of bale as well judgment was pouring forth so the very house that they were worshipping of false idols of false gods and God allowed them to die that house is that a type of today that type of today the very houses and churches people go to the worst Street buildings are worshipping by Creed's that house is where they'll have a spiritual death that's exactly right spiritual death in those houses themselves now let me move on here but rancid had got so bad in the days of Jezebel and Elijah thought he was the only one left right but God had 7,000 more that had about the knee - Bailey go to the right now amongst those denominations of Baptists Methodists Presbyterians there are some that will come out and come back to God I want you to know that I am NOT now and never happened against the people it's the denomination the system of organization that I'm against I have to be against it for God hates it they met so see we're not against the people were against the system so like today even yesterday I got to witness somebody gotta tell me about Bill Graham I got to worship or witness to the cashier Walmart and God you know he said oh he said I was weak and I said great I said we spent all of Sunday knowing Church the kids were all standing right there and I said Saturday went to a friend's house and then we did something for oh we went to that crazy thing with dance a church dancing a event that they did they dance in the duro godly way they dance for Jesus and he said oh said what church you go to I said well I'm a master with Church riding high scholarship he said what denomination I said no doubt no denomination I said we follow the Ministry of William Brandt and he said you believe in speaking in tongues I said yes I do but it's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost he said what I think it is I go to Apostolic Church I said okay and I said that I said we had a speaking in tongues I said a few months ago in February I said but we just can't say it's the scripture I said I grew it in church where they spoke in tongues every Sunday almost and he and then he changes to because I started saying something he said well maybe I need to study that more I'm not quite sure you know if that's the evidence of the Holy Spirit or not I said here abroad I said here's my card call me and let's talk about it now he hasn't called me yet I hope he will or the most people that don't but if he's a lack of God he will if he's left but I but he said he makes mention of this here and I wanted him to know I wasn't against him I was against the organization and says you've got to speak in tongues because I was raised under that and I let him know I said I'm thankful that the Assembly of God denomination of Pentecost then I was raised on thankful they pray for me I I said I was thinking for their prayers their financial support I said they were fine fine people now what would it look like about I said oh they're a bunch of Devils they weren't they were very they're very kind very loving people but see you see how we can't attack the people we got attacked the doctrine we got to attack the organization and so I was able to say we don't agree with that doctrine but I love the people and so God has showed me that you know through brother branham's teachings so forth that we've got to be able to love the people but totally disagree with after and so that's what we do by God's grace that just kind of reminded me of that I felt really I felt really happy yesterday I got the witness of my life finally something I want to talk about God it's all artifice it but there was one said yesterday by God's grace now bambam said remember this Jezebel spirit was the spirit that was in the churches in Thyatira and he said member how they did it they had a prophetess sit on a tripod remember that from a few services ago a prophetess old woman prophetess had to be a woman prophetess in Thyatira when Thyatira became the literal seed of Satan he said and she sounded a try vanities tripod you see it hears the Prophet is called Jezebel and she's teaching the people fell for this church age it had to be a woman and she would prophesy and yet they have a sexual sins I'll just say like that Hartman saying it either way that's where you got fornication here in the scripture says she was teaching them to commit fornication right and he things sacrificed unto idols so this woman but the church that was led by a woman in Thyatira was a symbol of Jessica they did car Jezebel but because a woman was leading the people jesus said that's the spirit of Jezebel right the same demonic spirit right same spirit and remember church let me know this is rough I know it's rough but the denominational churches will have the same destiny as jessabelle I know that's rough but if you have a list of the four see lately you'll remember day if you get to listen to Matt Berger's brother heads by saying that slaps horse rider a spiritual death and where does that death ultimately head take them to the Battle of Armageddon my man is going to be hot and heavy there because you have all those sinners and here comes Christ writing the white horse the pure white horse out of heaven and my dad said he's got his resurrected Saints behind him on white horses and they say how would you say there's not animals in heaven because here Jesus comes out of the heaven of heavens riding a white horse and he's got all those white horses behind him there's animals in heaven amen I think you progressive Loretta I'm surprised at your scripture lack of scripture dollars and don't think there is animals in heaven because Jesus comes out of the very third heaven with animals amen remember the same destiny that Jess about a hat is the same destiny that the churches have today that deny the Word of God taught those that noth-nothing ones that love the Word of God those that deny the word of God and will take the mark of the piece and will love the Catholic Church and will love denominations right they have the same destiny but Madison why is that it's because there was a jessabelle and Elijah in both days ha ha hey what do you mean well just Elijah have we had you had brother bran hey Dad we've had the spirit of Elijah so if there's a spirit of Elijah here there's got to be a habit just about here too hey what is that the Roman Catholic Church now Jezebel's daughters which we'll get to in just a moment here if that just a moment I'll probably close of that thought so see because we have a we had a half Kennedy Jezebel the Roman Catholic Church or you could say his wife because she influenced so many women but it's awesome in the Roman Catholic Church because you have a man Jezebel and Elijah brother branham you have to have the same destinies of all of them praise God that's exactly what we have that has to repeat now I oughta just over eaten by dogs right so that's the difference but for those are dogs lick their blood and ate their bones but in Armageddon its Birds remember if the fowls of the air come together to the Bible set the great feast so both both spirits of just about the spirit of Jezebel there the woman Jezebel the spirit of Jezebel the churches both destinies are to be eaten by animals in that a shame that's an awful thing all because they don't care what the Word of God says we should be more loved with our Bibles than we ever were attention because that's the only way we're not going to be deceived amen is to know this word hallelujah you should know the truth and the truth shall set you free it's exactly right so we shouldn't be reading our Bibles less we should be reading our Bibles more teaching our Bible for me teaching the Bible or reading it more loving the Bible Lord's actually right now let's move on now have I read 29 3 yes I did okay now but man said this woman on the tripod was seducing them and teaching them to commit fornication but RAM says that fornication for us is symbolic of idolatry or idol worship it we've gone through that right we know all the height of smoking drinking money right all these things can be idol sports people all that movies all these things to be idols and that's the idols of today you know that so but if all churches will allow them to keep doing that a man working it's kind of nice but it's kind of discouraging because he's getting he's trying to get on fire for God and he's going to a a mega church in the Farallon area might know which one of this in my city but he come up to me and he was like all brother Justin because me brother Jesse I think you been even had even at work because another Jesse indeed knows I'm a bastard but he said all there's a great sermon on Sunday unique on Monday he saw me and said this he said oh and the pastor was saying this this and that but then the sad part was he said but see the pastor said it's okay if we still watch dirty shows with with cussing on it and all these things and watch murders and he said because we've got to stay in touch you know and with the culture and all these days don't think and like at that point I stopped smiley and I get really sad like this is awful like I'm happy see he wants to draw closer to God but those preachers are going to be guilty on the day of judgment because they're pointing the people off the word instead of pointing them to the Word of God so I just try to don't change the subject and talk about something that I preach or something I heard preach but then he wrote me uh he sets up really nice he wrote me out of the text and said you're a real light to me this year at school as I said praise God at least something is getting through to him you know I try to ignore what they say and just change the subject point it back to Christ but see that's what the people are feeding them today isn't it awful same thing there they're saying it's okay to be in idolatry it's not okay Christ must be number one Christ must be our greatest love in bed he must be our focus all throughout the day morning noon and night what better thing to focus on in Christ that's exactly right but see that's the idol worship that this woman the spirit of just about today the churches is giving out to the people it's okay to have idols it's okay to commit which is actually spiritual fornication in other words not being true to Christ but falling in love and giving your love like Samson to Delilah giving your love to anything other than the Lord Jesus Christ right Legrand said every fornicator will wind up in the lake of fire right that's what the Bible says there in Revelation chapter 20 fornicators all those things will have their part in the lake which burneth with fire so even spiritual fornicators okay now next I'm going to next page I only got a few more slides all right program sit down let us go over here revelation 17 and see this woman the church who is living on false prophecies and not the Word of God in verse 1 of revelation 17 god calls her a great why is she a because she's in idolatry she has caught the people up in to the same thing what's the cure for idolatry and we know the Word of God I like how brother that makes it simple how do you cure idolatry come back and we'll lay the word so this woman is a because she has left the word there she is sitting upon many waters which means multitudes of people this surely has to be the false church because the Church of God is small few there be that find it be generous you take a look at the Vatican I've never been that would you ever look at the pictures they have idols all the way around the Vatican like all the tops of the building there are statues everywhere and out of that but they have those paintings with native people all over and they wonder you know people wonder why those priests get into the trouble they get into right with molestation and all kinds of evil things they wonder because it's it's a spirit of idolatry they're praying to evil spirits right they're calling Mary the mother of God they're literally into idolatry praying to demon powers and everybody thinks it's okay everybody says oh they're so spiritual oh it's so Reverend it's a false reverence right because there's no repentance if there's no repentance it's not the Spirit of God amen if the Spirit of God brings us to repentance he said that is I love I rebuke them other there we go now I bring them back to the promises of God back to the word right so that's why she's a and then she spreads her love with all the kings of the earth right number I showed the picture if you don't know a couple years ago I preached on that and almost every nation under heaven has ambassadors from the Vatican that go out to the countries right and so see that's how she's spreading her fornications she's sharing her love she's spreading her false doctrines and her idols with the nations of the world and his guilty as the mother of all harlots the mother the Bible says guilty of adultery I'm sorry in idolatry lamented sir surely she has to be the false Church because the Church of God is small few that'll be the fighting I'm happy about that praise God amen let's go to verse 21 revelation 221 let's go there we'll get to the next one it's called space to repent allogram gives us a illustration here I'm sure he gives you the title Gravatt a title revelation 221 and I gave her space to repent repent of her fornication and she repented not so Milgram says did you know that this church was actually more wicked than a hat Legrand says because a had actually repented the Bible said and for a while walk softly before God her brother had said can't say that a varoma Catholic Church right when in the Roman Catholic Church apologize for the Inquisition when they apologize for the Crusades they've never apologized last year the Pope got in trouble for going into one was it Syria I don't know which one he went into and he brought an accusation from the past and said this country's still guilty and everybody got upset because he wanted her here every can of what he said against this country I wish it would wrote that down but see then they don't have it in them to repent they don't have it in them to come back to the work just like any can couldn't rip them right Esau tried to repent but couldn't get it because he'd already passed the line between mercy and judgment in other words God are you given the blessings of the birthright to Jacob is that right so he couldn't get it back just like the Roman Catholic Church they've already given the birthright away thank God who's got the birthright we've got the birthright we can be born again on Olivia but they've already turned it down they don't want it they rather have denominations increase that they'd have the Word of God oh my it's a striking thing now let's look at this here I want to go to the thought in verse 22 yeah that's what this talk now I want to try to do this and preach me about twenty more minutes yeah and then we'll be good the Lord with it by God's grace so oh yeah I had to stop here I want to lay this out here I went through my sermon that I preached on the spell of Jezebel and this was the order of Jezebel first she brought in the false worship of false gods then she built her own church then she killed the prophets and then she started feeding her own prophets and that ties him with that four-step course of sin that we went over on Sunday remember that that four-course step it ties him perfectly she Burgess brought it in a book just a little bit of idols right and then she started building her kingdom killing the prophets see those killing and building your kingdom and at the end you're feeding her own crop your own prophets all right your May in your kingdom so great to rule over everybody else order that we saw the course of sin go through on Sunday night and I forgot about this first Kings 1819 said she spread a table before her false prophets and there was she was feeding her prophets I did a pretty see the tiger you see spiritually she became the pastor of the prophets did you see that they were feeding at her table oh mercy right she became the shepherd of her own creatures right she was feeding them she becomes the bachelors to see what the spear of the Antichrist does it tries to serve the pass to Authority that's why I told you we got to be careful about what's going on with a lot of churches are saying Oh pastors need to sit down and play tapes it's hitting a lot of churches it's it's in fact the one church that does the most has the Church of almost 800 people that show up and sprung up almost overnight last year 800 people rally around this thought of all we don't need a pastor to preach we just want to play the tapes and what is that done that is taken away God's gift of a pastor it's eliminated Scripture and it's interjected something new right we don't want to try to carry the Ark on a new cart we want the overlay we want to on the shoulders of the Levites are you with me Terrance Amen one of the shoulders of God called man hallelujah that will pack the Word of God that's exactly right let's see what they're doing they're replacing God's form right away let's try to do on let's try something new when brother Graham never taught that weather I've never said to do that as we've mentioned recently what are they doing I believe it's the spirit of Jezebel right and it's giving somebody the opportunity to be a pastor rather than a God called man and doing it God's provided way I believe that now verse 22 brother Branham brings us out let's read 22 behold I will cast her into bed and then that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except depending their deeds and then you reach 23 and I will kill her children with death now if you listen to the server from 1960 brother Graham said whoa he goes like that whoa you see listen to you kind of shook me baby laughs he's like whoa he said children the woman's got children are the random says that's quite a striking revelation is really think about it think about before you before you knew that you know we didn't know whose it we didn't know who we thought the Satanists were God's entity right we thought the Church of Satan was God's enemy poorly sided before the message I thought you know sinners rock and roll stars you know they're they are the enemy but when we come to the message we see that the mother is the greatest enemy of the church the mother harlot and not only her but she's got daughters why is that the greatest enemy because they're deceiving people making people think they're right with God and they're totally not right with God they're only right kind of Devils Vincent whoa so what this woman has children and she was a if that's the case she had sugared by her whoredoms that she must be burned with fire as ezekiel says his ego says Ezekiel 36 had burned the with fire right so that's why she got to be burned with fire right before the Millenium right after the Battle of Armageddon Christ comes the sword comes out sometime after that maybe it's the sword itself but she's got to be burned with fire because the Bible said in Malachi 4 they walk up out on the ashes of the wicked right so at some point after a verb again and there's got to be fire to burn up all the sinners because their horns to God's Word I know that's a flat word and what's hard to say but it's nothing but the truth it's it's it's hard to say that was true her hand will be burned with fire her end is the lake of fire but stop and think about these children for a moment a woman is the one out of whom the children come it's evident of this woman had children that came out of hurt but they did the same thing she did she'll be one church and ever came out of organization and didn't go right back into it there is a one that one Luther's came out and then or I was right back and today they're hand-in-glove with this ecumenical move the Methodists came out and they organized right back the Pentecostals came out and organized right back he said there is going to be another coming out and praise God they won't be organized back because they know the truth that group will be the bride of the last day see she's coming out but she won't go back in and she won't let that demon come in her church either that's exactly right that's why we got to watch if there's oh if there's any sinful move coming in the church like we said just like with morally things like TVs like movies right standards fall for men and women they stay and the holiness standards fall we got to be careful of any little thing right because that's what was sort of seeing people's lives crumble I had a quote if I was going to preach on the good works but brother Graham said what's the first thing that Satan bites off he says off a tree he said the bugs bright off what first the fruit because that's the sweetest part right everybody already knows that it's the sweetest part so Satan will bite off your fruits of the spirit love joy patience goodness gentleness right you lose your jet I used to be so gentle now person lost their gentleness what was it the Antichrist spirit starts taking that sweetness away Loretta said what's the next thing he bites off the leaves everybody said that's the fellowship under the hot Sun so then they stopped first people will still come to church but they lose their happiness for God that's the first thing they lose there's fruit of the Spirit the second thing is they'll just stop coming to church all together because that's the leaves that's the fellowship and then the bark is the third step no more protection right and then the fourth thing the last step is the life he said to get to the sack they get to the life of the tree so I want to make sure I bring that up by God's grace let's remember that see the bride's gonna come out and she's going to stay out and she's going to keep the bugs out Thema hmmm because we got the best repellent there is right here the Word of God the best you can possibly get other than we just spray it all over throw it all over preach it all over wherever there's sin we just apply the word to it and it drives those demon powers back that's exactly right amen no infestations for us praise God amen now I'm trying to close here let me do a few more things here okay few more paragraphs yeah I think I missed one no I'm sorry I did miss one okay let me go back program oh yeah I miss this part brother Graham said the Roman Catholic Church will never repent he said not once has she ever apologized and said she was wrong for her mass murders and she won't either and no matter how mellow and sweet she appears at this particular time she will get rise up to kill for murder lies in her evil and unrepentant heart it's hard to imagine right now Church I mean I don't think you can understand it's hard for me to imagine Pope Francis or someone like him saying okay we're going to kill people now because he seems so gentle that's about the RAM said he seems so mellow right now right remember the first year he was poked remember he was Time magazine's Person of the Year like that's worldwide the most wonderful person of the year was the Pope because he saw a so happy he so he's so nice to people but brother I've said but at some point that Meletus will turn to anger right you know it's hard to imagine that but because they're off on the word because he said oh I can't preach again Who am I to judge homosexual well you're a preacher you're supposed to be able to judge that you're supposed to tell you tell them what the Bible judges about homosexuality I'm not judging I don't know where they'll go I don't know if there are better or not but the Bible judges you and said this is wrong if you don't repent you'll you can't escape death you'll die the second death because you're the Bhama nations but see it's hard to remember that but we're going to preach on Sunday night on Daniel 11 and Daniel 11 said that Antiochus memories from agree she's the Grecian Empire he's the one that was a type of the Antichrist the Bible said he came in by flatteries in other words really nice really sweet really wonderful just a nice guy nicest guy you want to meet that's how Antiochus came in and that's how the Antichrist is going to come in program said that's a tight or a shadow of the Antichrist in Daniel 11 it's Danny 1121 let's read that we got the time tonight I don't have two more slides I just met some paragraphs to me we're going to preach us on Sunday night Lord much I'm not the center night between our church Sunday night so maybe next Wednesday yeah that's right just one service Sunday yeah I got by the time is scheduled to come out and I have a well they can text me back I still got to get back and have let him know he's going to come they all look at the killer I just I was busy today he just texted Monday Daniel 11 21 now hadn't read yet 11:21 sir and in his estate should stand up a vile person to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom but he shall come in peaceably obtained the kingdom my flatters thank you that's strange he's called vile but yet he's so full of peace he's so kind and compliments everybody oh my goodness see how sitting good hi didn't saying it actually really really nice right you got to be careful you careful give it give people time that's why the Bible said lay hands on no man suddenly right don't worry day to day and real fast don't work there Dana brother for this is that give it time so they can show their true colors let some trials come right let's see what everybody's made up praise the Lord because that's what happened right here oh he's so peacefully so gentle oh my you're gentle he's such a fine person but the Bible said his heart was vile now verse 3232 wickedly against the Covenant shoddy corrupt by flattery other people God shall be strong then so see how Louie see who's gonna crush he's going to krump everybody that was isn't the Jews because it's the people that are against the Covenant so somehow the Pope is gonna be able to get Saudi Arabia Iran maybe North Korea he's got to get all nations behind him I was going to seize all nations he's going to do it by flatteries by being real mellow real kind let's see behind that is a vile person so see we got it when we're kind we got to be kind because we love our names amen we have to love our enemies and do good to those that even do evil to us all right now I think I'm getting to the close here yeah just got three more slides can you bear that three one I got em already ten then we're minutes by God's grace okay page 232 I read that page 233 okay that's where I'm at right now okay here we are now it's said here that this had children now what were they they were daughters for they were churches just like her that's what I show people to on the videos if we can find out who the mother is that we can prove she's got daughters we have to first prove who the mothers sits on seven hills where scarlet red purple all these things you can riches money as influence over every nation it's out of the Roman Catholic Church if you can prove that then you can easily prove who this daughters are because the Lutheran Church came out of the Catholic right the Methodists and Zwingli and all these brother Church of the Brethren they all came out of one another Danette now here is what I'm going to close with Loretta said now here is a very interesting point just about a AB had a daughter this is a good time that daughter married Jago r am the son of Jehoshaphat in second Kings a 16 it says jo-jo ramp walked in the ways of is father of all that beautiful as far as the beautiful type and sad it happened but it's beautiful tight for us to see today Jo Ram brought god-fearing and God worshipping Judah into idolatry that's exactly what all these daughter churches have done even eyes as I pointed out to you so let me back up there a little bit a having Jezebel were not of Judah they are of northern Israel so you remember huh remember how many tribes northern Israel had at ten tribes it was ten tribes and then Judah was one drive all by itself and in the Levites so I was like ten versus one the northern tribe at northern group at ten tribes Judah had one so Satan came in two through Jezebel into the northern kingdom right those ten tribes but he wasn't satisfied because it Judah had had some good Kings they had Hezekiah Josiah Jehoshaphat so Satan wasn't satisfied with just the northern kingdom he's got to have every king and he's not satisfied with some churches he wants every church but we will withstand him by God's grace and all the churches without the message of the hour will withstand him and even who was murdered in churches what was tentative because their Burchard to the word so see what Satan did he wasn't happy with northern Israel he had to get JUnit as well and so how'd he do it he did it by marriage the daughter of Jezebel you know that's that's a beautiful time right there discussion the jessabelle was the mother the daughter church right her daughter went into Judah and Judah he is praise right stuff and intermingle with praise and stop the praises of God right she intermitted she intermixed idolatry in to praise and what does that cause perverting worship it's no longer seared in truth but now it's you might have the right spirit of praise but now you have Hoffs doctor now you've got idolatry because the daughter of the mother has married into the church I thought that's just a beautiful type if we can see that the mother Jezebel the daughter church's married into Judah married into the praise and it produced a an awful church we'd say AB accident Church the Nansen they start in truth and marry an organization and leave the word for tradition Creed's etc we have said now I remember let me get this across in Hebrews 13:7 it says remember them which have the rule over you who's spoken to you the Word of God it is the word that rules not men I am not the one to ruin the church if the word that I'm preaching rules the trade man or brother Samuel comes in a brother Brooks it's the word that rules and if I don't keep the word then I need to step down against somebody who will keep the word praise the Lord and I see people not living the word I've got to take the word to that I'm duty bound they voted me in to be a watcher over their souls but really when people are Baxton they don't want you to tell but I got to tell them anyway right they voted for me they believe me to be a fan of God a shepherd but when someone's back said they don't want to know they're wrong but I've got to tell them anyway man right I've got to be sensitive when I'm wrong so he comes tell me I get a little back slid then I got to be able to accept that too because everybody the brand rather preach with a critical spirit remember we talked about that he said go to the ballclub even though he was in the right condition he stood to go and God was the Blessed image Kirsten got us a blessed gift but everybody needs shepherding by the grace of God everyone needs a shufflin nobody needs correction now man a husband is heaven I'm sorry now man as a husband is head of the woman he rules her but the church is a woman - and her ruler is the word Jesus is the word if she rejects the word and takes any other headship she's an adulteress now you naming one church hasn't given up on the word for tradition the Creed's they are all adulteresses like mother like daughter let's your feet here I want to show that he closes these two quotes I got thing I have two quotes for you or too close to this and then I want to just say a prayer for our friends and family who are in denominations because if they don't come out of that they will go to hell and if they don't come out and that just breaks my heart think about my mother and my brother we guys kind of pray you got to just believe in pray like program sets apply your faith for your salvation to them in other words I know I'm saved they're going to be saying - we got to do that by God's grace now you remember this quote from adroit 110 times remember this well Graham said it's predicted that they're going to do it and they're going to do it for thus says the Lord they're going to do it you think that nominations over break up their denomination come back to the word it's thus saith the Lord they won't now here's the part against me will they go into the Antichrist exactly it's thus said the Lord they will isn't that striking think about I know you have family and denominations I have family denominations and I try to tell on your family members couple years ago I before they made certain decisions I said you have to pray that that church gets a revival and comes back to the word if not they're going into the anti-crisis and then they said they would and last time I checked the person told me they hadn't come out yet I said what are you going to come out and they said I'm just going to keep praying I said okay but I've warned that individual I said if you don't come out of there and they don't come out of the Creed's they will become an antichrist system they will take the mark of the beast why is Munny simple they just let me just say if every my turns into they just go to my old church my whole denomination Church just another brand new big Church and I know your family member that we talked about they built a new church right and so who would want to give that up they just put thousands if not a million who know how much it cost they put all their hardware money now what church is going to say well you know we've got to keep the church or got it Oh are we go we gotta stop you against the Pope we got to extend against the Pope what are they gonna do there is well he's a nice guy he's flattering us you canif latter pentecost nib my family Christian Missionary Alliance he's gonna flatter all of them right and it's not just maybe it's thus saith the Lord because the daughters are cast into a bed the Bible said by the Rams that that bed is the Great Tribulation Period well that's what the Bible says it is so see does that put a burden on our hearts that's why I think this see that's why this is important it's I know just teach in terms of Church ages teaching but this makes us one to realize why our family members are in the churches of Jezebel's daughters so we were living in Elijah's day our family would be done at the house of ale but yet they think it's the house of God who's going to pray who's going to talk to them asking us we have to we have to be those who will not bow the knee to denominational edge or denominational pressure that's why so appreciated amen and each more abuses even though the view of the family pressure we're going to kick you out and we're going to cut you off of all this money or we want to part you we won't love you that's fine I'd rather have the love of Jesus than anything else I'll be right with God and right with you and that is real love jesus said those and your own house will be your enemy's right he said I didn't come to bring the peace on the earth like Antichrist gonna bring peace and flatteries I came to bring a sword now he gets us individual peace I'm not the son karma say is going to bring worldwide false peace but then sudden destruction comes upon them because those prophets will start blowing those trumpets and one after another all the structures that we interrupt in nature why because they love the the filthiness of fornications they love their idolatry more than the Word of God god help us to love God's Word more and more all the time do you believe that that's us say it the Lord Jesus my my family the denomination they belong to will go in the mark of the beast because of money here's the last - one remind you you have to pray for our family because they're in the Jezebel's daughter systems and they cannot hear the voice of God because our register you last week God's voice is not there they can't hear God's voice we are God's voice to them the Rhenish today we run God's voice to my mom I'm God's voice to my brothers I am I've got to reach out to them more I reach out before it has been many years you know I get to reach out again I got I'll reach out to the family numbers too difficult I reach out to them again yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God so when they go to church they can't hear from God it's it's own mouthpiece so God is turning on her God has already turned on all those organizations who can found her through the Prophet the bride but the voice of God will be in her that's what the Bible said the sphere and the bride say come I'm going to close right here I think that's it now kind of good switch over there you enjoyed side by God's grace I know a lot of you and I hope you can see that especially their faithful Saints here I hope that was good for you by God's grace but I hope you can see how this is so important for our date right now this was you know this was a thousand years ago but yet it's still applicable right now because the mother's children her daughters are still have a grip on our family and friends my you said I have many friends the nominations I don't want to see me lost they like the world unity they liked all this Pope stuff and we need God's grace to be able to tell them and warn them it's wrong I often warn people in our church but because I focused on pastor like I was just focused on our church I oftentimes forget to warn people outside the churches so can we just pray for that tonight that God will give us the grace to warn our family members to warn our friends and also then we can see if any idolatry or fornication slips into the church how about that that's grace Genet it would put my bookmark in there so don't lose my spot that's just great to me Heavenly Father Lord we love you tonight in Lord Lord this message and I brought it to the end right there because it touched my heart today as I was studying work and think that you gave a type of Ahab Jezebel Elijah and then Jezebel had daughters and had a daughter that married in Judah and corrupted the praise of God had cooked in all the worship of God the of the very tribe that was actually right with you and even perverted those who were right with you and or we see that repeated today we've had a a hat and a president we've had a Jezebel the Roman Catholic Church we've had an Elijah brother venom but now it's the daughter of Jezebel it's the mother is the daughters of the mother that are perverting Judah that are perverting even what seemingly were good churches father it's a reality of strikes home tonight help us not don't let it become common to us Lord God as Jesus said help us not to faint help us not to stop praying or God help us to keep praying for our loved ones so lord I pray right now to pray firt as I was mentioned our sister go brother vain I pray for their family and friends but Adam if he's got any family and friends Lord and denominations because it's thus saith the Lord they'll take the mark of the beast they don't come out father I pray for my family that are in denominations we're not against the people that our loved ones our friends and family Oh God I'm not against them against that system that binds them that binds the Holy Spirit away from them that offends the Holy Spirit grieves the Holy Spirit so that they can't even hear the message of the hour the truth about the Holy Ghost baptism the power of God the glory of God the word of God the true life that we should live and the doctrines that teach it dear God I pray for my mother I pray for my brothers dear God morning Jesus name I pray sophomore hearts father give me such boldness Lord may I pray I pray about it right now may I just text them tonight or something that is something tonight Lord let them know I love them Lord God I don't want to see that the old God be like Lot's wife or I don't want to see that I want to see them like loud or like Abraham come out of it all to your God I pray for all of our friends and family Lord as I said of the Saints here we pray for them give us a burden more to reach out to them nor did I pray for my friends outside of my family my many friends are going to die national churches give you the grace to reach out to them dear comma pray give her the grace let me to think of others nor God it's myself and Lord as we said earlier as your prophet taught us apply the same faith we have for our own salvation to our family so Lord we claim that tonight Lord I don't say it to be plainer out of the Lord I do claim that again as I had before I claim the salvation of my family in Jesus name I believe that we save just like I believe I just said if you're gone just as you change my life I believe you can change their lives Lord and I'll hang on to that promise Lord God apply the token Lord God apply the same faith I have for myself by your grace I'm saved and filled with the Holy Ghost you're going to do the same for our family and friends dear God we apply that token Lord in my mind my heart I I speak those names about heart I'm not going to say them
