midst of our trials and our light affliction of persecutions Jesus we give you all the glory Lord hotta merely in the good times and the hard times in the valley of the shadow of death on the mountaintops we give you all the glory lord thank you for life thank you for saving our souls thank you for sending us the word thank you for leaving the 99 to go get the one our God and bringing us back on your shoulders for Father we give you the glory tonight minister by your Holy Spirit meet every need Lord God wasn't getting an immanent here it means but an orange ago the needs were this morning you let them back up you can bring healing so many people need of music father you're our dealer only physician the great musician may you come on the center of these individuals like this here at night morning through your word father and grow just a little bit closer who we want to grow a lot again but help us to grow close to you more God and almost the hunger thirst for home your righteousness more thirsty tonight more of your spirit so how much more can you learn about break that is drawn closer to you in Jesus Christ the church said I was here like two scriptures let's go to Hebrews 10 let's go to go to our tents March 10 I just bruised part to both message from this morning you who turned their back on the spirit of grace so I want to look at a few more scriptures on the the spirit of grace and what the spirit of grace causes you to do so God's spirit of grace will bring somebody to the faith it'll justify them you know God's grace will teach them to be sanctified but if they turn their backs on that and they say I don't want to be sanctified anymore then they're really crucifying Christ of fresh and they're crucifying the effects of the Holy Spirit to further sanctify them or fill them with the Holy Ghost and then Jesus or the Bible said it's more sore punishment for them now I want to show you this it's in Titus chapter 2 which was really refreshing for me to find this so let's go to Titus chapter 2 see when Jesus saves us he saves us to wash us to present us as a spotless bride hey Rahab and that's the purpose so that's why he would punish someone who wanted who thought they wanted to be a part of the bride but then turns down the cleansing to be his bride because it was a free gift right salvation is a gift of God it's a free gift so God freely gives them this gift but then they turn around saying I don't want to be I don't want to be clean anymore I'd rather enjoy the things of the world and so because they turned on the free gift and despised and crucify the effects of Christ it's almost like in their life they're saying crucify that word alright we don't want that word we will not have this word to rule over us right that's the danger of people around the message that leave the message or say we won't have this word but this is the word of the hour this is the fresh word of God and if you won't let this word rule over you then you're gonna let Satan's word rule over you right the demon powers and demonic oppression and depression and oppression and possession demonic possession but the spirit of grace wants to cleanse you and once you present you spotless before God Almighty amen now that's Titus 2:11 here's what they turn down Titus 2:11 for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men's this is God's gift of grace teaching us that denying ungodliness so what is what is the spirit of grace teach to deny sin to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the Great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave him for himself for us that he might hear his redeem us from all iniquity and purity unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works I just notice that how you feel I just want to do something for Jesus that's how he wants the bride we just want to do something for the Lord I wanna do something good for the name of Jesus right these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise thee Paul tells us preacher this young preacher he said you preach these things don't let anybody tell you any differently you preach this word right here God's trying to clean out his bride and he's going to so see someone who does despite the spirit of grace and crucifies Christ afresh doesn't want to let godly or righteously they want to live sinfully okay so that's the spirit of grace that I want you to see that that's what the spirit of grace does now now remember acts 5:32 let's just turn there real quick they said I'll try to be real mindful the time here X 532 and this is just this is why I was saying this morning if were to go on with God if we're to grow in God we have to obey more of God's Word because God only gives a Holy Ghost about said whom and we are witnesses of these things and so is the Holy Ghost whom God has given to them that obey Him so something like Judas stopped obeying him and turn around and wanted the things of the world more and if we want to grow with God we've got to see God what do I need to obey at this stage in my life what is the scripture I'm not quite obeying that you want me to obey and then obey that and then God will bless you for taking that obedience right and it's always a death you know it's always a death to self it's always a crucifixion because he said take up the cross daily and follow me so every day is a self crucifixion of your will right it's a taking up across daily and so when we do that when we crucify the flesh and obey the word of God then it the reward is more of God's Spirit more of God's anointing amen so that's clear that everybody can see that by the grace of the Lord now let me I want to move forward here I want to make sure let's go back to Joshua 22 because I said something a little wrong this morning I want to correct it Joshua 20 to 1 I said there was only two tribes that didn't go over it was actually two and a half so forgive me I missed a half Joshua 22 verse 1 so from this morning's message there was 12 tribes and all of them all of them were promised the promised land land but two and a half of them said we don't want to cross over ourselves we want to live outside the promised land and that's a type of the foolish virgin we will go in and we'll experience someone that will taste of the things of God but we don't want to live in it but see we want to live in all the message right I want to live everything that this word says praise God I want to possess the land God has for me but see those two-and-a-half tribes looked out and they said well I don't really want that land I'd rather have this so see they they chose land of their own choosing rather than God's choosing and we've got to say God what is your choice for my life and help me to live that choice for your choice for my life not like well I like to be popular and rich and have a and try to still serve God no you can't you can't have the things of the world you got to have all of God amen you can't have some of God in some of the world you got to have all of God and that's what these tries are looking at like a lot they wanted riches and popularity and all these things popular you know just being a living with the people you know he wanted to live there in Sodom so he had all the blessings that look like the Garden of Eden with you know all this financial blessing but Abraham knew that's not what God has called us to God's not called us to mix with the world God's called us to live separate from the world and so the same thing happened to these tribes the two-and-a-half tribes so it's Joshua 22 one two four and I do it again forgive me I meant to say two-and-a-half but I knew that scripture out it's like a slip of the tongue I guess or slip of the mind I should probably say and it's okay you know I've heard recently preachers say a few things that slipped out like one brother said he said God he said don't you know God's not in having any more gods on earth he said don't you know deities not in heaven deities on earth now Church let's be honest Jesus Christ is in heaven right and the and everybody's saying shout an Amen during a sermon but I thought no that's not right the actual quote was brother don't you know deities not in have any more deities on earth you see what they're saying they're saying all of God is on earth and God's not in heaven the fact is gods in both because Jesus Christ is deity the illness of the Godhead is in Christ and Christ is at the right hand of the Father right now so see people mistake some of the quotes our brother brand where we say we're now the throne of God is in our heart well that's true but see that that what they do is they get they make a mistake and they say well if the throne of God is our heart now then there's no more throne in heaven and that's wrong see they take they take that type too far are you with me yes the throne of God is on our hearts now but it's just a temporary throne the real throne of God is in heaven so see if I made a slip this morning forgive me I didn't mean to make it I didn't mean to say it wrong but I did make a mistake it wasn't two tribes it was two and a half but I hear I hear other brothers you know we all make mistakes we're all human that's why our faith is not in a man our faith is in the word our faith is in Jesus Christ so we never exalt a man and we always look to the word behind the man Joshua 20 to 1 then Joshua called the rubra nights and the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh see there it is it's two and a half I missed that half forgive me and he said then you have kept all that Moses the servant LORD commanded you and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you you have not left your brethren these many days under this day but I've kept the charge of your commandment of the Lord your God and now the Lord your God has given rest under your brethren and as he promised them therefore now return you and get you unto your tents and unto the land of your possession which Moses a servant of the Lord gave you on the other side of Jordan so see they chose we don't want to live on this side of Jordan we don't want to be baptized with the Holy Ghost but we'll help them out but once they got what they want we're gonna come back and we're gonna go we're gonna live outside of the promised land oh what a what a rational mistake what and it was all because they were cattle raisers and they thought well this is better ground for cattle how foolish don't they know that if the ground doesn't look like it's good cattle ground either God will change the ground to be good cattle ground or God will give you a different job you won't do cattle you do something else but God's calling for you and I and for them was to take the promised land but they used mental human reasoning which means they must not I got up to knowledge on the statue pervert man if it wasn't the Old Testament I'm just saying if it was and they reason they said well we're cattle raisers and we'll just stay outside the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we'll be foolish virgin we'll come right up to the gates of the baptism and then we won't go in and we'll just be happy out there oh no God wanted them to possess the land and that's what we've got to do we're gonna have to possess all the promises of God so does that help now by God's grace see those foolish version they'll help out the bride they will be good to the bride amen thank God they will give the bride clothes they'll give the bride food they'll visit the bride in in their Hospital amen they'll visit the bride there were six things remember the sixteen jesus said because you did it to the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me and here they good they go fight with them they help them out all right all right you know Simeon all right Simmons we helped you get the land praise the Lord or Judah we hope to get the land all right now see you later we don't want to live in this kind of land we don't want to live like you holy rollers we're gonna go back outside can you imagine what that's what they thought they thought we'll be more blessed by our own financial choosing rather than trusting that if God placed us in a land he'll provide for us oh my thank the Lord for His mercy Church so I want you to see that and I hope that helps you here all right oops Barbie sorry now let's see it a few more things let me I want to read this quote from brother Branham it's it's from I says it in numerous places in the third seal brother man said you can be sanctified without being justified and you can be justified without being sanctified you can be sanctified without receiving the Holy Ghost that's exactly now that's what brother that's what Judas did Judas was justified sanctified but he forgot the holy ghost and so striking the brother Graham says that because Hebrews 10:29 says that you can be sanctified but then trodden under foot the Son of God or the Holy Ghost now they asked brother Branham in questions and answers part three they said brother Branham on one of the tapes of the seven church age as you mentioned that Judas had been justified and sanctified were these genuine experiences his grace that he received Obama have said now that's a good one this would be good I'll have to depend on the Lord to answer this this is a good question was it genuine now bro Graham never says the word genuine again but he says over and over again that Judas was justified and sanctified so Judas had a genuine experience he'd been saved right he was believing to be saved and he started building up a statue of a perfect man but then he sold it out at the end so let me read this and I'm just gonna go quickly so the first scripture brother man mentions is what we read this more actually we didn't read it let's go to Luke chapter 10 where he said the Devils were subject unto us and Jesus have rejoiced not that your name's rejoice now that you can cast out Devils but that your names are written in heaven okay yeah this is Luke 10:17 so the first scripture brother Branham reference about Judas is this scripture now these are the seventy these are not the twelve okay but remember we saw from this morning the seventy and twelve were given the same Commission they were to go into their cities preach the gospel and then Jesus would follow up as a latter rain amen I like that glory that's the type for our day amen the seventy returned again with joy saying Lord even the Devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said to them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven behold I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you not withstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rejoice rather because your names are written in heaven so brother man tells us not to get too excited about miracles although we think God for miracles but don't get too excited about them but get excited that your names written in heaven that's how we that's what we need to rejoice overhead and that's why you know I used to get really nervous if I hadn't seen a miracle for a while but God has had to deliver me of my immaturity on that and realize that's not what will rejoice in those things happen in God's time and season when we can all get in one Accord right miracles the that all happens when we get all the unbelief out and then God can move but the main thing to be happy about is that you're saved and your name is on the book of life that's more important in other words that's a greater miracle than all these other things is that you can be saved from your sins and have eternal life amen that's greater than any natural sickness because you'll just get sick again and die right so that's the first Scripture brother man brings out he said now see the attitude was wrong and she imagined Jesus knew this and seventy people come back and say we can cast out devils and Jesus says your attitude is wrong he said you mustn't rejoice because you've got received enough because you've cast out Devils and then he talks about how usually the people that has gifts are the people that don't want gifts Paul tried to run from the thing so did Moses great leaders like that try to run from the job they know what lays before them it's the guy that don't want nothing to do with it see that's the guy God can take him and teach him something you see in other words God doesn't want people to be big shots like look what I can do I can cast out Devils he wants people to just rejoice that they're saved amen and not to become a big shot all right now the next he says he's now he goes to this where Jesus tells Peter when you get converted strengthen the Brethren I think that's Luke 22 let's go there I know some of these are familiar but I just want to lay them down so you can see the scripture on this cuz this was like I said a fresh revelation to me because what I was doing as your turn to Luke 22 what I was doing was just taking one quote from seed of discrepancy where brother Ram said Judas never had no faith to begin with I was just taking that quote but I had kind of skipped over all the other ones where brother Ram said he did have faith he was saved and that's why I was brother branham or anybody we got to take everything they say back to the Word of God and then when I searched the scripture I read Hebrews 10 yesterday and it says he was sanctified it doesn't say he was pretending to be sanctified he was sanctified and then you have these other scriptures that we've went over this morning about how they genuinely had the power of God they were generally walking with God but then they sold it out and left and then the the type is we saw in Hebrews 4 the type was Israel they genuinely went through the Red Sea and then the four grounds it genuinely received the seat of God it was the genuine seat of God but it let the cares of the world choke it out remember all these things it was a genuine experience until they compromised on the Word of God so I just want to share that again okay yeah it's I'm sorry Luke 22:31 and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I and then member simeons agitate means to shake your up your life he wants to shake your foundation right he wanted to give an earthquake and Peter spiritual life and break up his foundation right he said about I prayed for you that your faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren so brother random uses this scripture and he says see just because your name's in heaven on the on the book of life still doesn't mean you're saved you're not converted until you receive the Holy Ghost you're only potentially converted right so if you're just saved us if you're just just by your sanctified you're only potentially in other words the three works of grace aren't finished yet but you're on your road and brother Graham talks about if I gave you an acorn do you have a cornfield yet no but it's he said it's potentially said he said if I asked for cornfield and I see corn about about that high potentially I have a field of corn not it isn't developed yet something could happen amen and that's like Judas he started growing but something happened he turned around and forsook the truth he said now you're on your road through justification sanctification to the baptism and Holy Ghost but when you're gently baptized with the Holy Ghost you're in the kingdom he says now you say brother branham is that true and that's where he goes to John 17:17 where Jesus said sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth now remember at that moment Judas was gone remember that Judas left in John 13 and he missed all the preaching Jesus did when they left the Last Supper and went to the garden Yosemite Jesus preached on the Holy Ghost the whole way there and Judas missed that because he wanted to go make some money so he missed them preaching on the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then Jesus he prayed for them in the garden he said Lord sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth and Jesus knew they had a little over fifty more days to be sanctified and Judas wasn't there right he laughs so when Jesus prayed Judas wasn't there he didn't get the prayer for sanctification so brother has to see that that's true the sanctification was prayed for by Jesus and after you're converted then you can strengthen your brother and then we see where'd Peter at the beginning of the ministry he could stand in his own City and say Jesus the Messiah but then when a little maid woman come up and he's warming his hands and said do you know Jesus curse blankety-blank he's a custom preacher I don't even know him and he lost the strength to stand up and say I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them he lost it because of fear and I love what I heard brother Donny say about that he said that the night before he was like Jesus I'll die for you and then all the disciples said we won't deny you and Jesus said you will and I like what brother Donny said he said Peter said that because he never been tested that hard in his life before and I thought nah that's what I need to remember before we boast and say something like oh I can say it can never tempt me away from message before we say that let us be humble enough to say by God's grace because Peter said I won't deny you and all this I per said ha I died with you but they never been tested with arrest yet or death and church that's what you and I need to say we've never been beaten for the message yet have we I've never been arrested or beaten for the message so as to make sure our boasting is not boasting but it's faith you understand in other words if I say both Amen I'll never fall away from this message by the grace of God by God's help not by my strength but by God's strength you see I think that's so beautiful because Peter had all this he had it but then when the temptation came Satan come and spoiled all those things except faith out of his life because Jesus said I pray that your faith fail not amen is that helped by God's grace by he said Peter still wasn't converted and that means change which means that's the seal of the Holy Ghost he said when you get converted then strengthen the Brethren ah he said you're just leading when you get saved and sanctified you're just leading to conversion he says all right let me move ahead here and brother man now he shows how Judas sold out and he said just like some of them sells out a Methodist a Baptist or whatever more sold out his position on the book of life he'll have to stand there and be judged by that by the word that's why Judas had to do it Judas has has to come to the judgment his name was on the book of life but that don't mean he's saved he has to stay on the judgment he said the sleeping version will stand right there under the same things he said that's he that can receive and not he that hears it and just preach it and goes on and say nonsense he that receiveth my word he that heareth my word and believeth not make believe but truly believe on him that has sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life so just showing how Judas and the foolish version can hear and respond to it but you've got to keep going on with God he said so Judas had his name there on the book of life but he was condemned because what'd he do he sold out his birth rights and brother man went right to Esau who sold out his birthright to be born in the family of Christ he sold it out for a bowl of lentils and if I'm not mistaken aren't lentils beans can you imagine selling out Christ for a bunch of beans that's what he did because his own his own belly was his God that's what the Bible says so any preacher that sells out the baptism holy ghost of the message for money sake is really making their belly their God so Esau was his example and then the spies that went to Canaan ten of them come back and said we can't take it but Joshua Caleb he said well that's what the ten knew they sold out their birth rights but he said Caleb and Joshua had the faith to take the promised land now let's go back to Hebrews 6 now cuz this is what brother man reads next and I mentioned this earlier this is familiar but let's read it again cuz this all flows together and bear with me here I'm gonna I got about 18 more minutes so that'll be 45 minutes Hebrews 6 now this there's some there's some more Revelation in here too and verse 1 this has to all tie in there with a statue perfect man as well but look at verse 1 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection not laying the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God and that's striking foundation faith is the foundation see how that lines up with second Peter faith virtue and here Paul says not laying in the foundation of faith and repentance see how it goes together that's beautiful of the doctrine of baptisms on the laying on of hands and of the resurrection of that and the eternal judgment and this we will do if God permit for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame my for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom at his dress receiveth blessings from God but that which bear thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though thus we speak for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and your labor of love which you have showed toward his name and then that you've ministered to the Saints and you minister amen to see there's going to be some that they just partake of the Holy Ghost but they don't minister to the people of God see the difference some people are out there just trying to get the anointing to do things to build up their kingdom for money but others do it to glorify God and to help out the body of Christ amen glory and we desire that every one of you show the same what's what's that word again diligence see that all of our human effort is required to be the bride all of our human effort all of our earnestness we must say God add this to me add this to me I want to draw closer to you because now it's Paul and Peter both saying the same thing show diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises amen so brother man ties this scripture together he said it's impossible for them to come back he said it's impossible for that person never come back everyone besides Joshua and Caleb died in the wilderness in Paris of Lourdes yet they were believers yet their names were on the books so brother BAM says he and he's him he even calls it a gate he said in Paul speaking here if he ever comes to a spot he's been saved and sanctified and then comes right up to the gate of the baptism of the Holy Ghost he calls it a gate ah and because of prestige or denomination refused to walk in it said that person is lost and can never be saved for he's done despite even to the very works of grace it's calling him up to that place and shown it to him and then he turns around and walks away from it he counts the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was crucified Christ was crucified as an unholy thing because the blood that saved him and justified him and sanctified him brings him up to the baptism the Holy Ghost and then he walks away and leaves it he said now watch that pattern I'm taking a lot of time but look Judas Iscariot follow that same tracks he was justified by the believing on the Lord Jesus and then accepting him as the personal Savior he was sanctified and given power to cast out spirits but isn't put his name on the the book of life but when it come to the Pentecost and the Batsuit Holy Ghost the fullness of the word he showed his colors that's exactly what the Canaan spies did that's exactly what Esau did he that's exactly what Satan said to Eve in the Garden of Eden surely God will not but she said God said he said yea I know it says that I know it says is but surely see the same thing all the way down so it is today he said the church has followed through justification Martin Luther through thanks sanctification Wesley but when it comes to the time of the baptism the Holy Ghost they show their colors they want nothing to do with it Nazarene pilgrim Holiness Church of God all those there who believe in st. vacation you can't lay a finger and it's the truth but when it comes to the borderline comes right to the spot to receive the Holy Ghost for the new birth then what the devil do come around and try to twist it around oh he'll do everything that's in his known power to keep the people out of there amen don't you know all hell is against us getting to the Batchelor the Holy Ghost but all of heaven is behind us if we'll just believe it amen all of how he said Saint will do everything to keep people out of the baptismal there he goes that's why we got to be doing everything we can pray we can preach everything we can do to try to get people in there amen oh thank the Lord amen he wants tribes to camp on the outside of Jordan he wants just just live that kind of life because he doesn't want to be cast out of the promised land right Satan doesn't want those seven nations cast out of there but God wants to cast all of those demons out of there God wants the land to be possessed hallelujah with believers the RAM said don't you let no one tell you that sanctification and the Holy Ghost are the same thing because it's not it's certainly not oh thank the Lord it's not the same thing and then he gives the samples how brother man new Nazareth Christians that were sanctified but then they spoke evil the tongues and brother Bram said they blasting the Holy Ghost yet they come all the way up the same vacation but when you say oh you need to have a real experience and get born again you might speak in tongues they say that's the devil and program said they blaspheme the Holy Ghost right there and now the way to know is watch do they move on with God or do they camp out and denominator and we all know they denominator they never want more they never want to know what are the seals mean what does the rapture mean they never really cried to God for that revelation but it's laying right in here in the Bible that the mysteries of God should be finished amen and see they don't want to go on to that they don't want to believe God's in a profit they don't want to believe that see they stopped they camped out and many of them turn back and go back to the worldly things for pleasures of the world now if they generally don't understand church and they camp right out there and they can still be saved right because they're the they're that they're the type of the two and a half tribes but were the type of Joshua glory amen if you don't believe that say God help me to believe that so I can be one of those over comers amen now to see that they walk up to the border I like those spies did that eat part of the grapes but what they do have to do they'd have to break up their denomination and come over to this they say tasted the heavenly gift see seeing they have crucify themselves the Son of God afresh and count the blood of the Covenant wherewith they were saying to find an unholy thing he says sanctification does that see you come up when you trust it up this far then come up they say well would he know it yes he'd noted he knowed you wouldn't do it in the beginning he no Judas wouldn't do it he knowed him from the beginning he was a son of perdition but then thing has to be fulfilled the word has to be fulfilled all through the types and shadows he said we could stay on that for hours so see God knew Judas and those spies would come right up to the promised land but then fall away but he has to allow them to happen to fulfill the types in the scripture right now to me that was the most important quote there's if you just type in Judas and sanctify there's 14 quotes and it all says the same thing now let me get to the one where program said Judas never had faith to begin with and go to Romans chapter 8 and this is why I just misunderstood it you know I was just taking one quote but I doubt the other quotes and God forgive me you know what I was thinking probably in my mind was well I'll just take the one that's later since it's 1965 I'll take it later then the 53:54 and you know 64 I'll just take the later and you know I'll be honest I'm like anyone else I have to grow a revelation too and I want to be humble enough to say that now I don't have everything figured out I'm not God I don't have all the answers only Christ has all the answers but I want to be able to grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord so Romans 8 now this was the scripture that stumbled me and I appreciate right from this pulpit probably you know probably 10 20 times so I'm in Romans 8 I want to get to the scripture yeah 30 first 30 Romans 8 30 so this is the scripture I was hanging on but I was also missing the other scriptures I read this morning moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he also called he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified now see how I was reading this thinking well if you're justified truly then you already have a glorified body but I was missing the other scriptures about how the Bible said he was sanctified already so this scripture is speaking of God's predestinated amen so those who God knows are going to continue in other words those who are going to continue in the faith God has already predestinated a glorified body for those who he knows are going to go all the way and so see that's what I was missing the word right there three does it was only for the predestinated that get justified because Judas got justified the 70 got justified but remember later Jesus said you must eat my blood or eat my flesh and drink my blood and they said see I'm leaving this church say yeah I don't want no more of that and they walked away as well because they had the wrong attitude in the beginning they thought it's just about me doing miracles it's about me me me instead they didn't have the attitude where it's about the Word of God amen and they're like well I can do miracles if I can understand it it must be of the devil if I could only have the understanding and said see that the wrong attitude they were looking at themselves and miracles rather than looking at the person of the word and saying I'll just believe whatever the word says where else could we go you've got the words to eternal life see they were in love with the gifts instead of the giver there it is right there they love the gifts but they didn't love the giver because when it come down to some deep thing of the Holy Spirit they I can't understand that but the Bible said he freely gives us the deep understandings of the things of God you just got a home of yourself to a babe just gotta say I'm just like a little child Jesus feed me teach me I'm just I'm humble nothing show me your great deep mysteries in really Church when you get down to it's real simple but you have to have the attitude first of on nothing I'm a humble help me Jesus just to understand it so see that's what I missed now also now it makes sense here in 1st Peter 1:9 so Lydia can you pull it up first Peter 1:9 and now if I combine it with this one now I got a better understanding Peter says receiving the end of your faith so say Judas never received the end of his faith because he sold it out but all those who received the end of their faith have a glorified body waiting for permission but those are the predestinated ones the ones that God knew would keep the faith to the end they're not the ones who draw back and leave the word right and leave the message they're the ones who stay with the word now does everybody can everybody see now why I say that so see that's where not now now I'd have a different opinion about the seat of discrepancy where brother have said Judas never had faith to begin with I would just have to disagree and say well I think he did because there's other quotes from Adam said he did have faith so see when you ever have quotes on both sides there's a you know the truth is somewhere you know it's either on one of those sides or in the middle in this case it was there it was the ones that were before because of what Hebrew says and what the scripture says okay a few more scriptures here and we'll try to be finishing up here let me make sure I didn't miss out anything okay yeah let's go to first Timothy 4 verse 4 just now these are familiar I just want to point them out to you first Timothy 4:4 first Timothy 4 for now I'm sorry for one sorry I wrote down the wrong number first Timothy 4:1 now the spirit speaketh expressly than the latter times some shall depart from the faith that's what Judas did he departed from the faith the faith never left him God will never leave you right but you can leave God thank God I'm never leaving him that means he'll never leave me praise God see they departed he left the faith he left Jesus he left that Last Supper what the death angel got him because he left the the house of the Last Supper right the death angel got him out there Satan entered into him so see it say they departed from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils see they leave it they draw back there are the ones that leave second Thessalonians 2 verse 3 this is a familiar one I just want to I'm you know bring this to your members second Peter 2 I'm sorry second Thessalonians sorry 2 verse 3 Paul says don't be shaken about the coming of the Lord and verses 1 and 2 don't get all shaken up don't let the devil try to sift you and try to shake up your your foundation you stand firm on God's Word you just stand there you stand on the solid rock your foundation is not shifting or singing sands your foundation is the rock of God's Word Paul tells them don't be shaken by say verse three let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition I don't doubt there there's some good people in the nominations right now but when it comes time for the rapture and the squeeze they are going to fall away either they're going to come out of her my people or they're gonna fall away they're gonna sell out whatever virtues they have a god they're gonna sell it out for money just like Judas oh my can you see that a great I'm sorry there come a falling away first yes I thought it said great but doesn't say great he just has a falling away so I don't want to add to the word there comes a falling away first and that means a falling away a defection apostasy just like Judas they depart the word they come up to the gate of the Holy Ghost and they turn around and don't want any more of it alright okay let me just do a few more quotes it's natural for man brother BAM says this well Ram said if you cept a little saying like you can't trust the Bible he said if you got that in your mind don't try to add it because it won't work the whole building will fall right down there and that was just knowledge faith virtue knowledge if you let somebody tell you oh you can't trust the Bible he said your building will fall down see the whole thing it's obscene God's building something and you add this add this add this he's building something he's building a temple of God amen now I'm skipping ahead to another quote the man said temperance he says holy spirit temperance how to control your tongue not be a Tattler control your temper not flying off every time somebody speaks across to you boy a lot of us are gonna fall off before we get started aren't we then we wonder why God's not in this church doing miracles and things like they used to do see miracles and all these gifts it all depends on the anointing we bring to church or the anointing we live with in our daily life see Brennan said this is the reason why there's not more miracles in the church people are letting God build them up and say to that anointing all the time we can all say amen to that all right so the times where God has done miracles it proves we're on one Accord nobody was worried about this outside of church nobody was into that sin nobody was into that said nobody was had a schism in their family or they like that everybody come to the house of God and God's Spirit amen but we have to be patient even we have to go through times where there may be no miracles right we have to be patient with one another you have to be patient with me I have to be patient with you why because patience is one of those virtues see by medicine see a lot of us gonna fall off before we get started on that way she bowed and said see see how short we are brother and sister he said we have glory and shouts and things because we got faith but when we come down to these things here he God can't build us into that stature he can't he can't make us up to that kind of a place we got all these other things we fall down he said slide off with it see they slide off that that highway they slide off like a like ice on the road right you slide off he said see he can't build his church build he can't build his church people slide off or it falls off it just gets destroyed at school last week I taught him the stature of man and I got eight of these boxes and I had the students put faith virtue knowledge and I showed how God built the church faith virtue and now I don't struggle with this anymore now I got knowledge now I got temperance and then the devil come by and he took it away like that you know knock him down now not with charity though if you got charity though all those things are sealed into you but that's how it is God wants to add this but if people want to sell out to the devil the devil will knock it over say look what I've done now I've entered into Judas and now I can do evil things but we've got to let God so build us up and so cap us off that were always a part of the building of God that we can be a dwelling place for the Living God now let me try to find echo base to closer brother man says this he says that's the way some people can come up that high but man talks about sanctification and drop-off but there's a genuine part of that keeps making that building come on I will restore saith the Lord see boat man so you can come up this high but then thought all the way down oh my well I wonder you know we were talking a bit about this let me let's say into our feet here and let me just uh share this this this story here let me share two things out let's go to Ephesians four this deals with the fivefold ministry then I just want to share this story we were talking about with a message Church I just want to share that just I'll just try to shorten it Ephesians 4:14 see when we really tap into the power that's in the fivefold ministry because it's Christ power remember Christ got up in heaven and you know people might wonder well what would Jesus send to his church since he's in heaven what he decide to send was five preaching gifts a man he could have said anything sister Connie he could have sent angels to preach but he said instead I'm gonna save man through man amen that was God's pattern that it's never changed and he said God only works through man to save man he could have sent the most beautiful angels with wings and say Oh believe me get the Holy Ghost that everyone said yeah but he said God said I'm sending five types of preaching gifts that the Church of the Living God will believe the werden of God and I'll used man to redeem man pieces for 14 that we henceforth be no more children see the reason people are immature is because they don't listen to the fivefold ministry and it's not me like oh I'm not trying to exalt preachers what I'm saying is that God only speaks through preachers and if you want to be mature you've got to hear what the preachers are saying from the Word of God I've got to do it you've got to do it we all got to obey the preaching tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slate that means trickery like a like a card game like a gambling game by the slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive I like verse fears 15 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ see how we're growing up what are we growing up into we're growing up into Christ the capstone amen so stay with the fivefold ministry and God will keep growing you up into Christ and that's God's ladder amen the stats for a man and it's through the preaching of the fivefold ministry that you'll grow up that ladder into Christ the Amen see it's not that it's not our plan it's God's plan it's not the preachers trying to say we'll pass on the back I can't even you you and I can't do nothing we're nothing without the anointing we're nothing without Jesus we can't help anybody without Jesus but when we get in the control by Jesus Jesus does great things amen this is why people go from one window dr. no.11 immaturity and a baby Christians they never grow up into maturity because they don't listen to the fivefold ministry but if we do we'll go right up into Christ or get closer and closer and closer to Christ until we're in Christ and Christ isn't us amen right said why don't I go to church he said I go to church for one thing that's to stay in your presence Lord let me close with this I just want to tell this story real quick most of you know it we were talking about it at at lunch we've seen a lot of people fall away from the message and it's it's sad it's heartbreaking but the ones I've seen fall I've known for preachers and all four of them I had to hear them I heard them preach on the Holy Ghost and they all preached it wrong they each one of them preached it wrong and all four of them said you got the Holy Ghost when you believed when you got saved and like I mean how many times his brother Brennan has to preach that and they never caught it they never caught it and all four of them I heard them three in person no two in person and two on tape they all said that and that's why that's one of the main reasons they left now the one example we gave was a young man and woman they got married and this man from what everybody says he was just that he just kept the word so much everybody thought he was so godly and all the girls liked him you know maybe they kind of thought he was great he had a great gift of music and things like that and he went through marriage counseling and everybody thought he was born again everybody thought he had the Holy Ghost but he went to the church where the pastor said you get the Holy Ghost when you believe yeah that's right sometime after their marriage this and this was a pretty prominent person this man got tempted with homosexuality and he divorced his wife and he's now an open homosexual and the reason I share that is because if someone is not truly baptized with the Holy Ghost and if they stop seeking God Satan's gonna get them if I mean if they're not foolish virgin right Saints gonna get them we must preach the baptism the Holy Ghost the right way and then we must never give up or back go back on God we must always go forward with the things of God and never feel like we've arrived now we can be happy if we feel like we're born again but don't stop there keep growing in Christ I just want to give that example and they were sitting under some of the biggest names and the message as far as the most respected men and I'm not I'm not downing message preachers I love message preachers I want to be one of them but I'm just saying like it doesn't matter which ministry you're under you and I every person has to have a revelation that they're born again yeah in fact I listened this preacher his resignation and this is he takes a quote from brother brand where brother BAM said a man was sinning his wife was saved his his wife game a track and I said where are you spend eternity and this man said he went to Billy Graham's but Billy Graham's meetings and Billy Graham said let's say a prayer and you're safe he did he said that was enough so he went to Oral Roberts and old Robert said speaking tongues and you got it and then he got it he spoke in tongues but then he wasn't satisfied he went to brother Branham and brother Graham said you've already got it now brother Ram this story brother I've never used it after the seals just so you know so this pastor got all caught up on well brother branham said you can get the Holy Ghost just by reading a tract but see this was an incomplete story brother been told this before the trip before the revelation came on the Holy Ghost and so see that's why this pastor in other words this pastors absolute was a story instead of the word there it is right there your absolute on the Holy Ghost has to be the word not a story in other words do I know do I know have I experienced ax2 or not we must all ask ourselves what experience have we had have we had an axe to experience or we just trying to base our testimony off of something else as much as we respect stories and brother branham stories and all these things this proves right here you can't base your faith upon anything outside of the unfailing Word of God amen because even those of us who seem to be the most talented the most gifted the most anointing if we're not born again can fall away we must never say and brag and say well I'll never fall away I'll never leave Ghana we must never do that even brother Brad said that he said God could use me as a tool for something even brother Brad was humbled to admit he said I believe my name's written on lands book of life but God could use me as a tool for something so see how humble we got to be as here let's come to the piano here I better stop right here I hope you understand that now with this pastor like I said this church the church his brother went to allowed women to cut their hair allowed women to wear makeup had a very false stance on ministers marriage requirements this pastor also mistreated brother Brooks and made fun of him how he worshipped in the Holy Ghost as a master Church oh yeah big one he also allowed his children to listen to rock and roll in his home with headphones on and it's on tape I've heard it and program said if you want the token you better kick out that trash out of your house but this guy thought well I can teach a family camp everybody's looking to me it's okay for me to let rock n roll my house and it's not that's a a can move Aiken brought the evil in this house and said it's okay we'll just hide it no only goes for Christian we'll drive that out and then the six thing was the wrong teaching on the batches in the Holy Ghost so see there were red flags all around in sister County God knows before that man resigned I thought what in the world how can this guy be saved God knows I thought that how can this guy have the Holy Ghost he left the women paint their faces and wear makeup and rock and roll before he resigned he let his children's skip out of the services and sit in his office and listen to music and rock and roll and read books while he was out there preaching trying to get people to I don't know believe the message or not who knows that's what that's what deacons in his church I've told me that I talked to he was letting his adores our teenage children not even be in the service so they missed the worship the anointing they missed the preaching all because he was upset with some of these quotes and some of these people he let them sit out and that's wrong everybody needs to hear the word of God if you don't receive the Word of God you'll starve spiritually and see what were they doing he was letting them feed on the things of the world in his study rather than feed on the word of God and this whole time we knew something's wrong red flags are flying everywhere something's wrong with this guy he's making fun of brother Brooks with the Holy Ghost he's let them cut their hair wear makeup all these red flags and then finally in 2014 it shows up and now we know what happened we've got to go all the way in the Kanaan's land are you f me no matter where you feel like you are you've got to say it God I'm gonna go further in amen I want more of God's Word I want to grow in grace I want to grow up into Christ said everything we did everything in my life when people look at me they see Christ I don't compromise on nothing but I keep the ways of Christ the ways of godliness [Music] everybody with me tonight what a good Sunday night service prays to the heart see you're either growing up into Christ or you're departing from Christ program said it's so plain to you you cannot stay right you
