the church let's go to psalm 24 please verse 7 psalm 24 7. that's quite a good scripture psalms 24 7 you're singing psalms 24 7. all the time singing and making melody in your heart to the lord psalm 24 7. thank god what a beautiful scripture this is saints coming into heaven heaven has gates heaven has doors praise god and they open up to the king of glory hallelujah thank you jesus let's read verses seven eight nine and ten together let's read that on three one two three lift up your heads o ye gates and be lift up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle lift up your heads o ye gates even lift them up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory let's have a word of prayer let's bow our heads here for a moment if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto god heavenly father we just come reverently tonight we're so glad we can sing we're one of them lord god we're so glad that we're under the blood for when you see the blood you'll pass over us god thank you for the token as we looked at even on sunday and the previous time we're together lord thank you god for your grace thank you for all you've done we just come reverently humbly tonight god we ask the lord that you bless this reading of thy word lord break the word again to our hearts lord god as we we know lord that you said blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they hear and the mysteries of the kingdom were given to us lord as believers so we're grateful for these mysteries lord god they unveil your truth lord god that we might walk in further light we're grateful for more light our lives can shine more and more unto a perfect day because of your grace lord we see so many lord their lives are going darker and darker but lord we want to see our lives growing lighter and lighter uh lord to a perfect uh man a stature of a perfect man the fullness of the stature of christ according to granted god tonight that more light will shine on our hearts in our lives and we'll walk in the fullness of your light today bless your people bless the saints that press their way out to the house of god abundantly lord and be with those live streaming or watching on the archive feed your people lord feed their hungry souls we pray in jesus christ's name as the saints said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god so by god's grace tonight we'll finish lord winning this series i got three more mystery godhead mystery i've got the mystery of the seven stars and seven candlesticks they got the mystery of the jews and gentiles composing one body so i have those three left to preach to you uh and i've really been enjoying these uh uh these series here that'll be all twelve after that uh and then we got through all those by the grace of the lord the book's going good the gentleman emailed me this week it's a hundred i'm sorry it's 840 pages right now so uh that's pretty long book not as long as that shakespeare book we got but it's pretty long uh he he recommends i break it up into two parts which i thought was really good because it's like the two stacks of bread right there's 12 pieces of shoe brand they're in two stacks of six so i just thought maybe that would be inspired uh but i'm really excited it's still a set for a june release date so thank the lord for that and we'll just trust the lord we'll use it to uh to find those last few souls that want to know the revelation of the mystery of god so tonight let's look at this here uh last time we ended with uh looking at the proverbs 31 woman how she's the type of the bride of jesus christ everything she does uh is a blessing that she's hard to find right uh and she excelled all of the other women right she she was such a godly woman uh her husband praised her her children blessed her and she excelled all the other women so she's a woman above all women and we know that types the bride of jesus christ because she is without spot or without wrinkle you know there's many women or many churches claiming to be the bride of jesus christ but we know there's just one praise god that's the blood washed blood of jesus christ so tonight i want to look at the rewards of being the true bride and then the consequences for rejecting this revelation and i just want to do like a a review i just want to kind of remind us of some of the highlights here i did set my timer so i got 30 minutes i'll try to maybe start closing in 30 minutes by god's grace i looked up some new numbers on the number of uh people in some of these groups and it's just astounding to think about but just astounding so let's look at the rewards here uh maybe that the children can have their bibles ready maybe they like to read a little bit you can read some scriptures here tonight so let's look at the rewards if you and i receive the revelation of the church as jesus's bride we're given great rewards now in this life but also in the life to come so the first one are the rewards here and now our first reward is the assurance of eternal life the bible says that we have assurance through the seal of the holy ghost the bible says you are sealed you are marked unto the day of your redemption remember that's an engraving uh we'd say that's a it's like a permanent scarring upon we'd say something that's the that's what the mark means it's like a stamping on and so you have that seal of god you are marked eternally you are gods amen you belong to god praise the lord that's your first uh your first reward is you are forever eternally god's you're marked by his nature so you have you will always have jesus's nature ruling your human nature aren't you glad for that that you will never get so far where uh you know your nature might might show itself for a short period of time but because you've surrendered to jesus christ his nature is gonna bring you back into correction praise god that is an eternal seal thank god that we're marked and we belong to christ we are marked and the bible says that proves we are in his mind before the world was praise god because the bible said we were chosen in christ before the foundation of the world and all those that don't have the mark of christ many of them will take the mark of the beast right and the bible said because their names were not on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world amen so that proves our names were on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world praise god we are not planning on bowing to the roman catholic church right we are still protesting the authority of the pope right he has no real bible because he's off the scripture he has no bible truth right so we are still in the protestant uh time right we are protesting the false authority of the roman catholic church and we are the true bride of jesus christ all right so we have that assurance that's the first reward you have assurance in your soul it's eternal praise god people that are born again don't have that assurance that's why you can see them they go off and they try to find other things they're trying to satisfy their souls right whether it's drugs or money other kinds of things they'll try anything to satisfy their souls because they don't have that eternal assurance in their souls thank god for his grace the second reward i'm going kind of quickly is we get to see the fruits of our decisions right uh the bible says matthew 5 16. i'm calling on lydia she's the oldest he's used to me calling on it right lydia please don't hold it against me matthew 5 verse 16 but you're the oldest son you're up to the challenge matthew 5 16 church we will live and see the fruits of our decision and so will other people this is a reward for bringing being the true bride of christ so lydia can you read that for us amen now think about this we're not the mother harlot they're not shining the light of god right the foolish virgin are they really shining the light of god no because their lamp went out right their oil went out so they cannot shine the real light of god but the bride of jesus christ her life and that remember light always means knowledge in the scripture uh light or revelation the light shines before men and they see our good works and glorify our father which is in heaven amen so we have left the foolish virgin group and we've left the mother harlot church and we enjoy a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty because the bible says all those spiritual blessings are giving to us amen it's land it's spiritual land that we're possessing as we saw on sunday praise god every spiritual blessing has been given to us so we shine in that light we walk in that light our character speaks louder than other people's character it's a reward on this earth you're a light to all men the bible said you shine before men praise god we're not free control and spiritually separated from the world we have a light that we shine because we have oneness with christ like moses amen was in the prince of god and his face showed we should stay in the friends of god and our spiritual life should shine out to the world that's right so we see we have eternal assurance that's our first reward second is the fruits of our decision or the light of our testimony shines and people see it in this day it's so much different than all the other ones right all the other denominations and third i just put this one in here i thought if you and your family receive it your home life is blessed right just like the proverbs 31 uh woman right in god's presence in your home is your treasure so you have treasure you know out in public you're a light right you have assurance in here but your home is a place of treasure as well praise god because the bible says parents and children they love one another and they're living in godly harmony home is like heaven on earth praise god just like the church the church should be we should be seated in heavenly places amen and our church should be like a atmosphere where the holy spirit is welcome to dwell praise god and so our church should resemble heaven on earth because we're seated higher in spiritual spheres and spiritual places our thoughts are on things above praise god not on this earth that we don't have carnal thoughts but our thoughts are on things above amen so those three great rewards eternal assurance in here we have a testimony that shines out publicly and our home life is blessed by the treasure of the holy spirit amen now your heavenly rewards are quite uh familiar to us but i'm going to go through them because the children can get them that maybe this time if they haven't got them the first reward lord willing is you'll be in the rapture praise god because it's only for the bride this is the climatic event of human history imagine uh imagine brother brandon said thousands but let's just run it up to a million let's say it's a million bride members imagine a million people escaping the worldwide tribulation period and ultimately death imagine god saving a million people from death and they never have to have a funeral imagine that what a testimony this is going to be so if you're in the rapture or if you if you're in the bride you have the reward of the rapture and then during the tribulation while the world is getting judged you get to sit at a table and have communion with the lord amen oh my that's a great reward the rapture and then the marriage supper the lamb following that uh you get to experience armageddon you get to ride a horse uh in the sky and wear white robes and follow jesus to battle oh hallelujah that's a great reward to be in the army of the lord hallelujah that's why we got to reign the bible if we're going to reign there like the bible said we have to reign over sin here amen and then the bible says after that then you get the reward of living the thousand-year millennial reign because the rest of the dead do not live during this thousand-year period it's only for those who are in the bride those that were beheaded for jesus according to revelation 20 for the word of god which had not worshipped the beast that's where we are neither his image neither received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands amen praise god we might not have to be a martyrs for jesus right but one thing that we surely can do we can reject worshipping the beast we can reject rome and her pagan ways amen that's one thing we can do praise god amen hallelujah we may not we may we may have to suffer persecution in america we know brother and says thus saith the lord but the brahman said thus saith the lord the same persecution they had in ancient rome is coming to the usa so we know it's going to happen according to revelation 13 we don't know if we'll live to see it we don't know if the bride will be a part of it there could be a squeeze time we're not sure uh there's a lot of different quotes and thoughts on that we looked we looked at it a few weeks ago where the bible said we're saved from the wrath of god right so that's what we're resting on that's what we're hoping for praise god but we know christian persecution is happening around the world christians will always be persecuted right if they hated jesus the master they're going to hate the disciples amen right so we got to be willing to give our lives if god should call us to that but the bible said they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years but the rest of the dead lived now again until the thousand years we're finished this is the first resurrection blessed is holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years amen all right what a promise priests of god and of christ you are a priest you're an intercessor right you're a spiritual leader of god and christ that's what the true bride of jesus christ is and then she reigns with him a thousand years hallelujah now also she sits next to him on his thrones judging the nations for a thousand years this is another great reward right here on earth we may suffer rejection mockery perhaps even physical persecution but we must endure the bible says in second timothy 2 11 and 12 it's a faithful saying if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he will deny us so god help us not to deny christ but may god help us to suffer with him that will reign with him oh yes what a promise two more heavenly rewards await we sit with him in judgment at the white throne just like the bible says uh speaks of the queen of the south and the men of nina i want to preach a message on this i want to preach a message on destiny uh there's there's certain you have a destiny right of either either either we are lost or we're saved we have a certain destiny but there are certain moments in our lives that are destiny moments we were destined to do certain things nobody else could do it but you like the queen of the south what was her destiny her destiny was to have the courage to cross the desert to see this wisdom of the of the gift of god and then god is going to use that that was her destiny moment right there god is going to use that decision on the day of judgment it was her destiny she was born far from jerusalem so she could travel to jerusalem amen that was part of her destiny there's going to be moments in our lives where we were born to do something out she was called to to cross the desert some of us are live across states right we talked about that right the men of nineveh they repented at the preaching of jonah right and he said a greater than jonah's here some of us are our destiny is to repent so sincerely right or to get the baptism of the holy ghost in such a powerful way to have such a testimony that god will use our repentance he'll use our baptism of the holy ghost experience he'll use our testimony on the day of judgment against those who would not repent against those who would not be sanctified against those who would not be born again oh may we be fully surrendered to god amen see there's some great thing in your life some great uh moment of destiny where you are to obey the word of god and do something outstanding for the lord and i imagine part of you you won't even realize you're doing it right like that queen of sheba she just sat there like brother dramatizes it he's like i've just got to keep hearing all these things i just got to go here our gods are dead our idols they don't talk and everybody says this man can tell you the secrets of your heart i've just got to cry i just got to do it i want to see if it's real oh my you know we got to look at our lives when we're really hungry to know if god's real that's part of our destiny praise god we got to follow that hunger and thirst in other words we have to keep seeking god until we're satisfied amen that's what she did she kept seeking god she did everything in her physical power to find out is god real and then when god revealed it god called her to her destiny she fulfilled it and then god is going to use that testimony on the day of judgment oh and shall be ever shall be forever known as the woman who made a great sacrifice just to hear the wisdom of god oh some of our testimonies are going to be that we just wanted to hear the word of god we did everything in our power we repented in tears and snot praise god we repented at the altar we danced or we shot it we spoke in tongues when other people wouldn't praise god we believe for miracles when other people wouldn't we've got to find our destiny before god god is calling us to something in here praise god he's calling you to a destiny that's one of your great rewards if you uh if you come to that destiny moment and you fulfill god's word then you will sit with him in his throne on the day of judgment praise god you already have gone to the judgment for rewards as paul said but then at the white throne judgment you will sit there and he will use your testimony look at that a woman judge the queen of the south will judge and condemn that generation imagine if caiaphas will be standing there right and she'll judge caiaphas the bible said she'll judge that generation all that generation shall judge those pharisees that wouldn't go out to john and be baptized right because she crossed the desert just to hear solomon they wouldn't even go out to the desert to be baptized a woman will judge those unbelieving men those cowardly men that godly woman will have a testimony against those ungodly men oh sisters live holy today praise god you brothers live holy your testimony will speak on that day you've got a destiny you've got to fulfill think about that their whole destiny was to hear jonah and then lay in ashes how many days did they do that was it three days 40 oh my goodness that's right 40 days i got some of my stories i got mixed up with esther three days of fasting but that's part of their destiny that was part of their destiny to lay in ashes and humble themselves and seek god for 40 days to not work and just set aside some time to seek god oh let's be sensitive to the holy spirit and see what god is calling us to do if you meet your destiny the bible said to him that overcometh what i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne amen we gotta find what we gotta overcome we've gotta find the challenge god's called us to overcome the queen of the south overcame all the unbelief and the desert amen we've gotta overcome in our way right what was and here's another part of the sermon zerubbabel was called uh to leave babylon and come back and build the temple what was his mountain remember the bible says zerubbabel will speak to the mountain let's read it let's go to uh zechariah 4. zechariah 4. i don't know the verse but i'll be able to find it real quickly when i'm there think about your destiny i guess i didn't i didn't want to preach this too much tonight but i want to kind of save it for again for another night but maybe sunday zechariah 4. look at six we're familiar with this then he answered and speaking of me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubo is saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit said the lord of hosts remember he saw the vision he saw the two trees feeding the two candlesticks these are the two anointed ones their oil is pouring into the candlesticks the oil is the holy spirit it's not by might not by power but by the spirit but remember they started building the temple they built the altar the temple but they didn't finish the temple they got stopped for 16 years for 16 years they couldn't build the temple because the leadership changed right cyrus went on and there was for the queen of the south her destiny your obstacle was that desert she had to overcome that desert amen those men in nineveh they had to overcome uh their pride they'd overcome their pride and repent and dust and ashes for 40 days that was their destiny and god's gonna use that destiny the fact that they overcame and they met the challenge of that hour god is going to use him on the day of judgment well what's the room of his destiny who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel will thou shalt become a plain he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shouting's crying grace grace unto it leave that up there would you what was the roomable's destiny his whole destiny in life was to finish building the temple of god his whole destiny was to be able to climb up there or see the men on the scaffold right and lay that headstone how great it was i wonder how many men had to lay that headstone that that's what his whole life was meant to do was to build one tabernacle that was his destiny but it was a mountain 16-year mountain and before that he had to cross the desert too so he had this huge mountain all these obstacles right and then 16 years of discouragement this church is not we're almost 15 years old i mean that gives us a good idea of how long that's been right this was his whole destiny in life he had to overcome this mountain of government oppression that's what it was the government was keeping him from building the temple of god now how is he going to open by speaking to the mountain right he was going to speak to the mountain and the bible said when the headstone got put down there would be shoutings unto the headstone grace grace and that means favor favor in other words god is going to help you overcome by the holy spirit god is going to give you favor to move this mountain amen that was his destiny his destiny was to overcome the mountain of government oppression in order to finish the tabernacle oh i hope god is helping us to see our destiny tonight praise god we might have uh something we have something to do for god and it's going to be done by the holy spirit and we've got to be aware that god's favor is going to help us do it because god favors us because god is on our side because god is with us because he's chosen us he's helped us god's favor is going to move the mountain amen and then you are going to be an overcomer hallelujah then he's going to use your overcoming testimony on the day of judgment it's so simple what's your goal in life's removal to finish the house of god now what's mine it might be uh to keep the church of god going right to build a church in akron or or raise up a church in akron whether we get a building or not we're still building a spiritual house praise god to overcome any mountain of obstacles but we're going to overcome them by the word of god we're going to overcome them by god's grace coming into the camp by the holy spirit strengthening us amen by god showing us his favor by god never leaving us nor forsaking us we've got to make sure we don't leave and forsake him right so that's about half my sermon there so but i wonder how many people watch wednesday nights so naomi might have to sit through it again my children might have to sit through it again i want to preach on that same thought about your destiny that's god is going to use that in the day of judgment zeroable he crossed the desert he battled for 16 years finally the mountain moved that was his testimony david remember what was samson destroy the philistines did he meet his destiny yes did he have a lot of failures yeah but did he fulfills his destiny yes he destroyed more philistines at his death than he did in his life he helped get them out of the slavery right of the oppression of the philistines that was his destiny and church if you really love god god will help you fulfill your destiny because there's nobody else that can do it except you praise god you're the only one that can do it and then remember god says your testimony will judge unbelievers and fallen angels know you not that the saints will judge the angels think about what is your life to overcome what are you to overcome and lastly the last reward is in the new jerusalem the bible says ever with the lord you're fed by him and you serve his desires revelation 22 3 and 4 says and there shall be no more curse but the throne of god unto the lamb shall be in it and his servant shall serve him and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their heads oh hallelujah like the jews the bible says they get the holy ghost and it's in their forehead it's just symbolic of your mind is fully sealed to the kingdom of god right it's just a seal because all the judgments are made in the frontal cortex right the front part of your brain that's where all the judgments are made so god just symbolizes it he's marking you there in other words you always do that which the father shows you amen now let's look at the consequences briefly here i got about well that's really fast i got about six minutes for my 30 minutes the consequence the first consequence is if you reject this revelation many people go to the lie of universalism right oh we're all god's children god loves us all the same we're all going to heaven but that's not true god's love is impartial right but his love must be received as a gift right when a church willingly disobeys any part of god's word they forfeit either part or all of god's blessings the maokai get your bible go to john 14 malachi we're going to read how obedience symbolizes love well what's the opposite if obedience means love then disobedience means hatred right obedience equals love for god then disobedience equals hatred for god these people won't obey god they hate god they hate the word right they they're like the pharisees they have a form of godliness but they deny the power thereof so maokai john 14 15 read that please read 21 please verse 21 same chapter hallelujah the ones that love jesus are the ones that keep his commands and the father loves them read verses 23 and 24 four times in this one chapter jesus says if you love me you'll keep my commands so true love submits and obeys the word of god go ahead my father will love him look at that jesus even says my doctrine is not mine i got it from the father wow what a what a great understanding of his entity here so again four times before the number of deliverance right or brother man calls it double confirmation you got two and two two two's a confirmation and two is a confirmation that's a double confirmation you got four look at that so see love obeys hatred disobeys no matter what the outside says now doubters of this revelation a second consequence they live in chaos right uh go to second timothy three verse one and two second timothy three verses one and two and again it's connected to love the true bride of christ loves her husband jesus the word so she's she obeys the false brides hate the word of god they love themselves more than they love the word okay verses one and two second timothy three verses one and two this know also then the last days perilous times shall come for men should be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful and unholy can you keep that up there ii timothy 3 1-2 perilous means trouble sometimes so the most troubling times are coming at the end and what's going to happen they're going to love themselves right more than god that means if they love themselves they're not going to love christ the word they're not going to obey the word so they're going to disobey their parents as well so they're going to blast him the holy spirit call the work of god they're going to call it the work of satan yeah go to church right call themselves the bride call themselves the true church that's what they do see so husbands will love themselves more than their wives and children teenagers and children will violently rebel against the ones who nurtured them and gave them life see because they love themselves more than they love the word of god instead of treasure in their homes the bible says they'll have trouble right instead of treasure they have trouble now those who reject part of the revelation but receive some of it their highest goal can be foolish version that's as high as they can go but they squander their time so acacia ephesians 5 15-17 i preached this numerous times so is cam when he came ephesians 5 15 to 17. so the way to see foolish version is they don't invest their time wisely see then that you walk circumspectly that means remember precisely exactly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil therefore be unwise by understanding what the will the lord is the foolish virgins really don't know god's will right they oh they reject the word they don't know they don't love the word they don't obey the word uh they don't uh oh they don't understand god's exact will and they don't use their time wisely remember the bible said they should have prepared oil remember that the foolish virgin they didn't use their time wisely they should have prepared oil so they would have been ready to last longer that's right they're not quite sure of god's will and they don't get conformed to the full image of the word like the bride they conform more to the world standards remember that third remember the third the third ground the cares of the world choked out the word right the cares of the world see they care more about the world they spent more time in the things of the world than the things of god amen and those the most awful consequence is to reject and blaspheme this revelation many of these people become part of the false church the mother harlot or will just not be a part of any church but god gives a gracious warning he said come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not her plagues i'm so glad i heard that voice amen come out of denomination come out of the assemblies of god although there's some good people in there right but come out of that denominational system that has so many false doctrines come out of that my people that you be not a partaker of her sins and her plagues amen now jesus is looking for a bride that submits to every word and will accept her responsive and her ministries she'll accept her destiny we have to let jesus wash away all of our sins right through the water of his word and jesus offers this bride membership to every individual he said if any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink so it all boils down to thirst we have to have a greater thirst for jesus than anything else we thirst for right like if we watch if we watch our lives if we look at our lives long enough throughout like go go on vacation day look at your vacation day when you have all your free time what are you thirsting to do that will tell you what you're thirsting for right we have to thirst more for god than for anything else we must thirst for the things of god right don't let don't quench your thirst with something unholy quench your thirst with something holy praise god see anybody can be part of the bride all they got to do is read the bible and just live everything straight out of the bible that's all they got to do this is god's instruction book for the bride those who obey all of it are the true bride that's quite an echo there anyways the true example of the bride is found back in genesis 2. adam said this is now bone in my bones and flesh of my flesh what was the true proof that eve was one with adam she was a part of him amen she was she came out from him that's the same thing today right the true bride brother bam says is word of his word life of his life spirit of his spirit praise god amen that shows we came out of jesus's heart right we came out of the mind of god so we must speak the word we must have the life of the holy spirit and we must uh manifest the holy spirit in every area of our lives now at the end of this chapter i got three actions action steps to becoming a bride remember you got to repent for disobeying any bible command and seek the baptism of the holy ghost if you surrender fully he'll come in fully second in kindness and respect you to separate yourself from both foolish and false churches remember the bible said come out from the bible said the deep calls unto the deep amen if you have a deep call for more of god there has to be a deep to respond right so a true bride member cannot sit in a false church very long because there's something calling out for more of god there's only something there's only one thing that will satisfy them that's the real holy spirit not just a temporary anointing but a permanent anointing amen and third your growing grace through your continual sanctification you not only begin holiness you perfect holiness the bible says in second corinthians 7 1 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god all right now in closing what was the confusion the confusion about this mystery is who is the true church right if we go back to the beginning of this series 13 sermons ago who is the true church revelation is the true church submit to all of jesus's commands now with the promises of being raptured and ruling and reigning with her husband in the millennium that's the true church praise god we saw her evidence so i'm just going to quickly go back over this we saw god search for a bride in israel but she rejected so he went to the gentiles he went to the world and then we saw the blueprint for becoming a bride member is the three works of grace like paul taught praise god and then we saw anyone changing the gospel blueprint was cursed anyone changing the way you become a bride member is cursed either now there'll be certain curses now but certain curses later and there's five attributes to the bride's character right christ is her head first complete submission to everything she goes through christ's washing process number four she's joined or glued to christ and his body the church and then she has the attitude of reverence the bible said amen remember church we judge the groups by their fruits catholics 1.3 billion protestants 900 million eastern orthodox 270 million anglican 110 million oriental orthodox 62 million here's some others the evangelical alliance has 600 million i wonder what group that is it's a bunch of evangelicals kind of like a billy graham group anglicans we said uh 110 million here's some other ones the reformed churches have a hundred million the anglo i'm sorry the lutherans 75 million now here's mine that i grew up in the assemblies of god pentecostals have 68 million around the world 68 million the baptist world alliance 48 million the methodist council 80 million church of england 26 million uh the church of christ in congo 25 and a half million okay there's a bunch of other ones here not going to go through all those oh southern baptist convention has 14.5 million they meet in uh america every year wow i've heard about them all right so these huge numbers they have all these massive numbers but do they live by every word no they don't live by everywhere right let me go over this real quick how many remember the uh the 11 attributes of the mystery babylon she's a church that's them second she's a modern day babylon confusion they say salvation for a catholic is one of the most hardest processes to understand mentally it's so hard to know if you're saved because it's so much confusion babylon third she's a harlot like jezebel right which was sexual immorality with their abusing uh children death and idolatry wars of inquisition and the veneration of statues and images four she sits on many waters right around the world fifth she sits on seven mountains or hills the seven ancient hills of rome six she's a to christ she's a so she makes love with all the merchants of the world seventh she wears scarlet and purple eighth she's very wealthy ninth she's drunken with the blood of the saints so she openly murders people right tenth her headquarters is a great city the vatican and 11th she rides the beast or the spirit of rome that same world dominating spirit of rome aren't you glad we don't fit any of those descriptions other than we're a woman we're a church but we don't meet any of the other ones right the we say the movement of the message or the the followers of william branham's uh true teachings we don't meet any of those qualifications other than uh spiritually we're a woman praise god amen thank god for that i think the last time i saw uh they estimated the number of message people i think was about 1 million around the world 1 million look at all these groups they got 120 million 200 million 85 million we're this little small remnant and now think about how many are born again in that amount oh wow i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them amen very small group but i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them praise god remember i gave you 15 doctrines and almost every denomination was guilty of breaking those remember that god had water baptism homosexuality adultery all these uh wearing separate garments uh the three works of grace the true baptism holy ghost my i'll give you 15 and brother and i said there's hundreds of them in marriage and divorce he said there's hundreds of these things we could name of all the false doctrines that they have all right they went through all the women of the types there right and they ended with uh all those godly women proverbs 31 women let's stand to our feet praise god i'll stop right there where is this true church who is the true church it's the true wife of jesus christ who submits to every word of god it's the church that really loves the lord and keeps his commands praise god musicians you can come hallelujah we're grateful tonight to be a part of the true bride of jesus christ what a revelation what a revelation once you start going through what the bible says about the true bride of jesus christ jesus said i've got a bride john the baptist said jesus has a bride all these scriptures say he's got a bride and she makes herself ready by those five processes christ is
