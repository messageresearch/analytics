I think I've heard today by God's grace so forgive me if somebody gave me other news but that's the best news I think I've heard brother praise God let's take our Bibles here tonight what a blessing praise God let's go to Revelation 1 again verse 20. I'd like to continue this series on uh the mystery of the seven Church ages praise God like to continue on this I got just a couple slides I'm not going to show those till later but I'd like to continue on this chapter here kind of preach my way through this and it's so refreshing you know I as I told you before you know we get in we get in other topics and I kind of forget about other topics right we're human and uh just so refreshing as I was reading through this today studying on this and just assured that God has visited this generation praise God and given us the original word they had at the beginning by God's grace just so so wonderful just listening to history and you know the early Christians and everything we may not get to it tonight but just some beautiful lessons and wonderful stories God is faithful praise God hallelujah so let's read Revelation 1 verse 20. why don't we read that together we can on three ready one two three The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou saws are the seven churches let's have one more word of prayer if we can your heavenly father we thank you again for not tonight Lord think of this great uh decision for brother amen Lord we sure appreciate that Lord thank you for the favor Lord on his life Lord that the boss says because it's Amen because you're who you are I'll give you this request Lord thank you Lord that would be so so wonderful Lord God so we just pray God you guide him by the Holy Spirit Lord whether whichever way it goes we thank you Lord and we can see our brother here tonight father we ask God that the Holy Spirit would meet every need Lord we went through those long prayer requests and we're so grateful that we have a God who is who's long in Mercy who's long and Grace whose infinite in power he his power is so long his power is so great so father we pray you minister to each and every need here tonight father and guide me through the word I need your help I'm insufficient I can do nothing Lord except thou have helped me Father God so I need your grace here tonight Lord I report for my service and Lord each person as well purports for their service anoint each and every one Lord we're following charity and Desiring the best gift so minister to us we pray in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God Hallelujah so I could look at part four here tonight of this little series here on the seven Church ages and Trust would be a blessing to you uh this week I think yesterday I put out the video about uh the question they had about um divorce but random said thus say to the Lord you know a man could divorce his wife if she cut her hair you know so I put that video out yesterday um try to explain it as best I could by the grace of God so if you'd like to listen to that one I got that one out I got a lot of good or some numerous good comments on it one one person disliked it but everybody else seemed to like it by God's grace so the point is that you know in that statement it looked like brother Brown was just rebuking the people and he was showing you know the severity of Dishonor it remember it's just as much of a dishonor if a man doesn't cut his hair as a woman cutting her hair the Bible says it's vile for man doesn't cut his hair and the Bible says it's a dishonor if a woman cuts her hair which means a repulse like you think of like the a moment you're disgusted right you look at some like rotten food or something you know you're just repulsable that's what it is when a woman cuts her hair that's what it is when a man grows his hair out that dishonors not just you know not just the person but then each each of the headships all the way up to God Almighty the invisible spirit so um I was looking this year you know all the things God has had me put on YouTube and I was just I was rejoicing like wow we've tackled some or by God's grace we've tackled some controversial subjects this year and a lot of people have been helped so I thought well praise God there's a time and season for everything and it started last of Thanksgiving with brother William remember brother when we were talking about ministers marriage requirements remember that at my house I don't know if you remember but we talked about that we were talking about I like to put a video out about this you remember that so I just we prayed about it and felt led to do it so I know it's helped many people well let's look at this here for about 40 minutes we'll try to preach 40 minutes if we can you know my wife my wife keeps reminding me that I I preached a little longer each time you know and she does that because I I kind of complain like my voice is sore you know so it wouldn't be sore if I didn't preach as long so so God is good and I got my timer here hopefully that'll work out tonight by God's grace uh you know we've gone through the part three parts here and right now we're in the section of how the messengers are identified and their names so in the next section uh brother Bama actually teaches us in the church age book there are three requirements every preacher has to meet now that's on top of I think there's like 18 the book of First Timothy you know they have to be uh hospitable the Bible said husband of one wife you know all those and then brother Ram says there's three general ones uh also that you can see through Paul's Ministry they are teaching the true word of God powerful manifestations of the written and spoken word and third Soul winning those are three evidences again are requirements that a preacher has to have now in this case he's talking about the church age Messengers and boy I can't wait to preach some of them because they have some really powerful testimonies just some amazing you know defying the laws of nature uh you know uh being uh being martyred you know burned at the stake freely giving up their lives just amazing testimonies that they have these Church age Messengers you know winning almost a whole cotton or not a whole continent but a whole country to Christ almost a whole country one to Christ I'm just amazing testimonies about the power of Jesus Christ in these messages no wonder he called them Stars because they shine so bright with the power of Jesus Christ just like brother random praise God hallelujah amen now in Paul's life let's look at these three in Paul's life he was true to the word so much so he was so true to God's word that he went and rebuked Peter face to face when Peter separated himself from the the Gentiles a man that had seen Jesus face to face Paul said I haven't seen him face to face but I met him by the Holy Spirit praise God so again showed the power that he had with the word of God he was true to the word no matter who he had to rebuke and and I think we're a good example of that our little church praise God Amen we can take on debates or we can take on anybody whatever and the word of God will stand that's why we're not afraid because God's word will never fail praise God hallelujah Paul said anyone who altered the gospel was cursed and then he charged Timothy to invest all his time look at think about this invest all your time rightly dividing the word of Truth okay so let's read that I like to read that if you pull it up there um that was uh second Timothy 2 15. if I'm not mistaken second Timothy 2 15. give all your time think about that he's telling a pastor to give everything you've got to rightly dividing the word of truth that must mean if he's going to give his whole time to it that must be there's there's a lot of partial truths out there and the man of God has got to go find the real truth in it praise God he says studies to show thyself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth it is absolute work to find the rightly divided word of Truth praise God hallelujah but God has ministers who will strive to do that by the grace of God now uh Paul told Timothy give yourself holy to that in first Timothy 4 we're not going to go there but notice Paul said any spiritual person would recognize that God's word came out of him and should thus be obeyed sure now think about all these people that say oh Paul's a woman hater or Paul's legalistic I've had church friends tell me that that Paul was legalistic and how could that be but Paul says anyone who's spiritual will know that the word of God came out of him praise God now what's amazing to me brother William is that at the end of his life he could say all those churches in Asia had rejected me so how spiritual were they they weren't very spiritual they could receive it at first but then by the time Paul was going off the scene around 67 A.D they just rejected him he was in prison he looked like he was he lost his ministry brother Adam says demon said forsaken him all these people he just looked like he was fading away my brother brother Adam said he wasn't baiting away he was actually in the perfect will of God Amen he was doing what God had called him to do he was a witness in the prisons amen he was writing the Bible in prison amen hallelujah amen God had to hide him away in a prison cell amen so you and I could have this wonderful uh Bible here with the truth of God that are Eternal and can never change amen so God had to hide him away in a prison God hide me away Hallelujah so I can know you better praise God hide me away a little a hole in the wall Church in Akron so I can know you better because it's not about money it's not about popularity it's about Christ it's about purity it's about Holiness praise God amen he said what came the word of God out from you or came it unto you only if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord what a statement praise God so all true preachers will be as true as possible to the original word of God that Paul had amen now the second one here is uh Power of the written and spoken word Paul was powerful with the spoken word he cast out Devils remember he spoke to the the girl who had the the Divination Spirit he just said Satan come out of her right he'd come out of her at the right time he loudly instructed that impotent man to rise up and walk for the first time and he never even walked before that's power of the spoken word praise God and he raised up euticus from the dead after he fell out of the Second Story uh service right and late raised him up in the name of Jesus amen that's powerful but his written word was just as powerful look look what he's doing today we've never even met him but yet the word of God has completely transformed Our Lives amen oh my just as powerful praise God the written and spoken word of God Hallelujah and remember Brothers said which were his greatest Services was it South Africa where they had van loads of crutches or was it the revelation of the Seven Seals I think you know the answer praise God it was the revelation of the Seven Seals he said I've never worked in spheres as high as I've worked in these areas so see we have to have both we need the spoken word of power and we need the spoken written word we need the revelation of God Jesus gives us both both Spirit and the word praise God spirit and truth hallelujah amen hallelujah Paul's words were so powerful it caused the Corinthians to repent in Godly sorrow from his written rebukes and that's recorded in second Corinthians chapter 7. he was thankful that his written words were such a rebuke to them that they found repentance at the altar that's the power of the Holy Ghost man of God his written spoken word now thirdly we cannot calculate how many Souls Paul led to Christ but no doubt there's great fruit to his ministry he said I am nothing behind the very chiefest Apostle an apostle is one cent so out of all the Believers that all the apostles that were sent out Paul said I was he said nothing behind the chiefest of them so if he wasn't behind him he was at least equal to him right but then he gives us another clue he says I labored more abundantly than them all praise God and he said NADA but the grace of God that worketh in me may we let God's grace labor in our lives amen that's all that's all it is yielding the to the grace of God and then Grace will give you Grace will give you the strength to do what God's called you to do absolutely you know we had some more just you know on the on the thought of Grace we had some more student behaviors in our class this week that were crazy right like I've been slapped I've been spit on all these things we had some more crazy ones this week but the teachers out there telling me wow Mr Smith wow you're how do you keep control all these things I looked at him I said it ain't me it's the grace of God that's in me and they say oh you're such a great teacher I said no it's the grace of God that's in me see once again Grace because we know we're human we know we fall short all the time and we know we have these feelings these human feelings that come up but what takes over every time before something sinful comes out it's God's grace that comes out amen god holds us God keeping us praise God hallelujah I like what brother has said it wasn't me holding on to God it was God holding on to me praise God well that's just another note on Grace you know people can see it in your life church people on your job you're you're your boss out brother amen that's why you got favor with your boss amen it's God's grace amen hallelujah thank you Jesus and member church he labored in three grueling missionary trips and on those trips at least five times he was Shipwrecked stoned a number of times in the in the in the in the in the in the night in the water for one night he hung on to a piece of wood in in the water for a whole night I would have probably just let go and drown that's what I probably would have done but not this man Paul what a man of God hallelujah he just sat there in the cold water all night till he got picked up praise God because he knew God wasn't done with him yet praise God he labored so hard during three grueling missionary trips and he told those Corinthian Believers you are the Seal of my apostleship in the Lord praise God so in other words if you're called to be an apostle you need a Vindication the Vindication is the souls that God gives you Hallelujah and then he also said he said uh the the the the Philippian Believers and the Thessalonian Believers he said you are my joy and my crown Hallelujah is that how you see the Believers here are the Believers hear your joy praise God Hallelujah the Saints here ought to be your joy praise God Hallelujah now if you win a soul then that person's your joy praise God hallelujah thank God and that's exactly what Paul said he said he said you're my joy you're my crown see that's where that's where everybody gets that idea you win a soul it's like a jewel in your crown that's where that comes from because Paul said you are my crown the souls I've won you're the crown uh uh that God that Christ is going to place on my head and then Jesus and then Paul said I have such Godly jealousy over them he wants them to be chaste virgins of Christ in other words don't let any Idols in don't flirt with sin they said right don't flirt with anything praise God say totally true totally Chase holy Pious totally holy don't let anything take the place of your love for Jesus praise God such a Godly jealousies I'm jealous over the church I'm jealous over my converse that's how much he cares about them and loves them I don't think Paul said well let's let him go if they want to go you know I imagine Paul Zeal over them and would go and and plea with them and ask him to repent and come back praise God and so much so he said I make mention of you in all my prayers all my prayers I'm still trying to attain to that praise God hallelujah usually I just pray for me in my prayers you know the battles I'm going through and then the prayer requests we get in but that's where we want to go we want to get to where we're constantly praying for one another praise God constantly making mention of each one in prayer praise God that's where we we we're going by the grace of God so Soul winning mattered more to Paul than money and every worldly Temptation he was all about winning Souls gave himself to three grueling missionary trips praise God now I want to switch over here just to show you something here um you're familiar with these but I just want to give you a few visuals here by God's grace so uh So based upon those requirements right baseball and those requirements brother Brandon gave us these Messengers okay as church history demonstrates Jesus seven star Messengers the e-church age who meet these three messenger requirements were Paul iranius Columbo yeah Columbus Luther Wesley and brother Branham of course now the one thing that I made a video about this year was Columba according to this he didn't live even in his church age now to me that's okay because uh brother random said he he didn't get the dates from God he got the dates from historians okay and I made a video on about it and you should be surprised a lot of mastered people agree with me but a lot of them spoke bad about me I got like a 50 50 split on that one um that's because people just I don't they just don't study the scriptures I guess or they just don't study quotes like this he said tomorrow tomorrow night we're starting on the second Church age tonight we're starting on the first age I'm sure the Lord has a blessing in store for us remember as I said before sometimes on things these things we might disagree upon them as far as the theology is concerned and most of my dates I got from God no most of my dates I take from the authentic historians which really not interested in any side they just wrote down the facts whatever it was what the churches did and I of course the Divine part of the interpretation I try to place upon there myself the best I know how and the church said it's amazing you know people will argue uh tooth and nail that every word was thus said the Lord and we have we have statements like this he says I didn't get it I didn't I I got the dates from somebody else praise God right I got the dates from authentic historians but I love how program was so honest I love how he was he was so humble praise God and how can they have accused him of plagiarism was he when he said I took it from them praise God they got an evil spirit praise God these people have an evil spirit because they I don't know they just got the what I told what I told them is they just don't want to obey the word of God praise God they want to have Dracula parties they want to have Halloween parties they want to listen to rock and roll they want to watch evil Wicked movies they love sin but they should love God more than anything else praise God Amen now I've got all my that's my statement on that now um so again now if you notice church here uh notice colomba uh he now from what I believe I think I put in the book uh I believe the church age I believe the fire to your church age actually started earlier so colomba could live inside of it because there's a quote brother Adam said that Columba came in the fire to your church age so see brother Ram he was just doing his best he must have just you know didn't check the dates really of when when uh Columbo was born and he didn't have Google like you got Google praise God I can type in when did Columbus live and I'm going to answer in 0.8 seconds right didn't have that luxury okay and he said Columbo lived in thyartira well according to the dates he didn't so that that means he probably didn't check those dates right let's give him the benefit of the doubt he's human he's a man but he said I take him from the historians Hallelujah okay so I'm gonna leave that up there just for a moment here now how do we determine the dates how did Brother Ram determine the dates and the lengths of the church ages how did he do it uh well first of all they're approximate they're not exact dates right they're just approximate dates just like a season right uh don't forget the time changes this this Saturday night okay don't forget we fall back one hour praise God so just enjoy that by guys but but now I'm thinking of that because we're in Seasons when did fall actually start was it September or October when September yeah September now it wasn't on that specific day that all the leaves started falling the leaves were falling back in August because I was I was sad when they started falling I remember when they started well I'm like I don't want to rake leaves again I don't want to chop them up so the the seasons blend into each other right and so the so do the church ages they and the Seven Seals right they kind of blend into each other especially the church ages uh but brother Ram did take a lot of these dates from Larkin which I'll show you in just a moment but then he actually moves he moved three of the dates himself just so you know he moved through the dates because he must have seen things happen in history that he just wanted to adjust them a little bit but again it's more of like Seasons right they go into uh one season they slowly fade into uh one another now but I think brother Ram uh use uh Jesus descriptions from Revelation chapter two and three and then he matched those descriptions with major events in church history like the easiest one is Azusa Street 1906 right we can see that's the beginning of a brand new age right gifts are restored uh the name of the Lord Jesus Christ came back right although they denominated within uh 20 years they denominated that a Jesus only group but I mean all these great Revelations are coming back one God not three persons one God one person was coming back and so that's an obvious moment where wow Revival praise God that was a Revival so it must be the beginning of a new age you can see it plainly praise God now actually I'm already I'm ready for the next one so here's so here let's compare Larkin Larkin's uh uh dates to brother branham's here just for a moment so see they agree on most of them and they just have slight differences between Ephesus Philadelphia laodicea the church notice most of the messengers Minister during the beginning of their Church ages okay now there are some quotes brother Adam says there at the end they come at the end of their ages and other quotes he says they come at the end of the previous age which that makes sense right after at the End of the Age comes the messenger to the next stage right okay but which that would that would make sense but there are quotes on both sides just so you know but if you look at the order of them the messenger comes at the end of the age or at the beginning of the age and I love that because God is sending that star to shine bright and then and then the age has time for other men to take that anointing and spread it to the uttermost parts of the earth amen ah it proves God is long-suffering praise God he sends the messenger at the beginning so other men can receive it and then and then they can get a reward they can get a crown because they can be Apostles amen hallelujah oh it's beautiful it's God's long-suffering is what I'm saying God sends the messenger at the beginning of the age or near the beginning so the rest of the age can hear what the spirit is saying to the churches amen hallelujah that's proof that God is a god of long-suffering and he's a god of Revival Hallelujah he's a god of Revelation amen oh hallelujah oh it's beautiful and notice these were all stars Paul was a star iranianism Martin Colombo was the star Luther Wesley brother Rand they were all stars shining the light of God and what is light the word made manifest brother random says hallelujah they manifested God's word praise God Paul manifested Jesus Christ brother random manifested Jesus Christ Martin Luther manifested the presence of Jesus Christ amen each and every one manifested the presence of Jesus Christ they were the light to their age Hallelujah that's why that you know there is a good thing about press and play at home that's a good thing to do at home or if you got a question in the service you can press play I I press play a little bit but don't press play where it takes away the fivefold ministry because now you've broken the word of God but when you press play you're listening to run the ram doesn't it raise your Faith Church oh Hallelujah doesn't just feel like God is so real praise God that God can do anything praise God that's exactly right now let's go through each of one of these here by God's grace now what's interesting is Larkin started his church age of course A.D 70 right so I think that's where I like it Larkin started after Titus invaded uh Jerusalem because it looked like the end of the Jewish age right it looked like the end of the Jewish age the temple Harris Temple was destroyed okay so that's where Larkin starts brother Randall starts it in 53 A.D now church that's because the three-year Revival in Ephesus started in 53 A.D and that's recorded in Acts chapter 20. right remember that because the Bible said he was there three years and he taught them the whole counsel of God within three years okay so the church age likely starts around 53 A.D okay and it started with a Revival in Ephesus praise God now what's interesting is that the Ephesian Church thought was founded in Paul's third missionary journey third missionary journey which is interesting and he also started the churches in Philippi thessalonica Berea Corinth among others and that's in Acts chapters 16 through 20. now the word Ephesus means permitted okay it was a permitted age now and then Larkin adds the words to relax it means to relax so that they mean the same if you permit something you're relaxing your standards you're allowing something so emphasis means permitted if you look at look it up in the Greek Lexicon and so that's exactly what Jesus said uh he said his main concern for the age is that they lost their Zeal and left their first love okay so it makes sense Ephesus was permitted they permitted things in their lives that they shouldn't have let in their lives praise God now God help us not to permit anything evil in our lives that's why that's why you're here tonight you're not going to let you're not going to let anything be permitted in your life that shouldn't be in your life praise God that's right even going to keep clean praise God by the grace of God Amen now I'm going to go quickly through this Smyrna began around 170 and ended about 312 so Smyrna sorry means myrrh and myrrh is costly perfume and embalming antiseptic okay so it's used in the dead and this aligns perfectly with Jesus prophecy that this time period will be the age of Martyrs because in Revelation 2 10 he said be thou faithful unto death and I will give Thee the Crown of Life so Smyrna matches perfectly myrrh death be faithful unto death now what's amazing church I found this in history brother Brandon didn't say this but I found this in history the uh this age began in 170 because Justin Martyr and six of his disciples were were the were some of the first Martyrs in ad170. right just in the Justin Martyr I wonder if that's where they get the name Justin Martin I haven't studied his life enough to know but this church ages begins with a persecution and seven Christians lose their lives and it also ends with a gruesome 10-year Christian persecution under Diocletian around 303. uh yeah 303 but then it goes to 312 A.D I'm sorry yeah it started 303 but ended 3 12. yeah so diocletians persecution end around 312. so it started with Martyrs and then it ends with this martyrs okay so see made there's major events in church history where these ages are aligned to right Larkin just wasn't guessing brother Ram just wasn't guessing they're reading history and see when did God move when did God start something new and how does that line up with Jesus seven seven letters and in each case it lines up wonderfully that and that proves history and Jesus's words prove that the revelation of the seven churches is exactly right amen the third age pergamos began around 312 and went to 606. it began with Emperor Constantine's Reign Over the Western Empire of Rome uh and later expanded to the entire Roman Empire empire around 320 480 right before the Nicene Council uh as Jesus foretold in Revelation 2 14 many in this age would succumb to an Unholy religious Union similar to the one of Balaam and balak the union of church and state how many know this age had the union of church and state Constantine and Rome right so we see that Jesus talked about that in this letter to the pergamian church age so false Christianity in Rome United with Constantine now notice what Constance he did he actually stopped Christian persecution and everybody thinks he's a good man because of that well he might have started good but he ended up an awful man right because so friends uh I have family members who are Christians um and they sent my children I don't remember this Lydia Malachi but they sent you guys books chapter books on church history that were kind of kids books I don't know if you remember this I took them to Goodwill just to let you know I didn't want him in my house because the first book was about Constantine how he was such a wonderful Christian and I knew the history and I knew he wasn't see so the denominational people uh the mark of the beast kind of churches that are linked to that they think Constantine was good because he didn't kill Christians but the RAM said actually Satan's more deceptive when he doesn't kill Christians he lets them live and he he he deceives them into Wicked sins right he deceives them into lacks living lazy living compromising on sin that's what brother says God of this evil age I believe if I'm not mistaken he said he's more deceptive when he lets him live and so either Constantine was a True Believer or he was he was used by the devil at the beginning he actually ended the persecution of Christians it's the first thing he did uh second thing he donated property to Christians Christians right and then he had many churches built or constructed with government money again to have the church and state United right just like Balaam and uh Barrack or balak yeah now church I don't know if you knew this but he still remained a murderer he had his oldest son and his wife killed towards the end of his life while he was away at a different city and they were in Rome he had them killed now Church what Christian could ever possibly even think of doing something like that and like his like denominations exalt this guy he's some great Christian and he murdered his own wife and his oldest son because he wanted to protect his crown he wanted to keep the crown anything to keep the crown there it is my goodness so likely his conversion was false or incomplete or it was like Judas Iscariot where he started off good but then he fell away but that's what this church age is all about uniting church and state but it started with uh Christians no longer being persecuted uh but it ends in 606 because something awful happened in 606. in 606 6 Pope Boniface III accepted the title of universal Bishop of the entire Christian Church in 606. so you have us you have said this a May or this not amazing but this awful church history moment where now the pope assumes I am the pope I'm Papa I'm father over the entire Christian church and it starts ushers in a new age the darkest age brother said it was the darkest age out of all of them that's right we are the most deceptive age but we're not the darkest age we've got a whole lot of light let's say thank God Amen church thank God that we have light in this age Hallelujah we have way more light than they had in the Dark Ages way more light but it's more deceptive now it was darker than because they did less Bibles and less truth and and uh the popes had Mighty control over the governments right literal control immediate control over the governments but here in this next age it starts with a pope saying I'm the universal Bishop and that was the beginning of the darkest time in all church history and also this was also the age that's about control of the wrong Church and took her to the depths of Satan think about that the very depths of Satan through fornication Jesus said idolatry and other doctrines of devils right I'm going to get to this history later where the popes of this time they had they just had harems of prostitutes right and there was there was uh the priest would say don't let my wife and daughters run the pope because the Pope's going to get my wife and daughters even the priests around the popes would say that that's how awful these guys were any anybody they could ravish anyone anyone they could rape they do it some of the most wicked wicked and this is called the depths of Satan by Jesus Christ and it matches perfectly I love it it matches perfectly with history amen because Jesus is not a liar Jesus is telling the truth he foretold all these events he knows the beginning from the end he's the author and finisher of all human history praise God that means your life is in his hands praise God Church you're right where God wants you to be if you're in obedience by the grace of God you're right where God wants you to be Hallelujah couldn't be an any better spot Hallelujah than servant Jesus Christ amen now this is the age I I personally and I wrote this in the book I personally believe thyroid Tierra started in 560 now that's just my opinion but let me tell you why I'm not trying to upsurp anything but brother said he just took the dates he did the best he could on the dates he took them from historians did you know in 560 A.D there was a Holy Ghost and Power movement in phrygia it was a five-year Revival and it resembled the day of Pentecost history says and I got this history from the same books brother got his history from this revival and freesia had all nine gifts of the Spirit and they were operated perfectly for five years imagine that it seems likely so it seems thyartira began just like laodicea with the Revival because uh when Azusa I'm sorry yeah when Azusa started those gifts were operating perfectly if you actually listen to their own testimonies those gifts started they started perfectly they would have tongues I know tongues and they have interpretation right and then there are prophecies they would have discernments of spirit everything was right at the beginning as far as what I've read if I'm wrong somebody help me out later by God's grace but that's what I've read it seemed to start right but then it got off brother answered the denominated within 20 years they started a denomination okay so that's why I believe uh thy artera probably started earlier and if it in church if it started in 560 look at that that allows uh the messenger to preach 36 years during the church age so that's just my humble thought we'll find out later in Heaven by God's grace but it's just a minor this ain't a major amen we're just talking about dates and it don't really matter but remember then again if it starts in 560 that allows Columbo to live in the age because brother Graham said he he lived in Colombia I'm sorry he lived in the artera okay that help by God's grace have you ever see that all right if I find out if you have any other opinion uh then brother Branham or something like that people don't like you but then brother Ram has all kinds of different opinions right and they change so you need uh you need to rightly divide the word of Truth praise God that's what we try to do by the grace of God now the Sardis Church age began now listen to this it began around 50 . but did you know this what you eat five Theses on the uh Wittenberg Church door three years earlier in 1517. did you know that like we always think uh uh Reformation started when Martin Luther nailed nailed those Theses so I went and searched it out why Larkin say that Larkin said it was 15 20 because in that year Luther actually put out three great documents that laid down the fundamental principles of the reformers and that started a wildfire it was like going viral today on YouTube or Twitter or something like that he wrote three documents and they spread like wildfire and it just took off so just the the pounding of the nail and the 95 thesis that didn't maybe impact people as much right away but once he got out those foundational documents people spread it around they were texting all over the place praise God they were sharing it all over they were just they were constantly getting copied praise God he was he was one of the most best authors of that time was Martin Luther people couldn't get enough of his truth why because he was a star for Jesus amen he was making his uh making his Revelation go viral praise God hallelujah definitely Church so that's interesting just keep that in mind just so you know 1517 was when he nailed the Theses three years later is when Larkin and brother Branham said that's when the church age started so I just say well praise the Lord I don't know Hallelujah God is good amen I believe it it just it's got to be one of those by God's grace now what's amazing or you might forget about this age the age was powerful but it ended with a lot of disappointment because Jesus said only a few names in Sardis have not defiled their garments so it reminds me a lot of episodes they start off good but then very few actually make it out of the age right and remember you said you have a name that you live but you're dead so that means after Luther and zwingly and all these uh reformers died then the people just they gave they got they got permitted right they they got they relax spiritually and that's what we can't do brother Ram's not on the scene so we still have to have strong faith in Jesus Christ we still have to pray and have expectation and trust God and go to God In Prayer amen and let the holy spirit guide Our Lives constantly praise God we've got to keep that fire alive amen I'm gonna say it again like our eyes do if any you ever see me get off the word come talk to me about it I'm gonna say especially brother amen because he's a man you know sisters might feel uncomfortable but amen if I ever get off the word you come tell me about it by God's grace right brother said even the janitor he said if I'm off the word he said you got a right to come to me privately and he said let's sit down in the scripture he said let's solve it out together amen imagine brother man with a janitor let's talk about the word brother what do you want to talk about you want to talk about serpent seed or godhead he was so humble praise God and that's why that's why church it's everybody's responsibility here to make sure this church moves on in the power of God you can't put it all on me I can't put it all on you we're all in this together praise God Amen we're a body Ministry praise God we cannot do uh uh uh Conquering the laity we can't do nicolaitas Somewhere Only The Preacher's anointed you're all anointed this year you've seen it you're all anointed praise God Hallelujah everybody's anointed and we must stay anointed by the grace of God Hallelujah yeah when Luther zwingley and John Calvin died everybody went down a few people actually kept the faith after that I remember Martin Luther wrote those famous words I don't know if you know his brother Ray he said I'll be he said I'll be amazed if 10 of my converts make it to Heaven Martin Luther said that I got the book where he said that unbelievable ten percent because that's what Jesus said if you there be a few of them will actually not defile their garments all right now uh Philadelphia the period of broadly love I started around 1750 it lasted to 1906. Jesus called this the open door age because George Whitefield John Wesley William Carey David Livingstone evangelized the world teaching Saints to keep Jesus word name and patience right so some of these like Whitefield did England and United States Wesley did England John Kerry I'm sorry William Carey uh he did India David Livingstone did Africa and members John Wesley would preach eight sermons a day I don't know how he controlled his voice with that he must have some Supernatural fire anointing or something like that I lose my voice if I preach hard one time a week you know I lose my voice what happened I think it might be the coffee actually I need to talk to my doctor about that yeah the doctor told one time do you know coffee makes your throat real bad I'm like oh I really like coffee so anyways I got I got room to grow by God's grace so these men did it but notice church now what did something I put in here I found in history 1750s when it started but the season was already changing in 1739 so 11 years earlier guess who came uh to America to preach Revival to start the Revival George Whitefield came to America and guess where he started his first Revival Church in America any guesses Philadelphia Pennsylvania see how that's amazing I found that I'm like unbelievable 11 years before the Philadelphia Church they started we got a sign that we're moving into the season of the open door amen God always does that there's always a glimpse hopefully don't well yeah we already had snow this year right that's kind of like that same thing we had snow a couple weeks ago right I'm driving home and there's snow I think it was on a Wednesday actually there's always a glimpse before the season starts there's always this reminder that season's going to change and so God did the same thing he said Whitefield and he preached Revival in Philadelphia 11 years before the church they started because seasons are changing praise God oh if that's true brother what about the Rapture amen hallelujah amen by God's grace may we have latter rain anointing praise God latter rain Services later rain Revival may we get some of those before the season of crossing over praise God Amen oh that's beautiful praise God help us to blend in that season well by the grace of God hallelujah oh thank you Jesus I'm almost down here by God's grace I don't want to go too too late I know I'm doing a lot of teaching on this but this really strengthens my faith as I read church history really strengthens my faith because I realize wow they if they did it if they could have testimonies to overcome what should I do how should I feel praise God you know church I found that when I read about the testimonies of other people or hear their testimonies I stopped feeling sorry for myself right I stopped I stopped making excuses when I started hearing other people's testimonies and the devil you know trying to discourage me I find that when I hear other people's testimonies it gives a fire within me like Lord I want to make my calling an election sure praise God they've already passed me on and the Bible said there's a cloud of witnesses praise God God's given us clouds of witnesses all these examples Hebrews 11 the whole Old Testament the book of Acts praise God and now we have church history all these Witnesses may God help us just look up and set our eyes on Jesus and press on towards the mark of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen oh you can find so much courage from these testimonies throughout the church age Hallelujah thank you Jesus now the final One Church H we're now laodicea in 1906 began with the Azusa Street Revival and the gifts were restored just like Joel 2 25 said I restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the canker room the caterpillar the Palm worm my great Army which I sent among you now church just so you know Martin Luther spoke in tongues Wesley had all kinds of Miracles people would pass out he prayed for his horse with a broken bone it was instantly healed I mean people would scream and shout and and uh they'd be slain the spirit under John Wesley he had amazing testimonies remember brother tells that testimony he went to a sick friend and his friend was on his deathbed and Wesley was so sad but he said he just took his Bible and he read all the scriptures about Divine Healing by his stripes you're healed I'm the Lord thy God who heals all that diseases brother said he left and then just hours later that man Rose completely up he was near death and he said Oz it takes sometimes is the word of God praise God the word is so powerful just read it just speak it and let God move amen let God do something praise God but I love he was discouraged but he said the only hope I have is to read the word of God and it brought forth healing praise God not instantly but within a few hours praise God Divine Healing amen oh man men like that praise God courageous men like that God restore so see we've got we had tongues and Gifts brother said Luther had all nine gifts of the Holy Spirit Wesley a little more and then Azusa Street here all these gifts on a greater group of people a larger number of people right the gifts were poured back out on them now sadly the Pentecostals all denominated and independents have grown lukewarm on Jesus word and spirit and they don't want no more Bible Revelation they've kicked Jesus out of their churches right yet Jesus the Bible says stands there knocking at the doors trying to enter in now if you we all say we want him to come in but if he comes in church he's going to rebuke us chasing us and ask us for Fellowship hallelujah praise God Amen everybody catch that praise God when you let Jesus in your life he's going to give some I'll say it like every day and when we invite more of Jesus in our lives we got to be ready for him to rebuke us and tell us where we're wrong then we've got to be ready for him to chasten us and then ask us for more Fellowship praise God and Church believe it you believe this in the busyness of life we can still always make time for Jesus in the busyness of this day brother said when Martin Luther got more busy he said I had to spend more time in praying he said because he had more responsibility to make sure the results were the right kind of results that he wanted he said well I have this meeting this meeting of this letter I got all these rebuttals I have to make he said I had to spend even more time in prayer when I got busy so so now we have a good lesson uh put a few more minutes on your prayer time right before if you're busy or praise God it makes your prayers the most important thing praise God Hallelujah that's what Mighty Men of God have learned down Through the Ages Hallelujah there's no power without prayer Hallelujah thank you Jesus all right now let's see I think I'll uh I think I better stop right there by the grace of God okay so musicians can come I think I'm gonna stop right there by God's grace so musicians can come praise the Lord how many love the Lord tonight amen that's usually my signal that okay we're done how we love the Lord let's stand to our feet by God's grace so George we've seen that now you can see exactly why brother Branham chose the dates and why did Larkin choose the dates that they chose because each of these ages had different signals and different revivals at different times and it signaled wow this is the beginning of a new day this beginning of a new age praise God and now we're coming down we're looking for the signals for the end of this age we're not looking for the beginning of a new age on Earth we're looking for a new Eternal age praise God and so by the way I don't know if you if you saw it but I preached on Russia on Sunday I don't know if you saw that okay did you okay good praise God I just want to make sure I knew that was something we could probably Fellowship about by God's grace because it's a great topic you know it really is a tremendous topic but that's why you know we preached on that on Sunday about Russia and things and we just want to be ready for us coming praise God and I believe God will help us you know after I preached out I went in my prayer closet I think it was Monday or Tuesday I'm just crying asking God lord you know my heart I don't want to miss it Lord if at all possible lord always make me ready for your coming I want to live to see it but if not somehow let me know praise God I'm so I'm still asking God for that praise God let me know I want to be ready I don't want to miss it I want your people to be ready for your coming praise God because if I thought the Lord was coming any day I'd be on my phone call on every single person I knew not just texting them I'd be calling them praise God I thought the Rapture was next week Church wouldn't you be in desperation if the Rapture was next week what about your lost loved ones what about your aunts and uncles and what about your brothers and sisters wouldn't you just be like knocking down their door just to talk to them if you really felt like it was or would you would you be building million dollar churches which one would you be doing that's that's that's that's that's one of those signs that it doesn't seem right if you believe the Rapture is tomorrow why would you be building a million dollar Church or 10 million dollar Church program said that the fruits don't line up with what your your confession is Hallelujah so praise the Lord amen let's bow our heads here for word of Prayer trust has been a blessing Church you got to see the requirements for every age messenger and also the dates and lengths of the church ages determine their praise God Hallelujah let me just make sure yeah next time Lord willing we'll get into the gaining and losing of Truth during the church ages you can see that plainly down through the scriptures then we'll get into the each and an individual age we'll go over them kind of uh briefly and hit some of the highlights by the grace of God hallelujah how many want to have fellowship with Jesus praise God this is the church age where he's knocking the Bible so he's knocking now that applies both ways he's not going to try to get into the false churches but also every day he's knocking he wants a greater part of our Lives praise God he wants more Fellowship praise God the Bible said our minds can be transformed renewed every single day he's knocking and he wants more Fellowship praise God let's pray for that that God will give us Grace to open the door receive any rebukes Hallelujah any chastening and enjoy fellowship with the Holy Spirit father God we thank you for tonight Lord God I thank you for your mercy and Grace Lord this is absolutely beautiful Lord for me to see I remember studying it a year ago Lord all summer I just study on this topic or read those history books it's amazing Lord because your word is true Hallelujah you are the same Jesus Christ
