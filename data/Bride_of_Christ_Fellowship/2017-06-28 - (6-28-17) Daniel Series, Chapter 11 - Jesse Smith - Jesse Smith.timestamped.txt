[32:46] [Applause]
[33:13] and we're only one chapter way from
[33:16] finishes by God's grace it's been a
[33:18] wonderful book you know I've always been
[33:19] a little nervous any book that's
[33:20] prophetic of course you knew and I know
[33:22] we just feel a little nervous about that
[33:24] but as we go back to grams quotes it
[33:26] makes everything clear so we're very
[33:28] thankful for that Daniel chapter 11
[33:30] Trust has been made clear to you what
[33:33] we've gone over so far if not for
[33:35] anybody to go back over and listen to it
[33:36] again tonight is the chapter I have the
[33:39] least amount of clothes on so how about
[33:43] there's a lot of history behind it so
[33:46] we'll just be looking at the scriptures
[33:48] that we have a lot of clothes for to see
[33:51] how the Prophet interpreted this so this
[33:54] is the awesome the longest chapter I
[33:55] believe in the whole book if I'm not
[33:57] mistaken I think effort to might be a
[33:58] little bit longer after looking up let's
[34:00] go to Daniel chapter 11
[34:03] that's just reverses one - by the grace
[34:08] of the Lord Daniel 11 one and two first
[34:22] one says also high in the first year of
[34:24] Darius the Mede even I stood to confirm
[34:28] and to strengthen him remember who's
[34:29] talking here that's not Daniel this is
[34:31] the angel of the Lord the angel of the
[34:34] Lord standing to come to strengthen
[34:36] even King Darius where look at that
[34:40] tonight by God's grace verse 2 and now
[34:43] will I show thee the truths we can speak
[34:46] into Daniel you hold there so stand up
[34:48] yet three kings and Persia and the four
[34:52] shall be far richer than they are and by
[34:54] his strength through his riches he shall
[34:58] stir up all against the realm of Grisha
[35:03] my god is messenger rimas word may be
[35:06] seen on compilation
[35:07] Malachi is a live stream on them I'm
[35:09] sorry your mommy sent me text I didn't
[35:11] see it till now she says the live stream
[35:14] so I was gonna send a quick text I don't
[35:21] encourage Texas during the service
[35:23] America I'm doing it just for the
[35:24] kingdom of god sake you know so somebody
[35:26] can get the message I went over that
[35:28] years ago you know with technology and
[35:31] the service you know if you can is
[35:32] because it puts the phone on if you can
[35:34] you know put it on airport mode or just
[35:37] shut it off if someone's in the hospital
[35:40] or you're expecting an important call or
[35:41] some like that put on vibrate if you
[35:43] can't by God's grace I know a few times
[35:45] I missed it and it's going off so
[35:47] forgive me I never would've grieve the
[35:49] Holy Spirit always asked God to forgive
[35:50] me if I've ever done a mistake so thank
[35:55] God for His mercy it was love let's look
[35:58] at I got a lot of quotes so Malik I
[36:00] didn't want to switch over here you can
[36:03] look at the coupe's Joy chapter LED and
[36:08] hope your hope you're under expectation
[36:10] praise the Lord Amen that's what I do
[36:12] every time I go to trust that God raised
[36:14] my expectation no more it's helped me to
[36:16] understand everything that I can
[36:18] understand for this day
[36:19] he's remember a lot of this chapter was
[36:21] for the Jews because remember a lot of
[36:24] this book is for the Jews it's to
[36:27] Daniel's people as we've read through it
[36:29] and longer thigh people the people of
[36:31] the holy Covenant you know the people of
[36:33] Israel the Holy Land a lot of this is to
[36:35] the Jews but we must know it by God's
[36:38] grace and as you'll see in chapter 12
[36:40] I'm sure you remember the angel said
[36:42] this book is going to be sealed up until
[36:44] the end time so now that the end time is
[36:47] here the book has been open to us
[36:49] because we have
[36:50] say the Lord on date night chapter 2 is
[36:53] the safety Lord program gave us the
[36:55] state the lorna on rome ruling at the
[36:56] end time interpreting daniel's
[36:59] interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream
[37:01] and so that lines up with daniel seventy
[37:04] weeks which brother had preached in 1961
[37:06] so it all lines up there by the grace of
[37:08] the lord everything else will be just
[37:10] falls into place but we've got the
[37:11] stated the Lord on the major theme role
[37:14] in the ruling at the end time so let's
[37:17] look at this tonight I trust you'll be
[37:18] blessed by the grace of the Lord Daniel
[37:20] chapter eleven now this chapter takes
[37:22] place in the same year as chapter 10
[37:24] because you remember the end of chapter
[37:25] 10 the angel he keeps talking to about I
[37:28] got more to tell you I've got to leave
[37:30] it a little bit but I got more to tell
[37:32] you
[37:33] so chapter 11 actually picks up where
[37:35] chapter 10 ended off at the same year
[37:37] Daniel's about 84 years old now verses 2
[37:41] to 35 according to the commentaries and
[37:44] things that I've read began to be
[37:47] fulfilled about six years later in 530
[37:49] BC and continued to be fulfilled until
[37:53] around 167 BC so these are some amazing
[37:57] prophecies all given in 536 BC Daniel
[38:00] wrote them down and they're going to be
[38:01] fulfilled for the next 400 years that's
[38:04] a real prophecy amen that's a real man
[38:06] of God was Daniel now verses 36 to 45 I
[38:10] couldn't find any quotes of brother
[38:12] Branham on any of those scriptures so
[38:15] I'll be just be using some of the other
[38:17] quotes that talk about that they talk
[38:20] about Israel rather they seem to be
[38:22] solely about the future Antichrist which
[38:24] we believe to be the Pope not everybody
[38:26] believes that but we believe it to be
[38:27] the Pope because the woman rides the
[38:29] beast the woman Rises spirit of wrong
[38:31] who leads the woman right and who else
[38:35] would prophesy who else who's the one
[38:36] man that could be a false prophet that
[38:39] could prophesy things the whole world
[38:41] the over will believe it and yet he's
[38:43] false or this doctor that's got to be
[38:44] the Pope
[38:45] gotta you know now verse one now I got
[38:55] my songbook up here so you need to
[38:57] switch
[39:04] all right now first one to Ange the Lord
[39:10] stood to confirm and strengthen him the
[39:13] hint was Darius the Mede
[39:15] and he was the heathen ruler remember
[39:18] but this is during the time of the Medes
[39:20] and Persians remember the statue you had
[39:22] Babylon the head Medes and Persians for
[39:25] the chest down to the belly okay and
[39:28] then the loins area was ancient Greeks
[39:30] and then the legs and feet were Rome
[39:32] right so this is spoken during the time
[39:35] of the Medes or the chest of silver now
[39:39] to me as I read this it's amazing to see
[39:41] how active God is in the realm of
[39:44] politics and world powers and these are
[39:47] the examples we're looking at just
[39:48] briefly tonight we already see that God
[39:50] is strengthening God is giving strength
[39:52] to a heathen king there is the me he
[39:57] also some years later gives strength and
[40:01] inspiration to Cyrus the Meade who was
[40:04] also an even King and then
[40:07] Nebuchadnezzar this was of course
[40:08] earlier God he was a strength of
[40:10] Nebuchadnezzar used him as a tool and
[40:12] then of course we know before this
[40:14] Pharaoh the Egyptian king was used by
[40:16] God as well so gods in charge God is
[40:19] orchestrating all these things around
[40:21] the world now does he ever do anything
[40:22] evil no God doesn't have them do
[40:25] anything evil that they don't want to do
[40:28] but as you'll see mother Branham said
[40:30] God has to have somebody to fulfill his
[40:32] word and because these people reject his
[40:34] word they fall in line and have to fill
[40:36] fulfill the other word the example
[40:38] brigade was Mike Mike hi member Mike hi
[40:40] he was the Prophet the days of a hat and
[40:43] Jehoshaphat remember that and brother
[40:46] Anderson God needed somebody to fulfill
[40:47] that word about any heaven Jezebel being
[40:50] eaten by dogs remember that so Mike aya
[40:53] said he said they have said the Prophet
[40:56] ISA cause he does I hate this guy all
[40:58] she does is prophesy evil against me and
[41:00] he says but Joseph as said is there any
[41:03] other prophet that we have these 400 all
[41:05] agree that we should hope the rain Mount
[41:07] Gilead and you said is there anybody
[41:09] else and and mayhap said yeah there's
[41:11] that Holy Roller micaiah but he always
[41:13] besides evil gets me but go rat but like
[41:17] I said I'll tell you the shade the Lord
[41:18] amen he said I saw and I saw in heaven I
[41:22] saw the High God I on his throne lifted
[41:24] up and an evil spirit came out and said
[41:26] who God said who would the sea they have
[41:29] for me to go through and my Juliet and a
[41:31] lying spirit came up so let's see that's
[41:33] a good example but right here's that
[41:35] example God has to have somebody from
[41:37] those word so he allows evil spirits to
[41:39] annoy people right to do that he one
[41:42] things of God not about you and I with
[41:43] our desire should be to be filled with
[41:45] the true Holy Spirit amen and not evil
[41:47] spirits not lighting spirits but the
[41:49] Spirit of Truth a man and we could put
[41:52] build them good promises of God out of
[41:54] you one of those against the holy spirit
[41:56] holiday all the days of my life to
[41:58] fulfill the good word of God not the
[42:01] judgments and not the Eagle bent we say
[42:03] the curstyn Word of God but the blessing
[42:06] Word of God now here let's let's this
[42:08] prove this know your Cyrus everyone said
[42:11] in the first year of Cyrus king of
[42:13] Persia now this was 445 BC so this is
[42:17] about 90 years after Darius now the word
[42:22] of the Lord by the mouth of jeremiah
[42:23] might be fulfilled the Lord stirred up
[42:26] the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia who
[42:28] stirred him up who got him motivated who
[42:30] got him inspired God got an even he
[42:33] inspired they know that he made a
[42:36] proclamation throughout all his kingdom
[42:38] and put it writing saying thus saith I
[42:40] wrote the king of Persia the Lord go to
[42:42] heaven have given me all the kingdoms of
[42:44] the earth
[42:44] and he had me to build in the house in
[42:47] Jerusalem can you imagine that of
[42:48] heathen king saying I'm led by God to
[42:50] build the house of God God God has to
[42:54] use anybody is to use somebody that
[42:56] fulfills work now then he said who there
[42:59] among you who wants to travel across the
[43:01] desert I think it was 500 miles who
[43:03] wants to get on a camel and he suffer
[43:05] and go through the hot sweat who wants
[43:07] to travel and get sanctify to go back
[43:09] over the desert to go back and build the
[43:11] house of God which is leg in shambles
[43:13] and Ezra was one of those guys through
[43:15] mogul Amen all those Zadok the priest
[43:17] and Joshua the high priest all these men
[43:20] were willing and remember the temple was
[43:22] in shambles but they're willing to go
[43:24] back
[43:25] wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow full of
[43:27] shambles and dirt and and move it away
[43:29] and then we know Nehemiah came to
[43:32] started building the wall after that see
[43:34] God wants people that are laborers
[43:37] even if everything looks like it's this
[43:38] ass even if after it looks like a
[43:40] spiritual disaster I need somebody to
[43:42] build it up baby
[43:43] at least have some witnesses an actor to
[43:46] establish the real true Word of God I
[43:48] would be one of those men won't build it
[43:51] from the ground up things in which we
[43:53] have he stopped me to join somebody
[43:56] else's church we started from the bottom
[43:58] of a net because there's no church an
[44:00] actor and we want to be like same a the
[44:02] Bible set our Dane elders in every city
[44:05] raised the lowest that's what we're here
[44:07] to do just like them
[44:08] but see God usually heathen King just
[44:10] like he was going to use Darius remember
[44:14] God said to Jeremiah do what I've said
[44:16] and take the families of the north this
[44:18] is the Jewish families save the Lord and
[44:20] Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my
[44:22] servant a heathen King right who
[44:26] believed in God an even king who go to
[44:28] Idol Daniel and I go worship her but yet
[44:31] God said he's my son why because
[44:34] everybody's a servant of God amen
[44:36] everybody has to fall in the plan of God
[44:38] amen he will force them to do it but
[44:41] because of their their spirit guy can
[44:43] work with him like we said with a hat
[44:45] God like to send a lying spirit in that
[44:48] because they don't want the truth so God
[44:49] has to give him over to a lie
[44:51] now remember Romans this is the
[44:53] scripture I searched for this morning
[44:55] and the Holy Spirit help me find it for
[44:56] the scripture says I'm the Pharaoh even
[44:58] for this same purpose I've raised the up
[45:01] that if I show my power me and that my
[45:04] name might be declared throughout all
[45:05] the earth see as he brought his armies
[45:08] to the Red Sea what was God a new show
[45:10] his power in Pharaoh had to use somebody
[45:13] so fara was another tool in the hand of
[45:16] God amen
[45:17] remember let's get to the u.s. now
[45:19] brother Branham says he drops this in
[45:21] and says I tell you Romanism is going to
[45:22] rule the word according to the Bible
[45:24] don't watch Iron Curtain is a bamboo
[45:27] currency so don't fight Russia so much
[45:29] in China but watch the purple curtain
[45:32] that's the one that's going to get you
[45:34] now this week did you see this week I
[45:37] hollow Catholic news
[45:38] servus it's a Catholic newspaper
[45:40] basically but their videos they put out
[45:42] every day did you see this week the Pope
[45:45] issued out a command for bishops to have
[45:48] apology services for all the molestation
[45:51] of children they've done and they had
[45:52] one right there I think in New York if
[45:54] I'm not mistaken and they're trying to
[45:58] make up and they're trying to show that
[46:01] a humility and apologize for some of
[46:04] these things and the other thing they
[46:06] did this week was they consecrated which
[46:08] I saw this is I can show it to you on
[46:10] youtube if you had it's right from
[46:11] Catholic News Service there's a move
[46:14] amongst the Catholic Church which is
[46:15] this is an act of deception they're
[46:17] having all these real women who are who
[46:20] are naturally merging women and they're
[46:23] married Jesus Christ and they're called
[46:25] the Virgin's of the church now look what
[46:27] the Catholic Church see how they're
[46:28] trying to mock the real thing
[46:30] and they're giving no words there and
[46:32] they have wedding dresses on I can show
[46:34] you the video these three women in
[46:35] America marry what was the principal one
[46:38] was a accountant he's three Catholic
[46:42] women in America and ever wedding
[46:44] dresses on and they're married Christ
[46:47] but the action what they're doing is
[46:48] marrying the Catholic Church because if
[46:50] they marry Christ Italy marry the word
[46:52] then they would have pray to marry then
[46:54] they would have pray to dead people
[46:55] right now look how shaken is what's he
[46:58] trying to do he's impersonating what's
[47:00] going on right now in a hat with the
[47:03] true Bride of Christ crisis washing us
[47:05] right and by our repentance that we
[47:07] become virgin to the word amen his
[47:09] brother branham said we were on our
[47:11] first I will says we were already
[47:12] married to sin we have a first husband
[47:15] none of us were pure right spiritually
[47:18] we all came into the world speaking live
[47:19] and programs or the Bible said that our
[47:21] first marriage had to die our first
[47:24] husband had to die and that was Satan
[47:26] that was sit in death
[47:27] we had to die to our sins but then Paul
[47:29] said that you might be married to
[47:31] somebody else amen
[47:32] and we got lose that we're married to
[47:34] Christ amen so see the washing of the
[47:37] water of the word makes us pure and
[47:39] virgin to Christ amen so CY said let's
[47:42] go brothers that's why I subscribe to
[47:43] them watch that Catholic Church watch
[47:47] what she's doing it'll show you what's
[47:48] going on amen
[47:49] perhaps the communist is nothing but a
[47:52] tool
[47:52] and playing right up don't fear is it
[47:56] don't fear about that that's something
[47:57] to throw you off the track of looking
[47:59] but Bible readers have many loved on
[48:02] stay with what the Bible said so see how
[48:04] there's a lot of attention on Isis and
[48:06] Iran and North Korea don't get me wrong
[48:08] they can do some real awful damage but
[48:10] if we get our ice off the Catholic
[48:12] Church well the random said that Satan's
[48:14] tactic to throw you off you won't see
[48:16] what your real I to be doing I have to
[48:18] close my ramps if you're going to meet
[48:19] the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church
[48:21] that's your true enemy he said why
[48:25] because they're enemies to the word I'm
[48:28] not the individuals are smelling we want
[48:30] to go fight them but we have to stand
[48:31] against them
[48:32] they're an enemy to true doctrine so
[48:36] again not to know it's not individual
[48:39] that's the center now it could be a verb
[48:40] not if there are predestinated be safe
[48:42] then it could be an individual but it's
[48:44] the spiritual wickedness behind an
[48:46] individual man may have said I said
[48:48] there's three isms that rose up not
[48:50] Nazism fascism communism three isms will
[48:53] revolve and come around to the one of
[48:55] the communism you watch on to to love
[48:57] God's hand they think they're against
[48:59] God they're working right into all the
[49:01] same don't know it he's just using the
[49:03] memo as a puppet uh-huh
[49:05] so I'm true in his hand like he didn't
[49:06] never can answer many the others see all
[49:08] these sinners are you know just a tool
[49:11] of the hand of God signs of his coming
[49:14] 62 he talks about the very Catholic
[49:17] President Kennedy as far as I know he's
[49:18] a man like anybody else it's not bad it
[49:21] wasn't a I mean it was a pretty good
[49:23] fella
[49:23] it was a jessebella hun and that's what
[49:25] was behind it that's the thing they've
[49:26] done the trouble it ain't Kennedy it's
[49:28] that jessabelle Church behind him praise
[49:31] God that's what's it doing it sure
[49:33] that's exactly so see now we're seeing
[49:36] how God is God is just pointing out on
[49:39] the Catholic Church came into our
[49:40] country there's an Iron Curtain blue
[49:43] purple brother don't you fear no the
[49:45] rest of a watch that purple curtain I'm
[49:49] gonna skip ahead
[49:50] talks about mister Kennedy getting he
[49:52] says not him it's that system behind him
[49:54] wait till she gets word into the cabinet
[49:56] remember I told you almost half of the
[49:59] Congress and Senate are Catholic now and
[50:03] brother Graham said in his day he said I
[50:04] think a half or a third
[50:06] or forth we're Pentecostal so see how
[50:08] the Catholic Church is moving in and
[50:11] everywhere she came in watch what
[50:13] happened watch what have done in other
[50:14] nations look what it's always done just
[50:17] a couple more of these ordered image to
[50:20] the beast exactly don't you fear a
[50:21] communist and you fear Catholicism now
[50:23] don't be scared but in other words
[50:24] respect and watch them watch their moves
[50:27] although they say we would come in like
[50:29] flatteries now we're look at the
[50:30] flatteries again in Chapter 11 in just a
[50:32] few minutes here it's a secret it's a
[50:35] look because it's time trade - the word
[50:37] time days ain't nothing but playing
[50:38] right at the hands of God
[50:40] he said now did you realize that do you
[50:43] ever think of that God has to make his
[50:44] word come to pass she's gotta have
[50:47] somebody fulfilled right and it's the
[50:48] people who rejected the truth any proxy
[50:51] don't stay with the word that's the
[50:53] reason I say today no matter how good it
[50:54] looks huh how many preachers are saying
[50:56] this or that I'm gonna take over the
[50:57] world throw it out don't you never try
[51:00] to fight communism fight Romanism for
[51:02] that thus saith the Lord look at that
[51:04] thus saith the lord the lord sent
[51:07] Romanism is going to rule not communism
[51:08] it's just a puppet that's why I must be
[51:11] careful organization an organizational
[51:14] spirit now let's get past that that just
[51:16] showing over the RAM said it's not my
[51:18] word it's the Word of God
[51:19] now I don't know if you saw this but you
[51:20] see this I think I've mentioned this
[51:22] about the Trump administration because
[51:24] Satan is working through the government
[51:26] right to make the Word of God come to
[51:29] pass you don't even know if my probably
[51:31] doesn't know it but God used it as a
[51:33] tool this was from a for 2017 I took a
[51:37] screenshot this morning from Washington
[51:38] Post Trump signs order seeking to allow
[51:42] churches to engage and more political
[51:45] activity
[51:47] here's actual words President Trump on
[51:50] Thursday this would make more signed
[51:52] executive order making it easier for
[51:54] churches to participate in politics and
[51:59] this was a campaign pledge apparently
[52:01] the order removes the financial threat
[52:04] so they used to be threatened by tax
[52:06] except churches from the IRS when
[52:08] pastors speak on behalf of potential
[52:10] candidates so what could they know now a
[52:12] pastor can support a candidate before
[52:15] they couldn't they get invited if there
[52:17] if there are nonprofit tax
[52:19] zette but now churches can start backing
[52:22] up certain candidates order brother
[52:26] grant say about the rapture and not the
[52:28] squeeze he said this is how it happens
[52:30] this ecumenical move it started - it
[52:33] seems like it's so beautiful purpose
[52:34] becomes so strong politically the
[52:37] churches get strong politically and now
[52:40] the churches are getting more political
[52:42] influence we're living in the midst of
[52:45] Scripture being fulfilled that she bears
[52:48] pressure upon the government to cause us
[52:50] all to join with her either directly or
[52:52] through adhere to the principles enacted
[52:54] into law that no leaf will be recognized
[52:56] as actual churches unless under direct
[52:59] or indirect domination of this council
[53:00] and guess what if were still alive of
[53:02] this happens we're gonna lose our right
[53:04] to have this church right we don't have
[53:07] any property but they'll kick us out
[53:09] with all the might of organization the
[53:12] false church turns from any vestige of
[53:14] truth and with political night but man
[53:16] keeps repeating this over and over and
[53:18] over in the church Facebook reinforces
[53:21] herself with state backing and sets out
[53:23] to eradicate forever the true believer
[53:25] but just when she's about to accomplish
[53:27] her comedy pot the weed is Gavin into
[53:29] darkness the little seat churches
[53:32] involved in politics and Trump is like
[53:34] all the image uncle's would Pat them on
[53:36] the back
[53:36] Franklin Graham Billy Graham's son back
[53:39] above the back you name it Mike Huckabee
[53:42] a preacher all these guys they're so
[53:44] happy he's in their church I'm not I'm
[53:47] saying lies he might be anointed by God
[53:49] Trump was what I'm saying but over all
[53:51] his life lined up with the word not even
[53:53] a chance I'm married three times he'll
[53:55] strip clubs at this guy but just like
[53:58] Cyrus right just like Darius there under
[54:01] an anointing a commission by God what to
[54:04] fulfill the wrong word of God them the
[54:06] word of the judgement word I'm not
[54:10] saying you know they are I'm not saying
[54:12] I don't know who say but I know their
[54:14] lives are reminded with the work when
[54:15] they cuss and smoke and swear you know
[54:17] drinking all kinds of things like this
[54:19] and cursed people come on we know better
[54:22] net nut tree is known by its fruit it
[54:26] has the fall shirts with all cunning and
[54:28] diabolical power made up of what
[54:29] political force
[54:30] so the churches get strong
[54:33] with politics physical force and demons
[54:36] of Darkness come against the true by the
[54:38] truth vying with the fullness of the
[54:41] Spirit sees the force of Pentecost like
[54:43] we've been saying the fullness of the
[54:44] sphere of the word would be the very
[54:46] acts of power that Jesus did what I
[54:49] promised say that man that she nears her
[54:51] headstone becoming like a clue the word
[54:53] Jesus will come that the bride agreement
[54:56] we heard for every night is one you like
[54:59] that by God's making had none of you saw
[55:00] today this was part of it but I never
[55:02] time to get this but the Supreme Court
[55:03] ruled today that this church this
[55:07] Lutheran Church I think in Missouri can
[55:09] now get federal funding so see before
[55:13] church is going to get federal funding
[55:14] because you have to separate church and
[55:15] state but the Supreme Court ruled today
[55:17] that they can so now church is it
[55:20] starting to get federal funding now look
[55:21] at that church and if you know anything
[55:23] I work in a school if the school doesn't
[55:25] line up with the federal government's
[55:28] laws the money gets cut so every school
[55:31] follows in line with the law but now
[55:34] what about the churches if the churches
[55:36] are going to start getting money
[55:38] I don't know well they know but this
[55:41] church is getting money and all the
[55:42] money is for to pay from the parking lot
[55:44] instead of doing a missionary trip or
[55:46] you know feed the bar they just want
[55:49] money for the parking lot
[55:50] Oh God have mercy don't be wrong we need
[55:53] good parking lots I'm thankful upon your
[55:55] lap but what would I have a parking lot
[55:57] or a missionary trip let's end the
[55:58] mission in government money politics
[56:02] becoming the charges are with me you see
[56:05] how God is orchestrating all this the
[56:07] coming Lord might be next week it might
[56:08] be next year you might be in 50 years
[56:11] inviting a hundred years but we can
[56:13] clearly see that churches and politics
[56:15] have to get more involved and churches
[56:18] have to have more influence with
[56:20] politics and they're getting it all
[56:24] right now we don't have time now I don't
[56:29] have time to go through all this so I'm
[56:32] just leading the highlights because like
[56:33] I said I had the least amount of clothes
[56:35] on this chapter now there is a comment
[56:39] in the in the Holman commentary that
[56:42] says this chapter is some of the most
[56:44] detailed prophecy in the entire
[56:46] it's just like Jesus's crucifixion you
[56:49] know they mock and they spit on him you
[56:52] know male stars you see his bones
[56:53] remember all those prophecies my God my
[56:56] God my self forsaken me scholars have
[56:59] said this is some of the most specific
[57:01] prophecy in the entire Bible is chapter
[57:03] 11 so I want to make sure I will go
[57:06] every day now in verse 3 we read verse 1
[57:10] to the mighty king that verse three has
[57:12] to be out into the grate and a mighty
[57:15] king shall stand up that shall rule with
[57:17] great Dominion and do according to his
[57:18] will remember there are the meats of
[57:19] persons the Grecian Empire hasn't come
[57:21] yet but a mighty king has to rise up
[57:24] that's got to be that kind of the great
[57:25] because in verse skort
[57:26] his kingdom is broken right and when he
[57:29] so stand up his kingdom shall be broken
[57:31] and shall be divided towards the four
[57:32] winds of heaven and not to his
[57:34] possession not his posterity so what's
[57:36] the his family there was four kings that
[57:40] took over for rulers after him nor
[57:42] according to his Dominion which he ruled
[57:44] for his kingdom shall be up even
[57:46] for others beside those now in verses 4
[57:50] to 6 it mentions the king of the north
[57:53] and the King of the South now the king
[57:56] of the south is the Egyptian ruler this
[57:59] is according to history and then the
[58:02] king of the north is the Grecian ruler
[58:03] which would have been now attending the
[58:05] great or the Grecian Empire let me show
[58:07] you what I mean here this is a map of
[58:09] the Greek Empire
[58:11] okay so member of I'm not mistaken yeah
[58:15] Daniels right throughout it right around
[58:17] here now the Greek Empire is going to
[58:19] take over the Medes of Persians at about
[58:21] 100 or so years right right around 150
[58:25] years by God's grace once the Greek
[58:27] Empire took over here Jerusalem and
[58:29] Daniels rocket prophecies was not the
[58:31] holy people so the king of the south
[58:33] what south of Jerusalem that's a real
[58:35] King Egypt the great military force what
[58:39] would be the king of the north there is
[58:41] Greek over there the Greeks are they're
[58:42] Macedonian and they ruled all this
[58:45] Empire so the king of the north would
[58:47] have been the Grecian Empire the king of
[58:48] the south would have been the Egyptian
[58:50] Empire so hope you can see that does
[58:53] that help by God's grace now brother
[58:55] Graham tells us in our day the king of
[58:59] the north is rush
[59:00] in our day because look how big rush is
[59:03] like most of this up here is Russia
[59:05] which is a major huge part of the Asian
[59:08] capital the largest part so I hope that
[59:12] helps
[59:12] there's Israel king of the north would
[59:14] have to bend the Greeks in the South
[59:16] would have been Egypt they're a great
[59:18] military power now I'm going to skip
[59:22] verses as I said verses for all the way
[59:26] to 20 because this has been proven
[59:30] historically to be Egypt the King of the
[59:34] South and the king of the north was the
[59:36] king of that was the Grecian for Greece
[59:38] and King house and the great and then
[59:39] before Kings who came off with him and
[59:41] so forth like I said there's a lot of
[59:44] history behind that now I want to skip
[59:47] back to verse 21 let's go through verse
[59:50] 21 I'm gonna start getting some quotes
[59:52] here and in his estate shall stand up a
[59:58] vile person to whom they shall not give
[1:00:01] the honor of the kingdom but he shall
[1:00:03] come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom
[1:00:05] by flatters and that should sound
[1:00:07] premier who's me recently preached on
[1:00:08] that in Daniel chapter 8 we looked at
[1:00:12] the Grecian Empire as well to meet some
[1:00:14] Persians now verses 21 to 31 is a
[1:00:21] compound prophesy of Antiochus 2/4 which
[1:00:25] he already went over in chapter 8 was
[1:00:27] the little horn if I remember that in
[1:00:29] those been a while if you remember we
[1:00:31] breached up a little horn I got the
[1:00:32] notice here who would eat nothing he was
[1:00:34] the little horn according to history
[1:00:36] so this ruler is the little horn this
[1:00:39] random raises up this vile person and he
[1:00:42] types the future Antichrist that we
[1:00:45] preached out of Daniel 8 verses 9 to 12
[1:00:47] and 23 to 25 that's Antiochus now this
[1:00:53] is common how many know it's common for
[1:00:55] God to use compound prophecy never know
[1:00:58] that for example when God said out of
[1:01:00] Egypt I called my son who's that
[1:01:03] referred to three people was referred to
[1:01:05] Jacob it was referred to Egypt when
[1:01:07] Moses brought out his people on the
[1:01:09] Egypt and referred to Christ when Joseph
[1:01:11] of Mary Bach
[1:01:12] Egypt that's a compound prophecy and how
[1:01:15] about the compilot prophecies of the
[1:01:17] spirit of Elijah right the spirit of
[1:01:19] Elijah dealt with five people see how
[1:01:22] its compound the spirit of Elijah rest
[1:01:24] on Elijah John the Baptist brother
[1:01:26] Branham and that's that prophet in
[1:01:29] revelation 11
[1:01:30] alright now this is common God using a
[1:01:35] current world ruler to type another
[1:01:38] person because this was done with the
[1:01:40] king of Tyrus who was the king of
[1:01:42] Lebanon which is in the country north of
[1:01:44] Israel in Ezekiel 28 12 through 19
[1:01:47] remember that God told his ego that this
[1:01:50] King type Lucifer the anointed cherub
[1:01:52] that covereth remember that by God's
[1:01:54] grace or anybody wouldn't read that and
[1:01:57] would read that would you remember that
[1:01:58] okay so he talked about the king of Tyre
[1:02:01] says don't worry once we said that you
[1:02:02] must remember that good but God uses
[1:02:05] Tyrus and he types him to Satan and said
[1:02:08] you were to eat in the garden of God and
[1:02:11] you were the anointed cherub and you had
[1:02:13] pipes that coverage remember that and
[1:02:15] you'll be brought down to hell and all
[1:02:17] the nations those blundering saying was
[1:02:19] this Amana to see the nation's oh my to
[1:02:23] see God can use compound prophecy that's
[1:02:27] why we can't get this by education it's
[1:02:28] got to be by revelation in other words
[1:02:31] we need a prophet to come and tell us
[1:02:32] say for the we're gonna mix it up we're
[1:02:35] gonna try to do build a Bible School you
[1:02:37] know we'll try to go to the phd's and
[1:02:39] all that we got to go to a prophet of
[1:02:41] God that's God's always way he's done
[1:02:43] now let's read verse 31 as folks brother
[1:02:47] Graham gives us specific quotes on these
[1:02:49] two scriptures in this chick in this
[1:02:51] section here 21 we already read take the
[1:02:54] kingdom by flatteries and then
[1:02:56] 31 it's only 3:31 for me and they show
[1:03:12] please amen
[1:03:17] now I'm gonna read two quotes I have to
[1:03:19] coach her brother Graham about verse 21
[1:03:22] that we just read and then verse 31 that
[1:03:25] were added just
[1:03:26] okay so this gives us an idea and these
[1:03:29] two quotes will show us that brother
[1:03:31] Branham used this section about
[1:03:33] Antiochus I never named Antiochus that I
[1:03:35] found yet but he used both those
[1:03:38] scriptures as a foreshadowing of the
[1:03:41] future Antichrist and that's exactly
[1:03:43] what we saw in chapter 89 all those
[1:03:46] types were foreshadowing the future
[1:03:49] Antichrist and this is what scholars
[1:03:52] agree with like I said this scholar
[1:03:54] Holman here and all the commentaries I
[1:03:55] read they'd all agree this is
[1:03:56] foreshadowing off so of the Antichrist
[1:03:58] because both hated the Jews right the
[1:04:03] rome was going to pretend to like the
[1:04:04] Jews for the first half of the of the
[1:04:06] Covenant but then they're gonna break
[1:04:08] the covenant the Bible said in Daniel
[1:04:10] chapter 9 work through that they break
[1:04:11] the code now I'm trying little nervous
[1:04:16] tonight forgive me let me try slow down
[1:04:17] here
[1:04:18] forgive me the first seal Lorena talks
[1:04:22] about Daniel 11 21 so let's kind of get
[1:04:25] into his thought never first seal so I'm
[1:04:27] a white horse rider spear the Antichrist
[1:04:29] and this spirit eventually turns into
[1:04:31] what the person of the Antichrist now he
[1:04:35] become a man in the crowd give us the
[1:04:37] first vote read and notice or read
[1:04:40] rather how daniel said he would take
[1:04:41] over the church kingdom would you like
[1:04:44] to read it we have time to read it
[1:04:45] happily all right let's go to Daniel
[1:04:46] just a moment turn back to look at
[1:04:48] Daniel will read just a moment and we
[1:04:50] won't be made another 15
[1:04:51] let's get Daniel 11 chapter let's take
[1:04:53] the 21st verse you just read it now
[1:04:57] here's the scripture and it is a station
[1:04:59] set of a mile vs. Rome events in Rome
[1:05:02] talking to whom they shall not get the
[1:05:05] heart of the kingdom now watch but each
[1:05:07] you're coming piece of lead coming
[1:05:09] peacefully and obtain the kingdom by
[1:05:11] flatteries Laurentian this is the
[1:05:14] Antichrist
[1:05:15] that's exactly what it does what Daniel
[1:05:18] said the Antichrist would do he would
[1:05:20] fit the people's place yes a bit there
[1:05:24] menu for this day for the churches for
[1:05:27] in this church age they don't want the
[1:05:29] word Christ but they want church why'd
[1:05:34] you come here tonight you get heard for
[1:05:36] the word today
[1:05:37] I don't come here just to come to church
[1:05:38] I could go to ensure there's a lot of
[1:05:40] churches closer to my house than this
[1:05:42] church I come here because this church
[1:05:43] stands on the way if it doesn't how do
[1:05:46] you reside and get somebody here that
[1:05:48] links the right thing I believe I'm
[1:05:49] preaching the genophage yeah nobody's
[1:05:51] corrected me so somebody crack me up on
[1:05:53] that I always want to be open to God's
[1:05:55] leadership god I try to bring somebody
[1:05:57] in or pulled me out I just want to be
[1:05:59] neutral to the will of God but I believe
[1:06:01] I'm preaching the truth the first thing
[1:06:03] they don't ask you you're a Christian
[1:06:04] how many times am I to talk to people
[1:06:05] they never asked them you Christians
[1:06:07] they say what denomination what church
[1:06:09] do you belong to my church they don't
[1:06:11] want Christ the word you tell them about
[1:06:13] the word comes straight up they don't
[1:06:15] want that they want something just live
[1:06:18] any way they want to and still belong to
[1:06:20] the church and obtain their testimony
[1:06:22] see he fits there many just exactly
[1:06:25] remember he was finally called sheet in
[1:06:27] the Bible and she was the prostitute
[1:06:28] that daughter's just fits the bill of
[1:06:30] the day what the people want there it is
[1:06:32] God has promised that what the worst
[1:06:34] refused and they turned to their desires
[1:06:36] let's read those lines again now second
[1:06:41] Thessalonians 2 9 through 11
[1:06:43] it said they went turned out they reject
[1:06:45] the truth and be given over to a
[1:06:47] reprobate mind believe a lie and be
[1:06:49] damned by it now that's what the Holy
[1:06:51] Spirit said so that lets just apply that
[1:06:54] to ourselves we have to keep constantly
[1:06:57] staying humble the presence of God the
[1:06:59] Word of God ever reveals something need
[1:07:02] to walk into and you say God if I can't
[1:07:04] wear right now help me to a baby soon
[1:07:06] yeah but we cannot say I do not I could
[1:07:09] never do that we can if we do that then
[1:07:11] that will happen to us we become a stiff
[1:07:13] starchy cold church member we got to let
[1:07:16] the Holy Spirit lead us back where Japan
[1:07:17] economy the fullness of the Spirit and
[1:07:21] the fullness of Pentecost the Upstate
[1:07:22] the Lord's gonna be in the church the
[1:07:24] true church so see me you never can
[1:07:27] never turn that down like I've asked
[1:07:28] some people to come early and pray if
[1:07:29] you can or pray more at home that's
[1:07:31] wonderful with Holy Spirit leading us to
[1:07:34] more of that more more sacrifice grace
[1:07:37] God Father that I believe he is I
[1:07:40] believe so don't let me get cold we only
[1:07:42] had that you want to give ourselves a
[1:07:45] now isn't that design of the church
[1:07:47] today you try to tell them that to do
[1:07:49] this is that the
[1:07:50] to you right quick there Methodist press
[1:07:52] they don't have to paddle in your boat
[1:07:55] certainly they wanted and God said if
[1:07:57] they want it I'll just let them have it
[1:07:59] and I'll actually make them believe it's
[1:08:00] a truth because I'll give them a
[1:08:01] reprobate mind concerning the truth now
[1:08:04] here's the quote I read the last few
[1:08:05] services remember this the born-again
[1:08:07] experience will be rejected in favor of
[1:08:09] church join the depths of Satan had
[1:08:12] enter in that age so it's wonderful that
[1:08:14] we come to church and we're members were
[1:08:17] tied bears you know we're faithful
[1:08:18] that's wonderful
[1:08:20] but we got a listing and how the Holy
[1:08:22] Spirit amen
[1:08:23] I know that simple but it's emotional
[1:08:25] affair because it will prove if we're a
[1:08:27] true Bride of Christ and the true bride
[1:08:29] of christ jesus said will be guided into
[1:08:31] all truth and I know that our truth I
[1:08:34] need to walk into and I believe you did
[1:08:36] too by God's grace we've got to walk
[1:08:37] into those now that's the one quote I
[1:08:40] can find her brother Graham closed
[1:08:42] Daniel 11 21 there's only one that I
[1:08:44] could find I searched all those words in
[1:08:46] there about person the only time he
[1:08:48] mentioned it remember he said if I ever
[1:08:51] preach anything inspired it was the 17
[1:08:53] of us because every morning he'd go
[1:08:55] before God the angel would reveal what
[1:08:57] that interpretation was of that
[1:08:58] Scripture did you know brother Graham
[1:08:59] said those seven seals were the most
[1:09:02] anointed series of sermons he ever
[1:09:04] preached and he preached to a hundred
[1:09:06] thousand people one time and it was more
[1:09:09] anointed to sit in a room and have God
[1:09:11] show him not say the Lord every morning
[1:09:13] that was more anointed he said than
[1:09:15] saying all the miracles and blind eyes
[1:09:17] open that's me that's amazing church but
[1:09:21] why was it because an angel of God would
[1:09:22] come to him he said I stand for an hour
[1:09:24] watching the vision once it Levi be worn
[1:09:26] out he's I spend the rest of they riding
[1:09:28] it down I just saw and then making sure
[1:09:30] lined up with the body because even
[1:09:33] Angels have to be taken back to the Word
[1:09:34] of God if it ain't because you Paul said
[1:09:37] if an angel or anyone else preach
[1:09:39] anything other what I teach
[1:09:40] let it be cursed see how the scripture
[1:09:44] brother and was he saw an angel and they
[1:09:46] said I got to take that angels word back
[1:09:47] to the word if an a just go back to word
[1:09:53] how about brother Branham we got to take
[1:09:54] this one back to the word right
[1:09:57] everybody's got me thinking back to the
[1:09:58] word except Christ because he is the
[1:10:00] word right
[1:10:03] all right now now I got one quote on
[1:10:06] Daniel 11:31 and this is America the
[1:10:11] Dome of the rock will stand until God
[1:10:13] returned to - so let's go let me
[1:10:15] rehearse 31 because it's a little less
[1:10:17] per minute it's an read to us he said an
[1:10:19] arm shall stand on his part and they
[1:10:22] shall pollute the sanctuary what's that
[1:10:24] that's the Jewish sanctuary that's the
[1:10:27] sanctuary Daniel of Danish people and
[1:10:29] shall take away the daily sacrifice and
[1:10:32] they shall place the abomination to make
[1:10:35] it desolate
[1:10:36] okay so what does that mean well that's
[1:10:38] gonna tell us after the rapture the Jews
[1:10:41] have to rebuild the temple and they have
[1:10:44] to start sacrificing animals because
[1:10:46] member they don't receive Christ until
[1:10:48] after the three and a half years of the
[1:10:50] ministry those two prophets so they're
[1:10:52] going to be sacrificing animals for
[1:10:53] three half years and they're gonna have
[1:10:55] a daily sacrifice right but once the
[1:10:59] prophets get done and they get ratcheted
[1:11:00] up all but I would think the remnant
[1:11:02] rejoices and then Christ comes back and
[1:11:06] then they're going to board from one
[1:11:13] house to another but then they'll be
[1:11:15] bored one day 144,000 feet will be
[1:11:18] filled the Holy Ghost or the rain shower
[1:11:21] that would be amen
[1:11:22] they got 120 the day of Pentecost
[1:11:24] imagine 144,000 glory amen
[1:11:29] can you imagine that church Wow -
[1:11:32] brother grant us a 1961 directly about
[1:11:34] Daniel 11:31 that's why I'm happy to
[1:11:37] preach us tonight because it's not I
[1:11:38] thought it's the prophets top it's the
[1:11:41] best I can do as a preacher has to
[1:11:43] rightly divide the word that's what Paul
[1:11:44] told Timothy
[1:11:45] so I'm right trying to rightly divide
[1:11:46] the word to you that I've heard brother
[1:11:50] Branham in Daniel 11 a lot of it chapter
[1:11:52] 30 McPherson 31st verse
[1:11:54] teachers of the day taking away the
[1:11:56] daily sacrifice and the abomination of
[1:11:58] desolation would you please explain what
[1:12:00] these are yes but then please explain
[1:12:02] them to me
[1:12:03] I don't know oh this person inside their
[1:12:06] name okay this is my subject on next
[1:12:09] Sunday comes the Daniel 70 weeks but I
[1:12:12] might just say this to you my most
[1:12:13] precious brother inside here this
[1:12:15] very dear friend to all of us yes the
[1:12:17] abominations of baby desolation Jesus in
[1:12:20] Matthew 24 spoke of it
[1:12:22] the abomination means filthiness that
[1:12:24] make a desolation abomination that was
[1:12:27] the mosque of Omar that stood on the
[1:12:29] temple grounds where the holy place
[1:12:31] stood now I preached on this in 2015
[1:12:33] I think Bo was there when I preached it
[1:12:34] not sure you guys were there on that
[1:12:36] Sunday when I preach it but brother man
[1:12:39] is actually talking about with the Dome
[1:12:40] of the rock the mosque of Omar's in a
[1:12:42] different location it's it's a real
[1:12:44] place but he's referring to the Dome of
[1:12:46] the rock because the Dome of the rock
[1:12:47] was built on the the temple site where
[1:12:50] Solomon's Temple used to be so I know
[1:12:53] what you get your words mixed up but
[1:12:54] just so you know this actually refers to
[1:12:56] the Dome of the rock in 1896 time is
[1:13:00] actually 80 70 Titus came and captured
[1:13:02] Jerusalem and burnt the temple and they
[1:13:04] built the mosque of Omar and she means
[1:13:05] Dome of the rock the Muhammad religion
[1:13:08] right on the temple grounds and still
[1:13:09] stands there to this day and it will
[1:13:11] stand there until God returns to the
[1:13:13] Jews again in other words that no one's
[1:13:17] going to be there until sometime right
[1:13:18] by the rapture so we see that dome going
[1:13:21] down that's another sign get ready but
[1:13:23] we shouldn't feel like a pull to get
[1:13:24] ready right now
[1:13:25] hey man that's right I'm glad you so
[1:13:28] what do you do right guess if you could
[1:13:29] repair that we never supposed to God as
[1:13:32] I know Brandon and loved the Lord as
[1:13:34] much as I can go to God now I want to
[1:13:37] make it myself ready no matter what I'm
[1:13:39] not waiting for those outside signs if I
[1:13:41] see them praise God but I'm already
[1:13:42] ready right now
[1:13:43] amen I've already confessed all myself
[1:13:45] I'm trying to live close to Christ and
[1:13:47] service people amen see some people
[1:13:50] ain't you oh when I see Lausanne just go
[1:13:52] down then already don't wait for that
[1:13:55] get ready right now yeah get ready right
[1:13:57] now God make me gracious and even they
[1:13:59] allow that to happen because we have
[1:14:01] thus hid the Lord on that he may allow
[1:14:02] that to happen before the rapture but we
[1:14:03] don't know he nail out of the tent the
[1:14:05] Dome of the rock to be destroyed we
[1:14:07] don't know but we do know this that all
[1:14:09] that the father's call will be made
[1:14:11] ready and Christ won't lose one day men
[1:14:14] and so we fool the flow now that's why
[1:14:17] we're here on Wednesday night you could
[1:14:18] be home asleep you be home somewhere
[1:14:20] else you could be other part to join
[1:14:21] this nice weather but I like the
[1:14:23] spiritual either anything
[1:14:25] this is more important I could be having
[1:14:27] a meal at Applebee's I have a meal at
[1:14:29] McDonald's or some but this is the best
[1:14:31] thing I could have right here the love
[1:14:32] of God amen yes it's exactly right
[1:14:35] amen he said Jesus referred to it and
[1:14:38] said let he that readeth understands he
[1:14:39] therefore he gives so many days from
[1:14:41] that time so high for the Prince and so
[1:14:43] many days and so forth would you get the
[1:14:44] next Sunday and I'll try to the best of
[1:14:46] my knowledge to get it in for you next
[1:14:48] Sunday but the foundation is that mosque
[1:14:49] of Omar that took the place the temple
[1:14:51] that when you see the abomination to
[1:14:52] make the desolation spoken by of by
[1:14:55] Daniel the prophet Daniel standing the
[1:14:57] holy place see standing where the temple
[1:14:58] stood in the mask of all month
[1:14:59] okay so verse 31 refers to the daily
[1:15:07] sacrifice that the Jews 144,000 after
[1:15:12] the rapture will start offering but the
[1:15:14] Antichrist will come in there and stop
[1:15:16] the daily sacrifice that's what it
[1:15:17] refers to all right now let's get ahead
[1:15:21] I did those okay yeah okay I just these
[1:15:26] are some of the key words I typed in in
[1:15:28] the message just so you know there's
[1:15:29] only one bow person there's 15 flattery
[1:15:32] some of them deal with the Antichrist
[1:15:33] just a few do exploit three - I'll get
[1:15:35] to that a little bit king of the south
[1:15:37] zero hits king of the north so but I've
[1:15:39] never interpret scheme the south that's
[1:15:40] why I had to go to history to find that
[1:15:42] and it seems to line up with history now
[1:15:45] let's look at a few flatteries quotes
[1:15:46] because there's more flattery scriptures
[1:15:48] one of verse 32 and such as do wickedly
[1:15:53] against the covenant shall he crumped by
[1:15:55] flatteries to see the Antichrist is
[1:15:59] gonna corrupt through flatteries
[1:16:01] whoever's against the Jewish covenant
[1:16:03] he's going to corrupt the whole world
[1:16:04] they don't see everybody hates the Jews
[1:16:06] right now have you seen that recently
[1:16:08] last month they've had a meeting of the
[1:16:09] UN and everybody hates the Jews except
[1:16:12] in the u.s. almost everybody hates the
[1:16:15] Jews and jaesuk you know he's from the
[1:16:18] is from a Christian law Association he
[1:16:21] went into her to sit up for the Jews he
[1:16:24] said we're Christians when we stand up
[1:16:25] for the Jews in America bless that guy's
[1:16:27] heart they got it filled with power I
[1:16:29] don't know what he believes but he stood
[1:16:32] up for God's people God said anybody
[1:16:33] stands up for the Jew
[1:16:34] unless that but if you stand up against
[1:16:37] something you're cursed that's right now
[1:16:41] verse 32 I didn't finish it did I didn't
[1:16:44] know anything
[1:16:45] he struck my flatteries but the people
[1:16:47] that know their God shall be strong and
[1:16:49] do exploits now this could be referring
[1:16:52] to the Jews I believe it's referred to
[1:16:54] the Jews my man who often applies it to
[1:16:55] the Gentiles so he has a little
[1:16:58] carryover but I'm not sure so I mean
[1:17:00] I'll show you the quotes on the
[1:17:01] flatteries now this is a lot I'm not
[1:17:04] going to read all this because of time
[1:17:05] Graham talks about what we preached on
[1:17:08] the lion we preached on that in Daniel
[1:17:11] chapter 8 I'm not mistaken hey Rome in
[1:17:14] other words about Rome what has done it
[1:17:16] in the kindness as he said he come in
[1:17:18] with flatteries and what has he done he
[1:17:20] bring in the prize two ecumenical
[1:17:22] council the world churches the spirit of
[1:17:24] Antichrist upon both of them bringing
[1:17:25] them to slaughter because I'm just
[1:17:28] showing you the point but brother Adam
[1:17:29] talks about flatteries he's always
[1:17:31] talking about the Antichrist deceiving
[1:17:32] the false church okay he says it get in
[1:17:35] peace to the trumpets that's the same
[1:17:38] quote isn't it yeah I got to close up my
[1:17:40] partner this was different
[1:17:43] Sardis in church age look he says
[1:17:45] preachers will give in with the excuse
[1:17:47] that they will serve God within the
[1:17:48] framework banana Christ be system they
[1:17:51] will give it to the flatteries and
[1:17:53] blandishments of the hierarchy and
[1:17:55] people will follow these false shepherds
[1:17:56] right to the slaughter I know about you
[1:17:58] but I want to be a real preacher that
[1:18:00] doesn't bow to the pressures and money
[1:18:02] and done of it right but he said all the
[1:18:06] preachers know Hanson will give in to
[1:18:07] the flatteries of the Antichrist
[1:18:09] oh we love these uh Protestant people
[1:18:11] I'll be careful be careful that puts
[1:18:15] behind him that spirit of rome's behind
[1:18:17] him at conquering spirit can I check
[1:18:21] something real quick mm-hmm I thought I
[1:18:24] had on my device where the Pope was
[1:18:29] inviting all the Protestants back do you
[1:18:31] read that from a few years ago never
[1:18:33] remember that come on oh yeah I put it
[1:18:41] on here I thought I had it on my my
[1:18:44] videos
[1:18:49] maybe not
[1:18:51] this is where well famous preacher I'm
[1:18:54] not gonna cause damage you can read it a
[1:18:55] famous preacher called everybody that
[1:18:58] he's a very influential Protestant
[1:19:00] preacher he called everybody back and
[1:19:03] said we have so much in common with the
[1:19:04] Roman Catholic Church and doesn't even
[1:19:06] know what he's doing yeah he's gotta be
[1:19:08] blood
[1:19:08] he's tell me we need to unite why don't
[1:19:11] ya I was looking for the one where the
[1:19:15] boat gave it to the Pentecostals a few
[1:19:18] years ago I played it before me was I
[1:19:20] let me see my place real quick here okay
[1:19:28] humility Pope Francis is the perfect
[1:19:32] example of this his is doing everything
[1:19:36] right you see people who listen to what
[1:19:39] we say if they like what they see and he
[1:19:47] was very very symbolic in you know his
[1:19:49] first master people AIDS is is a kissing
[1:19:53] this warm man is Columbia children this
[1:19:57] authenticity this humility the caring
[1:19:59] for the poor this is what the whole
[1:20:01] world expects us Christians to do and
[1:20:03] when we when they go oh that's what a
[1:20:05] Christian does like in fact there's a
[1:20:07] headline here in Orange County that I
[1:20:08] love that like I say that it said if you
[1:20:11] love post Francis you don't love Jesus
[1:20:20] okay so see appearing to be so humble
[1:20:26] just like Jesus well Jesus also he was
[1:20:29] humble but he is also man of power he's
[1:20:32] also man opinion out the false things in
[1:20:34] the church and clean up the temple so I
[1:20:37] just want you to show that look how and
[1:20:38] this was right when he got elected a
[1:20:40] couple of years ago I don't have to get
[1:20:42] the other one you probably member it
[1:20:43] where he invited the Pentecostal said
[1:20:45] let's be brothers again come back and be
[1:20:48] brothers but I thought I had it on my
[1:20:49] device I'm sorry I know it's on their
[1:20:53] home computer I just looked at it the
[1:20:54] other day
[1:20:55] okay sorry okay let's go back
[1:21:01] flatteries humble look uh sweetie
[1:21:04] be careful yeah verses 32 to 35 in the
[1:21:09] Holman this refers to Antiochus the
[1:21:12] fourth again he was with almost awful
[1:21:15] miss treaty was one of most awful
[1:21:18] violent leaders towards the Jews ever
[1:21:20] now the exploits in verse 32 read that
[1:21:24] they didn't know their God shall be
[1:21:26] strong and do exploits the exploits seem
[1:21:28] to refer to Judah Maccabee and his
[1:21:30] faithful Jews who ultimately defeated
[1:21:32] the armies of Antiochus and rededicated
[1:21:35] the Holy Temple in Jerusalem in 164 BC
[1:21:38] establishing the festival of Hanukkah
[1:21:40] Grob that two weeks ago when we did
[1:21:42] chapter 80 but brother Brandon getting
[1:21:46] numerous quotes about exploits referring
[1:21:47] to the new tests in the church and
[1:21:49] there's only one verse I think in the
[1:21:50] Bible that deals it experts actually I'm
[1:21:52] gonna check it out make sure exploits
[1:22:01] report Church
[1:22:02] yeah there's two okay yes they're both
[1:22:04] in Daniel 11 Daniel 1120 1130 to talk
[1:22:08] about exploits with 32 is the one we're
[1:22:12] looking at and they that know their God
[1:22:14] should be strong and do exploits so
[1:22:16] whoever now this is talked about the day
[1:22:18] that Christ he comes in my flatteries
[1:22:21] but the people that know their God
[1:22:23] should be strongly to the exploits so
[1:22:25] see I believe since this talk about the
[1:22:26] Antichrist
[1:22:27] I believe this people is the Jews I just
[1:22:30] want to know that brother Graham said
[1:22:32] the pride who exploits - I could be
[1:22:34] wrong but member of the Antichrist isn't
[1:22:37] revealed until after the holy spirit is
[1:22:39] taken out of the way remember that
[1:22:42] let's read assbutt a second
[1:22:43] Thessalonians chapter 2 so we could be
[1:22:45] at that and that's all my video the
[1:22:47] video we made on the rapture 5 reason
[1:22:49] the rapture is pre-tribulation let's go
[1:22:52] 2nd thessalonians chapter 2
[1:22:53] Emer
[1:22:56] the holy spirit will be taken out of the
[1:22:58] way
[1:23:06] now verse 4 who opposes and exalts
[1:23:09] himself above all that is called God or
[1:23:11] that is worshipped so that he as God
[1:23:12] sitteth in the temple of God showing
[1:23:14] himself that He is God remember D not
[1:23:17] that when I was with yet with you I told
[1:23:18] you these things and now you know what
[1:23:22] withholdeth that he might be revealed in
[1:23:25] this time in other words Paul says some
[1:23:27] things are gonna be Holden until the
[1:23:28] hand of Christ is revealed he exhausted
[1:23:30] himself above all it's called God he
[1:23:32] sits in the temple of God saying that he
[1:23:34] is God so easy to sit the Jewish temple
[1:23:36] saying that he's got for the mystery of
[1:23:39] iniquity doth already work only he who
[1:23:41] now letteth will let until he be taken
[1:23:44] out of the way so see God's gonna let
[1:23:47] all these things just move on until he
[1:23:50] me take it away speaking on the Holy
[1:23:51] Spirit because look and then show that
[1:23:55] link it be revealed just see the Holy
[1:23:57] Spirit has to be taken away the church
[1:23:59] has to be taken away then the wicked
[1:24:01] ones revealed whom the Lord shall
[1:24:03] consume with the spirit of his mouth and
[1:24:05] shall destroy with the brightness of his
[1:24:07] coming even him whose coming is after
[1:24:10] the working of Satan see his powers
[1:24:11] after the work of Satan with all power
[1:24:13] and signs and look we done lying wonders
[1:24:16] watch that boat if it's not in our day
[1:24:18] it's the next generation
[1:24:19] the Pope's can have live miracles he's
[1:24:22] gonna deceive the people with lying
[1:24:24] miracles never understand that hope
[1:24:26] that's okay
[1:24:27] all right so now you're not you're good
[1:24:30] on that now let me just read these
[1:24:32] quotes so you're aware of him look
[1:24:33] around there's there's numerous close
[1:24:35] recent Brian doing exploits and we know
[1:24:36] she will the ask mother grandma
[1:24:39] questions answers is the private have
[1:24:40] great miracles before the rapture he
[1:24:41] said they're going on right now he said
[1:24:44] the big things about the moon changing
[1:24:46] the blood and islands of mountains being
[1:24:48] thrown away that's for the Jews but the
[1:24:51] regular miracles for the Jen's house
[1:24:53] they're going on right now and they're
[1:24:54] not gonna stop until the rapture ain't
[1:24:56] that mean right that's exactly right
[1:24:59] now Moran said when the church puts
[1:25:01] forth another church it'll be a
[1:25:02] Pentecostal church with the science of
[1:25:05] the acts and the Apostles doing the same
[1:25:08] thing with the same Jesus working the
[1:25:09] same because he's the same yesterday
[1:25:10] today forever a Pentecostal branch
[1:25:13] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:25:14] signs and wonders of the Resurrection
[1:25:16] great things taking place yeah
[1:25:18] I'm sorry then they you know their God
[1:25:20] in the last station exploits yes we're
[1:25:23] at the end tire so see brother branham
[1:25:25] picks up Daniel 11:32 and applies it to
[1:25:29] the bride I'm just letting you know to
[1:25:32] me I feel I could be a definite apply to
[1:25:34] the product but we'd have to be battling
[1:25:37] the satanic spirit not in the form of
[1:25:40] the Antichrist we're just in our regular
[1:25:41] satanic battles you can say Satan you
[1:25:44] know the regular battles we have a Satan
[1:25:46] you know and maybe the maybe the squeeze
[1:25:47] maybe that's it maybe it could be the
[1:25:48] squeeze Oh Pam says this he said
[1:25:52] supernatural power with supernatural
[1:25:53] science or a supernatural belief in a
[1:25:55] supernatural word from a supernatural
[1:25:57] God amen you talk about super-move
[1:26:00] supernatural God is a supernatural body
[1:26:02] and the natural people getting
[1:26:03] supernatural signs hallelujah a super
[1:26:06] race they they that know their God shall
[1:26:08] do exploits great exploits and show
[1:26:11] supernatural signs of people Abraham's
[1:26:14] seed a sign of a supernatural Christ
[1:26:16] risen from the dead supernaturally all
[1:26:21] right I think I got the quote on there
[1:26:22] twice yeah per me okay now let me give
[1:26:26] you another abomination and daily
[1:26:28] sacrifice quote because that is verse 31
[1:26:32] then the Christ will take away the daily
[1:26:34] sacrifice here's another one and I'm
[1:26:36] almost done the most of my God's grace
[1:26:37] everything I'm trying to short my
[1:26:39] sermons a little bit here now notice the
[1:26:42] overspreading of the abomination to make
[1:26:44] Desilu desolation the overspreading of
[1:26:46] abominations what is the foundation
[1:26:47] filthiness see to make desolate what is
[1:26:50] that to do away with the overspreading
[1:26:53] of this to do away with that see the
[1:26:55] overspreading of that Roman power to
[1:26:57] conquer all the sleeping version virgins
[1:27:00] Jews evolved with all the enrollment or
[1:27:03] it'll be nothing he'll break his
[1:27:04] covenant in the middle of the week so
[1:27:08] that's what we're talking about here in
[1:27:09] verse 31 the breaking of the daily
[1:27:11] sacrifice Rome will stop the Jews from
[1:27:14] giving their daily sacrifice and it's
[1:27:17] the overspreading of the Roman power
[1:27:19] alright so season is the rolling pile of
[1:27:22] stopping the daily sacrifice that's an
[1:27:23] abomination right okay I got a few more
[1:27:28] quotes here to just bear with me then
[1:27:29] I'm down to let me just stop and check
[1:27:31] don't wear a video okay so one two three
[1:27:34] four five six seven
[1:27:36] you handle seven more okay do something
[1:27:39] more all right thank you now verses 36
[1:27:43] 245 the commentary I read believes all
[1:27:47] this is about the future Antichrist or
[1:27:50] Pope like I said I don't I can't find
[1:27:54] time about any quotes from brother
[1:27:56] Branham on these verses 36 all the way
[1:27:59] to 45 okay just so you know I'm Connie
[1:28:02] if you find someone that me not you
[1:28:04] happy reading but they seem to connect
[1:28:07] the second Thessalonians 2:1 to 13 we
[1:28:10] already read Lee versus four five and
[1:28:12] six in there because the verses 41 to 45
[1:28:18] scenery okay I'll give that later let's
[1:28:22] read verse 36 so let's go to Daniel
[1:28:24] 11:36 I don't have that up there but
[1:28:25] Daniel 11:36 is the one that connects to
[1:28:28] this right here I hope it's not
[1:28:32] confusing like I said I'm trying to make
[1:28:33] this as simple as possible there's only
[1:28:35] having a few quotes I'll have a few
[1:28:37] quotes the puppet I was talking about
[1:28:38] this chapter now verse 30 says Daniel
[1:28:42] 11:36 it's all like to read that for me
[1:28:44] okay thank you sir the King shall do
[1:28:49] according to as well and he showed Saul
[1:28:51] himself and magnify himself above every
[1:28:54] God and shall speak marvellous things
[1:28:57] against the God of gods and shall
[1:28:59] prosper till the indignation be
[1:29:01] accomplished for that is determined
[1:29:04] shall be done all right
[1:29:06] no I'm gonna use up here on the screen
[1:29:08] here we see that with the Bible say
[1:29:10] verse 36 he exalts himself and magnify
[1:29:13] himself above all gods
[1:29:15] doesn't that sound just like this let no
[1:29:19] man deceive you by any means for that
[1:29:21] nation outcome except there's a falling
[1:29:22] away of the church first and the man of
[1:29:25] sin be revealed the son of destruction
[1:29:27] gotta be the Antichrist who opposes and
[1:29:30] exalts see where sees the same word
[1:29:32] exalt
[1:29:32] exalts himself above all that is called
[1:29:35] God or that has to be worshipped so that
[1:29:37] he as God sitteth the temple of God
[1:29:39] showing himself that He is God
[1:29:42] so artists ain't one do anyone's exhaust
[1:29:44] himself above the
[1:29:45] got an early look at that last week and
[1:29:47] he wants to be worshipped so the
[1:29:49] Antichrist has to come to the Jewish
[1:29:50] temple take with his sacrifice
[1:29:53] he's got to exalt himself as God that's
[1:29:57] what the Bible says it's unjust oh I
[1:29:59] hope you understand I hope that's a
[1:30:00] blessing by God's grace I know we're
[1:30:02] dealing with no prophesying serveth all
[1:30:04] these things I don't have any clothes
[1:30:06] for so I'm just doing the best I can I
[1:30:07] actually look at verse 37 to 1137 are we
[1:30:11] dead Danny 1137 I appreciate your
[1:30:14] patience I know it's a tough thing to
[1:30:16] preach on there's not a lot of
[1:30:17] background knowledge on 1137 neither
[1:30:22] shall he regard the god of his father's
[1:30:24] nor the desire of women oh that's Christ
[1:30:26] Christ to the desired women because all
[1:30:29] the Jewish women wanted to see them
[1:30:30] aside all right a virgin shall conceive
[1:30:32] all the women one to see and who was
[1:30:34] that woman in Revelation 12 the woman
[1:30:36] that brought forth the manchild and rule
[1:30:38] the nations with a rod of iron that was
[1:30:40] Christ hey that's what the stake he
[1:30:42] tried to devour remember but he was
[1:30:44] carved to heaven in the God's throne
[1:30:46] today so Christ is the desired whipping
[1:30:48] all the women all the churches all the
[1:30:50] Jews they wanted Christ on the side to
[1:30:52] come to be resting so he won't regard
[1:30:55] Christ he won't regard the god of his
[1:30:57] father's nor regarded any God he shall
[1:30:59] magnify himself above all see that it's
[1:31:03] gotta be the Antichrist because that's
[1:31:05] what 2nd Thessalonians 2 said all right
[1:31:11] almost done
[1:31:13] 5 more sides there bear with me here I'm
[1:31:18] sorry now verses 40 to 45 these all seem
[1:31:24] to refer this is a really interesting
[1:31:26] portion of scripture if you have time I
[1:31:27] encourage you greeted it seems to be all
[1:31:29] about the invasion of the Antichrist
[1:31:32] into Israel now we already talked about
[1:31:35] that he comes the temple of God he takes
[1:31:37] my did a sacrifice but this actually
[1:31:39] gives literal scripture of the
[1:31:40] Antichrist coming in to Jerusalem it's
[1:31:43] pretty amazing especially verses 41 to
[1:31:48] 45 so let's read verse 40 so let me know
[1:31:50] you go there at 11:40 there's nobody's
[1:31:53] here you see at that time of the end you
[1:31:57] see then shall the King of the South
[1:31:59] I'm not sure at this point who the King
[1:32:00] of the South is I don't know it's going
[1:32:02] to be so many southern of Israel I gotta
[1:32:05] because North is Russia so he's up and
[1:32:08] the king of the north shall come against
[1:32:10] him like a woman I we believe that's
[1:32:11] Russia at this point with chariots with
[1:32:14] horsemen with many ships and he shall
[1:32:15] enter the the countries and shall
[1:32:17] overflow and pass over he shall enter
[1:32:22] also into the glorious land what land is
[1:32:24] glorious according to the Bible and
[1:32:25] according to an angel only Jerusalem
[1:32:28] only in Israel right well worth a visit
[1:32:33] and many countries shall be overthrown
[1:32:37] but these shall escape out of his hand
[1:32:40] even Edom Moab and the chief of the
[1:32:42] children of Ammon uh so I'm not sure
[1:32:43] where those are right now modern-day I
[1:32:47] don't know what modern-day countries
[1:32:48] those are but they boast that they don't
[1:32:50] escape the Antichrist he's to stretch
[1:32:52] forth his hand upon the countries and
[1:32:54] the land of Egypt shall not escape that
[1:32:56] makes me think
[1:32:57] Egypt might not be the king of the south
[1:32:58] at this point I don't know but he should
[1:33:00] have power over the treasures of gold
[1:33:02] and of silver and over all the precious
[1:33:04] things of Egypt and the Libyans and
[1:33:05] Ethiopians shukkeien is his steps did
[1:33:10] brother man I'm saying that the
[1:33:10] Antichrist alone will have all the rule
[1:33:12] of all the paper money and the gold and
[1:33:14] the bonds right verse 44 but tidings out
[1:33:21] of the east and out of the North shall
[1:33:22] trouble him
[1:33:23] therefore you should go aboard with
[1:33:25] great fury to destroy and utterly to
[1:33:27] make many of turn ship - to make away
[1:33:30] many here it is where's Mordecai and he
[1:33:33] shall plant the Tabernacles of his
[1:33:35] palace between the Seas in the glorious
[1:33:37] holy mountain
[1:33:38] what's the holy mountain Mount Sinai
[1:33:40] right
[1:33:42] that's where Jerusalem that's where the
[1:33:44] Dome of the rock is right now that's the
[1:33:46] holy mountain of God
[1:33:47] so here the Antichrist is Planet planta
[1:33:50] is kingdom right there in the Holy Land
[1:33:54] muhaha mercy yet he shall come to his
[1:33:57] head and none she'll help now
[1:34:03] again I'm just using quotes from an okay
[1:34:05] let's go west I got one two three five
[1:34:08] more quotes
[1:34:11] now Russia the king of the north is in
[1:34:14] Daniel 11 for he is part for her part
[1:34:17] and arm again I'm sorry okay so the king
[1:34:20] of the north at the end of the chapter
[1:34:21] of eleven has to be Russia because no
[1:34:24] map says thus saith the Lord the
[1:34:25] Russians King in the north
[1:34:27] now Daniel was given the assurance that
[1:34:29] at the end of the Gentile dispensation
[1:34:31] I'll read when you go home read tomorrow
[1:34:34] the 11th chapter you can see how the
[1:34:35] king of the north is coming down which
[1:34:36] is nothing else but Russia comes down
[1:34:40] against Jerusalem coming down to press
[1:34:42] against it like the world and we just
[1:34:43] read that and the great battle of
[1:34:46] Armageddon will be fought right there
[1:34:49] near the gates of Jerusalem because he
[1:34:50] said no camp
[1:34:51] it's the Antichrist from camp right not
[1:34:53] by the holy mountain of God look at that
[1:34:56] Church in the scripture and that
[1:34:58] beautiful to see that by God's grace
[1:35:00] ah I just just like the Bible is
[1:35:03] becoming more and more clear all the
[1:35:04] time amen
[1:35:05] this is not our thought it's a
[1:35:07] vindicating property everybody else you
[1:35:09] loves the Pope and so get their
[1:35:11] interpretations can't be right
[1:35:12] they don't have a property they don't
[1:35:13] have enough seats the Lord you've got it
[1:35:15] by God's pigs next quote now just a
[1:35:17] couple more for now this is from the
[1:35:20] church age book I think I preached on
[1:35:22] this the time already through the fourth
[1:35:25] church age for 3 and 1/2 years while the
[1:35:28] retributive wrath of God is poured out
[1:35:30] she will be in the great marriage supper
[1:35:33] then who is that we believe that sups
[1:35:35] the New Testament church then when then
[1:35:38] will he return leaving his bride in the
[1:35:40] father's house well he makes himself
[1:35:43] known to his brother at this very time
[1:35:46] the Antichrist covenant that the Jews
[1:35:47] have made with Rome will be broken roll
[1:35:51] and her allies then send their troops to
[1:35:53] destroy all the god-fearing word abiding
[1:35:56] Jews so we have the Antichrist camped
[1:35:59] out in Jerusalem and then the king of
[1:36:00] the north comes down to oh we're gonna
[1:36:04] top this church but as they come again
[1:36:07] the city what the Jewish City we just
[1:36:09] read it the holy city the glorious land
[1:36:12] right the holy mountain of God amen as
[1:36:15] they gonna get the city to destroy
[1:36:16] there will appear in the heavens the
[1:36:18] sign of the coming of the Son of Man and
[1:36:20] with his mighty armies to destroy that
[1:36:22] who have been destroying the earth
[1:36:25] with the enemy repulse Jesus then comes
[1:36:28] and presents himself to the 144,000
[1:36:30] having seen his mighty acts of salvation
[1:36:33] they have come to know his power but
[1:36:35] also seeing his wounds annoying that
[1:36:36] they have rejected him even at that
[1:36:38] moment he even to that moment rather
[1:36:40] causes them to cry out in having him to
[1:36:42] tear and feared even as did their
[1:36:44] brethren of old when they stood before
[1:36:46] Joseph being so afraid that they would
[1:36:48] be killed but as Joseph said don't be
[1:36:50] angry with yourselves it's all right God
[1:36:52] was in it all he did it to preserve life
[1:36:55] even so will Jesus speak peace and love
[1:36:58] to them a man not that by God's grace
[1:37:00] but man taught us Rome is coming to
[1:37:03] Israel so is Russia and the Bible says
[1:37:05] it as well let us say to our feet I got
[1:37:07] two more quotes never I got two we have
[1:37:11] 2000 Laura's on on Israel two of them -
[1:37:18] here's the first one and so what we
[1:37:21] talked about briefly but man tells us we
[1:37:23] have less a DeLorean Gabrus instruction
[1:37:25] and Daniel a confederation of church
[1:37:28] will consolidate them together and bring
[1:37:29] the Jews in this Confederation and bring
[1:37:32] them back to their own temple worship
[1:37:34] again in the thus saith the Lord on the
[1:37:36] Bible and they will have their own
[1:37:38] church see there's got to be a Jewish
[1:37:40] temple built on that Temple Mount
[1:37:42] it's got to be rebuilt and they've got a
[1:37:44] daily sacrifice because the Antichrist
[1:37:45] has to take away the daily sacrifice and
[1:37:47] overspread his abomination over that
[1:37:50] temple that's what the Bible said they
[1:37:54] are what now I just taught it just no
[1:37:55] fresh there now a nation recognizes that
[1:37:57] right but they have not their temple
[1:37:59] worship yet and when they establish the
[1:38:01] temple worship the church will be gone
[1:38:02] oh my god we do anything deal with the
[1:38:05] Jews as the nation here's the last quote
[1:38:08] so bear with me thank you for your
[1:38:09] patience tonight and then I think we
[1:38:11] should have some prayer forever they let
[1:38:12] me believe that I think we just maybe
[1:38:14] they had some pray ask God strength
[1:38:17] that's what I'd won if I was hurt like
[1:38:18] him I want something great for me so
[1:38:21] just let's get ready for that he was
[1:38:24] instruction again that's why I tried to
[1:38:25] tell this brother sitting over here
[1:38:26] let's talk about going to Israel stay
[1:38:28] away from Israel you said about Gentiles
[1:38:31] going to Israel try to win souls
[1:38:34] stay away from them are you people I
[1:38:36] talk about converting the Jews before
[1:38:38] this message
[1:38:39] you'll see it thus saith the lord by
[1:38:41] word and by spirit Israel be converted
[1:38:44] over the whole nation in one night the
[1:38:46] Bible said some of the Gospels not even
[1:38:48] today program said thus say the Lord
[1:38:51] stay away from there because they'll get
[1:38:52] changed when Jesus reveals themselves
[1:38:56] now I'm number this though - there's a
[1:38:59] few renegades that's out there and then
[1:39:04] that's out there like that
[1:39:06] and committed and outside the main body
[1:39:09] of Jews coming to get safe that's true
[1:39:11] but at least there's Jews that are not
[1:39:14] Israel that will get saved in the bride
[1:39:16] but we're not to take the gospel to the
[1:39:20] Jews because the two witnesses are there
[1:39:23] to do that
[1:39:23] God even saw brother Branham from doing
[1:39:25] that right so he says it's us
[1:39:29] doesn't know they're gonna rebuild that
[1:39:31] temple and the state the Lord stay away
[1:39:33] let God's two prophets and let Christ
[1:39:35] reveal himself reported four thousand
[1:39:38] members well as how other nation that
[1:39:40] cannot be saved okay let's stop right
[1:39:42] there the Lord and I need a Mac amen
[1:39:44] appreciate that
[1:39:45] now chapter 12 is real short it's only
[1:39:47] 13 verses I don't know if we'll get to
[1:39:49] that Sunday or next week but are you
[1:39:51] joined Daniel I just I got all the
[1:39:56] quotes so if I need to go back and
[1:39:58] review it or add something if you all if
[1:40:00] you've all Leslie you listen to it take
[1:40:02] you next week and you find the court I
[1:40:03] miss share with me we'll put it right in
[1:40:06] there the Lord tarries for the next
[1:40:08] generation praise God because that's
[1:40:10] what we're doing we're storing up well
[1:40:11] Graham said if Christ don't govern our
[1:40:13] day we're supposed to leave footprints
[1:40:15] on the sands of time for the next
[1:40:17] generation to follow crazy land I'm 36
[1:40:22] years old
[1:40:23] I might have 30 more years of reaching
[1:40:25] gospel if God terry's the end of God and
[1:40:28] it lets movie after that would be too
[1:40:29] old
[1:40:30] and if God carries that mob somebody
[1:40:33] else to preach the same revelation
[1:40:35] brother Branham preached to teach us the
[1:40:38] truth of God's Word and so what do we do
[1:40:41] is just throwing it up we're leaving the
[1:40:43] footprints perhaps in the Ramson I want
[1:40:45] to be a pastor he says God will raise up
[1:40:47] another pastor we got to leave these
[1:40:50] footprints in the sands of time
[1:40:51] aren't you glad amen I just trust God

[1:40:56] your attendance tonight by the grace of
[1:40:57] the board all right let's just sing a
