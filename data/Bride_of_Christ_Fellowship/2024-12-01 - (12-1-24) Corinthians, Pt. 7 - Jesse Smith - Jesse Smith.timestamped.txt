[3:15] in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints
[3:17] said amen God bless you as you being
[3:19] seated praise God good to see the Saints
[3:21] today you can switch over I do have a
[3:23] few uh scriptures there
[3:30] so we're looking at part seven here
[3:31] today um the book of First Corinthians I
[3:34] just remember brother random preached
[3:36] you know numerous series uh entire books
[3:38] of the Bible preach through job
[3:41] Revelation and uh Hebrews other books of
[3:43] the Bible he preached so uh we're making
[3:45] our way slowly through here and I just
[3:47] pray and meditate and as I study I just
[3:49] wait to see what the Lord would uh bring
[3:52] to my uh memory by God's grace and
[3:54] anything that would be revealed I just
[3:56] want to preach it by the grace of God so
[3:58] I want to start with this quote as was
[3:59] listening last night and this morning to
[4:01] uh I was listening again to this short
[4:02] it's a short Sunday school lesson
[4:04] brother Bram gives to the adults it's an
[4:06] adult Sunday school and he says we
[4:08] notice Paul Could Teach the Ephesians
[4:09] there how that before the foundation of
[4:11] world they were predestinated unto the
[4:14] adoption of the sons of God now don't
[4:17] you know that today Church you're
[4:19] predestinated to be adopted you're not
[4:22] to be a servant you're to be a son and
[4:24] daughter with
[4:25] authority Hallelujah just like uh my
[4:28] children Malachi Lydia Casa everybody
[4:30] they all have access to my fridge right
[4:32] they all have access to my vehicles you
[4:34] know they have the authority of being
[4:36] under me as a as a father right and
[4:39] that's what we got with God we have
[4:40] authority with God hallelujah we're so
[4:43] thankful that we're adopted we're not
[4:44] just servants or or or slaves or
[4:47] something like that we are uh the
[4:49] children of God adopted into the family
[4:52] with full rights of of the of the family
[4:55] of God hallelujah the Corinthians didn't
[4:57] know nothing about that so think about
[4:59] that they didn't all they knew was like
[5:00] the power the experiences of God they
[5:02] wanted to feel something they wanted to
[5:04] shout something they wanted to speak
[5:05] something they they just wanted to
[5:07] experience God but they didn't have the
[5:09] understanding of their relationship with
[5:11] God hallelujah he said they just had to
[5:15] have a little feeling if they didn't
[5:17] feel something at service if they didn't
[5:19] feel something in prayer they just felt
[5:20] discouraged and well look at the they
[5:22] started sulking around we're going to
[5:23] show that quote in a little bit they
[5:24] started feeling bad and they always had
[5:26] to have a feeling instead of the
[5:28] revelation of who they were Hallelujah
[5:32] now don't get me wrong there's times we
[5:34] need both Hallelujah well well I'm sorry
[5:35] there's times we need we all need the
[5:37] feeling right but what we should always
[5:39] have is the Revelation the understanding
[5:41] of God's love for
[5:43] us and God's constant presence see they
[5:45] just had to have a feeling a
[5:48] sensation they depended on that well if
[5:51] brother Jesse doesn't shout or dance or
[5:53] if sister doesn't scream if if brother
[5:55] doesn't cry at the altar then we didn't
[5:57] have church that's what they depended on
[5:59] on but look what it produced in their
[6:01] lives so much instability so much
[6:04] carnality amongst the the the the church
[6:06] the actual church right they depended on
[6:11] emotion and and feelings and Sensations
[6:14] and Paul couldn't teach them the Deep
[6:15] things of
[6:17] God so I think it's what I think it's
[6:20] great when you got people you can teach
[6:23] deep things and the Holy Spirit can wind
[6:26] these great truths and anchor in the
[6:28] people's heart so that whether they're
[6:32] standing right some people stand some
[6:34] people are laying on their faces you
[6:35] know spiritually speaking crawling just
[6:37] trying to get through life whether
[6:39] you're standing whether you're crawling
[6:40] where you're laying on your back whether
[6:43] that you have a sensation or no
[6:46] sensation prophecy or no prophecy I
[6:48] don't know what what's going to happen
[6:49] in the future I don't know it's okay if
[6:51] you don't know brother raham says
[6:53] whatever it might be now remember I'm
[6:55] not trying to say God does not deal
[6:56] through prophecy and things like that
[6:58] but we don't rely upon that we got a
[7:00] deeper hole than that you see hallelujah
[7:03] how many got a deeper hole than that
[7:05] today I thank God if he gives me a a
[7:08] dream or a prophecy or a word or a
[7:10] feeling or experience a a refilling
[7:13] people say but even if I don't get that
[7:15] I know where I stand with God hallelujah
[7:18] that's what Paul's saying here we got a
[7:20] deeper hold than that and then he said
[7:22] for whoever or whether they prophecies
[7:24] it'll fail tongues they'll cease course
[7:26] he's break it into 1 Corinthians 13 as
[7:28] we preach on two weeks ago by God's
[7:30] grace so I want I just want to start
[7:32] with that that it's a great thing when
[7:34] we can teach the Deep things of God
[7:37] because you've got to know there's going
[7:38] to come a time like I was telling the
[7:39] teenagers there's going to come a time
[7:40] you don't feel things or you don't feel
[7:42] excited anymore or you don't feel
[7:44] extremely happy or joyful and in those
[7:46] moments you have to know that the world
[7:48] can never satisfy any it never can
[7:50] satisfy your soul but God's testing you
[7:53] he's letting you go through a little
[7:54] Valley Hallelujah but the thing is he
[7:56] said I walk with you through the valley
[7:58] Hallelujah so you got to have that
[8:01] anchor you got to have that uh that love
[8:03] of God so that when you don't feel
[8:05] anything and it seems like God's far
[8:06] away you've got the Revelation he loves
[8:08] me anyway hallelujah amen he's just
[8:10] letting me go through a little trial a
[8:12] little test and I just thought you know
[8:14] I was going through these quotes
[8:15] yesterday I just thought I would uh give
[8:17] you a little machine gun here a uh
[8:19] little blessing here a little AR
[8:20] blessing here by God's grace just with
[8:22] some good quotes on uh this on the Bible
[8:25] how important the Bible is to us he said
[8:27] the scripture is all tied together how
[8:29] how the Bible means so much more than it
[8:32] speaks if we can only have the Holy
[8:34] Spirit to interpret it for us we only
[8:36] read it as we look down upon it but oh
[8:39] how the holy spirit says child of mine
[8:41] now listen when you're reading your
[8:42] Bible child of mine you're looking into
[8:45] my face now Church did you look into the
[8:48] face of God this
[8:50] morning Hallelujah I hope you if you
[8:53] didn't yet I hope you do it when you go
[8:54] home look into the face of God this is
[8:58] God's character this is is God's will
[9:00] Hallelujah right before us this is what
[9:03] I want you to know so see God's leading
[9:05] you to to a certain chapter right a
[9:08] certain book he wants you to read
[9:09] through so he can he can show you his
[9:12] character he can show you his fa face
[9:14] Hallelujah May the Holy Spirit take the
[9:16] word of God today and deliver it to
[9:18] every heart just as we have need and we
[9:20] may we Fellowship around the word now
[9:22] Inspire us we ask it in Jesus Christ's
[9:25] name amen so brother reads the Bible
[9:27] says if you look into this Bible and
[9:29] you'll ask God for something God will
[9:31] give you something today Hallelujah so
[9:35] but you know so often we're distracted
[9:36] to look away from the Bible but God's
[9:38] saying look in the Bible you'll see my
[9:41] face glory amen he says with the
[9:44] oncoming judgments the world is feeling
[9:46] it uh I've heard from the Pentagon you
[9:49] know all these fear tactics well there's
[9:50] only one book can direct you on what to
[9:52] do and that's God's
[9:54] Bible so see when there's all these news
[9:57] reports and all the uncertainty the
[9:59] there's one place you can look for good
[10:00] news that's the word of
[10:02] God that's the only thing that can tell
[10:04] you what to do see the news can't tell
[10:06] you what to
[10:07] do that's lift up your head look up
[10:09] there's no way of Escape right for the
[10:11] world from judgment but there is an
[10:13] escape through the Rapture Hallelujah I
[10:16] like this from God's eye at Calvary
[10:18] everything was finished he was wounded
[10:19] for our transgressions with his Tripes
[10:21] we were healed every sinner here today
[10:23] was saved when Jesus died at Calvary
[10:25] every sick person was healed when Jesus
[10:27] died he finished the work the only thing
[10:30] that God can do now is to anoint
[10:32] ministers to preach the word or set
[10:35] gifts in the church to point you to the
[10:37] finished work of our Lord Jesus
[10:40] Hallelujah see it's already finished
[10:42] Jesus already paid the price for every
[10:44] Redemptive blessing and that's what we
[10:46] need we need God to anoint us God to
[10:48] anoint our preachers God to anoint the
[10:50] gifts in our life to point us to what
[10:52] Christ has already done for us to remind
[10:54] us of the power of the Cross Hallelujah
[10:57] Mich shall saying amen that's right
[10:59] buddy amen
[11:00] hallelujah be not afraid he says oh in
[11:03] that time of Crisis the Revival was over
[11:05] the boat was water loged remember when
[11:07] Jesus was on on the sea everything
[11:09] looked like was gone all hopes was gone
[11:11] but there he was walking on the sea and
[11:14] the strange part about it the only thing
[11:16] that could help them they was afraid of
[11:18] it it looked spooky like remember when
[11:20] Jesus was walking to them and they
[11:21] didn't know what what if it was a spirit
[11:23] or what it was and they cried out for
[11:25] fear that's the same thing today the
[11:27] only thing that can save us is the Bible
[11:31] God's promise and the Holy Spirit with
[11:34] us hallelujah see the devil wants us to
[11:36] get so busy we don't go and and and we
[11:38] we get afraid to we we don't have enough
[11:40] time or we don't have enough time to
[11:42] spend with God but brother R saying
[11:44] Jesus is something that we should run to
[11:46] Hal let's not be afraid of him let's
[11:48] let's remember he's our father he's our
[11:50] friend Hallelujah and so when things are
[11:53] in trouble run to the father Hallelujah
[11:55] run to Jesus he's got all of our answers
[11:57] the Bible has all of our answers
[11:59] Hallelujah it looks spooky to people and
[12:01] they cry out for fear but here come that
[12:03] sweet calm voice be not afraid it is
[12:06] I Be not Afraid church God is speaking
[12:09] through his
[12:11] word the only thing that I know to point
[12:14] man to not a Creed or a sensation of
[12:16] some sort but to those bloody footprints
[12:18] that leads to the Bible the blood of
[12:20] Jesus Christ so if brother R was here
[12:23] people said oh if just brother Ram was
[12:24] here well if he's here he'd point you
[12:26] right to the word that he was preaching
[12:27] Hallelujah so as if is as if he's here
[12:31] because we know what he would say we got
[12:32] it on the tapes
[12:34] Hallelujah the absolute oh my notice
[12:37] your absolute oh I'm going to say
[12:38] something I just feel it coming on
[12:40] notice I feel very religious at this
[12:42] time because this is Assurance so when
[12:44] did Brother feel the happiest when God
[12:46] gave him Assurance of God's character of
[12:49] God's presence your compass can only
[12:52] point to the north star that's the only
[12:54] place it can point to if it's a true
[12:56] Compass it'll strike the North Star
[12:58] every time is that right then if you
[13:00] have the Holy Spirit it can only point
[13:02] to the word it'll never point to
[13:04] denomination it'll never point to a
[13:05] Creed it'll never point it away
[13:08] somewhere It'll point straight to the
[13:10] word I feel like shouting
[13:13] Hallelujah so if you got the Holy Ghost
[13:15] where is it going to point you here
[13:17] right here here constantly back to the
[13:20] word back to the scriptures God will
[13:22] direct you God will feed you God will
[13:24] show you his face as you seek his face
[13:27] Hallelujah notice it's something inside
[13:29] of a man pulsating when you see your
[13:32] star setting out yonder Jesus Christ the
[13:34] word and you see the spirit that's in
[13:36] you won't let you move right or left
[13:39] that's the only one that can he come to
[13:41] take the things of God and show them
[13:43] manifest them that Compass Holy Spirit
[13:47] put him right on the North Star now if
[13:48] You' got something pulling you off it
[13:49] you better leave it
[13:51] alone the sun it'll only point to his
[13:54] word only Point only to his word because
[13:57] the Holy Spirit came to manifest or
[13:59] vindicate God's promise so we we think
[14:02] you know we pray to Jesus and where
[14:03] would he point us he's going to point us
[14:05] find your answer in the word there's
[14:07] safety in the word there's protection in
[14:09] the word there's Grace in the word
[14:11] there's leadership in the word of God
[14:15] hallelujah if you take him as your North
[14:18] Star then that absolutely places the
[14:19] Holy Spirit as your compass amen the
[14:22] holy spirit is your compass and the
[14:23] compass will only point to the north
[14:24] star and if you've got the baptism of
[14:27] the Holy Ghost it can only point to
[14:29] Christ and Christ is that
[14:32] word how many more I got of these I got
[14:34] I sure got a lot here he says the Holy
[14:36] Spirit points only to the word man
[14:38] should not live by bread alone but by
[14:40] every word not part of the word but
[14:42] every word all of it every word that
[14:45] proceeds out of the mouth of God that's
[14:46] what a man lives by he's your absolute
[14:48] in your life he's also your North
[14:53] Star
[14:55] Hallelujah and I like this one I think
[14:57] this might be one of my I got a couple
[14:58] yeah I got two more
[15:00] I like I heard found this one yesterday
[15:01] I forgot he said this the word living
[15:04] and in action the Bible
[15:08] bride Hallelujah so how can these people
[15:10] say they're the the bride when they deny
[15:12] the Bible the bride will be one with the
[15:16] Bible because she sees her husband's
[15:18] face in the Bible Hallelujah that's
[15:20] right church not some man-made bride
[15:23] like anybody can call themselves The
[15:24] Bride but the real bride will have her
[15:26] face in the Bible she's pointed to her
[15:29] North Star the Bible
[15:32] Hallelujah so when I thought of that
[15:33] thing a thinking man's filter I thought
[15:35] that's a good idea so there is a
[15:37] thinking man's filter that's this Bible
[15:41] so see everything we hear we got to
[15:42] filter it so I'll just put up your phone
[15:43] here everything we see from the Bible
[15:45] I'm sorry from our phone or wherever we
[15:47] are whatever whatever we're getting
[15:48] input from it's got to come through the
[15:50] filter of God's word
[15:53] hallelujah a thinking man's filter will
[15:55] take this filter it'll produce a
[15:58] righteous man
[15:59] taste Hallelujah now you cannot pull sin
[16:03] through the pages of the Bible so see if
[16:05] you got sin in your life you're not uh
[16:07] your you got you took your filter out
[16:09] you got to put the filter back in
[16:13] hallelujah amen you can't pull sin
[16:16] through the page of the Bible no it
[16:18] stops IT the Bible filters sin out of
[16:21] your
[16:21] life now you can go to church and just
[16:24] take anything but you can't come through
[16:25] this Bible and have sin it will not do
[16:28] it it filters out without a everybody
[16:29] say a sin and it gives a holy man's
[16:33] taste Hallelujah so see you'll see
[16:35] yourself constantly loving the things of
[16:37] God as you stay in the Bible as you stay
[16:39] in the
[16:40] scripture because if a man is thinking
[16:43] that he wants to be holy and be like God
[16:45] be a son or daughter of God then he
[16:46] wants the right kind of filter so he
[16:49] stops all sin on this side of the Bible
[16:51] and he can only bring the Holy Spirit
[16:54] Through the Bible That's wrote the Bible
[16:56] it's a holy man's taste to have this
[16:59] thinking man's filter Hallelujah I just
[17:02] want want to remind you there are quotes
[17:04] where brother R says the fruit of the
[17:05] spirit is the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[17:07] I know later on he says it's receiving
[17:09] your the word for your day but the word
[17:11] for our day includes the fruits of the
[17:13] spirit Allelujah that's where some
[17:16] people fail they say no it's just
[17:17] receiving the word for your day but what
[17:19] is the word isn't Galatians 5 the word
[17:20] for your day Hallelujah of course it is
[17:24] so just be encouraged there's only one
[17:26] thing that's left in the Bible as
[17:28] evidence of the Holy ghost only the
[17:29] fruits of the spirit find out any place
[17:31] that Jesus said so yes sir the evidence
[17:33] of the Holy Ghost is the fruit of your
[17:36] spirit Jesus said so by their fruits you
[17:38] shall know them and the fruit of the
[17:40] spirit is love joy peace longsuffering
[17:42] goodness gentleness meekness and the
[17:44] fruit of the enemy is enmity hatred Mal
[17:46] and strife and so forth that's the fruit
[17:48] of the enemy so you can judge by the way
[17:50] you're living where you're standing with
[17:53] him if your whole heart is in love with
[17:55] him and you love him and are gentle and
[17:57] live with him daily you know your pass
[17:59] from Death unto life Hallelujah if it
[18:01] isn't and you're otherwise you're just
[18:03] impersonating a Christian that's right
[18:04] which all all carnal impersonations will
[18:07] certainly be exposed we know that I'm
[18:09] going to show you something
[18:10] today then on a Wednesday night don't
[18:12] you don't want to miss Wednesday night
[18:13] service if you possibly can because look
[18:15] what brother B gave us on a Wednesday
[18:17] night always don't judge your life by
[18:19] how much power you have for to perform
[18:21] Miracles because uh uh many people did
[18:25] Caiaphas prophesied right what's the one
[18:27] I'm thinking of balum bam had great
[18:29] prophecies
[18:31] power and we don't judge oursel by how
[18:34] much knowledge you have of the word so
[18:35] it's not even just the understanding
[18:37] about it but always judge yourself look
[18:39] back and take an inventory what kind of
[18:42] fruit is the life that you're presently
[18:44] now is bearing take inventory of the
[18:47] fruits of the spirit
[18:50] Hallelujah now let's go back to First
[18:51] Corinthians now so that was my
[18:53] introduction there hope you got a good
[18:54] refresher on the importance of the Bible
[18:56] amen now I know it you know it but it's
[18:58] it's nice to hear a prophet of God say
[19:00] it
[19:01] too now I want to get back to this this
[19:03] is the point I I was laboring a little
[19:05] bit on Wednesday for good purpose I
[19:08] think because our visitor it was helpful
[19:09] for our visitor also to hear that but
[19:11] also for us to remember that too anyone
[19:14] who's causing strife division or
[19:15] contention they're a baby in
[19:18] Christ
[19:21] right I gave that example of uh I think
[19:24] I gave it on a Sunday night uh there
[19:26] were certain individuals going around uh
[19:28] to the to the church uh asking opinions
[19:30] about things and then all of a sudden
[19:32] they come to a certain individual in the
[19:33] church and the church said no let's just
[19:35] stop it uh we're not going to we're not
[19:38] going to take opinions on that and I'm
[19:39] just giving a general story and it
[19:42] stopped the complaining right then and
[19:44] there that's maturity that's a fruit of
[19:47] the Holy
[19:48] Spirit
[19:50] Hallelujah that's right so see uh 1
[19:54] Corinthians 3:1 and verse three Paul
[19:57] says there was divisions there arguing
[19:59] well I'm of Apollos I'm a Peter I'm of
[20:01] I'm a Paul I'm just of Christ right that
[20:03] was chapter one I don't need any
[20:05] preachers I just follow
[20:07] Jesus but see babies in Christ they're
[20:10] constantly jealous of others and they
[20:13] they start
[20:14] rivalries other words they're trying to
[20:15] be better than that person or get more
[20:17] attention or trying to bring that person
[20:20] down right and then Strife is contention
[20:23] or debate trying to be smarter than
[20:26] somebody or trying to get one up on
[20:28] somebody
[20:29] well I'm just a little smarter I got a
[20:30] little more Revelation on this when it's
[20:32] not Revelation it's
[20:36] dissension or divisions right
[20:38] dissensions dividing uh certain people
[20:41] not treating everybody the same we
[20:43] should all have the love of God for one
[20:44] another
[20:45] hallelujah amen now this is what I I was
[20:48] I was studying on this and I I just I
[20:50] wanted to to show this and I want to
[20:53] bring this as a
[20:55] balance because I'm going to show you
[20:57] brother Bram said he was already a holy
[20:59] ghost filed Prophet brother Ram said he
[21:01] he sinned and God rebuked him and he
[21:03] pouted about it for a few
[21:05] weeks pouting like a baby
[21:09] complaining so I'm just going to show
[21:11] this what happens so what I'm saying is
[21:13] that sometimes we act like babies in our
[21:15] human spirits but our souls can be born
[21:17] again now in the case of Corin Corinth
[21:20] looks like most of them weren't born
[21:21] again that's what it looks like because
[21:22] there's so much sin in the church but I
[21:25] want to encourage you though too even a
[21:27] holy ghost filled person can sometimes
[21:29] pout around and be
[21:32] sulky Hallelujah there's only two sulk
[21:35] quotes in the whole message so I thought
[21:36] well this is
[21:37] perfect see so the word so what does
[21:41] sulk
[21:42] mean uh you're Moody silent you ever you
[21:46] ever be around you know sometimes every
[21:47] people are real joyful but then
[21:49] sometimes they're just so quiet like how
[21:51] come we're not how come I'm not saying
[21:53] amen like I usually do am how come I'm
[21:56] not smiling and I'm how come I'm so
[21:58] quiet like I I I I shouldn't I'm
[22:01] normally not quiet like this you ever
[22:04] noticed that some people used to be
[22:06] dancing or shouting around and pretty
[22:08] soon then they're all sulky and
[22:11] quiet that's
[22:13] immaturity right now I'm not saying
[22:16] every service we got to be shouting and
[22:18] dancing and screaming and spitting all
[22:19] over the place like me and I'm not even
[22:22] like that any every service either know
[22:24] we all go through trials we all go
[22:25] through tests but I'm showing you the
[22:28] Bible ible says sometimes we act like
[22:31] babies right sometimes we act immature
[22:34] but God's going to help us to overcome
[22:36] it by God's grace so see moodily silent
[22:39] some people act Moody and they get quiet
[22:42] on
[22:43] God right brother Bram tells us this oh
[22:46] but brother bradam I spoke with tongues
[22:48] I shouted I spoke I prophesied that
[22:50] don't make any difference what you've
[22:51] done many will come to me and say Lord
[22:53] Lord have I not done this and that but
[22:54] right down the depths of your heart has
[22:56] all the world died
[22:59] and Christ just took over now something
[23:01] just moves you every day in
[23:04] Love no matter how things come you're
[23:07] still in love the skies are blue always
[23:09] to you that's a good
[23:11] rhyme no matter what happens God is on
[23:13] the throne he's answering prayer working
[23:16] everything for
[23:18] you that'll make you happy when you
[23:20] realize God's working everything for my
[23:22] good Hallelujah may not be comfortable
[23:24] but it's working out for my good
[23:29] neighbors talk about you somebody
[23:31] ridicules you or the church tell you you
[23:34] have to do this or that and you don't
[23:35] want to do it but do you just but you
[23:38] just pick up your cross with a sweet
[23:40] smile and go on towards
[23:44] Calvary my neighbor said that oh I'm
[23:46] going to get that back I'm just still
[23:48] going to smile and love them well praise
[23:50] God this is my cross I just got to bear
[23:52] this cross God help me Lord if you took
[23:54] up a cross surely I can take up a cross
[23:57] because greater is he that that's in me
[23:59] than he that's in the world
[24:01] hallelujah
[24:02] hallelujah or do you stand off and soak
[24:05] now how many times have we seen that
[24:08] people don't get what they want so they
[24:10] sulk around they're just Moody silent oh
[24:13] I seen a lot is a preacher Hallelujah
[24:16] people that one day shouting and uh
[24:18] rejoicing next service don't even look
[24:21] at me don't even sing don't can't even
[24:23] raise their hands what's wrong
[24:25] something's wrong with that church
[24:29] Hallelujah but brother says see or when
[24:31] when you get trials do you Suk Moody
[24:34] quiet and say I'm not going back anymore
[24:37] I'm through with that old bunch of
[24:38] people
[24:39] anyhow that that's the spirit in you
[24:42] that isn't the holy spirit amen
[24:45] hallelujah will you raise your hand and
[24:47] say God right in the spirit that I have
[24:49] my new spirit give me your Holy Spirit
[24:52] make me live a Victorious
[24:55] life so see a Victorious Life is someone
[24:58] that won't be silent they won't get
[24:59] moody they won't they won't deny God
[25:02] praise because he's worthy of Praise
[25:05] he's with me on the Mountaintop he's
[25:06] with me in the valley he's with me all
[25:08] the time he said he never forsake me so
[25:10] that means everything's going to work
[25:12] out
[25:13] hallelujah it's all eventually going to
[25:15] work out praise God he's never going to
[25:17] leave me praise God he won't leave me
[25:20] and let me be lost and let me go to hell
[25:21] no sir he'll never leave me he'll never
[25:24] forsake me I'm already saved
[25:26] amen hallelujah
[25:31] make me live a Victorious
[25:33] Life what does brother R say a lot of
[25:35] times people get suky moodily silent and
[25:38] church don't feel bad sometimes it
[25:40] happened to brother Ram
[25:41] too remember God healed remember uh uh
[25:46] God saved that woman who had almost
[25:48] drowned uh no God healed her uh yeah God
[25:52] God saved the woman that almost drowned
[25:53] she got saved she got healed uh brother
[25:57] was rejoicing but then she died died
[25:58] right after she got
[25:59] saved and brother bam said I don't know
[26:01] what caused me to do it but I said Lord
[26:03] God you owe me an understanding see
[26:06] after me going out there and telling
[26:07] that husband and him coming to the oh
[26:09] yeah God even saved her husband and him
[26:10] coming to the Lord after You' done these
[26:12] things and all that then take that
[26:13] girl's life that mother's life I said
[26:15] you owe me an understanding well when
[26:18] you tell God something like that he'll
[26:19] leave you sitting
[26:22] alone I he he don't owe me nothing I'm
[26:25] in debt to him well he just let me
[26:28] pouted out for a few days you know
[26:31] anybody ever felt sorry for themselves
[26:33] for a few days it's called self-pity if
[26:35] you don't know what it's called you feel
[26:37] sorry oh my life's so hard and this
[26:39] person did that to me this person did
[26:41] this to me my life's not going the way I
[26:43] wanted and we pout around like a
[26:47] baby right
[26:49] Hallelujah right and so see even a
[26:52] mature Holy Ghost philled Christian
[26:54] sometimes can get that way now they're
[26:56] not going to stay that way
[26:59] but they can go through that for uh a
[27:01] few
[27:02] days a few days what you owe me this God
[27:07] you why don't I have this in my life you
[27:08] I deserve this I should have this
[27:10] already God what's wrong with you
[27:12] nothing's wrong with God something's
[27:13] wrong with us
[27:15] hallelujah and after about three or four
[27:17] months one day I was out in the creek
[27:19] bank and the Lord told me a vision said
[27:21] now go to her mother and say this to her
[27:23] mother did not the time come that year
[27:25] before that when she was drown in the
[27:27] creek on a picnic you she should have
[27:29] went and died at that time right but I
[27:31] had to take her when she was when she
[27:32] was ready to go after she got saved
[27:35] Hallelujah so I just want to show you
[27:36] that you know sometimes we just Place
[27:37] babies that oh they just got baptized
[27:39] they're still living in sin but I also
[27:41] want to show you sometimes even mature
[27:43] Christians can act like babies sometimes
[27:45] but what is God faithful to do God is
[27:47] faithful to bring us out of it to
[27:50] correct us help us to be more
[27:52] mature
[27:54] Hallelujah that's right that's right so
[27:57] God help us we don't want to be uh suky
[28:00] because David said I he said instead of
[28:02] being sulky David said I'm going to cry
[28:04] out to God he's my
[28:06] rock and he says be not silent to me
[28:09] less if thou be silent to me I become
[28:10] like them that go down to the pit hear
[28:12] the voice of thy supplications when I
[28:13] cry unto thee when I lift my hands
[28:15] toward thy holy Oracle so when things
[28:17] weren't going David's way he didn't sit
[28:18] there and just pout I'm not going to say
[28:20] Amen I'm not going to pray David said
[28:22] Lord hear my prayer
[28:24] Hallelujah I need to hear from
[28:26] you see we don't don't want to be silent
[28:29] Moody silent or soaking around babying
[28:32] around Hallelujah he says it again here
[28:35] oh Lord and have mercy on me Lord be
[28:37] thou my helper thou has turned for me my
[28:39] mour into dancing oh let's have Victory
[28:42] hallelujah amen let's have an assurance
[28:44] let's we know God gives us a promise
[28:47] we'll get back to the same season that
[28:49] we were in kaisha said as we walked in
[28:51] today why did why did God allow winter
[28:53] that's a good question but if we didn't
[28:55] have winter we wouldn't enjoy summer
[28:57] amen all right it's the law of contrast
[28:59] and wean I know she was joking I'm
[29:01] joking too but see we got to have these
[29:04] we got to go through diff the season
[29:06] will come around we'll have another
[29:08] season of Joy we'll have another season
[29:10] of Dancing
[29:12] Hallelujah thou has put off my sackcloth
[29:14] and GED me with gladness God has done it
[29:17] God will help you take off your your
[29:18] mourner clothes and and your your poutin
[29:21] God will help you put that and I help
[29:22] you put on some clothes some garments of
[29:25] praise to the end that my glory may sing
[29:28] praise unto thee and not be silent so
[29:30] what is the end of this what is God's
[29:32] goal God's goal is so that you will be
[29:34] loudly giving him praise you'll be
[29:36] thankful you'll be careful to worship
[29:37] him and give him
[29:39] praise that's the whole goal of this God
[29:41] wants a worshipper who's who doesn't
[29:43] want to be silent doesn't want to be
[29:44] selfish but they want to give a
[29:46] sacrifice of
[29:47] praise oh Lord my God I will give thanks
[29:50] unto thee forever
[29:52] hallelujah oh
[29:56] my now let's keep going here we went
[29:58] through verses 1-8 on Wednesday for we
[30:02] are laborers together with God ye are
[30:04] God's husbandry God's
[30:07] Building so of course husbandry uh would
[30:09] be like the orchard right uh God planted
[30:12] you in a certain Orchard God planted you
[30:14] in the orchard of akan Hallelujah now
[30:18] sometimes he uproots you right sometimes
[30:19] he takes you from Texas to akan right
[30:22] but God can do that God can transplant
[30:24] right but you're still God's Orchard now
[30:27] if he's if you're Orchard he's going to
[30:28] prune you
[30:29] too why so you'll be more fruitful
[30:32] Hallelujah so you can see more
[30:34] testimonies in your life you can see the
[30:36] grace of God working in your life and
[30:38] others can see it because it's a fruit
[30:40] that everybody can see you're God's
[30:43] Building we preach that a few weeks ago
[30:45] about the four corners of the building
[30:47] God's Building a building you're you're
[30:49] part of a you're part of Ephesus right
[30:51] you're you're part of a structure
[30:53] Hallelujah you're not alone in this
[30:55] you're a part of the building we're all
[30:57] part of this together
[30:59] hallelujah hallelujah and we are all a
[31:01] dwelling place we are all a habitation
[31:03] for God's
[31:05] spirit that's right but he says we work
[31:09] together with God remember they were
[31:11] they were magnifying the preacher so
[31:13] basically the only the preachers are
[31:14] working for God no everybody's working
[31:16] for God that's
[31:19] right now for preachers it's easiest to
[31:21] see it sometimes because uh here right
[31:24] after the resurrection after that the
[31:26] Lord spoken unto them he was received up
[31:28] into heaven and sat on the right hand of
[31:30] God and they went forth and they
[31:32] preached everywhere the Lord working
[31:34] with them and confirming the word with
[31:36] signs following amen so we see both
[31:39] spots God works with the individual if
[31:42] we'll do what God Said God will work
[31:44] through us and this works not just for
[31:47] preachers this works for everybody
[31:49] Hallelujah yes if you do what God says
[31:53] if you seek him first he said I'll give
[31:55] you everything you need
[31:59] Glory so see this is one of the uh
[32:02] greatest privileges that we can have as
[32:03] preachers or Christians if we do what
[32:06] God says God comes right back and
[32:08] vindicates and confirms what we've done
[32:11] that it was not a work of ourselves but
[32:13] it was the work of the plan of God the
[32:16] mind of God hallelujah remember Paul and
[32:20] Paulo said we're waterers we're Planters
[32:23] God has to give the
[32:25] increase Hallelujah so we got do our
[32:28] part Church whether it's our part to to
[32:30] water our our our part to plant we must
[32:33] all do our part God's working in every
[32:35] one of our lives and if you want to see
[32:37] more of it just keep investing in it
[32:39] Hallelujah just stay faithful just keep
[32:41] working in the vineyard Hallelujah just
[32:43] keep doing your part just stay in your
[32:45] part of the building of God
[32:49] hallelujah verse
[32:51] 10 according to the grace of God which
[32:54] is given unto me as a wise master
[32:56] builder I've laid the foundation and
[32:59] another man buth thereon but let every
[33:03] man take heed how he buildeth
[33:06] thereon now this scripture reminded me
[33:08] of 1 Corinthians 15:10 by the grace of
[33:11] God I am what I am and his grace was
[33:14] which was bestowed upon me was not in
[33:16] vain but I labored more abundantly than
[33:19] they all yet not I but the grace of God
[33:22] which was with me Hallelujah so Paul
[33:26] knew all his labors were Possible only
[33:28] through Grace which is God's Good Will
[33:32] God's loving kindness God's favor
[33:35] Hallelujah see so Paul knew anything in
[33:38] my life it's God's favor on my life
[33:40] first of all because God predestinated
[33:42] me God called me right and then after
[33:46] that then I yield myself to God I learn
[33:48] how to dedicate myself unto God and then
[33:51] God uses my humble efforts and God
[33:54] blesses it because he has good will I
[33:56] have his favor in my life Hallelujah so
[34:00] that's what I want you to see today
[34:01] church God has given you his Good Will
[34:04] God's for you for good God wants to do
[34:07] good things in your life but we must be
[34:09] faithful to God
[34:11] hallelujah like like like he says here
[34:13] we must not have division envying Strife
[34:16] uh suing you know we might can't have
[34:18] all these things debates and dissensions
[34:20] sexual IM morality drunkenness at the
[34:22] Lord's table you know basically cheating
[34:25] on the Lord and secret sins and all
[34:27] kinds of things like like that that has
[34:28] to be out of our lives and then God's
[34:30] grace is effective in our life all right
[34:33] so see that now I just thought it'd be
[34:34] interesting
[34:35] here you know you look at this and then
[34:38] he says no for other Foundation can no
[34:41] man lay than that which is laid which is
[34:44] Jesus Christ so think about that every
[34:47] preacher builds upon Paul's Foundation
[34:50] whether good or bad and there's only one
[34:54] Foundation think about that today I'm
[34:57] building on the foundation Paul laid
[35:01] every preacher out there is preaching uh
[35:03] they're they're building something like
[35:05] brother man calls in a pyramid right and
[35:06] he kind of gives the the last Church
[35:08] ages kind of like where the the The
[35:10] Headstone will come down and and it's
[35:11] got to fit perfectly in other words the
[35:13] church age Ministry must be just like
[35:15] Christ's Ministry and we're building up
[35:17] to
[35:19] that church do you see your life
[35:21] becoming more like Christ that's the
[35:24] that's the question we should be asking
[35:26] ourselves today is my life becoming more
[35:29] like
[35:30] Christ
[35:31] Hallelujah every preacher is building on
[35:33] Paul's Foundation Hallelujah now I
[35:36] thought it'd be good to go back over
[35:37] this it's been a couple years since I
[35:38] preached this but remember uh Solomon
[35:41] foreshadowed Paul's Ministry in the Old
[35:43] Testament Church
[35:45] ages because now we have three types of
[35:47] the church ages in the Old Testament we
[35:49] have Moses's golden
[35:52] candlesticks right that type the church
[35:54] ages we see that in Revelation chapter 1
[35:55] and 2 and three we have Joshua's seven
[35:58] chapter book in Joshua 18- 19 that type
[36:01] the church ages because it's a book
[36:03] about seven tribes
[36:05] Hallelujah right before Joshua goes off
[36:08] the scene right before brother Ram died
[36:09] it's a very beautiful type there and now
[36:11] we have the Kings of Israel that's the
[36:13] new one the Kings of Israel were a
[36:16] foreshadow of the church ages Hallelujah
[36:20] so what does it remind us we must be
[36:22] Kings and Priests unto God you're ruling
[36:25] over your life how many you understand
[36:27] that amen I'm not ruling over your life
[36:30] nobody can make your life good or bad
[36:31] you're ruling over it it's your house
[36:34] Jesus said in Matthew 12 it's you you're
[36:37] the one who opens the doors to good or
[36:39] opens the doors to bad don't open your
[36:42] doors to bad Shut the devil out of your
[36:44] life
[36:45] Hallelujah you're ruling you've got the
[36:48] final say in your life Hallelujah right
[36:50] as far as what God or what you allow God
[36:52] to do or what you allow the enemy to do
[36:55] it's a beautiful type of the church ages
[36:57] hallelujah amen and I love that uh the
[37:02] candlesticks were the light right they
[37:04] were the light in the Holy place and
[37:06] Jesus said the church is the light of
[37:07] the world oh Hallelujah Church your
[37:11] lives are the light of the world the
[37:13] world isn't going to see light except
[37:15] through you so let your light so shine
[37:18] that the men will see your good works
[37:20] and glorify Our God which is in
[37:23] heaven
[37:26] Hallelujah I'm not going to going to go
[37:27] through all this but remember you can
[37:29] here's where I saw in Kevin Uh Kevin
[37:32] Connor's book I saw that cam gave me
[37:34] that book it was such a Beau he and I
[37:36] were talking about that on the phone no
[37:37] we were talking about that when he was
[37:38] here what a blessing that book was but
[37:40] the Old Testament Church ages is a
[37:42] thousand years the New Testament Church
[37:44] AG is about 2,000 years so you can see
[37:47] that and then the last one of course the
[37:50] the last age is the
[37:52] shortest right so the last Church age of
[37:54] the Old Testament Was Elijah John the
[37:56] Baptist the shortest right the last
[37:59] church now the last Church age isn't the
[38:00] shortest according to those dates right
[38:02] now because this is now we're at 118
[38:05] years in leoda Ephesus Church age was
[38:07] 117 but the point is it's supposed to be
[38:10] a short Church age Hallelujah that's the
[38:12] point we're trying to make there now I
[38:14] saw a a a true parallel between four out
[38:18] of these seven Kings and how they relate
[38:21] to the the uh the seven Church age
[38:23] Messengers there's a clear correlation
[38:26] between at least four of them and so
[38:29] remember Paul was the New Testament
[38:31] Church age messenger he wrote two-thirds
[38:33] of the New Testament and his message is
[38:35] Jesus sees our labor and patience and
[38:38] he's warning we must return to the first
[38:40] love right so Paul wrote part of the
[38:43] Bible didn't Solomon write the Bible he
[38:45] wrote Proverbs Ecclesiastes and Song of
[38:49] Solomon and um uh Solomon's message is
[38:52] if you walk before God he'll establish
[38:54] David's Throne if you turn away he'll
[38:57] pluck you out of the land Hallelujah so
[39:01] very similar messages in other words
[39:03] Jesus said if you don't get back to your
[39:04] first love then I'll pluck you out right
[39:08] same thing with Solomon stay with your
[39:10] first love or I'll pluck you out of the
[39:12] land I'll take away my anointing from
[39:14] you
[39:17] Hallelujah and then their messages are
[39:19] exactly the same I'm not going to take
[39:20] all the time through this but it's just
[39:23] amazing the message to the Ephesian
[39:25] Church age Paul preached so much of this
[39:28] in Titus in Romans in Thessalonians
[39:31] Galatians uh Titus Romans 2 Corinthians
[39:34] Galatians and Ephesians jesus' message
[39:36] to the Ephesian Church age was preached
[39:38] by Paul hallelujah it's a beautiful type
[39:42] there how Paul was the first church age
[39:44] messenger you find it in second
[39:46] Corinthians uh lot lots and that's where
[39:48] we're heading to by God's grace after 1
[39:49] Corinthians we'll go to Second
[39:50] Corinthians Lord willing so it's amazing
[39:53] to see how there's such a parallel
[39:55] between Paul's preaching and the message
[39:57] Jesus gave to the Ephesian Church age
[40:00] it's a total parallel
[40:02] Hallelujah and then I I Love Song of
[40:05] Solomon uh s Song of Solomon said my
[40:07] Dove my undefiled is but one she's the
[40:10] only one of her mother she's the choice
[40:13] of one of her that bear her the daughter
[40:16] saw her and blessed her yay the queens
[40:18] and the concubines they praised her for
[40:21] it came to pass when Solomon was old
[40:23] that his wives turned away his heart
[40:25] from other gods and his heart was not at
[40:27] was not perfect with the Lord is God as
[40:30] was the heart of David his father so
[40:32] Solomon went from from one wife to a
[40:35] thousand see he started out on fire with
[40:38] just his first love and and he had the
[40:41] god-given wisdom of God but he fell away
[40:43] he left his first love and so his heart
[40:46] was turned away how many want to keep
[40:48] their first love we just heard it
[40:50] preached from the Pennsylvania Brothers
[40:51] right you better keep your first love if
[40:54] not your heart's going to be turned away
[40:57] you're going to feel so far from God
[40:59] you're not going to feel in love with
[41:00] God you're not going to want you're not
[41:01] going to see God's face when you read
[41:03] the Bible
[41:07] Hallelujah you know what and since we're
[41:09] there go to Ezekiel I think I'm going to
[41:11] pull this out
[41:12] here this is going to help our I think
[41:15] it'll help our both our brothers and
[41:16] sisters go to Ezekiel I think it's
[41:22] 22 I'm giving an
[41:24] extra extra blessing here
[41:31] yeah Exodus I'm sorry it's Ezekiel
[41:34] 24:16 this is for all the married people
[41:36] here now so I'm giving an extra marriage
[41:38] counseling here by God's grace this is a
[41:41] bonus all right I'm not preaching on
[41:44] marriage today but since I had read this
[41:46] this week and had the Song of
[41:49] Solomon uh Ezekiel I don't have it up
[41:51] there um but we got to read it here
[41:54] Ezekiel 24:16 I read this this week and
[41:56] I thought oh that's that's right this
[41:57] this now I understand it now th uh
[42:00] Ezekiel was used to do many signs before
[42:03] Israel the Israel that was out of the
[42:05] land in captivity right in
[42:08] Babylon so one of those signs was God
[42:11] was going to take ezekiel's wife with a
[42:16] stroke and then Ezekiel wasn't going to
[42:18] mourn over her and that was a sign to
[42:20] Israel when God uh judged Israel God
[42:24] wasn't going to mourn because they
[42:26] wouldn't repent of their
[42:28] Abominations okay so with that said I
[42:31] know that's an interesting context verse
[42:33] 15 also the word Lord came unto me
[42:35] saying son of man behold I take away
[42:38] from Thee the desire of thine eyes with
[42:39] a stroke that's his wife yet neither
[42:43] shalt thou mourn nor weep neither shall
[42:46] thy tears run
[42:48] down okay now go down Verse 18 so I so I
[42:51] spake unto the people in the morning and
[42:53] at even my wife died and I did the
[42:55] morning as I was commanded Ed now this
[42:58] is a strange thing a strange sign but
[43:01] the point I want to bring out is not
[43:02] dealing with his wife dying the point I
[43:05] want to bring out is in verse 16 I will
[43:07] take away from Thee the desire of Thine
[43:10] Eyes now that made me think of the lust
[43:13] of the
[43:13] eyes and then I thought what is lust
[43:16] lust is a forbidden
[43:19] craving
[43:21] forbidden
[43:23] Hallelujah but God calls ezekiel's wife
[43:26] the desire of his eyes
[43:27] eyes so what I want to bring out for the
[43:30] marriage is that if you're married your
[43:32] husband or your wife that person is the
[43:35] desire the craving you should have so
[43:38] Brothers it's okay to look at your wife
[43:40] only your wife and she's she's a she's
[43:44] the woman you
[43:46] crave
[43:48] hello testing one two
[43:52] testing sisters it's okay to look at
[43:55] your husband and he's the design for
[43:57] your eyes that's the one man you can
[44:00] look at brothers that wife that's the
[44:03] one woman you should
[44:05] crave see that so it's not a sin for a
[44:08] man to Crave his wife it's not a sin for
[44:11] a woman to Crave her husband Glory some
[44:15] people think it's wrong it's
[44:17] not it's only a sin to crave something
[44:20] that's forbidden but if it's allowed if
[44:22] it's blessed by God then God gave you
[44:24] that to satisfy those cravings
[44:28] and the church said there's your free
[44:30] marriage counseling for today
[44:32] Hallelujah in other words brothers you
[44:34] don't got to feel bad if you're
[44:35] constantly thinking about your wife
[44:36] because that's your wife the Bible in
[44:39] another place calls her your well see
[44:42] because you get thirsty you need some
[44:43] water let's read that Proverbs
[44:47] 5 that's what that's why you were given
[44:50] a husband or
[44:51] wife remember and we were preaching on
[44:53] the message of Grace brother Ram said
[44:54] when David had those feelings looking at
[44:56] basba
[44:57] brother Ram said he had those passions
[44:59] he should have took those passions with
[45:01] one of his wives now for us only one
[45:04] wife but see he went and he called for
[45:08] her so see brother saying there's
[45:10] nothing wrong with having those passions
[45:11] that's what the Bible said God called
[45:13] ezekiel's wife the desire of his
[45:16] eyes a man's supposed to have a
[45:18] beautiful wife to look at a wife
[45:20] supposed to have a handsome husband to
[45:22] look
[45:24] at yall know what I'm talking about when
[45:26] you get married
[45:27] HJ if you're married hopefully you said
[45:30] amen sometime in there you don't have to
[45:31] say it all the time
[45:32] but that's why you want to take care of
[45:34] yourself make your make yourself uh as
[45:37] handsome or as beautiful as you can
[45:40] because you are the desire for your
[45:43] spouse that's
[45:45] right now I know we all feel
[45:46] insufficient sometimes we all but you
[45:48] just got to do the best you can
[45:50] Hallelujah do the best you
[45:53] can because ezekiel's wife was the
[45:55] desire of his eyes that's what God call
[45:57] God calls her that she's the desire
[46:00] she's the craving of your eyes remember
[46:03] job said I make a covenant I won't look
[46:05] on any other ma that means I'm just
[46:07] looking at the desire of my eyes my
[46:10] wife Hallelujah get some good marriage
[46:13] scriptures today by God's gra Proverbs
[46:15] Chapter
[46:21] 5 uh now go to verse eight remove thy
[46:24] way far from her speaking of the strange
[46:25] woman in verse three and come not nigh
[46:28] into the door of her house now Simon
[46:29] preaches as the Catholic church that was
[46:30] a good type that's right I forgot about
[46:31] that now go down to verse 15 drink
[46:33] Waters out of thy own sistern and
[46:35] running Waters out of thine own well let
[46:38] thy fountains be dispersed abroad and
[46:40] the rivers of water in the
[46:42] streets let them be thine only and not
[46:45] strangers with thee so he's he's telling
[46:48] Solon is telling his son uh let your
[46:50] wife's love just fill your life right
[46:53] let it run all over your life in the
[46:55] streets everything that that's that's
[46:57] your desire that that's your well that
[47:00] that that's where you get water from
[47:01] that's where you get satisfaction from
[47:04] Hallelujah Verse 18 let thy Fountain be
[47:06] blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy
[47:09] youth see let her be as the loving Hind
[47:12] and pleasant row let her breast satisfy
[47:14] thee at all times and be thou ravished
[47:16] always with her love Hallelujah so we
[47:20] see it pling the Bible here she your
[47:23] wife is to be desire Brothers of your
[47:25] eyes that's the only one
[47:27] and BR and sisters the husband the
[47:29] desire of your eyes that's why God gave
[47:32] him to you
[47:34] Hallelujah that's right verse 20 why wil
[47:37] thou my son be ravished with a strain
[47:39] woman and embrace the bosom of a
[47:42] stranger right see because your your
[47:44] wife is like your sister your
[47:47] spouse uh she's uh she's your soulmate
[47:50] that's
[47:51] right for the ways of man are before the
[47:54] eyes of the Lord and He pth all of his
[47:56] Goings his own iniquity shall take the
[47:58] wicked himself and he shall be Holden
[48:00] with the cords of his sins he shall die
[48:01] without instruction in the greatness of
[48:03] his folly he shall go astray so
[48:06] adulterers they have great Folly because
[48:09] they're going after forbidden Cravings
[48:11] but God gave you a craving God gave you
[48:14] a well drink from your own well
[48:16] Hallelujah Hallelujah right I don't go
[48:18] over to my neighbor's house I don't go
[48:19] to uh either I'm not going to say their
[48:22] names on live stream but I don't go over
[48:24] there asking for water right I don't go
[48:26] over there getting in their fridge I
[48:28] don't I don't go over there can I borrow
[48:29] your car or truck no I don't even borrow
[48:31] their lawnmower if mine breaks down I
[48:32] don't want it I'm just gonna do mine I'm
[48:35] just gonna be happy with mine I'll I'll
[48:37] deal with it because I don't want to be
[48:38] a burden on anybody but the thought
[48:41] right here is stay with your husband or
[48:43] spouse they're the desire of your
[48:46] eyes all right there you go for some
[48:48] good marriage uh counseling there that
[48:50] struck me because I I don't know if I'd
[48:51] preach ever before that that scripture
[48:55] of course gives husbands the right to
[48:57] think about their wives in the right way
[49:00] now as long as it's all all allowed and
[49:02] not
[49:03] forbidden think I think you married ones
[49:05] know what I'm talking about same for the
[49:07] wives as long as you're thinking on
[49:08] those things and you have those thinking
[49:10] about those things and you have the
[49:12] right desires then God will bless that
[49:15] Hallelujah all right now so now I'm
[49:18] going back to this verse Paul was a wise
[49:21] master builder in spiritual things
[49:23] Solomon was a wise master builder in the
[49:26] Natural Things things right he built a
[49:28] natural house glory and Paul said you
[49:30] are God's house Hallelujah all right now
[49:33] I'm not going to go through that again
[49:35] so we see the similarities between Paul
[49:37] and and Solomon both men were Master
[49:39] Builders one natural one spiritual both
[49:42] men wrote the inspired word of God both
[49:44] Ages were warned to return to their
[49:46] first love and both ages had the
[49:48] Candlestick removed from them Ephesus
[49:51] and from uh
[49:52] Israel so I believe the first church age
[49:55] messenger is a perfect type Paul's a
[49:57] wise master builder and then Salon was a
[49:59] wise master builder as well okay back to
[50:01] chapter 13 I'm sorry chapter 3 1
[50:04] Corinthians 311 for other Foundation can
[50:07] no man lay than that is laid which is
[50:10] Jesus Christ now my wife and I were
[50:12] talking about this one time so I think
[50:13] this thought actually came from my wife
[50:15] this reminds us of Matthew 7 and Jesus's
[50:17] teaching on our foundation being
[50:21] obedience Hallelujah so how many know
[50:24] Jesus is the foundation he's the
[50:27] foundation of your life if you feel
[50:29] unstable you got to look down at your
[50:32] foundation Hallelujah God said he's
[50:34] going to shake everything but if you got
[50:35] the right foundation you know you're not
[50:37] going to
[50:39] fall oop sorry so now let's look at the
[50:42] Rock
[50:44] Foundation Paul says Jesus Christ is our
[50:47] foundation and then in jesus' Parable he
[50:49] said he's talking about the uh the
[50:51] anointed ones of the end time the the
[50:53] false prophets therefore whosoever
[50:55] Hearth these sayings of mine and doeth
[50:57] them I will like in him unto a wise man
[51:00] which builth his house upon a rock
[51:02] what's his foundation The Rock and the
[51:05] rain descended and the floods came and
[51:07] the winds blew and beat upon that house
[51:09] and it fell not for it was founded upon
[51:12] a rock you ought to be encouraged if
[51:13] you've come through the storms of 2024
[51:16] and you're still standing that proves
[51:18] your foundation was a rock hallelujah
[51:21] amen all the storms of this year all the
[51:23] trials of this year uh all the Rains of
[51:26] this year all the frustrations of this
[51:27] year if you're still standing in the
[51:29] truth of God it proves Christ is your
[51:33] foundation I'm not founded on the
[51:35] society I'm not founded on human
[51:38] government I'm not founded on Theology
[51:40] of man I'm not found I'm not founded
[51:42] certainly not on feelings or finances
[51:44] I'm founded on Jesus Christ
[51:48] Hallelujah and that Rock Paul says was
[51:52] Christ and then the rains descended and
[51:55] the floods came and the winds blew upon
[51:56] that house and it fell not is founded
[51:58] upon a rock so Jesus is the foundation
[52:00] of the New Testament teaching Paul says
[52:03] and then Jesus says true teaching is
[52:05] also the foundation of Our Lives
[52:10] Hallelujah brother Brandon taught that
[52:12] Peter's Revelation was the rock that
[52:14] Jesus builds his church upon flesh and
[52:16] blood is not revealed it unto thee but
[52:19] my Father which is in heaven and Upon
[52:22] This Rock I'll build my church again the
[52:24] house illustration are God's
[52:27] house
[52:29] Hallelujah Church aren't you glad that
[52:32] you know you've come through you you're
[52:35] serving God you've served God this long
[52:37] if you are and you're a part of God's
[52:39] church then it proves the father gave
[52:41] you the Revelation a preacher didn't
[52:44] give it to you you don't have a
[52:45] second-handed robe brother Ram says
[52:48] hallelujah right like Elisha he didn't
[52:50] have a second-handed robe that was
[52:51] Elijah's robe glory and if you're
[52:54] serving God today and you're living
[52:55] under the of God today then you don't
[52:57] have a second-handed robe you got the
[52:59] same power that was in Christ the same
[53:01] power that was in St Paul the same power
[53:03] in brother Rand you've got a first-hand
[53:05] robe
[53:06] Hallelujah same Foundation same
[53:09] Revelation The Father revealed it to
[53:12] me in other words brother Simon didn't
[53:15] talk me into this brother Simon pointed
[53:17] me to this but it was the father that
[53:18] revealed this to me because I had a lot
[53:21] of friends try to talk me out of it
[53:22] after that Hallelujah I had people
[53:25] praying that I'd come out of this
[53:27] but somebody else was praying for me
[53:29] Hallelujah Simon Craig brother Brooks
[53:31] brother all all the brothers were
[53:32] praying for me too hallelujah it's a
[53:35] it's a it's a blessing to know that the
[53:38] father himself Your Father revealed this
[53:40] to you not another
[53:42] person see somebody planted somebody
[53:44] watered but God gave you the revelation
[53:47] of it God gave you the
[53:49] increase
[53:51] Hallelujah so notice a real Revelation
[53:55] or Revelation means unveiling
[53:57] of the word is when the believer obeys
[53:59] the commands of the
[54:01] word right because Jesus said let me
[54:03] show you somebody he that does my
[54:06] Commandments let me show you what he's
[54:07] like he's a house that can't be knocked
[54:09] down oh glory amen so see that's what a
[54:13] real Revelation is God show me his word
[54:16] and I obey Because I obey my father I
[54:19] love my father because my father loves
[54:21] me so Peter's personal revelation was
[54:24] his and the church's Rock so you have a
[54:28] rock hallelujah Paul's teaching was the
[54:32] rock the obedient life is founded on the
[54:35] Rock and the over Overcomer never fails
[54:39] or Falls away because they're standing
[54:41] on the Rock Church I'm trying to
[54:43] encourage you look down at your feet
[54:44] today spiritually you're standing on a
[54:47] rock hallelujah you're not standing on
[54:49] Sand your foundation is not going to
[54:51] fall out from you you're not going to be
[54:54] pushed or knocked over by the devil or
[54:56] or or or taking out the message or
[54:58] taking out of the truth it's impossible
[55:00] because your foundation is not sand your
[55:03] foundation is truth hallelujah amen look
[55:06] at your foundation this morning
[55:08] Hallelujah that's what I know I got how
[55:11] many emails how many I mean thousands of
[55:13] comments all these comments uh trying to
[55:16] uh deceive me or something like that how
[55:19] do I stand how do I stand all these
[55:21] years as a pastor I'm founded on a
[55:23] rock I see what Jesus says brother mercy
[55:26] and I do it amen it's that simple
[55:30] Hallelujah these other people are not
[55:32] doing what Jesus said but we're doing
[55:34] what our Lord tells us to do Hallelujah
[55:36] he's Whispering love secrets in our ears
[55:38] as the wedding approaches
[55:40] Hallelujah that's
[55:43] right so thank you hun that was a great
[55:46] thought I really enjoyed that I probably
[55:47] didn't say it the right way you remember
[55:48] when you told me that you remember that
[55:50] yeah you tell me you because you you you
[55:52] read Matthew 7 in your Bible that
[55:53] morning I remember you had it on your
[55:54] phone you're like he was like hey no
[55:56] call I don't know if you call me Jess or
[55:57] brother J probably not brother Jess call
[55:59] me Jess look this proves Revelation
[56:03] right if someone has a revelation
[56:05] they're going to do the will of God
[56:07] because it's the Rock and the rock is a
[56:09] revelation Hallelujah but you have to do
[56:12] the word of God if you do the word of
[56:14] God then you're standing on a rock ah so
[56:17] I hope I didn't I probably just cut it
[56:18] up a little bit but forgive me it was
[56:20] beautiful the way my wife said it
[56:23] Hallelujah when she shared that
[56:24] Revelation with me now everyone that
[56:26] hear these things of mine and doeth them
[56:28] not shall be likened unto a foolish man
[56:30] see that's a foolish person they hear
[56:32] the word of God and they don't do
[56:35] it and he builds his house upon the
[56:38] sand and the rains descend the floods
[56:42] came the winds blew it beat upon the
[56:45] house and it fell and great was the fall
[56:48] of
[56:49] it so see church we don't want our lives
[56:52] to fall into sin we don't want to fall
[56:54] in disgrace amen CU listen Church you're
[56:57] going to get your house is going to get
[56:58] beat

[57:13] hear the SLE all over your roof and
[57:14] maybe some big chunks your house is
[57:16] going to get beat on but it's going to
[57:18] stand most likely
[57:20] right but spiritually our house should
[57:24] always stand Hallelujah because we know
[57:26] if God's letting this pound on our house
[57:28] we know God allowed it and if God
[57:30] allowed it God won't let me be defeated
[57:32] God won't let me fall God's going to
[57:34] make me stand
[57:36] Hallelujah because God is my Foundation
[57:39] God's the one that even allowed me to be
[57:40] on this rock God's the one that gave me
[57:42] this house amen so God surely won't let
[57:45] me fall Hallelujah what's Paul telling
[57:47] these people if you keep trusting in
[57:49] your favorite preacher you're going to
[57:50] fall you got to trust in Jesus Christ
[57:53] Alone Hallelujah
[57:56] the reality is you just see God through
[57:58] every preacher I say this the reality is
[58:00] you see God and every believer
[58:02] here like we just recorded Len's
[58:04] testimony and uh we can hear those
[58:06] testimonies that's God working in our
[58:08] sister that's why I like doing those
[58:09] testimonies you can see God God is
[58:11] behind that individual God's working
[58:13] with them in God's Own Way ain't always
[58:16] going to be the same as you and I but we
[58:18] appreciate we respect we honor what
[58:20] God's doing in every life Hallelujah we
[58:23] got to be yielded to the Holy Spirit not
[58:26] building not trusting in the the things
[58:27] of the world building our lives on Sand

[58:34] truth is per proof the person never had
[58:36] a
[58:37] revelation right all these people that

[59:13] you people say I know Jesus for 40 years
[59:15] in the message and then I don't know his

[1:00:21] known now that makes me fearful but also
[1:00:23] makes me confident Hallelujah
[1:00:30] because what's what's going to happen
[1:00:32] the day there's coming a day when God
[1:00:35] will declare Every Man's work and I'm

[1:02:00] work of what sort it is so what did the
[1:02:02] man build it they build it with gold the
[1:02:05] fire is going to show do you build with

[1:02:27] this type but in other words don't build
[1:02:29] it out of temporary things build it out
[1:02:30] of things that have
[1:02:32] permanence they they they're long
[1:02:34] lasting they're valuable amen amen build
[1:02:37] your house out of something valuable
[1:02:39] Hallelujah the word of
[1:02:42] God so see every preacher's work in
[1:02:45] their study and sermon preparation is
[1:02:47] going to be revealed every single one of
[1:02:51] them that makes again that makes me
[1:02:53] sober but also makes me joyful because
[1:02:56] I've just tried to point the people to
[1:02:58] Christ never tried to point them to me I
[1:03:01] tried to point them to Christ by the
[1:03:03] grace of
[1:03:04] God now look at brother R says brother R
[1:03:07] now in this sermon let's see do I have
[1:03:08] another one from this I can't remember
[1:03:10] yes so let's read this one first brother
[1:03:12] raham brings an indictment that means
[1:03:14] he's proving these preachers are guilty
[1:03:16] that's what indictment is proof of guilt
[1:03:19] brother raham says today I indict this
[1:03:20] bunch of ordained ministers in their
[1:03:22] Creeds and denominations they're
[1:03:24] crucifying to the people the very God
[1:03:25] that they claim that they love and serve
[1:03:27] I indict these ministers in the name of
[1:03:29] the Lord Jesus Christ upon their what
[1:03:32] their
[1:03:33] Doctrine brother Abraham's inditing them
[1:03:35] on their
[1:03:37] doctrine that claim that the days of
[1:03:39] Miracles is passed and the water baptism
[1:03:41] in the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus
[1:03:43] Christ is not sufficient and not right
[1:03:45] upon any of these words that they have
[1:03:47] substituted Creeds for I indict them as
[1:03:49] guilty and the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:03:52] upon their hands for crucifying aresh
[1:03:53] the Lord Jesus the second time they're
[1:03:56] crucifying Christ to the public taking
[1:03:59] from them the thing that they're
[1:04:00] supposed to be given them and they
[1:04:02] substitute something else in his place a
[1:04:04] church Creed for popularity now these
[1:04:06] preachers are indicted because they took
[1:04:08] the word away but what are we trying to
[1:04:10] do we're trying to give you the word be
[1:04:12] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:04:14] that's the name of your husband amen
[1:04:17] trust in God God's A Healer God can give
[1:04:19] you Divine Healing God can give you a
[1:04:21] miracle today Hallelujah trust in God
[1:04:23] hallelujah all these promises we're
[1:04:26] trying to give you the true teaching the
[1:04:27] true Doctrine hallelujah we're not
[1:04:29] trying to take it away from you believe
[1:04:31] in God with all your heart believe in
[1:04:33] the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt
[1:04:35] Prosper
[1:04:36] hallelujah amen but the guilty preachers
[1:04:39] are taking these scriptures these
[1:04:41] promises away brother raham indites them
[1:04:45] but he also prays and says oh Lord
[1:04:47] God I'm going to skip down Minister will
[1:04:50] hear this in their study I pray for them
[1:04:52] Lord let these words fall deep into the
[1:04:54] heart cut deep cut all cut away all the
[1:04:57] world that's what we want today
[1:04:59] Hallelujah we want the Holy Ghost to
[1:05:01] come in doesn't the Bible say the word's
[1:05:02] a sword we want this sword to come in
[1:05:05] and go deep into our soul and cut out
[1:05:07] anything that craves the world anything
[1:05:09] that craves anything forbidden Lord cut
[1:05:11] it out and do a surgery on my
[1:05:13] heart or maybe you if mine works better
[1:05:15] for you do
[1:05:17] that right just cut it out Lord go deep
[1:05:21] let the word of God go deep into our
[1:05:24] hearts and cut away all the desires of
[1:05:26] the world and then he gives a testimony
[1:05:29] this little Methodist Minister down in
[1:05:30] Kentucky he's got two or three children
[1:05:34] he said I was hearing those seven Church
[1:05:35] ages I heard it cry out get away from
[1:05:37] them walls of Babylon so the walls of
[1:05:39] denomination are like the walls of
[1:05:40] Babylon right they're keeping you
[1:05:41] chained into their Creeds like the walls
[1:05:43] of Babylon kept you in the world right
[1:05:44] kept you in
[1:05:45] sin I give it up and left I don't know
[1:05:48] which way to go or what to do but I left
[1:05:50] blessed be the courage of that young man
[1:05:52] and a wife and two or three
[1:05:54] children brother said bless that man he
[1:05:57] sees the evils of Creeds he comes out of
[1:05:59] there he doesn't know where he's going
[1:06:01] he's trusting God to bless him as he
[1:06:03] takes a stand on the word of God because
[1:06:06] every one of his works is going to be
[1:06:07] judged by the word of God and we know
[1:06:09] all of our Lives will be judged by the
[1:06:11] word of
[1:06:17] God
[1:06:19] okay so every man's work will be made
[1:06:22] manifest and the day shall declare and
[1:06:25] the fire will declare now there's two
[1:06:27] kinds of fires that will declare these
[1:06:28] preachers
[1:06:30] works right there's the fire of the
[1:06:33] fiery Trials of life and then there's
[1:06:35] the fires of standing before Jesus when
[1:06:37] he has fire in his eyes so I caught this
[1:06:39] from Wednesday there's two
[1:06:41] fires because the Bible says we all go
[1:06:44] through how many know these scriptures
[1:06:46] right when you go through a when you go
[1:06:48] through a Temptation the trial your
[1:06:50] faith be more precious than gold that
[1:06:51] perish though it be tried with fire so
[1:06:54] when you go through test it's like a
[1:06:56] fire right life seems hard life seems
[1:06:58] hot life seems uncomfortable but it's
[1:07:01] it's it's testing your faith it's making
[1:07:03] you more pure
[1:07:05] hallelujah it's getting out as brother
[1:07:07] Aaron preached to us right it's getting
[1:07:09] there's seven steps to get the draw out
[1:07:11] it's God getting all the sin and
[1:07:12] cravings and the evil desires he's
[1:07:14] getting it out of your life we ought to
[1:07:16] be thankful he's making us more
[1:07:20] pure so the fire will declare what our
[1:07:23] lives were spent for Hallelujah
[1:07:26] the trials of life will prove do we
[1:07:28] really love people in the church do we
[1:07:30] really love one another do I really love
[1:07:31] my husband do I really love my wife do I
[1:07:33] really love my children do I really love
[1:07:35] this message amen hallelujah the trials
[1:07:38] of life will prove what you really love
[1:07:42] Hallelujah it'll take all the
[1:07:44] selfishness out all the divisions all
[1:07:48] and for the Corinthian Church it would
[1:07:49] do that too because Paul writes a second
[1:07:51] letter and they obeyed him in the things
[1:07:52] that he wrote see that's what the fire
[1:07:54] of God will do
[1:07:56] it will take out your dross and didn't
[1:07:58] Jesus say I counsel thee to buy of me
[1:08:00] gold tried in the fire during the church
[1:08:03] age right during your lifetime you can
[1:08:05] buy gold today and I looked up gold it's
[1:08:06] like2 2,000 some dollars an ounce now
[1:08:09] that's not that's not the gold Jesus
[1:08:10] selling you some of you might want to go
[1:08:12] invest in some gold you might want to it
[1:08:14] keeps going up but Jesus said his gold
[1:08:17] is
[1:08:18] free Hallelujah he said buy money
[1:08:21] without price hallelujah amen he said
[1:08:23] buy the truth and sell it not
[1:08:27] Hallelujah so see Jesus is trying to
[1:08:29] give you Christlike character it's the
[1:08:31] time tested Faith gold right the the
[1:08:34] gold is the Christlike character as you
[1:08:36] go through the fires of life you go
[1:08:38] through the fiery trials your your life
[1:08:40] becomes more like Christ you become more
[1:08:43] like a Christian like brother said you
[1:08:45] live that day you you can smile when
[1:08:47] people speak evil of you when things
[1:08:49] don't go your way at the church you can
[1:08:50] still smile and take up your cross and
[1:08:52] follow Jesus because you know it's all
[1:08:54] working together for your
[1:08:56] good
[1:08:57] Hallelujah that's right so that's the
[1:09:00] first type of fire here's the second
[1:09:01] type of fire each preacher and every one
[1:09:04] of us will stand before
[1:09:06] Christ and what's he going to look like
[1:09:08] his head and hairs were white like
[1:09:11] wool his eyes were as a flame of fire so
[1:09:15] G so Paul says that day will declare by
[1:09:19] fire and brother in the church age book
[1:09:21] says see the fire the fiery Eyes Of God
[1:09:23] will see through there no excuse uses
[1:09:26] right there's not there's you can't lie
[1:09:28] and you can't you can't whitewash your
[1:09:30] mistakes something like that the fire
[1:09:31] will burn right through that and see
[1:09:33] what's really down to the depths of our
[1:09:34] hearts that's why we need to confess all
[1:09:36] our sins now Hallelujah so that on that
[1:09:39] day the Bible said we'll have boldness
[1:09:40] on the day of
[1:09:41] judgment so I want to bring that out for
[1:09:43] an assurance for you I don't want I
[1:09:45] don't want the the guilt of your past to
[1:09:46] hang over you because if you confess
[1:09:48] your sins and you're striving to obey
[1:09:50] God then you can have boldness in other
[1:09:52] words happiness and confidence on the
[1:09:54] day of judgment because you know God's
[1:09:56] helped you overcome your sins Hallelujah
[1:09:59] that's right let me look that up now
[1:10:01] because I I don't have it on my slides
[1:10:02] there I just thought about it right now
[1:10:03] boldness in the day of
[1:10:08] judgment it's 1 John 4:17 if you got
[1:10:10] your Bible heing is our love made
[1:10:12] perfect that we may have boldness in the
[1:10:14] day of judgment because as he is so are
[1:10:16] we in this world and the church
[1:10:19] said boldness means frankness so honesty
[1:10:24] spokenness bluntness
[1:10:26] Assurance oh I like that
[1:10:29] Assurance we have Assurance on the day
[1:10:31] of judgment I know he paid for my sins
[1:10:34] right I know I've confessed them I'm
[1:10:36] striving to put every demon under my
[1:10:39] foot I'm not walking according to the
[1:10:41] course of this world the prince of power
[1:10:43] of the air I'm walking according to the
[1:10:44] Holy Spirit
[1:10:46] Hallelujah all
[1:10:51] right and unto the angel of the church
[1:10:53] and th write these things sayith the Son
[1:10:56] of God who hath his eyes like unto a
[1:10:59] flame of fire and his feet are like fine
[1:11:03] brass all right now here's what I want
[1:11:06] to show you I've been talking about this
[1:11:07] over the years 2024 has been an awful
[1:11:09] year for false
[1:11:11] preachers one of these guys is named
[1:11:13] Bickle uh he started a 24hour think
[1:11:16] about this he started a 24-hour prayer
[1:11:18] chapel and they it's still going on
[1:11:20] today they started in the '90s
[1:11:22] and for 24 hours a day they sing and
[1:11:25] praise and worship but it's a Prosperity
[1:11:29] Gospel it's a Prosperity Gospel and this
[1:11:31] year he was caught uh he's already
[1:11:34] married but he was telling a woman uh he
[1:11:36] see they they have all these false
[1:11:38] prophecies they try to impersonate a
[1:11:40] prophet and this man told a woman uh so
[1:11:43] he could have adultery he said the Lord
[1:11:44] show me my wife's going to die uh by
[1:11:47] Vision so you're going to be my wife
[1:11:49] after she passes away that's that
[1:11:52] dude and these guys have millions and
[1:11:55] millions of dollars in their
[1:11:58] Ministries now Bentley I don't remember
[1:12:00] him but I know he left his first wife
[1:12:01] for his secretary I don't he's he's had
[1:12:04] a lot of problems Lawson he's the most
[1:12:06] recent one he was a 70 year old man he
[1:12:08] he and with his church money the church
[1:12:10] donations he would fly a 20-year-old
[1:12:13] he's 70 he'd fly a 20-y old up to see
[1:12:15] him so many
[1:12:18] times this guy was Pastor in New York
[1:12:20] City and he had adulteries as many women
[1:12:22] for Hill song he was a hill song pastor
[1:12:24] and he one they he remember he went on
[1:12:26] The View and they asked him uh they said
[1:12:29] is it okay to have an abortion in your
[1:12:30] church and it wasn't but he made it like
[1:12:32] it was and then he had to apologize
[1:12:34] afterwards look at that being under the
[1:12:36] light of the world can't even stand up
[1:12:38] for
[1:12:39] Christ see all the works Church all the
[1:12:42] works are going to be made manifest by
[1:12:44] the fire amen hallelujah Every Man's
[1:12:47] work every woman's testimony all of our
[1:12:49] lives are going to be judged and and and
[1:12:52] the fire is going to expose what was
[1:12:54] behind that God help us to have Purity
[1:12:56] in our lives amen hallelujah they're
[1:12:59] going to be exposed now think about that
[1:13:00] 20 20 30 40 this guy was a preacher for
[1:13:03] 50 some years but eventually it's going
[1:13:05] to be exposed if it's not if the sin is
[1:13:08] not dealt with if they're building their
[1:13:09] life on Sand though winds are going to
[1:13:12] the storms are going to blow them
[1:13:14] down and Ministries loss and
[1:13:17] disgrace people look up to these people
[1:13:20] now this man uh Morris he had the he has
[1:13:22] the largest he had he's he's resigned
[1:13:25] now he had the largest church in all of
[1:13:27] America in Texas but it come to find out
[1:13:30] when he was 20 years old he was freshly
[1:13:31] married he was living with his inlaws
[1:13:33] and then he was molesting uh another
[1:13:36] person in the house and it just came out
[1:13:39] and these are all Prosperity preachers
[1:13:41] well I'm sorry not him all the other
[1:13:43] ones are Prosperity they got all these
[1:13:44] false gifts and they all try to
[1:13:46] impersonate brother brandom not him
[1:13:47] though U and the last one I didn't put
[1:13:50] his name up there but that's the message
[1:13:51] preacher that fell this year and I was
[1:13:52] going through my notes and uh
[1:13:55] this message preacher back in 2012 asked
[1:13:58] to be a part of a ministers meeting that
[1:14:01] we were having and I just found my email
[1:14:02] yet last night I thought well there it
[1:14:04] is U and I said brother I can't have you
[1:14:08] come for two reasons first you've caused
[1:14:10] a vision in my brother's church and you
[1:14:13] haven't repented of
[1:14:15] that and second of all you weren't
[1:14:17] ordained the way the Bible says to be
[1:14:19] ordained the Bible said you got to be
[1:14:21] ordained by another preacher by the
[1:14:23] laying on of hands
[1:14:25] this man when he was ordained he called
[1:14:27] in a guest preacher and then had his mom
[1:14:29] and dad and a guest preacher ordained
[1:14:31] him I'm sorry that's not the way it
[1:14:33] works another Holy Ghost filed man has
[1:14:35] to see a gift in another Holy Ghost fil
[1:14:37] man and that Holy Ghost filed man has to
[1:14:39] ordain that man so I said you got two
[1:14:41] things against you and so he emailed
[1:14:44] back and said well I just hope God will
[1:14:46] bless it someday now look what God did
[1:14:49] just in May uh in May it was all over
[1:14:51] the news in Toledo this man uh is in his
[1:14:54] 30s and he's writing letters to a a
[1:14:56] teenager trying to have sexual relations
[1:14:59] with him and now was resigned and lost
[1:15:01] in the message but look I warned him 12
[1:15:05] years ago I warned him right if you
[1:15:07] don't start the right way it's going to
[1:15:09] end the it's going to end
[1:15:11] bad if you don't make your if you don't
[1:15:13] make your foundation The Rock The Winds
[1:15:15] of the storms of life are going to blow
[1:15:17] you over thank God we're still standing
[1:15:19] today thank God there's a rock that the
[1:15:21] heavenly father reveals to us and we can
[1:15:23] build our lives upon the truth of the
[1:15:24] gopel hallelujah amen oh makes me
[1:15:27] Rejoice to know that we're standing on
[1:15:30] the truth the day the fire will expose
[1:15:33] what every man's work
[1:15:37] was Hallelujah if any man's work abide
[1:15:41] which he's built upon he shall receive a
[1:15:43] reward there's a reward for faithful
[1:15:46] preachers also especially moms there's a
[1:15:50] reward for anyone who gives a child a
[1:15:52] glass of water in the name of a disciple
[1:15:55] and I don't know how that works you know
[1:15:56] normally I could give I give you this
[1:15:57] water in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:15:59] Christ right I bless that you know but
[1:16:02] Jesus said you can even do it in the
[1:16:03] name of a disciple and you you won't
[1:16:05] lose your reward so see just ministering
[1:16:07] to the needs of the family right Anna
[1:16:09] being good to your your siblings right
[1:16:11] God's G to give you a reward for that
[1:16:14] think Casa how much W reward you got for
[1:16:16] cooking supper for
[1:16:18] us as long as you did it in the name of
[1:16:20] the Lord God's got a reward for you so
[1:16:24] it's not just preaching
[1:16:26] it's every believer when you serve
[1:16:28] others when you show the love of Jesus
[1:16:29] Christ to others God keeps track right
[1:16:31] the angels are writing them down
[1:16:33] Hallelujah God's going to reward you for
[1:16:35] that and the fires of life will expose
[1:16:38] what was your real motivation what was
[1:16:40] your real purpose for this let the
[1:16:41] motivation be to love Jesus Christ and
[1:16:44] to make him known that we can spend
[1:16:46] eternity with Jesus Hallelujah that
[1:16:48] should be the motivation I'm trying to
[1:16:49] finish
[1:16:52] here if any man's work shall be burned
[1:16:54] now those prach I showed you their
[1:16:56] Ministries are all burnt down now I hope
[1:16:59] they can get saved but it doesn't look
[1:17:01] like some of them because they haven't
[1:17:02] really repented they just go off and Mar
[1:17:05] oh I forgot one up there the Tony Evans
[1:17:06] guy yeah he was all over the no he was a
[1:17:09] very respected man he was all over the
[1:17:11] radio internet and again it was oh yeah
[1:17:14] what was the common denominator for all
[1:17:15] those preachers sexual sin lust of the
[1:17:20] eyes now a lot of it too is money right
[1:17:23] because once they got the money once
[1:17:24] they got then they can fly the girls in
[1:17:27] and bunch of bunch of lust of the eyes
[1:17:30] of what it
[1:17:31] is men filled with demon powers right
[1:17:34] but it's just like bam right sometimes
[1:17:35] they're anointed on the spirit of God
[1:17:37] sometimes they're Anointed with lust
[1:17:39] demons right just leaving instead of
[1:17:41] that everyday Christian Life that solid
[1:17:45] wheat seed Christian Life and the church
[1:17:47] said that mature wheat seed that's
[1:17:49] hardened that lays in the presence of
[1:17:51] son the sun Hallelujah rejoice in the
[1:17:53] word of God gives God praise loves the
[1:17:55] worship God hallelujah that's a mat true
[1:17:57] I'm sorry that's a true mature wheat
[1:17:58] seed of God that's ready for the Harvest
[1:18:00] Hallelujah forgot to put gel on my hair
[1:18:02] this morning so sorry just flopping all
[1:18:04] over the place here
[1:18:07] today now this church can only but he
[1:18:10] himself shall be saved now this is only
[1:18:12] referring to the foolish virgins because
[1:18:15] bam won't be saved Cain won't be saved
[1:18:18] the Bible already told us those there's
[1:18:19] a whole list of those preachers Kora
[1:18:20] Dayan they won't be
[1:18:22] saved so Paul's referring to the Jewish
[1:18:25] virgin preachers in
[1:18:27] Corinth they'll be saved if they
[1:18:31] repent think about that you lost all the
[1:18:35] benefits now just picture you know
[1:18:37] picture your garden or my wife's Garden
[1:18:39] or something like that think of all the
[1:18:40] fruits over all the years we've had that
[1:18:42] Garden we've had it 14 years think about
[1:18:44] all the pounds of potatoes we were
[1:18:45] digging up a few weeks ago kids really
[1:18:48] like that was that's fun it's fun to
[1:18:49] find all those potatoes and those were
[1:18:51] just volunteers right you know Glory but
[1:18:54] think about all the I remember when we
[1:18:55] when you guys were little I carried in
[1:18:57] those big wheel barrel full of of lots
[1:18:59] of pounds of potatoes think about all
[1:19:01] that fruit I'm think in God's mind he's
[1:19:04] keeping track of all that Harvest and to
[1:19:06] think that if that if that preacher if
[1:19:09] that that planter doesn't have the right
[1:19:10] heart all the fruits of all those years
[1:19:12] can be burnt and there's no record of it
[1:19:14] in heaven that's quite a
[1:19:17] thought but if that farmer had a pure
[1:19:19] heart then there is a record there's a
[1:19:21] reward for all that Harvest that you
[1:19:23] brought forth for Christ
[1:19:26] Hallelujah isn't that wonderful the
[1:19:29] Bible says that you can be saved and
[1:19:31] have no
[1:19:32] reward I hope these preachers get saved
[1:19:34] but we've just seen in 2024 I mean
[1:19:36] there's been Lots through the years but
[1:19:38] this year has been
[1:19:39] especially uh revealing something about
[1:19:44] 2024 where where their whole Ministries
[1:19:46] are burn over and there's nothing people
[1:19:49] now people stop selling their books and
[1:19:50] of course of course because they've
[1:19:52] they've brought a reproach they've
[1:19:54] defamed they've defiled the name of
[1:19:56] Jesus
[1:19:58] Amen and the fires of the day this day
[1:20:01] 2024 the fires of the day reveal what
[1:20:04] was in their
[1:20:05] heart Christians should be the hardest
[1:20:10] workers Christians should be the most
[1:20:12] pure people amen the most transparent
[1:20:16] people the most honest
[1:20:19] people the most trustworthy people
[1:20:22] amen but you give you give some of these
[1:20:24] guys's enough money they can't trust
[1:20:28] him remember this guy specifically oh
[1:20:30] yeah and he was part of a church and he
[1:20:32] had this guy specifically they found out
[1:20:34] later he had no Pastor he had no home
[1:20:38] Church they were just paying him to come
[1:20:40] preach there very often but it it come
[1:20:42] out that after every time he preached he
[1:20:44] just left he had no contact with the
[1:20:46] people he didn't really care about the
[1:20:47] people he was only there for a
[1:20:50] paycheck no contact now how many pastors
[1:20:53] uh do we know around the the world right
[1:20:55] we talk about this but you know a pastor
[1:20:57] shouldn't be just high and above
[1:20:58] somebody brother said the shepherd
[1:21:00] should be right there with the
[1:21:02] Sheep so you know what kind of character
[1:21:04] he is he's your example how can he be
[1:21:05] your example if you don't even know him
[1:21:07] and never seen him struggle never seen
[1:21:08] him that's why I love brother brand he's
[1:21:10] so honest he is so humble so honest to
[1:21:14] us when was the last time you told
[1:21:16] somebody yeah I pouted I was pouting to
[1:21:18] God I was being like a baby towards God
[1:21:20] when was the last time you told somebody
[1:21:21] about your last lie brother lied to the
[1:21:24] IRS think about how humble this man is
[1:21:27] see he didn't care because he knew God
[1:21:29] he knew in honesty God would bless that
[1:21:31] honesty and then that would help us as
[1:21:34] we listen and and that even helps us
[1:21:36] understand more how could Abraham lie
[1:21:37] twice how could David do such a thing
[1:21:39] David how could you do it we just saw
[1:21:41] that on W on Thursday how could you do
[1:21:43] such thing like that but yet there's
[1:21:46] Grace when we make mistakes are we going
[1:21:48] to pay for it absolutely we'll pay for
[1:21:50] every sin we've done brother said you'll
[1:21:51] get spanked for every evil thing you do
[1:21:53] but God's Gra will bring you to a pure
[1:21:55] heart I'm trying to close did I say that
[1:21:58] yet I'm trying to
[1:22:00] close I'm at my regular time anyway by
[1:22:02] God's
[1:22:04] grace so see preachers or even moms or
[1:22:06] dads anybody think about think about
[1:22:08] that anyone who who has this awful fall
[1:22:10] the all their all their work will be
[1:22:12] burnt but at least if they repent they
[1:22:14] can be saved that's the grace of God you
[1:22:17] waste your whole life for a moment of
[1:22:19] pleasure whatever it is few moments of
[1:22:20] pleasure you waste your whole life for
[1:22:22] that but yet God will still forgive you
[1:22:24] if you you truly
[1:22:25] repent that's the grace of
[1:22:30] God what do you say by by fire right
[1:22:33] you're saved by Christ Christ sees okay
[1:22:36] you did repent like the thief on the
[1:22:38] cross you did repent I see
[1:22:42] you remember very very few false
[1:22:45] preachers will be saved right because
[1:22:46] Jesus said very few find the narrow road
[1:22:49] so again I hope those Brothers can
[1:22:50] repent if they are brothers indeed now
[1:22:53] remember we're still in the context of
[1:22:54] divisions in the church know you not
[1:22:56] that you're the temple of God and that
[1:22:58] the spirit of God dwells in you and yet
[1:23:00] you're arguing and envying jealousy
[1:23:06] debates If any man defile the temple of
[1:23:08] God him shall God destroy we see this
[1:23:10] later in chapter 11 people don't discern
[1:23:12] the body of Christ so many are weak and
[1:23:14] sickly among you and many have passed
[1:23:16] away in this big
[1:23:18] church so this was a big issue there was
[1:23:20] lots of little uh Clicks in the church
[1:23:23] and these people against that people and
[1:23:24] yet Supernatural
[1:23:26] everywhere it's it's astounding what
[1:23:29] kind of atmosphere this church was
[1:23:33] in If any man destroy the temple of God
[1:23:36] him shall God destroy now that can be in
[1:23:37] the current day right because the Bible
[1:23:39] said some men sins go go before them
[1:23:41] some go behind them some of them we
[1:23:43] won't find out till the day of
[1:23:45] judgment right so this this could mean
[1:23:47] God will destroy uh their souls in hell
[1:23:49] right he'll destroy them they're made to
[1:23:51] be taken and destroyed or it could mean
[1:23:53] they suffer that punishment right here
[1:23:55] on the
[1:23:56] earth for the temple of God is Holy
[1:23:59] which Temple you are so even divisions
[1:24:02] and of course getting drunk and suing
[1:24:04] people and sexual immorality all these
[1:24:07] things should not be done because we're
[1:24:09] supposed to be holy we're supposed to be
[1:24:11] set apart we're supposed to be set apart
[1:24:13] so God can use us whenever he wants to
[1:24:15] praise
[1:24:17] God so what is it that defiles in this
[1:24:19] context the pride of life makes people
[1:24:22] divided envying
[1:24:24] uh what's the other one the
[1:24:26] dissension it's the pride of life that
[1:24:29] does that and it defiles what's supposed
[1:24:31] to be a holy
[1:24:32] life our lives must remain holy for the
[1:24:35] grace of God let's get the leav out if
[1:24:37] we have any Le in our lives let's get
[1:24:38] the leaven out praise God he's going to
[1:24:40] get to that in two chapters in chapter
[1:24:42] five I'm almost let no man deceive
[1:24:45] himself if any man among you seem to be
[1:24:48] wise in this world let him become a fool
[1:24:51] that he may be wise
[1:24:54] okay so man or woman that thinks they
[1:24:56] know all about it they got life figured
[1:24:57] out they're successful in every single
[1:24:58] thing they do Paul says let that person
[1:25:01] become a fool to the gospel right let
[1:25:04] them become simple let them understand
[1:25:06] the ways of
[1:25:07] God don't deceive yourself just because
[1:25:10] people have uh blessings in the natural
[1:25:12] that doesn't mean they're right with God
[1:25:14] that's no sign that they're anywhere
[1:25:16] right with God just like I showed you
[1:25:17] all those million dollar preachers none
[1:25:19] of them are right with God the whole
[1:25:22] time so Paul says don't be deceived
[1:25:24] received riches riches and popularity
[1:25:27] that doesn't mean you're right with God
[1:25:29] for the wisdom of this world is
[1:25:31] foolishness with God for it's written he
[1:25:33] taketh the wise in their own craftiness
[1:25:35] I love thinking about this God said we
[1:25:37] must be simple humble or fools for
[1:25:41] Christ and didn't God take hmon Hon's
[1:25:43] like oh I'm gonna build I'm gonna build
[1:25:46] a galley and God says no you're not well
[1:25:48] you can but it's not going to be for
[1:25:49] Mori or that's going to be for you I'm
[1:25:53] smarter than you are
[1:25:56] right and Jonah Jonah's like I'm GNA run
[1:25:57] away from God God's I'm going to sail
[1:25:59] away God's not going to get me oh yeah
[1:26:01] God will get you that's right he's going
[1:26:02] to get you with the fish a great whale
[1:26:05] he's going to get you see people think
[1:26:06] they can outsmart God it's impossible
[1:26:08] don't run from God run to God Amen we
[1:26:12] shouldn't be men men and women running
[1:26:13] from the presence of the Lord we should
[1:26:14] be men and women drawing in running into
[1:26:17] God's
[1:26:19] presence Nebuchadnezzar oh I got this
[1:26:22] all I I I've built all this look how
[1:26:24] great I am the hanging baskets and God
[1:26:26] said you're not so smart I'm going to
[1:26:27] give you a beast mind right he takes the
[1:26:31] wise their own craftiness you're without
[1:26:33] me you're nothing but a plain old
[1:26:36] Beast right that's all you are without
[1:26:39] me if my if my hand of protection isn't
[1:26:42] on you you'd be a little you'd be an
[1:26:44] animal out there in the

[1:26:51] Hallelujah love joy and a sound mind
[1:26:53] Hallelujah God has not given us a spirit
[1:26:55] of fear or a spirit of Pride for that

[1:27:24] oh I'll sell him out we'll sell him out
[1:27:26] uh we'll show him that he's not the
[1:27:27] favorite and God said I'm going to exalt
[1:27:29] him to second in the whole world then
[1:27:30] he's going to save your your entire
[1:27:33] lives because you despise his his dreams
[1:27:35] you despise his prophecies you despise
[1:27:38] his gift you tried to kill him but yet
[1:27:39] I'm going to use him to save your life
[1:27:42] the person you Tred to kill I'm going to
[1:27:43] use to save you now that's humility

[1:27:49] Church let's not go after anybody let's
[1:27:51] not have any Rivals except the devil and
[1:27:53] yourself
[1:27:55] brother R said my greatest enemy is
[1:27:56] William brandham he's the one that gets
[1:28:00] lazy he's the one that thinks he can do
[1:28:02] something about it and the church said
[1:28:04] right let's have those enemies not our
[1:28:07] brothers and sisters not not even these
[1:28:08] people on the screen that's not our
[1:28:09] enemies I'm praying for them I had
[1:28:11] prayed for them I hope they get saved
[1:28:14] but the day will manifest all of our
[1:28:18] works like I just told you before it
[1:28:20] might take 20 years to manifest what's
[1:28:22] in someone's heart it might take 40 as
[1:28:24] we saw they really don't believe the
[1:28:26] message it might take 50 it might take
[1:28:28] 60 but the day will declare
[1:28:31] it
[1:28:32] Hallelujah Every Man's work shall be
[1:28:36] declared and again the Lord knoweth the
[1:28:39] thoughts of the wise that they are vain
[1:28:41] God help us to get rid of our
[1:28:43] self-centered plans for our
[1:28:45] lives the best thing I can advise like I
[1:28:47] told Malachi and the young people uh the
[1:28:49] best thing I could advise say Lord you
[1:28:51] direct my paths you open this door you
[1:28:54] close this door I want to do what you
[1:28:56] want me to do no matter how much money
[1:28:57] or little money I do
[1:29:00] make now Brothers you want to supply for
[1:29:03] your children that's the main thing you
[1:29:05] want to do you want to provide for your
[1:29:06] wife and
[1:29:07] children but not in the way you want to
[1:29:10] do it in the way God is guiding you to
[1:29:12] it because the footsteps of the
[1:29:13] righteous are order of the Lord so don't
[1:29:17] don't don't try to imagine that's what
[1:29:18] the that's what the false prophets did
[1:29:19] the Old Testament they imagine
[1:29:21] prophecies they imagine visions of their
[1:29:22] own selves we don't want to do that we
[1:29:25] don't have to imagine God already has a
[1:29:27] plan for us God already has a perfect
[1:29:29] path for us he is the way the truth and
[1:29:31] the life he is the way we should walk
[1:29:32] for our
[1:29:34] lives I'm closing therefore let no man
[1:29:38] Glory or boast in men for all things are
[1:29:40] yours see that's what we got to be
[1:29:41] careful oh this brother preaches message
[1:29:43] and oh that brother oh that brother that
[1:29:45] brother that brother make sure you're
[1:29:48] boasting on
[1:29:52] Christ see that that that that that's
[1:29:55] the trouble in the church here oh
[1:29:56] they're bragging on Peter bragging on
[1:29:58] Paul bragging on Apollos they should
[1:29:59] have been bragging on
[1:30:01] Christ ever see
[1:30:03] that don't glory in
[1:30:06] men for all for in other words these
[1:30:09] gifts were they're for you this is this
[1:30:11] this was to benefit you but don't give
[1:30:13] them too much Glory don't give them
[1:30:15] don't boast on them remember these are
[1:30:17] God's servants these are God's gifts to
[1:30:19] the whole body of Christ whether Paul or
[1:30:22] Apollos or sephus or the world or life
[1:30:25] or death or things present or things to
[1:30:27] come all are yours think about that this
[1:30:30] is all given for us for our good that we
[1:30:32] would love Jesus Christ everything in
[1:30:34] this world was given right our life even
[1:30:37] death death was given so we could go we
[1:30:39] could separate from this world into the
[1:30:40] Heavenly World Hallelujah all these
[1:30:42] things are for your good but give the
[1:30:45] credit to God give the glory to Jesus
[1:30:48] Christ and you are Christ and I love he
[1:30:51] ends with a headship and Christ is
[1:30:55] gods in other words we will see our
[1:30:57] savior we'll see Jesus but we'll never
[1:30:59] see the father is it but that what a
[1:31:02] what an assurance that is we get to see
[1:31:04] the one who died for us we get to see
[1:31:06] the one who raised for us amen we get to
