Lord and we love you be with us in a special way tonight in Jesus Christ's name every said Amen god bless yous being seated there praise God so let's maokai can switch over when you're ready buddy let's finish up the church ages here tonight I'm really happy to almost finished by the grace Lord is really encouraging on Monday we had the day off from school cuz I did my work early made a profession of Elvan days I got to come to the church and finish reading the whole book I realize I'm down to about one or two sermons so we're grateful for that and happy to preach what God commissioned our prophet to preach amen so part 11 this is of the Laodicean Church age parts part 58 rather of the entire series so I want to look at the consummation of the Gentile ages tonight and I want to eventually get to Azusa Street I want to look at what happened at a zoo zoo Street to show you that God is gonna make us ready for the rapture we are gonna have a great idea we're gonna have a great leading when we when the rapture takes place we will have where the bride will have a strong knowledge that the rapture is soon to happen I know a lot of people are saying it now especially to people that I've got a couple emails this weekend and texts from different people saying oh the rapture Californians gonna sink soon and all these things but but really I think they're all predictions you know and I'll explain why in a little bit but let's just go through this here the consummation now I I preached on this a couple weeks ago but I'm just gonna go over this again quickly because this is the last two sections of the the church age book chapter on Laodicea this age is the last of the seven Church ages what began the first or Ephesian age must and will come to full fruition and harvest in the last or Laodicean age the two vines will yield their final fruit the two spirits will terminate their manifestation in each of their final destinations the sowing the watering the growing is all over summer's end of the sickle is now thrust in the harvest so brother Branham ends this chapter by saying everything at the end time is going to be the final final expression of whatever spirits behind us so if we're the wise virgin we're gonna express the final manifestation at the wise virgin will manifest whoever's foolish virgin they will manifest the final the mature foolish virgin right whoever is the false church the Judas the tares they will manifest the the full fruit of a tear it's coming down to the very ending of it and so we went through this a couple weeks back but the Prophet said in verses 15 to 18 in chapter 3 we have the true picture of the ripened false vine the false church the false spirit as well and this was the the true picture of a mature tear so now we know what a true tear their spiritual life is gonna look like this it's gonna look like a life that has works that are neither hot nor cold they can't they can't they can't just be hot all the time but they're not just cold all the time they're lukewarm he said because you're lukewarm neither hot nor cold I spew thee out of my mouth so in tear churches around terror individuals they'll not be speaking for God anymore they won't have the authority of the word they'll be saying some things that of course come out of the word because it's they have to be deceptive you don't have to have some some something that resembles the word but they're not going to be speaking for God anymore so the Holy Spirit will not be speaking through the tears of course they won't be speaking at all with the word for this hour now here is the the most striking thing this is what we've got to watch out I think this is a this is the easiest way for us to know where we are with God if the words that are coming out of our mouths and the action of our lives if they're saying I don't have need of more of God I've got all that I need I've got the money I need I've got the goods all everything at my home I've got everything I need at my house and I don't really have no more need of God anymore I don't and this also implies the works I I don't have to do anything more for God remember how brother Branham was always saying I want to do more for God you know the the false church doesn't have that they feel like they've done enough for God they're happy with what they've done for God but a real broad number once they keep doing more for God their works should be continually growing and abounding and and manifesting they should have a need to do more for God so their very life is gonna be saying I've arrived III know what I am I don't need to to draw closer to God but Jesus says your wretched miserable poor blind and naked this is a mature tear someone that's really come to maturity as a tear I'm lukewarm sometimes I'm hot sometimes I'm cold all right I'm right in the middle I just can't go to one side or the other and I don't have more need of God and that's where we've got to watch our lives because the Prophet said there's no more bitter rebuke for a more proud or arrogant religious people so that's the biggest rebuke you could ever receive is that your poor wretched miserable blind and naked and don't know in other words you don't know the condition that's your and that's the worst rebuke you could possibly have so Church it behooves us to come to church and really ask God Lord what condition am I am show me my true condition praise the Lord I know that simple but that if we can have that and know where we truly stand with God then we can be sure we're not a tear because the tear doesn't know they can't eat they can't even see their true condition they think they're right with God but Jesus says you don't even know all these things so we need to know what condition were in and we can note by looking at the word so in the same in the same text we hear the most bitter rebuke but also the most highest compliment ever paid to a humble steadfast group this is the compliment because you've overcome later to see a as I overcame which is quoting the word you'll sit down with me in my Father's throne in other words the Millennium you'll sit with me in the Millennium and of Cour - future home there's so along with the worst bitter rebuke right alongside that to the age you have the highest compliment ever paid to a spiritual people Amen oh my so you have the law of contrasts right just like day and night right hot and cold you have these same things and it's a beautiful picture to see now brother branham brings us back to this harvest thought so he gives us two scriptures he gives us Matthew 3:11 and 12 where John the Baptist is talking about Jesus coming to baptize with the Holy Ghost whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire so this is now Christ in his true relationship to the true church and the false church and Jesus is ready to burn the tares but he's ready to harvest the wheat off the earth amen this is the harvest this is the final fruit at the end of the age well Aram said Christ the heart great harvesters now reaping the fruit of the earth he gathers the wheat into the garner by coming for his own and receiving them for ever unto himself then he returns to destroy the wicked with unquenchable fire also he gives us another scripture about the harvest time he said the mystery of the tares in of wheat of Matthew 13:24 2:30 is now fulfilled and I'm not gonna read that because we've we know that we're pretty familiar with that the wheat and tares which from the first age until now I've grown side by side are harvested what Nicaea set out to accomplish has finally come to pass with all the might of organization now here look at this at the end this is important the false church turns from any vestige of truth and with political might reinforces herself with state backing and sets out to eradicate forever the true believer so right before the rapture the false church will turn from all truth and now they have a hateful murder this Esau spirit and Ishmael murderous mocking spirit right at the end up until then they're going to look pretty close it's going to be so close to deceive the very elect but right at the end time they're going to turn from all their truth and they're going to be murderers right before the end and just when she's about to accomplish her cowardly plot the wheat is gathered into the garner amen no longer will the wheat and tares grow side by side no longer will the tares receive of the blessing of God because the friends of the wheat for the wheat will be gone and the wrath of God will be poured out in the sixth seal which will end in the utter destruction of the wicked now I said a moment ago that the false vine came into full fruition in this age her fruit would mature and ripen that's correct this evil spirited church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into a tree wherein lodged the fowls of the air at her head will be the Antichrist and Mister of iniquity all this is true so I want to revisit this remember the parable jesus said he said the kingdom of heaven is likened a grain of mustard seed now some people think that's faith but the Prophet tells us that's actually not it actually represents the false church which a man took and sowed in his field which indeed is the least of all seeds but when it's grown it is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof so the Prophet tells us this is not the true church this is actually the false church and so notice all of the seeds brought forth the greatest herb a full I'm sorry the least of all the seeds brought forth the greatest herb a full tree it's so large that birds come and Lodge there which reminds us of the little lying Tonka knows a great fire the littlest produces the greatest so see the littlest sin produces the greatest result the greatest destruction so we see that same idea the smallest mustard seed produces a great tree with all the birds the Ollis lie in Ephesus produces the Antichrist Jezebel system at the end and notice birds plural always mention eat always represent evil spirits in the Bible because when Abraham Abraham had to push the birds off of his sacrifice and mother BAM said those Abraham casting off demons so that's in Abraham in Genesis 15 revelation 18 the Roman Catholic Church was full of a cage of unclean and hateful bird so birds many birds always represents many demons but one bird the Dove always represents the holy ghost so hope that's clear that might be strange to some people I know it was strange when I first read it but as you study the scripture it's right so this this false church must come to maturity and they'll produce their final fruit now if this is true then it must be also true that the bride church will mature and her ripeness shall be an identification with her Lord by means of the word and her head who will come to her is the mystery of godliness which indeed is Christ and as the false church with all cunning and diabolical power made up a political force physical force and demons of Darkness come against the true vine the true vine with the fullness of the Spirit and the word will do the very acts of power that Jesus did so just as they're getting full political and satanic power will be getting full Holy Ghost power amen because they're coming to maturity they're coming to the end their final manifestation they're coming to their maturity so the we can expect if our lives are true with the baptism of the Holy Ghost will have more spirit and more word whereas the false church will have less word and more deception then as she knew their headstone becoming like him through the word Jesus will come that the bride and groom made forever be united as one hallelujah already the visible manifestations of what I've been telling you are seen all around us the ecumenical move the tears is factual and I just saw it again I saw a video this week of a man who is friends with Kenneth Copeland that's the one I forgot a few weeks ago who's very popular now I forget his name anyways he's praying it in the service and he's praying that the the ecumenical move will unite and he's saying he's praying for the spirit of tongues to pour out upon the Catholics and everybody goes to crying and shouting and speaking in tongues and and and I said that's exactly the ecumenical move we're talking about don't get me wrong church sometimes when I'm here praying I'm praying that God will save people on the Catholic Church I'm sighing and crying for the abomination than the city but I'm not praying for them to speak in tongues and join our organization I'm praying for them to come out of organization but they're saying let tongues come to the kind of church that's not what they need they need a tongue of saying I'm wrong I repent I'm Salus to repent that's the tongue they need amen I'm wrong and I've got to come out of organization and I've got to come into Christ the word amen so it's closed that's why it's so close it would deceive the very elect afore possible they're crying and and they want they want tongues that go so in other words in other words they want to proselyte does every understand what I'm saying they want to preside they want their Creed to go to the Catholic Church we want them to leave their Creed and come to Christ that's the great difference and notice both groups have all kinds of money so it's a it's always said watch it's always centered around money and politics and power watch money and power it's factual but it's also a fact that the profit from the last age must be bringing forth a message from God that will forerun the second coming of Lord for by his message will the hearts of the children be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers and with the restoration the word will come the restoration of power Amen that's what I believe is happening today by the grace of the Lord but I believe like brother Bram said I believe we're going to need a little more persecution to bring forth all the power because our lives are just too comfortable you and I know we know when we get down and desperate with God and we get sincere and alls we do is meditate upon God we know super supernatural things happen but often the way we battle here and Laodicea it almost takes like rubber and preach it almost takes desperation to bring out the supernatural our lives but see we got it we got to be patient we got to work with God we got to let God work with us we got to be humble we got to stay as close to God as we possibly can we know that now I'm gonna get now any closer to where I want to go pretty soon you know like I said I'll try to watch my time here what crucial times are these which we live in how careful we must be to remain true to this word and not take from it or add to it for he who would speak where God has not spoken makes him a liar what I have been particularly in mind is this about the turn of the century the hunger for God that was generated in the Philadelphia Age brought forth a cry for the Spirit of God if there's one thing I want the church to learn and myself is that we need to come and pray for more of the Holy Spirit that's really all that's really all we need to do it's come together and pray and believe God I believe prayer before service is the most when the most important things outside of praying at your home in other words I think the most important thing is praying for more of God I believe that with all my heart because the Bible says when you pray in the spirit it raises your faith so remember so now let's go back to Sousa this is where I want to go and I got a lot of details about azuz I was doing some I was watching a video about on Monday about the turn of the century the hunger for God that was generated in the Philadelphia Age brought forth the cry for the Spirit of God because remember that all kinds of teaching it isn't that seen what we got like now which is okay we got a lot of teaching but as we get the teaching the teaching should point us that we need power we need more power like I said with through desperation will help us cry out for power but I believe the same things gonna happen as we have teaching and more of the word more of the word it should point us to the fact that we need more supernatural and it will bring forth a cry for the Spirit of God and when the cry was answered by God sending forth manifestation and tongues interpretation and prophecy a group immediately in most contrary to the word drew up a doctor that tongues was the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost tongues were far from the evidence I want you to know this too when I went back and I I watch this video another the the what's it called it's this documentary that's the word I'm thinking I want to documentary on Azusa Street on Monday it was about an hour long and it had all the references so it looked really like it was a good a good video but a few things about that William Seymore the man who started the revival his doctrine was initial evidence I don't know if he knew that boo and we'll get to this in a little bit but he was actually from Houston Texas and one of the sisters from out what a woman passed her out in Los Angeles heard about his ministry she must have been traveling I forget the exact details but she sent a letter and said I feel that of the Holy Spirit to invite you to come preach at our church well he came he preached for a week and she found out he believed in tongues as Evans she kicked him out of the church so he got kicked out of the very church he was invited to preach at and he had no job now give you a little more background the churches in Los Angeles there was like 200 some churches they've been praying for three to four years history said for the move of the Holy Ghost what does that tell us it means that we've got to start praying for the move of the Holy Ghost in other words a supernatural revival thank God for what we thank God for the Holy Spirit that falls on us now thank God for that it keeps us from week to week but when we talk about revival it's like a full commitment of our lives everybody the church getting everything foolish out of their lives and just a delight in serving God that's what they were so in California they prayed for that for three or four years before Seymour came I want you to see that so this thought was already this false doctrine was already in Seymour's doctrine will say like that it was already in his bag you know his preaching bag or whatever you know but now when the Holy Ghost fell everything was by the word but then people after that denominated and so that's what brother I'm saying they sensed my this is the last age they felt the coming of Lord was nigh and so they started crying out for more of God and look God answered how many know that if you cry out God's gonna answer your prayer hallelujah but see we got a we got a labor though they labor that's really got to be our heart's desire to see the supernatural to see more of God we really got to pray for it we really got to believe it now I'm gonna jump ahead now this is from chapter 10 which I haven't preached yet it's called the resume but he again talks about Azusa Street now watch this this is what I said earlier this age started just before the turn of the twentieth century as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost we know that there must be of necessity be a return of dynamic power and in their testimony when that Holy Ghost fell it actually didn't fall on his oozin Street first it fell on some one ERA some other Street and then they moved the meetings to his ooza Street I don't know if you knew that they started the Holy Ghost actually fell in a person of the Argan Bright House I forget the street it was it wasn't on his ooze the street once it got so big though they moved it to Azusa Street okay but it started in house prayer meetings so this is going to give us some clues about the coming of Lord that's how the church started an axe you remember the Bible said they went from house to house breaking bread when we get so hung that's that's I believe these are all clues as we approach the coming of the Lord when we get so hungry for God that we want to meet in people's houses all the time I think there'll be a good clue or ready for the coming of the Lord because that's what happened at Pentecost that's what happened when the Holy Ghost fell to Zuza Street they got so hungry for God they couldn't wait to go to church on Wednesday so they had Church on Monday night at somebody's house Oh hallelujah the believers at least or here's what I look at just for a moment the believer sense this they sense that this is the last age we've got to come back to Pentecost where they sense it in their spirits right because we know some of them not all of them but some of them just got the baptism the Holy Ghost on their spirit and not the soul the ones who went into the organization wrote up initial evidence you've got to speak in tongues or you're going to hell those people didn't get the Holy Ghost in their soul they just got it in their spirit are you with me the people that stayed out of that just stayed free and we want the Holy Ghost and we want all these gifts to operate by the Holy Ghost we don't believe in that initial evidence they actually had it in their souls so I'm showing you two differences here not just in their spirits only with evidence or we just want tongues we just want tongues we just want to but we just want God amen we just want the Holy Ghost we just want all nine gifts of the Holy Ghost amen this is who it fell in their souls but with those who denominated it just fell in their spirits because the denomination is of the devil denomination is Antichrist so the whole they didn't get it in the soul if they organized with the Antichrist spirit because organization is cutting off the Holy Ghost saying we're not going any farther you've got to speak in tongues that's Antichrist because it's making a man-made Creed it's a tradition of man so see when they could sense if they could sense the beginning of the age can't we sense the end of the age glory what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long the way to restoration it was not for the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain so they thought it was the latter rain that's my brother Branham had to rebuke the latter rain brethren remember that latter rain movement I think it started in Canada if I'm not mistaken brother Branham had to rebuke that because they were saying it was latter rain let brother have said in the church age it was former rain right brother Mannis ministry was the former rain so see we we want a census in our spirit now listen Noah sent in his spirit that judgment was soon to come so he started working building an ark for the for God but before this enoch sense in his spirit that there's going to be a rapture so i better walk with God praise the Lord at Jesus's first coming Simeon and Anna were praying and fasting constantly in the temple of God and they're the only ones in the temple that caught that this was the Messiah because they were in constant contact with the Holy Spirit amen they sensed it then the spiritual sense of mine this is an important time something's happening something's going on and that's why I say Church you and I will sense the rapture not by guessing dates but by prayer and close communion with Christ in other words prayer and fasting because the Bible said Ana ministered for what was 80 years something like 80 or 70 or 60 years with prayer and fasting in the temple and she was one of the few that actually knew that this baby was the Messiah because the Bible said Simeon came out and said that and then also Anna wasn't sure with everybody else in the temple because member Simeon was back there praying the Holy Ghost said you'll not die until you see the Lord's Christ one of these days the Holy Ghost is going to tell somebody you're not going to die til you see Jesus in the air amen they're gonna sense it in their spirit because they're fully committed to the Word of the hour it's going to happen now let me go back this I got two things I want to share I forgot when I said I preached this two Sundays ago let me go back to this just something came on my heart I was reading this on Monday remember I believe somebody on Facebook is just making a big mistake they're just trying to guess at the dates here's how they're guessing at the rapture do you remember this when I preaches this year is Israel's Jubilee year at 70 years now the first thing wrong a Jubilee is not after 70 years it's after 50 and I went back and read that this week I was like whoa that was wrong as well a Jubilee is not after 70 but you believes after 50 I'm sorry the Jubilee is the 50th that's after 49 the next year after 49 is 50 50s the Jubilee and so see there they're guessing they're putting Jubilee mixing up with 70 which was Daniels well I'm sorry no the 70 years in Babylon right Israel seven years in Babylon with Daniel down there and then see Billy Graham left the scenes to the they're mixing up all these different thoughts and they're guessing at the coming of the Lord and so see they're saying okay because it's the Jubilee year which is not 70 because it's Jubilee Billy Graham's just left now the 144,000 have to be born again they're just guessing and I'll say like this they got the wrong date now you say another thought this came to my mind too is I was back there praying in my office there I want to say this too the second thought I had the to sense it in our spirit as we pray and fast now how many know this how many know that the Oral Roberts University has a chapel and they pray 24 hours a day how many know that did you know that when Oral Roberts built that one of his desires was to have a 24-hour prayer chain where they take an hour at a time the students will come in there go pray for an hour and as soon as they leave somebody else comes in and 24 hours around the clock they're praying now that's a good thing Church but let me ask you even though they're praying 24 hours a day are they going to sense the rapture as far as the bride is concerned no they can because they transgress the Word of God they let women paint their face cut their hair is that men preach false doctrine Creed's a man they beg for money they're in politics right they're involved with politics and and all these sports and everything like March Madness or Roberts teams make it to there it's all about the so they have all this emphasis on natural things instead of spiritual things so see even though and I want to make sure you say that make sure you understand that even at with 24 hours of Prayer if they never yield to the word the prayer is good but it's not going to get them anywhere you got a watch and pray you have to have spirit and truth they'll have all the Spirit praying and they'll speak in tongues and all Roberts you know and the Holy Spirit will anoint them but when it comes back to acknowledging the word they turn that down so they're not going to sense the rapture but man so the rapture is going to go and they're not even gonna know what happened so I want to make sure we balance that out that you know we could we could feel bad like well we're not praying 24 hours a day well we don't have to pray 24 hours a day we I mean we should pray without ceasing in our spirits but see we've got to pray and then hear what the spirits saying amen they're praying and not hearing what the spirits say they're praying and hearing what the university saying are you think oh we got to build a new football facility we got to build new that's what they're hearing they're praying and getting anointing for good times and merit and feeling good and all those great things those are great dude great to be healed great to get salvation but when it comes down to well she women preach or not you know they don't hear what the spirit saying so but like both have said would bathe them they're gonna take God's second word God's gonna say don't preach well the women will keep praying then got to say okay preach and brother have said I don't doubt at all that God told those women to preach but it was in his first word hey uh yeah I don't doubt God told Joyce Meyer to preach but it wasn't his first word that he told her it's impossible because that's not his perfect will so do you understand that those two examples people in the message guessing which is I mean that's that's fine if they want to guess but I don't think that's the way to go about it I think the thing to do is pray and fast and say Lord is this your time if so get me ready help me to sense it in your in your spirit help me to feel your spirit in my spirit not guess and try to place it together that's not what we want to do the rapture won't be a guessing game it'll be a closer walk with Christ because that's what Enoch was he just got closer and closer till one day God said do you want to come a little bit higher today tell your wife goodbye tell your family goodbye he was the friend of God and we want to be God's friend amen I believe that with all my heart sure it's gonna come that way if they sense the beginning of the church age will sense the end of the church age will be feeling more of a burden for the word more of a burden for prayer more of a burden for all these spiritual things will be feeling that at the coming of the Lord we have to because that's what Enoch experienced that's what everybody experienced remember didn't didn't uh he lied you know there he said watch me today if you see me today and catch my garment you'll get a double portion he knew the time of the rapture he meant he knew his rapture was coming amen he sensed it God had let him know somehow God is gonna let us sense the rapture of the church absolutely now let's look at the history again Azusa with MC Moore from Houston just bided to come pastor in Los Angeles by woman pastors Nene Lord in February of 1906 that watch is February March April May three months before the Holy Ghost fell now yours before the churches were praying continually for the power of the Spirit like I said three or four years one week after preaching about tongues and the woman's church he was kicked out of the church and this is the source if you want to watch it it's a really good really reverent video except they keep pushing evidence of tongues evidence evidence evidence but I just ignore that that's nonsense I'm glad I'm glad they want supernatural but the you can't major on a minor and they can't make false doctrine now as soon as he got kicked out William Seymore accepted an invitation to stay with Edward S Lee he was one of that woman's woman pastors and congregation members one of the laity so he felt bad for the preacher that got kicked out he said you can come stay with me too you find a job they didn't know what to do so they just began praying fervently they didn't know what to do and isn't that amazing when there's nowhere else to go what's the last choice prayer what should be our first choice prayer but let me ask you this was that woman let her Lord to invite him out yes because his preaching was going to create such a hunger for the Holy Ghost that for three months the Holy Ghost would fall in a great way now from what the the documentary said other believers heard of this devotion of Prayer and joined Seymour was praying five to seven hours a day now he wasn't working Church Lee Edward Lee wood the history said he would pray like about a couple hours and then get up and go to work at a printing shop I think he worked at but he would let a seymour stay there and pray in his house and the prayer meeting moved to the Asbury house and this is where the Holy Ghost fell at the Asbury house so they were he was preaching and praying preaching pray he realized I need more prayer he didn't have enough they did not have enough power of prayer so he has to his friends from Houston to join his prayer meetings and they agreed he imagined traveling across the state just to come and pray for the Holy Ghost see this is the kind of dedication and sacrifice we want to see in our lives right where people are hungry to pray where people are hungry for the Holy Ghost to fall that's how I was telling my wife you know what I said and hope everybody understand it's like with the church building fund I think that's a good thing I think that's okay but I said if I have the choice I want to see people more hungry for praying for the Holy Ghost than for praying for a church building which I think it's good to have a building and I think that's fine but I think I think our church will do will be best to really hunger and pray for the Holy Ghost to fall and I'm not saying people are praying for a building I'm not saying that I'm just saying of it if there's more excitement for a building than there is praying for the Holy Ghost before service something's wrong right are you with me Church does that make sense if people like I said when I miss the denominations I are the oneness Pentecostals they're clapping louder for church building than they offer the Holy Ghost I don't want that to happen here I want us to pray more for the Holy Ghost than praying for saving for a church building because I got plenty of room here you know I personally don't I told back I said I personally don't want a building because I'm happy with what we got now and now if we all grow this building sure they made will by building but I just said well brother vague I'll just throw my vote in with you if you want it I'm the other trustee when I got into trustees I said how I'll throw my vote in with you like that's what brother Branham did he said the people want to build on the tabernacle I'll throw my vote in with you but the whole point behind this is that they were hungry for the Holy Ghost to fall and that's what we've got to be hungry for the Spirit of God to move that's right so they entered a season of prayer from February to April on April 6 seymour asked them to fast and pray for 10 days why because Acts chapter 2 right it was the day of Pentecost they were praying in the upper room for 10 days so William Seymore there's the leading the Bible study to lean the prairies he said who will join me for prayer and fasting and he had about you know five or six people that was said okay will praying fast for 10 days I don't know if they you know what eat when the Sun went down I don't know I'm not sure how they did that but I know you got to eat and drink a little bit you know unless there's a supernatural anointing where you don't have to eat or drink like Jesus but most normal people have to do that now I said three days later so only three days into the 10-day commitment Seymour was preaching on acts 2:4 and the Holy Ghost fell unknown tongues were spoken interpreted into English and the one testimony of Seymour's wife at this time when the Holy Ghost felt they weren't married yet but the woman that was going to be his wife afraid her name Jenny ER I think was Jenny young or something she said the Holy Ghost Strucker she fell off her chair sorry and then he she said the Holy Ghost led her to the piano and she started playing piano and singing and never he'd even practiced piano in her whole life amen and this was all because they sense this was the last Church age oh I wonder what's gonna happen when we come down to the coming of the Lord this was this wasn't done in public this was a small private show this light brother Adam said they met he said it won't be a public show so she falls over she gets up she goes over starts singing in the Holies what does the Holy Ghost 1 the Holy Ghost wants your worship the Holy Ghost wants you to praise him but I like the seat and that's what I told you before all the history says that when the Holy Ghost fell yes it was unknown tongues but then the interpretations came behind it so it was the genuine Holy Ghost and all the people that were true to God they kept the tongues in order they never made tongues the initial evidence but when it fell it genuinely fell it was the true Holy Ghost that fell at his oozy Street well the has Barry House on whatever Street it was but you know what I'm talking about now neighbors gather to see what was going on the preach porch meetings lasted for three days and three nights and after that they moved to this church on his uu Street the services went on for three years seven days a week three times a day and did you know the history said they never announced who was going to preach at all three services they would just pray until God anointed oh man or woman another see that was off the word then to go up and preach and you know William Seymour you know what he did he took two peach baskets and he you know how you have a peach basket he stood them up on their side he put two up on their side he put his knees in the first basket and his head in the second basket in the corner so he was over like this in the corner praying and he would pray like that until the service got started and then he knew who was gonna preach or if he was letting the Lord to preach that he would go up there that's how much he was willing to humble himself he stuck his head and knees in a peach basket to humble himself then the Bible say that Moses was the meekest man on the earth that's why people loved William Seymore he was so humble the people said he was just like a child when you talked to him he had such joy for the Lord and he was always just you know being humble to pray about that you know hard to see what Lord leads me to do he wasn't quick to guess and he wasn't guessing he wanted to pray and make sure got the answer from the Lord what a humble servant Lord three years seven days a week three services a day and that if you were if you recall the Welshman wrote well survival does anyone ever study that I preached on it years ago I think was in 2008 I preached on it the Welsh revival with Evan Roberts he was a white man over in Wales and he God led him to start a revival the same thing happened the revival he went on for about three or four years that's what brother man instead of a revival last three or four years and then he so wore himself out Evan Roberts that he had to be bedridden for a couple of years because he put so much energy and so much of his human effort into the meetings he almost wore himself out he died an early death because he was so into prayer so into the things of God he wore himself out for the kingdom of God now does that help by God's grace they sense that the Holy Ghost was going to fall so they went praying for it for three or four years and then they got really dedicated to prayer and so I wonder Church I wonder if that's gonna happen before the end time oh my if they could sense the beginning we are going to sense the end praise the Lord mother may have said tongues were manifestation but not the evidence going back to the Zuzu Street the falsity of the doctrine cannot only be seen by a lack of scripture to substantiate it but those who subscribe to the doctrine immediately organize on the basis of the doctrine proving they were not in the truth as they would have people to believe oh it looked good it looked like the return of Pentecost but it proved it wasn't it could not be for organiz organized that is death not life it looks so close to the real that multitudes were deceived now the genuine what was it it was the husk the chaff in the green soft sheath form it looked like it was the real thing but as one can go into the field and see what the hut I'm sorry what looks exactly like wheat and yet is only the husk for the wheat seed has not yet formed so this was but the soft shell that looked like the real grain yet to come the original wheat seed of Pentecost was come back in the last stage it had been buried at man I'm sorry Nicaea it set up a shoot at sardis it grew a tassel philadelphia it was too mature a layer to sia but it could not be back to the original until the word was restored the Prophet had not yet come upon the scene now one thing that's interesting too is William Seymore didn't receive the Holy Ghost until the third day of the revival so jenny received it a Edouard guy received it different ones received it and he stuck around the revival until he received the baptism of Holy Ghost I thought my the the preacher himself didn't receive the Holy Ghost the first night and what does that tell us we got a stay with God's Word stay with the revival if you see people the holy spirit fought on people just hang around them pretty soon if you're faithful pretty soon if you keep seeking God it's gonna fall on you too yes amen that's exactly right the thing is people get discouraged as oh maybe God doesn't want to fill me maybe God wants to God promised amen for those who are baptized in Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but we got to stay with it amen God may be testing our faith praise the Lord but now according to the time where do we stand in the lair of scene age the Prophet messenger of revelation 10 7 must already be in the land once more thus saith the Lord must be here ready to be manifested with infallible vindication this is the true seed already maturing and then the harvest so see they'll say at the Lord when we hear brother Branham say that when we preach that that's going to bring us to a harvest because it's God's word harvest yes harvest time the two vines that grew together and intertwine their branches are now to be separated the fruits of those vines were which were at such variance will be gathered into separate Garner's the two spirits will go to their separate destinations now it is time to heed the final call that comes only to the wheat bride come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that ye wheat received not her tears or plagues the great tribulation of the 6co Matthew 24 can you say Amen all right the last warning of the spear so this is actually the section where the chapter ends so I think I'm gonna get there by God's grace then we're gonna finish with this tonight the last warning of the Holy Spirit we this was our text tonight he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches this is the last warning there will not be another the throne room has been set up this beautiful the twelve foundations have been laid the streets of gold had been paved the gates of gigantic pearls are raised and hinged together like a pyramid she stands so fair and glorious the heavenly beings who have prepared her watch breathlessly for she glistens and shines with a glory that is unearthly every facet of her beauty tells a story of amazing grace in Jesus love she is a city prepared for a prepared people she waits only her inhabitants and soon they will throng her streets with joy yes it is the last call the Spirit will not speak in another tongue I'm sorry it was not speaking another age the ages are over in that striking right now they're saying build the wall build the wall build the wall right but up in heaven the walls are actually being built the gates are actually going up why because they can sense the anointing of the hour hallelujah thank you Jesus that heavenly City is being constructed the walls are being placed up the foundations are being built up and the people can sense that something's being built but thank God at this moment the age is not over he is yet crying and his cries not only in the spiritual ears of men by his spirit but once again a prophet is in the land course brother Brennan once more God will reveal the truth as he did to Paul in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of later seen age its messenger reveal the mysteries of God has revealed to Paul he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the benefit effect of that prophets ministry how many lives have been benefitted by the ministry brother Branham mine has tremendously been benefited by the ministry brother Branham and they that hear him will be blessed and become part of the bride of the last day were mentioned in revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come the corn of wheat the bride wheat that fell into the ground that Nicaea has come back to original word grain again praise God forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in the last age what he says from God the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing hallelujah Jesus and what they say will have been already said in the Word of God Oh hallelujah that's why I love I can preach a series on the church ages I can bridge a series on the wisdom of God I can preach a series on Ephesians because I know whatever is in the word the Spirit is going to be saying with the right interpretation that's right now what one thing we're gonna be saying and what they will be saying is already said the word that we saying come out from among or now and be separate the cries gone out the cries going out how long with a voice cry we do not know but one thing we do know it won't be long or this is the last age does that help by the grace of Lord that's beautiful the spirit and the bride say come so we know one of our last messages will be going to the denomination saying come out of denominations and come in be separate from denominations and come into Christ and you remember what was Abraham's last call Abraham's last call was for lot to come out of Sodom right that was his last prayer his last intercession the holy spirit was Lord bring out lot don't destroy the righteous with the wicked let's stay in our feet this is the last slide here because then brother I'm just gives the pledge he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches the Spirit has spoken the Setting Sun is about to fade into eternity for the church ages then it will all be over then it will be too late to come but if somewhere in this series God has dealt with you by his Spirit may you even now turn to him and repentance and give your life to him that by his Spirit he may give you eternal life hey man what a way to end the chapter there hear what the Spirit is saying receive eternal life and then brother Branham at the end of the sermon I must get past him and he's here I got a couple more and then the server gives a pledge brother Graham tells his church when he should make a pledge to God to constantly seek and wait for the Holy Ghost what were they doing in Los Angeles before Azusa Street they were saying God send the Holy Ghost God send the Holy Ghost God sends supernatural power if you get tired of praying for the Holy Ghost you've got the wrong spirit because that's what they had at the beginning the age and that's what we're gonna have at the end of the age this cry for we need the more of the Holy Ghost we need God to fall we want the supernatural power of God we want the Word of God amen so brother Adams he's tying the church at the end of this whole series in 1960 he said Teddy play there's a fountain filled with blood now friends that's standing on your feet you're trying to accept the sweetness the Lord Jesus the same Bible that tells us that these things would happen broth in the past just exactly the way he promised now the promise Peter says unto you your children then as far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call you see that because you want the blessing of God on you honey what the blessing of God on them every day I want the blessing of God and as a servant I pray for you I'll pray that God will give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I wonder if you could do this in your heart if you're sincere if you would make this promise to God what a what a request in other words would you make a vow to God would you make a promise to God he says God I from this time standing on my feet seeking this baptism the Holy Ghost I shall constantly pray and wait until you fill me with the Holy Ghost he said will you make that promise to God by raising your hands hey man he said I will constantly pray constantly until you fill me with the sweetness and goodness of the Spirit amen brother man said I offer my prayer for you now as we bow our heads now here's this prayer how many father they are the trophies of your presence they know that these words are true because they're yours they know that you have been given I'm sorry they've been given by the Holy Spirit because they are the Word of God and they have been convinced that they need you that they need the sweet the Holy Spirit in our life to give them over coming power and they will receive power from on high receive the power to live a Christian life to receive power to overcome temptations amen glory as a song was just singing they gathered up a room was praying his name there are baptized with the Holy Ghost and power for church service came that's what they want power for service to come upon them I pray the Father as your servant as the you see them raised in their hands that they have made a pledge to you and a promise that they shall never cease they'll not lay it aside but they will pray until you fill them Lord to a satisfying portion of thy holy presence in their life I offer my prayer in their behalf Lord as your servant that they will be filled with the Holy Ghost lord I pray that they'll not leave this church until that happens and that they'll be right here until each soul is filled with the Holy Ghost Granite Lord and that's my last slide because next time I'm gonna preach on the resume Lord willing we'll look at that by the grace of God how many appreciate that prayer by brother Branham and I think it matches like I said I think it matches at the beginning of the age they were so hungry for the supernatural and here at the end of the age brother branham prays the same thing God may they just pray for more of the Holy Ghost more supernatural may they not get complacent in their walk with God may they just pledge to always seek for more of the Holy Ghost how many think that's a good thing to pray tonight I think it's a good thing to pray every night and I want to end the service by praying that let's pray it for ourselves let's pray for others especially the children think about that like brother man there's a quote brother Branham says that if one of these children here or the ones who aren't here if their name is on the last book of life the rapture can't go until they're born again and so we'll keep having church we'll keep having preached okay we'll keep doing all these things until every last soul has been born again amen and they have the blessing that we've experienced they men the power of God upon and that's why I bring my children up here every Sunday morning I bring them up here I pray for them that God would fill them with the Holy Ghost I'll say like this like those churches in Los Angeles I'll keep praying for 3 or 4 years until God does it I'm not gonna quit I'm not gonna give up on God why because I know God's got a time and season and I know this if there's a deep call in my heart to see all these fill with all he goes there's got to be a deep to respond how do you a men and there's a deep call for us to start the church and then God has people here in Accra that need a church we didn't even know it there hadn't been a deep to respond hallelujah like sister Naomi and sister Connie and all these Saints here in Akron if there's a deep call for seven people to start the church and now we're up to a twenty adults and 21 22 kids there hadn't been a deed to respond that's the same thing that's in my soul to see people fill with the Holy Ghost if there's a deep desire of mine to see them build with the Holy Ghost there's got to be a Holy Ghost to respond to it hey man and there's a deep golfer by the Adam who want to go out to the the fairs out there the flea markets and and win assault of Christ there's got to be a deep to respond brother hallelujah it's exactly right amen and I was looking back at my uh my pictures and I saw a picture of in this in the in August in August of 2014 with brother Brooks and I went out into the parks and we witnessed and we made these signs I still got in the back of my car we are if we are praying for souls in a park we were singing and clapping and he had the tambourine out we had signs are you ready for the rapture and church it was just a few months after that the brother a man came in I saw I saw that from there so see we were so hungry we had to go out we had to do something for a soul and got it and God didn't save us so in that exact outreach but God sent us all a few months later by the grace of the Lord see there's got to be a deep to respond if you're hungry for fish and you go fishing there's got to be fish out there okay you might not get it on the first day but you're gonna get fish eventually I don't want to see fish in Akron more fish saved in Akron amen I do too I thought I'd share that by the grace of Lord let's just bow our heads here and let's pray that we can get caught up in the spirit so that we will sense the Holy Spirit getting us ready for the rapture getting soul saved getting souls filled with the Holy Ghost and sensing that the rapture will be near Heavenly Father we're grateful for what your prophet preached to us Lord God we're grateful here tonight to hear your word Lord I've now preached through all the the church age sermons from 1960 Lord of the seven churches and now the the church age book Lord I preached what I thought were highlights to me by the Holy Spirit and so I just want to say thank you Lord God forgive me grace [Music] thank you for giving me strength and understanding Lord to preach these Church ages Lord God I'm just thankful I just want to tell you thank you Lord from my heart and I trust received in your heart doing God thank

the age the same things gonna happen Lord God our spirits are gonna start sensing my the rapture soon we're gonna see prophecy in the political realm coming to pass we're to see the the economical move mature and we're going to start sensing in our spirit that the rapture is really close and we know Lord your prophet said the Holy Spirit told him to pick up his pen and write and according to scripture and the bride will be forced to stop preaching the word we have all these signs or we are aware of all these things tonight Lord though tonight or we just give a fresh pledge [Music] and father I just trust that each and every person here or those livestreaming would pledge in their hearts I trust their art they are they've already pledged that but they'll renew that vow and say Lord I will constantly be praying and seeking for the baptism of the Holy Ghost if I believe I've got it I'll pray for everyone else in the church to get it I'll constantly ask I'll constantly seek you for more of the Holy Ghost grant that Lord Jesus granite Lord that we won't get blind and miserable naked not knowing our condition help us to see our condition that our condition be a hot condition let
