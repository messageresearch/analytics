[34:26] beautiful songs tonight
[34:30] i just had this little message on my
[34:31] heart for a number of weeks i like to
[34:33] preach on new wine in new bottles
[34:35] tonight so you have your bibles let's go
[34:37] to the book of matthew here by god's
[34:40] grace
[34:43] brother branham labored on it in 1957
[34:46] more than other years
[34:51] not sure all the significance behind
[34:53] that but we know 56 was the
[34:55] 50th year after the revival of 1906
[35:01] so there's a lot of significance in that
[35:03] uh those that rejected the revival
[35:06] brother brown was saying the nation
[35:07] rejected it but it's clear the
[35:09] individual can still have it like we're
[35:11] having tonight
[35:13] hallelujah thank you jesus
[35:16] matthew let's go to matthew um let me
[35:19] pull my notes here sorry
[35:22] it's mentioned three times in the
[35:24] gospels matthew 9 sorry matthew 9 14.
[35:31] by the end i think you understand what
[35:32] i'm saying
[35:34] uh we need new wine we need new wine
[35:36] more than yesterday
[35:38] we need new wine today
[35:39] amen praise god
[35:42] so
[35:42] matthew 9 14 i believe yes 9 14.
[35:51] there's this little song i want to learn
[35:52] i've been listening to a lot at home
[35:53] it's called new wine i think hillsong
[35:55] sings it
[35:56] um beautiful song just an absolute
[36:00] masterpiece of the song
[36:02] um
[36:03] that guy might try to sing that one at
[36:05] the original guy oh he stepped out
[36:07] i might try and sing that at the end
[36:09] here we'll see how much
[36:12] how bold i get i guess that's probably
[36:14] the word how bold do i feel like being
[36:16] trying a new song
[36:18] in case you laughed at me
[36:20] matthew 9 14.
[36:23] but it's just such a beautiful song
[36:27] jesus is constantly wanting to do new
[36:29] wine in our lives praise god
[36:32] 9 14.
[36:39] matthew 9 14. i'll read uh
[36:43] 14 through 16 and then we'll all read
[36:46] 17. so let me read those first few
[36:47] verses then came to him the disciples of
[36:50] john saying why do we and the pharisees
[36:52] fast oft
[36:53] but thy disciples fast not
[36:57] and jesus said unto them can the
[36:58] children of the bride chamber mourn as
[37:01] long as the bridegroom is with them
[37:03] but the days will come when the
[37:05] bridegroom shall be taken from them and
[37:07] then shall they fast
[37:11] no man putteth a piece of new cloth
[37:14] unto an old garment
[37:17] for that which is put in
[37:20] i'm sorry in to fill it up taketh from
[37:23] the garment and the rent
[37:25] is made worse let's read verse 17
[37:27] together can we one two three neither do
[37:31] men put new wine into new bottles i'm
[37:34] sorry old bottles else the bottles break
[37:37] and the wine runeth out and the bottles
[37:40] perish but they put new wine into new
[37:43] bottles and both are preserved let's
[37:46] have one more word of prayer let's ask
[37:48] god to give us new wine can we pray that
[37:50] tonight here
[37:51] heavenly father lord we're grateful for
[37:53] your mercy and your love and father we
[37:55] just come lord worshiping you today lord
[37:58] i notice all these songs are about joy
[38:00] and worshiping god many of them the lord
[38:02] what a vindication lord because we're
[38:04] looking at new wine the joy and gladness
[38:06] of the lord tonight so father we're
[38:08] grateful for your amazing grace and this
[38:11] word that you've given to us the
[38:13] revelation of it and the life-giving
[38:15] power that it brings us lord as new wine
[38:18] makes new life and it expands and grows
[38:21] thank you that the holy ghost expands
[38:24] lord and grows in our life as we grow in
[38:26] love and grow in knowledge and grow in
[38:29] judgment lord of all these things we're
[38:31] grateful lord speak to your people
[38:33] tonight i know many have traveled many
[38:34] miles lord like sister wendy lord and
[38:37] sister karen lord i just pray you bless
[38:39] their sacrifices speak to them speak to
[38:41] all of us tonight lord god we're
[38:43] grateful to be gathered in your house
[38:45] lord and all that we receive tonight we
[38:47] know the devil will never take it from
[38:49] us so let us receive revelation tonight
[38:51] that will keep it lord and we'll give
[38:53] you all the praise honor and glory in
[38:56] jesus christ's name for the saints said
[38:58] amen god bless you as you're being
[38:59] seated praise god i do have some slides
[39:02] here so
[39:03] um
[39:05] we'll look at new wine in new bottles
[39:07] tonight so ever since i heard that song
[39:10] uh by hillsong
[39:12] i thought ma i want to study that out
[39:13] and preach that you know a little more
[39:16] uh
[39:19] i'm going to preach on music pretty soon
[39:21] amen just so you know
[39:23] um
[39:24] i've been studying listening to it when
[39:25] i have the free time you know it's like
[39:27] when i'm washing dishes or something
[39:28] like that
[39:31] and uh
[39:32] let me just give you a little brief
[39:35] review or you guys should say preview i
[39:37] don't think there's anything wrong in
[39:39] singing a hill song song as long as you
[39:41] sing it in the right style
[39:44] with the right beat and as long as the
[39:46] words are scriptural
[39:49] so let me just give you that so i
[39:50] believe as christians we can pull from
[39:52] any group whether they're off the word
[39:53] or not
[39:54] any real inspiration they get from god
[39:57] that's scriptural i believe we can
[39:59] benefit from that
[40:01] right
[40:02] uh just like balaam balaam was a false
[40:04] prophet right but he got under the true
[40:06] anointing and he prophesied there's
[40:08] gonna rise a star out of jacob the wise
[40:11] men follow that prophecy right
[40:14] so see any person that gets real
[40:16] inspiration from god it's useful to the
[40:18] real believer
[40:20] right
[40:21] but you don't focus on the vessel right
[40:24] like i don't go to hillsong and try to
[40:25] what can i learn what they're preaching
[40:28] how their women cut their hair and you
[40:30] know and all their you know if it's a
[40:32] pro i don't know if it's a prosperity
[40:33] church or not but would i go to them for
[40:36] teaching no but if they have a gift of
[40:38] god
[40:39] that points us to the word as we worship
[40:41] and sing i'll take that
[40:44] and i know maybe you disagree some
[40:45] people might disagree with me that's
[40:47] fine
[40:48] but i i see scripture because the bible
[40:50] says sing a new song under the lord if
[40:52] we just keep singing the same old songs
[40:54] that's fine but that's actually against
[40:55] the scripture we need to learn a new
[40:57] song
[40:58] praise god
[40:59] so
[41:00] i know a few people in the message who
[41:01] write new songs but not many
[41:04] so we're really limited on new songs
[41:06] at least in the message
[41:08] and that's okay it might not be our gift
[41:10] like who can add a cubit to your stature
[41:12] who's going to sit down and say well i'm
[41:13] going to write a new song today because
[41:14] we don't have any news who's going to do
[41:16] it
[41:17] i don't see many of us doing it
[41:19] um so
[41:20] if they're inspired to sing those songs
[41:23] and they're scriptural songs then i'll
[41:24] sing it
[41:26] and if not well how do you deal with uh
[41:28] when hillsong 20 years ago wrote shout
[41:30] to the lord
[41:32] and it was just piano and there was no
[41:34] rock and roll into it you're going to
[41:35] throw that song out i mean all the
[41:36] message church has sung that shout to
[41:38] the lord
[41:39] well now they're going to throw it out
[41:40] just because he'll sing it back before
[41:42] they use the rock and roll and all these
[41:44] things but i think that's wrong
[41:46] so i just want to i just want to
[41:47] encourage you by amen i know you're the
[41:48] song leader buddy so i just want to
[41:49] encourage you as long as that song is
[41:51] sung with the right style and worship
[41:53] and holiness doesn't have the rock and
[41:55] roll
[41:56] uh it's called the back beat so i'm
[41:58] going to preach on that too as long as
[41:59] it doesn't have that back beat and it's
[42:00] rock and roll or rap like or
[42:04] hip-hop or something like that as long
[42:06] as you can sing that song in the right
[42:08] style and its words are scriptural
[42:10] that's a blessing
[42:11] okay so i just thought i'd just preview
[42:13] it to you on that no i don't get
[42:15] discouraged you know uh
[42:18] i i i as as if you can feel the presence
[42:21] of god in a song and it lines up with
[42:23] the word it's okay to sing as long as we
[42:25] sing it the right way praise god
[42:27] so uh bear with me here uh we'll be
[42:29] looking at new wine and new bottles now
[42:31] there's no
[42:33] symbolism behind this uh you know this
[42:35] powerpoint i just i want to try
[42:36] something different you know
[42:38] i think it's called drafting like
[42:39] someone making a draft to build a
[42:40] building so i guess we're trying to
[42:42] build the house of god we're trying to
[42:44] build a statue perfect man but you know
[42:46] there's no really significance to it i
[42:48] just want to look at new wine and new
[42:50] bottles tonight have your bibles handy
[42:52] there's three parallel passages
[42:55] uh to the new wine
[42:58] uh parable jesus told
[43:00] okay and it's called a parable in luke
[43:03] we'll get to we'll end with that one uh
[43:04] so we read the one in matthew 9 here
[43:07] and uh it sounds like jesus is just
[43:09] carrying over the thought of
[43:12] disciples don't fast
[43:15] um
[43:16] i don't i honestly don't know if if the
[43:18] old garment parable and the new line is
[43:21] connected to the fasting or not
[43:24] um
[43:25] personally i don't think it is it could
[43:27] be i'll explain why when we get to luke
[43:30] i just want you to notice uh from from
[43:32] this text here
[43:34] um
[43:35] that jesus tells john's disciples we're
[43:38] not fasting because it's a joyful time
[43:42] right so jesus was god and flesh and him
[43:46] being on earth was a joyful time amen so
[43:49] he said i don't expect my twelve
[43:51] disciples to fast because the
[43:53] bridegroom's here amen
[43:56] right if we went to a wedding when was
[43:57] the last wedding we attended that'd have
[43:59] been amen who was i remember bangs back
[44:01] i think
[44:02] the five or six year reminder came up on
[44:04] my facebook a few days ago buddy so
[44:06] happy anniversary
[44:09] it's coming up pretty soon too i think
[44:11] it's december 4th or 5th right somewhere
[44:12] in there i saw that on my facebook i'm
[44:15] like praise the lord bang's anniversary
[44:17] but when we went to vang's uh
[44:19] celebration we weren't fasting man we
[44:22] gotta we ate all the meat you know and
[44:24] the fun and whatever was there i'm just
[44:26] guessing on the pho whatever was there
[44:28] whatever laos you know hmong type food
[44:30] was there we gorged ourselves
[44:33] well maybe not all of us but in other
[44:35] words a wedding is not a time to fast
[44:38] it's a time to feast
[44:40] and so jesus christ on the earth
[44:42] literally god and flesh was a time to
[44:44] rejoice
[44:46] multitudes church were being saved he'd
[44:48] walk into a building brother amen and
[44:50] everybody would get healed praise god
[44:52] as long as they had the faith it was a
[44:55] time of
[44:56] uh feasting it was a time of spiritual
[44:58] feasting and rejoicing
[45:00] but then he said but after the
[45:02] bridegroom leaves then they're going to
[45:04] learn how to fast and pray and so church
[45:07] we know his body's not here now so it's
[45:09] a time for we us to be fasting as well
[45:11] at times
[45:13] because the bridegroom is not here
[45:16] his body's not here his spirit's here
[45:18] but his spirit's been here for 2000
[45:20] years
[45:21] we're waiting for the body praise god
[45:23] we're waiting to see him face to face
[45:27] and uh one and i'll never forget this i
[45:29] told brother amen i was in arkansas
[45:30] preaching at a church and i said he said
[45:32] brother okay where do you want to eat i
[45:34] said i'm not going to eat today i'm
[45:35] fasting and praying he's like what do
[45:36] you mean the bridegroom's here i said
[45:38] what do you mean the bridegroom's here
[45:39] he said when the cloud came down in 63
[45:41] the bridegroom came back i said well i
[45:43] don't know about that
[45:45] but church the sad part was many people
[45:46] in his church were overweight
[45:48] uh obese didn't take care of themselves
[45:51] very well
[45:52] um
[45:53] and things i've heard since then they're
[45:55] really struggling now with covet many of
[45:57] them in the church their churches kind
[45:59] of dying dwindling away and there's a
[46:02] connection here to taking care of your
[46:04] body right
[46:05] and seeking god
[46:07] there's a connection and we'll get simon
[46:08] preach it last week we'll get to that
[46:09] little bit luke 21 we'll get to that in
[46:11] just a minute it's a worldwide spirit of
[46:14] noah that's coming over the world right
[46:16] now and we've got a battle against it
[46:19] do i believe the holy ghost is here in a
[46:21] great way absolutely uh do i believe
[46:24] something great happened in 63 with the
[46:25] cloud absolutely but it's not the
[46:28] physical return of jesus christ
[46:31] and so we must keep fasting and praying
[46:33] and being spiritual people
[46:35] okay now uh let's go to
[46:38] mark two i'm gonna try to just read
[46:40] these
[46:41] three passages and then show brother
[46:42] braham's interpretation like i said
[46:44] there's i think there's 21 hits in 1957.
[46:47] he mostly dealt with this and then i
[46:48] looked into 64 65 63 and he has the same
[46:52] interpretation of it so it remained
[46:54] unchanged even after the seals so mark 2
[46:57] 18.
[47:01] so let's read the scriptures and then
[47:03] we'll see brother branham's
[47:04] interpretation
[47:06] new wine in new bottles
[47:10] mark 2 18 it says
[47:13] and the disciples of john and the
[47:14] pharisees used to fast and they come and
[47:17] say unto him why do disciples of john
[47:19] and of the pharisees fast but thy
[47:20] disciples fast not
[47:23] and jesus said them can the children of
[47:25] the bride chamber fast while the
[47:26] bridegroom is with them as long as they
[47:29] have the bridegroom with them they
[47:30] cannot fast
[47:32] but the days will come when the
[47:34] bridegroom shall be taken away from them
[47:35] and then shall they fast in those days
[47:39] no man soweth a piece of new cloth on an
[47:42] old garment
[47:44] right else the new piece that filled it
[47:46] up taketh away from the old because
[47:48] it'll shrink right
[47:49] if you have a fabric that's brand new
[47:51] it's never been shrunk
[47:52] and you put it on an old garment and it
[47:54] gets wet or you heat it up whatever you
[47:56] do it'll shrink right and it'll it'll
[47:59] rip that piece it'll rip itself plus the
[48:01] garment around it
[48:03] that's what the scripture says it's made
[48:05] worse it doesn't actually help it hurts
[48:08] and no man with new line into old bowels
[48:11] else the new eye just birth burst the
[48:13] bottles and the light is spilled and the
[48:16] bottles will be marred but new wine must
[48:18] be put into new bottles
[48:23] glory praise god go to luke 5 33.
[48:28] see i know where we're going so i'm
[48:29] really happy you know
[48:31] and you probably know where we're going
[48:32] to
[48:33] luke 5 33
[48:42] now here's why actually i put it up here
[48:44] verse 36 seems to say that these two
[48:46] parables are not related to the the
[48:49] fasting
[48:50] now that's just my opinion so you know i
[48:53] haven't found anything different from
[48:54] brother branham on that so i mean i'm
[48:56] just letting you know that's i do not
[48:57] think they're related but it's good to
[48:59] go over fasting because amen asked me
[49:00] about it last week so it's good to go
[49:02] over it so we will go over it just
[49:03] really briefly here tonight
[49:05] okay luke 5 33
[49:09] then they said unto him why do the
[49:11] disciples of john fast often and make
[49:14] prayers and likewise the disciples of
[49:16] the pharisees but thine eat and drink
[49:19] and he said unto them can you make the
[49:21] children of the bride chamber fast while
[49:23] the bridegroom is with them
[49:26] but the days will come when the
[49:28] bridegroom shall be taken away from them
[49:30] and then shall they fast
[49:32] in those days
[49:35] right
[49:36] verse 36. now listen and he spake also a
[49:40] parable unto them so i'm just saying
[49:42] this scripture 36 makes it seem like
[49:45] also he also said something else a
[49:47] parable so it makes it seem like to me
[49:49] they're not connected but they could be
[49:52] i don't know for sure i don't think it's
[49:53] a major issue
[49:55] verse 36 no man put it that piece of a
[49:57] new garment upon an old if otherwise
[49:59] then both the new maketh a rent
[50:03] and the peace that was taken out of the
[50:04] new agreeth not with the old
[50:08] and no man put his new wine into old
[50:10] bottles else the new wine will burst the
[50:12] bottles and be spilled and the bottles
[50:15] shall perish
[50:16] but new wine must be put into new
[50:19] bottles and both
[50:21] are preserved so we're talking about the
[50:25] preservation of one
[50:27] we're talking about the preservation of
[50:29] skins
[50:31] praise god the goal of new wine is to
[50:34] preserve the power
[50:36] praise god amen
[50:38] it's preservation
[50:40] verse 39
[50:42] no man having drunk
[50:44] old wine straightway desireth the new
[50:46] for he saith the old is better
[50:50] praise god
[50:51] so the old wine is better wine praise
[50:54] god
[50:55] the one that's been uh
[50:57] growing longer amen one that's been
[50:59] around longer is the better wine praise
[51:02] god amen
[51:04] now
[51:05] uh let's just if you got your bibles go
[51:07] to isaiah 58. this is what i was showing
[51:10] with brother amen and sister who last
[51:12] week i believe if i'm not mistaken
[51:14] there's at least four reasons for
[51:16] fasting of course many others could be
[51:18] i'm sure it's been a while and i
[51:20] actually didn't go back and look at my
[51:21] notes i just these are the first four
[51:23] that came to my mind
[51:25] isaiah 58.
[51:28] this whole chapter is about fasting god
[51:31] rebukes them for fasting because they're
[51:33] not doing it the right way for the right
[51:35] reasons
[51:36] right like the pharisees they fasted and
[51:38] the bible said they would disfigure
[51:40] their faces
[51:42] right so i wonder what is that what does
[51:44] this figure mean would they put like
[51:46] ashes would they rub ashes if everybody
[51:48] could see it or they just
[51:52] i didn't eat lunch today
[51:55] oh uh
[51:56] pharisee dear sir why are you so sad
[51:59] i'm hungry you know he's sucking his
[52:01] cheeks a little bit
[52:03] haven't eaten today
[52:06] they put on a show they want everybody
[52:08] to know they're fasting
[52:10] for their glory
[52:12] and jesus said you got your reward here
[52:14] oh
[52:15] oh oh my yours you're so spiritual
[52:18] and yet when the word comes they turn
[52:20] down the word
[52:21] right it shows they're not spiritual
[52:24] now uh the main verses let's go to verse
[52:28] four
[52:30] see behold you fast for strife and
[52:33] debate
[52:34] so see they they would they would argue
[52:36] uh about who was better at fasting
[52:39] they would try to uh debate each other
[52:41] based upon who was more spiritual
[52:43] because i fast more
[52:47] and to fight with the fists of
[52:49] wickedness you should not fast as you do
[52:52] this day so jeremiah's telling i'm sorry
[52:54] i days down this is how fasting right
[52:56] now the wrong way
[52:58] to make your voice be heard on high so
[53:00] see they fasted to promote themselves
[53:02] well look i fasted today everybody needs
[53:04] to hear me
[53:06] right when they read that they read the
[53:08] uh
[53:09] the scroll the synagogue like jesus
[53:11] right when it's their day to
[53:12] read i'm
[53:14] fasting today and you know they
[53:16] try to be real spiritual now everybody
[53:18] listen to me now i've
[53:19] skipped a meal
[53:20] for all of you
[53:23] and they would oh this man is so holy
[53:26] i'm in the right place and actually
[53:27] they're in the wrong place
[53:29] right
[53:30] verse five is it such a fast that i have
[53:33] chosen is this what i've chosen
[53:35] to fast to magnify man
[53:37] and get you to debate and argue and fuss
[53:39] and exalt man a day for a man to afflict
[53:42] his soul
[53:43] is it to bow down his head as a bull
[53:45] rush and to spread sackcloth and ashes
[53:46] under him will thou call this a fast and
[53:48] acceptable day unto the lord is that
[53:50] this the fast that i've chosen here's
[53:52] why god chose fast here it is
[53:54] to loose the bands of wickedness
[53:58] to undo the heavy burdens
[54:01] so if you're burdened and you are
[54:03] addicted to something you need to fast
[54:06] or you can do it for other people i'll
[54:08] never forget when we fast for rose and
[54:10] uh whole days
[54:12] nephews and and grandson
[54:15] we just had fast days and god answered
[54:17] they're all alive by god's grace
[54:20] all three of those that had the cancer
[54:21] they're all alive by god's grace
[54:24] that's just god's amazing grace
[54:26] and all three of them in remission
[54:30] he said uh
[54:32] and to the let the oppressed go free
[54:35] and that you break every yoke amen
[54:38] see every addiction
[54:40] can be defeated praise god
[54:43] through fasting
[54:46] verse seven is it not not here's a new
[54:48] one that's new to me
[54:50] focusing on the poor
[54:52] so if you want to get your eyes off
[54:54] yourself and minister to other people
[54:56] the bible says fast and then go work
[55:00] while you're fasting
[55:01] in other words go take food to people or
[55:03] go you know take them a check or take
[55:05] them cash if you want to get closer to
[55:07] god
[55:08] the bible says fast and then go serve
[55:11] other people
[55:12] right because it's the most sincere
[55:14] you'll ever be
[55:15] because when you eat a lot it's the
[55:17] least sincere you probably are right
[55:20] because you're oh you're just so relaxed
[55:21] and feeling so good and you're feeling
[55:23] heavy right you're you're weighted down
[55:26] by your meal
[55:29] but when you fast he says that's a time
[55:31] to go
[55:32] minister to the poor
[55:34] that was the last time we did that
[55:36] see
[55:39] is it not to deal thy bread to the
[55:40] hungry so i could eat that bread but if
[55:43] i fast and give it away
[55:44] god will move on
[55:46] on our behalf and that thou bring the
[55:49] poor that are cast out to thy house
[55:52] when that so you're fasting but you're
[55:54] going to bring the poor to your house to
[55:55] feed them about that one
[55:57] my goodness when thou seest the naked
[55:59] that thou will cover him and that thou
[56:01] hide not thyself from thine own flesh
[56:05] right your own family your own
[56:06] whatever you see when you're fasting
[56:08] you're in tune with other people's needs
[56:11] you're aware of what they need
[56:14] right because it's not about you you're
[56:16] telling your body hey buddy i'm in
[56:17] charge not you
[56:19] right
[56:20] hey stomach yeah i'm in charge of you
[56:23] you're not running in this life i'm
[56:24] running this life the soul
[56:27] right
[56:28] and then you can actually get your focus
[56:30] off yourself and get it on other people
[56:33] when you're fasting
[56:35] even if it's just one me i always tell
[56:36] the people start out light just start
[56:37] with one meal
[56:39] right and then go see if you can go to
[56:40] two let's even go to three i rarely go
[56:43] beyond three i rarely just so you know i
[56:45] rarely go beyond three
[56:46] um just because i haven't felt led to do
[56:48] that
[56:49] and if god's gonna leave me do that i'm
[56:50] sure he will i'll be happy to do it by
[56:52] god's grace
[56:54] um
[56:57] verse 8 then shall thy light break forth
[57:00] as the morning huh
[57:02] you're gonna you're gonna feel like a
[57:04] brand new morning when you're fasting
[57:07] and serving other people
[57:09] church if you want a revival it's very
[57:10] simple fast and go help other people
[57:13] very very simple oh i want to i want a
[57:15] fresh start brother jester i i want to
[57:17] feel god's love afresh again okay fast
[57:20] and goes to help other people
[57:23] pray fast and pray and go serve other
[57:25] people the bible promises you'll break
[57:28] forth as the morning
[57:30] amen
[57:31] i feel like i'm in a real dark time
[57:33] brother jess i feel like it's a
[57:35] nighttime well i know how to get to a
[57:36] morning time right here
[57:39] i know how so you can have a new morning
[57:41] praise god amen i know how you can feel
[57:45] god's mercies are brand new praise god
[57:49] don't feed your flesh
[57:51] don't enter to the flesh cater the holy
[57:53] spirit
[57:57] and thine health your health shall
[57:59] spring forth speed us so when you're
[58:01] sick fasting is a good option too
[58:04] now when i fast normally just do water
[58:06] or coffee or kombucha just liquid i do
[58:09] liquid fast brother
[58:10] uh daniel and daniel nine and ten he did
[58:12] the
[58:13] the vegetable fast
[58:16] right he didn't have all the dainty
[58:17] meats you know
[58:19] he just did a vegetable fast that was
[58:20] three weeks
[58:21] so he did vegetables and water and
[58:23] didn't enjoy the i said like this the
[58:25] chicken and of course he wouldn't eat
[58:27] pork you know but
[58:28] uh all the dainty meats he'd stay away
[58:30] from that
[58:31] and that was 21 days of seeking god
[58:34] and god answered his prayer by sending
[58:36] gabriel
[58:37] praise god
[58:38] gabriel held uh the prince of persia
[58:41] that demon power so the other angel
[58:43] could come down and bring him the
[58:44] answers to his questions praise god
[58:48] and thy righteousness shall go before
[58:50] thee okay so then see that god will
[58:52] prepare your way how many want to know
[58:54] how many would know the way to walk in
[58:56] the bible said are you fast then the
[58:58] bible said righteousness will go before
[59:00] you
[59:01] it'll prepare it'll prepare the way the
[59:03] right actions are right in front of you
[59:05] praise god amen
[59:07] right choices are right in front of you
[59:09] if you just fast and pray
[59:12] that's why you'll find out brother
[59:13] brandon fasted every friday
[59:16] every friday
[59:22] verse 9 oh i want to hear from god verse
[59:24] 9 then thou shalt call and the lord
[59:26] shall answer
[59:28] i need an answer from god fast
[59:31] thou shalt cry and he shall say here i
[59:33] am if thou take away from the midst of
[59:36] thee the yoke the putting forth of the
[59:38] finger and the vanish so see the yoke is
[59:40] yoked or addicted to the sin right
[59:42] yoke to sin
[59:43] and then vanity right and putting forth
[59:45] the finger accusing others that's like
[59:47] satan satan's a great accuser
[59:51] right if you put that away and stop
[59:53] saying such evil things
[59:56] you're gonna get a victory
[59:58] fasting
[1:00:00] and if thy if thou draw out this thou
[1:00:03] soul i'm sorry thy soul to the hungry
[1:00:05] and satisfy the afflicted soul
[1:00:07] then shall thy light rise in obscurity
[1:00:10] and thy darkness shall be as the noon
[1:00:12] day praise god
[1:00:17] see so when you fast you want to be
[1:00:19] satisfied with god right there's
[1:00:21] something you want god to satisfy but
[1:00:23] the bible says when you fast satisfy
[1:00:26] other people and then you'll get a
[1:00:28] blessing praise god
[1:00:30] right
[1:00:31] uh i think brother dick said that if you
[1:00:33] want a blessing go be a blessing to
[1:00:34] somebody
[1:00:35] praise god lebron said that you want
[1:00:37] somebody to say something nice about you
[1:00:38] say something nice about them
[1:00:42] amen praise god cast your bread up on
[1:00:44] the waters it'll come back in due time
[1:00:46] praise god
[1:00:47] when i got that check in the mail for
[1:00:48] 500 from that brother up in illinois
[1:00:50] you know he said 650 brother
[1:00:54] 650.
[1:00:56] so you just cast it and all for what all
[1:00:58] just for the videos we made
[1:01:01] he said i've enjoyed those youtube
[1:01:02] videos for five years
[1:01:03] he said i just want to he said i wanted
[1:01:05] to come and take your family out to eat
[1:01:08] he said but i had back yeah he said i
[1:01:09] broke my back i had cancer all these
[1:01:11] things he's like i'm not kicking so i'm
[1:01:13] going to say this offering
[1:01:18] verse 11. the lord shall guide thee lord
[1:01:21] i want to be guided fast
[1:01:25] you see any good promise lacking here
[1:01:27] do you see anything that's lacking if we
[1:01:29] fast i don't see much lacking
[1:01:33] he shall guide thee and satisfy thy soul
[1:01:35] in drought and make thy bones i'm sorry
[1:01:38] make fat thy bones and thou shalt be
[1:01:40] like a water garden and like a spring of
[1:01:42] water whose waters fail not
[1:01:46] i'm gonna keep being so refreshed so
[1:01:49] satisfied i'm gonna be drinking on the
[1:01:51] waters of god i'm just going to be so
[1:01:53] happy all the time praise god because
[1:01:56] i'm fasting
[1:01:57] i'm satisfied i want i want my inside to
[1:02:00] be satisfied so i'm cutting off my
[1:02:02] natural desires
[1:02:07] verse 12 and they that shall be of thee
[1:02:10] shall build the old waste places
[1:02:13] oh talk about restoration
[1:02:17] thou shalt raise up the foundations of
[1:02:19] many
[1:02:20] generations you want to see your
[1:02:22] children saved fast
[1:02:24] praise god
[1:02:26] we want to see we want to see
[1:02:27] generations impacted fast
[1:02:31] and thou shalt be called the repair of
[1:02:33] the breach the restore of pass to dwell
[1:02:36] in
[1:02:38] praise god wow people that fast uh bring
[1:02:41] restoration to places right they renew
[1:02:44] places
[1:02:45] they give renewed hope people get new
[1:02:47] beginnings all through fasting
[1:02:52] but that sure is not a popular message
[1:02:53] in this day and later to see an age
[1:02:56] they don't want to hear
[1:03:00] that verse 13 this is part of it if thou
[1:03:04] turn away thy foot from the sabbath from
[1:03:06] doing thy pleasure on my holy day and
[1:03:08] call the sabbath a delight so we've got
[1:03:10] to call sundays it's a delight to go to
[1:03:13] church
[1:03:15] the holy of the lord honorable and shall
[1:03:18] honor him not doing thine own ways nor
[1:03:20] finding thine own pleasure nor speaking
[1:03:22] thine own words
[1:03:24] so really it's good to come here and
[1:03:26] fellowship but really the fellowship is
[1:03:27] with christ
[1:03:29] and then when you get that then it just
[1:03:30] pours out to everybody else praise god
[1:03:32] but if you just come just to fellowship
[1:03:34] with people you're going to miss the
[1:03:36] real fellowship with christ
[1:03:39] verse 14 then shalt thou delight thyself
[1:03:42] in the lord amen
[1:03:44] is that striking uh psalms says delight
[1:03:46] yourself the lord will give you the
[1:03:47] desires of your heart but the heroes
[1:03:49] tells you how to delight yourself in the
[1:03:50] lord fasting praise god
[1:03:55] so after you fast and turn your way from
[1:03:57] evil all these things focus on the lord
[1:03:59] as we said this morning then you'll
[1:04:00] delight yourself in the lord
[1:04:03] and i will cause thee to ride upon the
[1:04:05] high places of the earth oh you just go
[1:04:08] on uh flights praise god you'll soar up
[1:04:10] into the heavenlies praise god
[1:04:12] far above the worldly things and the
[1:04:14] church said
[1:04:16] on that eagle anointing
[1:04:20] and feed thee with the heritage of jacob
[1:04:23] thy father
[1:04:24] for the mouth of the lord has spoken now
[1:04:26] who's going to say that doesn't work
[1:04:28] who's going to say
[1:04:30] fasting doesn't work
[1:04:31] the lord spoke it praise god
[1:04:34] the lord spoke it so we're not going to
[1:04:36] read these because time but brother if
[1:04:38] we need power
[1:04:40] the bible says fast forward because
[1:04:42] certain kind only go out by prayer and
[1:04:43] fasting
[1:04:44] if we need healing to our own bodies
[1:04:46] fast
[1:04:47] if we need to focus on the poor get our
[1:04:49] eyes off ourselves and want a blessing
[1:04:52] we need to focus on other people fast
[1:04:54] while you're doing it
[1:04:55] and if you need answers like daniel fast
[1:04:59] so normally i fast for preaching for
[1:05:01] these reasons right here usually
[1:05:04] right so i just have a reminder on my
[1:05:06] phone to give to the poor every month by
[1:05:08] god's grace i've been doing that
[1:05:09] but these are the main reasons i fast i
[1:05:11] want to be prepared if somebody comes up
[1:05:13] for prayer and i'm going to put oil on
[1:05:14] them and they don't have any sins i want
[1:05:16] to trust that god's going to drive that
[1:05:18] demon away
[1:05:20] that's why i fast
[1:05:21] right
[1:05:22] for healing and then answers i want to
[1:05:24] know god what do you want me to preach
[1:05:26] so i fast and i look for god to answer
[1:05:28] it when i study praise god
[1:05:30] so that you'll have the word that you
[1:05:31] need
[1:05:32] amen
[1:05:35] okay now much more can be said you can
[1:05:37] i've preached numerous sermons on
[1:05:38] fasting but here's where brother brown
[1:05:40] says he's talking about some victory or
[1:05:42] some services in new york well i'm sorry
[1:05:44] he's in new york talking about previous
[1:05:46] services one night they just piled up
[1:05:48] crutches and things to try to hold them
[1:05:49] around for me for them to hold like this
[1:05:52] they want to take a picture of it some
[1:05:53] old canes clubs everything they've been
[1:05:55] walking with then i remember i've been
[1:05:57] fasting it was just like tonight
[1:05:59] friday's a fast day has been for me for
[1:06:02] a long time so brother man would fast go
[1:06:06] into the weekend fasting he said he
[1:06:08] would eat a little sandwich before
[1:06:09] services on the weekend
[1:06:11] and then he would see crutches he would
[1:06:13] see people healed from canes
[1:06:16] so that was his avenue for having
[1:06:18] miracles
[1:06:20] so if you want to see miracles we got to
[1:06:21] consecrate our lives and we got to pray
[1:06:23] for it amen praise god you got to
[1:06:26] consecrate it and pray for remember when
[1:06:27] bangs or who is dead uh got healed
[1:06:30] things that
[1:06:31] i was fasting that morning
[1:06:33] you know i was passing that morning and
[1:06:34] that sunday when jose brought out
[1:06:35] brother man's cloth
[1:06:37] i was fasting that morning too
[1:06:39] i just always want to be ready praise
[1:06:41] god you never know when uh you need to
[1:06:43] drive the power of the enemy away the
[1:06:44] bible said be instant just on sunday
[1:06:47] begins to in season out of season praise
[1:06:49] god
[1:06:50] you got to be ready
[1:06:52] oh i know we're gonna have special
[1:06:53] meetings i better fast then but it's a
[1:06:54] good idea to fast often praise god
[1:06:57] right not just special meetings
[1:06:59] it's a good idea to fast often the bible
[1:07:01] says
[1:07:02] so friday was brother adam's fast day
[1:07:07] now this is what brother brother simon
[1:07:09] brought out i'm sorry last week brother
[1:07:10] ham said it too i preached this years
[1:07:13] ago i preached on overeating years ago
[1:07:14] but i mean probably 2009 2010 i remember
[1:07:17] i preached it in north carolina at tim
[1:07:19] hughes church and i there was a there
[1:07:20] was a big man that came up after service
[1:07:23] and he said wow bro justin i'm going to
[1:07:24] follow everything you said
[1:07:26] and i'm going to cut my portions and i'm
[1:07:28] going to cut but sadly he didn't because
[1:07:31] i asked later some of the people in the
[1:07:32] church did he ever keep up with that
[1:07:33] they said no
[1:07:35] see people people want to do what's
[1:07:38] right but many times they can't because
[1:07:39] they've got hindrances in their life
[1:07:42] right
[1:07:44] if god's word promises you something and
[1:07:46] you can't get to it something you're
[1:07:48] doing is hindering that
[1:07:51] that's what you looked at on blessings
[1:07:52] and cursings right if you can't get a
[1:07:54] blessing of god is because something
[1:07:56] you're doing is hindering it
[1:07:58] because god wants you to be blessed
[1:08:04] so take heed to yourselves listen any
[1:08:06] time your hearts be overcharged with
[1:08:08] surfeiting that just means drinking over
[1:08:10] drinking
[1:08:11] and drunkenness so eat right cares of
[1:08:13] this life so eating and drinking so that
[1:08:15] day come upon you unawares
[1:08:18] for as a snare shall it come upon all
[1:08:21] them that dwell on the face of the whole
[1:08:23] earth so this overeating and laodicea
[1:08:27] where richard increased with goods
[1:08:28] that's impacting most people on the
[1:08:30] earth right you know there's a few
[1:08:32] places that have famine still you know
[1:08:34] there's little places like that but the
[1:08:35] bible says this is going to go over the
[1:08:37] face of the whole earth
[1:08:39] he said watch ye therefore and pray
[1:08:41] always
[1:08:42] that he may be accounted worthy
[1:08:45] to escape all these things that should
[1:08:47] come to pass and instead you've got to
[1:08:49] choose not to get drunk you've got to
[1:08:51] choose so fast you've got to choose that
[1:08:53] and then you're worthy of god's mercy
[1:08:57] amen so i'm not talking salvation i'm
[1:08:59] talking about escaping the tribulation
[1:09:02] yes you got to be worthy to escape the
[1:09:05] tribulation the bible says because this
[1:09:07] overeating and self-indulgence this
[1:09:09] lovers of self more than lovers of god
[1:09:11] comes upon the whole earth
[1:09:14] and the best way you can love god more
[1:09:16] than yourself is to fast
[1:09:22] i'd probably get more amens if more
[1:09:23] people were fasted
[1:09:28] so there's two applications to this
[1:09:30] there's application of new wine to the
[1:09:32] soul now yeah i'm getting transferring
[1:09:33] back to new wine now
[1:09:35] there's new wine to the soul
[1:09:38] but there's also new wine to the spirit
[1:09:41] so stay with me i'll start with the soul
[1:09:43] that's probably the most obvious
[1:09:48] because any time you talk about new wine
[1:09:49] you talk about
[1:09:51] gladness
[1:09:52] and joy and refreshment
[1:09:55] well you just don't have gladness in
[1:09:56] your soul right
[1:09:58] you can have gladness in your mind
[1:10:01] right
[1:10:03] so let's look at this uh so let's look
[1:10:04] at new wine in the soul here
[1:10:07] uh brother branham says on the day of
[1:10:09] pentecost god had 120
[1:10:12] brand new
[1:10:13] pentecostal bottles
[1:10:16] setting with their necks up
[1:10:19] i wish i had a bottle of that yup i got
[1:10:21] a bottle right here
[1:10:23] so he said brand new pentecostal bottles
[1:10:26] and when the holy spirit fell from
[1:10:28] heaven it filled those bottles and they
[1:10:31] bounced all over the place preaching the
[1:10:33] gospel to the known world declaring that
[1:10:35] jesus christ was the same yesterday
[1:10:38] today and forever
[1:10:40] so bibam says the new skins got filled
[1:10:43] with new wine on the day of pentecost
[1:10:46] so the new wine didn't come until
[1:10:49] pentecost
[1:10:50] praise god
[1:10:52] so that means church sanctification is
[1:10:54] the oil
[1:10:56] right brother man said you got to get
[1:10:58] new skins first
[1:10:59] then he said you got to oil the skins
[1:11:03] so the skins the new skins is
[1:11:06] justification
[1:11:08] and the oil to oil the skins to make
[1:11:10] sure they're flexible is sanctification
[1:11:13] and then the oil the new one i'm sorry
[1:11:15] the new wine poured in is the baptism of
[1:11:18] the holy ghost
[1:11:19] so there's three steps to the new wine
[1:11:23] praise god and i'll prove it to you
[1:11:25] brother brahm says so
[1:11:27] now he said you can't hardly get the
[1:11:28] message to the old form of believing
[1:11:30] he's talking about people that live
[1:11:32] under the old word
[1:11:33] like word that was
[1:11:35] uh it's not up to date right
[1:11:37] like they just say under luther just
[1:11:39] stay under wesley
[1:11:41] jesus spoke of that a long time ago in
[1:11:42] the bible he said you can't put new wine
[1:11:44] in old bottles i often wonder what that
[1:11:46] meant what did our lord mean when he
[1:11:48] said put new wine
[1:11:49] in old bottles well i thought what the
[1:11:51] difference does it make because today we
[1:11:54] only have glass bottles like this right
[1:11:55] here
[1:11:56] and whether it's a new or old it doesn't
[1:11:58] make any difference when i but when i
[1:12:00] visit the eastern countries the orient i
[1:12:02] find out that the water bottles of that
[1:12:04] day was made out of animal skin and then
[1:12:07] when the animal skins fresh and a new
[1:12:09] skin
[1:12:10] or it got old and dry and set to take
[1:12:12] new unfermented wine and put it in there
[1:12:15] with that new wine unfermented still had
[1:12:18] the germ of life in it and when it
[1:12:20] begins to ferment why the old bottles
[1:12:22] that were so set and stiff why there was
[1:12:24] an explosion
[1:12:26] it could not hold it and it would just
[1:12:28] burst open then the wine would perish
[1:12:32] and the bottle would perish
[1:12:34] praise god
[1:12:36] now that's the way it is today you can't
[1:12:38] take this brand new heaven-born
[1:12:41] pentecostal wine and mix it with them
[1:12:43] old-time creed of some sort some old set
[1:12:46] in the way died in the wool now can i
[1:12:49] get an amen for set in the way
[1:12:51] church we cannot be set in our way
[1:12:54] in other words this is all i'm going to
[1:12:56] give to god i'm not giving any more to
[1:12:58] god
[1:12:59] this is how i serve god i can't give any
[1:13:02] more to god church we cannot get set in
[1:13:04] our ways we got to be constantly
[1:13:06] surrendering more to god amen amen
[1:13:12] we don't because most we see it message
[1:13:14] people if they're along or hanging
[1:13:15] around long enough they get set in their
[1:13:17] ways and we're not careful the same
[1:13:19] thing happens to us
[1:13:21] we gotta break out of the old and we
[1:13:23] gotta have a brand new bottle praise god
[1:13:26] now that's later to the human spirit
[1:13:28] this is still speaking of the soul
[1:13:30] why if you do you go to preaching about
[1:13:32] the baptism of the holy spirit divine
[1:13:34] healing and signs and wonders that old
[1:13:36] skin will try to stretch and it'll blow
[1:13:39] ah the days of miracles has passed i
[1:13:41] can't stand it no more i can't even
[1:13:43] stand through this sermon now how many
[1:13:45] people would have battled that before
[1:13:48] they don't even want to listen to the
[1:13:49] sermon
[1:13:51] right
[1:13:52] they don't even want to hear it they
[1:13:53] won't even agree with it
[1:13:56] see it's just set in the way see the
[1:13:58] reason we don't want to hear more word
[1:14:00] is because we're set in our ways
[1:14:02] and we got to hunger for more of the
[1:14:03] word we got to be honest and say god
[1:14:05] there's more i can learn about serving
[1:14:07] you i don't serve you perfectly i want
[1:14:09] to serve you better
[1:14:14] i can't stand it no more i can't even
[1:14:16] stand through this sermon
[1:14:18] blowy out the door it goes that's right
[1:14:20] you can't do it but to put new
[1:14:22] pentecostal wine you got to have new
[1:14:24] bottles right and the new bottles is new
[1:14:26] skin is still got animal oil on it
[1:14:28] that's the new skin
[1:14:31] praise god
[1:14:33] and you begin to preach the baptism of
[1:14:35] the holy spirit the love of god divine
[1:14:37] healing signs and wonders a new skin
[1:14:40] when the bible said jesus christ is the
[1:14:42] same yesterday today and forever that
[1:14:44] new skin will say amen that's right and
[1:14:46] it'll stretch out
[1:14:48] amen see in other words that power will
[1:14:51] grow in you
[1:14:53] when you say amen i believe that and i
[1:14:55] really believe that brother jess that
[1:14:57] power is going to grow in you and you're
[1:14:59] going to feel it grow into your daily
[1:15:01] life
[1:15:02] amen oh hallelujah thank the lord
[1:15:07] the old skin will say oh dr jones don't
[1:15:09] teach it like that that's not that's not
[1:15:11] how i learned it first
[1:15:13] there you are that's the difference what
[1:15:15] we need today is a brand new set of
[1:15:16] pentecostal hides
[1:15:19] that's right to preach a pentecostal
[1:15:21] message and he said now pentecost is not
[1:15:23] your denomination now pentecost is an
[1:15:25] experience
[1:15:29] it's not a denomination pentecost is
[1:15:31] what you received amen
[1:15:34] praise god i'm a pentecostal bottle
[1:15:36] praise god hallelujah praise god
[1:15:39] although i was raised in a pentecostal
[1:15:41] church they didn't have the pentecostal
[1:15:43] models praise god
[1:15:45] but we've got the pentecostal bottles
[1:15:47] and the pentecostal wine amen
[1:15:50] glory
[1:15:53] it's what you receive
[1:15:55] i've got pentecost living in me praise
[1:15:57] god
[1:15:58] that's right it's for the methodist
[1:16:00] baptist lutheran catholic just
[1:16:02] just as much pentecost sometimes a whole
[1:16:03] lot more than those who call themselves
[1:16:07] that's right it's an experience when you
[1:16:09] can take it oh that's a good thing and
[1:16:11] when that new life begins to work and
[1:16:13] you read the bible says i'm the lord
[1:16:16] that heals all thy diseases then that
[1:16:19] new skin as that life begins to enter in
[1:16:21] it stretches out and says amen i believe
[1:16:24] it lord
[1:16:28] now so one example is this morning when
[1:16:30] i'm preaching you know keeping your
[1:16:32] focus if you really got the wine if you
[1:16:34] really receive that wine you'll say amen
[1:16:36] and you'll be more focused tomorrow
[1:16:40] right i mean if it's going to grow in
[1:16:41] you
[1:16:42] if it's going to stretch out and grow
[1:16:44] it's got to grow in you almost fell out
[1:16:46] there you got it's got to grow in your
[1:16:47] life
[1:16:50] if it has real power it's going to grow
[1:16:52] because the word is power the word is
[1:16:55] life
[1:16:56] just put it on your lips one time you'll
[1:16:58] see it it is life
[1:16:59] right keep it on your lips speak the
[1:17:01] word speak the word talk about the word
[1:17:03] the word is power the word is life it
[1:17:06] changes things
[1:17:07] amen
[1:17:09] see each time we hear it
[1:17:11] we gotta take what we hear and really
[1:17:13] receive that wine
[1:17:16] and then if it's real if we really
[1:17:17] received it and our heart was right
[1:17:19] it'll push out to more power
[1:17:24] yes that's what we need today is
[1:17:26] experience is a new birth now here's
[1:17:27] where he teaches it out of ezekiel this
[1:17:29] is the same sermon it's just a few
[1:17:30] paragraphs later about 10 paragraphs
[1:17:32] later that's what we need today now i
[1:17:34] want you to watch the order that ezekiel
[1:17:36] brought it in so brother says ezekiel
[1:17:37] preached on the new wine first
[1:17:40] before jesus did
[1:17:42] he said i'll give you a new heart i'll
[1:17:43] give you a new spirit i'll put my spirit
[1:17:45] in you i want you to watch there's three
[1:17:47] of it a new heart i'll take the old sony
[1:17:50] heart away that's the old different
[1:17:52] heart you have and i'll give you a new
[1:17:53] spirit now many times and there's been a
[1:17:56] terrible mistake the people has thought
[1:17:57] sometimes that the new spirit was the
[1:17:59] holy spirit but it isn't it's a new
[1:18:02] spirit
[1:18:03] okay go to ezekiel 36 here let's look at
[1:18:05] that
[1:18:11] verse 26
[1:18:15] now actually if you look at verse 25
[1:18:17] this is speaking of zechariah as well so
[1:18:20] this is speaking to when israel receives
[1:18:22] the baptism of the holy ghost the 144
[1:18:24] thousand but we know they turned it down
[1:18:26] so peter gave it to the samaritans and
[1:18:28] the gentiles in other words the gentiles
[1:18:31] had got a new heart a new spirit and
[1:18:33] god's spirit amen amen because god will
[1:18:36] put them away if they don't want to
[1:18:38] receive it he'll put them away he'll cut
[1:18:39] off that branch as we said on wednesday
[1:18:41] and he'll put in that he'll attach the
[1:18:43] new branch he'll graft in the new branch
[1:18:45] that will live on the life of jesus
[1:18:49] i'm so glad i got that life praise god
[1:18:52] verse 26
[1:18:55] so verse 25 is sprinkling new water on
[1:18:57] you that should be zechariah 12 right
[1:18:59] very familiar verse 26 a new heart also
[1:19:02] will i give you and a new spirit will i
[1:19:04] put within you and i will take away the
[1:19:06] stony heart of your flesh and i'll give
[1:19:08] you an heart of flesh
[1:19:11] and i'll put my spirit in you and cause
[1:19:13] you to walk in my statutes and you shall
[1:19:15] keep my judgments and do them
[1:19:19] okay
[1:19:21] so the holy spirit as long as you
[1:19:22] surrender to it it's causing you to obey
[1:19:27] right
[1:19:28] so getting up in the morning right with
[1:19:30] your morning routine seeking god in the
[1:19:31] morning or whenever you seek god
[1:19:33] hopefully it's sometime in the
[1:19:34] morning your flesh may not want to do it
[1:19:37] but you've got to yield over and
[1:19:39] surrender and as soon as you let
[1:19:41] surrender and the holy spirit starts
[1:19:43] anointing you then he causes you to keep
[1:19:45] it praise god
[1:19:47] and then he then he blesses you in your
[1:19:50] obedience and surrender to him
[1:19:53] he causes it right he causes you to keep
[1:19:56] the word
[1:19:57] amen so every anytime that was anything
[1:19:59] good that came out of my life it wasn't
[1:20:01] me i just surrendered and then god
[1:20:04] caused me to do the work praise god
[1:20:06] so it's not my works really it's christ
[1:20:08] in me the hope of glory
[1:20:11] see it's the holy spirit but you you do
[1:20:14] have to yield your your will
[1:20:17] you do have to yield your will that's
[1:20:19] the one work that we can do yield our
[1:20:22] will to god and surrender
[1:20:26] people say remember that i preached on
[1:20:28] this a few months ago people say oh you
[1:20:29] don't have to do anything to go to
[1:20:30] heaven well that's the case judas is
[1:20:31] going to heaven
[1:20:33] hitler's going to heaven no you do you
[1:20:35] have to repent you have to believe you
[1:20:36] have to surrender your will to god's
[1:20:38] will
[1:20:39] you have to do something to go to heaven
[1:20:42] right
[1:20:43] but when you surrender then god gives
[1:20:45] you the gift of faith
[1:20:47] because it's not of yourself but it's a
[1:20:49] gift we're saved by grace through faith
[1:20:52] in the blood of christ
[1:20:54] so that's the key church surrendering
[1:20:56] our will to god
[1:20:58] amen
[1:21:01] he said i want you to watch there's
[1:21:03] three of it a new heart so see three
[1:21:05] steps just like justification
[1:21:06] signification baptism of the holy ghost
[1:21:09] praise god now many times yeah okay i
[1:21:12] already read that all right next one
[1:21:14] god gives you a new why couldn't
[1:21:16] why you couldn't even get along with
[1:21:18] yourself with your old spirit now listen
[1:21:20] church if we're having trouble just
[1:21:21] getting along day to day maybe
[1:21:23] something's wrong with our
[1:21:24] sanctification
[1:21:26] you should you should get along with
[1:21:28] yourself
[1:21:29] right
[1:21:30] you should obey god's word we should
[1:21:32] obey god's word and we should enjoy many
[1:21:35] days we should enjoy the wine and power
[1:21:38] that jesus gives us
[1:21:40] right but if you can't get along with
[1:21:42] yourself
[1:21:44] how are you going to get along with the
[1:21:45] holy ghost
[1:21:46] so sanctified people can get along with
[1:21:49] themselves right
[1:21:51] but they're still not really getting
[1:21:53] along with the holy ghost
[1:21:56] as far as
[1:21:57] obedience to the word of god
[1:22:02] he said sometimes people a new heart a
[1:22:03] new heart of flesh so
[1:22:05] so you will receive it then a new spirit
[1:22:07] in that heart then i'll put my spirit in
[1:22:09] that you see new heart new spirit and my
[1:22:11] spirit three things he spoke of
[1:22:14] so there it is so ezekiel first preached
[1:22:17] jesus's new wine teaching right
[1:22:19] the new heart is justification which is
[1:22:21] the new animal skin
[1:22:23] you gotta have a new skin first
[1:22:25] and then the new spirit is you gotta
[1:22:26] have oil you gotta have the animal oils
[1:22:28] in those skins
[1:22:30] and then lastly is my spirit then last
[1:22:32] when you have those new new uh then you
[1:22:35] pour in the wine and then the wine can
[1:22:37] grow in power
[1:22:40] glory
[1:22:43] i hope that makes sense brother branham
[1:22:44] taught that
[1:22:46] right i just showed you the quotes
[1:22:47] brother branham teaches this this is how
[1:22:50] jesus's parable on the new wine is
[1:22:53] understood and church that's what i love
[1:22:54] about god there's so much continuity
[1:22:56] with god amen his three numbers right
[1:22:59] justification sanctification baptism
[1:23:01] holy ghost father son holy ghost right
[1:23:04] faith hope and charity all these numbers
[1:23:06] all go together it's the same story we
[1:23:08] just see new scriptures bringing it out
[1:23:11] like the new wine
[1:23:14] ah thank the lord amen
[1:23:16] praise god
[1:23:19] okay
[1:23:24] thank you lord
[1:23:29] so
[1:23:30] that's the baptism of the holy ghost so
[1:23:32] new wine is the seal of god
[1:23:35] in the soul right so the soul is the
[1:23:37] nature so when you have christ's spirit
[1:23:39] in your soul uh that spirit takes more
[1:23:42] control more control it grows how many
[1:23:45] how many believe it
[1:23:47] to grows it grows in your your your
[1:23:50] nature and your desires for god should
[1:23:52] grow
[1:23:54] if it don't i question whether it's
[1:23:56] there
[1:23:58] how can you have wine and it not grows
[1:24:02] praise god
[1:24:04] that's what i'm going to close with a
[1:24:05] little bit
[1:24:07] new wine
[1:24:09] goes to the soul
[1:24:10] but it also goes
[1:24:12] to the spirit
[1:24:14] let me prove it to you because it was
[1:24:15] taught in the old testament as well
[1:24:19] so look at ecclesiastes 10 19 a feast is
[1:24:22] made for laughter and wine makes merry
[1:24:25] that's in the natural but money answers
[1:24:27] all things so see wine represents joy
[1:24:30] gladness refreshment
[1:24:33] right
[1:24:35] so new wine new joy
[1:24:38] new happiness
[1:24:39] i'm refreshed
[1:24:41] right i was tired worn out negative
[1:24:44] depressed now i'm refreshed
[1:24:47] by what new wine
[1:24:51] david's sin with bathsheba he said
[1:24:53] created me a clean heart oh god renew a
[1:24:55] right spirit within me
[1:24:57] cast me not away from thy presence and
[1:24:58] take not the holy spirit for me there's
[1:25:00] that only all right restore to me the
[1:25:02] joy of thy salvation
[1:25:04] he's saying restore the wine to my human
[1:25:07] spirit my thinking right
[1:25:09] and uphold me with thy free spirit then
[1:25:12] will i teach transgressors thy ways and
[1:25:14] sinners shall be converted to thee so
[1:25:17] once i get that new line i'll start
[1:25:19] reaching out to other people
[1:25:21] praise god
[1:25:24] so this is old testament right there was
[1:25:26] old testament joy
[1:25:28] in the holy spirit but it was still in
[1:25:30] the human spirit it was in the second
[1:25:32] realm of man
[1:25:34] right
[1:25:37] look at this remember i preached this a
[1:25:38] few weeks ago with blessings and curses
[1:25:41] because thou serve is not the lord thy
[1:25:43] god with new wine can i say it like that
[1:25:46] i'm talking about in the in the human
[1:25:48] spirit because you didn't let your human
[1:25:50] mind get fresh joy and fresh revelation
[1:25:53] with gladness of heart for the abundance
[1:25:55] of all things therefore you'll serve
[1:25:57] your enemies
[1:25:59] therefore you will be addicted to sin
[1:26:01] which the lord shall send against thee
[1:26:05] and he shall put a yoke an addiction of
[1:26:07] sin
[1:26:08] until you've destroyed thee sounds like
[1:26:10] that brother in the corinthian church
[1:26:12] that was sleeping with his stepmom right
[1:26:14] he sent a devil he said let his soul go
[1:26:16] out to the devil that is i'm sorry let
[1:26:18] his body go to the devil that his soul
[1:26:20] might be saved
[1:26:23] if you won't take the fresh revelation
[1:26:24] if you won't take the new wine that's
[1:26:26] fine god's gonna he's got to chasing you
[1:26:29] right
[1:26:32] huh
[1:26:32] you can you can be a servant a happy
[1:26:34] servant you ever seen one
[1:26:38] a happy servant
[1:26:39] sometimes i get rebuked when we go to
[1:26:40] chick-fil-a and they seem happier to
[1:26:42] serve me than i am to get the food
[1:26:45] they're like
[1:26:46] oh it's my pleasure
[1:26:48] i'm like really
[1:26:51] right or you ever seen a happy waiter or
[1:26:53] happy waitress
[1:26:55] they just love to serve you now i know
[1:26:57] the guy at the car dealership he likes
[1:26:58] to serve you too but he's doing it for
[1:26:59] another reason
[1:27:01] he's happy for that reason i'm making a
[1:27:04] big sale today you know but try to find
[1:27:06] somebody of low estate that just loves
[1:27:09] what they're doing
[1:27:11] right they just love to serve well
[1:27:13] that's rare
[1:27:15] that's rare but god demands it
[1:27:18] god requires it
[1:27:21] if you won't serve with joyfulness and
[1:27:23] gladness of heart that's fine if you
[1:27:25] don't want my wife you can have the
[1:27:26] world
[1:27:29] but you're going to be addicted to the
[1:27:30] world
[1:27:32] and you're going to serve your enemies
[1:27:34] rather than serving me if you won't if
[1:27:35] you won't serve god then you'll serve
[1:27:37] man
[1:27:37] right and jesus said you're going to
[1:27:39] hate you hate one of them i don't want
[1:27:41] to hate jesus i'm going to love jesus
[1:27:43] i want to serve jesus with happiness
[1:27:45] amen
[1:27:46] it's my joy to wear out my voice i've
[1:27:48] been wearing it out for now what 16
[1:27:50] years
[1:27:52] it's a joy to do that's a joy to wear
[1:27:53] myself out for the kingdom of god
[1:27:56] and i should always look at service as
[1:27:58] an opportunity to be joyful
[1:28:01] right and to uh to be glad
[1:28:04] about the things of god
[1:28:08] i love this the queen of sheba heard all
[1:28:11] about
[1:28:11] solomon she's like i'm gonna go test
[1:28:13] this guy out i'm going to go see she
[1:28:15] traveled all the all the way across the
[1:28:16] desert what did she find she said i
[1:28:19] couldn't even believe it i'm not going
[1:28:20] to have time to read it but this is what
[1:28:22] she concludes with
[1:28:23] your men are so happy
[1:28:27] so are your s even your servants are
[1:28:29] happy so around around her uh you know
[1:28:32] palace the servants were not very happy
[1:28:35] but when she got in the presence of
[1:28:38] saints that loved god
[1:28:40] even their servants were happy she said
[1:28:43] something's different here all my
[1:28:44] questions are being answered all the
[1:28:46] doctrines are lined up the gifts of god
[1:28:48] are working and even the lowest of the
[1:28:51] low they're happy praise god happy
[1:28:53] servants in the house of god i know
[1:28:55] god's with you
[1:28:56] amen
[1:28:58] because your servants are happy
[1:29:00] the lowest of the low
[1:29:02] the brother says happiness will reign
[1:29:05] when people rally around the gifts
[1:29:07] right the man said jesus was exhorting
[1:29:09] them uh in the saying of queen esheba
[1:29:11] the queen of the south come from the
[1:29:12] uttermost parts of the world to hear the
[1:29:14] wisdom of solomon god had give a gift
[1:29:17] and that gift was manifested and when
[1:29:19] god ever gives a gift he manifests it
[1:29:21] and may become known for the world and
[1:29:24] some days of solomon's gift the nations
[1:29:27] begin to learn that great things begin
[1:29:28] to take place and all the people with
[1:29:30] one heart and one accord begin to yes
[1:29:33] lord we thank you because we see this
[1:29:35] gift made real and sure
[1:29:37] jehovah is still for us if he'll send us
[1:29:40] a gift like that
[1:29:42] that's what made him happy because we
[1:29:43] see god moving in our midst church when
[1:29:45] we see god moving in our midst it ought
[1:29:47] to make us happy praise god
[1:29:49] it all do something for us to make us
[1:29:52] happy servants of the lord
[1:29:55] i'll serve you jesus all my days because
[1:29:57] you've done this in my life and you
[1:29:59] ministered this way and you answered my
[1:30:00] question here you've done all these
[1:30:02] things that makes me so joyful lord i'll
[1:30:04] do anything i'll serve you all my days
[1:30:08] and that was under the old testament
[1:30:10] church
[1:30:11] that was under the blood of bulls and
[1:30:12] goats not the blood of jesus
[1:30:17] now look
[1:30:18] honoring god with your natural
[1:30:20] possessions brought new wine right so
[1:30:22] you only got new wine if you honored god
[1:30:25] with your possessions
[1:30:26] well the same is applies to spiritual
[1:30:30] if you want new wine in the spiritual
[1:30:32] you've got to honor god with all
[1:30:34] spiritual things
[1:30:37] right in other words you if you want new
[1:30:38] wine you have to make a spiritual
[1:30:41] investment and honor god with your time
[1:30:44] or else you're not getting new wine
[1:30:46] look honor the lord with my substance
[1:30:49] and with the first fruits of all thy
[1:30:50] increase in other words give god first
[1:30:52] place right
[1:30:53] give god your first
[1:30:55] so shall your barns be filled okay so if
[1:30:57] you don't your barns won't be filled
[1:31:00] you got to give god first
[1:31:03] and that and thy presence shall burst
[1:31:05] out with new bursts they'll be mercy
[1:31:07] bursting out with new wine
[1:31:11] if you just give god the first
[1:31:14] give god the first part of your time
[1:31:17] praise god give god the best part of
[1:31:19] your day
[1:31:21] put him first in everything and the
[1:31:23] bible promises new eye will come gushing
[1:31:25] out praise god how many witnesses we got
[1:31:27] out there there you put god first you're
[1:31:29] gonna get a blessing later on praise god
[1:31:32] if you put him first
[1:31:35] the bible says if you sow to the spirit
[1:31:37] you'll reap of the spirit
[1:31:40] so see a natural law teaches you get
[1:31:42] natural wine if you obey the spiritual
[1:31:44] law you get spiritual wise
[1:31:48] so now we know why some people aren't so
[1:31:49] happy all the time
[1:31:51] right they say i believe the message
[1:31:52] they say i believe brother is the
[1:31:54] prophet i believe i got the holy ghost i
[1:31:55] believe well where's all the joy then
[1:31:59] well you only get the joy
[1:32:01] it now i'm not talking about the soul
[1:32:02] you only get the joy in the mind when
[1:32:04] you uh honor god with your mind
[1:32:09] and think god's thoughts first
[1:32:16] psalms 4 6 there be many that say who
[1:32:19] will show us any good lord lift thou up
[1:32:21] the light of thy countenance thy
[1:32:23] presence upon us that or thou hast put
[1:32:26] gladness in my heart more than in the
[1:32:29] time that their corn and wine increased
[1:32:33] so he's saying lord let your presence
[1:32:34] raise up in me in other words i'm going
[1:32:36] to seek your face your countenance i'm
[1:32:38] going to seek your face and i'll feel
[1:32:40] better in your presence than natural
[1:32:42] wine isn't that exactly the spiritual
[1:32:44] wine church the spiritual wine is better
[1:32:47] than natural wine praise god peter tried
[1:32:49] to tell him that on the day of pentecost
[1:32:51] you're saying knew what and that's line
[1:32:53] he said it's spiritual one it's what
[1:32:55] joel prophesied of this spiritual is
[1:32:57] much greater than natural
[1:33:00] oh my
[1:33:01] thank the lord
[1:33:03] this church
[1:33:04] this
[1:33:05] is much the spiritual is much greater
[1:33:08] than the natural line
[1:33:12] but you gotta honor god with the first
[1:33:16] right you gotta under god first
[1:33:19] in the mind and then the new wine is
[1:33:21] promised to come
[1:33:26] now i didn't get to this but i didn't
[1:33:28] actually i didn't have time to get to
[1:33:29] these quotes but brother adam said after
[1:33:31] the revelation of the seals remember he
[1:33:32] shut in for eight days
[1:33:34] eight days he shut in and tried to fast
[1:33:36] and see god he did have a few meals
[1:33:38] but he said the revelation was the
[1:33:40] greatest revelation ever had he said the
[1:33:42] bible became a new bible the services
[1:33:44] were the greatest services he ever had
[1:33:46] with amen and he didn't fly one mile
[1:33:50] oh we think oh well i gotta fly at least
[1:33:52] to the next state to get a good revival
[1:33:55] oh for the bible for me to have a fresh
[1:33:57] start i've gotta at least go there or
[1:34:00] there or there or at least gotta no you
[1:34:02] just gotta get along with jesus
[1:34:04] whatever jesus is that's where you got
[1:34:06] to go praise god amen right right
[1:34:10] can i hear my echo is there an echo out
[1:34:12] there
[1:34:13] kind of
[1:34:15] so if we want the bible to if we're if
[1:34:17] we're you know a little bored reading
[1:34:18] the bible a little bored listen brother
[1:34:20] ram sermons it's because we got to
[1:34:21] change our thoughts
[1:34:24] we got to get back to a new
[1:34:27] spirit
[1:34:28] new thinking
[1:34:32] right because if you try to put new
[1:34:34] revelation in an old dried up mind
[1:34:38] a set in your ways thinking
[1:34:41] it's going to burst
[1:34:46] hallelujah
[1:34:48] now i got lots of scriptures but i'm
[1:34:50] going to try to close here
[1:34:53] the bible said stir up your mind by way
[1:34:55] of remembrance that means stir it up
[1:34:57] that means agitated
[1:34:59] see the only way you're going to be
[1:35:01] excited in your mind
[1:35:02] is by remembering scriptures because the
[1:35:04] bible says stir your minds up by way of
[1:35:06] remembrance
[1:35:08] right so to order to remember scripture
[1:35:11] you most often have to go back to
[1:35:12] scripture or listen to a sermon
[1:35:16] oh i remember that
[1:35:18] oh that was such a blessing praise god
[1:35:21] so if you want a stirred up mind if you
[1:35:22] want a new mind
[1:35:25] the bible says that you got to stir it
[1:35:28] up you got to spend time with god
[1:35:32] if you want new wine you got to put god
[1:35:34] first in your thoughts
[1:35:36] right if you want new wine in your
[1:35:37] experience with god
[1:35:39] remember what the bible say tran how do
[1:35:41] you renew your how do you transform your
[1:35:43] mind
[1:35:44] present your body a living sacrifice
[1:35:46] right
[1:35:48] and then transform your mind and then
[1:35:49] you can prove the perfect will of god
[1:35:52] but it doesn't come until you lay you
[1:35:54] present your body as a sacrifice unto
[1:35:56] god
[1:35:57] see put him first
[1:35:59] put god first pray first read your bible
[1:36:02] first study first
[1:36:03] do that first
[1:36:05] present your body as a living sacrifice
[1:36:07] first and then your mind gets
[1:36:08] transformed then you know the next step
[1:36:10] you know how to do god's will
[1:36:15] see how it all
[1:36:16] see how it all ties together
[1:36:18] i love that we don't have to change our
[1:36:20] doctrine by god's grace i've had to i've
[1:36:22] rarely had to change any my doctor
[1:36:24] and that's a blessing so brother i went
[1:36:26] through the hard times he had to change
[1:36:28] his doctor a lot so we don't have to
[1:36:30] right
[1:36:32] because remember in 1952 he said oh he
[1:36:35] said oh great third person of the
[1:36:36] trinity he said just come and reign in
[1:36:38] our hearts how we love you in our hearts
[1:36:40] and so i sent that to brother joseph i
[1:36:41] said is the third person of trinity
[1:36:43] right in your heart and he said i
[1:36:44] believe every word
[1:36:46] brother ham said was thou saith the lord
[1:36:48] hebrews 13 8
[1:36:50] i said well i don't agree i believe the
[1:36:52] one person of god lives in my heart
[1:36:55] not the third person
[1:36:56] you can believe whatever you want but
[1:36:57] it's not right
[1:37:02] so see all these scriptures about daily
[1:37:04] renewing your mind paul says it twice be
[1:37:06] renewed by the spirit of your mind new
[1:37:09] new new wine new skins
[1:37:12] fresh oil right or fresh oil fresh
[1:37:14] revelation it comes by having a new mind
[1:37:20] renewing your mind that's the first
[1:37:21] thing uh on the armor of god right
[1:37:25] put on uh gird up the loins of your mind
[1:37:28] that's the first thing he says get your
[1:37:29] belt on
[1:37:31] so you're ready to travel right you're
[1:37:32] ready your mind is ready to start
[1:37:34] traveling through these thoughts and
[1:37:35] dealing with all these thoughts get your
[1:37:37] mind ready with truth
[1:37:40] make it new
[1:37:46] brother branham likens the revival in
[1:37:48] that same sermon back there in 57 to
[1:37:50] what a lake that has a storm and it
[1:37:52] pushes out all the trash he said that's
[1:37:54] a that's a revival
[1:37:56] right
[1:37:57] so we want new wine if we want a new
[1:37:59] revival we've got to push out all the
[1:38:02] things we're thinking about watching
[1:38:04] listening to uh sharing with other
[1:38:06] people we got to push out anything that
[1:38:08] doesn't honor god
[1:38:10] and we have to have a new mind we have
[1:38:12] to have new skins
[1:38:14] in order to get the new wine
[1:38:18] praise god
[1:38:19] let me just look at my notes
[1:38:25] all right so in closing i think that's
[1:38:26] my last one yeah that's my last one
[1:38:29] so jesus said no man puts new wine
[1:38:32] in old bottles a man would not be that
[1:38:34] wasteful
[1:38:37] may god help us not to waste our time
[1:38:40] god's not going to waste his time church
[1:38:42] if a man won't even waste his time oh
[1:38:44] this is the old this is the old dry
[1:38:46] condition i'm not going to put wine in
[1:38:48] there i'm going to waste both
[1:38:50] if a man won't even do that jesus said
[1:38:53] god won't even do that
[1:38:56] this means god doesn't send a fresh
[1:38:58] anointing until our hearts
[1:39:00] are made new with repentance
[1:39:03] think about it church when is anybody
[1:39:05] you've ever known received a fresh
[1:39:08] anointing when their attitude
[1:39:10] and their mind is off on the things of
[1:39:12] the world can you name me one
[1:39:14] i can't think of one
[1:39:16] but it's people that they have fresh
[1:39:17] anointings they're like oh i just read
[1:39:19] this in the bible or
[1:39:20] my i just heard this on the tape
[1:39:23] and they're just they're just bubbling
[1:39:25] over right it's new it's fresh wine
[1:39:27] because their minds are totally consumed
[1:39:29] with the things of god
[1:39:32] god will not send a new wine revival to
[1:39:35] have growing power
[1:39:37] until your mind
[1:39:39] is made new
[1:39:42] until all the trash is cast out
[1:39:46] and it's a new skin
[1:39:48] and it's got oil in it
[1:39:50] then he'll pour in that fresh revelation
[1:39:53] of his word
[1:39:57] he'll wait until there's a new skin and
[1:39:59] oil
[1:40:00] and this goes into we jesus said if you
[1:40:02] want to if you want to do the if you
[1:40:04] want your first love if you want your
[1:40:05] your new wine back
[1:40:07] all right if you want the new wine back
[1:40:09] do the first works right
[1:40:11] get your mind back on christ
[1:40:17] he said stir up your minds
[1:40:19] by way of remembrance
[1:40:22] i was listening to a sermon yesterday uh
[1:40:24] invisible union i listened to it what's
[1:40:26] part of it friday the rest of it
[1:40:28] yesterday
[1:40:29] brother branham spent 15 minutes at
[1:40:31] least just with the altar call
[1:40:34] church i how much time do i usually
[1:40:35] spend on the call
[1:40:37] like two minutes
[1:40:39] we'll sing one song
[1:40:41] now i know it was a different age
[1:40:42] but i just it just it just spoke to me
[1:40:45] like he's just giving people a chance to
[1:40:47] recognize do i have new skins
[1:40:51] or do i have old skins
[1:40:53] right and pretty soon one would come up
[1:40:56] and another and remember he said it was
[1:40:58] thanksgiving message he said oh usually
[1:41:00] it's mostly women up here it's mostly
[1:41:01] men up here today
[1:41:03] so god was dealing with men through that
[1:41:05] message
[1:41:07] the men realized i got to renew my mind
[1:41:10] or my mind rather
[1:41:12] so i can have new wine
[1:41:16] and what is wine church
[1:41:18] power
[1:41:20] power
[1:41:21] it's power of joy the joy of the lord is
[1:41:24] my weakness
[1:41:26] i know
[1:41:27] the joy of the lord is my strength
[1:41:31] see when you ask for new wine when you
[1:41:32] ask for fresh wine you're asking i want
[1:41:34] to be stronger to stand up against the
[1:41:37] wiles of satan
[1:41:39] i want to be a stronger witness i want
[1:41:41] to be a stronger testimony i want to
[1:41:43] show people god's love in a stronger way
[1:41:47] lord give me fresh wine
[1:41:49] like david said restore the joy restore
[1:41:52] the gladness restore my happiness while
[1:41:55] i'm serving the lord
[1:41:57] let's stand
[1:42:02] that was good
[1:42:04] thank you holy spirit
[1:42:08] see we don't have to change our doctrine
[1:42:10] it all fits
[1:42:12] see what jesus preached was already
[1:42:14] preached
[1:42:15] by ezekiel
[1:42:17] everything with this that's why we know
[1:42:18] the bible's that's why we know the seals
[1:42:20] have been torn off and the mystery is
[1:42:22] finished because these things jesus said
[1:42:23] they are already preached back there
[1:42:25] by ezekiel by joel by isaiah
[1:42:28] jeremiah
[1:42:32] musicians you can come here
[1:42:40] power power
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:45] oh i didn't i didn't get to this but
[1:42:47] there's so many joy or gladness of heart
[1:42:49] in the new testament on the day of
[1:42:50] pentecost they gladly received his word
[1:42:53] see they had that new spirit
[1:42:58] they went from house to house with their
[1:43:00] meat and gladness and singleness of
[1:43:02] heart
[1:43:06] my
[1:43:07] the gentiles were glad and glorified the
[1:43:11] word of the lord so what does what does
[1:43:13] wine make you do makes you praise god
[1:43:16] makes you worship god
[1:43:19] oh church that's my prayer for you
[1:43:21] and i hope that's your prayer for me
[1:43:22] that we'll be glad
[1:43:25] we'll be joyful

[1:43:33] prayer i'm going to ask the lord to help
[1:43:35] us not be stuck in our ways to break out
[1:43:37] of that
