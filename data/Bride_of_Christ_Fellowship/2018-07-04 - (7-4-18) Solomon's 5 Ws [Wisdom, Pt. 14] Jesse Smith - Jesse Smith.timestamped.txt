[37:39] let's take our Bibles and stand here by
[37:41] God's grace let's go to Ecclesiastes
[37:43] chapter 2 verse 1 I'm gonna keep going
[37:48] on this wisdom series by the grace of
[37:50] God so it's going to Cleese II ask these
[37:56] chapter 2 verse 1 I'll probably start
[38:00] breaking into Ecclesiastes now I preach
[38:02] a little bit of Proverbs and just
[38:04] pulling out the thoughts but I told you
[38:06] on Sunday I'd like to look at this
[38:08] thought of the five W's Solomon's 5w so
[38:10] that's my titles for tonight
[38:11] Solomon's five W's please a C's chapter
[38:20] 2 verse 1 we'll read verses 1 2 3
[38:35] for there say Amen all right please ask
[38:39] you chapter two verse one I said in my
[38:42] heart go to now I will prove thee with
[38:46] mirth which means gladness joyfulness
[38:51] therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this
[38:56] also is vanity I said of laughter it is
[39:02] mad and of mirth what do with it
[39:05] I saw in mine heart to give myself unto
[39:09] wine yet acquainting mine heart with
[39:12] wisdom and to lay hold on folly till I
[39:16] might see what was that good for the
[39:19] sons of men which they should do under
[39:22] the heaven all the days their life now
[39:29] you'll notice there's one of the W's in
[39:31] there it was wine in verse three but
[39:35] there's five W's in proverbs and
[39:37] Ecclesiastes that Solomon goes after if
[39:41] I want to preach on those tonight but
[39:44] let's just bow our heads one more time
[39:45] for word of Prayer if everything on your
[39:47] heart just make a known to God here
[39:48] how many father we come reverently again
[39:51] we ask that you'd speak to us through
[39:52] your word we know you always will where
[39:54] two or three are gathered there you are
[39:55] we know you're here Jesus and I'm
[39:57] thankful that you're here floor without
[39:59] you we don't have a gathering but with
[40:01] you we can sit in heavenly places father
[40:04] just bless us tonight in your divine
[40:05] presence Lord God we ask that the Holy
[40:07] Spirit ministered every heart in Jesus
[40:10] Christ name never a said Amen God bless
[40:13] you to be in seated praise the Lord
[40:22] you know I keep forgetting it's a
[40:24] holiday so happy fourth of July I just
[40:26] keep forgetting doesn't feel like a
[40:27] holiday to me I hope you have the day
[40:29] off brother Jose and then brother man I
[40:31] take that's why you had the day off okay
[40:33] so I wasn't even thinking about it so
[40:34] forgive me and I'm not sure why where
[40:38] our other friends are tonight but May
[40:39] maybe perhaps are at family functions or
[40:41] something like that trust that the Holy
[40:44] Spirit will speak to them tonight amen
[40:48] so I like to look at this thought here I
[40:50] want to look at Solomon's five W's and I
[40:56] believe it'll be a blessing you know I
[40:57] know we already got people live
[40:58] streaming from South Africa because they
[41:00] put a little comments you know so Lord
[41:02] bless the live streamers from South
[41:04] Africa we have some we have a family
[41:06] from Florida who's been streaming all of
[41:08] our services lately so may the Lord be
[41:10] with them as well and speak to them by
[41:12] the the grace of God but I'd like to
[41:15] start with a few scriptures and then I
[41:19] want to look at how brother Branham and
[41:21] Solomon both saw or both saw God and
[41:24] look at those experiences where brother
[41:26] Ram saw Jesus and I can think of two and
[41:29] brother Hosea we might be able to think
[41:30] of a third so we'll get to those in a
[41:34] bit the third one I'm thinking of is
[41:35] when brother Branham saw Jesus and the
[41:38] vision came and said Jehovah the Old
[41:42] Testament is Jesus Christ the new now I
[41:44] don't know if that was a vision or a
[41:45] dream vision okay so that might have
[41:49] been the third time he saw him but I
[41:51] have to and I have a quote where brother
[41:53] Ram says I've seen him twice so there
[41:54] might be another quote where he says
[41:56] I've seen him three times but that's one
[41:59] thing I just thought of as I was
[42:00] preparing so I found two where he
[42:02] definitely said he saw him twice and was
[42:04] so striking because Solomon saw him
[42:06] twice too and so I want to look at those
[42:08] tonight by the grace of God so before I
[42:11] get there though rehearse here the five
[42:14] W's that Solomon tried to give himself
[42:17] to wine works wealth women and worldly
[42:26] wisdom those are the five things I
[42:28] thought was so striking I heard a
[42:29] preacher say I thought really and as I
[42:31] studied the scripture I began to see
[42:33] that was right there was five things he
[42:35] tried to give himself to and he found
[42:37] out he was still lacking and if you know
[42:40] there's one more thing he was lacking
[42:41] there's one more W he was lacking and
[42:44] we'll get to that a little bit by God's
[42:45] grace you can probably guess it but
[42:48] before we get there let's look at the
[42:51] two times that Solomon saw God so let's
[42:56] go to first Kings three I want to start
[42:58] there because I mentioned it to you
[42:59] before let's go to first Kings three the
[43:04] ideals look like a lot with that is to
[43:07] say it's like a another word for that
[43:10] and as your turn there first Kings three
[43:15] Scofield used the that the chronological
[43:19] work of Usher he was a historian oh sure
[43:23] and said that Solomon wrote proverbs in
[43:26] the year 1000 BC so proverbs was written
[43:30] 1000 years before Christ and then uh
[43:33] sure said that Ecclesiastes was written
[43:36] 23 years later in 97 BC so that gives us
[43:42] quite a better understanding
[43:44] proverbs was written first and then
[43:47] Ecclesiastes was written 23 years later
[43:50] after Solomon had tried these five W's
[43:52] and so it's something to keep in mind
[43:54] that we'll understand and I think as
[43:57] I've been if you notice as we've been
[43:59] preaching on proverbs you can sense
[44:01] Solomon's love for the word you can
[44:04] sense his love for wisdom and his
[44:07] urgency to get his son and his children
[44:10] and all those in Israel you can sense
[44:12] his urgency to get them to accept the
[44:15] wisdom of God but then by the time he's
[44:17] old we're gonna read some things tonight
[44:19] it doesn't sound like he's fully sold
[44:22] out to the Lord and we know he wasn't
[44:24] because the Bible said he didn't follow
[44:26] God with all his heart when he got older
[44:28] he fell away so you I hope you can sense
[44:31] that when you read proverbs in Proverbs
[44:33] he was a younger man he had a great more
[44:36] zeal for the Lord but by the time he
[44:38] writes Ecclesiastes he's back slidden
[44:40] he's given himself to these five things
[44:43] and has taken his heart far away from
[44:44] the Lord but of course he would still
[44:47] say thank God for God's mercy
[44:49] but let's go to first Kings 3 verse 1
[44:53] I'm still turning there so bear with me
[44:57] first Kings 3-1 now I want to get the
[45:04] years on this as well like to get the
[45:06] years on this now in first Kings 3 verse
[45:12] 1 butcher's timing here his his date on
[45:19] 1st Kings chapter 3 here is 1014 BC so
[45:27] this took place before the writing of
[45:29] Crowder's and I like uh sure's timing
[45:31] everything seems to fall in line with it
[45:32] in fact remember brother Han used that
[45:34] for preaching Daniels 70 weeks and we
[45:36] know that he used osho's timing for
[45:38] Daniel's 70 weeks so this this vision or
[45:43] this experience takes place 14 years
[45:47] before riding proverbs alright so
[45:49] actually let's go down to verse 4
[45:51] because the vision actually takes place
[45:54] in verse 4 and the king went to give in
[45:57] to sacrifice therefore there was for
[45:59] that was the great high place a thousand
[46:02] offerings that Solomon offer upon that
[46:04] altar high in giving the Lord appeared
[46:07] to Solomon in a dream by night and God
[46:10] said ask what I shall give thee and
[46:14] Solomon said thou has shewed unto thy
[46:18] servant David my father great mercy
[46:20] according his walked before the in truth
[46:22] and in righteousness and an uprightness
[46:23] of heart with thee and thou has kept for
[46:26] him this great kindness that thou has
[46:28] given him a son to sit on his throne as
[46:30] it is this day and now O Lord my god
[46:34] thou hast made thy servant King instead
[46:36] of David my father and I am but a little
[46:38] child I know not how to go out or come
[46:42] in and thy servant is in the midst of
[46:45] thy people which thou has chosen a great
[46:47] people that cannot be numbered nor
[46:49] counted for multitude give therefore thy
[46:52] servant an understanding heart to judge
[46:54] thy people then I may discern between
[46:56] good and bad for who is able to judge
[46:59] this thy so great a people and the
[47:02] speech please
[47:03] Lord that Salman had asked this thing so
[47:06] we can get a good lesson how many want
[47:07] to please the Lord if you want to please
[47:09] the Lord humble yourself and make
[47:11] yourself like Solomon that I'm nobody
[47:13] Who am I to judge this great people I'm
[47:17] just a little child I'm just I'll just -
[47:19] me I'm just a I'm a know-nothing man I'm
[47:21] nobody I'm just a little nobody help me
[47:25] Lord I need your grace I need your
[47:26] wisdom and understanding
[47:28] I like his hum or humility before the
[47:31] Lord look at verse 11 and God sending
[47:34] him because thou has asked this thing
[47:36] and not has not asked for thyself long
[47:39] life neither has asked riches for
[47:41] thyself nor has asked the life of mine
[47:43] enemies but has asked for thyself
[47:45] understanding to discern judgment behold
[47:48] I have done according to thy words
[47:50] though I have given thee a wise and
[47:52] understanding heart so that there was
[47:54] none like thee before thee neither after
[47:57] the shall any arise like unto thee and I
[48:02] have also given thee that which thou has
[48:04] not asked both riches and honour so that
[48:06] there shall not to be any among the
[48:08] kings like unto thee all thy days and if
[48:13] thou wilt walk in my ways to keep my
[48:15] statutes and my Commandments as thy
[48:17] father David did walk then I will
[48:19] lengthen thy days and Psalm awoke and
[48:22] behold it was a dream when he came to
[48:24] Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of
[48:25] the Covenant of the Lord and offered him
[48:27] burnt offerings and offered peace
[48:28] offerings and made a feast to all of his
[48:31] servants amen so that was BC 10 14 so 14
[48:36] years before he wrote proverbs let's
[48:38] gonna go to first Kings chapter 9 here's
[48:41] the second time he appears so this is
[48:44] ten years later ten years later looks
[48:48] like he appears no I'm sorry this is ten
[48:54] plus eight this is 18 years later in 92
[48:57] BC sorry that was the year for the
[48:59] previous chapter 992 BC now it's a first
[49:06] Kings chapter 9 verse 1 and it came to
[49:09] pass when Solomon had finished the
[49:10] building of the house of Lord and the
[49:12] King's house and all Solomon's desire
[49:13] which he was pleased to do that the Lord
[49:16] appeared to Solomon the second time
[49:17] as he had peered under him at Gibeon and
[49:19] the Laursen and him I have heard thy
[49:21] prayer and thy supplication that thou
[49:23] has made before me I have hollow this
[49:25] house which thou hast built to put my
[49:30] name there forever and mine eyes in my
[49:32] heart shall be there perpetually on that
[49:34] beautiful
[49:35] God's eyes and hearts are at the throne
[49:39] of God amen
[49:39] and if thy will walk before me as David
[49:43] thy father walked in integrity of heart
[49:45] and in uprightness to do according to
[49:47] all that I have commanded thee and will
[49:49] keep my statutes and my judgments then I
[49:51] will establish the throne of thy kingdom
[49:53] upon Israel forever as I promised a
[49:55] David thy father saying there shall not
[49:57] fail thee a man upon the throne of
[49:59] Israel but if thou shalt at all turn
[50:07] from following me he or your children
[50:09] and will not keep my Commandments and my
[50:11] statutes which I've set before you but
[50:13] go and serve other gods and worship them
[50:15] then I will cut off Israel out of the
[50:16] land which I have given them in this
[50:18] house which I have hollowed for my name
[50:20] will I cast out of my sight and Israel
[50:23] shall be a proverb and a byword among
[50:25] all the people did that happen Church
[50:26] yeah that happened they got scattered
[50:30] and at this house which is high everyone
[50:34] that passes by it shall be astonished
[50:35] and shall hiss and they shall say why
[50:37] hath the Lord done thus unto this land
[50:40] into this house and they shall answer
[50:42] because they first took the Lord their
[50:44] God who brought forth their fathers out
[50:46] of the land of Egypt and have taken hold
[50:48] upon other gods and have worshipped them
[50:50] and served them therefore hath the Lord
[50:52] brought upon them all this evil amen
[50:56] okay so eighteen years later God appears
[51:00] to him and the Bible said it was the
[51:02] second time that God appeared to Solomon
[51:06] now as I was mentioning brother Jose it
[51:09] seems like brother branham saw Jesus
[51:11] maybe three times I have a quote where
[51:13] he said - so I'm gonna read those
[51:16] tonight the first time he saw Jesus
[51:18] while praying for his father in a field
[51:21] at night in a sage field
[51:25] the second time was laying on his bed
[51:28] after nine days of being sick and
[51:31] seeing some campaign meetings so I'll go
[51:34] through those I'll read through those
[51:35] tonight now I thought there was a third
[51:37] time where like I said he saw Jesus and
[51:39] said and the voice said you know Jehovah
[51:43] the Old Testament Jesus the new so I
[51:44] have to look that up I thought I thought
[51:46] that maybe the third time now so let's
[51:49] read this in 1953 in Chicago brother
[51:51] Branham said I say this with reverence I
[51:53] seen him twice course it was a vision he
[51:57] was standing in the air one night I
[52:00] stood and I even broke a straw off the
[52:02] field put it in my mouth and shoot it I
[52:03] looked again I said sure this is not a
[52:05] vision I stood there in the broom sedge
[52:08] sage field looking and I've been praying
[52:11] all night so look when God appeared to
[52:13] him you know and he prayed a long time
[52:15] and I looked again and I seen him with
[52:17] his foot like that and his hands folded
[52:20] looking towards the east and I walked
[52:22] toward this way and cleared my throat
[52:24] and when he looked around at me raised
[52:26] out his arms I fainted and didn't come
[52:29] to - the next morning and I have an idea
[52:32] what he looks like
[52:34] and so that's the first time after he's
[52:37] praying for his father in a Sage field
[52:38] he's praying all night he was trying to
[52:41] get the front to see Jesus's face Jesus
[52:43] looked over with his arms open he passed
[52:45] out and he woke up the next morning on
[52:46] the ground all right so brother BAM
[52:54] more about this in 1955 he said one
[52:57] night I saw our Lord Jesus I'm saying
[52:59] this with permission I believe from the
[53:00] Holy Spirit the angel Lord that comes is
[53:03] not the Lord Jesus I'm gonna understand
[53:05] that the age of the Lord was different
[53:07] than the Lord Jesus they're one that was
[53:09] the angel one was the Lord he says it
[53:12] doesn't look like him in the same vision
[53:14] for in the vision I saw the Lord Jesus
[53:15] he was a little man and there he see
[53:25] tells again about this experience he
[53:26] said they're standing not over ten feet
[53:28] from me stood a man a white garment on a
[53:30] little fella his arms folded like this a
[53:33] beard kind of sort hair down to his
[53:35] shoulder so that brother am sees Jesus
[53:36] and he's got hair down to his shoulders
[53:38] and he was looking sideways for me
[53:40] peaceful looking but I couldn't
[53:42] understand it how his feet one just
[53:44] behind the other and the wind blowing
[53:47] his robe moving and sedge or sage
[53:50] blowing I thought now wait a minute now
[53:52] I'm not asleep he said I pulled a little
[53:54] piece of sage off you know I'm got a
[53:56] toothpick in it put it in my mouth I
[53:58] look back toward the house and I said no
[54:00] I was in there praying for my dad and
[54:03] something come out here and here stands
[54:05] this man I thought that looks like the
[54:06] Lord Jesus I wonder if it was and I
[54:09] thought I believe I'll call him and I
[54:11] said Jesus and when I did he looked
[54:14] around like that that was all I remember
[54:16] he just reached out his arms amen
[54:19] he said there's not an artist in the
[54:22] world that can paint his picture the
[54:23] characters of his face the best I've
[54:25] ever seen his Hoffman's head of Christ
[54:28] at 33 I've got it on all literature and
[54:30] everything I use that's because it looks
[54:33] just like that or pretty near as close
[54:35] as it could be he looked like a man that
[54:38] if he'd speak the world would come to an
[54:41] end and yet with so much love and
[54:43] kindness till I just pitched over and at
[54:45] daylight I find myself just in the break
[54:48] of day pajama shirt soaking wet with
[54:50] tears he cried and got his own shirt wet
[54:53] when I come to myself walking back
[54:56] through that broom Sedgefield
[54:58] home amen all right
[55:02] that's there's a third time I could read
[55:04] but I'm not gonna read that just for the
[55:06] time sake but I want to read this next
[55:10] one this was in 1960 as he laid on his
[55:14] bed and it happened my brother Brahim
[55:18] says this he said I wanted to a little
[55:23] something he talks about this experience
[55:27] he says he said I felt a little nudge
[55:32] and said well for my brother and sake
[55:34] I'll set the meeting and as soon as I
[55:35] arrived in this valley my throat closed
[55:37] up so in 1960 his throat closed up and
[55:40] he missed some meetings and he said and
[55:43] I didn't speak for nine days until the
[55:45] meetings passed by brother otto he may
[55:48] be here this morning one of the brothers
[55:50] Junie Jackson I supposed to have a
[55:51] meeting for him he said my throat is too
[55:55] hoarse I couldn't preach the meetings he
[55:57] said I laid in bed for nine days with
[55:59] just a high fever burning and many of my
[56:03] brethren came to see me many famous
[56:05] brothers come prayed for me brother
[56:07] Graham Snelling brother rudder all these
[56:09] brothers hear me praying trying my best
[56:12] I couldn't even whisper I wondered
[56:15] what's it all about my what lovely
[56:16] wife's sitting there her praying them
[56:18] for me just kept on staying just the
[56:20] same they couldn't understand they give
[56:23] me some medicine and but I didn't take
[56:25] it because it was dope well they try to
[56:27] give him dope but he wouldn't take dope
[56:28] amen I just kept thinking surely Lord
[56:31] and then after the meetings was all over
[56:34] on the Monday afterwards I tried to get
[56:36] up and I was so weak I couldn't go
[56:37] through the room and I sat down and this
[56:40] is where his wife rebuked him because he
[56:42] said he said sometimes I wonder if Jesus
[56:45] even called me to preach he's been
[56:49] preaching since 1933 this is now 1960 so
[56:53] 20 27 years and he says I wonder if God
[56:56] even called me to preach and his wife
[56:57] said ain't you ashamed of yourself and
[57:01] she told me bill don't you know that God
[57:04] knows just what he's doing just be quiet
[57:07] and he said I kind of rebuked me a
[57:10] little and he said but you know I'm so
[57:14] thankful for a wife
[57:16] like that oh my all right he said less
[57:25] than an hour the people drove right up
[57:27] to my door and there's three men at
[57:29] woman and a man and they come up to give
[57:33] my thus saith the Lord and he sent him
[57:37] brother Freddie went up and told the
[57:38] people and then after a while I was on
[57:40] the bed I thought why does it happen
[57:42] that way why can't I speak why can't I
[57:44] talk to somebody I was laying there and
[57:46] me to come in and was going back out of
[57:48] the room and I looked and I seen
[57:50] something make a flicker over to one
[57:53] side and I looked and there was my wall
[57:55] opened up and I seen Jesus so can you
[57:58] imagine a wall opening up he said I seen
[58:01] Jesus Hama never heard me say that I've
[58:05] seen Jesus twice in my life in a vision
[58:07] so this is in March of 63 brother Jose
[58:11] I'm sorry April
[58:12] so that if he saw him again it must have
[58:15] been after that so this is April 16 1960
[58:19] sorry well yeah I'm sorry mark
[58:23] April 60 I'm sorry oh right yeah yeah
[58:30] that might have to look for more times
[58:31] yeah so this is April 1960 he says the
[58:39] wall opened up and I believed I would
[58:41] seen him again before the end time and I
[58:43] seen him and I looked in the skies was
[58:46] right out there just looked like I
[58:47] looked through the wall and there was
[58:49] the Bible standing like this the great
[58:51] big Bible standing in the skies a good
[58:53] picture now Bible in the skies well
[58:55] there's something got light around the
[58:57] Bible and out of the Bible come a pretty
[59:00] golden cross and it stood out like this
[59:04] and the lights coming from around it and
[59:07] out of that cross he walked so out of a
[59:10] Bible comes across and how the cross
[59:12] comes Jesus amen
[59:14] where do you and I find Jesus in the
[59:16] cross amen where do we find the cross in
[59:19] the Bible amen
[59:20] beautiful and the Bible reflected the
[59:23] cross and the cross reflected him and he
[59:26] come walking out he walked right down to
[59:28] where I was at and I can see it just his
[59:29] plane I
[59:30] see the cross reflecting his hair
[59:32] standing there hung down over his face
[59:33] he looked down at me like that and he
[59:38] said to me look what he tells him you
[59:41] are waiting for your new ministry to be
[59:43] confirmed to you which was remember the
[59:45] third pole which was just the opening of
[59:48] the word it was speaking the word but is
[59:49] also preaching the word the seals all
[59:52] these things but Jesus said I've already
[59:56] confirmed it to you it's already
[59:58] confirmed you've got to accept it see
[1:00:02] and I stood and listened to him just a
[1:00:04] minute it come to my mind I didn't hear
[1:00:06] that it just come to my mind like a man
[1:00:07] that he's been a sinner all his life and
[1:00:10] he knows that there's a Bible knows
[1:00:11] there's a God but all at once here's a
[1:00:13] sermon then something tells him it's you
[1:00:14] then that same words been there all the
[1:00:17] time yet it's confirmed to him and he
[1:00:19] says and then he says Lord forgive me
[1:00:21] but it won't do no good until he accept
[1:00:24] this salvation yes and then he goes out
[1:00:27] as a Christian no matter how much he
[1:00:28] cries no matter how much he begs he's
[1:00:30] got to accept it so remember I'm saying
[1:00:32] just like we have to accept salvation he
[1:00:35] had to accept that his third pole was
[1:00:37] already given amen and he said to me
[1:00:40] then you've got to accept it the same
[1:00:41] way you've got to believe it and then
[1:00:47] jeez
[1:00:47] said but you walk with too many to walk
[1:00:50] with me you'd walk you will have to walk
[1:00:54] alone he says you walk alone he said no
[1:01:00] more than that vision left me I said
[1:01:02] Amen Lord and my wife was sitting there
[1:01:05] almost fainted I jumped up by the bed
[1:01:07] and I could talk as good as I ever did
[1:01:09] just in a second every bit of the fever
[1:01:11] left me amen
[1:01:13] so God gave a fever to Humble them and
[1:01:16] get him in a place where he could see
[1:01:18] Jesus and let him know you need to
[1:01:20] accept your next stage of your ministry
[1:01:23] you've just got to believe it and then
[1:01:25] as soon as he said I believe it amen
[1:01:28] I believe the third pole is gonna take
[1:01:30] effect as soon as he said that the fever
[1:01:32] left him and he could talk again amen
[1:01:34] hallelujah
[1:01:38] now that's what I wanted to share there
[1:01:42] about that let me look up real quick
[1:01:49] Jehovah the old and let me look after
[1:01:54] 1960 because it was April of 60 this
[1:02:06] might
[1:02:06] right here oh yeah looks like in the
[1:02:12] message of grace 1961 looks like oh yeah
[1:02:22] here it is yeah let me pick this up this
[1:02:23] is a last year all of you know which is
[1:02:25] on the print and a testimony the tapes I
[1:02:27] was sitting at a place here in Indiana
[1:02:29] where the Lord came down and spoke to me
[1:02:31] that my second ministry that was ready
[1:02:33] to take place in the near future and
[1:02:35] there was spoken into existence three
[1:02:37] squirrels all of you know the story I'm
[1:02:38] sure somehow going up the road while I
[1:02:41] let the rest of the boys go off going
[1:02:43] hunting I had a strange feeling to go to
[1:02:44] this place again it was before daylight
[1:02:46] raining and I didn't even know whether
[1:02:48] they'd get to hunt or not but that I
[1:02:49] would get over in the field they're
[1:02:51] hunting means to get alone to yourself
[1:02:53] to pray amen and I stopped the car and
[1:02:56] got off and walked across the road and
[1:02:58] went over into the bush and just before
[1:03:01] it would have been daylight it's kind of
[1:03:02] gray and Dawn ok let me make sure I save
[1:03:06] this quote here all right Oh
[1:03:18] Neeta to provide it I don't believe in
[1:03:21] wasting anything or destroying never
[1:03:22] shot a burner in my life for a target
[1:03:24] practice or anything what I hunt I eat
[1:03:26] or give to someone that does need it or
[1:03:28] does eat it I don't believe in wasting
[1:03:30] anything I don't believe in doing those
[1:03:32] things because it's not right then as I
[1:03:34] turn and started along a fermier little
[1:03:36] pathway by the side of the pasture that
[1:03:38] crossed over to an l-shape in the woods
[1:03:40] and something strange took place all my
[1:03:43] experience is I've never had anything
[1:03:44] like that I looked at the top of the
[1:03:46] hill to my left from where I was
[1:03:48] standing in there coming out of the top
[1:03:49] of the hill came three rainbows and they
[1:03:54] were running some thirty feet high first
[1:03:58] I looked and I seen that light and I
[1:03:59] just turned back because I thought it
[1:04:01] might be the Sun raising upon the second
[1:04:05] thought it wasn't towards the Sun it was
[1:04:06] towards the south and another thing it
[1:04:08] was smooth cloudy rain raining all over
[1:04:10] that was August the 25th last Friday
[1:04:13] morning okay so now we know the day
[1:04:14] August 25th 1961 and you know how it was
[1:04:19] raining and it's smooth clouds
[1:04:20] everywhere and I looked again and there
[1:04:22] it was growing taller and taller three
[1:04:24] rainbows I took off my hat I set down my
[1:04:27] gun I started walking towards it with my
[1:04:28] hands up something just seemed to tell
[1:04:30] me this is close enough I was going to
[1:04:32] sit down and take off my boots that I
[1:04:34] had on to see if I could walk a little
[1:04:36] closer but I got within a few yards of
[1:04:38] it and I seen the color of it misting
[1:04:40] like a fog moving around I stood still
[1:04:42] for a few moments it was coming right
[1:04:44] out of the top of the little mountain
[1:04:46] and I watched as the three one to the
[1:04:48] right one to the left one in the center
[1:04:49] running down into one Bowl like ever it
[1:04:52] was was alive it was moving and making
[1:04:54] its motions and I stood there just as it
[1:04:57] was graying dawn I turned and looked
[1:04:59] again and I screamed out Oh God what
[1:05:01] would you have your servant to know ok I
[1:05:04] see I think it is now I don't think he
[1:05:07] sees Jesus I think he just hears a voice
[1:05:09] just then the spear Lord came in and
[1:05:11] said Jesus of the Old Testament is
[1:05:13] Jehovah of the old he only changes Mass
[1:05:17] from spirit to man that was confirming
[1:05:19] of course my message of him letting me
[1:05:21] know
[1:05:22] assured that these 31 years hasn't been
[1:05:25] in vain today it looks like he just sees
[1:05:28] the light
[1:05:30] yeah so then though he said the light
[1:05:32] went down and then it disappeared yeah
[1:05:37] so it's just a lie okay yeah so that
[1:05:39] that clears it up I was wondering about
[1:05:40] that I thought he had seen it but it
[1:05:43] looks like it wasn't okay all right so
[1:05:46] anyways my point now is that Solomon
[1:05:48] psalm twice in dreams brother Branham
[1:05:51] saw him at least twice in visions okay
[1:05:54] now let's go to Ecclesiastes chapter 1
[1:06:00] how am i doing on time okay
[1:06:02] well that took a little bit of time I
[1:06:08] want to start in Ecclesiastes chapter 1
[1:06:11] before we get to chapter 2 because
[1:06:13] chapter 2 will be just a short little
[1:06:15] portion by the grace of the Lord yeah
[1:06:25] now let's read all of Ecclesiastes
[1:06:27] chapter 1 it's just a rather short
[1:06:28] chapter and I'm just gonna make a few
[1:06:30] comments on this by the grace of Lord
[1:06:32] got about a half hour left to preach
[1:06:34] hours so that's pretty good now it says
[1:06:37] the words of the preacher the son of
[1:06:39] David King in Jerusalem now we know this
[1:06:45] is Salman okay because let's look at
[1:06:47] just skip ahead to verse 12 real quick
[1:06:49] now can you put up verse 12
[1:06:51] alright the preacher was king over
[1:06:54] Israel in Jerusalem now the scripture CH
[1:06:58] this scripture proves this could only be
[1:07:00] Solomon some people say well it could be
[1:07:02] another son of David no this has to be
[1:07:05] Solomon because he was king over all
[1:07:07] Israel no other king other than David
[1:07:10] was king over all of Israel because
[1:07:12] after Solomon we know the kingdom
[1:07:14] divided so I just want to give you proof
[1:07:16] so you have confidence that this was
[1:07:18] Solomon now also you're gonna see later
[1:07:20] this this rider says he was greater than
[1:07:23] any king before after him so we know it
[1:07:26] has to be Solomon but just so nobody can
[1:07:29] ever tell you different okay let's go
[1:07:31] back to verse 2 vanity of vanities say
[1:07:35] it the preacher vanity of vanities all
[1:07:37] is vanity what prophet at the man of all
[1:07:42] is labor which he had taken
[1:07:44] Under the Sun now this Paul's right
[1:07:45] there no this is 23 years after he wrote
[1:07:49] proverbs he's had 23 more years to live
[1:07:53] his life and we know what happened
[1:07:55] he's fallen away his heart has got cold
[1:07:58] toward God now huh me know what the word
[1:08:01] vanity means anyone know what it means
[1:08:02] it means vapour or breath so you let out
[1:08:07] a little vapor that's vanity now another
[1:08:11] word for is fleeting which means it
[1:08:14] doesn't last long so when he says
[1:08:16] vanities of vanities he's saying this is
[1:08:19] fleeting of fleeting this is a very
[1:08:21] short thing this doesn't last very long
[1:08:24] this is very scarce thing he's not
[1:08:27] saying it's worthless so I don't want
[1:08:29] you to think that when we read this we
[1:08:31] think vanity means useless or worthless
[1:08:33] and that's not true
[1:08:35] it doesn't mean worthless it means
[1:08:37] fleeting it's not going to last because
[1:08:41] how many know our days are not in vain I
[1:08:43] mean oh the New Testament says your
[1:08:45] labor is not in vain amen hallelujah
[1:08:47] there's no day that's worthless right
[1:08:50] for the Christian there's no day where
[1:08:52] you get up and say oh that's just a
[1:08:53] worthless day what a work
[1:08:54] what would a waste no every day is
[1:08:57] valuable every day is teaching you
[1:08:59] something and there's nothing you do in
[1:09:01] vain for the Lord because he sees it all
[1:09:04] and he's constantly adding to your
[1:09:06] character how me know that he's adding
[1:09:08] this and adding that adding that that's
[1:09:10] the whole goal of man is to have the
[1:09:12] character of Christ
[1:09:13] slowly daily added to you so don't let
[1:09:18] anyone tell you your life is worthless
[1:09:20] or any day's worthless or well Solomon
[1:09:23] said my life's worthless it's not worth
[1:09:25] us this is a backslidden man and he's
[1:09:28] saying your life is fleeting it's going
[1:09:31] to go fast
[1:09:32] before you know it Lily will be grown up
[1:09:34] before you know that occasion Genevieve
[1:09:36] will be grown up all the children before
[1:09:38] you know it it's fleeting it goes fast I
[1:09:45] want you to
[1:09:47] by God's grace so any small thing is in
[1:09:50] small value compared to Eternity that's
[1:09:53] why we must dedicate all of our time to
[1:09:56] eternal things as much of our time as we
[1:09:58] can we should devote it to eternal
[1:10:00] things I wonder how many people are not
[1:10:01] in church tonight not even this church
[1:10:03] or it could be this church or other
[1:10:05] churches I wonder how many people didn't
[1:10:06] go to their Wednesday night service
[1:10:08] because it was July 4th just like on
[1:10:11] Christmas I wonder how many people skip
[1:10:13] church if Christmas falls on a Sunday or
[1:10:15] whatever holiday it is see people get
[1:10:19] caught up in in worldly things and they
[1:10:22] forget how I'm eternal the Word of God
[1:10:25] is and how many that they must invest
[1:10:27] their best and they must give most of
[1:10:30] their sacrifices to eternal things amen
[1:10:32] now verse 3 even he's even asking what
[1:10:37] profit is there for a man of all's labor
[1:10:40] under which he had taken under the Sun
[1:10:41] like what benefit is there in all the
[1:10:44] works
[1:10:45] look at verse 4 one generation passes
[1:10:48] away another generation comes with the
[1:10:51] earth abideth for ever so in this
[1:10:54] portion he's saying how the earth is the
[1:10:57] only thing that abides because it's on
[1:10:59] cycles everything else ends the earth is
[1:11:03] the only real thing that stays let's go
[1:11:06] to verse 5 the Sun Also Rises and the
[1:11:08] Sun go down and hastens to his place
[1:11:10] place where he arose so even he could
[1:11:13] say my the Sun is time is going by so
[1:11:15] fast it's like the Sun is more quickly
[1:11:17] going down it seems like every day goes
[1:11:19] a little faster right verse 6 the wind
[1:11:22] goeth toward the south and turneth about
[1:11:24] unto the north it were with about
[1:11:26] continually
[1:11:27] and the wind returneth again according
[1:11:29] to his circuits all the rivers run into
[1:11:31] the sea yet the sea is not full unto the
[1:11:34] place from whence the rivers come
[1:11:35] thither they return again all things are
[1:11:38] full of labor man cannot utter it the
[1:11:41] eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the
[1:11:43] ear filled with the hearing so he's
[1:11:47] expressing how how life seems like it so
[1:11:52] goes so fast it doesn't seem like it's
[1:11:56] fulfilling verse 9
[1:12:00] now he gets in this portion how there's
[1:12:02] nothing new Under the Sun verses 9 10
[1:12:04] and 11 the thing that hath been it which
[1:12:07] shall be and that which is done is that
[1:12:10] which shall be done and there's no new
[1:12:12] thing under the Sun how many can same
[1:12:14] internet although the the you know the
[1:12:16] world what's new to the world is
[1:12:17] homosexual marriages that's new but
[1:12:19] that's not even that was done in Sodom
[1:12:21] right that's already been done
[1:12:24] technology mine we have small technology
[1:12:27] compared to what Enoch had right and
[1:12:31] Egypt and how they would have mom bodies
[1:12:33] for thousands of years and we can't even
[1:12:35] touch that as far as everything that's
[1:12:37] been done has already been done there's
[1:12:40] nothing really new Under the Sun verse
[1:12:43] 10 is there any new thing wherever it
[1:12:46] may be said see this is new it hath been
[1:12:48] already of old time which was before us
[1:12:50] there's no remembrance of former things
[1:12:53] neither shall there be any remembrance
[1:12:54] of those things that are to come with
[1:12:56] those that should come after so Solomon
[1:12:58] realized that does anybody really
[1:13:00] remember what happened last year or the
[1:13:02] year before most people just forget and
[1:13:05] they move on but you know as Christians
[1:13:08] we should stop and remember how
[1:13:10] important the holidays aren't like today
[1:13:11] like remember last year I preached on
[1:13:13] Veterans Day and I'm sorry Memorial Day
[1:13:15] and the Revolutionary War
[1:13:17] Christians as Christians we should
[1:13:19] remember those days and we should make
[1:13:22] sure it counts we should change our
[1:13:24] thoughts and we should take time to
[1:13:25] thank the Lord that's why I like in May
[1:13:28] last month in our two months in May on
[1:13:30] Memorial Day that's why we take our
[1:13:32] family to the parades so they can they
[1:13:34] can remember they can hear the stories
[1:13:36] about the soldiers who died in World War
[1:13:38] one or World War two or the Korean War
[1:13:40] and remember that and and we should look
[1:13:43] at the gravestones I remember that
[1:13:45] people gave their lives and that should
[1:13:47] make us want to live more closely to
[1:13:49] Christ because of the freedoms that we
[1:13:51] have verse 12 now Solomon begins his
[1:13:57] search he's expressed these things it
[1:14:00] seems like life is so fleeting now he
[1:14:03] starts his search of verse 12 I the
[1:14:05] preacher was Queen was king rather over
[1:14:07] Israel in Jerusalem and I gave my heart
[1:14:09] to search I'm sorry to seek and search
[1:14:12] out by wisdom concerning all things
[1:14:14] under the heaven this sort surveil hath
[1:14:17] God given to the sons of man to be
[1:14:19] exercised there with now it's
[1:14:25] interesting that Solomon wanted to
[1:14:28] search out wisdom when God had already
[1:14:29] given him wisdom to see this shows he's
[1:14:34] back slidden he already remember God
[1:14:36] said I've already given you the gift of
[1:14:38] wisdom he's already given wisdom and so
[1:14:41] see this is he wants to search out
[1:14:43] worldly wisdom it's kind of like this
[1:14:45] it's kind of like how people grow up in
[1:14:47] church or how many know of anybody
[1:14:49] that's growing up in the message or
[1:14:50] growing up in church and then they lived
[1:14:51] they live pretty clean but when they get
[1:14:53] older they kind of want to experiment
[1:14:55] well I never got to party so I want to
[1:14:56] know what it's like the party well I
[1:14:59] never got to use drugs I want to go when
[1:15:01] I feel what it's like to use drugs I
[1:15:03] never got the fornicator I never got to
[1:15:05] do I never got drunk so I wonder and so
[1:15:08] that's kind of what he's doing God had
[1:15:09] already given him wisdom and he says but
[1:15:11] I want to go try this I want to search
[1:15:14] it out more and that was a mistake he
[1:15:17] should not have done that but how many
[1:15:20] know it huh me know there's a great
[1:15:22] testimony in growing up in purity but
[1:15:25] also remaining pure amen huh me know
[1:15:29] that's a great testimony you've heard
[1:15:31] people like you met when Tim McKinney
[1:15:32] used to come
[1:15:33] Tim McKinney has his testimony he was
[1:15:35] raised in church and member Tim McKinney
[1:15:37] said he said you know some brothers have
[1:15:40] testimonies they were drunks and they
[1:15:42] were they lived in morally and they were
[1:15:44] smokers and they did all kinds of drugs
[1:15:46] they have a great testimony that God
[1:15:48] brought them out of that he said but my
[1:15:50] testimony is God kept me away from that
[1:15:53] and my testimony was of God's keeping
[1:15:55] power God's power to keep me pure from
[1:15:58] all of it and God's power to keep me
[1:16:02] from going into it aim ahead on a oh
[1:16:05] yeah I like that that's a great
[1:16:06] testimony that's a testimony I want from
[1:16:08] Malachi Lydia acacia Haman Karras
[1:16:12] Genevieve and Victoria I want them to be
[1:16:17] raised in church Lily - I want to be
[1:16:20] raised in church and stay pure from the
[1:16:23] things of the world and have the
[1:16:24] testimony that I didn't have to go out
[1:16:26] into the world because God
[1:16:28] show me that I could be satisfied with
[1:16:30] him and live a Pure Life all the days of
[1:16:32] my life hey hey man hallelujah but see
[1:16:35] Solomon wasn't content with that Solomon
[1:16:38] was given wisdom when a few years later
[1:16:40] he's like ha I just want to try and I
[1:16:42] want to dabble into some of these things
[1:16:43] Oh may God help us to pray for our young
[1:16:47] people or young children that they don't
[1:16:48] dabble in the sin amen
[1:16:52] hope you can see that that's verse 13
[1:16:56] what greater wisdom could he want
[1:16:59] outside of the wisdom of God but here he
[1:17:01] says he's got to search out for more
[1:17:03] wisdom 9 verse 14 now in verse 14 and 15
[1:17:08] he said everything is vexation of spirit
[1:17:10] I've seen all the works that are done
[1:17:12] under the Sun and behold all is vanity
[1:17:14] and vexation of spirit that which is
[1:17:16] crooked cannot be made straight and that
[1:17:18] which is wanting cannot be numbered so
[1:17:23] we see that vexation means a longing or
[1:17:26] striving which means hard work so
[1:17:28] Solomon sees everything done he says ma
[1:17:30] this is all fleeting and it's very hard
[1:17:32] work how many brothers and mothers work
[1:17:34] really hard there's a huh it's hard to
[1:17:37] maintain a house and keep it clean it's
[1:17:38] hard to go to work 50 or 60 hours a week
[1:17:41] that's hard there's a lot of hardness in
[1:17:44] that and he noticed that and he said
[1:17:46] sometimes things get messed up and they
[1:17:48] don't get made straight it doesn't look
[1:17:49] like they get made straight sometimes it
[1:17:52] seems like there's no justice done you
[1:17:54] know someone has done wrong or if
[1:17:56] someone gets murdered or or there's some
[1:17:58] awful there's a theft or there's some
[1:18:00] awful thing that happens and it doesn't
[1:18:02] seem like it gets made straight but of
[1:18:07] course we know God makes all things
[1:18:08] beautiful in his own time but this is a
[1:18:11] mind battle Solomon's going through
[1:18:12] memories in this backside in the state
[1:18:14] now let's go to verse 16 and 18 or 16
[1:18:19] through 18 we'll finish the chapter I
[1:18:20] commune with mine own heart saying lo I
[1:18:23] am come to great estate and have got
[1:18:25] more wisdom than all they that have been
[1:18:26] before me and Jerusalem yay my heart had
[1:18:29] great experience of wisdom and knowledge
[1:18:30] and I gave my heart to know wisdom and
[1:18:32] to know madness and folly now I see
[1:18:34] that's the see the bad part right there
[1:18:36] he gave his heart to know what mad
[1:18:39] and folly he wanted to know what it was
[1:18:42] like for the crazy people he want to
[1:18:46] know is like to do foolish things so he
[1:18:48] started doing foolish things I perceived
[1:18:52] that this is also a vexation of spirit
[1:18:55] it's a torment right it's a long and
[1:18:58] it's a striving for in much wisdom is
[1:19:01] much grief and he that increaseth
[1:19:03] knowledge increases sorrow now let's
[1:19:10] look at this thought here just briefly
[1:19:11] if you got your Bibles go to James
[1:19:14] chapter 3 verse 13 if if we don't read
[1:19:21] this with the lens of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:24] we'll start misunderstanding what
[1:19:27] Solomon saying we have to look at this
[1:19:29] scripture through the lens of the Holy
[1:19:31] Spirit so as you're turning James 3:13
[1:19:35] I'm gonna read Ecclesiastes again for in
[1:19:39] much wisdom is much grief did everybody
[1:19:41] understand that Solomon says if you have
[1:19:45] much wisdom then you get much grief but
[1:19:50] that's not true in the New Testament and
[1:19:52] I'll say like this it wasn't true in the
[1:19:54] Old Testament either Solomon was talking
[1:19:57] about worldly wisdom or he was
[1:20:00] backslidden talking about the wisdom of
[1:20:02] God remember Church 22 years earlier he
[1:20:06] said that wisdom is life and wisdom is a
[1:20:09] tree of life amen to them that take
[1:20:13] ahold of her hey man hallelujah glory so
[1:20:17] the same man that said wisdom is life
[1:20:19] wisdom is the Tree of Life
[1:20:20] wisdom is theirs blessings and favor and
[1:20:23] wisdom the same man 23 years later says
[1:20:26] much wisdom is much grief
[1:20:29] instead of the word making him happy
[1:20:31] it brought grief to him now I'm sure
[1:20:33] we've all seen that people that they get
[1:20:36] excited about the message then for a few
[1:20:38] years later now it's just a grief to
[1:20:39] them and the church said Amen they're no
[1:20:44] longer excited about the message anymore
[1:20:46] the message is a burden or it's hard to
[1:20:49] live the word oh it's hard to live a
[1:20:50] godly life the world looks so attractive
[1:20:53] what
[1:20:53] them they've back slitted the Word of
[1:20:56] God has been come common to them they're
[1:20:59] no longer hungry and thirsting for the
[1:21:01] Word of God oh my Oh starting to get
[1:21:04] good here so Solomon says wisdom is
[1:21:06] grief but let's look at James 3:13 now
[1:21:09] Malachi you can put it up there who's
[1:21:12] the wise man endued with knowledge among
[1:21:14] you let him show out of a good
[1:21:15] conversation his works with meekness of
[1:21:17] wisdom to see if you're wise is gonna
[1:21:21] make you humble but if you have bitter
[1:21:24] envying and strife in your heart glory
[1:21:26] not and lie not against the truth this
[1:21:28] wisdom descendeth not from above but is
[1:21:31] earthly sensual devilish for we're
[1:21:35] envying and strife is there's confusion
[1:21:37] and every evil work but the wisdom that
[1:21:41] is from above is first pure then
[1:21:45] peaceable gentle and easy to be
[1:21:50] intreated full of mercy and good fruits
[1:21:52] without partiality without hypocrisy and
[1:21:57] the fruit of righteousness is sown in
[1:21:59] peace of them that make peace now maokai
[1:22:03] put back up verse 17 buddy now remember
[1:22:07] what what did Solomon say in much wisdom
[1:22:09] is grief what does the Bible say but the
[1:22:12] wisdom us from above is first pure than
[1:22:15] what peaceable gentle easy to be
[1:22:20] entreated full of mercy and good fruits
[1:22:22] so Solomon says much wisdom gives you
[1:22:26] grief but James says much wisdom gives
[1:22:30] you peace amen hallelujah so see either
[1:22:33] salman had a Backson the attitude
[1:22:36] towards the wisdom of God or Solomon's
[1:22:38] talking about worldly wisdom wisdom
[1:22:41] should not bring grief in the New
[1:22:43] Testament wisdom brings victory amen
[1:22:46] wisdom brings purity now what is pure
[1:22:51] mean it means sacred pure from carnality
[1:22:55] clean so it when you were living the
[1:22:58] wisdom of God you feel clean in your
[1:23:00] daily life you don't feel condemned of
[1:23:02] your sins you don't feel like oh I'm
[1:23:05] filthy and Jesus doesn't love me gee
[1:23:07] just thinks I'm dirty and filthy when
[1:23:09] you've got the wisdom of God and you're
[1:23:11] acting upon it you feel pure amen
[1:23:14] next peaceable means loving peace and
[1:23:18] being peaceful so wisdom the wisdom of
[1:23:22] God makes you full of peace it doesn't
[1:23:24] make you depressed it brings you the
[1:23:26] peace of God in your heart hallelujah in
[1:23:29] other words there's nothing between my
[1:23:31] Savior and I Amen all things are are
[1:23:34] made new everything feels new the peace
[1:23:36] of God rules my heart amen
[1:23:39] the peace of God is also gentle which
[1:23:42] means fair mild equitable so when the
[1:23:47] wisdom of God is in your heart you feel
[1:23:49] gentle toward everybody you don't feel
[1:23:52] angry towards people when people talk to
[1:23:54] you you give them a gentle reply like we
[1:23:56] said on on Sunday we must give a soft
[1:23:59] answer how many know that in your home
[1:24:01] and on the job and in the church you
[1:24:04] talk to people with kindness you don't
[1:24:06] talk to you don't ball them out with
[1:24:07] anger you don't tell them how much of a
[1:24:10] sinner they are you're gentle with them
[1:24:14] you don't tell them how evil they are
[1:24:16] you're really gentle and you still call
[1:24:18] them brother and sister the wisdom of
[1:24:22] God also makes you easy to be intreated
[1:24:24] which means you easily obey you're
[1:24:29] easily compliant amen so I can easily
[1:24:33] obey when I'm walking in wisdom oh the
[1:24:36] Word of God is easy for me to obey it's
[1:24:38] not hard for me to to stop looking at
[1:24:41] evil things on my phone or it's not hard
[1:24:44] for you to walk away from a dirty joke
[1:24:46] because you're easily compliant you're
[1:24:49] quickly obeying the Word of God now that
[1:24:51] could help everybody amen
[1:24:53] when you're walking wisdom you easily
[1:24:57] comply with the Word of God and of
[1:24:59] course full of mercy means you're full
[1:25:01] of kindness you have goodwill towards
[1:25:04] the miserable people the afflicted
[1:25:06] people so when you see people hurting
[1:25:08] and you've got the wisdom of God you're
[1:25:10] full of mercy to them amen my this is
[1:25:13] striking one two three four five six
[1:25:16] there are six attributes of wisdom no
[1:25:18] I've never seen that before
[1:25:19] lastly without part
[1:25:21] reality it means your undisguised so you
[1:25:26] are so sincere right but God told mother
[1:25:29] man you must be more sincere in other
[1:25:30] words you must be without partiality you
[1:25:34] must be pure before everyone you must be
[1:25:36] sincere with the young people just as
[1:25:38] you are with the older people with every
[1:25:40] person now does that help you by God's
[1:25:43] grace ecclesiastes he said much wisdom
[1:25:46] is grief but James says much wisdom is
[1:25:49] pure peaceable gentle compliant to the
[1:25:53] word full of mercy and full of good
[1:25:55] fruits without partiality without
[1:25:58] hypocrisy amen hallelujah
[1:26:01] so there's 45 minutes give me 15 more
[1:26:03] minutes there boy I'm fast
[1:26:06] so I hope that helps you when you read
[1:26:08] Ecclesiastes you've got to read it and
[1:26:11] understand Solomon said some of these
[1:26:13] things through a backslidden experience
[1:26:15] and you got to take everything he said
[1:26:18] back to the New Testament
[1:26:20] alright chapter 2 now this is where I
[1:26:23] went into the main points of my message
[1:26:25] here I hope this is helping you by God's
[1:26:30] grace you know here's the five things
[1:26:33] the five W's Solomon's five W's and I
[1:26:36] finally got to it 45 minutes in the
[1:26:38] sermon alright chapter 2 verse 1 I said
[1:26:41] in my heart go to now I will prove thee
[1:26:44] with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure and
[1:26:48] behold this is also vowed vanity in
[1:26:51] other words Solomon said I'm gonna try
[1:26:53] pleasure there's all these things out
[1:26:55] there I'm just gonna give myself to
[1:26:57] pleasure to having joy and feeling glad
[1:27:00] and pleasure and gaiety and Happiness
[1:27:03] I'm gonna give myself to all that and I
[1:27:07] said of laughter and verse 2 it's mad
[1:27:08] and a mirth what do with it so he said
[1:27:11] I'm just gonna do everything that's fun
[1:27:13] I'm gonna have the most fun I'm little
[1:27:14] the most parties and most people make me
[1:27:17] laugh I'm gonna do anything that feels
[1:27:18] good I'm gonna do it and at the end of
[1:27:21] it he said what good did it do me he was
[1:27:25] left empty
[1:27:26] let me tell our young people any sin
[1:27:30] after you do it aside is exciting as it
[1:27:33] may seem at the beginning you're gonna
[1:27:34] feel empty at the
[1:27:35] and that's for my older children
[1:27:38] whatever Satan is tempting you to look
[1:27:40] at or do or say it might seem it might
[1:27:44] it might seem exciting but at the end of
[1:27:46] it you'll feel empty and dirty because
[1:27:49] that's what Solomon said verse 3 now
[1:27:54] look at that I saw in my heart to give
[1:27:56] myself unto wine yet acquainting my
[1:27:59] heart with wisdom so let's stop right
[1:28:00] there so the first thing Solomon tried
[1:28:03] was wine I'm gonna drink a lot of
[1:28:05] alcohol but I'm not gonna get addicted
[1:28:08] to alcohol cuz that's what he says he
[1:28:11] says yet I'm a quiet acquainting my
[1:28:12] heart with wisdom so do you see how
[1:28:16] message people could do this to legs
[1:28:18] well I know the message but I'm gonna go
[1:28:20] to a party but I'm not gonna get too
[1:28:21] drunk right well I'm gonna go to a party
[1:28:25] I'll smoke a little bit of marijuana but
[1:28:27] I'm not gonna do crack or cocaine you
[1:28:30] see how people do this today they're
[1:28:32] like some and they've heard the word
[1:28:33] they've seen the word of God we've heard
[1:28:35] brother branham's visions about Jesus
[1:28:38] we've heard the mysteries of God but if
[1:28:40] we're not careful we'll say well I'll
[1:28:42] try it but I'm not going to get addicted
[1:28:45] to it see but the wisdom of God will
[1:28:49] lead you away from that and no lead you
[1:28:51] to the peace of God that passes all
[1:28:52] understanding amen
[1:28:55] hallelujah so see Solomon tried wine he
[1:28:59] said I'm gonna drink a lot of wine I'm
[1:29:00] gonna see if this makes me feel good
[1:29:01] he's gonna crack open some you know he's
[1:29:04] gonna crack open the bottles he's gonna
[1:29:05] try well let's see if this feels good so
[1:29:11] in other words he was gonna try out
[1:29:12] every addiction and there was five like
[1:29:14] I said there's five W's the first ones
[1:29:16] one he said I'm gonna try this out but
[1:29:18] I'm not going to get addicted
[1:29:21] let's finish verse three and Aleya hold
[1:29:24] on folly till I might see what was that
[1:29:26] good for the sons of men which they
[1:29:28] should do under the heaven all the days
[1:29:30] of their life okay so there's the first
[1:29:33] double use wine children adults alcohol
[1:29:37] will not satisfy you getting drunk will
[1:29:40] not satisfy oh by you it'll only take
[1:29:42] you deeper into depression alcohol does
[1:29:47] not satisfy
[1:29:49] had all the money in the world he could
[1:29:50] about any kind of alcohol he wanted and
[1:29:52] he said didn't do me any good and the
[1:29:55] Bible said who has whoa who's the people
[1:29:57] who have the really big sorrows those
[1:29:59] who get drunk those who drink the line
[1:30:01] right the most intoxicating wine you
[1:30:07] understand now can I lay this thought in
[1:30:11] here real quick
[1:30:12] this thought struck me today what I
[1:30:14] believe it was the Holy Spirit this is
[1:30:18] the mindset of a man who has no battles
[1:30:23] this is a mindset of the man who's not
[1:30:26] fighting a war brother Jose oh I have a
[1:30:30] good thought you see how Satan is trying
[1:30:34] to rock us to sleep where there's really
[1:30:36] no spiritual battles you see why riches
[1:30:39] are so awful you see why we should pray
[1:30:43] and say God don't make me rich but don't
[1:30:45] make me poor make me right in between
[1:30:47] because Solomon is rich he's got no Wars
[1:30:50] to fight and look what happens he gets
[1:30:52] totally back slid on God and remember
[1:30:56] his daddy the same thing happened to his
[1:30:59] daddy when he accepted his dad had Wars
[1:31:01] except when he sinned he did not go out
[1:31:04] to the war and I hope everybody lives
[1:31:07] for me tonight and I hope everybody
[1:31:08] listening present and I hope any money
[1:31:11] that listens on the archives will hear
[1:31:13] me now we must always know there's a
[1:31:15] battle to be fought and that battles
[1:31:18] done in prayer amen
[1:31:19] we've always got to have a battle
[1:31:21] because remember we said we said it last
[1:31:22] Wednesday the full armor of God once you
[1:31:25] have it on what do you do you pray
[1:31:27] always with all supplication a real
[1:31:31] Christian warrior is constantly praying
[1:31:34] all the time so Salman got to the spot
[1:31:35] where there was no battles so he found
[1:31:38] all this time to kind of I'll try one
[1:31:40] I'll try women I'll try all these things
[1:31:42] because there was no battle to fight
[1:31:44] church we must understand that when we
[1:31:46] sing these songs about millions now and
[1:31:49] sin and shame or dying God help me God
[1:31:52] help all of us to remember that everyday
[1:31:54] so we can keep praying and we can keep
[1:31:57] battling for souls amen
[1:31:59] hallelujah
[1:32:02] without a battle people will backslide
[1:32:06] they have to see the battle that's why
[1:32:11] you know when people first come in the
[1:32:13] message they're so hungry for Bible
[1:32:14] studies and for the word of God because
[1:32:16] they can see the battle but pretty soon
[1:32:18] they stop breathing they stop thinking
[1:32:19] like I'm holy enough I'm clean enough I
[1:32:23] don't really have to work on anything
[1:32:24] I've heard that before I've heard that
[1:32:26] before and what is it it's Satan
[1:32:28] deceiving them and they're getting drunk
[1:32:30] on religion they're thinking they're
[1:32:33] good enough we'll never be good enough
[1:32:34] we constantly need the blood of Jesus
[1:32:36] Christ to make us holy amen every day to
[1:32:39] die out and let Jesus blood wash us and
[1:32:42] renew us and help us to be soldiers
[1:32:44] fighting the battle and to never give up
[1:32:47] what we're supposed to be doing battling
[1:32:49] in prayer amen
[1:32:50] Oh hallelujah thank you Jesus well this
[1:32:56] is why people give up coming to church
[1:32:57] and they give up praying and they give
[1:32:59] up coming too early to church to pray
[1:33:01] they're just like Salman they're rich it
[1:33:03] increased with Goods and the days of
[1:33:05] late Asiya and they have no need of any
[1:33:07] more battles oh we've got a how many
[1:33:10] have a loved one they want to pray for
[1:33:11] how many are battling to pray for their
[1:33:13] friends or their co-workers we've got
[1:33:16] the battle and prayer in order to see
[1:33:18] people save we've got to fight we've got
[1:33:20] to be Christian warriors how many want
[1:33:22] to be a Christian warrior let's not be
[1:33:24] like Solomon and David who chose not to
[1:33:26] go to battle that's when sin happened
[1:33:29] when they stopped battling on their
[1:33:30] knees in prayer 9 verse 4 we're only
[1:33:37] going to read
[1:33:40] let's read for 5
[1:33:42] and six
[1:33:49] you
[1:34:00] the fruit
[1:34:13] you're right
[1:34:17] and now the second one works he found
[1:34:20] out that pools and orchards and gardens
[1:34:23] and vineyards and houses and temples all
[1:34:25] these things do not satisfy well if I
[1:34:29] just had a brand-new house brother just
[1:34:31] I'd be happy no you wouldn't
[1:34:33] right if I could just move this yeah
[1:34:36] like if we just had a new church you
[1:34:38] know which we wanted to get one event
[1:34:40] we'd like to but that won't make us
[1:34:42] happy we got to choose to be happy now
[1:34:45] it'll be a building for the future if we
[1:34:47] get one by God's grace you know the god
[1:34:49] Terry's but we we must understand wine
[1:34:52] works these things they do not satisfy
[1:34:55] only Jesus spirit satisfies amen only
[1:34:59] holiness will satisfy your soul
[1:35:01] hallelujah look at verse seven now
[1:35:03] here's the third W the third W is wealth
[1:35:07] so wine works don't satisfy we're gonna
[1:35:10] see wealth doesn't satisfy either verses
[1:35:13] seven eight nine I got me servants and
[1:35:16] maidens and had servants born in my
[1:35:17] house and I had great possessions of
[1:35:19] great and small cattle above all that
[1:35:22] were in Jerusalem before me and I
[1:35:25] gathered me also silver and gold and the
[1:35:27] peculiar treasure of Kings and of the
[1:35:29] provinces i gat me men singers and women
[1:35:32] singers and the delights of the sons of
[1:35:34] men as all as musical instruments and of
[1:35:36] that of all sorts

[1:35:47] about the treasures in your house

[1:35:54] preach on how Solomon said the treasures
[1:35:57] of oil are in your chambers in other
[1:35:59] words the presence of God in your house
[1:36:01] is treasures well 23 years later
[1:36:04] Solomon's like well I who cares about
[1:36:06] that treasure I want natural treasure do
[1:36:09] you see how you back slid it used to be
[1:36:12] so important to have the Holy Spirit his

[1:36:16] house with riches I've got to get a

[1:36:38] house it's the Holy Spirit and then 23
[1:36:40] years later he's like nah I need more
[1:36:43] treasures don't you know that's how
[1:36:46] Satan's gonna attempt each one of us we
[1:36:49] all start out with the zeal of God and
[1:36:51] Satan's gonna try to get in there and
[1:36:53] try to make our treasure something other
[1:36:55] than the Prince of God we must always
[1:36:57] make sure the Friends of God is our
[1:37:00] treasure
[1:37:00] how many can say amen to that Oh
[1:37:02] hallelujah and you see that every CD or
[1:37:08] mp3 could one he had all the singers and
[1:37:10] men's singers well if only had more
[1:37:12] music more money to buy more music now
[1:37:14] that wouldn't satisfy you he had all the
[1:37:17] singers he could possibly want I've only
[1:37:19] had more money on the Google store the
[1:37:21] iTunes store oh my that doesn't satisfy
[1:37:26] and he was the most powerful and great
[1:37:31] man there was a good verse 9 so I was
[1:37:34] great and increased more than all that
[1:37:36] were before me in Jerusalem also my
[1:37:40] wisdom remain with me so see he never
[1:37:42] got addicted to money he never worship
[1:37:44] money he never got addicted to wine he
[1:37:47] never he worshiped women he always tried
[1:37:51] to catch a bounce well let me try this
[1:37:53] and see if this works let me try that
[1:37:54] and every time he find out this was not
[1:37:57] satisfying this doesn't satisfy all
[1:38:02] right now let me
[1:38:07] right there now let me close to this
[1:38:10] because I'm already coming up to an hour
[1:38:12] yeah I got three more minutes I got my
[1:38:13] hour there thank you for your patience
[1:38:15] now let's go to proverbs 7:25
[1:38:21] I'm sorry not proverbs Ecclesiastes 7:25
[1:38:23] forgive me please yeah see 7:25 here's
[1:38:26] where we know he tried women because he
[1:38:30] said I have a thousand women he couldn't
[1:38:33] find one that was righteous and remember
[1:38:40] that was his fault that wasn't his
[1:38:42] memory can I say like this his mother
[1:38:45] taught him how to find a good proverbs
[1:38:47] 31 woman earlier in his life his mother
[1:38:50] taught him or it was either him or
[1:38:52] another King Lemuel right he already
[1:38:55] knew what a godly woman was but
[1:38:56] apparently he didn't look for him like
[1:38:58] he ought to of please asked he's 725 I
[1:39:04] applied my heart to know in the search
[1:39:06] and to seek out wisdom and the reason of
[1:39:08] things and to know the wickedness of
[1:39:09] folly even a foolishness and madness and
[1:39:12] I find more bitter than death the woman
[1:39:14] whose heart is snares and nets and her
[1:39:16] hands as bands who so pleases God shall
[1:39:18] escape from her but the sinner shall be
[1:39:21] taken by her behold this have I found
[1:39:24] saith the preacher counting one by one
[1:39:25] to find out the account which yet my
[1:39:28] soul seeketh but I find not one man
[1:39:30] among a thousand have I found but a
[1:39:32] woman among all those have I not found
[1:39:35] though this only have I found that God
[1:39:38] hath made man upright and they have
[1:39:40] sought out many inventions remember what
[1:39:43] did Solomon do he started taking women
[1:39:45] from Egypt and from all these heathen
[1:39:47] kings so of course he wasn't gonna find
[1:39:50] one out of a thousand but remember a
[1:39:53] hard woman is good to find because
[1:39:54] that's what proverbs 31 says who can
[1:39:57] find a virtuous woman a and hallelujah
[1:40:00] and if we've got virtuous woman in our
[1:40:02] church then God has blessed us with the
[1:40:04] cream of the crop out of there yeah but
[1:40:07] church let me I don't know if you knew
[1:40:09] this but in Proverbs the Bible said who
[1:40:11] can find a virtuous woman but did you
[1:40:13] know in Proverbs it says who can find a
[1:40:15] faithful man amen so a godly woman is
[1:40:20] just as rare
[1:40:21] as a godly man but if Solomon says it
[1:40:24] was harder for him to find a godly woman
[1:40:26] both are hard to find so if we've got
[1:40:28] godly men if we've got faithful men and
[1:40:31] virtuous women in our church then we've
[1:40:33] got the cream of the Holy Ghost crop
[1:40:35] amen hallelujah that's what we're
[1:40:37] thankful for tonight by the grace of God
[1:40:40] because member the Bible said Solomon
[1:40:44] had 700 wives princesses 300 concubines
[1:40:47] and his wives turned away his heart so
[1:40:51] he must have chose a thousand or a close
[1:40:53] to a thousand bad wives the Bible said
[1:40:58] that when it came to pass Tamas old his
[1:40:59] wives turned away his heart after other
[1:41:03] gods all right now we already know
[1:41:07] that's the fourth W wine works wealth
[1:41:10] women and the fifth one was worldly
[1:41:14] wisdom let's go back to chapter 1 in
[1:41:17] cleese Assis 116 now I'm sorry to go to
[1:41:25] 17 and I gave my heart to know wisdom
[1:41:27] and to know madness and folly I perceive
[1:41:30] that this is also vexation of spirit for
[1:41:32] much wisdom as much grief and he that
[1:41:35] increased the knowledge increases sorrow
[1:41:37] so the last of the W's that he tries is
[1:41:40] worldly wisdom go to chapter 12 verse 12
[1:41:52] proverbs 12
[1:41:54] well I'm sorry Cleese se 1212 and
[1:41:56] further by these my son be admonished of
[1:41:58] making many books there's no end and
[1:42:01] much study is a weariness of the flesh
[1:42:04] let's stand to our feet by God's grace
[1:42:11] so can everybody see the five W's he
[1:42:14] tried he said I'll try wisdom I'm sorry
[1:42:16] I'll try a wine I'll drink a lot of
[1:42:18] alcohol I'll do works I'll try to
[1:42:21] satisfy myself building things
[1:42:23] I'll try wealth I'll try to get as rich
[1:42:25] as I possibly can that'll make me happy
[1:42:27] I'll try women I'll just take all the
[1:42:29] princesses and concubines I can and I'll
[1:42:32] try wisdom I'll try to be the smartest
[1:42:34] one I'll try to read all the time I'll
[1:42:35] try to study all the time and when he
[1:42:38] find out none of it satisfies so what is
[1:42:42] the W that satisfies the word the living
[1:42:48] word because the Bible said in Hebrews
[1:42:52] 4:12
[1:42:53] let me just read it for you you know it
[1:42:57] because the word quick means living
[1:43:00] Hebrews 4:12 Solomon tried five W's he
[1:43:03] just needed one more he had at the
[1:43:06] beginning of his life but he fell away
[1:43:08] from it that first love of the word oh I
[1:43:12] love it
[1:43:13] I knew that was inspired as soon as I
[1:43:16] read that the five W's but I knew there
[1:43:18] was one more the word or we'd say wisdom
[1:43:20] brother Jose said it earlier that's the
[1:43:22] baptism Holy Ghost is really wisdom of
[1:43:24] God that's right Hebrews 4:12 for the
[1:43:28] word of God is quick that means alive
[1:43:29] the word is alive powerful sharper than
[1:43:33] a two-edged sword piercing even to the
[1:43:34] dividing asunder of soul and spirit and
[1:43:36] the joints and marrow and the discerner
[1:43:38] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:43:40] Amen let's give all around applause amen
[1:43:42] yeah so church if Satan's trying to
[1:43:47] tempt you to go after wine turn him down
[1:43:49] works turn him down wealth
[1:43:51] turn him down women are men
[1:43:54] relationships turn them down if he's
[1:43:56] trying to get you just to be smart and
[1:43:57] have worldly wisdom turn him down
[1:43:59] there's one thing that brings living
[1:44:01] life and that's the Living Word of God
[1:44:03] and Avett Solomon could never get tired
[1:44:08] and of the Living Word you and I can
[1:44:10] never get tired when we really receive
[1:44:12] the anointed Word of God amen
[1:44:15] how do they just bow our heads here as
[1:44:17] we close tonight let's pray for our
[1:44:21] church let's pray for the word of God to
[1:44:26] take more effect in our lives how many
[1:44:29] want the Word of God to take more effect
[1:44:30] in their lives that's what I want I want
[1:44:32] this Living Word here to be my
[1:44:36] fulfillment I want to be so fulfilled
[1:44:38] with the word the anointing of God is

[1:44:42] God as we read there in James it makes
[1:44:45] you peaceable it makes you gentle it
[1:44:47] makes you impartial it makes you fair it
