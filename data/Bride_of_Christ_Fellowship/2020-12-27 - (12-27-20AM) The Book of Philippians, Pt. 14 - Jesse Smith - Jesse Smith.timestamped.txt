[39:41] little bit with that
[39:49] um i'd like to just do a few quick
[39:52] updates here
[39:53] by god's grace uh just want to let
[39:55] everybody know i adjusted the calendar a
[39:57] little bit for january i don't know if
[39:59] you saw that i had brother brian hawkins
[40:00] coming out but i asked him to come back
[40:02] a little later
[40:03] with wendy leaving it impacts our church
[40:05] finances a little bit so
[40:07] i just want to take a few months and
[40:08] i'll just preach for the next few months
[40:09] by god's grace i'm going to reschedule
[40:11] brother brian
[40:12] probably from march or something like
[40:13] that plus every time we try to have a
[40:15] minister in
[40:16] january february with all the snow you
[40:17] know it's just it's like there's always
[40:19] a question like and then it seems always
[40:20] snow at that time you know
[40:23] anyways just so you know i i did take
[40:25] the guest ministers off the calendar
[40:26] we'll take a few months and save up a
[40:28] little bit on finances and
[40:29] uh we got to get adjusted to having less
[40:31] finance right just like the family right
[40:33] sometimes
[40:34] can all the dads in it and mom say hey
[40:36] man you know sometimes uh finances
[40:38] aren't as easy as we like them to be and
[40:40] so i see the same thing in the church
[40:42] but we're so grateful to be here and
[40:43] i got to see the landlord you know this
[40:45] week and she was she's like we
[40:46] appreciate your loyalty and
[40:48] she said we just love you guys and i
[40:50] said well thank you
[40:52] we love her too you know uh so we're
[40:54] just grateful
[40:55] so just you know i did adjust the
[40:57] schedule there
[40:58] and also i wanted to show this too i did
[41:00] have uh i do have a new website i'm
[41:03] building here
[41:03] and it's not all it's my personal
[41:05] website okay so
[41:07] uh my the point of it is to defend
[41:08] jesus's message and his messenger
[41:11] you know this year more than ever you
[41:13] know i've been i've been i've been
[41:14] having a battle on both sides
[41:16] the side that wants to get rid of
[41:18] brother branham and the sides that wants
[41:20] to
[41:20] exalt brother branham you know i don't
[41:24] know if you know but i debated the man
[41:25] from believe the sign i debated him back
[41:27] in september
[41:28] uh and then i've been emailing uh and
[41:30] writing joseph branham and billy paul
[41:32] all year off and on all year and uh just
[41:34] feeling like the lord to do that
[41:36] right uh so i've just noticed this year
[41:38] in 2020 you know
[41:39] all the things about 2020 and the right
[41:42] vision you know
[41:43] i just felt like it was just such an
[41:45] important thing to do and i i'm building
[41:47] this website now
[41:48] um to defend you know just to put all
[41:50] that in one place just like they have
[41:52] their believe the sign just like they
[41:53] got
[41:54] and i'm sure other people have like a
[41:55] defend brother branham message
[41:57] website they might i i haven't been
[41:59] there if they have but i just want to
[42:00] build my own and i want to put it on
[42:02] there
[42:03] so just so you know i started doing that
[42:06] uh you know with the scriptures i got a
[42:07] little intro video on there i'm just
[42:08] building it
[42:10] slowly i got links to the books on there
[42:14] so got some testimonies on there so i
[42:15] just want to let you know i'm i'm
[42:16] building that
[42:17] and i want to be a place where i can put
[42:19] all of our videos and not have to worry
[42:21] about
[42:21] youtube you know shadow banning any of
[42:23] my videos or i don't know if they do
[42:25] but we know they censure things that are
[42:27] against their narrative right so
[42:29] i just want to have a place where
[42:30] everything can go where there's nothing
[42:32] hindering it as far as i know
[42:35] um so that's a little update there by
[42:37] god's grace
[42:40] and also you know this week i put out
[42:41] the uh or last week i put out the new
[42:44] video i did on is joseph branham of
[42:46] profit that's been pretty popular but
[42:48] i've got a lot of feedback on that one
[42:49] good and bad
[42:51] uh but i shared it with joseph and billy
[42:54] paul but they never emailed me back so i
[42:55] said okay well uh
[42:57] i uh shared it then uh live and um i'll
[43:00] share a few things at the end i've
[43:02] gotten
[43:02] some pretty intense feedback good and
[43:04] bad on that
[43:06] but just just just uh i just feel led of
[43:10] the holy spirit to do that i haven't
[43:12] done that because
[43:12] it's been easy it has not been easy
[43:15] i've had to pray and fast and this some
[43:17] of these videos have taken me months to
[43:19] do
[43:19] because i want to say exactly the truth
[43:21] and i want to say exactly i want to say
[43:22] it with the love of jesus christ
[43:24] and the thing is church you know both of
[43:26] these sides they're influencing millions
[43:28] of people
[43:28] but there's god i want to i want to be a
[43:30] voice in the midst of it
[43:31] that it's not that extreme it's not that
[43:33] extreme it's right down the middle of
[43:34] the road
[43:35] and so i just i fee that's what i feel
[43:37] led to do
[43:39] and brother man was the same way right
[43:40] he sent tapes out he sent his tapes out
[43:43] he was careful about you know pastors
[43:45] and who it was influencing but they went
[43:47] out anyway
[43:48] brother neville had a radio program
[43:51] every saturday he was on the radio
[43:53] preaching and teaching
[43:54] going out to whosoever will right
[43:57] right and brother adam said i love that
[43:59] he said he and his family listened to it
[44:00] every saturday morning
[44:03] it was just going out right it was going
[44:04] out it wasn't well just you know only
[44:06] pastors can listen to that so
[44:08] we want to just use the wisdom of the
[44:09] holy spirit and we want to get the word
[44:11] of god out and it's a it's been
[44:13] witness to me over and over again people
[44:15] need it and i know this
[44:17] god will direct his word to all the
[44:19] hungry hearted believers
[44:21] that i know because the elect will not
[44:24] be deceived
[44:25] and god ordains everything the footsteps
[44:27] of the righteous are order the lord
[44:30] and i want to be a voice for the truth
[44:32] of god's word
[44:33] amen so let's just look at this thought
[44:35] here uh and lord willing this evening
[44:37] i'll be preaching on music again
[44:40] uh i know it's been a big stir in in
[44:43] around
[44:43] ohio in the last few years i'm not sure
[44:46] if you're familiar with that but
[44:47] i'm just uh yeah i just i've heard about
[44:49] i've i haven't talked to anybody about
[44:50] it
[44:50] because i'm just kind of my own world
[44:52] over here you know trying to support my
[44:53] family
[44:54] run the church preach the gospel um
[44:57] and i haven't even listened to the
[44:58] sermons i haven't listened anything but
[45:00] i've just been feeling led to preach on
[45:02] that
[45:02] but just so you know with amen amen's
[45:04] been doing a great job as our song
[45:05] leader last few years i think the last
[45:06] one two three years just
[45:08] every every sunday faithfully but we had
[45:10] two adults come up to me brother last
[45:12] sunday
[45:13] they were visitors and they said brother
[45:14] jesse i just want to tell you you have
[45:16] such a freedom of the holy spirit in
[45:17] your worship
[45:19] visitors brother they said they said we
[45:21] feel so free and brother when they're
[45:23] telling me that they got these big huge
[45:24] smiles on their faces
[45:26] they're like brother the music is so
[45:28] great here and thank you for
[45:30] the freedom and liberty that we feel i
[45:31] said well thank the lord
[45:33] and thank god for both amen and malachi
[45:36] and lydia
[45:37] i don't want to leave anybody out you
[45:38] know and everybody's singing right
[45:39] everybody clapping
[45:40] i just want to encourage you people can
[45:42] feel the difference they can feel when
[45:44] people are bound but they can feel when
[45:45] people are free too
[45:47] i always feel free praise god so i thank
[45:49] the lord for that
[45:52] church we are to live free from anxiety
[45:55] it's done through prayer and
[45:57] thanksgiving anybody had any anxiety
[45:59] over christmas hopefully not
[46:00] uh but if you did you know this is the
[46:02] way to get rid of it come to the house
[46:04] of god and pray
[46:05] amen prayer the paul says prayer is the
[46:08] key
[46:09] to being relieved from all of our
[46:11] stresses
[46:12] and anxieties and it's not just any
[46:15] prayer
[46:15] it's prayer with thanksgiving so we have
[46:18] to choose to be thankful
[46:20] and remember the man writing this is
[46:22] locked in prison at the current time
[46:25] and he's not a hypocrite he's not
[46:26] writing something that he doesn't know
[46:28] about
[46:29] right we ended the last part 13 with
[46:31] that if
[46:33] they understood here's a man in prison
[46:35] and he can only write about
[46:37] what he's experiencing himself praise
[46:39] god and so in other words he knew how to
[46:41] worship
[46:42] he knew how to give thanks he knew how
[46:44] to give praise
[46:45] in the midst of difficult times amen and
[46:48] so he says don't be anxious for anything
[46:51] but in every aspect of our lives we must
[46:54] give thanks
[46:55] with thanksgiving to god and make known
[46:58] your requests
[47:00] to god tell god all about it right when
[47:02] you pray
[47:03] pour out your heart before the lord you
[47:06] know don't say anything foolish you know
[47:07] like
[47:07] sometimes we do say lord forgive me
[47:09] he'll forgive you he forgave job's wife
[47:12] right she she said curse god and i said
[47:14] you talk like a foolish woman
[47:16] well later she had all those kids she
[47:17] had more kids later on
[47:19] and we're not told job got a second wife
[47:21] or anything so god is merciful how many
[47:23] times
[47:24] did david complain right in the psalms
[47:27] where are you lord don't you hear my cry
[47:29] you know job said the same thing i
[47:30] cursed the day i was born you know
[47:32] believers we're human sometimes we get
[47:34] in the flesh
[47:36] right but god gives us grace and we're
[47:38] to pour out our hearts to the lord
[47:40] and he'll correct us when we're wrong
[47:42] but i'll say like this will also correct
[47:43] us
[47:43] to think the right thing next time
[47:48] and so we must be uh be understanding
[47:51] and aware that
[47:52] god wants to hear our request god wants
[47:54] to hear our burdens right
[47:55] uh but we've got to do it with uh
[47:57] thankfulness we gotta part our hearts
[47:59] and yet be thankful to know that god has
[48:01] blessed us
[48:02] he's helped us and he's gonna help us in
[48:05] the future
[48:06] uh and we must have a grateful heart now
[48:08] the bible says
[48:09] i'm sorry the lexicon says the word
[48:11] careful means anxious or
[48:13] troubled so when we feel troubled when
[48:16] we feel anxious or stressed
[48:18] prayer with thanksgiving is going to
[48:19] relieve that
[48:22] uh thankful prayers uh
[48:25] and requested god move on your behalf
[48:29] brings you peace even though you're
[48:31] content if he doesn't
[48:33] praise god because church we have enough
[48:36] wisdom
[48:37] we have enough understanding to know god
[48:39] will do what's best for us
[48:42] right god doesn't need our plan
[48:46] god doesn't need our thinking to figure
[48:48] something out
[48:51] right he doesn't need so as long as we
[48:54] can express
[48:54] lord this is what i like to happen as
[48:57] long as we can
[48:57] express that then we should be happy in
[49:00] that
[49:01] and not have to tell god what to do how
[49:03] to do it
[49:04] when to do it but just trust that he'll
[49:06] do what's best for me
[49:10] see so it's just about in other words
[49:12] it's about letting off the pressure
[49:14] there it is right there it's about
[49:16] letting up the pressure all these
[49:17] requests
[49:18] let off the pressure make them known to
[49:20] god and then the peace of god will
[49:22] overcome you
[49:26] so it's through thankful prayer so it's
[49:28] the right kind of prayer
[49:30] right there might be parts of our prayer
[49:31] that are weeping and desperate right
[49:34] or maybe upset or discouraged but
[49:36] hopefully by the end of the prayer
[49:39] hopefully by the end you can give thanks
[49:40] and say lord thank you for this little
[49:42] time i had to prayer thank you for this
[49:43] opportunity to i could get on my knees
[49:45] or
[49:46] thank you for this opportunity i could
[49:47] express myself to you lord god
[49:50] we should end the prayer with
[49:51] thanksgiving
[49:53] and the bible says the peace of god will
[49:56] overcome
[49:57] all our anxiety and trouble so what's
[50:01] greater is stress greater
[50:02] or is god's peace greater praise god
[50:06] right which one's greater is is the
[50:08] pressures in your life
[50:10] harder or is the peace of god stronger
[50:13] than that
[50:13] amen the peace of god is able church
[50:17] to overcome all anxiety all stress
[50:20] all difficulties all the problems the
[50:22] peace of god is able to keep you
[50:25] and oh and help you overcome all that
[50:28] it'll be
[50:28] a victory in your life the peace of god
[50:30] is so much greater
[50:32] so much stronger praise god and it's
[50:34] just waiting there for you if you'll
[50:36] express your heart to god and then
[50:38] receive his love and peace
[50:40] amen hallelujah
[50:46] now here's what i want to just get back
[50:48] to a thought i preached
[50:49] last year and i'm going to reference the
[50:51] sermon a little bit
[50:53] how many know the bible said it's good
[50:54] to stir up your minds by remembrance
[50:57] new things throw up your minds like last
[50:59] week we heard a new sermon about the
[51:00] five virgins wasn't that awesome
[51:02] uh zellofed i forget exactly how to say
[51:04] that i was thanking the lord for that
[51:06] this week i was like
[51:06] what a god gave cam a great revelation
[51:09] on the old testament
[51:10] the the five daughters of zelo fadad
[51:12] that's it's a perfect type to the five
[51:14] virgins uh in jesus parable oh my i've
[51:16] never heard that before so i would shout
[51:18] and rejoice
[51:20] and you know church i shouted too much
[51:22] and i told myself i'm going to take it
[51:23] easy on my throat today because
[51:25] i just shot and here i am going loud
[51:27] again so i just forget about it once i
[51:29] get with god's people you know
[51:31] worshiping and praising boy anyhow
[51:35] so uh you know we rejoice
[51:38] in the new revelations but the bible
[51:40] actually says peter says it
[51:42] god will stir you up by helping you
[51:45] remember
[51:46] something i love new things
[51:49] and jesus said i'm going to his minister
[51:50] is going to bring out treasures new and
[51:52] old
[51:53] right so god gave us a new one last week
[51:57] but i'm going to bring some old ones
[51:58] today hopefully there'll be some new
[52:00] ones in here too
[52:02] maybe it's new for somebody but uh so
[52:05] god wants to stir and that means
[52:06] to make active right to stir it back up
[52:08] to move everything around
[52:09] your life is gonna be become moved
[52:12] around you're gonna feel like you're
[52:13] walking the things of god
[52:14] when god brings a certain memory to mind
[52:18] god loves to do that jesus said the holy
[52:20] ghost will bring all things to your
[52:22] remembrance
[52:23] amen that's right
[52:26] so uh the bible says peace will
[52:29] keep your heart now what does keep mean
[52:32] like keep in your pocket
[52:34] well it's kinda it means to guard
[52:37] and to keep with a garrison which is a
[52:39] military outpost
[52:41] so the peace of god is a military
[52:44] outpost protecting you from being
[52:47] invaded
[52:49] hallelujah sounds like we're in a war or
[52:51] something church
[52:53] sounds like somebody's trying to attack
[52:54] you or something that is
[52:57] you must have the full armor of god on
[52:59] amen
[53:00] you are in a constant battle praise god
[53:03] but what's going to what's going to keep
[53:04] you the peace of god
[53:06] is going to guard your emotions your
[53:08] heart
[53:10] your mind your thinking right it's going
[53:13] to keep you from being besieged
[53:15] and overtaken and lose your testimony
[53:20] or the fruits of the spirit or the joy
[53:22] of your salvation
[53:24] right like jesus in matthew 12 he said
[53:26] you're like a house and you
[53:27] you got to keep out all the devils right
[53:29] if you don't keep the devils out they're
[53:30] going to spoil your house
[53:33] so what is going to keep you from being
[53:35] invaded or
[53:36] overtaken and besieged and overwhelmed
[53:39] the peace of god is gonna guard you
[53:46] like a garrison peace is gonna be like
[53:49] a garrison for you praise god
[53:54] now this reminded me remember this
[53:56] scripture church from proverbs 4
[53:59] my son attend to my words
[54:02] is malcolm listen where's my son oh you
[54:05] just stepped out
[54:07] i was going to use that as a good
[54:08] example here let's just say malcolm look
[54:11] at me where's zion zion look at me buddy
[54:13] he's only four months though he can't
[54:15] look at me
[54:17] he said attend to my words so incline
[54:20] thine ear unto my saying so really give
[54:22] me your attention
[54:24] children really give your parents your
[54:25] attention
[54:27] let them not depart from thine eyes keep
[54:30] them in the midst of thine heart
[54:32] don't put something else at the center
[54:34] of your heart keep the words of your
[54:36] parents
[54:37] at the centers of your heart and how
[54:40] about you spiritual children too
[54:42] because i ain't just preaching to the
[54:43] kids now i'm preaching all of us
[54:45] children of god right here
[54:46] like me keep god's word at the center
[54:50] of your heart don't give something else
[54:54] first place
[54:55] keep god's word at the center he says
[54:59] for
[54:59] they are life unto those that find them
[55:02] so you got to find them you got to go
[55:03] searching
[55:05] right and health to all their flesh
[55:09] the word of god right
[55:12] keep thy heart with all diligence
[55:15] for out of it are the issues of life
[55:19] praise god how many know
[55:21] that if they if they keep their heart in
[55:23] the right condition they have better
[55:25] health
[55:27] praise god if you say positive
[55:31] about the word i'm not i'm just not
[55:32] talking about positive thinking
[55:34] like today's gonna be a good day today's
[55:35] gonna be good no today's a good day
[55:37] because the holy ghost is with me praise
[55:38] god
[55:39] anybody say this gonna be a better day
[55:40] it's gonna be a better day it's gonna be
[55:41] better anybody can say that
[55:43] but when we speak the positive word with
[55:46] faith
[55:46] in obedience to the word then our bodies
[55:49] benefit
[55:50] our families benefit we benefit
[55:53] everybody benefits amen
[55:55] because out of the word issues life amen
[56:02] so the writer solomon says
[56:05] keep your heart and minds the peace of
[56:08] god keeps it or
[56:09] or guards it now notice we're told
[56:12] solomon says you guard it
[56:13] meaning you have a choice to offer
[56:15] things thankful prayers are not
[56:18] so it's your choice uh how much
[56:20] protection do you want
[56:23] so this is what the question comes down
[56:24] to with prayer
[56:26] how much protection do you how long
[56:27] should i pray well as much protection as
[56:29] you need
[56:31] right i mean it's a guard your prayers
[56:35] your thankful prayers right
[56:37] being thankful and speaking god's word
[56:39] and you know being positive and praying
[56:43] that that that's so important and it
[56:45] will determine how much protection you
[56:47] have amen
[56:49] in other words you'll be able to
[56:51] overcome the enemy longer
[56:54] the more you pray remember you can pray
[56:57] without ceasing moms and dads that are
[56:58] busy
[57:00] so i got up at five to study this
[57:02] morning at 6 50 one of my little one
[57:04] comes in and i went
[57:05] you know usually i want three or four
[57:06] hours of quietness to study you know
[57:09] and then at 7 20 another one rolls in
[57:11] and pretty soon you know
[57:12] no more study i'll get up early and i
[57:17] yeah you know how it is with the kids
[57:18] you know you love your children but
[57:20] you know how it is how much how much
[57:24] protection do we need
[57:25] we need a lot by god's grace so we can
[57:28] pray
[57:28] you know it's up to us you keep it you
[57:32] and i can keep
[57:33] our hearts and minds but we got to be
[57:35] diligent about it
[57:37] we got to make sure we're praying
[57:38] throughout the day we've got to make
[57:40] sure we pray before we make that
[57:42] video or pray before we post that or or
[57:45] pray before we call that person or pray
[57:47] before we text that person we've got to
[57:50] keep our hearts and minds
[57:51] clear by god's grace and notice it's
[57:55] going to take diligence remember peter
[57:56] said that
[57:57] he said the stature of a perfect man he
[57:58] said give all diligence
[58:00] to make your calling an election sure
[58:04] so see it takes the human effort
[58:07] right and how much effort's required
[58:09] jesus said
[58:10] all of it how much effort do i need to
[58:13] give bro jesse
[58:14] all of it he said love the lord your god
[58:17] with some of your heart
[58:18] some of your strength and some of your
[58:20] soul some of your mind that's a mystique
[58:22] in the scripture
[58:24] he said give god all your strength amen
[58:28] give god all your heart praise god give
[58:30] god all your love
[58:32] it's going to take all your human
[58:34] ability praise god
[58:36] but the amount of the amount of effort
[58:39] we put into it determines
[58:40] how far the devil's kept off
[58:44] right now except in situations where
[58:46] we're tested like job
[58:48] and i listen to a servant about job this
[58:49] week it was a good message from a
[58:51] brother down in north carolina boy was
[58:52] it a great message my
[58:53] if you want it i'll share with you so
[58:54] let me know but i'm going to forget
[58:56] about it now
[58:57] but anyways the point was god looked at
[58:59] god looked at job and knew what satan
[59:01] was doing he's just walking around the
[59:02] earth you know
[59:03] and he said have you considered my
[59:04] servant job
[59:07] he's such a man of integrity praise god
[59:09] he's such a man of
[59:11] honesty and such a godly example have
[59:13] you considered him
[59:14] what a man he is hallelujah amen
[59:19] god likes to see his children overcome
[59:21] the test amen amen
[59:24] so in most cases your amount of effort
[59:27] in your prayer life whether it's in the
[59:29] morning
[59:29] throughout the day while you're washing
[59:31] dishes while you're mopping the floor
[59:32] whatever you're doing your devotion to
[59:34] prayer is going to keep the enemy off
[59:37] longer
[59:39] and so we've got to be devoted to that
[59:43] i've seen it have you seen it i've seen
[59:46] it i've had beautiful times of study
[59:48] and then i'll go into work and it's just
[59:49] a madhouse it seems like the kids it
[59:51] must have been a full moon they say
[59:52] brother bang
[59:54] right sometimes they say in a full moon
[59:55] people act crazy
[59:57] and i'll just have a crazy day at work
[59:58] but some days i'll be able to handle it
[1:00:00] okay
[1:00:01] other days if i didn't pray or if my
[1:00:03] mind's in the wrong spot or if i let
[1:00:04] something get to me
[1:00:06] i don't handle it as well and i
[1:00:07] whispered under my tongue like lord have
[1:00:09] mercy
[1:00:09] how can i help me to get through this
[1:00:11] you what's that oh yeah i gotta
[1:00:13] i gotta keep myself from complaining
[1:00:15] praise god
[1:00:18] but the bible shows us though here
[1:00:21] clearly the peace of god is gonna keep
[1:00:24] us
[1:00:25] and we've got to keep our the peace of
[1:00:27] god with all diligence
[1:00:31] so we've got to be more diligent in
[1:00:33] prayer
[1:00:35] and i'm talking to everybody me too
[1:00:40] because who can answer uh do the floods
[1:00:43] come in
[1:00:44] easier each time or do the floods come
[1:00:46] in harder each time
[1:00:48] they come in harder right so in other
[1:00:51] words it's not going to get easier to be
[1:00:53] a christian
[1:00:53] it's going to get harder because when
[1:00:55] the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:00:57] god has to raise the standard against it
[1:00:58] praise god amen
[1:01:00] so our battles are not going to get
[1:01:01] easier they're going to become more
[1:01:03] challenging
[1:01:04] and so we've got to be more devoted to
[1:01:06] prayer in 2021 can you imagine that
[1:01:08] we've got to be more devoted to prayer
[1:01:09] in 2021 than 2020.
[1:01:12] with all the riots the political turmoil
[1:01:14] the death the virus
[1:01:16] all these things the nowhere's the jobs
[1:01:17] and all these things all the financial
[1:01:19] stress
[1:01:19] all these things we've got to be more
[1:01:21] devoted we got to ask god to help us
[1:01:23] to be more diligent this year i mean the
[1:01:26] next year
[1:01:27] right that's why i'm already into 2021
[1:01:28] already in my mind
[1:01:33] he says you keep it you see because you
[1:01:36] have a part in it
[1:01:37] right god's not going to force anybody
[1:01:39] to be a believer we have a part in it
[1:01:41] we've got to be more diligent
[1:01:43] to set up the garrisons in our mind
[1:01:49] what is the keep in the hebrew to guard
[1:01:51] regard
[1:01:53] so you guard it you guard your heart and
[1:01:55] emotions with all
[1:01:56] diligent behavior
[1:02:00] in other words be more on guard to make
[1:02:03] sure you say the right thing
[1:02:04] do the right thing and you keep all the
[1:02:06] pressures off you
[1:02:08] amen you'll be more on guard i need to
[1:02:11] be more on guard
[1:02:16] so i just put at the top this means pray
[1:02:18] diligently with thankfulness
[1:02:20] so be thankful all the time in our
[1:02:23] prayers amen
[1:02:24] then the peace from prayer keeps or
[1:02:26] guards
[1:02:27] your hearts and minds that's why the
[1:02:30] bible said
[1:02:31] in everything give thanks for this is
[1:02:33] the will of god in christ jesus
[1:02:35] see in everything because prayers with
[1:02:37] thanksgiving produce this protection
[1:02:40] right prayers with thanksgiving produce
[1:02:43] a garrison
[1:02:45] they produce a shield amen they produce
[1:02:48] a
[1:02:48] protection they produce power amen they
[1:02:51] produce a safety guard amen
[1:02:53] they produce protection for you and i
[1:02:55] when we are constantly thankful
[1:02:57] for what we have and what god has done
[1:02:59] when we're constantly thankful we are
[1:03:00] protected and we're
[1:03:02] safe
[1:03:05] glory now here's the quote i brought
[1:03:08] back him
[1:03:09] we speak of him this morning father we
[1:03:11] pray that you'll bless our hearts let
[1:03:12] his spirit move among us and bless us
[1:03:15] enrich our experience i don't want to
[1:03:17] get
[1:03:18] uh i don't want to experience as a
[1:03:20] christian as a dull experience
[1:03:22] i want to be more rich i don't want to
[1:03:25] be more pretend i want to be a reality
[1:03:28] praise god i want to be enriched
[1:03:31] he says and heal the sickness in our
[1:03:33] midst and give us
[1:03:34] overcoming grace and god as i go
[1:03:38] out yonder in the field to face the foe
[1:03:41] may i realize
[1:03:42] that i'm garrisoned every hour
[1:03:45] by prayer oh how i depend
[1:03:49] on my own wisdom
[1:03:55] oh how i depend on my tapes
[1:03:58] although we thank god for tapes right oh
[1:04:01] how i depend on brother neville
[1:04:04] his pastor no i depend on the garrison
[1:04:08] of prayer the enemy approaching but i
[1:04:10] know that the garrison
[1:04:12] holds because mothers fathers and boys
[1:04:14] and girls
[1:04:15] christians born again with the
[1:04:17] experience heaven-bound people is
[1:04:19] on their knees praying oh god give
[1:04:21] deliverance
[1:04:23] amen in other words i'm depending on the
[1:04:25] prayers of the saints
[1:04:28] praise god i'm depending on people
[1:04:31] uh seeking your favor i'm depending on
[1:04:35] people seeking first
[1:04:36] the kingdom of god
[1:04:40] and father we pray yo let us get out
[1:04:43] into the enemy's lines out yonder look
[1:04:45] at this
[1:04:45] he talked about battle he said i
[1:04:48] i need garrisons and then i pray that
[1:04:51] we'll go out and possess the gates of
[1:04:53] our enemies amen
[1:04:54] amen praise god
[1:05:00] he says and conquer every precious soul
[1:05:02] that's waiting
[1:05:03] praise god that's what i feel like i
[1:05:05] feel like there's souls waiting out
[1:05:06] there that i need to go rescue amen
[1:05:09] and god uses youtube and you know god
[1:05:11] uses a live stream right we've seen that
[1:05:13] we had a brother get baptized a few
[1:05:15] months ago just saw one of our videos
[1:05:16] got baptized amen i haven't heard from
[1:05:19] him lately but
[1:05:20] hopefully you'll find a good church
[1:05:23] uh he said he's busy working sundays
[1:05:24] he's down in newark ohio
[1:05:27] but you know god like we said if
[1:05:29] somebody's hungry god's gonna send him
[1:05:31] the word
[1:05:33] he said bring the line of darkness in
[1:05:34] the light for we ask you in jesus name
[1:05:37] amen so as a prophet
[1:05:40] he was depending on the garrisons of
[1:05:43] people's prayers what's a garrison it's
[1:05:45] a military
[1:05:46] outpost where you watch to make sure the
[1:05:48] enemy's not trying to do a sneak attack
[1:05:50] on you
[1:05:51] right it's one of those
[1:05:54] outposts let me see did i get that on
[1:05:56] here i tried to get it on there let's
[1:05:57] see if it updated
[1:05:59] oh it did okay now we'll get to this in
[1:06:01] just a minute
[1:06:04] i tell you that technology is pretty
[1:06:05] sharp there i saved it on my ipad and
[1:06:07] updated on my iphone without me knowing
[1:06:08] it
[1:06:10] now this is of course israel there's
[1:06:12] jerusalem and everything
[1:06:13] now david eventually builds because he's
[1:06:15] such a mighty conqueror
[1:06:17] as a type of christ he eventually builds
[1:06:20] his uh
[1:06:23] ghost here the tsarnaev peninsula
[1:06:25] there's egypt you know he
[1:06:27] is the territory and the the amazing
[1:06:30] part
[1:06:30] is he expands it all the way up to the
[1:06:32] euphrates
[1:06:34] praise god so he expands it further than
[1:06:38] than the king had done before but before
[1:06:40] saul had done
[1:06:42] he expanded the territory through
[1:06:44] garrisons amen
[1:06:47] praise god how many want expanded
[1:06:49] spiritual territory
[1:06:50] amen the time i went in natural
[1:06:52] territory
[1:06:53] because we had a tenth of an acre at our
[1:06:55] old house
[1:06:56] and i was like .10 acres i got four kids
[1:07:00] we need some more territory so now we
[1:07:03] got three quarters of an acre
[1:07:06] and i'm happy with that that's enough to
[1:07:07] mow for me but i'm not this morning i'm
[1:07:10] not talking about
[1:07:11] natural territory i'm talking about
[1:07:13] spiritual territory
[1:07:16] we need spiritual territory in other
[1:07:18] words we need god's
[1:07:19] forces to expand what we possess amen
[1:07:23] we need more uh protection to stay
[1:07:26] means praise god another we need a
[1:07:30] bigger buffer how many thankful for your
[1:07:32] buffer on your car
[1:07:33] your bumper your buffer bumper i'm
[1:07:36] thankful for that you ever got a fender
[1:07:37] bender
[1:07:38] oh thank god for that bumper that was
[1:07:39] there i've been thankful for that
[1:07:43] uh so we we need this protection
[1:07:46] and the and the the the the symbolism
[1:07:49] brother bran gives is that
[1:07:50] if i'm going out to battle the enemy
[1:07:53] it's the garrisons of people's prayers
[1:07:56] that's going to protect me
[1:07:59] in other words when brother ben goes out
[1:08:00] this is a spiritual territory
[1:08:02] well enemies are going to try to get in
[1:08:03] and get to brother branham now jerusalem
[1:08:05] is the capital so let's say brother ran
[1:08:06] into the capital
[1:08:07] so he has this protection that the
[1:08:09] devils are not going to be able to
[1:08:11] deceive him the devils are not going to
[1:08:13] be able to make him sick
[1:08:15] the devils are not going to uh steal
[1:08:17] souls away right or
[1:08:18] mislead souls as long as people are
[1:08:21] praying amen
[1:08:22] as long as they're doing their part in
[1:08:24] the battle as long as the soldiers
[1:08:26] are staying at their post of duty and
[1:08:28] their garrisons
[1:08:29] souls will be one praise god
[1:08:33] the kingdom of god will move forward as
[1:08:36] long
[1:08:36] as everybody's praying at their post of
[1:08:38] duty
[1:08:41] god's servants will be god's servants
[1:08:43] that are public servants
[1:08:44] will be able to be victorious as long as
[1:08:47] the private servants are doing their job
[1:08:49] do
[1:08:50] now don't get me wrong the public
[1:08:51] servants need to pray too
[1:08:53] that's where i get a lot of trouble
[1:08:54] these preachers get real comfortable i
[1:08:55] got a balance too
[1:08:56] every preacher's got a battle right we
[1:08:58] get comfortable
[1:08:59] we stop praying we stop seeking the lord
[1:09:01] well we saw what happens with
[1:09:03] uzziah right he was prosperous as long
[1:09:06] as he sought the lord
[1:09:08] at the end of his life he stopped
[1:09:10] seeking for the wisdom of god
[1:09:11] he thought he could do it all by himself
[1:09:13] happens a lot of preachers today
[1:09:15] they stopped really seeking for more
[1:09:16] revelation just preach the same old
[1:09:18] thing over and over
[1:09:19] and people know too i mean you can tell
[1:09:21] right you can tell
[1:09:23] hallelujah but see we got to keep our
[1:09:25] face before god
[1:09:27] but brother branham's territory brother
[1:09:28] i was going to be saved as long as the
[1:09:30] saints
[1:09:31] kept their garrisons as long as
[1:09:34] everybody did their part
[1:09:38] let me go back see i preached this back
[1:09:42] here's the screenshot i preach it back
[1:09:43] on september
[1:09:44] 15 2019 i preach garrison by prayer
[1:09:47] remember
[1:09:48] that one ah maybe somebody does it even
[1:09:51] there's a pm service you know evening
[1:09:53] service
[1:09:55] so remember a garrison is a station
[1:09:59] it's a place where somebody stands it's
[1:10:01] a a military or a fortified post
[1:10:05] and remember jonathan in this story in
[1:10:07] first uh samuel 13 we're not going to
[1:10:08] read there but
[1:10:10] jonathan actually possessed one
[1:10:13] of the philistines garrisons because he
[1:10:16] and a friend
[1:10:17] went up against it and i want to just
[1:10:20] remind you that uh overtaking and taking
[1:10:24] the enemy's land
[1:10:25] is an uphill battle
[1:10:29] in other words we're not going to get
[1:10:31] spiritual victories with the weak
[1:10:32] behavior or weak effort
[1:10:35] you can look we're not going to read the
[1:10:36] scripture but before he goes there he
[1:10:38] says lord
[1:10:39] we're going to call over to these
[1:10:40] philistines and and if they say you know
[1:10:42] come up we'll come up and that'll be our
[1:10:44] sign to get the victory
[1:10:46] but it was an uphill battle church how
[1:10:48] many once your loved one saved
[1:10:50] i want to see your children fill with
[1:10:51] the holy ghost i'm going to see
[1:10:53] i mean if we want these victories we got
[1:10:56] to be ready for an uphill battle praise
[1:10:58] god
[1:10:58] we can't be discouraged right we can't
[1:11:00] be discouraged on the way up
[1:11:02] because once jonathan got up there
[1:11:04] brother sister oh my he and his worker
[1:11:06] they knocked down about 20 those boys
[1:11:08] and then saul looks out and said who's
[1:11:10] out there fighting did he eat my honey
[1:11:12] or i might be mixing up the stories but
[1:11:14] anyways he was upset about it i can't
[1:11:16] quite remember
[1:11:17] it's one of those stories but he was all
[1:11:19] upset who's that guy out there who
[1:11:20] who's knocking over the philistines you
[1:11:22] know because he wanted he won the glory
[1:11:23] for himself you know but jonathan didn't
[1:11:27] go by his own leading
[1:11:28] he went by the ephod he went by the word
[1:11:32] praise god
[1:11:33] because the ephod had the urban
[1:11:34] thunderball in it praise god
[1:11:36] and that's what we need to do church
[1:11:38] whenever we go to get a victory whenever
[1:11:40] we try to possess
[1:11:41] uh grounds we gotta make sure the ephod
[1:11:44] goes with us
[1:11:45] amen make sure we consult the word first
[1:11:48] amen
[1:11:51] that's right that's a beautiful story
[1:11:55] so you gotta take along the word with
[1:11:56] you you gotta take the priest right the
[1:11:58] word
[1:11:59] not a person but the word someone who's
[1:12:01] got the word you gotta take the word
[1:12:03] with you
[1:12:04] and that will direct your victory but it
[1:12:06] was an uphill battle
[1:12:08] in other words we can't give up church
[1:12:10] after a few days
[1:12:13] how many times we prayed for your your
[1:12:14] your parents brother amen sister
[1:12:16] how many times do we pray for your
[1:12:17] parents same thing man
[1:12:20] we can't give up praise god it's an
[1:12:22] uphill battle
[1:12:24] hallelujah taking ground is not an easy
[1:12:27] footstep our possession step that's not
[1:12:30] an easy thing praise god
[1:12:31] it takes real warriors that are sincere
[1:12:36] that are keeping their hearts and minds
[1:12:39] by the peace of god
[1:12:41] amen
[1:12:46] see remember i said this earlier uh back
[1:12:49] in september
[1:12:50] 2019 garrisons were only built when much
[1:12:53] land had been possessed
[1:12:54] israel had to have an altar temple city
[1:12:56] while remember that and then and only
[1:12:58] then could the garrisons be established
[1:13:00] see a prayer life must be established
[1:13:02] and maintained
[1:13:04] right especially as our younger children
[1:13:06] when they've been baptized
[1:13:07] they've got to and as adults we've got
[1:13:10] to maintain our garrisons
[1:13:12] right and hopefully expand them but as a
[1:13:14] child as a young
[1:13:16] child that's been baptized they've got
[1:13:18] to work at
[1:13:19] building a prayer life praise god you
[1:13:22] just don't start with the prayer life
[1:13:24] i mean you got to get saved right you
[1:13:26] got to get the altar you got to go to
[1:13:27] the cross and
[1:13:28] you got to have an experience with god
[1:13:31] and then if you're going to be a
[1:13:32] victorious warrior
[1:13:34] you've got to slowly build up a prayer
[1:13:36] life daily read your bible
[1:13:37] daily pray and make sure it's thankful
[1:13:39] praying
[1:13:43] you've got to build it up saul got some
[1:13:46] great victories
[1:13:47] but he didn't build it further and
[1:13:49] expand it like david did
[1:13:51] now that shows you something right there
[1:13:52] a man or woman after the heart of god
[1:13:54] they'll get more victories they'll
[1:13:56] expand their territory praise god
[1:13:58] they'll grow in the things of god
[1:14:02] i believe that hallelujah
[1:14:05] so see a prayer life church we got to
[1:14:07] establish it and brother iran was
[1:14:09] trusting
[1:14:09] on the prayer lives of the people for
[1:14:12] victory
[1:14:14] now here's a couple examples let's read
[1:14:17] uh second samuel eight
[1:14:19] i got my i forgot my colon in there
[1:14:23] there's no second samuel 81 don't don't
[1:14:25] read your bible don't go looking for
[1:14:26] that
[1:14:27] read your bible but you won't find
[1:14:28] second samuel 81 forgive me
[1:14:31] let's read that there sorry
[1:14:37] second samuel 8 1-6
[1:14:43] and after this it came to pass that
[1:14:44] david smote the philistines and subdued
[1:14:46] them
[1:14:46] and david took methic emma out of the
[1:14:49] hand of the philistines now look he's
[1:14:51] possessing the land church
[1:14:52] right and he smoked moab and measured
[1:14:55] them with a line
[1:14:56] casting them down to the ground that's
[1:14:58] what we need to do cast out anything
[1:15:00] that exalts itself against the word of
[1:15:02] god
[1:15:03] see he's casting it down praise god he's
[1:15:06] walking in the spirit
[1:15:07] he's conquering devils amen
[1:15:10] that's what we need to do church he says
[1:15:13] and so
[1:15:14] i'm sorry
[1:15:18] let me find my spot i lost in verse two
[1:15:19] there two lines okay
[1:15:22] uh even with two lines measuring you to
[1:15:23] put uh to death
[1:15:25] with one full line to keep alive and so
[1:15:27] the moabites became david's servants
[1:15:29] and brought gifts amen
[1:15:33] verse three david smole also had a
[1:15:35] deezer
[1:15:37] the son of rihab king of zoba as he went
[1:15:39] to recover his border
[1:15:41] at the river euphrates and david took
[1:15:44] him a thousand chariots and 700 horsemen
[1:15:46] and 20
[1:15:47] 000 footmen and david hoffed all the
[1:15:49] chariot horses
[1:15:50] reserved of them for a hundred chariots
[1:15:53] and when the syrians of damascus came to
[1:15:55] sakura had to had a deezer king of
[1:15:58] zoba david slew the syrians two and
[1:16:00] twenty
[1:16:01] thousand men twenty two thousand souls
[1:16:05] then david put garrisons in syria of
[1:16:07] damascus
[1:16:09] and the syrians became servants to david
[1:16:11] and brought gifts and the lord preserved
[1:16:13] david
[1:16:14] whither so ever he went praise god
[1:16:18] that sounds like an easy thing to do to
[1:16:19] get more land
[1:16:22] does it sound like david had to be more
[1:16:24] diligent or less diligent to possess the
[1:16:26] land
[1:16:28] i think you know the answer is praise
[1:16:30] god because the bible said keep your
[1:16:32] mind and heart with all diligence amen
[1:16:35] amen right so david had to be extremely
[1:16:39] diligent
[1:16:40] he had to be extremely focused and he
[1:16:43] was able to recover now recover
[1:16:45] history says they never even had it they
[1:16:48] were promised this border
[1:16:50] they were promised the border and joshua
[1:16:52] won but the bible said they never drove
[1:16:55] them all out
[1:16:56] so he recovered the promise that was
[1:16:59] given to him i believe it was a
[1:17:01] 400 or 500 years later praise god
[1:17:04] i think about that all the other
[1:17:06] generations couldn't accomplish this but
[1:17:08] david accomplished it
[1:17:10] by a heart that was after the heart of
[1:17:12] god
[1:17:13] amen and church one day there's going to
[1:17:15] be a bride
[1:17:16] that accomplishes a prophecy that no
[1:17:19] other bride has accomplished
[1:17:20] it's called the meeting in the air amen
[1:17:23] it's been promised for generations
[1:17:25] but one of these days amen there's going
[1:17:27] to be a bread that's after the heart of
[1:17:29] jesus
[1:17:30] that accomplishes that prophecy
[1:17:33] it's not because the other ones weren't
[1:17:34] born again right because we know brother
[1:17:35] was born again and paul was born again
[1:17:37] but they will come in to the right time
[1:17:40] and season
[1:17:41] god has a time and season for everything
[1:17:43] but that ride when she possesses that
[1:17:45] promise it'll be god's time
[1:17:47] it'll be god's season it won't be one
[1:17:48] second too late
[1:17:50] won't be one second early it'll be right
[1:17:52] on time praise god
[1:17:57] and now church david is so victorious
[1:17:58] because this is before his sin with
[1:18:00] bathsheba
[1:18:02] after it after his sin it's just trouble
[1:18:04] after trouble after trouble
[1:18:06] but before that sin he was on fire with
[1:18:08] the holy ghost he was
[1:18:09] it was victory after victory more
[1:18:11] possession more and that's what we've
[1:18:13] got to do we got to stay true to god
[1:18:15] if we fall short god forgive us but it
[1:18:17] may not be something that extreme
[1:18:19] praise god because a born-again person
[1:18:22] won't do something like that praise god
[1:18:24] so see we've got to be able to to keep
[1:18:26] in prayer
[1:18:27] keep the ephod amen keep consulting the
[1:18:30] ark of god amen
[1:18:32] keep consulting the urim and summon and
[1:18:34] we'll possess
[1:18:35] more and more promises that's right
[1:18:38] i read asa this morning this was
[1:18:40] actually the chapter you know i read one
[1:18:41] chapter morning and everything
[1:18:43] and this is actually the chapter i read
[1:18:44] this morning so it worked out great
[1:18:45] second chronicles 14. let's go there
[1:18:52] one time i met a brother named ace and i
[1:18:53] thought what where'd that name come from
[1:18:55] and then i read about him in the bible
[1:18:56] he was a mighty man of god
[1:18:58] he was kind of like you zai he kind of
[1:18:59] fell away at the end got a little
[1:19:01] prideful but you know
[1:19:02] everybody falls short of god's glory but
[1:19:04] what a beautiful testimony this man had
[1:19:08] second chronicles 14.
[1:19:21] now look at this prayer as a garrison
[1:19:26] let's go down to verse two uh chronicles
[1:19:29] 14
[1:19:29] 2 and ace did that which was good and
[1:19:33] right in the eyes of the lord wouldn't
[1:19:34] you like
[1:19:34] god to say that about you if somebody
[1:19:36] wrote a book about you wouldn't you like
[1:19:38] them to say it about you
[1:19:39] boy she did what was good and what was
[1:19:41] right in god's sight
[1:19:44] i love those summaries and he took away
[1:19:46] the altars of the strange gods and the
[1:19:48] high places and break down the images
[1:19:49] and cut down the groves
[1:19:51] and command of judah to seek the lord
[1:19:52] god of their fathers and to do the law
[1:19:54] and the commandment
[1:19:55] and he took away out of all the cities
[1:19:59] of judah the high places
[1:20:00] of the images and the kingdom was quiet
[1:20:02] before him
[1:20:04] see look what happens when you start
[1:20:05] taking over things quiet down pray god
[1:20:08] gives you peace
[1:20:09] see the peter is the peace of god passes
[1:20:11] all understanding amen
[1:20:13] hallelujah when we get serious and we
[1:20:16] really fight the enemy with god's word
[1:20:17] look what happens peace comes upon us
[1:20:21] oh thank the lord hallelujah there's a
[1:20:25] new
[1:20:25] one amen uh six and he built fence
[1:20:28] cities in judah
[1:20:29] fences fences
[1:20:33] for the land had rest and had no war in
[1:20:35] those years
[1:20:36] because the lord had given him rest why
[1:20:38] didn't he have wars
[1:20:39] because he had been faithful to the word
[1:20:41] of god and driven back the enemy
[1:20:43] he'd been dedicated to the things of god
[1:20:45] and when he's dedicated like that
[1:20:47] god protects him god gives him a buffer
[1:20:50] 10-year buffer amen
[1:20:51] can you imagine i haven't had battle for
[1:20:53] 10 years no bat no major battles for 10
[1:20:56] years
[1:20:57] because he so served god because he i'll
[1:21:00] say like this
[1:21:01] he took care of his private sin right
[1:21:04] he took care of all the idols praise god
[1:21:07] he went through his house right and he
[1:21:09] cleaned out all the trash amen
[1:21:11] he applied the token is that right he
[1:21:14] applied the token
[1:21:15] and because he did that god gave him 10
[1:21:17] years
[1:21:18] no major battles
[1:21:24] what a what a testimony so what does he
[1:21:26] do well this time does he just sit back
[1:21:28] and get drunk or do
[1:21:30] all kinds of things no he actually
[1:21:32] starts building
[1:21:33] he starts building his kingdom he built
[1:21:36] the fence cities in verse six the land
[1:21:37] had rescue now verse seven therefore he
[1:21:39] said to judah let us build these cities
[1:21:41] and make about them walls and towers
[1:21:43] gates and bars
[1:21:44] while the land is yet before us
[1:21:48] because we have sought the lord our god
[1:21:49] we have sought him and he has given us
[1:21:51] rest on every side so they
[1:21:52] built and prosper amen
[1:21:56] so see once he got rid of all the sin he
[1:21:58] started
[1:21:59] building and establishing his kingdom
[1:22:01] because there would come a time
[1:22:02] when he might need to fight and you'll
[1:22:05] we see it in the next chapter actually
[1:22:07] he starts he has a battle but see god
[1:22:10] gave him rest
[1:22:11] and church that's how we do we'll come
[1:22:12] through a difficult battle
[1:22:14] but the time after that is not to get
[1:22:16] lazy on god
[1:22:17] the time is to build up our prayer time
[1:22:19] or build up our fellowship or
[1:22:21] or build up our understanding of god's
[1:22:23] word
[1:22:25] it's not to click less on the bible's
[1:22:27] videos on our youtube it's to click more
[1:22:29] on them praise god
[1:22:31] right it's to build up our spiritual
[1:22:33] state
[1:22:34] not just let it loose or whatever we're
[1:22:37] clicking on
[1:22:41] see so he had he had to get this uh uh
[1:22:44] he had this great holy spirit anointing
[1:22:46] him
[1:22:46] when he got the victory he said i'm
[1:22:48] gonna strengthen my kingdom i'm gonna
[1:22:49] make sure this city strong that city
[1:22:51] strong i'm going to give them
[1:22:52] reinforcements
[1:22:53] i'm going to build this up so we're a
[1:22:55] strong nation
[1:22:57] they built and prospered
[1:23:01] verse 8 and asia had an army of men that
[1:23:03] bear targets and spears out of
[1:23:04] judah three hundred thousand and out of
[1:23:06] benjamin that bear shields and drew bows
[1:23:08] two hundred
[1:23:09] and four score thousand all these were
[1:23:11] mighty
[1:23:12] men of value valor yeah now in the rest
[1:23:15] of the chapter
[1:23:16] a king from ethiopia comes now look at
[1:23:18] this i love this
[1:23:21] a king from ethiopia comes and he's he's
[1:23:23] outnumbering asa
[1:23:25] and here's a man listen church he's
[1:23:27] already dedicated to god
[1:23:29] there's no sin in his life
[1:23:32] and look how he prays i love this the
[1:23:35] point i'm trying to be is that
[1:23:36] if you're really walking with god you'll
[1:23:38] always be desperate for his presence
[1:23:42] in other words you'll keep hungering and
[1:23:43] thirsting for righteousness
[1:23:46] he's already got peace he's got no
[1:23:48] enemies he's seeking god
[1:23:50] all the time he's stronger than he's
[1:23:52] ever been look at that church
[1:23:54] and when the enemy comes what's his
[1:23:56] attitude oh i'm a big i'm big somebody
[1:23:59] look at his attitude look at verse uh
[1:24:01] look at verse 11.
[1:24:05] and asa cried unto the lord his god
[1:24:09] bibraham tells us we should seek god
[1:24:11] before desperation comes
[1:24:14] see that's what asa was doing he was
[1:24:16] already seeking god
[1:24:17] before the ethiopian guy came
[1:24:20] but notice even when he comes look what
[1:24:22] he gets he gets in that desperation
[1:24:24] stage
[1:24:25] and he cries out to god let me read it
[1:24:27] he said
[1:24:28] lord it is nothing with thee to help and
[1:24:31] wither with many or with them that have
[1:24:33] no power
[1:24:33] help us o lord our god for we rest on
[1:24:36] thee and in thy name
[1:24:38] uh we go against this multitude o lord
[1:24:41] thou art our god let not man prevail
[1:24:43] against thee amen
[1:24:45] hallelujah so he cries out to god so
[1:24:47] that's what i'm saying
[1:24:48] when someone's really serving god and
[1:24:50] and and that they
[1:24:52] they're protected or they have peace or
[1:24:54] they've got a hedge about them
[1:24:55] when an enemy comes they're still
[1:24:57] desperate for god's presence they still
[1:24:59] want god
[1:25:00] close to them in order to get the
[1:25:01] victory praise god
[1:25:03] in other words someone that's really
[1:25:05] serving god that's really on fire
[1:25:07] they always are desperate for god's
[1:25:08] presence amen
[1:25:11] you would think he would have been so
[1:25:12] relaxed oh my i'm just enjoying my cup
[1:25:14] runs over
[1:25:15] i don't need to pray he needed to pray
[1:25:17] more
[1:25:18] right he was more desperate for the
[1:25:20] things of god
[1:25:21] that's how you know your life is at its
[1:25:23] best point when you're close to god
[1:25:25] you're keeping all the sin
[1:25:26] out all the the sins cleaned out but
[1:25:29] when
[1:25:30] trials come you still cry out to god for
[1:25:32] his presence
[1:25:37] beautiful what a beautiful testimony ace
[1:25:39] ahead
[1:25:41] so see this teaches fortification
[1:25:43] without obedience is useless
[1:25:46] right that's what the scripture said
[1:25:50] the bible said god gave them rest
[1:25:52] because of their victory
[1:25:54] but then they built right the the fenced
[1:25:56] cities they they built the outpost
[1:25:59] and the in the bible says that uh that
[1:26:01] that was going to protect them but
[1:26:03] really
[1:26:03] it was going to protect him because they
[1:26:05] were obeying the word of god amen
[1:26:10] right fortification without obedience is
[1:26:13] useless
[1:26:15] remember the story when samuel before
[1:26:17] saul was king
[1:26:18] they thought oh my the philistines are
[1:26:20] against us they said let's go get the
[1:26:21] ark
[1:26:22] remember that and the bible said they
[1:26:23] brought the ark in the camp and
[1:26:25] everybody shouted
[1:26:26] right and oh we're going to win now
[1:26:28] we've got the word
[1:26:30] and they go out there and they get
[1:26:31] whipped by the philistines
[1:26:33] because they were living in disobedience
[1:26:36] praise god
[1:26:37] it's the same idea here the only way we
[1:26:41] ensure victory is if it's god's will
[1:26:44] right but we must do our part we must
[1:26:46] keep our hearts diligently amen
[1:26:48] amen keep your heart with diligence and
[1:26:51] god will bring you the victory
[1:26:53] how many want to be victorious god
[1:26:55] here's your amens amen
[1:26:56] god you you've got to keep it praise god
[1:26:58] you got to keep your heart in mind amen
[1:27:01] keep it with all diligence out of your
[1:27:02] testimony flows the issue of life
[1:27:06] that's right
[1:27:10] praise god so yeah that was the picture
[1:27:12] there so david expands
[1:27:14] i just want to show that all the way up
[1:27:15] to the euphrates
[1:27:17] remember he he beat 22 000 at damascus
[1:27:21] 22 000 and then he expands the
[1:27:26] the garrisons miles and miles away
[1:27:30] wow if we can just get victories over
[1:27:33] some of these spirits right
[1:27:35] we just get victory over that lust devil
[1:27:38] we just get victory over that
[1:27:40] that pride devil amen
[1:27:43] look what a great expansion our
[1:27:45] influence will be expanded amen
[1:27:49] we can just get some of these victories
[1:27:51] praise god but if you got them then you
[1:27:53] have it already
[1:27:54] praise god but you still want to expand
[1:27:56] it for god's glory that's what james
[1:27:58] prayed
[1:27:59] right i'll share this at the end i just
[1:28:01] yesterday i heard a good youtube video
[1:28:02] man it was awesome
[1:28:04] so i was like i just went wrote my own
[1:28:05] prayer i'm like i'm going to quote every
[1:28:06] promise
[1:28:07] it's on my mind right now in prayer
[1:28:10] jabez is like make me more honorable
[1:28:12] than my brethren and not that we want to
[1:28:14] be better than other people
[1:28:15] but in other words we just want to honor
[1:28:17] god and we want we want people to see
[1:28:19] in other words we want to honor god in
[1:28:21] secret that he'll reward us openly
[1:28:24] that the light of god will shine praise
[1:28:25] god let's just city
[1:28:27] let the city on a hill shine because it
[1:28:29] can't be hidden amen
[1:28:31] not to be i want to be better than my
[1:28:33] brother i want to be better that's not
[1:28:34] the idea
[1:28:36] the idea is let me be so consecrated
[1:28:38] that my life
[1:28:39] can be a testimony and be a witness and
[1:28:41] that the sinners will have to admit
[1:28:43] jesus is with me
[1:28:47] so it's not a competition right it's not
[1:28:49] a competition see who can
[1:28:50] get the most rewards in heaven that's
[1:28:53] the wrong idea
[1:28:54] wrong idea
[1:28:59] remember brother braham just like we
[1:29:00] read in the last quote he got his
[1:29:02] strength from the prayers of the saints
[1:29:04] someone said to me long ago you've
[1:29:05] probably heard this before but man where
[1:29:07] does this come from
[1:29:08] how are you able to go meaning after
[1:29:10] meeting staying under the anointing now
[1:29:11] he's talking about the
[1:29:12] anointing of visions right because
[1:29:15] daniel had one vision he was sick on his
[1:29:16] head for a week remember that
[1:29:18] everyone uh everyone's sign made jesus
[1:29:21] week when the woman touches garments
[1:29:23] said
[1:29:23] i see you stand for an hour under that
[1:29:25] brother brahma said i like to tell you
[1:29:28] here's where it lays you don't want me
[1:29:29] to say this but my brother said near
[1:29:30] gene goad
[1:29:32] now this brother went away later and
[1:29:33] became a real
[1:29:35] real ranked sinner he's the one that got
[1:29:38] arrested out there in arizona
[1:29:40] but look see when these people were with
[1:29:41] brother brown many of them were living a
[1:29:43] godly life
[1:29:44] but when program left the scene a lot of
[1:29:46] them fell away
[1:29:48] he said that boy don't touch bread or
[1:29:50] water for days fasting and praying
[1:29:52] here says pat tyler i don't know about
[1:29:53] him he may have been a good gentleman
[1:29:55] hope so
[1:29:56] this other brother sitting here by him
[1:29:58] then men lay on their faces without food
[1:30:00] and water
[1:30:00] when i'm in a meeting praying for me
[1:30:02] that's where it comes from if there
[1:30:04] wasn't something like that i'd go
[1:30:06] down so why was brother branham able to
[1:30:09] handle more visions because the people
[1:30:11] prayed and fasted for him
[1:30:14] that's men that's behind the curtain the
[1:30:17] man who prays for strength for a message
[1:30:19] then that they lay down everything
[1:30:23] maybe they haven't got the gifts to do
[1:30:25] these things i'll tell you they got to
[1:30:26] get to praying fast
[1:30:28] praise god they might not have a gift to
[1:30:30] discern but they sure got a gift to pray
[1:30:32] and fast
[1:30:36] maybe they haven't got the gifts to do
[1:30:38] these things but they're putting every
[1:30:39] effort
[1:30:40] all diligence but
[1:30:43] how are you so successful how can you do
[1:30:45] things other people can't do
[1:30:47] people are diligent people are
[1:30:49] diligently praying for me
[1:30:51] that's okay buddy let me get that one
[1:30:54] yeah that was a
[1:30:55] that was not too bad you know some toys
[1:30:57] are louder than others you know
[1:30:58] that's actually pretty nice he said
[1:31:01] they lay down everything he said every
[1:31:04] effort see diligence
[1:31:06] and the only way they can do they know
[1:31:08] is prayer before
[1:31:09] god and fasting there's where the power
[1:31:12] lays
[1:31:13] let someone pray for you
[1:31:17] hallelujah amen church i can really use
[1:31:20] your prayers thank you for your prayers
[1:31:21] i could use them in the future too and
[1:31:24] i'll pray for you too praise god
[1:31:26] where's the power lay prayers of the
[1:31:28] saints the garrisons right
[1:31:30] the people out there their prayers are
[1:31:32] standing and protecting you
[1:31:35] because the bible said some kind only go
[1:31:38] out by prayer and fasting
[1:31:40] and the whole multitude sought to touch
[1:31:42] him for there went
[1:31:44] virtue out of him and healed them so see
[1:31:45] this is one brother said
[1:31:47] visions you know take your strength
[1:31:49] right
[1:31:50] so brother man said how can he they said
[1:31:52] how can you have so many visions well
[1:31:53] the people are praying for me
[1:31:55] people are praying for me and remember
[1:31:58] the power of unity church
[1:32:00] this is after peter raised that man he
[1:32:01] said the malteser to them that believe
[1:32:03] were of one heart and one soul
[1:32:05] neither said any of them that all of the
[1:32:07] things which he possessed was his own
[1:32:09] but they had all things in common and
[1:32:11] with great power gave the apostles
[1:32:12] witness of the resurrection of the lord
[1:32:14] jesus
[1:32:15] and great grace was upon them all
[1:32:18] neither was there any among them that
[1:32:20] lacked for as many as were possessors of
[1:32:21] lands or houses sold them
[1:32:23] and brought the peace prices of the
[1:32:25] things that were sold
[1:32:26] and laid them down at the apostles feet
[1:32:28] and distribution was made unto every man
[1:32:31] according as he had need look at the
[1:32:33] power of unity here church
[1:32:35] brother brahm had that unity the
[1:32:36] brothers were behind him
[1:32:38] right and so because the brothers were
[1:32:40] behind him faster than praying
[1:32:42] for him he was able to pray for the sick
[1:32:44] and god heal the sick
[1:32:46] he was able to handle more than what
[1:32:49] other prophets had handled think about
[1:32:51] that
[1:32:51] my goodness more than daniel right more
[1:32:54] than
[1:32:55] ezekiel he could handle more because
[1:32:57] brothers and sisters were laying down
[1:32:59] their meals
[1:33:01] so that god could bless the ministry of
[1:33:02] the prophet
[1:33:04] right and look god gave god gave them
[1:33:07] what kind of power when they were in one
[1:33:08] heart one soul
[1:33:10] god gave them great power amen
[1:33:14] what am i saying we want to have great
[1:33:15] power among us too
[1:33:17] and we want to be united in the faith
[1:33:19] praise god
[1:33:21] so it's going to take unity it's going
[1:33:23] to take prayer fasting is going to take
[1:33:24] diligence
[1:33:25] keeping our minds diligently praying
[1:33:28] right letting the peace of god
[1:33:30] protect us protect our church protect
[1:33:32] our loved ones
[1:33:34] that's that's up to us right solomon
[1:33:37] said
[1:33:37] you keep your heart with all diligence
[1:33:39] you keep it
[1:33:40] right you give diligence and uh set that
[1:33:43] barrier
[1:33:44] let that barrier peace protect you and
[1:33:46] your family and your church
[1:33:48] hallelujah now verse eight so i'm
[1:33:51] finally off verse seven now i'm gonna go
[1:33:52] to verse eight
[1:33:54] he said finally brethren what several
[1:33:56] things are true
[1:33:57] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:33:59] things are just whatsoever things are
[1:34:00] pure
[1:34:01] what sort of things are lovely
[1:34:03] whatsoever things are of good rapport if
[1:34:04] there be any virtue
[1:34:05] if there be any praise think on these
[1:34:08] things notice again
[1:34:09] your mind has eight ways to be
[1:34:11] transformed
[1:34:12] just choose one of them right there's
[1:34:15] eight different channels remember
[1:34:16] eight's the number of new beginnings
[1:34:18] eternity
[1:34:19] right uh it's new beginnings it's
[1:34:23] newness it's
[1:34:24] uh there's so many great things about
[1:34:25] the number eight i got a whole list of
[1:34:26] them
[1:34:28] so there's eight different things if you
[1:34:30] meditate on these now remember this is
[1:34:32] after prayer and this is where satan
[1:34:34] like satan likes to get in
[1:34:36] right between these verses right so
[1:34:37] here's chapter seven pray with
[1:34:38] thanksgiving and you have the peace of
[1:34:40] god
[1:34:40] but then he says now you gotta think
[1:34:44] on the things of god amen how many know
[1:34:47] you can have a good prayer
[1:34:48] right and then shortly after that satan
[1:34:50] will try to attack you
[1:34:52] throw your mind off so you had the right
[1:34:55] prayer but then he kind of got you to
[1:34:57] think about something else
[1:34:59] see that's kind of what we're that's our
[1:35:00] battlefield right that's why we're
[1:35:01] supposed to be trained soldiers
[1:35:03] i just think it's so beautiful right
[1:35:05] after the thank thankful prayers and the
[1:35:06] peace of god
[1:35:07] then he says now you've got to keep your
[1:35:08] mind on the things of god
[1:35:12] keep your mind on the things of god so
[1:35:14] you meditate on things that are true
[1:35:17] honest just pure
[1:35:20] lovely good report virtuous
[1:35:23] praiseworthy right
[1:35:27] now here's what i want to share for this
[1:35:28] week i'm almost done because i've
[1:35:29] already preached about an hour
[1:35:32] just this week in the youtube comments
[1:35:33] on my joseph video
[1:35:35] i was called or accused of the following
[1:35:38] and let me tell you when i read some of
[1:35:40] these sometimes i get a little attack on
[1:35:41] me
[1:35:42] but it's nothing like a in-your-face
[1:35:44] kind of attack
[1:35:46] right because it's still just through a
[1:35:47] screen right but this week just for
[1:35:49] making that video i was calling a
[1:35:50] laodicean
[1:35:52] i was called a feeder of bat droppings i
[1:35:55] know that's strange but i changed the
[1:35:56] words
[1:35:57] to that isn't that just wicked
[1:36:00] i didn't even respond reply that when i
[1:36:02] just leave that when i prayed for that
[1:36:03] guy
[1:36:05] they said i had a worldly haircut but
[1:36:06] yet the only way it's breaking the word
[1:36:09] is if you it's long and uncut where is
[1:36:12] that in the bible
[1:36:13] but iran said jesus had hair down to his
[1:36:15] shoulders
[1:36:17] but i've got short hair it just shows
[1:36:19] you how much wisdom people don't have
[1:36:25] they call me a blasphemer
[1:36:28] they said i'm doomed i'm doomed because
[1:36:30] i i don't believe joseph branham's a
[1:36:32] prophet
[1:36:34] they say i'm jealous of him i'm not
[1:36:36] jealous of him i'm happy for him in some
[1:36:37] ways
[1:36:38] some ways i'm really sad for him
[1:36:43] they called me a pitiful human for
[1:36:46] making that video
[1:36:47] they called me childish and they told me
[1:36:50] to
[1:36:50] shut up but i've learned this church
[1:36:54] i've learned i can see those the program
[1:36:58] says if
[1:36:58] you can't take the knocks of the people
[1:37:00] he said you need to go back to the cross
[1:37:03] praise god he told the preachers he said
[1:37:05] you preachers if you can't handle the
[1:37:07] knocks of the people you need to go back
[1:37:08] he said
[1:37:09] rededicate your walk at the foot of the
[1:37:11] cross
[1:37:13] praise god in other words if you can't
[1:37:15] stand the heat get out of the kitchen
[1:37:19] you can't fight if you can't handle the
[1:37:21] heat of the battle get off the
[1:37:22] battlefield
[1:37:23] well i'm sorry i ain't retreating praise
[1:37:25] god i ain't leaving the kitchen
[1:37:29] i'm on the battlefield for the word of
[1:37:30] god amen
[1:37:33] so i just learned to pass it on and you
[1:37:35] can see my comments you don't have to
[1:37:36] but
[1:37:37] so my comments are well dear lord please
[1:37:39] forgive sally or please forgive
[1:37:41] gene or whoever it is please forgive
[1:37:44] them
[1:37:44] because they don't know what they're
[1:37:46] saying
[1:37:49] they rejected the spirit of truth and
[1:37:50] that's what i do i just try to pray god
[1:37:52] please pray for them because they have
[1:37:55] no scriptures to back up their
[1:37:56] accusations
[1:37:58] please pray for them so i've learned
[1:38:00] church that
[1:38:01] when i and i i feel the attack i feel
[1:38:03] the attack
[1:38:05] i've learned when i get those i gotta
[1:38:07] instantly forgive
[1:38:08] and i gotta pray and i gotta be thankful
[1:38:12] i gotta be thankful and i've got to then
[1:38:15] think about things that are true
[1:38:17] honest just pure lovely good report
[1:38:19] virtuous
[1:38:21] and praiseworthy but church i've learned
[1:38:24] this
[1:38:26] the words of a close friend heard a
[1:38:28] whole lot more
[1:38:30] than words of strangers now church this
[1:38:33] is why
[1:38:35] peter said god has to give you the holy
[1:38:37] ghost i'm sorry
[1:38:38] god has to give you broadly kindness
[1:38:40] before he gives you charity on the stats
[1:38:42] perfect man
[1:38:43] breadly kindness is love for your
[1:38:45] brothers and sisters
[1:38:47] what's the last thing god gives you
[1:38:49] before you virtue in the kingdom of god
[1:38:51] brotherly love so that when you get in
[1:38:53] the family of god
[1:38:54] you'll be able to treat the brothers and
[1:38:56] sisters with kindness
[1:38:58] even when they call you a devil
[1:39:02] hallelujah he makes sure before i cap
[1:39:05] him before i seal that one off
[1:39:06] that last anointing is he's going to be
[1:39:08] kind to the people in the family of god
[1:39:12] i'll say like this those that are
[1:39:13] temporarily in the family of god right
[1:39:16] because jesus can brought their names
[1:39:17] off the book of life that would be awful
[1:39:20] but that happens sometimes
[1:39:22] david wrote for it was not an enemy that
[1:39:24] reproached me then i could abort
[1:39:27] see it's easy to bear these people you
[1:39:29] never see him face to face you never see
[1:39:31] him at any parties or anything like that
[1:39:33] or fellowships
[1:39:36] he said neither was it he that hated me
[1:39:38] that did magnify himself against me
[1:39:40] then i would have hid myself from him
[1:39:42] but it was thou
[1:39:43] a man mine equal my god my acquaintance
[1:39:46] we took sweet counsel together and
[1:39:48] walked on the house of god
[1:39:50] in company
[1:39:53] where did jesus get his deepest wounds
[1:39:55] in the house of his friends
[1:40:01] so church we want to use thankful
[1:40:02] prayers we want to express
[1:40:04] our request to god and then after prayer
[1:40:08] we want to meditate
[1:40:10] on things that are beautiful right
[1:40:12] things that are true
[1:40:13] things that are honest of good report
[1:40:16] let's stand to our feet
[1:40:19] can i just close these last few slides
[1:40:21] here
[1:40:25] verse 9 he says those things which you
[1:40:28] have both learned
[1:40:28] and received and heard and seen in me do
[1:40:32] and the god of peace shall be with you
[1:40:35] in other words follow the prophets as
[1:40:36] the example
[1:40:39] how many one god be with them amen paul
[1:40:41] said follow my example
[1:40:43] that church the amazing thing they
[1:40:45] hadn't seen him
[1:40:46] for 11 years and he says those things
[1:40:50] that you've seen in me or learned from
[1:40:52] me it's been 11 years
[1:40:53] can you remember a sermon from 11 years
[1:40:55] ago brother
[1:40:56] you might remember a couple these people
[1:41:00] must have a real good strong anointing
[1:41:01] on them right before uh commercials and
[1:41:03] before they they shortened our attention
[1:41:05] span right
[1:41:08] he said remember all those things i
[1:41:10] taught you 11 years earlier but now
[1:41:12] they've had preaching for 11 years since
[1:41:13] then
[1:41:14] he says remember the things i taught you
[1:41:17] remember
[1:41:18] what you saw in my life from 11 years
[1:41:20] ago
[1:41:22] see there was very few of them that
[1:41:23] would have if their church was growing
[1:41:25] like
[1:41:25] the churches were growing a lot in that
[1:41:27] time most of them never would have heard
[1:41:29] is
[1:41:30] oh i'm sorry most of them would have
[1:41:31] only heard of his character
[1:41:34] because he was there in about 50 a.d
[1:41:38] in other words they saw paul's life
[1:41:40] church they saw
[1:41:42] that his mind was constantly on the
[1:41:44] things of god
[1:41:46] and he cast down any enemy that was
[1:41:48] trying to get his mind off anything
[1:41:52] any time anxiousness tried to take him
[1:41:53] over and the end of the chapter tells us
[1:41:55] the anxious things he was anxious about
[1:41:57] in church he had some real anxious
[1:41:58] problems he had some real things that
[1:42:00] you and i might be anxious about
[1:42:02] like what am i going to eat like what am
[1:42:04] i going to wear
[1:42:06] i mean things that we don't we don't
[1:42:08] battle
[1:42:09] and yet they noticed some of them were
[1:42:11] still in the church and they noticed
[1:42:12] that this man
[1:42:13] had such a power over these natural
[1:42:16] things
[1:42:17] he had such a peace that was protecting
[1:42:20] him
[1:42:20] in other words they saw satan couldn't
[1:42:22] get to him because he was surrounded by
[1:42:24] garrisons
[1:42:26] he was surrounded by a hedge hallelujah
[1:42:28] he was surrounded by the power of god
[1:42:32] like this man he's like moses
[1:42:36] pharaoh can't get to him
[1:42:39] what a what a spiritual uh uh overcomer
[1:42:43] through what prayer prayer thanking god
[1:42:47] making you pouring out your heart to god
[1:42:49] getting letting off the pressure
[1:42:51] and then meditating on the things of god
[1:42:55] let's close service with
[1:42:57] let's close with some thankful prayers
[1:42:58] can we do that go and
[1:43:00] stop the lives live stream here some
[1:43:03] people may need prayer today musicians
[1:43:04] if you'll come
[1:43:05] let's let's
