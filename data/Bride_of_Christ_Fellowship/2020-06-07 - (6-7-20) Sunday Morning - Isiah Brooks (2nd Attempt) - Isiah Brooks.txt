TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] god is good to us I'm saying one more when I get right into the word not as young as I used to be in the morning when I rise in the morning weena [Music] give me cheese give me gee [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] selections especially the one Smith family song it take a lot of courage to get up before an audience especially when you're young I appreciate everything that was done we enjoyed your selection as well brother we appreciate that all the praise and worship that is gone before the Lord I praise God for the message last night uh I don't know about y'all but I'm still on fire you know hey ma it's cold sometimes with the air conditioning but it doesn't cook it doesn't chill the inside that's right we preached by God's grace as I said I'm a little hoarse but we're gonna scream it out again we preached on Friday hearing the voice of the scripture and we're going to minister that again what we're trying to take another part of a portion of it I have been working on this for some time it was a revelation that God gave me and I trust that you'll be able to see that what God is doing in this last day yes as we have you stand let us turn to the scripture according to Matthew 17 we read the 18th through the 20th verse and being then we'll really go down to Philippians of 1:1 is 6 and from there we'll go to Luke 11:1 you love the Lord I am somewhat a crybaby especially when I feel the presence of the Lord I can't help myself and if what I could even if I could I wouldn't I enjoy Jesus hallelujah Matthew 17 everybody there we're going to be starting at the 18th verse appreciate my son being here with his family we enjoyed him last night by God's graces I trust that the Lord will bless him as well and everybody else tonight or this morning Matthew 17 18 292 the 20th verse and Jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour then came the disciples of Jesus apart and said why could we not cast him out and Jesus said unto him because of your unbelief for bearly I said to you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you now I want to really emphasize that last portion nothing shall be impossible unto you all right let's go to Philippians 1:6 you love the Lord so when I cry I have a little running but I think I'm gonna be real with family we don't have any sophisticated folks up again Philippians 1:6 being confident of this very thing that he which have begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ I want to say to everyone that felt God and knew he was here last night he started something one thing about the Lord Jesus whatever he starts he finishes and the thing I love about my Lord he's a perfectionist [Laughter] he leaves nothing undone Luke 11:1 excuse me that I say that a mini 11:1 Luke 11:1 and it came to pass I love that saying and it came to pass yes that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto Him Lord teach us to pray and John also taught his two cents on also taught his disciples and he said unto them when you pray say this is what I love he didn't say my father he said our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven see I like that that means I can shower I can dance I can run I can live holy yes because that's the way they do it in heaven in other words he says pray that you bring heaven down to earth act like you them in heaven I don't know about you but I've been translated explain that in just a moment you say what do you mean brother I'm now sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus yes and some of us won't even believe that but let me say it like this even when it came to Einstein he actually believed in revit relativity he understood that you could be in two places at one time and Jesus said explain to me how the Son of Man stand here on earth and is in heaven too right you don't understand but those of us who have theophanies we in heaven so if I'm already damned I'm already there amen we're gonna go on with it give us this day our daily bread you know I think about that and I think about it's only in this age we have been able to have daily bread all of the ages except for Paul's age they couldn't have it they didn't have it they lost the word they had a portion of the word but in this day God gave us the full law and forgive us of our sins for we also forgive everyone that is gathered unto us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil let us pray father God we come before you right now in your name help us Lord i bind every spirit here that's not like the Lord Jesus I know there are those who are tired some that are weary but I pray father God that by your grace and your mercy age that you would touch them give them energy and give them strength in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen the harder you pull the quicker we get out of here if you pull in slow motion i'ma move in slow motion you may be seated I like to explain and of course many of us we know these things but I just want to kind of lay something out for those of us who have been sanctified justified and sanctified and fear with the Holy Ghost we are a different kind of a people we are a faith generation see even though we be Abraham's seed it is not by the natural man that's right it's only by faith Abraham who represented God was the father of faith and God toy for him that he was going to have seeds a man that will be in such a a multiplication of it that it will it would be like the stars of heaven and the dust of the earth look at Abraham's seed in the natural none of them could produce the promised son none of them as good as they lived no matter how they communicated with God they all failed they came short of the glory of God so Abraham C could not come into his position by way of the flesh it only could come into position by the weight of promise I love God because God keeps all of his promises no flesh could produce a perfect son hello so let me say it like this your flesh I don't care how well you think you are how good you think you are how perfect you think you are you are not perfect in your flesh you and I were born sinners brother Branham said we were born failures to begin with hallelujah so we need something more than a flesh right because the Bible says no flesh and blood shall enter into the kingdom now we're not that used to just get me like okay I'm going in the rapture how I'm gonna get there if I'm not going by flesh it's a different slash hallelujah because in heaven you don't need blood the only blood you ever needed in heaven was put on the altar and that's the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah in heaven you don't need breath you don't know that you're not breathing in heaven you're living the breath of the breath of life was only given to this dimension that's why the ages in heaven can hold a note without breathing hallelujah you've got to realize Amen that there's another body we must have take you to into that city you [Music] and I must understand that in order for us to come into this promise that God is for us we must have to say yes is that right see let me say it like this faith in what all of the word not some of it all of it and so so did you understand that when we come in this day this is why God left us without a physical man to lean on hello remember in the Garden of Eden oh they had was a voice and God worded it just like that the voice of God walked in the cool of the evening he could have described it some other way but he wanted to emphasize the vows because he's the Alpha and the Omega if he's a voice in the beginning he's a voice in here and you and I must understand that if Eve would have only obeyed the voice that's right not used her reasoning we would have never been up falling people right but because of her reasoning yes she disobeyed the boy device now you got to understand this fellowship with the voice the voice talked to them right there in the Garden of Eden we know who the voice he is hallelujah they talked with the Tree of Life [Music] hallelujah T it wasn't only the slurpin that who could talk it was the Tree of Life with the dog but we know wouldn't you like is hallelujah here's a voice of the scripture so that you could understand and we know these things but I'm just trying to give a prelude to what I'm trying to get to Laurie but there was no space and time there was God we know him as Elohim Elohim had thoughts of himself and in those thoughts he produce what we call words see we don't even think that words were thought but words were thoughts and God produced the word and he spoke the word hallelujah from that thought came a word and we realized the first word he said was what I'm sorry I said I didn't mean to set you up that's all right the first word he's saying what's Jesus he said well why you would say that because in the mind of God he had already slain the Lamb that's why Mary couldn't name him that's why Joseph couldn't Mamie Jesus had to name him we didn't know his name we only knew him as a word of God John said in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God that same word created everything and nothing was made without his medium is that right what was it it was God in warfare is that right you said why would his name be Jesus because the angel said he came and his father's name was a redemptive name that's why I was trying to tell everybody last night that your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation you learn not only was her name click there but you were saved you see and you want your delivered right can I say it like this God is I am so when I am is present God there is no evolution come on there is no evolving in God's mind he is and so are you oh come on summer but the fall because of it place us in what we call a time loop and you understand what time is time is given to us by God so that we won't receive everything at one time [Laughter] you see I'm saying he could've did all of this and say we put it all together and you and I would not have learned anything but he put us in time to know of him don't you understand the practice of God he wanted you to understand how much he loves you because the book is all about now I want you to understand that if you are thought in the mind of God and it is mine you were bribed nothing can take that away from you that right Paul said it like this what ahoo just separate me separate us from the love of God hallelujah nothing can separate us now we know by God's grace God sent us a prophet and we understand by God's grace that he was the man that could turn on the light cuz we had no idea on what the scriptures meant but it was his ministry not the man's physical but it was God is the man turning on the light is that right let me give you an example he was Abraham sitting out there in the cool of the evening right and a voice showed up as three men hallelujah and his voice said to himself listen shall I hide from Abraham what's about to happen you see what I'm saying that's a voice of Noah so shall the Son of Man be revealed because he's the saying he cannot change and God revealed what was going to happen to Abraham he must do the same to Abraham [Applause] this was given just prior to the burning of Sodom yes sir so if God sent a messenger to open our eyes that messenger had to come at a time when Sodom was about to burn see so you gotta realize that we the condition that we are in right now as we are in the condition of the world being destroyed by God and if if you've got there's an Abraham at the time of Sodom there must be a Abraham's seed y'all see them saying I'm trying to get you to see this cuz all of ours is just to begin me God's trying to get your attention understand too that in this condition in this agent we're living in your time my time is a time for the changing of the body because God was getting to this he was [Music] understanding neighbor Hamm's time there was a lot of distractions every time God told me for him to do something Abraham did just the opposite counted for me to you Abraham had the influence right of the various cities around and she that's problem we have the influence of cities working with us now that's why we can't focus on the very call that God has called us to God brought Abraham out of Babylon he did not intend from Abraham to go back to Beit Babylon but did not Abraham do it hallelujah he even went down amen and another king by the name of Abimelech and at that time [Applause] no y'all remember Noah don't you know was a simple man but in his day science ruled come on it's a joke and no one looks stupid cause he didn't wanna I pad and iPhone and I something he was just a little farmer he was believing God you see he was outside of the city can I say like that that's right because brother man said he'd built that on the top of a mountain what an inspiration nah you know where your Ark is built on top of the mountain so you and I must understand hallelujah that in his day he was simple he was different from the modern Christians hallelujah but he was at that time God gave him a message that was almost impossible to believe it's going to rain it had never rained before fire is gonna fall fire has never fallen before not all over the whole Wow you see why were you saying that brother so did you understand that's why the Corolla has hit every nation there is because God has judged the whole world and this power could be will be blasted with the fire of God hallelujah living in a time where everything that seems to look normal it's not it's abnormal went from a different city we're from a different country and listen God has made a way for us to hear the voice is that right remember when God brought Egypt Israel out of Egypt took him to Mount Sinai and God began to speak with the people the Bible said the earth shook the mountains shocked the smoke came down the fire went up and the people got scared shut up help me Lord you understand me oh don't let him preach like that no mom I'd only hear the voice of God like that hallelujah and from that to know God brought forth prophets who would have the voice of God is that right who would have listened because without a vision the people perish to an order to be saved in this day you've got to have a vision it can't be y'all it's gotta be a gosh hallelujah so in this time where you got to hear the voice and you know what people let me tell y'all something a lot of time you know when we say hear the voice everybody Minds go to brother Branham but you know brother Branham voice has been used it's on tape with the voice of God Young's to me because it's a voice in a voice you understand me but the voice must continue because when he lied to with off the scene Elijah had to carry the same message that Elijah had I get to in just a moment I just wanna jump I'm excited so I get it I may jump this we were born with the wrong mind we were born with the mind of the world and that's how we you know when you're not born against when you still love things of the world because the Bible tells us if the love if you love the things of the world the love of God is not in you hallelujah it doesn't mean that you're not predestinated to be bride because even Abraham was the chosen of God and he back slid you say he did not say he did in a man that would give his wife to another man to save his own self himself it's backslidden something's wrong with me oh come on is that right that's what the problem the God said he said that's what I love the Bible he tells the good and the bad and there was a father of faith but he'd made a lot of mistakes and I could truly say that the best thing that Abraham ever did was that he offered up Isaac hallelujah now i'ma tell you like this let this mind be in you hey y'all look at the thing when Abraham did when he offered a vows like it's something just karma well I don't heard this before and get on to something else [Laughter] hallelujah how many times y'all eat Syria the same Syria every day come on do y'all say come on Syria I want something different yeah you don't want me but anyway by God's grace let me hurry when we look at the Bible and that's what don't ever let this message become common to you you are dangerous grounds if the message become common to you you are in dangerous grounds you're like the children of Israel the manna got can't became common and when the matter became calm became common they began to complain and murmur y'all hear what I'm saying listen let me tell you like this if you steal exalting creatures to be great there is no great preacher you might as well be like a denomination and the organization right because whenever a man sheep define a name he's under the spirit of Babylon is that right because Babylon in the beginning said let us go make ourselves a name but if you are the seed of Abraham God told Abraham I'm gonna make you a name but it wasn't Abraham making himself a name it was God giving Abraham a name understand the difference he never went to make himself a name but God made him a name so let me move on it so I said this last week of Friday your head is not the temple the temple of God is in your heart it's in your soul hallelujah so God says stop thinking with the head and start thinking with your heart let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made of himself no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men hallelujah now you say what do you mean Brotherhood see you gotta understand that God didn't call you Oh sister brother Amen just to be common in the sense that oh I'm just a brother I'm just a man I'm just a woman Oh hallelujah because God is supernatural right and when you have been born again you're no longer just a man that's right you're no longer just oh you have become a supernatural being so is he if you think you just flesh-and-blood that's all you're going to be but when you know that you know that you know that you got God on the inside it changes your disposition it changes a way of thinking and your way of and what happens if all things become possible I believe that the Bible says know you not that you're the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you now Paul said if you don't know that you're reprobate right if you don't know that God is in you something has changed you somewhere you're allowing Satan to deform you at the same time that God is trying to transform you the temple of God him shall God destroy but the temple of God is holy which temple ye are this is what I was trying to tell the people the other day I said we're no longer in the day where the God will allow us to eat off of the tree of knowledge of good and evil we eaten off of it but he said listen you either make the tree good or you make it he separated it Oh hallelujah he understood that was a tree and here's a treat of knowledge and good and evil but that's for the wire but the tree of life eats only from the good tree which is the Tree of Life let me say you know just what I was saying yesterday I said you understand and people don't like this but I said anyway what happened when that rod got beyond the veil it buddy it blossomed and it brought forth almonds only the female can bring forth yes and God is trying to tell you something that he's placed you behind the veil though you are dead rod you were being used by God by Aaron by Moses and you didn't know who you were God was using you all along even when you didn't know you were pareidolia but he's not satisfied with that you've got to go beyond the veil [Applause] this is not a thing where you can say well please no you don't have a choice this is not a choice to stay outside of the veil with his death remember when Adam and Eve Smith the cherubim Seraphim whichever they were drove them out of the garden why because the Tree of Life was still there and he did not want them to live in that condition hallelujah but now the tree of life is saying to everyone whosoever will let them come okay I was read from the bottom but I'm gonna have a good time hallelujah this is the hour of the manifestations of the sons of God did y'all know that Oh like I said the other night that's why the world is falling apart because the sons of serpents that's right they don't have creative ability they don't have authority over nature that's why they get the dump trucks dig up the ground move the dirt Adam didn't have to do that sound of God is that right you said brothers that's not true yes it is jesus said if you say to the street move over yonder that we have to obey and so the whole of creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of what you want revival the revival but they cannot get in that position until you and I get into our nature want to work for you [Music] hallelujah ice storm was coming and I said no we want to have Church so I call the Saints I said let's pray and speak to that stone hallelujah guess what the storm was coming our way it spit up moved around us and you know what the newspaper said news people excuse me we don't know what happened we don't even know the reason why this happened we know the reason [Applause] was an example of that right he said I was he said that snowstorm was coming he said and I told those brothers go ahead of me hallelujah he said there was no way they could have gotten out of there if they would have moved too late he said but the storm was steady coming and I will study walking in it hallelujah somebody help me here but all of a sudden he heard a voice and the boss said can I walk with you hallelujah is that right but the boss told him speak to the storm that's all I'm saying it is your prophet in a secured bread is that you can speak it now oh come on Gentiles mr. children's bread better the prophet of God said didn't he say he said the Gentiles would would like a custom to lay in our hands he said that was a Jewish tradition hallelujah Hades all right but Garrett said you don't have to come to my house I'm a boss myself and I say to my servant do this do that they do it Lord Jesus all you got to do [Applause] that anointing will make you do it hallelujah therefore endure hardness as a good soldier hmm you gotta be everybody think you're gonna go sweep and do the city maybe after you come through your hardships but you suffer is that hey jesus said take up your cross and follow me there are so many people in the message don't even know what the cross he is never been the cavalry we come right to the message in art um you can't start back you got to start at the bottom to go up that's what's wrong with the people they get the message intellect and they ready for a rapture when their lives can meet up hallelujah true believers like I got five I want six and I can't afford it there were shoes right you know we must understand that's why God has to squeeze to come for you that squeeze gonna come and come for you and gonna strip you from everything hallelujah to the perfection of God that's God's love for me God's love for you and right now you need to learn how to hear the voice sometimes you some people don't leave you the boss except to be on the tape but I talk to God every day he talks to me every day y'all gonna hear God I see God every day all the lord have mercy let me say it again inhale there are no trees there's no sunshine there is no breeze there is no water there is no fellowship wherever God is there are trees young standing these fries the water did you know water lives even the water lives scientists has proven that water lives oh well I tell you well when God speak to it it rolled back it must have heard something [Laughter] huh so you said brother Bruce what are you saying I'm saying what people don't understand they say oh you don't appreciate it that's why the problem was a man who could see God in everything if I've said heaven and earth declare his glory he can see heaven and everything because he could see God God made that tree God made those birds to sing for me honey God calls the wind to blow on me when I needed a cool day that was God because when you don't want God now guarding will want you later the Bible said I got I got scripture he said I'm gonna laugh at your calamity because when I called you you didn't come when I tried to reprove you you didn't want to reprove when I tried to give you counselling you didn't have you didn't want the counseling but now it's my turn to laugh at you you laughed at me Oh Christian oh that's all it's gonna come a day the same people who laughed will be laughed at hallelujah let me move on you see we can look at these things in user but I don't have to drop I don't have to shout I don't have to get emotional no you know you really know you don't have to do none of that hallelujah it's like a man who never brushes your teeth you don't have to brush your teeth but their consequences that's all I'm saying you don't have to do nothing is that right but I enjoyed Jesus is that right so what do you brother Adam said it like this he said the old church never had to do exercise they got their exercise when they were in church and God he was not talking about meditation shouting dancing [Applause] [Applause] I'm coming just give me grace lord have mercy on us you must understand you got to consider like Paul said consider what I say you got to understand it meant that you have been placed here for a purpose God don't enjoy you being lukewarm the cool right you've gotta be on heart he's gotta be you gotta be fired up honey God goes to see the fire it's on you hallelujah you not have been called under the same inspiration you know you think about brother Balaam he doesn't witness in to millions of people and at the age of 56 of 55 hi I'm a walk and when he was caught up into the third heaven you know you know caught up in the heavens he said you know oh my oh my I'm getting old I better I better find some time to I better do something for God talk to myself lord where am I on the scale what fraction of number is that I don't even know it but nevertheless nevertheless the fire that burned in Elijah must burn in the light shop [Music] for the souls of men do our backs in faith the faith seed of Abraham you had Jacob Esau Isaac and Ishmael and you said what do you mean yeah Jacob was a product of Abraham so was he saw and they came out of the same womb out of the same church hallelujah had the same mama and the same daddy but one was chosen by God y'all see what I'm saying so everybody they claim to be message ain't message Oh somebody help me here T it helps me because when I go to churches and I look and I feel and I design what I'm working with I used to get discouraged I don't get discouraged no more because I realized by God's grace everybody it's not like they might be a Jacob but you know one thing about he saw he couldn't change that's right you can preach to him all day and he couldn't change but Jacob heard the message [Applause] though he was a shy stock though he was a liar though he was a thief he the lessons income to give you some kind of intellectual stimulation the lessons came to change you from water to immortality [Applause] we're on our way up hallelujah people say well I tell you what I got a bad temper cause my daddy had war you better get rid of it you've got to be born again I don't care what so here ready Tara traits from you you've got to be reborn you need a blood transfusion lated with the DNA of Jesus Christ is that right same lineage Abraham see brother Isaac and Ishmael y'all know the word but you got to understand it's something about those two seas of God that kind of like Jacob I don't care what it takes to get it [Music] wrong I don't care I was telling people worry about what thing about you they don't talk about you anyway you can stand right out there and be quiet and somebody gonna look at you said I don't you know I don't like that one you don't have to give people a cause to dislike you some people just dislike you to wait because the way you look so why should you care about the way people think about you David didn't think about it David is my reflection hallelujah he was a faulty man but he loved God you add a turn to whether term of the law is a [Music] felony to save me but guess what I'm saying hallelujah I'm gonna come from a quote here so you know I really do preach the message hallelujah coming from the word became flesh 1954 hallelujah I think I start here 276 every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laying in seed for that if we seed into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible brings the thing to pass wait a minute that's why you need Jesus cuz it has to be the same talk that's why you've got to have him on the inside did you know that the force of the Resurrection is in the bride and everybody said what abortion around oh you think you're gonna get in yourself as a Cathy cop saw the boss of a resurrection so we can understand is Jesus Christ s right Lazarus - he said I am the resurrection the resurrection when the force of the Resurrection is in the bride she has come to maturity hallelujah is that Alright I want to say to those you know young people who came up for the Holy Ghost don't let nobody tell you you don't have it that's the devil well I see you doing this and that well I see a lot of people who claim to get the Holy Ghost that they got the Holy Ghost doing this and that when did your flesh ever become perfect never until God changes it it's gonna cause you to stumble until Jesus come y'all hear me if the devil can make you think you don't have it either go Nam on you but when you know I got it because you gotta realize this thing is not saying I don't have to feel it moving at the first like Mary didn't feel it moving but down the road in the booth [Music] because is like is that right did y'all know that rocks can move oh yeah guess what rock and rock is actually made out of sand press together right hallelujah like the brother said Jesus Christ is to react and we're the stones and God calls us living stones and when we get together and we press together we form a rock and that rock is Jesus Christ [Applause] with a revelation of Christ we follow the rock of Christ amen and the Bible said it like this when the storm came when the winds blew and beat upon the house it fell not why because he had dug deep he wasn't shallow [Applause] [Music] because it was founded upon a rock hallelujah noctus the rock of who Jesus is but the rohnke who you are the revelation of who you are hmm god help me woo oh my god hallelujah you know I said to myself I said you know they don't they don't shout it out last night uh uh maybe y'all did but I I get a shout out and I'm gonna tell you something for us all oh I'm getting mine in mmm yes sir hallelujah the Bible says let this mind that was in Christ being you as a man thinketh in his heart so is he that's what I'm trying to get you over to this is your [Music] [Applause] Moses wasn't afraid of all the things that Moses is not afraid of the things that happened in Egypt Moses knew he was called by God and the children of Israel that was in Goshen were not afraid of the pestilence nor they were afraid of all of the things that would happen in Egypt and here his ease of is called the world I just preached the message the burden of Egypt why because they were attacked God dismissed all of those plans and everything on Egypt guess what Egypt never repented two to three months a month or so ago before the coronavirus hit the Holy Spirit work me up that one morning and any echo that in my ear I didn't even know what's coming my way he said I gave them space to repent and they would not the next income was a corona somebody help me here you see even 9/11 was a part God was trying to get America to repent but instead of repent and they puff themselves up and said we're gonna become greater you don't do that in God's face Harlan and God proved to the nation there's nothing now they won't feel God but they feel Corona nobody have seen Corona and nobody has seen God [Music] got the whole world shook up God say you don't fear me you gonna fear something Moses Noah Pharaoh didn't fear moses either but out the god constantly hit them with the blade he had to recognize to Moses said Moses your God is gone I got to hurry I'm too much time like God said let there be a world hallelujah before it could be a world it had to be a thought I'm on the 7177 I'm sorry so God in the creation created the world by he starts first didn't spoke it and thought Express became material let me say this you might not believe it but this is my testimony one time I was sitting there at the Panera not here but in I was looking out the window and there was a little whirlwind with a piece of paper whirling around in it like that and something said to my mind speak to that whirlwind and caused it to do this I did and it did it say speak to it again I calls it I spoke to and said move here move there and did it and then there was a third time the God the Word of God huh I'm like I'm not even conscious God is talking I'm just thinking and I'm doing this right not neither God and then you know it says calls it to move in the opposition of the whirlwind in other words a man however the whirlwind is swinging it that make it go the opposite way I said little piece of paper I said go the opposite way in Jesus name and it hesitated I'm like okay then all of a sudden the paper got up and started spinning I thought well that's pretty good I thought it was a real booster for the day God is our witness I wouldn't stand here and lie to you people I fear God and anyway I'm going down the road I've got my notes in my you know I know you know you don't spit on good times and there and you got your notes I've got

their time is she our baby gonna help spina bifida a believer and she's all worried and everything you know what now that really frustrates me I'm not saying I'm aware I suppose me but when I see a

the doctors told me I had cancer Teddy's gonna go to my bones and all that stuff what cancer right no he sent me the rattlesnakes are not sent them back to him [Applause] and they tell me you're healthy nothing wrong with you I say I know the baby I said don't you do that you better believe God when she have her baby that baby came out perfectly well what if she would have believed that the baby was fine enough God would have charged her for that ignorance yes the just shall live by faith [Music] [Applause] [Applause] this is where I'm coming in Roma's the fourth chapter quickly romans 4 1 and i'm gonna go down a little bit on this hallelujah i'ma try not to keep you too much longer can I keep him about 4 he said I preached 5 hours I think he said I'm gonna do that to you just give me a few more minutes ok but I'm trying to get a point and I haven't even gotten close to it but i'ma try to get it over to you I told my church we just only have one service now that means double trouble but some people don't bite me back because I'm too long but you know what that's the way it is at the dinner table when I get down to eat I just enjoy myself [Laughter] and my wife I say you want some mom day yeah put it on there please and she already done serve me a big plate hi there we have like old friend of mine she's a big girl she said she goes to the ice cream stands you said now listen I'm a big girl so then forgive me a big portion a big girl potion and they do [Laughter] a big man and your woman went up and they give you that little thing for like five dollars you gotta speak up you have not because you ask not she taught me a lesson know me give you the Lord they might not give you another scoop but they give you more even Romans the fourth chapter I don't mean to make it happen you know look at simple things that we miss out we miss out that's right don't we just open our mouths for things right growing with the fourth chapter beginning at the first verse what should I say then that Abraham our Father as pertaining to the flesh hath sound if Abraham was justified by works he had were up to glory but not before God she that's why God won't allow us did you understand in all of Abraham's ministry he never did one miracle he just believed God John the Baptist never did one miracle but because he had faith in what he believed in with regard himself his name is written in the Hall of Fame God will somebody to believe him are you gonna let my hair out do you oh right here in the city of Jericho believed that God had destroyed Egypt by way of Moses I think it may have been 40 years after then because the children Israel was in the wilderness for 40 years and seek out a second hand report and believe but she saw opportunity to get out of her condition [Applause] with Noah built the ark right but I believe I was a dad when Joshua thought a man against Jericho but I believe I wasn't there when they crucified Jesus I don't know what I'm saying there's a two side to that story I was there yet I wasn't y'all notice hallelujah but I wasn't there I believe it I know he was crucified for my singing I know there is no other God outside of Jesus I don't know how I know it other than it was revealed to me you know experiences travel in the DNA that's why brother I said I was there because he was in the DNA of Jesus Christ yummy so we got the whole eco [Applause] I didn't know when I was in him [Applause] but even ham was justified by works he went up to gory but not before God well for what say it the scripture abraham believed God and he counted unto him for righteousness now I want you to understand where he's going with this because some of us don't have the circumcision yet but God gave us the circumcision because we have faith in it right I said because you believe God is already accounted it [Applause] before he was circumcised [Applause] hallelujah but him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness that's why I didn't want to work you last night like he was laboring but the Holy Ghost hallelujah you were laboring just to get into the spirit is that right Hebrews says labor to enter into his rest because we're so common minded we have to labor some time to get spiritual that's what I was doing and when you began to glorify God when you begin to praise God when you begin to thank God all of a sudden God inhabits the praise of his people [Applause] [Applause] the name of Jesus Jesus shows up hallelujah I love the name of Jesus did you know that you know why I love the name of Jesus because if I said all heaven and earth is named now so when I say Jesus all heavens yes Lord did you know that they call on us they turn for our rescue the host of that you don't believe it it's true it's true those ages went down says law have you seen what was going down on down there in Babylon he said I already see that I'm already waiting you know what I'm saying yes one of them says oh can I go down there wormwood should I turn this world upside down just give me one just give me just give me the permission Lord God says no no no no no this is mine I'm coming down right so I'm saying this so you can understand like this he said in this day it would be heated up seven times that means it was heated seven times hotter just like the Son of man came in that day he comes in this day and stands in the fire no no trial no tribulation can separate us from the love of God [Applause] from taking the translation whatever is fall make it bring it to perfection let it have its good work and let me wait on it till I can see it hallelujah you love the Lord even David also also the excuse me describe the blessings of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without words God imputed righteousness without works did you know that did you know brother man said that is the bride that was the scourge of God saved me back that same scripture blessed is the man whom God will not impute sin yes I didn't even know this message at the time and then he took me to Psalms 103 about the blessings see that's why I'm always blessed some people don't like it but I'm always better you can't curse net-net God done blessed right sometime things happen to me I'm just I'm just like when my mom I shouldn't be at all but God be so good he's so good to me a man I shouldn't be that way he's always good to me hallelujah is that okay I'm telling y'all people this is a time to be happy [Applause] I've said Jesus Christ he faced himself his face like a flint he understood he had to go to Calvary yes with joy with joy hello he saw it as a joyful thing that God would choose him as a lamb and he couldn't turn back right no more than you can once God starts working you you can't get away even if you try all right hallelujah I want the devil hitters tonight this morning he think he gonna get you he can't get you right as Moses he requests God's Word I won't [Music] [Applause] blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin everybody talked about Jesus Christ but you understand why he came in view he said Jesus said listen he said I became your sin that you might become my righteousness my sizzle boom but you see me wearing is the righteousness of God you hear my [Music] brother say my garment is praising God I like that brother I'm taking it home to a man listen coming what the blessedness then upon the circumcision only or planning uncertain also for we say that we that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness how was it being reckon then it was he was in circumcision or uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of faith which he had yet being uncircumcised see what my word he had not even yet come to the sealing of God but in eyes of God he was already sealed yes hallelujah you love the Lord eleven twelve okay I got a pig what 11:30 Wow wonderful praise the Lord give me 30 minute window minutes y'all love the Lord and I see how much I like to eat I'll give you your second portion now hallelujah Isaiah 54 and five everybody ought to enjoy this good yeah yeah so I threw this in the double space all the time when you try to tell me I ain't this and I ain't that I said check this out listen to this [Laughter] [Music] fifth verse it says for that maker is dying husband the Lord of Hosts business is his name and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called hallelujah so understand their bow right my husband right you made you right so you can understand my position I'm in a higher order thank you [Applause] don't you see why the devil took Jesus up on the mountain cuz he knew that's where God like to dwell did y'all know that the New Jerusalem will be on the top of a mountain right when Jesus came down when God came down amen sat down on Mount Sinai he wasn't in the valley he was on the mountain that's why Caleb and Joshua said give me my oh [Music] [Applause] yes he will he will as soon as you get where you're going he's still gonna try you he tried Jesus yes but jesus said get thee behind me Satan worship our Lord thy God what was he saying and I'm your God you better worship me I'm not gonna worship you you worship he knew he was talking about and the devil knew he was talking about you can only worship God himself and you gonna watch something cuz I am God you don't think they'd ever heard him say that John 10:30 I my father one he heard him right hallelujah let me move on the time was now the life is now the time is now amen let me let me go to our trial 64 how are you paragraph 126 you love the Lord hallelujah I hope this is a blessing to you August and I can't help but there I

but I don't [Laughter] what is around that I love them all I'm live here too you know but you now must understand that this love of God this God that God loves us we didn't just happen to come here this was my land purpose it wasn't like the devil's planned parenthood see the boss of the scripture speaks and that's why you can't just dirty this like a newspaper come on you got to study this thing is in-laws speak to me I'm not the word that I can see it then I can understand hallelujah and God will come in and will quicken the word to you hallelujah yes she will but you gotta talk to the

like that you go hold on this is awesome hey man let me stop me go ahead oh I feel brother camera P a little bit you know so either look the voice of the scripture speaks this afternoon that this is the hour this is the time Sodom and Gomorrah and all the other things are setting just the way they were supposed to be setting if they were we would not have had a profit warning we would not have had a vault we would not have known that the world is soon to come to an end we wouldn't know everything like things have know people partied in mérida gave me they had children and everything in the flood still came so will it be in this day it's not gonna stop the word the word will be vindicated [Applause] amen before the devil could kill Jesus oh I'm gonna have to jump because my time is running out you understand me remember this might go back to Moses he's the seed of God he's a raw your seed right and the devil has always tried to kill the royal seed right he he was so glad that Cain killed Abel Abel was royal right right he thought I got rid of those holy rollers now ah does it not so the planning finish [Music] [Laughter] he Herod the Pharaoh excuse me went and killed all these trying to get to one and the world is going to do the same thing again they gonna slaughter a lot of Christians trying to get to the bride available see that the bride was already but they did not know God was there sitting there looking and said to Joseph in a dream there's something coming they're gonna try to kill Jesus so you got to go down to Egypt come on did you think it was a hop in a script skip he had to give up in the middle of the night human and marry with that baby and they went down to Egypt traveled all bees away because God had another prophecy out of Egypt will I call my son hallelujah and every time the devil tried to kill my real Krishna I even did it to the church agent and everything else but this one this bride of Jesus he won't get his hands over let me move on see and where you are showing through the wrong seed of Abraham that you live and the Son of Man is being revealed in this day of Sodom have a heavenly Father grant that the people will see and when they come by that they will take God's Word just like Abraham did no matter what a weird hallelujah is all right listen what the devil did he thought okay he saw there was an angelic visitation with Joseph with Mary excuse me so he he said oh I'm on North Joseph dang we'll let him see this one and she gonna she gonna say well you know Joseph I'm pregnant Oh surely you love me Joseph don't you who did it no man Joseph you understand me I'm just saying think about the brothers it look like I've got crazy up here I mean he had to feel that way he felt like a man in a man but he loved us all he want to put away uh privately that was that he was going stoned her God had to intervene that was the devil's inspiration using the very scripture because all Mary had to do was slip - Isaiah's and a virgin shall conceive and I'm that virgin hallelujah but the devil had to be the prize phosphate God said not this one hallelujah he's escaped Helen he's escaped heaven and he's gonna escape you to Joseph I see tell them saying y'all don't understand how God protects us day by day by day by day evil is always around us and you and I don't have no idea what God is doing for you people scared of the Quran when all them other germs out there [Applause] I'm almost done brother I'm sorry I do talk too much but you gotta understand bringing down chuckles I'm really I'm bringing down the clothes so you understand what what's happening now you and I were with him in the Battle of Michael and Lucifer did y'all know that we were there we took crisis sighs we don't remember it but we did hallelujah and and because we stood with him then he's standing with us now because it was always God's will to talk toe-to-toe multiply and fill the earth with sons of God but because of the fall it broke the chain and the earth was filled with sons of Adam and when Adam sons died off this the earth was full of the sons of the serpent it was then God said I am going to destroy y'all hear me so as it was in that day so it is in this day the sons of God are few right small in number they put the population of the world other side puns and God says I am going to destroy the world again but what the devil didn't know that from the day of Pentecost God has been populating and collecting all his subjects for the new world [Applause] because babies hated by the fall there will not be the babies over there that's why we grow up into the statue of a perfect of a man every child that guy goes up and they become an adult before God you don't know that hallelujah shoot'em shame not packing us away the whole time but after the world is burnt over everybody every son and daughter that died in Christ come back the shopkins the bound four thousand [Music] [Applause] it will be no stains no no ugliness I'm sorry but there won't even be cakes in heaven if they are they're going to be different kinds but just not gonna tell them brother Jake sound like cake you know just like our challenge s brother Jesse I said you know what y'all don't understand about me eating need is a decree degrading eating me can't before the fall after the fall oh y'all love me oh don't give me no vegetables you gonna have him over there [Laughter] it won't be no eating no me no slaughtering of no animals let me tell you something before the fall I don't know what those vegetables taste like but they were better than me they were better than me you can eat grapes and don't have to worry about cavities [Laughter] shame cuz all of those demons you don't know them demon cause the rotting of a teeth or two let me go on I could go home they don't stuff like that but the truth of the matter is we won't need a toothbrush so says you won't need no comb your hair won't get tangled how I must die you want it you can get it Supermarket either whenever you want to change your dress over here it sounds like a fairy tale but it's real really is real you said well I don't know about that we remember when when when when Ella Hill came to visit Abraham he stepped into the dust he stepped into the dust he stepped into it and it was cold so Michael in his angel is over again America the spirit of a heaven and and Jezebel's the spirit of what hallelujah so America is allowing Jezebel to rule her that's what the whole situation is all about she's calling in her property this whole Wow it's gonna be ruled by her an America a ham is gonna do her duty to dues hallelujah but because of that we are the ones that I in battle right we're battling right now well we don't win the wall we don't lose the wall we win it [Music] so you said what are you saying brother oops now I'm getting to it that's why I'm gonna have to cut it so I that's why we're brother banner I'm just gonna I got the court but I'm just going to use brother Ben was sitting on a stand and a half kneeling on the mountain up there Oh something a sword hit his hand y'all remember the story and and and the Holy Ghost says and brother and said it was so real so real he said the Holy Spirit said to him this is the keen sword right you don't have a sword if there's not a battle the sword was given for the battle hallelujah and then he comes along he ties the sword into the revealing of the seven seals the opening of the word Amen he ties the sword in there and then he gives you the sword you didn't know was a sword but this is the sword the Bible said that the Word of God is the woman amen is in birth she's carrying a child and before the enemy could get to her she gave birth to the child before the enemy can get to you and me God is giving us birth that's why the priest the message brought pains because he knew the problem is my pains and then God gonna give her birth because the enemy come after you [Applause] into the wilderness that's why we can't be no coward soldier right one more scripture and imma let you go yeah [Music] revelation please first chapter I'm not gonna preach us of three three verses and I'm
