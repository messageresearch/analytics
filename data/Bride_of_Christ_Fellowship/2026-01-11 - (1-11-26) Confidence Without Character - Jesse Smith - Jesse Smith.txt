TRANSCRIPT
========================================
taught on uh integrity. So, I hope that was a blessing by God's grace. Today, uh we'll look at this thought. I've never preached this thought before, but it's a very familiar topic. Uh I kind of remembered when brother McBride preached a sermon called a false sense of security. I don't know if you remember that one a couple years ago, and it was basically about Matthew chapter 7 with the workers of iniquity. I have a similar thought today. I think it's a good thought as we prepare for the Lord's supper with uh with feet washing of course to follow. But my sermon for today is called confidence without character. &gt;&gt; Because this group that we're going to read about has confidence in God, but they don't have the character that's needed. Now, church, we want confidence with character. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, let's read 1st Samuel chapter 4 verse one. 1st Samuel 4:1. Is the live stream on, Malca? Okay. Thank you. Was it on during the song service? Okay. No. All right. So, I was just looking for a text from my wife. As you're turning there, 1st Samuel chapter 4, we want to uh also recognize we had the birthday girls last week, Eden and Virtue. Let's give a round of applause. Amen. Hallelujah. Our January birthdays. Hope girls had a good birthday by God's grace. Uh my wife's birthday is coming up on Friday, so look forward to that. Uh by God's grace. And there's a couple more January birthdays. Who am I forgetting? I think brother Patrick has a January birthday and Victoria has a birthday coming up, right? So, we want to pray for our birthday friends in in the body of Jesus Christ. Ask God to bless their next year of their lives. Hallelujah. So great to have another year to serve the Lord. 1st Samuel chapter 4 verse one. I'll read one through four and then we can read uh verse five together by God's grace. Now, this thought came to me this week. I was reading uh I got done with 2 Samuel. So I went back to 1 Samuel. I kind of read the the Bible backwards. I start with Revelation and I go forward because I love the book of Revelation. So I finished 2 Samuel. Then I went to First Samuel. And I'd forgotten about this text. It's a beautiful text here uh by God's grace. Verse one says, "And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle and pitched beside Ebenezer. And the Philistines pitched in Aphek. And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel. And when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines. And they slew of the army in the field about 4,000 men. That's quite a loss. And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us, that when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies. Now, this sounds really good, doesn't it? It sounds like if we just get the ark of God and bring it here, God will save us. &gt;&gt; But they're going to find out a hard lesson. Just because God's ark is with you, just because you have the word, that doesn't mean you're going to get the victory, &gt;&gt; right? Verse four. So the people sent to Shiloh that they might bring from hence the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts which dwelleth between the cherubams. And the two sons of Eli, Hoffne and Phineas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. Let's read verse five if we can. Ready? 1 2 3. And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout so that the earth rang again. May God add his blessing to the reading of the word. You can be seated here by God's grace. So I like to preach on confidence without character. That's the negative side of it. The positive side of it is confidence with character. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what we want today as we approach the Lord's supper today. We want to have confidence in God because of our Christian character. Hallelujah. Now, if you remember, uh I'm not going to read all these verses, but if you read verses 6 through 10, the Philistines hear Israel shouting all the way across all those miles. It's such a loud shout and they get afraid and they said, "Well," they said, "Quit you like men. Let's be strong." Remember, that's what Paul told the Corinthians, right? Quit you like men. In other words, be brave. Be brave men. Be strong. Don't be cowards. That's what we need today. Hallelujah. Brave men. Hallelujah. Brave women. Well, they went out to battle. And if you read in verse 10, and the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent, and there was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel, 30,000 footmen. So, you have 4,000 uh in verse I'm sorry. Yeah. 4,000 that fell earlier, right? Uh yes, in verse two. And then here in verse 10, you have 30,000. So 34,000 Israelis died. And church, we wonder why. And if you wonder why, you'll read, we'll read later on, you'll figure out why. It's all because of sin. If sin is allowed to stay in the church of the living God, then bad things are going to happen. There's going to be no victory. &gt;&gt; No matter how loud people shout, no matter how much noise people make, and we're going to show the other side. No matter how quiet you are, if you don't have the character of the Holy Ghost, it's not going to help you at all in your battles. &gt;&gt; So, Brother McBride had preached this thought a few years ago, a false sense of security. So, I thought this was a very similar thing when I read this this week. I read it before uh work. I thought, my that reminded me of Brother McBride's sermon. So, notice they had a shout, they had emotion, but they had no character. It's because of idols, as you'll see. It's because they had sinful leaders. &gt;&gt; It's because the people were self-indulgent, partaking of the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes. They were doubleminded men. Now, do you remember when I preached last year on the double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways? I think I preached five sermons on that last year. And Eli was one of the examples that I used because Eli would tremble. Imagine every time the ark came around, he would tremble. He'd actually be shivering because he respected the ark so much. But then he was overweight. He didn't treat his body like a temple of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And as we'll see, he let his sons continue living in sin. He didn't correct them the way he should have. So he was double-minded. Sometimes uh when the prince of God was there, he'd be real fearful. And didn't he treat He treated Samuel pretty good, didn't he? There's another good thing. And remember, he spoke the word to Hannah and said, "You'll have this baby that you're praying for." Amen. So, he had some good things. He was when he was minded on the Lord, he had some good things. But when he wasn't minded on the Lord, he had some bad things. Like his two sons, he never really corrected his two sons. And then he w he was overindulgent with the with the food that he ate. He didn't take care of his body. &gt;&gt; And somebody come up to me one time, now this person doesn't come to church anymore. Uh but after I preach that they come up to me and they said, 'Brother Jesse, you were preaching on me uh with the double-minded sermons. And I said, 'Yes, that's true. I said, 'But I was preaching to everybody in the church. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "The reason we come to church is to find our weak points." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Ram said, "The pastor is to study and find weak points in the church and try to help the church." And church, if you listen to those sermons, I put myself in there. I sometimes I'm double-minded. We're all double-minded. Amen. &gt;&gt; And but I told that brother, I said, "That was my love for you. That was my way just to try to help you." I said, "But all of us are double-minded at times." We all need grace. &gt;&gt; Who else remembers who I preached on? Remember Peter? &gt;&gt; Now, how many want to be like Peter? My hands up. I want to have faith. I want to have the Holy Ghost. I want to I want to uh have the keys to the kingdom. Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, see, I was preaching on everybody. I'm helping everybody. Right? The preaching is for all of us. The preaching is a sword. Everybody gets cut cut with a sword. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But also, everybody gets healed by the balm in Gilead. Everybody gets healed by the anointing oil. &gt;&gt; That's right. The word always cuts, church. It cuts all of us. Brother Ram said that's why we study to find the weak points. He said that's why you come to church to find your weak points that you can make them strengths and become a better Christian. &gt;&gt; So yes, I preach on myself. Hallelujah. Church as a preacher. And now you wouldn't know if you're a preacher, but you would if you're a dad. You as a dad, you got to teach or mom, you got to teach your children the things, but sometimes you fail in those areas as well. &gt;&gt; Does everybody understand? &gt;&gt; At some point, all all of us at some point are going to try to help somebody learn something that we struggle with or we're battling. &gt;&gt; Didn't Paul say he said good's right there, but sometimes when I want to do good, evil's right there, too. and I don't choose the good and I do the thing that I hate. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, wretched man that I am, but thanks be to God." Amen. Who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, church, you remember Matthew 7:21-23. Let's read it because it's one of the most uh powerful portions of scripture. I've seen YouTube videos and people say this is the uh ven you might have heard it. People say this is the scariest verse in the whole Bible. Now I I agree for the unbeliever or I say for the makebeliever but not for the true believer. &gt;&gt; Matthew 7:21. This is of course speaking of the wheat and the tears. This is the Judas group who is lost because they were workers of iniquity. They did not work righteousness. &gt;&gt; Now church, you remember the church age book. Brother Bam said, "How do you know you're accepted before God?" He said, "Look at your works and go do the right things in God's eyes, and then God will accept you." It's that simple. If you're not obeying the Bible, repent, obey the Bible, and then God will accept you if you do the works of God. &gt;&gt; It's that simple, church. Let's not make this uh spiritual algebra to this degree. God accepts us if we're repenting of our sins and then we're trying to walk in obedience and do the right things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, you know the verses here, very familiar, but let's read them. Matthew 7, I'm sorry, in the wrong chapter, 7:21. Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter in the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven. So, God help us to find the will of God. &gt;&gt; Now, uh a precious family member of mine recently asked me how or or no, he didn't ask me. Uh he just said, "I want to know that I'm in the will of God." And I said, "Well, I've got a good chapter for you." In my 2021 book, I have a whole chapter on the mystery of God's will. Remember church, God has a sovereign will, which nobody can ever change, right? &gt;&gt; And then, friends, God has the will of God in the Bible that he's made known to us. &gt;&gt; So, this is called the known will of God. But then what there's something Brother Ram calls the progressive will of God which is you finding out what God wants you to do as you live your life on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's already it's already determined right in the sovereign will of God. But we don't know it. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, brother Chris, that we work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. Oh, there it is. That's good. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That means as you're trying to find the will of God, you're trembling before God. As you read the Bible, say, "God, help me to make the right choice with my marriage, my job, my finances, the gifts in my life. If if I move, do I move here or move there?" You tremble before God and say, "God, just help me to make the right choice." &gt;&gt; Good. Great question. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. &gt;&gt; So, see, that's why Christians, as Christians, we shouldn't just say, "Well, I'll do this or I'll do that." We should make sure we ask God first. Then we know God's will because we've trembled in God's presence and God sees our sincerity. We're trying to do what's right. &gt;&gt; But look, the workers of iniquity didn't do this. They didn't do the will of God. Now church, a lot of you are doing the will of God. You come to church, you pay your tithes, you worship, you sing, you pray. Those are all things we should do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That those are good things. So you can know I'm doing the will of God today. Hallelujah. Now, make sure you do the will of God the rest of the day. Then you see then then the devil can't beat you up about it. &gt;&gt; Cast down anything that exalts itself against the word of God. As we said, our verse for 2026, or at least my verse was uh Psalm 16:8. I've set the Lord always before my face. I've set the Lord. He's at my right hand. Therefore, I shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; Nobody can move you, Brother Chris. I don't know why I use Brother Chris. Brother Jose, nobody can move you, Brother Jose. As long as you've set God before your face and you know you've done what God wants you to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. Matthew 6:33. And all these things shall be added unto you. &gt;&gt; So if you seek God first and say, put God's face before you and say, I'm going to do this because God's word says so, then God will supply all your needs. &gt;&gt; I've seen that with nine children. God just continues to supply for all the needs. uh some somewhere somehow money will just come out of some place and God will help provide the needs of my family which I give thanks for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Year after year, God is faithful. God is gracious and merciful. Now verse 22, many will say to me in that day, so this is this is an amazing scene here. Many will say, not a few, many will say, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name cast out devils, and in thy name have done many wonderful works. Then will I profess unto them, I never knew you. Depart from me, ye that work iniquity. So, this shows lots of things. Miracles don't prove you're a believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's one thing that the the church world just they have a hard time grasping that. It doesn't matter what miracles you do. Get the miracle of getting saved first and being a worker of God's righteousness. AMEN. GET THAT miracle first. That's the miracle that matters. Hallelujah. And notice Jesus did not correct them. Jesus didn't say, "No, you didn't cast out devils. No, you didn't prophesy." No, they did. &gt;&gt; Because the word always corrects. Jesus Christ always corrected Mary, Joseph, who his brother and his sisters. Jesus corrected everybody. The Pharisees, the Sadducees, the publicans, but he did not correct these people, these many people on the day of judgment because they had done the miracles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So friends, we can see this. We must do the will of God. We not we must not be workers of iniquity. Iniquity means lawlessness. In other words, I don't care what the Bible said. I don't care what my mom or if we're children. I don't care if what my mom or dad or grandma says. I'm going to do whatever I want. That's iniquity. &gt;&gt; Now, for the adults, I don't care what the Bible says. I don't care what the pastor says. I don't care what uh the evangelist says. I don't care what the deacon says. You know, with that type of attitude, that's iniquity. But remember, if you confess it, God even forgives all iniquity. Amen. &gt;&gt; You just don't want to work it. You just don't want to get into the habit of doing iniquity. You want to get in the habits of righteousness, a life of integrity. &gt;&gt; Glory. Now, you say, "Brother Jesse, is there a scripture that says confidence without character?" Yes. It's in uh Proverbs 14:16. So, if you got that, let's read that. I was ready to preach this Wednesday, but I'm like, "I don't got enough time on Wednesday night." Hallelujah. I need a full service by God's grace. Amen, church. A wise man fearthth and departs from evil. See, we're not workers of iniquity. &gt;&gt; So, the w I'll put virgin in there. The wise virgin fearth and the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; See, the wise virgin will leave the evil behind. &gt;&gt; But the fool rageth and is confident. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, did you see another Christian author fell this week? He's 8 78 years old and it just came out. He had an affair with a woman for eight years. Another one fell this week. Brother Ram said, Brother Ram said they drop like flies. Here's here's why they say he says they drop like flies. He said they start climbing up here, but then they fall off. So this man sold 15 million copies of Christian books, but he never got here because he committed adultery for eight years with his against his wife. Think about that. You can sell 18 million books, I'm sorry, 15 million books and still not have temperance. boy, he had knowledge. I read one of his books. It was a pretty nice book, but he never even got that high because he was a an adulterer. And the Bible said adulterers God will judge. &gt;&gt; So So friends, what am I saying? Make sure this year, this 2026, add to your faith. You've got faith or you wouldn't be a Christian. You add to your faith. Add some virtue to that. Right? Virtue. Hallelujah. And then add some knowledge, understanding. Then add temperance so you can control your sensual passions. And then add patience so you CAN BE PATIENT WITH GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And then ADD TO THAT GODLINESS SO YOU'RE LIKE GOD. YOU CAN LOVE your enemies. And then get brotherly kindness so you can love PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH. AND THEN GOD WILL GIVE YOU THE HOLY GHOST. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. That's right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That and that's the wise virgin. They depart from evil. But the fool rageth and is confident without character. That's what Israel was. THEY SHOUTED SO LOUD THAT THE ENEMY HEARD THEM MILES away and then 30,000 died. Church, you can have confidence without any Christian character. Brother Chris, &gt;&gt; we're going to get to that. Good question, buddy. You're getting to my punch line. Amen. That's great, brother. Good question. All right. Now, you see it now. Brother McBride called this a false sense of security. And I was like, "Oh, let me find some more examples of this." Matthew 7. Now before we move on, remember uh with this Judas Escari group, this is the Judas Escariat group that has confidence but no character. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now I preached a few years ago on this when brother William was here. 13 metaphors for the Judas Escar group. So the Judas Escar group will be shipwrecked. Their ships won't reach the destination. Now these are all Bible verses. &gt;&gt; Make sure your ship makes it to land. through the storms of life. &gt;&gt; They are they war against God. They're fighting a war against God. They're falling away or which is also a desertter. They're running away from their post of duty. That's why people run away from church. Fourth, they're offended or stumble. They stumble at the word of God. They trip over the word of God. Fifth, they're cut off or cast forth from the body of Christ. Sixth, they're cast away. Hallelujah. They're cast away. They lose. They they they go astray from their route and they're cast away. Seventh, they return back to Sodom. These are all Bible verses. That's what Judas did. He went back to the world, right? He sold out Jesus. Eighth, they had itching ears. Oh, somebody just come itch my ears and speak pleasant things unto me instead of these hard sermons that you preach. Number nine, they got hard hearts. Number 10, they crucify Jesus aresh. Number 11, they trample underfoot the son of God. They say, "I don't care what the Bible says. Nobody's going to tell me what to do." Number 12, they get entangled. So, they get trapped and entangled in the traps of the world. And number 13, 13, they get uprooted or plucked up by the roots. Now, church, that sounds awful, but that's not our destiny. &gt;&gt; Our destiny is our ship will not wreck because Jesus is in the ship. &gt;&gt; That's right. Our destiny is we'll war against the devil and we'll fight for God. &gt;&gt; I will abide in Christ because I've deserted the world. I've run to Jesus. Jesus is my city of refuge. &gt;&gt; God will keep my feet from stumbling. I won't stumble. &gt;&gt; That's right. I WILL REMAIN ATTACHED TO JESUS. HE'S THE BRANCH. And then I'll be gathered into his garner. I will stand every attest approved by God. &gt;&gt; I will stay out of Sodom LIKE ABRAHAM AND I'LL PRAY FOR THE LOTS THAT ARE IN SODOM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Like I was yesterday. Amen. Like you should pray for the the lots that are still in Sodom. &gt;&gt; My ears will hear what the spirit's saying to the church and I'll reject anything that's contrary. &gt;&gt; I will let the Holy Ghost write his word upon the fleshly table of my heart. I will crucify the affections and the lust thereof, and I will show forth the death of Christ in my life. &gt;&gt; I will let the Lord put every devil under my feet because you and I are the woman's seed. Amen. Hallelujah. I will let the Lord Yes, I'm sorry. I read that. I'LL REMAIN FREE from Satan's tangling traps, for I am free indeed because the sun has set me free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And number 13, are you counting? 13 is I remain planted in the word, growing up into Christ into all things, drinking of his holy water. And that's what we're drinking today. Hallelujah. It's not the wine THAT'S HOLY, BUT IT REPRESENTS THAT I'M DRINKING IN THE HOLY SPIRIT. I'M THIRSTY, SO I GET A DRINK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, and my thirst is quenched. I DON'T THIRST FOR THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Hallelujah. Now, let me do this balance here as I was as I was preparing. Israel had a shout but no character. But then there's times the people of God did have a shout and they did get the victory. Hallelujah. Now put up Acts 2:33. Malachi. Remember every person that's born again. I'm going to break into this thought here before I get to the main point. When you get the Holy Ghost, it's got to be something that people can see and hear. If you don't, you got to keep seeking God because you're off the scripture. Every person that was born again had some experience that they could see or hear. &gt;&gt; And brother said it might be crying. He said it might be shouting. He said it might be uh dancing. It might be speaking in tongues. It might be prophesying. But you whenever a baby's born, I've seen nine of them born. Every time a baby's born, you can tell something happened. &gt;&gt; There was no baby before. Now I see a baby. Now there's life. I saw a large I saw a large round uh stomach, we'd say, or belly. But now I see a baby here. A baby is crying. It's making noise. Help the baby. &gt;&gt; Take care of the baby. A new life has emerged. When you get THE HOLY GHOST, A NEW LIFE EMERGES. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Something happens. YOU GOT TO GIVE IT LIFE. I NEED MORE OF THE WORD. I NEED MORE of the scripture. I need more prayer. I NEED MORE WORSHIP. A NEW LIFE HAS COME FORTH. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. People say they're born again and don't feed on the word of God. It's very likely they're not born again because they're feeding on the things of the world. WHETHER IT'S POLITICS OR whether it's worldliness or money, whatever it is, if they're feeding on things of the world, they're not feeding on God's word. We have a right to question, are they born again? &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The real Holy Ghost when it falls, you can see it and hear it. &gt;&gt; And brother Bam said, "You must have an experience." Now, recently, I've got numerous emails from people around the world. I would say maybe three or four. I could be wrong. Jose probably can see him online, too. Uh because he comments on my YouTube videos. And recently, this question has come up. It's always about the experience. Brother Jesse, do I have the right experience? And I always say the same thing. You got to have some experience that people can see and hear. But recently, it just struck me and I shared it with these three individuals this week. I said, "Yes, make sure you have an emotional, supernatural, some type of experience where you're changed." But what struck me is that so many people are just focused on that experience. They're forgetting the life that should follow. &gt;&gt; Because if you read read the church age book, Brother Ram says the evidence is being in the word all the way. That's right. &gt;&gt; So the it doesn't really matter which experience you choose. Was it dancing? Was it shouting? Was it crying? Was it weeping? What was it? Was it at the altar screaming? What was it? THAT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER. JUST CHOOSE ONE OF THEM. I'LL say it like that. And then make sure YOU'RE IN THE WORD ALL THE WAY AFTERWARDS. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE THE LIFE OF THE WORD PROVES THAT WHATEVER EXPERIENCE IT WAS, IT WAS A GENUINE EXPERIENCE WHERE YOU WERE CHANGED. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I saw I saw the change when there was no Tulsi and then I saw Tulsi. I SAW THE CHANGE. A NEW LIFE HAS EMERGED. AMEN. NOW, she still gets sick and sometimes you get sick spiritually. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Bless her heart. I hate to see sick babies, right? We hate to see sick Adena, but she's good today. Amen. But you know, all the children, in other words, all the children are going to get sick. Ell's going to get sick. You know, it's really sad. BUT A NEW LIFE HAS EMERGED. PRAISE GOD. &gt;&gt; And we all struggle. We all of of we all HAVE PROBLEMS. BUT THE question is, are you growing in to a real believer? Are you in the word all the way? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or are you just into religion like Israel? They were just into having an ark without having godlike character. &gt;&gt; For us, it might be, well, I just if I just go to church, then I know I can have confidence. Well, church is good. That's part of it, but that's not all of it. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 10:24 and 25 says we should gather more and provoke one another to good works. WE SHOULD DO THAT MORE. SO, WE SEE THAT DAY APPROACHING. BUT THERE'S OTHER scriptures about praying and fasting and giving homes. There's so much more about forgiving. How about forgiving our loved ones? Praise God. &gt;&gt; How about that? THAT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT. IT'S JUST AS MUCH OF THE CHARACTER OF CHRIST AS ALL THE THINGS THAT WE NORMALLY DO. Praise God. &gt;&gt; But a person who's in the word all the way wants to do all the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now, let me balance this out. Like I said, there's so many people that, well, not so many, but there there's people that are so so focused on the experience. And yes, you got to have it. But what's more important is the life that follows &gt;&gt; because that proves whether your experience was genuine or not. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham's talking about the still small voice. How many remember that from Elijah? &gt;&gt; Now, God was outside. Brother Chris, he was outside in the thunder, the earthquake, the fire, and the and and the uh what was the other one? Uh the wind. Maybe the wind. God was outside. But God didn't speak through all that. Eventually, God came down and whispered a still small voice, "Elijah, what are you doing in here?" &gt;&gt; God made all that noise out there. God was in all that. But God, it's not how God was talking to Elijah. It was in that still small voice. &gt;&gt; What doest thou here, Elijah? What are you doing in this cave? Church, the Holy Spirit whispered to your heart, "What are you doing in this backsliding condition? Good. &gt;&gt; What are you doing? Lying, stealing, &gt;&gt; not forgiving, holding bitterness, &gt;&gt; committing sexual sin. That's what the Holy Spirit will say. Why are you doing this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why are you here? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what the still small voice of the Holy Spirit is. Now, sometimes it's loud, right? We know sometimes God spoke loudly &gt;&gt; and God does that. But, brother, I'm showing how there's different types of experiences. This one with Elijah was a still small voice. Brother Ram says, "Now the world can out entertain the church." The church is not an entertainment and not it's not supposed to entertain. It's supposed to preach a new birth that makes a new creature in Christ. &gt;&gt; Although I want you to smile and have a good time. I'm not here to make you smile. I'm here to preach the GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST SO EVERYBODY CAN BE BORN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. HALLELUJAH. I LIKE to see you smile. I I do want that. I I want everybody happy. Praise God. &gt;&gt; But it's not to entertain people. &gt;&gt; He said the world's looking for entertainment. Some social parties or some fantastic some sort. He says now it now look what brother says. It isn't always the noisy things that's great things. &gt;&gt; Now for us we got to be careful. It's not always the noisy services that are the best services &gt;&gt; now. Yet there are right? So it depends what God's doing in that moment. That's why I want to show balance to this. He says, "It's not the noisy things." Now, you remember this quote, Brother said, "A wagon." So, if you have a wagon, like in your garden, a wagon can go out in a field when it's unloaded, it'll bump and rattle and make a bunch of noise. Come right back over them same bumps with loaded with good things and it won't even make a squeak. Why? It's loaded. What the church needs tonight is to be loaded, filled with, guess what he says? The love of God. Amen. Hallelujah. That's what you AND I NEED. WE GOT TO GET FILLED UP WITH GOD'S LOVE. AND WHAT IS GOD'S LOVE? It's his longsuffering. &gt;&gt; It's truth. It doesn't rejoice in iniquity. HALLELUJAH. IT THINKKETH NO EVIL. PRAISE GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE LOVE OF GOD. AND THAT'S WHAT OUR WAGON SHOULD BE filled with. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, Brother says, "A wagon," and I've had these before. We don't have one anymore, but we used to have an old wagon. in it and it was wobbly and it would squeak, but then when you put things in it, then it it was nice and quiet, but you had to go slow or else it's going to tip over one way or the other. You got to be able to handle it. But he's saying an EMPTY WAGON IS LOUD MAKING ALL KINDS OF NOISE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE the love of God in it. Let's not be an empty wagon Christian. &gt;&gt; Let's be a filled up wagon Christian. &gt;&gt; How you feeling, Brother Jesse? Oh, I'm so full of love today. &gt;&gt; I can hardly stand it, Nia. I got so much love in my heart. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I walk slowly up to the altar. &gt;&gt; That's why I walk slowly in here. I shake hands and say, "God bless you." Because I'm filled with the love of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Hallelujah. And I'm shouting afterwards. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother uses another story from Palm Sunday when Jesus came into Jerusalem fulfilling Zechariah 12 on the colt, the foul of an ass. remember that. And brother Ram says, "And people might tell you we're just too emotional." Brother Ram said it isn't emotion. Of course, it is in one way. It is emotion. But anything that hasn't got emotion is dead. So if your religion hasn't got a little emotion about you, you'd better bury it because it's dead. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; "So, see, in one case, you can be so quiet and full of God's love. In another case, my man said, "IF YOU DON'T HAVE NOISE, YOU'RE DEAD." &gt;&gt; SO, what is it? Sometimes I'll have emotion. SOMETIMES I WON'T. BUT EITHER WAY, I'm filled with the love of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, you got to look at each case. Elijah didn't need noise because he was already in a depressed condition where he wanted to die. Brother Chris, &gt;&gt; he was asking God to let him die. &gt;&gt; Totally depressed, running from a woman, Jezebel, &gt;&gt; backsliding, we'd say. &gt;&gt; So, he didn't need noise. He needed to hear the still small voice. &gt;&gt; But on Palm Sunday, they needed to hear the noise BECAUSE JESUS, GOD HAD ALREADY SAID it a thousand years before. If you don't CRY OUT, THE ROCKS WILL CRY OUT. &gt;&gt; There it is, BROTHER JOSE. SO, SOMETIMES THERE'S TIMES OF NOISE FOR GOD TO BE PRAISED. OTHER TIMES, GOD WANTS TO DEAL WITH YOU in a still small voice in a quiet way because you're in a dark place. &gt;&gt; And if you're in a dark place today, you don't have to be. God can bring you into the light. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All it takes is confession. &gt;&gt; Cleaning out your life, purifying your life, and God can bring you back into the light. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says again, this is baptism of the Holy Spirit 58. You know, it don't take a lot of hollering. Amen. &gt;&gt; It don't take a lot of screaming. &gt;&gt; So, it doesn't take a lot. Well, then what would we say? Just takes a little. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says that's all right. Nothing against it. It's all right. It don't take that. It takes a submitted heart. &gt;&gt; Setting in heavenly places, feasting on the things of the spirit. Church, we got to enjoy the word of God. &gt;&gt; We have to enjoy this. And when we do that, then it really doesn't matter how loud you are because you're enjoying the word of God. Remember, we don't want to war against the word of God. Waring against the word of God, fighting against the word of God is actually a characteristic of the Judas group. &gt;&gt; It takes a submitted heart and that's what the spirit feeds on. Now look what brother Ram says. Does the spirit feast on emotion? He said, "Now listen, not all together. It brings emotion." He says, "So, let's balance that out. Sometimes the Holy Spirit wants you to give more worship." Give me an example, brothers. Yes. I'd love to. Remember when Jehoshaphat and Ahab's son came to Elisha and they said, "Give us a word of prophecy. We're going out to battle." What did Elijah, what did Elisha say? "Only because Jehoshaphat's here will I do this. But not because of Ahab's son." He said, "Somebody bring me a minstrel. &gt;&gt; Somebody go get a Somebody GO GET SOME STRINGS. LET'S START PRAISING GOD." AND THEN the Holy Spirit came on Elisha AND HE SAID, "MAKE THE VALLEY FULL OF DITCHES." HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO, he needed more emotion, more music, and then the spirit of God could work. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, see, there's times that we have to give the sacrifice of praise. We have to worship and get in the spirit and then God will pour out some blessing on our lives. &gt;&gt; So, brother Ram says, "Does the spirit always need emotion?" HE SAID, "NOT ALL TOGETHER. NOT EVERY TIME, but sometimes God wants you to put more emotion into your worship." &gt;&gt; Think about that. Remember, I preached on this last year. If you don't clap your hands and raise your hand at some point, you're backsliding because the Bible says raise your hands and clap. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It also says dance. So, if you haven't danced in a while, if I were you, I would just dance for God sometime to make sure I'm keeping the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But that DOESN'T MAKE YOU SAVED. BUT THE BIBLE SAYS, "LET THEM DANCE." HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said it's a season. It's either a time of mourning or dancing. You're telling me you're going to mourn every SEASON OF YOUR LIFE. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GET A DANCING SEASON? &gt;&gt; When are you going to get SOME JOY IN YOUR LIFE? WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GET SOME VICTORY IN YOUR LIFE? THERE'S GOT TO BE A TIME TO DANCE AS WELL. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY. AMEN. Like I danced a few weeks ago when we preach on the water and the blood. Remember that? I just like I just started crying. I'm like, well, usually when I start crying, that's usually a good sign I need to dance around the church. Amen. That's a good sign to me because God is working on my emotions and I got to let that out. I want to show God how much I appreciate his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the the blood and the water just became so real to me. And remember what I said? I said, I hope I remember that when we preach communion in a couple weeks. And here we are by God's grace. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit brought it back to my remembrance so I wouldn't forget. Now we're going to end with that in a little bit here by God's grace. Now I also shared these quotes. If you want to hear a good sermon on the Holy Ghost, listen to the fourth seal from Brother Brandham because the first hour, Brother Brandham talks about the baptism of the Holy Ghost. These are some of my favorite quotes. Listen what he says here. He said, "I know there's a lot of fanaticism and people carrying on." Now see, SO THE QUIET people that are normally quiet, they don't like to see people just carrying on and making noise. But brother says, I know there's that. &gt;&gt; He said, I know that. He says, and I know sometimes they do it when the music is jumping up and down and everything. I know how that goes. &gt;&gt; So brother said, quiet people look at look at people loud with music and they'll say they're just loud because they like to get loud with music. Well, guess what the loud people say? They're just quiet because they're backing on God, right? But then the the the quiet people can look at the loud people and say they're just putting on like they're just acting like it. But look what brother Ram says. Brother Ram said, "I believe that too." So Brother Ram believed him both loud and and and and quiet. &gt;&gt; He said, "And I've seen people as long as the music is playing, everybody was jumping and screaming. AND WHEN THE MUSIC STOPPED, it stopped." So, brother says, "I've seen people, they only get excited when the music's loud." &gt;&gt; Now, church, there's no music right now, AND I'M EXCITED. HALLELUJAH. WHY? BECAUSE IT DON'T TAKE MUSIC TO MAKE ME EXCITED. IT TAKES THE WORD BECAUSE THE WORD IS LIFE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RAM SAID, "THE SONGS JUST GET YOU OPEN FOR THE WORD," HE SAID. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THE PREACHING OF THE WORD THAT BRINGS LIFE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Songs will encourage you. Songs are just there to get your mind cleaned out, to transform your mind. So the word of God CAN COME IN AND TRANSFORM YOU. &gt;&gt; And brother Ram said, "As long as the music's playing, people are jumping and screaming, BUT WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS, IT STOPS." Now remember what brother Ram SAID. HE SAID, "THAT'S STILL ALL RIGHT AS FAR AS I'M concerned as long as the people lives right." &gt;&gt; So see, some people are more quiet, Sister Beatatric. Americans, I'll just say it like that. And then you got Africans. They're just naturally more into it, right? They enjoy the louder and the dancing. They'll dance every service. Is that right? They'll dance. They dance every And we just have to have a dance service just so to make sure people dance sometimes because we're just in different cultures, right? That that's what's expected in Africa. Well, this is what's expected in America. But brother says, EVEN IF YOU JUST EVEN IF IT TAKES IF IT JUST TAKES Malachi and Victoria to get you going so you can finally jump and praise the Lord. BROTHER SAID THAT'S FINE AS LONG AS YOU'RE LIVING RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; So if it takes music to get you emotional, get emotional. If you don't, YOU DON'T. JUST MAKE SURE YOU'RE LIVING RIGHT. Make sure you're a worker of righteousness and not a worker of iniquity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that a good balance by God's grace? Yes, sir. Now, Brother Ram's talking about the evidence of the Holy Ghost, and he says, "We must wait until the Holy Spirit's done something like in Acts 2:4 where the Holy Ghost came upon them and they spoke in another tongue." He said, "Not necessarily because we spoke in tongues." It doesn't have to be speaking in tongues. It could be not because we've danced or we got emotional or we shouted. So, you list four things. Any of these things are fine if you get the Holy Ghost, right? Because you just have to have an experience where people can see something happen to you and they can hear something happen to you. Cuz that's what happened on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's tongues dancing, shouting, screaming. He says until we're changed, until something actually happened. I don't care what form it comes in. Just so it happened. That's the main thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I I use this quote all the time when people email me about the Holy Ghost. I don't care what form you get the Holy Ghost in. Just get the Holy Ghost. And the main thing is have a have a experience where you know you were changed from that moment. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Now my testimony was again the day after I got married. So my wife married a man who wasn't full of the Holy Ghost. But the next day I got it. Brother Jose, I got something. Amen. Whatever I got, it's kept me this far. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And what was it? It was love. I just felt so much love. I weeped and cried. I shouted at the top of my lungs. I had my hands raised just for a few minutes. And then I shook hands with everybody. And I just felt so much love. I just wanted to love everybody. I can look back to that moment and say, "I was changed. I cried. I wept. I shouted. I praised God. Something happened. Everybody could see it if they're watching." Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But now I've got to make sure I live right. How do I live right? Seek ye first the kingdom of God and HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND ALL THESE things will be added unto me. &gt;&gt; Same for you. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, remember, Brother Ram says in the church age book, power without character is satanic. That's why 34,000 Israelis died. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They had the power of the ark, but their character was contrary to the ark. They were sinful. The ark was holy. &gt;&gt; See, they should have matched their character. They should have lived holy lives in order to get the holy power. &gt;&gt; Brother Random uses this. Malachi, would you put up Romans 8 17 and 18? How many want How many want to be joints with Christ? &gt;&gt; Think about that. You inherit what Jesus inherits. &gt;&gt; Joint heir. An heir is someone who gets an inheritance. If we're children, we're heirs. We have an eternal inheritance. Heirs of God and joint hes with Christ. And church, what what are some of those things? The white robe. Remember the white robe. We inherit a white robe as well. &gt;&gt; I'm pretty excited, brother Jose. One day I just only I got to wear is white. I got one garment. I don't have to change different clothes and match and mix. I just got one set of clothing. It's my glorified body. &gt;&gt; It's a white robe. I don't have to wonder what am I going to wear today, Brother Chris? I'm going to wear white. WHAT AM WHAT AM I GOING TO WEAR TOMORROW? I'M GOING TO WEAR WHAT? WHAT AM I GOING TO WEAR THROUGHOUT ALL ETERNITY? I'M GOING TO WEAR WHITE BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF SAINTS. IT'S THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I can't wait till I get that change of garment. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together. &gt;&gt; So the only way you get the white robe or you get an inheritance is if you suffer as a Christian. Now, I'm going to preach a sermon maybe uh Wednesday about many are the afflictions of the righteous. Now, your afflictions, Brother Chris, might be different from mine, Brother Vang. Yours might be different from mine, but we have many afflictions. &gt;&gt; And church, if you can just recognize I'm suffering through an affliction, if you can just recognize that and keep praising God through that, then you will inherit what GOD HAS FOR CHRIST AS WELL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be cont compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. &gt;&gt; Since I'm there, let me give you a preview for Wednesday. Okay, everybody ready? &gt;&gt; 1 Samuel chapter 1 since I was already in Samuel because this is for sisters. Chapter 1 verse 11. You think, brother Jesse, you know, and and I said this too. Our afflictions, the Bible says, are just light afflictions. &gt;&gt; Just light afflictions, right? &gt;&gt; But look at verse 11. What was Hannah's affliction? And she vowed a vow and said, "Oh Lord of hosts, if thou will indeed look on thee, what?" Affliction of thine handmade. Her affliction was she couldn't have a baby because the Lord had closed up her womb and then uh her husband's other wife. Imagine that sisters having another wife with you. You're not the only wife. You got a wife to compete against. Thank God we're in the New Testament. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Thank God we're not in the Old Testament days." And the Bible said and the Bible said earlier in chapter one that every year she would make fun of Hannah. In other words, she'd make her sore. She'd vex her. Oh, you don't have children. Too bad you don't have children, Hannah. Year after year after year. That was her affliction. Now, church, do we read of any other afflictions in her life? No. Even her husband's like, "I'm better you than 10 sons, honey. Imagine that. A husband so loving he treats you better than 10 sons." El kind of. Hallelujah. But church, if you can just recognize what's my affliction and if you CAN BE LIKE HANNAH, GLORY. SHE WENT DOWN TO CHURCH EVERY YEAR AND she started praying. Brother Chris, it wasn't it wasn't okay for her to be loud. She had to whisper. She was like, "Oh God, deliver me from my affliction." Eli comes around and says, "She's drunk. Stop drinking wine." And she said, "THIS AIN'T WINE. THIS is the affliction OF MY SOUL. I'M CRYING OUT TO GOD." AND THE SPIRIT STRUCK ELI AND SAID, "YOU'VE HAD YOU'LL GET WHAT YOU'VE ASKED FOR." AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. LOOK, QUIET PRAYER. SHE WAS QUIETLY PRAYING AND PLEADING TO GOD, "GOD, IF YOU GIVE ME A SON, I'LL GIVE HIM BACK TO YOU." NOW, how many would do that today? &gt;&gt; As soon as he was done weaning, which was like four or five years old, then I'm never going to see him except once a year I'm going to see him. How many women would do that today? Now, of course, it's hard to do, right? Unless you got a full-time pastor to church. We don't have that. We couldn't do it at our church. Amen. All right. Now, thank you. Now, brother Ram says these beautiful words. Unless we suffer with him, we cannot reign with him. &gt;&gt; Now, church, we complain about our sufferings, but you must suffer if you want to reign. &gt;&gt; In other words, let's say this. Let's say, I'm going to stop complaining. Ready? I'm going to stop complaining. Because you have to suffer if you want to rain. Don't complain about what's giving you the character to reign someday. &gt;&gt; Don't complain. I don't complain. Just reign. Hallelujah. Don't complain. Just reign over the afflictions that God in his wisdom has allowed to come to pass in your life. You have to suffer to reign. The reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering. Character is a what, church? Victory. It's not a gift. You know, brother Chris, we look at brother's lives and we can say, "Wow, my brother McBride, boy, look at the character. Go, God really blessed him with character." That's the wrong thing. Now, you put any person in there you admire. I admire sister so and so. Look at sister so- and so. Wow, God really blessed her with character. No, she suffered to get that character. &gt;&gt; So, see, that's why we don't got to envy anybody. We just have to recognize what affliction did God give me? Help me to suffer through it. Help me to glorify God through it. Not to get shipwrecked because of my afflictions. &gt;&gt; Not to sell out the gospel because of my afflictions, but to patiently endure them so someday I can reign with Christ. &gt;&gt; I don't know how these babies sleep through my clapping. Brother Vang, hallelujah. God give them a special anointing. I've seen it nine times. I still don't know how they do it. Praise God. I'm clapping and screaming there. Adena's sitting there enjoying her rest in the Lord. Hallelujah. God bless her. A man without character can't reign because power apart from charact from character is satanic. But power with character is fit to rule. Now I've been preaching 45 minutes. Let me see where I can close. I wanted to preach about an hour. Let me see. Okay. Now maybe I'll preach a part two Wednesday. So I had one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I had seven more examples in the Bible where people had all this confidence, but they didn't have the character before God. &gt;&gt; And so we know what God would do, right? God would let them fall because pride goes before the fall. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, this was the whole point I want to bring here. Uh, you got your Bibles? Go to Isaiah 66:1. And I'm going to look up that verse because that just struck me. Isaiah 66:1. Why can't I remember what verse that is? Oh, there that's okay. Philippians chapter 2. Okay, thank you. Now, bring it I'm going to bring this down to close. I'm going to go back to Eli. Like I said, I got seven other examples of people that were confident but didn't have Christlike character. Therefore, they failed. But look at Isaiah 66:1. Thus sayith the Lord, the heaven is my throne. The earth is my foottool. Where is the house that you'll build unto me? Remember, remember Solomon already tried to build a house. Like what good is that? What good is it Solomon building God a house if he if if we saw on Wednesday he went and married a thousand women? &gt;&gt; What good is building a house of God? And then remember, brother Chris, he built houses of worship for all the other gods. &gt;&gt; So what good if you're going to give love to all the demons? What good is building a house for God? God don't want that. God wants all of our love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so God's like, "What house?" This is already after Solomon. This is 200 years after Solomon. What house you going to build me? Don't build me stuff. Just be faithful to me. &gt;&gt; Right. Hallelujah. Yeah. If you want to build a church for God, that's great. But be faithful to God. &gt;&gt; Like recently, church, um I would say about three years ago, someone came to me and said the Lord told them to build a church. Listen church, they built a brand new church, but they never had a pastor set up. And so when they asked me about it, I said, 'Brother, you don't have a pastor ordained by another pastor. So you're outside of the will of God. I'm not going to come to your dedication. Now, all of you were invited. You probably don't remember. It was about three years ago, but you didn't see me go because it was against the plan of God, church, right? &gt;&gt; And now this uh this this it's just a little move. It started it's been going on for three years and now from what people tell me around there it's the church is dying out. So the point is what good is it to build a house if you don't follow the law of God for the house? &gt;&gt; It's good to build God a church. Don't get me wrong. God will bless you for that. &gt;&gt; But you need to obey the word of the Lord in the house of the Lord. And to this day, church, they still don't have a pastor. And you know what the brother, you know, the man who built it, you know, we had a preacher come in here and he told that brother, he said, "Why don't you just go to brother Jesse's church? They already got music and preaching and everything. Why would you build that church when you got Brother Jesse's church right there?" But he didn't like that. Which is fine. He don't have to come here. But look, look here. We can look back three years later and one church is dying. But look, church, we're still going on by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that church still isn't obeying the word of God. still doesn't have a pastor ordained by another pastor through the five-fold ministry. Oh, just so you know, brother Brooks's 70th birthday is coming up pretty soon because he's the pastor that ordained me. Okay, so if you want to wish him a happy birthday, it's January 31st. He's turning 70 by God's grace. Hallelujah. I didn't even get to my verse. Verse two. This is the verse. Now, I'm trying to bring this down. I've been preaching 50 minutes, so bear with me. To this man will I look. Who wants God to look at you? Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "Who wants God to look at you?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, you can take this verse today to God and say, "God, you promised you'd look at me if I did this." &gt;&gt; See, sometimes, church, we wonder, "Was God does God even see me? &gt;&gt; Where's God? &gt;&gt; God, why don't you show up in my life?" Well, this is the kind of people God looks to. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Jesse, I haven't felt God for so long. Do this. God promised he'll look at you. &gt;&gt; For all those things my hands have made, but to this man will I look, even to him that's what? Poor. That means humble and a contrite spirit. Actually got the Hebrew definition, too. Poor means afflicted, humble. There's the affliction. Many are the afflictions of the righteous. Who does God look at? God looks at the person that's afflicted, that's humble because of their trials. and of a contrite. Who knows what contrite means? Smitten, dejected spirit. Huh? You mean God doesn't look at all the people that are happy and confident, rejoicing and joyful all the time? Not all the time. See, people could just be putting that on. People like the denominations, they just pretend to have that and they disobey God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; But God wants to find somebody who obeys the word of God, who is humble and smitten. And what do they do at the word of God? Do they laugh at it? Do they joke about it? Do they tease with it? They tremble at it. &gt;&gt; That means they really take what brother Jesse's saying seriously. &gt;&gt; They're not just, uh, &gt;&gt; when are you gonna be done, preacher? Can we go? It's lunchtime. Now, most people don't do that here. Most people don't do this, but I've had in the years past when people leave and they accuse me of things. I've had just them roll their eyes at me and just look mean at me. You should see some of the faces I've seen over the years. So, I'm happy when I see happy faces. Brother Ram said it's the devil who's getting exposed when that happens. &gt;&gt; People get evil faces because they have evil spirits &gt;&gt; and then they leave and won't repent. That proves they have the evil spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. But see, what is the what does the what does the believer do? He's humble. He smoke. He smoked. Remember the Bible said they their hearts were pricricked. Brother Chris on the day of Pentecost. Their hearts were PRICRICKED AND SAID, "WHAT SHALL WE DO?" SEE, you know you're smitten WHEN YOU SAY, "GOD, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?" &gt;&gt; That's when your heart's smitten. You're poor and contrite. I'm humble. I'm afflicted. And I and my heart has smoked me. And say, "God, what do you want me to do?" And that's when you tremble at God's word. Now, would you put up there Malachi Philippians 2:12? This is the one that came to me while I was preaching. This is the New Testament version of it. Wherefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed. How many are How many How many are trying to always obey the word? &gt;&gt; Bless you. And not as in my presence only. Oh, how many try to obey it when the preacher's not around? &gt;&gt; That's I'm trying to do that, too. But now much more in my absence. Work out your own salvation with fear. And see, that's how you know you're close to God. When you'll tremble at the word and say, "I don't want to break one thing in here." That's when God will look on you. If you're pretending or just in a backsliding condition, God's not going to look on people like that. Is that clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a good fresh reminder for us, isn't it? &gt;&gt; And Paul, this is Paul. So Paul's agreeing with Isaiah because they're both prophets. So church, the question is as we go on and I'm finishing up here, the question is, what do you tremble at? Do you tremble at the pleasures of the world? Do you tremble at the news and my another war? Oh, what's going to happen to this? What's what do you what do you tremble at? Do you tremble at your husband or wife getting upset with you? Or do we tremble at the word of God? &gt;&gt; See, people tremble at all these things. All these things impact them. There's one thing that should tremble at us, and that's the word of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember, Moses could stand in the face of Pharaoh, brother said, because he'd been in the presence of somebody greater than than Pharaoh. I love that quote. Amen. That's worth quoting all the time. Amen. If we could just get in THE PRESENCE OF SOMEBODY GREATER than Pharaoh or our boss or even the pastor or the preacher, the evangelist, whoever made, the teacher, if we can just get IN THE PRESENCE OF SOMEBODY GREATER, then we'll tremble at the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, friends, remember, let's look at let's close with Eli. Let's go to back to 1 Samuel. We already there in 1st Samuel 1. Let's go back to 1st Samuel. Brother Chris, here's why uh they here's why they were defeated. That's a good question. Let's go to chapter Let's go to chapter two. Here's one reason they were defeated. They had corrupt leaders, brother Chris. That's why the Bible said a pastor must be blameless. Try to live si try to live as pure as you can to everybody. Hallelujah. At my job, here at the church, in my family, I try to live blameless. The pastor has to be blameless. &gt;&gt; Now, he's going to make mistakes, but he's going to confess them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But these leaders were not blameless. Look at verse 12. 1st Samuel 2:12. So, here we go, brother Chris. Now, the sons of Eli were sons of Satan. In other words, they they were they were serving God, but actually serving the devil. They're working for God, but serving the devil. And here's how here's why. They knew not God. And the priest's custom with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest servant came while the flesh was in seething with a flesh hook of three teeth in his hand, and he stuck it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot. All that the flesh hook brought up, the priest took for himself. So did all that sha in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came. Now, Brother Chris, they would offer a meat sacrifice, right? A lamb, bullock. They were supposed to put the fork in there and then give the the piece with with uh the biggest piece with all the fat on it. That was to go to God. But these preachers had come in there and they changed it. Now they put the the fork in there and they took the best food even if it had meat on. I'm sorry, fat on it. In other words, God wasn't getting the first part of the sacrifice. Man was taking part of the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They're supposed to burn the meat with that had the fat on it. And they were not to eat any fat. But now we know why Eli was overweight. &gt;&gt; He was eating the meat that had fat on it still too much, &gt;&gt; right? Because once you get sin, if you don't clean it out, it's just going to grow and grow and grow. &gt;&gt; The first time he did it, he's probably like, "Oh, is God gonna smite me dead?" And then next time it's easier easier. Pretty soon I'll take all I'll take the biggest choice of meat. Let me have that fat on it. &gt;&gt; Right? This is why they were sons of the devil. And not only that, look at verse uh 15. Also, before they burnt the fat, the priest servant came and said unto this man that sacrificed, "Give me flesh to roast for the priest, for he will not have sod and flesh of thee, but raw." And if any man said unto him, let not let them not fail to burn the fat presently. So in other words, these men were saying, "No, NO, LET'S GIVE GOD the the meat first." Then what happened? "And then take as much as I so desires." Then he would answer him, "Nay, but thou shalt give it to me now. And if not, I'll take it by force." In other words, I'm going to force myself and take this meat that belongs to God because I want the best pieces. And the man's even like, "Just give it to God and then you can have your choice." In other words, you can choose to meat before me, but just give God the first. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they're like, "No, I'm going to take it by force. I'm going to do what I want." Even though the word of God says, "Give God the fat first." &gt;&gt; Now, what did this cause? Verse 17. Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord, for the men abhored offering of the Lord. So, Brother Chris, because of their sin, everybody hated coming to church. Hallelujah. Now, we shouldn't feel like that. We should feel happy coming to church. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "If God's in your heart, you can't wait for those doors to open." &gt;&gt; And if I sin or any preacher, Simon, Cam, anybody, Brother Brooks, anybody that preaches here sins, you go talk to them one-on-one, face to face like Jesus says. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's that's the word of God. Amen. So in other words, our services should be should not have this. People should love coming to worship. &gt;&gt; Ah yes. Amen. Now go to verse 22. Here's the second reason. So the first reason they polluted the worship and the worship was man-c centered instead of God- centered. It was all about man, not about God. God didn't get the worship he deserved. Now verse 22 is sexual sin. Brother Chris. Now Eli was very old and heard all that his sons did unto Israel and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So these men, brother Chris, after taking the food, they say, "Oh, you got a beautiful wife. Let me talk to your wife over here. Let me get your number." &gt;&gt; And the Bible said they would sleep with them. There's my hour. So not only were they forcing themselves and taking away God's worship, they were also sleeping with the men's wives. Now, that also shows the wickedness of those women, too. Hallelujah. I can see I'm not going to finish this here, so I better uh So, Brother Chris, let's let's finish with this. 1st Samuel 7. Let's go to 1st Samuel. Actually, you know what? Go to go to 1st Samuel 4 first. Now, here's a story. Here's another story. after they lose 30,000 in 1st Samuel 4 um let's go to 13 1st Samuel 4:13 and when he came low Eli sat upon the sea by the wayside watching for his heart trembled for the ark of God and when the man came into the city he told it and all the city cried out so let me back around this so brother Chris we saw how early in the chapter 34,000 died they went out for another battle and the Philistines means took the ark away. Now, Israel don't even have the ark. And so, the man comes back and says, "Eli, we lost the ark." And Eli was trembling for the ark. Now, look, he trembled for the ark, but he didn't tremble with obeying the word of God. And the Bible said he fell over because he was heavy. He was obese. Look at verse 18. And it came to pass when he made mention of the ark of God that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate and his neck break and he died for he was an old man and heavy and he had judged Israel 40 years. All right. So because they were taking the meat he got heavy. He was now church this is the thing too. He allowed his sons to sleep around and Eli could have removed them from being priests. &gt;&gt; So he saw sin. That's another reason, brother Chris, he saw sin in the church and didn't take it out of the church. Another one, brother Chris, is that he neglected the ministry of God. In 1st Samuel 3:3, Malachi, can you put that up there? And he air the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep. So, brother Chris, remember we have the outer court where they kill the sacrifices and wash them. The inner court was the candlestick. Hallelujah. Also, the altar of incense and the table of shoebre. And then in the holiest of holies was the ark of the covenant. No, the burnt offering was in the outer court. That was the first altar. They called the the brazen or brass altar. So in other words, Eli had also neglected the holy place. He stopped lighting the lights. And God saw that. So see, he was breaking the word of God in so many ways. He wasn't faithful with the lights. He wasn't faithful with his children. He wasn't faithful with his health and the church said &gt;&gt; and he was letting his sons sleep around and also make the worship a disgusting thing or a hateful thing. They hated coming to church because it wasn't about God. It was about people getting money and getting the best food. &gt;&gt; Thank God our church isn't like that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, let's go to chapter seven. And I'm closing with this. hour and four minutes. Now, church, you know the story. Eli dies, Samuel grows up, and the first time they go out to battle when they got the ark of the covenant back. You remember what happens? It was the battle at Mispa and they set up an Ebenezer, that's why we sang that song, come thou fountain. Here I raise my Ebenezer. &gt;&gt; Now, let's see, church, how do they get the character with the confidence? Verse one. And the men of Kirjath Jereim came and fetched up the ark of the Lord and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill and sanctified Eleazar's son to keep the ark of the Lord. And it came to pass while the ark abode in Kirjath Jereim that the time was long for it was 20 years and all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord. See church, sometimes God gives you a long season to think about your ways. 20 years since 34,000 people died. Sometimes God wants you to wait it out and think about your mistakes. &gt;&gt; And Samuel spoke unto all the house of Israel, saying, "If you do turn unto the Lord with all your hearts," what's that sound like? Elijah shall come and turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers. Amen. &gt;&gt; THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH. HALLELUJAH. NOW, of course, it's not this is not Elijah, but we get the same idea. A prophet, SAMUEL WAS A PROPHET. A PROPHET HAS TO COME, brother V, to turn our hearts back to the apostolic fathers. Aren't you glad brother Ram came? Amen. Hallelujah. The assembly of God, Sister Beatric, THE ASSEMBLY OF GOD COULDN'T turn my heart back. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the message of a prophet could turn my heart back to the apostolic father. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY I'M here today. Amen. Because God sent brother Brandham and then faithful men preached. It's brother Ram's Bible based message. That's why we're here today. &gt;&gt; Now, here it is, brother Chris. The the last one that I'll show. Then put away the strange gods and ashtrath from among you and prepare your hearts unto the Lord and serve him only. And he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines. So what' they do? Verse four. And the children of Israel did put away Balam and Ashth and serve the Lord only. So, sexual sin, greedy preachers getting fat, right? Huh? &gt;&gt; Sexual sin. Not taking care of the house of God, letting the lamps go out. &gt;&gt; Eli not taking his sons out of positions of leadership. And now we see the next one, Brother Chris. The almost the rest of the entire nation had idols and they were bowing down and worshiping other gods. &gt;&gt; Like today, they bow down to worship to the the gods of Ohio State Buckeyes and Cleveland. of Cavaliers and Cleveland uh Indians and Cleveland Browns. Right, brother? &gt;&gt; Or they bow down to the I'm gonna be a millionaire someday or now it's billionaire. I'm gonna be a billionaire. And they bow down at the gods of money &gt;&gt; or I got to have sexual sin. They bow down at the altar of a sexual sin. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And God said, "You're not going to get victory living that kind of a life. If you want confidence, let's have the character of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's the last one there, brothers, sisters. Now what' they do? Verse five. And Samuel said, "Gather all Israel to Mispa, and I'll pray for you unto the Lord." See, now that you repent and get the sin out of your life, now the preacher can pray." And they gathered together to Mispa and drew water and poured it out before the Lord, a drink offering, and fasted on that day and said, "There, we have sinned against the Lord." And Samuel judged the children of Israel and Mispa. And when the Philistines heard that, the children of Israel were gathered together of Mispa. The lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines. But now the church, even though they're afraid, now they've got character. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because now they're not bowing down to sexual sin, riches, right? Cares of the world. They're not bowing down to these things. Although they're afraid now they've got confidence in God and God's servant, Samuel. That's right. And the children of Israel said to Samuel, "Cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines." Does that remind you of anything? Pray without ceasing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pray without ceasing. They're like, "Samuel, we've confessed all of our sins. NOW YOU JUST PRAY FOR US ALL THE TIME." &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Verse nine. And Samuel took a suckling lamb. Does this surprise anybody? and offered it for a burnt offering holy unto the Lord. So we have water and we have blood. &gt;&gt; Water. Pour out water. Fast. Pray. Blood. &gt;&gt; Blood's forgiveness of sins. &gt;&gt; Remember I showed you water represents cleanliness. The washing of water by the word. Water came out of Jesus side. Blood came out. Blood represents atonement, forgiveness. Hallelujah. And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But the Lord thundered. Oh, we got seven thunders here. Amen. Which are the revelations contained in the seven seals. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines and discomforted them. And the men of Israel went out against Mispa and pursued the Philistines and smoked them until they came unto Bethar. What's the difference? The difference was they've got the sin OUT OF THEIR LIVES. NOW THEY'VE GOT CONFIDENCE WITH CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'VE CONFESSED ALL MY SINS. WE GOT THESE EVIL LEADERS REMOVED. WE'RE SERVING GOD. HALLELUJAH. WE GOT THE ARK OF GOD. AND NOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET BEAT UP BY THE PHILISTINES. NOW WE'RE GOING TO DEFEAT THEM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And church, you don't have to get defeated by besetting sins. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You and I don't have to be defeated by besetting sins. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen. &gt;&gt; Put away any besetting sin. Go to God. Look to God and God will look to you and then God will give you the victory &gt;&gt; because you have confidence with character now. That's right, church. Blood and thunder. Hallelujah. And then church, after the victory, what did Samuel do? Verse 12. Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mispa and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us." Let's stand to our feet. musicians can come. Now, this is why I chose to sing that song. Come thou fountain of every blessing. So, Haven, put that verse up there.
