[24:54] trust me a blessing to you today by
[24:57] God's grace this is what I thought I'm
[24:58] going to preach this morning
[24:59] then I believe like me like I said this
[25:02] one who the Holy Spirit kind of led me
[25:03] in that other direction it was really
[25:06] nice to see people searching seeking God
[25:10] praise God very happy about that
[25:12] so acts 2 verse 1 very major Scripture
[25:18] he's kind of one woman read that first
[25:21] verse let's all read that one three one
[25:24] two three and when the day of Pentecost
[25:27] was fully come they were all with one
[25:29] Accord you want to play saving this is
[25:32] power heads from work prayer get on your
[25:34] heart not how many Father
[25:38] we're gathered in this place we're in
[25:40] one place enough Lord as we are many
[25:43] times are just our desire Lord our one
[25:45] desires to be in one Accord God being
[25:48] one harmonious nor to action in one
[25:52] harmonious mindset Lord God that we
[25:55] would all desire the same thing dear God

[26:11] we're standing on the battlefield for
[26:13] our Lord we're serving in the Lord
[26:16] loving to do it faithfully Lord that
[26:18] posted due to you given to us up was
[26:20] Jesus to be found faithful give you all
[26:23] the glory honor Jesus Christ
[26:26] god bless you Benson you're doing
[26:37] Malachi in switchover buddy I got some
[26:40] let's go to some hotel and share this is
[26:43] part 17 I just want to reiterate some
[26:47] things I was saying this morning just
[26:48] for the home Church continuing to pray
[26:53] and so forth there come can you pray
[26:56] asking God that he could make us more
[26:58] prayer warriors you know that's what
[27:01] they had next chapter 2 they had a
[27:03] prayer they were real prayer warriors so
[27:06] we want to believe if we preach the word
[27:08] and receive the word it will turn us
[27:10] into the word and I just want to preach
[27:13] on this with one Accord in one place I
[27:15] thought I'd preach out this morning but
[27:17] that people interaction so remember I
[27:20] just want to go this again I know I've
[27:21] gone over this numerous times with our
[27:23] vision without the vision we perish and
[27:26] that literally means in the Hebrew a
[27:27] divine prophecy without a divine
[27:29] prophecy we're going to perish like for
[27:33] example think of the foolish virgin or
[27:34] denomination they're all claiming
[27:37] different prophecies but which one is
[27:38] the one that they should be kind or
[27:40] claiming it's the one that we believe
[27:42] about the coming of the Lord in the
[27:44] rapture
[27:45] yet I don't churches that don't even
[27:46] believe in a preacher relation of action
[27:48] have to go through the tribulation and
[27:50] be saved because they're looking at the
[27:52] Jewish Scriptures or looking at the
[27:54] foolish virgins cursors so they're not
[27:56] even sure they think they have the right
[27:58] divided prophecy but we have the state
[28:00] the Lord on the right prophecy and
[28:02] that's again what I'm going to keep
[28:04] bringing this up with Joel 226 church
[28:06] the Spirit is going to bring us right
[28:08] back to where they were to be good right
[28:11] that's the state the Lord so the
[28:14] beginning was what we read in acts 2:1
[28:16] they were praying they're all one Accord
[28:19] in one place you ever see that that's
[28:21] the beginning got to get back to
[28:22] everybody Prague in one Accord not worry
[28:25] about what sure many more where's or
[28:27] what but soon I got on today or what
[28:30] shoes you got on the day you don't come
[28:32] in here worried about anything else we
[28:34] just got one for right and that's to do
[28:37] the will of God brother Brandon said the
[28:39] same thing in the pick up your pen and
[28:42] write the last days the true church
[28:44] bride comes to the headstone will be the
[28:47] super church is that how we see
[28:50] ourselves right now super in some ways I
[28:53] can see myself I can see how I live
[28:55] compared to other people I can say my
[28:57] that's super was that by my works it's
[29:00] by Christ but in other ways I think well
[29:03] I like I believe we can do more I
[29:05] believe you know we can heal to God more
[29:07] as she nears the great headstone they
[29:10] will be much like him so much like him
[29:13] even they will be in his very image in
[29:16] the order to be united with him that's
[29:19] quite a statement church they will be
[29:21] one they will be the very manifestation
[29:23] of the word of the Living God so see now
[29:27] remember brother Han said the spear
[29:28] wrote this he to write this he said the
[29:30] spirit wrote it so we could go back
[29:32] again the particulars right back to the
[29:35] beginning one two four one place and
[29:37] would be so much like Christ will be in
[29:40] his very image and what was his image
[29:42] brother Graham tells us he had the mind
[29:44] of Christ in other words he never did
[29:46] anything that except to please the
[29:47] father and the Bible said that he did
[29:51] everything that please the father so
[29:53] we've got to come back to where all of
[29:54] our server services all of our songs
[29:58] everything we do please is the father
[30:00] I'm going to be that
[30:01] and I just kinda want to iterate that
[30:03] because really Church you know I hope I
[30:06] can say this the right way really um you
[30:09] know the this is this is a group right
[30:12] here that's going to be here the most
[30:13] right and so we have a responsibility if
[30:16] you come on a Sunday night you really
[30:17] gotta love God or have you know less
[30:21] children or something like that yeah uh
[30:24] because we're having a less Drive but
[30:27] then it was since money as the longest
[30:28] drive so she's putting her faith right
[30:30] out there in the front lines thank God
[30:32] for that but the point is the people
[30:36] that have come here every service you
[30:38] know and live stream every service or
[30:40] trying to watch every service they're
[30:42] the ones that are really going to help
[30:43] the church move forward everybody
[30:45] understand when upset and I just want to
[30:49] reiterate this again and just encourage
[30:51] you by God's grace that we have to be so
[30:54] much like it but we have to go back to
[30:57] the beginnings that's why we keep saying
[30:58] gotta go to keep focused on the Holy
[31:00] Ghost and the Pentecost and all these
[31:03] things and we got to be so much like it
[31:05] until we we do the very works of Christ
[31:07] now so I just want to get a few quotes I
[31:11] guess I'm trying to tie myself don't go
[31:13] too far cuz I didn't like this but I
[31:15] just keep losing track of time and
[31:17] having such good times huh
[31:18] I'm going to believe us now this 1950
[31:21] how beautiful is that Holy Spirit are
[31:23] sustaining strength to carry the church
[31:25] on if they fail to eat manna they died
[31:28] and if we fail to eat on the Holy Ghost
[31:30] we die if we fail to break through daily
[31:33] all the time keep under the blood you'll
[31:36] wither up and die
[31:36] your Christian experience have you seen
[31:38] people do it of course unfortunately we
[31:40] have is the burdens and reminds there
[31:43] were programs on these poor people but
[31:45] they're the ones choosing to die they're
[31:47] choosing to wither up rather than walk
[31:49] in the light right stand in the light
[31:51] and our friends as well so they have
[31:53] better cost when our man was poured up
[31:55] while they were all gathered in one
[31:56] place is one according was it argue
[31:58] whether they were Methodists Baptists or
[32:00] Luther they were in one place and one
[32:03] Accord expecting God to keep his word
[32:06] now we can learn from that right we got
[32:08] to find which scriptures apply to us and
[32:10] then
[32:11] other and pray those scriptures like I
[32:14] said earlier with Joel chapter 2 in
[32:15] different ones or if it's a healing
[32:17] service we got to pray mark 16 like we
[32:19] prayed this morning by God's grace we
[32:21] got a gather and pray for that because
[32:24] they were expecting God to keep the
[32:26] promise that he'd given in Luke 24:49
[32:28] this is the promise they are praying for
[32:30] Terry you for in the city of Jerusalem
[32:32] of here and do with power on high for
[32:35] when the Holy Ghost is come upon you
[32:37] you'll be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem
[32:38] Judea Samaria to other parts of the
[32:41] world so I just want you to see
[32:45] understand that there again I know you
[32:46] we know that I just want to remind us of
[32:49] that they were gathered praying and they
[32:51] were believing that this scripture
[32:52] they're pregnant sir and praying Lord
[32:55] bring it to pass and that's what we can
[32:57] do tonight as we can do every service
[32:59] Lord and if you have nothing to pray
[33:01] pray for remember the prophecies that we
[33:03] have for our day Lord restore our East
[33:06] or save the Lord restore the power Lord
[33:09] let your spear who lumps us bringing
[33:10] sinners back to repentance we always got
[33:12] things to bring for a man I think we
[33:14] just get in are we just going to bounce
[33:16] with the enemy we sometimes forget what
[33:17] to pray for but they had expectation
[33:20] they knew jesus promised it and then God
[33:23] blessed it and that's what we need to
[33:25] expectation and then Jesus will bless it
[33:27] amen a hundred twenty people I've
[33:30] gathered together upper room waiting for
[33:31] their sustaining straited and all of a
[33:33] sudden there came a south and heaven
[33:34] like a rushing mighty wind it filled all
[33:36] the house where they were sitting cloven
[33:37] tongues appeared upon them I went to the
[33:39] streets let me tell you something right
[33:40] now Virgin Mary and then was right among
[33:43] them that's right if God wouldn't
[33:44] respect the Holy Virgin Mary to get to
[33:47] heaven any other way besides her see the
[33:49] Holy Ghost woman he said what about you
[33:52] that's right you have to pay the same
[33:54] price which is neat sacrifice get the
[33:57] same experience have the same thing they
[33:59] had back here at the beginning where I
[34:01] tell you when the power of God begin to
[34:02] fall they lost all dignity and
[34:04] everything else I went to the street
[34:06] staggered like drunk men filled with the
[34:08] Holy Ghost
[34:08] Peter says the promises under you your
[34:10] children that lets afar off even
[34:12] Minneapolis Minnesota as many as the
[34:14] Lord our God shall call so even after in
[34:16] Ohio Amen brother I'm telling you very
[34:19] bad that will pay the price will step
[34:21] off for Christ has the right to
[34:22] see the baptism now something you make
[34:24] up an original like felt the beginning
[34:26] like the end of the day of Pentecost
[34:28] hallelujah
[34:29] he said you're going to call me a Holy
[34:30] Roller out so you might as well get used
[34:32] to them all right now the next one was
[34:37] from once more Lord he's closing the
[34:40] service and he prays for that same Holy
[34:43] Ghost out for him what's more lower we
[34:45] messed it up we've organised you broke
[34:47] up our Brotherhood we separate our
[34:48] fellowship we took a little group over
[34:50] there or fight with one another the
[34:52] devil sit back watch us whip one another
[34:54] down Lord is it possible that once more
[34:57] than all hundred and twenty of us to be
[34:58] one Accord in one place
[34:59] is it possible at their cover sound from
[35:02] heaven as a rushing mighty wind once
[35:04] more Lord once more he said less into
[35:07] our feet and say once more Lord once
[35:08] more
[35:09] Oh Lord God hear me Lord once more Lord
[35:12] once more sudden the spirit upon this
[35:14] camp meeting in power and in glory
[35:16] everybody I'm streaming this on the tape
[35:18] he's God it was the last time you
[35:21] screamed that when was last time I
[35:23] screamed that it's got to be a real
[35:25] hunger that's what I'm saying we got to
[35:27] pray to God to give us a real hunger for
[35:29] once more it's got to be a hunger you
[35:31] can hear him screaming in it closely
[35:33] with people shouting and screaming it
[35:34] really crying out to God it was good to
[35:37] hear our sister cry out you know this
[35:38] morning you know I'm here just real
[35:40] sincere don't you like that and all the
[35:42] ones that came up for prayer on where we
[35:44] lose everyone who's praying in their
[35:45] seats we appreciate that
[35:48] but it's got to be a one accord it's got
[35:51] to be the one desire of our hearts now
[35:54] I'm here I'm going to skip it to acts 4
[35:56] where the Holy Ghost fell again I'm
[35:57] going to skip out of here they gathered
[35:59] with their people they all pray with one
[36:01] Accord and pray in the will of God and
[36:03] coated the scripture why do the heathen
[36:05] rage and the people imagine a vain thing
[36:08] that's from Acts chapter 4 when they
[36:10] prayed the Holy Ghost shook the place
[36:11] that's the kind of meeting we need can
[36:14] you say mid that that's what we have to
[36:17] get we've got to have brothers you got
[36:19] to have it we got to have it let's be
[36:22] fortified by the word of God by the
[36:24] Spirit of God by the power of God amen
[36:28] I can say I can just say honestly I've
[36:30] never heard on action rushing win
[36:32] I've never actually felt an actual
[36:34] shaking maybe some people have
[36:36] talk to people that said they've seen
[36:37] the pillar fire i person ever felt it or
[36:40] seen it but i felt such a holiness that
[36:43] i cried and wept and danced and screamed
[36:45] and shouted and and shook until i could
[36:47] hardly stand it anymore
[36:49] so what we're saying is we just got to
[36:52] get back to one more guy yes and that's
[36:57] what we need that's the kind of meeting
[36:59] we need that's what we got to have it we
[37:01] got to have it
[37:02] the truryde will have it now here's a
[37:04] few hinges I want to just read again but
[37:07] Madison if you have a resenting audience
[37:09] so someone that doesn't like the
[37:10] preacher right unfortunately I have to
[37:13] deal with that sometimes he said the
[37:14] Holy Spirit won't even reveal you've got
[37:16] to have something to work it together
[37:17] there won a place in one Accord and when
[37:20] there came a sound from heaven Russian
[37:21] no matter how much I pray I'll a day and
[37:24] I study pray before the Lord walk down
[37:26] here maybe don't you love me walk up
[37:28] here for that resentment it just grieves
[37:30] him right away he won't reveal nothing
[37:34] but when you walk down here under the
[37:36] anointing and fill your audience under
[37:38] the anointing that's what the Holy
[37:39] Spirit begins the work then and he
[37:41] begins to move and do great things for
[37:43] us so we see that so an endurance is
[37:47] resenting anybody and let me just say
[37:49] this church there's a lot behind us that
[37:51] maybe you're not aware of but that's one
[37:54] thing I think we all need to grow up
[37:55] with I myself if somebody's sinned
[37:58] against us or hurt us we need to go talk
[37:59] to them to their face as soon as
[38:02] possible I just think that's that's a
[38:05] mature Christian jesus said that's how
[38:07] you fix the problem go to them face to
[38:09] face I think you know just by talking
[38:12] and fellowship with different people
[38:14] different churches I think that's true
[38:16] for every church problems we got to take
[38:20] them right to the individual you know of
[38:22] course after prayer want the right
[38:23] spirit you know but see just a little
[38:26] resenting just a little resented of a
[38:28] person no matter how much anointing he
[38:30] had just a little resenting upset with
[38:32] somebody will cause the whole service to
[38:35] be messed up and remember the type is a
[38:36] to remember again I don't have the
[38:37] quotes up here but remember that's akin
[38:39] one man got out of order and it caused
[38:41] 30 people to die right and then they had
[38:44] to God had to swallow the family the
[38:46] earth notice awful things like that but
[38:49] my manager says we're
[38:49] responsible in the same way for that
[38:51] we're responsible so that's that's one
[38:54] thing I wanna pray for I'm right now a
[38:55] few things you can pray for IDN I'm
[38:56] going to try not to be long but just
[38:58] pray that we can do Matthew 18 because
[39:02] that's a real mature Christian I want to
[39:06] make this a little time of Prayer - all
[39:09] right yeah here's that quote I mentioned
[39:11] this morning well the man sent a few
[39:13] nice Phil in Phoenix I preached on a
[39:14] Sunday afternoon where there's divisions
[39:16] and men wouldn't hardly speak to another
[39:18] I seen around 200 ministers better
[39:20] walked out of the altar shake with those
[39:22] hands by over one other shoulders and
[39:24] say they never fuss or be different with
[39:26] one another get let that great Church of
[39:29] God take that attitude tonight and I'll
[39:31] show you the revival of sweetness nation
[39:33] and tear down every nest of Hell there
[39:35] is rather we can preach to our horse and
[39:39] I've done it I've done it you know my
[39:41] fault and our lungs fall out until the
[39:44] people make a move
[39:46] you'll never do nothing that's right
[39:48] we've got to make them move and believe
[39:50] it rather than do it tonight do it
[39:52] tonight stand up for the word stand up
[39:54] the Living Word of God God will
[39:55] manifested amen so we can never to
[39:59] understand that story people were
[40:02] holding grudges and the Holy Spirit
[40:05] wouldn't move until they started acting
[40:07] upon the word we've got to act upon the
[40:09] word and just in the littlest things and
[40:13] I just R this is my thought in the upper
[40:15] room the unity of the laity and the
[40:18] preachers conquered Satan I like that
[40:23] because they are full of II into the
[40:25] word and all passion about the same
[40:27] thing say it always wants to conquer the
[40:29] lady right but here at the day of
[40:31] Pentecost which is where we got to go
[40:33] back to the last image the preachers can
[40:36] conversate hey man I like that like I'm
[40:40] the Holy Spirit turn that around I never
[40:42] thought about that till yesterday or in
[40:44] our study we got to turn that around and
[40:47] we got a conquer Satan by being United
[40:49] in Christ amen here's a Greek word for a
[40:53] quart one Accord it's one night with one
[40:56] passion with one passion now those are
[41:01] going to say this
[41:02] I don't know that record I can't say
[41:04] that homo or homo foo my god I don't
[41:07] know is it come out of two words meaning
[41:09] to rush along and in unison the images
[41:13] of almost musical number of notes are
[41:15] sounded which modify harmonizing pitch
[41:17] in tone as your instruments of great
[41:19] concert under the direction of a concert
[41:21] master so the Holy Ghost blends together
[41:24] the lives of the members of Christ's
[41:26] Church amen
[41:27] so I try to study harmony yesterday on
[41:30] YouTube that was really hard so if I
[41:31] confuse you forgive me but I looked up
[41:34] melody and harmony melody is just like
[41:36] Bing Bing you know thing lardy's weather
[41:40] altogether Dean there are all different
[41:42] pitches and they're all together and
[41:44] that's what it is what a core we're all
[41:47] sounding out to God in other words wrong
[41:49] manifesting Christ at the same time so
[41:53] it's not well just you know our sisters
[41:54] are annoying going here but our brothers
[41:55] we've got evil spirits on us you know
[41:57] more
[41:57] we're upset it's got to be all of us
[42:00] together again that man with what all
[42:02] the same times what crying out to God or
[42:04] you know getting into the sphere
[42:06] worshiping praising God don't you love
[42:09] that feeling Internet I love I love
[42:10] during when I'm solely dirty when I'm
[42:12] not from something back there we have a
[42:14] song leader I love like an you can
[42:16] almost hear it like the people are just
[42:18] under expectation what a core don't you
[42:20] love that oh wow that's what about
[42:22] that's what the most hopefully you feel
[42:23] it in the world to know that these
[42:25] people are hungry and God is going to
[42:27] use you to minister to them oh this is
[42:31] what we desire this is what we want to
[42:33] always have the harmony all of us
[42:35] sounding out God's praises you know
[42:37] sounding out expectation sounding out
[42:39] faint at the same time amen nobody skip
[42:42] ahead a little bit I guess I want to try
[42:44] to keep it short I was comparing the
[42:47] Upper Room to brother Mannis little room
[42:48] on the third Pole but I'm going to skip
[42:50] past that yeah if some of this is a
[42:54] little bit repetitious but please bear
[42:55] with me leave it's important always want
[42:59] to respect one another honor one another
[43:01] and above all things honor God in his
[43:03] house this is what I've been saying the
[43:05] last few weeks you know as a pastor you
[43:08] see I see people come in and out in and
[43:09] out in and out in and out but those who
[43:14] really love God
[43:15] churches they're number one don't get me
[43:18] wrong they serve God at home too but
[43:21] they put the church and the worship
[43:23] above everything else and that's a
[43:25] program set honor God in his house but
[43:29] everything else
[43:30] amen I'll be honest I got six kids six
[43:33] kids they could make a lot of messes
[43:35] sometimes my house is in order when I
[43:38] come to church anyway I don't have time
[43:40] to clean up everything I do you know the
[43:42] children help me they do a great job
[43:43] they all kind of everybody they're such
[43:45] good workers they be so much force but
[43:48] what I'm saying is that some people
[43:49] could say well I would have to be late
[43:50] because I got to wash the dishes you
[43:51] know before I got I could say that - I
[43:53] got folded I didn't get time to this
[43:56] does happen every time but if I've got
[43:59] to make a decision is my house in order
[44:01] or I gonna get the church to study and
[44:03] pray I've gotta put God's house
[44:04] Christian got to do that and got to UM
[44:07] and then when I get home and I'll clean
[44:09] up yeah then I'll get to that and don't
[44:12] get me wrong we should be praying at
[44:14] home and studying I understand that
[44:15] that's what I'm saying but this is a boy
[44:17] this is what brother Han lived he just
[44:18] didn't preachy he left it but God's
[44:21] houses love everything that I want to
[44:25] remind you this like I said I don't know
[44:26] which brothers might be preachers in
[44:28] here would I don't know but this is the
[44:30] reality of the fivefold ministry God
[44:31] fortified I mean he strengthened his
[44:33] army with what himself in the form of
[44:37] prophets apostles Act teachers I'm
[44:39] fighting with them in their pastors what
[44:42] do you do what was God doing listen do
[44:44] everything with the officers of the
[44:45] churches it's God's dress inside dress
[44:48] and a possible profit for see before st.
[44:51] never gets to it doesn't own it what is
[44:53] it God dressed up in his church that's a
[44:56] very humbling thing to say but when I'm
[44:58] going to the Holy Spirit is God dressed
[45:00] up in me you believe that
[45:01] and any preacher for the Sanyo brother
[45:04] Brooks whoever it is and any preacher
[45:07] that's anointed by God God is dressed in
[45:10] them he had God stepping in our shoes
[45:12] you know figuratively he's really not
[45:14] salt
[45:14] you know but he but this is nice when
[45:16] remind us of this the fivefold ministry
[45:19] is so crucial to this art your your part
[45:22] in our church is so crucial everybody's
[45:24] part here is so crucial that we come
[45:26] friend come with one passion and
[45:29] if I'm preaching God's Word and God is
[45:31] with me now like this if that office
[45:35] denies any of this word then it's not
[45:37] God's dressing thing no that's a wolf in
[45:41] sheep's clothing and I don't want to be
[45:43] a wolf that's why I say if I ever make a
[45:44] mistake that's why I came out of those
[45:45] half sheets today please come correct me
[45:47] if I'm making a mistake if I ever make a
[45:49] mistake
[45:50] please come tell me I don't want to
[45:52] mislead God sugar amen
[45:53] I want them to be right with God just
[45:56] like I want to be right with God he said
[45:58] watch that fellow beware of a preacher
[46:00] that denies the word but remember when
[46:03] he just takes what the word says
[46:05] remember that's God does he speak in his
[46:08] word
[46:09] that's why I love to just preach God's
[46:11] Word because I know it's God even not me
[46:17] here's the one about the pastor Graham
[46:20] said get religious questions in your
[46:22] mind I bind you to ask your pastor not
[46:24] me that's because that's why in the past
[46:26] I've asked certain people I don't think
[46:28] anybody here in the in the past I've
[46:30] asked people you know please don't ask
[46:31] other pastors questions like when we go
[46:33] out to eat it's not time to act like
[46:35] with the guest Minister is that time to
[46:37] ask your mother Brooks all of our
[46:38] questions now if you have a question
[46:40] about a personal experience like you
[46:42] believe his gift might help yes ask it
[46:45] when you're asking them doctrine what do
[46:46] you believe about serpents eat or what
[46:48] you believe about this with that and if
[46:50] it's because you're disagree with me
[46:52] then that's not the right thing to do
[46:53] brother Brandon do that program respect
[46:56] to the local pastor I don't mean to make
[47:00] it sound like I'm asking everybody's
[47:01] respect but just the just the dignity
[47:03] just three spective got to have for
[47:05] everybody and the local church that's
[47:07] all I'm saying
[47:08] but like brother Brooks as hell people
[47:10] dream so if you have a dream and you
[47:13] want to interpret it you're praying and
[47:14] maybe ask them about that but if it's
[47:16] something natural let's you know for our
[47:18] home church you're supposed to you're
[47:20] supposed to ask me just have to say like
[47:23] that it'd be like this if you like my
[47:25] wife coming to brother Adam well my
[47:27] husband said we do this with our
[47:28] finances but what do you say that would
[47:31] hurt me I'm going to just tear me up I
[47:33] know my wife wouldn't do that but can
[47:35] you imagine that me Adam how should I
[47:37] treat my children you know my wife says
[47:39] it's fat what do you think you know or
[47:41] sister PO what do you think
[47:42] that's kind of the relationship that it
[47:46] is and we just got to have the respect
[47:48] my program said he's bringing respect to
[47:50] the Apostolic Church and he's the
[47:53] pastor's that you safely thus are
[47:55] trusted the rest of the way if he
[47:57] brought you up to be filled with God's
[47:59] fear and living the life and I trust
[48:01] you're living white rustic they'll be
[48:03] able to answer your questions that's
[48:06] that's all what that's all I want people
[48:07] to just be filled with God's fear a mint
[48:09] that's all we want so hope that helps by
[48:14] God's grace the importance of the
[48:15] fivefold ministry with this rapture like
[48:17] we said it's so crucial program put so
[48:20] much confidence in preachers now people
[48:22] today are saying we don't need a church
[48:23] display date they're putting no
[48:25] confidence in the preacher but brother
[48:27] Brandon put confidence in the preacher
[48:28] because he's the peace of God called man
[48:31] had it's confidence in God it's
[48:33] confidence in college Cooter's okay now
[48:36] here's a good one to perseverance we're
[48:40] going to talk about it's only the elect
[48:41] that will hear the gospel right now I
[48:43] believe that there's a church coming
[48:44] into that perfection that Ministry of
[48:46] perfection where the offices and he goes
[48:48] through the fivefold ministry and
[48:50] pastors and teachers and so forth will
[48:52] be so with the word until the whole
[48:55] thing will work right up to the coming
[48:57] of the Lord that's what he was bleeding
[48:59] the preachers are going to be so with
[49:01] the word I know Wendy get to travel a
[49:04] little few more special meetings but I'm
[49:05] sure she would say the preaching is
[49:07] getting more with the word it's not
[49:09] getting away from the word and you any
[49:11] other Gringo's have tried a little bit
[49:12] too it's been nice for them to travel to
[49:14] the places though God called preachers
[49:17] the words because it's more powerful
[49:18] it's more applicable right it's more
[49:21] right down to the truth that's what
[49:23] matters that would happen and that's
[49:25] what we are looking forward to my God's
[49:26] grace now let me try to find out about
[49:30] we we must do what God is calling us to
[49:33] do you want to learn to sacrifice
[49:39] clothing a light breakfast is kind when
[49:41] I see value around of people and the
[49:42] message I want to get to that let's just
[49:45] hit a few of these here I just hit a few
[49:49] these then we'll move on next one we
[49:51] must do what God's calling us to do now
[49:53] what am I saying
[49:54] God's calling us to sacrifice
[49:56] God's calling us to come here with
[49:58] expectation God's calling us to go back
[50:00] to the beginning and so I would ask
[50:03] would you please pray for me before
[50:04] Wednesday service if you would that
[50:06] would mean the world to me
[50:08] or pray for anyone's gonna sing a song
[50:09] special please because that's what God
[50:13] is calling us to do he's calling us to
[50:15] rally around each other amen
[50:17] and if we do that God bless this program
[50:20] said if we turn the gospel down God will
[50:22] raise up somebody else to do it see if
[50:24] we don't go back to the beginning and
[50:26] start praying and even more so I'm
[50:27] saying even more so you already do but
[50:29] we don't go back to the beginning like
[50:31] that and in one Accord in one place
[50:33] God's gonna raise up somebody else to do
[50:35] it that's that to me that that puts a
[50:38] lot of fear of God in other words I
[50:40] don't want God to push me aside and say
[50:42] oh I'm done with Jesse I want to be one
[50:45] that he can use and this is absolute
[50:48] scriptural there's two examples I
[50:49] thought of Psalm David and then Joshua
[50:52] because one because one person would
[50:55] take the Word of God God had to choose
[50:56] somebody else and here's you know Matt
[50:59] remember this was solved Samuel Colt's
[51:02] saw God would have established your
[51:04] kingdom forever you would've been King
[51:05] forever daughter family
[51:06] he's just okayed the word but because
[51:08] you were prideful because you sacrificed
[51:10] before I got there
[51:12] God's going to raise up somebody else in
[51:14] your place and I've never I don't have a
[51:16] scriptures for Joshua but you know the
[51:18] scriptures of Joshua Moses was supposed
[51:20] to take him in but because he got
[51:21] prideful right and he glorified himself
[51:23] rather he smoked the rock because he did
[51:26] that he got some leaving you in this
[51:27] generation there and raise up Joshua
[51:29] nothing so the same thing is true today
[51:32] if we don't do it God's gonna raise up
[51:35] somebody else going on and my mom and
[51:38] growing up my mom courted this to me all
[51:40] the time because I was you know I was
[51:43] faster than some people you know I would
[51:45] kept winning all these races you know my
[51:47] mom my mom would say Jesse you know
[51:49] people look up to you you need to live
[51:50] the right life I'm like I want to live
[51:52] in sin and everything like that but she
[51:54] always encouraged me to live a Christian
[51:55] life but she would always say this she
[51:57] said Jesse of whom much is given much is
[51:59] required
[52:00] I've never forgotten that you know my
[52:02] mom always kept me humble
[52:05] and that's what Jesus says for whom
[52:07] sever much is given of him shall much be
[52:09] required we have been given the whole
[52:12] message have we not so on the next slide
[52:15] I wrote this we've been given the
[52:16] finished mystery of God in English as we
[52:19] have everything at our disposal as most
[52:21] most languages don't have all the
[52:23] message what are we doing with it and
[52:25] should we be doing more with it amen so
[52:29] just we've been given much but much is
[52:32] required I don't and I know it's human
[52:35] nature it's my nature to get lazy it's
[52:36] my lecture go on it relaxed but we can't
[52:39] do that we got to stay on fire for the
[52:41] Lord okay I'm going to skip a step I
[52:45] don't think I need to read Emma okay
[52:47] here's on if we fail to preach it
[52:49] galleries at the Baptist he certainly
[52:50] will he's going to have a church there
[52:52] without spot or wrinkle
[52:53] there's no time to slack he said it'd be
[52:55] easy now let's start going for the
[52:57] kingdom of God if the minister's won't
[52:59] do it God will raise up businessman to
[53:01] do it to get them together so he sends
[53:06] it over and over and over now here's
[53:08] your's well like now you have a place in
[53:11] God and God has called and called and
[53:14] called never if you like that to go god
[53:18] it's called me I haven't done it yet
[53:19] but look he's so merciful he keeps
[53:21] calling amen he breeds it three times in
[53:23] threes perfection I was going to keep
[53:26] calling you keep calling keep on do you
[53:28] do it so let's surrender praise the Lord
[53:30] let's do that now you fail to take that
[53:32] place someone else will take your place
[53:35] that's why I don't care how hard it gets
[53:37] as a pastor or song leader I'm just
[53:40] going to do in my place amen as struck
[53:42] as I go through my battles and people
[53:44] disagree with me and you should see some
[53:46] believe emails I get sometimes you see
[53:48] some of the comments I get sometimes it
[53:51] can be used to find battles you know but
[53:53] no matter what anybody says I know I've
[53:55] got a place and I was going through my
[53:57] notes I was telling me this I was going
[54:00] through my notes from 2013 and I was
[54:02] writing you know just journaling the
[54:03] Lord to Easter should we end the church
[54:05] and go somewhere else
[54:06] I said Laura I just need one more soul
[54:08] you know that will allow me to stay here
[54:10] and brother God brought in brother amen
[54:12] and since their hula and for the Adam
[54:14] I asked for what a guy gave us three you
[54:17] know which was tremendous and that's
[54:18] before I even prayed that prayer I've
[54:20] heard that fair Jew but to me it just is
[54:23] wonderful to go back and see and
[54:24] remember what God has done for me
[54:26] he's kept us he's answered all of our
[54:28] prayers if we're just sincere about a
[54:30] church God will be with us amen but we
[54:32] got we got to keep our place and we
[54:36] can't fail upon what God God is call us
[54:38] to do now I mention this earlier can we
[54:40] learn to sacrifice athlete we can I
[54:42] believe we can we can learn to sacrifice
[54:45] more my manager said Jesus said come and
[54:48] learn of me take my yoke upon you and
[54:49] learn of me for I D meek and lowly and
[54:53] you'll find rest for your souls
[54:56] now isn't this quite an amazing
[54:58] scripture Jesus says if you want to
[55:01] learn from me
[55:01] I am already meek and lowly so if you're
[55:05] going to learn from somebody neat and
[55:07] lowly you can't be prideful if you're
[55:09] going to learn from some of these unique
[55:10] and lowly right he's already said listen
[55:12] I'm free humph I'm humble person so you
[55:15] basically saying I won't look you have
[55:16] to humble yourself a whole lot and then
[55:19] take my burden upon you well you got to
[55:22] have a bit in other words a week for us
[55:25] when we got to have a small church for a
[55:26] few years or maybe for the rapture yeah
[55:29] I might have a small Church in there
[55:30] heaven that's part of the yoke listen we
[55:34] don't want pretenders in here yes
[55:37] we don't want Judas's no we don't want
[55:40] no anything like that we've seen so many
[55:42] church but it seems like it it's painful
[55:45] it makes me cry makes it hurts me it
[55:48] makes me stay up from 1:00 to 4:00 in
[55:49] the morning a few nights ago I just
[55:50] couldn't sleep you don't think about
[55:51] different situations it's hard it's hard
[55:55] but we must humble ourselves and take
[55:57] his yoke upon it the RAM says this you
[56:02] know with divine healing yet to learn he
[56:04] says you begin to learn if you don't
[56:06] learn there's something wrong we've got
[56:09] to learn we got to learn how to accept
[56:10] God with what it really means
[56:11] like we're helping our sister pray
[56:13] through you know after the service and
[56:15] we try to help her learn where brother
[56:17] Branham said you can you can confess
[56:19] your sins all night he said but until
[56:21] you accept that you're forgiven you will
[56:23] never make any difference you have to
[56:26] accept okay I don't forgive it
[56:27] his word says how forgiving I accept
[56:29] that what do we try to do we try to help
[56:31] people learn to accept God and church
[56:34] that's what I wanna do I wanna learn to
[56:36] accept God for every promise for
[56:38] Supernatural for my family to be say
[56:40] which is the ultimate supernatural
[56:42] Cassady C solo state let me try to find
[56:47] out let me give me compliments that's
[56:54] just a few more and I'll stop right
[56:55] there I don't want to work you out I
[56:57] know I'm starting to feel a little worn
[56:58] out myself so I'm trying to feel that
[57:00] this morning I was if I really get this
[57:02] part of it it's time to hit any little
[57:04] bit a hidden life I love this quote
[57:07] that's what the church needs today is a
[57:09] hidden consecrated life you can't be
[57:12] diddle dabbling along with the world and
[57:14] impersonating and acting like that and
[57:16] hid with Christ because you're trying to
[57:18] fashion after the world you're trying to
[57:20] live like the next church you're trying
[57:23] to belong to better organizations wear
[57:24] better clothes do so and so that's not
[57:26] but that's not comply with Christianity
[57:29] created Christianity is a sacrifice life
[57:32] he didn't like God through Christ see
[57:34] about the Holy Ghost
[57:35] that's what the real Christian life
[57:37] consists of not of how well you can do
[57:39] this or how well you can say that's all
[57:41] right how will you can preach that's
[57:43] fine
[57:43] but that isn't it it's a hidden life
[57:46] consecrating man in other words for me
[57:50] I've got a thought about how I preach
[57:52] it's did I prepare to preach is my is my
[57:56] preparation for Christ is it just here
[57:58] like right before the service or is it
[58:00] at home all week came ahead I have a
[58:03] hidden life with Christ that's what I
[58:05] had God's grace he said the curtains
[58:08] dropped behind you you're dead buried
[58:09] your hidden God through Christ and
[58:11] sealed in there by the Holy Ghost and I
[58:15] read this one a few weeks ago and he
[58:17] said if you want gifts he said you see
[58:20] we want gifts in the supernatural said
[58:22] you're going to sacrifice not money
[58:24] you're going to sacrifice what some your
[58:25] own ideas you have to sacrifice some
[58:27] time you prick
[58:29] you're going to have to sacrifice Naevia
[58:30] stubborn will to break that if you
[58:32] notice you gotta be flexible you're
[58:35] going to have the whole Christian move
[58:36] is sacrificial there's the quote about
[58:40] you as I told you you can't
[58:41] nothing said he waits to the very last
[58:43] minute to kick you before he dies you
[58:46] can't teach a meal nothing but brother
[58:49] Graham's a pedigree Christian is so
[58:51] pedigreed that it can run right straight
[58:54] back to where the book of Acts and see
[58:57] where they came from where they come
[58:59] from they got one Accord that's where
[59:01] they came from and to go through you
[59:03] know the hard times of the crucifixion
[59:05] and the resurrection with and then wait
[59:07] and get one Accord one place one Accord
[59:10] one passion and then bore the same
[59:13] spirit of the same thing acting the same
[59:15] way so when you do this for me huh
[59:18] stenography in order just go to death
[59:20] I'll just close right there is it not
[59:21] miss Tokiko okay let's just pray and
[59:27] then you let me know before you go I'd
[59:30] like to pray a little more on the Sunday
[59:31] mornings
[59:32] and can you let me know if we want to
[59:35] try 10:30 prayer or just maybe start
[59:37] praying at 11:00 so I know some people
[59:38] battle to get here I know it's a battle
[59:40] to get here especially we travel long
[59:42] distance I like to know if we can do a
[59:45] little more group prayer I really feel
[59:48] like there's power in prayer there's
[59:50] power prayer because they had acts to
[59:53] had group prayer I really would like to
[59:56] try it I talked about I mention it for a
[59:58] year now you know I like to see what you
[1:00:00] prefer is really most chances are you
[1:00:03] this is a group that's going to be here
[1:00:04] you know most you guys live in Akron I
[1:00:08] think it except for Wendy and I
[1:00:12] appreciate it because I appreciate all
[1:00:13] the sacrifices you into here it means
[1:00:15] the world Oh Stella big list we got soul
[1:00:18] I'll be in a pastor I still love the
[1:00:20] church you know the God's given us it's
[1:00:22] a real blessing but if you just think
[1:00:25] about that as we pray for a few minutes
[1:00:27] would be better you know to create 10:30
[1:00:30] right or 10:30 or 11:00 I can pray right
[1:00:34] away in the morning you know for that
[1:00:37] service okay and now let's close just s
[1:00:42] God help us to be mature and keep all
[1:00:44] the hitters out you know if there's any
[1:00:45] anything we have against anybody you
[1:00:47] know we just use Matthew 18 except talk
[1:00:50] to numerous fasteners and really seems
[1:00:52] like that's that's what you searched
[1:00:54] you know just to be if there's a problem
[1:00:56] or take care of it you know talk to
[1:00:58] somebody face-to-face you keep all the
[1:01:01] unbelief brotherbrother I've said any
[1:01:03] funny feelings you know keep all the
[1:01:05] funny feelings out and then God will be
[1:01:07] pleased with us so let's pray for that
[1:01:10] it will create I'll just pray together
[1:01:13] I can even the pottery prayers you know
[1:01:15] I really do some you write testimonies a
[1:01:20] member sister bowed out of the written
[1:01:22] testimonies God healed them and God
[1:01:23] provided all these things you know I
[1:01:25] believe in the power your prayers
[1:01:26] because it's it's sincere you know most
[1:01:30] people don't have that sincerity we have
[1:01:33] that we're very thankful for that
[1:01:34] such as prayed here Heavenly Father more
[1:01:38] eww tonight or I know it's a very simple
[1:01:42] topic the Lord your prophet said or your
[1:01:45] spirit said I need to pick up the pen
[1:01:47] I've got to go back to me and we got to
[1:01:52] go and become more like Christ I've got
[1:01:56] to do it in order the Father I'm not
[1:01:58] asking it to be immediate like tomorrow
[1:02:00] and sure be a blessing or God if you
[1:02:03] could all sacrifice so much more so fast
[1:02:07] but what I want to grow into this Morgan
[1:02:09] just like with a planet I can't plant a
[1:02:12] sermon seed and expect it automatically
[1:02:14] the next day to be in full fruition hold
[1:02:17] on but I want to plant these scriptures
[1:02:20] in the hearts of the church either
[1:02:21] always on those that live closed those
[1:02:24] here every service by choice by choice
[1:02:28] they sacrifice they're already
[1:02:30] sacrificing or they're already
[1:02:32] sacrificing this time for you that's
[1:02:35] what you're promising it's called it it
[1:02:38] takes prayer God in these sweet quiet
[1:02:45] moments will of God in these humble
[1:02:48] moments but I pray that these seeds we
[1:02:53] planted all of our hearts Lord to go
[1:02:55] back to the beginning to be in one
[1:02:57] Accord of the first request Lord was
[1:03:02] that we could be more mature more God
[1:03:05] myself on the first
[1:03:07] or if I've got a funny feeling I'll go
[1:03:10] talk to someone you're I'll call them
[1:03:12] nor that we can have a church nor that
[1:03:16] just so honest and sincere Lord so pure
[1:03:20] your God help me to your God I need your
[1:03:24] help
[1:03:24] I know the church is needed all right as
[1:03:27] I've talked to brothers or their so much
[1:03:30] it needs just Lord honest it is so
[1:03:35] there's so many we just all need to be
[1:03:37] honest I'm you can bless last any
[1:03:43] hindrance Lord we just ask to give us
[1:03:45] grace to overcome it dear God
[1:03:47] it was graced this church not trying to
[1:03:52] be like other churches except the book
[1:03:53] of Acts church or God trying to press
[1:03:58] anybody we're just trying to please you
[1:04:00] these people are here to be seen I'm not
[1:04:05] here to be seen of men nor from managed
[1:04:08] rewards we're here because we love you
[1:04:10] Jesus relaxing the power prayers in the
[1:04:15] power of Sunday night services where it
[1:04:18] rejuvenates my prayer life where is me
[1:04:21] strength and revelation or God I've seen
[1:04:25] the power of that Lord and we just asked
[1:04:29] to know that tonight these things we've
[1:04:31] heard what was the treatment that we
[1:04:36] give the or Christians that hidden up
[1:04:38] keep all this in out the church and
[1:04:42] secondly Lord give us the burden give us
[1:04:44] the wisdom on when to pray together I've
[1:04:46] talked about it I mentioned it many
[1:04:47] times we like that to become I like that
[1:04:51] no reality possible I believe in the
[1:04:54] power of our prayers of our Saints I
[1:04:56] believe I'm here to testimonies Lord
[1:05:00] odda and I thank you for that what I
[1:05:04] remember when they gave their
[1:05:05] testimonies of last year Lorna your
[1:05:08] brother bangs testimonies Lord God
[1:05:10] knowing that you answer is perhaps how
[1:05:13] much that means to me me or God or
[1:05:16] United prayers what we have Nina Morgana
[1:05:18] is great if you must wisdom we can come
[1:05:21] too early
[1:05:21] Lord of night you would have heard atha
[1:05:24] just to start with a little real prayer
[1:05:26] to call upon Jesus and harmony more God
[1:05:30] we can be that one Accord we could be
[1:05:32] that harmonizing cry or we all cry out
[1:05:35] Lord say Holy Spirit come grow with us
[1:05:39] today must be more sincere Lord as you
[1:05:44] told your problem I was to walk with you
[1:05:47] you are God that's my prayer here
[1:05:51] tonight know Jesus and I know you record
[1:05:55] on this walk out I know it's record on
[1:05:57] the computer I know you're recording in
[1:05:59] heaven
[1:06:00] that means Lord your answers of your God
[1:06:03] for what I'm asking this in faith I'm
[1:06:06] asking you to help us to be mature take
[1:06:08] care of all problems as homely and sweet
[1:06:10] me as we can right away
[1:06:12] it also Lord we could in church of
[1:06:17] prayer warriors parent lawyers Lord our
[1:06:22] church's name and prayer words could be
[1:06:23] in the same phrase Bride of Christ
[1:06:26] fellowship they're a bunch of prayer
[1:06:29] warriors that's what I was spider into
[1:06:33] and I want to be a prayer warrior
[1:06:35] I know these sins want to be prayer
[1:06:37] warriors mark up to bat on prayer or God
[1:06:41] like Daniel did here I think that's all
[1:06:45] of our hearts desire for choices normal
[1:06:48] chatter these Lord I think you will
[1:06:51] that's according to your word you said
[1:06:53] ask anything in my name I do it so we
[1:06:57] ask the Father these things in the name
[1:06:59] of Jesus Christ lord I don't know when
[1:07:02] you'll answer the moment I just pray
[1:07:04] that you'll enter these requests and
[1:07:07] Lord it will be part of bringing us back
[1:07:09] to the beginning what I've said it
[1:07:13] before without saying it we are the seed
[1:07:16] of Abraham
[1:07:17] we can wait 25 years for drums our
[1:07:21] waiting lord help us to give you glory
[1:07:24] as Abraham under God believing before we
[1:07:29] see the promise which is a true sign of
[1:07:31] thing true sign that we received in
[1:07:33] evidence Lord of substance
[1:07:35] it's real no more bless these things and
[1:07:39] I pray Lord earlier dear God
[1:07:40] I do love or your I thank you for their
[1:07:45] sacrifice to be here I think if I love
[1:07:51] them like I do
[1:07:53] tear it up for them must be just so much
[1:07:56] number tremendous I mean maybe I don't
[1:08:00] express it like I need to or but I which
[1:08:03] you'll appreciate them unite our hearts
[1:08:05] in order to fear you as we looked at
[1:08:09] last week II fear your name to hear what
[1:08:12] another going to respect one another all
[1:08:15] we want is to see that scripture the
[1:08:17] prophecy about us to be fulfilled Lord
[1:08:21] God that's all we want we just want to
[1:08:23] walk in the prophecy I was to pray the
[1:08:25] prophecy and in closing I'll pray that
[1:08:28] that our vets be full of oil full of
[1:08:32] wine may we have plenty of bread you are
[1:08:36] not they may the people of God rejoice
[1:08:39] invited Christ fellowship and never be
[1:08:42] ashamed of Jesus Christ

[1:08:47] years the Antichrist spirit has taken
[1:08:50] away or from the true church may you
[1:08:53] restore all of it in our church we pray
