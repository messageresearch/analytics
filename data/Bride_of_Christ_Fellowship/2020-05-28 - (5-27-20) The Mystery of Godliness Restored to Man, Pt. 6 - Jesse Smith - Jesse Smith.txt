Corinthians four then we'll read our memory verse after that same Corinthians 4:16 like to look at the mystery of godliness restored a man again tonight this is where I'm hoping to get by the end by God's grace so I'm going to really try to endeavor to get here and Lord willing tonight we'll continue looking at how the character traits on the Statue of a perfect man can be added or lost now verse 16 is what I worry and I'll read 16 and 17 and then we'll go to isaiah 12 and read that together there 16 for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day so we have quite a thing going on in our bodies we get weaker and weaker in our bodies but then our spirit we should get stronger and stronger and newer and newer by the grace of the Lord that's our great choice every day to draw closer to God or to draw closer to the world let's draw closer to God tonight that's why your lives should meet praise God then Lord should bless you in that verse 17 for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory so believers have a weight of glory there's a heavenly eternal weight or substance in glory that awaits the believer so see as we add God's character we do God's works and it produces an eternal weight in heaven so let's go to isaiah 12:2 as a twelve to the three two through five let's begin on three one two three behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my son he also is become my salvation therefore with joy shadi draw water out of the wells of salvation and in that day shall you say praise the lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people they mention that his name is exalted sitting into the line or he has done excellent things this is known in the earth amen may God has blessing the ringers word may be see so nor willing tonight we'll look at this mystery of godliness restore demand again appreciate everybody's patience you know going through this series that's part of your Christian attributes his patience praise God it's so wonderful for me bleed for you to to see how scriptural all of brother branham's sermons really work you know there's a human element there's a human side where it was just his opinions or thoughts but on his doctrines and his teachings that he he reference over and over it's beautiful to see how scriptural everything was and I I'm I'm a first-hand witness to that you know having written a book about modesty and I writing this book about brother branham's ministry was to finish the mystery of God so basically as I've been studying this week I've thought about that I'm writing just a scriptural summary of all the major highlights brother branham's and ministry I'm he hated the highlights and then I'm just pulling all the scriptures together and bringing it all together so you can see even more of the picture that's what brother Graham said even when he preached the seals he said I could only hit the highlights even when he preached the statue of hereford man he said he said each character trait deserves its own day its own sermon right and so brother Ram said you could preach for months on just one seal and no doubt you could preach months just on faith as we've seen you could preach months on virtue and knowledge and all these different things so really we're just hitting we're just trying to find more details on the highlights brother Graham hit the highlights for sure and we're trying to add to that and make it so plain that it's undeniable the only way you would deny it it wouldn't be because you can't see it's because you don't want to see it and we know that's exactly what Paul says is going to happen the reason people are gonna perish is because they did not receive the love of the truth they could have but they turn down the love for truth which is a love for the Bible so I want my family I want the church I pastor that God has given in my care to know the Bible right because if you love the truth then the truth makes you free praise God amen so that's so now tonight Lord whether you want to pick up and we're look at how you you and I can either add the qualities or lose them and we have six texts about that we kind of we kind of majored on a couple of them and we'll go through that but I want to just revisit some of these again let's go to Matthew 12 29 and 30 so we'll have Lydia read Matthew 12 29 and 30 thank you and now Kevin don't you read 12 verses 43 and through 45 so we're going now to one of these six scriptures that I felt as I was writing this clearly proved that people can receive God's virtues we call them character qualities in order to not use the word virtue over and over again or with different meanings to it you can receive God's character qualities or God's anointings but then lose him so Lydia Matthew 12 to 29 and 30 first find the strong in that and then while he's boy in his house he does not with me is against me he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad all right so Jesus clearly shows if you are with him you will keep his Goods in your house amen so if you are for Jesus you'll keep his anointings in your life if you're against him that you'll let his enemies come in bind up your faith right or bind up your strength like Samson that's a good example Samson bound up and then robbed he was robbed of his power right or the source of his power was keeping the vow so just like that he was robbed of just like that here Jesus says believers today can be robbed of God's blessings they had him but then they were the spoils weren't taken from the house okay now Malik I can read verses 43 through 45 then you say I will return into my house from once I came out when he has come he finds that empty swept and garnished then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and drove there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation Amen so Jesus says the generation in which he lived people could live a sanctified clean out life with no demons in their life but if they didn't get God's character qualities in there then evil spirits would come in more powerful right they were first delivered being first saved but then if they didn't fill it they didn't keep building up and possessing God's blessings and receiving more of his anointing and receiving more of his word than the enemy would come in spoil the blessings and then eight other demons would come in and now we know this happened to Judas and church with Judas it wasn't eight demons that came in it was Satan himself the chief demon and so we must be very careful Judas had his house cleaned out he had good qualities at one time but we know because of his thieving desires he eventually sold those out and that Satan himself came in his house okay we need the Holy Ghost to come into the house praise God and fill it up and keep out and seal out Satan until the day of redemption forever for eternity praise God so I want to hope I want everyone to see that that spiritual robbery you know we sang that song years ago went to the enemy's camp and took back what he stole from you right this is the scripture we can see for it also in David and David and I forget the name of the King there I can't remember when David had all of us came out of the city but David had his his wives and his family and all this good stolen then he had to pray and he prayed about it should I go get it and then he went out and got him and brought him back he he went and took what the enemy stole from him you know Abraham did the same right Abraham heard about lot his brother taking captive he took 400 men defeated five kings and the nine kings were five and then for four total nine kings and then he brought everything back in God's mercy did you find Ziklag Ziklag that's it Thank You Lydia all right as Susan I do it was a very interesting name of a city Ziklag so he went out of Ziklag and took back what Satan stole from him by the Word of God amen now let's look at one more scripture on this because remember brother Branham says Satan can't get in unless you let him in and then men of God or sisters cannot cast out demons unless the person wants to be free from that so let's go to 2nd Timothy 2:26 case you can get that 2nd Timothy 2:26 I'm gonna get it too just in case there's some surrounding scriptures 2nd Timothy 2:26 now speaking of ministers in verse 24 he said the servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men have to teach and patient in meekness instructing those that oppose them sells so we have to look at people that have fallen away from the message or people that are still in church but are falling away from really loving God they're actually opposing themselves right there mine is against their soul right and we saw that with the man who built the barns right his soul his mind spoke to his soul and said soul take your ease don't worry about everything I'll take care of it we'll build build bigger barns he opposed himself in other words he was quenching that holy thirst with the world instead of instead of satisfying that holy thirst with the things of God hallelujah now look at this verse 25 if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth okay so a sinner or someone who's caught or addicted to certain things they must acknowledge the truth right they must acknowledge I'm addicted and it's my fault and I want to be free my house has a demon in it it shouldn't have a demon in it I acknowledge that and I acknowledge that I'm guilty I need forgiven and I want to be changed praise God verse 26 in case you can read that for us 2nd Timothy 2:26 you who are taking a cat tear that I hear at his room very good so see what is Paul saying we have to be meek as as Christians to try to give instruction to people who are hurting themselves so they can recover themselves out of Satan's trap because they were taken captive by Satan's will but remember they wanted it as well right they had a surrender their will before Satan program says before Satan could take you you got to go out to him you've got to leave the protection of the word the best exam the simplest one is Eve right II had to submit to the will of the serpent right the serpent couldn't force even to it but he had to deceive her by telling her a lie in church I was looking at that lie this week and I heard a preacher say in a way I'd never heard it before the lie was to make Eve the absolute I thought that was really good I never heard that before because the serpent said when you partake in this fruit you'll be wise like God knowing good and evil so see this is the this was the ability it was a saint was trying to convince her you can be the absolute instead of God being absolute you can be the absolute and that's the sin of the take church movement they're making brother Branham the absolute right instead of Jesus Christ but there's only one absolute praise the Lord so see Satan tricked her into thinking she could be elevated where she could be the absolute you and I must always keep our humility that the word is the absolute not us every day we need to cleanse our minds and filter our thoughts through the absolute of the Word of God we must not let Satan trick us into making ourselves something when we're nothing okay so see Christians can recover right they can recover themselves out of the snare of the devil like another good examples Kings saw King Saul was in a snare right a murderous spirit he threw javelins at David trying to kill him hunted him down his own son-in-law but eventually he repented he stopped it he recovered himself on that snare now of course he got into another one with the Witch of Endor and everything but it's just an example of how to you they can be recovered out of their fall okay so that's a good Scripture I want you to see that that ties in so recovering out of the snare of the devil it's very similar to Matthew 12 this idea of Satan taking captive spoiling you but those spirits or spirit can be driven out and you can recover your clean estate right so we've seen it today like Peter right like Peter as you preach on Sunday night he had virtue he lost it but he got recovered thank God that we can be recovered out of the snare or trap of the devil praise God all right now the second example we are looked at Luke 8 and the four kinds of believers the first ground believed for a while and Satan's snatch it away Jesus said they believed and I'm sorry the first one heard it didn't believe it and then Saint statue ate the second one believed for a while but it didn't have a good foundation right it was built upon this so I fell upon stones and it endured dearth for a while lasted for a season but is only temporarily and then it withered away and died so that's like Judas and that's like people today that could have start to have some growth they start getting some more anointing and more blessings of God but then it withers away because of their heart condition and then we looked at Hebrews three chapter three and four it's an allegory of Israel leaving Egypt to get to the promised land the church we saw that souls who died in the wilderness had gained many miles on the journey many miles but they lost every benefit because they doubted the next step okay because they down to the next step it made them want to go back to Egypt alright so they really made it that far but then lost they really in their hearts went back they lost everything because God shut them out of the promised land now let's go back to Hebrews 6 let's go back to Hebrews six six readers 6:1 Hebrews 6:1 so I want to spend more time on this one here so these rap Lydia here Hebrews 6:1 I'm gonna have Lydia just read verse three so let me read Hebrew six three all right so Paul in verses 1 and 2 says all he lists all the beginning doctrines of Christianity such as faith repentance baptisms laying on of hands resurrection eternal judgment then Paul gives the same idea we'll leave those and move on to perfection if God permits so see we must work with God's will right to move on to greater teachings right greater understandings of God's Word so again it's like a journey right huge the children here I have to choose all of us have to choose to move on in your journey pass the elementary teachings of the gospel okay now next it shows about people that don't continue on to perfection but fall away in verse 4 so now I can read verse 4 verse 6 for where is it possible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost verse 5 and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew themselves again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame my what a scripture so this is a lot like Judas again he tasted of the gifts of the Spirit he tasted of the good word of God he heard the best preacher preach the Lord Jesus Christ none of us could ever touch it if anybody had tasted if anybody had ever been enlightened it would have had to bend Judas but he fell OH from that he had it and he was there he had attributes he had anointing and power understanding but he fell away from that and he put Christ to an open shame publicly betraying him with the kiss now this portion ends let's go to verse 12 I was right verse 11 in case you can read verse 11 he verse 6 11 and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end ok so when dealing with falling away Paul emphasizes diligence so if you don't want to fall away if you want to continue on and press toward the mark of the high calling you've got to show diligence and we started this chapter by showing that godliness is obtainable Jesus says by giving all your strength all your love all your heart soul mind and strength praise God we got to give all of it in other words we got to give every fiber of our being over to the Holy Ghost praise God and obey Him in everything Amen hallelujah now in the middle of this portion notice he talks about the two seats now Church this the two seeds is only known by God right because none of us really know right just like at just like at Jesus's Last Supper did they know it was Judas that was going to betray do they know Judas was a thorn no but but Paul gives us this insight that really in God's eyes but by foreknowledge it's either one seed or the other right by his foreknowledge but we don't always know right we don't always know people that we thought were solid in the message would fall away and live like a devil and enjoy it and it's awful so that proves they were the wrong seed but we didn't know it all the time because they let they let their human spirits get cleaned out right their house got cleaned out for a while but they never filled it they never continued on and so then seven or eight seven more demons came in eight demons came into these people but verse 11 and 12 said we will inherit the promise if we're not slothful we can't be lazy we have to be diligent Christians hallelujah we must diligently with all of our effort serve God not be lazy but be hard workers for the kingdom of God amen in other words giving our will giving our strength surrendering our desires praise God with faith and patience to inherit the promises amen thank the Lord okay now this diligence is the same idea taught in the statute of a perfect man by Peter in 2nd Peter 1:5 and 1:10 I'll read that because I'm right here 2nd Peter 1 5 and 10 all my terms this statute over man teaching is rock solid it is absolutely the word of the Lord I believe with all my heart it is so see how this see on diligence and falling away goes hand in hand it's the same thing Peter says here beside this giving all diligence at faith to your to your virtue see if you want to if you want God to add more anointing to your life more understanding you got to be diligent amen you got to see God every day you got to pray and humble yourself and repent and stay true to God keep the house clean and fill it with good things amen pray for God to fill it with with faith and virtue of knowledge and patience of temperance godless brotherly kindness amen and then seal it off seal Satan out with the baptism of the Holy Ghost verse 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall what a promise will never fall if we fill the house with good things with treasures we'll never fall in let let Christ seal that Christ put a lock on that door and see all the good things in will never fall we'll be faithful and we'll have eight eternal weight of glory he's God that's beautiful night it just it just ties the whole Bible together like Bram said that was his ministry to take all the loose ends and tie them all together alright two more scriptures we're not going to read them because they're very familiar in 2nd Timothy 3:1 to 7 Paul says in the last days perilous times will come because men will be lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God and he said they will fall away yeah they'll fall away there's a great falling away then 2nd Thessalonians 2:3 says before the person the Antichrist can be revealed a great falling away or apostasy from the Christian faith has to occur so that means only believers can fall away and that's taught in 2nd Peter 2:21 so I'm going to read that second Peter 2:21 because I'm right there yes beautiful for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness then after they've known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them Peter said it'd be better not to know because the punishment would be less right just like there's there's degrees of punishment in hell now this is the thing I understand about people that say hell's eternal if hell is eternal everybody gets the worst punishment because it's gonna be forever right I'm just gonna be eternally but here it says there's different levels again it'd be better not to hear the gospel and face Jesus is judgment then to know it and then turn away from it alright so those are very clear teachings there you can see again people can know it they can be approaching it and then fall away and turn from it all right let's go to another Maine scripture another big text Hebrews 10 let's go there by God's grace Hebrews 10:19 239 it's a long text but we'll hit the highlights here at church that's why I'm writing this book so I have a reference so if anyone ever tries to say people can't lose the anointing and people can't lose their salvation their scripture your six scriptures that say you can you can believe for a while and then let it die away you can have good things in your house and then have them stolen right you can be clean and then be dirty there's so many scriptures and it just it makes the Bible a new Bible it makes the Bible understandable because it's God's revelation of the Bible phrase God not a man it's God's it's Jesus's faith that we live by so Hebrews 10:19 239 so in this portion people can draw back unto perdition which means lose their confession of eternal life not believing unto the saving of the soul so that's verse 39 I'm going to read that but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul now drawing back means retreating or shrinking back okay so again we get the idea of soldiers possessing the land right Israel possessing the land but then retreating from it you know you can take the land you know you can do it but then you retreat from it why would you do that we wouldn't do that we want to want to but people did it because of fear right Israel shrank back because of fear and doubt our enemies are too great our enemies are going but look at our God our enemies are bigger than us but our God is bigger than our enemies why should we retreat we should move on because God is with us and we God is with us who can be against us I love you look how great our God is look what he's already done the children even you have a good testimony because God has protected you and God has been with you and guided you so I may have I'm asking children to give their testimonies in July kind of thinking about that and just a head start you have to start having a testimony because you overcome Satan by the word of your testimony you have to have a story to tell I know a lot of my children are good storytellers but the the reason behind that is so you can overcome the enemy and if you want you can write them out and I'll read them for you I know some people are there's more nervous in front of other people but you have to have a story if not you don't even know where you came from you don't know where you're going you don't even know what you're doing in this life but you got to have a story you got to know that God's called you to something God's giving you blessings and you got to know what to do next praise God okay so on the road to eternal life you choose one of three options right you'd either finish strong or you become I don't stay in one place that's Israel stopping and stopping at Kadesh Barnea or you retreat from the narrow road to the broad road you give up entirely and go to another road okay so let's go to verse 26 so I'm not sure where I think we're at now I write because let me read that really small verse so Paul begins this section by talking about having a true heart of assurance of faith but and then he says Christians should gather more and more and edify one another now verses 26 and 29 show how if people sin willfully on purpose after knowing the truth it's grounds for punishment in other words the more you know the more you're accountable for so especially message people are going to be judged harshly if they're not obedient if they're obedient they'll be judged now praise God but they're not obedient they'll be judged at the white throne judgment for not obeying God's Word okay so Malachi read 26 please Hebrews 10:26 for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remains no more sacrifice for sins okay so Paul says have a true heart of full assurance gathered together more but if you do if you sin willfully yeren you're getting very close to the danger zone look at verse 29 I'll read that of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the Son of God and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace now the main phrase for this topic that we have to see is wherewith he was sanctified proving a person can be sanctified because church the Greek meaning for sanctification is separate from profane things and dedicated to God that's what it means think of the house again in Matthew 12 the house was separated from profane devils right there was no Devils in there was cleaned out that's what sanctification is cleaned out and set aside now you can put things in it right set aside for service set aside for having possessions right goods and so that's what's it's saying here you can be sanctified but then do despite the spirit of grace so the spirit of unn in favor the spirit of unmarried favors trying to give you more favor right give you more of God's blessings more of as his Holy Spirit is anointing but to do despite that to turn down those blessings is to be punished and open the door for demons to come in and bring in their addictions and their evil habits and their evil thinking and all their oppression and torment suicidal thoughts on this evil that's got to be driven out and they got to be kept out by the power of the Holy Spirit all right so this is again the idea of Israel coming up to K - they were so close but then they drew back right they did despite the spirit of grace and setup being born again and going into the Promised Land they drew back but verses 38 gives us a great encouragement now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him well we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul okay so believing is a journey is the race we have to keep going forward we can't draw back we have to go forward running the race with patience the the path that's set before us pressing on toward the mark of the high calling praise God so see church your journey starts at faith you choose the path and then as you go along get the virtue and knowledge and temperance of patience godless and brotherly kindness just like Israel could know at any time they could know where they stood so can we know where we stand in fact if you the scripture God always told Moses where to go the pillar of fire was always leading them they knew where they are at and you can know where you're at today do we can all know where we are now let's look to the last text to prove this back to second Peter 2 so Keysha you go to 2nd Peter 2:19 now this is speaking of sermons of corruption so preachers that are going to hell and taking other people to hell with them that's what verse 17 says then verse 18 talks about their their vain words okay should read 19 force please well they promise them Liberty they themselves and the servants of corruption 4 of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage praise God so false preachers and you see it all the time on TV or the internet they make promises all the time but the people never get there by just makes me sick to my stomach to hear people the same preachers time after time promise the people all these things and they never get to it because the preachers themselves serve corruption instead of serving God I'm happy I'm happy to report by God's grace that people that I've taught in our church right you can think of different examples I promised them or I made though I share God's promise with them if you repent and get baptized and sanctified you shall receive the Holy Ghost praise God amen and I've made I made that Bible promise to people and I've served righteousness not corruption and I believe I'm trusting my God's grace people have received the promises we've been pointing to praise amen thank you Lord because we're not being overcome by sin we're being overcome by God's love amen he's conquered by heart amen he's won my heart and I'm a prisoner of my Savior praise God now look at verse 24 if they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ there again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning is that something there it is right there proves it you're either gonna overcome Satan or he's gonna overcome you right see they're entangled again and overcome you're either gonna overcome the devil or you're or the devil is gonna overcome you who's stronger see you're gonna fight right you're gonna fight the devil who's gonna win who's gonna get the most points who's gonna get the victory you're either gonna overcome him or he's going to overcome you but thank God we got a real sharp sword praise God way sharper than his way anyway sharper right all you have to do is keep our armor on right keep our defensive weapons and then attack with the sword of the Spirit stay behind the Word of God and we can overcome and we can be the victors praise God verse 22 what's happened to them according to the true proverb the dog has turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire okay so Peter compares a backslider like Judas to a pig that can be washed and made clean within returns to the mud and Jesus says the only way to be clean is through the word John 15:3 now are you clean through the word which I've spoken unto you I hope that's how you come to church I hope that's how the Saints come to church they come they hear the word and they walk out feeling clean if not then you got to believe the word because we're preaching the clean the cleansing power of the word right but we should leave the church feeling clean because we received it because Jesus said the word cleans amen hallelujah so see just like a pig can temporarily get clean the word cleans if you hang around the word you're gonna get clean but it's only temporary when they forsake the clinic cleansing agent and go back to their sin addiction lifestyle okay so Lydia Matthew 27 44 now in the book I'm closing this little section here with the thief on the cross as an example of how quickly you can receive the attributes of God okay so you know in Luke 23:43 Jesus tells the thief verily I say to thee today thou shalt be with me in paradise we know that he who is saved at the end but most people don't know Matthew 27 44 so the D can you read that and the thieves also which were crucified with him he has the same in his teeth okay so both thieves were mocking and challenging Jesus at the beginning so this is a beautiful example of how a sinner can you know just a few minutes before they get saved be mocking and reviling Christ but then once getting into his presence all that the hair is right there just get the Jesus's presence start hearing his word and worshiping him loving him you'll fall in love with him praise God and you'll see that he's all holy he's all worthy he's worthy of all of our praise they met once in his presence the thief received enough faith to choose the right way to say Jesus has done nothing wrong you would he's speaking to the other thief you and I deserve this punishment but he's done nothing wrong the word is right and then he had enough virtue to stand up and rebuked the other thief saying dust thou not fear God seeing thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom so the lesson is Jesus will quickly and faithfully pardon all those who glory in his sinlessness and humbly plead for eternal life praise God he quickly gives them faith and in this case he quickly got virtue and even knowledge I'd say cuz he had knowledge to know that Jesus was gonna save him and then he be with Jesus all right so let's see this I'm gonna finish with this next thought here I didn't set my timer ok well I'll set it for 15 year I want to finish with this last thought I've reached on this a few times over the years but I want to put it all together in this closing thoughts here ok so let's go to mark 10 21 we had milk okay now guys go to mark 10 21 so I'm gonna close this little sermon here with each each one of us can know that our current character okay in other words we can know where we are in the statute perfect man we can know if we possess in our own spirits or our soul we can know if we have the spiritual goods that Jesus talked about in Matthew 12 we can um okay yeah so okay okay actually skiers Mark 10:17 please and when he was gone fourth another way there came one running healed him and asked him good master what should I do that I may inherit eternal life okay so here the rich young ruler let's see him this is what I love about this story he comes running he don't come walking into church he comes running in the church we rarely seen that right he comes running and then not only does he run he falls down and kneels so he comes running now I've had my children run up to me and asked me questions the last few days daddy when can we do this I like that that's that's running to Daddy to ask him things but he's running to Jesus falling on his knees and he says what lack I yet so he goes he goes and tells Jesus he's kept all these six commandments that are listed here in mark 10 Malka I can read verse 21 then Jesus beholding him loved him and said to him one thing thou lackest go thy way so it so ever thou hast and give to the poor then shout the treasure in heaven and come take up their cross and follow me okay so the Bible said Jesus loved this man he loved him he had to get compassion form doesn't not have compassion upon all the world for God so loved the world if God loved this man he had to love Judas as well love him in the sense of a creator he created the these beings so he loved them he had a desire for them to know him and want them to be saved now notice he kept all six of the commandments did you notice which ones he talked about it was Commandments five through nine he kept five through nine the ones that Jesus listened was five to nine those are the ones that deal with other people rike is the first four deal with God you know don't take his name in vain all these things I know other gods before me so Jesus lists how are you treating others see what Jesus was trying to do he's trying to get down do you really love other people and so he challenged them he didn't challenge everybody with the challenge but what was his challenged go sell all your goods give it to the poor in other words do you really love other people that was his test remember not everybody had to do that right like Abraham he was rich Solomon was rich David was a lot of money but jesus knew this man needed to prove to Jesus that he loved Jesus and the word morning love money and when he came down to it he really didn't because after after Jesus told him that what'd he do he walked away with his head down sorrowful so see even in keeping those Commandments five through nine he said what lack I yet to see children and Saints God puts something in your heart called a conscience right it's an awareness it's a moral awareness and you know what's in your heart whether you have the blessings of God or you lack some God puts it in your heart so you know and then notice Jesus the Jesus play around with him at all know Jesus told him exactly keep these things but there's one more thing you need see God will always show us in our servants we listen to as we meditate as we read our Bibles in the mornings God will always show us what we have need of Jesus points and here's what you need to do you need to sell all that all that all your possessions give that to the poor follow me that would be that sound like an adventure wouldn't it mom I get to leave I'll leave all that behind all that business and money and counting all the money and building big things I can leave that behind I can go on follow Jesus and we see the maracle's and see Souls saved I'd be an adventurer to some of us but to him money was way more important than the ministry the preaching the praying for the sick that was way more important so church serves a church and family we can know how far we've come with God and if we still lack his character qualities Jesus agreed with the rich coming world he said one thing thou lackest right he said what do I lack he said you lack one thing he left Jesus grieved and sorrowful sad he left church because he had great possessions and the preachers were saying don't love money love the gospel okay so friends our story doesn't have to end like that right by God's grace you can add the qualities rather than lack the qualities we don't have to lack we can have them added to us so see this story tells you God's Spirit will always give you an honest spiritual assessment of where you are with God always they'll tell you what you got he'll show you what you lack so think about have you just been recently baptized that's good you got faith but do you have virtue to live it publicly where no matter where you go whether it's horse lessons or dance people know they really love God or Taekwondo so think of the public places where you would go do those people know that you there's something different about you you you're honest you keep your word you don't steal you don't say evil things if you can live it in front of other people publicly you got virtue okay so more maybe you're the spot where you're you're very impatient in your home right or or you see that you you don't treat others you're not a loving sinners you get really upset with sinners and you speak bad about them that shows you need godliness because God is good to the just and the unjust or maybe it's that last umbrella kindness when your brothers in the church or sisters in the church say something wrong you get mad at that you get mad at them and don't want to come to church don't want to forgive or maybe you won't even sit down and talk about a problem with somebody at the church because you're so upset with them you'd rather leave and go somewhere else or just ignore them and not talk to them and not shake their hand not talking about it remember the last step before the baptism Holy Ghost is brotherly kindness being able to deal with problems amongst your brothers and sisters and be kind with it right we have a lot of people we've seen come and go that when they disagree they're not very kind right that's a good read that's a good that's a good sign that people aren't in brotherly kindness yet right or maybe your cross over Jordan but now it's time to find your position but where's your ministry where are you where are you supposed to be and then you're so in you're so attached to the Word of God that you're bringing forth fruits of the spirit people can see the fruits the rare the the rare expressions of God's love the genuine ripe expressions of God's love oh thank you Jesus remember Saints Jesus's bodies in heaven but his spirit is near to every heart trying to show you your character and offer you a greater experience with God acts 17 says the or has determined your bounds of your habitation that you should seek the Lord if happy they might feel after him and find him but we be not far from every one of us and that great to know that God is very close to this house God's not far from Doylestown God's right here in Doylestown right God is in Akron he's not far from us he's very close to us but we after feeling him we have to go we have to go seek after him right search for him as silver and find him for him for in him we live and move and have our being when you're in your calling you that's when you feel like you're alive like when I'm preaching and is writing and making videos I feel like I'm alive because I'm doing what God called me to do is it heart yes it's labor but in him we live and move and have our being so see he's very close to us we can live for him but we have to listen to him respond to him and and respond right as a scripture says and find him find his will for our lives here are some beautiful scriptures I'm just gonna read them to you see scripture declares that God weighs your character so in other words God ways and knows which attributes of the statue for man we have proper 16 - all the ways of a man are clean and his own eyes but the Lord waiteth the spirits so see the Lord weighs the spirits he knows he judges the spirits he knows which ones we have which ones we don't and God's Word is the measuring stick or the balance that weighs your character because Paul says in Philippians 3:16 Christians should walk by the same rule which means of a measuring rod a carpenter's line see we should take that statue of every man and use that to measure ourselves how where do we stand on that are we growing in that right that should be our eye should be our ruler are we as tall as are we as tall as faith virtue and the knowledge of patience of temperance godless brotherly kindness or charity where we at on growing on that measuring stick see God gives us his word so we can measure our lives by its truce and by its character and some day we'll all be judged by the word because Paul said we shall all judge I'm sorry God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel you might as well go stand by the ruler now right let me go to the doctor you always stand there getting weighed and measured we should do that now it's going to happen eventually we should do it with a statue for men no way measure yourself right weigh yourself or measure yourself according to the ruler of God's Word now the last few examples I gathered just a few minutes here yeah the last two examples our Belshazzar from the time of Daniel and Joe how much time I got okay good I got two minutes that's perfect Belshazzar you know he was king of Babylon at the time of its fall he was the last king but he'd profane Israel's holy temple vessels by feasting with them and praising idols all that mustn't make God so meant supernatural fingers interrupted the feast and wrote the Kings doom on the wall which Daniel interpreted as thou Belshazzar are weighed in the balances and are found wanting see he was guilty of refusing to learn humility through Nebuchadnezzar's life so he was lacking the humility that he should have learned in other words God was trying to add right there God was trying to add humility to him praise God but he turned he refused it and so God said your character is lacking just like the rich young ruler what do I lack see God's Spirit means you you're possessing an eternal weight praise God having God's anointing you have a spiritual weight praise God seeing God's eyes Belshazzar's character was wanting or deficient it was lacking humility though there was lacking faith so we know what happened he was killed that night and then the kingdom went over from gold to silver right from Babylon to meet the Persians because he lacked character that's how his people today is they they don't their house ISM if their house doesn't fill with good things it gets taken over right and that Kingdom got taken over just like houses and Jesus parable can get taken over just give me one more minute here finish up with Joe job we you know is known for having his patience tested to the limit we oh my I don't think we've been there have we we haven't had our patients tested that much yet he passed the test he lost his livestock servants and children my Satan's desires one of those traps we were talking about earlier yet Satan kept his integrity by worshipping God and not charging God foolishly he went through months of tests and finally pleaded with God he said let me be weighed in the even balance that God may know mine integrity see job new job new I haven't sinned he said I I know I've got these character qualities inside of me praise God no I've got God's anointing still on me I've got mine integrity praise God amen he said God that God may know my integrity let me be weighed in God's balance amen in other words let the world see them I'm on the statue of perfect man let the world see that I've got faith and mert's you praise God right like your friends let's go I let my friends see that I've got virtue I've got knowledge and I've got brother kindness for my Christian man let him see it in me I know I've got it that's a jobber say I know I've got it I'm passing the test I'm not failing I'm not getting overcome I'm overcoming that's what Joe was saying it's beautiful in this beautiful my goodness this is rich oh thank you hard see God would eventually wake jobs life and deem it or judge it acceptable telling his three friends that Joe had spoken right and day had spoken wrong so job said Judge mean way me Lord I know I'm right and God did and God said Joe was right see children you can know where you stand with God you can know you've got the weight of God's character in your life you have to wonder you can know it and the way you know glory is by getting victory in the midst of trials wearing your hardest trials and you stand the test and you turn down Satan's temptation that's when you know you got it Alleluia so last thing I want to say is this scripture that we started with Paul says trials and tests of faith produce an eternal weight of glory we know what the way it is right the way is since it's eternal it must be a heavenly reward because we've got a body that's eternal waiting in heaven right so what eternal weight is there must be the heavenly awards that await Christians such as the crown of life pulsed to have a crown of life that's weighty right it has weight in heaven and the memorials of God kept as witnesses of his children's acts of faith because remember the angel met corniest and what he's saying there's memorials of your prayers and alms before God in heaven so see there's an eternal substance in heaven for the true believer who's a overcomer amen hmm and Paul says I'm sorry Peter says our tests of faith are more precious than gold that perishes thanks Jesus will help you know your current character what's lacking and as we've said a few weeks ago what needs prune in your character if you're born again and if you're lacking you can accept his portion of anointing of character that will help you store up an eternal weight of glory in heaven praise God we'll stop right there Lord willing on the following Wednesday because I'll be gone Sunday we'll look at the third weight knowledge by God's grace so let's uh let's worship the Lord here praise God what a blessing tonight what a blessing this is how God restores his character to man he goes from glory to glory okay I like this foot by foot oh that's perfect nuts that's Israel miss Joshua footsteps our possession foot by foot footsteps and just like feet on a measuring stick feet feet our feet steps footsteps our possession but also growing step by step God's measuring stick let's take inventory your house tonight if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if you come to him like the rich young ruler I come and you're honest and say I lack this or I struggle with that they'll tell you exactly what you need to do I already believe that may not be tonight maybe tomorrow as you study maybe when you go through the next test or trial but since we know he's the same we know if we come and approach in the same way as rich young ruler or Joe I have a thorn I'm in the midst of fire you'd have kept my integrity that by showing my character let it be proved right I know avid syndicate they got to vindicate that kind of life no doubt he was just prudent Joe wasn't [Music] let's how weird we're let's just be honest here before that we father we thank you for tonight well thank you for the word we heard we looked at all those texts Lord and seeing how Lord we can be clean and sanctified but yet fall away or draw back we can make such progress that if we fail to go forward we'll lose all that we've gained or we don't want to do that or even up continue on you press forward press on in Jesus Christ's name we want to keep running the race will lay aside anything that easily the senses when our houses cleaned out and fill with good things treasures hallelujah

people Lord that we would examine our lives here tonight store let us pray this do we lack anything we ask that surely if we ask like the rich over yo answered her go maybe we're like Joe if that's the case we'd say Lord that my character be weighed prove to others that I'm living a life of integrity although I'm suffering or going through difficult times give me strength for perseverance purge any branch that doesn't bring forth fruit and please vindicate my integrity because I've kept your word Alleluia Jesus you know you do it cuz your merciful you're faithful you're done you see the Bible revelations we see them by I will give it one pure picture thank you lesson two tonight tell my children have all the children the Church of all the adults they would have measure themselves by
