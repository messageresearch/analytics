========================================

just thought on my heart for a few weeks here it's kind of like I thought on prayer I thought I studying last night this morning yesterday I was kind of drawn to this thought so I like to at Ezekiel 22:30 I mentioned the scripture a few times you know I'd like to preach on God saw an intercessor God was seeking an intercessor God was seeking someone to pray so I can of be to preach on prayer this morning by God's Gra how many feel led to pray this morning praise God this is the House of Prayer Hallelujah you know we're Kings and Priests unto God labored on that lot believe that's God's desire for us eel 22 can let's read that ready one two three and i s for a man among them that should make up the Hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that I should not destroy it but I found amen that's have a word of prayer if you have need on your heart make it know to God here today Father God we come into your presence again we thank you Lord God for this moment of worship for this moment Lord God that's all we have is this moment right now Lord we're not guaranteed tomorrow all we have is the present and it has a a two-fold meeting lord it's also a gift this present time is a gift Lord God may we make the most of it Lord God may we draw nigh to you Lord God as you are certainly drawing nigh unto us Lord you are seeking someone you're seeking a people a bride a group of Believers that will do your will Lord God and we're convinced of that Lord by the scripture Lord I've just felt strangely to go this way so I just pray God that you'll Guide Me Lord may just yield to your Holy Spirit and father God May the needs of your people be met here Lord God lord we've lifted up many requests to you for healing for uh for for deliverance Lord God and I pray you'll minister to each and every need Lord God those near those far Lord God those close to the church those outside the church around the world Lord God I pray you Minister Lord and you will meet the needs of your people God I ask it and Lord help me your humble servant help us here all to receive from your word today in Jesus Christ's name Saint said amen amen God bless you as you're being seated you know Sunday or Wednesday rather we looked at U the book of Acts and we ended with uh stepen and I was just impressed again you know by the Holy Spirit I felt at the life of stepen especially that last statement he made before he died he said lay it not to their charge and I just thought it was so uh fitting you know that in his last breath he's praying for God to have mercy on his persecutors and what a what a testimony of the spirit of Christ in someone he's not asking for Revenge he's not asking for his enemies to be destroyed he's asking for his enemies to be forgiven and that's the true Spirit of Christ and so I just based upon that I kind of felt led to go this way I've had numerous thoughts try to bring some uh scriptures here on prayer today uh we're in the we'd say the most deceptive time there ever was brother random said you know the fourth Church age was the darkest time uh this is certainly a dark time uh as we said with Ohio you know Ohio is now going to allow you know these up to birth abortions and these uh gender change surgeries such wickedness such mutilation and uh such murder but in the midst of that we're to be the people that are righteous Moses God could only find one man I'm sorry Noah God could only find one man who was a preacher of righteousness and that him him and his church were the only ones that were saved now we know there's more than that in this day but brother uh he Likens that unto our day where Jesus said There Will Be Few that find it right very few that'll be hot and on fire for Christ how many want to be on fire for Christ amen that's what gets the fire going is prayer I was just going through many quotes this week about brother Brandon and he just kept saying you know get alone with God God spend time with God In Prayer be refreshed in God's presence and I think that's why we're here right I think that's why we come here to be with God Amen to shut out things from the world and to spend time talking it over with God speaking to God this is the house of prayer and so I've just felt compelled to go this way um so we look at this here like I said God sought out an intercessor I I've referenced this numerous times but I as I was studying I found different quotes from brother brandom and different uh uh comments from these uh preachers and we'll we'll kind of go through these here by God's grace I think I'll start with a few uh familiar scriptures John 4:23 uh but the hour cometh Jesus says and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth amen for the father seeketh such to worship him so God is uh God is today he's seeking true worshippers think about that his spirit is going over all these churches all these mega churches is and he's looking for true worshippers but Jesus said few will find that narrow road it's a it's a very narrow path not many people walk on it that's why we have hard time fellowshipping with even people that call themselves Christians because we're some of us uh we're not walking the same path I'm talking about some of your friends you walk a more narrow life than they do your life is more focused than theirs they can walk all these broad paths and they can do all these broad things and worldly things but the the the Bible says plainly very few will walk on this narrow road and I'm glad to be one of those that walk on the narrow road Hallelujah I want to stay on the narrow road by God's grace I want to just look at my life for 2024 I I want to look back for 2023 make sure were all my paths ordained of the Lord did I walk on all the right paths praise God and I want to fix them if there's anything wrong I want to get off the wrong path I want to get on the right path praise God I want to walk the narrow road heading into the the next year by God's grace and I'll be preaching some sermons I was Shar with brother amen yesterday Lord willing the next few weeks I'll be preaching just some uh sermons how brother Brandon would approach a new year and how he he said I had hundreds of invitations imagine that for us it' be hundreds of texts we have hundreds of texts come here come visit us come preach us how in the world uh could you could he meet all those some would say come for a week come for two weeks come for a month it's there's not enough days in the year so that's the thought I want to kind of labor on how do you deal with the overloaded to-do list right in other words brother R had overload loaded to do this he could never accomplish that so how did he deal with that so I want to show you later on by God's grace because it's just been a help to me but God today is he's looking for people in our church that will be true worshippers that will worship in the spirit and in truth praise God and then uh Second Chronicles 169 I love this this kind of gives us the uh the analogy or the metaphor uh God's eyes and I believe you know uh the holy spirit is here I believe you know the holy spirit is also here by the angels that are here amen the Bible says the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in behalf of those whose heart is perfect toward him praise God so God's eyes are here God's God's peing in here and who's truly worshiping who can I use for my glory who who is set apart and set aside so I can use them today amen I just think that's beautiful God was God's eyes came into your your home this morning and he's looking for true worshippers Hallelujah God came peeking in the church today he's looking for real worshippers amen hallelujah praise God Amen I'm glad he can find them here hallelujah amen if you need somebody to pray or need somebody to give or need somebody to intercede or whatever he may need of he's his eyes are here and he's watching and we just want to be yielded vessels that he can use today praise God Amen as we said on Wednesday not someone that will resist the Holy Spirit but someone that will yield and obey the Holy Spirit we don't want to resist uh you know giving into God's way we want to open up ourselves and we want to be obedient to God's way Hallelujah so we get this illustration that God's eyes are constantly watching us right Hallelujah and so uh we have this Foundation here now getting back to Ezekiel 22:30 I got a couple notes I want to make sure I put up here I want to start with this what scoffield said so if you put up Ezekiel 22:30 there hun thank you before I read this again you know uh here's what scoffield said about Ezekiel just to kind of give you some uh context Ezekiel was carried away to Babylon between the first and final deportation of Judah remember uh Nebuchadnezzar are ordered for all the Jews to be taken out except the very poorest because he said we got to have some people there that will you know tend to the crops and the The Vines and The Vineyards and everything like that uh so he left the porse of the people there and then he set somebody in charge but other than that he took out everyone everyone was taken out of the land because they mistreated the land instead of filling the land with righteousness they corrupted the land with idolatry so God said if you do that I'm taking you out of land because God doesn't play around right but God God was merciful God gave them so much time God gave them Prophet after Prophet God gave them sermon after sermon Hallelujah God gave them year after year king after King Hallelujah to try to bring them to repentance praise God and God was longsuffering but uh Ezekiel was like Daniel and the Apostle John he prophesied out of the land and his prophecy like theirs follows the method of symbols and visions unlike the pre-exilic prophets whose Ministry was primarily to either Judah or the 10 tribe Kingdom Ezekiel is the voice of Jehovah to the whole house of Israel so ezekiel's letters would be taken to and Scattered they'd be copied and they'd be scattered to all and sent to all the Israelites who were scattered and departed oh my and although there's judgment in there there's also Promises of God's mercy in there amen hallelujah praise God there's also promises where God said although I scattered you I'll bring you back to your land Hallelujah am I love it in the midst of God's correction in in the midst when God will might rebuke us he always offers hope in the midst of it Hallelujah he always offers uh opportunity for restoration Hallelujah because God loves his children Hallelujah am the purpose of ezekiel's ministry was to keep the generation born in Exile uh the national sins which had brought Israel so low so ezekiel's Ministry was to remind them here's your sins the this is what you've done and you need to repent of these sins Hallelujah he was also meant to sustain the faith of the Exiles uh by promising National restoration hallelujah we're still seeing it today we're still seeing God bringing back all these Jews back to their Homeland praise God that's exactly right God's word is is is sure God's word cannot fail Hallelujah amen and he promised them this National Glory restored one of the main uh phrases from this book is the hand of the Lord was upon meist church just remember you know whenever you're trying your best to obey the word of God God's spirit is on you amen right because the devil uh won't move you the devil won't try to anoint us or deceive us uh into obedience and as long as we're resisting sin that's God anointing us to resist sin amen hallelujah we may not feel it may not feel like maybe last Sunday morning or Wednesday night as far as like such a powerful presence but God is anointing you and leading you when you're trying to overcome your your sin your sin test right amen as you battle throughout the week that's God's anointing on you and here Ezekiel is the voice of God to them reminding them of their sins but promising them I'll bring you back hallelujah amen and so God's hand hand was upon him and church you know I'll just say like this too God's hand was on Ezekiel to tell them their sins God's hand is on you when you're telling other people their sins yeah so when you're sharing the gospel with people God's hand is upon you yesterday I I met with a young man he's 23 almost 24 I just felt compelled to this man and uh the girls were there and we had a good time uh but I was just telling I was I was telling him you know I wish when I was 23 somebody would have sat down and told me these things I I said I want to sit down and tell you these things I telling him about he's not married yet but all these scriptures about marriage he's like I believe you brother I believe you Mr calls me Mr Smith you don't call me brother I used to be his teacher many years ago but uh he was so thankful you know he's like wow these are the words of God he said I want to serve God and just an encouragement there was another stranger that was there and he looked at the children nature and virtue needed all the little children there he looked at all of them he said he said wow they are such well behaved children I said that's because they hear the word of God I said can I offer you a card you want my books he said I'll think about it so I got to give out three cards this week to people so I was really encouraged about that by God's grace you never know where your your your testimony is going to end up brother Raam said SE as many seeds he said as you can and he said on that day on the day of judgment we'll see where all of our efforts have gone to amen but you know when was warning him I was warning him in some places don't go this route go this route and so see CH that's how I know the spirit of God is upon me right that's how I know God's hand is on you when you're trying to point people to obedience to come out of the sins or uh to not make this mistake that's God's love that was God's love on Ezekiel for Israel come out of your sin don't go that route go this route praise God trust in God Amen so God's spirit is upon us we may not not feel it all the time like God's hand is on us for miracles and or maybe raising the dead or something but if we're trying to get people to obey the word of God if we're trying to teach people in righteousness then surely God's hand is upon us that's what it was for Ezekiel Hallelujah so that's a little background on Ezekiel I remember Simon years ago preached on uh the open book and that's what Ezekiel had Ezekiel had the saw the Revelation the early chapters of Ezekiel of the book that was open I want to look at a few thoughts here this is from John Gil I was uh reading this man he's a preacher from the 1800s of course and he said the Bible says I sought A man among them and uh the scripture or I'm sorry the history says God was seeking A man among the princes and the priests and the prophets and the people of the land who acted the part as as uh the faithful he said otherwise no doubt there were good people in the land as Jeremiah baroo and others but not among these so he gives a point there when Ezekiel wrote this there were good people in the Land There was Jeremiah there was baroo remember baroo he's the one that wrote out Jeremiah's letters he gave to the king the king threw him away Jeremiah said write them again hallelujah amen the word of God will not return boy hallelujah amen so they were good people there and God wasn't saying there was not anybody there but God wanted other people that were there God wanted not just the prophet Jeremiah or baroo the faithful scribe God wanted other people so outside of the righteous God was looking is there anybody else that will intercede for me is there anyone else that will will will pray for those who are are in sin Hallelujah he said is there anyone that would make up the Hedge now hedge of course means kind of to put up a wall again so so uh this this wall this hedge had been broken down by the transgress RS of the people so there was no more law there was no more Justice doesn't that sound like America cities like de Democratic cities there's no more law and Justice a lot of them you know in New York and different uh Chicago uh San Francisco different places they can do some awful crimes usually they be locked up but they just let them they just book them and they let them back out those places will be under the wrath of God because that's what happened in the Bible he said where's a man that will make up the Hedge where's a man that will restrain people from sinning that will reform them or set a good example where's a man whose works are good works where's a man that will stand in the gap before me for the land that I should not destroy it where's a man who that will repair the breach restore good pth Hallelujah who will intercede like Abraham interceded for Sodom right and we'll get some examples of some intercors intercessors rather today and I thought you know that scripture came to me Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen if God was seeking a man then who would uh men in women I'll say that that would pray for the people to overcome their sins if God was seeking in that day then God seeking that today hallelujah amen God seeking people today now I want to go through some script uh if you she set that okay thank no problem if you got your bible Jeremiah 5:1 this is a repeated story uh a repeated uh problem in the days of Ezekiel and Jeremiah there was less and less people that wanted the government and the people to live holy and God was find having trouble finding people that would pray for the sins of the the community that's why I've always encourage you to do that Jeremiah 5 verse1 run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem and see now and know now notice he doesn't say walk he says run what does run mean urgency amen because we don't know when it's our last day on Earth right so he says run run to and fro on the streets of Jerusalem and and know and seek and seek in the broad places thereof if you can find them if there be any that execute judgment and seeks the truth and will pardon I wonder this morning how many people read their Bible one of my children said how come there's nobody on the road today and I thought it's a shame there they should be going to church right but I wonder how many people read their Bible this morning who's seeking truth who read their Bible last night you know who who's seeking who wants more truth amen that that's that's the situation that that Jeremiah and Ezekiel uh they they found Israel they've got the word of God they've got a house built for for Jehovah but who's actually seeking more of Jehovah right God told Jeremiah run run through the city go to the broad places try to find somebody that's seeking truth and I'll pardon them I'll forgive them hallelujah oh what a what a blessing amen amen what a blessing for us we know if we're seeking God God will pardon us hallelujah amen in other words whatever you seeking life that's what you'll get that's why we keep seeking the Holy Spirit we keep seeking forgiveness we keep seeking Miracles cuz God said if you seek me you shall find me hallelujah amen what a blessing amen now look at verse uh now look this is the kind of people they met just like today Jeremiah 5:2 and though they say the Lord lives surely they swear falsely how many people say well I love Jesus I'm a Christian but they're lying right through their teeth right same thing today verse three oh Lord are not Thine Eyes Upon the truth and church what is the message the message is the true Bible restoration the message a message church is a church that TR preaches the truth about the Bible Hallelujah right so we are so God's eyes are on us amen thou Hast stricken them but they have not grieved thou has consumed them but they have refused to receive correction they have made the their face is harder than a rock they refused to return now again let's let's do the opposite of that let's always return to God when we make mistakes amen let's make our our faces lovely toward the lord as I've told you you know I preached to people over the years they can you can tell they're mad at me you know what whatever I'm preaching whatever offended them but let's have a let's have a countenance you know Cain the Bible said Cain left the presence of God with an angry countenance let's not have an angry countenance let's have a count full of mercy and love amen so Israel didn't have that in in this time and they couldn't receive correction the sermons didn't change anything no matter what the preacher preached on it wouldn't change their lives God help us to have lives that are lined up to the word of God hallelujah amen accept correction right if God brings it if God CHS you to do something let's do it praise God said let's be up and at it one of those quotes I'm going to read is brother Brandon was talking about this young man he said he was a nice man a handsome man but he just wandered from church to church from I think it was down in Alabama he just went from place to place and brother R would ask him you know what what are you doing he said nothing where you plan to go next nowhere and brother R said what a shame he's just wandering you know their life is wandering there's no Direction brother Ram said be up and at it he said find a goal for Christ do something for Christ hallelujah amen have a goal in life and there's that quote brother says I just found this week he said the Christian ought to be the most ambitious person in the whole world Amen am ambitious means you're eager to do something amen like if I said uh who's ambitious to go get some pizza after service well there'd be a lot of ambitious people right I'd be one of them right you or if you're really hungry and I'll say who's ambitious getting line for some pizza get lined for some Chipotle well we e all night right up right cuz we're hungry well that's what brother says spiritually we should be ambitious to win souls so that's what I feel like a a refreshing here uh like a rededication for this 2024 like I want to give out my cards I want to invite more people to church I want to help people along the way I want to meet up with people and try to tell them and warn them about the word of God I I want to be more focused on other people praise God and not myself hallelujah amen so we can see the condition here this was already being built up God said God told Jeremiah you go run try to find someone who's believe in the truth and then we know by Ezekiel that God could not find any outside of Jeremiah and baroo outside of the regular Believers that were living righteously so he's seeking that today you've heard me say this before but if if if if if you put all of Ohio in darkness right but you just put a light from heaven on the on the churches that really preach the truth how many lights would there be over Ohio right there would imagine there wouldn't be too many but we'd have a little light shining in acon Praise Goden because we're against murder right we're against uh adulteries and fornications and and homosexuality we're against what God is against in other words we're for what God is for hallelujah amen and God's light is shining on us and so so the emphasis should be for us is to to intercede for others to try to get more people to walk upon this narrow way hallelujah amen amen he said I'm seeking I'm seeking for a man that will stand in the Gap Hallelujah in other words there's people think about this m mercy so sad there's people that God's over here and they're way over there if they're far from God and God wants somebody to come and stand and say let's come together here now think about that in your families right we have some family members that are this far that far away and then there's and God wants somebody to stand in between and let's come together let's try to bring healing to the situation right so think of this the world you know your friends our family members our co-workers our neighbors there's a gap between them and God and God wants somebody to stand in the Gap and try to bring them close to God hallelujah amen amen I'll tell you like this I just want to be open to doing whatever God wants me to do if that means going across the street to my neighbors who voted yes for this awful abortion and maybe giving them some Christmas cookies then I want to do that you see what I mean I haven't planned that but I'm just thinking of it now how can I stand in the gap between a person who's far from God how can I do it God has to leave me praise God but I got to be willing to go Hallelujah like Jeremiah I gotta be willing to run and find is there anyone that wants a doe truth is there anyone that wants to serve the Lord hallelujah amen amen amen like I said I gave out three of my cards you know this week I only got turned down one time that's pretty good I got 75% success rate praise God I went to Giant eag and the first guy I saw he said I don't want that okay God bless you sir but then when I checked out this lady she oh I like that I'll pass that on to somebody else I was thinking well why don't you read it but at least she took it by God's grace but I want to be more intentional because you never know when you might be that person like a Ben Gandy praise God like a Benjamin Gandy you might never never know when you might be that person Hallelujah to tell somebody about the message hallelujah amen glory you never know so we want to be uh we want to be focus on the Lord we want to have uh we want to always have the Lord set before us praise God we want to pray without ceasing God use these next few moments Lord use my afternoon use this service for your Glory hallelujah amen now so God s just like God God was telling Jeremiah go find someone but there's other verses here God told Ezekiel I'm looking for a man and he couldn't find any think of that he couldn't find anybody who was praying about the transgender situation think about that for our day he couldn't find anybody that was praying to end abortion you couldn't find anybody praying for the wars to end for God to have mercy on Israel thank God he can find it here praise God he couldn't find that and so that grieved God's heart now I want to look at some of the men and women who stood in the Gap so go to numbers 25 you're probably familiar with this but just kind of a rehearsal I just found there's such strength in rehearsing things that I forgotten about like I shared that brother Samuel shared a quote with me after service and here reminded me that brother brandom had a 9-day sinus infection anybody ever had a nay sinus infection his he had a fever all nine days and brother R couldn't preach the meetings he got so discouraged he went to his wife and said am I even called to preach you know what mea said brother R said she kind of rebuked me she said you need to keep quiet don't say things like that said I appreciate a woman a wife like that and so I put that on YouTube you and got over a th views in one week brother Ram's wife rebuked him don't talk like that of course you're called of God hallelujah now sisters I'm not telling you go home to rebuke your husbands or vice versa hubbies don't rebuke your wife unless you be a l of the Lord right but that was just I forgotten about that I was like oh that's right and then you know God brother man went and prayed about it Jesus showed him a vision well you haven't accepted the third poll and then as soon as he got a vision he was instantly healed the sign of infection n Day science infection and of course of course we're called of God but with such an encouragement in our moments of sickness and our moments of Doubt God's going to put somebody there to to straighten us out praise God Amen to encourage us of course you're called of God of course you're a Christian Hallelujah you're just walking through the valley of the shadow of death but I'm with you hallelujah amen and I'm walking through it praise God Amen I'll get through this eventually praise God Amen but that was such an encouragement to me I thought wow I forgot about that even a man like brother Brandon we've seen thousands of millions of people saved and healed even he doubt it am I even called to preach because of a failure of one meeting Hallelujah we know God doesn't fail hallelujah amen amen uh numbers 257 now those of you know this this is of course um this is the Bale poror and S this is when balum invited all these Israelites over and there was uh fornication he taught them how to commit fornication so not get married but have sexual sin God killed 24,000 of them now this types out to the third the third out of the four steps of the four horse riders I preached a few weeks ago the doctrine of balum so balam's Doctrine was we're all the same we can all worship together I think we all know there's a difference between a message service and a Baptist service right amen CU we've been to a couple this year haven't we thank God for it right thank God there's something being done but we can all see the difference praise God right where you know in the Baptist Church you can't really step on people's toes well by God's grace uh God can step on any of our toes Hallelujah if there's something wrong with my life clean me out Lord God hallelujah correct me I'm your child I want to be correct I don't want to be wrong Hallelujah there's a difference amen of course there's a difference but fineas he sees these these these men these Jewish men taking the moabit women and laying with them they're not even married and the Bible said in verse seven okay I'm actually reading verse six yeah Moses said verse five MOS said slay every one of them that were joined to Bor all right and then they're weeping yeah verse six they're weeping about what's happened here verse 7 and when Phineas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest saw it rose up from among the congregation he took a javelin in his hand and went after the man of Israel into the tent and thrust both of them through the man of Israel and the woman threw her belly so the plague was stained from the children of Israel and those that died in the plague were 20 and 4,000 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Phineas now here's what God's opinion is of Phineas who did this very violent act with the spear now we don't do that naturally but that's what we should do spiritually amen I'll say that again amen any sin that we have in our lives we should get a spiritual spear it's called the word of God hallelujah and try to end that sin as soon as we cared in our lives Hallelujah that's what God wants us to do not let it lay not get into addictions and habits for weeks and months and then years and then decades not go that route but stop the plague stop the sin hallelujah amen so what does God do God said Finas in verse 11 the son of Aaron the priest had turned my wrath away from the children of Israel while he was zealous for my sake among them that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy wherefore say behold I give unto him my Covenant of Peace REM reminds me of that song whose side are you standing on standing on the Lord's Side that's another verse we'll get to later by God's grace but look at verse 13 He says and he shall have it and his seed after him even the Covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was zealous for his God and made an atonement for the children of Israel so here's a man standing in the Gap right all these people are sinning and this this sin is spreading like a disease it's just spreading well and remember this Israelite man he was a prince he was a high he was a popular uh message believer and if he could do this sin well then everybody could do this sin and Phineas raised up and said no it's got to stop it's got to stop here and I'm just the one to stop it praise God Amen so he took the spear thrust them both through and God said I'm making this man a priest forever praise God amen amen amen because he stood in the Gap he stopped the sin he stopped the influence amen he knew that we should be living right and so he made an effort to do it right Hallelujah amen amen remember God in ezekiel's time he couldn't find a man that would do that right so it just goes to show very few people will stand up and tell the truth God help us to always tell the truth amen I like what brother Samuel said he said brother Justin got a lot of energy he's got a lot of zeal I said may God help me to always have that I don't want my I know sometimes my Zeal is up my wisdom but I want to I want to I want to be on the side where I'm zealous for you know why that because of this you know why I want people to call me zealous because of that praise God I don't mind being the strict Church I'd rather be the strict Church than the loose Church hallelujah amen glory let them drive past our church I just keep waving you keep going there Hallelujah you just go where you're led by the Holy Spirit but for me and my house we'll serve the Lord hallelujah we won't let them make up in we won't let the high heels in we won't let the tight dresses in or brothers we won't let the shorts in Hallelujah go wherever you want to go Hallelujah but let's have Zeal for the ways of God Amen Moses in uh Exodus 3210 if you go there Exodus 32:10 I just had a thought there Exodus 32:10 Exodus 32:10 I'm looking up a quote here get to there it is okay got it thank you now of course you know the story this is right after the uh the Ten Commandments were revealed Moses went back up I'm sorry Moses went up he received the Ten Commandments written on Stone and he comes down and God said God told him the people have already turned aside I think he was up there 40 days right and the people had already turned back to idolatry and he and Aaron and Joshua were coming down and joshu was like I hear the noise of war and Moses said it's actually the singing of the people yeah and the Bible said uh they sat down to eat and Rose up to play now that play is the flirting word because it's the same word that Isaac played with Rebecca he was flirting with her although they're already married see brother sometimes it's okay to flirt with your wife there so other words just be romantic that's what I mean but when Moses come down here they were being flirtatious and they weren't married and they had I had a golden calf set up and they're dancing and singing to to the wrong music right right and then later because this Aaron he strips some of their clothes and he breaks that calf right grounds the calf into pieces makes him drink it and then dumps it in the the water MH right and then Aaron puts the blame on them but was to blame right he should not let it happen MH right and to me as I was reading this you know let's read uh verse 10 it reminded me of that Vision brother brand sorry brother brandom had of the rock and roll in America so this is the closest Bible story I can find to the vision brother random had of America dancing the rock and roll Exodus 32 sorry I wasn't in the wrong chapter verse 10 let's go to verse uh yeah verse 10 he says now therefore let me alone that my wrath May Wax Hot against them and that I may consume them and I'll make of thee a great nation look at that God says I'll destroy all them but I'll start with you Moses what an offer right what an offer kind to remind you of Abraham right that's what God did with Abraham so I'll consume all idolators but I'll start a brand new church with you Moses and Moses besought the Lord his God and said Lord why do thy wrath Wax Hot against thy people which thou has brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand wherefore should the Egyptians speak and say for Mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the Earth turn from thy Fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people now of course God was not doing evil right he's saying repent of this uh wrath that you're going to I'm sorry change your mind on this wrath that you're going to do right God never has to repent God never has to say I'm sorry God never say I made a mistake but this word repent just means to turn and go a different direction right God is never sorry for anything he does the church said amen and as we know what brother talks about this I'll mention that just a moment remember Abraham Isaac and Israel thy servants to whom thou swearest by th own self and sest unto them I'll multiply your seed as the stars of Heaven and all this land that I spoken of will I give unto your seed and they shall inherit it forever and the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people and then he pours out the discipline after that verses 15 uh down to 28 and you probably know the story but here brother Ram you know tells us he said for for many years I wondered how could Moses have a better idea than God it looked like God corrected Moses because God I'm sorry it looked like Moses corrected God because God said destroy them but Moses said no no no don't and then God repented of it but brother said I found out later this was Moses acting like Christ amen Moses asked God to forgive all the Israelites that's what Christ did amen Christ stood and asked for mercy upon all of us hallelujah other words we're here because Christ interceded for us just like they were there because Moses stood in the Gap hallelujah amen amen hallelujah well I used to think God in the Old Testament was mad at me but Jesus loved me he said I found out they're one the same person praise God Amen this looks like God's Wrath but God is just showing this is my this is how I have to act towards everybody because all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God and I've got to have mercy upon everyone hallelujah amen and I'll do it by one man and of course for us that's Jesus Christ hallelujah amen amen amen now friends as I said this is the closest story I can find in the Bible that connects to brother R's vision of America let me read it from 1964 recognizing your day and its message brother saw said I saw a preview of a lovely little bride in a vision a voice by the side of me said here's the preview of the of the Bride she came by she was very lovely pretty and young she was walking just the step as she could not a March just a stride of a woman how they walk gracefully ladylike that's the way she was walking coming to my left of the side and she went out of my side then he turned to me the right side and he showed me each Church age as theyve I'm sorry each church as they come out of the ages and I said oh how vulgar and the last one was this last day Church age which was led by a witch some people try to like find who's the witch of America well there's a whole bunch of them right Beyonce Oprah there's a whole bunch of them why you start naming any famous women like that they're witches they are yeah because they do uh demon they do demon sacrifice he said and they were so immorally dressed so filthy looking and they were marching to the time of twist and rock and roll now that's why we've been preaching on music because this church saw them dancing to rock and roll he said they were th these women were just throwing themselves with twists and holding this just gray paper he says it's a deceiving color holding in front of them with lace likee hula skirts around them in the front and completely Ned from the waist up and they're marching carrying that carrying on with that music and the voice said that is the church and when it passed by my heart liked to faint I thought is this what it's trying to be presented to Christ as a bride of all the efforts and thing that a man has put forth to try to bring forth the bride for Christ and a vulgar dirty looking prostitute like that to be the bride of Christ it made me sick at my heart I think about that church all the years he preached all the prayer lives all the traveling and he thought is this what my Ministry has produced now that ought to be encouraging church when when someone compliments your children or someone compliments you you ought to be encouraged that you're doing the right thing praise God right because it's because you're following the ways of the Lord so I take the opposite of that if if people are encouraged by your testimony then thank God you're walking the ways of God hallelujah amen amen he saysi not responsible for these things I can only say what I seen and God is my judge that was a church from the USA and as she passed by the whole back part had no covering at all so she was almost naked on the back he said I felt faint and sickly and then he said the bride will come into preview again and here the bride came behind her the very same looking bride that passed by at the beginning then my heart jumped for joy to know that there will be a bride and she'll be made of the the same thing and Clos with the same thing that was the one at was at the beginning she is to be called and I know that this is the truth if that isn't true then every Vision I've ever had in the back has been wrong and anyone knows not one thing he's ever told us was the truth hallelujah and the church said amen hallelujah isn't that beautiful brother saw the original book of Acts church and then the American Church came by he said but then the original Church came again and she was just like the book of Acts that why I feel led to preach on the supernatural book of Acts church we are continuation of that we are part of that praise God amen amen I listed 14 things I can probably show you 20 or 30 things where we are just the same as the book of Acts church not something different just more of the same hallelujah amen amen but look at the connection you have a a naked woman dancing the rock and roll and there in Moses presence you have them with music and nakedness and dancing to idolatry yeah remember Brother Sam preach which we've been preaching to is that music creates a powerful atmosphere right Hallelujah so we heard all these songs today to prepare us for this word today amen amen then we'll hear songs at the end to prepare us to act upon what we heard let's not just be hearers let's be doers of the word of God amen amen glory doers of the word of God so we seen vine stand the Gap Moses stood the Gap I remember Samuel send the Gap brother Jim preached it very well the hither to God hallelujah remember the children of Israel I I'll just read 1st Samuel 7:8 and the children of Israel said to Samuel cease not to cry unto the Lord Our God for us that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines so God God expects the leaders to pray right but God also expects everyone else to pray as well amen amen Hallelujah so St Samuel stood in the gap for the people and he constantly prayed for the people and asked God to help them so Samuel stood in the gap for them even when they were wrong and wanted a king the love of God anointed Samuel to say listen he's going to take your daughters he's going to take your sons he's going to take your land but they said we want a king anyway but Samuel was there to tell them the truth when you tell someone the truth it's you standing in the gap for themen Hallelujah before they make the good decision before they make bad decision whatever decision they make when you stand there and tell the truth you are God's intercessor hallelujah amen that's right Hallelujah me now um if you would go to Psalms 106 ver 23 just a few verses here this one is again about Moses here what Moses did one more note I want look at Hallelujah Psalm 10623 therefore he said that he would destroy them had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath lest he should destroy them yay they despised the pleasant land they believe not his word but murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord hallelujah now remember the Bible said God would not let them in the land because 10 times they complain before the Lord 10 times 10's the number of the law right so the law I'll give you 10 chances and they missed it they complain too much okay but see something we got to learn here we got to learn to always say good things about people amen don't let gossip come into your home because here murmur murmuring came into their tents right and this led them to complain hallelujah amen and God didn't like it right right God was to be thankful I think we heard that last we and everything give be Hallelujah am don't look you can you can look either the negative or the positive let's look at the positive praise God Amen let's see what Good's going to come out of this hallelujah amen amen not to murmur and complain my dad used to call belly ache he said don't belly ache Jesse he used to tell me he said you laugh at pain that's what he told me joking around and tell my children that the other day you know little ones they fall and get hurt I said laugh at pain it's just a joke but in other words you you can't let all the pain get you down you got to have hope praise God Amen there's you know complaining about it is not going to help anything right you know my wife and I recently had an interesting financial situation I made a Big Blooper uh with my insurance at work I forgot to turn in this form and so we're going to see how it works out just hopefully I can tell a testimony on Wednesday but I forgot to turn this form in that meant my insurance was going to go go up $3,500 just because I forgot to turn one I got there was four things to turn in I did three of them I forgot one of them and on the day I saw that email my heart sunk I felt like my heart went down to my stomach I was like how many Financial mistakes can I make I broke my car I broke the lawn mower this year I said how many more can I make what's wrong with me somebody SLA me I was just I I put in the scanner and I sent it going to send it off and then some life happened I got distracted and my wife said as soon as she got that she would she said okay that's why God led me to fast today my wife was fasting for me I didn't even know it and so then I emailed the gentleman a few days later he said well looks like things are going to turn out okay I think they're going to uh they said uh we haven't had many people get Mercy in this situation but we feel like you might get Mercy in this situation so I'm asking God for Mercy but look you know God had my wife anointed to f F and pray and she's wonder why am I fasting why am I praying and then the answer came so God knows what we have need of praise God and we're going to make mistakes but there's no reason for me to complain about it right right now now my mind just goes to oh why am I such a failure why do I do this why it's not going to help the situation right what's going to help is say crying out to God and get God have mercy on me amen hallelujah so hopefully they have mercy on if not better not complain Hallelujah but see here God says Moses stood in the Gap and because Moses interceded God's Wrath went away because somebody s the Gap now go to Jeremiah 11 honey if you pull up Jeremiah 11:11 here's a uh here's an item that uh one of the commentators had Jameson fet and brown has three men that wrote A Commentary around used their commentary a couple times and the Bible said I found none but Jeremiah 11:1 says therefore thus sayith the Lord behold I'll bring evil upon them Israel which they shall not be able to escape and though they shall cry to me I will not hearken to them verse 12 then shall the cities of Judah and the habitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto their the gods unto whom they offer incense but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble verse 13 for according to the number of thy cities were thy Gods oh Jud now think about that every city that that was in Jerusalem every city that was in Israel had their own separate God that's how much that's how much idolatry was in that land I mean just totally filed now that's what we got today right there's gods of of riches there's gods of abortion you know murdering the children uh of of Financial Freedom there's gods of of immorality name it you name it any sin any sin that people love it's just an i in their lives and the land was filled with it now look at verse 14 here's what I want to get to because I thought this was striking when I saw this I instantly I was kind of like shocked and I then thought this quote from brother Brandon therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up a cry or prayer for them did you catch that God's telling the prophet don't pray for this people now that reminds us there is a sin we don't pray for that's when someone blasphemes the Holy Ghost you don't pray for that right the Bible tells us but here Israel got to such a spot where there's Idols it just it's all idolatry thank God church you can walk into your home and it don't have to be Idols there amen thank God you can walk in this church and there's not idolatry here hallelujah praise God Amen pray not for this people for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me for their trouble now that stuck out to me wow God told the prophet not to pray but then God with Ezekiel a few years later was saying I'm looking for somebody to pray amen so did God change his mind no God had Jeremiah not to pray because he was already a righteous man and because God was determined to pour out the Judgment but before God would allow that to be poured out God wanted to see is there anybody else that that's seeking after God is there anyone that will prolong my Mercy amen is there anyone else that will keep crying out for Longs suffering before I pour out the Wrath is there anybody else that will stand the Gap Hallelujah is there any other phases out there is there any Moses out there hallelujah amen amen amen God told Jeremiah you're done but I look for other people that will pray is there anybody else that will intercede and cry out to God hallelujah amen amen in 1965 trying to do God of service brother B said America God Bless America it's a nation it's a Christian country he said it's a million miles from being a Christian country right when Biden flies the homosexual Flag by the White House it's a me well Obama did the same thing it's a million miles from being a Christian country brother R says I don't even pray for it how can I pray for it and it won't repent under the mighty powers of God demonstr before it and denying and closing the doors to it and walking away he said I committed to God I thought wow what a perfect parallel Jeremiah and brother Brenham refused to pray for the country but God still gives us more time amen amen God's had long suffering it's been 58 years since brother man went off the scene and God is still looking today God's still looking for somebody that will sigh and cry for the Abominations done in this city praise God Amen I thought it was astounding God told B prophets don't pray for the nation but God's looking for other people today that aren't prophets and the church said amen that means you that means me God's looking for all of us to intercede and say God have mercy on this land help me to do righteously help me to do something about it praise God Amen that's what brother R says Don't Drift in your life uh just don't Drift from place to place have a direction where you're going brother R said do something about this condition I'll preach those quotes maybe Wednesday or next Sunday said just don't sit and be tossed and drift around your life do something about the the evil amen and if it's even in one's person life make a difference in one person's life praise God I've been inspired by that this week Hallelujah so God told Jeremiah don't pray for it brother Ram said I don't even pray for it but that doesn't mean we stop praying for it because God's still looking for a witness in this time amen hallelujah remember I read this to you not long ago Souls that are in prisoned now brother said how do you know you might he said uh how do you know it might be your righteous life that's holding the wrath of God from the world today and he's using Abraham as the example it was Abraham's prayer for lot that held back lot from being destroyed right amen because God remembered Abraham and God remember Abraham's seed right God will remember your prayers brother Amen brother Jose God will remember your prayers amen because God remembered Abraham's prayers that's Genesis 19 I'm going to read that Genesis 1929 he said the world won't believe it you women that's called holy rooll you little man that hardly don't know anything but you cry to God d and night for the sins of the country you might be the one that's holding off the wrath of God Amen he said if I can find 10 if I can find 30 he said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the days of the son of man see what I mean Hallelujah so church this just an admonition to keep praying this is an admonition for me like I said I'm I'm trying to see I'm trying to let the Lord teach me how I can have an impact on more people how I can serve other people instead of myself Genesis 19:29 and it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remembered Abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt Hallelujah I believe it is our prayers that's holding back the back the wrath of God don't you Hallelujah I've had different people tell me you know how they appreciate my family or me and I I always say give the credit to my mother's prayers give the credit to my grand grandparents prayers amen because it wasn't praying for me while I was dabbling in sin it wasn't me praying it was my mama praying right amen hallelujah who is praying for you well we know for our church our little girls were praying for Austin for five years Hallelujah so are you see somebody was praying for you and God remembered them well now it's our turn we got to pray so God can remember our prayers hallelujah amen amen like I said the testimony of Stephen he said Lord lay not this sin to their charge he interceded for Saul standing right there in the midst of him and church he was so humble he even kneeled down and prayed that's why sometimes we'll sing about bowing down when do we ever bow down though that's why sometimes I'll bow down when are we that sincere to know some of you do it every servant which is good I'm talking about each one of us like how can we be as sincere as possible praise God God that's what we want to do we want to be sincere and so Stephen in his think about that his last moments on Earth he gets out on his knees and doesn't ask for him he asking for other people hallelujah that's the real Spirit of Christ amen that's a real man God was seeking after a man who would stand the Gap and intercede for Saul who was going to turn into St Paul Hallelujah getting on his knees and praying that God would forgive others that's what we need today Hallelujah now go to uh Ezekiel n I've mentioned this over and over again and preach it over and over again it's important for us to do that Ezekiel 9:4 all right and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city go through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the Abominations that be done the midst and to the others he said in mine hearing go after ye him through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have you pity slay utterly young and old both maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at My Sanctuary they which began at the ancient men I'm sorry then they began at the ancient men which were before the house so here God is pouring out wrath upon Jerusalem this is what God was going to do right when Nebuchadnezzar came in he was going to kill everything right scatter take away everything was going to be destroyed but God said started the church in other words the people that know the most have the most responsibility amen you and I we know the most about the Bible we have the most responsibility then you obey the Bible praise God Amen Hallelujah now that should remind you of uh 1 Peter 4:17 right this is a verse I shared with my friend yesterday 1 Peter 4:17 for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first begin at us what shall the end of them that obey not the gospel if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and The Sinner appear so see we get the same idea God judges first at the church in both the Old Testament and the New Testament amen that ought to make us thankful praise God amen amen hallelujah but also makes us be responsible right the more we hear the more responsible that that we have the more faithful we should be with what we've had amen God make us faithful today Hallelujah cuz God's going to start right here God's going to start the church where we hear the the word of God and what we've heard we must obey we must believe hallelujah amen the righteous scarc course that's speaking of the foolish version like lot if the righteous scares to be saved where should the Sinner and the ungodly appear remember lot was the one who just he called homosexuality uh wickedness he had enough Grace to say that and God said he was scarcely saved he wasn't like Abraham who was way separated from it God help us to live totally separated from Sodom Hallelujah amen amen where does judgment begin right at the house of God I'll answer for what I preached but Raam said I'll Stand before God and I'll answer for the Bible that I preach amen thank God hallelujah thank God for Amazing Grace hallelujah amen there's my hour now back to Ezekiel see God wants us to sign cry and brother said that there there's a writer ink horn in other words a man had an ink pen and that ink pen represent the Holy Spirit writing upon the Believers who sighed and cried for the Abominations that were down the seity if abortion doesn't make us cry something's wrong with us right if homosexuality doesn't make us cry and weep something's wrong with us in the church say if mutilation of children don't make us cry something's wrong with us hallelujah amen is that what the Bible says something's wrong see that's why I don't I just I don't want to drip through life I want to have God's heart I want to hear God's heartbeat amen like that song I want to lay up next to his heart I want hear what is God heart what is his heart saying his heart is saying I'm looking for somebody that'll stand the Gap I'm looking for somebody that will live righteously I'm looking for somebody that will sigh and cry for the Abominations that will keep praying that will keep trying to win souls amen amen praise God hallelujah now remember this was all result of what had happened in the previous chapter so I want to uh show something if I can find it here real quick yeah case you go and switch over here I just had just a simple remember I showed this one here not long ago I preached on uh yeah the Deeds of nickus remember that one remember remember that service it was it Wednesday night yeah Wednesday night little while ago remember there's four steps to the the process of the Antichrist religion so basically uh devil religion right it's Jezebel religion like the Roman Catholic church today is the modern example but also it was foreshadowed by those the the insects out of Joel chapter 1 and chapter 2 and I forgot about this but um I added another column for today because the Reason God said start of the sanctuary was because in chapter 8 of Ezekiel God showed Ezekiel there was four levels of wickedness in the in the Tabernacle the first step was at the anry of the church was an image of jealousy right that's in uh Ezekiel chapter 8 so God is a jealous God and Israel put up some image so right when you walk in the door you're already breaking the word of God in idolatry isn't that what they got a lot today they got a lot of big mega churches and signs and they'll call themselves like my goodness Lord have mercy I know the pastor of the church that has that homosexual flag right outside right outside the Church of Christ I know the pastor I just saw him this week that's an image of jealousy right you put up an idol right out there that's an idol of sin and this is why God was going to send forth all the Slayers in the city but he's starting at the church because they know the Bible right next was God took Ezekiel further in and on all the walls was abomination of Beast walls are salvation right walls are separation so the Abominations were all over the walls meaning there was no separation between them and Abominations oh God keep us clean amen I a man youa me this week he said can you preach a sermon on sanctification I'm like I do that every service amen huah but maybe I'll do that tonight or something with the young ones so I can make a recording for this guy but just emphasize ING with a a new heart new spirit God's spirit amen the new spirit is where you have walls of Salvation I'm separated uh from Pride I'm separated from lust I'm separated from anger and fear and riches and I'm separated from all that I got walls of Salvation hallelujah amen I'm protected by God I'm delivered Hallelujah and there's Holiness in this house hallelujah thank God Hallelujah now the third one was interesting I to look it up that's one I was looking up here tamuz the women were crying for tamuz tamuz was uh an an uh it was an idol it was a false god and he was kind of like the promised son so it's like an imitation of of Jesus right Satan's imitation of Jesus and so these women these women every time uh the fall equinox or the winter equinox would happen they would cry because it's going to it's winter time's going to come and so that's why these women were crying winter time was coming and it was a it was a festival it was a holiday it's kind of like Halloween or something like that or Santa Claus the women were participating in that and the further you got into the presence of God the more idolatry they were and and the Bible says they were weeping over winter and this Festival rather than weeping for all the sins that were in the city see Church some people say I don't have emotions for God that's a lie you can watch a video on YouTube and you'll cry yeah I watched one this morning and I cried this man went uh he's a he's a talk show host guy he's a Christian guy he talks about posi he went to the the the poorest city in Alabama and set up a a a free Christmas gift place and they gave this little boy one of those uh uh police cars that you drive around what are they call the Tonka cars what do they call it your boy's got one James got one what do they call those electric cars power Power Wheels that's it power they got the battery they gave him one a police car cuz his dad was a police officer and he got murdered there in the city and this this YouTuber he bought he bought all these kids in the whole town whatever Christmas toy they wanted I just started weeping and crying like what an act of kindness right but I'll cry over that in the church in other words we're so easily give our emotions to things but we also we must give our best emotions to God hallelujah and if we're if we're getting hardened toward God we got to get say God soften my heart like that song says break my heart for what breaks yours amen hosan I think break my heart for what breaks yours Hallelujah and God's rebuking them he's showing Ezekiel look they got images they've got Abominations they're crying over a false idol rather than crying for the sins that are done in the midst of the people the last thing he shows them remember he shows them the elders all the elders they had their backs turned from the Ark of the Covenant and they're all worshiping the son the the just the very uh the very epitome of abomination worshiping the creation rather than the Creator amen this is why God said and this is happening where in the house of God and this is why God said said I'm going to pour out my wrath upon this place but God said I'm still looking for somebody that'll sigh and cry for the Abominations church we don't know how long we're going to be here I'm going to take that off like I said we've been here 58 years since brother R passed the generation that knew brother brandom is dying out swiftly 202 24 will be 59 years since brother R died 2024 will also be the 118th year of the lean Church age making it longer than the Ephesian Church age so officially brother bang our church age is not the shortest anymore everybody thought it was everybody thought this would be the shortest Church age well here we go com a couple weeks now all these people that predicted things look see that's why we don't want to make predictions right right it's okay to make our opinions about things but let's not stuff let's not be a stuff shirt like I know everything about it let's be humble hallelujah we're coming up on 59 years and then 118 years of the lean Church age and if if God does it the same way here in America as God did in Israel then God is going to wait till there's no more people signing and crying for the Abominations right other than Jeremiah baroo the real Godly Christians but then God told Jeremiah don't pray for it anymore see he's the same yesterday today and forever Lord willing Wednesday I'll read another quote brother ra said the greatest thrill of my life he said is serving others living for others the greatest thrill of my life it's living for other people and I want to say this not the people that it's easy to live for it's the people that's hard to live actually I'll read it right now brother talking he talking with his doctor he said for all these years 31 years of ministry now I've only got 19 in I preach been preaching 19 you got 31 he said I kept my heart prepared for the hour when he Jesus comes so it doesn't matter to me when he comes how many can say Amen to that it don't matter when he comes I'll be serving him right here the doctor said that's true I said the greatest thrill I have is living for others and brother said that's what life is it makes life real ever feel like you feel numb and life is just ever meaningless anybody besides me ever feel that you get into the routine of life well it's Monday morning again here I go it's Thursday morning here and life sometimes doesn't feel real is this really happening Brother Ram said that that's what makes life real is when you're living for other people not what you can do or accomplish for yourself but what you can do for others and I see I'm tying this in with prayer right praying for the people interceding try to make a the Bible said try to make a difference in one person's life praise God who can I make a difference in their life that they can say thank God brother amen did that for her thank god sister Zer did that for thank god sister n was able to do that I'm talking about outside the church I mean you want to help people in the church but I'm just saying like who can we make a difference for in their life see that's when you're really living Hallelujah and if there happens to be someone Among Us who's never did that try to live for somebody else give that a try and just see how much more life holds for you when you live not not for what you can get for yourself out of life but what you can give someone else in life church we're going to close here a little bit but that's a question I'm going to ask you who's willing to give that a try this week and see I'm not going to live for what I can get for me I'm G to just try to live for somebody else this week amen so what would you do that's what we want the Holy Spirit to lead us into what can I do so for me it's like meeting up with people helping people what can I do for you warning people and like brother Samuel said it so plainly so beautiful he said look at the prophets remember he said they waited for inspiration right and that's what I want to find I want to I want to do everything right I can and then wait for something to strike me like oh now I feel inspired to do this I've seen two or three Witnesses now I'm going to go do that praise God Austin's kind like that he's got some good inspiration all those good test tonies right you'll see something there you see something there told me lots of good stories but just looking I'm looking for God I'm looking for God to inspire me to do something praise God Amen give that a try and just see how much more life holds for you wow life in other words when we live for others we'll say wow life is so worth living because I'm living for other people and not for myself amen I can't be the only one that goes through the life and just feels like life is just I feel numb and no am I having an impact on other people is my life even worth anything I'm sure we all go through that don't we but this is how brother says this is how you make life seem real again just choose one person this week I want to live for that person now you might have three or four you can get to this week so but pick out somebody who one person I can live for and try to bring love and mercy and some a blessing to their life here's what brother says he says you'll find that it's more blessed than riches or anything that can be thought of is when you do for someone else to make life's burdens which he says life in itself is a burden and the church said life is a burden he said but it will make life a little lighter for someone else you just don't know know the joy unless youve tried it once to do something for someone else amen hallelujah praise God I'm going to say Amen to that quote hallelujah amen want your joy back live for somebody else you want feeling back live for somebody else amen hallelujah do something to alleviate somebody burden now you're living for somebody else amen now you feel life is real again oh I can now I can get up and there's excitement in today because I want to help somebody I want to live for somebody else and the church said amen I'm almost done you've been a great audience here gracious very gracious church so this is in closing this is what Stephen did I'm already oh my goodness I'm I already oh boy uh I just caught up in Heavenly places Stephen said lay it not to their charge he's living for somebody else pray for somebody else with his last words he wasn't praying God prepare me God he's saying God forgive them I know I'm forgiven he was so close to Christ that he saw Christ right before his death yes and he spent his last words sister beatric his last words were praying for other people praise God oh my what a Christian they not to their charge God remember Paul said the same thing in second Timothy chapter 4 he said at my first answer no man stood with me but all men forsook me me I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge I think one or two chapters later he says the end is now for me I fought a good fight I finished the course in his last words he's saying God be merciful to those that have forsaken me praying for mercy upon other people the Bible says pray without ceasing the Bible says 1 Timothy 2 vers1 I exhort therefore first of all supplications prayers intercession that's the intercession that's my title God saw an intercessor intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men for kings and all that are in Authority that we may lead a quiet and PE peaceful life in all godliness and honesty for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our savior verse eight I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting amen praise God you know why this means you know why intercession means so much to us because of what Jesus does like Moses did Moses in the gap for the entire nation Jesus in the gap for the entire human race Hallelujah the entire billions upon billions upon trillions of people Jesus Christ stood in the Gap took our sin upon him and now he ever lives to make intercession for us he now appears in the presence of God for us so that encourages us who can we stand in the presence of God for today amen we got some good requests like sage in Jordan Hallelujah who can we stand in the presence of God I we know they're not standing In God's Presence but we are hallelujah we're the ones that will stand in the presence of God for them because no one else will do it but stand to our feet by God's gra musicians you can stop the live stream God bless the live stre with love you darling and Lydia God bless your birthday
