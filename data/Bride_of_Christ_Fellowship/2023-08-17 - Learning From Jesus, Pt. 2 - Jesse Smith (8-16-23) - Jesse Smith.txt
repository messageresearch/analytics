TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that you know about that I try to let you know about all the little things like that and in case you wonder where people are you know you wonder what's going on and we just want to keep everybody in the loop let me preach for about an hour here by the grace of Lord we'll kind of see how this goes school's back in session so I want to try to watch or for the for the girls it's almost back in session for me so I want to be mindful of the time so if you would uh I have some quotes or scriptures to to show by God's grace trying to think if there's anything else I want to share I put a podcast out yesterday about the lies coming out of Jeffersonville I put out a video today about the 12 different phrases or terminology for the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus says when you're converted strengthen your brethren it's also a seal it's born again it's New Birth uh there's 12 of them there's probably more than that but that just takes away all the confusion about the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's that one in self-same event where the soul is filled with God's spirit so I like to uh look here again tonight learning from Jesus and I kind of started the last sermon that was when we had our guest here from Napoleon brother Derek in the family uh they were here that that night I think I was wearing a green shirt too because I was listening to the sermon might actually be the same shirt I was in the sermon but kind of started off by saying you know some people have a misunderstanding of the word learn and uh it's not a bad word in fact it's a good Bible word uh it's used almost 70 times in the Bible as I'm looking at it again today so it's not a bad word at all but we saw there's two kinds of learning there's intellectual learning and then there's spiritual learning right so any there can be good intellectual learning as well like the girls probably learned something at school today did you learn something at school you probably learned how to obey your teacher right all your teachers new rules that's what I do the first two days of school I really Hammer the rules then everything goes a little more smoothly by God's grace but there's nothing wrong with learning uh even in the natural as we'll see with you know Shadrach Meshach and Bendigo Daniel there's nothing wrong with learning natural things but when any learning uh in the intellectual contradicts God's word then it's sinful learning but any spiritual learning about God of course is what we're after Hallelujah we want to grow as Christians we all know what it feels like to become stagnant and we got to make sure we don't become stagnant right because what happens when a water gets stagnant it's become deadly right and make you spiritually sick we all know what it's like to be spiritually sick right we don't feel like being around God's people we know if you like spending time with God uh and we're caught up in the sins and and maybe trials and maybe uh addictions or bad habits or something like that we don't want to be caught up in that we want to be a healthy Christian praise God Amen but we saw how uh you know learning might be a bad word in some message churches but not in true message churches because learning is a Bible word hallelujah and it's what Jesus said in our text Jesus said learn of me because I meek and lowly and just as a review you know I think I have just a slide there for just a quick review that you know learning is is what Jesus wants us to do and when Jesus teaches us most often it's very gentle because he said I'm meek and lowly right aren't you glad for a gentle teacher like Jesus praise God now there are some times he's got to rebuke us because we are rebelling against the word of God right we all know what that's like we know we're a disobeying God we haven't repented or something but then we'll get maybe something loud in a sermon or whether it's brother Branham or here or something in life maybe it'll be a car accident maybe it'll be something that'll Shake us up and oh we should have done I should have made this right sooner right but it's kind of like a strong rebuke but most often Jesus says I Meek lowly in heart and he just said come and be yoked unto me and learn of me Hallelujah and so I want to just just go right into these new verses here because the time is short and you never know how it's going to go I don't know how it's going to go uh the first time learn is used in the Bible and we'll just hit the highlights I'm not going to go through all 70 is with Laban and Jacob a member uh of course Jacob was uh running for his life right but God was still with him Hallelujah he was still predestinated to have the birthright hallelujah amen although he got it you know in a deceptive kind of way he's going to pay for it but he still was predestinated to have it praise God and so he served Laban remember 14 years uh for his two wives and then he got two concubines beside that and then his father-in-law told him you're not taking any more wives so he just had those four and he made the vow but uh Jacob said give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee and let me go for thou knowest my service which I have done thee and label it said unto him I pray thee if I have found favor in thine eyes Terry or wait for I've learned my experience that the Lord has blessed me for thy sake I like that he learned by experience that God was with his son-in-law praise God Hallelujah I think there's examples I could give you know in my life and other people's lives where just someone's connection to a message believer helps them to see God's blessing on their lives I talked to you here before but I've had numerous family members of ours and Christians of mine that are not in the message that come to our our house and our church and they know something's different about our family in fact I'll just say it you know my mom cried three hours and the first time she come to visit us after staying with us for three or four days she cried for three hours straight all the way home and she said your family's perfect now you know my family's not perfect but it was the love and interactions and the forgiveness and maybe those three days our children weren't arguing at all that's not every day because we're human but whatever it was whenever I mean my mom we three hours now I hope that's what happened to the Goodwin family by God's grace something similar like that I know I got some more text from Dwayne so he really enjoyed being with us by God's grace and I shared your podcast with him your testimony I shared my testimony with them and he's really thankful to have come by God's grace I told him I said brother now we're connected forever lean is a part of our church we're connected forever brother Hallelujah so always be able to encourage him and maybe uh of course glean from him too I'm sure there's something God has showed him that we can learn as well by God's grace but I just like this a person who is not maybe necessarily part of the message right just related to someone in the message he learned by experience that God really blesses this message believer Hallelujah that's what I want to be I want to be such a a dedicated Christian I want to be such a faithful Christian that people that are around me they learn by experience that God blesses me and not just with natural things but spiritual things as well amen hallelujah as that's what we want we want people uh to see that God's blessing is on our lives Hallelujah and of course Church the most powerful thing they can see on our lives what is it going to be it's going to be the fruits of the spirit love joy peace gentleness patience long-suffering all those fruits of the spirit because that's the whole end of Christianity that's the whole point of Christianity so someone can feel the love of God from you praise God they can see real Joy on the Christian praise God that's the whole point of it Hallelujah is to see the fruit of the spirit genuine fruit of the spirit like I told you Dwayne says he said when I went up to you he said he said I go up to all these other pastors and he's like oh these guys aren't pastors he said I'll walk up to the U.S and there's a pastor that's what he told me he said I walk up to the other I shake these other pastors hands he's like nah he's about with you he said I feel I feel life you know that's what he told me like nah like one man I'm not a not a pastor I'm glad I'm like a yeah Pastor or something like that but now this this idea here in Moses Moses times in the pentateuch or the Torah the first five books of the Old Testament I didn't put all them in there there's probably like five six or seven of scriptures just like these that God wants us to learn to obey the word of God a church be encouraged like I said last time if you haven't learned obey something you haven't learned it yet but you will praise God right just haven't got there yet amen you'll get there Hallelujah and there's things I want to attain to praise God like I I like to get to the spot where I'm I'm so sensitive to the holy spirit that everybody can enjoy every sermon I preach in that that nobody walks out of here feel like they wasted a sermon are they wasted I wasted their time I hope you know I hope that's never happened but it you know I I never I want to be so sensitive to the holy spirit that everybody will leave here each time I don't know if it's possible but I think it is Maybe by God's grace each person can leave here inside got something from God tonight Hallelujah that's something I want to learn how to do I want to learn how to grow and obey the voice of the Holy Spirit like if God has ordained a pastor give uh then there has to be a way I could be in the channel where everybody gets blessed every time just like brother Brandon right he was a prophet so what happened every time he would say Lord I'm waiting for your angel to be here and then he could do the discernment the prayer line right and the program could do that well then perhaps I I want to do that as a pastor not discerned but I want to feed God's people every time so if God can do it the pastor gift then he's got to do it I'm sorry with a prophet gift he can do with the pastor the teacher evangelist and Apostle right Define full ministry he said now Moses says only take heed to yourself and keep thy Soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen unless they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy Sons see how important it is to remember all the good testimonies in your life you don't want to forget those you want to remember what God has done for you amen don't don't let those things depart out of your life Hallelujah now let me share this with you I think I can just share it on here I have a document where I keep track and I have every every Sunday night let's see if I can pull it up here where is it I have a list of church testimonies first so I don't want to forget all of our uh testimonies yeah yeah so here's 2023 each Sunday night and I know you can't read it but don't worry about that just as the point uh I'm sorry it's the point that every Sunday night I got a reminder write down to any testimonies from church so I just started that this year so here's January 1st Kristen was sick and exhausted Lena came and asked if she could pray for Christian truly breast or truly blessed Chris Christian sorry January 4th amen said he felt the wind of the Holy Spirit on Wednesday night service after I preached on part five of praise the name of the dance amen shouted and praise God as I prayed for Revival his first love not long after that he had trouble with the appendix surgery so how he needed that he needed that anointing before he had this trial and so now I I went back to 2011 2012 so what maybe someday I'll just preach a service on all these testimonies here by God's grace so I wanna I wanna take that to heart I want to remember the memorials Joshua all right you're over the Joshua Army I want to remember what God has done so I don't forget praise God especially for the it's actually my responsibility and parents for the Next Generation to teach the children right that's that's what happened to Israel they didn't teach the Next Generation all the testimonies all right there's going to be a time or Malachi and Lydia I'm gonna go and call some names irritation they're gonna have to get on their faces and pray before every service because they're going to be they might be running the church they might be the leaders in the church right it's gonna come a time when daddy's gonna get old daddy man go crazy let's hope not the point is there's going to come a time when every generation has to seek God that's right Hallelujah and this is my this is my time to see God I've got to preach until the Holy Spirit comes I got to preach so people are blessed I gotta pray until God blesses the people praise God each and every person has to do that he says especially the day that thou sent us before the Lord thy God in auram when the Lord said unto me gather me the people together and I will make them hear my words that they may what learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth I remember when sister know we said that fear of the Lord's servant was really important for her it was for me too I'm sure it was for all of us remember we can just we can we can just kind of summarize or or just boil it down to are we fearing God or not praise God that's really good what we can boil it down to are we walking in respect unto God are we remembering God's Commandments or not you came tonight so I believe you are by God's grace amen if you don't want to hear the word of God you would not have come Hallelujah see God said remember the testimonies gather the people make them hear the words let them come to church right he says make that's why I said make I'm not going to make you go to church I'm going to encourage you to come to church I can't make you come to church I've never made anybody come to church but I want to make it sound like legalism my brother said you ought to be a legalist about coming to church at least at the beginning he said to get the good habit of coming to church and he laughs he laughs but it wasn't legalist he laughed it was a joke he said they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the Earth and that they may teach their children praise God and Moses called on Israel said I'm hero Israel the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day that ye may learn them and keep them and do them so see there are scriptures we want to be able to fulfill we want to be able to do it but we've got to learn how to do it praise God like I've got I think two or three texts or emails over the last few weeks people want to learn how to fast I don't know if it's in this church or not I know one for sure is not in this church and I said you just start oh yeah I saw Chris at Walmart twice on Monday and I invited him back to church I saw him so that's what we're praying for we're praying for him I told him virtues praying for him doing okay he's trying to go to the Air Force but let's we'll keep him in prayer I said brother we're praying yeah we prayed that you wouldn't go to Arizona and he laughed well you know there's things we want to be able to do we want to obey him but we are not there yet right but we got to learn how to do them we got to learn how to obey in order to keep God's Commandments but God is patient right think about it I don't get upset with first graders if they can't do multiplication because it's not time for them to do multiplication and even when they're a year behind I don't get impatient with them I just still show them love because everybody develops at a different rate so I told the brothers I said just skip one meal just start with the morning like it's easiest to fast when you're on a roll already like going into the next day right you fast all night so just keep it going in the morning I said try to fast skip breakfast then and try to go to lunch and then if you can get to lunch sometime try to go to supper right try to do that and then try to develop it a couple times a week not only the Bible says gonna make you healthy it's going to make you more spiritual too praise God so I'm just trying to help people learn I mean I love that they want to learn how to fast like that's music to my ears you want to fast you want to give up uh your food you want to give up meals for God oh that were not far from the kingdom hallelujah amen amen remember we've had people who leave this church and believe the message their whole life and never fasted one day in their lives then they want and they battled that they battled that but I said I said don't take that as a rebuke take it as encouragement that now in the year 41 now God wants to teach you how to fast right right so these are some beautiful verses Psalms 106 34. my wife said that's my word I use all the time that's beautiful so if I overuse that please pardon me but you know what I'm talking about they did not destroy the Nations concerning the Lord whom the Lord commanded them Israel but were mingled among the Heathen and learned their work so we got to be very careful who we mingle with and they serve their Idols which were a snare unto them so we see idolatry you know uh we can learn bad habits when we hang around the wrong people right right when we mingle with the wrong influences and that's what happened to Israel think think about that church think it's just hard for us to understand sometimes they saw the pillar of fire every night they saw the cloud by day every day they saw the waters parted the Red Sea they walked on dry land and yet they still forgot about God and they still made the golden calf and they still complained ten times right sometimes it's hard for us to understand it just shows how short uh such a sharp memory we have because we're human right now I like one thing though Joshua and Caleb were not that kind Hallelujah glory amen why because the Bible said they had a different spear Hallelujah they have the whole death of Greater Holy Ghost anointing in their minds Hallelujah in other words Joshua and Caleb renewed their minds every single day praise God amen see they mingle with unbelievers and they learn how to sin rather than learning how to obey God so that's the bad example of learning we want to avoid that I like this I will praise thee with uprightness of heart now brightness means I've obeyed the word of God see praise follows learning I learned something new during the sermon now I can praise God at the end Hallelujah it is good for me that I've been Afflicted that I might learn nice statutes that does that remind you of Jesus and Hebrews Jesus learned obedience through the things that he suffered like and then sometimes we get discouraged why am I suffering why am I going through this and sometimes I think God wants to say it's to teach you a lesson is to teach you how to be a better Christian now we all know Financial battles right what does that teach us to be trusting God right we all go through seasons of Lost seasons of more what is it to do to teach us to trust in God and not the Bible said not in uncertain riches right right Hallelujah but see church sometimes we suffer to learn to obey God's statutes to learn to obey God's commands a wise man will hear Proverbs 1 5 says and will increase learning and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels Hallelujah so see church we got to open our ear to hearing the right thing the right kind of learning right like I had a friend in the Lord contact me and uh today he was sending me voice messages and he kind of calls me his mentor and he said yeah I've been reading these other books he said but I need to get back to the Bible he said I just I read these books so I could have a better career and he said I need to get back to the Bible I thought that's a good that's a good desire that's great a lot of people don't catch that right A lot of people like we had it here one time at the church years ago the person no longer goes here but my wife and I remember the very day this person came to us and and this person said I'm going to stop studying the scripture so much and I'm gonna start studying business and that was the way out that was the way out of coming to every service that was a way out of lots of other things I don't want to give too many details but my wife and I specifically remember that day now it's okay to study business it's okay to study Finance it's okay okay to study whatever you want to study but make sure we increase our learning in the word of God hallelujah and if two or three services is not enough then guess what you got to do it during the week too praise God Hallelujah that's what I do every day I try to listen to a sermon every day now uh today I was listening to brother Brandon uh some days like this and Tim Pruitt Donnie Reagan uh cams when they're available just like me I don't put all my sermons on there but I like that I've always got to stay in the preaching I got to stay in the channel of hearing the word of God I want to increase my learning Hallelujah give instruction to a wise man and he will yet be wiser but see wise people want to know more things like these people want to know how to fast what their shows they're getting wisdom praise God they want to know how to be wiser teach a just man and he will increase the learning like remember that Mike guy I talked about last Wednesday night I met with him he said he's not reading my book he said this is full of great things I said well I know a great person that wrote it it was Jesus it wasn't me but he said this is full of great things see he wants to learn amen he wants to increase his learning praise God Hallelujah so see when I when I try to teach or try to instruct on things we can do it will make us wiser by God's grace Hallelujah the wise and heart Shall be Called prudent that means understanding and the sweetness of the lips increases learning understanding is a Wellspring of Life unto him that hath it but the instruction of fools is folly so look at this Wellspring sweetness I mean what a sweet life probably would if you like what fresh water is Flowing your life will become wiser right gain more learn more about the Lord praise God the heart of the wise teaches his mouth and addeth learning to his lips all right so that's what we want to do we want to be able to learn and then take what we've learned right and then share that with other people right that's what brother ram calls he calls that exercising your spiritual muscles but Iran says many times people come to church and he says that spiritually they get overweight on hearing the word but not acting on the word he said but when you hear it and go talk to somebody else he said that's spiritually exercising your muscles amen he says so we're not spiritually obese he says right Hallelujah I like that amen that's happened numerous times sometimes people send me a text and I'm like I don't know what to say and I'll think Lord what did I preach last week and then I'll send whatever inspired thought I had I said to a man uh what's his name I can't remember his name Perry I said unto the man Perry my wife through my wife I met this guy with the herbs and I just sent him this thought and he's like wow I need I just needed that right now and then I think I told you that testimony with brother Irvin down there in Junction City my wife sent me a verse and I said I thought Irvin right away I sent to him and brother Irvin said I needed that verse at that moment because I was going through depression and battling discouragement think about that my wife just texted me I'm like I could have said hey I think I just held down and liked it with a heart or something you know how you hold on heard it but I thought well I should do something with this no this reminds me brother Irvin I'll send it to him and that little text helped him come out a little depression praise God a little text just a little just a little care about other people don't you like that when you get an encouraging text amen hallelujah means a lot wise learn fools do not I love what Isaiah 1 says of course I love all these scriptures probably over say that too much wash you make you clean put away the evil of your duties from before my eyes cease to do evil learn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the Widow come now and let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they should be white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as whoa hallelujah amen hallelujah praise God that's what that's what the blood of Jesus Christ does you might be dirty you might be red with sin but Jesus blood will give you a white garments Hallelujah like Lena's dress on the Saturday praise God Amen makes her closing where's Victoria's got white clothes on tonight too I said don't you get any food on that that's real pretty white right there that's what the Bible says obeying God learn to do well gives you white garments Hallelujah amen see we got to learn to do well we got to put away evil put away Temptation seek judgment seek Lord what would you judge in this situation uh like Austin sent me a text right on Monday what would you do in this situation I want he wanted my judgment I thought that's a good man right there that's a good man right that's what I want I want sometimes I seek out judgment from other people what would you do what do you think sisters what time you want to have a service room if we have a late we have a late service on a Thursday or Friday night I need to I need people's judgment praise God with My Soul have I desired the end of the night yay with my spirit Within Me will I seek thee early for when thy judgments are in the earth now think about this when God's judgments are in the earth then happens to the world will learn righteousness now look what happened today they took God out of the schools they took God out of the government they took God out of everything and look what we got a bunch of heathens yeah right a bunch of absolute insane people but the opposite's true when God's word is in the earth they learn to be righteous praise God Hallelujah Church honestly I don't know where what to think about the world right now like I listen to a few different uh news sources One Source is showing how most Nations outside of the West are actually turning from the woke movement like especially African nations they will not take the they will not take the woke agenda a lot of them Outlaw homosexuality as well which praise God for them and they're more aligning with the more Traditional Values like Russia and China because they're they're against Western Nations and some of the European nations that are going woke so it's just interesting uh you know because we're always watching watching them praying how soon is the rapture I ask myself that every day but it's just interesting so what I'm saying is some Nations actually the majority of Nations it seems like are actually moving away from the woke agenda which would mean there are at least they're honoring some of God's judgments in the Earth which is interesting oh and uh you know just a follow-up I did I did uh read uh watch a few videos on remember that Catholic event I was telling you about the change it was called where they're having all those guest speakers up there remember that a few weeks ago um the pope went there and the pope said um he said our church has no doors because it's open for everybody and he said it's just like a mother like a mother at her house she wants everybody to come in everyone everyone everyone and he's speaking of Mother Mary so um and there was there was many hundred I think there was a hundred thousand or so youth all came into that event and so it was just more propaganda from the Roman Catholic church and more mothers trying to include everybody everybody's included the Pope says through Mary where's Jesus in all this right where's Jesus so again look at this it's perfect mystery Babylon right the woman it all exalts the woman Mary exalt in the Roman Catholic church right exalting uh and I thought no door Jesus is the door that's right you got no doors of course that's why the goats get it but every True Church of God has a door Christ is the door Hallelujah the Bible said if you climb in another way you're not fit for the kingdom Hallelujah amen let favor be shown to the wicked yet he will not learn righteousness in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly and will not behold the Majesty of the Lord we're in a title of famine for the hearing of the word remember Amos 8 11-12 it's a spiritual famine for the hearing of the word of God that's why uh we need more of God's judgments in the earth I don't know how it's going to go like I said with the Rapture I'm not quite sure how that's going to go Isaiah 50 verse 4 the Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learn I like this one that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that's weary he awakeneth morning by morning he waketh awakeneth mind ear to hear as the Learned who wants to be a blessing and uplift others praise God I think that's beautiful God gave Isaiah a tongue of the Learned of course he learned from God that he should know how to give someone a word in due season Hallelujah you ever seen somebody who's down in the dumps and just like you wish you could just say something to help them out how many ever seen that before right amen that's what Isaiah is saying God made me to do that now I just remember chapter one right or chat was it no I'm sorry it was chapter earlier in the book I forget Which chapter it is but God sent a coal down from heaven to clean off Isaiah's mouth right yes right so this is what we need we need the fire of the Holy Ghost to cleanse our lips that's right God take out any foolishness out of my mouth I'm talking about me amen right and I'm sure you'd say Amen take the nonsense out of my mouth the foolishness help me to just speak your word praise God I could be a word and do season to somebody praise God the awakeneth Morning by morning he he waketh my ear now look at that in order for him to speak he's got to waken early to hear the word of God then he can speak it to somebody amen he's got to learn to do that now here's a scripture about Daniel and his three friends the Bible said there was no blemish in them I'm going to skip a little bit skillful and all wisdom and uh they were able to be taught by the Chaldeans to teach and learn of their language and the Bible said God gave them skill in learning and wisdom now think about that God made them smart God did right now I don't think God makes anybody dumb right right now we know there's levels of intelligence but everyone is intelligent yeah yeah right it's the enemy that wants people to waste their memory away right right or waste uh waste their intellect God wants us to learn the word of God hallelujah and then because they could learn all this then God used them for great testimonies how many preachers have preached on the fourth man in the fire because Shadrach Meshach and Abednego learn the science right right how many preachers amen hallelujah how many preachers that preached on Daniel even if you're thrown into lines then God will stop the lion's mouth praise God God's with you the Lions then God's with you in the Fire come on God God sent an angel you just got to wait 21 days and he'll break through praise God just wait on the angel now these were only possible because they learned the natural things that they were teaching that's why you tell those children like Brahman said about education learn as much as you can just never let education uh go above God's word don't believe the evolution nonsense right right you might have to put it on the test to get it right but even if you just miss one you still get a 96 you know I'm not telling anybody to get a bad grade but the point is God wants to use all of it praise God like I've had people over the years tell me your brother Jesse I really like your videos well I learned to do that when I was in college for teaching right a lot a lot of people don't do their videos now I know they're not as nice as Austin could do really nice ones so she's like he does really good ones but the point was like I couldn't you know if I went and went to school maybe I would not have been able to do that and I could not have helped the people the way I couldn't help them now by God's grace like there's just certain things I'm glad I learned I'm glad I learned these natural things they're not going to be a blessing to somebody else praise God when the Pharisees saw it I'm getting the New Testament now when the Pharisees saw it they said on his disciples why he is your master with Republicans and sinners when Jesus heard that he said to them they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick now look Jesus was always battling these critical spirits oh hey it's like he couldn't do anything right and yet he was doing everything right right right but these Pharisees and says she's just constantly criticism the publicans and the herodians lawyers scribes everybody was criticizing him all the time but brother Adam said he lived above the criticism Hallelujah amen he didn't let anything deter praise God he just kept looking to the father whatever the father said that's what he said whatever the father said to you that's what he knew that's what we should do always do what the father says hallelujah I like what Jesus says he corrects him he said the reason they're they're getting well is because they're sick right and he's basically telling them you don't can't even realize your sickness right at least they can recognize they need salvation he said you can't even recognize your saved he said you need to go and learn what this scripture means I will have mercy and not sacrifice in other words the Pharisees would sacrifice remember they would divide the tithe of every mitt and spice and they'd make sure down to the very ounce they tie the right amount but yet they they were too holy in their eyes to go minister to Zacchaeus or minister to marry Magdalene or some of these other people they consider dirty and Jesus said you need to go learn something praise God you need to learn to go have mercy on people events instead of being self-righteous and legalistic you need to learn what the scripture says you you have a you have a understanding but you don't have the real spiritual revelation of God's word yeah yeah I've not come to call the righteous he says the self-righteous but Sinners to repentance Hallelujah I like that Jesus brings out the real rebuke these were the Learned people he says you need to go learn something right is that how we overcome the devil just through the opposite of what the devil says right the devil says I'm so learned and Jesus says you need to go learn that's right right Satan condemns you just turn it right back on him right like you're a hypocrite no Satan you're the biggest hypocrite right right you're a failure God doesn't love you no God loves me the Bible says so Hallelujah you're the one that's rejected God's love you turn it right back on and praise God amen no we're watching Israel brother says watch Israel right right we watch and pray and some people can't understand this Jesus says now learn a parable of the Fig Tree the Fig Tree is always Israel I don't have time to go back and get that I don't have those scriptures actually ready but I could teach that when his branch is yet tend to remember said Israel is my son and he put it forth leaves you know that summer is nine so likewise he when you shall see all these things know that it's near even at the doors verily I send you this generation shall not pass so all these things were filled now on another world event I've been listening to Israel and Israel's government is basically going right leaning in other words they're getting more and more conservative but the judges are all liberal the Supreme Court is all liberal right so there's a great move in Israel getting back to the word of God Amen it's just the Supreme Court Justices that are undoing all the good all right but I'm just letting you know the trend is going towards those 144 000. Hallelujah so see we got to learn that as we see Israel get more and more obedient to the word of God of course we know the Rapture is closer Hallelujah right and there's going to come a time when this generation shall not pass until we see everything prophesied for Israel it will come to pass like I've said this numerous times church if we start seeing them build the temple we know the Rapture is really close I'll be calling prayer meetings every night or service every night or whatever you know if we start seeing that right just like if we see the United States start changing these laws against Christians right it's almost go time right right it's almost time to go remember the Bible said you gotta in the time of that of rain you got to cry out for the latter rain remember that scripture that's right remember all the trials are to do what trials draw us closer to God when it was time for the disciples to get the Holy Ghost God had to use pressure to get them the Holy Ghost the the day of Pentecost right all the pressure of a rest and all these things God's gonna drive us to whatever we need for rapturing Faith praise God Amen amen now I use this verse last time said this verse but rather said is that evidence of the Holy Ghost In other words every child of God who's born again can learn from God they want to learn from God because God's their father praise God Hallelujah I don't expect Malachi and Lydia to learn from other dads I expect them to learn from me praise God watch my life Hallelujah watch what I do because they're my children he said it is written the prophets and they shall all be taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and has learned of the father cometh unto me Hallelujah see every true child of God will come to this word and want a real understanding of it right a real understanding I like this one too Acts 26 and as he thus spayed for himself Festus the ruler Senate with the loud voice Paul Thou Art man I'm sorry Thou Art beside themselves thyself much learning doth make me mad now he was preaching to him about Jesus dying resurrecting he says you're mad you're crazy but he said I am not man most normal Festus but speak forth the words of truth and soberness Hallelujah see Paul wasn't crazy he had much Revelation that's why he was talking the way he was talking yeah amen remember Paul said Jesus revealed himself to me that he might reveal his son in me praise God in other words God wanted to reveal Christ in Paul through his sufferings praise God yeah through this testimony through the supernatural so see if that's just accused him of the wrong kind of learning but Paul said I haven't got the wrong learning I've got the right learning praise God I speak the words of truth and soberness hallelujah amen so that's that proves speaking the truth sometimes will make you look crazy Hallelujah anybody ever been called Crazy by a friend or family member yes right what is it it's the learning of the Holy Ghost that does that praise God we're not crazy we're just speaking the truth in love Hallelujah amen Romans 15 3 for even Christ please God himself but I mention I'll go back to the Roman series eventually but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproach thee fell on me for whatsoever things were written before time were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope Hallelujah Church men died to write these Bible books so we can learn how to serve God Amen Hallelujah they shed their blood Martyrs like we saw on on Sunday they got the martyrs Crown they shed their blood so you can learn to be patient you could get comfort from the scriptures and you can have hope Hallelujah men and men died for this word of God so you can learn how to be more patient are you learning tonight amen you can comfort from the word of God we get Hope from the word of God see anybody that says oh brother yes he's preaching on learning here anybody that would say oh we don't need to learn about God well what does the Bible say the Bible said you've got to learn remember learning is just it's another form of understanding and how do we get understanding through Revelation Okay so learning is a byproduct of getting a revelation Hallelujah appreciate that last time but I'm not going to go back to that Romans 16 17 now beseech you I beg you Brethren mark them which caused divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you've heard that's why I call people's names sometimes I'm marking them because the Bible said to mark them and avoid them right so in our case we won't listen to them online right or won't go where to where they're preaching at I mark them and say avoid them stay away from their influence for they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ anyone dividing the body of Christ and I will say this one example is with people doing Church splits not all the time sometimes the church split is a good thing if the Cur if the church is off the word of God then it's a good thing to have a church split but if some preacher just wants some money and he splits the church just to get some Tide money that's sin right right so I always want to have that balance sometimes the church but is a good thing if the old church or the former church is deep in sin right that's why I you know I haven't made the video yet but some of these people that are leaving the message I'm glad they've left some of the message churches because they're not real message churches their sin failed message churches so I'm glad they left that I just wish they went to a real Message Church like ours Hallelujah where we preach the Bible Hallelujah where we believe the word of God where we stand on thus saith the Lord and we're not Fanatics program said never make yourself odd to be a Christian that's why at the wedding I didn't bring out the third pole at the wedding I'm not trying to be odd to be a Christian a real Christian a Holy Ghost Field Saint right right that's why I didn't bring out the Seven Seals at the sermon yeah right right I could have I could have reached on the seven seams now people do people because people say the Seven Seals are coming lord well that's the marriage seal some people say that I could have brought that in you know that you know when we go in the Rapture that's the seven seal it was our Rapture seal and Austin are experiencing a seven seal sermon or Seven Seals spiritually today I could have went that but I don't want to be odd to be a Christian if they don't even understand the blood of Jesus Christ how they how are people going to catch the revelation of the Seven Seals right that's why I tried to hammer or just labor on the blood what does the blood do what does the blood do right how are Australia going to manifest Jesus Christ to the world the Bible says their marriage will reveal Jesus Christ it's a mystery it's through their Love Of Christ one for another and their love for the church that's how the mystery of Jesus Christ and the church will be seen through us and Lena their love that they have right right like my crying mama three hours back home she saw the mystery of revelation of a marriage or marriage right there right there that's right Hallelujah foreign people that split churches or cause divisions amongst even churches they are serving themselves they're not serving God there's usually it's always money behind it money or power or money power influence or evil relationships but they're serving themselves their own belly is their God not the Lord Jesus Christ because they divide people with the word of God rather than uniting people and by Goods words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple to see sound Doctrine keeps us away from deceivers and that's why I get zealous you know this movement is making every word brother Ram said thus saith the Lord they're taken away from my Jesus they're making him equal to Jesus he's not equal to Jesus he's a servant of Jesus Hallelujah and that makes me jealous they're still they're taking taking an attitude that only belongs to Christ and they're giving it to brother random brother said don't do that to me praise God he said he said I'm a sinner saved by grace not meant to live he said I didn't say that to be home or praise God he said give all this grace to Jesus Christ Hallelujah amen so I just get a little zealous praise God I ought to that's my Lord that's my savior praise God and all these things brother and I have in a figure transferred to myself into Apollos for your sakes now ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written and that no one of you be puffed up for one against another so the Corinthians had to learn not to participate in the goat debate is what Paul says I want you to learn not to think above men which is written now don't get me wrong preachers get double honor the Bible says right give them double honor and the Bible says honor all brethren so we all give each other honor but we shouldn't give honor that's above the word of God that's right we got to learn how to do that now it's usually not it's never a problem here that I've ever seen no one ever wants to fall down and can I worship the ground that you walk on brother no one's ever said that thank God Hallelujah I just told you that one time I was down in Columbus and we preached and we had numerous Miracles and that right that service and that brother come up and he asked my wife he said his name was James and he said what is it like to live with brother Jesse she's like that's pretty good no and sometimes because sometimes bad that'd be the truth right maybe she's laughing now you got any live streamers on there but it was just really I mean God really moved to that service and the brother was like now he's really mature now he said later he said later things that kind of hurt our feelings you know he's kind of making fun of our the size of our family and our our van I didn't like that but it just showed his immaturity like what is it like to level be like living with anybody else but remember the Bible says in First Corinthians 3 verse 7. the the preacher who sows sees and the preacher who waters are nothing it's God who gives the increase right so there's that aspect we give them double honor but yet the man can't bring any increase man can't bring Revival God brings Revival amen hallelujah I just like to be there when it happens amen I don't know when the wind's gonna blow but the wind's gonna blow Hallelujah I'm ready for that breeze too and my wife sent me this scripture let's got your Bible Isaiah 10 verse 15. she sent me this a couple days ago I thought wow that's really good and again this this scripture emphasizes how we're Tools in God's hand that's what brother always said Maria said I am just a microphone in the hand of God right right we don't just praise wow that was a great one you hear somebody like Austin's saying really good right on Saturday also saying really good that was the best love song I've ever heard brother that was really great but after he got done I didn't go up and say wow that microphone that was that was really great how did how did that microphone do that it was the voice in front of the microphone right right and that's what it is really when we ezer's just like wow well this is really nice and that's smooth and that's black and look at that Gold Line I mean right right it's just the microphone right that's right Hallelujah Isaiah 10 15. that microphone's gonna rot one day microphone's gonna get uh dust all over it's gonna stop working at some point Isaiah 10 verse 15. shall the ax boast itself against him that he was there with this is actually gonna say look look what I've done uh you know you were look at me look what I've done no the ax doesn't get the glory it's the humor that it's got all the power or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it look what I've done look what I've done no the guy can just drop this song Let's get another selfie once okay right as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up look at me look at this the microphone say look how great I am well look how fantastic I am the microphone's nothing right see in one way we're nothing but one way God could only work by using us praise God see it's just that balance we gotta keep we got to learn the right balance now we've got to hear right but we just want to make sure don't creep in that's why I preached out a series on doctrines of Devils last year I want to make sure I saw it creeping in in all these churches almost every sermon I listen to like I said our children went to youth meeting and this is the first thing the guy preached right why is he is it starts it starts at the top with the big name preachers and I love them but it works their way down if they think about your influence now let's apply that to ourselves let's be careful what we say I especially got to be careful what I say because whenever I say you might pick up on it because I'm influencing you three times a week at least right so we've got to be very careful how I use my influence and so do you especially parents right like they say uh with school teachers and parents the parents always joke around and say uh Mr Smith just believe half of what my children say and I'll just believe half of what they tell me happens at school I said okay that's good foreign let's finish that scripture them that lift it up oh staff should lift up itself as if it were no wood like I like it could lift itself up like the staff of Moses could lift itself up and I'll do this without Moses you can't do nothing without Moses that's right we can't do nothing without Jesus Hallelujah so again the Bible says he that preaches he that Waters is nothing God is the one that gives an increase in other words like Birmingham said I was just there when it happened brother Adam said I wasn't the voice that spoke on the river in 1933 that said as John the Baptist was sent with the forerun the first coming so your message is set to four on the second coming brother I said I was just there when it happened praise God amen I got about seven minutes here um yeah I I wanted to get to this thought uh I better I'll just read the quote and I'll do maybe deal with it on Sunday by God's or I won't preach Sunday so maybe next time I wanted to end the the sermon with that thought about how brother random grew and learn more about Divine Healing so for Years brother Ann would say um he would say the positive mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass right how many you've heard that before well he stopped saying it about a year and a half before his death because I I believe the Lord helped him to grow in his teaching on Divine Healing okay so think about that you know the right mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass okay so what if somebody took that and uh they were going after a promise that wasn't for them okay so like I'm trying to think about a a simple promise you know just like uh I don't know maybe a prophet or a dream you know let's say someone wants to try to be a prophet or something like that and they found a promise where it made it seem like in the Bible like like if they could just do this they would get that I'll just use the one like uh people will misconstrue like uh Jesus fasted for 40 days right and then he had this great overcoming victory and someone someone might misunderstand that promise and say if I just fast 40 days and I'll be able to defeat the Devil right well that that promise might not apply to you right God might not be leading you to fast for 40 days right right now one of our remember brother uh remember Levi the former Amish guy who come here with the black hair and kind of curls down under his daughter fasted for 45 days and she said she got the Holy Ghost that's wonderful I think she's 20 20 something 28 29 I can't remember anyways but the point was that news went down to the church down there in Junction City and they asked me last Thursday I say brother now think about this a nursing mother asked me do I need to fast 40 days to get the Holy Ghost a nursing mom and I said no sir I said no you feed that baby God gave you that baby but I appreciated that her sincerity don't you that's that was pretty powerful and I told her I said no I said the Bible doesn't say thou shalt fast 40 days to get the Holy Ghost and I quoted Acts 2 38 because I said the Bible says repent but you shall be filled amen that's right you didn't say when right and you gotta look at all five times the Holy Ghost fell for the first time they had to wait 10 days uh the second time they had to wait to get hands laid on him by Peter James and John the third time was cornelius's house they got the Holy Ghost Riders the preacher preached amen they didn't have to get on their knees they could just say amen and the Holy Ghost fell and then praise God fourth time was uh Acts 19 it was down in Ephesus and they already believed in Jesus Peter and Paul said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed they said we don't even know there is a baptism Holy Ghost what were you baptized I got the I got John's baptism he said there's another baptism you need to get baptized and then after they were baptized he laid their hands on them and they spoke in tongues and got the Holy Ghost it's different than all the other ones and then Paul got the Holy Ghost shortly after the scales fell off his eyes he got the Holy Ghost so in other words I told him every situation is different I said with my wife and I the Holy Ghost came at a time we weren't really expecting it the day after my wedding I wasn't really expecting that amen I was just trying to get to church laughs uh my wife down there uh I told sir reading her Bible by the beach the ghost fell on her right before work amen before work getting up I don't know if she's getting up early or just you know work was later that morning but she went on there to pray Holy Ghost found her she cried worshiped the Lord felt power and was different had power after that that's what it is it's power to be a witness Hallelujah but not everybody knows exactly brother man said he got it in a shed brother Samuel Browning he's the pastor up there a Sheffield where you went to those youth meetings he got the Holy Ghost and his brother Bill Sanchez's basement next on his knees next to the dog kennel that dog container in his in that basement he they pray right there and he said the Holy Ghost found him right there and he screenshotted and praised the Lord that's where God the Holy Ghost next to a dog amen amen amen brother tells the story that one man I can't remember his name was Robinson and uh everybody tells that story and he he was working in the field he got so hungry for the Holy Ghost he said he stopped his oxen right there and he said he got on his knees and said Lord if you don't find if you don't send me the Holy Ghost now they're gonna find my body my dead body laying here the story was the Holy Ghost fell on him amen he got desperate and then he said there was a real Aristocrat or smart kind of guy he said I want the Holy Ghost he went to this meeting uh with the southerners with a a black church and the man said I was the Holy Ghost and the the black Pastor he said he said okay come over here little man tells the story he says I went to Holy Ghost he said okay come over here it's right over there in the pig pen and the man's like I'm not going to the big bed he said that's the way you got to come to get it God and led him to do that and he fought he argued for a while he said no the holy spirit said so and according to brother I'm sorry a smart guy the election guy he got there and as soon as his knees hit the mud he started praising God and the Holy Ghost fell on the praise God it's just like Naaman right Naaman didn't want to go down to the dirty Jordan River but that was God's will praise God that's right in other words you gotta lose your pride Gotta Lose your status and just want God in your heart praise God amen hallelujah I'm happy to say that Hua and amen loss are there Pride right here at this altar amen and God the Holy Ghost amen power of the witness and you need that power amen's needed that power for the trials of Life they've gone through I have the power for the trial so I've gone through in my life that's right because I wouldn't have been able to maybe handle it without it Hallelujah I just don't need the power for numericals and and helping people I need the power to overcome the enemy too now it's eight o'clock hard to believe so I'll just close with this and then next time I'll I'll go over the Divine Healing uh okay I said anyone that's not learning right now there's something wrong in your life okay that's why I like to go you know sometimes I like to go to these new topics or I like to go right through a whole book of the Bible because that guarantees we're learning something right again it guarantees me every time like when I went back to Esther I learned something new every time right when I preach on the Song of Solomon I learned something new every time that's why it's so important because really I mean we we don't read the Bible as much as we should right right let's just be honest we got busy lives right but the Bible doesn't say thou shalt read the Bible four hours a day or you're back to the Bible don't say that we just got to see God more but I'm saying you know remember all these things are written for our learning the Bible says remember we just read that right so if we're not learning about God if we're not learning about the word something's wrong with us now we don't want to be wrong we want to be right amen amen and you're familiar with this I've used it you know numerous times over the years there's my hour this last quote like you're learning to swim you know you splash the water and go across the pool I made her now after you learn to swim more graceful is a stroke and it don't wear you out so much see that's it you learn how to do it and and cut every corner make it better and that's more of an ease see a little boy that never walked would try to walk down the aisle here he would fall down a dozen times to be wore out before he got there but anyone who knows how to walk an athlete would rock right down that aisle and never even notice doing it well he had he had that to start with that's what he is now what's the same way with preaching Divine Healing or anything else as you go along you begin to learn if you don't there's something wrong so you've got to learn and you've got to learn how to accept God and what it really means so maybe next time I just I want to make a whole video and make it public as well I want to preach a whole sermon on how brother Adam grew in his understanding on Divine Healing so I would just generalize it like this at the beginning of Brothers Ministry he would put the emphasis on you've got to believe you've got to believe you've got to believe but by the end of it he's like you got to seek God for God's will big difference yeah yeah right right if I was awesome at six tonight I'd say you've got to believe it's your job it's well what if you don't get the healing tonight he might feel bad right but it's totally different when you say seek God for it right ask the Lord what his will is for the situation and that's where program got to the end and this sermon works as Faith expresses I preached it a number of years ago he he says we allow Divine Healing sometimes we say well this guy didn't have enough Faith this guy didn't do this or that and church one thing I found that's been very destructive at least in one church is when people in the church criticize somebody for missing their healing I've seen it destroy not destroy fully but I would say destroy relationships in a church when people in the church criticize somebody else and say you missed your healing but yet these people are healthy all the time they don't get sick a lot well it's easy for them to say you missed your healing because they're not they're not sick I've seen it really hurt people that's why sometimes I'll go back to this and share whenever you're seeking God for something you've got to find his will first amen that's right gotta find his will it's not always God's will to heal right or save well that's the hard one right because we don't want to see people lost right right that's why I bring that out because I've seen that destroy relationships in a church where people accuse someone of you didn't have enough Faith you missed your healing and then brother Graham says at the end of the sermon he said it you can't work yourself into it that's right if you ever had Faith to be healed God gave it to you by Grace by Grace amen now I know there's a balance of that right because Jesus could not do many mighty Miracles because of what people's unbelief right right but they were already unbelievers to begin with what I'm saying is that you're a Believer and I don't want you to be discouraged I want you to be encouraged praise God I want you to keep seeking God for whatever you're seeking God for praise God Amen amen until God makes his will known keep seeking God you're turning to Faith you wouldn't be here if you did that thing Hallelujah you got great faith Hallelujah there's a reason for that there's a reason sometimes it's unconfessed sin you could pour a gallon of oil on a person and scream till you got hoarse it'll never move that devil no sir you've got to confess that that's what discernment does say go and make that right bring that secret out right but it's slow doing that you see and then the rest of them get impatient and say I never I never got prayed for but we want to find a way now what takes place the real basic of Divine Healing let's stand to our feet I'm gonna stop right there my God's Grace said musicians can come learning from Jesus how many glad to learn from Jesus today like I said there are many things I want to learn uh as a Christian I want to learn especially as a preacher to make things so simple that everyone here can understand even the deepest topics like the Thunders or the third pole or the Rapture whatever it may be I want to learn how to make things so simple that whether you know Lena had also been here a year and a half or two years or whatever that I I can but I can yield to the Holy Spirit to make something so simple they can catch it maybe not the maybe not the fullness of it but just to make it so simple and take all the maybe confusion out or all the any doubt or any any questions out of it I'd like to learn how to do that by God's grace like I said I like to learn to yield to the Holy Spirit now this is what I really like to learn how to do amen to preach where the secrets of your heart will be revealed and you'll know God is talking right to you that's what I like to do that would be the greatest blessing of my life if I could learn how to do that that way I know God's children are getting fed God's word God's sheep can leave here full that's what I want I want God's people to enjoy the word of God enjoy worshiping enjoy praying I want you to feel God's presence praise God I love like like I always tell you my testimonials you know why I tell you that because that encourages me I hope it encourages you too amen I want everybody to be encouraged by God's grace keep fighting the good fight of Faith there's a crowd awaiting you there's a crap the endurance crowd Hallelujah you will have it by God's grace so let's bow our heads I think I'm going to end like I did last time you know think in your heart what what is what do you feel like God wants you to learn oh yeah there's a whole lot I didn't get to okay that I'm glad I could separate dude I was a hold on I had to hold other things on the bride tree and everything like that I forgot about that this bar hits for a moment I'm not actually going to stop the live stream here God bless live streamers darling and Karis oh
