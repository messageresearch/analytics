[43:45] we just counted a privilege Minister not
[43:48] to us in Jesus Christ Church said Amen
[43:52] praise God let's take our Bibles for
[43:53] tonight the God's grace we'll go to the
[43:57] scripture I like to look into you
[43:58] looking at the kingdom of God we've been
[44:01] looking at it quite frequently tonight I
[44:04] like to look at a couple parables and
[44:06] we'll see how far we can get
[44:08] so let's go to Revelation 13 by the
[44:13] grace of the Lord I believe we'll just
[44:14] go there we'd like to look at the the
[44:21] symbols that deal with sin so let's go
[44:23] to Revelation 13 of course we're not
[44:26] negative I'm sorry we're not majoring on
[44:28] the negative here focuses on the
[44:29] negative but when we look at the
[44:32] negative it always illuminates the
[44:34] positive and always manifest the truth
[44:36] if we look to the scripture here so
[44:38] let's read this parable here tonight the
[44:42] grain of the mustard seed here praise
[44:44] God earth you chapter 13 I'm sorry did I
[44:49] say revelation 13 I'm sorry Matthew
[44:51] chapter 13
[44:52] maybe that song were these got me
[44:54] thinking about Revelation worthy the
[44:57] lamb forgive me my fault revelation 13
[45:01] I'm sorry Matthew 13 thank you goodness
[45:09] my goodness Matthew 13 my all right and
[45:16] I'd like to look at the leaven let's
[45:18] look at the leaven scripture here
[45:20] tonight I apologize I want to find it
[45:24] real quick here in my Bible the 31 oh
[45:28] thank you sir appreciate that yes thank
[45:31] you thank you appreciate that
[45:32] oh yeah that's the and then Elevens
[45:36] right after that yeah so we can do 31 to
[45:38] 33 thank you appreciate that
[45:39] all right Matthew 13 not revelation
[45:42] Matthew 13:31
[45:45] I'll read verse 31 another parable put
[45:47] he forth unto them saying the kingdom of
[45:49] heaven is like to a grain of mustard
[45:51] seed which a man took and sowed in his
[45:54] field first
[45:55] which indeed is the least of all seeds
[45:58] but when it has grown it is the greatest
[46:00] among herbs and becometh a tree so that
[46:03] the birds of the air come and lodge in
[46:06] the branches thereof now let's read
[46:08] verse 33 together here on three one two
[46:10] three another parable spake he unto them
[46:14] the kingdom of heaven is like unto
[46:16] leaven which a woman took and hid in
[46:19] three measures of meal till the whole
[46:22] was 11 may God has busing reading of his
[46:24] word you may be seated I'm just gonna
[46:27] put a visual there but I don't have many
[46:31] quotes here tonight they'll just got a
[46:33] few visuals just to kind of keep us
[46:35] thinking about the kingdom of heaven
[46:37] this of course is a chapter I wrote I
[46:39] think Joy's already may have read this
[46:41] chapter here and edit it for me I had to
[46:43] expand it sister I forgot to tell you I
[46:44] told you about that but had to expand it
[46:46] because I went through the scripture and
[46:47] I seen there were 16 parables about the
[46:50] kingdom of heaven so first I thought
[46:52] there was only seven not really maybe
[46:55] studying it as much as I ought to so
[46:59] Lydia you can switch over there and I
[47:01] found out there were sixteen so by God's
[47:09] grace so I look at the the grain of the
[47:12] mustard seed tonight and the leaven hid
[47:14] in the three measures of meal tonight
[47:17] okay this is part eight I believe of the
[47:20] series and will be rejoicing in the word
[47:24] of the Lord here alright so let me go
[47:26] back here so I've now found out I could
[47:29] be wrong on this too but I've given a
[47:30] lot of time and study hopefully I got it
[47:32] nailed down now because I went and
[47:34] searched every time the New Testament
[47:35] said Kingdom and then I was focusing on
[47:37] Jesus's parables and I believe I found
[47:40] 16 parables of the kingdom of heaven I
[47:43] hope that's right
[47:44] I once thought there was only seven but
[47:47] shows it gotta study something now a lot
[47:49] more before I make a statement like that
[47:52] themes of the kingdom now I divided
[47:54] these sixteen into some common themes I
[47:56] just kind of had this thought come upon
[47:58] my heart as I was studying it I saw how
[48:00] there was themes so like tonight we'll
[48:02] look at this we'll look at the the two
[48:04] parables on sin and what's interesting
[48:06] that I found is that each theme has
[48:09] Italy
[48:09] two parables and that's like Jesus said
[48:11] in the mouth of two or three witnesses
[48:12] let every word be established so that
[48:15] was very comforting to my heart the Holy
[48:18] Ghost and the rapture have two that are
[48:20] very similar the King son and the ten
[48:22] virgins five of them deal with plain
[48:26] salvation the treasure in the field the
[48:30] pearl great price will may be preached
[48:32] on those may be Lord willing next
[48:33] Wednesday the labors in the vineyard the
[48:36] unmerciful servant and the seed cast in
[48:38] the ground this has been a real fresh
[48:39] revelation to me this parable shows the
[48:42] three works of grace justification
[48:44] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:46] I never seen that I really started
[48:47] studying that and praying about that
[48:49] because brother Brandt well we know the
[48:51] Bible says Jesus says the kingdom of
[48:52] heaven is within you so the kingdom of
[48:55] heaven has to be the baptism of the Holy
[48:57] Ghost so why would Jesus use a parable
[49:00] about the three stages of wheat unless
[49:04] he was talking about the three works of
[49:05] grace which is ZQ also prophesied of new
[49:09] heart new spirit my spirit amen so you
[49:13] can totally see that those three stages
[49:16] all through the entire Bible of course
[49:18] there's a whole lot more of them you
[49:20] know but I'll just stop right there
[49:22] now there's to our own kind and time
[49:26] rather conditions two of those you've
[49:28] already preached on those I just put the
[49:29] ones I preached in orange just to give
[49:30] me a visual there's two on the Jew and
[49:32] Gentile the wicked husbandmen and the
[49:35] great supper and there's three on
[49:39] responsibility or I just maybe call it
[49:41] stewardship I could get rid of service
[49:43] and responsibility and we just preached
[49:45] on that last week of the four grounds
[49:47] last week by the grace of the Lord so
[49:50] hopefully those have been a blessing and
[49:51] they've been a blessing to you now still
[49:53] my prayer church is your pastor still my
[49:55] prayer Ben pastored almost 14 well
[49:57] thirteen half years that everybody can
[49:59] recognize their gifts and talents in
[50:01] their life
[50:01] my that's and that's one of the great
[50:03] mysteries is the mystery of God's will
[50:05] so if you don't know keep praying keep
[50:06] seeking God devote extra time and study
[50:11] and prayer to it so that you can know
[50:13] what talents or what pounds the Lord has
[50:15] placed in your life and then you can
[50:17] invest in them right now you can see
[50:19] such you can see them abound as Peter
[50:21] said you'll see them abound more and
[50:22] more
[50:23] you know as all these all these
[50:24] character attributes of a statue
[50:26] preferred manner in you you'll see them
[50:28] abound more and more that's my desire
[50:30] and I'm gonna just Lord willing one
[50:32] Sunday we'll look at gifts again and
[50:33] we'll keep preaching on that to try to
[50:35] just clinch that nail so everybody can
[50:39] be seeking God for their gifts in life
[50:41] and their purpose in life
[50:43] praise God so let's go back here I'll
[50:45] just I'll just leave it up there I don't
[50:46] really like I said I don't have a lot of
[50:47] quotes to show today I just want to kind
[50:49] of show the scriptural teachings on
[50:51] these and how the Prophet brought these
[50:54] out alright so we'll try to get to these
[50:57] two like I said we have time maybe we'll
[50:59] jump to some of the other ones here you
[51:00] know sometimes I think I got plenty of
[51:02] notes I go so fast sometimes I don't
[51:04] think I have enough and it goes so slow
[51:05] so many times of course it depends on
[51:07] the poll of the people praise God so may
[51:09] Lord bless us tonight now the first one
[51:12] here the grain of mustardseed now I
[51:14] tried to try to give these revelations
[51:17] or one one sentence revelation just to
[51:20] kind of make it concise so it seems like
[51:23] the revelation of the grain of
[51:25] mustardseed is that the false church
[51:27] started small but grew until it was
[51:30] large and filled with all demonic powers
[51:34] okay now there's there's two quotes on
[51:37] the church age book where brother
[51:39] Branham does use these parables for that
[51:41] purpose and so that's why I I take that
[51:45] stance on it now of course it will look
[51:48] at the other side it could we know
[51:50] mustard seed Jesus does say mustard seed
[51:52] does represent faith but as far as the
[51:55] kingdom of heaven it seemed knowing the
[51:58] end times and knowing the church ages
[52:00] like we do and knowing how brother
[52:02] Branham worked about four or five years
[52:04] on the church age book it would seem
[52:06] that after four or five years of working
[52:07] on the book and those symbols that all
[52:09] those thoughts were well thought out and
[52:11] they were salt with prayer to the Lord
[52:14] and so it seemed like the main emphasis
[52:17] of this parable is to show the
[52:19] deceitfulness of sin and how the false
[52:22] church started small but then grew to as
[52:24] large and filled all didn't I'm sorry
[52:27] demonic powers so this is the parable
[52:31] and it has sort like we said dual
[52:34] meaning okay but the
[52:36] get meaning it seems to be more powerful
[52:38] or more prevalent in Scripture and it's
[52:41] especially the message than the first
[52:43] but the first one is how a tiny mustard
[52:47] seed is like under faith in God's Word
[52:51] so we can read that in Matthew 17:20
[52:54] I'll just turn there Matthew 17:20 we'll
[52:57] just read it out of scripture Matthew
[53:04] 17:20 and Jesus said unto them because
[53:08] of your unbelief for verily I say to you
[53:10] if you have faith as a grain of mustard
[53:12] seed you shall say unto this mountain
[53:15] remove hence to yonder place and it
[53:18] shall remove and nothing shall be
[53:20] impossible unto you now we looked at
[53:23] this recently when we preached times and
[53:25] seasons and brother man takes the same
[53:27] scripture remember he struggled with
[53:28] this scripture for years what does it
[53:30] mean how can a man do this and brother
[53:33] man was struggling with Jesus said this
[53:35] before the atonement you know before is
[53:36] the cross and everything and and then
[53:39] the Holy Spirit showed brother Branham
[53:41] that it was God it was God using the
[53:44] human voice it wasn't that human thought
[53:47] thought in his own words himself but it
[53:49] was God actually borrowing that person
[53:51] like me borrowing this microphone amen
[53:54] God borrows the human's voice and it's
[53:56] God speaking through the individual and
[53:59] not the individuals thoughts themselves
[54:01] in other words this person if they're
[54:03] going to speak to the mountain they got
[54:05] to have the mind of Christ first they
[54:07] men before they speak praise God and so
[54:09] that was the great revelation that the
[54:11] Prophet learned when he spoke six
[54:13] squirrels into existence he learned that
[54:15] it's it's the faith it's faith is a
[54:18] revelation of the will of God brother
[54:20] Branham says and so that's what each
[54:23] person must speak to to remove a
[54:26] mountain in the message milligrams cause
[54:29] mountain sicknesses and so church you
[54:32] know you and I can look back on our
[54:33] lives and we can see times where
[54:35] obstacles seemingly as great as a
[54:38] mountain have been moved by us speaking
[54:41] the word right think about great trials
[54:44] or great struggles that you've had to
[54:46] endure in life and alls it took was the
[54:49] anointing of
[54:50] the anointing of the Holy Spirit to come
[54:53] upon you you speak the word and then the
[54:56] mountain moves whether it was that day
[54:57] whether it was instantly or whether it
[54:59] took a month or a week or five years or
[55:01] whatever it took
[55:03] there's power and the Word of God when
[55:05] the when God speaks or an individual
[55:07] it's just like God speaking amen
[55:09] that's not the individuals word anymore
[55:11] it's God's word amen and so we've seen
[55:14] it as well I was rehearsing often but
[55:15] speaking of different you know to these
[55:17] two situations where women could have
[55:19] babies we've spoken the word and then
[55:21] instantly right after that soon after
[55:23] that they had babies amen when doctors
[55:26] have told them you're never gonna have a
[55:27] baby impossible but the power of the
[55:29] spoken word when it's spoken by God's
[55:32] will it moves the mountain amen and
[55:34] that's not for us to pat ourselves on
[55:36] the back or know how to make us more
[55:39] humble to realize that thank God we got
[55:41] out of the flesh and could get in the
[55:42] spirit long enough to do God's will
[55:44] amen because it's so often we don't do
[55:47] God's will and we want to do God's will
[55:49] praise God we want to walk in the spirit
[55:51] as often as we possibly can we know we
[55:53] backside daily and so forth like that
[55:55] but we want to get back in the spirits
[55:58] moving amen now that's the scripture
[56:02] about how faith is small like a mustard
[56:05] seed now and then this faith brings
[56:09] forth miracle fruit when it's kept out
[56:13] of the heart so let's go to mark 11:22
[56:16] mark 11 22 and 23 yeah very similar
[56:26] scripture here parallel passage and
[56:30] Jesus answering saith unto them have
[56:33] faith in God for verily I send you that
[56:35] whosoever shall say in this mountain be
[56:37] thou removed and be thou cast in the sea
[56:40] and shall not doubt in his heart so the
[56:43] sea there is doubt that will creep in
[56:46] but shall believe that those things
[56:48] which he says shall come to pass he
[56:50] shall have whatsoever he saith amen and
[56:53] brother him you know many times he
[56:55] likens dau unto a cloud like on a cloudy
[56:58] overcast day right but man was talking
[57:02] about in if God be with us where be all
[57:03] them
[57:04] caracals right on the it was the the New
[57:06] Year's Eve service in 1961 I believe if
[57:08] I'm not mistaken and brother Adam
[57:10] preaches on that and he talks about how
[57:12] Gideon he was a gallant man but he said
[57:17] a lot of doubt had clouded over Israel
[57:19] because they had had a miracle how to
[57:22] had profits for a while and Gideon said
[57:24] if God be with us where be all the
[57:25] miracles and brother Adam said that the
[57:27] angel the Lord had to come to Gideon and
[57:29] then Gideon had to prove God Gideon was
[57:32] the kind of person that needed proof
[57:34] from God before he would act and church
[57:37] many times were that way to God show me
[57:39] a sign
[57:40] God showed me a sign God showed me a
[57:43] sign
[57:44] there's nothing wrong with that church
[57:45] like Guinea was a man of God but see God
[57:48] knew and Robert I remember I read the
[57:50] quote last Sunday that God works with
[57:52] the creature the way he's made some
[57:55] people don't need signs some people just
[57:57] need to feel that anointing and then
[57:59] they just speak whatever comes their
[58:00] mind praise God they don't have to have
[58:03] a sign but many of us well we want to go
[58:05] to Lourdes and prayer and say Lord I'll
[58:08] know it's you if I pray and let this
[58:10] come to pass
[58:11] right and there's nothing wrong with
[58:14] that you know we know that as long as
[58:16] the heart is right God doesn't mind
[58:18] being proved does he because he even
[58:20] says it with ties prove me right prove
[58:23] if you obey your ties see if I won't
[58:26] open the windows of heaven and pour our
[58:28] blessings you don't have room to receive
[58:30] amen
[58:30] I think that how many witness that he
[58:32] does it I am I'm a witness praise God
[58:35] that he does it and we're faithful he
[58:38] pours out the blessings praise God but
[58:40] see the thing we got to do is keep faith
[58:42] in our heart and not doubt the Word of
[58:45] God now what's he what's comforting to
[58:47] us and only don't let the devil play
[58:49] guilt trip on you well I doubted for
[58:50] awhile I doubted for a while don't let
[58:52] the devil put a guilt trip on you
[58:53] because I know a man who who's called
[58:56] the father of faith and he went through
[58:57] many doubt trials did he not did not
[59:01] Abraham down a few times and and even
[59:03] bring forth an Ishmael and he died you
[59:05] know he went through some difficult
[59:07] times but the Bible said and brother man
[59:09] tells us when God wrote the divine
[59:11] commentary on Abraham the Bible said he
[59:13] staggered not at the promise of God amen
[59:16] I don't know you see he didn't give up
[59:18] on God he made a mistake he fell short
[59:21] of the glory God but a righteous man is
[59:22] not judged by what he falls a righteous
[59:24] man is judged by how many times he Rises
[59:27] amen so see don't let the devil beat you
[59:30] up and say well I thought I spoke the
[59:31] Word of God five years ago or I thought
[59:33] it was maybe it wasn't
[59:34] don't doubt keep believing praise God
[59:37] keep trusting in the Living God never
[59:39] lose your confidence cast out away
[59:41] therefore your confidence in their
[59:43] Living God amen see faith many times has
[59:46] to last longer than a week
[59:49] it's gotta last longer than a month or
[59:51] longer than a year longer than a decade
[59:54] Abraham's faith lasted 25 years right
[59:56] and then he had that faith when he had
[59:58] to take Isaac up there to be sacrificed
[1:00:01] again his faith had to keep lasting but
[1:00:03] church you know and I know if it's God's
[1:00:05] faith and if it's a mustard seed and you
[1:00:07] keep watering that faith it's gonna grow
[1:00:10] into something great praise God with
[1:00:12] each trial that you get victory over of
[1:00:14] each trial your faith increases how many
[1:00:17] can say Amen look at your life over last
[1:00:19] year you know you overcome this you
[1:00:21] overcome that you overcome criticism you
[1:00:23] overcome a lack of money you overcome a
[1:00:26] sickness and your health being attacked
[1:00:29] you overcome all these things but what
[1:00:31] does it do each time it prepares you for
[1:00:33] the next battle praise God each time
[1:00:35] you're gonna feel a little stronger and
[1:00:37] each time you get a little more
[1:00:38] confident in God then I know God he was
[1:00:40] with me last time he'll be with me this
[1:00:42] time amen like David he was with me with
[1:00:45] the line he was with me with the bear
[1:00:46] and God will be with me to overcome this
[1:00:49] Goliath Amen honey to this uncircumcised
[1:00:52] philistine Amen so see it's we have to
[1:00:56] keep the doubt out of our heart and the
[1:00:58] way to do that is prayer worship
[1:01:01] confession praise God coming to the
[1:01:03] house of God amen to receive and be
[1:01:06] refreshed
[1:01:07] remember Bertram's house is the house of
[1:01:09] God is a hospital praise God
[1:01:12] the Good Samaritan parable brother Ram
[1:01:14] teaches on he says see Jesus was that
[1:01:16] Samaritan he's the one that thank God
[1:01:19] thank God when you were wounded he
[1:01:20] poured in the oil and the wine I know
[1:01:23] yeah
[1:01:24] he poured in the baptism with Holy Ghost
[1:01:26] he poured in the stimulation and then he
[1:01:28] takes you off to an inn and by the
[1:01:29] and says that in keeper is your pastor
[1:01:32] but don't be upset don't be discouraged
[1:01:34] God give him two pence God give them the
[1:01:36] spirit and truth praise God
[1:01:38] amen so when you're as sure as you're
[1:01:41] regaining strength as you're growing as
[1:01:43] you're as you're coming and getting
[1:01:44] healthy in the house of God your pastor
[1:01:47] will preach the Holy Spirit and oh
[1:01:49] preach truth and that'll be enough and
[1:01:51] when Jesus comes back at the end the
[1:01:53] parable says if he owes the preacher
[1:01:55] anything he'll give it to you but she's
[1:01:57] thinking oh it's nothing amen he don't
[1:01:59] need to owes nothing all he's given his
[1:02:01] grace is sufficient for our weaknesses
[1:02:03] praise God he shall have a gyro
[1:02:06] he's provided all things amen hallelujah
[1:02:09] so see God's faith that he gives us is
[1:02:12] small like a mustard seed but we've got
[1:02:15] to protect that praise God how many
[1:02:16] protecting it tonight you're holding on
[1:02:19] to the promise of God you're watering
[1:02:21] the promise of God and you want to see
[1:02:23] it grow into something great in your
[1:02:24] life amen so that when the mountain
[1:02:27] comes you're able to speak to the
[1:02:29] mountain and move the mountain amen by
[1:02:31] the power of God hallelujah as we said
[1:02:35] we when they're in Albion a few weeks
[1:02:36] ago there's numerous sisters that come
[1:02:38] up with doubt and brothers that come up
[1:02:39] with doubt and lying spirits you know
[1:02:41] hovering over them and each time as we
[1:02:44] just got down to the very cause of this
[1:02:47] as we got down to the root of every
[1:02:49] little root of bitterness or the
[1:02:51] whatever root it was when it was rooted
[1:02:53] up then the mountain or whatever this
[1:02:55] obstacle was it had to leave praise God
[1:02:57] and tears of Thanksgiving and shouts of
[1:03:01] joy were experienced in other words
[1:03:03] mountains were moved by faith amen the
[1:03:06] will of God revealed and then mountains
[1:03:09] moving those mountains my lay there for
[1:03:11] five years ten years twenty years some
[1:03:14] of them thirty years some of them 60
[1:03:16] years old and not knowing if they're
[1:03:17] saved or born again but when the Holy
[1:03:19] Spirit begins up Rudy when the Holy
[1:03:21] Spirit begins the movie you're gonna see
[1:03:23] mountains move if you can just believe
[1:03:25] with faith in your heart amen it's as
[1:03:29] simple just saying I believe I believe I
[1:03:31] have confidence I know God's Word can
[1:03:34] never fail amen
[1:03:35] oh my so small little mustard seed but
[1:03:38] it brings forth great things if we can
[1:03:41] just keep out all the doubts
[1:03:43] I like my brother branham said he said
[1:03:44] doubt your doubts right doubt your
[1:03:48] doubts if you're doubting something well
[1:03:50] no I shouldn't have that why do I have
[1:03:52] then I doubt that Satan's lying right
[1:03:54] he's a liar and a father of lies praise
[1:03:58] God
[1:03:58] so let's doubt our doubts and let's hold
[1:04:01] on to God's unchanging hand if we're the
[1:04:03] seed of Abraham then we know we're the
[1:04:05] friend of God as well more than a friend
[1:04:07] were his bride amen
[1:04:10] remember program said Jesus is
[1:04:12] whispering love secrets to his bride as
[1:04:14] we approach the wedding right he's
[1:04:17] whispering his love secrets his promises
[1:04:20] amen
[1:04:21] hallelujah now I'd like to move now to
[1:04:24] the the negative side cuz I it seems to
[1:04:26] be there's more scriptural support here
[1:04:30] for this parable being about the false
[1:04:34] church kind of the wheat and the tares
[1:04:36] you know you have the wheat with any
[1:04:37] other tares and the tares are so there's
[1:04:39] so many of them you know that that they
[1:04:42] can't root up the tares because if you
[1:04:43] read of the tares to read up the root up
[1:04:45] the wheat as well as we looked at at the
[1:04:48] parable the net you know the net that's
[1:04:51] all that's all about you know the end
[1:04:53] time conditions how there's good vessels
[1:04:55] and bad vessels there's the the
[1:04:57] anointing falls on the just and the
[1:04:59] unjust praise God the anointed ones at
[1:05:01] the end time so we have to recognize
[1:05:03] that Jesus not just all of his King all
[1:05:06] of his kingdom parables don't just deal
[1:05:08] with good things or happy things many of
[1:05:10] them reveal the enemy praise God and we
[1:05:13] ought to be thankful for that
[1:05:14] that's the glory of the seals the glory
[1:05:16] that seals is that yes we can see our
[1:05:18] four anointings but the glorious we see
[1:05:20] that anointing in order to feed the
[1:05:22] white horse rider praise God the red
[1:05:25] horse rider the black rider The Pale
[1:05:26] Rider that's the glory of it that we
[1:05:28] have the anointing to defeat Satan and
[1:05:31] every one of his tricks if you're not
[1:05:33] excited about that you better get
[1:05:34] excited about that hey man you ought to
[1:05:37] be excited that sin gets for exposed in
[1:05:39] your life and doesn't become something
[1:05:41] but doesn't become a big mountain or a
[1:05:43] root of bitterness you ought to be
[1:05:44] thankful that you can fly above all
[1:05:46] those temptations with that ego
[1:05:48] anointing amen we ought to be amen
[1:05:51] hallelujah now here's the mysterious
[1:05:54] part many people
[1:05:57] don't see the false church in the
[1:05:58] scripture yes I can recognize the faith
[1:06:00] but we also recognize the false part of
[1:06:03] it too because the the early false
[1:06:07] church started by the very smallest of
[1:06:09] lies
[1:06:10] the Jesus calls it Nikolay it ISM and
[1:06:13] then now it's flourishing and it's so
[1:06:16] great now to eat we preached on the
[1:06:18] Mystery Babylon a few months ago it's so
[1:06:19] great now where the Bible said that all
[1:06:23] the kings of the earth make love to the
[1:06:24] Roman Catholic Church all nations all
[1:06:28] nations all nations are deceived it's so
[1:06:31] it's grown so great that every nation is
[1:06:35] going to come in to some type of evil
[1:06:38] relationship with the Roman Catholic
[1:06:40] Church and it's gonna be a worldwide
[1:06:43] thing and that's what we see here the
[1:06:45] worldwide habitation of devils and this
[1:06:48] great I'm sorry this small little sea
[1:06:50] that goes into this great church that's
[1:06:52] filled with all demonic powers now
[1:06:56] notice how God protected his church in
[1:06:59] their infancy so if you go to the
[1:07:02] scripture let's go to acts five thirteen
[1:07:04] and fourteen
[1:07:05] notice how God protected the church acts
[1:07:09] five thirteen and fourteen
[1:07:20] ax5 13 and 14 now remember this is right
[1:07:23] after Ananias and Sapphira now there's a
[1:07:25] good teaching for Sunday Peter had the
[1:07:27] gift of discernment right because they
[1:07:29] come lying to him but see how the see
[1:07:32] how the gifts kept the church clean see
[1:07:34] how that see why we need to be able to
[1:07:36] be we have to be so yielded to the Holy
[1:07:38] Spirit that we have gifts moving in here
[1:07:40] that would discern a lying spirit right
[1:07:43] god forbid it should come in but God
[1:07:45] test his church right and Satan's
[1:07:46] pointing every gun in our church to try
[1:07:48] to take down our church because we say
[1:07:50] we got the baptism of Holy Ghost we say
[1:07:52] we got the message of the hour
[1:07:53] we say we got thus saith the Lord so
[1:07:55] Satan's got every one of his guns
[1:07:56] trained at us so what better Church to
[1:07:59] come in and and try to see with lies see
[1:08:02] what do we need we need the gifts in
[1:08:03] operation right they don't have to be in
[1:08:06] the service they can be outside -
[1:08:07] doesn't really matter God we shouldn't
[1:08:09] care where they happen we should just
[1:08:10] care that they that they are used for
[1:08:12] the glory of God amen we should be eat
[1:08:14] just as yielded in here as we were yield
[1:08:16] in the parking lot amen
[1:08:17] we should be just as yield in our prayer
[1:08:19] closet before church or just as you'd in
[1:08:22] our car like our sister was yield at the
[1:08:23] air at the grocery store what a
[1:08:25] beautiful testimony of how God can speak
[1:08:27] to a heart no matter where you are we
[1:08:29] should be so you know wherever we are
[1:08:30] that God can speak to us and then
[1:08:33] through us to keep the church clean amen
[1:08:35] hallelujah
[1:08:37] remember any church that doesn't receive
[1:08:38] the gifts brother Branham says is not
[1:08:40] the real bride so see bride if we're a
[1:08:43] bride we can't say well you know the
[1:08:45] gifts or just something we don't have to
[1:08:47] worry about know we have we want the
[1:08:49] major the majors the baptismal egos we
[1:08:51] want the giver but then if you got the
[1:08:52] giver he wants to show you the gifts
[1:08:54] praise God
[1:08:56] so see we got to have a great balance
[1:08:58] there but look at this gift of
[1:08:59] discernment see they couldn't lie to
[1:09:01] Peter cuz he got this gift of the sermon
[1:09:03] and the Holy Spirit picked it up he said
[1:09:05] you lied to the Holy Ghost amen
[1:09:07] now verse 13 and 14 and of the rest
[1:09:11] Durst no man join himself to them but
[1:09:13] the people magnified to them so see at
[1:09:16] the beginning God protected this people
[1:09:19] see that not anybody could join their
[1:09:22] church at the beginning the Holy Ghost
[1:09:23] was fallen there under the line
[1:09:24] anointing their boat they got signs
[1:09:26] wonders and miracles and and it's just
[1:09:29] on a tremendous level it's a
[1:09:31] old tremendous level and no man could
[1:09:34] join God was protecting her because
[1:09:36] she's in her infancy don't you mothers
[1:09:38] coddle your babies right after they're
[1:09:39] born do you let anybody hold him I know
[1:09:41] my wife doesn't I don't need really
[1:09:44] either I don't like I don't like we got
[1:09:46] a brand-new baby just give her to
[1:09:47] somebody who's coughing or walk off the
[1:09:50] street you don't know what the germs
[1:09:51] they've been around you want to protect
[1:09:52] that baby
[1:09:53] and so Jesus here is protecting the
[1:09:56] early church and he kept it keeps
[1:09:58] everybody out for a while remember the
[1:10:00] church agents art to what 80 53 when the
[1:10:04] Holy Ghost fall 80 33 or 34 one of those
[1:10:07] I'm not sure and I'm not really a
[1:10:09] scholar like that but so for about 20
[1:10:11] years or more God protects them and God
[1:10:15] lets them grow and become strong and
[1:10:18] feed on the sincere milk of the word of
[1:10:20] God amen Oh church have you tasted
[1:10:23] tonight that the Lord is good amen
[1:10:25] Peter said have you tasted that God is
[1:10:28] gracious how does that taste
[1:10:31] oh it's delicious a man its glorious
[1:10:33] it's wonderful God is gracious and
[1:10:36] that's the taste way we should leave in
[1:10:37] our mouths when we leave service God is
[1:10:40] gracious God is merciful hallelujah
[1:10:44] look at verse 14 and believers were the
[1:10:48] more added to the Lord look at added to
[1:10:51] the Lord multitudes both of men and
[1:10:54] women talked about growing pains and
[1:10:58] then the next chapter they got growing
[1:10:59] pains right all these people are these
[1:11:01] Grecians our organ where is our daily
[1:11:03] bread where is our daily bread and then
[1:11:04] they get wisdom to raise up deacons
[1:11:06] don't they see every church goes through
[1:11:08] growing pains don't they when God adds
[1:11:11] to the church there's a little growing
[1:11:12] pains but there's just row fees of God's
[1:11:14] grace amen
[1:11:15] hallelujah we grow in grace and
[1:11:17] knowledge of the Lord but see God was
[1:11:20] keeping his church pure at the beginning
[1:11:23] keeping them from the the pollution of
[1:11:27] all these false teachers now also notice
[1:11:32] this - I want to just reading some of
[1:11:34] these notes I have here around now
[1:11:38] around 1890 when John wrote his epistle
[1:11:41] first John now
[1:11:44] Ford they're about 60 years and now he
[1:11:46] says there's not just a few Antichrist
[1:11:48] he said there's many Antichrist in the
[1:11:50] world so ciose it took was a little bit
[1:11:53] of time and they go from having no no
[1:11:56] evil really in the church other than
[1:11:58] just their he own humanity but God was
[1:12:00] keeping out all the false teachers for a
[1:12:02] while but then 60 years later there's
[1:12:04] many Antichrist out into the world so
[1:12:07] let's read that so you got that as well
[1:12:11] well I don't think I put that one in my
[1:12:13] notes so sorry
[1:12:14] I'm sorry I won't be able to pull that
[1:12:16] one up I thought I would I must've
[1:12:18] forgot my footnote on that one oh my so
[1:12:20] forgive me fast-forward are now 2000
[1:12:23] years and now the false church is the
[1:12:25] greatest largest group in the world
[1:12:27] praise God
[1:12:29] right the Roman Catholic Church is the
[1:12:31] greatest church in the world right so
[1:12:35] see they went from having hardly any at
[1:12:38] all none 60 years having many and now
[1:12:41] it's almost worldwide the world the
[1:12:44] world of the field is almost all tears
[1:12:46] but thank God there's a little group in
[1:12:48] Akron praise God thank god there's a
[1:12:51] little group in Alabama praise the Lord
[1:12:52] there's a little group in Pennsylvania
[1:12:54] there's little groups and there's little
[1:12:56] patches of wheat and Jesus thinks so
[1:12:58] much of it he'll come back just for a
[1:13:00] little bit
[1:13:01] Jesus will glean just a little bit
[1:13:03] because he thinks so much of that wheat
[1:13:04] amen
[1:13:05] how do you judge the thing we got to do
[1:13:08] the Bible said be patient therefore unto
[1:13:12] the harvest see we get so impatient I
[1:13:14] want the Lord to come now every year
[1:13:16] well the Lord's gonna come in 2016 the
[1:13:18] Lord's gonna come in 2017 the Lord I get
[1:13:20] so tired of it after a while let's stop
[1:13:22] guessing the year let's just get ready
[1:13:23] praise God
[1:13:24] let's just stop guessing years let's
[1:13:27] just start saying the Lord sent me or
[1:13:29] lord help me to send some missionary
[1:13:30] lord help us to do something for your
[1:13:32] kingdom help us get the all the last
[1:13:35] seeds out there let's not guess that it
[1:13:36] let's do something about it praise God
[1:13:39] amen ah so this mustard mustard tree on
[1:13:46] the negative part of this parable is the
[1:13:48] Roman Catholic Church because she claims
[1:13:50] to be the mother church or the first
[1:13:53] false Church that rejected the
[1:13:54] leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:57] now notice this great tree is a lodging
[1:14:00] of birds now many birds normally
[1:14:03] symbolize evil spirits right now there's
[1:14:08] one time I shared this with a friend
[1:14:09] recently and there's one time birds
[1:14:12] didn't represent evil and it was with
[1:14:16] Elijah when the crows came in fed a
[1:14:19] member that and I was that's the one
[1:14:22] time I can find in Scripture if anybody
[1:14:23] can find anything else let me know but
[1:14:25] it seems like every other group large
[1:14:28] group of birds always represents evil
[1:14:30] okay the first one was Genesis 15 10 11
[1:14:33] we're not going to read they're just for
[1:14:34] time sake but Abraham God is God's
[1:14:38] showing him the unconditional covenant
[1:14:40] and he divides the beasts and all these
[1:14:42] birds this before he's put to sleep all
[1:14:44] the birds come down and brother Ram says
[1:14:45] that was Abraham driving away the evil
[1:14:48] spirits amen hallelujah
[1:14:50] and then later on in Genesis remember
[1:14:53] Joseph interpreted the dream of the the
[1:14:56] baker remember the Baker the Baker had
[1:14:58] all those birds eating the pie out of
[1:15:00] his head and Joseph interpret all those
[1:15:03] birds as death praise God and then
[1:15:07] revelation 18:2
[1:15:08] says that this woman this Roman Catholic
[1:15:11] Church is a cage of every unclean and
[1:15:14] hateful bird right and so almost every
[1:15:19] time in Scripture other than this one
[1:15:20] time and like I said there could be more
[1:15:22] it seems as if birds oh there's another
[1:15:25] one in our other parable that we
[1:15:27] preached on last week remember the birds
[1:15:28] came down and snatched the seeds by the
[1:15:32] wayside remember that one so right
[1:15:34] there's five witnesses I just gave you
[1:15:35] five times
[1:15:36] whenever you see a bunch of birds it
[1:15:38] seems like it's the evil spirits Jesus
[1:15:41] called it Satan in that parable they
[1:15:43] snatched away the word swiftly out of
[1:15:46] the heart of the person okay so seeing
[1:15:50] this parable Jesus tells with the birds
[1:15:52] in this great great tree you know it
[1:15:54] could represent you know faith or the
[1:15:56] early church but most likely it
[1:15:58] represents the false church because
[1:16:00] that's how she's described in Revelation
[1:16:02] 18 verse 2 she's a habitation and the
[1:16:05] hold of every foul spirit and a cage of
[1:16:10] every unclean
[1:16:11] and hateful bird hallelujah God could
[1:16:14] not give a more brutal honest or
[1:16:16] scathing description of Rome could he
[1:16:17] then saying you're filled with every
[1:16:20] demonic power there ever could be my
[1:16:22] what a rebuke think about that church
[1:16:25] every kind of demon or bird lives in the
[1:16:28] Roman Catholic Church and its system
[1:16:30] right because she's the mother of what
[1:16:32] harlots she got daughters and the proof
[1:16:37] is ever before us is it not mine so see
[1:16:41] Church we gotta be mindful that be
[1:16:44] careful which church you visit amen
[1:16:46] in the message but also especially
[1:16:50] outside the message because if they are
[1:16:52] dot if they agree with Rome then they
[1:16:55] become a home of every evil spirit right
[1:16:59] because they do they partake of the same
[1:17:03] sins that the mother does that turn turn
[1:17:08] ad doctrine and pretty soon they open
[1:17:09] themselves up to all the other spirits
[1:17:11] right by it's just you got to be so
[1:17:14] careful because members Satan comes in
[1:17:16] like the white horse remember he comes
[1:17:18] in like a real small grain of mustard
[1:17:20] seed it's so small he wants you to miss
[1:17:23] it you won't just want you to let it
[1:17:24] slip on through but then it'll grow into
[1:17:27] something awful oh my goodness now in
[1:17:30] the book I'm the next book I'm putting
[1:17:32] this remember last year is about a year
[1:17:34] ago August 2018 all these abuse
[1:17:36] allegations came up in Pennsylvania over
[1:17:41] the course of the last 70 years 300
[1:17:44] priests abused more than a thousand
[1:17:46] victims just in Pennsylvania and that's
[1:17:48] just what was reported it was a grand
[1:17:53] jury report including rapes whippings
[1:17:56] and abortions and then suicides all
[1:17:59] because of the evils in the Roman
[1:18:02] Catholic Church done through priests
[1:18:06] that's right and then I watched this
[1:18:09] video of a man from Pennsylvania that
[1:18:12] sadly experienced the abuse he said
[1:18:14] there's something wrong in the DNA of
[1:18:16] the church because it encourages a right
[1:18:20] season so even they recognize former
[1:18:23] members recognize there's something in
[1:18:25] grow
[1:18:25] wrong in other words they got the wrong
[1:18:27] seed you got the original seed the Word
[1:18:32] of God amen and the Word of God will not
[1:18:35] produce those kind of fruits big fancy
[1:18:38] buildings and beautiful outward but
[1:18:39] inwardly ravening wolves they got the
[1:18:43] wrong seed so it produces corrupt fruit
[1:18:44] we've got the right seat it produces the
[1:18:47] right fruit amen
[1:18:48] hallelujah see the DNA is wrong the
[1:18:51] heart of the core the word of the church
[1:18:55] is wrong of the Roman Catholic Church
[1:18:56] because it's built upon man's Creed's
[1:18:59] said the Word of God and then I read a
[1:19:03] report that said this is the timeline
[1:19:06] it went from Louisiana in 1985 a huge
[1:19:09] outbreak an exposure of the priests and
[1:19:12] then went to Austria in 1999 then I went
[1:19:14] to Boston in 2002 and see Church we
[1:19:16] forget about these things we hear time
[1:19:18] goes by and we just forget but thank
[1:19:21] goodness God is anointing some of these
[1:19:22] journalists to remember her evils and
[1:19:24] her crimes amen
[1:19:26] Ireland in 2009 a huge scandal against
[1:19:30] the Roman Catholic Church to Germany in
[1:19:31] 2010 Netherlands in 2011 Dominican
[1:19:34] Republic in 2014
[1:19:36] Austrian 2017 and now Pennsylvania 2018
[1:19:40] and that's just a few of them that ain't
[1:19:42] all of them I just took a few off the
[1:19:44] CNN report that's on CNN they reported
[1:19:47] that mine see wasn't just one state just
[1:19:50] one church it's a it's a global
[1:19:53] infection can I say like that it's not
[1:19:55] it's an infection it's kind of like Paul
[1:19:58] said the gangrene remember are those
[1:20:00] false preachers I'm a Gnaeus and
[1:20:02] philetus remember it's like gangrene
[1:20:04] they were preaching that the rapture has
[1:20:05] already happened right and Paul said
[1:20:08] it's like gangrene it's eating the
[1:20:10] people alive and that's what the evil in
[1:20:13] the Roman Catholic Church is it's eating
[1:20:15] them alive see they're getting eaten
[1:20:17] from the inside but we shouldn't be
[1:20:19] being eaten from the inside we should be
[1:20:20] growing from the inside amen
[1:20:22] we should be growing from the inside out
[1:20:24] not not eaten alive and not our
[1:20:27] confidence being destroyed in the
[1:20:28] preachers and our churches our
[1:20:30] confidence shouldn't be being eaten
[1:20:31] alive or destroyed our confidence should
[1:20:33] be growing and building because each one
[1:20:35] of us should be watering the seed of God
[1:20:37] with praise
[1:20:38] amen and then last year I saw a report
[1:20:43] where now the nuns are getting accused
[1:20:45] in Pennsylvania see don't stop with the
[1:20:48] priests it's infects the nuns do I mean
[1:20:52] it just it goes to the you know almost
[1:20:54] everyone's involved in other words it's
[1:20:57] just so awful now remember this word
[1:21:01] effeminate in the Bible a lot of people
[1:21:03] don't know what that means but that word
[1:21:06] effeminate in the Bible means child
[1:21:08] molesters
[1:21:09] it doesn't mean a man that looks dresses
[1:21:12] like a woman or has a high-pitched voice
[1:21:14] like a woman like some people think they
[1:21:15] just I don't know sure where they get
[1:21:17] that idea but the word the Bible said
[1:21:19] the effeminate will not inherit the
[1:21:22] kingdom of God if you look it up in the
[1:21:24] Greek it means a man who keeps a child
[1:21:26] for a sex slave
[1:21:28] that's what effeminate means so it says
[1:21:30] I doubters murderers whoremongers
[1:21:34] adulterers fornicators and then it says
[1:21:36] effeminate thieves all these will not
[1:21:39] inherit the kingdom of God so see the
[1:21:41] Bible lays a plane there that the
[1:21:43] effeminate will not inherit the kingdom
[1:21:45] of God see that's why we are a part of
[1:21:48] the kingdom of God because we let the
[1:21:50] little children come to Jesus see they
[1:21:53] route the little children of their NC
[1:21:55] but we pushed the children of Jesus to
[1:21:57] keep their Ennis II to get more holiness
[1:21:59] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:22:01] how did I yeah of course we know sin
[1:22:04] will always affect every person but I'm
[1:22:07] saying we don't Rob the children of
[1:22:08] their innocence we try to point them to
[1:22:10] keep their innocence and experience the
[1:22:12] love of Jesus Christ by honoring their
[1:22:15] body like the Bible says it's a temple
[1:22:17] the Holy Ghost praise God hallelujah in
[1:22:21] a man a real man or woman that's got the
[1:22:23] Holy Ghost won't beat and abuse their
[1:22:25] children they'll balance the scripture
[1:22:26] that says the rod trains the child right
[1:22:28] they won't take that too far because if
[1:22:31] they got the Holy Ghost then they got a
[1:22:32] teacher inside of them praise God and
[1:22:34] the Bible says they have need that no
[1:22:37] man teach you praise God on some of
[1:22:39] these things because the Holy Ghost is
[1:22:41] your teacher inside of you and you
[1:22:42] wouldn't mistreat one of these little
[1:22:44] ones remember the Bible says those that
[1:22:46] mistreat the little ones and teach them
[1:22:49] to do evil it's better it be better for
[1:22:51] them if a millstone was tied
[1:22:52] their neck and then throw it into the
[1:22:54] sea right then the mist each one of
[1:22:57] these little ones oh my mother's
[1:22:59] father's we ought to be so careful what
[1:23:02] we say to our children praise God we
[1:23:04] ought to teach though true to them and
[1:23:07] then live it before them praise God
[1:23:09] oh my see what it is it's a habitation
[1:23:16] of devils and I hate to have to preach
[1:23:18] those things but it's the gospel truth
[1:23:19] my it's a revelation so see many times
[1:23:25] church the group of birds represents
[1:23:27] spirits but when you have God his spirit
[1:23:31] is always represented by one bird the
[1:23:32] Dove amen I don't know yeah at Jesus
[1:23:36] baptism the Holy Ghost descended like a
[1:23:37] dove and abode upon him and remained on
[1:23:41] him empowering his earthly ministry
[1:23:44] praise God I love that the scripture
[1:23:48] says it abode on him so it came to dwell
[1:23:51] on him and it remained on him and he
[1:23:53] went about good
[1:23:54] I'm sorry went about doing good healing
[1:23:56] all that were sick praise God amen now
[1:24:01] let me give you a little bit dad about
[1:24:03] the Roman Catholic Church before I move
[1:24:04] on to the leaven one since I searched it
[1:24:07] out I'm gonna preach it to you praise
[1:24:08] God I invested a lot of hours in this
[1:24:11] and I think it's gonna help people I
[1:24:13] believe not here this is my vision for
[1:24:15] this next book the first book with a
[1:24:17] vision was a show was more of a outreach
[1:24:19] to people who don't know why we dressed
[1:24:21] the way we do and all started with that
[1:24:23] Verizon worker she's like she saw my
[1:24:25] girls I was getting a new iPhone 8 a few
[1:24:27] years ago she's like what your girls
[1:24:29] wear long skirts is that a religious
[1:24:31] belief and I was so blessed I'm like wow
[1:24:33] she's not condemning me she's being kind
[1:24:35] to me and that started the ball rolling
[1:24:37] for that book come like my if she wants
[1:24:40] to know I wish I and I tried to go back
[1:24:41] and give her a book which she was gone
[1:24:43] for she wouldn't you know she wasn't
[1:24:44] there anymore I would love to give her a
[1:24:45] free copy of that book I would but see
[1:24:48] now I got him in my car I got him in my
[1:24:49] backpack in case anybody wants when I
[1:24:51] could just push pass it right out push
[1:24:52] you to it so I'm ready now I learned my
[1:24:55] lesson I won't make that mistake again
[1:24:57] in other words I always have an answer I
[1:24:59] gave her an answer but I want to have
[1:25:00] more of an answer to give to her but my
[1:25:02] vision for this book is the Bible said
[1:25:05] the mystery of God must be finished
[1:25:07] revelation 10 7 and most people don't
[1:25:10] know that brother branham finished every
[1:25:12] mystery that's called a mystery in the
[1:25:14] New Testament most people don't know
[1:25:16] that and many of them church he gave us
[1:25:18] thus saith the Lord
[1:25:19] right he gave us thus saith the Lord
[1:25:22] about the Godhead and that's a mystery
[1:25:23] he said thus saith the Lord turned and
[1:25:25] turned him is of the devil he said those
[1:25:28] people are he said they can be saved but
[1:25:29] they're genuinely wrong he said it's
[1:25:31] time that they know they're wrong thank
[1:25:33] God we knew we were wrong hey bad idea
[1:25:35] thank God and there's other ones that
[1:25:38] were giving us like the mystery of
[1:25:40] iniquity like brother Ram preaches on
[1:25:41] the 4 horse riders and then he turns
[1:25:43] around and said who is this rider it's
[1:25:45] the Antichrist and then he ends the
[1:25:48] second seal by saying that's thus saith
[1:25:50] the Lord
[1:25:50] hey man oh yeah so many of these we've
[1:25:53] got thus saith the Lord on and my vision
[1:25:56] for this book is to be able to spread it
[1:25:58] to preachers and ministers people that
[1:25:59] will study and that they can see how
[1:26:01] brother Han taught any doctrine that's
[1:26:04] called a mystery God finished it for us
[1:26:06] so now we don't for scratch our heads
[1:26:08] and say I wonder what the mystery of
[1:26:09] iniquity is I wonder that what the
[1:26:11] mystery of godliness is I wonder what
[1:26:13] the mystery of the kingdom of heaven it
[1:26:14] is Amen I wonder what the mystery of
[1:26:16] Christ in you the hope of glory is is
[1:26:18] the like Billy Graham says do you get
[1:26:20] the Holy Ghost as soon as you repent is
[1:26:22] it like Oral Roberts as he says you just
[1:26:24] got to speak in tongues to get the Holy
[1:26:26] Ghost no it's like the Bible says when
[1:26:28] the when they were all in one Accord
[1:26:30] they were filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:32] they began to speak in tongues and
[1:26:33] glorify God amen and everybody
[1:26:36] understood their tongue at that time
[1:26:37] amen see something emotional has to
[1:26:40] happen but as I said I don't care what
[1:26:42] form it comes in he said whether it's a
[1:26:44] tongue or a shout or a rejoice or a
[1:26:46] weeper a cry he says I don't care what
[1:26:49] form it comes in as long as something
[1:26:51] happens as long as the person's changed
[1:26:53] amen
[1:26:54] and then if you got the right spirit
[1:26:56] you'll live like it you won't live like
[1:26:58] a devil you won't go back in the world
[1:27:00] your only hunger and thirst for
[1:27:02] righteousness amen
[1:27:04] he said there's no certain evidence it's
[1:27:07] not everybody's got to speak in tongues
[1:27:08] or everybody's got a prophesy or
[1:27:10] everybody's got a scream or shout or cry
[1:27:12] you don't know what to do only God knows
[1:27:14] what you'll do when you get the Holy
[1:27:15] Ghost but one thing's for sure you'll
[1:27:17] know and you get the Holy Ghost a behead
[1:27:19] some
[1:27:20] will happen to you amen and people will
[1:27:22] think you're drunk praise God somebody
[1:27:26] will think you're drunk hallelujah thank
[1:27:29] the Lord amen now let me just go a few
[1:27:32] more data points here my so this this
[1:27:37] mustard seed a tree became the greatest
[1:27:39] among the herbs now the Pew Research
[1:27:43] Center there they're a research
[1:27:45] organization Catholics make up over 50%
[1:27:48] of the global Christian population over
[1:27:51] 50% so if you go around the world one
[1:27:53] out of every two Christians you meet
[1:27:55] will be Catholic of course we know
[1:27:57] they're not genuine meant most the time
[1:27:59] sometimes they are they can be saved as
[1:28:01] foolish version or they can come out of
[1:28:02] that and come into the revelation that
[1:28:04] we have which is gods were latest
[1:28:06] revelation one out of every two would
[1:28:09] say I'm Roman Catholic 36% are
[1:28:12] Protestant 11% as Orthodox with over 1.2
[1:28:19] billion Catholics an ever growing number
[1:28:24] of abuse victims this third parable
[1:28:26] represents the Roman Catholic Church and
[1:28:28] not the true church that's because jesus
[1:28:31] said few there would be that find it
[1:28:33] praise God
[1:28:34] few there would be that find it that's
[1:28:37] the way I can see it by the grace of
[1:28:38] Lord because the Bible said iniquity
[1:28:42] would abound Jesus said because iniquity
[1:28:44] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[1:28:47] so see the church that's growing today
[1:28:49] is the false church in such great great
[1:28:51] numbers right
[1:28:52] we know it's gleaning time for the bride
[1:28:54] just a little here a little there small
[1:28:57] groups here and there and Jesus said he
[1:28:59] had to shorten the days in order that
[1:29:01] some Souls might be saved that's in
[1:29:04] Matthew 24 22 let's read that it's no no
[1:29:06] I don't think it's not a long time since
[1:29:08] we read that at least myself Matthew
[1:29:10] 24:22 and now emerge
[1:29:17] context of this Jesus only spoke Matthew
[1:29:20] 24 and 25 to his was Twelve Apostles I
[1:29:24] can't remember if Judas was gone at this
[1:29:25] point or not but anyways this was just
[1:29:27] amongst his preachers spoken amongst his
[1:29:31] preachers at the 24 22 and except those
[1:29:36] days should be shortened there should be
[1:29:38] no flesh saved so Jesus has to shorten
[1:29:41] the days just so somebody can get saved
[1:29:44] and brothers you know brother bless you
[1:29:46] know it we hear things all time oh great
[1:29:47] revival in this denomination great
[1:29:49] revival in that denomination come on
[1:29:51] come on who's really getting a revival
[1:29:53] to clean out all the trash of their life
[1:29:55] and they go on social media in their
[1:29:57] bikinis oh I'm saying I'm a Christian
[1:29:59] like all social media smoking a
[1:30:01] cigarette or a man just got back from
[1:30:02] the latest Marvel action film in which
[1:30:04] 50 million people died and he's
[1:30:06] rejoicing over all the death I'm sorry
[1:30:08] you took a demon demonic death spirit
[1:30:10] during that movie whether you knew it or
[1:30:12] not amen
[1:30:13] you're worshiping that right worshiping
[1:30:16] spider-man oh yeah a spider-man I got a
[1:30:20] spider spirit in your heart some demonic
[1:30:22] spirit in your heart
[1:30:24] it's worship but see he had a short in
[1:30:27] the days that some will be saved right
[1:30:31] that's Scripture but for the elects sake
[1:30:34] those days shall be shortened hey man
[1:30:37] thank God so see Church no matter what
[1:30:41] these revivals say I don't care what
[1:30:42] they say that's fine I mean I hope
[1:30:44] there's some people getting saved but
[1:30:45] the majority time there's gonna be fewer
[1:30:48] and fewer and fewer people being saved
[1:30:52] jesus said if you there be the founder
[1:30:53] it's because of iniquity it's because a
[1:30:56] license to sin right government's
[1:30:58] letting people send churches letting
[1:31:00] people sin because the license of sin
[1:31:02] iniquity of bounds and the love of
[1:31:04] Christ the real love of Jesus Christ in
[1:31:06] the word is getting smaller and smaller
[1:31:08] that's right
[1:31:10] and remember Paul prophesied the same
[1:31:13] thing
[1:31:13] let's read it in 2nd Timothy 3:13 2nd
[1:31:18] Timothy 3:13 Paul says the same thing so
[1:31:20] not only there's a Lord Jesus prophesy
[1:31:23] that Paul says the same same thing 2nd
[1:31:26] Timothy 3:13
[1:31:31] now this is of course after this a
[1:31:33] beautiful chapter well for us where it
[1:31:36] shows the perilous times the last days
[1:31:38] verse one perilous times shall come and
[1:31:40] describes how there are lovers of
[1:31:41] pleasures more than lovers of God sees
[1:31:44] nothing they don't love God they have
[1:31:46] some love for God but it's covert of
[1:31:47] course is not a gap a love right it's
[1:31:49] just figlio love but the trouble is they
[1:31:52] love sin more than they love God but not
[1:31:54] so in our church we love God more than
[1:31:56] sin amen
[1:31:57] verse 13 but evil men and seducers shall
[1:32:02] wax worse and worse deceiving and being
[1:32:06] deceived amen see the preacher
[1:32:09] especially those mega preachers because
[1:32:11] they have the most influence right over
[1:32:13] worldwide audiences millions of millions
[1:32:15] of people tuned into them they have the
[1:32:16] most deceptive messages many times
[1:32:18] because Satan is using them not every
[1:32:20] time but many times Satan is using them
[1:32:23] to deceive the masses on the greater
[1:32:24] level right because they have access to
[1:32:28] tens of millions of people right hundred
[1:32:30] million people may watch them in a
[1:32:32] month's time or something like that
[1:32:33] so Satan sippin in false doctrine right
[1:32:37] and he's deceiving them he's saying all
[1:32:39] the positive things about the Bible but
[1:32:42] none of the curses all the blessings but
[1:32:44] none of the curses I'm sorry
[1:32:46] God don't work like that when God
[1:32:48] brought Israel in I just seen it in
[1:32:49] Deuteronomy 28 when God brought Israel
[1:32:51] in he made him confess the blessings but
[1:32:54] you better read your Bible remember he
[1:32:56] made them confess the curses - I know
[1:32:59] yeah in other words God's not it's just
[1:33:02] a prosperity gospel right he wants your
[1:33:04] soul to prosper and the only way for
[1:33:07] your soul to prosper is to get rid of
[1:33:08] all the unbelief from the doubt amen to
[1:33:11] get rid of all the sin they got Amen see
[1:33:15] evil seducers wax worse and worse
[1:33:17] deceiving and being deceived not like
[1:33:22] you know the famous the biggest one is
[1:33:24] that I'm not gonna say his name tonight
[1:33:25] sometimes I say it I'm not gonna say it
[1:33:27] tonight I try to do a better job on that
[1:33:28] I'm not against a person's character but
[1:33:30] I got a preach false doctrine so I got a
[1:33:32] preach against false doctrine sorry I
[1:33:34] don't preach false doctrine if I do
[1:33:36] correct me the Holy Spirit will correct
[1:33:39] me praise God
[1:33:40] but see though the main number one
[1:33:43] preacher
[1:33:44] he won't preach against homosexuality
[1:33:46] and he says it openly
[1:33:47] I won't preach against it but I'll ten
[1:33:49] headings of homosexuals in his church
[1:33:51] and they don't even know that they're
[1:33:54] they don't even know that he's sealing
[1:33:56] his fate if you don't repent of that
[1:33:57] because the Bible says the only way you
[1:33:59] rejoice over that is that you have a
[1:34:01] reprobate mind so that's Romans 1 the
[1:34:04] only way you wouldn't stand up against
[1:34:07] that is that your mind has been rejected
[1:34:09] by God so God's giving you over to a lie
[1:34:11] to believe the lie that God loves you
[1:34:15] and God loves your sin and God loves
[1:34:17] homosexuality well in one way you could
[1:34:19] say yeah he died he loved him so much to
[1:34:21] die for him but he doesn't love the fact
[1:34:23] that they reject the word right
[1:34:25] he doesn't love that and without
[1:34:27] repentance they won't be saved and
[1:34:29] neither will we all of us got to repent
[1:34:30] repent be baptized every one of you in
[1:34:33] that lovely name of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:34] Christ and you shall receive the gift of
[1:34:36] the Holy Ghost see so with this prophecy
[1:34:41] the prophecy of waxing worse is getting
[1:34:44] worse and worse
[1:34:45] fewer and fewer being saved and you hear
[1:34:48] the 1 this week I'll just say his name
[1:34:51] I do pray for these guys after I
[1:34:54] preached many times the Holy Spirit will
[1:34:55] convict me I'll go down to the altar and
[1:34:57] pray for these mega preachers cuz if I
[1:34:59] all said pray for all men I don't know
[1:35:01] whose cross to line it looks like
[1:35:02] they've crossed a line but I don't know
[1:35:03] maybe God can say but this week did you
[1:35:05] hear but Benny Hinn he come out in the
[1:35:07] heat he denounces prosperity gospel and
[1:35:09] said it's wrong he said it's wrong all
[1:35:11] these years for him to ask for a
[1:35:13] thousand dollar offering now the sad
[1:35:16] part is it's shallow because if it was
[1:35:18] real repentance that man will give back
[1:35:20] all those millions of dollars because
[1:35:23] that's what Zacchaeus did right when
[1:35:26] Jesus said Zacchaeus come to your house
[1:35:28] today he said Lord I repent and if I've
[1:35:30] done anything wrong I'll give him back
[1:35:32] four times the amount now let's watch if
[1:35:35] Benny Hinn gives back all those millions
[1:35:36] of dollars I doubt it very much
[1:35:41] did you see the dateline on him years
[1:35:43] ago ten years ago they went and followed
[1:35:46] him for a while they went to the hotels
[1:35:47] he would spend many nights in a row in a
[1:35:49] hotel that cost ten thousand dollars a
[1:35:51] night
[1:35:53] ten thousand dollars
[1:35:54] and poor dying people are descending him
[1:35:56] $1,000 and he's pleading with him send
[1:36:00] me a thousand 75 thousand and now I
[1:36:02] always said at the end of his life now
[1:36:04] he wants to say it's wrong but the Bible
[1:36:06] said there must be fruits of repentance
[1:36:09] it's not just lip service amen
[1:36:12] see these many of these rich men like to
[1:36:16] honor God with their lips but their
[1:36:17] hearts are far from him amen and if we
[1:36:21] say we're wrong church we gotta just
[1:36:23] more than say it our behavior and our
[1:36:25] our repentance has to prove that we're
[1:36:28] done with the sin we can't say I'm done
[1:36:31] with this I'm done with this sin and
[1:36:34] then let and then you know look at the
[1:36:36] app again like let's say it's a bad app
[1:36:38] you've got delete the app and you got to
[1:36:40] keep every other app away that's got
[1:36:43] anything bad on it praise God you got a
[1:36:45] show to God and show to everyone how
[1:36:47] sincere you are yet to bring forth
[1:36:49] fruits of repentance so let's see if
[1:36:52] this so-called man of God mega preacher
[1:36:55] brings forth any fruits of repentance
[1:37:00] because he says he doesn't want to get a
[1:37:02] rebuke when he gets to heaven for all
[1:37:04] that money well I don't know about that
[1:37:07] and we know God's merciful but listen if
[1:37:09] there's no fruits for it then it doesn't
[1:37:11] any do any good but RAM says there's
[1:37:12] such a thing as thorough repentance
[1:37:14] right thorough means doing everything
[1:37:17] right right they're going to the one you
[1:37:19] did wrong against and confessing it and
[1:37:20] making it right to them now look he has
[1:37:25] a he has influence he has a huge
[1:37:26] influence millions of people he's got a
[1:37:28] Daily Show unless they cancelled I don't
[1:37:29] know maybe he's getting unpopular maybe
[1:37:31] they want a a rich young guy now are you
[1:37:33] rich young woman or something like that
[1:37:34] I don't know but millions of people look
[1:37:36] who Satan is using these millions of
[1:37:38] people they only tell the blessings and
[1:37:40] church a lot of those promises aren't
[1:37:42] even for them they're for us because
[1:37:44] we're the bride amen those preachers are
[1:37:47] preaching promises to them that don't
[1:37:49] even belong to them they belong to us
[1:37:51] amen and here we are struggling just to
[1:37:53] try to hang on and hold on and they're
[1:37:55] receiving it you'll get little blessings
[1:37:57] but see the rain falls on the just and
[1:37:59] the unjust amen so we got to accept
[1:38:02] God's Word we got to be overcomers speak
[1:38:05] God's Word and watch it move Mountain
[1:38:07] amen hallelujah praise God
[1:38:12] thank the Lord see that wax is worse and
[1:38:18] worse Jesus said fewer will be saved my
[1:38:22] my my my well let me find a
[1:38:28] place place too close here here let's do
[1:38:31] this let me close with a different
[1:38:32] thought I would just wanna I had this
[1:38:34] thought come to me right at the right
[1:38:35] before service I want to look at the
[1:38:37] evidence of the Holy Ghost one more time
[1:38:40] all right bear with me there it is all
[1:38:42] right now years ago I preached this
[1:38:46] little message called the way of
[1:38:47] holiness whereby man talks about the way
[1:38:48] of holiness and I studied it out every
[1:38:51] time brother Branham said the evidence
[1:38:53] for the Holy Ghost all right he called
[1:38:56] it many different things but let me read
[1:39:00] the church age book this let me read the
[1:39:02] exact quotes from the church age book
[1:39:03] the evidence of the Holy Ghost so see
[1:39:08] the false church will raise up raise up
[1:39:10] keep growing greater and greater that
[1:39:12] means the true church is gonna get
[1:39:14] smaller and smaller and smaller right
[1:39:18] because yes is shorten the time that
[1:39:20] some flesh will be saved so in other
[1:39:24] words the fruits of the Holy Spirit or
[1:39:26] the people with the real evidence of the
[1:39:28] Holy Ghost will be fewer and far between
[1:39:32] praise God that means we'll have a lot
[1:39:35] of people not just for us a lot of us
[1:39:38] around message churches if they're
[1:39:41] really not born again then they're just
[1:39:43] putting on a show now that's if they're
[1:39:45] pretending now hopefully there aren't
[1:39:46] they're on their way through saint saint
[1:39:48] vacation genuinely right hopefully
[1:39:51] they're on the right road justification
[1:39:52] st. vacation but what we see a lot with
[1:39:54] all these people falling away with
[1:39:55] believe the sign everything what we see
[1:39:57] a lot as a lot of people impersonating
[1:39:59] the evidence of the Holy Ghost that
[1:40:01] really don't have it they really don't
[1:40:03] have it so let me read you 10 direct
[1:40:07] quotes from the church age book we know
[1:40:09] the evidence that the Holy Ghost is
[1:40:10] being led into all truth because that's
[1:40:13] John 16:13 when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:40:16] he'll guide you into all truth Jesus
[1:40:18] says that is the evidence praise God see
[1:40:23] because when you're child of God you can
[1:40:24] be taught by your father yeah my
[1:40:29] children if they don't obey me
[1:40:30] then they're disobedient children but if
[1:40:32] they obey met my wife and I then they're
[1:40:34] really our children right they have to
[1:40:37] obey the real children of God obey daddy
[1:40:41] hey though I'm quoting now those who
[1:40:44] could receive the word he who can
[1:40:46] believe the word that's actually broken
[1:40:48] sisters I'm sorry that's broken cisterns
[1:40:49] but the madam said they angel Lord had
[1:40:51] to straighten them out and show them
[1:40:52] that the evidence of a ghost is those
[1:40:54] who could receive the word
[1:40:55] he who can believe the word all right
[1:40:59] now church age book page 140 the Holy
[1:41:02] Ghost is evidence is one taught the word
[1:41:05] by the Holy Ghost page 140 again the
[1:41:11] group that can and does hear what the
[1:41:13] Spirit is saying and receives the
[1:41:16] revelation thereof amen and ever Jesus
[1:41:19] said if you've got the revelation then
[1:41:21] it prevails against the gates of Hell so
[1:41:24] this proves it's person who's born again
[1:41:26] their lives will prevail over the sin of
[1:41:30] all the sin right in their lives it will
[1:41:33] prevail because revelation overcomes the
[1:41:36] council's of Hell that's right page 141
[1:41:39] the evidence is hearing what the Spirit
[1:41:42] says page 143 the evidence is that we
[1:41:47] could have the teacher come and teach
[1:41:50] all truth we heard the word received it
[1:41:53] and live by it hey hey man Alleluia
[1:41:57] number six
[1:41:59] page 143 in every age the evidence was
[1:42:02] the same those who had the spirit the
[1:42:04] teacher heard the word and that spirit
[1:42:06] in them took the word and taught it
[1:42:08] revealed it to them and they were of the
[1:42:11] group that heard the messenger and his
[1:42:13] message and took and lived it see every
[1:42:17] time he quotes it it's saying the same
[1:42:18] thing the people that hear the word and
[1:42:21] live all the word number seven for the
[1:42:24] evidence is for the believer to receive
[1:42:26] the word for the age in which he lives
[1:42:28] that's page 155 number eight is page 157
[1:42:33] if you are true seed if you're truly
[1:42:35] baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:42:37] you will esteem his word above your
[1:42:39] necessary meat and yearn to live by
[1:42:43] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:42:45] mouth of God now many times for us that
[1:42:48] means fasting right testing
[1:42:52] this song that's that's my new joke
[1:42:57] right
[1:42:58] it means fasting we have to fast we have
[1:43:02] to esteem God's Word more important than
[1:43:04] a little meal than one trip to rallies
[1:43:08] now that used to be for me I don't do
[1:43:09] rallies anymore one trip to Olive Garden
[1:43:15] you have to steam the word above more
[1:43:18] the word more than our necessary meat
[1:43:21] praise God that's what it means for us
[1:43:23] we have to get closer to God by denying
[1:43:25] ourselves see we see it all the time
[1:43:28] people who overeat and I'm not
[1:43:30] criticizing anybody I'm not and at all
[1:43:32] but we see one of the lusts in America
[1:43:35] is gluttony and people stop fasting and
[1:43:39] so they don't consecrate to God and the
[1:43:42] Bible and Isaiah 58 tells many ways many
[1:43:45] blessings that come through fasting amen
[1:43:48] you know the Bible talks about prisoners
[1:43:50] being set free when we fast
[1:43:51] remember when we fasted for Christopher
[1:43:54] I called a fast for Jose's grandson
[1:43:56] Christopher that was years ago my we
[1:43:59] fast I think on two occasions he didn't
[1:44:01] get heal right away but he got healed in
[1:44:04] about three years after that
[1:44:05] hey man and Jose would come up here
[1:44:08] remember on Sunday he was crying because
[1:44:09] God answered his most recent prayer see
[1:44:12] we got it fast we have to seek and
[1:44:14] that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[1:44:16] someone who's in the word fast things
[1:44:18] the part of the word prayers a part of
[1:44:20] the word giving alms is part of the word
[1:44:22] gifts are part of the word so if we're
[1:44:24] the bride we want all the word day man
[1:44:27] and you can't be the bride unless you
[1:44:30] have all the word that's why we need to
[1:44:32] live all the word page 169 he said the
[1:44:37] evidence is just the same as it was back
[1:44:39] in the day of our Lord and that
[1:44:41] comforting to know that meanness is the
[1:44:43] same in Jesus day as it is today it is
[1:44:46] receiving the word of truth for the day
[1:44:47] in which you live jesus never did stress
[1:44:50] the importance of the works as he did
[1:44:51] the word and that beautiful see after a
[1:44:54] while Jesus started preaching doctrine
[1:44:55] right the first fall miracles second
[1:44:57] pole he started prophesying against them
[1:44:59] and then his great big campaigns were
[1:45:03] dispersed
[1:45:04] right because he started saying you got
[1:45:07] to eat the flesh you eat my flesh and
[1:45:09] drink my blood he never explained it see
[1:45:12] he started emphasizing the word above
[1:45:14] miracles and that's when you started
[1:45:16] seeing the separation right that's when
[1:45:19] we saw the separation brother Branham in
[1:45:21] those days he started bringing the
[1:45:22] message serpent seed and holiness
[1:45:24] marriage and divorce water baptism the
[1:45:26] real Holy Ghost evidence and that's when
[1:45:28] you started seeing a great separation no
[1:45:30] more invitations lot less invitations it
[1:45:36] is receiving the word of truth for the
[1:45:38] day in which you live Jesus okay already
[1:45:40] read that he knew that if the people got
[1:45:41] the word the works would follow that is
[1:45:44] the Bible see because these signs follow
[1:45:47] them that believe if you're a believer
[1:45:49] these signs will follow you praise God
[1:45:52] now one encourage you I it's my
[1:45:54] testimony I believe I got the Holy Ghost
[1:45:56] in 2003 but I didn't start seeing a lot
[1:45:58] of miracles till 2010 I don't know if
[1:46:00] that's true for you brother West or not
[1:46:01] I I wish I would have seen him right
[1:46:03] away but for some reason it seemed like
[1:46:04] God just held him off and I was just
[1:46:06] learning the message and preaching I
[1:46:07] mean I was still pastor and everything
[1:46:09] like that but around 2010 I started
[1:46:11] seeing miracle after miracle after
[1:46:13] miracle after miracle so I know there's
[1:46:15] times and seasons with God praise the
[1:46:18] Lord there's times and seasons but if
[1:46:20] you're a believer these signs will
[1:46:22] follow you praise God
[1:46:25] put the word first always obey the word
[1:46:28] put the revelations of the message first
[1:46:30] because the message is the Bible every
[1:46:32] word brother Branham said it's the Bible
[1:46:33] the message is the Bible and the church
[1:46:35] said message does not brother Branham he
[1:46:38] preached the message cuz he preached the
[1:46:39] Bible praise God but that's the spirit
[1:46:42] we got a battle of the day that old
[1:46:43] Antichrist worship and brother Branham
[1:46:44] spirit my goodness verse i'm sorry/not
[1:46:48] verse quote number 10 page 273 in the
[1:46:51] church age but let's say in our feet a
[1:46:53] person that is truly baptized by the
[1:46:56] Holy Ghost into the body of Christ
[1:46:59] receiving the fullness of the Spirit
[1:47:01] will be in the word all the way
[1:47:05] now tell me how somebody going to be in
[1:47:08] the word all the way when they don't
[1:47:09] come to church all the time and the
[1:47:11] church said see that's the evidence
[1:47:14] you're in the word all the way see many
[1:47:18] message people they just preach they
[1:47:20] just go around the same thing God sent a
[1:47:21] prophet seals serpents eat around around
[1:47:24] instead of going to the rest of the word
[1:47:26] it's good we got to know those things
[1:47:28] how many thank God for those things
[1:47:30] every day I thank God for the word of
[1:47:31] God this message has changed my life but
[1:47:34] see the Holy Ghost wants us to go deeper
[1:47:36] into the Word of God because every
[1:47:39] mystery the moms of the mystery of God
[1:47:40] must be finished and that means going
[1:47:43] down in the mystery of God's will for
[1:47:45] your life right the mystery of God's
[1:47:47] will for my life going down to these
[1:47:49] mysteries that deal with us individually
[1:47:51] right and seeing where we stand with God
[1:47:54] because we know we've got to stand
[1:47:56] before Jesus and Jesus gonna say what
[1:47:58] did you do with the talents I gave you
[1:47:59] right what did you do with the poem that
[1:48:01] I gave you and we want to be faithful
[1:48:04] servants praise God and I hope that
[1:48:07] helps Malachi won't you come to the
[1:48:08] piano here does that help by God's grace
[1:48:10] see that fall Church I believe that
[1:48:12] parable no that's I could be wrong but I
[1:48:14] believe that that falls parable or that
[1:48:16] parable rather is about the false church
[1:48:18] because she grows up real great but at
[1:48:20] the end time the church is so small so
[1:48:23] small but this false church grows up so
[1:48:27] big in all the bird's nest on that and
[1:48:31] it's their habitation but what's the
[1:48:33] evidence of the true church she's in the
[1:48:35] word all the way she loves all the Word
[1:48:39] of God I mean of the Word of God tonight
[1:48:41] of course she did you come out on a
[1:48:43] Wednesday night some of you drove an
[1:48:44] hour somebody drove longer my goodness
[1:48:48] so we got a long drive home but the
[1:48:52] reality of it is you drive you drive
[1:48:54] anywhere we're for the Living Word of
[1:48:56] God because why you esteem it more than
[1:48:59] your necessary meat you could've went
[1:49:01] out to Applebee's tonight you could have
[1:49:04] went out to McDonald's and got some well
[1:49:05] I don't know if that's true meat or not
[1:49:07] it's probably you know GMO meat but you
[1:49:10] understand some of you like I didn't eat
[1:49:12] supper tonight I'm not bragging or they
[1:49:14] like that I'm just saying I have seen
[1:49:15] this word above my necessary meat but
[1:49:18] that's like brother Brahim said before
[1:49:19] meetings he would fast on a Friday you
[1:49:21] know breach to Saturday Sunday I try to
[1:49:23] model my life after the servant of God
[1:49:25] see if we want more of God we've got it
[1:49:28] the Word of God has to be higher
[1:49:30] esteemed in our lives
[1:49:32] we don't want to become placing right we
[1:49:34] don't become complacent we don't make
[1:49:35] I'm slothful we don't be soft
[1:49:37] we want to be faithful we want a hunger
[1:49:40] and thirst after righteousness let me
[1:49:43] stop right there you love the Lord
[1:49:44] tonight
[1:49:45] praise God let's just bow our heads for
[1:49:47] a word of Prayer I just felt led to kind
[1:49:50] of finish on that evidences and church
[1:49:53] Ollis let me read a few more with your
[1:49:55] heads bowed brother Ram said the
[1:49:56] evidence is sighing and crying for the
[1:49:58] abominations my we do that often here
[1:49:59] don't we the Holy Spirit will come upon
[1:50:02] me brother William and I'll just weep
[1:50:03] for the sins and a crew to drive nasties
[1:50:07] abortion clinics and these sports bars
[1:50:11] where they worship the Browns and they
[1:50:13] worship LeBron James I just got a holy
[1:50:16] seal for the Lord they know about this
[1:50:18] should be worshiping their Creator the
[1:50:20] one who's giving them breath Jesus so
[1:50:27] that's evidence I did cried he said the
[1:50:29] fruits of the spirit are an evidence
[1:50:30] will they they are because they're part
[1:50:31] of the word he said the Holy life is the
[1:50:34] evidence he said this is a desire to
[1:50:36] save souls of evidence that is it's part
[1:50:38] of the word he said when you're a dude
[1:50:40] with power numerical sense on that side
[1:50:42] and it is it's part of the word he said
[1:50:45] to my love is evidence he said believe
[1:50:49] for the truth is the evidence that's
[1:50:52] what the Holy Spirit brings believe the
[1:50:54] truth see Church everything in the word
[1:50:57] is part of the one evidence in other
[1:51:00] words all the word is revealed for our a
[1:51:02] Holy Ghost help we have to sign we have
[1:51:07] to pray too fast
[1:51:09] give up meals that they give money to
[1:51:11] the missionaries or money we gotta be
[1:51:13] faithful we got to be fully invested in
[1:51:16] all
[1:51:18] and that's been my heart since 2001 when
[1:51:20] I heard this message and I trust by
[1:51:22] God's grace it will always be my oyster
[1:51:29] [Music]
[1:51:34] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[1:51:37] word we thank you for this word or God

[1:51:56] in this case and I've ever seen them the
[1:51:59] false church and when we ended with the
[1:52:02] true church evidence all the grace of
[1:52:33] God
[1:52:36] I destroyed we don't want to be going
[1:52:43] around in circles like Israel you want
[1:52:50] to go deeper the promised land
