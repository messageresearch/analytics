[29:44] make sure I didn't miss anything all
[29:45] right
[29:45] so we look forward to the Word of God
[29:47] here and trying to think about any other
[29:51] announcements just May 31st we have the
[29:53] Hawkins coming I'm sorry March 31st
[29:55] I wrote May on here that's why I get
[29:57] keep messin Etta and the books available
[29:59] so sister Naomi you don't have to read
[30:01] it but if you want a copy I'm not gonna
[30:02] force you you don't brother Aaron said
[30:04] he's studying for a test next week so
[30:07] I'm a teacher I like to give tests so
[30:09] he's gonna study for a test next week
[30:11] nah but if you want one you're more
[30:14] welcome to have one and you can ask your
[30:16] dad if he wants to meet a male 1 I'll
[30:17] mail in one you know maybe look I said
[30:19] to put in some OMA glory well we could
[30:23] thank the Lord for that amen glory
[30:26] hallelujah well he can't wait on male 1
[30:30] so we're thankful by God's grace for
[30:34] that trying to think it seemed like
[30:35] there was something else someone to
[30:36] share well I think
[30:42] that's it all right so let's look at
[30:45] this here tonight and seem like I'm
[30:47] forgetting some you could get inside
[30:48] switch over I got some some some quotes
[30:50] we like to read and look at tonight by
[30:53] the grace of the Lord so let's look at
[30:56] part 12 of the purpose series we look at
[30:58] time and seasons again and then we read
[31:00] our text but on it sums I did the cleese
[31:04] e Asti suffer out to change that it's
[31:06] like I said I'm at 137 and 150 I'm
[31:08] almost done but I think Lord willing
[31:10] tonight I'd like to get to the five
[31:13] musts that brother branham taught about
[31:16] the will of God and at the right time
[31:17] and season so I think we're try to get
[31:19] to that if we don't pass it we may pass
[31:21] it we'll see how the Holy Spirit directs
[31:23] us here tonight so brother man talked
[31:27] about how meetings like the chief church
[31:29] gatherings were in the right season so
[31:32] he said this meeting is not
[31:33] providentially it is God's provided way
[31:36] for us it's just in the right season the
[31:39] right time you never come here this
[31:41] afternoon just by chance it was God that
[31:43] brought you here
[31:44] everything is moving just right now
[31:47] whether you want to listen or whether
[31:48] you want to believe that'll be up to you
[31:51] see but at the judgment bar then God
[31:54] will say so if someone doesn't believe
[31:55] God will say the judgment bar
[31:57] you remember that sermon remember I
[32:00] guided you to the church that night
[32:02] uh-huh
[32:03] then what can you say so we want to
[32:06] apply that to tonight that God wants to
[32:07] speak to us tonight praise God so that
[32:09] the judgment bar God said aren't you
[32:11] glad you listened on that Wednesday
[32:12] night that's what I want to say praise
[32:15] God I thank the Lord that I was able to
[32:18] hear your word and you're able to speak
[32:19] and and quicken something to my heart
[32:22] tonight that I really needed amen so uh
[32:25] well they also said their seasons of
[32:27] Prayer now brother man was you know it
[32:30] was so was so simple he called he called
[32:34] a season of Prayer if you just stay if
[32:37] you and I just after service for a few
[32:38] minutes and pray that's what he called
[32:39] us season of Prayer just something so
[32:42] simple so you'll see it in the quote
[32:44] here he says this is 1960 now with our
[32:47] heads bowed your hearts open just give
[32:49] yourself a season of Prayer sometimes we
[32:52] think well I got to pray for three hours
[32:54] well it's not always that way
[32:56] but most of us probably don't do that I
[32:57] haven't done that for a long time he
[33:00] said just before I guess the baptismal
[33:02] service coming so so look at this he
[33:05] called the time from the end of a sermon
[33:07] to the time they have a baptismal
[33:08] service he called that a season of
[33:10] Prayer aren't you glad for that amen
[33:14] see there'll be another service tonight
[33:16] and I remember don't let this
[33:17] opportunity pass I've been here now for
[33:19] two and half hours or more trying to
[33:21] just take my time and bringing the
[33:22] gospel lay it just imperfectly then we
[33:24] come right down to the end so little
[33:27] season a prayer from the time the sermon
[33:30] ends to the time they baptize he says it
[33:34] again and the very text here recognized
[33:37] Acts II don't let it pass over your head
[33:38] you've heard it you recognize it as
[33:41] presence is here you know it's him
[33:42] that's calling you then act upon it god
[33:45] be with you
[33:46] have a season of Prayer amen I would
[33:50] like to do that sometimes I just like to
[33:52] have my doctor or before service but you
[33:54] can have it after service it doesn't
[33:56] matter wherever God's leading you into a
[33:58] season a prayer just enjoy that 15 or 20
[34:01] minutes or however long you feel lead we
[34:03] should be open to that brother band had
[34:05] to encourage them have a season of
[34:07] Prayer just take a little time and just
[34:10] talk to God talk it over right we know
[34:12] just a little talk with Jesus makes it
[34:14] right we know all the jokes that you
[34:16] know God you God God will never be busy
[34:18] when you call it heaven you'll never get
[34:20] the busy signal never have to leave a
[34:22] voicemail alright
[34:23] we know those jokes and the technology
[34:25] jokes but it's a reality God wants to
[34:28] hear from us and I just thought it was
[34:30] so special that the Prophet made it so
[34:32] simple that it's not hard to have a
[34:34] season of Prayer it's actually very
[34:35] simple it's just a little sacrifice of
[34:38] our time now also Church don't be
[34:42] discouraged - if you feel like you need
[34:44] to take a vacation sometime and maybe go
[34:47] out in the wilderness and pray pray or
[34:50] you know I know I know vacations are
[34:53] expensive most of time right so it's
[34:55] hard to do occasionally and it's hard to
[34:59] get time off but bro Graham talked about
[35:01] how it was important for him to have
[35:03] vacation time he said now I got to go
[35:06] back to Arizona I got to go back Monday
[35:08] a week to go back to
[35:10] son to get the children there for school
[35:11] and I'm coming back then after that the
[35:14] wife has to be there early to register
[35:16] the children so we were talking about
[35:18] that's just to know me where we how they
[35:20] do there's a certain time there to
[35:21] register the children two weeks before
[35:24] school starts so that was back in that
[35:26] day and then I'm going to return back
[35:29] for a while here and now this is my
[35:33] vacation time as you know I preach since
[35:36] December January February March April
[35:39] May June July so that's quite a few
[35:41] months three four five six seven eight
[35:42] months in a row now if God be willing
[35:44] and not any special call this is the
[35:47] season I like to take my rest my
[35:49] vacation I go hunting amen
[35:53] so Jill or August was brother Rams time
[35:56] to take a little vacation huh me no it's
[35:59] alright to take a vacation
[36:00] is it alright they might say Amen on
[36:03] that
[36:04] wait it's not okay somebody better let
[36:07] me know because I like to have fun my
[36:12] wife and I get a little way you know
[36:13] once in a while you know we got we're
[36:14] way I think in what October and then in
[36:16] February for just a weekend two days
[36:18] away but even the prophet of God had to
[36:24] schedule a little vacation and he called
[36:29] his season so you could have a little
[36:30] season of prayer for a few minutes you
[36:32] can have a season of vacation a certain
[36:35] month well that's the month I like to
[36:36] get a little vacation now let's get a
[36:41] little more serious things now that's
[36:42] just a nice little kind of soft little
[36:45] light little subject there but now we
[36:48] get in the season for revelation program
[36:52] said God reveals his word only in its
[36:55] season Martin Luther had the same Bible
[36:58] we did Wesley read the same Bible Martin
[37:01] Luther did Pentecostals were the same
[37:03] Bible read it we did Jesus were the same
[37:05] Bible if the Pharisees read but they
[37:07] they're trying to keep the corn in the
[37:09] early stage when it was ripening they
[37:11] failed to see their hour now david has
[37:15] done the same thing here or what a
[37:19] blessing church that you and I could
[37:20] open the Bible and we can read you know
[37:23] Malik
[37:23] four five and six revelation ten seven
[37:26] and we can see what that actually means
[37:28] for today praise God hey you know they
[37:31] couldn't see it a couple hundred years
[37:33] ago but we can see it because it's the
[37:36] season that we're living in praise God
[37:38] beautiful God only does it in a season
[37:41] God chooses this word this season I'm
[37:44] sorry reveals awareness season to whom
[37:46] he chooses to reveal it to God chooses
[37:49] who he reveals it to he chose that
[37:50] before the foundation of the world all
[37:52] of his doings were for known by him
[37:54] hidden from man he just reveals him as
[37:56] he wills his chosen season his chosen
[37:58] person and he never did choose a party
[38:00] or sect
[38:01] it's a chosen person how he does it
[38:05] praise God so he didn't choose a
[38:08] denomination he never chose a certain
[38:10] group he chosen individual to reveal his
[38:13] word to praise God who is it that will
[38:17] dare to correct him and say now Lord you
[38:20] made a mistake by putting this man in
[38:22] the ministry this man doesn't believe
[38:25] like we believe so think of all the
[38:28] Pentecostals that didn't agree with
[38:29] brother Branham who is gonna tell God
[38:32] he's wrong in it it would take some
[38:34] money that's a little more delinquent
[38:36] than I am to tell him that he knows what
[38:39] he is doing he knows who to choose and
[38:41] who not to choose what to do and when to
[38:43] do it no matter how much we think that a
[38:45] certain person is qualified to do a
[38:47] certain job God knows who's qualified
[38:50] for the time and season or the time and
[38:52] the right time to do it
[38:54] praise God now is this thing Billy
[38:58] Graham a few weeks ago I just had to you
[39:00] know he just kind of came up on my
[39:01] YouTube and I listened to him and I
[39:02] thought my what a tremendous voice he
[39:04] had why he was just a powerful speaker
[39:09] and no doubt that's the reason people
[39:12] flocked to him and brother Branham said
[39:14] he had justification down to a tee
[39:16] nobody can preach salvation like Billy
[39:19] Graham and who's gonna tell god that he
[39:22] was wrong for Billy Graham to preach
[39:25] salvation right nobody you'd be a
[39:27] delinquent to say God should have gave
[39:30] it to somebody else
[39:31] no God gave it to the right man praise
[39:33] God but we should be able to say the
[39:36] same thing when we listen to brother
[39:38] that God gave him the message of the
[39:40] rapture praise God and nobody can preach
[39:43] it like him hey amen hallelujah nobody
[39:47] could take his place and you'll be a
[39:50] delinquent to say that it should be for
[39:52] somebody else other than who yeah you'd
[39:57] be a far more delinquent man than me to
[39:59] say that it wasn't brother man's message
[40:01] to get a bride ready for Christ amen and
[40:06] the true real Christian the real
[40:08] believer in God waits upon the Lord for
[40:11] these things wait on your ministry if
[40:12] you feel a call be sure that it's God be
[40:16] sure that's right be sure it's a timely
[40:19] of what you're saying the Bible said
[40:21] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[40:23] their strength they shall mount up upon
[40:25] the wings like an eagle they shall run
[40:27] and not be weary if they walk they'll
[40:29] not faint
[40:31] notice David king of Israel just
[40:34] anointed Samuel poured the oil upon him
[40:37] and he was chosen of God to be king of
[40:39] Israel and David got this revelation to
[40:42] bring the Ark of the Lord up to the City
[40:44] of David now there's nothing wrong but
[40:47] you see David went at it wrong there was
[40:50] nothing wrong with with God with God
[40:53] putting it on David's heart of course
[40:55] David had the right I desired to bring
[40:57] that Ark but he went about it the wrong
[41:00] way
[41:01] now I copied and pasted a few slides
[41:04] from about two years ago when I preached
[41:07] a little bit on this I just want to
[41:08] review this I thought it'd be good
[41:10] because I forgot the five months so if I
[41:12] thought I forgot it well we all probably
[41:14] forgot it right so there's five months
[41:17] if we want to do the will of God but man
[41:20] said it must be his time and season it
[41:22] must line up with his word it must be
[41:25] his person to do it and then it must
[41:27] come through his prophet and then it
[41:29] must be his vindicated prophet but
[41:31] remember those are the five mus to doing
[41:35] the will of God now he says now
[41:38] I'm just going to skip these because
[41:40] these just kind of tell what I already
[41:42] said first is time season no it must be
[41:46] word ok program profit and they says
[41:51] there's your five must then it must be a
[41:52] vindicated profit ok
[41:54] so David miss on three of the five three
[41:58] of the five so you didn't even get him
[42:01] right right now he said they'd already
[42:05] done one thing wrong two things wrong
[42:07] and then he goes down there three things
[42:10] wrong so David got the time and season
[42:14] right that was the right time in season
[42:16] but he didn't consult the word David was
[42:21] the right person to do it but he didn't
[42:23] go to the profit nor did he go to the
[42:26] vindicated profit praise God
[42:29] now let's just apply that to our lives
[42:32] for a little bit here first for whatever
[42:35] we feel caught of God to do is it the
[42:39] right time and season does it line up
[42:41] with the word am I the person to do it
[42:44] and did it come through his prophet and
[42:48] now what I mean by this is that you
[42:51] could have a prophecy from someone who
[42:52] has the gift of prophecy but then that
[42:55] prophecy must line up with God's
[42:57] vindicated prophet for this day brother
[42:58] Branham right because we know a couple
[43:02] people that had prophecies over them
[43:03] team Meyers and different ones brother
[43:05] kam had a prophecy over him
[43:06] but but no matter what a minor prophet
[43:10] is said it's got to line up with the
[43:12] major prophet
[43:13] praise God and so so David he had the
[43:17] right time he missed the waiter because
[43:21] he put it on the cart rather than the
[43:24] shoulders was that right so he had to be
[43:29] packed up on the shoulder of the Levites
[43:33] he was the right person because he
[43:35] caught the revelation but the problem
[43:39] was he did not consult a single prophet
[43:42] he went to men that were not prophets
[43:45] right and then he didn't go to the
[43:48] prophet of the which was Nathan because
[43:51] he was them
[43:52] major profit of the hour amen praise the
[43:57] Lord so what if David a man after God's
[44:02] own heart right if he missed on three or
[44:06] five and he was a man after God's own
[44:08] heart how careful she knew and I be
[44:11] before we do something now remember
[44:16] church God said if you seek my face with
[44:20] all your heart you'll find me
[44:22] so that's Jeremiah 29 how many four
[44:25] member that if you seek me a find me
[44:27] I'll seek me with all your heart right
[44:28] so apparently David must have not saw it
[44:31] with everything right because he didn't
[44:33] consult the word he didn't consult any
[44:36] local prophet and he didn't in fact salt
[44:39] consulted the major prophet so if we're
[44:42] gonna do something if we're going to
[44:44] make a choice a major decision our lives
[44:46] it behooves us to seek God with all we
[44:49] have and what I mean by that is you
[44:52] might have to take a Saturday morning
[44:54] offer whatever your day off is maybe
[44:56] it's Wednesday I don't know if maybe
[44:59] it's Monday whatever your day and you
[45:02] might have to just devote a day or a
[45:04] morning or evening or a couple let's say
[45:07] you can just do a morning well devote
[45:08] that morning all month so that's
[45:10] Saturday do all four salaries in a row
[45:12] but make sure you can say at the end of
[45:14] that that you've saw God with all your
[45:16] heart because if not you're gonna miss
[45:20] on the plan of God praise the Lord
[45:24] that's why I'm so thankful before we
[45:25] started this church we fasted and prayed
[45:27] before we started cams church because
[45:30] cam was coming here Simon
[45:31] before we did that we fasted and prayed
[45:33] the whole day over at that one church
[45:35] over there I forget near Jose's old
[45:37] place well low drive motor drive and we
[45:41] had a day of fasting and praying and God
[45:43] so hazm indicated that God gave the
[45:46] miracles and signs and wonders and God
[45:48] still doing great things at brother cams
[45:49] church because we fasted and prayed for
[45:52] the right time and season and all this
[45:54] was lined up you know I think I think
[45:58] cam or I'm sorry brother Brooks and I
[46:00] ordained cam a prophet or saw a pastor
[46:02] so I
[46:03] but that all lines up with programs
[46:05] message it all lines up everything was
[46:08] lined up with the word so I believe in
[46:10] this how many believe in this so many
[46:13] times decisions are made and you may
[46:16] have waited a certain time or season may
[46:19] we maybe we have but have we really saw
[46:21] God with all of our hearts and as you
[46:26] know what David you're gonna save a lot
[46:28] of pain if you do it the right way it
[46:32] always makes sense to do it the right
[46:34] way wait a little bit on the Lord don't
[46:36] push anything to force them to get done
[46:38] just wait upon the Lord for it to get
[46:40] done so just a little admonition tonight
[46:45] can I just say like that
[46:46] does anybody have any major decisions
[46:48] coming up for the next year month or
[46:50] anything like that
[46:51] anybody no okay well maybe you will but
[46:57] before you do that may the Holy Spirit
[47:00] bring this back to your remembrance that
[47:03] we must seek God with all of our hearts
[47:05] and these five conditions must be met
[47:10] they must be met if not something awful
[47:14] can happen now the beautiful thing is it
[47:17] just took three months and it was all
[47:19] made right again amen
[47:21] everything that went wrong was made
[47:23] right again amen that shows us how
[47:27] merciful how loving how sweet how
[47:30] faithful how patient our long-suffering
[47:32] our Lord is amen so let that be an
[47:37] encouragement to us church that we want
[47:40] to get all five out of five how many
[47:42] want to pass that test now that's a real
[47:43] word test right there Amen I don't want
[47:46] to get a what is that 40% I don't want
[47:49] to get a 40% on my god test I want to
[47:53] get a hundred percent Amen I want to
[47:55] pass it exactly right amen so look what
[48:02] he says
[48:03] getting into his ministry I love this
[48:04] quote here and I wonder today if all of
[48:06] our drawing in and great Crusades and
[48:08] revivals we haven't been filling up the
[48:11] Methodists octa Baptists Ark the
[48:12] Presbyterian Ark and what about the Ark
[48:14] of Christ the word and if the bride is
[48:17] to be the word then she's got to be of
[48:19] Christ
[48:20] part the bridegroom she's got to be the
[48:22] word the word not for his day the word
[48:26] for this day that he promised would be
[48:28] this day that he sent his word for it to
[48:30] mold his bride and make her hope we see
[48:32] it don't get some idea of your own now
[48:35] and don't take somebody else's idea take
[48:37] the vindicated word here of the Bible it
[48:40] says God has promised in his word up you
[48:43] would choose his bride in the last day
[48:44] did you know that he promised it how he
[48:47] would do it and that by his original
[48:49] plan of choosing Christ or choosing the
[48:51] times choosing the seasons he can't miss
[48:54] it on his bride because she's part of
[48:55] that word he can't choose it by
[48:57] denomination thank God amen
[49:00] that gets us a lot closer amen
[49:03] Alleluia - being in the perfect will of
[49:06] God he when he didn't choose Christ by
[49:09] denomination did he did Christ come the
[49:12] denomination did he come denomination no
[49:14] they rejected him well that's what the
[49:16] denomination done then then when he
[49:18] chooses a bride can he come any other
[49:21] way
[49:21] Oh huh how did he bring Christ Church by
[49:25] the word of the prophets is that right
[49:27] how do we bring the what brought here by
[49:30] the word of the prophets how do you
[49:33] identify when he came by a man with the
[49:35] spirit of Elijah partum come out of the
[49:37] wilderness how we identify his bride he
[49:40] promised in Malachi 4 the same thing
[49:42] before destroyed the earth like it was
[49:45] in the days of Sodom amen thank you nor
[49:49] how does he choose the bride
[49:51] he said Elijah restores all things
[49:53] Matthew 17 11 and Elijah is sent to you
[49:57] in Malachi four five and six
[49:59] the brother Branham was sent to us right
[50:01] and when he sent to us and we hear what
[50:04] he says it restores the Bible so you and
[50:07] I see the Bible as a living book and
[50:10] it's living today right now amen
[50:12] it restores the Preds of Jesus Christ
[50:16] that
[50:16] doctrine of Jesus Christ the person of
[50:18] Jesus Christ it restores the the Word of
[50:21] God Jesus Christ it restores all of
[50:24] Jesus to us amen
[50:27] and that's all by the prophets Malachi
[50:30] Isaiah all the prophets Moses all the
[50:33] prophets spoke of him and that's what
[50:35] we're living in the day when all this is
[50:37] fulfilled how they do yeah it's the
[50:39] right diamond season now this is
[50:42] something other a men and I were talking
[50:43] about a few weeks ago and I didn't mean
[50:45] to I wasn't planning on preaching it but
[50:48] when I came across the in the quotes I
[50:49] thought well this will be helpful to go
[50:51] over again for the church there was a
[50:53] season of revelation for brother Branham
[50:55] with mark 11:23 if you're having your
[50:58] Bibles well you don't have to all go
[50:59] right to it
[51:00] and Jesus answering said unto them have
[51:03] faith in God for verily I say unto you
[51:05] that whosoever shall say this mountain
[51:07] be thou removed and be thou cast in the
[51:09] sea and shall not doubt in his heart but
[51:11] shall believe that those things which he
[51:13] says shall come to pass he shall have
[51:15] whatsoever he saith therefore I say to
[51:18] you what things soever ye desire when
[51:20] you pray believe that you receive them
[51:22] and ye shall have them now brother
[51:28] Branham struggled over this for not
[51:30] months not weeks
[51:32] this scripture struggled him for years
[51:37] he said oh if we could weigh those words
[51:39] you can have what you say not what I say
[51:42] but what you've said you can have what
[51:44] you said for years I lingered over that
[51:46] I went to every one they said if I can't
[51:49] rightly divide it it's still the true so
[51:51] we searched every dot dictionary and dot
[51:54] lexicon so I believe sometimes it God
[51:57] just lets us see things when it's time
[51:59] for us to see things aren't you glad
[52:01] Church that's encouraging you and I will
[52:04] see the body change when it's time for
[52:06] the body change hey we might not see it
[52:09] right now how it's even possible how can
[52:12] our bodies be swallowed up by a
[52:14] supernatural Holy Ghost power
[52:16] overflowing us how could that happen we
[52:18] may not see it now but if we're alive
[52:21] and remain and wait for that we're a
[52:22] part of the rapture
[52:23] we'll see it at the time when we're
[52:26] supposed to see it glory
[52:30] he withholds these blessings like the
[52:35] blessings that were enjoying today our
[52:37] forefathers did not enjoy those it
[52:39] wasn't season for them they couldn't
[52:43] enjoy the seven seals like weekend
[52:45] they couldn't enjoy the seven churches
[52:47] like we can amen hallelujah they can
[52:51] enjoy the blessings of marriage and
[52:53] divorce like weekend or the baptism only
[52:56] ghosts like we can they can't enjoy
[52:58] these things it was withholding from
[53:00] them and now church they got there's
[53:03] just a few things withholding from us
[53:05] that are withholding before the rapture
[53:07] there's very few things that still not
[53:10] been revealed but we're the ones by
[53:12] God's grace that may live to see them
[53:15] hallelujah oh my what is it it's just
[53:20] another blessing
[53:21] what is the rapturing faith it's just
[53:24] another blessing
[53:25] just like your blessing for divine
[53:27] healing just like your blessing for
[53:29] justification blessing for
[53:30] sanctification blessing for all these
[53:32] blessings of God so is the lobstering
[53:34] faith just another blessing from God
[53:36] Almighty just another blessing amen
[53:41] thank God for the blessings now here's
[53:47] where he struggled now let's skip down
[53:49] he said I could never preach on him
[53:51] because of this he said now I could not
[53:53] justify that because I could not
[53:55] understand that how then could it be
[53:57] that I would say something as a man what
[54:00] if I said something that wasn't
[54:01] according to his word and asked
[54:05] something was in the corners word that
[54:06] it would have to come to pass so this is
[54:08] our brother Brandon with this he always
[54:11] notice how it said if you say to the
[54:14] mountain be thou removed and brother
[54:17] have said well what if I said something
[54:18] that God didn't want me to say how many
[54:22] couldn't understand that this rugged him
[54:25] because Jesus said if you say to the
[54:27] mountain it'll happen
[54:29] and here's the problem Adam had see to
[54:32] me that took away from the atonement and
[54:36] put it on a person he said I could not
[54:40] understand it so
[54:42] Jesus said if you'd speak to the
[54:43] mountain it'll move and brother boys
[54:46] thought well is that me or God speaking
[54:49] then how can I just speak it and then it
[54:52] looks like it looks like I have all the
[54:54] power and not the power of the atonement
[54:57] praise God and isn't that a way or the
[55:02] way a lot of people preach it in
[55:03] denominations and in the message you'll
[55:07] hear you'll hear people say it all the
[55:08] time we've heard it you've heard it
[55:10] before
[55:10] oh just speak the word come on brother
[55:12] just speak the word but if God's not
[55:14] leading you to speak that word it's not
[55:17] gonna happen so always keep that in mind
[55:22] and I think we have a pretty mature
[55:24] church right I believe so
[55:26] by God's grace why do I say you're
[55:28] mature because you can handle deep
[55:30] preaching you can handle the meat of the
[55:32] preaching praise God that's right but
[55:38] see brother may have a struggle with
[55:39] this well if I say it then the it's me
[55:42] doing it and not God so brother may have
[55:46] learned though that Christians only
[55:48] speak the will of God according to the
[55:52] atonement in other words according to
[55:54] the will of God brother Branham use
[55:58] examples in this sermon speak to the
[56:00] mountain 19:59 of speaking squirrels and
[56:04] giving the fish back its life and so in
[56:08] each case it wasn't brother branham's
[56:10] thought to do it God through the
[56:13] atonement gave him grace to do that and
[56:17] that's what he says at the end of this
[56:19] service he clears closing words of the
[56:21] sermon all right listening this good old
[56:23] hymn my faith looks up to thee that's
[56:25] where we stand that's the only thing
[56:27] that a moving bone that's when God has
[56:30] to anoint you to such a faith that it
[56:33] cannot fail amen
[56:35] hallelujah Church listen there's no
[56:39] pressure don't feel pressured to speak
[56:41] to the mountain because it's not up to
[56:44] you to speak to the mountain it's up to
[56:46] God to speak to the mountain and if God
[56:49] wants you to speak to the mountain
[56:50] you'll feel such an anointing to speak
[56:53] that that's all you can do you
[56:55] cry you'll speak amen just like Moses
[56:59] you won't be crying about it well this
[57:01] problem on this awful problem when it's
[57:04] God's time to move that mountain he'll
[57:06] so poor spirit upon you
[57:08] you'll be like David your cup will run
[57:10] over you and then you can't help but
[57:13] speak because your cup is just flowing
[57:15] over with anointing afternoon tea with
[57:19] power at their power with inspiration
[57:22] abroad inspiration you'll speak to that
[57:24] problem you'll speak to that mountain
[57:26] and that mountain has to move me and
[57:29] that would happen on Sunday for those
[57:32] that you told me God supernaturally for
[57:34] Jose told me write down her service God
[57:35] and healed him as a miracle on Sunday
[57:37] and he told me with tears in his eyes
[57:40] what was it it wasn't any of us we just
[57:43] got under such an anointing that we
[57:45] spoke to them out and spoke to the
[57:47] headache whatever the trouble was we
[57:49] spoke to that and it had to move because
[57:51] it wasn't our anointing it wasn't
[57:53] because of us it was because of the
[57:55] atonement but blood of Jesus Christ amen
[57:59] Mary it wasn't us but see when we get
[58:06] into that anointing there was no fear
[58:07] for me to pray for Jose because it
[58:09] wasn't my anointing that was going to do
[58:11] it I don't have any power to do it it's
[58:13] God's anointing to do it
[58:15] let me understand that so ever have
[58:17] struggled for years how can it be me
[58:21] speaking to the mountain I thought God
[58:23] has to speak to the mountain do I need
[58:26] the atonement or not so he just preached
[58:28] on it what a wise prophet that is and
[58:31] church the same thing should apply to
[58:34] you if you're scared to speak to the
[58:36] mountain don't speak to it don't speak
[58:39] to it but when you so get in God's
[58:42] presence through prayer through worship
[58:44] through believing the word the Bible
[58:47] said the Holy Ghost fell as Peter
[58:48] preached the word this is one of the
[58:51] church this is one of the best times for
[58:53] the Holy Ghost to fall on you and speak
[58:56] to the mountain because that's when it
[58:57] fell in the day of Pentecost amen and
[59:00] when the Samaritans and the the Gentiles
[59:04] lot while Peters preaching the only goes
[59:07] false that's what I like to see now
[59:08] people that are disinterest in the
[59:10] preaching but people that are getting
[59:12] under the anointing that's on the
[59:13] preacher amen
[59:14] and then they'll speak to the mountain
[59:17] because God's anointing you we're the
[59:19] same anointing that's on the preacher
[59:21] and then it's gonna happen because it's
[59:23] God's anointing it's through the
[59:24] atonement through God's provided way not
[59:27] through our power or energy amen
[59:32] that's when God has to anoint you in
[59:35] fact you can look it up look up the word
[59:37] super anointing ever done that before
[59:39] when brother Boehner spoke the squirrels
[59:41] he said it was a super super anointing
[59:44] he said that came upon him well now that
[59:49] makes sense right
[59:49] now you and I can understand what would
[59:51] it be like to ever speak squirrels into
[59:53] existence it's easy to understand you
[59:55] have such an anointing there's no fear
[59:57] you have such an awareness you know God
[1:00:00] is there and the church said we can
[1:00:04] understand it now it's not it's not well
[1:00:06] how could he ever speak to a snowstorm
[1:00:08] and it could leave how could he ever
[1:00:10] speak to a fish and give his life back
[1:00:11] he could do it because it wasn't him
[1:00:14] doing it it was God doing it amen it was
[1:00:17] God vindicating the third Pole amen
[1:00:22] that's why in perfect faith mother ham
[1:00:24] could say that's normal you have to
[1:00:25] worry about it he said we know we're no
[1:00:27] longer wonder about the third for the
[1:00:29] third pole is he the third poles been
[1:00:32] vindicated amen I know yeah thank the
[1:00:40] Lord
[1:00:40] now I told you about that one time I
[1:00:42] spoke to the mountain my co-workers
[1:00:44] infertility guess what she sent me a
[1:00:47] text two weeks ago out of the blue she
[1:00:48] said I had a dream about you mr. Smith
[1:00:51] because they even want another baby so
[1:00:56] I'm waiting for the anointing she said
[1:00:58] she had a dream and the dream she
[1:01:00] couldn't have the baby but she said then
[1:01:02] I came over and smiled at her and said
[1:01:04] they're gonna have another baby
[1:01:06] so what am I waiting for just waiting
[1:01:09] for that waiting for the anointing I'm
[1:01:13] saying like that text about gave me an
[1:01:15] anointing I need to pray about it see
[1:01:20] you and
[1:01:21] I can't speak anything it will no good
[1:01:25] but when God so anoint you your cup
[1:01:27] overflows and you speak to the moment
[1:01:29] it's no longer humanity speaking its
[1:01:32] deity amen
[1:01:37] I didn't hear you praise God amen so the
[1:01:41] thing to do is get under the anointing
[1:01:42] amen and like you said it's not
[1:01:45] something that God's not a show-off
[1:01:48] God's not a clown no you have to do it
[1:01:51] at work I'll show me that you can speak
[1:01:53] the word worker show me can speak the
[1:01:54] word in front your family God's not a
[1:01:56] con God's not a show-off just wait for
[1:01:59] God's time and season see the trouble is
[1:02:03] people don't get under the anointing but
[1:02:04] man said if you want to get in the
[1:02:06] spirit you got to join with everybody
[1:02:07] else clapping you got to start stomping
[1:02:09] your feet you gotta start swaying back
[1:02:10] and forth you got to raise your head you
[1:02:12] cannot sit there like a Wallflower and
[1:02:14] expect to get in the spirit you know you
[1:02:19] get you can't romance that you just like
[1:02:21] the world gets into their big soccer
[1:02:23] games and football games and basketball
[1:02:24] games you got to get the same way
[1:02:26] instead of painting up yourself with the
[1:02:28] Cleveland Cavaliers cars paint yourself
[1:02:31] up with the nine thing of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:33] amen
[1:02:34] get painted up with that right right
[1:02:38] like like the Bible said stay out the
[1:02:41] word until your face is transformed just
[1:02:43] like Moses countenance was transformed
[1:02:45] in God's presence
[1:02:46] get your get our faces in the Word of
[1:02:48] God until the glory of God shines on our
[1:02:51] face that's how you get the trouble is
[1:02:54] people are too tired or too stubborn or
[1:02:57] don't want to confess sins or something
[1:02:58] like that you know how does it every
[1:03:00] Church well it's our church too it's
[1:03:01] every Church we've all real human we all
[1:03:04] got to overcome and get under the
[1:03:05] anointing so true so true lord help us
[1:03:13] amen
[1:03:13] I so brother can preach on heavenly
[1:03:16] places right there's something we've got
[1:03:17] to get into something we have to create
[1:03:19] something we have to we have to give an
[1:03:22] effort to get in that anointing that's
[1:03:25] right I think it's amen on that it takes
[1:03:28] effort churches takes a dying out got to
[1:03:31] give effort now I've
[1:03:34] before by the ass brother Bram could you
[1:03:35] speak us with the third bowl could you
[1:03:37] speak us in the rapture and he said he
[1:03:39] said now my dear friend I know what
[1:03:41] you're saying he said maybe I can polish
[1:03:43] it up a little clearer you see you're
[1:03:44] believing because of the spoken words
[1:03:46] that he said about that all you hear
[1:03:47] witness the squirrels he's somebody's
[1:03:50] notice that was sovereignly given he
[1:03:52] said I never asked him let me do this he
[1:03:56] by his own divine will came to me and
[1:03:58] said you go do this see I wasn't asking
[1:04:01] one thing about it all right Moses never
[1:04:05] asked to go down to Egypt but was God
[1:04:08] that sent him down to Egypt does that
[1:04:10] help over that helps I may have used
[1:04:13] this last a couple times this year but I
[1:04:15] just want to reiterate that to us that
[1:04:17] you can see brother Graham never did
[1:04:19] this on his own accord he would never
[1:04:22] try to do a miracle on his own accord in
[1:04:24] fact that's what he got in trouble for
[1:04:25] at the beginning his ministry he said I
[1:04:27] was in Balaam shoes because I said bring
[1:04:30] all the worst cases up here let me pray
[1:04:31] for those then brother Graham said he
[1:04:33] got he was getting the people's faith in
[1:04:35] miracles rather than faith in the word
[1:04:39] he said God had to correct him on that
[1:04:41] they angel Lord how to correct him on
[1:04:42] that so see it's the same thing you and
[1:04:46] I just have to stay under the anointing
[1:04:47] standard prayer stay in the Word of God
[1:04:49] and God will anoint us to speak his word
[1:04:53] and that's such a great revelation God
[1:04:56] made him wait years and years and years
[1:04:58] oh but look what God did all just struck
[1:05:00] me look what God did once he got the
[1:05:01] revelation then he started speaking the
[1:05:03] word amen
[1:05:05] then they smoked squirrels right they
[1:05:07] spoke to the storm then he spoke to
[1:05:09] meanest tumour Amen hallelujah then he
[1:05:12] spoke to Hattie right see once he laid
[1:05:14] once he waited for the time in season
[1:05:16] four the revelation then the revelation
[1:05:18] came then he could be faithful with the
[1:05:20] revelation then God could trust him with
[1:05:22] his word how do you want God to trust
[1:05:25] you with his word I do Lord trusts me
[1:05:31] with your word help me to be trustworthy
[1:05:32] with your word a true servant of God now
[1:05:39] what I want to get to Sunday and I never
[1:05:40] got to it so let me give me about a few
[1:05:43] more minutes here I had never seen it
[1:05:48] like this now this may not be some some
[1:05:50] huge deep revelation but I just I never
[1:05:52] seen it like this before
[1:05:53] God's fruit in the seeds and the Prophet
[1:05:56] is bringing it the Bible said this you
[1:06:00] read this on Sunday but his delight is
[1:06:01] in the law of the Lord in his law doth
[1:06:02] he meditate day and night he shall be
[1:06:04] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:06:06] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[1:06:07] his season and his leaf also shall not
[1:06:09] wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:06:11] prosper now look what he says the
[1:06:15] restoration of the bride tree I'm gonna
[1:06:18] skip down here he said no notice it's
[1:06:20] his his fruit that's the personal
[1:06:23] pronoun it's his fruit God's fruit in
[1:06:25] the season that the Prophet is bringing
[1:06:29] it it will be in the Prophet season
[1:06:32] God's fruit in God's time by the Prophet
[1:06:34] season see he shall bring forth this
[1:06:36] fruit in his season see if there isn't
[1:06:39] to his there bring forth his God's fruit
[1:06:42] see in the season that the messenger is
[1:06:44] ordained to come he'll bring forth those
[1:06:49] now remember that the messenger that
[1:06:51] brings the fruit of God will bring it in
[1:06:53] God's season in the season of the
[1:06:54] bringer see he will bring forward this
[1:06:56] fruit of season that cannot wither why
[1:06:58] he's got predestined it can't destroy it
[1:07:03] because it's predestinated amen so I've
[1:07:07] never applied this to a prophet I've
[1:07:09] always applied it just to me and you
[1:07:10] those of us born again feeding off the
[1:07:14] river water feeding off the Holy Ghost
[1:07:15] are fruits never wither in other words
[1:07:18] our love doesn't wither our
[1:07:19] long-suffering our peace our joy those
[1:07:22] don't wither we may go a little back
[1:07:25] there there or there never wither that
[1:07:27] you never get to a spot where you saying
[1:07:28] well I just don't have anymore peace
[1:07:30] anymore right never get the spot where
[1:07:33] you say well I have no more patience
[1:07:35] with brother Jesse anymore I'm done I'm
[1:07:37] gonna bawl him out do you ever get there
[1:07:39] before you ever get there I never got
[1:07:43] there with you see the fruit doesn't
[1:07:46] wither because that's what the Bible
[1:07:48] said it can't wither because it's
[1:07:50] predestinated
[1:07:52] it's gonna have somebody other words who
[1:07:54] can manifest the fruit of this hour
[1:07:56] who's able to give out the fruit to
[1:07:58] hungry people that wouldn't experience
[1:08:00] God's real fruit amen
[1:08:02] the sweetness of his fruit glory oh the
[1:08:07] sweetness of it the refreshing of it the
[1:08:11] strength from God's fruit praise God it
[1:08:16] cannot wither you'll never get to a spot
[1:08:19] if you're real only goes real Christian
[1:08:20] you'll never get in a spot where you
[1:08:22] don't have any more long-suffering you
[1:08:23] can't wait any longer for this person to
[1:08:25] get saved you're just you're gonna
[1:08:27] you're done praying for know if you've
[1:08:29] got real fruit that fruit will last but
[1:08:34] the evening light shall rise in the West
[1:08:36] what forward is shine upon the word what
[1:08:38] to ripen the fruit bring forth the bride
[1:08:41] tree with the same signs wonders and
[1:08:43] fruits that they had at the beginning it
[1:08:45] should be lie in the evening time right
[1:08:47] oh the word will then bring forth its
[1:08:49] fruit in its season it shall not wither
[1:08:51] but will bring forth its fruit David
[1:08:53] said in its seasons amen same fruit ooh
[1:08:55] had at the beginning praise God he says
[1:08:59] now look now I'm skipping ahead to the
[1:09:02] Seventh Seal I've held that word look at
[1:09:07] every vision everywhere the day I laid
[1:09:09] that cornerstone yonder I put that in
[1:09:11] there I wrote on there what he showed me
[1:09:14] that morning in a vision look what the
[1:09:16] Holy Spirit told him the instant in
[1:09:19] season and out of season rebuke with all
[1:09:24] long-suffering and doctrine for the time
[1:09:26] will come when they will not endure
[1:09:27] sound doctrine but after their own lust
[1:09:29] shall he for themselves together
[1:09:30] teachers having itching ears and be
[1:09:32] turned away from the truth into fables
[1:09:35] and I've seen those two trees that I
[1:09:37] stood by do that very same thing that's
[1:09:40] right and here we are and that is true
[1:09:42] you remember the vision of the two trees
[1:09:44] where the RAM saw a vision and he saw a
[1:09:47] any tree he saw a oneness tree and God
[1:09:51] said don't don't join neither those
[1:09:53] plant a different tree right in between
[1:09:56] them amen
[1:09:59] and then the truth and that tree grew up
[1:10:01] right and it was mixed in there right it
[1:10:04] was right in the middle of it and then
[1:10:06] said after a while he said that kind of
[1:10:08] weight and then he said then all of all
[1:10:11] of them because of that tree planted all
[1:10:13] the people at the foot of the cross
[1:10:15] praising and worshipping Jesus glory
[1:10:18] amen
[1:10:19] so in other words the true message of
[1:10:22] God will bring people a real experience
[1:10:25] with the cross of Jesus Christ amen
[1:10:28] you know they don't get there in Trinity
[1:10:29] churches do that when the horns of the
[1:10:31] Trinitarian churches I didn't get there
[1:10:33] I really didn't die out in the church
[1:10:36] said I went to oneness Church for a
[1:10:41] little while only a couple services but
[1:10:42] I still went to one I never really got
[1:10:46] to the cross but brother Jose when I
[1:10:48] came to the message church and I came to
[1:10:50] hear that true pure Word of God brother
[1:10:53] I find myself at the cross amen that's
[1:10:58] always been my testimony the other two
[1:11:01] churches the Trinity and the oneness can
[1:11:03] never deliver me from my sins until I
[1:11:05] came to the message of the hour that's
[1:11:07] my testimony there's something I was
[1:11:12] going to say I think I'm gonna say it as
[1:11:16] I was writing a little bit so I devoted
[1:11:20] all this morning to the sermon and then
[1:11:21] at work I had some free time so I devote
[1:11:23] a little bit of time to writing the next
[1:11:26] book so when your Bible go to revelation
[1:11:31] 17 I think it's 9 I just want to lay a
[1:11:33] little thought in here about
[1:11:34] denominations that okay
[1:11:35] hope it's okay it kind of goes with this
[1:11:41] vision I'd yeah I didn't plan that but
[1:11:43] that'll work out who knows in revelation
[1:11:49] 17 what is required in order to
[1:11:53] recognize where the woman sits and who
[1:11:55] she is what is required what does God
[1:11:58] require of you to recognize that or what
[1:12:01] is required to recognize the 666 mark of
[1:12:04] the beast anybody shout it out wisdom
[1:12:07] yeah good Lydia were you looking at my
[1:12:10] notes today I didn't really have in my
[1:12:13] notes I just had it right there
[1:12:16] but I was meditating on the words I'm
[1:12:19] writing chapter 9 it's on Mystery
[1:12:21] Babylon during the 12 New Testament
[1:12:23] mysteries brother man talked about it in
[1:12:24] the services the end time and I'm
[1:12:29] starting off and I'm just the Holy
[1:12:30] Spirit was dealing with me on that
[1:12:32] there's one thing that's required to
[1:12:34] recognize the mother harlot it's wisdom
[1:12:37] I think it's amen to that revelation 17
[1:12:40] 9 I think it is yeah
[1:12:44] and here's the mind which hath wisdom
[1:12:46] the seven heads are seven mountains on
[1:12:48] which the woman sitteth wisdom now go to
[1:12:52] Revelation 13:8 I believe it is is it 13
[1:12:54] 8 nope
[1:12:59] it's 13 18 yeah 13 18 that's right I
[1:13:02] knew it was a 8 in their relation 13 18
[1:13:05] here is wisdom that him that hath
[1:13:08] understanding count the number of the
[1:13:10] beast for his the number of a man and
[1:13:11] his number is six hundred threescore and
[1:13:14] six
[1:13:14] praise God you know you might think Lord
[1:13:22] just give me the power to speak the word
[1:13:23] so I can know whether the mark of the
[1:13:26] beast is right denominations will say
[1:13:29] something
[1:13:29] God just filled me with so much power I
[1:13:32] can speak in tongues like a machine gun
[1:13:34] so I can know who that mother harlot is
[1:13:38] can you believe that you let some people
[1:13:41] think give me some divine healing gift
[1:13:44] let me do miracles I can be a part of
[1:13:47] the true church and gods like that's not
[1:13:50] what's required what's required is
[1:13:53] wisdom and what's the beginning of
[1:13:56] wisdom Church to fear the Lord the fear
[1:14:00] of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom
[1:14:05] now
[1:14:07] how many nations will the Antichrist
[1:14:10] deceive it's a three-letter word all of
[1:14:13] them awesome
[1:14:16] so all that's required to recognize the
[1:14:21] mother harlot in the Trinity Church and
[1:14:23] the one that's right because one this
[1:14:24] will have mark of the beast to any
[1:14:26] denomination their denomination the UPC
[1:14:28] I am said every nomination will take the
[1:14:34] mark of the beast that's thus saith the
[1:14:35] Lord he said that's quite as that's
[1:14:38] quite a thought sir think about that
[1:14:40] they can baptize in his name they
[1:14:43] believe he's one person and there's
[1:14:44] still many people are still taking the
[1:14:45] mark of the beast in that church in that
[1:14:47] shocking is that shock you that shocks
[1:14:49] me they can have all that truth and
[1:14:53] still be a denomination still limit the
[1:14:57] Holy One of Israel still crucify the
[1:14:59] word for their day that right cuz a
[1:15:03] little more makeup that I'm cut their
[1:15:05] hair all these all these other
[1:15:06] signification issues they can't even get
[1:15:08] to second base with God right because
[1:15:09] second base is sanctification right they
[1:15:12] might get the first base through the
[1:15:14] name but they don't get a second base
[1:15:16] now think of this church now how does
[1:15:20] God give wisdom when you have the fear
[1:15:22] of the Lord how does God give wisdom
[1:15:24] what's the one thing you have to do to
[1:15:26] get wisdom once you have fear the Lord
[1:15:27] does anybody know James chapter one
[1:15:31] let's go there James chapter one
[1:15:42] there's one thing you got to do to get
[1:15:44] the wisdom of the Lord now think think
[1:15:47] about this this struck me I was I was so
[1:15:49] shocked when I was writing this I just
[1:15:51] felt the Holy Spirit riding through my
[1:15:53] fingers and typing it out I really did
[1:15:55] it was such a striking moment I like
[1:15:57] mine this is just all coming together
[1:15:58] here I never I never had placed all
[1:16:00] these scriptures together we just put
[1:16:02] about four scriptures together James 1
[1:16:05] verse 5 if any of you lack wisdom let
[1:16:12] him ask of God that giveth to all men
[1:16:16] what how does he give it abounding Leah
[1:16:20] liberally is the King James does God in
[1:16:25] other words does God want to give wisdom
[1:16:27] or not yeah yeah God is God is so
[1:16:31] liberal right he just wants to give God
[1:16:37] once got God's like up there he's saying
[1:16:39] I'd love to give you this wisdom will
[1:16:41] you ask me how many nations are gonna
[1:16:45] take him up on that none cuz they're all
[1:16:49] gonna be deceived I hope everybody see
[1:16:55] yeah the impact of this thought and
[1:17:00] upbraideth not but it shall be given him
[1:17:03] so God said if you ask for wisdom I'll
[1:17:07] gladly give it to you how many can say
[1:17:09] men but first you have to fear the Lord
[1:17:12] you have to respect for God and you got
[1:17:16] to ask and you have to believe verse 6
[1:17:18] but let him and ask him faith nothing
[1:17:20] wavering for he that wave with is like a
[1:17:23] wave of the sea driven with the wind and
[1:17:25] tossed now one more scripture go to
[1:17:27] James for well I check out 2 more why
[1:17:33] how come all these people in the
[1:17:35] denomination or even the message can say
[1:17:37] they're asking God for wisdom and then
[1:17:39] not get it because they're asking with
[1:17:43] the wrong motive and objective you ask
[1:17:48] and receive not because you ask amiss
[1:17:50] that you consume it upon your lusts and
[1:17:57] Jesus said in Matthew 7:14 he said broad
[1:18:01] is the way that leads to destruction and
[1:18:03] many there are many there are that fall
[1:18:04] into that narrow is the way that leads
[1:18:06] to life and how many be there that find
[1:18:08] it few I'm giving a little quizzes here
[1:18:10] tonight how are you ready it was a pop
[1:18:14] quiz so let's put all those together God
[1:18:19] wants to pour out wisdom so people can
[1:18:22] recognize who the false churches he's
[1:18:25] not going to hold it back he wants to
[1:18:27] just give it to everybody but you'll
[1:18:29] receive it because they're not asking
[1:18:32] for wisdom with a pure heart that wants
[1:18:35] to know it they're just asking God give
[1:18:37] me money God give me food God give me a
[1:18:39] sexual partner or God give me this or
[1:18:42] God give me a big house or God give me
[1:18:44] their asking for their lust only all's
[1:18:46] God wants them to ask is God give me
[1:18:49] your wisdom amen
[1:18:50] I knew you gonna say like this I feel
[1:18:54] like there's probably some Solomon's in
[1:18:55] here tonight Amen that you and I did not
[1:18:58] ask for riches or will you and I ask for
[1:19:01] the wisdom of God now do you see what
[1:19:05] I'm trying to say did I bring it across
[1:19:07] ok can anybody see it if I didn't Lord
[1:19:10] let the Holy Spirit reveal to him
[1:19:12] tonight I feel like I maybe didn't bring
[1:19:15] it out the right way
[1:19:16] can you see and you understand that so
[1:19:19] that's why brother man had to plant a
[1:19:21] new seed not seeds of discrepancy but
[1:19:25] pure word seeds amen
[1:19:28] the original seed oh yeah because all
[1:19:33] these other ones were the wrong scene of
[1:19:35] discrepancy and they asked they pray all
[1:19:38] the time sure but they're not asking for
[1:19:41] the truth because it might offend
[1:19:42] somebody might offend their grandma
[1:19:46] might offend their grandpa might offend
[1:19:48] their wife or their girlfriend or their
[1:19:50] boyfriend so when they pray I see it on
[1:19:55] Facebook all the time
[1:19:56] well I'm praying for you here praying
[1:19:57] for you there and they prayed all these
[1:20:00] prayers but it's selfish prayers because
[1:20:02] the next day they're Custance we're go
[1:20:04] to the dirty movies you know sexual sins
[1:20:06] all these things like that music
[1:20:08] filthy music see they're mixing with
[1:20:10] unclean spirits but you and I should be
[1:20:12] free from unclean spirits you and I
[1:20:15] should be under the anointing of the
[1:20:17] Holy Spirit does everybody see that God
[1:20:22] just wants to give out wisdom so they
[1:20:24] can escape the false church and just get
[1:20:26] saved but their problem is they're so
[1:20:29] filled with the lust of the world
[1:20:31] remember if you love the things of the
[1:20:33] world the love of God is not even in you
[1:20:34] and they pray sure they pray but it's
[1:20:38] for the wrong things
[1:20:39] now how many say God helped me to pray
[1:20:41] for the right things that's what I was
[1:20:43] praying earlier prayer so powerful
[1:20:47] because God either answers it like on
[1:20:50] Sunday right Jose or God says no and
[1:20:52] either way it's powerful because it's
[1:20:55] making us wait if you don't answer it
[1:20:56] teaching us to be patient and then we
[1:20:59] get upset about that or we get impatient
[1:21:03] about that it's so powerful now let me
[1:21:09] find
[1:21:09] place the clothes here give me ten
[1:21:13] minutes
[1:21:16] so see the two trees now the two trees
[1:21:21] he couldn't be a part of either one of
[1:21:23] those he had to come plant an original
[1:21:24] seed and had to grow up and then because
[1:21:29] of this tree now they can enter in and
[1:21:31] now they can go to the cross for some
[1:21:32] reason he said it kind of faded out and
[1:21:33] then I didn't quite understand it I
[1:21:36] looked at three or four times on that
[1:21:38] vision so remember second Timothy four
[1:21:44] was Bo's brand Tabernacles foundation
[1:21:47] and it wasn't playing the tapes in new
[1:21:50] season it was preaching the word a new
[1:21:52] season right are you with me Church and
[1:21:56] what the Holy Spirit say said brother
[1:21:58] Graham this is not your Tabernacle right
[1:22:04] but that's what they're making today his
[1:22:06] tabernacle this is his cybernetico God
[1:22:08] said it wasn't in his tabernacle see how
[1:22:12] it's all focus on brother man brother
[1:22:13] man it's close like we like we know it's
[1:22:16] close to idolatry right they're getting
[1:22:17] close god help him we pray for him all
[1:22:19] the time but look all these things that
[1:22:22] are on the tapes and they're all saying
[1:22:23] all these things they're just being
[1:22:27] passed over see it's got to be a chord
[1:22:33] in the word the seasons got to line up
[1:22:35] with the word it's all got to be the
[1:22:37] Word of God amen ha ha thank you lord
[1:22:41] preach the word let me see where I can
[1:22:46] close here I got so many more look I got
[1:22:49] all that okay I'm almost done okay
[1:22:54] ah yeah let me see if I can finish this
[1:22:57] next thought it shall be line the
[1:23:00] evening time Jesus Christ the same
[1:23:02] yesterday and forever the bride tree it
[1:23:04] come up at Pentecost there's a tree that
[1:23:06] David saw it's planted by the rivers of
[1:23:07] water one river the Holy Spirit all
[1:23:09] these waters flowing into a gift
[1:23:11] spiritual gifts flowing into it
[1:23:13] it's leaves can't wither it will bring
[1:23:15] forth its fruit is that right remember
[1:23:17] it'll bring forth its fruit and it's
[1:23:19] season see church this is what this is
[1:23:22] why
[1:23:23] feel like everyone in our church in
[1:23:25] every church needs to be born again
[1:23:26] because if if you're born again these
[1:23:28] gifts will flow right through you
[1:23:30] praise God and number one of those is
[1:23:34] wisdom amen
[1:23:36] one of those is wisdom and mother have
[1:23:39] said that's the most important one
[1:23:40] because that manages all other eight of
[1:23:43] them amen how they do you we want to
[1:23:48] think what miracles is probably the most
[1:23:49] important one but brother Ram said
[1:23:52] wisdom is the most important one his
[1:23:53] wisdom helps you manage the rest and
[1:23:56] also helps you see the true church and
[1:23:58] the false church come out of her my
[1:24:00] people but the sad part is they're so
[1:24:04] few of his people because they don't
[1:24:06] where they want to ask upon their lusts
[1:24:07] they just want to live their best life
[1:24:09] now instead of living their best life
[1:24:11] over there in eternity right it sad to
[1:24:15] say let me finish with this one I said
[1:24:19] look here Fred let's think about nature
[1:24:21] God works in his nature let's watch what
[1:24:22] happened the Sun rose in the east the
[1:24:24] oldest civilization we had civilization
[1:24:26] we have is in China we know I'll know
[1:24:27] that the oldest civilization we have is
[1:24:29] China all right
[1:24:30] the civilizations move west we're all
[1:24:31] along and now where would you leave it
[1:24:33] if if you left the west coast going
[1:24:36] straight across go to China exactly
[1:24:38] we're at the end the Bible said the
[1:24:40] Prophet said there will be a day when it
[1:24:42] won't be day or night when the sons are
[1:24:43] passing over when the evening time just
[1:24:46] before ends up over there again it'll be
[1:24:47] light the same jesus said there will be
[1:24:49] a former rain and a latter rain and the
[1:24:51] latter rain will produce both former
[1:24:53] rain and latter rain in the same season
[1:24:57] praise God we're at the end time so
[1:25:03] remember this is bro Graham said this is
[1:25:05] thus saith the Lord the church age book
[1:25:07] he says and he will cause to come down
[1:25:11] for you the rain the former rain and the
[1:25:12] latter rain in the first month and
[1:25:15] brother man says that's the same season
[1:25:17] praise God so well other man's ministry
[1:25:24] was the former rain the teaching rain
[1:25:26] and then the rapturing faith is the
[1:25:28] latter rain so can I say like this we're
[1:25:31] in the same season of the layers in
[1:25:33] church age it's the same season we
[1:25:36] haven't changed see
[1:25:37] since it's still brother-sister it's
[1:25:39] still harvest time amen
[1:25:41] what is it just getting drier and drier
[1:25:43] and we just got to lay the Prince of the
[1:25:46] Sun right we gotta wait for that last
[1:25:48] latter rain by the grace of God because
[1:25:51] it is the same season now he says they
[1:25:56] had many Exodus is of course but I'm
[1:25:58] speaking of time that God called in
[1:25:59] Exodus a separation from where they were
[1:26:01] at the present time here God is making
[1:26:04] ready to fulfill his divine promised
[1:26:05] word that he gave to Abraham and to
[1:26:07] Isaac and to Jacob years hundreds of
[1:26:09] years of past but yet God never forgets
[1:26:12] his promise in the season the do time
[1:26:18] God always makes his promise right oh
[1:26:24] yeah praise God this rapture promise has
[1:26:28] been here 2,000 years but it doesn't
[1:26:31] make any difference to God it's still
[1:26:34] gonna come to pass in God's season amen
[1:26:37] God didn't forget like I wonder what
[1:26:39] season it is now I wonder what word the
[1:26:43] bride needs next he's not wondering it
[1:26:46] he never forgets they meant he was on
[1:26:49] time for the first sxs that brought two
[1:26:52] million people out of Egypt physically
[1:26:54] he was on time for the day of Pentecost
[1:26:56] and he brought all those three thousand
[1:26:58] out right away into the baptism the Holy
[1:27:00] Ghost and brother/sister he'll be on
[1:27:02] time so he changed our body so we can be
[1:27:05] at that meeting in the air in that sweet
[1:27:07] sweet by mine and it'll be your time he
[1:27:11] never forgets his promise amen therefore
[1:27:16] you can rest assured that what God has
[1:27:19] promised in the Bible he's going to do
[1:27:22] it just no need to try to think anything
[1:27:24] else to say well the promise and maybe
[1:27:27] maybe brother Brandon was wrong he was
[1:27:29] right brother and it was right with us a
[1:27:33] to live he was right it's going to come
[1:27:36] to pass it's not saith the Lord it's
[1:27:38] according this word
[1:27:39] don't let doubts come into your mind
[1:27:41] just let's just believe the saith the
[1:27:43] Lord amen
[1:27:47] it looks
[1:27:48] what church it looks awful for the Roman
[1:27:50] Catholic Church I don't know how well I
[1:27:52] maybe I do now I didn't know how that
[1:27:54] false prophet was gonna pull off
[1:27:57] changing their reputation their
[1:27:59] reputation is dirt right now because of
[1:28:02] all these sexual crimes in America but
[1:28:05] actually I think I do know how it's
[1:28:06] gonna come to pass the Bible said he'll
[1:28:08] do lying wonders and miracles and with
[1:28:11] flatteries right he'll take the hill
[1:28:15] take the covenant with the people the
[1:28:17] Pope is gonna just flatter them and say
[1:28:19] such wonderful Christians right oh
[1:28:23] you're such sweet sweet people thank you
[1:28:27] for your love and thank all you just
[1:28:29] thank you we all got to be one
[1:28:32] let's have communion together come to my
[1:28:34] church of course so make you go to his
[1:28:36] church he won't come to your church
[1:28:38] eventually you go to the Jewish Church
[1:28:40] right because that's in the temple of
[1:28:41] God saying that he is God but then he'll
[1:28:44] do miracles church and the whole world
[1:28:47] will wonder well I guess we can forget
[1:28:50] all this sexual molestation maybe God
[1:28:52] forgave him God never forgave them
[1:28:55] because they never repented in order to
[1:28:58] be forgiven you've got to repent and
[1:29:00] they've never repented they keep these
[1:29:02] men and most of the men in the positions
[1:29:04] there's never any judgment opponent it
[1:29:06] was a real child of God they would lay
[1:29:08] that axe of the root of the tree amen
[1:29:11] hallelujah they would cut those sinners
[1:29:14] out of their churches amen nuns are like
[1:29:16] nuns and priests alike but it shows
[1:29:18] they're not interested in that they're
[1:29:20] interested in tickling their ears
[1:29:25] well maybe brother Branham was wrong
[1:29:27] maybe there won't be any driverless cars
[1:29:28] or maybe there won't be a mark of the
[1:29:30] beast with a unionized religion no there
[1:29:34] will be it whether or whether people
[1:29:37] want to accept their or not there's
[1:29:38] going to be it because this thus saith
[1:29:40] the Holy Bible that's right not the most
[1:29:44] impossible then more impossible than it
[1:29:46] does now he says but God did it anyhow
[1:29:50] because he promised he would do it oh
[1:29:53] thank the Lord and look how simple he
[1:29:56] does do it so see we're looking for
[1:29:58] something great Church we are looking
[1:29:59] for something worldwide it's
[1:30:01] gonna be something worldwide brother man
[1:30:03] said it'll be so humble right with the
[1:30:06] third pole so it's working he said
[1:30:08] they'll be so humble but it will be for
[1:30:10] the bride don't look for something great
[1:30:14] don't look like it has to come in
[1:30:16] special services will when it's brother
[1:30:18] Jessica and right brother so-and-so from
[1:30:19] there brother
[1:30:20] where does he when are we gonna have
[1:30:22] that we might we don't have to have that
[1:30:24] we don't know what God's gonna do but
[1:30:27] one thing we know it's going to be so
[1:30:29] simple
[1:30:29] it'll be so humble it'll be God
[1:30:32] anointing us to speak the word he'll
[1:30:37] speak it Amen right it'll be him here's
[1:30:40] his anointing will overflow us amen
[1:30:42] he'll bring his old word to pass he says
[1:30:47] I have come down to Akron Ohio I've
[1:30:52] heard the cry let's stand to our feet
[1:30:53] I've heard the cry of Bride of Christ
[1:30:55] fellowship I remember my promise to my
[1:30:57] bride I've come down and do it I'm
[1:31:00] sending you you knew it I'm going to be
[1:31:02] with you certainly I'll be with you my
[1:31:03] never never failing presence will be
[1:31:06] with you wherever you go
[1:31:07] don't be afraid oh I like that don't you
[1:31:11] I'm coming deliver
[1:31:14] I'm sure the spiritual mind catches that
[1:31:17] see I'm going to send you to bring my
[1:31:19] people to Nexis call them out and I'll
[1:31:21] be with you that's what God did with
[1:31:24] brother Branham praise be let's stop
[1:31:26] right there maokai you want to come here
[1:31:28] I just had a few more slides but I think
[1:31:30] stop right there because that's kind of
[1:31:32] a different thought there let's finish
[1:31:34] with that thought God is going to
[1:31:40] mr. past the former I and he will cause
[1:31:43] to come down you the former rain and the
[1:31:45] latter rain in the same season that's
[1:31:49] encouraging Church it's encouraging for
[1:31:51] us tonight to know that we're still
[1:31:52] living in the same season as brother
[1:31:54] Branham lived
[1:31:55] Leora see him and last time we checked
[1:31:59] the book of Revelation Jesus is still
[1:32:01] standing in the myths of the seven
[1:32:02] golden candlesticks three on this side
[1:32:05] three on this side one in the middle
[1:32:07] he's still standing
[1:32:08] that means Church he's standing here
[1:32:10] tonight if there's any needs on our
[1:32:13] hearts tonight since bow our heads here
[1:32:16] let's think about the needs that we have
[1:32:19] as I said earlier maybe a major decision
[1:32:22] will come up pretty soon
[1:32:23] if so Church then you and I whoever's in
[1:32:28] this decision seat needs to seek God
[1:32:31] with all of your heart because God said
[1:32:42] you'll seek me and find me when you seek
[1:32:43] me with all your heart baby church you
[1:32:47] just have a little minor decision and
[1:32:48] maybe need wisdom then the thing to do
[1:32:52] is ask God with a pure heart with pure
[1:32:57] motives and objectives and then believe
[1:33:00] he's going to give it to you and he'll
[1:33:01] give it to you
[1:33:03] [Music]
[1:33:10] we're privileged people hallelujah
[1:33:14] we're living in Exodus where God never
[1:33:16] forgets his promise God set his tree and
[1:33:23] he planted between two seeds of
[1:33:25] discrepancy the original seed tree and
[1:33:29] it's bringing forth evening time fruit
[1:33:32] that you and I get to enjoy thank God
[1:33:34] for that this evening time fruit doesn't
[1:33:37] wither all we can thank you for that
[1:33:39] Jesus amen hallelujah the fruit of the
[1:33:42] message doesn't wither because it's true
[1:33:46] now just as it was 56 years ago how they
[1:33:50] do thank you lord
[1:33:59] let's pray to night church and if you're
[1:34:04] in that area you're in that spot that
[1:34:05] valley decision where you got to make a
[1:34:07] major decision or a minor let's pray for
[1:34:09] wisdom tonight
[1:34:17] because he's liberally trying to give it
[1:34:20] to us we're so thankful for that
[1:34:22] Heavenly Father's we bow our heads we
[1:34:24] thank you for the word tonight Lord
[1:34:25] seeing that he's always speaking your
[1:34:28] time and season Lord as we read at the
[1:34:31] beginning your prophet said or not here
[1:34:34] my chance tonight we're here because
[1:34:40] this is the sovereign will of God Lord
[1:34:42] you ordained that we came to church
[1:34:44] tonight to hear this word or there's so
[1:34:50] much that was said Lord perhaps you're
[1:34:52] encouraging us to wait to speak the word
[1:34:54] until we're fully anointed with that
[1:34:56] super anointing how they do you maybe we
[1:35:01] have a major decision let us before we
[1:35:04] decide let's make sure we've sought you
[1:35:05] with all of our heart in all five must
[1:35:08] line up with the will of God maybe it's
[1:35:14] at this end of the sermon this thought
[1:35:16] here Lord and we just have to ask and
[1:35:19] you liberally give us your wisdom or
[1:35:24] maybe if we've doubted in thought well
[1:35:26] maybe gods forgot his promise sir
[1:35:29] maybe Road RAM was wrong on some of
[1:35:31] these things god help us to see that
[1:35:33] your truth your fruit never withers
[1:35:37] hallelujah and you want to give us the
[1:35:40] wisdom Lord many times more than we want
[1:35:42] to receive it so help your people Lord
[1:35:45] many of them having decisions and I'll
[1:35:48] run I know I'm speaking in those live

[1:36:18] who needed it Lord God so thank you Lord

[1:36:51] awkward to pass we need the insolvent we
[1:36:55] can't speak nothing into existence we
[1:36:57] need the atonement to anoint us to speak
[1:37:00] your promise word into existence or
[1:37:02] anoint us with that anointing from the
[1:37:05] scene of atonement amen hallelujah
