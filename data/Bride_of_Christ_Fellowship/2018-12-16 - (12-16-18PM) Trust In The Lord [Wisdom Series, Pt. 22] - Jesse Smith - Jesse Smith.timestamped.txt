[31:00] here let's get right into the Word of
[31:01] God here I like to just preach on
[31:04] another proverbs sermon here I like to
[31:07] try to get that series completed as well
[31:10] so if you have your Bibles let's go to
[31:12] proverbs chapter 3 bless you
[31:36] proverbs chapter 3 verse 1 selected this
[31:53] is part 22 Lydia I'm not sure if you're
[31:55] recording it or not but part 22 of
[31:57] though we're just gonna call it the
[31:58] wisdom series by the grace of the Lord
[32:06] so I went through every time brother
[32:08] Branham said the word proverb and then I
[32:10] pulled out the different thoughts that
[32:12] he said about proverbs so I like to look
[32:14] at that tonight I think there'll be a
[32:16] blessing to you
[32:18] robbers three verse one says my son
[32:24] forget not my law but let thine heart
[32:26] keep my Commandments for length of days
[32:30] and long life and peace shall they add
[32:32] to thee let not mercy and truth forsake
[32:36] thee bind them about thy neck write them
[32:40] upon the table of thine heart so shalt
[32:44] thou find favour and good understanding
[32:45] in the sight of God and man let's read
[32:50] verse five together ready one two three
[32:53] trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[32:55] and lean not unto thine own
[32:58] understanding let's read verse six one
[33:00] two three and all thy ways acknowledge
[33:03] him and he shall direct thy paths I'll
[33:06] read verse 7 be not wise in thine own
[33:08] eyes fear the Lord and depart from evil
[33:12] verse a it shall be health to thy navel
[33:15] and marrow to thy bones
[33:17] praise God let's bow our heads here for
[33:19] word of Prayer if ever need on your
[33:21] heart just make it known unto the Lord
[33:22] here
[33:23] Heavenly Father we come to you tonight
[33:25] we worship You Lord we sang to you we've
[33:28] offered prayers in thy great name so
[33:30] father we ask now Lord God you anoint me
[33:33] as I preach your word Lord anoint each
[33:35] here Lord Rosse closer to you Lord speak
[33:38] these words of life to our hearts Lord
[33:41] God that they might be deeply planted in
[33:43] the ground of our heart Lord and bring
[33:45] forth
[33:46] through in its season father god water
[33:48] these things Lord as these some of these
[33:50] things we've heard before water these
[33:52] precious thoughts the Lord God these
[33:54] proverbs and father we just ask that
[33:57] you'd be glorified Heavenly Father bless
[33:59] our fellowship here Lord bless the the
[34:02] atmosphere Lord may we feel your
[34:04] presence dear Lord
[34:05] in Jesus Christ's name the church said
[34:07] Amen god bless you to be in seated
[34:09] praise God so as I said I went through
[34:19] this quite a few months ago they went
[34:21] through brother grams sermons and I
[34:23] looked at every time he said the word
[34:24] proverbs I want to get a good
[34:26] understanding of what he said and so
[34:28] we'll look at some of these thoughts
[34:30] that he gives us here in regards to the
[34:34] wisdom so this is the first one I like
[34:38] to mention here tonight and sobrams
[34:43] talking about this scripture and he says
[34:46] it's he says this is one of the most
[34:50] beautiful Scripture he reads proverbs 3
[34:54] what we just got done reading he said oh
[34:55] I think that's the most beautiful
[34:57] scripture he said I want to take a text
[35:00] he said I the fifth verse lean not unto
[35:03] thy own understanding is that beautiful
[35:05] to you verse I trust in the Lord with
[35:08] all thine heart and lean not unto thine
[35:12] own understanding
[35:13] you know church were in a day of
[35:15] increased knowledge right daniel said a
[35:17] knowledge will be increased at the end
[35:19] time and it's so important now to get a
[35:22] degree or it's so important to be
[35:24] smarter to be a sage on the stage as
[35:27] they say but you know God looks at it
[35:30] the other way God looks at we must
[35:32] become humble when we become humble
[35:34] we're actually doing the right thing
[35:36] rather than trying to figure out things
[35:38] we cannot lean unto thy own
[35:40] understanding we've got to trust in the
[35:43] Lord with all of our heart now it's
[35:45] important to note to in verse 7 be not
[35:47] wise in their own eyes fear the Lord and
[35:49] depart from evil now we know it's it's
[35:54] ok you know to go to school it's ok to
[35:56] get degrees and that's alright as long
[35:58] as that doesn't
[35:59] our faith in God and the way we know
[36:02] that is by verse seven by fearing the
[36:04] Lord and departing from evil so we know
[36:07] no matter how much we learn in school no
[36:10] matter how much we learn in the college
[36:11] or in a trade or something as long as
[36:15] we're constantly leaving evil a
[36:18] confessing sin and walking away from sin
[36:21] then we know we can still fulfill verse
[36:23] five and lean upon God's understanding
[36:27] and not our own remember there was great
[36:30] men there was great men that were smart
[36:32] I remember about Daniel in the Hebrew
[36:34] children they were smarter than all the
[36:36] other ones right the Bible said they
[36:37] were more advanced in science knowledge
[36:39] and wisdom but yet when it came down to
[36:42] the lines then to Daniel try to figure
[36:44] it out scientifically and get out his
[36:45] Scrolls and and try to understand how
[36:48] can God do this the three Hebrew
[36:50] children that they try to figure out the
[36:51] temperature well maybe the temperatures
[36:53] this hot maybe if we have a certain
[36:55] layer of clothing we can shield
[36:57] ourselves from the temperature no they
[37:00] didn't lean upon their own understanding
[37:01] so their their perfect example and
[37:04] church they lived in the midst of
[37:05] Babylon just like we do they're a great
[37:08] example for us to look to that and say
[37:13] just like they they said it's good to
[37:15] know these things it's good to to work
[37:17] and do my job I think of a guy who works
[37:20] there with tools you know he's probably
[37:21] got to do measurements and he's probably
[37:22] got to figure out something with math he
[37:27] has to do that but that that doesn't
[37:29] have to take away his walk with the Lord
[37:32] it doesn't hurt our walk with the Lord
[37:34] when we when we understand maybe the
[37:36] laws of science and the laws of God that
[37:38] he's placed in mathematics and
[37:40] everything as we're looking at the
[37:41] numbers this morning that doesn't have
[37:43] to hurt our walk with God the thing we
[37:45] must do though has never become wise in
[37:47] our own eyes
[37:48] we must never think well I'm somebody
[37:50] because of what I've done or what I've
[37:51] learned we must always remain humble and
[37:54] put all of our trust in the Lord now
[37:57] brother Branham says I think that's the
[37:58] most beautiful scripture and he preached
[38:00] the whole sermon in 1965 called Lina
[38:03] upon that own understanding and as when
[38:06] I listened to it I found that he just
[38:09] kept going back to that thought about
[38:12] how we must just trust in the law
[38:13] and he went through all the different
[38:15] ages where there was believers and in
[38:17] every age the believers had to trust in
[38:19] God's Word instead of what men said or
[38:21] what science said and we of course find
[38:24] ourselves in the same way today but I
[38:26] want to look at this scripture in
[38:28] another sermon he preached called
[38:30] oneness in 1962 brother Branham says he
[38:36] says Christians have to battle with
[38:37] being a better class of people that goes
[38:39] to a church or he says all the church's
[38:42] ability bigger building they're smarter
[38:44] men and brother Graham said that don't
[38:46] have one thing to do with it
[38:47] he said sayings much smarter than Eve he
[38:53] says but she he says she didn't it
[38:55] wasn't even in the picture she wasn't
[38:57] supposed to be smart she was supposed to
[38:59] be obedient we're not supposed to be
[39:03] smart
[39:03] Jesus are the children of this world or
[39:05] the kingdom of this world is much
[39:07] smarter the children of darkness than
[39:09] the children of light
[39:11] we are likened to sheep sheep can't even
[39:15] lead themselves can you say amen to that
[39:17] you and I can't even lead ourselves into
[39:20] this coming week we have to trust Lord
[39:24] lead me through this week because I
[39:26] can't lead myself of course don't get me
[39:30] wrong if you feel led of the Spirit to
[39:31] do a certain thing this week then that
[39:33] is God's leading but we can't plan it
[39:36] out and make make it seem like well I'll
[39:38] do everything that I think I want to do
[39:39] it it's all gonna work out this way we
[39:42] can't cross bridges before we get to
[39:43] them praise God but we can't ask the
[39:46] Lord for his wisdom he says sheep can't
[39:50] even lead themselves they've got to have
[39:52] a shepherd God don't want a smart he
[39:55] wants us to lean on his understanding
[39:57] just where he leads see the picture he
[40:00] said don't lean on your own
[40:01] understanding proverbs 3 and 5 no matter
[40:05] how contrary it seems and how big the
[40:08] bright lights look out there don't pay
[40:10] attention to it just lean on his
[40:12] understanding what he says to be the
[40:14] truth that's what I'm gonna be facing
[40:16] here in a few minutes I'm gonna go up
[40:17] those big bright lights and Akron and
[40:18] the hospitals has those big bright
[40:20] lights but as much as we appreciate that
[40:23] we can't lean upon that we've gotta lean
[40:25] upon God's promise
[40:27] that's right what he says is the truth
[40:31] now brother Bannon skips now to first
[40:34] Corinthians 4:20 so liddy can you pull
[40:37] it up there first Corinthians 4:20
[40:43] I'm gonna turn there to see brings the
[40:47] scripture out there just for the kingdom
[40:50] of God is not in word but in power now
[40:55] of course don't know must understand
[40:57] that we've got to preach the word we've
[40:59] got to read the word we've got to
[41:00] believe the word but what this scripture
[41:02] is referring to is the power that goes
[41:04] with that word as we said this morning
[41:09] you know a good example of that would be
[41:12] Lord a you know if we looked at the
[41:14] number 6 then the anointed man if we ran
[41:16] if we just heard that and we knew we are
[41:20] not anointed then it was just word if we
[41:22] just stayed unknown t'adore stayed
[41:24] worldly but if we saw the power behind
[41:26] that and repented of our our mistakes
[41:29] and now we feel anointed well then we
[41:31] receive the power of that word praise
[41:34] God
[41:35] amen so see that's what it comes down to
[41:38] though the preaching has to and for me
[41:41] too for all of us
[41:42] has to be more than a word we've got to
[41:44] receive the power of that word now
[41:47] program reads this and he says if you
[41:49] want to put that down he says the
[41:50] kingdom of God is God's Word made power
[41:54] what is the kingdom of God Jesus says
[41:57] the kingdom of God is within you
[41:58] the kingdom is within you and when the
[42:01] word comes in there what does the this
[42:03] word begin it turned itself into power
[42:06] making it say just exactly what it said
[42:10] amen to see when the word of God comes
[42:13] in our hearts it's comes in our hearts
[42:15] and is supposed to produce something
[42:17] it's supposed to be building and
[42:18] building and building that's my brother
[42:20] man talks about faith building he talks
[42:22] about sermons that build your faith so
[42:25] he should have heard the word this
[42:26] morning we should heard the hear the
[42:27] word tonight
[42:28] and it should be building our faith
[42:29] because it starts as a word but it's got
[42:32] to become more than that it's got to
[42:34] become power praise God
[42:38] man
[42:40] can't say it says this and it says this
[42:42] and make it work you got to say the same
[42:44] thing the word says that makes the
[42:45] confession not saying well it's polished
[42:49] up a little here how more wisdom and
[42:50] I'll be better standing over here you
[42:52] stay with the word there it is and it
[42:55] makes it power Jesus Christ is the same
[42:57] yesterday today and forever all right
[43:02] now what is it you've got to get with
[43:04] the word he says get yourself killed out
[43:08] what a statement get yourself killed out
[43:11] I'm persuaded that many of us friends
[43:14] have received the Holy Ghost but we
[43:16] receive just enough Holy Ghost in us to
[43:19] make us to a place where we don't want
[43:21] to lie don't want to steal we don't want
[43:24] to do anything but God wants to fill
[43:26] every fiber of his church he wants to
[43:29] fill you're thinking he wants to fill
[43:31] your mind he wants to fill every bit of
[43:33] you just make you completely totally
[43:35] dead to yourself or to your thinking
[43:38] just so surrendered in God till his
[43:41] words just living right through you amen
[43:44] he says you don't know nothing else but
[43:47] God's Word just stay right with his word
[43:49] it is life my words our life said Jesus
[43:54] he's placed with them teachers believing
[43:56] the Bible prophets that say the truth
[43:58] that say that show the same prophecy
[44:01] that they've always did down through the
[44:02] age what's he done he's showing himself
[44:04] alive among them confirming his word his
[44:07] word the kingdom of God is God's Word
[44:10] made power amen
[44:12] I like that praise God God's Word God's
[44:16] kingdom is his word made power remember
[44:21] we can't we can't bring that to past
[44:23] ourselves we've got to let God bring us
[44:27] to that place we got to let God reveal
[44:30] his will to us praise the Lord now I
[44:34] want to look at a few more scriptures
[44:36] here and I just thought it
[44:39] good look a little bit of thoughts on
[44:43] this power now to get God's power to to
[44:48] heal or God's power to move in our life
[44:50] we've got to confess all of our sin
[44:52] that's the first step
[44:54] the Bible says confess your faults in
[44:57] James chapter five one to another
[44:59] confess your faults and then after we
[45:03] confess our faults we know God's
[45:04] forgiven us then the second step we must
[45:07] ask God for His perfect will what is
[45:10] God's will is God's will to do what we
[45:13] want him to do or is does God have a
[45:15] different will than our requests
[45:17] so first confess and then ask God for
[45:21] the perfect will of God and then once we
[45:26] know God's will then we can go on acting
[45:29] like we're healed right or acting like
[45:32] we've already received what we got now
[45:36] I've said this before and I remember it
[45:37] caused a little bit confusion I did talk
[45:39] to some people afterwards but there's
[45:41] very few people that you and I know that
[45:44] walk around doing this like they walk
[45:47] around and and and what I mean is that
[45:50] there's very few people that walk around
[45:51] saying I know I've got thus saith the
[45:53] Lord before it happens
[45:55] see because revelation is a very rare
[45:58] thing right because somebody that's
[46:02] walking around like that they're saying
[46:03] they've got thus saith the Lord
[46:05] basically they're saying like like
[46:07] they're a prophet almost so it's very
[46:10] rare that we see people doing this and
[46:13] so many times like even in my life I've
[46:16] experienced when I pray for people and I
[46:19] find out their heel later many times
[46:22] I'll rejoice because I wasn't sure
[46:24] although I felt very sincere when I we
[46:26] pray for them but I'm not I'm not a
[46:28] prophet enough to know that God was
[46:30] gonna do it and I think that's how a lot
[46:33] of us are right most of us don't walk
[46:35] around you know saying oh I know God God
[46:37] spoke to my heart and gave me a voice
[46:39] and that now that that's all good that's
[46:41] wonderful
[46:42] but it just doesn't happen maybe like
[46:43] that all the time so what we must do is
[46:48] we must confess God's Word and and ask
[46:52] him to reveal
[46:53] his will to us in fact program says this
[46:57] he's talking about prayer cards and
[47:00] people will say oh I didn't even get a
[47:01] prayer card in the prayer line he said
[47:04] but look brother he said these people
[47:05] got prayer cards but that don't mean
[47:07] they're going to be healed there's
[47:09] people sitting on the audience that
[47:11] doesn't mean they're going to be healed
[47:12] that doesn't say they will or will not
[47:15] be healed that all depends on their
[47:17] faith in God amen so even if someone
[47:23] doesn't come up here for prayer no
[47:25] matter where they are even if they're
[47:26] live streaming here tonight it doesn't
[47:28] matter where they are they're healing or
[47:31] their answer from God all depends on one
[47:33] thing that's their faith and faith is a
[47:35] revelation is that right now here
[47:39] brother ham says it again huh me knows
[47:41] that's true no matter how religious you
[47:43] are or how good or bad you are unless
[47:46] the grace of God drops that into your
[47:48] heart
[47:49] you're never get well he says amen
[47:53] no matter how good or matter how holy
[47:55] you think you know I think I am we're
[47:58] never gonna really receive a revelation
[48:01] unless God's grace drops it down into
[48:03] her heart so what are we sure we're all
[48:06] at the mercy of God
[48:08] we're all at the grace of God we each
[48:11] one of us need grace how many company
[48:13] believe that Jesus brother said jesus
[48:21] promised if you could believe it would
[48:22] happen if you can't believe it it just
[48:25] won't happen now I can't make you
[48:26] believe neither can you make yourself
[48:28] believe and the church said Amen I can't
[48:32] and I'm going to pray for this boy I
[48:33] just can't I just kind of I'm actually
[48:35] building my faith for that prayer
[48:36] through this message I can't trust in
[48:39] anything else I can only trust in the
[48:41] Word of God program says you cannot make
[48:45] yourself believe God has got to give it
[48:48] to you he says it's a gift of God to
[48:53] believe not your faith he said it's
[48:55] God's faith your intellectual faith
[48:59] might believe it's fine but unless the
[49:02] faith of God is down in your hearts eat
[49:05] your intellectual faith can accept it do
[49:07] that
[49:08] now here's what I like what he says and
[49:10] just keep believing it with all your
[49:13] heart until God does reveal it to you I
[49:16] like that game ahem
[49:18] see just keep believing it until God
[49:21] does reveal it
[49:22] so see many times we don't know God's
[49:25] will to heal so we've got to just keep
[49:29] believing it and and using our
[49:31] intellectual understanding and and our
[49:33] in other words we gotta use our hope
[49:34] we've got a hope it's going to happen
[49:36] and keep confessing it will happen until
[49:38] God drops that genuine faith down in our
[49:42] hearts amen praise God
[49:51] boba have said now faith is a revelation
[49:53] from God now faith is a revelation
[49:55] there's where I want to stay there just
[49:57] a moment it's a revelation he has
[49:59] revealed it to you by His grace it's
[50:01] nothing you did you didn't work yourself
[50:04] up into faith you ever have faith it's
[50:07] give to you by the grace of God praise
[50:11] the Lord
[50:11] I just want to meditate on that just for
[50:14] a few more moments
[50:15] keep believing it with all your heart
[50:18] until God does reveal it to you trust in
[50:20] the Lord with all your heart don't lean
[50:22] on your own understanding in all your
[50:25] ways acknowledge him and he'll make your
[50:27] paths straight
[50:29] praise God
[50:31] so church many times that's how I
[50:33] operate I'm sure you do too like
[50:36] remember when brother Simon and I prayed
[50:37] for my my friend's father which we're
[50:40] trying to see I got in contact with his
[50:42] son today and we're trying to set
[50:43] something up to maybe see him in about
[50:45] two weeks when we go back home actually
[50:48] it's actually next Monday to Mondays but
[50:51] brother Simon looked at it he saw a few
[50:53] things and I remember on the phone you
[50:55] know this this man has passed out he's
[50:56] in a coma and Simon tells me on the
[50:58] phone he's healed and he hasn't he's
[51:02] been out he has he's been unconscious
[51:04] for days and then I'd be honest in my
[51:06] heart I'm like okay brother you know I'm
[51:08] hoping it hadn't dropped down in my
[51:10] heart but I went the prayer closet
[51:13] anyway with all the faith in sincerity I
[51:16] spoke to that mountain of the heart
[51:17] trouble in the coma and I spoke and I
[51:19] commanded it to move in geez
[51:21] Christ's name now after I got a few
[51:24] encouraging now the next day when he
[51:25] opened his eyes and next day that really
[51:27] raised my faith but I'm just trying to
[51:30] show you like that drug that this
[51:32] healing dropped in Simon's heart before
[51:34] it dropped in my heart but see I just
[51:37] tried to keep confessing what he
[51:38] believed and put our faith together put
[51:41] my hope with his faith and just keep
[51:45] confessing it until God would drop it
[51:47] down in my heart amen and then pretty
[51:50] soon after a couple of weeks after each
[51:51] one well then it's over you know it's a
[51:53] reality praise God
[51:55] God has he's done it so that's a brother
[51:59] BAM says you cannot make yourself
[52:01] believe so he advises us just keep
[52:05] believing it with all your heart until
[52:07] God does reveal it to you keep
[52:11] confessing and we see that a lot you
[52:13] know I see that a lot with brother Amen
[52:15] you know what I talked to him about you
[52:16] know how's his family doing and I just
[52:18] love how he always confesses God's gonna
[52:20] bring Lucy in God's gonna bring Lucy it
[52:22] God's gonna bring Lucy him yeah I love
[52:25] that I just love it's never a doubt or
[52:28] anything like that God's she's gonna
[52:29] come in he said she's gonna come in so
[52:31] it seems like God's revealed that to him
[52:33] and time will tell but I like how even
[52:35] let's say God hasn't either way he still
[52:38] got the right testimony he's still
[52:40] confessing what he believes God is going
[52:43] to do maybe not without maybe not with
[52:45] her thus saith the Lord but just
[52:47] believing because he's asked that God
[52:49] will do it I like that so I just wanted
[52:53] to revisit that here that the kingdom of
[52:55] God is not how smart we can me now I can
[52:58] put myself like I'm doing today I can
[53:00] fast and pray and I can preach God's
[53:03] Word and all these things but I can't
[53:05] make myself believe I'll tell you
[53:07] there's something down inside of me that
[53:09] already believes he can do it amen
[53:11] that's called the seed of God the Word
[53:15] of God but now to know that God is going
[53:18] to do it I don't know that yet but I'm
[53:20] trying to piece together the signs I'm
[53:22] trying to piece together what God's
[53:23] doing the season and see if this would
[53:25] be the season God would do it but there
[53:28] is something inside of you that knows
[53:29] God can do it praise God
[53:33] that's that seed of God the Bible said
[53:35] you're born again of the incorruptible
[53:37] seed which is the Word of God now I just
[53:44] want to read that
[53:48] now go to proverbs 18 I'm just gonna hit
[53:51] a few proverbs scriptures like I said
[53:52] I'll do about fifteen more minutes I
[53:54] don't mean to preach all day I do want
[53:56] to pray for that boy and I don't want to
[53:58] go too late
[54:00] remember about answers I think that's
[54:02] the most beautiful scripture trust in
[54:04] the Lord with all your heart and lean
[54:07] not on your own understanding let's all
[54:10] trust the Lord today praise God proverbs
[54:13] 18:10 so Belgrad preach I think this
[54:15] sermon about five times letting off the
[54:17] pressure how many ever heard one of
[54:18] those proverbs 18:10 well his text was
[54:21] in Proverbs and of course this is a
[54:29] sermon where brother Branham always
[54:31] talks about all the pressure in the
[54:32] modern society proverbs 18:10 the name
[54:45] of the Lord is a strong tower the
[54:47] righteous run ahthe into it and is safe
[54:52] buh-bam says he says I want to use this
[54:55] he said letting off the pressure as a
[54:56] text I chose this because before coming
[54:59] to a meeting I always try to pray and
[55:01] try to seek the Lord not to stand before
[55:04] any congregation smaller great one to a
[55:06] million would be to stand there not to
[55:09] be seen or to be heard but to do
[55:11] something to glorify my lord there force
[55:18] the need of the people I wouldn't come
[55:21] here to be heard because I'm not much to
[55:23] listen to bad voice not an educated man
[55:25] and never stay with my text I skip all
[55:28] over from Genesis to Revelation and I'm
[55:30] not an eloquent speaker but I do love
[55:32] the Lord and I can't love Christ until
[55:36] first I love his people I've got to love
[55:38] his people so if I love his people then
[55:41] I love him praise God so so see Church
[55:45] this is a most important scripture it's
[55:49] so beautiful here to see that we must
[55:52] trust in the Lord we must just run to
[55:55] whatever the word says just run there
[55:58] and just camp out amen just to abide
[56:02] there like the Bible says just abide in
[56:04] him if you abide in him and his words
[56:05] abide in you then you can ask what you
[56:08] will and he'll do it for you why because
[56:10] he's anointing you amen right then he's
[56:13] revealed to you what the will of God is
[56:15] and that's what I'm trusting for tonight
[56:17] that all this anointing all the prayers
[56:19] I prayed all the the seeking God I've
[56:21] done I'm trusting that he'll anoint me
[56:23] to do his will to bring healing now I
[56:29] want to get back here now you sense a
[56:31] little bit more about proverbs 3 so I'm
[56:34] gonna go back to proverbs 3 verse 5 he
[56:40] says today we send our children to
[56:42] school to have understanding that after
[56:44] they are through the grammar schools we
[56:46] said in the high school for a better
[56:47] understanding of knowledge then after
[56:49] they're through there some children even
[56:51] fortune up to go to college so he caught
[56:52] it fortunate see some people say old
[56:55] programs that never go to college well
[56:56] he says they're fortunate to go you got
[56:59] to understand that he says or go through
[57:02] college to complete their education
[57:04] their understanding of knowledge many
[57:06] times to get a job you have to have at
[57:07] least a high school understanding or a
[57:09] college education and so forth yet
[57:11] though I Solomon told us not to lean to
[57:14] it not to our understanding lean not to
[57:16] these things because we wonder why that
[57:19] he would say such a thing is this first
[57:21] because that usually our modern
[57:23] understanding is usually the wisdom of
[57:25] man which is contrary to the Word of God
[57:27] I think that's what Solomon was trying
[57:30] to devise his sons not to be illiterate
[57:32] but to not lean to their understanding
[57:36] he said I think that's a good excerpt a
[57:38] ssin today if we said to our sons and to
[57:41] our sons and to the sons of God that
[57:43] it's alright to have an education
[57:45] there's nothing against that but when
[57:47] that education is contrary to the Word
[57:49] of God then lean to the word and let
[57:52] your education go glory lean to the word
[57:57] see because the word an education will
[57:59] stand and give you a good job probably
[58:01] get a good standing amongst intellectual
[58:02] people and that's alright which will
[58:05] probably be a great help to you help you
[58:07] in your financial your livelihood and
[58:09] make a living a little better for you
[58:12] amen
[58:13] I can see that my life you know my
[58:15] parents were factory worker when my dad
[58:17] was a factory worker my dad told me
[58:19] always go to college go to college son
[58:20] go to college son I'm the only one of my
[58:22] siblings that went to go I'm sorry not
[58:24] Paul did Paul and I got a degree and
[58:27] it's helped my livelihood it's helped me
[58:29] I have a little better living but I
[58:31] can't lean to that I've always gotta
[58:34] lean to the Word of God that's right now
[58:41] let's look at a few more Proverbs here
[58:48] all right if you got your
[58:50] now I want to bring a balance here
[58:51] brother branham's said there's a
[58:53] dishonouring proverb so I think I'll
[58:55] close with this thought I'll just go
[58:57] about 10 more minutes here let me close
[58:59] with this thought so we've heard some
[59:02] good proverbs tonight right like run
[59:04] into the tower the righteous run into it
[59:06] trust in the Lord with all your heart
[59:07] depart from all evil now brother Branham
[59:10] says here there's a dishonouring proverb
[59:13] he says like this let's go to proverbs
[59:20] 14:23 can you go to proverbs 14:23 okay
[59:33] proverbs 14:23 now let's look at this
[59:35] here in all labor there is what profit
[59:39] is it good to go to work brothers oh
[59:41] yeah God made you to work man that won't
[59:44] work shouldn't eat the Bible said but
[59:46] the talk of the lips tendeth only to
[59:48] penury so see people that talk and never
[59:50] really go to work
[59:51] that's just though that's a wasted life
[59:53] we don't want we want our actions to
[59:55] speak louder than our words now go to
[1:00:00] second Thessalonians Lydia 3:10 second
[1:00:02] Thessalonians 3:10 so brother Branham
[1:00:06] said there's a there's a dishonouring
[1:00:08] proverb out there and these scriptures
[1:00:12] help bouncing it out in other words
[1:00:14] we've got to do something we've got to
[1:00:16] work and do things but then God will
[1:00:19] work at times as well so second
[1:00:22] Thessalonians 3:10 for even when we were
[1:00:26] with you this we commanded you that if
[1:00:27] any would not work neither should he eat
[1:00:31] so I think it's clear can everybody see
[1:00:33] a Christian will work right a Christians
[1:00:36] not lazy
[1:00:38] no but the random is preaching here in
[1:00:44] 1953 about expectancy about how the Jews
[1:00:47] were waiting for their Messiah for all
[1:00:49] these years and yet they're under Roman
[1:00:51] rulership and it's man said it seemed
[1:00:53] like that the birth of Christ was so far
[1:00:55] away and yet Christ was born right there
[1:00:57] in the midst of that Roman rulership
[1:01:00] everybody who said that's the way it is
[1:01:03] tonight
[1:01:04] many of you here may seem like that your
[1:01:06] time of deliverance is way away
[1:01:08] anybody ever feel like don't raise your
[1:01:09] hand don't confess that but man says
[1:01:13] many of you feel like your deliverance
[1:01:15] is way far away it's never gonna get
[1:01:18] here that healings never gonna get here
[1:01:20] that that baptism of Holy Ghost will
[1:01:21] never get here or the salvation of my
[1:01:23] family will never get here or the
[1:01:25] rapture was just seems like it's so far
[1:01:27] away but have said but sometime when it
[1:01:31] seems the farthest away and the darkest
[1:01:34] of our that's when you receive help from
[1:01:37] God but have said there's an old God
[1:01:42] dishonouring proverb dishonouring so
[1:01:45] this is a discounting proverb that says
[1:01:47] God helps only those who help themselves
[1:01:51] right how many of her doubt before
[1:01:54] people say well God only helps those who
[1:01:56] help themselves get up do something now
[1:01:59] that's true to some extent right because
[1:02:02] if people are lazy and sit around saying
[1:02:04] okay God send me a job but they never go
[1:02:06] look for a job well shame on them well
[1:02:10] god only helps me I can't help myself I
[1:02:12] can't give myself a job that's true but
[1:02:14] you can go fill out some applications
[1:02:15] and get a job
[1:02:16] you can elite that's the way I've always
[1:02:19] found jobs come to me when I go out and
[1:02:21] put applications in right you can't sit
[1:02:25] around say God send me money and not go
[1:02:28] through the process which God allows you
[1:02:30] to get money because there's profit in
[1:02:32] all labor the Bible says so brahim says
[1:02:35] see it's an old dishonouring proverb to
[1:02:38] God he said that's an heir god helps
[1:02:41] those who can't help themselves now
[1:02:44] brother Aaron is dealing with the
[1:02:45] supernatural realm in the natural realm
[1:02:48] we should be able to work in order to
[1:02:50] help ourselves right but in the
[1:02:53] supernatural we cannot help ourselves
[1:02:57] and program corrects that thought see
[1:03:00] some people will take that naturally
[1:03:01] which naturally we should take that God
[1:03:05] only helps those who help themselves
[1:03:06] that's right
[1:03:07] you need to go get it try and get a job
[1:03:08] you need to work hard you need to go
[1:03:10] learn you need to go to school but in
[1:03:12] the supernatural realm we have no power
[1:03:14] or no ability even Jesus Christ said I
[1:03:17] can do nothing
[1:03:18] except first the father shows me first
[1:03:20] and if he needs the leadership of God
[1:03:23] how much more do we need the leadership
[1:03:24] of God amen
[1:03:26] mom oh I need his leadership tonight
[1:03:30] praise God program said God helps those
[1:03:33] who help themselves that's an error god
[1:03:35] helps those who can't help themselves if
[1:03:37] you can help yourself you wouldn't need
[1:03:39] God's help but God has mercy on those
[1:03:43] who cannot help himself a men hallelujah
[1:03:52] he said now I'm skipping ahead to a
[1:03:54] different sermon the power of God
[1:03:56] Satan's power is limited faith power
[1:04:00] brings to pass gods revealed revelation
[1:04:02] god helps those who cannot act and help
[1:04:05] themselves that's how I'm thinking about
[1:04:07] this little boy tonight they're laying
[1:04:09] in the hospital bed Akron Children's he
[1:04:11] cannot help himself so there's one
[1:04:13] person that can that's Jesus Christ but
[1:04:17] manases see the old dishonouring God
[1:04:19] proverb that said God helps those who
[1:04:21] helped himself he said how ridiculous
[1:04:23] god helps those who can't help
[1:04:25] themselves amen oh isn't he wonderful
[1:04:28] the power of God what does it the power
[1:04:31] of God's the only thing that can give
[1:04:33] eternal life the power of God is the
[1:04:35] only thing it's the power of God that
[1:04:37] built a tree all the science in the
[1:04:39] world can't build a tree God's power
[1:04:42] built the tree God's power
[1:04:44] he said keeps me alive amen if God calls
[1:04:49] for you or the hospital the oxygen tents
[1:04:52] the pole motors in the world can't keep
[1:04:54] you here salvation is of the Lord it's
[1:04:57] God's power that feeds the sparrow amen
[1:05:00] or it's God's power that speaks to the
[1:05:03] little duck up yonder there's nobody up
[1:05:05] there and that shoes them off the lake
[1:05:07] and said and say go down to Louisiana no
[1:05:09] sir it's God power that shoes them off
[1:05:12] the link the little fellow don't know
[1:05:14] which way to go it's God's power that
[1:05:16] directs him south hallelujah it's God's
[1:05:19] power that directs them to Jesus Christ
[1:05:22] it's God's power that brought the wise
[1:05:24] men to the cradle amen it's God's power
[1:05:27] that listen thrills the soul of every
[1:05:30] believer
[1:05:31] God's power to help those who cannot
[1:05:35] help themselves
[1:05:37] Jorge whatever God does a miracle it
[1:05:40] ought to thrill your soul it ought to
[1:05:42] thrill us when God heals or God saves or
[1:05:45] God does something miraculous it ought
[1:05:47] to thrill us because it wasn't us it was
[1:05:49] God that did it and God only hope helps
[1:05:53] those who cannot help themselves or
[1:05:57] glory perfection 1956 he said look at
[1:06:04] all these isms rising up in the world
[1:06:06] today look at these cults of this non
[1:06:08] meat-eating group and a legalist that
[1:06:11] says I've got to do this and so and so
[1:06:12] if I don't speak with tongues if I don't
[1:06:14] do this if I don't shout if I don't
[1:06:15] dance there's something wrong with me he
[1:06:17] said that's legalism we're saved by
[1:06:19] grace through faith it's nothing what
[1:06:21] you done it's what he did he did what
[1:06:24] you couldn't do if you could have saved
[1:06:26] yourself then he wouldn't have had to
[1:06:28] die but he died in order to save you
[1:06:31] where you could not save yourself that
[1:06:35] old he said old God dishonouring proverb
[1:06:38] that says God helps those who can't help
[1:06:41] themselves or god helps those who help
[1:06:44] themselves they say that's just vice
[1:06:45] versa if you can help yourself God
[1:06:48] expects you to do it see there it is if
[1:06:51] you can help yourself God expect you to
[1:06:53] do it if there's medicine and right
[1:06:56] there I'll cost on the counter and you
[1:06:58] can help yourself and take some medicine
[1:07:00] God expects you to do it right he said
[1:07:04] but God helps those who cannot help
[1:07:06] their self and you can't help yourself
[1:07:08] to be saved so God by His grace a view
[1:07:12] glory Emory another one
[1:07:20] I tuned the meal offering he's speaking
[1:07:22] of the back sitting condition of Israel
[1:07:24] in the time of Elijah he said there's an
[1:07:26] old proverb god this unerring proverb
[1:07:28] that says God helps those who help
[1:07:30] themselves
[1:07:31] that's dishonorable to God God helps
[1:07:34] those who cannot help themselves
[1:07:36] he's the God of those who needs mercy
[1:07:39] and he is a merciful God and that
[1:07:43] proverb that says he who helps he helps
[1:07:46] those who help themselves
[1:07:47] if you can help yourself you don't need
[1:07:49] his help but he helps those who cannot
[1:07:51] help themselves amen praise God do you
[1:07:57] like that yeah so I hope you can see
[1:08:02] that that's clear right there that if if
[1:08:05] you could help yourself God expects you
[1:08:07] to do it there's anything you can do
[1:08:09] that you can help yourself do it but
[1:08:12] it's only when you cannot help yourself
[1:08:13] that's when God is gonna help you praise
[1:08:17] the Lord and it's God's power that's
[1:08:20] gonna help you and it's always a gift of
[1:08:22] grace praise God
[1:08:27] now let's look at what a couple more
[1:08:29] things here before we close hallelujah
[1:08:39] now let's look at
[1:08:44] because of this thought here with work I
[1:08:48] wanted to close another thought from
[1:08:49] worth it works his faith expressed par
[1:08:51] me
[1:08:52] well Bram says your actions or works
[1:08:54] show you already have faith or do not
[1:08:57] have faith he says remember works is
[1:09:01] faith express works show that faith has
[1:09:04] already took a hold see works shows that
[1:09:09] faith has already took a hold see so if
[1:09:13] you believe that God is going to do
[1:09:14] something you got to act upon it you've
[1:09:16] got to talk about it
[1:09:17] you've got to confess it you've got to
[1:09:19] act on it and let everybody know that
[1:09:21] your faith is moving you to work and do
[1:09:24] something for God's kingdom that's right
[1:09:29] remember brother Brian tells us the
[1:09:31] balance between Paul and James remember
[1:09:33] James says you're saved by works paul
[1:09:36] says you're saved by faith abraham tells
[1:09:38] us the balance he says bow to men were
[1:09:41] talking on faith Paul justified Abraham
[1:09:44] by what God saw in Abraham but James
[1:09:47] justified Abraham by what man saw on
[1:09:49] Abraham Amen hallelujah so see all of us
[1:09:54] were the ones that we have to show each
[1:09:57] other our faith by our works we got to
[1:10:01] show it to you I've got to show my faith
[1:10:02] to you and I have to act upon what God's
[1:10:06] Word says and that's me showing my fate
[1:10:08] to you but that's that's what the Bible
[1:10:12] says that's what man sees but God sees
[1:10:14] that we already believe right God
[1:10:16] already sees that God sees our faith but
[1:10:19] then we got to act on it to prove it to
[1:10:20] everybody else because the Bible said
[1:10:22] make your calling and election sure
[1:10:24] praise God the Bible said prove all
[1:10:26] things amen if you believe gods are here
[1:10:29] if you believe God's our Savior if you
[1:10:31] believe God's in the the Great
[1:10:32] Commission then we've got to act upon
[1:10:34] what we believe and do something about
[1:10:36] it
[1:10:36] amen hallelujah remember Paul wrote what
[1:10:42] God saw James wrote what man saw an
[1:10:46] Abraham hallelujah works
[1:10:53] that faith has already took a hold I'm
[1:10:57] gonna closer this at Center feet let me
[1:10:58] close with this faith is a revelation I
[1:11:02] already read this one read again there's
[1:11:03] what I want to say it's revelation he
[1:11:06] revealed it to you by His grace it's
[1:11:08] nothing you did you didn't work yourself
[1:11:10] up into faith you ever have faith that's
[1:11:12] give to you by the grace of God amen
[1:11:16] it's given to you by the grace of God he
[1:11:23] said now I can't make you believe he
[1:11:24] said just keep believing it with all
[1:11:26] your heart until God does reveal it to
[1:11:28] you just keep believing it until God
[1:11:31] does reveal it are you encouraged by the
[1:11:33] word of God tonight amen let's stand
[1:11:37] here as we pray by the grace of the Lord
[1:11:43] now would like banging a little bit I'd
[1:11:46] like you to anoint me with oil I would
[1:11:47] like I want to stand in for the boy and
[1:11:49] then I want to go pray for him I want to
[1:11:52] stand in for him and I'd like everybody
[1:11:55] to pray for me as well before I go to
[1:11:58] pray for him I've got I've got the Word
[1:12:02] of God in my heart I know God can do it
[1:12:04] God heal my momma cancer right God
[1:12:07] healed that Kylie Rose girl we fasted
[1:12:09] and prayed for her now God used science
[1:12:10] to do it well at least we'll we think I
[1:12:13] guess what you're not really sure but
[1:12:16] she was gonna die too but God healed her
[1:12:18] she hasn't had cancer enough for a year
[1:12:20] and we've seen God do that by His grace
[1:12:24] his mercy Christopher stopped having
[1:12:26] seizures you know God did that and so
[1:12:30] we've got to believe we know God can do
[1:12:32] it and so we want to keep confessing not
[1:12:35] try to work ourselves up but just to
[1:12:36] rest and trust in the Lord with all our
[1:12:39] hearts and not lean to our understanding
[1:12:42] keep confessing what we knows the truth
[1:12:44] what the Bible says we'll lean just lean
[1:12:46] heavy on the Word of God just can I just
[1:12:49] give you a picture just lean on this
[1:12:50] just lean on it that's what I need I
[1:12:52] thought doing right now I'm just leaning
[1:12:54] upon the promise of God because I want
[1:12:57] to see God move I don't want to work
[1:12:59] myself up into it I just want God to
[1:13:01] reveal his word to me his will to all of
