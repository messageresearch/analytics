[0:00] and
[0:01] uh just that's what we want to do is is
[0:05] is we are aiming for the higher ground
[0:07] and and being in his presence is the
[0:11] higher ground so we want to be in his
[0:13] presence that's something that we should
[0:15] be looking for is the influence of the
[0:17] Holy Spirit uh every day day in day out
[0:21] amen so if you would turn with me to
[0:27] Isaiah in the sixth chapter and and
[0:30] sorry that my family has to hear it
[0:33] again
[0:34] but
[0:36] uh it seems like no matter how many
[0:39] times you you could preach the same
[0:40] thing it it doesn't come out the same
[0:42] way but uh we're just grateful to the
[0:46] Lord that he's kept us he gave us safe
[0:49] travels today and he's he's always
[0:51] faithful to see us through whatever
[0:54] we're going
[0:57] through Isaiah chapter 6 starting in the
[1:00] first
[1:11] verse somebody give the Lord
[1:14] Praise Your Name
[1:17] Lord so he says in the year that King
[1:20] Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting
[1:23] upon a
[1:25] throne high and lifted up and his train
[1:29] filled the temple as Angels
[1:32] following that his train filled the
[1:35] temple above above it stood the seraphim
[1:38] each one had six wings with Twain he
[1:40] covered his face and with Twain he
[1:42] covered his feet and with Twain he did
[1:45] fly so if you see where he covered his
[1:48] face and his feet it's showing
[1:50] humility so if if they do that how much
[1:55] more should we come in humility
[2:00] and with Twain he did fly so the the six
[2:02] wings I'm not going to speak on anything
[2:04] uh extremely mysterious uh today but uh
[2:08] and one Cried unto another and said holy
[2:11] holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole
[2:14] earth is full full of his glory so even
[2:18] they are coming with Worship in their
[2:20] mouths they are coming with praise in
[2:23] their mouths verse four he says and the
[2:25] posts of the door moved at the voice of
[2:27] him that cried and the house was filled
[2:30] with
[2:31] smoke then said I woe is me for I am
[2:34] undone because I am a man of unclean
[2:37] lips how many here would say the same
[2:39] thing I am a man of or woman of unclean
[2:42] lips but I really like this and I dwell
[2:46] in the midst of a people of unclean lips
[2:48] so not only himself but the people that
[2:50] he resided with so they were of people
[2:53] of of of like passions people of like
[2:56] mistakes so he says for mine eyes have
[3:00] seen the king the Lord of hosts but it's
[3:02] something about him seeing that King
[3:04] being in the presence of the king and he
[3:07] says uh so when you get into that
[3:10] presence you know you can't you can't
[3:12] lie to the Holy Spirit you can't uh uh
[3:15] uh try to scam you can't do any of those
[3:18] things but in the presence if you truly
[3:20] get in the presence of the Lord you
[3:22] can't help but confess things you can't
[3:24] help but confess uh and we that's way we
[3:27] want to be is we want to be true we want
[3:29] to have that heart that's that is honest
[3:32] and that is pure right so then he says
[3:34] then said I woe is me for I am undone
[3:38] why because he got in the presence of
[3:41] the Lord amen because I am a man of
[3:44] unclean lips and I
[3:46] dwell uh in the midst of a people of
[3:48] unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the
[3:51] king the Lord of hosts then flew one of
[3:53] the seraphim unto me having a live coal
[3:56] in his hand which a live coal is fire
[3:58] fire is a cleansing element amen and
[4:02] it'll burn those things out of us so
[4:05] having a live coal in his hand which he
[4:07] had taken with the tongues from off the
[4:10] Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and
[4:13] said Lo this hath touched thy lips and
[4:15] thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin
[4:19] is purged amen how many want to be in
[4:22] that condition this morning and not just
[4:24] this morning but every morning every
[4:27] morning his mercies are new and every
[4:29] morning morning we should have a praise
[4:30] coming off of our lips amen verse 8 he
[4:33] says also I heard the voice of the Lord
[4:35] saying whom shall I send and whom will
[4:38] go for us so he's asking a question who
[4:42] is willing who is willing to take this
[4:45] stand who is willing to come forth to
[4:48] have your mouth touched with the hot Cal
[4:50] to have your mouth your lips touched
[4:53] that's to have pure words coming out of
[4:57] your mouth no longer having unclean
[5:01] speech no longer saying evil things of
[5:04] some someone else no longer speaking
[5:07] negative
[5:09] confessions but he says whom shall I
[5:12] send and who will go for us I was
[5:14] talking to brother Malachi in the back
[5:15] here about you know sometimes I I still
[5:18] struggle I don't know why but Lord why
[5:21] have you chosen me surely there are men
[5:24] more qualified than myself and I was
[5:26] tell talking to somebody about this a
[5:28] little bit ago and then I can't remember
[5:30] if it was David but uh it was somebody
[5:33] who posed a question yeah but are they
[5:35] willing you know there are many people
[5:37] that are called but few are chosen and
[5:40] probably how many how much less are even
[5:43] willing amen that's right but I love
[5:45] Isaiah says here then said I here am I
[5:49] send me how many has that heart this
[5:53] morning Lord I want to do a work for you
[5:56] amen so it's not our work that we want
[5:59] to do but we want to go and fulfill his
[6:01] work let's bow our heads this morning
[6:04] Heavenly Father we just thank you out of
[6:06] the millions of people millions and
[6:08] billions of people on this Earth you
[6:10] have chosen us that we can come and Lord
[6:14] what a privilege it is to be able to
[6:16] speak the name of Jesus from our lips
[6:18] what a privilege it is to come into the
[6:20] house of the Lord to come and worship
[6:22] the one and true God father I just thank
[6:25] you so much for for what you've laid
[6:27] upon us that you've set before us and
[6:29] every provision uh that we have needed
[6:32] that you have met father Lord we thank
[6:34] you so much for your scripture that
[6:36] you've given unto us we thank you for
[6:38] opening our eyes Lord we might not
[6:40] understand all Mysteries we might not uh
[6:42] be a theologian but we want to thank you
[6:45] so much for what we do see we want to
[6:47] thank you for what we do understand for
[6:50] what it it might be a small amount of
[6:52] Revelation but Lord I want to take this
[6:54] time to thank you for that small bit of
[6:56] Revelation because there are so many
[6:58] people out in this world that cannot see
[7:01] truth and Lord what a privileged people
[7:03] we are to be able to stand in your
[7:05] presence and to be able to give praise
[7:07] off of our lips amen Lord we just thank
[7:10] you so much oh Lord be with us help us
[7:12] and guide us as we Minister your word
[7:14] may it be a blessing unto the people and
[7:16] may I get out of the way to let your
[7:18] spirit Speak Lord we don't want to
[7:20] depend on notes but Lord we want to
[7:22] depend on on your spirit coming and
[7:24] speaking with us this morning that we
[7:26] could all say that it surely was good to
[7:29] be in the house house of the Lord for
[7:30] Lord we want refreshment we want that
[7:32] renewing of your Holy Spirit to be upon
[7:34] us Lord we ask all these things all all
[7:37] your
[7:38] favors to be upon us oh God Lord we pray
[7:41] that you would be with brother Jesse as
[7:43] he's ministering out and about to to
[7:45] people they might be in another place
[7:47] but lord they're still part of the part
[7:49] of the body oh God we just pray that you
[7:51] would give them that influence that
[7:53] Godly influence to speak to them and to
[7:55] bring truth to them to lead them into
[7:57] truth and Lord we pray that you would be
[7:59] with brother Ronnie long also as he's
[8:01] ministering back at the home church and
[8:03] uh be with the our brothers and sisters
[8:05] there Lord we ask that you would be with
[8:07] the whole body around the whole world
[8:09] father Lord we ask that we would be led
[8:11] of your spirit in Jesus Christ's name we
[8:14] do ask it father amen and amen you may
[8:17] be
[8:24] seated I think any more I'm just finding
[8:27] finding a place of home I guess
[8:30] so I'm just going to make myself
[8:31] comfortable as if I'm at home so
[8:35] no
[8:36] so if if you've read the message and I'm
[8:39] and I'm I'm not going to try to be the
[8:42] type of person that's brother brandom
[8:44] this brother brandom that and uh I I try
[8:47] not to do that because it it it tends to
[8:49] wear out the the whole name of of
[8:52] brother brandham and and it just has the
[8:55] appeal to to those on the outside that
[8:59] we just look to a man and follow a
[9:02] cult but I think a lot of people don't
[9:06] understand the meaning of cult and its
[9:08] original meaning which uh before was not
[9:12] it did not had have a negative
[9:14] connotation to it but it had a positive
[9:17] it was just it it was a name of what
[9:19] they called a religious gathering but
[9:22] now they have put a negative connotation
[9:24] to it that it's it's an extreme follower
[9:27] of one person or thought or idea and
[9:30] that's what they label people as a cult
[9:33] but you know in in times past uh
[9:37] centuries ago it it was just a term for
[9:40] people that got together and was uh uh
[9:43] labeled I guess you could say as a
[9:45] religious group but if you think about
[9:47] it uh one that came from witchcraft when
[9:51] when people say cult my mind goes to the
[9:54] uh a group of wicked people GP a group
[9:58] of wicens getting together and that to
[10:00] me is cultish so when people refer to us
[10:04] as a cult uh it doesn't really hurt my
[10:07] feelings because I just feel that they
[10:09] don't know what they're talking about
[10:11] because something that they don't
[10:13] understand is what they call something
[10:16] negative you know so it uh we don't want
[10:20] to do that we want to speak nice things
[10:22] of people no matter how much they they
[10:24] might say uh evil things about us right
[10:28] so and what is is that is that us is
[10:30] that our nature no that is the holy
[10:33] spirit within that gives us that
[10:35] self-control to maintain our tongue and
[10:37] to say nice things brother brandom said
[10:40] you know when people were drawing him
[10:41] out what did he say I'm just going to
[10:43] draw the circle bigger and draw you back
[10:45] in so you know we we are members of one
[10:49] body there is one Lord one baptism right
[10:52] so there is one faith and that's where
[10:54] we want to come in unity right to come
[10:57] under that one Lord not under a a man
[11:00] the umbrella of a man I uh I was just
[11:03] preaching at at at home I uh last last
[11:06] week I I preached on the the topic and
[11:08] and it's a a profound question you know
[11:11] it was something so mysterious not
[11:13] really to uh but it was just a question
[11:16] are you a Christian and and that's uh
[11:20] maybe I should preach that this morning
[11:22] but but I I feel led to go another way I
[11:25] I pray that it's on On Target on goal
[11:27] but brother brandham used
[11:29] uh this scripture in Isaiah chapter
[11:32] 6 in the messages of
[11:35] influence
[11:37] so uh we have and and then he goes on to
[11:40] talk about how Uzziah was raised in a
[11:43] home of Godly Parents and that was a
[11:46] influence from the time he was born and
[11:48] the and the time that he was raised is
[11:51] that he was under a Godly influence
[11:54] so uh and then he went on to relate
[11:58] everything to uh like bad things of how
[12:01] kidss act uh young people how they act
[12:04] and he uh uh uh attributes that to
[12:07] juvenile delinquency and then he goes on
[12:09] to say I would say it's more parental
[12:12] delinquency because they're not putting
[12:14] that influence there to their children
[12:17] when they first get it because what does
[12:18] the scripture say treat or raise up a
[12:20] child and the way he should go and when
[12:21] he is older he shall not depart from it
[12:23] right so we want to establish that
[12:26] influence from a very young age so
[12:30] uh what I'd like to speak on this
[12:31] morning is influence so but there's a
[12:35] Twist to this influence is destruction
[12:39] by false
[12:41] witness but see uh when he goes on to
[12:43] say that it's juvenile delinquency
[12:46] parental uh delinquency I think it's
[12:49] more of a character
[12:52] deficiency right so uh we want a good
[12:56] influence in our lives right that that's
[12:58] what we want
[13:00] is that something that we always get no
[13:04] because we have a a like he was talking
[13:07] about Uzziah being raised up having
[13:09] Godly Parents that's an ideal situation
[13:11] but it's not always the case you know I
[13:15] I I was baptized Catholic don't you know
[13:18] don't don't don't judge me on anything I
[13:20] was baptized Catholic my parents bust me
[13:23] off to a Baptist Sunday school okay and
[13:26] then when I grew up I went to the United
[13:28] Methodist Church so you know just
[13:30] because I went to church did not mean
[13:32] that I had an experience with the Lord
[13:35] that's right and even as I uh uh as a
[13:38] young teenager I held a a a spot uh I
[13:42] don't know how I don't know why it was
[13:44] probably by default because nobody else
[13:46] wanted to do it but a leader in the in
[13:48] the youth group and I still did evil in
[13:51] the sight of the Lord on so just because
[13:54] you go to church doesn't make you a
[13:56] Christian You go Okay so I'm probably
[13:59] going to combine a couple couple
[14:01] messages here but you know we'll just
[14:03] let the Lord lead as as as as I want to
[14:06] follow the lord as he leads amen so what
[14:09] is
[14:11] influence influence is the power or
[14:14] capacity of causing an effect and
[14:17] indirect so it could be something that
[14:20] you're around
[14:21] indirectly subconsciously hearing
[14:23] commercials subconsciously hearing
[14:25] things on the radio eavesdropping not
[14:28] meaning to
[14:29] uh hearing other people's
[14:31] conversations so that's
[14:34] indirectly okay so the power capacity of
[14:37] causing an effect in indirect or
[14:39] intangible ways meaning to sway
[14:42] people you ever come across somebody uh
[14:45] we were just talking about this Bible
[14:47] study you ever come across somebody they
[14:49] are so nice they are so respectful that
[14:51] it just demands a respect they don't say
[14:54] hey you need to respect me but just the
[14:56] way that they carry themselves the way
[14:58] that they treat you you just feel that
[15:01] you can't do anything but give them
[15:03] respect right so then in that kind of a
[15:06] way that is an indirect influence they
[15:10] can sway you in a good way or a bad way
[15:13] because there are some individuals out
[15:15] there that could do the very opposite
[15:18] they can have an influence negatively
[15:20] and you don't even realize that they're
[15:22] influencing you in that negative fashion
[15:25] right so it could be a a a a negative
[15:28] word here a negative word there and then
[15:31] it and then all of a sudden you wonder
[15:33] you get home and you wonder why you're
[15:34] doubting yourself you get home and you
[15:36] wonder why you're doubting the word am I
[15:38] even a Christian do I even have the Holy
[15:41] Spirit it's because you're you're with
[15:44] something you're in the midst you're in
[15:46] the atmosphere of some kind of an
[15:48] indirect
[15:50] influence and so much more of how we
[15:53] need to be prayed up you know Ephesians
[15:55] 6 uh I was thinking of of of of of
[15:57] brother amen this morning he's not here
[16:00] but uh and I don't know why I wasn't
[16:01] going to say that out loud but Lord Lord
[16:04] be with brother amen but uh I wish he
[16:06] was here because I wanted to talk to him
[16:08] but
[16:09] uh
[16:11] so having the E Ephesians 6 talks about
[16:14] taking on the whole armor of God and why
[16:17] what was the purpose of taking on that
[16:19] armor to withstand the Ws of the devil
[16:23] what are WS WS are
[16:26] tricks
[16:27] indirect
[16:29] influence okay some of it is is forceful
[16:33] some of it's going to come directly
[16:34] right at you so we we need to be
[16:37] prepared for those things another part
[16:38] of influence the act or power of
[16:40] producing an effect without apparent
[16:42] exertion of force or direct exercise of
[16:45] command a corrupt interference with
[16:48] authority for personal gain so some
[16:51] people will use influence because they
[16:54] have the spirit of malice and they are
[16:56] trying to direct you and influence you
[16:58] to the way of their thinking amen so we
[17:02] we also know this as a little leaven
[17:04] leth the whole L right so that that's
[17:07] pretty much influence in a nutshell and
[17:10] we can we can agree and understand with
[17:11] that right so uh
[17:14] what when does a change take place in a
[17:18] person's life if you read through the
[17:20] scripture they heard the word right this
[17:23] is a process of faith we have to hear
[17:25] the word you have to receive it
[17:29] so one you have to hear it two you have
[17:31] to receive it amen and then you just
[17:33] leave it dormant you just leave it lay
[17:36] there but you must act upon it so the
[17:40] same way with influence we hear the
[17:42] influence but do we receive that
[17:44] influence and how do we react and
[17:47] respond to that influence right so what
[17:50] a what a bad influence can do is
[17:52] Proverbs chapter 25:
[17:54] 18 it says a man that beareth false
[17:58] witness against his neighbor is a Maul
[18:01] and a sword and a sharp arrow all of
[18:04] these are instruments of war all of
[18:07] these are instruments of killing people
[18:11] okay so we understand that if you kill a
[18:13] man's influence that you could kill a
[18:15] man right there and be just as guilty as
[18:17] if you don't pick up a weapon and Pierce
[18:19] them through right so these are weapons
[18:22] so he's saying a man that beareth false
[18:23] witness against his neighbor and why do
[18:25] people bear false witness for an
[18:28] influence or self
[18:30] gain it's selfishness is what it is
[18:33] bearing false witness because out of
[18:35] Envy just like Cain of how he slew his
[18:38] brother Abel he was envious right and
[18:41] that's where a lot of this stuff is
[18:42] rooted right is because somebody else
[18:45] gained something that they didn't so
[18:47] then now they have to like use a mul and
[18:50] chop them down by whatever means
[18:51] necessary they have to use a sword to
[18:54] cut their influence down they have to
[18:55] use an arrow to pierce through the heart
[18:57] to take them out
[18:59] wow that is the that is the danger and
[19:02] the power of false false witness bearing
[19:05] false witness right bear false
[19:08] accusation is bearing false witness can
[19:10] we agree with that so uh uh uh uh so if
[19:14] we look at Ephesians 5 CH uh uh Chapter
[19:17] 5 Verse 6 and and and seven this is a
[19:20] way to avoid that right so when we see a
[19:25] problem we have to see a way out we
[19:27] can't just we can't just be there and
[19:29] say hey this is a problem this is a
[19:31] problem this is a problem okay we we say
[19:34] that we have a problem but what's the
[19:35] way
[19:37] out and it just leaves people okay
[19:40] there's a problem what next so Ephesians
[19:43] chapter 5 verse 6 and 7 he says let no
[19:45] man deceive you with vain words for
[19:48] because of these things cometh the wrath
[19:50] of God upon the children of Disobedience
[19:53] why because it's very it's a very
[19:56] separation God hates the the the the uh
[20:00] uh uh division amongst Brethren amen
[20:03] right it's one of the one of the six
[20:05] things one of the seven things that that
[20:06] the Lord does hate is setting
[20:09] division not not necessarily separating
[20:12] from unbelief you you understand the
[20:14] difference but causing a separation
[20:16] causing division amongst Brethren that's
[20:19] what he hates so uh and that's why his
[20:22] wrath wrath comes upon the children of
[20:24] Disobedience so he says be not ye
[20:26] therefore partakers with them
[20:29] so just shun the very appearance of evil
[20:31] step away from those things you could
[20:33] see that spirit is there light can't
[20:35] fellowship with Darkness so when you see
[20:37] that Darkness you got to step away from
[20:38] that right even if it means that you're
[20:41] going to lose a friend right right amen
[20:45] so we must put ourselves in the good
[20:47] good influence First Peter chapter 2 I'm
[20:49] just going to go through some scriptures
[20:50] here if if if that's all right
[20:53] so which I know I'm I'm home so I know
[20:56] it's okay right y'all love me I love
[21:00] y'all I appreciate y'all so 1 Peter
[21:02] chapter 2: 11 it says dearly beloved I
[21:05] beseech you a strangers and pilgrims
[21:07] abstained from fleshly lust which war
[21:11] against the
[21:13] soul the fleshly lust it's going to war
[21:16] against your soul because this the flesh
[21:18] wants to give into these things be
[21:20] because it's pleasure it's a moment of
[21:23] pleasure if I give into this I'll be
[21:26] satisfied but rest assur that satisfac
[21:28] action is for a moment that's right amen
[21:31] sorry I'm not pointing at at just you
[21:33] I'm just
[21:35] pointing but verse 12 he says having
[21:37] your conversation honest among the
[21:40] Gentiles that whereas they speak against
[21:43] you as evildoers why because you're
[21:45] doing good but they speak against you as
[21:48] evildoers that they that uh uh they may
[21:51] by your good works which they Shall
[21:54] Behold because we have written Epistles
[21:56] read of all men they're going to be able
[21:57] to see it they going to see the kind of
[21:59] life that we live so that's how they're
[22:01] going to see so which they Shall Behold
[22:03] your good works is what they're going to
[22:05] behold glorify God in the day of
[22:08] visitation so if you kind of break that
[22:10] that that that sentence a little bit
[22:12] here he says if if you take away some of
[22:15] the punctuation he says having your
[22:18] conversation honest among the Gentiles
[22:20] we just we won't continue uh from there
[22:23] except Until the End glorify God in the
[22:27] day of visitation so having our
[22:29] conversation honest amongst one another
[22:32] right we glorify God in the day of
[22:35] visitation amen now we could put the
[22:37] rest of it in there because they're
[22:39] going to speak evil against you right
[22:42] they're going to they're going to call
[22:43] you evildoers by doing honest work amen
[22:47] for the
[22:48] Lord and then it says that and how are
[22:51] they going to why are they going to call
[22:52] you how what's going to make them call
[22:54] you that it's because of your good works
[22:58] amen
[22:58] which they shall see you performing
[23:02] because you're going to be in that
[23:03] atmosphere amen but we want to be that
[23:06] influence on them we don't want them to
[23:08] have the influence upon us right so
[23:11] First Peter chapter 3 goes right along
[23:14] with what he's saying in in in the
[23:15] previous
[23:17] chapter starting at verse 12 he says for
[23:20] the eyes of the Lord are over the
[23:21] righteous and we could thank the Lord
[23:23] for that that his eyes are over us not
[23:26] that we are righteous because even on
[23:28] our best day our righteousness is as
[23:31] filthy rags amen it's still not good
[23:33] enough so for the eyes of the Lord are
[23:35] over the righteous and his ears are open
[23:37] unto their prayers how we could Rejoice
[23:40] to know that his ears are open to our
[23:42] cry that his ears are open unto what we
[23:45] have need of Amen that his ears are open
[23:49] unto our prayers but the face of the
[23:51] Lord is against them that do evil right
[23:55] right so in verse 13 and who is he that
[23:58] will harm you if ye be followers of that
[24:01] which is
[24:02] good see you're trying to do good but
[24:05] there's still that evil present no
[24:07] wonder Paul could say that I think it
[24:09] was Paul correct me correct me
[24:11] afterwards if I'm wrong the brother I'll
[24:13] just say the brother because I find
[24:14] myself in trouble because I have the
[24:16] wrong name uh anymore but the brother
[24:19] said that whenever I do good evil is
[24:21] present with me so we understand that
[24:24] evil is still in our midst so that's
[24:27] where the rejection has to come we have
[24:29] to reject that indirect influence that's
[24:34] so he says uh uh uh but and if you
[24:37] suffer for righteousness sake happy are
[24:40] ye happy are we that we could suffer for
[24:42] his you the the disciples were so happy
[24:46] because they counted themselves worthy
[24:48] to suffer for the Lord amen so happy are
[24:52] ye and be not afraid of their Terror
[24:54] neither be troubled but sanctify the
[24:57] Lord God where
[24:58] in your hearts because where uh uh uh as
[25:02] a man thinketh in his heart so is he so
[25:05] we want to protect that right so we want
[25:08] to uh uh uh we want to have that
[25:10] positive influence so but sanctify the
[25:13] Lord God in your hearts and be ready
[25:15] always to give an answer to every man
[25:17] that askthe a reason of the hope that is
[25:19] in you with meekness and fear see how
[25:22] embarrassing and how humiliating it is
[25:25] when somebody will come and ask you well
[25:27] why why are you a Christian Christian
[25:29] come on well I don't know uh my my my
[25:32] mom was my grandma was and and uh they
[25:35] had me to go to church so I guess I'm a
[25:37] Christian too that's not where it is
[25:39] that's right that's right that's not
[25:42] where it
[25:43] is it is where you have your influence
[25:46] to where you could say I was there when
[25:48] the spirit came so you can sing that
[25:50] song with the rest of the Saints I was
[25:52] there when the spirit came I was there
[25:55] because I partook of it
[25:58] well what changed
[26:00] you the spirit of the Lord changed
[26:03] that's right I was there when the spirit
[26:05] came and then what happened oh you might
[26:08] as well just have a seat you can sit
[26:10] down if you can but let me tell you of
[26:12] the glory of what the Lord has done for
[26:13] me because I was there when the spirit
[26:16] came the spirit moved but I had to
[26:18] accept it I had to recognize it as the
[26:20] word then I had to receive it then I
[26:22] could put it into action now see if you
[26:25] try to explain what you believe and you
[26:27] have no Revel
[26:29] it's just spewing out what somebody else
[26:31] told you but it has to become real to
[26:34] each and every one of us right it has to
[26:36] be a revelation to us now we can explain
[26:39] to somebody of the joy that we have in
[26:42] our
[26:43] lives the hope of glory we can't explain
[26:47] it if we haven't had the
[26:49] experience right and it's so much
[26:51] different the way the sister here can
[26:54] can explain it from the way that I can
[26:56] explain it from the way brother Jesse
[26:57] can explain it it that it might be a
[26:59] similar experience but they might
[27:02] explain it in different ways he might be
[27:04] able to reach somebody that she can't
[27:06] she might be able to reach somebody that
[27:07] he can't see we must be able to answer
[27:12] having a good conscience answer when a
[27:14] man asks us that's right of how you have
[27:17] the joy on the
[27:19] inside we're not trying to uh uh deceive
[27:23] anybody we're just giving the truth of
[27:25] what happened because I was there when
[27:27] it happened
[27:28] you're going to try and tell me it
[27:30] doesn't it doesn't work that way baloney
[27:32] I've done experience that one you're
[27:35] going to tell me that God can't heal I
[27:37] see experience right there you're done
[27:39] too late to see because I've already
[27:42] seen it I've seen it time and time
[27:44] again that the doctors were even kind of
[27:47] confused well I saw the the degeneration
[27:50] in your hip I I we see the process but
[27:54] your body must have healed itself yeah a
[27:56] word body healed it because a word body
[27:59] prayed for it
[28:01] amen a word body had faith for it what
[28:05] makes a a young teenage girl to receive
[28:08] her hearing one that was born deaf how
[28:11] what makes a a a a girl like that to
[28:13] receive her hearing in the middle of a
[28:17] service it's the move of God and when
[28:20] people are trying to say it's not true
[28:22] you're done too late why don't you come
[28:24] and taste and see the real happenings
[28:26] you try to say that we're in a cult let
[28:28] me show you the truth
[28:31] amen see God isn't going to work with
[28:33] those and you read it in the scripture
[28:34] where the Pharisees and Sadducees or
[28:36] somebody else is saying we know that God
[28:38] is working through this person because
[28:40] he won't work through a sinner amen he
[28:43] won't work those kind of Miracles
[28:44] through a sinner amen that's good amen
[28:47] yeah I know you can retort that well
[28:48] gifts and callings are without
[28:49] repentance I know you could do that but
[28:51] the Lord isn't going to give those
[28:52] miracles to to just anybody right right
[28:56] and we understand brother brandham did
[28:58] he was not the Healer amen right I am
[29:01] not a Healer brother sister you are not
[29:03] the healers but we know that there was
[29:04] one that is the Healer amen and when we
[29:06] get into that presence and when we meet
[29:08] that re uh uh uh requirement right is to
[29:12] seek him and not some other God that's
[29:14] right not some other
[29:16] entity right but when we seek Him in
[29:20] spirit and in truth
[29:23] amen where was
[29:25] I having a good conscience
[29:28] that whereas they speak evil of you as
[29:30] evildoers even while you are doing good
[29:34] deeds they may be ashamed that falsely
[29:36] accuse your good conversation and
[29:39] conversation there means behavior that
[29:41] that they falsely accuse your good
[29:44] conversation or good behavior in Christ
[29:48] they will falsely accuse
[29:51] you if you haven't been so yet you just
[29:54] wait it's probably coming it's probably
[29:56] right around the corner but rest ass
[29:58] sure you better have that that that
[30:00] Armor of God be prayed up amen this is a
[30:03] spiritual warfare that we're in verse 17
[30:06] for it is better if the will of God be
[30:08] so that ye suffer for well-doing don't
[30:11] suffer for the wrongdoing amen we want
[30:14] to suffer for doing good yes yes because
[30:18] that's the end of the scripture there uh
[30:20] uh uh that you that you suffer for
[30:22] well-doing than for evildoing I want to
[30:24] suffer by doing good good deeds good
[30:27] works
[30:28] not going out stealing not being a
[30:30] murderer not being a a rider I don't
[30:33] want to suffer for those things but I
[30:35] want to suffer for the good
[30:37] works I want to hear that statement
[30:39] enter into the joys of of of thy
[30:42] salvation amen enter the joys of the
[30:44] lord well done thou good and faithful
[30:47] servant that's what I want to hear yes
[30:50] oh you just need a pat on the back from
[30:52] my Lord and Savior yes I do amen yes I
[30:55] do because Praise of man is vain yes yes
[31:00] it is amen but false accusations have
[31:04] caused so many problems and and and has
[31:07] damaged so many lives and innocent
[31:09] people's lives right so first Peter 4:14
[31:13] it says if you be reproached for the
[31:14] name of Christ happy are ye for the
[31:16] spirit of
[31:18] glory and of God resteth upon you on
[31:23] their part he is evil spoken of on their
[31:28] part he is evil spoken of so see you're
[31:30] going to suffer for doing his
[31:34] works on on their part he is evil spoken
[31:38] of but on your part we glorify God on
[31:42] our part he is
[31:44] glorified because that's the influence
[31:46] that we carry because that's the spirit
[31:49] that we carry amen so why is influence
[31:51] so important I'm way behind in this so
[31:54] y'all are okay with that right you know
[31:56] me by now I know know you by
[31:59] now so influence is
[32:03] attained by how by having credibility
[32:07] you're not going to entertain somebody's
[32:09] influence unless they have some kind of
[32:11] credibility right so you're not going to
[32:15] willingly give up your money unless you
[32:17] know somebody credible right unless
[32:20] you're deceived right that's what these
[32:24] scammers are out there is they're
[32:25] deceiving people out of their money
[32:29] I don't want their money I want them to
[32:32] surrender their life to Jesus Christ I
[32:35] don't want their money they can keep
[32:38] their
[32:40] money but influence is attained by
[32:43] having credibility those around you have
[32:45] trust in you right now I'm talking about
[32:47] you as the believer so how are you going
[32:50] to have a good influence you must be
[32:53] credible how are you going to be
[32:55] credible by showing forth the good work
[32:58] works of the Lord right that's good by
[33:00] the fruits that we bear they're going to
[33:02] see who we
[33:04] serve not all influence is good some
[33:07] people just have the Knack to talk
[33:08] people into doing things some people
[33:10] just have that kind of an
[33:13] influence how'd you buy that car I don't
[33:16] know the guy was talking and all of a
[33:18] sudden I shelled out money I don't even
[33:20] need
[33:22] it he just told me I really needed this
[33:26] car see there's people out there that
[33:28] could really easily sway
[33:31] somebody I didn't need another house
[33:33] well how'd you end up with another one
[33:35] it was a really good
[33:36] deal do you realize what he took you
[33:40] for
[33:42] Slickers fast talkers yeah gainsayers is
[33:46] what they're called in the scripture
[33:47] that's right men Pleasers there you go
[33:51] on that's not so with a Believer amen am
[33:55] see it's important for leaders to have a
[33:57] characteristic of influence our
[33:59] influence needs to be without
[34:00] manipulation right we're not trying to
[34:03] manipulate people
[34:05] right it needs to be without elaborate
[34:08] schemes we're not trying to scam
[34:11] people we're trying to show truth right
[34:15] so we're not we're not trying to uh our
[34:18] influence needs to be without other
[34:20] forms of deceitfulness or coercion right
[34:24] like I said we are not trying to scam
[34:26] people we're trying we are leaders
[34:28] trying to lead souls to Christ that's
[34:31] right that's we are trying to lead the
[34:34] Lost
[34:37] amen
[34:39] but good influence is understanding how
[34:41] to work with and through others to
[34:44] achieve a stated objective while staying
[34:46] true to your core values and maintaining
[34:49] your integrity wow that's good see
[34:52] people want to work with you because
[34:53] they respect you see if you go to a job
[34:57] it's hard to work with some people but
[34:59] if
[35:03] we let's see how did this to work
[35:06] through work with people good influence
[35:09] is understanding how to work with and
[35:11] through others if you go to a job like I
[35:13] was saying if it's hard to work with
[35:15] some of those people but if you work
[35:17] with them and through
[35:20] them without compromising your stance
[35:23] amen showing yourself approved of this
[35:27] gospel right by doing the good works you
[35:30] still have to work with people that's
[35:32] true right some people just can't work
[35:34] with other people we understand that you
[35:37] know live peaceably among men as much as
[35:39] with is within you you do the best that
[35:41] you can so when you can have that
[35:44] influence that you still work with those
[35:46] that are undesirable and you work with
[35:48] them you work through them to attain an
[35:50] objective right to get the job done
[35:53] right you are using a Godly influence to
[35:56] get the job done that's right no matter
[35:59] what you feel about them no matter how
[36:01] hard it is you're still working with
[36:03] them that's how we have that Godly
[36:06] influence by not allowing their
[36:08] influence to come upon us that we
[36:10] compromise everything that we believe in
[36:13] right so the Lord told Brother brandham
[36:16] I I know here we go that's why I was
[36:18] that's why I said what I said at the
[36:19] beginning the Lord told brother brandham
[36:21] if you could get the people to believe
[36:23] if you can influence them of who they
[36:26] are and what they can
[36:28] attain if you can get them to
[36:31] believe not coer them not scam
[36:36] them but if you can influence them if
[36:38] you can get the people to believe that
[36:40] not even cancer will stand in the way
[36:43] amen well he say well that's
[36:45] motivational
[36:48] speaking how many times did it happen
[36:51] back
[36:51] then it seemed to be a habitual thing
[36:55] being in the presence of the Lord right
[36:58] it happens to be an issue of the
[37:01] presence of the Lord because when people
[37:02] get into that presence they addict
[37:04] themselves to the presence of the Lord
[37:07] amen because there's something about
[37:10] being in that presence there is Liberty
[37:13] in that presence there's Deliverance in
[37:16] that presence there is healing in that
[37:19] presence there is Faith buildup in that
[37:22] presence
[37:23] right so the Lord Tau him if you could
[37:26] get the people to to believe if we could
[37:28] get the people to
[37:30] believe then what is going to stand in
[37:32] the way not even cancer that's but we
[37:37] allow other things to get in the
[37:41] way or we might not know how to answer
[37:44] when we are
[37:49] asked but you know they might say oh
[37:51] that's just motivational speaking oh
[37:53] that's just to make people feel good
[37:55] that's a Feelgood religion you better
[37:57] believe it it feels
[38:01] good it sure feels good when burdens
[38:04] just get lifted it sure feels good when
[38:08] knees are healed and and somebody who is
[38:10] who is lame can jump up and run it sure
[38:14] feels good amen and I long to feel good
[38:19] amen but you know I want to tell you I
[38:23] don't care what they
[38:25] say they're not my infuence yes amen
[38:32] right they're not credible to me when
[38:36] all they have their argument is to
[38:38] criticize the good
[38:41] works isn't it real the scripture came
[38:44] real before you because we're doing the
[38:46] good works and then they're evil
[38:48] speaking evil of
[38:49] it why because they think that you're a
[38:53] cult wow and you know where it lies
[38:58] is because you go above and beyond the
[39:00] standards
[39:02] amen you maintain high standards they
[39:05] don't want to amen so they can't bring
[39:09] themselves subject unto it wow that is
[39:11] good
[39:12] amen so if they can't meet the standards
[39:15] oh you're eccentric oh you're extremist
[39:19] oh you are a
[39:21] cult like I said I don't care what they
[39:24] say because we will suffer for doing the
[39:26] good works if they can't call us brother
[39:28] and sister then something is wrong with
[39:29] their Spirit right amen because our goal
[39:33] our initiative our directive is to bring
[39:37] people to Christ and if they think that
[39:40] we have some other directive some other
[39:42] agenda then they are wrong they are
[39:44] reading into something that doesn't
[39:45] belong they are reading into something
[39:47] that doesn't exist amen yep I know this
[39:51] is being recorded right so if you turned
[39:53] it on it's being recorded if it's not
[39:55] then
[39:57] but I don't care what they say it's just
[39:59] another it's a
[40:01] cloudthree so just because they have
[40:04] words that come against a Believer
[40:06] doesn't make them true that's right
[40:09] there you go that's right it doesn't
[40:10] make it true it's just empty words it's
[40:13] empty criticism so don't fear it don't
[40:16] worry about it don't let it bring you
[40:18] down but you could be happy in it
[40:20] because you're suffering for the Lord
[40:22] for doing good
[40:24] works we know Salvation isn't attained
[40:27] by by works right it's attained by Grace
[40:31] yes and we do the good works through our
[40:34] faith yes we didn't get there because of
[40:37] our good works we do the good works
[40:40] because of what he's done in us that's
[40:42] right right because the spirit has done
[40:44] a good work in us we return the same
[40:48] because if it's the same Spirit we will
[40:50] do Spirit work we will do Lord Jesus
[40:53] work if it's Lord Jesus on the inside we
[40:56] will do Lord Jesus work
[40:58] amen what is it John 14:12 these same
[41:01] works that I do shall you do also and
[41:03] Greater Works than these shall you do
[41:05] right and we understand that to be more
[41:07] not better not not not more in
[41:11] quality not a better
[41:16] quality One Faith one Lord one baptism
[41:20] right amen oh one God
[41:29] we are not polytheistic Believers right
[41:32] we are not polytheists we're monotheists
[41:34] for those that that that might confuse
[41:36] we believe in one God we serve one God
[41:39] we don't serve many gods
[41:41] amen now that gets in a whole
[41:43] trinitarian thing you know if you
[41:45] worship three Gods you worship three
[41:46] Gods but I worship one God I worship one
[41:53] God but we see like I said I don't care
[41:56] what they have to to say because they're
[41:58] not credible they're not true Witnesses
[42:01] right see we want to hear the testimony
[42:04] of a true witness somebody who's
[42:07] actually seen somebody who's actually
[42:09] heard somebody that's actually had
[42:11] experience if if somebody that that
[42:14] comes criticizing that has never
[42:16] experienced any of that then how
[42:18] credible are they to say oh this word
[42:20] isn't
[42:22] true come and dine the master
[42:25] calleth come and taste taste and see
[42:28] come and
[42:29] see but see the problem is is people
[42:31] will come and see but they have a
[42:33] critical spirit the whole time so they
[42:35] want to be blinded the whole time so
[42:37] they won't see anything the whole
[42:41] time well I'm not going to let myself be
[42:43] deceived in there but you wanted to see
[42:45] truth and you're blinding yourself
[42:47] because you won't open up to it no
[42:50] wonder oh what was it the the Lord
[42:52] couldn't do many Works in their midst
[42:54] because of their unbelief that's right
[42:57] right because of their unbelief yes but
[43:01] see people have it in their heart their
[43:02] hearts are are protected and hardened
[43:04] because they've been hurt
[43:07] before and that's where it's hard to
[43:09] have a tender heart to just open it up
[43:12] to anybody brother AAR you're you're
[43:14] probably the closest one that I know
[43:16] that come out of of the world so do I'm
[43:20] sure you probably experienced those
[43:21] things to where it was hard to come out
[43:23] and to let yourself let to open your
[43:25] heart to be wounded again to make
[43:26] yourself s vulnerable again because
[43:30] somebody somebody that I don't know your
[43:32] life but somebody that uh this is where
[43:35] it usually is is somebody that they
[43:36] trusted hurt them somehow right so they
[43:40] develop a Heart of Stone but until they
[43:43] see the real that's where I was at amen
[43:46] but until I saw the
[43:48] real you know they didn't love me to
[43:50] death they love me to
[43:52] life you know we use those I'm about to
[43:55] thirst of death I did this to death I
[43:58] did this to death but they loved me to
[44:00] life amen they they didn't love me to
[44:02] death they loved me to life
[44:04] amen but you've already seen what the
[44:07] Lord has done to build your faith you've
[44:08] already seen
[44:10] it so I don't have to try to influence
[44:12] you but sometimes we just get down
[44:14] because we have a negative influence
[44:17] that kind of obscures our vision
[44:19] obscures our memory of What the Lord Has
[44:22] Done but just remember through the
[44:24] scripture I will not forget all of his
[44:27] benefits I will not forget my Lord that
[44:30] has delivered me and I'm way out but I'm
[44:33] not way out as far as loss but I'm way
[44:35] off my notes is what I'm what I'm
[44:37] referring to but doesn't the scripture
[44:39] tell us to be zealous of what good works
[44:43] amen we should be excited to do the good
[44:45] works we should be excited to be
[44:52] honest we should be
[44:55] excited to love somebody that's
[45:00] unlovable that's a hard
[45:02] one oh let me hit home
[45:05] again we should be excited to forgive
[45:10] amen my brother
[45:14] ourselves because sometimes it's easy to
[45:16] forgive somebody else but it's hard to
[45:18] forgive ourselves we look at the dark
[45:21] the dark things that we've done in the
[45:22] past well the Lord can't use me the Lord
[45:25] won't he won't like the likes of me
[45:27] oh yes he will you can't go so far where
[45:31] the hand of God can't reach you if
[45:32] you've never blasphemed the Holy Ghost
[45:35] There's Hope what do you mean there's
[45:37] hope is there breath still in your body
[45:39] Hallelujah there's still hope now see
[45:42] what people forget and what people don't
[45:44] understand is that we have an advocate
[45:45] with the
[45:46] father but I'm So Far Away I've done
[45:49] this I've done
[45:50] that bring it to the altar amen and
[45:54] leave it there not to pick it up again
[45:57] you've got to leave it there that's
[45:58] right leave it there leave it there
[46:02] bring your
[46:05] burdens and leave it
[46:07] there that's where people struggle they
[46:10] want to take it up again they want to
[46:11] take that same Spirit no got to leave it
[46:15] there right but you know when I know and
[46:18] and I was a young believer at the time
[46:21] and many of you know brother Frank
[46:23] Crosman but I happen to tell him one
[46:25] time because it it dawned on me or my
[46:29] eyes were opened up to it that when I
[46:31] prayed about something and I thought
[46:33] about it all the time it just seemed
[46:35] like either forever or it didn't come
[46:39] but when I forgot about
[46:41] it I told him you know it seems like
[46:44] every time I forget about what I prayed
[46:46] for it comes to pass you ever hear the
[46:50] maybe it's an old wi still I don't know
[46:51] an old adage a watch pot never boils
[46:57] so if you put it in prayer and forget
[46:59] about it what am I saying forget
[47:03] completely forget what I'm saying is in
[47:05] that forget is we are putting in in the
[47:08] trust of the lord we are trusting the
[47:11] Lord with it we don't have to be
[47:13] burdened by it
[47:14] anymore
[47:19] amen everybody know what a tail Bearer
[47:23] is it's one who tells stories right well
[47:27] I think in the scripture is telling uh
[47:29] uh telling things that influence
[47:30] people's thoughts and ideas about a
[47:32] thing or a
[47:33] person a tail Bearer it's one I think
[47:37] the allude it alludes to somebody who's
[47:40] bringing telling false things about
[47:42] somebody a tail Bearer they're bringing
[47:44] false accusation and we and we're no
[47:47] stranger to it we've read it in the
[47:48] scripture how many times did it happen
[47:50] in the scripture so we see real events
[47:53] as as we read it in the scripture of how
[47:55] people were set up
[47:57] it's in the Old Testament and in the new
[48:00] so you can't oh that's just it's just
[48:02] New Testament or oh that's Old Testament
[48:04] we don't believe Old Testament anymore
[48:05] well guess what it's in both so you have
[48:07] no
[48:09] excuse there's no excuse for it so not
[48:13] to bring politics into this but I don't
[48:15] know if anybody's heard an interview or
[48:17] seen an interview with Nancy
[48:20] Pelosi of where she's again I'm not
[48:22] trying to bring politics I'm trying to
[48:24] bring an example and and they openly
[48:26] admit it
[48:27] okay so I'm not speaking ill of her or
[48:30] good I'm not saying one way or the other
[48:32] you draw your own conclusion but this is
[48:35] what was said in an interview with her
[48:37] is she said it's a smear tactic that's
[48:40] what they call it it's a political
[48:42] tactical move as far as where you accuse
[48:46] the other side of what you are
[48:50] doing and then when you present it that
[48:52] the other side is doing it and you bring
[48:54] it out in the open
[48:57] that people are are more likely to
[48:59] believe that so it's a smear tactic and
[49:03] that's what people are trying to
[49:06] do they try to accuse you of what
[49:09] they're
[49:12] doing you see where I'm going with that
[49:14] is all these people that are accusing
[49:16] accusing of being a cult amen these that
[49:19] are accusing of being false
[49:21] teachers are they not the ones that are
[49:23] doing it and trying to smear somebody
[49:27] else for doing good works am that's
[49:31] good that's awesome oh you're following
[49:33] a man you better believe it all these
[49:36] men because even even in the scripture
[49:39] with Abraham when that man was saying oh
[49:42] if you could go and tell my brothers and
[49:44] warn them of this hell and
[49:47] destruction says even if they have the
[49:50] law and the prophets amen a prophet came
[49:56] in
[49:57] flesh a prophet was a
[50:02] man oh my they have the law and the
[50:06] prophets and what else did they say even
[50:08] if one raises from the dead they will
[50:11] still not
[50:14] believe it's because of the hardness of
[50:17] their hearts it's because there's a
[50:19] Heart of Stone and not a heart of
[50:23] Flesh amen
[50:26] I don't know why I'm going to hitting it
[50:28] this hard but you understand what I'm
[50:30] saying but there are people out there
[50:32] that are going to try to ruin your
[50:34] influence because of jealousy because of
[50:37] malice because of a hardness of a
[50:40] heart that's and when they try to smear
[50:42] are they not doing what they're accusing
[50:46] OFW oh
[50:48] my see Joseph back in the day right we
[50:53] know the story of Joseph
[50:59] a very I want to choose the words
[51:02] because I want to say an iconic figure
[51:04] which we don't want to put him up as an
[51:05] idol right so we don't want to put him
[51:07] up as an iconic but a very important
[51:10] figure in the scripture so much as we
[51:13] understand that he types Christ through
[51:15] different things and what he's
[51:16] experienced in his life but in the that
[51:19] day in Piper's house when his wife was
[51:22] trying to coer him
[51:26] trying to subdue her him with her
[51:29] batting of the
[51:32] eyes and the gains saying of the trying
[51:35] to do the influence you grown-ups know
[51:36] what I'm talking
[51:38] about but trying to influence Joseph to
[51:41] do something that he shouldn't be doing
[51:44] and what did he do just casually walk
[51:47] away well I don't belong here I'm just
[51:49] going to move along you and I don't see
[51:52] eye to
[51:54] eye and brother
[51:58] ran he didn't want any part of it right
[52:02] because he was righteous and he didn't
[52:04] want any part of it amen but we
[52:06] understand the story of her
[52:10] influential testimony of how he tried to
[52:14] coers her and force his way upon her so
[52:19] why was her testimony believed and not
[52:22] his that's good I think it had something
[52:25] to do with social status there you go
[52:28] that's right come on but see and that's
[52:31] exactly why the scripture says be no
[52:33] respector of person that's right that's
[52:36] good but see in the mouth of two or
[52:38] three Witnesses oh but
[52:41] wait that could be perverted as well oh
[52:45] it can yes you know the story of Nebo
[52:49] right he had a
[52:50] Vineyard King Ahab said hey I would like
[52:53] to have your
[52:55] Vineyard would you sell it to me I'll
[52:57] give you something that's I'll give you
[52:59] land that's equal to it or the money of
[53:01] the price of what you give it to me what
[53:03] did he say no I can't give it to you I
[53:06] can't sell it to you because this is the
[53:08] land of my fathers I can't do this
[53:12] business
[53:13] transaction no matter how much I would
[53:15] like to he says I'm obligated I cannot
[53:17] do it so what did King Ahab do he ran
[53:21] home and he went in his bed and he cried
[53:25] and he wept and he like a little child
[53:28] because he didn't get his way right
[53:31] because there's something about that
[53:32] social status when you got everything
[53:35] prach it it and when you don't get what
[53:37] you want you cry like a little baby
[53:40] right
[53:42] right that's good I've been kind of
[53:44] hitting on you know people trying to
[53:47] read this book through an American and a
[53:50] a a a us an American mindset a mind
[53:54] frame which we cannot do that that's
[53:56] right
[53:57] yes but that's what it is we live in
[54:00] this country and we're so spoiled on the
[54:01] things even even a poor person is
[54:04] considered rich in the in a in somebody
[54:06] in the third world country's eyes
[54:11] right but see this this King got so
[54:14] upset because he couldn't get what he
[54:16] wanted so his wife comes in oh honey
[54:18] what is wrong I didn't get what I
[54:22] wanted nebb didn't give me his Vineyard
[54:25] and I want want
[54:30] it oh don't worry honey I'll get that
[54:33] Vineyard for
[54:35] you Jezebel we know we know Jezebel
[54:38] right so what did she do she went and
[54:41] she told so and so to get two sons of
[54:46] belal two sons of
[54:50] Mischief now if you understand Spirits
[54:54] Spirits like to cause m Chi that's
[54:58] right that's
[55:00] good that's something that I learned
[55:03] years
[55:03] ago we're learning how to use what you
[55:06] call a Ouija board you could buy it for
[55:09] $10.99 made by Milton Bradley at your
[55:12] nearest
[55:14] store not realizing what what they have
[55:17] on the Shelf there it's an instrument of
[55:19] evil that's
[55:21] necromancing necromancing you know what
[55:24] necromancing is is communicating with
[55:26] the de
[55:27] having fellowship with dead necro means
[55:29] dead so necromancing a Ouija board I
[55:32] don't know why I'm getting on a Ouija
[55:33] board but but that's how the whole thing
[55:35] is is uh uh Spirits would cause mischief
[55:39] to lie to you right an evil spirit would
[55:43] lie to an evil spirit you
[55:47] beta there's no loyalty among
[55:50] Thieves
[55:54] right so if you want to serve evil and
[55:57] you think they're going to take care of
[55:58] you they will devour their own that's
[56:01] right
[56:03] amen just take a look at I better not go
[56:08] there just take a look at what's
[56:10] happening in the political
[56:13] Arena because something didn't happen
[56:15] their way they are devouring one another
[56:21] right okay back to
[56:24] Jezebel got two sons of bow and
[56:27] influence them to speak lies to speak a
[56:31] false influence and what does she say oh
[56:34] go down there take two sons of bow and
[56:37] decree a fast so everybody's going to
[56:39] gather together and they're going to
[56:40] have a fast and make sure you put naboth
[56:43] at the
[56:44] head oh naboth is at the head those two
[56:47] sons of bow are on the opposite and what
[56:49] do they say oh I heard this man
[56:52] blasphemed God oh and the King
[56:56] oh it's one thing blaspheming God but
[56:58] blaspheming the
[57:00] king that's the carnality of it
[57:04] right they try to put a king above God
[57:08] anyways so she brought the influence of
[57:11] the two sons of bow more than willing to
[57:14] do this deed for her this evil deed and
[57:17] what did what did they do they went out
[57:18] and they stoned Nebo over a
[57:21] Vineyard see the damage a false
[57:24] accusation could cause that's right
[57:26] that's
[57:27] good Joseph didn't die but he sure went
[57:31] through it and it was ordained for him
[57:32] to go through those
[57:34] things so we could we could try to have
[57:36] pity on him but we know the outcome so
[57:39] we don't really have to have pity but
[57:41] you know you just feel bad for the guy
[57:43] going through that and somehow a
[57:45] righteous indignation comes up man if I
[57:47] was there you got the wrong spirit
[57:50] because you're wanting to call fire out
[57:51] of
[57:52] Heaven that's but see that's where our
[57:55] influence comes
[57:56] having the character of God having a
[57:58] Godly influence on those whether we can
[58:01] work with them if if whether we agree
[58:04] with them and if we could work with them
[58:06] through it to attain a a goal see we try
[58:11] to get along with with men we try to
[58:12] live peaceably among men as much as with
[58:15] is within us right right so I'm just
[58:18] going to tell you a story well you say
[58:20] well that's that's that's uh old Bible
[58:23] times okay this this is a serious story
[58:26] that I'm going to tell you at at the
[58:28] place that I used to work this happened
[58:29] a couple de probably a couple decades
[58:31] ago but it was probably 15 more than 15
[58:34] years I can't remember the year so you
[58:37] might say oh all these are Bible
[58:39] examples I'll give you a real life
[58:41] example there was a man that I worked
[58:43] with super nice and just had a Gentle
[58:47] Spirit about him and he was accused of
[58:50] doing of wrongdoing to a couple teenage
[58:53] girls they brought forth an accusation
[58:55] to against him well this man ended up
[58:59] going to jail for
[59:00] it but somehow for some reason these
[59:05] girls were convicted in their
[59:07] hearts and they came out and they
[59:09] revealed the truth because all of us
[59:11] were like this guy oh there's no way
[59:15] there's no
[59:16] way and come to find out the man was
[59:19] innocent the man was innocent but how
[59:22] many times did that happened when these
[59:24] girls football Stars you know sports
[59:27] stars have false accusations against
[59:30] them people of renown people in
[59:33] Celebrity Status having now y'all know
[59:35] how I feel about celebrities but uh
[59:38] people that have these good standing
[59:41] statuses right so and people bring a
[59:43] false accusation against them it about
[59:46] destroys their whole livelihood it
[59:49] destroys the influence and that's what
[59:52] happened with this this man you know he
[59:54] retired so we didn't didn't really get
[59:56] to talk with him unless you knew where
[59:58] he lived which I never knew but when
[1:00:01] those girls came out and said he did
[1:00:03] nothing to us we were wrong for whatever
[1:00:05] reason they
[1:00:06] had but you know that weigh on that man
[1:00:10] like nobody's
[1:00:12] business because even though he was
[1:00:15] proclaimed innocent it was still put out
[1:00:19] there for people to doubt
[1:00:26] so just because that accusation was
[1:00:28] against him people would always wonder
[1:00:31] was it true or is it not true and you
[1:00:35] know that burden weighed on that man so
[1:00:37] much that he killed himself
[1:00:40] wow that is the damage of false
[1:00:43] accusation that is the
[1:00:46] damage of false influence or a bad
[1:00:49] influence that is the damage now all of
[1:00:52] us spoke you know he was a super nice
[1:00:55] guy
[1:00:56] all of us felt well those girls should
[1:00:59] have been held accountable they should
[1:01:01] be persecuted or they should be tried
[1:01:04] for homicide for murder because of a
[1:01:06] false accusation of What They Carried
[1:01:09] and they caused that man to kill himself
[1:01:11] right because he couldn't live with
[1:01:14] people wondering if he did that or
[1:01:17] not I don't I don't I don't condone
[1:01:20] suicide but I I kind of have an
[1:01:23] understanding of why he would I wouldn't
[1:01:26] want anybody to do
[1:01:29] that because he couldn't handle that
[1:01:32] because he would have had to face people
[1:01:35] people that he knew people that he
[1:01:37] didn't know and just always wondered and
[1:01:40] they'd probably always in their minds
[1:01:42] they would probably always wag their
[1:01:44] fingers at them shame on you right for
[1:01:48] what I'm
[1:01:50] innocent but see that we also do the
[1:01:53] same thing as we carry we carry those
[1:01:55] burdens of about and sometimes it gets
[1:01:57] to be too much for us but we don't have
[1:01:59] to let we don't have to carry those
[1:02:00] burdens
[1:02:02] amen I'm I'm just going to I don't even
[1:02:05] so I don't know how much longer I'll be
[1:02:09] I don't know if I'm
[1:02:10] [Laughter]
[1:02:13] closing uh but but through that man and
[1:02:17] look at the look at the same influence
[1:02:20] during the Salem Witch Trials anybody
[1:02:22] ever read those how many innocent young
[1:02:26] girls and uh women suffered at the hand
[1:02:31] because of an accusation all somebody
[1:02:33] had to do is say hey I saw them doing
[1:02:36] such and such hey I saw and heard them
[1:02:39] blaspheme God and the king and that's
[1:02:42] all it took now see we know in the
[1:02:45] scripture in the mouth of two or two or
[1:02:47] three Witnesses let everything be
[1:02:49] established if you notice there were two
[1:02:50] sons of bow so they met that requirement
[1:02:53] of two or three right but alls it took
[1:02:56] in Salem is it somebody to bring an
[1:02:59] accusation and no matter what they said
[1:03:02] no matter how much they pleaded their
[1:03:04] innocence it didn't matter because once
[1:03:06] they were declared a witch or they were
[1:03:10] practicing witchcraft that was
[1:03:14] it I think it was PE if so if if if one
[1:03:18] person was jealous of another that's all
[1:03:20] they had to do is
[1:03:22] lie H and when you know it they they
[1:03:26] claim to be
[1:03:27] Christian oh all in the name of
[1:03:30] Christianity Ah that's not the work of a
[1:03:32] Christian that's right amen backbiting
[1:03:36] and destroying somebody else's influence
[1:03:38] is not the work of a Christian that's
[1:03:41] right amen so everybody familiar with
[1:03:45] Jim
[1:03:48] Jones I read this this was a while back
[1:03:52] and it got me so upset because I see
[1:03:56] that they tried to accuse brother
[1:03:58] brandom of being with Jim Jones if you
[1:04:01] search Jones in the message if you
[1:04:04] search Jones there aren't that many hits
[1:04:07] of Jones and when he mentions Jones it's
[1:04:10] just like keeping up with the Joneses
[1:04:13] exactly right I think of and when they
[1:04:16] said that oh that he would have uh
[1:04:20] meetings with with Jim Jones and Jim
[1:04:22] Jones was a follower of William brandham
[1:04:25] he might have been a follower of William
[1:04:26] brandom but so are a lot of people are
[1:04:28] follower of the Bible but yet are not
[1:04:30] Christians all Israel is not Israel
[1:04:32] every Christian that professes to be a
[1:04:34] Christian is not a Christian right amen
[1:04:37] right so you have extremists you have
[1:04:40] people take the message too far and then
[1:04:42] you have the other side to where they
[1:04:44] don't take it far enough
[1:04:47] right but see and this kind of
[1:04:50] infuriated me when the accusation came
[1:04:52] out against Jim Jones because I was
[1:04:54] trying to find some old Flyers now see
[1:04:57] you got you got to throw it right back
[1:04:59] out there right because they're trying
[1:05:00] to find evidence and wouldn't you know I
[1:05:03] couldn't find any
[1:05:05] evidence so all these people have
[1:05:08] opinions right all these people have
[1:05:10] empty accusations and no facts
[1:05:14] yes I don't know why I'm going here but
[1:05:17] I went I went here at the old church too
[1:05:19] this this was stuff in my notes but uh I
[1:05:22] was going to try to leave this part out
[1:05:24] but but even they're trying to put him
[1:05:26] with Jim Jones but the whole thing I
[1:05:28] want to get to with Jim Jones is not so
[1:05:31] much that with brother Brandon but the
[1:05:33] whole issue or the whole thing with Jim
[1:05:36] Jones was you ever hear the the
[1:05:38] expression if you worked in a factory or
[1:05:40] someplace people will say oh you drank
[1:05:42] the Kool-Aid talking about uh you went
[1:05:44] over to the dark side of of management
[1:05:46] you know uh so that's where that term
[1:05:49] comes from is drinking the Kool-Aid
[1:05:52] because Jim Jones had such an influence
[1:05:54] on people
[1:05:56] he had a a thumb on the people kind of
[1:05:59] ruled them in through
[1:06:02] fear and oppress them and if they tried
[1:06:05] to leave they couldn't they were stuck
[1:06:09] oh it was the oh sounds so good oh come
[1:06:12] with us the influence but once they were
[1:06:14] there they were stuck and then when they
[1:06:16] got caught they had a whole mass of
[1:06:19] people forced them to drink it or some
[1:06:22] drank willingly the Kool-Aid that
[1:06:24] poisoned the whole
[1:06:26] Camp right and if we're not careful if
[1:06:29] we allow the poison into the camp it
[1:06:31] will poison the whole that's right Camp
[1:06:33] that's we were warned of that there's
[1:06:35] going to be somebody that comes in
[1:06:37] that's going to shoot the poison in
[1:06:39] amongst the Believers and try to call
[1:06:40] desent cause dissension cause
[1:06:43] division we don't want that that's where
[1:06:46] we have to draw that much closer
[1:06:47] together at the
[1:06:50] end am I saying this body absolutely am
[1:06:53] I saying this body the body and Al be
[1:06:56] absolutely am I saying this body the
[1:06:57] body in albian the body in Indiana the
[1:07:00] body in Nicaragua the body in Cuba the
[1:07:03] body in India yes amen we need to unify
[1:07:07] that much more amen see we need to
[1:07:10] figure out what we believe and and
[1:07:12] that's why it's so important when we are
[1:07:14] asked of what we believe we should be
[1:07:16] able to answer in a good conscience of
[1:07:18] what we believe amen because it has to
[1:07:21] become real to you it has to be real to
[1:07:23] me it has to be real to everybody in
[1:07:25] here here if it's not real to
[1:07:28] you then you're not going to influence
[1:07:30] anybody that's right amen amen see with
[1:07:33] all this this is the same Spirit of
[1:07:35] Janice and jambre it's the same Spirit
[1:07:36] of cor and Dayan because it's trying to
[1:07:39] undermine or pervert the work of the
[1:07:42] Lord
[1:07:46] amen
[1:07:48] so I'm
[1:07:51] debating what do I want to say next Lord
[1:07:54] lead me what what do you want minutes I
[1:07:56] told a story uh at the at the home
[1:08:00] church when I was little and then uh
[1:08:02] I'll I'll read a couple quotes because I
[1:08:04] don't I don't want you to get bored so
[1:08:07] when I was young and I was in grade
[1:08:10] school don't don't hold it against me
[1:08:14] but my my one brother and my sister we
[1:08:19] we and I don't do this you heard it here
[1:08:25] but we broke into the school uh we we
[1:08:27] came from Maryland but we broke into the
[1:08:29] school down there the window was already
[1:08:31] broken I'm I'm just saying that and I'm
[1:08:33] still maintaining that innocence to this
[1:08:35] day but we got caught and very we we
[1:08:38] should have got caught we deserved to
[1:08:39] get caught so uh the principal there I
[1:08:44] remember her name was uh Mrs Richmond
[1:08:46] and she stood about this tall I think
[1:08:49] it's a great school I was taller than
[1:08:51] her but anyways that's that has nothing
[1:08:53] to do with the story uh but she had
[1:08:57] asked me did you did you break the
[1:08:58] window no we didn't break the window did
[1:09:00] you break the window did you not hear me
[1:09:03] the first time no we did not break the
[1:09:04] window did you break the window no we
[1:09:07] did not break the window it was already
[1:09:08] broken because there was tape all over
[1:09:09] it you know and my brother just pushed
[1:09:11] it in and open the window okay did you
[1:09:13] break the window goodness gracious lady
[1:09:17] no but that was a great schooler I I
[1:09:20] didn't have that Gusto that I have
[1:09:23] now so
[1:09:26] as a as a young I think I was like seven
[1:09:30] maybe eight years old so easily
[1:09:33] influenced I maintained that influence
[1:09:35] but I got so sick and tired of her
[1:09:36] asking me I just said yes we broke the
[1:09:39] window and that was
[1:09:40] it
[1:09:43] so lesson learned stand your ground
[1:09:46] right don't fall under the influence
[1:09:48] because you're going to be buffeted
[1:09:50] you're going to be hit you're going to
[1:09:51] be hammered by by this by this doubt by
[1:09:54] this unbelief by this this by this by
[1:09:56] this you're going to be hammered but
[1:09:58] don't fall into it stand your ground
[1:10:02] amen stand your ground no matter how
[1:10:04] much Mrs Richmond ask you if you broke
[1:10:07] the window don't give in amen you
[1:10:11] maintain your faith that's good and it
[1:10:13] should make you that much stronger
[1:10:16] because happy are we to be able to
[1:10:17] suffer for doing good works for him
[1:10:22] amen so I'm going to read a couple
[1:10:25] couple quotes is that
[1:10:29] okay better get a drink first it's a
[1:10:33] long good thing you're sitting down G to
[1:10:35] be
[1:10:41] long but it's very
[1:10:43] applicable he says and when we lose our
[1:10:45] influence as a father as a mother and he
[1:10:49] goes so far as to say as a Christian he
[1:10:52] says and we when we lose our influence
[1:10:55] as a father as a mother as a Christian
[1:10:57] as a businessman as a minister when we
[1:11:00] lose our influence with people now we
[1:11:02] could be very popular in the line of the
[1:11:04] world and go along with the world but I
[1:11:07] mean as what we
[1:11:09] represent we
[1:11:11] represent Christ amen Christ is it all
[1:11:15] the the whole thing of what we live for
[1:11:19] because Paul said for me to die is gain
[1:11:22] but for me to live to for me to um
[1:11:25] messing it up but for me to live is
[1:11:27] Christ amen amen so that should be our
[1:11:30] mind frame yes if we die it's gain to us
[1:11:34] but as we live it's it's a gain to us as
[1:11:37] well because we live unto Christ so he
[1:11:39] says but I mean as what we represent we
[1:11:42] represent Christ when we lose our
[1:11:43] influences that as standing out how can
[1:11:46] we blend in with with the day when God
[1:11:50] is so against the day how could M Mah
[1:11:53] say go on go on up and Prosper my vision
[1:11:56] is right with yours when he knew that
[1:11:58] God had cursed that evil people his
[1:12:00] vision had to be
[1:12:01] contrary so no matter how much they paid
[1:12:04] balum to uh curse uh Israel he could not
[1:12:08] do it why because he was a prophet he
[1:12:10] had a vision of the Lord he had the word
[1:12:11] of the Lord and he had to speak the word
[1:12:13] of the
[1:12:18] Lord so and and and a man's Vision today
[1:12:22] that could go with the trend of the
[1:12:23] world and still remain a minister there
[1:12:25] there's something wrong with that with
[1:12:26] the man's Vision you know what God said
[1:12:29] about this Rich leaan church he put him
[1:12:31] on the outside or uh Le the leoan church
[1:12:35] put him on the outside we cannot stand
[1:12:37] with the popular popular belief and vote
[1:12:39] of the day we've got to be against that
[1:12:42] thing does that mean that you have to
[1:12:45] take up arms because you're against it
[1:12:47] no you just don't receive it right you
[1:12:49] just reject it amen right so and that
[1:12:53] was in 63 in influence in 64 influences
[1:12:57] he says remember the Bible said you are
[1:12:59] living written Epistles read of all men
[1:13:01] right people are going to see our lives
[1:13:04] if we can't preach the gospel they will
[1:13:05] see how we live our lives and that is
[1:13:08] preaching the word so you don't have to
[1:13:10] stand behind a Pulpit to be a preacher
[1:13:13] that's right you could preach preach the
[1:13:15] gospel use words if necessary right so
[1:13:20] now many that's not my own I can't
[1:13:21] remember who said it but I I really like
[1:13:23] it I I say it a lot and and how true it
[1:13:26] is because a a a life lived is worth
[1:13:29] more than a thousand words when people
[1:13:33] see a life lived so now many people
[1:13:35] won't read the Bible but God has made
[1:13:37] you a living representative you are a
[1:13:39] walking letter should be a walking Bible
[1:13:41] Christ in you amen you should be walking
[1:13:44] you should be the walking word of God
[1:13:45] and if you profess to be a Christian
[1:13:47] what you're influencing will make you
[1:13:49] have have to answer for many Souls whe
[1:13:53] that you've turned aside away from
[1:13:54] Christ in the in that day of
[1:13:56] judgment see this this is for us and
[1:14:00] people that are against us that uh and
[1:14:04] if you profess to be a Christian if you
[1:14:06] profess to be a Christian what you're
[1:14:10] influencing will make you have to answer
[1:14:13] for many Souls that you have turned
[1:14:15] aside away from Christ that's right
[1:14:19] whether it's us whether it's
[1:14:21] denomination whether it's non-
[1:14:22] denomination that doesn't agree uh with
[1:14:26] us if we can come and agree that Jesus
[1:14:29] Christ is the Lord Our Savior that we
[1:14:31] need to be baptized and filled with the
[1:14:33] Holy Spirit and that we receive the
[1:14:35] gifts of God that we have common ground
[1:14:38] that we can agree on where it gets all
[1:14:40] muddled up is men's Doctrine when people
[1:14:43] want to d uh try to bring Doctrine and
[1:14:46] they put their own interpretation to it
[1:14:48] or turn it spurn it into the way to fit
[1:14:52] their
[1:14:53] lifestyle they will be held accountable
[1:14:57] of how they've swayed people away from
[1:14:59] Christ that's right and if we have done
[1:15:01] so we will be held accountable if we
[1:15:04] have swayed people away from Christ
[1:15:06] absolutely so this is this is out to let
[1:15:10] your light so shine before men in 61
[1:15:12] talking about the stoning of
[1:15:14] Steven continuing on with the with the
[1:15:17] idea that we are written Epistles read
[1:15:19] of all men he says and when they stoned
[1:15:20] him to death throw him outside the city
[1:15:23] and beat him to death with stones when
[1:15:25] he was dying he raised his head to
[1:15:26] heaven and asked for and asked
[1:15:29] forgiveness for those who was stoning
[1:15:31] him my who would have a heart in this
[1:15:35] day to do
[1:15:37] that come on if we were being beaten
[1:15:40] would we be able to sincerely look up
[1:15:43] and say I forgive you because you don't
[1:15:45] know what you're doing may you find the
[1:15:48] Lord Jesus Christ would you be able to
[1:15:49] say that with your dying breath or would
[1:15:52] you still try to keep on fighting
[1:15:56] that's good that's the nature of a man
[1:15:58] is the it's either fight or flight you
[1:16:00] know and if and if you want to keep
[1:16:02] living you're going to fight to survive
[1:16:10] right the same G same as Jesus did at
[1:16:13] the cross then God seen his little
[1:16:15] advertisement board wow I really like
[1:16:17] how he puts that out there then God seen
[1:16:20] his little advertisement board being
[1:16:21] taken down Steven looked up to heaven
[1:16:24] said behold I see Heavens open up or I
[1:16:26] see Heavens open and Jesus standing at
[1:16:28] the right hand of God and he fell asleep
[1:16:30] in the arms of God he was an adverti
[1:16:32] advertisement board for a hungry world
[1:16:35] you say well how many was there you uh
[1:16:39] you said there was maybe 5,000 how many
[1:16:41] of them got saved there was one he never
[1:16:45] accepted it right then but years later
[1:16:47] so you never know the influence that you
[1:16:49] have on somebody just because you don't
[1:16:50] see immediate results right see our job
[1:16:53] is to plant the seed
[1:16:55] it might be somebody else's duty to
[1:16:57] water that seed right because when
[1:16:59] people said oh we're of Apollos we're of
[1:17:02] of Paul but one planteth one WTH we all
[1:17:06] work toward one goal is to bring a soul
[1:17:11] to Christ right and to encourage other
[1:17:14] believers right
[1:17:16] so uh he says how many of them got saved
[1:17:19] he said there was one he never accepted
[1:17:21] it right then but years later Hallelujah
[1:17:23] somewhere your influence never dies
[1:17:25] there was one held held the coat uh Saul
[1:17:28] that young Pharisee standing there
[1:17:29] consulted and gave witness to his death
[1:17:32] but when he saw the that advertisement
[1:17:33] of the power of the resurrected Christ
[1:17:35] and that little fellow had never got
[1:17:36] away from him that same man Paul that
[1:17:39] one standing there that morning LED tens
[1:17:41] of thousands of souls to Christ and
[1:17:43] still is amen yes and still is amen
[1:17:48] through his influence of testimony of
[1:17:50] how he stayed true and faithful amen no
[1:17:53] matter how many shipwrecks he was in no
[1:17:54] no matter how many times he got whipped
[1:17:57] right he kept the faith even now his
[1:18:00] testimony still Rings true it is still
[1:18:02] bringing souls to Christ
[1:18:07] amen because one man was willing to give
[1:18:10] his life to be an advertising board for
[1:18:12] Jesus Christ what ought we what ought we
[1:18:15] to do today no matter we don't have to
[1:18:18] we don't have to have big audiences we
[1:18:19] don't have to preach to 10,000 we don't
[1:18:21] have to even preach we could be God's
[1:18:23] advertisement board how do you know that
[1:18:25] your life might not start some young man
[1:18:27] on the gospel some of you older men see
[1:18:29] old see old women start some some young
[1:18:32] man on the field out there would win
[1:18:34] 10,000 souls to Christ is because he saw
[1:18:36] Christ in you that you presented Christ
[1:18:38] to him in the simple in the simple power
[1:18:42] of the Gospel wow that's good see people
[1:18:45] try to make it so
[1:18:47] complicated they speak with eloquent
[1:18:49] words to make it sound like they're the
[1:18:51] only ones who have the truth come on if
[1:18:55] we could just speak it simple Paul spoke
[1:18:57] it simple yes we don't have to make it
[1:19:01] complicated amen right because it's it's
[1:19:04] with the hardness of Hearts where people
[1:19:06] come and say well what about this can I
[1:19:08] get away with this is what they're
[1:19:09] saying if I do this but if I could just
[1:19:12] do this and weasel some some kind of sin
[1:19:14] in there to still uhh uh play with the
[1:19:18] world or have common ground with the
[1:19:20] world no you've got to separate from all
[1:19:22] of those things
[1:19:25] but people just can't they can't let go
[1:19:28] wholeheartedly because they want one
[1:19:30] foot left out in the
[1:19:32] world they still want a part of
[1:19:38] it Lord help
[1:19:42] us but you never know what kind of an
[1:19:44] influence that you're going to have on
[1:19:46] somebody that's right brother sister

[1:19:49] what caused that change well let's sit
[1:19:52] down and let me tell you for a little
[1:19:53] while this might take a little
[1:19:56] while but I used to do this but the Lord
[1:19:59] took that I used to do this but the Lord
[1:20:01] took that I used to do this and it just
[1:20:04] opens up you start remembering oh my
[1:20:06] that's right I used to do this but the
[1:20:08] Lord took that away I used to do this
[1:20:10] but the Lord took that
[1:20:11] away and would you know it the Lord is
[1:20:15] glorified by your
[1:20:17] testimony
[1:20:19] amen
[1:20:21] amen see I think we need the Christ yes
[1:20:24] sir only way we see Christ is when he
[1:20:26] reflects in each other I see Christ in
[1:20:28] you you see him in me that's how we
[1:20:31] watch Christ I come to the meeting I
[1:20:33] start preaching I watch the people you
[1:20:35] could see whether they're interested or
[1:20:36] not just a few moments yeah sometimes
[1:20:38] you could tell I I can agree with that
[1:20:41] there most times you can tell you look
[1:20:43] over your audience you could tell
[1:20:44] whether you're boring them or whether
[1:20:45] you're not see and the first thing you
[1:20:47] know now see that that's going to hit
[1:20:49] somebody well I don't want them to think
[1:20:51] I'm boring that I'm bored
[1:20:55] a Believer doesn't want to have that
[1:20:57] kind of a I don't want that reputation
[1:20:59] yeah I'm I'm
[1:21:02] focused we hey I get it sometimes we get
[1:21:05] tired and and you know it's uh if it's
[1:21:08] warm I start falling asleep if if it's
[1:21:10] warm I remember we we we had Brothers
[1:21:13] man and they're and they're going right
[1:21:14] in it and I'm enjoying it and I'm
[1:21:16] sitting there dozing on how am I dozing
[1:21:18] off right
[1:21:20] now stay awake
[1:21:22] buddy but it's hard yeah I get it
[1:21:25] sometimes it's just hard you know so he
[1:21:27] says you could tell whether you're
[1:21:28] boring them or whether you're not he
[1:21:30] says see in the first thing you know you
[1:21:32] see them sitting there hanging unto
[1:21:33] every word under expectation waiting to
[1:21:36] hear a word of encouragement waiting to
[1:21:38] hear a word that demolishes the
[1:21:40] influence that they just came across
[1:21:43] they're waiting to hear a word from that
[1:21:44] they're waiting for a a a word to build
[1:21:47] faith is that what your expectation is
[1:21:50] Lord I have a need I I want to be closer
[1:21:52] to you I want to be built up I want this
[1:21:55] spiritual house built up into what you
[1:21:57] would be pleased with amen so it might
[1:22:00] not be something today that you have
[1:22:02] need of but tomorrow next week next
[1:22:04] month oh I remember so and so talked
[1:22:07] about this man that was encouraging I'm
[1:22:10] I'm not saying to look upon me I'm not
[1:22:12] saying that at all but as the Lord leads
[1:22:15] you take that as the Lord spoke to me
[1:22:17] this way amen because I'm a nobody I'm a
[1:22:21] nobody so but the spirit that I carry am
[1:22:27] and carrying his spirit I don't know if
[1:22:29] I ever preached that message here or not
[1:22:31] I think I did I am nobody yet somebody
[1:22:34] see if we can have that mindset I'm I'm
[1:22:36] a nobody that's awes but yet I'm
[1:22:38] somebody because I have his Spirit
[1:22:40] living inside of me see even brother
[1:22:43] Brandon was saying we don't need big
[1:22:45] groups following after us we don't need
[1:22:47] big Billboards out there uh pointing to
[1:22:49] us but if we can point others to Christ
[1:22:52] then I'm insignificant and I'm sure
[1:22:54] brother your pastor believes the same
[1:22:56] way I'm insignificant but he is
[1:22:58] everything if you miss if you miss me
[1:23:01] you didn't miss out on much but if you
[1:23:02] miss him you miss out on
[1:23:05] everything so that's my heart this
[1:23:07] morning and that's the way I that I
[1:23:09] always want to come and Minister the
[1:23:11] word to you is in that way but he's
[1:23:14] saying I'm seeing Christ reflected in
[1:23:16] that person because he's hungering and
[1:23:18] thirsting for
[1:23:21] God is it okay for another quote here
[1:23:23] yes sir keep going
[1:23:25] amen he says
[1:23:28] oh we are here brother sister we are at
[1:23:31] that time let's let's let the Holy
[1:23:33] Spirit influence us to the word of God
[1:23:35] let's let God do the influencing in our
[1:23:37] hearts and not be influenced by others
[1:23:39] see this ought to put us into action
[1:23:42] this ought to put us into action
[1:23:43] remember what we said what uh when does
[1:23:46] the change come the change comes after
[1:23:48] hearing the word that's when the change
[1:23:51] comes right that's when a person is
[1:23:53] converted they have to to hear the word
[1:23:55] they have to receive the word then they
[1:23:56] have to act upon the word that's and
[1:23:59] that's a whole uh uh basis of Faith you
[1:24:02] have to be able to hear it because Faith
[1:24:04] cometh by the hearing of the word of God
[1:24:06] right that's where faith comes in so
[1:24:08] then we have to receive that word if we
[1:24:10] can't receive the word then we need to
[1:24:13] get back to the Altar and seek the holy
[1:24:14] spirit because something is wrong if we
[1:24:17] can't uh accept and punctuate every word
[1:24:20] of God with an amen then something is
[1:24:23] wrong amen so then we have to act upon
[1:24:25] that right so he's uh that's where the
[1:24:29] change comes so he's saying let us have
[1:24:31] the Holy Spirit influence us to the word
[1:24:33] of God let's excuse me let's let God do
[1:24:36] the influencing in our hearts and not be
[1:24:38] influenced by others see this ought to
[1:24:39] put us into action with reverence and
[1:24:42] humility the pillar of fire Vindicated
[1:24:44] among us
[1:24:46] again not it didn't die out in in The
[1:24:50] Exodus when they were led by the pillar
[1:24:51] of fire it didn't die out
[1:24:56] God didn't die out then when they
[1:24:58] crossed after they crossed the Red Sea
[1:25:01] that wasn't we believe God up to here
[1:25:03] and then we're going to put a period on
[1:25:05] look at the vast happenings all through
[1:25:08] scripture of What the Lord Has
[1:25:11] Done It doesn't stop here at the last
[1:25:13] period in Revelation it doesn't stop
[1:25:16] there come on he's a living God this is
[1:25:19] a Living Word it's still living on the
[1:25:21] inside here amen right that's good and I
[1:25:26] lost my
[1:25:27] spot but that's exactly what caused
[1:25:30] those Apostles when they seen that word
[1:25:32] uh made made
[1:25:35] manifest that influenced him they they
[1:25:37] said we are sure of this thing because
[1:25:39] they saw the truth happening amen he
[1:25:41] says they got in actions yes when when
[1:25:44] his promise was fulfilled when they seen
[1:25:46] that Jesus promised them that he would
[1:25:47] send the promise of the father upon them
[1:25:49] Luke 24:49 behold I send the promise of
[1:25:52] my father upon you but take ter ter ye
[1:25:55] doesn't mean pray it just means wait
[1:25:57] Terry means wait wait up wait up there
[1:26:00] at the city of Jerusalem until you're
[1:26:02] endued with power on high endued with
[1:26:04] power from on high and when this
[1:26:06] influence of the Holy Ghost struck them
[1:26:08] it filled them they seen the word that
[1:26:11] Jesus Promised and fulfilled now I
[1:26:13] wonder if it would take the same
[1:26:15] influence on us this afternoon if we
[1:26:17] seen what what he promised to do in the
[1:26:20] last days fulfilled what kind of an
[1:26:22] influence would it give us
[1:26:25] what all we have seen done in these last
[1:26:28] days ought to put us in action it sure
[1:26:30] ought to ought to with reverence and
[1:26:34] humility amen if you stand your feet I'm
[1:26:36] just going to read one more
[1:26:44] quote and this is from that time in 1962
[1:26:47] he says there was a maniac one day uh up
[1:26:50] in gatera who was cutting himself and
[1:26:52] they'd bind him in Chains now see most
[1:26:54] people would just count him as lost and
[1:26:56] wouldn't want anything to do with him
[1:26:58] well he's lost just let him
[1:27:01] go now see who was cutting himself and
[1:27:03] they'd bind him in Chains and his power
[1:27:05] of 10 times an ordinary man could break
[1:27:07] the powers of them chains I always
[1:27:08] thought if he was so perfectly under the
[1:27:11] influence of the devil and being able to
[1:27:13] do that see pay attention to what he's
[1:27:16] saying here if this man under the
[1:27:18] influence of the devil could do those
[1:27:20] kind of works amen of how it looked like
[1:27:22] he was so full of power
[1:27:24] being demon-possessed
[1:27:26] uhuh he says what what the devil takes a
[1:27:30] hold of a person insane it takes men and
[1:27:32] women to hold him he breaks them chains
[1:27:34] completely surrendered to the devil if
[1:27:37] he could break chains how much more
[1:27:39] could we break completely surrendered to
[1:27:42] God how much more powerful is God's
[1:27:45] power than the devil's and there he was
[1:27:47] this poor maniac and he was always out
[1:27:50] there in the graveyard cutting himself
[1:27:51] with stones and and attacked everybody
[1:27:53] but one day he met God but one day he
[1:27:57] met God and things changed for him after
[1:28:00] that he was clothed in his right mind
[1:28:03] why because he had met God Amen he had
[1:28:07] met god let's bow our heads Heavenly
[1:28:10] Father we just thank you so much for the
[1:28:11] day that you've given oh Lord we thank
[1:28:13] you for your word and we know it is
[1:28:15] truth father we just thank you that we
[1:28:17] are able to see into your word Lord like
[1:28:19] we said uh at the start we might not
[1:28:22] know all the Mysteries and even Paul
[1:28:24] Paul said even if he knows all the M
[1:28:27] Mysteries if if we don't know the
[1:28:29] Mysteries but even if he knew all the
[1:28:31] Mysteries and if he spoke with tongues
[1:28:33] and he did all had all these gifts but
[1:28:35] without love it didn't mean anything so
[1:28:38] Lord if we could have that love if we
[1:28:40] don't know all the Mysteries if we could
[1:28:41] still have that love for one another
[1:28:44] Lord are we going to make mistakes sure
[1:28:46] we're going to make mistakes we live in
[1:28:47] this human body we're still in this
[1:28:49] Fallen condition but Lord we just thank
[1:28:51] you so much that uh where there

[1:28:58] and corrects the error and I thank you
[1:28:59] so much for when the word comes and and
[1:29:02] makes a correction to those things so
[1:29:04] Lord even if when we were wrong we pray

[1:29:36] to say that this is an old outdated
[1:29:38] thing that people can't follow it that
