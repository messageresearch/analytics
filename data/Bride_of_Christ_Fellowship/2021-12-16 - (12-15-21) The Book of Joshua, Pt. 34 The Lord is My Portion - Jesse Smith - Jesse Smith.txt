for tonight and get into the sermon here tonight by god's grace let's go to joshua chapter 21 here joshua so that's the fifth book of the bible or sixth book of the bible rather genesis exodus leviticus numbers deuteronomy and joshua joshua chapter 21. we're just working our way right through this and uh really enjoying it praise god it's really taught us how to fight praise god joshua never lost a fight as long as he was obeying the word of the lord so we can see the same for our lives as we obey the word of the lord god does great things in our life he fights our battles for us he defeats all the enemies praise god joshua chapter 21 now this is on uh this chapter is about the division of the land and the portion given to the levites okay so we know that they weren't given lands but they still needed some place to live right they weren't given lands or mountains or rivers or wells or anything like that but they had to live somewhere so this chapter deals with all the places they were given so let's read verse 1 and two i'll read i'll read verses one and two and then we'll read another scripture here verse one says then came near the heads of the fathers of the levites unto eliazar the priest and unto joshua the son of nun and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of israel and they spake unto them at shiloh in the land of canaan saying the lord commanded by the hand of moses to give us cities to dwell in with the suburbs thereof for our cattle now if you would go back two or three chapters earlier joshua 18 7. we'll read this one together joshua 18 verse 7. joshua 18 verse 7. we'd like to look at the lord is my portion tonight i'd like to look at this sub-topic here the lord is my portion joshua 18 verse 7. of course this is the chapter where they were going out and dividing the land to the last seven tribes let's read verse seven can't we let's read it on three one two three but the levites have no part among you for the priesthood of the lord is their inheritance and gad and reuben and half the tribe of manasseh have received their inheritance beyond jordan on the east which moses the servant of the lord gave them amen let's have a word of prayer and let's bow our heads and if you have a need on your heart just make a known unto god somehow maybe raise your hand or ask god to minister to your need you know many times it's through the preaching of the word that god will answer our questions or god will give us strength or god will give us courage through the word of god the bible says the word of god is nigh you it's close to you even in your mouth so let's pray together heavenly father we love you god we've sang your songs we've prayed god we made our request unto you now we come to the word of god which you said was foolishness to the world but to us it's the power of god unto salvation we feel supercharged tonight lord we feel the power of the lord tonight god and it's in your word oh god and it's in your holy spirit so we ask oh god that you would give us a spiritual charge encourage us oh god give us hope god for the future give us strength o god give us your mind oh god may we have the mind of christ tonight dear god and i just pray you anoint me anoint your people god annoy each one of us we can create such an atmosphere where the holy spirit can be felt people can weep and cry and shout and scream and give you glory where the total liberty the holy spirit is felt god we ask that great request lord in the mighty name of jesus christ and the church said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god so i have some slides here we'll like to look at some slides and uh try to preach about an hour i already started my timer here so we try to watch everybody's uh you know schedule uh looking forward again to this weekend looking forward to having brother brooks so he'll be with us saturday at 6 00 and sunday at 10. and then i was gonna tell i was gonna i was my wife and i were and the kids were kind of talking if if naomi and beatrice if you'd like to do a a new year's eve service you know i'm sorry uh not a new year's we want to do that too but if you want to do a christmas eve service let us know we'd have to be on a friday night so just something to consider you know all the we could all practice some christmas songs or you could just have a we could turn off the lights and put a few candles up here you know just whatever if you want to get together on christmas eve you know and just worship god for sending jesus christ in the flesh and we we'd love to do that by god's grace and the main thing is just spend more time praying you know reading your bible and worshiping jesus and fellowshipping with the saints that's the main thing and uh it's so great you know it's a great time of the year i love how god makes it like brother said god makes the whole world recognize that god sent his son they sing they sing about uh you hear it you know i think where we're at we're at some heathen store the other we're not a heathen store but we're at some worldly store the other day and they were playing a christmas what was it mustard seed okay a mustard seed and now they got nice food but they got the wrong kind of clientele there like a lot of you know but uh i was wow like i just heard the cry name of christ you know i think it was oh holy night or something like that like god makes the whole world recognize that jesus christ was sent to this world and thank god we know his spirit's with us today praise god so let's look at this here we'll try to look at urging israel to make their choice and then the recorded joshua's death okay so we're looking at chapter 21 now church here's the outline if you just like a little more uh look at detail look at this chapter you know the first eight verses uh talk about the cities for the tribe of levi there's 48 cities in all that the levites were given uh verses 9 through 19 are the cities given to aaron and his tribe uh or in his yeah his his family rather his family verses 20 through 26 where the city's given to cohath and uh 27 to 33 where the city's given to the sons of gershom and then verses 34 to 42 the city's given to uh murari and then the chapter ends by rehearsing god's faithfulness praise god and we want to you know look at that of course but now i put in blue on the next slide i put on the blue what each family was responsible so the co-athletes know aaron and his sons they were the ones that actually got to go into the presence of god nobody else could do that just aaron and his sons they could go past the outer court there was three courts right the outer court the holy place but they could go behind the curtain and they could go to where the ark of the covenant was and they would worship and they would talk to god off of the ark right what a privilege that would have been praise god to see that but thank god that brother you know the bible says that now god dwells in us now we don't have to go to a special building although we like to come here to worship god but we don't have to do that to hear the voice of god we can just pray and listen to god speak to us from the throne of our heart praise god because this is where god lives now god lives in the soul now praise god yes he meets us here and he sends his anointing in this room thank god for that but the real place god wants to speak to us today is from the throne of our hearts where we're just meditating on god can you imagine that can you imagine like aaron being shut shut into a room and there's no cell phone going off or no tv on or no there's no alerts going on there's no alerts you're just enjoying god's presence amen that's what we've got to get to today praise god that's why we've got to constantly struggle for praise god we got to struggle make time to spend with god and shut off the phone or put it on silence or do not to serve and make sure your time with god is undisturbed see that's what they long for everybody long for that to be like aaron everybody longed to go in the presence of god but it was it was a calling of god you had to be called to do it but see today everybody's called to have god's presence amen i don't know that's why jesus runs the veil right or the spirit run the veil when he was crucified it was showing everybody could come in the prince of god amen god wants to fellowship with all of us amen it's not just for one family it's not just for you know brother branham's family or brother jesse's family or or your family or am i it's for every family praise god god wants to fellowship and god is strong enough god is powerful enough to fellowship with all of us at the altar of our heart amen so aaron they got to go into the holiest once a year they could do that and god would we read the scripture remember on sunday and god would forgive all their sins away through those two goats remember that we looked at the remember that scripture one goat had to die they took his blood and they they sprinkled the whole thing and then the other goat they confessed all their sins can you imagine lord all jesse's sins for 2021 put it on this goat all of my family sins all the church of sins put it on this goat and then lead them away and that was a physical representation of what god did in the spiritual realm god spiritually sent all their sins away but god gave them a physical image to show them the truth of that god let them see what he was doing spiritually amen praise god and that's what baptism is when you're baptized it's a symbol outward of what's happened someone's died to sin and now they're alive to jesus christ it's an outward symbol that god has sent your sins away your your old self is dead the old jesse's dead the old austin's dead praise god that old man an old woman is dead and now i'm alive in christ jesus i'm alive i'm a new person amen i'm a new being i have a new life i'm a new creature amen that's real christianity praise god now kohath they had the nearest location to the ark for their ministry and that when i read their context it didn't tell me what their ministry was in other words they were the ones that lived closest to shiloh because that's where the ark was next the gershomites they were responsible for the tabernacles coverings and other textiles right you had all the curtains you have the curtains of goat skins you had all the skins and then there's all kinds of curtains blue curtains purple curtains scarlet curtains all kinds of beautiful curtains they their whole job their whole life was making curtains that's all they could do like just like my whole life is teaching all the time that's all that's all my life is i don't get to go do construction i don't get to go do anything else i just got to teach all the time i talk all the time somehow sometimes nature i don't know how my vocal cords make it it must be god's prayers and god's miracles it's all just teaching all the time talking all the time and i get tired of it sometimes like you ask a kid sometimes sometimes a supper i don't say a word because i'm just tired of talking but you know you're you're just you're called to do what you're called to do and you're supposed to be content god has a purpose for you god bless sister god has a purpose for you he's called you to do that and so you stay with it you stay with it because god told you to do it amen you don't doubt what god has called you to do whatever god calls you do you do it and you don't stop till he changes it amen hallelujah and you don't complain about it you pray about it amen don't complain pray about it praise god ask god if you want you know if something needs change in your life you know go to god in prayer but as these men learn you've got to stay in your position and god in other words god has a special calling for every person amen and their job was take care of the coverings make sure we got enough goat skins you know or ram skins or badger skins make sure we got all these skins and they're constantly getting skins all the time their whole life was wound up in skins amen so don't feel bad mothers if your whole life is wound up in racing your children don't feel bad that's a glorious thing to do praise god you are handling god's heritage amen god's possession amen you're raising god's heritage and you're building the house of the lord amen glory like rachel and leah did amen you're building something greater than what you even know or understand it's so great and dads you're putting food on the table and and leading your family and family prayer night and everything like that teaching your children the word of god you're building their character the same praise god so stay with it don't abandon your family praise god that's what my dad did he abandoned us but i'll never abandon my family by god's grace and i don't think bad of him i love him i forgive him but the devil tempts us to do those things and we got to overcome that praise god amen you got to stay where god's called you and if god's called you to something he's going to provide for you praise god amen just like god provided the skins for them he's had to go find some badgers amen got to go hunting or whatever they got to do got to provide if god's called you to do it he's going to provide for you he'll make a way where there seems to be no way amen hallelujah so gershom said it was constantly lord give us the coverings and god provided the coverings god had a special place for them to live the sons of murari their job was to guard the tabernacle and transport the frames they're like security service any security guards out there i don't maybe security guards and also transporting uh the the frames praise god the metal frames the brass or or whatever they had as far as the metals for frames their job was to carry it sounded like it sounds like iron workers like my brother sam he got an iron worker job in the trades but austin and he'd carry like he said like 20 of those rods at a time and he said he come home and you know i remember coming home he'd be sweating it'd be a summertime 100 degrees and he's just like his shirt's ripped and it's soaking wet from carrying rods all day that was his lot he liked it you know he worked hard he moved up now he's a supervisor praise god and god's blessed him so much but you know god has a different calling for us he couldn't imagine being in a classroom like me coloring with crayons and i couldn't imagine carrying those rods like him you know we just you know we just got our different callings in life and god wants us to respond to our calling and be faithful in our calling so what you see the trouble is when people wander from place to place that's what cain was cain was a wanderer he couldn't find a home in a certain place see we can't wander from church to church or from job to job we should find a place where god wants us and say god i know you called me there you're gonna bless me there i'm gonna be faithful there amen they could have argued they could argue saying hey sons of aaron can we trade you and you guys do the you guys do uh the frames and we'll take the holy spirit's for a while can we trade no no no and neither can someone like neither can our parents can our parents say well i don't want a parent anymore i like to go travel the world and just have some fun you know i'm tired of changing diapers can the parents say that of course not they would never leave god's heritage right they would never leave the souls god gave them that's ridiculous right it's silly it's evil it'd be wicked if they did that but see we must also find contentment in what god has called us to do we must be patient that god is working something inside of our lives we may not see it but god is bringing us to something greater in our lives amen like i told brothers on the way to church i remember last year god gave us that word from the lord from brother ray that there's a reason we're a small church it's to protect us well he could have told me that on year one brother before when we started the church and then i would have known but god don't do what i want to do god does what he wants to do god wouldn't see thou be faithful for 15 or 14 years and then he's going to let me know to protect you so your children don't get mistreated so you can write books and make videos and teach the world right now it's a small people around the world because brother brahms said i just read it this week brother baby said in the days of jesus hundred of one percent actually got to hear him then he said one percent of that actually believed him amen he said that's how it is at the end time right 100 to one percent actually hears about jesus right or wants to hear about jesus and then only one percent of little percentage of that actually will believe it and live it and obey it praise god and thank god you're one of them amen hallelujah because the other the other people that don't even want it they'd rather have money and drugs and sex and rock and roll and they'd rather have that and so they don't even want it so god can't even god tries to deal with them but they turn god down but look at you you're hearing the word of god you're living the word of god you're content where god has called you amen that's something the world has nothing they don't know nothing about that praise god but we know about it because of god's grace hallelujah now i mentioned this on sunday and we know we didn't read it but i want to read it tonight it's in your bible uh you don't have to turn there but as we don't have an hour to preach anyway so paul says god is not worshiped with man's hands as though he needs anything or like god really needs me to build a church or god really needs me to build a house you know god really don't need you to do that he may lead you to do that but that's not why your hands are there it's not like he needs you right the bible says that he says seeing he gives to all life right and breath and all things see so it's not we must not think much more of ourselves right we should not be prideful what we can do because god's the one who gave us the ability to do that god's the one who's extended our lives god's one that's protected our lives he's given us our health our strength it's all from god amen nothing to brag about he's made one blood of all nations men for to dwell in the face all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation i'll mention this a little bit on sunday that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us so let's just again just go through these a little slower here god determined your time before he appointed the time of your life so don't ever feel well i'm younger than everybody it's bad for me don't feel that way you're younger for a purpose or i'm older than everybody oh i don't like being older no no be happy god did it for a purpose amen god determined your time the bible said the hairs of your head are numbered and the bible said the years are numbered as well your days are numbered amen god knows the number of your days like i did that funeral last last last month the man was given 56 years that was all he's given that's how many years brother branham was given 56 years right we don't know how many years we've been given but we should invest those years like we like we don't know how many and we want to make sure every year counts for jesus amen god knows the time god knows the season amen god determines those things he determined your time and he determined where you live amen hallelujah all right football brought me here but it was not all about football football got discouraging real fast all right all my hopes and my injuries and everything that i ended up everything real fast uh but see god brought me here to preach the gospel amen god brought me here to try to rescue souls from hell praise god to try to set the captive free amen now just let me share this testimony real quick remember i preached on the minister's marriage requirements a few wednesdays ago well i got an email yesterday and i'm not gonna say the brother's name he's a preacher in the message he said i just want to tell you now my wife can probably quote it better than i cause i can't even see the picture right now in my mind but he said i've struggled with this for years i've never told a soul about it in the world he said and then i watched your video and what do you say hon a cloud lifted off of him amen and he said something like he had no more bondage didn't use the word bondage bondage so church you know we're just we're just preaching away we're just putting god's word out there and god's word cannot return void amen amen this man is in other words he's been enslaved with the complex for decades oh but the holy spirit knew he sent that word out it might have wandered around there on the internet for a while and all of a sudden it came up on his phone i think i'll tap that and as he watched it tears flow and the devil lifts and now he's free in christ amen and we get to experience that right in person amen but sometimes god's only way to do it is to send it through a video on youtube or vimeo or whatever it is sometimes that's only god's way sometimes it's a written piece of paper a track that gets you knowledge about jesus christ and that says oh i got to be baptized the right way praise the lord amen sometimes it's a preacher spitting all over the place not on purpose but sometimes it's a video on youtube sometimes we don't know but god has a way to direct his word god determined your lifespan where you'd be and he brought the word right to your lap amen so you do what accept it rejoice in it love it thank god for it and be free and serve god with all your heart soul mind and strength amen and then the next day for the same video i get somebody telling me i'm going to hell and i'm serpentied i just said may god forgive you one day somebody gets set free by it the next day i'm called a devil well that's nothing new people been calling me devil for a long time but i know i love jesus amen i know my life is a life that's not a corrupt tree it's a incorruptible tree i see you you all see the works of my life praise god church your life speaks so loud i can't even hear what you're testifying about and the church said our life what we do is more than what we say how we treat others is more than what we say our life speaks louder than anything and thank god that the life of christ speaks it thunders out through our lives amen the voice of christ thunders out through our lives people feel the love people see the genuine sincerity people see the real christian character it thunders god's voice speaks through our lives actions always speak louder than words like i told austin that testimony we were getting lydia that that debit card remember that lydia and we're like it was like an hour-long meeting i'm like does it take an hour to get a debit card can somebody help me out around here you know they got to sign all these papers you know sign your life away whatever you know they say thank god it hasn't been signed away though uh but anyways in the middle of it she just stops and she said oh you're that preacher remember that lydia she said you're that preacher on a sunday i couldn't it was too cold and i was pumping up the air in my tire and i i couldn't uh i couldn't get the air in and she said you drove up in your big van she's like do you have a big van i'm like yeah i got a pretty big van people call it a tank no he said you got out and you had a suit on she's like she said do you wear suits on sunday like pretty much every sunday and she said yeah i had to be you i'm like i don't think it was me she's like no it had to be you and she said you got down there and blew up my tire she said and i couldn't do it and it's all filled up and i just want to thank you for doing that i thought well i don't even know if that was me but even if it wasn't me look how god meets people's needs right where they need it praise god something as simple as it's cold and i can't put air in my tire i'm going to be uh i'm going to be in danger grounds you know if i don't have air in my tire and god will send somebody around to help you at just the right time at just the right moment with just the right enough strength because he cares so much about you he loves you so much and if god remember if that woman remember that how much more does god remember that amen praise god you know you're you have a certain habitation you have a certain boundaries where god wants you to live and never think a little of it because that's what they had in the days of joshua god gave them a boundary god gave them a place to live and their desire their their their their requirement was just to thank god for it and not learn the ways of the heathen praise god amen just live god live godly and don't learn the ways of the heathen take no idols into your home don't worship idols worship christ only that was all the requirement just put god first hallelujah and if they did that so god gave you a time to seek him he gave you a place to seek him and if you would do that the bible says you will touch and feel god's power amen how many touched god's power before praise god he'll give you a blessing austin was telling me about naomi when you spoke in tongues that last time he was there he said he always remembers that see what the impact that and i told him the testimony behind that see every prayer god hears amen he may not answer it when you want but he's going to answer it praise god especially the ones that are heart cries amen desires of the heart god will answer just give god some time amen just wait upon the lord keep reaching after him and say god i i need a god with skin on preaching you're going to find a good brother or sister you can hug amen now brothers you're not going to hug any sisters now sisters don't don't you hug no brothers now unless it's your wife or your husband you see but you're going to be long oh god i need you and pretty soon god's going to answer your requests and you're going to know i've touched the heart of god amen i know god's real i know he called me right here i know he's with me amen that's what the bible says god determined your time your place so you would reach out and touch god because he's not far from every one of us remember that on sunday church remember that on sunday that picture oh i love that picture look where god placed the uh you see remember that where god look where god placed those cities of refuge totally spread out so everybody can reach it praise god you might not have been the fastest runner in high school you might not have run the st you not you might not have won the state championship like some people it's just god's grace that i want it but i'm just saying there's no excuse these are close to everybody god is not far from any of us the only requirement is run until you're safe in christ amen the only requirement is run he's not far from you he's near to you reach out after him try to touch him in prayer amen try to touch him in your prayer closet as you pray and read your bible come up for prayer until god answers do something try to reach out and touch the lord as he passes by amen you'll find he's not too busy to hear your hearts cry he's not far from any of us the devil makes us think it because we're not spending enough time in the word right or we're discouraged or we're sick or something like that he makes us think that but that's not the case the bible said he is not far from any of us usually church he's just a one one breath away right you're in a you're you're gonna get a car accident you say jesus and he helps you out he's just one breath away amen he's got playing time he can slow down things he can slow down time he can send his angels down there he can just change the whole situation right i saw some youtube videos about that it looked like kids were gonna get run over and i think it was on facebook a couple years ago and the kid just does a flip and the truck misses him and they said this is proof of angels i'm like that's exactly right what it was that's a the kid probably couldn't even cry out to god he probably didn't have time to think about it i mean just all these amazing testimonies that you see god wants to be called upon amen god wants you to reach out and try to touch him and try to feel him god i want to touch your heart tonight i really need an answer to my request god would you hear me but you got to call out the bible said you got to feel after him amen can't just sit there and say god do something you got to feel you got to show god that you mean business and you believe in him and you know he's there praise god amen you've got to show that you believe his word amen he's not far from any of us he determined you and i to be in akron to serve its purpose think about all the cities you could have been in and god called you to akron right austin stomping grounds we call it by god's grace his stomping grounds where he was born and raised here at akron and they told me you want to play football in akron i'm like i don't know where akron is you know i didn't even what is akron i don't even know what it is and i found out there's two of them there's one in pennsylvania too there's probably more than that actually but you know god has a purpose god has a season a reason to do something and we've got to trust the hand of the lord and be content in what god's doing now here's the scripture i read levites had no portion among you for the priest of the lord is their inheritance right so all the other all the other peoples all the other tribes got to have lands and build houses now can i just modernize it swimming pools nice cars they got you know nice furniture the nicest clothes but the levites all they got was a little place to live they had a little bit of of of of land for the cattle the bible said and that's it they didn't get acres upon acres upon acres you know in other words they didn't they didn't become you know multi-millionaires overnight with all this land and all this all these possessions they were just given the very basics of life amen and they were given access to god amen thank god amen lord give me the basics of life and but along with that give me your blessing give me a ministry in the presence of god amen and i'll be happy praise god amen don't don't give me houses or lands or just give me what i need and give me a relationship with you that everybody else wants to have amen can i say like that or everybody envies brother man said the israel envied um aaron every time he got to walk in there and the presence of god and remember when cam preached they'd hear the pomegranates going back and forth saying holy holy holy unto the lord he had a certain walk about him praise god he had a certain testimony he had to have a certain routine that he followed in order for the prince of god to be pleased praise god that's what we do we live in such a way where it pleases god and we get to go in god's presence and we get to enjoy god's spirit here in our homes and it's nothing that we should take for granted we should be thankful and we should live holy so it happens more amen hallelujah so that's your inheritance got the very basics of life but you get to be a priest unto god amen and unto christ oh what a blessing church they had brother adam says when god was setting an order he said all you levites i've called you out and made you priests and all your brethren and other 12 tribes and the other 11 tribes will pay you a tithing said moses moses for your part i'm yours and he also said the same to aaron right oh my he said i'm your satisfying portion and that's what the holy ghost is to the church today in other words we should be satisfied we should we should be more than satisfied with god's presence amen being baptized with the holy ghost is more than enough satisfaction satisfaction than all the money riches and houses and lands and relationships and it's more than enough it's plenty satisfying to be a holy ghost christian amen in 2021 praise god amen what have they got that i don't got natural things but what do i got that they don't got i got a lot i got jesus amen i got a conscience where i know if i meet him he'll say well done praise god amen hallelujah i've been sold out to china right i've been sold out to the government i've been sold out to the irs i've been sold out to to worldly things we've been true to christ we've been faithful to christ we've made him our number one we've made him our portion amen we've made him our all in all and so we know when we see him he will be pleased he'll receive us amen and there's no question what will happen when we come in the presence of god but there is a lot of questions when compromisers come in the prince of god that's where the question's at the bible calls them workers of iniquity is that right and the way to know is their works because they're either workers of righteousness or workers of iniquity so all you have to do is watch a man's words and watch his works hallelujah that's why i told brother austin a real christian he'll work but man said the real christian will work a real sister will work for the kingdom of god work for their family work work because they know they're not doing it for themselves they're doing it for god i tell you we started up that bible club again we finally got to start the bible club so this will be our friday will be our our third meeting and i'm there at 8 am in the morning we're dancing and we're praising god and worshiping god right there in the school i said jesus we're back amen we're back amen preaching to just 30 kids but we're still there still hearing the gospel they're still hearing that god is a miracle working god amen you know i tell all your testimonies to them did you know that naomi i tell your beatrice i tell you children i tell all your testimonies of them praise god i'm preaching your testimony to them amen god healed bang's dad i told that i'm going to tell that testimony that's right because it happened while we had a break that's what they did they would sell their gold and silver and pass it out to everybody that's what they do in the book of acts church he said silver gold have i none but i have a satisfying portion hallelujah education i can't hardly read this book but i got a satisfying portion amen don't judge yourself if you don't have a college degree don't judge yourself god don't need you to have a college degree that's right god needs you to have a heart that loves him and wants to serve him that wants to be faithful praise god now if you're going to earn one like our sister earn one do the best you can like i did i have a i have a master's degree plus like 40 to 40 credits after a master's degree they told me you should go for a doctorate i'm like i'm not going for a doctorate that's the last thing i need is more school i'm tired of school i'm 41. i don't need more school i've been going to school more than half of my life i don't want no more school what am i going to be a doctor in any way you know i was just ridiculous uh he said doctor's degree don't have any phds llds nothing else but there's one thing that i have church there's one thing that you need there's one thing that i need one thing we should have the presence of god as our portion amen hallelujah let everybody have everything else you just have god's approval god's love and obedience to god that should satisfy you if not you've got your eyes off the most important things in life cause pretty soon guess what if the lord tarries we're all gonna have to go to the funeral service and we're the ones that are gonna be there in the gasket then what are you going to say about your life what what did you do with your life i made christ my portion like i told the family i said if i ever go to the grave you make sure you read isaiah 53 at my funeral because he was wounded church for my transgressions praise god he was bruised for my iniquities the chastisement of my peace was upon him but with his stripes i was healed amen glory and because he healed me i live for him now and he saved me and i live with him eternally praise god because he healed my soul praise god he said that's the part i want that's the part god wants you to have [Applause] throw the rest of the old things away all the prestige and everything else and walk out and get god's satisfying portion isn't that what moses did yeah moses and of course he was a murderer but before that he basically already decided i don't i don't need to take the throne of egypt i'm going to take the way i'm going to stand up for god's people think about that turning down all those women all that money all that power the military the authority that he would have had he first the bible said he forsook that the pleasures of egypt to walk with god's anointed ones amen oh thank god amen any little thing you give up anyway god's gonna give you a hundred fold more praise god amen your perspective just has to change right change how you're seeing it see how god sees it amen like i said the most precious things in life are not things you can buy like brother man said where can i go buy a bottle of love i need some love where can i go buy a bottle of patience because i really like to get some right go give me some long suffering for these people that call me serpent seed i could really use some long suffering you can't get it anywhere all you can get it is in prayer amen all you can get is in in the presence of god in surrendering to god because when you surrender fully he comes in fully praise god amen the most valuable things in life are the things you cannot buy even the things you cannot see praise god it's the invisible things the eternal things of god god's character being molded into your life that's the most valuable things in life amen because what you've got of this earth you'll leave here when you leave right i saw that guy at that funeral he had all his uh he was a big football fan he had notre dame football on laying there in the casket everything was notre dame football i thought oh my that was his portion that's what he loved i don't know i asked god to be merciful to his soul god will be i know that god's faithful all those pictures it's all sports it's all notre dame that was his portion in life church you know what a valuable thing it is when people can write your obituary and say they went and saw their lord and savior jesus christ and i mean really mean it i mean mean it like they loved god they served god they were devoted to god they prayed to god they knew god amen remember brother f said he went to that that uh that house there in uh uh atlanta georgia i think it was no uh tennessee i can't remember of the the the black woman whoever her son was dying of the of the the std and he said he said you pray i want to hear you pray and he said when she prayed he said it was the most powerful prayer he'd heard amen he said you could tell she'd prayed to god before amen she said i felt more welcome in that old broken down home than all these mega churches and all these you know what i'm talking about all these million dollar buildings because that's a home that knew the love of god she needed god she believed in god and god was there amen and he proved it by healing the boy of his std amen oh thank god amen as i was telling brother austin where's our greatest meetings we've ever had been they're usually just humble little meetings the greatest miracles i've seen are with the poor people guyana trinidad mostly guyana trinidad's got more they got a better economy but the greatest miracles i've ever seen is with those guyanese that they only have electricity they got a generator and that makes the electricity sometimes they don't even have running water saints and where do i see the power of god right there right there not that we've had awesome testimonies here too but on the on the on the number and the multitude and how fast they they multiply that's where i've seen the power of god where the people are humble right now we need to be more humble praise god amen and god's going to help us do it you know god's got a way to brother man said if he said if you're a stone he's got a way to smooth out the stones you got to rub those stones together sometimes i'm going to rub you the wrong way sometimes you're going to rub me the wrong way but it's god smoothing out the stones to try to get them nice and smooth don't leave now don't leave just because we rubbed each other a little bit every so every ch you're going to rub somebody somewhere everywhere just know that it's making you more like jesus amen didn't all the disciples didn't jesus rub all the disciples they say why you boys arguing about who's greater let me show you who's great little jimmy come over here sit on my knee he said you got to become like a child to enter the kingdom of heaven that's my jesus amen amen he rebuked them for arguing who's greater and the greatest among you is the servants so let me encourage you again for 2022 try to find a way to serve people amen yes serve your family first of course serve god when you do that when you serve your family it's serving god first but find someone to serve because the only way you become great with god is by serving other people that's right he said you've got to leave here when you get here but if you've got this satisfying portion it'll take you up just as certain so if you get god's portion now that portion will lift you up into heaven when you die but if you don't get god's portion here the angels are going to take you down to hell right of course we're talking to everybody listening in too we're always taking out insurance i love this today to give to the undertaker let's get god's satisfying portion and get the uptaker instead of the undertaker you know they both work and the church said right we're always paying life insurance and which is basically death insurance right death insurance but we need to get eternal life assurance that's what we need today we need assurance that when we die or if we die we'll go to heaven praise god how do you get that by saying lord jesus you're my portion you're what i really want in life if i don't have anything else if i'm like a levite and i'll have all these lands and i don't have all these great things to brag about as long as i got you jesus i'll be happy with that because i know that's my uptaker and i only go up into heaven praise god i don't want to go to hell i want to see jesus amen i need to uptake her praise god amen let me say like this you get to uptake her tonight you get to uptake her anytime you can get the uptake or any time amen when you repent and obey god's word he'll come in there and you'll know somebody come in me because i feel i feel raised up praise god i feel the quickening power of god in my life amen now i want to read i got a few my portion quotes look at the brother man talked about his portion was christ i just got two of them here just bear with me i don't have them up here i kind of ran out of time today at work but so let me see if i can pull them up here okay well this one updates so forgive me don't strain your eyes here i'm just going to unplug it for just a second i'll be back here because i want you to strain your eyes i feel for your eyes you don't want to ruin your eyes brother ram said in 1960 uh i know he said uh the bible says trials are brought upon us and are more precious to us than gold itself so let me just use austin alina real quick the trials you guys are facing now they're going to be more precious to you than gold if you can go through them and still love god and serve god and wait on god your character will be so much closer to christ's character amen right like our sick people you know uh covered i'd covered last year you know brother amen's got it now i can't wait to talk about the amen i saw him on saturday but i didn't get a chance to talk to him very long you know uh i surprised him i come in there with my big jesus hat on you know i got two masks on i never wear two masks i got this green thing on me covered and she said put it on i'm like okay i'll put it on so i'm walking there like hey relay man probably scared him half to death you know maybe helped his heart pump a little harder you know but uh i just want to encourage him you know maybe he's listening here tonight or maybe he's wrestling but maybe he'll listen to it on the on the live stream but but the bible says we suffer that we might learn obedience now all of us need to obey god better i'm not going to ask you if you need to do it i need to do it we all need to do it praise god amen but i suffered last year with covet different ones suffering now my mom did my brother paul they really suffered with way more than i did but god allows these things so we'll come out on the other end i can't wait to ask our brother brother what do you think god's trying to teach you through this laying in the bed for two weeks is no fun i've never done that wow so think about what you learned okay i'll give you a minute here we learn obedience through the things we suffer suffering is the best teacher i know it's hard to say that church but that's the truth amen suffering is the best teacher like when i'm always when i'm sick i'm like my goodness i can't wait till i get with hell they're healthy i'm gonna go do this and that and then i do and i feel really really good like i said as soon as i get well i'm gonna go make youtube videos i made i think i made six so far since i got better i just recorded three more this morning so it gave me a zeal like i'm gonna i'm gonna work harder for jesus amen try to set some of these captives free out there online you know yeah right but brother ram says it's more precious than gold your trials you go through because then brother austin you got a testimony afterwards can you imagine if we could fast forward one year what would that awesome next year just come back and say to you right now he'd say austin he said he would say you keep pressing you come so far in your walk with god you know your yourself would say the same to you you've come so far just keep pressing the battles god's going to do this god's going to do that god's going to he's going to show you all these great things and and you can't wait till you get to the next year amen you might even say you're going to get the holy ghost this year somebody say something like that or next year you know and that's eternal life praise god that's a satisfying portion amen that's what we all need that's what we all desire a portion of god's eternal life in our souls that makes everything insignificant but makes god great amen amen and keeps him at his highly esteemed position in our lives he's the object of our life that's why we've got to teach preach to these young teenagers don't let that next husband or wife the husband right don't let that become the object of your life make jesus the object of your life and then if it's his will he'll bring the right one at the right time amen don't go chasing them like you've seen some of our friends do don't do that that'll mess you up real fast hallelujah make christ your portion make christ your inheritance your possession whether how much money you got in your pockets tonight well my pockets i mean i got a wallet over there i got three pens in my pocket that's my possession right now right and no matter what's in your pocket what's in your purse don't worry about that matter what's in your soul care about what do you possess in your soul do i have eternal life in my soul am i a believer or not make sure above all things make sure you got that amen make sure you've got eternal life in your soul that's your portion amen brother braham said after we become god's property our confession our baptism and our promise to walk in life for him then every trial that comes upon us is to perfect us for his glory it's to bring us to a place where god can make himself more real to us than he was before the trial came amen hallelujah i want to join this morning with job think about this brother ram's joining job and say i've lived long enough to know that's that that's the truth i've seen it in my own life that every time a great situation rises that i can't get around i can't get under it i can't get over it god makes a way and comes out glorious i just wonder how his grace ever does it but he does it church what are you facing today that you can't get over that you can't get under it you can't get around it get through it trust god with it put it in god's hands because you know he can get over it you know he can get under it you can know he can break through it amen you can know he can knock it out of the way he can blow it he can say peace be still and everything will be still our god specializes in removing obstacles amen hallelujah give him a chance to do it though don't go running the devil for your comfort run to god for your portion amen amen and remember in all these things satan is trying to make us nervous and upset us to get us to think oh why did this happen why couldn't i have been like this see satan always wants to make the grass look greener on the other side but really on the other side there is no grass right because satan has transformed himself as an angel of light an angel of making grass there is no grass on the other side that's the devil's side you got in other words you're in the best spot you've ever been right now and the church said if you're walking obedience to jesus christ your grass is greener than it's ever been and it's only gonna get greener praise god can i say it like that amen hallelujah just trust god just trust god that makes me think of something let me see did i miss something here okay no i didn't okay let me let me finish this quote here okay now brother ram tells the story in 1963 or i'm sorry oral roberts opened his college but it was building for three years brother brandon visited in tulsa oklahoma and he said he was walking around saying my goodness he said he said they're going to have this many times like a thousand typewriters and all these things he said i would hate to see them for them to see my office i only have one typewriter and he said he started kind of feeling bad the devil said see god couldn't trust you with this you know you're not smart enough to handle all these typewriters i mean now who is mercy who i mean which you could handle 100 computers you have to go to school to handle that right but who's smart enough to do that nobody's smart enough to do that here right and the devil's like see you know you're nobody god can't trust you and he said he started to kind of agree with the devil yeah yeah yeah maybe god couldn't trust me and brother man i said all of a sudden it sounded like heaven opened up and the corridors of heaven became open and a voice came down and said don't worry i am your portion amen seeing this huge multi-million dollar building and he didn't have one he started feeling sorry for himself and look how god and his mercy come to encourage him see you church when you're battling that's when god's going to help you out amen when you're struggling and you feel insignificant like you wasted your life that's when god's going to come around and say no you've done exactly what i told you to do you've been obeying the word of god and i'm your portion amen don't try to copy them just be what i called you to be praise god you know what oral roberts started out as a mighty man of god but i think he fell away in 1987 he said god told me you've got to send me 8 million or god's going to take me off the scene no i don't see that in the bible do you see that in the bible when did joshua say you better send all your gold and silver to me or god's going to kill me nonsense nonsense i was watching some videos about him i'm like oh my goodness he said the lord he said he saw a 90-foot vision or 90-foot jesus in a vision said you're going to build this hospital and you need all these millions of dollars to do it it's going to be a successful hospital they built it only lasted for eight years and went bankrupt now was that really jesus i don't think so church i wouldn't say i wouldn't say for sure i'm not saying for sure but i'm saying all these fruits and what is that money money money and brother brown was being discouraged but god came around and said don't worry about the money worry about the souls worry about the word make sure you've got the true word of god that's what's most important don't worry about trying to have so many thousand dollars per day like he said don't worry about the number of typewriters worry about the number of prayers amen worry about the number of souls saved praise god worry about the gospel worry about your life examine your life to make sure you're in the faith hallelujah and did you know oral roberts ordained what's that guy's name that he tried to rebuke covet kenneth copeland he ordained kenneth copeland to take his place and look at that guy he's probably one of the most devil possessed people out there he said he's rebuked coven and it was going to go away in the name of jesus it didn't happen he calls himself a prophet and it don't happen see look what comes out of a person's life if you don't keep christ as your portion what are you gonna say you get a million dollar house what are you gonna say i got a million dollars house what's god going to say on the day of judgment what'd you do with it what what'd you do why did you want it well then what'd you do with it how did you glorify me with these or were these earthly worldly things how did you glorify me everybody understand by god's grace he said you're right lord he said but as long as you're my portion i'm yours and you will leave me i could not lead myself but oh lord lead me don't lead me to riches lord lead me to your will i don't care how humble it is i've always prayed that i say lord i'd rather be humble with a tiny small church as long as there's no sin in the church and the holy ghost can move whenever he wants i'd rather have the purity and no sin and no adulterers or fornicators or liars or effeminate or adulterers or anything i'd rather have just pure holy ghosts living in the church i'd rather have all that praise god than all the money or popularity anything like that all we want is christ here i told you i've talked to people recently in the message with big churches and they said we don't even feel love in our church but we felt it when we came to your church now what does that speak that speaks that the love of god is created by an atmosphere of people who love righteousness and hate sin amen and you can feel it when you walk in oh thank god can you feel the love of god tonight i know i got some strange faces i don't mean to be so you know i don't need to be so like crazy you know man sometimes i ball out sin you know i just gotta just ball it out you know like a ah it just makes me mad the um i think we call it the zeal of the lord so i think of what we call it praise god sometimes it just burns me up you know like i can't i can't stand that the way people act but remember people feel the love of god here we've got to keep it that way amen because you can have a little church and god ain't there too so let's not pat ourselves on the back just yet let's not ever pat ourselves on the back let's just take up our cross and let our cross pat us on the back i like that that's i didn't think of that before that's good thank you jesus let's let our crosses pat us on the back take up the cross and follow jesus i got two minutes left on my hour so um let me try to find a place to close okay you can go back up here to the uh to the slides here let me close here give me give me five let me put five or ten minutes on here thank you church for your patience here tonight are you enjoying the word tonight amen praise god hallelujah such a blessing to be in god's house let's go to this thought here the chapter goes through all 48 cities right it names the cities and all the tribes that get them but it ends with this beautiful portion now to understand this you have to understand god is talking to joshua at the very end of his life he's almost 110 years old he died at 110. he spent the first 39 years in egypt can you imagine that he was in the world for almost 40 years and then he spent the next 40 years wandering in the wilderness out in tents can you imagine that he went from slave labor right to kind of desert life and then by the grace of god this is beautiful it's kind of it's kind of broke up like moses is three stages of his life too that by the power of god he takes the church into the baptism holy ghost i mean canaan he takes them into the canaan's land and they start driving out every demon power and all the 31 kings and he gets to live in there and battle in there for 31 years of his life i've been serving god since 2000 basically i got saved right then of 1999. so i've served god for almost 21 years he had 31 years in the promised land and at the end of his years here's what's written about god's faithfulness to joshua this is chapter 21 the end of it the last three verses and the lord gave unto israel all the land which he swear to given to their fathers in other words god whatever god promised he did it if god promised you something god's going to do it amen amen and they possessed it and dwelt therein all those years of dreaming about it all those years of hoping maybe this is year they were over and now they weren't dreaming about it they were experiencing it amen they were it was reality to them amen sometimes we get so tired of talking about the rapture don't we or this squeeze it was something nice to see i i don't know i don't know about you but i do sometimes sometimes i get so tired the squeeze that's because we're just human but one of these days it ain't going to be no more dreaming about it or hoping about it it's going to be here and then will the true bride of jesus christ stand up and i will say yes lord here we are we're waiting all these years take us in to that last anointing take us in to the lateran anointing they may force the bride to stop preaching publicly but shall keep preaching privately and that's where god will meet her in that little tent in that little special place and the secret place says god will quicken her mortal body and they won't be talking about it anymore but they'll be experienced just like joshua all those years talking about it but finally they started possessing it and everything god said came to pass think about that we've already heard the shout one of these days the voice of the archangel is gonna sound don't worry about it you'll recognize it because if you can hear this word if you've got ears to hear trust me you'll hear that trumpet amen don't worry about it the voice of the archangel we've talked about it we've talked about the trump of god and the dead in christ arise first don't worry about it you just keep pressing toward every promise god made god is going to fulfill all heaven and earth can pass away and god's word still won't fail god is going to back up his word god is faithful god is not a man that he would lie praise god god's not a politician that he would lie god is a man he's a holy man he's faithful amen amen and finally they experienced it for 31 years now of course part of that 31 years was battling and the lord gave them rest round about after killing 31 kings he could finally lay the sword down and let's just say 50 he could enjoy 15 years of peace with his family and then it was time to say so long i'm going the way of all the earth but before i go let me tell you god keeps all of his word amen before i die let me tell you god never failed me how many want that testimony really you really want that testimony then be like joshua be strong in the lord and the power of his might be of good courage church jesus said be of courage because i've overcome the world amen amen praise god amen the world your the world has already been beat today man you just got to trust god and jesus will walk you through all your victories amen he's already defeated the world you just got to let him defeat in your life he gave them rest according to all that they swear to their fathers and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them one guy emailed me and said i heard how you said that you that you i fell down at your feet and i haven't emailed him back yet because i'm waiting on the lord but anybody knows i wasn't talking about natural falling at my feet i never even seen the man he just came up in a debate the point i was making his spiritual his evil spirit that was trying to stand before me it couldn't convince me to leave the truth and i stood there and that spirit left that's what i was saying the lies fell at my feet not the man the lies amen by the truth and sell it not praise god that's what we know if we keep god's word no man no lie no demon will be able to stand before us all the days of our lives and you'll stand for jesus christ when other times other people might have fallen you'll stand these people don't have to follow my feet i could care less about that it's their lies and their uh their false doctrines and their temptations and their devils that's what's going to fall at my feet amen the lord delivered all their enemies into their hand hallelujah they're failed not ought of any good thing which the lord had spoken to israel and all came to pass how many want that testimony amen everything the lord told me has come to pass you know we've seen that song every promise in the book is mine well not exactly right it kind of depends how you what if god don't want to hear you then is that promise yours what paul said three times lord take away this devil and the lord said no my grace is sufficient well i thought every promise in the book was his you see there's times and seasons now next time we've seen that y'all gonna be like should we sing this well jesse when are you gonna leave this off the the the easy worship that's not what i'm saying let me say like this every promise in the book to you is yours but it's got to be to you think about it two thousand years of christians have died thinking they'd be the ones that go in the rapture that promise wasn't to them where they'd be changed in the moment drinking alive they've got to go by the grave and the dead in christ will rise first so let's be careful what we're thinking about sometimes right church i want to say that that god brought me into the baptism holy ghost i battled battle battled and then i enjoyed my seasons of rest and i can say that god was faithful to everything god gave me every good thing that i needed amen not one thing he said ever failed not one thing i asked

obstacle that you can't get around you can't get under you can't get over you can't go through remember your trials god allowed them so that means god is going to bring you through them the bible said

you'll gain more love for god going through the trial than you would if you didn't go through the trial and you learn more when we suffer when i suffer when you suffer we learn more than if we don't suffer glory i love that song take this whole world but give me jesus let him be my portion how many want to say that lord jesus be my portion tonight let me pray for your church if there's something
