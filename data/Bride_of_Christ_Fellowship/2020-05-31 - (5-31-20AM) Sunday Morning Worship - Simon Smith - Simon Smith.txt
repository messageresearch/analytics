TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] our saints let's uh I don't have the best memory in the world so we're trying to sing uh spider wings to the winds of fate I'm not a song leader I'm just here to worship well start with a song there are two [Music] [Music] [Music] what yes watch watch eagle in the sky [Music] for the power [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] yes based on love your teeth hey man freeze God isn't he good I was looking at Eagles and looking at the difference of a vulture how they fly you know of all true his wings go like this like a little bee but he goes the straight they said that's how you can tell is it once flying or you can tell if it's eagle or not as a them wings are straight like an arrow that's that's like a breeze but of course we know they go down they go stay all year round and the vultures will head to down south for the winner there they moved the warmth there anyhow I thought about maybe let's sing a Heavenly Father you know that we have a father we appreciate you I don't know the names these I just know keywords maybe there's a person back there trying to throw it to me [Music] the guys like I said I'm not a song leader by trade or my gift but by the grace of God we're gonna listen my pastor back home wasn't preaching on on chosing choosing to approach God and if we are kings and priests our worship reflects how we treat them how we love them and just got done preaching on the bells and tomogram is hanging from the skirt their high priest and those things were always making noise all always just worshiping God and just praising God in the midst of it every trial every father so we want to encourage you to worship the Lord the best you can't feel free this is the house of God we assemble on Sundays and Wednesdays to it to worship Him so let's sing this song here we do have a song special here maybe next and so the start of this year heavenly [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this would be wonderful yes oh Jesus thank you without the leadership of the Holy Ghost for would it be this week I had a tremendous trial I woke up one day I think I believe it was a Thursday morning I woke up and I I woke up and the room was spinning and I got dizzy now it's about ready to pass out and I was like how am I go to work but by the grace of God I just drove right to work and the guy is instantly realized there was something wrong with me if I would just go like that I'd almost fall over but I had to pray through I didn't COFF work I learned something a long time ago from brother ray Hernandez from church near her Sheffield he said whatever kind of situation come into you say it's not real and I went on and worked first break I went in my truck for the 15 minute nap a little bit better I kept working and working working at lunch I went skip lunch actually the meat I went and took a nap for half an hour got up and I finished the entire day because what this is not how I feel that that determines anything that is the devil trying to inflict this body but I was saying here that day I had to go to work because I have to pay my bills and we press through it and after that I went and changed a thermostat for somebody and you don't 11 o'clock p.m. and I felt just horrible but the next day I woke up that was good to go amen so anyhow let's say a word of Prayer then after that we're gonna have sister Wendy come up and give a song special god bless her for that as a prayer question anyone have any special prayer requests we all have loved ones maybe a need upcoming battles we want to be ready for the rapture there's many many things coming up we see the world seen how it's becoming just unrest I mean we're at war at the end time saying to God if I had to explain if I had to guess or if I had to make a presumption I would say this is we aren't we have arrived to these things are moving and as they say it's then we're coming to the new normal what does that tell you what are they telling us this thing is going to continue to get worse and worse and we are now we had better make sure we have the oil so unspoken prayer requests maybe Lord willing anything special because you can speak up if you want or whatever we're not sister Wendy has a request it says my mom just had a knee surgery please play pray for a full recovery i immense will keep time prayer precious brother there at our church brother mike.mccluskey he gets infections in his kidney and he was he goes down for the count and he by the grace of God he asked prayer requests on the brothers whatsapp gathering Eagles we called sight and he said please pray for me the brothers went in for prayer and he didn't feel pain for the first time in intoed for two full days he had no pain which for if you know his situation it's very very painful when he got shot in the back of those nerves are all not together and when they strike at whatever whatever would cause that nerve to hit it would hit his muscle and it would jerk it so he's like fighting constantly all day long it's that bad so but by the prayer of the saints of God he did not feel any pain for two days so let's bow our heads if you have any prayer quest just lift your hands up unspoken or however and it will approach the high priest Jesus Christ you're highly father Lord king of kings and Lord of lords the great almighty god and lo we are so thankful Northey you

alright we did our best I think we'll get into service by the grace of God will go into I have two thoughts here and I'm just kind of leaning on which way to go and thank you brother Malachi for helping your feeble uncle out here by the grace of God let me set up here idea of power point for you sorry we had some hindrances on the way here didn't have gas in the car in the morning and we stopped there and then the pump won't work then I ran in the lady was hiding in the beer cave and it just took a long time and then I was through Clyde Ohio and hit a train and waited there for a while and then finally had to do some bypass action so I was a little struggle getting here but we may hit by the grace of God Oh Barry's doing good Pennsylvania sings amen amen Hollis awesome I remember you guys but I cannot place pull the names so please forgive me all right here we go I have a couple of thoughts here and God is good and you won't have a testimony this morning they'd like to share anything God's done for you or kept us and I want to give another test a little testimony this morning my cousin Adam showed up we had our men's true change study last night and my cousin Adam showed up again and that brother is just he is on fire for the Lord he cannot fully really come to our assembly yet due to certain situations but he is feasting on the message of the hour eyewitness tune back in the end of 2000 or the beginning of 2000 no no I'm sorry I'm so sorry it was the end of 2001 I witnessed to him with serpent seed I gave him a tape and we work in different shifts at the same job and I said Adam I want you to listen to this he said absolutely sad was I you listened that tape I come back in the next shift for it was my turn and we we saw each other again and I said what do you think he said Simon he goes I'm a son of God and from that point the devil inflicted him with drugs and he was a junkie for 19 years 19 solid years and our family over there knows the story and just last year God fully delivered him he was living on the streets lost his wife his children he had a painting business he lost that and God started moving on his life and he's fully delivered right now and he knows what we believe because we witnessed him so many times and he said Simon he goes I didn't come to you guys his church because I wanted God to lead me there if that was the truth and he went to denomination two big Church mega church this lessness and he got a little curious you know he's like well they're good preachers they're good preachers and he's uh he started listening to a couple brother branham's sermons and he said all the rest are trash all the rest they're false ministers he said and then I'll get this he's been listening to those tapes for almost four months now solid he's a painter now by trade and he puts your phones on earbuds in and just plays tapes constantly and he he he tried to us do a switch he said you know I'm just gonna listen to music this week and he started listening to music for a whole week and Amir buds and he by the end of the week he said something felt really wrong and he wasn't feeling good and he's lost his joy and he's like what's going on Lord he's trying to community uh you know prayed to the Lord as he works he's trying to do all those things and the Holy Ghost came to him said you're not feeding me so he tried to do all these worship songs and worship music during the week and this NAT and as soon as he got back to listening to those tapes for eight hours a day this guy is eating eight hours a day the message he said he said his soul his joy got revival and he is just in fact if you would just if you knew him like I knew him the last eighteen years and what the things he has done and you don't you understand but God God knows all things and he came last night and he was having it just a tremendous time by the grace of God and asking questions it was me brother cam and Jesse so we're and then all the rest of the brothers there have fellowshipping over the word and the God opened up a couple things it was absolutely fantastic so let me see if I can find a little the one I'm thinking here I have something here oh maybe the Lord does want me to teach that one so let's go what I have pulled up let's see if we got we got it already praise the Lord so I'll stand here and let's pull from the Word of God sorry I'm not like what you would maybe consider a normal Minister I'm actually just kind of like a little teacher we do Bible studies we do our best a witness we just had one last week with a young man from a sister our church her son one of the Bible say but went there did that and by the grace of God it was a really good time and II felt good afterwards so the schools have really infiltrated our youth the public schools and they've swayed obviously evolution and they brought that thought in and and thank the Lord that the Bible does contain many many creation scriptures as far as proofs things they have just now found out brother Jesse just shared with us last night that 2015 science now has found out that snakes have DNA or genetics for legs and arms of God even left full evidence and a witness that the serpent originally could walk and talk so science is just catching up with what we have right here so let's turn to Genesis 1 verse 1 I taught this back home not my last service but the Lord opened this or not opened it up he just showed this to me one day and I started thinking on it and thinking on it and I thought it was something that we should teach so Genesis 1 and verse 1 in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the sky to face the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters now notice what Christ God says here and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening in the morning were the first day so let's say a word of Prayer as we dive into this thought dear friendly father Lord Jesus Lord and you know Lord maybe how unprepared Lord I am Lord but Lord or not they're not counting coming here to hear me I know that lord or even to look at me but Lord Jesus Lord they want to hear from you this morning Lord we just asked Lord you just come down Lord and just break for this bread Lord and lawyers anoint their eyes and ears God Lord to see in here Lord like you said and to your wonderful disciples you had while you were here on earth in physical form God and you said blessed their eyes for they seeing their ears for they hear and Lord God we want to be the same as well God nor it or not it's not all about knowledge Lord but Lord as my revelation God and we want things Lord preach Lord not to just go into our minds ordered with the said O Lord and to really bring a forth a change in our lives God though it's something no that would move us Lord that would just we would come out different after this service Lord God and Lord Jesus Lord just bless these people Lord they've traveled many many hours their Lord and Lord just strengthen him Lord and all the faithful of this household as well God Lord be with them as well we love you so much Lord and just Lord just use my little voice and body Lord according to God we love you so much in the name of Jesus Christ amen and I have your seats so here's our opening scripture here by the grace of God every few okay this morning I'm not trying to be boring or anything or I I'm just trying I'm this is who I am my nephews and nieces sister Wendy knows me that says Naomi all them they know how I am and the thing but we just want to be edifying the main thing is if we can come here and we can convey the very thought the Lord gave me here we want to be edifying that you can go out stronger because saints of God there's battles coming there are some serious things coming a while back when I had taught on I had taught on the open book and went through Ezekiel and showed the days of the open book and just showed and it was I think it was Ezekiel chapter five six or seven it says an evil he says an evil and evil is coming and that was back and I it was I think I appreciate hear later but I I really caught the thought there and in August and look how far life has already changed now they've shut the entire world down for a virus that kills less than three percent of the people when I go on the job sites and we talk with the guys and this and and I always tell them I said people worried about how many have died from this but do you know how many do you know how many missing children come up missing every year in the United States of America not to Russia not Japan not China you how many children come up missing or abducted or whatever happened you how many eight hundred thousand children almost almost a million children come up missing every year and that we don't hear about on the news we're not hearing about it the world's not shutting down because these these 800,000 children that have come to come up missing every year in the United States of America and yet they're worried about this virus where's this the things of God we are we have arrived this is this that they are the the powers that be are flexing their muscles they're seeing how far they can go and take this and they're gonna take it all the way to the bank program said well these at Rome has the gold the Jews have the paper the bonds and all those things he says and when the money fails the trap is set prepare ourselves we have to be prayer this is the time right now to pray up to feed the inner man to get ready for the rapture so I say those things with reverence with seriousness so here in Genesis 1 and 1 we see all of creation and it's amazing the Lord that would already have this thing set in order how the earth was already there but remember as it was in darkness and in void now how many I don't know how many who came out of the world but I came right out of the world on the denomination and I called the world denomination because it's just the same what's the difference I was actually on Facebook there and one of the guys that I went to church with when I was in denomination he's still in denomination and all of a sudden now social drinking is okay he's sitting back on his chair and he's showing his he's painting around in his backyard while his kids are playing in the trampoline he says I've got he goes I'm living the life and I believe this man is a being a pastor and he pans over and on his little backyard a table there there's an alcoholic beverage and that was and that is the leadership now of this generation of denominations but when I was in denomination saints of God I'll say it like this when I was growing up and coming in you know as a young boy we at that age we have no idea literally really have no idea that there is a God we have no idea what the what our what we're even here for we have no idea what we're gonna do in the future we have no idea as a young child right here in the front door or in the back there right now their future they have no idea what's coming even us right now in this age and this this time that I'm just about ready turned 43 and as a 43 42 year old right now looking to the 43 what is in the future it's all darkness I have no idea why it's all black it's all void I cannot figure out what's going to take place tomorrow we have no idea where we're in this place where we have no concept of what tomorrow brings but jesus said not to worry about it why but but but the thing is the beautiful thing is about that darkness there the winter the first thing that Jesus brought that God brought to the darkness was the light amen and we must be in that lag correct a man now the prophet of God he was talking about lights I believe one time and and and and the one the one quote I read that kind of inspired this whole thing he said there's three kind of lights and I thought about it and I thought about and I chewed on and I thought about some more I spit it out and I pulled it back in and I started chewing on a chewing harder than it and then I said and I and as I was thinking on these I said actually there's four kinds of lights so I like to teach this morning on if you could walking in the light but that's not it you have to choose your light what light you what do you mean brother sigh I thought there was only one light you're gonna see there's four kinds of light and we had better make sure that we are living in the light amen makes sense we're gonna teach this the very best we can I've been in places where it's completely dark I've been in places where where you step outside and they had no security lights at night and I could not literally see behind in the front of my hand it was that dark out at some places so darkness is kind of a scary thing I say this too when I was a denomination I was walking in that denominational darkness there is there there's not a feeling like that you have you're so unsure about everything well what does this mean in the scripture what does that mean in the scripture what you ask your pastor this you ask another past in this or another Minister this or that question and they just give their very best opinion you know they give your very best answer on their own reasoning and very seldom do they actually take you to the scripture in that at that point things about you are in darkness a man even in this message I'll say like that if you do not have the correct leadership you can be in darkness if you do not have a leadership of the Holy Ghost you'll be in darkness absolutely you're not the first version they either lamps go out and what they find themselves in darkness so we must choose our light and choose our light wisely a man now look here in the book of Job here he says what is man that he should be clean and he which is born of woman that he should be righteous look he says now we know that God is like right he says behold he putteth no trust to his Saints yeah the heavens are not clean in his sight how much more the Obama on the filthy is a man that drinketh iniquity like waters what he cannot trust any of the Saints why because we are not light we have a portion or as the Prophet he would be I have a light that came with him you know inside of us were made of what our physical building nape or bodies are made on what come he said what chemical or sorry cosmic light the reason they could take x-rays on your body is because there's like light actually inside of our bodies they said so at this point right here what does man that he should be clean what as we were born into sin we are we're dark one time I I was in the world I was not even denomination I was actually an atheist I was back slidden college and it's net and I went to one of them fortune-teller ladies and she's like oh you have the darkest aura I've ever seen and I'm like okay I had no light and now I can look back say yes I had absolutely no light but at the end there I caught that she lied and and she says now tell me don't tell me but think in your mind what's the one thing you want to do on a butcher greatest wish and in my heart now this is as a sinner I was lost you know my request in my heart was my heart would I said I want to go to heaven and she said if you continue on your path you'll make it and I'm thinking no I'm not so God showed me right there there's absolutely a very very little discernment oh my so how can I trust the rest of what she said oh my god have mercy but we're all born into darkness in the filthiness into being that lost state absolutely even when I first got saved I was still doing so much worthiness I said this without this message a brother now I've been talking to he's questioning the message he's questioning a message and I said let me tell you something other I said what message it names somewhere else that has the kind of conviction that preaches this kind of sanctification in any tapes name one ministry that has this kind of sanctification message there's not a one I just saw you know even though the Bible says when Peter and James and John were filled the Holy Ghost they went out and Peter saw the man there at the gate a beautiful he says he's silver and gold have I none I just saw a video were uh who's that a Billy Graham and or or Robert said he's a silver and gold have we much he was bragging how much money they had saints of God denomination is darkness absolutely when you when you reject the light you choose to go into full apostasy full darkness look at even even David said here's behold I was shaving shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me he said to the chief priests of David he says you indeed speak righteous Oh your congregation do you judge uprightly o ye sons of man yeh in a heart ye were quickness you weigh the violence of your hands in the earth the wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as they are born speaking lies absolutely saints of God when we come in at that Bible study last week I just had this boy he said he said if if Satan is not all-powerful now remember God can exist in more than one location or one time at one time but the devil cannot he said if Satan is not all-powerful how come there's all these bad people how can how can this person be doing something evil here and that person even if there's only so many demons you know where I took him I took him to the point where the Bible says st. st. Paul said I find a law that evil that sin is present with me always amen in other words when we took that fall with Adam and Eve sin entered in and now the devil doesn't have to do anything just let this thing run its course say man there's a lot of time Friday I was not even a no I wanted to do wrong but this thing wanted to do wrong what's our greatest enemy it's Simon Smith it's our flesh we don't need the demons can't make you do anything they will talk you into it and then if you're a weak this thing will control you a man sure sin is already in the vessel MA and we must fight through that yes he's a now he says the the wicked are estranged from the roomies if they go astray as soon as they be born speaking lies now as I was thinking on these lights well Bruce I choose your life what do you mean what kind of light I'll go with the first one that no the one that I thought of real heavy here choose your light what lie are we gonna dwell in what kind of light are we gonna live in look at this quote here a false light cause the greatest the greatest robbery the world ever had so one of the first lights that you can actually live in is a false light when I was born my mom and daddy were a Catholic false light then my mom went his denomination false light then I went to the world and learn false light I've been a false light more my entire life and I was in Christian that is a force night cause the greatest the greatest Train Robbery the world ever had in England that longer the greatest robbery that was performed was done by a force light know something to this he says in the Aces is an O that the 7 million dollar robbery was done by a false light that slowed the train down Scott your Scotland Yard's couldn't find the man they got away with it so slicky they had known the greatest robbery of number robbers in the natural around the world of its greatest robbery so we're dealing with a false like notice seven million dollars why would that even be in the number I was so special about this notice the Prophet 1964 picks this up and shows us what was so special about this notice the Great Train Robbery took place in nineteen and sixty three the exact same year the seven seals were opened up when the first five what the first Bible study ever taught coming to this message brother Craig had me started doing Sunday schools to help him he can take a break this since we back back forth the first one ever taught was called the bright heist and that what the whole important the entire point of the devil is that he can what to stri try and steal or trying to hinder Jesus Christ bright now look at this 1963 one of the most infamous robberies of all time 1963 the Great Train Robbery involved in the hijacking of a London bound train left of millions of pounds but noticed the name of the Train is Royal Mail amen and what now as the seals were broken as those seals were broken in 1963 notice the devil anointed and showed what he was going to try and do remember at these opening you see us what was released what 200 million demons focused now what and they were not not demons of persecution but ecclesiastical demons what aimed at the bride Amon going to steal the riches of the bride the royal bride late on Thursday August 8th 1963 a traveling post office left train left Glasgow for Houston on board staff sorted the mail and parcels prior to its arrival in London the second carriage on the front of the train was a high value package cares we're registered mail was sorted much of the consisted of cash usually the the value of these items would have been in the region about three hundred thousand pounds but cause that had been at the bank holiday weekend in Scotland the total robbery was about 2.3 million pounds or 30 million today all took place a false light sprung up to try and steal what 1963 it's amazing how that all worked he says the train past lightened Buzzard and at about 3:00 a.m. notice what it did it was at dark it was in the middle of the night this heist was trying to take place in the darkness the train past lightened Buzzard at about 3 a.m. on August 8th 1963 and moments later the driver Jack Mills saw a red signal ahead at a place called Sears Crossing the signal was false of blood had been stuffed into the proper signal and the red light was active I activated by attaching it to a six volt battery when Mills stopped his Colt co-driver David will be climbed out of the diesel engine to bring the singer men to us sir tain the problem all this took place in the dark thanks of God when this door closes when this door closes we're living in the dark place the band thought this raps would take place in 1977 why he could not see past it was so dark well brother I had this revelation or I had this thought and the Lord just showed me the scripture we better make sure it's not a false light we better not make we better make sure it's not a false revelation we have to go what to our euro Thoreau might hear and make sure that it runs from Genesis to revelations absolutely there must be scripture to prove it so if that's a false light or if that's a type of the false light look at this hearing in Matthew 13 verse 24 another parable put he put forth under them saying the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came down I'm reading this for a reason but while men slept his enemy came and tared so tares among the wheat and went his way you want the Prophet said about this and I have a testimony about this because this portion of Scripture affected my life earlier on I'll say like this my dad was raised Catholic rough childhood just was not raised correctly and he suffers even today for it and he let it overtake him all those things but my mom and dad got together they started having children and my dad had a dream one night that in my in his dream he said he saw salmon cam over here and there were little little children at the time little children over there and he said he saw a man in black over in the far distance and that man of black was really focused on them children that mana black started running towards those children and my dad said he said no and he started running to try and intercept that man but then as my dad was halfway in between them the children and the man in black he said that man in black then turned his focus onto him and he told me he said Sai he was he didn't want them he said he wanted me and that man had black started chasing and running after my dad and he woke up absolutely terrified and I'll say 'la and I say this humbly he's been running ever since and my dad was given a church a book by me and he stumbled and he started to read in the church age book now notice we read the scripture here now notice what the Provost said he said I closed the Bible I laid it down I meditated awhile and prayed some more I still had no answer I again opened the Bible Amos Lee but did not read suddenly the wind blew into the room he says them once more those pages turn to Hebrews 6:13 there as the wind ceased I read read those words over again and when I did and then the Spirit of God came into the room and I beheld a vision I saw in the vision a man dressed in a bright day he says dressed in the purest white who went forth into the freshly plowed field and sowed grain it was a bright day and the sowing was done in the morning but late at night after the solar white was gone a man in black came and stoutly sowed more some more seeds in among which the man in white had sown the day went by the Sun rain blessed the ground and one there they appeared the grain how it was fine but a day later appeared the tares also my dad had been reading this and he stumbled onto that he said the man of black it sent sent shivers up his body he dropped the book stood on his bed and he was terrified he said Simon he goes I don't know who this man is he says but he knew exactly who the devil was a man in black Satan himself right remember talking about false lights he says therefore behold I will bring strangers upon thee the terrible the nation's name was they shall draw their swords against the beauty thy wisdom and they shall defile I brightness Satan's not like this with the pitchfork and the longtail and the horses that he is the most beautiful of all the angels oma in fact the Bible says here that he was the brightness he calls him right he had light thine heart was lifted up because thy beauty now has corrupted I wisdom by the reason of thy brightness he was also Lucifer means what bearer of light I will cast me to the ground I was lady before Kings that they may behold thee this one of light ma sure he says now learned here talking about Satan his power he can assume such as aspect and aspect as he pleases he can disassemble and appeared to be eminently pious a false light I'm talking about religious life I'm not talking about worldly light anymore I'm not talking about black lights and and taking your laundry detergent and let liquid form then just let it dry out and take and what staff there and doing this and this sin on your walls shut the lights off turn a black light on there you got your I'm not talking that but kind of not that kind of like I'm talking about what a false religious lied oh my Satan himself the man in black but what he is also a bearer of light a false light he can disassemble it appear to be every pious he is the Prince of duplicity as well as a wickedness duplicity two ways he can be absolutely perfectly religious but all he's his whole purpose is to take someone to hell to two ways he is the principle attune implicitly as well as of wickedness it is the consummation of bad power for an individual to be and assume any character which he pleases he can play any part he's the perfect actor his art he long practice in deceitful arts for six thousand years even practice in the art of delusion and with him it is perfect he's bless you he is the false light we are not to be supposed that all that all that appears to be piety is piety saints of God of st. Paul the first church agent messenger could look at his people and say not all Israel is Israel we can say in this time not all message is message because remember the greatest light November Scott is not looking like darkness it is looking like light and this man here Gil he says he will be he will appear as pious some of the most plausible appearances of piety are assumed by Satan and his ministers the most religious looking a lot of times will be false none ever professed or profound in regard for the authority of God and then Satan when he tempted the Savior now notice this Satan appeared to God hidden in the flesh and he acted tried to act religious before the religion one my goodness he tried to show how religious he was to God in the flesh remember he knew the law he knew the pillar of fire he the logos but he could not discern that the logos had changed and now that living God was in him Satan did not know the very one his very creator was inside them but what front did he bring him a pious a religious no one ever professed a profounder regard for the four-team of god and satan did when he tented the Saviour and if the Prince of wickedness can appear to be an angel of light we are not to be surprised if those who have the blackest hearts appear to the people the blackest of hearts appear to be people most eminent piety so let me ask you something if Satan is still operating the way he's always operated an angel of light is the angel of darkness a fall of religiousness would he not come to the message remember programs that he says he says Antichrist is one word not a trinity off now the father suddenly goes baptism off one word one word that's the church age book and if the Prince of wickedness can appear to be an angel light we are not surprised if the black is of hearts will be people who have the most eminent piety they'll walk the perfectness walk we're dealing with Pharisees entities against things we're dealing with religious heads now not blessed just I'm just I'm just teaching this morning what is the definition of piety a devotion faith religion all religious the quality of the state of being pious such as the the fidelity of natural obligation to repair this obligations as you parents do teenis in religion devoutness satan will be the most devout message believer there is so note the quotes he'll say the right things he'll do the right things he'll act the right things but that is a false light hmm now think of God as we move in further into time what is the what is a month from now hold what is a year from right now hold we must have that Holy Ghost on the inside so much that when we see we feel something false that buzzer will go off saying to God this is life and death those those were message times those message whatever you want to call it it's over clay and Church is over it's now time to move in to the Holy Ghost like we've never moved into him before we just had a brother came and preached and the one thing that stuck he says jesus said if my words abide in you and you abide in me if you abide in me think on that let that soak they need me so hard that let it abide in if you abide in me what walking in his words the confines of his word if the Bible says this I'm right there if the Bible says that I'm gonna be right here if the Bible says if there's two ways right here what does the Bible say on which one I'm gonna go here what if the Bible say anything what if it's a bad thing then I'm gonna pray I'm gonna take a step and say Lord guide my footsteps say my yes sir he says we should be on guard we should not listen to suggestions merely because they appear to come from a pious man well so-and-so this pastor said this brother sigh and this preacher said this and this let me one thing I've learned since I've been in this message I will let the Holy Ghost lead me okay I hear what you're saying I hear you're saying I heard what they said I heard it doesn't matter to me what does the whole what is what is God's will for your life brother and your sister brother sister the hope each one of us has a ministry each one of us has a testimony each one of us has something gifts and callings to do for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and you I we are all accountable for what we do well on judgement day well Lord well so-and-so said this and I heard that because they this other big name preachers preach this and I and I kind of went with no if you abide in my words he said Jesus he said we should not listen to suggestions merely because they appear to come from a pious man or because they seem to be prompted by the regard to the will of God we must be careful how someone uses a scripture towards us he says we must we may be always sure that if we are to be tempted it will be by someone having great appearance of virtue and religion because of the looking right you know feel right oh my those words and he said Wow powerful Wow praise be to God and this ananthan but is it of the Holy Ghost sugar sweet taste great honey's real good too but what's inside that honey was there anything added to that sugar was there anything end to that honey that Jesus would touch that's not the oil on the wine was there anything added to that wine that stimulation was a pure wine amen I'm not I'm not trying to be hard I'm just I'm just let you know now he says we are not expected to that Satan will appear to man to be as bad as he is he will never show himself openly to be a spirit of pure wickedness or black and abomino in his character or a form of evil in hateful he's not like that he will not why because no one likes people your being around a negative person every around someone that just constantly picks on you mean to your listeners no one wants to be around that person and Satan knows that so he's never going to come at you like that he is going to come and just we prayed up I know have you read your Bible because I don't have he's gonna come religious using the scripture using the words using sweetness and kindness they say I'm just reading here from guilt this manage manage not even eagle yet he was thus defeat himself if he would reveal himself as a darkness the dark that he is but he does not come like that it is for this reason that wicked people do not believe that there is such a person such a being as Satan though continually under his influence and led captive by him at his will he says yet they neither see him nor the change which would lead them nor are they willing to believe in the existence of one or the other that's the false light that's okay that's flight number one we still got three more to go so just be careful here is that a dangerous fight that's extremely dangerous flight is there more dangerous flights absolutely let's get into it here now the Prophet said there was three lights and now this is what we're gonna go into but but as I was thinking on those things and whatever I thought about that false light Satan becoming a false making his ministers even ministers of light of righteousness he can turn himself into an angel light and I thought I said man that's a deception right there big time but now where's the other light there's another light coming I'm not talking about the light I'm talking another light here and as we've always worked with the tabernacle you know everything you know you know how the preaching of the word comes and just we hit one thing and boom something else opens and this opens and saints of God ten years ago revelation wise how have you been compared to now right now we are 10 years ahead understanding revelation knowledge we are growing in the knowledge and stature of Christ so all these things we want to incorporate these things we want to keep these things at the back or right side at the tip of our tongue it replaced right in our heart but as we studied the tabernacle I never thought of it like quite like this he says now look what the Prophet says on a hidden life 1955 another thing we will call your attention just before we close look at the light on the outside in the courts it was the firmament that lit it up sunlight and so forth some days was cloudy some days the Sun didn't shine off some days it was dark now that's a knee out of court where are we living now we're talking about the Church of God here we're not talking about Satan's Eden or this or that we're talking when we come to the house of God what court have we been dwelling in because never that upper court it was wide open to the sky and they would get in there but their sacrifice and there'd be the the altar of a the brass altar the brass slabber and whenever that would happen it could it could rain in that place and they get wet the elements of the nature of the seasons could affect that court right there they could look at the Stars and blinking and twinkling and all those things the Sun would come up the moon they could see all that thing but it would go through seasons you have her seasons they're black and dark and light and cloudy overcast like our lives this goes through it some days this thing is I'm getting old I'm starting to understand this you get pains your pains maybe huh knees elbows I'm a plumber weird on my knees all the time knees hurt now there are three courts the justified man out there he was walking by daylight some days he has gloomy days you get it oh I hope you see this god bless you some days are gloomy some days you don't know whether this is even worthwhile to serve God or not yet in the house of God saved man I don't even I don't know if I should even be here wow I have to wake up early to go to church I have to drive an hour or so to go to church this even I mean this guy over here this guy I know he's sleeping in tonight here this morning then he wakes up watch the footballer wakes this watch the movie this that man their lives are so much easier than mine he's only living in the outer court in a Christian he says we're walking in the outer court sure you're eating manna sure you are a believer what manner was he talking about the man of the FEL every day from the sky every day from the sky every day from the sky that everybody the ones on the outside are eating as well sure if you die you go to Heaven's truly but what kind of life are you living kind of light are we walking in we have to choose our lights here every day oh I get out there oh I got my dandruff up today I told him about it I cussed them out I said oh God forgive me sure he will certainly he will you're his child but what kind of life are you living my don't you hate to live this kind that kind of life the ups and downs troubles and pose day and night back sitting back to church back sitting back to church this then apologized for this over here this is not an overcoming Christian yet living in a light living in a atmosphere this other fellow just blooming right along not a thing see done faizon one living here when living here remember that that tavern icons many powerful types in it what kind of life are you walking according to the weather let me share this three weeks ago I had to do the most dangerous job I ever had to do that's 40 foot up walking to Z Gertz on it on that on a metal building tight off only because the things flipped over there's really in fact that slipped off a couple of times and I had to walk like this because there's so much machinery I couldn't get a lift up there and I had the one-handed I was holding on by one hand I'd had my tools drill a hole in the Z Gert put my tool pier and then I had to try and get my elbow because I'm so short elbow on top of the Aussie Gert to hold myself as I put in the hanger and then we had to I had to wrestle pipe through the hangers and I did that for two days really not even tied off I'm just walking it and I had to bust through fear like you've never and I'm not captain huh I told the brother I said I'm an eagle but I haven't learned how to fly yet okay so I want to let you know we're I could I had to pray through the entire time and as these little trials at work are coming more and more seems like constant I find myself having to pray through more and more and push through no matter how this feels I am moving forward I am not calling off work I'm gonna get this job done and then I'll tell you this at the end of the day we put a pressure test on it in the leaked at the worst spot but God sent another man I climbed up that 40-foot ladder got up there how long with one hand the other guy had to climb up now he didn't have to do it before but now he had you he had to climb up and he was arranged here the pipe on what he had wrench on one pipe and I had on the other and we unthreaded it while one guy was holding that ladder that was the that was key because it was in like a slick plant I mean the floors were slick and that ladder so we had done do it fixed it and we're out last day but you will have I'm telling you God is going to put you to the test and you must pray through cannot give up we are overcomers on Judgment Day well Lord I really couldn't do this in Jesus I went to the cross was beaten whipped and I died for you and I was sinless what will we say on that day he says what kind of life are you walking according to the weather it will give light outside the gloomy the foggy the halfway then a bright day and then a gloomy or foggy a cloud limit Ohio it's taking the cloud state cloud over Sun that's just the way the dream the regenerated justified man lives that's right that's all the light he has to walk in that's but when just when he walks by that by that that suggested by man are they're justified meant in this message women absolutely but over the brand of my ups and downs all mine I'm the most miserable person I have to fight every day welcome to the battle he says oh yes brother water you walk that's where you're walking that's alright he's in the outer courts but he's a Christian he's saved but look at the very life they're living up and down short on money this anise snake explode this this heavenly explode no no no look he's here now the next court was the lamp of God remember they entered the holy place that was covered it was not affected by the outside natural realms and there was actually a Sevenfold candlestick light that lit up the whole place he said the next court of the lamp of God were the justified stand and it was lit by human hands notice I like how he said that Norse he said it was lit by human hand I wonder a lot of times our youth go to youth meetings and they come there fired up there but as soon as they get back they die down was it lit by man hands or did they really get in the presence of God and notice that's where we argue our denominations let's just say our message doctrines where we argue our differences on Theo fanuc substance or spiritual things like that let hairs well brother if you don't do this and that you can't come and teach for us you were here I know brother right now that does not agree with a certain doctrine that said well brother you can't interpret for us anymore because you don't agree with us on this and it's not even a Salvation issue in the message the hour oh I don't believe in divine healing I don't believe that visions come from God I don't believe this I don't believe that you're arguing because you're living yeah you're eating manna what there was there was there was 12 shoe dreads right in the holy place they were eating prepared by the priests not even by God but this was God ordained men they made these these these these Manas just these pieces of bread just for those they were able to get in the holy place and there was light there he says you're arguing because you're living yet you're eating manna but you're living under artificial light why because that light went out later on that light can go out if then priests failed to get oil numb laughs they'll go out he said that's right sometimes the light goes out sometimes your lamp gets smoked up my goodness where's that take you why isn't foolish virgin let me let me ask you this master 25 Bible says and at midnight there was a cry and all the virgins arose and trimmed their lamps I wonder where the bride is even living at the coming of the Lord if they have to trim their lamps ma he says you're arming because you're living yeah you're eating manna he said you're living under artificial light that's right sometimes the lights go sometimes your lamp gets smoked up but - he who desires to be hit away walks into the next place he says there's no artificial light anyway hey man he says well then you say well I want to go a little deeper well he comes into the court now what's in there there are seven golden candlesticks by the holy place and it's giving light the candlesticks are giving light notice what are these remember pastor Jess he's actually doing a book on the on the twelve pieces of shewbread the twelve mysteries contained in the New Testament so a Christian could be in that holy place eating all the mysteries contained in this message and contained in the Word of God and still not be in the light amazing that's to the man who quits quits to his drinking quit smoking quit slang quit stealing treats his neighbor right good to his wife or her good to her husband the same way man a woman to believer he has to come into place where is to quit all his meanness which is through the blood the sanctification he is called to the new life he walks in there he don't have to walk by the light out there he's got a better light he's walking by the light of seven golden candlesticks which is burning olive oil this is a better staff you could go from a false light where I was at you could go what to the light on the firmament where I was at at one time in denomination even into the message when I first got the heard the message I got baptized in one o'clock in the morning but I did not receive the Holy Ghost till a year and a half later he says he didn't have to walk by that light out there he got a better light he's walking by the light of seven golden candlesticks which is the burning olive oil amen and the olive oil is representing the Holy Ghost the fire was the baptisms baptize you working or you can baptize in there get the holy spirit but you're not hid away yet you're not behind the veil here he is he is walking in these seven golden candlesticks there is many lights or much light in there but there's days when their lights get dull there's days when them lamps smoke and that light is not so good there is times when them lights have to be real it's again and you have to borrow a little from a neighbor to light one candle to another one hmm man whenever I get around this brother of this sister I just feel whoo whoo we should feel like that without being around the brother and sister we should be in that atmosphere all the time amen we should have so much virtue we can bless anyone at any time spiritually he says it's still not a good light we're thankful for it yes a manthe god but it's still not the right light all brother oh brother see that it's still not the right light but notice I'll say like this what is the message of the hour then not both the last two lights come with the message of the hour I'll say like this all three of these lights come with the message the hour because on that outer court was the true baptism and repentance that is taught sadly in the best in this message baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen that is taught right here in this message then as we moved in what did the prophets are bringing forward now the mysteries contain the seven seals the serpent seed the Gentile the station the rapture all those things now I brought but the promise that that was not the message he was supposed to unwrap all the missed mysteries bring forth all the mysteries absolutely but he said what was the main thing Jesus Christ he says you say brother while I spoke in tongues I shouted good wonderful but let me tell you something different all right he's walking in the light it's an artificial light it's not the light of the Sun the light of the Moon the Stars the man in the justify courts when night comes he is a very dim light he just sees the Stars and maybe a pale moon a lot of flying clouds he's in an awful fix but the man up there at the altar he keeps give himself under consecration it says Lord I'm going to live right by you was he was to abide in Christ amen his words are him and he's in Christ amen yes sir he's not going to live go to my neighbor I'm going to try my best to do better Lord well he's living in a better place his lights out him goes out but they do smoke up and they have to light one from another just like I said here with the Virgin's that light will kick into the end it will but I do like this as a pastor Jesse one time talked about the four kinds of grounds that the Bible we get to read from word Matthew 13:24 22 I'm sorry four kinds of grounds that the Word of God falls into and here's the second to last one he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word in the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches what in Laodicea no other age has this kind of money this kind of power this kind of wealth this kind of material increase like Miss age the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and are become unfruitful this is art this is like this is where I want to focus on is I want I do not want this because what the next is that he receives in the good ground is he that receipt here in the word here's the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some one hundredfold some sixty some thirty but I like how Luke brings us out and that which fell among the thorns are they which have heard go forth and our choked notice the reason they're choked is because of these with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no bring no fruit to perfection there in the holy place but they're not there and then of course Saints the holiest of holies as they move beyond that veil and that veil shut behind them they no longer saw the light I'll say like this what's more powerful the seven golden candlesticks light or the presence of the Shekinah glory do you think the high priest and time could look back and see through the cracks light no because there was so much in life inside this place it was lit up by itself hey man praise God he says father and Jesus name receive us now we ask the Holy Ghost to come upon us and to bless us and to give us that which we are asking for today may the great up limited power of God moving to us just now and may the Shekinah glory o God that dwelt under the interlocking wings of the cherubim may it dwell under the interlocking wings he started the interlocking arms of the cross hmm a pastor been teaching on moving into the presence of God and the reason I had this light up here look at look at Hebrews 94 which had the golden censer and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid roundabout with gold right when was the golden pot that had manna Aaron's rod button and the table of Covenant so all those had meanings our pastures went through him and over it the cherubims of glory overshadowing the mercy seat of which we cannot now particularly speak st. Paul did not know what those cherubims meant he says well we don't know the interpret I do not know the interpretation of those but brother Branham brought forth Oh God that dwell under the interlocking wings of the cherubim may it come under the interlocking arms of the cross he said it represented the cross of Jesus Christ which is what the blood came a man all the way through the scripture the woman was what the widow one was what gathering two sticks to start that fire to make her last meal right David the prophet but he was it was two sticks and the problems that look the cross but down in between the arc of the wings of these cherubims was a holy halo light hanging in there which was the halo of God that lit the whole room and a man that once entered into that Shekinah glory hallelujah Jesus that moves back there in the presence of the Almighty God brother he's at night he says the dimness of this world any artificial organizations and all man-made increse had passed away and he's living in the Shekinah glory of God of the Almighty God hey man but the man who walks beyond that and goes in when the world is shut off and the veil drops down around him down under the locking wings of the cherubim the grace kind of glory hung out there and never got damaged never went out and the man who lives in the presence of God under the veil lives in the Shekinah glory I I don't care if the storms are raging or the clouds or the moon don't shine or the standard startled shine see that's when this thing starts when the door is shut and these great things start taking place on the earth what if the bride is still there we see the Sun that shining the moon not giving her light it won't matter we're living in the Holy Ghost earthquakes hit LA it doesn't matter we're living in the Holy Ghost they start rounding up Christians it does not matter we're living in that light the Holy Ghost sliding on no matter what takes place the economy crashes what are we gonna go by if they shut down all the stores they already did shut down everything they left a little bit open to see what would happen to test what would we buy what would they do what would do this you see what they're setting the stage here what if this time they drop a disease so big it shuts everything down what you eat how are we gonna stress out and ah no it doesn't matter if we eat or not Jesus what Jesus said what in Matthew 4 he says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God what if there's coming a time well we'll be out with no food and I will read the Bible and our bellies are start getting filled is it possible possible we're gonna the Prophet said he said when this third pole hits he says we're going to see things we've never even imagined before Christ came on the scene could they even imagine someone walking on water someone breaking fish and loaves and multiplying food what's next do not put a limit on Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost is going to perform things that is going to be spectacular it'll literally be out of this world I think this it'll be beyond natural it'll be called supernatural I mean and the man who lived in the presence of God under the veil lives in the Shekinah glory I don't care if the stores are raising the clouds the moon don't shine all those things he's living in the Shekinah glory God under the power of the Holy Ghost it didn't go out at night it didn't go out it's a kind of a mystic light kind of soft glowing light and the believer arrest walks around inside the veil though she kind of where the pot of manna was where he ate daily never give out he ate the manna he says oh my and we know those are the greatest mysteries right there anybody can eat the mysteries we've heard but there's coming things hidden in the word that's going to open up that's going to be beyond that can only come from the Shekinah glory amen let's stand how'd you almost an hour here hope that's alright and saints of God we all have loved ones we all have people we've grown up with known before and after us that we all love and we want to make sure that not only do we live in and choose the correct light to live in but we want to push others and pull others into the glorious light of this word into that I think it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost these mysteries are great but we must receive and make sure we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says whether your children are this way and your mother is this way your daddy is that way I can say that whether your pastor said that whether the doctor said this for that you don't even hear it my dad sits on his he's on the third floor of his apartment he's got a little overhang here I like I called the Eagles Nest it's like a balcony and he sits like this and he smokes but when I go over there all I see is a full fill the son of god pull the Holy Ghost because that's what I believe I'm not looking at what I'm seeing I'm looking at what I want to see and what the Bible says I could have I wanted I I believe I believe I see something that God said could be done I see someone that's bribed my momma stuck in denomination hair cut like this in this key we got color Anderson is wearing short pants I mean it's just but I see a daughter fold the Holy Ghost and I treat her accordingly well brother size it doesn't matter I don't see that he says you don't even hear it you live all in the Shekinah glory walking and living in the prints of the king every day is a sue is sweet to your soul my all's well all as well there is nothing can harm you or what a place or I think of that little song but America - complain in him was life and the light the life was the light of men and the light shined in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for witness to bear witness of the light that all men might through him believed he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light that is the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world we know as the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ assault is powerheads during the Father Lord Jesus so we just love you God and though we were so thankful Lord for her Lord just showing us a little bit more and in the word Lord and Lord making us aware of our surroundings Lord Lord this morning or where are we living or what lie have we chosen our weed welling in the Shekinah glory God we stuck out in the outer courts or even the holy place where we at Lord we thank you Lord for sending your your messenger there Lord God to break these things down we can understand them Lord and Lord God we know Lord it is the time of the seven seals Lord there was a great heist a great false light and Lord Jesus it stated that here at the end Lord at the time of the mark of the beast there'd be a great temptation there'd be a great light come up in the entire world it would light up the entire world and it's gonna look so good Lord and look right the lights gonna expose all parties it's gonna sound great and the plans gonna fit just well and it's you know look like you just like like wood your dog we know you're gonna warn those things we're gonna keep it from them no we want to identify any foresight he light that comes creational we don't want that or any light that comes from man we don't want that or below we want to dwell in that presence Lord with a purifier or God resides we're able to be shut in and locked in the air or we just pray Lord every soul here God Lord would get that place if you just shut that curtain cut that closet door that door just lacking a few lord help us all to do it nor I know we just we just pray Lord bless edifying bride for me this is for them so what I say is well Lord you know I would find what I wanted to teach story and it appears I love you lord that's the people Jesus Christ amen Saints all hearts minds clear just think on everything make sure we're all clean anything negative anything not good [Music] judging you know anything you know isn't right your conscience tells you the Holy Ghost tells you is not righteous just hit that just hit that altar in your heart there right quick just say Lord forgive me depends me make me right you know saints of God when it comes down to we can't prove we can't perform this ourselves I can't just walk into the holiest of Holies and boom there we are but we have to ask God to get us there the Prophet said he would get us there so what we all of you have to do is what when the hardest thing to do is different wait on him have patience give God some time give him time to to move things around and to get the the scheme the planned I think there's the world chessboard in the way he wants it remember every Kings got to be set up just right every person got me in there a specific time God is a mastermind he knows all things every person must be exactly where they're supposed to be when this thing is and when this thing hits he will make sure that he will perform everything he promised in our lives for us and with us he does not lie just give him some time Leon he is faithful he defeated the devil 2,000 years ago like he said he would 4000 years before that everything came past just like it and it's gonna happen again in our day young man's young young girls here back up your mom and dad
