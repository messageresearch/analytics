[20:05] [Music]
[20:28] i love that song you know my children i
[20:29] were talking one time and
[20:31] i just said i think that's a song for an
[20:33] experienced believer
[20:35] you know because when we first get saved
[20:36] we just open up everything to jesus but
[20:38] then
[20:38] you know over time we get busy we kind
[20:41] of don't give jesus
[20:42] enough time then we gotta surrender and
[20:44] say lord i'm gonna make more room for
[20:46] you praise god
[20:47] i think that's a beautiful song as
[20:50] you're standing let's take our bibles
[20:51] i'd like to go to uh
[20:53] job let's go to job 31

[22:39] let's try to miss a meal or two for our
[22:41] brother instead of eating

[22:46] the table
[22:47] and just give a sacrifice of prayer for
[22:50] brother jose
[22:52] that his eyes can be healed by god's
[22:54] grace
[22:56] job 31 35 let's just read that one
[22:59] together
[23:00] um here's where job demands god
[23:04] answer him remember brother brahm did
[23:06] that too
[23:08] he said brother he said god you know me
[23:10] an understanding
[23:12] and it made it made god of course upset
[23:16] job 31 35 let's read that one two three
[23:19] oh that one would hear me behold
[23:23] my desire is that the almighty would
[23:26] answer me and that mine adversary had
[23:29] written
[23:29] a book let's have one more word of
[23:31] prayer heavenly father lord we just come
[23:34] again here tonight lord god we're
[23:36] moved by the holy spirit together more
[23:37] as we see that day approaching
[23:39] we know lord god that wherever two or
[23:41] three are gathered there you are in the
[23:43] midst so lord
[23:44] we honor your presence in the midst
[23:46] tonight lord god we know you're here
[23:47] we're thankful that you're here lord
[23:49] you're our guest of honor lord without
[23:51] you we wouldn't want to be here lord god
[23:53] and
[23:53] we're only here because you're here lord
[23:55] god so let your presence just minister
[23:57] here for the next few moments
[23:59] give us another blessing more
[24:00] instruction lord more faith more
[24:02] revelation
[24:03] may we go from faith to faith to glory
[24:05] to glory we pray
[24:06] we want to be more like you we want to
[24:08] make room for your lord god
[24:10] to do whatever you want in our lives we
[24:13] want to be humble we want to be
[24:14] submissive
[24:15] help us now to understand our sufferings
[24:17] in jesus christ's name
[24:18] and the church said amen god bless you
[24:21] as you're being seated praise god
[24:24] okay thank you and i'll try not to
[24:27] preach an hour and a half tonight okay
[24:29] but i just couldn't it was like it was
[24:30] like new wine okay
[24:33] i was just all bubbling up this morning
[24:34] and uh felt good to get it all out there
[24:37] by god's grace so
[24:38] i just you know to me a lot of these
[24:40] things are fresh i've never seen job in
[24:42] this way before
[24:43] so a lot of these are fresh i would say
[24:45] revelation or understanding to me
[24:47] and it really helps me as i said to put
[24:49] job on the level with all of us he
[24:51] wasn't above us
[24:52] or anything i'd say he's on the same
[24:54] level as far as like he was a man he had
[24:56] mistakes
[24:57] he needed god's grace he was trusting in
[24:59] the blood
[25:00] um and we can relate to him really well
[25:02] so let me do this let me set my timer
[25:04] for uh 40 minutes okay
[25:06] and hopefully we can uh hopefully i can
[25:08] be done in 40 minutes we'll see
[25:09] we'll see how the holy spirit directs us
[25:11] so let's uh i want to just put two new
[25:13] things in here i do a new thing here and
[25:15] a new thing there
[25:16] this was our text uh
[25:19] this is at the very end of job's words
[25:21] in chapter
[25:22] 31. uh he
[25:25] for he said he said oh that one would
[25:28] hear me
[25:29] behold my desires that the almighty
[25:31] would answer me
[25:32] remember it seems as if god has been
[25:34] quiet this whole time
[25:36] from chapter 3 all the way to 31
[25:40] god has been quiet he's just let job
[25:43] kind of blurt out you know some things
[25:44] now god's showing him a few things right
[25:46] i know my redeemer liveth
[25:48] but god let it be silent and let them
[25:50] debate for a while
[25:52] uh and and then he cries out and he's
[25:55] demanding god oh that god would answer
[25:58] me
[25:59] that my adversary had written in a book
[26:02] and so part of this prayer being
[26:06] answered
[26:06] is elijah coming right because he says
[26:10] i'm not
[26:10] eli who says i'm not speaking by myself
[26:13] i'm speaking by the anointing of god
[26:15] amen right he said usually young men
[26:17] don't speak he said but i feel the
[26:19] spirit of god like wine
[26:21] pushing out of me and i've got to speak
[26:22] these things and he said job if i'm
[26:24] wrong you speak up and correct me
[26:27] and job never did now to back up what we
[26:30] said about
[26:31] job being a type of laodicean look what
[26:34] he said here he said i was
[26:35] at ease but he hath broken me asunder so
[26:39] job said he got to a place
[26:40] of relaxing in a spiritual walk
[26:44] right and we all know what that's like
[26:46] right we just get consumed with worldly
[26:47] things or family responsibilities or
[26:50] we forget to pray or we're not because
[26:52] you know we're not focusing on the
[26:53] things of god we
[26:54] didn't make something right he got at
[26:56] ease
[26:57] uh he stopped being diligent about the
[26:59] things of god
[27:00] so that's like laodicea right not as
[27:02] diligent as we ought to be so
[27:04] i just thought i'd bring another
[27:06] scripture there to show that these are
[27:07] job's own words
[27:09] right job understood uh he had good he
[27:12] had good things in his life
[27:13] but he was also a man he also had
[27:15] struggles in his life
[27:17] okay so with that being said
[27:20] um let's go the next scripture here okay
[27:23] so job 34.
[27:25] if you got your bibles let's go to job
[27:26] 34.
[27:29] we ended with chapter 33 and then we
[27:31] opened up now in chapter 34. i just want
[27:33] to bring out
[27:34] a few important things out of these
[27:37] uh scriptures here i'm gonna read verses
[27:39] three through nine and the main idea
[27:41] is now listen look at this eli who says
[27:44] job is accused of believing
[27:46] scorning against god so job must have
[27:48] heard scorning against god
[27:50] but the bible says he drank it up
[27:53] scorning against god
[27:56] so he heard it from somewhere now it
[27:57] could have been the devil too right
[27:59] that's where this is where we get some
[28:00] of our bad ideas right from our mind
[28:03] battles
[28:04] but he he is accused by elihu for
[28:07] drinking up scorn against god
[28:10] which is like anger and bitterness and
[28:12] judgment against god
[28:14] okay so 34 verses three through nine for
[28:16] the
[28:17] ear trieth words as the mouth taste this
[28:19] meat so he's talking about job's ears
[28:22] are listening to words verse four let us
[28:25] choose to us
[28:25] judgment let us know among ourselves
[28:28] what is good for
[28:29] job has said i am righteous and god have
[28:31] taken away my judgment right there he
[28:33] said
[28:34] i'm righteous and god isn't judging me
[28:36] the right way
[28:37] again very harsh words against our
[28:39] creator god
[28:41] right should i lie against my right my
[28:44] wound is incurable
[28:46] without transgression now look he says i
[28:48] won't get healed
[28:50] yet i didn't do anything wrong that's
[28:53] not true
[28:55] what man is like job who drinketh up
[28:57] scorning like water
[29:00] so job is he's just taking the wrong
[29:02] ideas right he's just listen
[29:03] remember because he said earlier for the
[29:06] ear tries the words and the mouth taste
[29:08] is meat
[29:09] so job is listening he's listening what
[29:11] other people say
[29:12] and he was believing it right sometimes
[29:15] we'll believe the wrong thing
[29:17] somebody will share the wrong idea and
[29:19] you'll start believing it
[29:21] well the bible says try every spirit
[29:24] amen
[29:25] so don't believe everything you hear if
[29:28] anything's taught us that it's this
[29:29] election
[29:30] psycho right and all these uh
[29:32] coronavirus news reports and everything
[29:35] oh my goodness you don't believe
[29:37] everything you hear you must and we know
[29:39] that we must
[29:40] rightly divide the word of god right we
[29:42] must discern is this the right spirit or
[29:44] the wrong spirit
[29:45] well job during the trial right like we
[29:47] all would
[29:48] he starts drinking in the wrong thing
[29:50] scorn
[29:52] angered and then he says
[29:55] god is not ju i'm righteous god is not
[29:58] righteous
[30:00] remember just like brother graham see
[30:01] this is why it reminds me so much about
[30:02] branham
[30:04] god you owe me an understanding why
[30:06] would you heal someone and then take
[30:07] them home
[30:08] why would you save a woman from drowning
[30:10] and then just shortly after
[30:12] she dies in the hospital she has the
[30:14] little children right
[30:15] you owe me an understanding and god put
[30:18] a black sheep between the prophet and
[30:19] him for a while
[30:21] because we don't demand from god
[30:24] uh verse okay that was uh
[30:29] verse seven so see look joe was
[30:31] believing and drinking up
[30:33] uh wrong thoughts verse eight which
[30:35] goeth in company with the workers of
[30:36] iniquity and
[30:38] worketh with wic i'm sorry walketh with
[30:41] wicked men so look the elihu even says
[30:45] he's going with the company of those
[30:47] workers of iniquity
[30:49] so i'm not even sure about that is that
[30:51] physically or what
[30:53] because he was drinking up their scorn
[30:55] right that's quite a statement i didn't
[30:57] actually didn't look at that one too
[30:58] deep
[30:58] verse 9 for he has said it profiteth a
[31:00] man nothing
[31:02] that he should delight himself with god
[31:03] now look at that
[31:05] job said it doesn't do you any good to
[31:07] enjoy god
[31:09] doesn't do you any good that's what he
[31:10] said right
[31:12] and job never corrects him so
[31:16] now we see a lot more job said a lot of
[31:18] things that we would
[31:20] hopefully not say we might feel it we
[31:23] might think it right
[31:24] but god forbid may god help us not to
[31:26] utter words like that
[31:28] like it doesn't do us any good to come
[31:30] to church it doesn't do us any good to
[31:32] anoint the sick
[31:33] it doesn't do us any good to sing songs
[31:36] oh no it does it changes everything
[31:38] praise god
[31:39] amen it restores us it transforms us it
[31:42] heals us amen
[31:44] i'm going to show you lord willing on
[31:46] that music thing you
[31:47] scientists have just played classical
[31:49] music and they can prove that classical
[31:51] music brings healing
[31:53] it forms certain crystals in water even
[31:57] but then they play rock and roll to the
[31:58] same water and it deforms all the
[32:00] crystals and it looks like
[32:02] they have scientific proof on that music
[32:05] heals
[32:06] amen brother divine healing
[32:09] malachi lydia divine healing when you
[32:12] play that glorifies the lord
[32:15] not just physically but spiritually as
[32:17] well
[32:19] praise god but see job got to the spot
[32:21] his trials were so difficult which was
[32:23] not downing job
[32:25] but he just got to the spot where he
[32:26] said it doesn't do me any good to
[32:27] delighting god
[32:29] okay now i went through the harsh words
[32:33] already
[32:34] because verse 5 said for job hath said
[32:37] in other words
[32:37] elijah remembers what job said and he
[32:40] reminds them of it
[32:42] okay now verse 10 to 15 therefore
[32:45] hearken unto me men of understanding far
[32:47] be it from god that he should do
[32:48] wickedness
[32:49] and from the almighty that he should
[32:50] commit iniquity for the work of a man
[32:53] shall he render unto him and cause every
[32:55] man to find
[32:56] according to his ways so here eli who
[33:00] says god does reward according to his
[33:01] ways
[33:02] and it is beneficial to serve the lord
[33:06] 12 yea surely god will not do wickedly
[33:08] neither will the almighty pervert
[33:10] judgment who hath given him a charge
[33:12] over the earth
[33:13] or who hath disposed the whole world
[33:16] if he set his heart upon man if he
[33:18] gathereth unto himself his spirit and
[33:20] his breath
[33:21] all flesh shall perish together and no
[33:24] man shall turn
[33:24] i'm sorry and man shall return again
[33:26] unto dust
[33:28] so eli who says if god wants to he could
[33:31] come down here and every man would just
[33:32] turn to dust
[33:34] but remember job was saying things like
[33:36] oh god's not fair god's not fair
[33:38] and you lie who's trying to say no
[33:40] you've lost sight of how great god is
[33:43] right sir sometimes amongst our
[33:44] blessings and our jobs and our talents
[33:47] what we can do sometimes we forget how
[33:49] great god is
[33:51] so job had become so rich so smart so
[33:54] admired by everybody
[33:55] at ease he had all these things he he
[33:59] he'd seen all that yet he had fears
[34:01] right he'd done
[34:02] all that and he kind of forgot about the
[34:05] greatness of god
[34:08] because now god is wrong and i'm right
[34:12] oh my so see elijah justifies god
[34:17] and if god would personally reply men
[34:19] would turn to dust
[34:21] so even in the whirlwind right god must
[34:23] he's limiting himself
[34:24] right because when he came when jesus
[34:27] came to john in revelation 1 he fell
[34:29] down like he was dead right he had to
[34:30] touch him and then he raised him up
[34:32] so see god always has to make himself
[34:35] humble in order to appear before man
[34:37] he's got to hold forth some of his power
[34:39] and his glory
[34:41] amen now let's keep going here
[34:44] now verse 16 to 19.
[34:51] here he says it again that job is
[34:53] condemning god so let's read 16-19
[34:55] if now thou has understanding hear this
[34:57] hearken to the voice of my words
[34:59] shall even he that hateth right govern
[35:02] and wilt thou condemn him that is most
[35:04] just
[35:05] is it fit to say to a king thou art
[35:07] wicked and the princes
[35:09] ye are ungodly so what's elijah saying
[35:13] you're calling god god unjust he said
[35:16] but you couldn't even call princes or
[35:17] kings that on earth
[35:19] now you can do it today right but
[35:21] usually you couldn't do it
[35:22] they can call trump or biden you can
[35:24] call them whatever you want barack obama
[35:27] today you can get away with calling them
[35:28] about anything but in those days
[35:30] you couldn't right it used to be they'd
[35:33] respect kings
[35:34] right now they used to be in america
[35:35] they respect the president
[35:37] but elijah uses this argument you know
[35:40] you wouldn't even say evil things about
[35:42] a human ruler
[35:43] let alone heaven's ruler he said job is
[35:46] done wrong
[35:48] now verses now let's get down to verse
[35:51] 23 this reminds me of first corinthians
[35:52] 10
[35:53] he will not lay upon man more than right
[35:56] that he should enter into judgment with
[35:59] god
[36:00] all right so in other words god won't
[36:02] let too much
[36:03] happen to you that you can't control it
[36:05] right let me read that first corinthians
[36:07] 10 sorry let me read that
[36:09] i'm kind of misquoting it i want to
[36:10] quote it the right way let's go to first
[36:11] corinthians 10.
[36:13] beautiful chapter here uh saying
[36:16] everything that
[36:17] egypt i'm sorry everything that israel
[36:18] lost on the way to egypt or failed
[36:21] we should not fail and we should learn
[36:23] from israel's mistakes amen
[36:25] how many are learning from job's
[36:26] mistakes out there anybody learn out
[36:28] there praise god
[36:29] that's what the bible says we're
[36:30] supposed to do praise god come together
[36:32] read the old testament we should learn
[36:34] from that
[36:35] amen now verse
[36:39] 13. actually let's read verse 12 because
[36:43] this is where job failed
[36:44] wherefore let him that thinketh he
[36:46] standeth take heed lest he fall remember
[36:48] he said
[36:48] i got ease i started taking it a little
[36:51] easy on my walk with god
[36:53] i stopped looking for that lion that was
[36:55] seeking to devour me
[36:57] he started taking it easy verse 13
[37:00] there's no temptation taken you but was
[37:03] but such as
[37:04] is common to man but god is faithful who
[37:06] will not suffer you be tempted above
[37:08] that you're able
[37:09] but will with the temptation also make a
[37:11] way to escape that ye may be able
[37:13] to bear it amen that's what elijah said
[37:17] elijah said he will not lay upon man
[37:20] more than what's right amen
[37:23] god will not mistreat us amen god will
[37:25] be he will be faithful to us
[37:27] he'll respect us praise god he won't
[37:29] give us more than we can handle he
[37:31] doesn't
[37:31] delight in us making mistakes he wants
[37:34] to see us overcome praise god
[37:36] hallelujah so see he won't give us more
[37:40] than we can handle not 31 to 37 this
[37:42] must be an important section here
[37:43] because it's such a sixth verse's law
[37:49] so eli who shows job how to repent amen
[37:53] and this also says job was not always
[37:55] wise
[37:56] and he gives a strong rebuke okay so 31
[38:00] surely it is meat to be said unto god i
[38:02] have borne chastisement i will not
[38:04] offend any more
[38:05] so see this is what you should say job i
[38:08] will not offend you anymore
[38:09] that which i see not teach thou me if
[38:12] i've done iniquity i will do no more
[38:14] praise god amen now remember he did do
[38:17] iniquity that's what he said we saw that
[38:19] earlier today
[38:20] okay 32 no i'm sorry 33
[38:24] shouldn't it be according to thy mind he
[38:27] will recompense it whether thou refuse
[38:29] or whether thou
[38:30] choose and not i therefore speak what
[38:32] thou knowest
[38:33] let men of understanding tell me and let
[38:35] a wise man hearken unto me let's see
[38:37] we're going down to
[38:38] 37 okay end of the chapter job has
[38:41] spoken without knowledge and look what
[38:42] he says
[38:43] you spoke and you didn't understand what
[38:45] you were saying how many times do we see
[38:46] that in people's lives
[38:48] they speak things off they don't even
[38:49] know what they're saying
[38:51] right and his words were without wisdom
[38:54] so in other words job was foolish
[38:57] remember he was wise at the beginning
[38:58] his wife was foolish
[39:00] but what happened to him he became
[39:02] foolish by uh giving in to the
[39:05] the wrong thoughts and listening to
[39:06] other people's words right taking in the
[39:09] scorning words
[39:11] so he became foolish verse 36 my desires
[39:14] that job may be tried unto the end
[39:16] because of his answers for wicked men
[39:19] wow she wants job to be judged
[39:23] i want job to be tried by god
[39:26] and that's exactly what happened praise
[39:28] god amen this is christ
[39:31] for he added now look my goodness i
[39:33] didn't see look at this one
[39:34] for he added rebellion unto his sin
[39:38] so not only is he iniquity pride
[39:42] lazy scornful he's rebellious
[39:50] really church really i mean think about
[39:51] this
[39:53] he has rebellion under his sin he
[39:55] clapped with his hands among us and
[39:56] multiplied his words
[39:58] against god
[40:03] so you know someone is in a very sad
[40:04] condition when they're saying
[40:06] lots of words against god right
[40:10] just watch their words that when they're
[40:12] speaking against god
[40:14] they're in rebellion
[40:18] so what a what a chapter praise god
[40:20] church what a chapter
[40:22] i hope you've seen now things about job
[40:24] you didn't know before right i know i
[40:26] have
[40:26] i might have i i read and highlighted
[40:28] this years ago and i forgot it
[40:31] but now it's come at this time for a
[40:32] time and season a purpose
[40:34] there's a purpose for knowing it now
[40:37] praise god for any trials of course
[40:38] we have trials every year for the trials
[40:40] of this year we want to be ready
[40:42] right we don't want to charge god
[40:43] foolishly we want to be ready to praise
[40:45] god in the midst of the storm praise god
[40:48] amen now 35 1-3
[40:52] eli who repeats job's claimed that he
[40:54] was more righteous than god so read that
[40:56] this is a very short chapter well 16
[40:59] verses but they're short
[41:01] elihu spake moreover and said think it's
[41:04] thou this to be right that thou has said
[41:06] my righteousness is more than god's do
[41:09] you think it's right to say this job
[41:10] that you're more righteous than god
[41:13] for thou said us what advantage will it
[41:15] be unto thee
[41:17] and what prophet shall i have if i be
[41:18] cleansed from my sin
[41:21] my goodness so see job was
[41:24] he was in a really bad place i'll just
[41:26] say like that yeah and that church i'll
[41:28] simply say like this it's a place i've
[41:29] never been
[41:30] i've never lost 5 million i've never
[41:32] lost 10 children
[41:34] i've never lost my health right i've
[41:37] lost
[41:37] i've lost little things of those you
[41:39] know maybe finances and
[41:41] sick for a little bit but this guy has
[41:43] lost everything in a matter of months
[41:46] so that's why i'm not judging him i'm
[41:47] not looking down upon him but i'm trying
[41:49] to get us to see that god is very
[41:51] gracious
[41:52] and god is very merciful praise god amen
[41:54] in the midst of
[41:55] our evil words in the midst of our
[41:57] complaining god will be faithful to us
[42:00] amen now verses four and five look
[42:04] now eli who says look to the clouds to
[42:06] see how much greater god is
[42:09] so see job understandably was looking
[42:12] down at his situation
[42:14] and he said god is going to teach job
[42:17] the same thing
[42:18] that eli who is teaching him so verse 4
[42:19] and 5. i will answer thee and
[42:22] thy companions with thee look unto the
[42:23] heavens and see and behold the clouds
[42:25] which are higher
[42:27] than thou in other words look higher
[42:29] than where you're looking praise god
[42:31] right stop looking so low look higher
[42:34] now look at verse
[42:35] 13 to 16 god is angry
[42:39] uh god is angry with joe i put god up
[42:42] there sorry that's wrong
[42:43] god is angry that should be job by fall
[42:48] 13-16 surely god will not hear vanity
[42:52] neither will the almighty regard it
[42:54] although thou sayest thou
[42:55] shalt not see him yet judgment is before
[42:58] him therefore
[42:59] trust thou and him so see job wasn't
[43:01] trusting see
[43:03] elijah is here to correct him to help
[43:05] him right to be the mediator
[43:07] to bring peace between job and god right
[43:11] and elijah is saying you need to trust
[43:13] in god amen
[43:14] praise god let's trust in god in the
[43:17] midst of our storms amen
[43:20] 15 but now because it is not so he has
[43:23] visited in his
[43:24] anger so he's angry with god i'm sorry
[43:26] god's anger with job
[43:27] yet he knoweth it not in great extremity
[43:30] but it's not going to be too extreme
[43:32] so even god in his anger is going to be
[43:34] is going to be
[43:35] merciful to us therefore death job open
[43:39] his mouth
[43:40] in vain he multiplies words
[43:43] without knowledge wow so what's
[43:46] that that's the same accusation the
[43:48] other chapter ended with
[43:49] chapter 34. job's talking too much
[43:53] his words are vain his words don't mean
[43:56] anything
[43:57] right his words are not helping the
[43:59] matter
[44:01] see how there's life and death in the
[44:02] power of the tongue we've got to make
[44:04] sure we're speaking life into the
[44:06] situation
[44:07] let's not waste our words let's make
[44:09] them useful praise god
[44:10] for the kingdom of god amen
[44:16] keep going here elihu
[44:21] let's see how many more slides i got
[44:24] okay some of these maybe won't read
[44:26] through all of them but let me just go
[44:28] through 36 1-3
[44:29] eli who speaks of god's behalf
[44:32] showing god's righteousness he shows his
[44:35] dealings with kings
[44:37] righteous men and wicked men so now
[44:39] elijah starts showing
[44:40] how god is faithful with all men right
[44:43] with kings and
[44:44] and common man right righteous men
[44:47] unrighteous men
[44:48] god is righteous and that's chapter 36
[44:53] let's skip ahead now to 37.
[44:57] god's power in creation is explained in
[45:00] chapter 37. verses 14 to 24 elijah
[45:06] for runs god's 60-plus nature related
[45:10] questions for job
[45:11] and he says god is excellent in judgment
[45:14] amen
[45:15] so job has been saying god doesn't judge
[45:17] right god doesn't judge right
[45:18] and eli who comes and said god is
[45:20] excellent in judgment praise god
[45:22] god is fair in judgment amen he's done
[45:25] exactly what he had to do
[45:26] job job's like god doesn't know what
[45:29] he's doing he lies as he
[45:30] knows exactly what he's doing amen he's
[45:33] faithful
[45:35] so see and this is
[45:38] this is a forerunner here to what god is
[45:42] going to say to job himself
[45:46] okay now verse 37 ends
[45:54] i'm going to read 37 24 the last verse
[45:56] of 37
[45:58] men do therefore fear him he respecteth
[46:00] not any that are wise
[46:02] of heart so again he's rebuking job
[46:06] you're too wise for yourself right
[46:08] you've got a foolishness
[46:10] a false wisdom you think you're so smart
[46:12] but you're not and then saints all of a
[46:14] sudden
[46:16] the atmosphere changes right
[46:20] up to this point you just got men
[46:21] arguing and debating you know
[46:23] one sits up one stands up at a time the
[46:25] first one stands then job stands they
[46:27] take turns
[46:28] all of a sudden the atmosphere changes
[46:31] imagine the clouds start rolling in
[46:33] church
[46:35] allahu looks around he said i knew he
[46:37] was coming
[46:38] he told me he was coming all the friends
[46:41] you imagine those three friends hold
[46:42] them together
[46:43] imagine job hiding himself all of a
[46:46] sudden the storm clouds come in
[46:48] and then the wind picks up and pretty
[46:51] soon the wind starts circling around
[46:53] like a tornado praise god
[46:56] and pretty soon that tornado looks far
[46:58] off it starts coming
[46:59] really really close and these men these
[47:02] little men like
[47:03] i love how god does this he comes in a
[47:05] way where they can't deny it
[47:07] they can't change it they can't affect
[47:09] it because the power is greater than
[47:11] their power amen
[47:12] remember for these men by the amen think
[47:15] they know all about it
[47:16] they think they know how everything
[47:18] works right they're so much wiser in
[47:20] their judgment than god
[47:21] and so how does god reveal himself to
[47:23] them in a whirlwind
[47:26] they can't control it they can't stop it
[47:29] praise god
[47:30] they can't explain it praise god amen
[47:34] this is how god in his wisdom comes to
[47:36] correct
[47:37] his son that he loves so much
[47:41] he comes in the form of a whirlwind now
[47:42] wouldn't it be a disastrous whirlwind it
[47:44] would be a whirlwind
[47:45] and probably god's theophany body you
[47:47] might see the outline of the son of god
[47:49] in there
[47:50] that's what some of the commentators
[47:51] think because it wouldn't be like the
[47:53] destructive whirlwind right
[47:55] that took down job's house for us where
[47:57] sons and daughters passed away it
[47:59] wouldn't be like that
[48:00] it'd be a divine whirlwind praise god
[48:02] like the one brother ram saw and that
[48:04] talk to him in the trees when he was a
[48:06] little boy praise god
[48:10] so god comes in a way that these men
[48:12] can't control
[48:13] they can't explain
[48:17] and what's god's first words to job
[48:21] i love this look at this god is so
[48:23] gracious verse 1. then the lord answered
[48:25] job out of the whirlwind and said
[48:28] well done prophet of god
[48:32] nope job god says this he says
[48:36] who are you who do you think you are
[48:41] remember god let god look how merciful
[48:44] god is he let these men spew off and say
[48:46] i'm better than god
[48:47] i'm better than god god doesn't know
[48:48] what he's doing god doesn't know what
[48:50] he's doing
[48:51] while at that very time god is saying
[48:52] have you considered my servant job
[48:54] that's what he says to the devil he's
[48:56] bragging on job
[48:59] and job's like i'm better than you
[49:03] now god leaves that holy dimension
[49:05] praise god where the blood of
[49:07] where god's uh keeping track of the
[49:09] sacrifices
[49:10] and he comes down here to talk to his
[49:12] child
[49:14] and he says who are you i love that
[49:18] i love that question who am i i know
[49:21] because it's a very easy answer
[49:22] nobody right who are you brother bank
[49:26] who am i
[49:26] who are you amen nobody
[49:30] that's a great question to ask praise
[49:31] god amen
[49:33] who am i that i should speak against the
[49:36] almighty god
[49:37] amen so his first his first word to job
[49:41] is
[49:42] is not i love you so much thank you for
[49:45] trying your best to make it through your
[49:46] trials
[49:48] no i remember church he's still got
[49:50] black skin right
[49:51] he's got bruises uh it's dying it's kang
[49:54] or maybe yellowish you know
[49:56] he still lost his hair he's got boils he
[49:59] says who are you
[50:01] because remember this man exalted him
[50:04] exalted himself above god
[50:10] not and like i heard a preacher say this
[50:12] he said
[50:13] basically the next few chapters are just
[50:15] god saying job
[50:16] you are ignorant
[50:18] [Laughter]
[50:20] i thought that's a good answer right
[50:22] there
[50:23] and how many would say that we need
[50:25] god's help to not be ignorant as well
[50:27] praise god
[50:28] see we just speak things that just let
[50:30] it fly out
[50:32] like for example we'll criticize the
[50:34] leaders and say oh wish they should have
[50:35] did this
[50:36] well it's easy to say that because you
[50:38] weren't in the position right
[50:41] right let a big emergency come upon you
[50:43] let's see if you make
[50:44] exactly the right decision nothing wrong
[50:47] with it
[50:49] oh you'll probably make a mistake right
[50:50] because we're all prone to make mistakes
[50:53] so god's first words who are you
[50:57] and not only that but who are you that
[50:58] darkeneth
[51:01] who are you that perverts the word of
[51:03] god
[51:05] you're darkening it you're not more
[51:07] light
[51:08] you're darkening it
[51:12] without knowledge who is this man
[51:16] who's preaching false doctrine right
[51:18] that doesn't have the knowledge of god
[51:22] yeah member up in heaven he's a perfect
[51:24] man satan
[51:27] wow church see this is amazing amazing
[51:31] god's mercy and god's love
[51:37] then he says verse three gird up thy
[51:39] loins like a man now that means you're
[51:41] ready to work
[51:42] in other words god said get ready to
[51:43] work come on get ready to get ready to
[51:45] uh do something for me get ready to show
[51:48] me your power boy
[51:50] gird up your loins like a man
[51:54] for i will demand of thee and answer
[51:56] thou me cause remember he just demanded
[51:58] oh i wish i could talk to god i wish i
[52:00] could talk to him
[52:01] he said you want to talk to me come on
[52:02] up girl up your loins let's see what you
[52:05] got
[52:05] you're gonna answer and i said i'm gonna
[52:06] make you answer my questions
[52:09] my what a
[52:13] scene what a
[52:16] uh what a humbling situation for our
[52:18] dear friend job
[52:23] this is why brother ram will say many
[52:26] times god has to get a child of god
[52:28] on their back in order to look up to
[52:30] heaven
[52:33] this is why the bible says if you don't
[52:34] take the communion worthily
[52:37] many are sick and weakly among you
[52:40] because god remember we saw he's
[52:42] gracious he's pleading with them just
[52:44] just say the right thing just learn from
[52:46] me but then they're trying to exalt
[52:47] themselves
[52:48] like there's something special i know
[52:51] more about it
[52:52] i got more revelation than god i can oh
[52:55] my mercy now you know this
[53:00] you know as i told you there's over 60

[57:08] hailstones somewhere
[57:10] he says have you do you know where that

[58:45] humbling about this year with i believe
[58:47] the sign attacking brother branham
[58:48] they've given us a lot of questions

[58:53] we're not going to curse god
[58:55] we're not going to curse his prophet
[58:56] we're going to trust god amen
[59:00] look at this
[59:03] and now he goes back down to earth after
[59:05] going up to the heavens he comes back
[59:07] down to earth to the animal life
[59:10] verse 39 wilt thou hunt the prey for the
[59:14] lion
[59:15] in other words god is saying i give the
[59:17] lion food to eat are you going to give

[59:24] who makes job can you make sure the
[59:26] lions get every meat that they need so

[59:31] time keeping care of his goats and
[59:33] calves right
[59:34] right we have a hard enough time with
[59:35] our animals
[59:38] right so god is giving him so much to
[59:41] think about verse 41
[59:43] who provideth for the raven is food when
[59:46] his young ones cry unto god they
[59:48] wander for lack of meat think about that

[1:00:28] praise god amen
[1:00:35] a virtual tour of the universe
[1:00:39] now in chapter 39
[1:00:43] he goes on more look at verse one notice
[1:00:46] the other time when the wild goats of
[1:00:47] the rock bring forth
[1:00:48] or can't stop mark when the heinz do
[1:00:50] calve
[1:00:53] so are you gonna are gonna are you gonna
[1:00:54] help all the the baby

[1:01:02] the right way gonna take care of them
[1:01:05] make sure make sure that's taken care of
[1:01:08] right
[1:01:10] he says verse two can you number the
[1:01:12] months that they fulfill or know us
[1:01:14] out of the time when they bring forth do
[1:01:16] you know how many months they need until
[1:01:18] they're
[1:01:18] giving birth right now some scientists
[1:01:21] might be able to remember some of that
[1:01:22] information
[1:01:24] but job was not that kind right we know
[1:01:26] he wasn't he was more of a spiritual man
[1:01:29] so god is asking him all these
[1:01:30] scientific questions
[1:01:33] and of course job doesn't have any
[1:01:36] answers
[1:01:39] he talks about the mountains in verse 8
[1:01:42] the wings of peacocks in verse
[1:01:44] 13.
[1:01:48] now look at this one yeah look at the
[1:01:50] peacocks look at verse 14 which leaveth
[1:01:53] her eggs in the earth and warmeth them
[1:01:55] in dust and forget it that the foot may
[1:01:56] crush them
[1:01:57] or the wild beast may break them so god
[1:02:00] even says look
[1:02:01] i make the great animals but i also make
[1:02:04] the ones that are not so smart
[1:02:07] see he's letting he's letting god he's
[1:02:09] letting job no i do all these great
[1:02:11] things
[1:02:12] but i make all these humble things too
[1:02:14] i'm in charge of all of it
[1:02:17] i make strong great awesome animals and
[1:02:19] i make foolish animals
[1:02:22] they leave their eggs around they get
[1:02:24] smashed
[1:02:26] i make those so that means god even
[1:02:29] makes mosquitoes right
[1:02:32] i can't really say i'm really thankful
[1:02:33] for those all the time
[1:02:36] but god's saying i do the foolish i do
[1:02:38] these things that seem foolish to you
[1:02:40] i make foolish animals why because they
[1:02:42] all have a purpose right
[1:02:44] they all have a purpose
[1:02:47] yeah look at verse 17 god deprived her
[1:02:50] of wisdom
[1:02:51] so god didn't give this peacock enough
[1:02:53] wisdom
[1:02:55] god did that remember church don't get
[1:02:57] discouraged now remember the bible said
[1:02:59] god makes some rich and god makes some
[1:03:00] poor
[1:03:02] so don't get discouraged about our
[1:03:03] financial conditions now it's different
[1:03:04] if we've done sin then we need to make
[1:03:06] it right right
[1:03:08] but if we're faithful with our tithes
[1:03:09] and offerings that we're faithful and
[1:03:10] we're giving people
[1:03:11] then god will be with us but there are
[1:03:13] certain people
[1:03:14] god is made really smart and maybe not
[1:03:17] so smart
[1:03:19] right there's certain people god has
[1:03:20] made rich and certain ones god made poor
[1:03:24] he's in control of all this
[1:03:28] and then he goes into the horse in
[1:03:30] verses 19 to 25
[1:03:32] he talks about the horse look at verse
[1:03:34] 19 has to have given the horse his
[1:03:36] strength has to have clothed his neck
[1:03:38] with thunder
[1:03:39] canst thou make him afraid as a
[1:03:40] grasshopper the glory of his nostrils is
[1:03:43] terrible so he talks about a horse in
[1:03:45] battle
[1:03:46] can you can you make that horse afraid
[1:03:48] he's like no
[1:03:50] right you can't you can't even control
[1:03:52] that horse the horse will run into
[1:03:54] battle
[1:03:54] so see it's getting closer and closer to
[1:03:56] job right
[1:04:01] the bible said he laughs at the trumpets
[1:04:03] the war horses now
[1:04:05] they have fierceness and rage in verse
[1:04:07] 24 they run right into the battle at the
[1:04:09] sound of the trumpet
[1:04:12] and job can't even control them
[1:04:15] look at verse 26 does the hawk fly by
[1:04:18] thy wisdom and stretch out her wings
[1:04:19] toward the south
[1:04:20] does the eagle mount up at thy command
[1:04:22] amen praise god
[1:04:25] you sometimes i wonder where are those
[1:04:26] hawks and eagles going they're going
[1:04:28] somewhere where god commanded them to go
[1:04:31] god's commanding them to come up higher
[1:04:33] god's commanding them to go nests and
[1:04:34] roost up there
[1:04:36] god is directing them praise god
[1:04:44] now i did forget this look at chapter

[1:04:47] bit here i'm sorry

[1:09:01] god ends this discussion with job by
[1:09:04] showing him two amazing
[1:09:06] animals right
[1:09:10] so he takes him around the universe
[1:09:12] right takes him up to the stars
[1:09:14] down the bottom of the ocean he takes
[1:09:17] him out in the weather
[1:09:18] in the skies and all these things and
[1:09:20] then he finally brings it down to this
[1:09:22] and he says
[1:09:22] i'm going to give you two different
[1:09:24] animals
[1:09:27] in chapter 40 verse
[1:09:32] 15. because he says in verse 14 then
[1:09:35] while i also confess to me that thine

[1:09:51] from the behemoth
[1:09:52] which i made with thee he eat his graph

[1:09:59] it was a brontosaurus or brachiosaurus
[1:10:01] it was a dinosaur
[1:10:05] yeah look at verse 17 they say oh it's a
[1:10:08] hippopotamus he moved with his tail like
[1:10:10] a cedar
[1:10:11] a hippopotamus has a tiny tail anyone
[1:10:14] knows that
[1:10:15] this animal had a tail like a cedar tree
[1:10:18] so
[1:10:19] his tail is like this it's massive right
[1:10:21] a cedar tree
[1:10:22] that's not a hippo that's a
[1:10:24] brachiosaurus
[1:10:26] what's the biggest one gigantosaurus

[1:10:46] and the big huge belly and the four legs
[1:10:50] look at verse 19 he's the chief of the
[1:10:52] ways of god amen
[1:10:56] so it says save yourself from the
[1:10:58] brachiosaurus
[1:11:00] he's the chief of the ways of god
[1:11:03] he that made him made him make his sword
[1:11:05] to approach unto him
[1:11:08] the mountains are food for him in verse
[1:11:10] 20.
[1:11:11] oh my god he drinks up a river and
[1:11:14] doesn't even
[1:11:15] doesn't even blink an eye that's in
[1:11:16] verse verse 23
[1:11:22] yeah he just drinks up a river can you
[1:11:23] defend yourself can you save yourself
[1:11:25] against the brachiosaurus
[1:11:28] he brings it down to two beasts the last
[1:11:31] one is the leviathan
[1:11:32] leviathan is a water dinosaur
[1:11:37] god says you can't get him with a hook
[1:11:39] in his nose
[1:11:41] right he won't make a covenant with you
[1:11:44] in verse 4 so he won't surrender to you
[1:11:46] this fire breathing dinosaur
[1:11:52] verse 10 none is so fierce that dare
[1:11:55] stir him up who then is able to stand
[1:11:56] before me
[1:11:57] praise god so there used to be dragons
[1:12:00] in the sea right before the flood
[1:12:01] there should be dragons in the sea and
[1:12:04] he said no one would dare stir this
[1:12:05] animal up
[1:12:08] how are you going to fight against me if
[1:12:10] you can't even handle my animal my
[1:12:11] little pets
[1:12:12] how you going to handle me come on joe
[1:12:15] gird yourself up fight the leviathan
[1:12:17] right fight the behemoth go ahead
[1:12:20] get your get your belt ready show me how
[1:12:23] great you are job
[1:12:26] same thing for us let's not think about
[1:12:29] how great we are because we're nothing
[1:12:32] let's remember how great our god is
[1:12:36] let's remember i'm vile i'm a failure
[1:12:40] i can't do anything without his help
[1:12:42] without jesus i can do nothing
[1:12:48] yeah he was a fire fire-breathing dragon
[1:12:51] look at verse 15 his scales
[1:12:52] are his pride so the scales on this this
[1:12:54] dinosaur
[1:12:56] shut up together as with a closed seal
[1:12:59] one is so near to the other that no air
[1:13:00] can come between them
[1:13:05] uh the bible says the spears can't even
[1:13:08] pierce him this this
[1:13:09] uh this dinosaur of the the sea was so
[1:13:12] great
[1:13:13] a spear could even prod him yeah look at
[1:13:16] verse 29 darts are counted as stubble
[1:13:18] he laughed without the shaking of a
[1:13:19] spear so whatever dinosaur this was
[1:13:22] he didn't care about the men's spears
[1:13:24] didn't bother him look at verse 19 out
[1:13:26] of his mouth go burning lamps
[1:13:28] and sparks of fire leap out this was a
[1:13:31] fire
[1:13:32] breathing dinosaur
[1:13:35] and god said can you handle this guy if
[1:13:39] so what about me
[1:13:40] and if not what about me
[1:13:46] he actually made the seed to boil like a
[1:13:48] pot in verse 31 he would breathe
[1:13:49] underwater
[1:13:50] he made the seas hot and boiled verse 33
[1:13:54] upon earth there is not his like
[1:13:56] who is made without fear he belongeth he
[1:14:00] beholdeth all high things he is king
[1:14:02] over all the children of pride
[1:14:05] and then church he god ends with that
[1:14:08] this this uh sea dragon dinosaur
[1:14:11] is the he's the king over all the
[1:14:14] children of pride
[1:14:15] god says and then all of a sudden
[1:14:19] the clouds roll back and god is gone
[1:14:23] god just goes like that and he ends by
[1:14:27] by ending with this uh this dinosaur
[1:14:30] from the sea
[1:14:31] is the greatest of all my creations
[1:14:34] greater than all the children of men
[1:14:36] job
[1:14:39] and god just goes did god answer job's
[1:14:42] questions directly
[1:14:43] not directly not exactly
[1:14:49] but he did answer praise god amen he
[1:14:52] answered in a specific kind of way
[1:14:57] now i want to get to this thought here
[1:15:03] let's yeah let's let's go to this
[1:15:04] thought here let's go go now
[1:15:07] to the blood i just want to end with a
[1:15:08] few thoughts about the blood i'm going
[1:15:09] to do it on time
[1:15:11] i must have i must have stopped my timer
[1:15:13] sorry
[1:15:14] man i thought i got that okay now look
[1:15:16] what he says i want you to notice
[1:15:17] closely job then in all of his distress
[1:15:19] sitting out there
[1:15:20] church members come and turn their back
[1:15:21] on him for seven days little later
[1:15:23] about any man that comes and said job
[1:15:25] you're a secret sinner you've done
[1:15:26] something wrong you've sinned secretly
[1:15:28] job knew he'd not sinned because he come
[1:15:30] upon the basis of god's word
[1:15:33] in other words job didn't have any sin
[1:15:35] that wasn't covered by the blood praise
[1:15:37] god
[1:15:38] see he had fears he said words but he
[1:15:41] always
[1:15:42] brought the sacrifice amen he always had
[1:15:45] a blood sacrifice waiting for him amen
[1:15:48] amen in other words he always confessed
[1:15:50] his sin to god
[1:15:52] praise god he didn't let days and weeks
[1:15:55] go by without saying jesus i'm sorry
[1:15:57] forgive me my sins you know of course it
[1:15:58] was yahweh
[1:16:00] lord jehovah
[1:16:04] see he come upon the basis of the shed
[1:16:06] blood knowing that god required a blood
[1:16:08] sacrifice
[1:16:09] and blood was what job offered knowing
[1:16:12] that god could not refuse it amen
[1:16:15] the whole picture is a perfect
[1:16:17] revelation amen
[1:16:21] the whole picture of what job's
[1:16:23] perfection is a picture of revelation
[1:16:26] we are perfect before god not based upon
[1:16:29] our
[1:16:29] efforts but by meeting god's requirement
[1:16:32] of blood sacrifice
[1:16:34] amen oh my god it's a perfect
[1:16:37] revelation of fellowship with god
[1:16:40] almighty
[1:16:41] fellowship through the blood
[1:16:44] oh thank you lord say prove it i would
[1:16:47] love to
[1:16:49] now the god of peace we're saying about
[1:16:51] peace this morning peace of god cover me
[1:16:53] that bringeth again from the dead our
[1:16:54] lord jesus that great shepherd of
[1:16:56] the sheep through the blood of the
[1:16:57] everlasting covenant make you
[1:16:59] perfect and who else was perfect job
[1:17:03] job so now the new testament saying were
[1:17:06] perfect through the blood
[1:17:07] just like the old testament said john
[1:17:09] was perfect through the blood amen
[1:17:12] one was animal and the next is the son
[1:17:14] of god amen the lamb of god who takes
[1:17:16] away the sin of the world
[1:17:19] see both of us can be perfect in that
[1:17:20] beautiful praise god
[1:17:22] both job in the old testament abraham
[1:17:24] and moses and david
[1:17:25] they were perfect so are we perfect but
[1:17:28] our covenant speaks better promises than
[1:17:30] that of the old
[1:17:31] amen so the blood brother amen will make
[1:17:35] us perfect in every good work the
[1:17:38] blood's gonna do that
[1:17:40] what does that mean well the blood
[1:17:42] offers forgiveness now i gotta
[1:17:44] yeah so job kept offering remember in
[1:17:45] chapter one he kept offering burnt
[1:17:47] sacrifices he kept trusting in the power
[1:17:49] of the blood
[1:17:51] oh that's what i'm trusting in tonight
[1:17:52] amen amen i'm trusting not in my power
[1:17:55] but in the power of jesus's blood amen
[1:17:56] amen
[1:17:58] because remember what does the blood the
[1:18:00] blood do the blood gives us
[1:18:02] redemption right remember i don't know
[1:18:05] the scripture but
[1:18:06] romans 5 says we have faith in the blood
[1:18:09] see so forgiveness of sins
[1:18:12] redemption was redemption it's a
[1:18:14] releasing of ransom
[1:18:16] it's deliverance it's liberation from
[1:18:19] guilt praise god
[1:18:21] this is how we're perfect this is how we
[1:18:23] can actually do a work for god
[1:18:26] by trusting in the blood by trusting
[1:18:28] that the blood
[1:18:29] frees us from our guilt amen frees us
[1:18:32] from our condemnation
[1:18:34] amen frees us from our complexes right
[1:18:38] the blood freezes from that and we
[1:18:40] become redeemed
[1:18:42] we become perfect we're delivered praise
[1:18:44] god
[1:18:45] we're seen as perfect in the eyes of god
[1:18:48] and god can use us for little humble
[1:18:50] works of service
[1:18:52] oh thank you jesus praise god i love it
[1:18:56] and remember this is this is the whole
[1:18:58] key here church i know it's very
[1:18:59] familiar
[1:19:00] but if we confess our sins he's faithful
[1:19:02] and just to forgive our sins
[1:19:04] and to cleanse us from all
[1:19:05] unrighteousness right
[1:19:08] and if we walk in the light now which
[1:19:09] verse is that let me turn that real
[1:19:10] quick
[1:19:11] we walk in the light as he's in the
[1:19:12] light the blood of jesus christ cleanses
[1:19:14] us from all righteousness
[1:19:20] yeah verse seven i don't have it up here
[1:19:22] verse seven says if we walk in the light
[1:19:23] as he's in the light
[1:19:24] we have fellowship one with another and
[1:19:26] the blood of jesus christ his son
[1:19:28] cleanses us from all sin amen
[1:19:32] ah the power of the blood so see foolish
[1:19:34] bush virgins won't be confessing it as
[1:19:36] much as we will
[1:19:38] right because they can't do all the
[1:19:39] perfect works of god okay
[1:19:41] sinners they won't be confessing
[1:19:43] anything right
[1:19:45] so we've got to constantly confess our
[1:19:46] sins and that will
[1:19:48] help us feel forgiven help us walk and
[1:19:50] we'll walk in the light we won't be in
[1:19:52] darkness we'll be in the light
[1:19:53] amen we'll see what god wants us to do
[1:19:56] and we'll do god's perfect will
[1:19:57] through the blood just like job did it
[1:20:00] through the blood as well
[1:20:03] now here's what i wanted to show you
[1:20:05] there's at least
[1:20:06] uh four benefits to suffering
[1:20:11] i know it's kind of hard to get go to
[1:20:13] this but i found this quote today this
[1:20:14] is beautiful
[1:20:15] look at job a perfect man a just man and
[1:20:17] god permitted the evil devil to come
[1:20:19] upon him and chasten him
[1:20:20] or chastise him and everything else for
[1:20:22] what the perfecting of his
[1:20:24] spirit right not his flesh
[1:20:28] his mind see all these trials we go
[1:20:32] through
[1:20:32] and so we'll be stronger in our minds
[1:20:35] see so evil spirits god uses evil
[1:20:37] spirits many times
[1:20:38] to work out his plan and his will i
[1:20:41] thought that was so beautiful
[1:20:43] god wants to perfect your thinking god
[1:20:46] wants you to think
[1:20:47] perfectly and precisely about the things
[1:20:49] happening in your life
[1:20:50] to always make sure you think the right
[1:20:52] things about him
[1:20:56] now this is really small but this is
[1:20:58] schofield um
[1:21:00] i will just skip ahead to the next one
[1:21:02] because that's so small let me read it
[1:21:03] i'll just i'll just skip to these
[1:21:04] because i'm proud i'm probably an hour
[1:21:06] right i'm probably
[1:21:08] did anybody think i'm at an hour honey
[1:21:10] do you think i'm gonna yeah okay
[1:21:12] so let me finish up here i'm almost done
[1:21:15] yeah i'm almost done
[1:21:17] i got one two three four more slides
[1:21:23] so the first thing it will do suffering
[1:21:25] will bring you
[1:21:26] self knowledge and self-judgment
[1:21:29] and that brings you to humility and the
[1:21:32] reason you need humility is so you can
[1:21:34] reign
[1:21:36] because god doesn't want a prideful
[1:21:37] ruler that's what we got today church
[1:21:39] and look
[1:21:40] look at the mess we got they're all
[1:21:43] prideful they're doing it because they
[1:21:44] think
[1:21:45] everything the decision they make is to
[1:21:46] exalt themselves look at these governors
[1:21:49] and mayors and
[1:21:50] man look at the presidents and you know
[1:21:52] look at these congressmen and
[1:21:53] congresswoman
[1:21:54] they're all pride but ii timothy 2 verse
[1:21:57] 12
[1:21:58] says if we must reign with him we must
[1:22:00] suffer with him
[1:22:02] so suffering is directly connected to
[1:22:04] being able to rule
[1:22:06] when you suffer it gives you a better
[1:22:08] perspective how to rule
[1:22:11] because you can relate to how other
[1:22:13] people are suffering
[1:22:15] if you suffer you can relate to those
[1:22:17] who suffer
[1:22:21] like any time people have children
[1:22:22] trouble you know like you know they're
[1:22:24] have trouble with their children i can
[1:22:25] relate to that
[1:22:27] i haven't always known how to treat my
[1:22:28] children and
[1:22:30] people have uh you know people have
[1:22:33] struggles with having a small church
[1:22:35] like i've had people email me and text
[1:22:36] me oh i'm a pastor of a small church too
[1:22:38] well i can enter into your sufferings
[1:22:39] you know i know all about that
[1:22:41] i gotta work and preach yeah yeah i can
[1:22:43] enter that suffering
[1:22:45] well i had covert yeah i can relate to
[1:22:47] that yeah
[1:22:47] [Laughter]
[1:22:49] praise god i'm just happy forgive me i'm
[1:22:51] just happy today by god's grace
[1:22:53] but i can relate to those things
[1:22:55] anything i suffer
[1:22:57] i can relate to and then that will give
[1:23:00] me wisdom to make the right judgment
[1:23:03] now the the scofield said calls this
[1:23:05] self-humiliation which i agree
[1:23:07] that's why i put humility in there so
[1:23:09] when you suffer
[1:23:10] you really realize knowledge about you
[1:23:12] boy i'm not as strong as i thought i was
[1:23:15] i always think that every time well i'm
[1:23:16] not as healthy as i thought i was mercy
[1:23:19] right self-judgment oh you know
[1:23:22] i was i was too loose with myself i
[1:23:24] should have been more should have been
[1:23:25] more diligent
[1:23:28] i kind of let things slide in my life so
[1:23:31] god allows us to suffer right so we can
[1:23:34] see
[1:23:36] our self-knowledge and our self-judgment
[1:23:38] but then we'll judge correctly on the
[1:23:40] other side in heaven praise god
[1:23:42] right i'm sorry other side in the
[1:23:44] millennium praise god
[1:23:46] also jesus learned what through
[1:23:48] suffering he learned obedience
[1:23:51] so we suffer so we'll obey the word of
[1:23:53] god next time
[1:23:54] right and i love that part of it
[1:23:58] because i want to obey i don't want to
[1:24:00] lose battles to the devil
[1:24:03] right i want to defeat the devil praise
[1:24:05] god amen
[1:24:07] i want to win these wars amen i don't
[1:24:09] want to be addicted i don't want to get
[1:24:10] kicked around
[1:24:11] i don't want to be the loser i want to
[1:24:12] be the victor praise god
[1:24:16] so you suffer so you can learn how to
[1:24:17] obey next time
[1:24:19] next time i won't do this next time i
[1:24:21] won't say that next time i'll say the
[1:24:23] right thing
[1:24:25] the third thing jesus says in john 15 2
[1:24:27] i'm going to read it
[1:24:28] so i don't misquote it i know it's about
[1:24:30] pruning but if i quote it it'll be
[1:24:33] way off
[1:24:37] i am the true vine and my father is the
[1:24:39] husbandman every branch in me that
[1:24:41] beareth not fruit he taketh away
[1:24:43] and every branch that bear through he
[1:24:45] purges it that it may
[1:24:46] bring forth more fruit did you catch
[1:24:48] that sometimes
[1:24:50] you don't have fruit coming from
[1:24:51] branches so god prunes you but sometimes
[1:24:53] you do
[1:24:54] have good fruits but they get pruned
[1:24:56] anyway i thought i was really patient
[1:24:58] why haven't another test of patience
[1:25:01] right i thought i was i thought i was
[1:25:04] really joyful
[1:25:06] i feel like my joy's been taken away
[1:25:09] so the next time you'll be more joyful
[1:25:11] right because that's how it is
[1:25:12] if you trim it right my wife's trimmed
[1:25:14] the apple tree the last few years
[1:25:16] it brings forth better branches praise
[1:25:18] god
[1:25:19] with more apples
[1:25:23] so see suffering many times allows you
[1:25:25] to
[1:25:26] be even more fruitful in your life
[1:25:32] and remember the fruits of the spirit
[1:25:34] love joy peace temperance long suffering
[1:25:36] goodness gentleness kindness
[1:25:37] self-control praise god
[1:25:38] now self-control is not the exact word i
[1:25:40] think it's different but you understand
[1:25:42] galatians chapter 5. so we all want to
[1:25:45] be fruitful right we all want to be
[1:25:46] obedient
[1:25:47] we all want to reign but we all don't
[1:25:49] want to suffer
[1:25:52] and lastly one benefit of suffering
[1:25:56] is you become a strength to other people
[1:26:00] because now think of all the think of
[1:26:02] all the weaknesses of job we've heard
[1:26:04] today church
[1:26:06] yet what does james say about him what a
[1:26:08] weak man he was
[1:26:10] james says he was a patient man
[1:26:15] oh my james 5 11. this blows my mind
[1:26:20] in one way it blows my mind but another
[1:26:21] way the blood covers over it all
[1:26:23] amen the blood covers over it all church
[1:26:29] now sometimes the the bible will tell us
[1:26:30] about people's bad points right but
[1:26:32] james doesn't even mention it he don't
[1:26:35] say anything about job struggles
[1:26:37] he just says he was patient
[1:26:43] behold we count them happy witch endure
[1:26:46] so
[1:26:46] when jo when james looks at job's life
[1:26:49] he looks at a man who
[1:26:50] endured the suffering
[1:26:54] in other words god's like i don't really
[1:26:56] care what you do in between
[1:26:57] i just want you to become a chris i just
[1:26:59] want you to stay a christian on the way
[1:27:00] out
[1:27:02] right just get through it amen
[1:27:06] that's what james sees right james says
[1:27:10] happy are those
[1:27:11] who endure don't quit just don't turn
[1:27:13] around
[1:27:14] just keep going praise god you might
[1:27:16] mutter some things that you don't like
[1:27:18] and you might get spayed for it but just
[1:27:20] keep walking just keep going onward
[1:27:22] christian's shoulder
[1:27:23] don't retreat don't run back to the
[1:27:25] world stay in line with christ
[1:27:27] amen just endure it just get through it
[1:27:30] praise god amen
[1:27:34] we count them happy witch endure job
[1:27:36] endured months
[1:27:38] of sores sleepless nights arguments
[1:27:43] you've heard of the evil words of job
[1:27:47] no i said it wrong you've heard of the
[1:27:49] patience of job and have seen the end of
[1:27:51] the lord
[1:27:51] that the lord is very harsh
[1:27:55] pitiful and of tender mercy
[1:27:59] so when he was there saying okay job
[1:28:02] tell me what you can do tell me all this
[1:28:03] that was merciful to job
[1:28:07] tell me can you make the horses do this
[1:28:08] can you can you
[1:28:10] make sure all the birds get their food
[1:28:11] today
[1:28:13] come on stand up like a man boy come on
[1:28:15] that was merciful
[1:28:17] that was a pitiful god amen
[1:28:21] so see when you can endure suffering you
[1:28:24] become a testimony
[1:28:26] to other people how many want to help
[1:28:30] other people is anybody out there want
[1:28:31] to help somebody
[1:28:32] endure endure just keep running the race
[1:28:36] praise god how many will do that just
[1:28:38] keep running the race
[1:28:39] i'm closing joe passed the test it was
[1:28:42] job's own words church
[1:28:44] he said when i am come forth this i will
[1:28:47] come forth
[1:28:47] as gold that was when he was strong
[1:28:52] he said that when he was strong but if
[1:28:54] you read chapter 42
[1:28:56] he does come forth as gold
[1:29:00] i'm not going to read it because running
[1:29:01] out of time he was double rewarded with
[1:29:03] money
[1:29:05] same number of children remember as i
[1:29:08] said some will be rewarded in heaven
[1:29:10] jesus died on the cross
[1:29:11] he wasn't rewarded here on earth his
[1:29:13] reward comes later
[1:29:15] yeah yes his kingdom is not of this
[1:29:17] world not yet praise god amen
[1:29:20] at the millennium praise god his kingdom
[1:29:22] will come the kingdom of the son of
[1:29:23] david hallelujah
[1:29:25] but job was double rewarded with money
[1:29:27] here
[1:29:28] because he passed the test
[1:29:32] and job is still the example of
[1:29:35] patience in the bible just getting
[1:29:38] through it gritting your teeth and get
[1:29:40] it
[1:29:41] i'm going to make it through this i'll
[1:29:43] get through this
[1:29:45] help me god to get through without
[1:29:46] complaining
[1:29:48] without saying evil words against you
[1:29:53] let's stand last one listen notice
[1:29:56] church
[1:29:57] job never cursed god in all this
[1:30:01] he never said there's no god
[1:30:04] he never cursed god all he said now
[1:30:08] he only right because of blood he only
[1:30:11] claimed he wasn't righteous
[1:30:13] he never denied god he said there's he
[1:30:15] never said there is no god
[1:30:17] or i curse god or he just said god
[1:30:20] doesn't judge as righteously
[1:30:22] as i would
[1:30:25] only only
[1:30:30] and yet god still called him perfect
[1:30:35] i'll tell you when brother bram used
[1:30:36] that word paradox that's a real word
[1:30:38] right there
[1:30:39] he said strange but true
[1:30:43] this is all strange but this is true he
[1:30:46] was perfect in god's sight in heaven
[1:30:48] boy sure wasn't perfect on earth
[1:30:54] now look at this church in job 42 verse
[1:30:57] 7
[1:30:58] god tells job he said job you've spoken
[1:31:01] the right
[1:31:02] things but your friends haven't and so
[1:31:05] they need to repent
[1:31:07] now what is he talking about what god
[1:31:09] meant was job spoke right when he
[1:31:11] repented because we saw words where job
[1:31:13] didn't speak
[1:31:14] right like not every word of job was
[1:31:17] right
[1:31:18] but he spoke the right words when he
[1:31:19] said i'm vile and he said i repent in
[1:31:22] in dust and ashes that was the right
[1:31:25] word to say
[1:31:27] because those three friends they never
[1:31:28] repented
[1:31:31] so he says you three friends you go
[1:31:32] offer sacrifice have my
[1:31:34] prophet pray for you just like abraham
[1:31:37] writing king
[1:31:38] abimelech make sure my prophet prays for
[1:31:40] you and pharaoh right pharaoh said
[1:31:42] have abraham pray for you then your
[1:31:44] women will start having children again
[1:31:48] yet we know job wasn't sinless with his
[1:31:51] words he admitted he said i have uttered
[1:31:53] a lot of things that i did not
[1:31:55] understand
[1:31:57] musicians if you'll come here and i
[1:31:59] believe that's it i don't know if i'll
[1:32:01] go another sermon but i hope those three
[1:32:02] sermons was a nice little blessing to
[1:32:04] start the year with praise god
[1:32:05] yes i know they sure were for me this
[1:32:07] has been a beautiful study for me
[1:32:09] like i said i've never uh i never felt
[1:32:11] like i've job
[1:32:13] to the point like i do now and i hope
[1:32:16] the holy spirit
[1:32:19] brings all these things to my
[1:32:20] remembrance especially the part
[1:32:23] about the purposes of suffering
[1:32:29] praise god
