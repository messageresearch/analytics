[0:00] of burning
[0:04] tonight luk
[0:17] 2413 Luke
[0:20] 24:13 so part three on the spirit of
[0:25] burning so I had most of all these uh
[0:27] scriptures and quotes ready to preach
[0:29] that first Sunday when I preached on it
[0:30] but I didn't get hardly anywhere where I
[0:33] wanted to uh but now you're starting to
[0:36] see the and I'm starting to see it too
[0:37] I'm starting to see the thoughts of the
[0:38] Lord opening up here as we look at these
[0:41] three examples so far we looked at
[0:43] Isaiah and Jeremiah tonight we'll look
[0:44] at Copus and his friend here by God's
[0:49] grace Jeremiah
[0:54] 24:13 Hallelujah
[1:00] so I'll read 13 and 14 then we can all
[1:01] read 15 together here the Bible says and
[1:04] behold two of them went that same day to
[1:06] a village called emus which was from
[1:09] Jerusalem about three score furlongs or
[1:12] about seven
[1:13] miles and they talked together of all
[1:16] these things which had happened verse 15
[1:18] if we could read that on three one two
[1:20] three and it came to pass that while
[1:23] they communed together and reason Jesus
[1:26] himself Drew near and went with them
[1:29] amen uh if you have a need on your heart
[1:31] let's make it known unto God here we'll
[1:33] have one more word of prayer father God
[1:34] we love you we know that you've made us
[1:37] your friend you've called us you've
[1:38] chosen us before the foundation of the
[1:40] world you've ordained us to hear the
[1:41] truth to be your bride to be the wise
[1:43] virgin Lord God we know all these
[1:45] scriptures we know all these stories
[1:46] we're so thankful Lord you've called us
[1:48] to be the elect the chosen Lord God
[1:50] we're so grateful for that Lord God we
[1:53] see how this message is a higher calling
[1:55] as our brother talked to us Lord on
[1:57] Sunday and preach to us Lord God it's
[1:59] the high calling of God in Christ Jesus
[2:01] so we're grateful Lord God and we ask
[2:03] Lord that the spirit of burning would be
[2:04] here tonight Lord to help those who need
[2:06] it Lord God I'm sure each one of us
[2:08] would say we need it Lord God so you saw
[2:09] the hands that were up I pray You'
[2:11] minister to all the saints Lord look
[2:13] past my my my frailties Lord and my
[2:15] tiredness I pray and I pray just the
[2:17] Holy Spirit would have prants here
[2:18] tonight let this word Lord speak to us
[2:20] for there's only real really one
[2:22] preacher that's you the Lord Jesus may
[2:24] your spirit have full preeminence in
[2:25] this service and we'll be happy when we
[2:27] leave this place in Jesus Christ's name
[2:30] the Saints said amen God bless you as
[2:32] you're being
[2:40] seated Hallelujah so we'll start a timer
[2:42] here by God's
[2:44] grace so looking at part three here of
[2:46] the spirit of
[2:49] burning we may have a part four we'll
[2:51] kind of see how it goes by God's grace
[2:53] but in part one we looked at the how the
[2:55] spirit of burning comes after the spirit
[2:56] of
[2:57] judgment and uh Isaiah first judge
[3:00] himself unclean he said I'm a man of
[3:02] unclean uh lips and I dwell amongst a
[3:05] people of unclean lips and I think we
[3:07] could all say that uh we're people that
[3:09] dwell amongst people of unclean thoughts
[3:11] right we all have unclean thoughts at
[3:13] times we all have unclean actions right
[3:15] we all have unclean words at times we're
[3:17] people that dwell amongst each other
[3:19] right we're the ones that need the
[3:21] Holiness of God hallelujah when when
[3:24] Peter said be holy he wasn't saying uh
[3:26] you're going to be perfect but he said
[3:28] walk in the spirit right and if the if
[3:30] you're walking in the spirit you won't
[3:31] obey the things of the flesh right as
[3:34] Paul said as well so uh we know the
[3:36] spirit of God does that for us the
[3:37] spirit of God brings judgment helps us
[3:39] see where we are in our current walk
[3:41] with God and then if we're not where we
[3:43] should be the spirit of judgment helps
[3:44] us to confess our sins and then the
[3:46] spirit of burning comes and gives us an
[3:48] experience to make us clean to wash us
[3:51] how many like when you feel washed after
[3:52] you leave church how about in your home
[3:54] when you have a good prayer time in your
[3:56] home when you feel clean right or a good
[3:58] fellowship or a good worship time in
[3:59] your home or you're reading your Bible
[4:01] and something really strikes you and
[4:02] helps you uh that's what the spirit of
[4:04] burning does it gives you a in in this
[4:07] case it gave him a start to his ministry
[4:09] and as we looked at Jeremiah it gave him
[4:11] the grace to continue his ministry when
[4:13] he felt like quitting in the darkest of
[4:16] his hours and maybe some of us have been
[4:19] there before where you felt like
[4:20] quitting and no longer talking about God
[4:23] no longer witnessing and yet God would
[4:25] in his grace would come by and give you
[4:26] the strength to keep going Hallelujah
[4:29] it's just the love of God isn't it
[4:30] church it's just the love of God this
[4:32] could be of course justification and
[4:35] sanctification but we know despite our
[4:37] most difficult struggles God's spirit
[4:39] will keep us from leaving the truth
[4:41] hallelujah like Jeremiah and brother
[4:42] brandham Hallelujah God will keep us
[4:44] from leaving the truth so the spirit of
[4:47] God put Jeremiah into service um I'm
[4:50] sorry Isaiah sorry the spirit of one of
[4:52] these minutes I'm going to snap out of
[4:53] this here the the spirit of burning put
[4:56] Isaiah into service started his ministry
[4:59] and then the spirit of burning kept
[5:00] Jeremiah in service kept him from
[5:04] quitting uh and he was able of course to
[5:06] cry out to God and tonight we'll look at
[5:08] Copus and his friend and I want you to
[5:11] think what does the spirit of God uh the
[5:13] spirit of burning help them do and then
[5:14] I'll give you my thoughts at the end now
[5:16] I'm just doing my best to say this I
[5:17] don't have a quote or thus sayth the
[5:19] Lord but I'm trying to understand this
[5:22] all right so Luke we read Luke 24 13 and
[5:25] 14 uh this was on the same day of course
[5:28] of the Lord's Resurrection brother Bram
[5:29] said that was the greatest day in human
[5:31] history when with Jesus conquered death
[5:33] Hell In The Grave hallelujah we're
[5:34] coming up on it by God's grace and
[5:36] brother Ram said The woman there the
[5:38] women received the greatest message that
[5:40] could ever be given and that was he's
[5:43] not dead He's Alive Hallelujah he is
[5:46] risen just as he said No Greater message
[5:49] in the world than that Hallelujah so we
[5:51] know Jesus Christ is alive today how
[5:53] many know he's alive amen hallelujah
[5:56] they were given the greatest message
[5:57] that could ever be given they left
[5:58] Jerusalem there in verse 13 to go to a
[6:00] little village called EMAs and history
[6:03] says it wasn't that great of a village
[6:06] um one time in history it wasn't long
[6:08] after this that uh the ruler there I
[6:10] forget I don't know the exact ruler but
[6:12] he gave AAS over just as a village he
[6:14] gave it over just to the soldiers occupy
[6:16] so it was so small that uh a number of
[6:18] soldiers could fill up that Village
[6:20] wasn't a very special place we'd say uh
[6:23] so three score furlongs or about seven
[6:26] miles 11
[6:27] kilometers um
[6:30] and if you're if you're walking at a
[6:31] speed of 3 miles per hour which is the
[6:33] average walking speed on a normal Road
[6:35] you get there in about two to 2 and half
[6:37] hours but looking at how they were
[6:40] talking as we see here in the scripture
[6:42] they're talking about all the events of
[6:44] the past weekend right the uh the Last
[6:46] Supper they're talking about uh the
[6:48] arrest the trial uh the
[6:51] crucifixion uh the quiet Saturday and
[6:53] then the resurrection and all this all
[6:56] these events happening that morning of
[6:58] the Resurrection they prob weren't
[6:59] walking very fast I don't know about you
[7:02] but when you go for a walk when I go for
[7:03] a a walk with my wife there in the park
[7:05] and we're talking about something real
[7:06] serious we don't walk too fast right and
[7:09] so uh they so it's it's estimated they
[7:11] could have been talking from two to
[7:13] three hours maybe a little more
[7:15] somewhere wrong along that uh amount of
[7:18] time so that gives you an idea about how
[7:20] long they were talking and what how long
[7:22] Jesus preach to them praise God so I
[7:24] love that Jesus came out of the uh the
[7:27] shadow somewhere and starts preaching to
[7:29] them
[7:30] praise God now Copus if you're not
[7:32] familiar he's the father of uh St James
[7:37] and it's James the Lesser as far as I
[7:39] know there's at least three James that's
[7:41] a good name Vang picked out for brother
[7:42] or Little James there by God's grace
[7:43] it's a really great Bible name so cleff
[7:46] is is the father of James the Lesser
[7:49] he's the Lesser known James the other
[7:51] James was more well known James and John
[7:54] the sons of thunder right their mother
[7:56] went up to Jesus and said can my son sit
[7:58] on the right and left hand
[8:00] and then all the disciples look at them
[8:01] why you tell your mom to do that you
[8:02] know why why you think you're better
[8:03] than us why you got to act like you're a
[8:05] better somebody better than us but but
[8:07] I'll say like this at least they had a
[8:08] desire to be by Jesus's side right so
[8:10] there there's some good in that they
[8:11] just needed the Holy Ghost to clean out
[8:13] their desires amen hallelujah but this
[8:16] was the Lesser James this wasn't even
[8:18] the James uh that wrote the book of
[8:20] James that was another James a different
[8:22] James so there's at least three very uh
[8:24] prominent men named James in the early
[8:26] church there's probably more but as far
[8:28] as my studies In My Memory uh that's uh
[8:31] that's what we're finding here so this
[8:33] Copus would have known his son James
[8:36] left everything that he had known and
[8:38] followed Jesus for three and a half
[8:41] years and so I don't we don't know how
[8:43] often Copus saw his son the James the
[8:45] ler but if he did he would have heard
[8:47] the most amazing Stories Hallelujah so
[8:51] many stories you couldn't even write
[8:52] books to fill up the whole earth about
[8:54] about these stories he had he saw all
[8:57] the stories he saw Jesus walk on water
[9:00] the dead raised and funerals broken up
[9:02] Hallelujah Lazarus come forth he saw all
[9:06] the greatest Miracles right no which
[9:08] Miracles no one can even reproduce today
[9:11] right there's never been someone raised
[9:12] from the dead on the third day
[9:14] Hallelujah after the third day there
[9:16] never been done Jesus did the greatest
[9:18] Miracles because he was God in flesh
[9:20] Hallelujah and so uh Copus here he
[9:23] walking with a friend we don't know who
[9:24] it is there's lots of debate who it is I
[9:26] have no idea uh who it was but Copus as
[9:30] the father of one of the disciples would
[9:32] have known and uh a lot about Jesus and
[9:35] uh so they they start upon their Journey
[9:36] they're in a great St state of confusion
[9:38] we're going to see it later they're in a
[9:40] great state of sadness you would think
[9:42] on uh you would think on the greatest
[9:44] day ever that they'd have the greatest
[9:45] emotions but that was going to come a
[9:47] few hours later by the grace of God
[9:51] hallelujah I love how God likes to keep
[9:52] us in suspense sometimes Hallelujah God
[9:55] church God only gives us what we have
[9:57] need of at the right time when we need
[10:00] it he won't give us anything before that
[10:02] it'll always be at just the right time
[10:05] in fact as we'll see here God withheld
[10:07] so much from them because God's trying
[10:09] to get them to believe him Hallelujah so
[10:12] see God will only reveal things to us
[10:14] when we need it Hallelujah and yes he
[10:16] wants us to seek after it but there's
[10:18] also a time where yes God will give us
[10:19] things when we seek it but then God will
[10:21] also withhold things until the right
[10:23] moment when we need needed the most kind
[10:25] of like the spirit of burning praise God
[10:27] and Jeremiah when we need it the most it
[10:29] has it just has to be withheld until the
[10:31] very moment of desperation God likes to
[10:34] see his children cry out like little CH
[10:36] little children Hallelujah right like
[10:38] our little babies cry out when they're
[10:39] little ones and whe it can be annoying
[10:41] but but it's it's their way to uh it's
[10:43] their way to get what they have need of
[10:45] and brother said God loves to hear you
[10:46] cry out like a little
[10:48] baby might not always sound the best
[10:51] right but when you're in a moment of
[10:52] desperation cry out to God God loves to
[10:54] hear you cry out to him
[10:56] Hallelujah now Luke 24:15 they now as
[10:59] they're walking it comes to pass while
[11:01] they commune together now commune just
[11:04] means to
[11:05] talk in the Greek now reason though
[11:08] they're communing and reasoning the word
[11:10] reason in the Greek is different it's
[11:12] investigate and question things so
[11:15] they're playing every uh scenario in
[11:18] their minds and well you saw this I saw
[11:21] that and then I heard this I heard that
[11:23] I heard Jesus say that and remember when
[11:25] he said that and they're just going
[11:26] through every scenario trying to
[11:29] understand what had actually happened
[11:31] over this uh we'd say Monumental weekend
[11:35] Hallelujah and so they spend uh a
[11:38] certain amount of time here walking
[11:40] before Jesus steps out and in verse 15 I
[11:43] love it the Bible says while they
[11:45] commune and so see Church even in the
[11:47] midst of your questions and even in the
[11:50] midst of you're trying to figure out
[11:51] your life even in the midst of being sad
[11:54] and maybe disappointed with your walk
[11:56] with God even in the midst of that even
[11:59] while you're you're you're struggling
[12:01] that's when Jesus comes to you he
[12:04] doesn't leave you alone in your
[12:05] questions he comes to answer your
[12:07] questions Hallelujah see I'm preaching
[12:09] to you right see I'm just telling you
[12:10] what he does that's what he does
[12:12] hallelujah I'm not telling you how he
[12:13] does it I'm just telling you he does it
[12:15] Hallelujah he comes to you when you're
[12:17] discouraged when you're talking and and
[12:20] you're not talking in faith like you you
[12:22] should right I'm saying we we are guilty
[12:25] of this come on where's your faith
[12:26] brother sister where's your faith see
[12:29] we're not always made to live on the
[12:31] mountain all the time that and church
[12:33] I'll tell you it'll help you appreciate
[12:34] the mountain tops
[12:36] more you'll enjoy when you go through a
[12:38] few valleys go through a through a few
[12:40] struggles questioning your faith
[12:42] wondering can you go on wondering how
[12:44] this is going to work out how could God
[12:45] be in this and you'll see then God will
[12:47] step out right into your very life
[12:50] Hallelujah glory to God Amen when you
[12:52] think he's furthest away and wondering
[12:54] and sad and discouraged that's when
[12:56] he'll show up in a powerful way
[12:57] Hallelujah that's that's right
[13:00] Hallelujah sometimes when you least
[13:02] expect it that's when he'll show
[13:04] up and of course this was least expected
[13:07] Jesus had
[13:08] died right and they all all they know is
[13:11] that they're leaving Jerusalem for
[13:12] whatever reason we don't even know why
[13:15] uh but they've left and then in verse 15
[13:17] Jesus steps out I love this Jesus
[13:19] himself draws here that's how it is for
[13:21] you Jesus himself he sends the Holy
[13:24] Spirit to you
[13:25] hallelujah oh what a blessing amen he
[13:27] don't send a second Spirit or third
[13:29] third Spirit he sends the Holy Spirit to
[13:31] you
[13:32] Hallelujah verse 16 but their eyes were
[13:34] Holden that they should not know now why
[13:36] were their eyes holding because God
[13:38] didn't want them to
[13:40] know God wanted to give them an
[13:42] experience with the spirit of burning
[13:44] Hallelujah because they're in a sad
[13:47] they're in a defeated
[13:49] condition they're questioning everything
[13:51] oh did I was it my fault was it your
[13:54] fault well why didn't you stand up why
[13:55] didn't my son stand up why why did my
[13:57] son it was only John so even yes so even
[13:59] now James the Lesser James the Lesser
[14:01] wasn't at the cross either and he could
[14:03] have been beating up himself up oh my
[14:04] son was such a coward he could have been
[14:06] what kind of father am I you know I'm
[14:08] just kind of breaking into this you know
[14:09] just some of the Dynamics of this story
[14:13] didn't I raise my son the right way and
[14:15] how did this happen we believed him to
[14:16] be the Resto we're going to get to get
[14:18] to it in a little bit we believed he was
[14:19] going to restore Israel and now he's
[14:22] dead I'll just say there's a lot of sad
[14:24] talk going on Church don't give up on
[14:27] God during the sad times
[14:30] just keep talking about
[14:32] him because that's what they did they
[14:35] didn't let the sadness make them stop
[14:37] talking about Jesus uh or get you know
[14:40] or or just just say get I'm done with it
[14:42] I'm never going to talk about it again
[14:43] I'm leaving this thing no they just kept
[14:45] talking about Jesus and that's when
[14:47] Jesus came to
[14:49] them verse
[14:52] 17 so see church it's okay to
[14:54] investigate things in your mind try to
[14:56] question things figure things out it's
[14:57] okay God knows we're just human
[14:59] and God's purposely withholding from you
[15:02] to help I say like this adjust your
[15:04] character or form your character to be
[15:06] more
[15:07] Christlike to trust him like I'm telling
[15:09] that brother who's getting sued this is
[15:11] all so that you will trust him
[15:14] more right because none of us want to go
[15:17] through that none of us would volunteer
[15:18] for that but God's allowed it and
[15:21] everything works together for his good
[15:23] Hallelujah and so this is a moment here
[15:25] to learn to trust in God to watch God to
[15:28] wait on God how many times did Israel
[15:29] have to wait on God till God finally
[15:31] came upon the scene Hallelujah and so we
[15:34] must learn the same thing wait on God
[15:36] right and then as we wait our strength
[15:38] is renewed Hallelujah that's what the
[15:40] Bible said in the book of
[15:42] Isaiah I love I love this how Jesus
[15:44] talks here verse 17 and he said to them
[15:46] what manner of communications are these
[15:48] that ye have one to another as ye walk
[15:51] and are sad so they're sad walking it's
[15:53] not fast-paced walking it's sad walking
[15:56] for seven
[15:57] miles why you walking so sad sometimes
[16:00] my wife will notice if I'm discouraged
[16:02] or something I drive real slow on the
[16:03] road she's like why don't you speed up a
[16:04] little bit you're you know she says real
[16:06] nice right are you thinking deep about
[16:08] something oh yeah yeah let me break out
[16:10] of this let me get back to driving 55
[16:11] again I'm driving like 45 down the
[16:14] highway I'm how's this going to work
[16:16] out and I love how Jesus comes out Jesus
[16:19] knows what they're thinking about Jesus
[16:22] knows what you're thinking about
[16:23] Hallelujah is that right he knows but
[16:27] then he wants the fellowship and I say
[16:29] like this he wants to hear our testimony
[16:31] he wants to hear us uh display our faith
[16:35] Hallelujah so he gives them a chance to
[16:37] share with him how they feel that's what
[16:39] prayer is all about it's just your
[16:41] chance to tell God how you feel about
[16:44] things like brother R said talk to God
[16:46] just like he's your friend if you could
[16:48] talk to somebody and just tell them what
[16:49] how things are going and you could
[16:50] really just sit down and have a cup of
[16:51] coffee or whatever just just quiet
[16:53] everything down what would you say to
[16:55] that best friend of yours or that Mentor
[16:57] that's how you talk to God
[16:59] just so simply because he's a he's a
[17:01] friend he's a he's a father he's a he's
[17:04] a savior Hallelujah he's our Lord our
[17:07] our ruler our husband all these titles
[17:08] that we give him hallelujah we're going
[17:10] to married land we're going to BU the
[17:12] land hallelujah we're going to the land
[17:14] of the married which is us we're married
[17:16] to
[17:18] Christ Glory Verse 18 and one of them
[17:22] whose name was Copus answered said unto
[17:24] him art thou only a stranger in
[17:26] Jerusalem and Hast not known the things
[17:29] which are come to pass there in these
[17:31] days so I like it he's asked a question
[17:33] and then he answers with the question
[17:34] don't you know what's been going on so
[17:36] obviously this whole event of Jesus
[17:38] crucifixion had been noised abroad just
[17:41] like the day of Pentecost right it been
[17:42] noised abroad uh the the man who was
[17:45] this young Prophet was thought to be a
[17:47] messiah had been crucified and it was a
[17:50] surprise right it was it was a shock it
[17:52] was a surprise they weren't expecting
[17:53] that Jesus had kept numerous feasts
[17:56] right even when he was 12 he went up to
[17:58] the Feast of Pentecost he all the Jews
[18:00] kept the feast but this was so
[18:02] unexpected uh within one week remember
[18:04] uh the uh from from the Palm Sunday when
[18:08] they're praising him as as son of David
[18:10] as they're as they're praising him
[18:12] Hosanna save us they're saying save us
[18:14] save us little did they know he'd save
[18:16] them by shedding his blood
[18:18] Hallelujah they wanted Jesus to save
[18:20] them from the Roman government but Jesus
[18:22] said I'm going to save you some from
[18:23] something better than that I'm going to
[18:25] save you from all your wretched sins
[18:27] Hallelujah that's right
[18:29] right so one week ago they're saying
[18:31] save us save us from from Rome and a
[18:35] week later now he's arrested beaten
[18:38] Scourge and he dies and sheds his blood
[18:41] in the most uh despicable human death of
[18:43] all time no one has ever been beaten
[18:45] like that no one ever could be beaten
[18:46] like that the Bible said he was less
[18:48] didn't he look like a man remember his
[18:50] tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth
[18:52] couldn't get any uh perspiration even in
[18:54] his mouth he said I'm he said I'm less
[18:56] than a man I'm like a worm aluah that's
[19:00] how much he died for us aren't you glad
[19:01] he died for us hallelujah my
[19:04] goodness and so Copus asked the Lord
[19:07] Jesus aren't you aware of these things
[19:09] and then in verse 19 and then he said to
[19:11] them Jesus says what things he knows
[19:14] what the things are but he lets them
[19:17] testify God wants to hear you testify
[19:20] God wants to hear your voice and the
[19:21] church
[19:23] said God wants you to tell him what's on
[19:25] your heart what why are you so sad what
[19:28] are the hard things in life God wants
[19:30] you to tell him about it in prayer
[19:32] hallelujah or it could be in Fellowship
[19:33] too right this don't have to be prayer
[19:35] this can be Fellowship right how many
[19:37] know when you have a good Fellowship you
[19:38] feel like the spirit of God comes right
[19:40] there maybe you start crying or maybe
[19:41] you start praising God or maybe you just
[19:43] feel the sacredness that you don't Fe
[19:45] all the time that's what happened to
[19:46] them they're talking about all the
[19:48] events questioning but they're sad
[19:50] they're wondering how could this happen
[19:52] Jesus comes along
[19:53] Hallelujah he says what things verse 19
[19:57] they said unto him concerning Jesus J of
[19:59] Nazareth which was a prophet now here it
[20:01] is I like I like their testimony he was
[20:03] a prophet Mighty in deed and word before
[20:07] God and all the people church let me
[20:09] tell you he said the right thing
[20:10] Hallelujah that's what you want to do
[20:12] you want to say the right thing
[20:14] Hallelujah he didn't say well he's a
[20:16] weak Prophet you know he's weak because
[20:18] he got crucified no no no they they
[20:20] recognize the spirit of God was on him
[20:22] Hallelujah the Bible said how God
[20:24] anointed Jesus Christ uh to heal them
[20:27] all that were sick he know anointed him
[20:29] with the Holy Ghost in John 10:38
[20:30] Hallelujah and he did good going about
[20:33] healing all that were sick and Afflicted
[20:35] Hallelujah and this is the what they
[20:37] remember of the Lord Jesus his mighty
[20:40] power and his mighty words Hallelujah
[20:42] that's what we know about Jesus he's
[20:44] Mighty EMP power Mighty in words
[20:46] hallelujah oh that's right glory to God
[20:50] Amen and he did it before God and all
[20:53] the people in other words he did it
[20:54] before the invisible Spirit uh father
[20:57] and he does it before all the people
[20:58] people verse
[21:01] 20 and how the chief priests and the
[21:04] other rulers delivered him to be
[21:05] condemned to death and have crucified
[21:07] him so we know he is mighty but then he
[21:09] was condemned and crucified verse
[21:11] 21 now I like this right here again we
[21:14] Jesus allows them to express their faith
[21:17] what did they believe about Jesus he was
[21:19] mighty in word mighty in deed and they
[21:21] trusted him in verse 21 they were
[21:23] trusting that it would been he which
[21:26] should have redeemed Israel and beside
[21:28] all this today is the third day since
[21:30] these things were done now look they got
[21:33] a good testimony Jesus is powerful Jesus
[21:36] has powerful words powerful Miracles how
[21:39] many know he's a miracle working God
[21:40] hallelujah amen put your situation in
[21:43] his hands one time and watch God move on
[21:45] the scene Hallelujah that's right amen
[21:49] and what does he say they said he's
[21:50] Mighty and we trusted him to redeem
[21:53] Israel now church I'm going to break
[21:55] into this later but they were trusting
[21:57] for the Millennium but it was 2,000
[21:59] years or more off in the
[22:02] future they thought oh here's the
[22:03] Messiah it's in other words it's
[22:05] Millennial
[22:06] time but see they were blinded the Jews
[22:09] were blinded to the age of the
[22:11] Gentiles Hallelujah so that's what's
[22:14] happening here they think it's
[22:16] Millennium time well I remember I
[22:17] remember when I preached on the
[22:18] Millennium last last summer it was such

[22:49] it's given to you by God it's your
[22:51] inheritance hallelujah what a time and
[22:54] this is what they're thinking of course
[22:56] they're seeing the Miracles well no
[22:57] doubt the millenniums coming in no doubt
[22:59] Jerusalem is going to be the uh the
[23:01] center of all worship and every nation
[23:02] is going to flow in here that's what
[23:04] they're thinking Millennium time but God
[23:06] thinking bride time I'm gonna get a
[23:09] bride through seven Church ages I'm
[23:11] gonna get a gentile bride because this
[23:13] Jewish bride is goingon to turn away and
[23:15] reject me so I've got to go to the
[23:17] people that had no laws I've got to give
[23:19] them laws I've got to go people that
[23:21] have no promises and he had to come to
[23:23] you and I to give us promises

[23:30] nigh unto Christ hallelujah amen man

[23:41] Hallelujah and to experience the the
[23:43] plan of God the word of God uh the
[23:46] kingdom of God in the spiritual sense
[23:48] first
[23:52] Hallelujah yeah they're waiting for
[23:54] Jesus to redeem Israel but in the
[23:55] political way not the not the religious
[23:58] way by sins forgiveness of sins
[24:02] Hallelujah that's right now how many
[24:04] trusting in Jesus to redeem the
[24:07] bride that's where we are today
[24:09] Hallelujah that's where we're at today
[24:11] we're trusting in Jesus to redeem the
[24:12] bride to help her escape the tribulation
[24:16] and to meet Christ in the air that's
[24:19] what we're trusting in Christ for today
[24:21] Hallelujah and that's what brother said

[24:41] squeeze that'll bring the church
[24:43] together he said for the
[24:45] Rapture Hallelujah now our life is not
[24:48] sluggish but sometimes it feels like a
[24:49] sluggish we're not like slugs but
[24:52] sometimes it feel life is going slower
[24:53] why we go through this season why we go
[24:55] through that season you know i' I've
[24:56] been watching different revivals around

[25:26] Faith he wants he wants us to have real
[25:28] real Faith no matter what we see or what

[25:32] by sight he wants us to walk by faith
[25:34] Hallelujah walk by what is unseen
[25:37] Hallelujah not by what is
[25:39] seen we go through the seasons of Life
[25:42] verse 22 yay in certain women also of
[25:44] our company made us astonished which
[25:46] were early at the supper so they
[25:48] astonished us yet they're still sad
[25:51] because they hadn't seen Jesus so see
[25:53] look your testimony can only do so much
[25:56] for somebody but you should still always
[25:58] give your testimony
[26:01] right see there the women said he's
[26:04] alive I seen him right a Mary Magdalene
[26:07] I saw him but still it couldn't lift
[26:10] those men too high those big old Burly
[26:13] Men full of Faith couldn't believe a
[26:15] little woman shame up he Jesus calls
[26:17] them fools later they're fools they
[26:20] should have believed the
[26:21] sisters right now we don't get too many
[26:24] amens on that right because our sisters
[26:25] don't want to feel like they're against
[26:26] the brothers yeah yeah yeah amen amen
[26:29] praise you
[26:30] brother no it's just humbling for us
[26:32] because we all know that uh no matter
[26:34] what situation we would have been in we
[26:36] would have probably failed and we would
[26:37] have fell short too praise God because
[26:38] we see our daily shortcomings in our
[26:40] lives every day I need a help from the
[26:43] Lord to overcome every day I need to
[26:46] stir myself up and don't be foolish be
[26:47] wise today Hallelujah renew your mind
[26:50] think about the right things do the
[26:52] right things be faithful focus on God
[26:54] hallelujah
[26:58] verse 23 and when they found not his
[27:00] body they came saying that the that they
[27:03] had also seen a vision of angels which
[27:06] is said he was alive well this brother
[27:09] said he had a dream right this sister
[27:11] said she had a dream and well that
[27:12] brother had a vision and sister says she
[27:14] has a vision but I haven't had it and
[27:17] see Church there's nothing wrong with
[27:19] that if you're elect God will help you
[27:21] believe God's going to come to you to
[27:23] help you believe all that the father has
[27:26] given me will come to me
[27:28] Hallelujah the great Shepherd he leaves
[27:31] the 99 and he goes to get the one that's
[27:33] lost
[27:35] Hallelujah Glory if you're a child of
[27:37] God God's going to come find you he's
[27:39] going to speak to you he's going to
[27:41] prove that he's God to you
[27:43] Hallelujah because he did it for
[27:46] them that's right see Church sometime in
[27:49] your life Jesus is going to show you
[27:50] that he's the resurrected Christ you
[27:53] might have already had
[27:54] it our sister Naomi said she got the
[27:57] holy ghost at 13 what a tremendous
[27:58] testimony
[28:00] 13 knowing 13 that sets you up for a
[28:03] good life doesn't it sister as sooner
[28:06] the better get the Holy Ghost some of
[28:07] our little ones right claim they got the
[28:09] holy ghost at young age what a blessing
[28:12] the sooner the better Hallelujah but the
[28:15] point is everybody has to have a real
[28:17] experience where resurrection power is
[28:19] made known to you praise God and you're
[28:22] going to strive the rest of your life to
[28:24] live under that by the grace of God
[28:26] dying daily right like our brother even
[28:27] said Die daily like Paul on Sunday die
[28:30] every day live under the inspiration
[28:33] that he's alive he's resurrected he's
[28:35] real Hallelujah my life is in his hands
[28:38] he's here he cares for me he loves me he
[28:40] wants to fellowship with me
[28:43] Hallelujah GL well they had Visions
[28:46] they've had dreams Lord where's mine you
[28:48] just wait you just keep talking about
[28:50] Jesus Hallelujah keep fellowshipping
[28:53] about
[28:55] Jesus that's what they did they just
[28:58] went about whether they're leaving
[28:59] Jerusalem I don't know what happened
[29:00] here you know I if I'm not mistaken
[29:03] they're still under I think the Feast of
[29:04] unleavened bread was seven days if I'm
[29:06] not mistaken I have to look it up but
[29:07] they were still under the feast so they
[29:08] were leaving Jerusalem in the time of
[29:10] the feast so that gives us some more
[29:12] clues I have to go search that out but
[29:14] that kind of struck me now I thought
[29:16] they kept unleavened bread for seven
[29:17] days brother
[29:20] Chris I don't know that's why I'd have
[29:22] to look it up um now three times a year
[29:24] all the men had to come to the feast
[29:28] okay um that was uh I'm not if I'm not
[29:31] mistaken it was the uh Passover and then
[29:35] weeks uh and then Tabernacles so it was
[29:39] like it was like uh say March or April
[29:42] and then May and then October so for our
[29:46] for our way of thinking three times a
[29:48] year they had to
[29:49] come so I don't know how long they
[29:51] stayed though I don't know how long they
[29:52] had to stay they had to come and give
[29:53] sacrifices and pay their ties and
[29:55] everything like that um so that that' be
[29:57] a good that'd be a good study we can go
[29:59] look on that more by God's grace great
[30:01] question
[30:02] brother now look the the women had seen
[30:05] him they they said they saw Visions they
[30:07] had all these experiences but they
[30:09] hadn't had an experience with God
[30:11] yet verse 24 and certain of them which
[30:14] were with us went to the supplier and
[30:16] found it even so as the women had said
[30:20] but him they saw not okay so here's
[30:23] here's what they're sharing with Jesus
[30:24] we trusted him he's a mighty man of God
[30:27] power and word
[30:29] but then he was crucified and the women
[30:30] came but uh in other words they're just
[30:34] women right they're just
[30:37] women now look at verse 25 look at the
[30:39] words of our savior sometimes we think
[30:42] Jesus is so tender and sweet and he
[30:45] is but he also has a direct side too
[30:49] he's we I we like to call him gentle
[30:52] Jesus and maybe he said this very gently
[30:55] but look what our savior calls people
[30:58] who are discouraged sad and can't they
[31:00] can't even see they can't even believe
[31:02] other people's testimonies about him
[31:05] look what Jesus would call them now how
[31:07] would you feel if Jesus called you some
[31:09] of these
[31:10] words oh that's right he does yes he
[31:13] does remember the Holy Spirit told
[31:15] Brother B take your lying hands off that
[31:18] baby when when he had lied to the IRS
[31:20] and he tried to pray for the child the
[31:21] holy spirit said go make it right see
[31:24] God don't God doesn't play with
[31:26] sin is that right
[31:30] and here so if Jesus calls them this
[31:32] then it should have been enough for them
[31:34] to
[31:35] believe right because think about it
[31:37] church we believe yet none of us have
[31:38] seen Jesus I mean talking I'm talking
[31:41] about the resurrected body and then
[31:43] Jesus said blessed are you who haven't
[31:46] seen but still believe Hallelujah he
[31:49] said you're more blessed if you believe
[31:51] without sing
[31:53] Hallelujah Hallelujah I told you this
[31:56] before but I've had two people in the
[31:57] message mess uh one of them is from Al
[32:00] in Pennsylvania come up to me and say
[32:01] brother Jesse uh he said you're more
[32:03] blessed than I am I can always use you
[32:05] but thanks
[32:06] man you can get me back later at
[32:08] sparring
[32:09] okay but he said say brother Jack from
[32:12] Pennsylvania he says brother Jesse

[32:16] brother no you got to be in brother

[32:37] preacher they love to do that brother
[32:40] Austin sister Lena they love to preach
[32:42] to the preacher I get a lot when I go
[32:44] other places they want to start
[32:45] preaching at me after I preach to them
[32:46] for four
[32:48] hours he says no I'm gonna I'm gonna
[32:50] tell you the scripture brother
[32:52] Jessie he takes me to John where Jesus
[32:55] says those exact words he said more
[32:57] blessed are the those who believe yet
[32:59] haven't seen and also I could say was
[33:01] yeah you're right brother Jack you're
[33:03] right he's like see I told you they
[33:06] always want to tell
[33:07] preachers because we don't know it all
[33:09] church but God knows it all Hallelujah
[33:12] but that is the truth you're more
[33:14] blessed to believe if you haven't had
[33:16] some Supernatural
[33:18] experience but God knows we need them
[33:21] sometimes you got to have one experience
[33:24] you got to have a Salvation at least and
[33:26] then at least that SP of judgment Spirit
[33:28] of burning and the baptism of the Holy
[33:30] Ghost that that's what you want you want
[33:31] at least three by God's grace Hallelujah
[33:35] remember even history even history says
[33:37] that Martin Luther had one powerful
[33:39] experience of
[33:40] justification and then Wesley was like
[33:43] we got a new they actually called it a
[33:44] new experience it's sanctification of
[33:47] heart and life and they were preaching
[33:48] like man you can go farther with God you
[33:51] can you you can actually get you can
[33:52] overcome your cigarettes or cigars like
[33:54] Martin Luther you can actually overcome
[33:56] they're like Glory it's
[33:58] Revival it was another experience with
[34:00] God and then zeusa Street came and that
[34:02] was uh speaking in tongues and the gifts
[34:05] but then they like oh no don't marry the
[34:06] the rapture's coming too soon see they
[34:08] got off on these little
[34:09] things but now the Holy Ghost is here
[34:12] and said you can be justified Sanctified
[34:14] you can have the gifts and you can have
[34:16] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can
[34:18] live all the word of God
[34:20] hallelujah what a blessing praise God
[34:23] and they were saying tongues of the
[34:24] heavens tongues of the heavens and we've
[34:25] seen people I've seen people my whole
[34:27] life in personate tongues tongues are
[34:29] not the evidence Hallelujah may God just
[34:31] give us a tongue to praise the Lord
[34:33] hallelujah just give me I say just give
[34:35] me a tongue of men to praise the Lord I
[34:37] don't have to have the tongue of angels
[34:39] although it'd be nice to speak in the
[34:40] tongue of angels but I just want to have
[34:41] a tongue that will give God praise
[34:44] Hallelujah
[34:46] Glory I'm not feeling so tired
[34:49] anymore that's usually what happens then
[34:52] my wife says like you're getting up in
[34:53] Heavenly places I'm like yeah I know
[34:54] that it's hard to come down once I'm in
[34:55] Heavenly places so look how Jesus talks
[34:58] to his
[35:01] beloved and then he said to them they
[35:04] look they've just poured out their
[35:05] hearts and it's in a sad way like oh you
[35:07] know the the women told us and we we
[35:11] didn't know what to believe and Jesus
[35:13] says oh
[35:14] fools that's a nice dinner that's a nice
[35:17] Walkin conversation right there right oh
[35:19] fools and slow of heart you're slow to
[35:26] believe all that the prophets have
[35:28] spoken so see they were only looking at
[35:31] those prophets like Isaiah 2 and Isaiah
[35:33] 11 about the Millennium they're only
[35:34] looking at those certain verses in there
[35:37] they're missing all the other
[35:39] ones church that's how we are we
[35:41] sometimes we only focus on so many
[35:43] scriptures how many know there's a lot
[35:44] of Bible verses there's over 100,000
[35:47] Bible verses last time I looked a
[35:49] 100,000 some and so they're only
[35:51] focusing on a few there about the
[35:52] Millennium and oh the messiah's going to
[35:54] come restore Israel but that was over
[35:57] 2,000 years in the future and Jesus said
[36:00] oh fools you're slow of heart why does
[36:03] it take you so long to believe God's
[36:05] word and I'm preaching up myself tonight
[36:09] brother Jesse why does it take you so
[36:11] long to believe God's word because I'm
[36:13] just like these guys I'm a man just like
[36:16] Copus I'm a Daddy just like
[36:19] Copus
[36:21] right see Church you know
[36:23] honestly you know I mean you and I
[36:26] having faith for the rapture what kind
[36:28] of faith is that going to have to be to
[36:29] literally change our bodies now it's
[36:32] given by God right but right we have to
[36:34] have rapturing faith it's going to be
[36:36] anointing and if you had that Faith
[36:39] you'd be raptured right now you you why
[36:40] would you wait till tomorrow you'd be
[36:41] raptured right now if you had that Faith
[36:43] but we don't have that faith yet and so
[36:45] it's hard to imagine my what kind of
[36:47] faith is that going to have to have when
[36:48] there's going to be rumors about the
[36:50] government uh being able to persecute
[36:52] Christians and everything what kind of
[36:54] faith is that going to have to have it's
[36:55] going to be an amazing anointing
[36:58] and while now it may seem hard to
[37:00] understand or hard to to kind of feel
[37:02] that like brother R said it'll be ready
[37:04] when you get there it'll be waiting for
[37:07] you that latter rain will be there for
[37:09] you praise God because you want it
[37:12] because there's a deep call there's got
[37:13] to be a deep to respond praise God glory
[37:16] if you want to be ready for the Rapture
[37:18] there'll be a lad rain ready for you
[37:20] when the Rapture comes hallelujah how
[37:23] many want to be
[37:24] ready it'll be there
[37:28] just like uh you know when the when the
[37:30] sisters bring forth children the
[37:31] strength is there to bring forth the
[37:33] child it's there hallelujah it's going
[37:36] to be there it's provided at just the
[37:38] right time and
[37:39] season right or you going to manhood or
[37:42] whatever you do get go into marriage
[37:44] wherever you do the the grace that is
[37:45] needed it'll be given to you when you
[37:47] get
[37:49] there
[37:51] Hallelujah so Jesus said oh
[37:54] fools now in One Way Church he's right
[37:56] because they don't have the Holy Ghost
[37:57] yet they're foolish
[37:59] virgins oh fools and slow of heart to
[38:02] believe all that the prophets have
[38:04] spoken Jesus rebukes them for not
[38:06] believing the women right he does it
[38:08] later as well he does it when he gets
[38:09] there later on that evening when he
[38:11] comes to them all he rebukes them all he
[38:13] upgrades them for the hardness of their
[38:17] hearts and church sometimes we're just
[38:20] so slow to believe so so sometimes we
[38:23] just linger in unbelief like uncertainty
[38:26] is God going to help me can God do this
[38:28] is is God on my side is am I God's
[38:30] friend sometimes we linger so long in
[38:32] that and we got a sad attitude on top of
[38:35] that does that sound familiar to anybody
[38:38] I preached on a few weeks ago or yeah
[38:40] months self-pity sometimes we get into
[38:42] self-pity oh my life so hard why do I
[38:44] got to go through this why me why not
[38:47] you you got to go through something
[38:50] would you rather go through some other
[38:51] things I mean why not us we're the
[38:53] children of God God wants to see God
[38:55] wants to prove to the devil that we
[38:57] we've got real Faith
[38:58] Hallelujah so to go through the trials
[39:01] and just cling to the word just hold on
[39:04] as as much as you
[39:05] can but I like what brother man said do
[39:08] as much as you can and they said when
[39:09] you don't have anymore God will do the
[39:11] rest I love that quote I need to find
[39:13] that
[39:14] quote do all that you can for Jesus and
[39:16] then when you feel like you can do no
[39:18] more he'll take care of the rest
[39:22] Hallelujah now what does he take him to
[39:24] verse 26 ought not Christ to have
[39:26] suffered the things and to enter into
[39:29] his glory now Church here's the
[39:32] beautiful part of this this is what they
[39:34] missed about the Messiah they read all
[39:36] the verses about the Messiah reigning
[39:37] and bringing every nation into
[39:39] subjection but they missed the
[39:41] scriptures about the suffering
[39:44] servant the suffering Messiah they
[39:47] thought it was all glory all Dominion
[39:49] all power all tearing down strongholds
[39:51] and they missed the part about the
[39:53] Messiah having to suffer and die
[39:58] so what does Jesus do he says you're
[39:59] foolish you're slow to believe you
[40:01] haven't believed all the word of God
[40:03] you've missed this part about the
[40:05] Messiah
[40:06] suffering that's the part we don't like
[40:08] to think about either Church look at
[40:10] that I mean do we like to think about
[40:11] suffering in a persec or suffering in a
[40:13] squeeze does anybody like to think about
[40:14] that no same thing we're still human
[40:17] like they are right we're on the same
[40:19] level we're
[40:20] humans we battle things and we don't uh
[40:23] we don't often think outside to other
[40:25] scriptures we just think about the
[40:26] things we're currently going through but
[40:29] if we keep focusing on Christ if we keep
[40:31] talking about Jesus in the right time
[40:33] and season Jesus will speak what we need
[40:36] to
[40:37] hear and I love this at verse 27 and
[40:41] beginning at Moses and all the prophets
[40:42] so he starts in
[40:46] Genesis and all the prophets so Genesis
[40:49] Exodus Leviticus Numbers
[40:51] Deuteronomy Joshua Judges Ruth Samuel
[40:54] second Samuel Kings Kings Chronicles and
[40:56] Chronicles as Nehemiah Esther all the
[40:59] way down job and Psalms and Proverbs
[41:02] Ecclesiastes Song of Solomon Isaiah
[41:04] Jeremiah Lamentations Ezekiel Daniel
[41:06] Hosea Joel and Amos oadi Jonah Micah
[41:09] naham habac Zephaniah haii and Zachariah
[41:12] Malachi I think I quoted most of the Old
[41:14] Testament right there he Jesus starts at
[41:16] Genesis and he starts preaching look
[41:18] he's supposed to suffer look at the
[41:20] Messiah you missed it here it is here it
[41:22] is look what the Bible says here and
[41:24] church as they're walking they start
[41:25] realizing my oh now I see I missed it I
[41:28] didn't read that and now the words of
[41:31] the Bible are jumping out to them and
[41:33] now they can see what they missed God
[41:35] help us to see what we miss
[41:37] hallelujah
[41:39] amen the god of Heaven has to come down
[41:42] and preach an entire sermon of every
[41:45] prophet in the entire Old Testament to
[41:47] get these people to believe of what his
[41:49] true commission was to suffer and die
[41:52] for their
[41:53] sins but they wanted to skip ahead to
[41:55] the Millennium Brothers
[41:59] who needs the Gentiles oh those they'll
[42:00] all come up they'll be our slaves and
[42:02] God's like no I'm going to make them my
[42:03] bride H we were the Beggars but now
[42:06] we're
[42:07] royalty they look down on the Gentiles
[42:09] they're just a bunch of Gentiles yeah
[42:11] yeah they'll come up and worship but
[42:12] Jesus like no no I'm G actually make
[42:14] them my
[42:16] bride amen praise God they missed all
[42:20] that but we see
[42:22] it by the grace of God talk about a
[42:25] sermon I love that song uh the preacher
[42:27] of preachers began to preach on this
[42:30] walk
[42:32] Hallelujah this was the preacher brother
[42:34] Chris of all preachers nobody could
[42:36] preach like this
[42:38] man and he preaches while they're
[42:40] walking on a two and a half or three
[42:42] hour long walk he starts saying look at
[42:44] the scripture here and then Moses said
[42:46] this and look what Isaiah said and then
[42:48] all these hundred years later look what
[42:49] Ezekiel said and then look at Malachi
[42:51] Malachi said this look at all these
[42:53] things that have come to pass oh you
[42:55] talk about little uh a a little pep in
[42:58] their step I imagine by the end they're
[42:59] walking pretty feeling pretty good my
[43:01] Hallelujah I never seen it like this
[43:04] before oh now the Bible makes sense
[43:07] brother Chris I I missed I left out that
[43:10] whole entire part I didn't even realize
[43:13] that this is what God is doing in this
[43:16] hour oh God's getting a bride ready
[43:19] while the US raises up out the Beast out
[43:21] the land God's getting a bride ready
[43:24] Hallelujah that will meet Christ in the
[43:26] air that'll miss the Judgment of the
[43:28] tribulation she be raptured in a moment
[43:30] and Twink of an eye she shall not see
[43:33] death she shall not see wrath because
[43:35] she's the Bride of Jesus Christ amen oh
[43:38] my that's what God's doing now he's
[43:40] getting a bride
[43:42] ready to be snatched away to Heaven
[43:45] harpazo remember harpazo I always
[43:47] remember my harpazo sermon snatch away I
[43:50] looked at every time the Bible said
[43:53] harpazo that's what Jesus is doing right
[43:55] now getting a br ready to be snatched
[43:58] away from this Earth not to trust in
[44:00] Donald Trump or JD Vance or Elon Musk
[44:04] but to trust in the Risen Lord Jesus
[44:07] Christ
[44:08] Hallelujah that's
[44:12] right talk about a preacher God Of
[44:15] Heaven comes out and preaches them every
[44:18] Prophet every verse about Jesus having
[44:20] to suffer verse
[44:24] 28 and they drew nigh unto the village
[44:27] wither they went so they finally come to
[44:29] Emmas after two and a half three
[44:32] hours and made as though he would have
[44:34] gone
[44:36] further now I love this part but I want
[44:39] to look back here
[44:40] uh this is a beautiful part of the the
[44:43] story now look Jesus he makes as though
[44:47] he's going to move on I love this Jesus
[44:50] acts like he's going to leave him Church
[44:52] isn't that something he acts like he's
[44:54] going to leave him in other words he's
[44:57] giving them a
[44:58] test he's saying do you want me to stay
[45:01] or are you okay with me
[45:03] leaving and how we know he gives us the
[45:05] same test in our lives he'll give us the
[45:07] same test do you want to keep enjoying
[45:10] the word do you want to hear more of the
[45:12] word do you want to keep that sweet
[45:13] spirit with us or are we okay with that
[45:15] spirit leaving
[45:17] us in other words G do we want to grieve
[45:19] the Holy Spirit or do you want to say
[45:21] Jesus stay with me tomorrow I want to
[45:23] feel this way tomorrow morning
[45:25] too I don't want to just feel this like
[45:27] on Sunday and Wednesday I'm going to
[45:29] feel it on Thursday morning and the
[45:30] church said that's usually the hardest
[45:32] morning of the week for me I don't know
[45:33] about you but tomorrow morning is
[45:35] usually the hardest
[45:37] morning so he kind of just plays like
[45:39] he's acting isn't that what brother R
[45:42] said isn't that what an actor does he
[45:43] just changes his
[45:44] mask God in morphe well now they don't
[45:47] even know it's Jesus right there're just
[45:48] he's some preacher that my he can preach
[45:50] the house
[45:51] down he preaches and I start feeling
[45:54] fire burn up in my heart I I go from sad
[45:58] to on fire Glory
[46:00] Hallelujah when this guy preaches man I
[46:03] I I'm discouraged and by the end I'm
[46:05] shouting the victory I'm ready to move
[46:06] on with God
[46:09] hallelujah and he's like all right see
[46:11] you guys later been a nice Fellowship
[46:13] thanks for having me
[46:16] fools I don't mind walking with foolish
[46:18] people all right have a good night
[46:22] fools and he acts like okay I'll see you
[46:24] later and what does verse 29 show so
[46:27] this is the test of the believer verse
[46:28] 29 but they constrained him in other
[46:31] words They begged him oh oh sir sir
[46:33] please please please please stay with us
[46:36] this is so wonderful I've never heard
[46:38] preaching like this I got to have some
[46:40] more of this I love when we first come
[46:42] in the message that's how we felt we're
[46:44] willing to drive three hours across the
[46:46] state just for one Bible
[46:48] study oh you know why because our hearts
[46:50] were burning Hallelujah God was opening
[46:53] the scriptures to us hallelujah it's not
[46:56] hard to do that it's not hard to drive
[46:57] uh three hours one way to church when
[46:59] your heart's burning with the fire of
[47:01] God
[47:02] hallelujah like every week was like a
[47:04] brand new sermon a brand new masterpiece
[47:07] on a new topic we never heard before oh
[47:09] I didn't know that about the Seven Seals
[47:11] I didn't know that about rapturing faith
[47:13] I didn't know that about the latter rain
[47:15] it's just it's a it's a fresh Revelation
[47:17] it's just continually unfolding all the
[47:19] time but God's testing them do you want
[47:21] more of this or do you want to go back
[47:23] to your sad life that's what he wants to
[47:25] know tonight do you want more of God's
[47:27] revelation more of revealing of the word
[47:29] or do you want to go back to your
[47:31] sadness and your defeat how many you
[47:33] want to go on with God
[47:35] hallelujah so brother says you better
[47:37] beg Jesus to stay in your life now I
[47:39] preached this one time I love this story
[47:41] I don't tell it much but I was preaching
[47:43] in albian one time and a mother a young
[47:45] mother had children I remember she's
[47:46] watching me during the whole service
[47:47] sometimes there's some somebody's under
[47:49] the spirit they're just watching me the
[47:50] whole time I'm like okay God's going to
[47:51] do something with that person you know I
[47:52] know something's going to happen at in
[47:53] the service it's like when that woman
[47:54] got healed with the kidney cancer or not
[47:56] kidney kidney Stone not kidney cancer
[47:58] kidney stone and when sister Marie got
[47:59] healed of the bleeding uh the blood
[48:01] issue just watching me that the whole
[48:03] time like this person's pulling so much
[48:05] on the word of God well anyways in
[48:06] Pennsylvania and I ended the sermon with
[48:10] this and I said I was just I was reading
[48:13] a quote where brother R said I I don't
[48:14] have the quote tonight but brother R
[48:16] said you got to beg Jesus to stay with
[48:19] you in your life you don't want to him
[48:21] to leave you you don't want him to to
[48:23] forsake not forsake but you you don't
[48:25] want to uh to lose his anointing and I
[48:28] just preached it you got to beg Jesus if
[48:30] you want Jesus in your life you got to
[48:32] plead with him to stay with you you got
[48:35] to be tired of having him out of your
[48:37] life you got to beg him and pray and
[48:39] plead to stay in your life it's a
[48:43] test Hallelujah and I saw that woman
[48:46] give her husband the baby I'm not going
[48:47] to say her name she got a pretty good
[48:49] name that's that's the clue I'll give
[48:51] pretty good first name I know that she
[48:54] handed the baby to her husband come up
[48:56] here we put pray for her and she laid at
[48:57] the altar she screamed and cried and
[48:59] after service she come up her face was
[49:01] all red and swollen there's tears all
[49:03] over her face now I'm probably
[49:04] dramatizing as I always do
[49:07] exaggerating but she's like brother
[49:09] Jesse I needed that I had feeling so far
[49:11] from God all the cares of my children
[49:14] all the cares of my husband the jobs and
[49:16] we're talking about moving and where's
[49:18] the income going to come from and all
[49:19] these the children crying screaming she
[49:21] said I felt so far from God she said but
[49:23] when you preach that that's exactly what
[49:25] I heard brother brandom say the same
[49:27] thing and I need to cry out to God and
[49:29] she said now I'm back with God
[49:32] hallelujah she met Jesus at the altar
[49:35] Hallelujah and she said I don't want to
[49:36] go on in this motherhood or this I don't
[49:39] want to go on as this wife that doesn't
[49:41] have the anointing of God on me let me
[49:43] have his anointing
[49:44] Hallelujah let me have Jesus how many
[49:46] Want
[49:50] Jesus
[49:52] wow so in other words brother bam said
[49:54] you must constrain Jesus to stay with
[49:57] you don't get distracted in other things
[49:59] keep Jesus on your heart and
[50:03] mind and church this just wasn't one
[50:05] time you think oh this just one time
[50:07] Jesus did this multiple times he would
[50:10] act like he's leaving just to see if
[50:12] they wanted to stay and brother R said
[50:15] we we shouldn't get to a spot where
[50:16] where where we stop clapping brother
[50:18] said Jesus loves clapping other you
[50:21] start clapping and praising God brother
[50:23] it's like inviting Jesus back into your
[50:25] life
[50:27] he wants to see if you really want to
[50:28] worship God you want to worship God and
[50:30] praise God well then act like it amen
[50:33] ask him to be in your service anoint me
[50:35] while we sing anoint me while we pray
[50:37] Lord I want you here I don't want to see
[50:39] you go I don't want cold Services I want
[50:41] the spirit of God to flow in my life
[50:43] Hallelujah that's what I'm saying you
[50:46] got to say Amen you got to read your
[50:47] Bible you got to pray got to try to
[50:49] witness you got to try to worship try to
[50:51] get out of your old like our just human
[50:53] uh common stiff starchy condition and we
[50:56] got to inv invite Jesus back in our
[50:58] lives
[50:59] Hallelujah that's right church that is
[51:01] right it's not easy for me to preach
[51:04] like this I'm tired I'm trying to keep
[51:05] Jesus in my life right you know how easy
[51:08] it could be so many times I'm so tired I
[51:10] could just stand here and preach and
[51:11] just not raise my voice I've been
[51:14] tempted many times to do that but I
[51:17] can't do that I can't let myself get
[51:19] cold I got to let Jesus into my life
[51:22] into my gift does that make sense
[51:27] you've all I've seen message preachers
[51:28] stand like this and read quotes brother
[51:31] said this brother said that said this
[51:35] Bible says this Bible says that and by
[51:37] the end you're like okay is this guy
[51:38] even
[51:40] alive or is that an AI generated image
[51:42] there something like
[51:44] that see I I could do that now there's
[51:47] nothing wrong if that's your
[51:50] anointing but we want to give all that
[51:53] we have have we done what we could do
[51:56] that's the question that was preached to
[51:58] us in other words I got to give myself
[52:00] over to the thoughts that God sends to
[52:02] me and preach with conviction right
[52:05] preach with passion with sincerity
[52:08] praise
[52:09] God he just didn't do this one time he
[52:13] did it another time Mark 6:48 and when
[52:15] he saw them toiling and roaring now look
[52:17] in both cases these disciples are in bad
[52:20] condition the first case they're sad
[52:22] discouraged and he calls them fools and
[52:25] he wants to see if they want to keep him
[52:27] around Church do we want to keep Jesus
[52:29] around that's the question or do you
[52:31] want to trud along through life in
[52:33] sadness in this case they're toiling
[52:36] Jesus lets them get in a toiling awful
[52:39] difficult part of life and then he comes
[52:42] around to see if they want to invite him
[52:44] into their situation and the church said
[52:46] glory to God glory to God Amen as we go
[52:49] through toils of life amen Jesus is
[52:51] going to come by his service and see if
[52:53] you'll invite him into your life
[52:54] Hallelujah
[52:56] invite him into your pain invite him
[52:58] into your questions invite him into your
[53:00] investigations or you're wondering
[53:01] invite him into your sadness that's why
[53:03] he's coming that's why he allowed it
[53:05] praise God so you invite him into your
[53:09] situation he just wants to see do you
[53:11] want him as a part of your life in this
[53:13] situation you know sometimes we say why
[53:15] did we go through this why do I got to
[53:17] go through this well it'd be different
[53:18] if you let Jesus into it you might feel
[53:20] different it might not be so hard and
[53:23] God helped me too I'm I'm preaching to
[53:25] myself tonight
[53:28] he saw them toiling and roaring uh God
[53:30] allowed that God allowed them to have
[53:32] that storm God allowed storms in your
[53:36] life for the wind was contrary to them
[53:38] oh everything finances were contrary the
[53:41] kids were contrary to them your job was
[53:43] contrary to you your friends were
[53:46] contrary to
[53:48] you and about the Fourth Watch of the
[53:51] night so let's see the Fourth Watch
[53:53] First Watch would have been uh six to n
[53:56] second watch 9 to
[53:58] midnight oh the Fourth Watch would have
[54:00] been 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. so from 3:00
[54:02] a.m. to 6:00 a.m. brother Chris has
[54:04] worked third shift recently so he knows
[54:06] what it feels like at 3 a.m. but they're
[54:08] toiling now they're not just driving's
[54:10] toiling too but this is real toiling so
[54:12] I appreciate a hardworking man on who
[54:14] work all night I appreciate a third
[54:15] shift person that's that's a tough life
[54:18] but these guys are toiling with
[54:21] ores about the fourth so it's about 3:00
[54:24] am so maybe it's 2:30 a.m.
[54:27] about 4:00 a.m. maybe it's 10:00 to
[54:29] 3: he comes unto them walks on the sea
[54:32] and he's acting like he's going to pass
[54:44] by and don't inv don't you want Jesus
[54:49] help you
[54:51] out do we want to carry this cross alone
[54:53] all by ourselves or do want Jesus to
[54:55] give us strength to do it
[54:57] God it's he acts like he's going to walk
[55:00] by oh yeah you guys enjoying that tough
[55:02] life okay go
[55:03] ahead I'll just I'll keep going if you
[55:05] want me
[55:07] to and he he's just testing them don't
[55:09] you want to don't you want to invite me
[55:11] in oh because you know what he's always
[55:14] doing he's always knocking at the hearts
[55:15] door the leot toan message right behold
[55:19] I stand in the door knock I just seen it
[55:22] there if any will open the door I'll
[55:25] come in and up with him and he with me
[55:29] Hallelujah I'm going to pay for this
[55:30] tomorrow I'm going to pay for it I can
[55:32] tell
[55:35] already glory to God I better I better
[55:37] close here
[55:39] hallelujah he's passing by and he's act
[55:43] like he's going to pass him he's acting
[55:45] like he don't care but he's actually
[55:46] testing do you care the fact he's
[55:49] passing by proves he
[55:51] cares but he wants to see do you
[55:54] care will you bring Jes Jesus into your
[55:58] toil or you just want him to keep
[56:00] walking by well uh just go ahead and
[56:02] pass me by sa we ought to sing pass me
[56:04] not oh gentle savior don't don't pass by
[56:07] Jesus Come into my
[56:09] toiling come into my sadness come into
[56:11] my questions about how is this how is
[56:13] this even scriptural H how how how does
[56:16] this work what what just happened this
[56:18] last
[56:19] weekend invite him into
[56:22] that and church don't you know what will
[56:24] he do if he ever comes you what will he
[56:25] do I point you to the word of God
[56:28] because that's what he did on the road
[56:29] to emus he started preaching him a
[56:33] sermon the god of Heaven amen preaches a
[56:36] scriptural
[56:37] sermon to try to encourage the
[56:40] sad and here he acts like he's going to
[56:43] pass by him on the boat when they saw
[56:45] him walking on the sea they supposed
[56:47] been a spirit and cried out for they all
[56:50] saw him and were troubled and
[56:51] immediately talked with them and say to
[56:52] them be of good cheer it is I be not
[56:55] afraid
[56:57] now there's a parallel passage in
[56:58] Matthew
[57:00] 14:25 and in the Fourth Watch of the
[57:02] night Jesus went unto them walking on
[57:05] the
[57:06] sea see so this proves the fact he comes
[57:09] by your toiling proves he's going out to
[57:12] you and it proves he wants you to invite
[57:14] him into your life that's the reason
[57:17] that's the reason he's out there that's
[57:19] the reason you feel the presence of God
[57:20] that's the reason you hear somebody
[57:21] preach about Jesus or you're here
[57:23] tonight the reason you're here is
[57:25] because he's coming to you you praise
[57:27] God and he wants to he wants you to
[57:30] invite him into your life and listen to
[57:32] his word what he has to say let's stand
[57:35] to our feet or else I'm never going to
[57:36] close here go I never got to my verse
[57:39] did
[57:41] I verse 32 I'm going to close with that
[57:44] one now they're already at the house and
[57:46] they said to one another did not our
[57:47] hearts burn within us while he talked to
[57:49] us by the way while he opened to us the
[57:54] scripture Hallelujah
[57:56] haven't been an hour yet I'm at 55
[57:58] minutes
[58:00] surprising but see here's the other kind
[58:02] of a
[58:03] burning now what did I call this Burning
[58:06] let me look at my notes what did the
[58:07] exact word so Isaiah had the burning to
[58:10] put you into service Jeremiah had the
[58:12] burning to keep you in service keep you
[58:15] from quitting Copus and his friend had
[58:19] the burning to revive their service in
[58:21] the season of doubt what's going on here
[58:25] what what I'm leaving
[58:28] Jerusalem what we thought this was going
[58:31] to happen we thought it was going to be
[58:32] a great restoration a great Redemption
[58:34] we thought this so here now the spirit
[58:36] of God comes to revive the fire in their
[58:41] souls how many know he wants to do that
[58:43] tonight if you feel your fires going
[58:46] down or you got questions or you're sad
[58:50] or you're uncertain or you're toiling
[58:51] and life is difficult he's here tonight
[58:54] Church he's the same yesterday he's the
[58:57] same yesterday today forever Hallelujah
[58:59] he's the same so if there's anyone here
[59:02] tonight who's under these type of
[59:04] situations he's here to revive you to
[59:07] keep you in the service of the Lord
[59:09] musicians can come let's bow our heads
[59:13] here Jesus cares when we're sad he cares
[59:16] that's why he came to them Jesus cares
[59:18] when we're
[59:19] confused Jesus cares when we're
[59:21] exhausted we're toiling and it feels
[59:24] like we're getting nowhere in life Jesus
[59:26] cares that's why he's here
[59:29] tonight
[59:32] Hallelujah Lord I love that scripture
[59:34] that I just read there
[59:36] Lord Jesus went unto
[59:39] them Lord it always goes back to your
[59:41] love it always goes back to your care
[59:44] for us Lord as we
[59:45] [Music]
[59:48] pray Lord in our own human Minds we can
[59:51] get so confused we can feel like such
[59:54] fools we can do food foolish things we
[59:57] can be
[59:58] cowards like some of those men felt like
[1:00:00] after the res after the
[1:00:04] crucifixion we can be so confused about
[1:00:07] Prophecy in the
[1:00:09] Bible and what God's doing in our
[1:00:12] lives we can be so worn
[1:00:16] out by the toils of
[1:00:20] life but Lord in those moments you come
