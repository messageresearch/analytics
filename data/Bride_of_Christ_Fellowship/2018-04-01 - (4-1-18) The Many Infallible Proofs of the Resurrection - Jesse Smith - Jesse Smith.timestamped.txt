[43:40] to Acts chapter one like to preach our
[43:44] Easter message this morning I'll take a
[43:46] break from the series we've been working
[43:47] on the wisdom series we'll take a little
[43:49] break from that and I just like to
[43:50] preach a Easter message this morning I
[43:52] like to preach on the infallible proofs
[43:55] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ I'd
[43:57] like to preach on that this morning by
[43:59] the grace of the Lord trust be a
[44:01] blessing to you
[44:02] Acts chapter one verse one this week
[44:08] I've been listening to the sermons the
[44:09] proof of his resurrection for brother
[44:11] Branham there's one in 1955 and one in
[44:13] 1957 and enjoying those this this week
[44:17] by the grace of Lord so that's kind of
[44:20] where I'm getting my thoughts from by
[44:22] God's grace Acts chapter 1 verse 1 now
[44:28] we know st. Luke wrote both acts and the
[44:30] Book of Luke so this is Luke speaking to
[44:33] us by the grace of the Lord and the
[44:36] former treatise is the Book of Luke
[44:38] that's what he's referring to as we
[44:40] begin this chapter here if you're there
[44:43] say Amen I'll read verses 1 and 2 and
[44:47] then we'll all read verse 3 the former
[44:52] treatise have I made aa Theophilus of
[44:54] all that Jesus began both to do and
[44:57] teach until the day in which he was
[44:59] taken up after that he through the Holy
[45:02] Ghost had given Commandments unto the
[45:05] Apostles whom he had chosen let's read
[45:08] verse three one two three
[45:10] for whom also he showed himself alive
[45:12] after his passion by many infallible
[45:16] proofs being seen of them forty days and
[45:19] speaking of the things pertaining to the
[45:22] kingdom of God and I'll read verse four
[45:24] and being assembled together with them
[45:26] commanded them that they should not
[45:27] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[45:30] promise of the Father which saith he you
[45:32] have heard of me for John truly baptized
[45:35] with water but ye shall be baptized with
[45:37] the Holy Ghost not many days hence
[45:40] don't you love those red letter words
[45:42] there I like when people look at me a
[45:44] little strange like what do you mean the
[45:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I can say
[45:47] Jesus Christ said that himself they
[45:50] think oh I know I know what it's like to
[45:52] be saved but Jesus Christ himself said
[45:55] there's a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[45:56] aren't you glad amen let's just bow our
[45:58] heads for a word of Prayer forever you
[45:59] know in your heart just make it unto God
[46:01] as we pray this morning
[46:02] Heavenly Father Lord we give you glory
[46:05] we know you live we're standing in your
[46:07] presence Lord we're standing in respect
[46:09] to the Heavenly Father that's the
[46:11] service Lord bless the reading of the
[46:12] word Lord it's your word Lord no man can
[46:15] no man can give the interpretation so we
[46:18] just ask that the Great Holy Spirit will
[46:19] come and speak through mortal lips and
[46:21] speak to hungry hearts Lord this morning
[46:23] we know Lord you're alive and we ask
[46:25] that you move upon every heart in this
[46:28] congregation just walk amongst our Mitz
[46:30] Lord this morning dear God and bless
[46:33] your people with your divine presence
[46:34] we're so grateful for the infallible
[46:36] proofs you've given to us in our lives
[46:39] and also in the lives of the saints we
[46:41] give you glory Lord in Jesus Christ's
[46:43] name the church said Amen god bless your
[46:46] being seated praise God what we're
[46:53] grateful to be here on Easter Sunday
[46:55] Resurrection Day whatever you want to
[46:57] call it by God's grace and we know it's
[47:00] April Fool's Day so we know the world is
[47:02] fooled right Satan has blinded the minds
[47:05] of them who do not believe and it's so
[47:07] sad but there's so much hope we're sad
[47:09] for them this morning we were signing
[47:11] crying out here at the altar for the
[47:13] abominations done in this city it's so
[47:15] sappy at the same time when we've
[47:17] received the love of Christ we're so
[47:18] grateful for the love of Christ amen we
[47:20] just find ourselves in that condition
[47:22] all the time we feel weary but
[47:24] at the same time we're rejoicing in our
[47:26] hearts it's that great mystery of our
[47:29] three parts of our being praise God so
[47:32] let's look at this mauka have some
[47:33] slides here you can switch over buddy
[47:35] when you're ready I would like to look
[47:36] at the infallible proofs of the
[47:38] resurrection of Jesus Christ
[47:39] this morning by God's grace
[47:43] last year we preached on the Daystar
[47:45] arising in our hearts you may maybe some
[47:48] of you remember that by God's grace but
[47:50] I'm just gonna use the the text that we
[47:51] use this morning with the baptism of the
[47:54] Holy Ghost now I want to just take a few
[47:56] moments here let's look at these
[47:58] infallible proofs that Luke is talking
[48:01] about now infallible means it cannot be
[48:04] it cannot be disputed no one can dispute
[48:07] it it's infallible it's totally true
[48:10] there's no there's no doubt about it
[48:12] that it's it's totally unquestionable
[48:14] and the scripture says again in verse 3
[48:16] that he showed himself alive after his
[48:19] passion by many infallible proofs so
[48:23] after he died he rose and he gave many
[48:28] undoubted proofs that he had rose from
[48:31] the grave in the forty days after his
[48:35] resurrection
[48:36] how many grateful for the resurrection
[48:38] amen oh my that's what our whole our
[48:41] whole faith is founded upon that and
[48:43] first Corinthians 15 Paul says if
[48:44] there's no resurrection you are yet in
[48:46] your sins without hope aren't you glad
[48:48] that Christ is raised and you're not in
[48:50] your sins anymore
[48:51] Amen I'm so thankful for that I'm so
[48:54] happy about that this morning now
[48:56] Matthew Henry said the proofs were
[48:57] infallible plain indicators both that he
[49:01] was alive and walked and talked with
[49:03] them he ate and ate and drank with them
[49:05] and that it was he himself and not
[49:07] another for he showed himself them again
[49:10] and again the marks of the wounds in his
[49:12] hands and his feet and aside which was
[49:15] the utmost proof the thing was capable
[49:16] of or required there were many and often
[49:20] repeated he was seen by them 40 days not
[49:23] constantly reciting with them but
[49:25] frequently appearing to them and
[49:27] bringing them by degrees to be fully
[49:29] satisfied concerning it so that all
[49:32] their sorrow for his departure was done
[49:34] away by it can you imagine those must
[49:36] have been some of the most exciting
[49:46] love you now we know Christ is the same
[49:49] yesterday today and forever
[49:50] and we know Christ doesn't have to
[49:52] physically appear we know his body
[49:53] actually won't touch the earth until
[49:55] it's been burned by fire let me know
[49:56] that but we know that he appears to
[49:59] people in dreams we know that he appears
[50:02] to people in visions how many can say
[50:04] amen to that fact my mom just told us a
[50:06] story where she saw Jesus in a dream
[50:09] recently and was actually trying to get
[50:11] her to repent of her divorce
[50:13] ahum you know Jesus is still alive today
[50:16] jesus loves my mom so much she's trying
[50:18] to he's trying to correct her through
[50:20] dreams because brother Ram said if God
[50:22] can't get somebody believe for the
[50:23] preaching he'll go to another means
[50:25] he'll go through gifts of the Holy
[50:26] Spirit amen I just made me cry and
[50:30] rejoice this week that God is still
[50:32] working on my mom aren't you glad he's
[50:33] still working on you and me too as well
[50:35] oh I'm so glad he'll go to any lengths
[50:37] to bring his children to correction amen
[50:40] oh what a faithful father we serve today
[50:42] oh my hallelujah Christ staying upon
[50:45] earth so long after he had entered upon
[50:47] his state of exaltation and glory to
[50:50] confirm the faith of his disciples and
[50:52] comfort their hearts was such an incense
[50:56] of condescension and compassion to
[50:59] believers as may fully assure us that we
[51:02] have a high priest that is touched with
[51:05] the feeling of our infirmities amen
[51:07] hallelujah if Jesus spent 40 days
[51:10] proving to them over and over again that
[51:13] he's alive how much more can we believe
[51:15] that he's alive today to minister to all
[51:18] of our needs amen
[51:19] he ever liveth to make intercession for
[51:22] you and I he's alive today to help us
[51:25] this morning how many one has helped
[51:26] this morning amen I want to help
[51:28] everyday all the time all my thoughts
[51:31] all my actions I want the help of the
[51:33] Holy Spirit every day now there's 40
[51:37] days of many infallible proofs according
[51:41] to the scripture and so I just was
[51:43] reading in my Bible and something drew
[51:45] me to my Scofield Bible and Scofield
[51:47] laid out the order or all the instances
[51:50] of scripture in which Jesus was seen
[51:53] after the resurrection I thought that
[51:55] would be a good thought to kind of
[51:56] review with the Saints so Scofield gave
[51:59] us this
[51:59] order of our Lord's appearance after his
[52:02] resurrection so if you have a Scofield
[52:03] Bible it's in Matthew 28 verse 6 I
[52:06] believe is where the note at the bottom
[52:08] gives you these events now I had to
[52:10] change the order at the end a little bit
[52:11] for some reason the order was a little
[52:13] off and I'll explain that in just a
[52:15] moment but the very first person he
[52:18] appeared to was Mary Magdalene a woman I
[52:21] mean oh jesus loves women amen
[52:24] geez doesn't degrade women Jesus lifts
[52:26] up the woman praise God that's exactly
[52:29] right Mary Magdalene the woman in which
[52:32] seven demons were cast out of Jesus
[52:35] showed himself to this former prostitute
[52:37] she was the first one to see the
[52:39] resurrected Christ amen infallible proof
[52:43] they men next the women returning from
[52:46] the tomb with the angelic message after
[52:48] they saw the angel they got to see the
[52:51] Lord Jesus as well so the first groups
[52:53] well were women and member they ran
[52:56] after that they ran back to where the
[52:58] disciples were staying and the disciples
[53:00] didn't believe him I mean oh Jesus later
[53:02] on come and rebuked them for not
[53:04] believing the sisters right they
[53:07] wouldn't believe the testimony of the
[53:08] sisters and so Jesus has to come by and
[53:11] rebuke them and say you should have
[53:12] believed and I think you know I
[53:16] mentioned it again I mentioned it before
[53:17] but people get on Thomas and call them
[53:19] doubting Thomas well all all the
[53:21] Apostles doubted they all doubted and so
[53:25] we shouldn't get on Thomas because you
[53:26] would have done the same thing without
[53:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you would
[53:30] acted the same way but the RAM said you
[53:32] would act in the same way Adam and Eve
[53:33] did in the guard of Eden right because
[53:36] we're human we're fallible we need a
[53:39] redeemer we need Christ help all the
[53:41] time amen
[53:42] and then sometime that afternoon Jesus
[53:47] revealed himself personally to Peter Oh
[53:51] God is rich in mercy Church so just
[53:54] makes my heart rejoice that God searched
[53:57] out and found Peter remember Peter and
[53:59] John ran down and John believed when he
[54:01] left but Peter didn't Peter didn't
[54:03] believe and so Jesus had to come to him
[54:06] sometime in the afternoon and show
[54:08] himself alive that's the third group the
[54:10] fourth group was
[54:13] on the road to emmaus with the disciples
[54:15] Cleophus and his friend yeah he showed
[54:18] himself alive and he reviewed himself
[54:20] through the breaking of the bread
[54:22] and that's how you and I come to know
[54:24] Jesus today it's the same Jesus that
[54:26] when when when someone's preaching to us
[54:28] the same Jesus that touches our hearts
[54:31] that feeds our soul that's how we know
[54:33] it's the same Jesus no matter which
[54:35] church rat no matter what night it is
[54:36] Wednesday night or Sunday morning or
[54:38] Sunday night where it is the same Jesus
[54:41] opens the bread the same way praise God
[54:43] he breaks the bed he reveals himself
[54:46] through the Word of God and they know
[54:48] him and we know him through the way he
[54:51] breaks his word to our hearts amen and
[54:54] then that night later that night on
[54:56] Resurrection night he revealed himself
[54:59] to his disciples except for Thomas 10 of
[55:03] them were there not Thomas so he
[55:05] revealed himself to the ten
[55:07] now the next scripture we have is 8 days
[55:10] later he reveals himself with Thomas
[55:14] present to the disciples so now there's
[55:17] already 6 times he's revealed himself
[55:19] he's shown himself that he's alive amen
[55:22] the 7th of courses to the 7 by the lake
[55:26] Tiberias when Peter said I go efficient
[55:28] and they all followed Peter ought to go
[55:30] fishing back to his regular occupation
[55:32] and then the Bible said this is striking
[55:36] in Galilee somewhere near there on a
[55:39] mountain to the apostles he revealed
[55:42] himself to five hundred brethren at once
[55:45] this is why the Bible said that there's
[55:47] many infallible proofs let's go to first
[55:51] Corinthians 15 let's let's read a verse
[55:53] 6 that's I want you to see that first
[55:57] Corinthians 15 verse 6 now this is
[56:02] estimated to be written around 59 ad so
[56:07] almost 27 years after the resurrection
[56:10] look what he says in 1st Corinthians
[56:12] 15:6
[56:13] and after that now Paul's talking about
[56:15] the order which they saw Christ after
[56:18] that he was seen above five hundred
[56:19] brethren at once so more than five
[56:21] hundred of whom the greater part remain
[56:24] unto this present but
[56:26] fall asleep so Paul saying like you can
[56:30] go talk to most of these 500 people some
[56:34] of them had died but Paul saying you
[56:36] Corinthians you guys know you know he's
[56:38] risen from the dead so you can go talk
[56:40] to these people these people are alive
[56:43] and the thing that I love is no matter
[56:45] who you talk to her the 500 they'd all
[56:47] have the same story they'd all see the
[56:49] nail scars in his hands they'd all see
[56:51] the glorified body they'd all see the
[56:53] risen Christ because he's the same
[56:55] yesterday today and forever amen
[56:57] he would have appeared the same way to
[57:00] all of them and they would have known
[57:02] that Christ was risen from the dead
[57:05] amen many infallible proofs Jesus didn't
[57:08] let them guess is he alive he proved to
[57:11] them he's alive and Church of you're a
[57:13] child of God if you want to know God God
[57:15] will prove himself to be alive to you
[57:17] amen
[57:18] I'm so glad he did hallelujah proved
[57:20] himself alive to me now the ninth is the
[57:24] nighttime I'm going to talk more on this
[57:26] later was at Jerusalem and Bethany he
[57:31] showed himself to James the brother of
[57:33] our Lord now we're going to preach more
[57:35] on that little later but this this was
[57:38] not this was not james the son of
[57:40] zebedee and james and john it wasn't
[57:41] that one
[57:42] nor was it james son of alphaeus it was
[57:44] a different this was the actual brother
[57:46] of Christ we know Jesus had at least
[57:49] four brothers and sisters we know there
[57:51] was at least seven in Jesus's family so
[57:55] he then he showed himself to his brother
[57:57] James his earthly pleasure or not fleshy
[57:59] but earthly brother they weren't really
[58:01] brothers because of course Jesus's blood
[58:03] was the blood of God huh me know that
[58:05] amen
[58:06] and then and then he ascended so 10
[58:10] times at least Christ showed himself
[58:13] physically in the in the Corporal
[58:16] glorified body we'd say he showed
[58:18] himself to his disciples he when he
[58:20] ascended all eleven were there at his
[58:22] ascension as he gave the Great
[58:25] Commission and said go into world and
[58:27] preach the gospel to every creature but
[58:29] he said first go up to Jerusalem and get
[58:31] Phil wait for the promise of my father
[58:33] be born again amen
[58:35] that was the main thing go get born
[58:37] again and then go preach the gospel
[58:39] aren't you
[58:40] born again hey man I'm so thankful for
[58:42] it ha ha
[58:44] I could never preach until I was born
[58:46] again amen
[58:48] that's right church now after the
[58:52] resurrection the same year after Christ
[58:55] resurrected Stephen was getting stoned
[58:57] and Stephen was taken outside of
[58:59] Jerusalem to be stoned and Jesus in a
[59:03] division appeared to him in a vision and
[59:06] remember the Bible said he stood he
[59:08] stood to receive Steven and Steven said
[59:10] Lord receive my spirit lay this not to
[59:13] their charge and he fell asleep his face
[59:15] was like an angel amen the 12th time he
[59:20] appeared was near Damascus this is an
[59:24] eighty thirty five so two years later
[59:25] after the resurrection
[59:27] two years after Saul held the coats of
[59:32] the men that killed Stephen two years
[59:35] later Jesus had a meeting with him as
[59:37] well amen hallelujah she's had to make
[59:41] sure I got a he's a chosen vessel to me
[59:44] so God gave him two more years to
[59:46] persecute the church and then God got a
[59:48] hold of Saul's life and changed him to
[59:50] Paul praise the Lord and then years and
[59:55] years they let's read this one you're
[59:56] probably not remember this one this one
[59:58] kind of surprised me let's go to acts 22
[59:59] I'd forgotten about this one Jesus
[1:00:02] literally appeared to saw or Paul in the
[1:00:05] temple in acts 22 17 I want you to see
[1:00:18] this tui this shows how merciful God is
[1:00:20] acts 22 17 is that right yeah I'm in the
[1:00:27] wrong chapter that's why I couldn't have
[1:00:29] trouble reading it to her he says and it
[1:00:31] came to pass that when I was coming into
[1:00:33] Jerusalem even while I prayed in the
[1:00:35] temple I was in a trance so now he's a
[1:00:38] prophet now he's in a vision and I saw
[1:00:41] him sang unto me so picture of the risen
[1:00:44] Christ make hay
[1:00:48] and get the quickly out of Jerusalem for
[1:00:51] they will not receive thy testimony
[1:00:53] concerning me so how many know Jesus
[1:00:56] sometimes Jesus wants you to run from
[1:00:59] persecution how many know that if people
[1:01:01] are led in the persecution praise the
[1:01:03] Lord may God God will strengthen them
[1:01:05] you're nothing to fear if you know God
[1:01:08] is leading into persecution but here
[1:01:10] Jesus tells Paul your ministry is not
[1:01:12] done yet
[1:01:13] you need to get out of Jerusalem and
[1:01:16] it's interesting how Jesus does it
[1:01:18] because if you read the next to the
[1:01:19] chapter the next of the rest of the
[1:01:20] chapter Paul gets caught by a mob but he
[1:01:23] says well I'm a Roman they're gonna kill
[1:01:25] him because he's preaching Christ but he
[1:01:27] says I'm a wrong when you Jews can't
[1:01:29] kill me you got a you got a persecute me
[1:01:31] core to the roman laws and so then the
[1:01:34] government comes and saves paul and then
[1:01:37] he's locked up and those men swore a vow
[1:01:39] they're gonna kill Paul and we're what
[1:01:41] happened Paul's nephew saved him Paul's
[1:01:43] nephew a little young man save the
[1:01:46] prophet of God that's who Jesus used
[1:01:49] Jesus use a little young nephew of Paul
[1:01:52] to tell the Roman guards that these Jews
[1:01:54] are out there gonna kill him so they let
[1:01:56] him out a basket down the side of the
[1:01:59] prison that's our God God could have
[1:02:01] opened the doors like Peter but he
[1:02:03] didn't choose that he chose to use a
[1:02:04] nephew of Paul and I imagine his reward
[1:02:07] will be great on that day don't you
[1:02:09] think Church because Paul's gotten
[1:02:11] Christ told Paul look at verse chapter
[1:02:14] 23 11 let's go to twenty-three-eleven
[1:02:16] because God had told Paul Christ had
[1:02:19] told Paul your ministry is not done yet
[1:02:21] you must go to Rome and bear witness to
[1:02:24] me in Rome so God's Way this time was
[1:02:27] not opened up the doors like when Peter
[1:02:29] walked out of the prison but God's Way
[1:02:31] was taking him out of a basket down the
[1:02:33] side of the prison to preserve his
[1:02:35] prophet God his faithful church whether
[1:02:37] it looks like America or not it's still
[1:02:39] that hand of God amen
[1:02:41] it's still God saving you praise the
[1:02:44] Lord verse 11 and the night following
[1:02:47] the Lord stood by him and said be of
[1:02:49] good cheer Paul for as thou has
[1:02:51] testified to me in Jerusalem so thou
[1:02:53] must bear also bear witness of me at
[1:02:55] Rome in the next chapter you know in
[1:02:58] verse on the same chapter verse 16 is
[1:03:00] where Paul's sister's son
[1:03:02] Paul's nephew alerts the guards and let
[1:03:05] them know that this profit is going to
[1:03:07] be killed unless they save him so they
[1:03:09] saved him amen so that would be the 13th
[1:03:14] time that Christ appeared by scripture
[1:03:18] infallible proofs that he had appeared
[1:03:21] his believers and the last one we know
[1:03:23] by Scripture was to John on the Isle of
[1:03:26] Patmos around 1896 all these infallible
[1:03:29] proofs now what was the proof for the
[1:03:32] believers the proof of the believers was
[1:03:35] their personal revelation of Jesus
[1:03:37] Christ amen hallelujah could they could
[1:03:40] they could Paul prove it to anybody no
[1:03:42] it was his personal revelation the 500
[1:03:46] they couldn't prove it to anybody but
[1:03:48] they could all say I have seen the risen
[1:03:51] Christ so what does Jesus want today
[1:03:53] Jesus wants us today to have a personal
[1:03:56] revelation of him that we can tell
[1:03:58] others you might not believe but I know
[1:04:01] he's alive because he's revealed himself
[1:04:04] to me today
[1:04:05] amen hallelujah look at Morris we've got
[1:04:08] more on James the brother of our Lord
[1:04:10] this is such a beautiful story oh my now
[1:04:15] remember he was the ninth one at least
[1:04:16] in the scripture the ninth one to see
[1:04:18] the Lord
[1:04:19] now there's three James in the New
[1:04:22] Testament how many knew that there's
[1:04:24] more than one James there's three James
[1:04:25] the New Testament we'd say the first
[1:04:27] would be the brother of John James and
[1:04:29] John the sons of thunder they're the
[1:04:31] sons of Zebedee one of the he was one of
[1:04:34] the Twelve Apostles he was the first of
[1:04:36] the Twelve Apostles to be cured say
[1:04:38] eleven because Judas was in there that
[1:04:40] should be eleven sorry about that but I
[1:04:41] forgot about that he's first of the
[1:04:44] eleven apostles to be killed by King
[1:04:46] Herod Agrippa in at44 he was the first
[1:04:49] one to be killed of the apostles now of
[1:04:52] course Stephen was killed before that in
[1:04:53] a t-33
[1:04:55] now the second James was James the less
[1:04:59] the son of Alphaeus one of the Twelve
[1:05:01] Apostles so there was two James that
[1:05:03] were apostles James this James is called
[1:05:06] James the greater the brother of John
[1:05:07] and he's called James the less oh my the
[1:05:12] Heligan verse three
[1:05:15] here's the James we would look at what a
[1:05:16] beautiful church this is a beautiful
[1:05:18] story of redemption
[1:05:19] let's take courage this morning how many
[1:05:21] love to serve the Lord take courage that
[1:05:23] this story and this doesn't encourage
[1:05:25] you
[1:05:26] nothing will but you'll be encouraged
[1:05:28] let me say that you'll be encouraged
[1:05:30] James the brother of our Lord was also
[1:05:33] the author of the book of James and he
[1:05:37] was a leader in the Jerusalem church now
[1:05:41] I got this reference from this website
[1:05:43] if you want it I can email that to you
[1:05:44] later I just put on there for reference
[1:05:45] I don't lose it you know sometimes you
[1:05:47] say well I saw it on a website or I
[1:05:48] heard it there and you we lose where it
[1:05:50] is that's why I try to I'm trying to
[1:05:51] save the references now look at this
[1:05:55] James was probably the oldest of Jesus
[1:05:58] earthly brothers so Jesus would have
[1:06:00] been the oldest he was Mary's firstborn
[1:06:02] James would have been next because they
[1:06:04] came and they they were astonished at
[1:06:06] Jesus wisdom and said is not this the
[1:06:08] carpenter's son isn't isn't his brother
[1:06:10] James Joseph Simon and Judas and that's
[1:06:14] Jude that's Jude who wrote Saint Jude
[1:06:17] those are his actual brothers because
[1:06:19] the Bible said the brother of our Lord
[1:06:21] and his sister so Jesus had at least
[1:06:25] seven he was at least one of seven
[1:06:27] siblings so I'm having my seventh child
[1:06:28] so I feel pretty good God will take care
[1:06:30] of my children by the grace of the heart
[1:06:32] if he'd take care of Jesus Christ one of
[1:06:34] seven he'll take care of mine as well
[1:06:35] because there's actually his sphere that
[1:06:37] formed them in my wife's womb amen and
[1:06:39] his sisters are they not all with us
[1:06:43] whence then hath this man all these
[1:06:45] things so this is the oldest second
[1:06:49] oldest of Mary and Joseph children here
[1:06:52] now James the brother of our Lord he
[1:06:56] lived with Jesus his entire life in
[1:06:59] church at first he did not even believe
[1:07:01] Jesus was the Messiah he even challenged
[1:07:05] the fact that Jesus was the Messiah
[1:07:07] can you imagine imagine living with a
[1:07:10] perfect sibling now Jesus never did
[1:07:14] anything wrong right he never made a
[1:07:16] mistake so see their hearts were not yet
[1:07:19] converted right his family members and
[1:07:21] so even though Jesus was perfect Satan
[1:07:24] had got a little foothold in all Jesus's
[1:07:27] brother
[1:07:28] and sisters hearts they had something
[1:07:30] against Jesus well he just mama's boy
[1:07:33] he's just dad's favorite you know he's
[1:07:36] just he's just the goody two-shoes we'd
[1:07:38] say they didn't believe the Bible said
[1:07:42] for neither did his brethren believe in
[1:07:45] him there's a couple of times in
[1:07:46] Scripture his mother and brothers and
[1:07:49] sisters all come to talk to Jesus and
[1:07:51] Jesus is busy preaching and they said
[1:07:54] Jesus your mother and brethren want to
[1:07:56] talk to you and he said who is my mother
[1:07:57] who is my brother look how he acted to
[1:08:01] his unsaved family members praise the
[1:08:05] Lord when he's in the midst of his
[1:08:08] preaching ministry who did he put first
[1:08:10] did he put his church first or he put
[1:08:13] his unsaved family members first he put
[1:08:16] his church first he said those who hear
[1:08:19] the word of God and follow me that my
[1:08:22] mother they're my brethren that's my
[1:08:24] true family amen who's your true family
[1:08:27] this morning those who love Jesus Christ
[1:08:30] our Lord amen that's your true family
[1:08:33] now of course we know Mary believed
[1:08:35] I'm not saying Mary wasn't a believer
[1:08:36] but she had to take care of the children
[1:08:38] she was a believer cuz the angel told
[1:08:41] her I didn't mean to say like that but I
[1:08:42] think you understand what I'm saying his
[1:08:44] brethren didn't believe that the
[1:08:46] siblings did not believe that Jesus said
[1:08:49] who he was even the Bible said Jesus's
[1:08:51] friends walked up to him and said you're
[1:08:54] mad you know the Bible said that the
[1:08:56] Bible said you're beside yourself they
[1:08:58] walked up to Jesus he's preaching they'd
[1:09:00] heard about miracles they'd heard about
[1:09:01] all these water to wine and different
[1:09:03] things and his friends walk up and say
[1:09:05] Jesus you're outside of your mind
[1:09:07] come on you didn't earn that water to
[1:09:08] wine come on oh you didn't heal that
[1:09:11] sick person you didn't do that now let
[1:09:14] this ought to encourage us here because
[1:09:17] those that that are close to us think
[1:09:20] about your brothers and sisters think
[1:09:22] about your parents that don't believe
[1:09:23] the message or your family or your
[1:09:25] children that don't believe the message
[1:09:27] they might not believe for 20 or 30
[1:09:30] years it's actually factual that James
[1:09:35] did not believe in Christ as the Messiah
[1:09:37] for all those years he didn't believe
[1:09:41] he didn't believe until after Jesus
[1:09:43] resurrected amen imagine your own
[1:09:47] brother dying and then resurrecting how
[1:09:50] could you deny it any longer James
[1:09:52] couldn't because Jesus hand-picked out
[1:09:54] his brother James and said I'm gonna
[1:09:56] reveal myself to James
[1:09:58] so James knows that I'm alive amen
[1:10:02] now look look at the Bible said and
[1:10:05] after seeing the resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:10:08] according to first Corinthians 15 7
[1:10:10] James was in the upper room to receive
[1:10:13] the Holy Ghost amen
[1:10:16] all of Jesus family after he proved
[1:10:19] himself real they all went up to the
[1:10:22] upper room to be born again amen does
[1:10:25] God care about your unsaved family
[1:10:26] members you better believe it amen your
[1:10:29] job is to live as close to Christ as you
[1:10:31] possibly can and trust that God will
[1:10:33] bring them in amen now we can't prove we
[1:10:37] can't guarantee they're going to be
[1:10:38] saved but one thing we can do is ask
[1:10:40] that they can be saved amen and we can
[1:10:43] sanctify our lives that they might be
[1:10:46] saved how many know Jesus did that Jesus
[1:10:49] sanctified himself for our sakes
[1:10:51] haha amen the Bible said they all
[1:10:55] continued with one Accord in prayer and
[1:10:57] supplication with women and the Mary the
[1:10:59] mother of Jesus and with his brethren so
[1:11:03] the same brothers that would cross their
[1:11:05] arms and say you're mad you're beside
[1:11:07] yourself you're a carpenter what are you
[1:11:09] doing what are you trying to do are you
[1:11:11] a false prophet you think you're some
[1:11:13] fantastic new rabbi the same brothers
[1:11:16] that doubted are now praying and say God
[1:11:17] send us the Holy Ghost that was on our
[1:11:19] brother Jesus amen
[1:11:21] almost have had that desire this morning
[1:11:23] o Lord send your power amen glory and if
[1:11:28] God can change the hearts of unsaved
[1:11:30] loved ones then he can do it today
[1:11:32] hallelujah that's what that's what
[1:11:34] that's my brother cams testimony so
[1:11:36] powerful for a whole year he fought
[1:11:38] Simon and I he was like a scriptural
[1:11:40] battle he didn't like the message he
[1:11:43] didn't like William Branham
[1:11:45] he didn't like the Word of God he didn't
[1:11:47] like all of our doctrines but it took
[1:11:49] one year and he finally got hungry after
[1:11:51] fighting for a year he finally got
[1:11:53] hungry
[1:11:53] he went to Craig's house in Florida her
[1:11:56] brother Brooks preached and on the way
[1:11:57] home God opened his heart and said the
[1:12:00] name of the Father Son Holy Ghost is
[1:12:01] Jesus Christ can I be baptized tonight
[1:12:05] so brother Brooks turned around from
[1:12:06] Lima drove an hour back and baptized him
[1:12:09] that very night and now cams been pastor
[1:12:11] and what I've been passed from 12 years
[1:12:12] he's been pastor nine years I believe by
[1:12:15] the grace of Lord God is the only word
[1:12:17] who can change the sinner's heart and
[1:12:19] God if he changed our hearts let's
[1:12:22] believe for the hearts of our family
[1:12:23] members
[1:12:24] don't give up Jesus didn't give up you
[1:12:28] and I can't give up let's serve the Lord
[1:12:30] as a sanctified as we possibly can in
[1:12:33] the head this is James testimony he went
[1:12:37] from he's my brother I've seen him he
[1:12:39] gets tired he gets sick he gets weak how
[1:12:41] could he be the Messiah to believing and
[1:12:44] being filled with the same power that
[1:12:46] was on Christ oh my god we find him in
[1:12:49] 80 46 this is 13 years after the Holy
[1:12:53] Ghost found him we find him as a leader
[1:12:55] at the Council of Jerusalem after the
[1:12:58] Gentiles got the Holy Ghost they all
[1:13:00] said we gotta have a counsel about this
[1:13:01] how is God going to the Gentiles I
[1:13:03] thought this was for the Jews and they
[1:13:05] all came to Jerusalem and had that had
[1:13:07] that great counsel and said well
[1:13:09] Gentiles just now keep these four things
[1:13:11] Gentiles you know don't eat blood don't
[1:13:12] fornicate and always forget the other
[1:13:14] two I can't remember no idols and I
[1:13:16] can't always remember Kemp for I always
[1:13:18] forget that last one but James was there
[1:13:21] and after they had told the testimony
[1:13:23] James spoke and he said Simeon hath
[1:13:25] declared how God at first admitted the
[1:13:28] Gentiles to take out a people for his
[1:13:30] namesake
[1:13:31] so he's the first Jew to speak up at the
[1:13:34] Council of Jerusalem after the other
[1:13:36] Jews have testified corneas got the Holy
[1:13:38] Ghost the Gentiles got the Holy Ghost
[1:13:40] the first Jew to speak up was James the
[1:13:43] oldest of second oldest brother of
[1:13:44] Christ there he went from being a
[1:13:47] doubter of the message to a leader in
[1:13:49] the message hallelujah all by the power
[1:13:54] of Jesus Christ amen
[1:13:55] I love it years later when Paul visits
[1:14:03] Jerusalem the church
[1:14:05] pause James is known as a pillar in the
[1:14:08] church he was a doubter he went from
[1:14:11] doubter to pillar praise the Lord
[1:14:15] because when Peter got out of prison he
[1:14:18] said I'm sorry got into prison he was
[1:14:20] brought into prison and he said go show
[1:14:22] these things unto James and to their
[1:14:24] brethren so the first person Peter
[1:14:27] thinks of who should I tell that I'm in
[1:14:29] prison it was James the brother of our
[1:14:31] Lord the one who used to doubt that
[1:14:33] Jesus was the Messiah but now he's lived
[1:14:37] in the Bible of the history said he
[1:14:39] lived such a godly life then he was
[1:14:41] martyred right outside the temple we'll
[1:14:43] get to that in just a little bit so he
[1:14:46] doubted for all those years but then he
[1:14:48] got converted and then he was the one
[1:14:51] who one of the ones that lived the
[1:14:52] closest to Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit
[1:14:55] was James and he became a pillar in the
[1:14:57] church in other words you say who's the
[1:14:59] strongest people in the church James
[1:15:01] would come up to your lips
[1:15:02] well James he's a real pillar of the
[1:15:04] church he's one of the faithful Saints
[1:15:05] he's a believer if there is a believer
[1:15:08] it's all James the brother of our Lord
[1:15:09] ha ha ha what a testimony hey man I want
[1:15:13] that to be my testimony don't want to be
[1:15:14] here testimony I want to be a pillar in
[1:15:17] the Church of the Living God
[1:15:18] because when Paul comes back to
[1:15:20] Jerusalem the Bible said and I saw James
[1:15:22] Cephas Peter and John who seemed to be
[1:15:25] pillars they perceived the grace that
[1:15:29] was given unto me they gave me and
[1:15:31] Barnabas the right hands of fellowship
[1:15:32] that we should go into the heathen and
[1:15:34] they unto the circumcision praise the
[1:15:36] Lord he was known as the leader he was
[1:15:40] known as a pillar when he doubted and
[1:15:43] said I don't believe that he God so
[1:15:45] changes heart the reality of the
[1:15:47] revelation of Jesus Christ as Messiah
[1:15:49] was so powerful he became a leader in
[1:15:52] the church a man just makes me happy I
[1:15:55] feel like happened to me praise God
[1:15:57] amen now he said this is where he says
[1:16:02] it in Galatians 1 this is around a t56
[1:16:05] so remember 80-43 he was already a
[1:16:07] leader after corneas got the Holy Ghost
[1:16:10] by Peters preaching and then 13 years
[1:16:13] later here in a t56 Paul goes to
[1:16:17] Jerusalem the first time and
[1:16:19] said neither when I have to Jerusalem to
[1:16:22] them which were apostles before me but I
[1:16:23] went into Arabia and returned again unto
[1:16:25] Damascus then after three years I went
[1:16:28] up to Jerusalem to see Peter and a boat
[1:16:30] within 15 days but none of the other
[1:16:32] apostles saw none say James the Lord's
[1:16:34] brother now
[1:16:38] Jude says Jude the servant of Jesus
[1:16:41] Christ and brother of James in Christian
[1:16:44] circles there was really only one man
[1:16:46] named James that was James the brother
[1:16:48] of the Lord because James the brother of
[1:16:51] John he died so early in the apostolic
[1:16:54] ministry so after that though you
[1:16:57] remember the the books of the Bible
[1:16:59] weren't written right away till
[1:17:00] sometimes 20 or 30 years after Jesus
[1:17:02] raised from the dead so these books of
[1:17:05] Saint st. James and st. Jude these are
[1:17:09] written 20-some years after Christ
[1:17:11] raised and so the only man really known
[1:17:14] as James at that time was James the
[1:17:16] brother of our Lord so Jude was the
[1:17:19] brother of James praise the Lord now
[1:17:24] here's how James died what a gallant man
[1:17:26] he died in AD 62 according to tradition
[1:17:29] James was thrown down from the temple by
[1:17:31] the scribes and Pharisees then he was
[1:17:33] stoned in his brains - out with the
[1:17:35] Fuller's Club and that awful but that's
[1:17:38] what they did because he was such a
[1:17:39] godly man he wrote the book of James
[1:17:42] which which you know if you know
[1:17:43] anything about the book of James it's
[1:17:44] one of the most practical applications
[1:17:46] of the gospel to a Christians life it
[1:17:48] was the first letter that was even
[1:17:50] written to Christians was the book of
[1:17:52] James and I've heard it called recently
[1:17:54] I read online where James is called the
[1:17:56] Proverbs of the new testament because
[1:17:58] it's so practical you can learn so much
[1:18:00] like if you see somebody cold and you
[1:18:02] don't give them a coat you don't really
[1:18:04] have faith if you see somebody hungry
[1:18:06] you don't give them food don't really
[1:18:08] have faith faith without works is that
[1:18:11] how many want living faith this morning
[1:18:13] amen remember that
[1:18:22] with blood that just kind of came here I
[1:18:23] saw remember they dashed his head his
[1:18:25] head in they talked about Stephen but
[1:18:27] actually also happened not only Stephen
[1:18:29] but also James the brother of our Lord
[1:18:31] my and think about today think about how
[1:18:35] the Gospels so watered down by millions
[1:18:37] of people they say Oh God has a great
[1:18:41] plan for your life in other words
[1:18:42] they're trying to think oh God wants you
[1:18:44] to be a millionaire or God wants you to
[1:18:46] be a CEO how many have heard and
[1:18:47] prosperity preachers preach that or you
[1:18:49] just yeah they paint this picture that
[1:18:52] you know God is just he has a great plan
[1:18:55] for your life well we'll look at the
[1:18:56] plan for James's life how many want that
[1:18:59] plan for God God's plan for your life if
[1:19:02] it's God's will for me than I like it
[1:19:04] whatever God had planned has for my life
[1:19:07] the perfect will of God I want to be
[1:19:09] obedient to the perfect will of God but
[1:19:12] God's plan was so spiritually beautiful
[1:19:15] for James's life he had almost 30 years
[1:19:17] to preach the gospel because he got the
[1:19:20] Holy Ghost in a t-33 and he got to
[1:19:23] preach 29 years that Jesus Christ is
[1:19:26] alive amen oh what a blessing amen I
[1:19:28] just been preaching 14 years I sure like
[1:19:30] to have 30 years hey if God had granted
[1:19:33] to me before my time to go or whatever
[1:19:35] if the rapture happens but look what a
[1:19:38] testimony he doubted it he fought
[1:19:40] against it you're mad I don't believe it
[1:19:43] you're just my brother to being fully
[1:19:45] supportive of it and preaching for 30
[1:19:47] years and giving his life as a testimony
[1:19:50] that Jesus Christ is alive he's raised
[1:19:53] from the dead he is the Messiah day amen
[1:19:56] hallelujah praise the Lord that's the
[1:19:59] testimony of James the brother of our
[1:20:00] Lord how he appreciate that testimony
[1:20:02] amen now I want to show you some more
[1:20:05] proofs that I read a book and I never
[1:20:08] finished it but somebody handed me a
[1:20:10] book when I first got saved when I was
[1:20:11] 19 at the chapel and I wanted to go
[1:20:15] through just some of these proofs just
[1:20:17] briefly here before we bring it down to
[1:20:18] close
[1:20:20] there's proofs from this book called
[1:20:22] more than a carpenter by Josh McDowell
[1:20:24] that's actually the copy of the one that
[1:20:26] was given to me it's it's the very same
[1:20:28] cover rather how many ever read that
[1:20:30] book any when I read that book no okay
[1:20:33] so
[1:20:34] somebody handed me this book I want you
[1:20:36] to see the actual proofs Jesus you know
[1:20:41] the Bible said there was infallible
[1:20:43] proofs and we know that
[1:20:44] and those infallible proofs were
[1:20:46] actually eyewitnesses that saw Jesus
[1:20:49] Christ alive that's what the infallible
[1:20:51] proofs are but Church no one today is
[1:20:53] alive that did that right they've all
[1:20:56] gone to the grave but they all gone to
[1:20:58] the paradise waiting for the rapture
[1:20:59] amen the sixth dimension are those
[1:21:01] believers but we can still prove through
[1:21:06] our testimony that Jesus Christ is alive
[1:21:08] today how many can say amen to that you
[1:21:11] can be a you can have the infallible
[1:21:14] proof in your life as well
[1:21:17] amen I know I do I know you did to the
[1:21:20] first in his book he said the thing that
[1:21:22] proved Jesus was God was that he's the
[1:21:25] only one that claimed to be God and
[1:21:27] backed it up Buddha Confucius Muhammad
[1:21:31] none of them actually claimed to be God
[1:21:34] Muhammad just claimed to be as the last
[1:21:36] prophet remember and at Jesus trial he
[1:21:40] was really not tried for what he did he
[1:21:42] was tried for who he said he was that's
[1:21:45] why they killed him because you're a man
[1:21:47] making yourself God you blaspheme now of
[1:21:50] course he did good works and you know
[1:21:51] but they all said oh he's got all good
[1:21:54] things that we we there's nothing wrong
[1:21:56] he's an innocent man we find no guilt in
[1:21:58] Christ he wasn't put on trial for what
[1:22:01] he did necessarily but for who he said
[1:22:04] he was the Bible said that he told this
[1:22:07] to Philip he said have I been eaten
[1:22:10] Phillips has showed me the father
[1:22:11] remember that he said show me the Father
[1:22:13] and Jesus said have I been so long with
[1:22:15] you he said that yet thou has not known
[1:22:19] me Philip he that hath seen me has seen
[1:22:22] the father
[1:22:23] Oh Dory amen now we can't say that
[1:22:27] because we are not the image of the
[1:22:29] invisible God we are not the fullness of
[1:22:32] the Godhead bodily but you can say when
[1:22:34] you see me you've seen a manifestation
[1:22:36] of the father we can say that praise the
[1:22:39] Lord because where where did the seat in
[1:22:41] your soul come from did it come visit a
[1:22:44] serpent seed or is it a seed of God if
[1:22:45] it's from God then you're a part of
[1:22:48] God hey man the soul the soul is a part
[1:22:52] of God it's quicken it's a quicken seed
[1:22:54] from God himself amen
[1:22:56] that's right in Jesus no one else ever
[1:23:00] said this but Jesus said before Abraham
[1:23:01] was I already am how did you know Moses
[1:23:05] or how did you know Abraham you're not
[1:23:07] even 50 years old he said before Abraham
[1:23:09] was I am he said because I am Abraham's
[1:23:12] God manifests in the flesh that's
[1:23:15] exactly right and that's what separates
[1:23:17] Christ from all others he claimed to be
[1:23:19] God and he backed it up with his life no
[1:23:22] man can accuse Christ of any sin the
[1:23:27] second thing Jesus claimed to be the
[1:23:29] only way to salvation and forgiveness of
[1:23:31] sins no one else says that he said if
[1:23:37] you believe not that I'm he you shall
[1:23:40] die in your sins oh we should believe
[1:23:42] with all of our hearts amen jesus said I
[1:23:45] am the way the truth and the life no man
[1:23:48] comes in the Father but by me so
[1:23:52] forgiveness only comes through Christ
[1:23:54] salvation only comes through Christ he
[1:23:59] claimed to do this and we know it's true
[1:24:01] praise the Lord
[1:24:02] that's another proof that he's alive
[1:24:04] today he claimed this and backed this up
[1:24:06] a third thing the historical method can
[1:24:10] prove Jesus's existence he actually
[1:24:12] existed on the earth and his testimony
[1:24:15] now the scientific method cannot prove
[1:24:19] Jesus existence because scientific
[1:24:21] method you have to be able to prove it
[1:24:22] repeatedly over and over again just like
[1:24:26] George Washington the scientific method
[1:24:29] cannot prove George Washington was here
[1:24:31] but the historical method can prove
[1:24:34] George Washington lived if you take all
[1:24:36] the history documents remember I read
[1:24:38] this last year there's a doctorate a
[1:24:39] preacher named Bodhi Baucom he said that
[1:24:42] scholars have over 6,000 copies of the
[1:24:44] New Testament text that all greed that
[1:24:47] all agree 6000 the earliest copy was
[1:24:52] written before 120 ad so around 30 40
[1:24:55] years after the last text was written
[1:24:56] because remember the originals
[1:24:57] eventually went went they just went to
[1:24:59] ashes you know they just
[1:25:01] integrated and plus they have thousands
[1:25:05] of other copies of numerous church
[1:25:06] fathers and their commentaries which all
[1:25:09] agree on the authenticity of Scripture
[1:25:11] so you have 6,000 texts of New Testament
[1:25:14] Plus you have thousands of Church
[1:25:16] Fathers that all wrote about the text
[1:25:17] and they all agree now compare that to
[1:25:21] Aristotle the philosopher the earliest
[1:25:24] copy was written around 14 years after
[1:25:26] the original so we have copies that were
[1:25:30] just 30 or 40 years after the original
[1:25:31] but they don't know but these
[1:25:33] unbelievers their earliest copy is 1400
[1:25:37] years after the original
[1:25:39] and remember Homer's Iliad only has 10
[1:25:42] less than 10 manuscripts Julius Caesar's
[1:25:44] Gallic Wars that they take you know the
[1:25:46] history of Julius Caesar from the Roman
[1:25:48] Empire they only have ten manuscripts
[1:25:50] the New Testament has over 6,000
[1:25:52] manuscripts God wanted everybody to know
[1:25:55] that my son was here and these
[1:25:57] testimonies are true praise God
[1:25:58] hallelujah I love this Josh McDowell
[1:26:02] said this there exists no document from
[1:26:04] the ancient world witnessed by so
[1:26:07] excellent a set of textual and
[1:26:09] historical testimonies no other history
[1:26:13] about any other person has even a close
[1:26:16] as good of a set as historical proof as
[1:26:20] the gospel of Jesus Christ in offering
[1:26:24] social suburban array of historical data
[1:26:25] on which an intelligent decision may be
[1:26:28] made an honest person cannot dismiss a
[1:26:31] source of this kind skepticism regarding
[1:26:34] the historical credentials of Christian
[1:26:35] is based upon an irrational bias in
[1:26:37] other words you just don't want to
[1:26:39] believe because you just don't want to
[1:26:40] believe Christianity has more proof more
[1:26:43] historical documents than any other
[1:26:46] non-christian source God the Bible said
[1:26:50] God will never leave himself without a
[1:26:51] witness amen
[1:26:53] hallelujah now this is all on top of how
[1:26:57] we are supposed to have personal
[1:26:59] revelations of Christ the personal
[1:27:02] revelation of Christ is the infallible
[1:27:05] proof but on top of that God gave you
[1:27:07] more evidence that God gave you more
[1:27:10] proof he gives you his storico proof as
[1:27:13] well amen
[1:27:15] here's another proof he goes through
[1:27:17] Jesus's followers willingly died for the
[1:27:21] truth now Jesus followers and apostles
[1:27:27] would not willingly die for a lie
[1:27:30] especially if they knew it was a lie cuz
[1:27:32] no one willingly dies like that if they
[1:27:34] knew it was a lie now you say what about
[1:27:36] Muslims that die for their sins well I
[1:27:38] was thinking on this some skeptics say
[1:27:41] that Muslims die for their faith but
[1:27:43] they die different deaths than Christian
[1:27:45] martyrs how we know that it's not the
[1:27:47] same type of death Muslims die as guilty
[1:27:51] murderers and the church said when they
[1:27:54] go blow themselves up or whatever they
[1:27:56] do or you know in a plane or the you
[1:27:58] know like the 9/11 whatever they do they
[1:28:00] die as guilty murders in suicide but
[1:28:05] Christian martyrs die innocently
[1:28:07] as lambs they die alone and they die in
[1:28:11] faith obedience to the Word of God amen
[1:28:13] hallelujah they're two totally different
[1:28:16] kinds of death amen see that the Muslim
[1:28:20] may think it's true but he's deceived
[1:28:22] because he's dying in sin but a
[1:28:24] Christian has been revealed to him that
[1:28:27] Christ is alive and he dies innocent he
[1:28:30] dies with no blood on his hands amen
[1:28:32] glory hallelujah what a difference the
[1:28:38] followers willingly died for the truth
[1:28:41] of Christ they're not dying for a lie
[1:28:43] like those people that'll burn
[1:28:44] themselves and oh we need more rights
[1:28:46] and all these things they're dying for a
[1:28:48] lie they're dying that for politics but
[1:28:50] a Christian is dying for the resurrected
[1:28:52] Christ
[1:28:54] remember the beater said we've not
[1:28:56] followed cunningly devised fables these
[1:28:59] are not stories that are made up when we
[1:29:02] made known unto you the power of the
[1:29:03] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ by but
[1:29:07] were eyewitnesses of his majesty
[1:29:09] that's what we're believing we are
[1:29:10] believing eyewitnesses and look what
[1:29:14] John said many other signs truly did
[1:29:17] Jesus and the friends of his disciples
[1:29:18] which are not written this book but
[1:29:21] these are written that you might believe
[1:29:23] amen
[1:29:24] I mean how do you know when you read the
[1:29:26] Bible your faith Rises
[1:29:27] you're reading eyewitness testimonies
[1:29:31] amen hallelujah when you read the book
[1:29:34] of Genesis you're yeah the book of
[1:29:36] Genesis and Exodus you're reading a
[1:29:38] testimony of an eyewitness Moses saw the
[1:29:41] Death Angel pass amen
[1:29:43] Moses all the plagues fall Moses sold
[1:29:46] the Red Sea part
[1:29:48] he was the eye witness of the power of
[1:29:49] God amen
[1:29:51] so all the apostles so his brother
[1:29:54] branham so are we
[1:29:55] we're eyewitnesses of the power of God
[1:29:58] when you've seen Jesus do America when
[1:30:00] you've seen God in those dream or you've
[1:30:02] seen God speak to you God reveal your
[1:30:04] heart you have seen the resurrected
[1:30:06] Christ
[1:30:07] you've seen him manifest himself today
[1:30:09] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:30:11] amen hallelujah and we read our Bible it
[1:30:17] ought to become more real to us the Holy
[1:30:20] Spirit meditate upon these things the
[1:30:22] Holy Spirit makes us believe even more
[1:30:24] how many are witness of that hallelujah
[1:30:28] this is the one I love I love this one
[1:30:32] the changes in Jesus apostles and
[1:30:35] followers including st. Paul prove the
[1:30:37] resurrection was a reality as well as
[1:30:40] the changes in your own life this is a
[1:30:43] proof that the resurrection actually
[1:30:44] happened the hope of Jesus apostles were
[1:30:47] shattered after his crucifixion remember
[1:30:49] they were hiding away they were hiding
[1:30:51] away on Sunday morning because member
[1:30:56] they thought Jesus was going to conquer
[1:30:58] Rome like a physical Conqueror but jesus
[1:31:01] said My Kingdom is not of this world
[1:31:03] it's a spiritual Kingdom and after the
[1:31:07] resurrection the entire outlook and
[1:31:08] direction changed from hiding out they
[1:31:11] got the Holy Ghost and they started
[1:31:12] spreading out hey men glory even as we
[1:31:17] learned about st. James st. James no
[1:31:19] longer delight deny this about his
[1:31:21] brother he was one of the leading
[1:31:22] creatures in it even st. Paul's
[1:31:26] conversion from a vet vehement
[1:31:28] anti-christian to a faithful sufferer of
[1:31:31] the cross of Christ for 25 years proves
[1:31:36] he had seen the resurrected Christ this
[1:31:38] proves it history documents prove that
[1:31:40] saw
[1:31:41] I got converted into Paul all history
[1:31:44] all these documents they prove it this
[1:31:46] was a real man and he spent 25 years not
[1:31:49] in luxury like Christians many
[1:31:51] Christians do today but he spent it
[1:31:53] suffering to give God glory amen
[1:31:56] 25 years of suffering I like the
[1:32:00] preacher say today
[1:32:01] why if I don't have my own jet I get
[1:32:03] tired out can you imagine the Apostle
[1:32:05] Paul saying that he'd get on boats and
[1:32:09] he'd travel I'm sorry something went out
[1:32:12] he would travel and he would he'd get
[1:32:14] beat and memory got shipwrecked close at
[1:32:16] five times he got shipwrecked remember
[1:32:17] that church remember all that the resume
[1:32:21] that he had five times he was
[1:32:23] shipwrecked I believe he didn't have no
[1:32:26] speedboat or anything like that he now
[1:32:29] had the finest clothes he was a prophet
[1:32:31] of God he suffered but he's willing to
[1:32:34] suffer because he knows Jesus is alive
[1:32:36] that's right now Church don't forget
[1:32:39] this you and I have experienced the
[1:32:42] resurrection to some degree not the
[1:32:46] physical body yet but you should have
[1:32:48] been resurrected in your soul let me
[1:32:52] know that so see that's why we can get
[1:32:55] excited today even if I've never seen a
[1:32:56] dead person raised I physically I know
[1:32:59] I've been raised spiritually the Bible
[1:33:03] says that the Bible says we don't have
[1:33:06] time to read all this but the Bible said
[1:33:07] you were dead in your sins
[1:33:10] but now you've been quickened or made
[1:33:12] alive together with Christ by grace
[1:33:13] you're saved and has raised us up
[1:33:17] together amen
[1:33:19] Oh Church used to live way down here but
[1:33:22] now Christ has raised you up in the
[1:33:25] heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen
[1:33:27] he's lifted your life your life was dead
[1:33:30] it was useless it was hopeless dead but
[1:33:34] you should have felt him lift you up
[1:33:36] into heavenly places that's the power of
[1:33:38] the Resurrection today that's why I can
[1:33:41] rejoice and know I know Christ raised
[1:33:43] because I've been raised because he
[1:33:46] raised me amen that's exactly right and
[1:33:50] see that's an infallible proof to me
[1:33:53] that Jesus Christ has risen from the
[1:33:55] dead
[1:33:55] it ought to be to YouTube look at
[1:33:58] Colossians 2:12 he says the same thing
[1:34:00] you're buried with him by baptism so if
[1:34:02] you really died out to your will when
[1:34:04] you got baptized where and you're also
[1:34:07] risen with him if you really died at
[1:34:10] your baptism than you really raised at
[1:34:12] your baptism hallelujah through the
[1:34:16] faith of the operation of God who hath
[1:34:20] raised him from the dead and you being
[1:34:24] dead in your sins and the uncircumcision
[1:34:26] of your flesh hath he quickened together
[1:34:28] with him having forgiven you all your
[1:34:31] trespasses amen
[1:34:33] not just some of your sins Church all
[1:34:35] your sins that's what he did when he
[1:34:39] raised you from your dead life of sin
[1:34:41] your life of lusts your life of greed
[1:34:43] your life of anger and hatred and pride
[1:34:46] when he raised you from that he raised
[1:34:49] you up and forgave you all your
[1:34:51] trespasses oh thank you Jesus amen
[1:34:54] hallelujah so now they were raised what
[1:34:58] this is where we battle Church now if
[1:35:00] you're raised what are we seeking our
[1:35:02] lives the Bible said we must seek those
[1:35:05] things which are above that's why we get
[1:35:08] discouraged as Christians we if we're
[1:35:10] all if we're sincere we can all see our
[1:35:12] life has changed but then we get
[1:35:13] discouraged with things in life we can
[1:35:16] discourage why does this happen why
[1:35:18] didn't that why does it more of this
[1:35:19] happen or why didn't why did this have
[1:35:20] to happen but we must constantly seek
[1:35:23] first the kingdom of God and His
[1:35:25] righteousness and everything else will
[1:35:28] be added unto us that's right if you're
[1:35:31] is it how many risen with Christ this
[1:35:33] morning glory if you're risen we need to
[1:35:36] seek for things above we need to spend
[1:35:40] our time seeking the will of God seeking
[1:35:43] treasures in heaven if we've been raised
[1:35:47] and we're no longer dead we should live
[1:35:49] for what we've been raised up into
[1:35:51] heavenly places Oh hallelujah
[1:35:53] set your feelings set your affections on
[1:35:56] things above not on things of the earth
[1:35:59] for ye are dead and your life is hid
[1:36:03] with Christ in God this was an
[1:36:05] infallible proof that Christ raised
[1:36:08] the change in people's lives to see them
[1:36:10] go from dead not doing the will of God
[1:36:13] to the will of God
[1:36:15] that's an infallible proof Jesus Christ
[1:36:17] raised from the dead hey men Romans six
[1:36:20] we don't have time to read all but one
[1:36:21] to eighteen but therefore we are buried
[1:36:23] with him by baptism unto death that like
[1:36:26] as Christ was raised up from the dead by
[1:36:28] the glory of the Father even so we also
[1:36:31] should walk in the newness of life
[1:36:34] how many walk in a new life I know you
[1:36:38] can say you can say I know I don't walk
[1:36:40] like I used to I walk in the ways of God
[1:36:42] I walk in the Word of God our walk
[1:36:45] should feel brand new to us amen
[1:36:49] likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be
[1:36:51] dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God
[1:36:54] through Jesus Christ our Lord let not
[1:36:56] sin therefore reign or rule in your
[1:36:59] mortal body that you should obey it in
[1:37:01] the lusts thereof amen
[1:37:05] so we should walk in a new newness of
[1:37:08] life and we should rule over all the
[1:37:10] temptations of sin and this is what we
[1:37:14] read last year where we preached on last
[1:37:15] year for Easter Peter said we also have
[1:37:18] a more sure word of prophecy where until
[1:37:20] ye do well that you take heed as unto a
[1:37:23] light that shine ahthe in a dark place
[1:37:24] until the day dawn and the day star
[1:37:28] arise in your hearts how many can say
[1:37:31] that your heart was once a very dark
[1:37:34] place your mind used to be a very dark
[1:37:38] place filled with hatred filled with
[1:37:41] greed and lust and it used to be a very
[1:37:43] dark place er where where you knew it
[1:37:46] was dark because the words that came out
[1:37:47] of your mouth were dark right because
[1:37:50] jesus said through from the abundance of
[1:37:52] the heart the mouth speaketh all but one
[1:37:55] day the day star arose in your hearts
[1:37:58] and the darkness was scattered by the
[1:38:00] light of Christ love how do you praise
[1:38:04] the Lord Amen my heart is not dark
[1:38:07] anymore
[1:38:07] my heart has light shining in it the
[1:38:10] light of Christ's glory number six is
[1:38:16] the empty tomb the only scenario of the
[1:38:19] empty tomb and missing body of Christ
[1:38:21] that
[1:38:22] any historical support is that Jesus
[1:38:24] literally raised from the dead some
[1:38:26] people say oh no he faked it you know he
[1:38:28] had some ate some weeds or something
[1:38:30] like that and slept and then he married
[1:38:32] Mary Magdalene and went off to India
[1:38:33] there's all these guests out there but
[1:38:35] there's no historical proof for that why
[1:38:39] because we know there's six thousand
[1:38:41] documents plus thousands others that all
[1:38:43] say the same thing that Jesus Christ
[1:38:45] literally raised from the dead now look
[1:38:50] what he says he said MacDonald has a
[1:38:51] reasonable answer for each scenario so
[1:38:54] they in the book he goes through all the
[1:38:55] different scenarios well you know he was
[1:38:57] drugged or he moved to India he faked
[1:38:59] his death they go through all the
[1:39:00] scenarios and though he does not a test
[1:39:03] absolute certainty he clearly states
[1:39:05] that the resurrection of Jesus Christ is
[1:39:07] either one of the most wicked vicious
[1:39:09] heartless hoaxes ever foisted upon
[1:39:12] people or it is the most important fact
[1:39:14] in history you and I believe it was the
[1:39:16] most important fact in all of history
[1:39:19] amen
[1:39:20] so there's no middle ground all the
[1:39:22] evidence says this it's either the
[1:39:23] biggest hoax or it is the most important
[1:39:26] day in all history you can't sit on any
[1:39:28] middle ground and we're standing on the
[1:39:30] ground with Christ amen he did raise he
[1:39:33] is alive today he's the same today amen
[1:39:36] lastly I think this is the last one yeah
[1:39:39] so the book goes through these the
[1:39:42] prophecies Jesus fulfilled some scholars
[1:39:46] say there's 300 prophecies of Christ
[1:39:48] from the Old Testament that were
[1:39:50] fulfilled in the new some were spoken as
[1:39:53] much as four thousand years before
[1:39:54] Christ four thousand years chairman from
[1:39:58] Pasadena College estimated that the
[1:40:00] probability of one man fulfilling just
[1:40:02] eight of those prophecies would be one
[1:40:05] in 10 to the 17th power that's one in
[1:40:07] that's one in 100 quadrillion that's the
[1:40:11] possibilities of one man just fulfilling
[1:40:13] eight of those not all 300 just eight of
[1:40:18] them and Jesus fulfilled all 300 church
[1:40:22] amen
[1:40:23] that's right church that's exactly the
[1:40:25] word he for he remember he said not one
[1:40:29] jot or tittle will pass from this word
[1:40:31] to every word be fulfilled amen
[1:40:35] remember David wrote about the
[1:40:37] crucifixion before crucifixion was even
[1:40:39] invented a thousand years before Christ
[1:40:43] and Jesus comes on the scene and
[1:40:46] fulfills all of them in a matter of a
[1:40:48] short thirty three-year period most of
[1:40:51] them were fulfilled we know in the last
[1:40:52] hours of his life the references to the
[1:40:56] cross and the crucifixion now that's
[1:41:01] just my notes I must get past that let's
[1:41:03] close with this here there's one more
[1:41:04] infallible proof that can be stated this
[1:41:07] wasn't in the book but this is what we
[1:41:09] know this were brother Bram labored on
[1:41:10] the Jesus's power in the Apostles amen
[1:41:15] infallible proof jesus said he that
[1:41:19] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:41:21] shall he do also and greater works than
[1:41:24] these shall he do because I go to my
[1:41:26] father these signs shall follow them
[1:41:30] that believe in my name they shall cast
[1:41:32] out Devils they shall speak with new
[1:41:34] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[1:41:36] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:41:38] not hurt them they shall lay their hands
[1:41:40] on the sick and they shall we
[1:41:43] praise the Lord I've seen numerous of
[1:41:46] those happen in my life jesus said this
[1:41:49] is what will follow a true believer
[1:41:51] they'll do the works that Christ did
[1:41:55] hallelujah
[1:41:56] look at acts 4 said if we this day be
[1:42:00] examined the good deed done to the
[1:42:02] impotent man the miracle of the impotent
[1:42:04] man walking at the gate beautiful by
[1:42:06] what means he's made whole be it known
[1:42:09] unto you are unto the all the people of
[1:42:10] Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ
[1:42:12] of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God
[1:42:15] hath raised from the dead even by him
[1:42:17] doth this man stand before you hope this
[1:42:21] is the stone which was set at nought of
[1:42:22] you builders which has become the head
[1:42:24] of the corner neither is there salvation
[1:42:26] in any other for there's none other name
[1:42:29] under heaven given among men whereby we
[1:42:31] must be saved now when they saw the
[1:42:34] boldness so they saw the power of Christ
[1:42:37] then they saw the boldness of Christ
[1:42:39] when they saw the boldness of Peter and
[1:42:42] John and perceived they were unlearned
[1:42:43] and ignorant men they marveled and they
[1:42:46] took knowledge of them that they'd been
[1:42:48] with
[1:42:48] Jesus how are people gonna know that you
[1:42:51] and I been with Jesus they see the power
[1:42:53] of God in our lives there's that right
[1:42:55] and they see our bonus for Christ amen
[1:42:58] that's how they're gonna know oh they've
[1:43:01] met Jesus they've been with Jesus
[1:43:03] they've felt the Holy Spirit they've
[1:43:05] been baptized by the Holy Ghost they're
[1:43:07] gonna know because of the power and
[1:43:08] boldness in our lives that's exactly
[1:43:11] right
[1:43:12] later on the chapter the Bible said when
[1:43:15] they believed they were of one heart in
[1:43:17] one soul neither said any of them that
[1:43:21] ought of the things which he possessed
[1:43:22] was his own but they had all things in
[1:43:24] common and with great power gave the
[1:43:28] Apostles witness of the resurrection the
[1:43:32] Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them
[1:43:34] can you say men this is another
[1:43:37] infallible proof how do you know because
[1:43:40] Jesus did miracles through the disciples
[1:43:42] he promised he would and he did the
[1:43:44] miracles amen now let's close with a few
[1:43:48] quotes brother Graham I went through
[1:43:49] some of the quotes on brother branham's
[1:43:51] thoughts on the infallible proofs
[1:43:54] programs saying this in commemoration of
[1:43:57] our Lord Jesus who has raised him from
[1:43:59] the dead and standing here now in our
[1:44:01] myths of showing signs and wonders of
[1:44:04] his resurrection infallible proofs that
[1:44:06] he's risen from the dead and is not dead
[1:44:08] but he's living in his church aren't you
[1:44:13] glad he's living in his church we thank
[1:44:15] thee for this and bless this girl and
[1:44:17] grant her request in Jesus Christ's name
[1:44:19] he said bless you young sister and his
[1:44:21] mercies be upon you sir burhan tells us
[1:44:23] where Christ is living today he's living
[1:44:26] in you and I praise the Lord he said wow
[1:44:30] this is a different sermon what a
[1:44:32] wonderful fellowship together I believe
[1:44:34] with all my heart that today this little
[1:44:36] old Tabernacle will see the direct
[1:44:39] evidence that Jesus Christ raised from
[1:44:42] the dead visible before their eyes God
[1:44:47] healing the sick doing great signs and
[1:44:49] wonders that the Great Commission
[1:44:51] included so in 1955 brother Graham said
[1:44:54] I believe we're gonna call the sick up
[1:44:55] and they're going to be healed and
[1:44:57] you're gonna see people healed with your
[1:44:59] very own eyes and he said that's direct
[1:45:01] every
[1:45:02] that Jesus Christ is alive hey how many
[1:45:06] ever seen somebody healed in a service
[1:45:07] they come back and testified of it later
[1:45:09] I know I've been healed twice in service
[1:45:11] I literally walked in sick or what got
[1:45:14] sick and serviced and walked out well by
[1:45:16] the grace of the Lord see this is a sign
[1:45:19] and brother I'm saying you are gonna see
[1:45:21] evidence an infallible proof that Christ
[1:45:25] is alive when the sick come up and they
[1:45:27] get healed right in the service amen
[1:45:30] he's that great atonement that was made
[1:45:32] at the Calvary included these things and
[1:45:34] to me at the infallible proofs of his
[1:45:36] resurrection hallelujah
[1:45:39] after he raised from the dead he said
[1:45:41] you must go into all the world and
[1:45:42] preach this gospel to every creature
[1:45:44] the sign shall accompany them that
[1:45:46] believe
[1:45:47] huni believers we have a couple more and
[1:45:50] you can have all the Cathedral all the
[1:45:52] rubbings dumb out Catholics how they rub
[1:45:54] down the the toes of the statues and all
[1:45:57] the everything else you want but give me
[1:45:58] the resurrected power that I can see the
[1:46:01] Lord Jesus today has the lily of the
[1:46:03] valley in the morning star that seals it
[1:46:06] to me that I can say with Jove of old I
[1:46:08] know my redeemer lives amen
[1:46:12] now this is a sermon when I was
[1:46:15] listening to this week he said but I
[1:46:17] believe with all my heart God is going
[1:46:18] to let us have the service this morning
[1:46:20] as we have asked him to do it now I
[1:46:22] believe that he will do it therefore if
[1:46:23] he will by his great presence and his
[1:46:26] omnipotence that means then that he is
[1:46:29] in our presence how would it be the
[1:46:31] presence of Christ is here he said
[1:46:34] wherever two or three gathered how many
[1:46:35] believe he's here by God's grace and
[1:46:38] what a wonderful time on Easter morning
[1:46:40] to find the resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:46:43] walking among men walking here as an
[1:46:47] infallible indelible proof that he did
[1:46:51] raise from the dead o most privileged
[1:46:54] people we would be if Christ walks among
[1:46:57] us this morning the living resurrected
[1:47:00] Christ how privileged are we church that
[1:47:05] the Holy Spirit walks among us this
[1:47:07] morning amen
[1:47:09] the same one that raised 2,000 years ago
[1:47:12] is walking amongst us today and willing
[1:47:15] to help us
[1:47:16] if we just ask him believe LeGrande said
[1:47:20] that's my contentions is what I've been
[1:47:22] contending for that Jesus is not dead
[1:47:25] he's not he's alive very much alive and
[1:47:28] will be forevermore and if God will just
[1:47:31] let us by his grace I believe this
[1:47:34] morning that we can prove to you beyond
[1:47:36] any shadow of doubt by the help of the
[1:47:39] Holy Ghost that Jesus did actually
[1:47:41] raised from the dead and is living right
[1:47:44] here today living right here in the
[1:47:46] building
[1:47:47] amen key Majan I wonder where Jesus
[1:47:50] would be this morning if he's here I
[1:47:52] wonder where he's at well I know many
[1:47:54] times he stands to the rock like brother
[1:47:55] have said the angel Lord was standing
[1:47:57] right here and that be the Ange of the
[1:47:58] Lord right where would it be if Christ
[1:48:02] is in our midst where would he be he
[1:48:04] beat all those who have a hungry heart
[1:48:06] for the gospel he be seeking number
[1:48:09] broham said with the visions and in the
[1:48:11] prayer lines he would see the pillar of
[1:48:12] fire go from one person to the next
[1:48:14] whoever would be believing the holy
[1:48:17] spirit tried to get each person to
[1:48:18] believe and I've read the quotes before
[1:48:20] I don't have mirror but Lorenzo he's
[1:48:21] trying to get to get the unities or when
[1:48:23] I was going over here and he's going
[1:48:24] over here Christ is in our midst he r
[1:48:27] trying to help us he's walking here with
[1:48:29] us he is here amen amen
[1:48:34] he's living right here in the building
[1:48:37] this morning Jesus Christ because he's
[1:48:41] alive and well he said I see someone
[1:48:44] coming I see seen a vision I see some
[1:48:46] coming from far away it's coming in a
[1:48:48] place it's the man he comes from a
[1:48:49] country where there's lots of trees it's
[1:48:50] Virginia suffering with arthritis you
[1:48:52] believe God heals you and makes you well
[1:48:54] you accept it you do you come from
[1:48:59] Virginia here to be here two bars rise
[1:49:00] is that right all the way do yes sir
[1:49:03] you're healed now you can go back with
[1:49:05] your heart he said and your heart
[1:49:07] trouble has left you turn out of the
[1:49:09] line and go back here well God makes you
[1:49:11] well thy faith has saved thee so there's
[1:49:16] one thing we need this morning Church
[1:49:17] for God to minister to us we just need
[1:49:19] faith in his word let's turn our feet he
[1:49:23] said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:49:24] you believe he's raised from the dead he
[1:49:28] said the congregation says amen
[1:49:30] the infallible proofs of his
[1:49:32] resurrection he said have faith how many
[1:49:36] of Jesus Christ is here this morning I
[1:49:37] believe with all my heart he comes to
[1:49:42] that he comes to the rejected Church you
[1:49:46] know I was look at my friends Facebook
[1:49:48] this morning I'll just put some pictures
[1:49:49] of Facebook of our family on there and
[1:49:51] some of our friends that claim to know
[1:49:52] Jesus we're in concerts last night rock
[1:49:54] and roll concerts do you think Jesus can
[1:49:56] visit their church this morning probably
[1:49:59] not when they go there and smoke and
[1:50:02] drink it and dance the worldly things
[1:50:04] and those are spirits of demons on those
[1:50:07] singers and dancing like that where
[1:50:09] could Jesus find a church that loves the
[1:50:11] righteousness of His Holiness this
[1:50:13] morning could he find that here this
[1:50:15] morning could he walk in our midst and
[1:50:17] help us out this morning I believe he's
[1:50:20] more than able to do that by God's grace
[1:50:23] but one thing we need is faith in God's
[1:50:26] Word
[1:50:27] brother if you come and play that that's
[1:50:28] pressing have faith in God if anyone has
[1:50:31] a need this morning let's just have a
[1:50:33] word of Prayer and then we'll invite you
[1:50:34] up if anyone has any needs I'm gonna go
[1:50:37] back to that quote Jesus Christ walking
[1:50:42] among men today the same Christ not in a
[1:50:46] corporal body but in his we say
[1:50:49] glorified her the Holy Ghost of
[1:50:50] theophany Christ he's here but in a
[1:50:55] different body the resurrected Christ
[1:50:59] oh I'm so happy about that this morning
[1:51:01] I'm so happy that he's raised me up I
[1:51:05] know what the resurrections like because
[1:51:07] he's raised my life up oh that's why
[1:51:13] each there's always so glorious because
[1:51:16] I know what I can understand part of
[1:51:18] that you were dead in sins and now
[1:51:21] you're raised up in heavenly places now
[1:51:25] we can come and we can spend time with
[1:51:26] Christ and we can worship and we have no
[1:51:29] fear to raise our hands before I used to
[1:51:31] barely raise my hands before I could
[1:51:34] barely sing and hardly get out a note
[1:51:36] but all now we just love and worship
[1:51:39] where we're walking the freedom of the
[1:51:41] Holy Spirit where the spirit Lord is
[1:51:44] there's Liberty and we have the Liberty
[1:51:48] of God Jesus Christ walking among men
[1:51:52] and women as a proof he raised from the
[1:51:56] dead let's just pray Heavenly Father
