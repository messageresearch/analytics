blessing real i want to make the lord pleased edifying so may god give you guys strength this morning or this afternoon here we're going to try and get through this by god's grace just at the end there maybe towards whatever it'll be a little bit of a it'll be a nugget there i want to i want to bring forth i pray it's crystal clear the lord gave me another scripture back there which was really good that's pretty exciting i didn't see this one before but you know you gotta you know just because lord gives you a little thought you gotta you gotta you gotta look at it really examine it make sure it's right and yeah the lord did give me another scripture and i mean it's really plain but uh but uh anyhow i just think it's a blessing uh to have uh little nuggets i got still got my uh trail shoes on so we'll start down the trail this flipping again um so uh let's get into the word here let's go to uh where do we go from here let's see let's go to genesis 3. genesis 3. and we'll start with this scripture right here excuse me i'm sorry i forgot to charge the battery so they're out i can take that whole thing or i didn't even turn it on oh it wasn't on it wasn't always it on there oh no [Music] turned on all right genesis 3 14 and 15 will say we'll read that then we'll say a word of prayer right verse 14 says in the lord god said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shout thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life so here now the serpent has received a curse and look what god says he says and i'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel so let's say a word of prayer lord jesus lord we're at the closing lord of this age lord we're at the closing of this day lord and glory of this one last little bit lord there was ordained lord or the pastor feels allowed to have two services on sunday lord our lord here we are lord and lord we want to present the second portion lord of the meal that you've given us lord god and lord may be may you just bless it lord and break forth the bread god and lord may we all go home full god lord just chewing lord on your word god and thinking on on doctrine lord thinking on you lord god and lord just seeing how blessed we really are lord lord you have been so good to us lord god and we cannot even even begin to repay with our lips lord and our hands and our lord our but lord we try to give our lives every day lord to you lord yield the lord to your word lord we want to be obedient lord holy to it lord we love you and lord me just have full control over this little mouth here and tongue god and especially lord as well as those out in the seats there lord and bless this service lord your sister care and lord and strengthen her god and cousin jimmy lord and all those that need you lord and we love you in the name of jesus christ amen let me have your seats all right see my wife even stayed wow god bless her i didn't feel like taking the groundhog we're not the groundhog but the ground greyhound [Laughter] home tonight yeah trying to find a place out with you guys man cat out there uh so we want to continue on the trail the serpent and we want to uh deal with the two seeds we want to deal with this powerful question here if we can just determine this this would really solve everything and now and for your young younger ones uh lydia malachi i can't remember your name brother daddy's young sisters there you know these are things that are coming up on growing up in your teenage years and if you guys be the next generation to be uh christians real christians i'm gonna say message believers because we're christians um christians that believe the message i say like that uh christ is our uh that's who we identify with and jesus christ he's done it all he's the one that set the message the message come out of the bible and the message helps reveal the bible so anyhow we want to get into this thing if we can just figure out by god's grace who cain's dad was this was cain a a son of god or was he something else was he this or that and uh there's many things i would like to say um but we don't want to hurt feelings we don't want to uh offend and we're going to go with just some scriptures here we'll hit this and uh i want to come to my point but anyhow let's continue on here you see here in in first john 3 let's examine this this is pretty clear here who was kane we know kane um he was a disobedient brother disobedient son one that done did not love his brother he says little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous right even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil i mean goodness this is this is john the divine the revelator uh the one that did not did not become a martyr this is one who is a direct son of god in fact when john wrote his own book there john he says this is the disciple whom jesus loved he left his name out and just said jesus loves me that's how he identified himself you hear the revelation that he was loved of god read verse john it's all about love absolutely comforts you i was i had a really rough time a rough time about five years ago maybe six years ago now actually coming this march and sleepless nights and all those things and i just went went downstairs just the way it's written he says for the purpose of the son of god was manifest that he might destroy works the devil for whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him right and he cannot sin because he was born of god we're dealing with what holy ghost-filled christians that have what the very seed of god in them now notice in verse 10 remember what we talked about earlier in in matthew 7 it says he says a good deed cannot bring forth evil fruit an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit but what evil begets evil and good begets good amen he says now in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil god have mercy this is just as plain as can be there are two sets of children and for you new testament scholars and those that read the new testament this runs all the way through even even obviously all the way into the old testament he says whoever doeth not righteousness is not of god there's matthew 7 he says neither he that loveth not his brother now notice where john has taken this he's taken this all the way he says and he brings in those that do not love their brother for this is the message that you have heard from the beginning whereas the beginning all the way back in genesis that we should love one another he said this is this identifies everything who will love who love divine love agape love is a distinction yes not filio but agape not as cain who was of the wicked one right is there any scripture that says adam is of the wicked one or adam is the wicked one not one scripture but he says cain was of the wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works right he was an evil tree bringing forth what evil deeds evil fruit were evil and his brothers were righteous and if his brother is righteous we can determine right there that abel was a son of god because the bible says that the righteous blood of abel in hebrews 13 i'm sorry hebrews 11 hebrews 11 the righteous blood of abel absolutely so that amen is another scripture there there's a here's a little and there's a little two marvel not my brother if the world hate you correct amen now if cain was a son or or or of the devil does this run through the rest of scripture the word i know you all know these things but we're just looking at it then jesus sent the multitude in a way and went to the house and his disciples came at him saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field right and he answered said to him he that soweth the good seed is the son of man he says this the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom right there's again he says and the tears are the children of the wicked one right there's two sets of children and they identify that these children uh are the tares are the or the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil does it say god does it say adam is it peter no it's not peter but it is actually the devil himself the harvest in the world and the reapers are the angels okay now is this a spiritual seed the enemy that sow them is the devil so if the devil has children they must be spirits as well that's an argument we're seeing here that i'm seeing is oh brother it's not literal it is figurative it is spiritual and not natural okay so now here notice in john 8 now this is the natural let me ask you a question if they say this is literal or i'm sorry if this is a spiritual thing is matthew mark luke and john is that not did that not take place on earth or was that in a spiritual dimension what if matthew mark luke and john was a spiritual dimension that we we could not see with the carnal eye but what what was actually recorded by the disciples were the very broken to the v to do to the dimension of the spirit realm and they're looking in the spirit realm they're watching jesus in the devil battle and jesus and the demons and angels and all those things is matthew mark luke john in the spiritual realm no it is in this what this earthly earthly fleshly realm absolutely he's now look here in john 8 and verse 22 then said the jews will he kill himself because he saith i whether i go he cannot come and he said to him ye are from beneath in genesis 1. the bible said that god created the the animal life in this old earth but then he said later he said directly on the same day he says let us make man in our image right where was that that took place up in heaven because we see in the seventh day after creation is finished in genesis i believe it was two that one that's after the completion of all that he takes now the it's like this the soul of adam and makes what a man of flesh and puts it on the earth amen amen yes and hides even there too and that's reform that's right he says ye are from beneath he says i am from the he says i am from above year of this world he says i am not of this world and neither are we amen amen as the song says i am not this is not our home we're just a passing through amen sure and he continues all with his his sermon here he says if the son of man there shall make you free he shall be free and free indeed he says now i know that ye are abraham's seed now here's the place where they also get confused brother sign look they're from abraham's sea line they're saved the promise went through abraham's seed line he says but notice jesus said though you came directly from abraham's law and he says he says but you he says ye seek to kill me remember an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit because my word hath no place in you i speak that which i have seen with my father and you do that which you have seen of your father now this this is not just this is not just a prophet this is god in flesh this is the almighty the great i am now in his body his flesh body and he's calling out exactly who these people are is he lying is he lying is he making a figurative thing no he's calling them and telling them exactly what's going on he's breaking down revealing exactly who they're who they are he says then he says in verse 39 he says then they they answered said to him abraham is our father jesus said to him if abraham's if ye were abraham's children he would do the works of abraham so now he just said you're of abraham he says but if you were of abraham that's right well it looks kind of confusing brother he says but now you seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham he says you naturally came out of abraham he says but he said he said but your seed line is not abraham's seed which proves what there was a mingling before that had taken place right now remember if you look if you look at noah's day the bible said the noah's day that noah was perfect in his generations perfect the bible says perfect flawless no mistake what all the way from abraham all the way back to adam and they all married their own with within the holy seed line they go through the flood i believe it let me look real quick here it's in genesis let's look real quick so i want to make sure and right here in genesis 10 i'm sorry nine sir genesis 9 verses 20. and noah began to be a husbandman and he planted a vineyard and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered with his tent now remember if the bible says that if noah was perfect in his generations and if he married one of his own kind which is a daughter of god he was perfect there was no mixture there everything was in him was pure then his three sons would be pure sons of god he says and and he drank of the wine and was drunk and he was uncovered within his tent and and ham the the father of canaan saw the wickedness of his father sorry i'm sorry saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers without and shem and jacob took his garment and laid it both between the shoulders went backward and covered the nakeds of their father and their faces were uh backward and they saw not their father's nakedness and noah awoke from his wine and knew that his younger son well your son younger son had done unto him and he said cursed be canaan why does not noah curse him he cannot curse him because ham is blessed he could not like directly lay a curse upon him because he was already blessed he was perfect seed line genealogy but what he cursed what as it said here verse 10 and him the father of canaan he curses his great great whatever grandson however was and that came through what we you know mixture of uh the sons of god saw the daughters of man and came unto them made wives and those sort of things so obviously ham had married a serpent seed no doubt about it now let's continue on here he says if you were abraham's children you would do with the works of abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that had told you the truth he said which i have heard of god this did not abraham the mixing came after the flood which is what dealt right here in genesis 20. he said this not not abraham now notice what jesus says ye do the deeds of your father then they said unto him we be not born of what we'd be not born because my because eve ate apples or she ate this or ate that he says but we be not born of what the act of fornication we have one father even god jesus said to him if god were your father he is saying that god is not their father he says ye would love me very clear how do you how can you get away from this this doesn't need an interpretation this is christ bringing there was absolutely no symbolism brought here jesus now this isn't even the scare the pharisees sadducees subscribes he's dealing with jews the bible said these are just jews who followed him and who said the bible said believed him up until this time right and he just flat out just told them who they were he says if god were your father you would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me why do you not understand in my speech even because you cannot hear me he says ye of your father the devil just like king and the lusts of your father you will do he was notice he connects the devil and cain right here he was a murderer from the beginning he says an abode not of the truth because there is no truth in him and when he speaketh the lie he's speaking of his own for he's a liar and the father of it so the question i've been dealing with another question they said psy i have 40 scriptures 40 scriptures that said that the devil has children he said then there's scriptures that say they're servants he he said they can't be the same they're separate i said what do you mean he's like well this is a spirit and this is carnal and i as calmly as i could i said brother if the devil is a spirit and he can enter into an animal and let's say god set the stage just like he did in genesis 1 and that animal seed could mingle if it could mingle and the devil knew it and he figured out because he was a scientific genius and the devil came and dwelt within that serpent and used that serpent to propagate what he had to do is that possible and they said yes it's possible well then let's not argue about because it's possible now if it's not possible then we got an issue but if it's possible then then chances are it took place because how else can the devil have children who are flesh was jesus talking to spirits here no he was talking to people in flesh that ate three times a day that that breathed that needed to drink water that had that we could reproduce right he was dealing with people and yet they're children of the devil so i asked him are you a son of adam or a son of god because what's the difference if god wanted children why didn't he just speak them all he did up there but then he chose what a vehicle he chose of fleshly bodies to bring those forth amen amen who were they dealing with the great i am now notice here let's jump from that he was dealing with the great i am now here's i'm gonna i'm just gonna show you this here real quick see what and i wanna show you the i wanna show you the blindness okay you guys ready for this because when i this when i saw this okay my heart was like when i'm when i'm dealing here i've been dealing with this for about three days and my heart was just because i cannot believe what i'm reading most of the time okay this is a taking off of my whatsapp here and i've crossed out the name to protect identity because what i love my brother now look he says very clear bro the use of beguiled has nothing to do with relations nothing absolutely nothing i was like okay let me look at the definition here uh nasa or nasha to lead a stray that is mentally okay there's mental issues to delete or morally to seduce so i looked it up here i said morally seduced check check [Laughter] to lead astray to carry out physical relations blah blah blah i said pretty clear he actually sent something that had the definition in it i said brother you have a 50 50 chance here it has two meanings now 50 50 50 chance you're right and 50 chance you lose that's what we call a that's not even a dice that is like an that's like a a coin would you bet your salvation on a doctrine with a flip of a coin absolutely not right that's what i call crazy that was just one little thing i was like what are you you know no response after that now look at this here this is the problem this is the problem right here is this chronological is this exactly the fall took place uh god comes down judges serpent eve adam then it shows those sort of things and then we come to this and adam knew his wife eve and she conceived and bear cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord so who are we listening to whose testimony is this eve's own word the bible says let a woman learn in silence with all subjection he says i suffer not a woman to teach he says nor to absolute or usurp authority over the man but to be in silence for adam was first formed then eve adam was not deceived he says but the woman was deceived in the transgression yeah so what do we have here we have a modern i'd say an old school joyce meyers [Laughter] anyone want to listen to that woman anyone want to look at it she's starting to look like i mean i'm going cardinal just way back in the late 80s looking like joker all right i mean it's just remember ant-man adams okay yeah so this is a woman preacher though is a a daughter of god a woman preacher and people for i was like this people 6 000 years ago are still being deceived by her sermon six six thousand years ago and she's still deceiving what was she she was a deceived woman preaching who what preached your own doctrine and paid people take this doctrine and make it a one scripture doctrine now notice what was adam's first what how did adam get in a fall and look how god rebukes adam and and he said in the end because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife now he did it because he loved her but she had a little cern for him too showing something showing him something new that she had just learned something new that just taken place with her one and god refused him for it modern day joyce meyer right there so that eve was this daughter of god joyce meyer we remains to be seen and as eaten of the tree which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it now so does this run is cain the son of adam saints of god he is not a son of adam is taking eve's word good enough in the saints of god we gotta let's we have to we had to fact check that god mercy modern day we got back fact checkers we have a fact checker right here this is our fact checker absolutely and it's not too uh atheists or or or satanists who own fact checker but it's actually the very god himself in a book he says okay let's look in here this is our encyclopedia this is our word of god right here all right now the she said that uh let me tell you something the devil hated service this morning so much my laptop quit working back there for an hour i couldn't even get it to pop off it pops off and you can switch it and those sort of things i had you know internet started trying this this and i started praying i said lord god i couldn't even type on it it wouldn't even connect i started praying and after one hour it finally just kicked in and i was like the devil is not happy you know what we're not we're gonna make him more even more unhappy tonight [Laughter] oh absolutely we're gonna we're gonna show uh we're gonna show us something we'll expose him you know all right hey man now let's continue on here so is this correct he says what did eve say i have gotten a man from the lord about cain right now we just went through the scripture there he says the bible says in verse john he says that cain was of the wicked one right now we have two contradicting scriptures what do we do is eve right or is john right or is god the wicked one no there's so many questions you can ask good good okay now here's the parable all these things fake jesus in the on the multitudes without a spirit will speak unto them then it might be filled which was spoken by the prophet saying i will open my mouth in parables he says i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundations of the foundation of the world right all those seven parables were preached and jesus the bible said that jesus what was he doing he was revealing things that have been kept secret from what from the foundations of the world and after all this his disciples came into him and said he said gee they said jesus what okay those are good but and i don't understand any of them but i really don't understand tares what is tares and jesus said he the soweth the good seed of the son of man the field of the tares the good seed are the children of the kingdom do you know six or seven denominational pastors and their wives shut up when i brought this to them we had the showdown and i said let's read this because this is the interpretation of the parable you can't interpret this parable i can't interpret this parable let's just see what it says it needs no interpretation because this is this is it this is the interpretation but the terrors are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil my goodness saints of god we cannot get much more plainer now as we run through the trail the serpent continuing on here says now look uh jesus goes through these woes now is is this clear let's let's read this and see how just how clear this is what unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the subcultures of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets so they actually said this and jesus heard it and he reiterates it back to them he says wherefore ye be the witnesses unto yourselves the e are the children of them which killed the prophets they could literally run their genealogy all the way back to those that killed jeremiah that tortured these saints of god these men of god and then notice what jesus says fill ye up then the measure of your fathers ye what does he say ye serpents you generation of vipers how can you escape the damnation of hell right behold i send you this one this one this one you persecuted kill them all he says that it may that upon you may come all the righteous blood shut up on the earth from the blood of righteous abel who took cables or abel's blood was cane it traces the lineage he's running he's running the what the the seed all the way back justice we showed stephen did the same thing he ran it all the way back that's the trail blood it's a blood trail our trail is blood and so is theirs amen now is this pretty clear or not yes now look at this another whatsapp snap i've sent the same scripture the serpent she generation of vipers now look what i said being called generation of vipers here is not being called serpent seed okay it's not so do you believe that nicodemus was serpent seed that's not the that's not the question that's not the point the point is there is serpent seed that's the distinction i'm trying to make if cain was a son of god then we don't have a problem but if cain was the son of the serpent we have a major issue and that there are still serpents here because god comes on the scene four thousand years later and identifies that they are serpents still amongst them and in fact it calls them a generation what is that word generation means it means an offspring production fruit generation generation is an offspring this is the book of the generations of adam this is the offspring of adam in the day that now notice as as they went through cain's lineage in genesis 4 moses starts over said okay they went this way but he says now this is the book of the generations of adam now notice in the day that god created man what he goes all the way back to genesis 1. these are the ones that are blessed this is the blessed seed line these are the ones that's given dominion over all the earth all everything to god all everything that we needed it was all theirs this is for them replenish the earth takes the dominion subdue everything he says this is the generation look at exactly what that generation means birth generation family history same thing so we know the first woman caused the fall the first fallen preacher calls the fall and you know the greatest explanation of this comes from the message of this hour when a church gets away from the word it will believe anything it will it is like eve right we've all seen this quote when cain was born she said i've got the man from lord now do you realize that she really meant that she thought that she had a man from the lord so let me ask you something was cain a man from the lord now remember it was a mingled seed a saint of god i don't want to bring hybrid because that's a modern day term i want to use the scriptural term mingled or mixed because that is a scriptural word the serpent was created by god but then the son and daughter of god were created by god as well but when you mixed them this was not in the original this was not original creation he says so you see once she had been deceived by taking the word of satan instead of the word of god she then thought that she but whatever she said was right and she's smart this is pre-fall or sorry this is right after the fall very very intelligent woman very intelligent man she says if she said that she had a man from god then she had a man from god she believed her own word he says but god has set laws in his universe a good seed can only bring forth good fruit and evil seed can only bring forth evil fruit now each seed though different will utilize the same earth nourishment moisture and sunshine but it will bring forth after its own kind notice the history of the cain's line notice the history of seth line only one difference between them original seed nothing else that's it saints of god it's not we can see because we're smart it's not we can see these things and believe these things or receive the holy ghost because we're anything special god placed a seed in us a gene a god gene seed not the holy ghost a literal gene seed because remember the foolish virgin make it as well they have representation already up there they will be seed they will they will be saved because what their name was already written they have to be saved because they are seed of god if the holy ghost was needed for salvation why the old testament saints go up they had they didn't have it but what they had seen representation and they had the token for their day and if we have seen representation in us and which gives us the ears to hear and eyes to see and we have the baptism of the holy ghost saints of god we will make this rapture amen because we will have in i was like this there was a type ours is the antitype we have exactly what they have except greater amen we have the actual literal blood of christ amen now he says if you look at the statement of eve real close you will notice that she had more understanding and more root than she realized but remember we cannot lean on on our own understanding we must lean on god's understanding he says she did not attribute the son to satan for that would have made him equal with god only god could create the egg in the womb of mary satan couldn't do it and she knew that eve knew that satan could only pervert so he beguiled her with the wrong seed it was the serpent seed that brought forth cain it was adam seed that brought forth seth and abel abel and seth these these seeds went through the exact same process but the children were different for they come from different seeds and that's exactly right now notice he just goes through and breaks down eve's lie eve's thoughts he just went through that whole whole thing right now notice what he hits directly after this the prophet of god if you think this is an exaggeration think of second timothy three i charge you before god and the lord jesus christ who shall bring who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word beating instant incense in season out of season rebuke reproof exhort with all along suffering he says and doctrine he says for the time will come will they will not endure sound doctrine he ties this scripture directly after revelation or sorry genesis 4 1. this is why because servant seed is sound doctrine as every time we witness about it i break it down in genesis 3 and i say would you believe it i i've i've told you what it is but would you believe it if i showed you where john the baptist preached it jesus preached it peter preached it right john the divine priesthood and uh paul preached it five witnesses in the new testament that say this was exactly correct amen that's a lot to go against right now look at this one here was the serpent the father of cain or the wicked one was the serpent the father of cain or the wicked one can't be both he said send me your best three scriptures the devil would literally be the serpent in the garden the devil was in the garden it was in the serpent it can be both if the devil was in the serpent pretty easy the devil's a spirit not physical if the devil who is a spirit was in sight of animal it's possible i mean wow this is not common core it happened in ezekiel 28. yes he can be inside animal but he can't be a literal father well let me say it like this do you think the serpent come up with this idea no he did not come up with this idea and then i went on i keep saying i want your three best scriptures he says i got 40 scriptures to talk about the children of the devil not children of the serpent seed two separate things you see that you see there they have a disconnect somewhere there's a disconnect you know what i found out they don't understand they don't understand mingling and you know the crazy thing is is the prophet of god will always say hybrid hybrid hybrid hybrid and what the prophet god said prophet god said once it's hybrid it cannot reproduce and that meant that thought is still in them because they sent me quote after quote after quote i said let's forget the prophet you guys only believe him forget the prophet let's use scriptural words mingled you don't mingle this inside you bro let's just do an example inside brother jesse there was mingled seed a lot of female and two males so far [Laughter] well how come brother jesse he's a male he only brought forth he should only bring four men no because there's women and men mingled within his scene that's impossible [Laughter] but what if there was a creature who could mingle between human and man and not only would there be men and women serpent but there could be men and women sons of god all within the same line both genders two separate seed lines all mingled if you have you ever see the double helix the dna why is it twisted like a serpent when they have performed the rituals ever see the snakes in the snake pit reproduce they twist like that just like the helix just a thought for you let's continue on here so saints of god do you do ye thus requite the lord o foolish people and wise is he not thy father that has brought thee hath he not made thee in establishing remember the days of old jesus remember the days of old consider the years of many generations ask thy father and he will shooting thy elders and they shall tell thee when the most high divided the nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of adam well these must be separate from the sons of god no they're one and the same that's right amen he said the bounds of the people according to the name is the number of the children of israel here we see cain's lineage correct yeah all the way through we know these i mean this is basics here we see adam plunge yeah starter right he goes right back to genesis 1. yes you're once again the serpent she's generally just ranged vipers uh now notice he says here he says uh look at verse 32 fill ye up then the measure of your fathers do you know what's a prophecy what's the measure of their fathers all i see is they're drunken with the blood of the saints of the martyrs of jesus christ that's right but he says fill ye up what was the last thing they had to kill the messiah himself you ever catch that stephen caught up with this you stiff nicked and uncircumcised and hard and ears you do always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so to you which are the prophets have you not your father's not persecuted and they have slain them who shoot before the coming of the just one of whom ye have now been the betrayers and murders they fulfilled it jesus said fill it up phillips uh stephen comes and says you filled it up you fulfilled it exactly and what they killed them for all right see they're trailed just as bloody that's right absolutely now i want to get to this nugget i want to prove that genesis 4 1 is out of line out of timeline yes okay hope you're ready this might be basic but it's so clear once you see the scriptures now let's jump to this genesis 3 13 and the lord said to the woman what is it that thou has done and the woman said the serpent begaw me and i eat and the lord god said unto the serpent behold thou hast done this thou are cursed above the cattle above every beast of the field upon the belly that shall go and thus shalt thou eat all the days and life he says and i will put hatred between thee and the woman and between thy seed who's he talking to the serpent he is talking to the animal and he said the animal had seed yes so here's the question brother johnny who has seed the male or the female the male has seed the male carries the seed that's why i take on the last name of the mayo yes but notice what it says between thy seed and percy i thought the male carried the seed and not the female but god said thy seed and her seed it shall bruise ahead and thou shalt bruise his heel he said the woman had seed but i thought the men only carried the seed here is dealing with abraham and isaac he says unto thy seed will i give this land then we see isaac he says i'll make thy seed to multiply the stars of the stars of heaven right how can a woman have seed she only carries the egg i notice this is a little terrible here jesus escaped then came over to the the sadducees which say there's no resurrection they said to him master moses wrote unto us if a man's brother died and he leave his wife behind him and leave no children then his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother right who carries a seed the man and now there were seven brothers and the first took a wife and died dying left no seed and the second took her and died left and he neither left any seed and the third likewise and the seven and seven had her and left no seed the male carries the seed right how does eve have seed in leviticus 12 and the lord said to moses saying speak unto the children rizzo's saying if a woman have conceived seed and born a man-child what i'm trying to say is that god is saying that once the seed goes forth from the man where's the seed at in the woman eve was already pregnant because once the woman receives seed whose seed is it it's her seed because if a woman have conceived seed and born a man-child now notice notice the law of jealousies well if a man if the spirit of jealousy would rise up a man and and he thinks that she had cheated on him or whatever and and it goes to the priest and there was there was a certain thing they had to drink a certain kind of water and ashes and all kinds of mix and if she drank it and her thigh begins to rot she's guilty but if she drank it and nothing takes place if the woman be not defiled but clean then she shall be free and conceived c she shall have c in other words she can become she's she can be pregnant conceiving c is pregnancy yes and eli blessed akana and his wife and said the lord give the seed of this woman how does a woman see come out of a woman she's got to be being her yes good good for the loan which is lent the lord and they went their own home through faith also sarah received herself received strength to conceive seed yes he was already pregnant god said between thy seed and adam's seed his seed her seed she was already pregnant now notice and adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and called his name seth for god said god has said she said appointment another seed god gave her what another seed instead of abel who came slew she received seed it was her seed when she were praying pregnant this is my seed this is my son this is my daughter this is mine now yes and look at hagar here this was this was powerful this is what lord show me in there now sarah abraham abram's wife bear him no children and she had a handmaid of an egyptian whose name was haggar and sarah came unto abram and behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing i pray that go unto thy my my maid if it may be that i obtain children by her and heart and abraham hearken to the voice of sarai listen to another woman preacher and he went in verse four into hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes because verse five and when she saw that she had conceived i was despised and rise lowers between lord judge between me and thee right so here abraham goes into sarah i'm sorry hagar hagar conceives seed now notice the angel of the lord but abraham said unto sarah i behold thy hand man as thy hand is in thy hand do her as it pleases pleases and when sarah dealt hardly with her she fled from her face and the angel of the lord found her by the fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way of uh sure and he said who the angel lord hagar says hey might whence cometh thou and whether the ghost thou whither thou goest and she said i flee from the face of my mistress sarai and the angel the lord sent to a return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands and the angel lords unto her i will multiply thy seed i thought it was abraham's seed not when it's in her it then becomes the seed of the woman eve was already pregnant i'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seat she was already pregnant to me that was absolutely it makes no sense any other way yeah amen now is there such a thing as a mingling now when these things were done the princes he says came to me saying the people of israel and the priests and levites have not separated themselves from the people of the lands doing according to their abominations even of the canaanites the hittites pesorites jebusites amorites moabites egyptians and amorites for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons so that they that the holy seed have mingled themselves is there a holy seed absolutely is the sea gene of god and here ezra is disgusted why because this is the original sin and when i heard this thing i read my garment and mantle and plucked off the hair of my head and my beard oh and sat down as the stone astonished stoned here in isaiah 6 13 here says so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof and if you read this this is exactly what jesus said in matthew 13. he said he said just keep preaching he says they will not be able to hear they'll not be able to see but he says what he says but then i'll leave them a tenth and it shall return and shall be eaten as the teal tree and as an oak whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves in other words when it looks like it's dead he says there's still going to be seed left and it'll be what the holy seed shall be the substance of amen sure now is there hybrid possible in animal life absolutely hybrid bluegill will produce within your pond so not every single hybrid cannot produce there's at least one and i'll say there's at least two we know what the second one is but here's another one and if this be possible what else could be possible so i thought genesis 4 1 was literal if it was literal why would adam say that she was the mother of all living she was all what remember as as god came down and judged the serpent thy seed and her seed and then she moved to eve adam was right there and he heard it said oh my goodness she's pregnant he said i'm gonna give you a name change you're no longer adam like me he says you're different he said you're eve he says and you will be the mother of all living all right absolutely now did the serpent have seed it says so here's sir here here's the the the old serpent himself lucifer sun in the morning breaks down his plan right here he accomplishes the plan all the way into the size of the north if you study that deep sides of the north you know what that means uh they shall look narrowly nearly upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that hath made the earth to tremble to shake the nations now jump down to 20 he says he says thou shalt not be joined with them and burial because thou has destroyed thy land and slain thy people he's slain his own people servant satan doesn't care about his own children he could care less he's the most jealous self-centered creature on the face if there was ever fallen he says the seed of the evil doers shall never be renowned prepare slaughter for his children for iniquity for the iniquity of their fathers that they do not rise nor possess land nor fill the face of the world with cities here it is uh psalms 37 28 for the lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his saints for they are preserved forever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off god mercy saints this is clear he says here in second peter 2 he says uh verse 12 but these as natural brute beasts made i was in a discussion with a couple baptists at a baptist church one time and i shared this with them they said you you don't have any scripture i said what are you talking about i said i wrote i read in romans nine and they're like i said they said show me one scripture where it says they were made that way yeah okay shannon's accepted he says they were made to be taken and destroyed and they they quit their conversation right there you want it you got it he says speak evil of things that they do not understand what if they understand malachi 4 and shall utterly perish in their own corruption he says look having eyes full of what took place in the beginning he says that they cannot cease from sin he says beguiling exactly from the beginning unstable souls look now they're giving souls a heart with ha they have exercises with covetousness practices cursed children they're already cursed ways of balaam and those sort of ways he says but speak evil those things which they know not notice peter and jude have the exact same revelation of these people they've observed them peter's watched this and they do this jude's coming back and says yep they do the exact same thing i saw them do why because an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit they bring forth the same thing every single time speak evil of the things which they know not they don't understand it but what they do know naturally is brew beasts are they spiritual or what no the bible says they're natural brute beasts in those things they corrupt themselves wound to them for they have gone in the way of their daddy right and read greatly at the air of their daddy and perish in the way again saying of their other daddy amen now let's ask this eve had seed right what if they say well this is a prophecy of christ but who's he talking to is he talking to eve he's not talking to eve he's talking to the serpent i'll put em between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed who is what they say most scholars believe that her seed is jesus right and her is mary seed and thy seed if jesus is fulfilled here then we should see serpents in jesus's time did we see serpents in jesus time john the baptist says oh jesus said so peter said so john said so and so did paul [Laughter] prophecy fulfilled thy seed he says and shall bruise thy head and shall bruise thy heel what serpent never got their head bruised who's he talking to satan wait so he's talking to two people at once the serpent and satan absolutely yes absolutely he says thy seed he says in satan i'm going to bruise your head who's in the serpent who did this satan inside the devil i'm sorry the devil inside of the serpent it's an incarnation a manifestation or like this uh a devil possession amen now let's you we don't have much longer with god mercy we're in an hour so sorry he's dealing with serpents absolutely he says either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit cropped or the tree is for the tree is known by his fruit oh generation of vipers how can ye being evil he calls them evil they cannot bring forth good speak good things he says for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things and the evil man out of his evil evil treasure bringeth forth evil things amen covered most this already let's stand here by the grace of god we're at one hour i don't know if i've shared this with you guys this assembly yet but if this is just all made up serpent seat is all just made up and just fairy tales and uh the scripturals the scripture is not literal and they're you know the devil's really not you know was incarnated the serpent or this devil does not identify himself with the serpent and vice versa you guys ever seen this this is saint peter's basilica anybody see a snake here maybe and eyes the snake is crowned pregnant it's got a long tail anybody ever think that if there's no service either there's nothing has to do with this why would the catholic church the great of babylon identify themselves i was pregnant as an obelisk here notice the forked tongue oh right there pork tongue coming out of the mouth this is real architecture this is not by chance but this is by design there's no serpent seed let me tell you something if we be the children of god and we know who we are [Music] they know who they are and they do this in now who can only see this only the last hundred years have we been able to go into the air who did they who did they make this to show who are they tempting who are they laughing in the face of god this is these are aerial views views saints this is views that god can see look how bold they are right mocking saying yeah we're surprised we're going to get you there's so many things yeah it's the skin what's this right here what's this right here that's the snakeskin which is cobblestone looks just like snakeskin saints of god they know who they are we are dealing with literal serpent seed no services okay forget everything explain this [Laughter] you know what let's just explain that well cya came by evolution and no we're dealing with the catholic church here and they are in direct defiance of god almighty yes sir they are declaring themselves that seedline and they say we are going to rule your children and we are going to take this earth and inherit it because we were here first were they here first absolutely sixth day we didn't get here till after the seventh we brought down so they think they own it but it was built for us amen let's say a word of prayer brother if you can come play brothers and sisters if you wanna come play everybody feel okay amen saints of god i just hope that little nugget there was just a blessing and made it just because remember christ always did double prophecies two-fold prophecies studied the church ages double prophecies studied montreal transfiguration double prophecies study baptism there's double it's twofold it goes all the way her seed and thy seed yes all the way through let's say a word of prayer but feel good let's say a prayer dear the father lord jesus lord we love you we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and lord jesus we just ask lord you be with these people lord bless the lands lord as they

the stage the bible says according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto adoption by by of children by jesus christ unto himself according to the good pleasure of his will everything was planned there is no pickups everything if the sky is turning correctly the stars everything is lining up just right and they can predict hundreds and thousands of years down the way we can look at this and say this thing's hitting just exactly once again i'll say it again we have not been deceived all right i got a book back there with over two or three hundred scriptures all dealing with original sin i usually don't even hit him in my studies with people [Music] the saints of god all the way
