[6:01] 6
[6:04] genesis chapter six and then we'll go to
[6:06] joshua
[6:07] chapter one
[6:10] amen genesis chapter six
[6:12] uh let's just start reading that verse
[6:16] five
[6:20] oh my
[6:23] genesis 6 and 5 the bible says and god
[6:27] saw that the wickedness of man was great
[6:29] in the earth
[6:30] and that every imagination of the
[6:33] thoughts of his heart
[6:34] was only evil continually
[6:37] and it repented the lord
[6:40] that he had made man on the earth and it
[6:43] grieved him
[6:44] at his heart
[6:46] and the lord said i will destroy man
[6:48] whom i have created
[6:51] from the face of the from the face of
[6:53] the earth both man and beast and the
[6:55] creeping things and the files of the air
[6:58] for it repeats me
[6:59] that i have made them
[7:03] but noah
[7:04] found grace in the eyes of the lord
[7:08] amen let's go to
[7:10] joshua
[7:11] chapter one
[7:15] amen the bible says verse 1
[7:17] it says now after the death of moses the
[7:20] servant of the lord it came to pass
[7:23] that the lord spoke unto joshua the son
[7:25] of nun
[7:26] moses minister saying moses my servant
[7:30] is dead now therefore arise go over this
[7:34] jordan thou and all
[7:36] this people unto the land which i
[7:39] do give to them
[7:41] even to the children of israel
[7:44] every place that the soul of your foot
[7:47] shall tread upon
[7:49] that have i given unto you as i said
[7:53] unto moses
[7:54] from the wilderness
[7:56] and this lebanon even unto the great
[7:58] river the river euphrates
[8:01] all the land
[8:03] of the hittites and unto the great sea
[8:05] toward the going down of the sun
[8:09] shall be your cults
[8:11] there shall not
[8:13] any man be able
[8:15] to stand before thee all the days of thy
[8:18] life as i was with moses
[8:21] so
[8:23] i will be with thee i will not fail thee
[8:26] nor forsake me be strong and of a good
[8:30] courage for unto this people shall thou
[8:33] divide
[8:34] and inheritance the land which i swear
[8:37] unto their fathers to give them amen
[8:40] lord bless reading of his word you can
[8:42] have your cease tonight
[8:45] amen
[8:50] church
[8:52] the word of god is so rich
[8:55] and we we have to believe that we're in
[8:58] bible days
[8:59] you know that we're not just out here
[9:02] floating around somewhere but
[9:04] we should be able to look in the bible
[9:06] and be like man i'm here
[9:08] this i i see this upon the earth
[9:11] i see this in akron ohio or in my case i
[9:14] see this in south carolina you know the
[9:17] bible it should be a reality the
[9:19] scriptures should be reality to us as as
[9:22] christians but tonight by by god's grace
[9:25] i want to use for a subject under the
[9:27] influence
[9:28] under the influence and you know
[9:31] normally when we think about that under
[9:33] the influence
[9:34] we think about maybe some substance
[9:36] abuse
[9:37] maybe somebody who's who's who's if i
[9:40] could be playing who's drunk
[9:42] or maybe high you know they're under a
[9:45] certain
[9:46] substance
[9:47] which puts them under influence
[9:50] where they're not operating the way they
[9:53] would normally operate
[9:55] but it's the very thing that's
[9:56] controlling them
[9:58] that's bringing out who they really are
[10:01] so when you fall under an influence that
[10:04] influence literally takes over your
[10:07] being amen
[10:08] against your own will hallelujah you
[10:12] think about the average because you know
[10:13] i've i've known some people who maybe
[10:16] have gotten drunk and before they were
[10:18] drunk they'd walk up to people like hey
[10:20] kadry how you doing you just such a good
[10:22] person i'm telling my family members
[10:25] you know they'd be like hey i love you
[10:26] man you just you that you know you know
[10:29] i i certainly appreciate you but when
[10:31] they get under their influence
[10:34] you know all that love they have for me
[10:36] they'll walk up to me and say you know
[10:37] what you nice nasty
[10:40] you do it in a nice way but you're still
[10:42] nasty
[10:43] i know what you're saying is the truth
[10:45] but the way you say it you say it in a
[10:48] nice nasty kind of way you know what
[10:50] breaks that out it's the influence of
[10:52] the substance that they're partaking of
[10:55] in church if a
[10:57] natural uh
[10:59] influence of some substance can do that
[11:02] to a a natural being what about us as
[11:05] children of god
[11:07] what about the influence of god
[11:09] getting into our system
[11:11] what about the influence of god taking
[11:14] control of your mind when you can speak
[11:16] his thoughts what about the influence of
[11:18] god taking control of your body well you
[11:21] can yield it to his will maybe you can
[11:24] walk on water hallelujah peter would
[11:26] have never been able to do that without
[11:28] the influence of god
[11:31] hallelujah
[11:33] so it's all right to be under the
[11:34] influence
[11:36] if it's the right kind of influence
[11:38] and what we're talking about tonight
[11:40] we're talking about the influence of the
[11:42] holy ghost holy that's what we want to
[11:45] be under amen
[11:47] but i kind of want to show you the
[11:48] parallel the parallel of the wicked
[11:50] influence versus the parallel of the
[11:53] godly influence
[11:54] in church um
[11:57] depending on which way you lean
[12:00] you look at the influence as being
[12:02] something that uh
[12:04] you would never want to do
[12:06] because the drunk person loves that
[12:08] influence but to you and i we're like
[12:10] man you got to be crazy
[12:12] and us as the christians we love the
[12:15] influence of the power of god
[12:17] but the unbeliever looks at us like we
[12:19] got be crazy hallelujah so the influence
[12:23] that you desire
[12:24] is the influence that you love
[12:26] hallelujah and the bible says whosoever
[12:29] you yield your members to that's whose
[12:32] servant you are hallelujah so if you
[12:34] yield yourself to a certain influence
[12:37] you become a servant to that thing
[12:40] you become a slave to that thing you are
[12:44] what that is hallelujah and if we let
[12:47] god
[12:49] influence us we become god hallelujah
[12:52] walking on this earth
[12:56] but let's look at the world let's look
[12:58] at the earth
[12:59] under the wrong influence and how god
[13:02] thought about it
[13:03] we look right here in the book of
[13:05] genesis and god said in the book of
[13:07] genesis
[13:08] he said to them and god saw that the
[13:10] wickedness of man was great in the earth
[13:14] in that every imagination of his heart
[13:17] my
[13:18] every imagination of the thoughts of his
[13:20] heart church
[13:22] he was under such an influence
[13:25] mankind that everything they thought
[13:28] about was evil
[13:30] but it didn't just rest in their mind
[13:33] it was who they were
[13:35] because the scripture says as a man
[13:37] thinketh in his heart so is he
[13:40] hallelujah
[13:41] so these different influences that they
[13:43] had back in the bible days in genesis
[13:46] god said i can't take it no more
[13:49] god said i'm tired of looking at
[13:52] them being under the influence of
[13:53] wickedness hallelujah it's not just in
[13:56] their mind but this is what my creation
[13:59] has become
[14:00] holy god looked at men and all the sin
[14:03] and all the different things that was
[14:05] taking place and god said i'm sick of
[14:08] these influences i'm going to destroy
[14:10] this influence
[14:13] but i what i want us to catch is
[14:16] if you're not influenced by god you're
[14:19] influenced by evil spirit
[14:21] hallelujah
[14:23] hallelujah
[14:24] and listen how god
[14:26] looked at those who were not influenced
[14:29] by him the bible says it grieved god to
[14:32] his heart that he even made man
[14:37] i don't want to be
[14:39] looked upon like that when it comes to
[14:41] the eyes of god
[14:43] i don't want to be under such an
[14:45] influence of what's going on in the
[14:47] world
[14:48] such an influence of of of of houses and
[14:51] cars and land and influences of men and
[14:54] women and influences of hollywood and
[14:57] influences of mega churches and
[14:59] influences of doctrines and all these
[15:02] things god looked at it and god said i
[15:05] hate i made you
[15:11] see god has feelings yes
[15:14] and he was looking at creation
[15:17] and the bible says everything everything
[15:20] he imagined
[15:22] it wasn't about heaven
[15:24] it was evil thoughts it was an influence
[15:27] that was turning them into something
[15:29] that god was not
[15:32] so what was happening god was looking at
[15:34] creation and god is looking at it and
[15:37] saying we don't relate
[15:41] god is saying i cannot relate to what
[15:43] i'm saying
[15:45] god is saying i did not create man to
[15:48] operate like this
[15:50] earlier so in order for me hallelujah to
[15:53] be who i am i have to destroy this
[16:00] you know a lot of times when i talk to
[16:01] young people i say do not ignore
[16:04] the pull of god
[16:07] because when you come to church and
[16:08] god's dealing with you and and it
[16:10] happens over and over and over again and
[16:13] you still don't surrender your life the
[16:15] only thing left for you after so many
[16:18] times of that is judgment that's
[16:20] right yes
[16:22] and people wonder why certain things
[16:24] happen in their life or certain things
[16:26] happen on their job and all these things
[16:28] because god gives warning at the warning
[16:30] and it normally starts with just a
[16:33] simple pull of correction
[16:35] god dealing with the conscience and the
[16:37] heart the imagination of man trying to
[16:40] influence them of his nature and his
[16:43] character but we ignore it
[16:47] and right here in genesis they ignored
[16:50] god because man didn't start off like
[16:52] that
[16:55] so we have to believe that god
[16:57] continually tried to deal with man and
[17:00] help man and get them back to the place
[17:03] that they left when they were called
[17:05] adam
[17:08] but adam fell under the influence of his
[17:10] wife
[17:12] and his wife fell on the influence of
[17:14] the serpent
[17:16] and the serpent fell under the influence
[17:18] of the devil
[17:23] and god looked at the whole pattern and
[17:26] he said i'm going to destroy it
[17:32] but in the midst of god
[17:35] making his choice
[17:37] to destroy man
[17:40] he couldn't deny
[17:42] who he was
[17:45] he was a savior
[17:47] so even though everything else was under
[17:50] an influence of evil here god stayed
[17:53] under the influence of who he was
[17:56] as a savior and he could not help be
[18:00] what he was
[18:02] he could not help but be
[18:04] the attribute that was inside of him
[18:07] which was a savior so he picked out a
[18:10] family hardly he picked out a man
[18:13] hallelujah who wasn't no better than
[18:15] anybody else but he said you know what
[18:18] i'm going to put you under the influence
[18:20] of grace
[18:22] whoa
[18:24] hallelujah when everybody else was in
[18:27] the world doing that thing god came to
[18:30] know in the bible says but noah found
[18:33] grace in the eyes of the lord everybody
[18:36] else their hearts were imagination was
[18:39] continually wicked and evil but then
[18:41] grace came to the house of noah
[18:45] now everybody's doing their own thing
[18:47] but noah's operating under a different
[18:50] influence
[19:03] but what seemed to look like grace
[19:07] almost felt like a problem
[19:11] because you think about the grace of god
[19:13] comes to the house of noah
[19:16] and he has to do something that man
[19:18] never did before
[19:23] he has to do things with his family
[19:26] that none of them were used to
[19:31] under
[19:32] the influence and direction
[19:34] of the word
[19:38] now what you understand is how important
[19:40] this is
[19:41] noah didn't have a bible
[19:44] noah didn't have a prophet
[19:47] noah didn't have scriptures and scrolls
[19:50] all know i had was a word from god
[19:57] whoa church
[19:59] church i want you to think about it a
[20:01] little bit deeper
[20:02] noah didn't even have any vindication
[20:06] he had to believe this word
[20:09] fall under the influence of this word
[20:11] strictly by faith
[20:14] he never saw rain before
[20:16] his family never saw ray before his
[20:18] friends never saw reign before now i
[20:21] wonder how can you be under the
[20:23] influence of god strictly by faith no
[20:26] matter what you've seen
[20:28] no matter what you've heard
[20:30] but you believe it's god's word talking
[20:32] to you and you're able to stand to that
[20:34] influence no matter what the world is
[20:37] doing
[20:38] because in the long run what looks like
[20:40] to everybody else as something crazy is
[20:43] really building a boat the grace of god
[20:52] but we look at what noah had to go
[20:54] through
[20:55] noah had a family holiday
[20:57] there were days hallelujah you can
[20:59] imagine let's just paraphrase
[21:01] let's just say
[21:03] jesse was no america
[21:05] hello
[21:07] and you know there were some days
[21:09] when noah hallelujah
[21:11] jesse couldn't go play with his son
[21:14] why because he had to stick with that
[21:16] influence
[21:17] he had to stay with what god had said to
[21:20] him strictly a word
[21:22] and you know there probably was days
[21:24] noah looked at his son and been like
[21:26] looked at his boys he had three of them
[21:27] be like man i want to play with them so
[21:29] bad so you know what he had to do he had
[21:31] to rightly divide his time hallelujah
[21:34] some days he'll go and play but then
[21:36] he'll tell the boys hey i got to get
[21:38] back to this boat see hallelujah he
[21:40] could be a father and still be under the
[21:43] right influence
[21:44] that's what's wrong with me and today
[21:46] hallelujah they're trying to be fathers
[21:49] but they're not under the right
[21:50] influence so they're turning into baby
[21:53] daddies why because of the influence of
[21:55] the world
[21:57] [Applause]
[22:01] but you look at it there were times
[22:03] hallelujah where he he couldn't spend as
[22:05] much time with his sons but he had to
[22:08] hallelujah he had to be under such of an
[22:11] influence
[22:12] that his life would influence his kids
[22:15] hurry to fall under the same men
[22:22] hurry up
[22:23] he had to be under such an influence and
[22:26] be happy about it
[22:29] how often do you see a sad drunk
[22:33] they like doing what they doing right
[22:38] they'll fall down and get back up and
[22:40] say give me some more
[22:43] and wake up the next day and brag about
[22:46] how much of the influence they was on
[22:49] even though they sick
[22:51] even though they might have a knot on
[22:52] their head from hitting the floor
[22:54] they'd be like whoa boy what a time we
[22:56] had last night
[22:58] why he's reflecting on being under that
[23:01] influence
[23:02] but we come to church and we have
[23:04] powerful services and never tell anybody
[23:07] about it
[23:09] we come to church and god talk directly
[23:11] to us
[23:13] and we go home silent we go to work
[23:15] silent we're in the store silent we're
[23:18] not causing what kind of influence are
[23:20] you undead
[23:24] noah holly
[23:26] he had to be under influence hallelujah
[23:29] where that influence would silently
[23:32] deal with his whole family
[23:34] by him just being faithful to the
[23:36] influence he's um
[23:42] that's why the bible says raise up a
[23:45] child in the way that they should go and
[23:47] when they get older it won't depart why
[23:49] because as you're raising them up
[23:51] there's an influence sitting in their
[23:54] lives
[24:04] let's catch it
[24:06] before i go on
[24:08] i want to give you
[24:11] a little bit of the
[24:13] definition of influence
[24:16] influence the capacity
[24:20] to have an effect on the character
[24:26] see there are things in our life
[24:28] that's having an effect on our character
[24:31] honey there are people all over the
[24:33] world who can't get enough of instagram
[24:36] and you know what it's doing is having a
[24:38] influence on their character
[24:40] they don't they don't they don't even
[24:42] know why they be in the house making
[24:44] little videos and little dances and
[24:46] doing all this stuff what is it it's the
[24:48] influence of id
[24:52] they don't know why they doing all your
[24:53] little skits and and all this little
[24:55] stuff and posing in the mirror it's the
[24:57] influence of tank top
[25:08] hey look i ain't got no problem with a
[25:10] little fun
[25:12] but when that thing influences you more
[25:14] than
[25:15] the influence of god
[25:18] is turning you into something huh
[25:22] hallelujah
[25:23] amen and then then they start calling
[25:25] themselves
[25:27] you got women now who would once just
[25:30] look at look at tick-tock or look at
[25:33] instagram and then they got this little
[25:35] thing this little thumb on that hug
[25:38] they got this thumb on there called like
[25:41] amen and they got another thumb on there
[25:43] that says dislike
[25:45] and no matter which one you get the most
[25:47] will influence what you do the next time
[25:50] you put a pitch up there
[25:52] and now you got girls hallelujah they're
[25:55] putting hallelujah pictures up there for
[25:57] the thumbs up why because the thumbs up
[26:00] is influencing them hallelujah and they
[26:02] begin to dress a certain way then their
[26:05] name changes hallelujah their name may
[26:08] be susan or something like that but now
[26:10] susan identifies as an ig model
[26:15] i'm sorry brother
[26:20] what is it doing
[26:21] it's developing a certain kind of
[26:23] character
[26:25] it's turning that person into something
[26:29] what about us we come and we hear the
[26:31] word of god every week hallelujah
[26:34] faithfully hearing preachers preach
[26:36] faithfully reading our bibles faithfully
[26:38] studying this message what should it do
[26:41] it should influence our character
[26:46] it should be turning us into something
[26:49] what is it not an ig model no it's
[26:52] turning us into the word man flesh
[26:58] that's what it's doing
[27:01] hallelujah
[27:02] think about your influences in your life
[27:05] holy look
[27:07] if your mother
[27:09] was a good homemaker
[27:11] her life would rub off on you
[27:13] if you appreciate who she was that's
[27:16] right yes
[27:18] but if you look at us all this woman did
[27:20] a fuss oh she did clean up this and do
[27:23] this and help me with my brothers and
[27:25] sisters and yeah
[27:26] i got six of them
[27:32] without realizing as a girl what that
[27:34] mom or her influence is doing she's
[27:37] trying to turn you into her
[27:44] what she's doing she's she's influencing
[27:47] you we're talking about a christian
[27:49] woman now her influence is giving out
[27:52] virtue hallelujah and then as she's
[27:54] giving out virtue that virtue is rubbing
[27:57] off on you holly and you are
[28:00] subliminally becoming what you're seeing
[28:08] just like a young man who's close to his
[28:11] dad his dad would teach him his trains
[28:13] but now in our days the boys don't want
[28:16] to follow up with their dads
[28:21] yes sir
[28:22] i'd give it all if if
[28:25] you come out in the work field if i had
[28:27] a dad who was a carpenter or a plumber
[28:29] or whatever he was and if he could teach
[28:32] me that trade you know i'd be up under
[28:34] i'd be up from like a little sad puppy
[28:36] which one what you want me to do that
[28:38] what you want me to do
[28:40] because if i seen that trade take care
[28:44] of me and my family hallelujah it'll do
[28:47] the same thing when i step out on my own
[28:52] hallelujah
[28:54] if we're seeing the influences of god
[28:57] develop christian people who have
[28:59] powerful lives it'll still do the same
[29:01] thing today
[29:03] if the influence hallelujah if the
[29:06] influence of god gave us a peter
[29:08] hallelujah it'll still do it today if
[29:11] the influence of god gave us an esther
[29:13] he'll still do it today and the
[29:15] influence of god gave us a power
[29:18] it'll skip it today if the influence of
[29:20] god gave us a roof it'll still do it
[29:23] today
[29:26] why because the words don't change
[29:34] listen
[29:36] as long as noah stayed with it the grace
[29:39] had to stay there on his family
[29:43] and the world got more and more regular
[29:46] and noah received more and more
[29:53] why grace once god
[29:55] begins to unleash his influence
[29:59] and you catch it he can't take it back
[30:01] that's right
[30:03] hallelujah
[30:04] we may deal with this the weekend
[30:07] but if god ever does something in your
[30:09] life
[30:10] holy
[30:11] you need to put that hallelujah in your
[30:12] secret place
[30:15] especially if it came to pass or
[30:17] did something righteous and faithful in
[30:20] your life hallelujah that
[30:22] that he can't deny and that you can't
[30:24] deny that it was god
[30:27] if you keep that hallelujah all you have
[30:29] to do is keep reminding god of what he
[30:32] did
[30:36] [Applause]
[30:38] because god could never say oh i didn't
[30:40] mean to do that
[30:44] he can't do that
[30:46] if he did it he meant to do it
[30:52] don't get nervous i'm gonna be too low
[30:53] i'm about to close
[30:59] let's look at noah
[31:01] now you know he had to
[31:03] stay with that influence of god
[31:06] and everybody looking at noah out there
[31:08] cutting down trees and
[31:10] pouring sap and beating beating stop out
[31:12] of you doing all this stuff and they
[31:14] looking at him like man this man crazy
[31:16] you know what they couldn't recognize
[31:18] grace
[31:21] the hot days he was out in the sun
[31:24] sweating and beating and doing and
[31:26] cutting and doing all this stuff they
[31:27] looking at like man come on no let's go
[31:29] party they couldn't understand what they
[31:32] were looking at was grace
[31:37] and maybe his boys maybe his boys i'm
[31:40] gonna break it up the holiday maybe his
[31:41] boys wanted to go to an aau tournament
[31:44] and noah's like hey boys i can't go we
[31:46] can't go we need to continue to work on
[31:49] this ark
[31:51] we need to continue to work on this all
[31:53] maybe another time hallelujah and maybe
[31:56] noah hallelujah he had to split his time
[31:58] up real wisely you know he had a wife
[32:00] also hallelujah and maybe his wife came
[32:03] to him and said honey you forgetting
[32:05] about date night he said honey i got to
[32:07] stay with this grace
[32:10] we gonna have a date night but right now
[32:12] i got the stairs in his influence
[32:15] see noah got to a place to where he
[32:17] could go take care of his family but he
[32:20] come right back under the influence
[32:23] and that's where god wants to be because
[32:25] brother branham hallelujah the prophet
[32:26] he said he said hey plan like it's
[32:30] another 50 years
[32:32] but he said live like god come in
[32:34] tomorrow or right now amen
[32:38] so church you got to know how to stay
[32:40] under that influence and you think about
[32:42] it now god only spoke that word of grace
[32:45] to noah
[32:47] he didn't speak it to his children he
[32:49] didn't speak it to his wife
[32:51] so noah's influence had to be so strong
[32:54] that his family could see man this man
[32:56] on another level
[32:59] i don't know what it is but he's so
[33:02] dedicated to this thing but look
[33:04] hollywood when you're under the
[33:05] influence that you love hallelujah it
[33:08] projects that to who's watching you
[33:12] hold up everybody else look at that
[33:15] noise like he's crazy building a boat
[33:17] but his family is looking at him saying
[33:19] god there's something different about
[33:21] daddy
[33:22] oh hallelujah noah's wife is looking at
[33:25] him saying there's something different
[33:26] about noah he's building this boat
[33:28] there's something about this boat the
[33:30] influence of his boat he's turned him
[33:32] into another man so noah's wife she got
[33:34] to the point saying honey don't worry
[33:36] about date night date night gonna be at
[33:38] the boat
[33:44] but jesse i could see her cook up a meal
[33:46] and get everything together and say
[33:48] honey we gonna have date night on the
[33:50] boat we're gonna send a blanket out on
[33:52] the boat we will have a little fun right
[33:53] here on the boat hallelujah and after we
[33:55] eat after we peek nick we're gonna move
[33:58] almost out of the way and we're gonna
[33:59] get right back under the influence
[34:02] [Applause]
[34:10] but that influence
[34:13] had to be so strong
[34:16] that his whole family
[34:19] his whole family would
[34:20] subliminally come under that same
[34:22] influence
[34:24] because they could see a man of god they
[34:27] could see a man who had a word from god
[34:30] but he loved what he was doing
[34:36] see that's the difference hallelujah
[34:38] about being a
[34:40] a born again christian and just somebody
[34:42] going to church
[34:45] because you're somebody going to church
[34:47] holy cobra started and they ain't been
[34:49] back since
[34:53] because now
[34:55] they're under the influence of covet
[34:58] and they don't even realize hollywood
[35:00] church to a certain extent we were under
[35:03] the same influence hallelujah
[35:05] but but the thing of it is is holy
[35:08] what's the root of who you are
[35:10] hey man what's the root of who you are
[35:12] you know what they said you said
[35:13] brothers i was never under the influence
[35:14] yes she was at one point of our life all
[35:17] of us had the way mass to go around
[35:20] what was that you were under the
[35:22] influence of copenhagen 19.
[35:30] sir look if that would have never
[35:31] happened we would have never been
[35:32] walking around with no mask on
[35:35] right
[35:36] i was i was i was at my um my daughter's
[35:38] school
[35:39] on a mask
[35:41] a hat and all this stuff
[35:43] i said you know what
[35:44] five years ago they would have never let
[35:46] me in the bank like this
[35:49] as soon as i walk in they'll hit the
[35:50] button
[35:52] they try to rob us
[35:54] but now i go in with a hat with a mask
[35:58] and they'll give me money
[36:04] you see hallelujah the wisdom of man is
[36:07] foolishness to god
[36:15] they're showing really how smart they
[36:17] are
[36:19] oh my
[36:21] but at one point of time we were all
[36:22] under that influence but how many of us
[36:25] couldn't wait till the regulations
[36:27] change
[36:30] see i'm one of those people see this is
[36:32] how you know you got another influence
[36:34] upon you and your influence should be
[36:36] isaiah 53 hallelujah
[36:38] your influence should be mark 16
[36:40] hallelujah
[36:42] amen
[36:43] that should be your influence hallelujah
[36:45] church hallelujah i never fully adapted
[36:48] to the influence of covey because i'd
[36:50] get out of my car and walk all the way
[36:52] up to the door and see the sign you got
[36:54] to have a man
[36:57] now i got to go back to my car and get a
[36:59] mass why because i'm not under that
[37:02] influence
[37:04] whoa
[37:06] jesus christ is my safety
[37:09] jesus christ is my protection
[37:13] jesus christ is my coverage
[37:17] [Music]
[37:24] now i render to seasons what is seasons
[37:27] hell yeah
[37:29] but the restrictions and and regulations
[37:31] of of of covet is not who i am
[37:37] i'm under another influence
[37:42] holy
[37:43] oh my church
[37:45] manoa
[37:47] for 120 years
[37:50] stayed under the influence
[37:53] when all he had was a word
[37:57] he had no dreams
[37:59] he had no urine thumb and visitation
[38:03] come on now
[38:04] hallelujah
[38:06] he had no vision
[38:08] all he had is instruction from god
[38:12] and he didn't even know what he was
[38:13] building
[38:18] but all of it came from god
[38:21] and all he had to do is stay faithful to
[38:24] what he heard
[38:26] holy curse that's all we got to do
[38:30] stay faithful to what you're hearing
[38:32] amen
[38:34] and the grace of god will follow you
[38:36] through the rest of your life
[38:40] hallelujah
[38:43] under the
[38:44] influence
[38:46] it says
[38:47] the capacity
[38:49] to have an effect on the character
[38:52] development hallelujah
[38:55] or behavior of someone or something or
[38:58] the effect hallelujah
[39:00] or the effect itself harley see so the
[39:03] influence of a certain thing
[39:05] it has a natural effect over you
[39:10] that's why i'm glad to be able to say
[39:12] i'm a christian
[39:15] because everything that comes with being
[39:17] a christian
[39:19] has a
[39:20] effect on me
[39:22] [Applause]
[39:24] it deals with the it deals with the
[39:26] character development of who i am
[39:34] that's why god sent the vindicated
[39:37] prophet here
[39:39] so that prophet and the word that god
[39:41] was giving that prophet can have an
[39:44] influence on our lives
[39:45] that we will no longer be influenced by
[39:48] baptist doctrine influenced by methodist
[39:51] doctrine influenced by the pentecostals
[39:54] or if ruined by the catholic church but
[39:56] now we're influenced by dust share the
[39:59] law
[40:08] that's what we're influenced by we're
[40:10] not influenced by creeds and dogmas
[40:12] we're not influenced by the thoughts of
[40:14] man because the prophet gets his
[40:17] straight from god
[40:21] we're influenced by the changing of
[40:23] hands from the mighty angel to the
[40:26] seventh angel
[40:38] listen before i close listen lord the
[40:41] prophet of god say
[40:43] people want to do right
[40:45] he said i'm going to read you something
[40:46] right quick
[40:48] he says but you notice the woman in our
[40:50] day
[40:51] they don't seem to have that lady like
[40:53] they once had
[40:55] they're just like hallelujah
[40:58] they want they they they're just like
[41:00] they want to
[41:01] you know my mama would tell me my mom
[41:03] was in her 70s by the grace of god god's
[41:05] been good to her
[41:07] she used to tell me holly
[41:09] if you went to school without a dress on
[41:12] they send you back home
[41:18] you say really brother diggs yeah you
[41:20] know why because back then hardly
[41:23] america was still being influenced off
[41:26] of christianity
[41:29] you still had hallelujah some of the
[41:32] leadership of christ in the schools
[41:38] hallelujah
[41:39] but once they started taking prayer
[41:41] different influences came in
[41:43] harley
[41:45] and now they dress and do whatever they
[41:47] want to do and and nobody says anything
[41:49] about it
[41:51] but being under those kind of influences
[41:53] mankind was still hallelujah had a
[41:57] contact with god
[41:59] but as they fell under the influence
[42:00] influences world
[42:02] of the world and the minds of theology
[42:05] and the minds of who they thought were
[42:07] great people
[42:08] all
[42:09] all of their character and all of their
[42:12] convictions
[42:14] all of their godly convictions begin to
[42:17] leave them amen
[42:19] and now they're being influenced by
[42:22] their desire
[42:24] [Music]
[42:29] simple desire
[42:30] just to be liked
[42:34] oh my god
[42:35] all right
[42:36] listen he says
[42:38] they're they they're just like they want
[42:40] to he says but there's something
[42:43] won't let them do it
[42:45] it seems like there's hallelujah a
[42:47] heaviness
[42:48] hallelujah he said that you tell a lady
[42:51] that she shouldn't she shouldn't do such
[42:54] a thing
[42:55] and the lady looks upon that and
[42:57] believes that my
[42:59] brother jesse there are people you
[43:00] witness to women maybe you've you've
[43:03] witnessed too and they believe what you
[43:05] said but there's a heaviness hallelujah
[43:08] in the world holy there's a spirit
[43:11] hallelujah that walks among the land
[43:14] that won't let them give into it
[43:18] what is it it's a influence
[43:27] he said they believed that he said she
[43:30] wants to believe that but there's
[43:32] something that presses her hallelujah
[43:34] the other way
[43:36] and i want you to understand without god
[43:39] in your life there'll be a spirit
[43:41] that'll press you the other way
[43:44] the prophet god said the only thing that
[43:46] stopped him from getting the holy ghost
[43:48] when he was 12 years old was a spirit
[43:55] you mean to tell me god wants to give a
[43:56] 12 year old the holy ghost yes he does
[44:00] [Applause]
[44:07] more than a 12 year old eight-year-old
[44:12] man
[44:15] how about born in a womb with it like
[44:16] john the baptist
[44:21] oh
[44:23] whatever excuse they come up with
[44:25] god has a word for it
[44:28] he says see
[44:30] poor thing
[44:31] i feel sorry for her
[44:33] she's so caught in such a web of
[44:36] hollywood she doesn't even realize that
[44:38] is hollywood the influences of the world
[44:41] that's stopping her from doing what she
[44:44] really wants to do
[44:48] being a friend of mine was talking today
[44:50] i was coming up the road
[44:51] and we were talking about
[44:53] how people do stuff that just don't seem
[44:56] right
[44:57] and you know i say bro
[44:59] you know we kind of got to have
[45:00] compassion on them because the problem
[45:02] of god said they're not in their right
[45:04] mind
[45:05] hello
[45:06] you take a woman who's married and she
[45:08] goes running the streets and her husband
[45:10] fussing and fighting and all that if she
[45:12] was in her right mind she won't peace
[45:14] she won't peace in her home
[45:16] she's in her right mind she'd want her
[45:19] daughters to be raised up virtuous
[45:21] hardly
[45:22] if she was in her right mind she'd do
[45:24] everything she could do to protect them
[45:26] and protect their minds
[45:29] so you kind of you you kind of got to
[45:31] feel sorry for them because they're
[45:33] operating under another influence
[45:37] that's why when a person is under that
[45:39] influence they can't drive straight
[45:42] they swerving all over the world they in
[45:45] the seat hallelujah but they've lost the
[45:47] capacity to operate the right way
[45:52] and that's what happens to mankind when
[45:54] they fall under the wrong influence
[45:56] hallelujah they could be in the vehicle
[45:58] hallelujah but they love their sense of
[46:01] direction
[46:08] and the only thing left
[46:10] is an accident
[46:14] unless
[46:15] you get stopped by the patrol car
[46:19] [Applause]
[46:22] and so are we
[46:24] headed for an accident
[46:27] [Applause]
[46:33] but that six foot two hundred pound
[46:35] angel hallelujah
[46:37] came and got in the way
[46:40] some of us had to get arrested
[46:42] [Music]
[46:45] the ticket wasn't good enough because we
[46:47] was hard-headed some of us had to go to
[46:50] jail
[46:52] hallelujah but didn't we got the deal
[46:55] hung up we experienced more grace
[46:58] because the judge and the jury was on
[47:01] our side
[47:05] and just that grace made us give up
[47:08] and say i never want to come back to
[47:10] this place again
[47:16] hurry up
[47:18] thank you for your grace slow
[47:25] oh my god
[47:27] he said they're caught in such a web of
[47:29] hollywood in the advertisement of
[47:30] television radio newspaper harley
[47:34] on the street let's see what we have to
[47:36] do is bring it to our day he says
[47:39] television radio newspaper holly those
[47:42] things are not operating so much in our
[47:44] homes
[47:46] in our homes it's not it's not
[47:48] television newspaper radio
[47:50] it's apple sampson
[47:55] apple galaxy
[47:58] macbook and all the stuff and
[48:00] playstation
[48:02] all these different avenues to get your
[48:05] attention
[48:06] all these different avenues to put you
[48:08] under influence
[48:11] you know look i ain't got a problem with
[48:13] if your child play games it's just the
[48:15] kind of games they play that's right
[48:18] because you know some of these games
[48:19] they got you know they had a game called
[48:21] something robbery i can't
[48:23] i can't think of the name of it
[48:25] grand theft auto
[48:29] playing a game
[48:31] and teaching the kids how to rob
[48:34] but it goes deeper than that
[48:36] because not only is it teaching how to
[48:38] rob it has
[48:40] cursing on it
[48:42] it's playing rap music
[48:45] all of these different doors are being
[48:48] opened up because you're letting your
[48:50] child be entertained by something else
[48:53] you're letting your child hallelujah
[48:55] just have a little fun not even
[48:57] realizing there are other influences
[49:01] dropping in there
[49:05] you say brothers how you know this
[49:07] because one day when my son was small
[49:11] his uncle gave him
[49:13] the playstation thing cause i would
[49:14] never be
[49:15] a big gang guy
[49:17] you know i it just didn't matter to me
[49:20] we had a 326 when i was young and after
[49:22] that broke that was it
[49:24] my mama wasn't buying that nest that's
[49:26] just the way it was
[49:27] but now these things falling 500
[49:31] easy
[49:32] you know what i mean but anyway
[49:34] you know one day my son was playing he
[49:36] was playing uh uh
[49:38] nba i forget what you call the game
[49:41] but he was he was playing that
[49:44] and i walked in there he playing the
[49:46] game playing the game
[49:47] and i heard the song
[49:49] we're playing basketball
[49:54] we love that bat skit
[50:03] i'm watching playing the game
[50:05] but something else got my attention
[50:08] we're playing basketball
[50:12] while he was playing
[50:14] they were playing an old rap song
[50:16] that i grew up on
[50:21] now he has never heard that song before
[50:24] he's more interested in the game
[50:27] but at the same time what the devil is
[50:28] doing he's blending the world
[50:34] he's blending the spirits that fought me
[50:36] hallelujah and now bringing him up to
[50:38] his day and the same things i had to
[50:41] fight now he's fighting it too
[50:44] i'll buy a video game
[50:51] so i say hey you hear that music she
[50:53] said yeah
[50:54] they said they taught my basketball
[50:56] i said you guys you have to take that
[50:58] game throw that and trash
[51:00] you're like bones girl daddy okay daddy
[51:02] you can't don't please that is all dead
[51:05] you can't
[51:09] i say look here the only way you gonna
[51:11] play that is it's that music he said no
[51:13] he said don't worry about daddy i can go
[51:15] in here and i can cut all the music out
[51:19] i said well you better get to doing it
[51:21] because you don't it's going to be in
[51:23] the trash
[51:27] and he went in he and see this is the
[51:30] thing
[51:30] i didn't know how to do it
[51:36] see that's how sleek the devil is
[51:39] but jesse holly he has things hallelujah
[51:42] in our lives that me and you we know
[51:44] about we know how to get to connect and
[51:46] control and then there are things that
[51:48] your kids are far more advanced on
[51:51] yeah
[51:52] you know what they're saying now if you
[51:53] got a you got a um any kind of
[51:55] electronic or something you can't get to
[51:56] they say give it to your child
[51:59] they'll figure it out
[52:05] so you know what in that's that same
[52:07] frame of mind
[52:09] i don't want to hear you come back to me
[52:10] to my school hall
[52:14] math hard
[52:15] science hard i just can't do chemistry
[52:19] but you can figure that game out doing
[52:21] it you can figure that phone out
[52:24] you know how to get these accounts
[52:25] together
[52:26] you know how to put all these messages
[52:28] together and put videos and do uh you
[52:30] can do all that you can do that you can
[52:33] do biology
[52:37] you can do that you can do algebra and
[52:39] calculus
[52:44] don't give me that school too hard stuff
[52:46] and they figure that stuff out with no
[52:48] instructions
[52:52] they just figure it out
[52:55] right
[52:56] i'm sorry y'all
[52:59] listen
[53:01] he says it seems
[53:03] he says hollywood advertiser tv radio
[53:06] newspaper streets in the store he's
[53:08] saying it seems to be that there is
[53:10] something that they
[53:12] just can't pull away from
[53:14] he said our young people hallelujah our
[53:17] old people our middle aged people he
[53:20] said and he said there seems to be
[53:22] something among men man don't seem to be
[53:26] hallelujah have that masculine touch
[53:29] that he used to have hardly
[53:32] now they're saying if a boy say
[53:34] hallelujah he can be eight years old
[53:36] five years six years old and he can come
[53:38] to his parents and say i think i'm a
[53:40] girl and they say
[53:43] holy let's handle this delicately
[53:49] try please
[53:51] my day you know what i do i grab my son
[53:54] hallelujah put him in the mirror and i
[53:56] said what you see
[53:58] you see a boy yeah yes sir i say that's
[54:01] what you are
[54:03] you are a boy
[54:10] the world has fallen under the influence
[54:13] of weak-minded parents
[54:17] listening to hollywood
[54:20] your children weren't created to be drag
[54:22] queens
[54:25] and chinese and all that's tough and
[54:27] they'll be the first ones to say they
[54:29] believe in god how can you believe in
[54:32] god and look at your life and say he
[54:34] made a mistake
[54:36] god don't make no mistakes
[54:43] so if you say hallelujah that you were
[54:46] created wrong and you say you believe in
[54:48] god i'll tell you you don't believe in
[54:50] god
[54:52] because if you were born hallelujah a
[54:54] certain way that was what god intended
[54:56] you to be
[54:58] everything else
[55:00] is just the influences of the mind
[55:03] [Applause]
[55:08] whoa the influences of hollywood yes sir
[55:11] y'all notice how they'll take these big
[55:12] stars and it'll happen with one of their
[55:15] children and they'll promote it all over
[55:17] the world
[55:18] y'all may not even remember this but
[55:20] remember years and years ago one of the
[55:22] biggest stars was a sports guy named
[55:24] magic johnson
[55:26] and he was one of the first ones who
[55:28] went public he went public with two
[55:30] things that they tried to make all right
[55:31] he got he had hiv hallelujah and they
[55:34] tried to make it all right
[55:36] it's all right you can't survive it you
[55:38] can't survive it and you know what else
[55:39] his oldest child is a homosexual
[55:45] yes sir
[55:47] junior is a homosexual and he's been a
[55:50] homosexual for years
[55:52] holly and look at it the spirit has come
[55:54] back around hallelujah is on the way now
[56:02] true
[56:06] it's influence right right
[56:10] people are afraid to call right right
[56:12] wrong
[56:15] you can't serve god unless you have that
[56:17] mindset
[56:19] [Applause]
[56:21] because god don't have no maybe ground
[56:25] he don't have no middle ground remember
[56:28] there was somebody who fell under the
[56:29] wrong influence and he came to god with
[56:31] a maybe oh i thought you said
[56:34] god told samuel he said go down there to
[56:36] the amla kites and kill everybody
[56:39] he said kill mama baby suckling goat
[56:41] horse dog everything kill every man
[56:44] sheep kill it all
[56:47] yes sir
[56:48] saul went down and said okay god i hear
[56:50] you went down there everything that he
[56:52] thought was pretty he saved
[56:54] he saved so all and then he tried to
[56:56] reason with himself what was happening
[56:58] he was under the wrong influence
[57:01] and before that he had this spoken tons
[57:04] and prophesied
[57:08] that's why you need a born-again
[57:10] experience
[57:14] the holy ghost is the only thing that's
[57:17] going to keep you under the right
[57:19] influence
[57:23] because you will find a reason not to do
[57:26] what god's saying
[57:28] and then try to justify it
[57:30] and he's trying to get all smart with
[57:32] god well we're gonna we're gonna
[57:33] sacrifice these beautiful sheep to god
[57:36] we're gonna sacrifice these ghosts to
[57:37] god and this and that but god said go
[57:39] ahead and kill everything and in the
[57:41] middle in the middle of him looking at
[57:43] all of us that he thought was pretty and
[57:45] he gonna sacrifice he left the king
[57:47] alive
[57:50] the very one who started them the kites
[57:54] you see how blinding you get when you
[57:57] follow your influences
[57:58] [Music]
[58:02] oh my
[58:03] church
[58:05] but he comes and he said oh it was the
[58:07] people
[58:09] it was the people they said there's no
[58:11] man you the king
[58:13] the people do what you say
[58:17] you can't lie to god
[58:20] you can't say i ain't come to church
[58:21] because bro jesse he too hard no you can
[58:24] come to church because you don't want to
[58:30] like my practice they doing the cover he
[58:31] said hey he said uh we got it uh
[58:34] streaming for you and we got it at the
[58:36] church i ain't shut the church i ain't
[58:38] shut the church down he said unless they
[58:40] come in and tell me i got to close
[58:41] though he said but other than that we're
[58:43] gonna keep the church over if you don't
[58:44] wanna come we're gonna have it up here
[58:46] but he said go as you land
[58:49] he let that go on for a while he let it
[58:51] go on for a while and then he dropped
[58:53] the bomb on everybody he said y'all
[58:55] notice i said go as you land cause if i
[58:57] would have told you go as godly you'll
[58:59] be in church
[59:02] [Applause]
[59:08] he said that's why i said go as you led
[59:10] because if we go as god leaders we will
[59:13] be in church because the scripture says
[59:15] as we see the damn prank
[59:16] [Music]
[59:30] touch
[59:34] he said you take a man today man don't
[59:36] seem to be birdie like it used to be
[59:39] it's all sort you say they want to wear
[59:42] suede shoes and purple and act like a
[59:44] woman
[59:45] you know what they can do all that
[59:47] but if you're a man
[59:49] he's still gonna have to heal if he a
[59:50] big man he's still gonna have a size 14
[59:52] foot
[59:55] there ain't nothing he can do about that
[59:57] he can't chop that off and make that
[59:58] petite can't do it
[1:00:01] can't get no foot surgery to make his
[1:00:02] feet small
[1:00:04] no
[1:00:05] you know why because he was born like
[1:00:07] that
[1:00:10] let me leave that alone
[1:00:12] let me close it let me close with joshua
[1:00:15] listen
[1:00:16] i want to show you how important it is
[1:00:18] when you really
[1:00:20] fall under the right influence
[1:00:23] listen
[1:00:23] listen to the word
[1:00:25] god gave joshua
[1:00:27] first of all he told me he said moses my
[1:00:29] servant is dead
[1:00:31] he said moses my servant is dead now
[1:00:34] therefore arise joshua chapter one he
[1:00:36] said now therefore arise go over this
[1:00:38] jordan thou and all the people unto the
[1:00:42] land which i do give to them
[1:00:46] not land that i shall give you
[1:00:48] land that i do
[1:00:50] give to them
[1:00:52] god is saying the land is already yours
[1:00:55] all you got to do is stay under the
[1:00:57] influence of moses
[1:01:03] hallelujah but now you watch him he
[1:01:05] gonna talk about moses and then he gonna
[1:01:07] say forget about moses
[1:01:09] and you stay under this influence he
[1:01:11] said moses my servant is dead now he
[1:01:13] dropped down in verse three now he's
[1:01:15] talking personally to joshua he says
[1:01:17] every place that the soul of your foot
[1:01:20] shall tread upon that have i given unto
[1:01:23] you
[1:01:24] as i said unto moses now god now he's
[1:01:28] telling joshua the same promise i gave
[1:01:30] moses i give unto you
[1:01:33] i want you to be under the same
[1:01:36] influence hallelujah
[1:01:38] he told joshua nothing oh my hallelujah
[1:01:42] listen listen church we drop down to
[1:01:44] verse five he says
[1:01:46] he says
[1:01:47] there shall not any man be able to stand
[1:01:51] before thee all the days of that life
[1:01:58] as long as you stay under this influence
[1:02:01] you will never be defeated
[1:02:10] listen
[1:02:11] again
[1:02:13] he's not living by a bible
[1:02:17] he's not living by strolls
[1:02:19] all he got is a word from god amen
[1:02:24] he don't have no vision no dream on that
[1:02:26] all he got is a word from god and god
[1:02:29] telling him
[1:02:30] go take the land
[1:02:32] just stay under all he got to do is stay
[1:02:35] under the influence of what god's saying
[1:02:40] listen this is what joshua did every
[1:02:42] battle he went through he probably
[1:02:44] recited this there shall no man
[1:02:48] be able to stand before me
[1:02:51] all the days of my life
[1:02:54] and then you go into the battle
[1:02:59] destroy everybody
[1:03:02] didn't go to the canaanites and it'd be
[1:03:05] thousands of them and he said god said
[1:03:07] there should not be any man able to
[1:03:09] stand before me all the days of my
[1:03:14] life
[1:03:15] go take the land hallelujah
[1:03:18] did he go to the jebusites and he said
[1:03:21] there should not be any man able to stay
[1:03:23] ah
[1:03:25] church and after so many times of that
[1:03:29] joshua's church
[1:03:30] they know that by heart hallelujah and
[1:03:33] they're saying it's not just joshua
[1:03:35] they're saying it as a congregation now
[1:03:38] there should no man be able to stand
[1:03:40] before us
[1:03:41] all the days of our
[1:03:54] now everybody's
[1:03:56] under the same influence
[1:03:58] everybody's under the influence of what
[1:04:01] god told one man
[1:04:05] church shouldn't we be under the same
[1:04:08] influence when god told a man hallelujah
[1:04:11] if you be sincere not even cancer i'll
[1:04:14] be able to stand before you amen
[1:04:20] hallelujah
[1:04:22] oh my
[1:04:23] church he was under such an influence
[1:04:27] that they wouldn't fall ai
[1:04:29] and they lost the battle
[1:04:30] yes joshua came back
[1:04:33] he said hold up
[1:04:35] gather everybody up hold up
[1:04:37] and he's standing off to the side saying
[1:04:38] that lord you said there should no man
[1:04:42] see how you say that thing there should
[1:04:44] no man be able to stand before me
[1:04:46] all the days of my life
[1:04:48] right so now he over there he thinking
[1:04:51] he said
[1:04:52] i ain't got nobody losing
[1:04:54] something wrong
[1:04:56] somebody under the wrong influence
[1:04:59] because i ain't supposed to lose no
[1:05:01] battle see joshua wasn't used to losing
[1:05:04] he was used to win
[1:05:06] so when he lost he knew that somebody
[1:05:08] was under another influence
[1:05:10] so he gathered everybody up he said hey
[1:05:13] y'all i ain't supposed to lose a battle
[1:05:15] so somebody did wrong and found out
[1:05:18] aiken has stolen some babylonians
[1:05:19] comments however so joshua killed him
[1:05:22] his wife his family his cousins his
[1:05:25] brother joshua killed everything joshua
[1:05:28] got that influence at the church
[1:05:34] don't be mad when people don't come back
[1:05:36] let them influences go
[1:05:45] we got a promise we operate under
[1:05:50] didn't god tell you akron is yours
[1:05:56] don't worry about where they go
[1:06:01] josh would say hey something wrong i
[1:06:03] ain't supposed to lose and after he
[1:06:05] killed egg in his whole family he went
[1:06:07] back and fought the same person he lost
[1:06:09] to
[1:06:14] because god promised had to be true
[1:06:18] so he went back
[1:06:19] after he got everybody back under the
[1:06:21] same influence again and won the battle
[1:06:29] joshua was under such an influence of
[1:06:31] that yes
[1:06:33] one day he was praying
[1:06:36] and somebody stood before him glistening
[1:06:39] looking all mighty and powerful
[1:06:42] all joshua could think about is
[1:06:44] there shall no man
[1:06:46] be able to stand before you
[1:06:49] and the bible says
[1:06:50] joshua put his head on his shoulder and
[1:06:54] joshua's talking to an angel and joshua
[1:06:56] said are you foolish or against us
[1:07:02] he was still under the influence
[1:07:06] it didn't matter who it was
[1:07:09] amen
[1:07:10] that's what paul said if an angel come
[1:07:13] and say anything giving it what i say
[1:07:15] let him be a curse
[1:07:18] [Applause]
[1:07:21] and the woman came up to brother branham
[1:07:23] and she said brother brother if you say
[1:07:24] it like this if you say the angel of the
[1:07:26] lord told you to do it this way she said
[1:07:29] he said if the angel don't say what
[1:07:31] god's word say he say i ain't saying it
[1:07:37] hallelujah
[1:07:40] sorry that's what it means to be under
[1:07:41] the influence
[1:07:44] joshua's standing in front of the
[1:07:46] captain of the host of the lord
[1:07:48] but to joshua he's looking like somebody
[1:07:50] i just got to fight today
[1:07:54] because i don't know who you are
[1:07:57] but i got a word that says
[1:08:00] i got a word that says
[1:08:02] come on y'all read it with me i got a
[1:08:03] word that says
[1:08:05] there shall no man be able to stand
[1:08:08] before thee all the days of thy life
[1:08:20] [Music]
[1:08:22] come on musicians
[1:08:25] and that same influence
[1:08:27] brought the jericho walls down
[1:08:30] that same influence
[1:08:32] said rahab and her house free
[1:08:36] that same influence hallelujah had caleb
[1:08:40] said god didn't say that to caleb he
[1:08:42] said to joshua but caleb was under
[1:08:45] search of the same influence caleb said
[1:08:48] i was 20 years old i'm 40 years old when
[1:08:51] you dealt with me honey he said now
[1:08:53] these 40 plus years now i'm more
[1:08:56] stronger now than i was back then
[1:08:59] he's 80 years old and he's still under
[1:09:02] the same influence
[1:09:14] the messenger has been gone 50 plus
[1:09:17] years
[1:09:18] but we're still under the same influence
[1:09:21] [Applause]
[1:09:24] not the influence of a man but the
[1:09:26] influence of ghosts and the law
[1:09:34] church let's stay under the influence
