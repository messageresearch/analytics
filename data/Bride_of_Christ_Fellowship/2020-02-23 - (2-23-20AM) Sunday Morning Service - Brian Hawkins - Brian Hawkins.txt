brother Vaughn carry-ons Church IVs associate pastor so he'll be coming ministering in April for the first time for us so looking forward to that at God's grace looking forward to all that the Lord will speak to us today praise God amen you know his powers and his worth amen and we're looking forward to the Word of God today praise God there's a couple testimonies would like to share here but the van has a written testimony he's not here yet but I'm sure he'll be here soon he said I just want to thank God for healing me and James my back is much better and the fever left James last Sunday night so let's just thank going man so sorry but I dream that I was in my dream I was sleeping in my dream and uh I turn around and I instantly saw Jesus and he looked exactly like that but he was wearing a white robe instead I was so excited I was crying like Jesus is really I really thought the rapture happened but um he told me um he told me I'm coming now and at first I really understand it cuz I'm just so excited I thought he was already here and I was holding his hand he told me again tell my people I'm coming now and I woke up and I'm here to tell you I'm just here to share their dream huh tell you guys that Jesus is coming now and I told them that I would tell you guys Iowa says we'll know the time and season so that that's that's what that must mean right he's saying now it must be the time and season no man knows the day or the hour so we're just looking for the coming of the Lord trimming our lamps praise God being ready for the coming of God amen and ISIF sister Cheyenne if she would share just real quick her testimony about her eyes being healed so if you wouldn't mind sister would you come sharing that just real quick I thought that'd be a real good encouragement to the church here it's good to be here to see you all um whenever I was younger my mom noticed about my eyes we're crossings of course I had to get glasses and them so through the years probably about the time I was 12 I got sick and tired of every month so I went up for prayer I had my pastor pray for me and he annoyed me boy and prayed for me and I still didn't see the results but I quit wearing my glasses and a few years later at believers youth camp brother Tim Pruett was ministering Jr and he was reading out of the the book prophet visit South Africa just reading different witnesses and testimonies from that and one of the ones that he read well during service my ayah was crossing and it was like very distracting because I'm trying to focus on the testimonies and I couldn't focus and so so I just started thanking Lord for healing me um just quietly you know thank you Lord for healing my eyes and as soon as I started doing that he started reading a testimony from the book that was about a young girl saying in the congregation who was born with crossed eyes and she had talked to sister Bosworth I think it was about like she couldn't get in the prayer line and stuff like that and she said well just pray and ask the Lord to raise your faith to the healing level and like it's everything in the testimony I felt like was exactly what I needed and so I just started thanking the Lord and praising him and um my healing still wasn't manifested at that point I don't know maybe my faith wasn't quite up so we're supposed to be I don't know the Lord knows but um then year to later which was this past year at believers youth camp I was just sitting there brother Andrew Glover was preaching and just in the service all of a sudden my eyes just focused on me and it was like the first time in years I could see a minister straight without my eyes cross and everything so just other thing my hair [Applause] Thank You sister I appreciate that you know one of the reasons I want her to share that was because bang came up for prayer I think two weeks ago or a week ago and asked that we'd pray for CEA's eyes and so I just thought that'd be an encouragement now they're not here but I'll tell them to go back and listen to the beginning of the service or the testimony I think they'll be a great encouragement what a great testimony of just waiting upon the Lord praise God just being patient right there the wait upon the Lord renew their strength so I thought that'd be a great encouragement for us to keep waiting on the Lord whatever our need is we just need to keep waiting upon God pema confessing keep them even keep trusting in the Lord so any requests that we have this morning I'd like to remember the Sanchez family I text brother Richard Sanchez his granddaughter passed away Lilliana a six year old from cancer I texted him and he thanked us for our prayers and let's just continue to pray for them it's really difficult obviously and then brother Brian said there's a family near him who had a tragic loss of a young son so let's let's just remember them in prayer does anybody else 17 needs they like to be remembered this morning sister that's right the Gousha family they lost their father he was 54 I'm not mistaken 54 years old let's remember the Kalusha family anyone else have our requests let's stand here let's go before the Lord and word of Prayer many times it's in those darkest valleys where we feel God's presence the most [Music] [Music] our sisters [Music] [Music] troubles off with joy our hearts can say yes [Music] [Music] [Music] the way [Music] [Music] and you leave us on our own do I got you a license troubles away our hearts never was [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] my Jesus my sailor law there is none like you all of my days I want to praise the wonders of my comfort my shelter Tower of red muted screams then every all that I am [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] hi I [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I was just a child when I felt my savior leader and I was drawn to what I could not understand and for the cause of Christ I have spent my days believing that what AM II be yes and as I come to see the week I realize his grace is what I demand justice God's the loved the world that he said his son to save us from the cross you know the bridge to set us free there is still the war that rages [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] sir [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's graces Heavenly Father when it's with a grateful heart that can come with the privilege to stand behind the sacred desk this morning or father or to just come and minister your word the Lord not does that but just to be before you people does the privilege to be able to speak to your people this morning father I pray that you would forgive me of every sin every iniquity not just myself but every person in here that we become with the confidence in our heart Lord I'm sure each person in here has a need upon their hearts this morning something that's in the back of their mind something that's been troubling them all week months or years whatever it might be Lord God but but to know that you were the waymaker this morning the father of our faith could just look up to you if our faith could just reach its target this morning nor God increase our faith and nor God we just pray that you would help our unbelief this morning and just cast it out father we just look unto you the author and finisher of our faith Lord God I pray that you regard my lips this morning Don my heart guard my thoughts Lord let it be your thoughts that would come through this channel this morning Lord just give me that gift that I could just a better the way and let you have preeminence this mornin oh god and father as I also want to lift up our pastors he's been ministering this morning just pray that you would be with the home church lord I just pray that they've been greatly blessed today also the father is we're here this is our time just pray that you would bless each of us here and we could receive from you this morning we ask it your blessed name our Lord Jesus Christ as is my usual dilemma it's not so much of a dilemma all the time I just don't know which way to go yet this morning this mr. out here if you would turn with me to John chapter 1 the home church sends greetings brother Frank brother Jim sister Eileen sister Kathy all the different ones they're supposed to tell you that brother Frank you owe him a text I had to write that down because or I would have forgot that we both would have been in trouble no brother Frank is a wonderful brother and named rightly you know could appreciate the brother that if he has something to say you know where he stands if he has something to say you know you know where he stands that he you're not wondering where he's sitting so he'll plainly tell you so and just appreciate the brother thank you for the opportunity that we could be here this morning that it's wonderful to see you all again amen is it okay if I shed this early John chapter one and verse one it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made so nothing was made without him having his hand put to it amen in him was life and the life was the light of been and the light shine earth and darkness and the darkness comprehended it not now comprehend means to understand so the darkness cannot understand the light it comprehended it not it also means to possess so the darkness could not possess the light it could not overtake the light to possess the light so it could not understand the light darkness doesn't understand what light does we here in in verse four we hear that the light of man or that there is light and man brother Branham talked about taking x-rays that that a man's body has light in it already so we know that a man has light as long as he lives but when when that man dies the light goes out naturally so spiritually being in the light as he is in the light there is light but when a man lives in sin he lives in darkness and he doesn't comprehend the light so we so to have light means to have the source of life for he said he was the resurrection and the life and what I'd like to talk on this morning is that is the source in Matthew 5 and 16 at referencing verse 4 of John 1 and verse 4 it says in him was life and the life was the light of men and in Matthew 5:16 it says let your light so shine before men so he's saying that you have a light but that light if you abide in him that is his light abiding in you amen so it's it's an int you're an individual person but it's his light that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven see his individual works but it's his works going through you for didn't he say the same works that I do shall you do also and those works people will know you by those works and they will glorify the father in you amen you may be seated now first corinthians chapter eight kind of like to talk on seen and unseen unseen things first corinthians chapter 8 and verse 1 it says now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we all have knowledge every one of us has some kind of a knowledge but he says knowledge puffeth up so when we learn something we gain some knowledge we gain a little bit of confidence and in that confidence we get a little hotty with that knowledge some a little bit more than others but notice what he says here but charity edifieth everybody has some kind of a knowledge but not like he said that knowledge puffs up love does not puffs up but love edifies love vaunteth not itself it is not selfish but love edifies and verse 2 it says and if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know but if any man love God the same is known of him so when you love God people are gonna know that you love God you don't have to have a billboard going around saying I'm a Christian I love God they're gonna know that you love God now it's concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other but got none other God but one is all right there's one God for though there be that are for though there be that are called God's whether in heaven or on earth as there be God's many and Lords Betty notice that's lowercase God's lowercase Lords but there is one capital G god amen but unto us there is but one God the Father of whom are all things and we in him and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things and we by him as we open up in Scripture that God made everything the father made everything and nothing was made except unless he was involved with it so his hand was put to it all and verse 7 it says howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge not everyone knows all this so blessed are you amen howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled see for some with their conscience their conscious of it because it's there set before them so they could see that Idol so they could worship that I know they could sacrifice under that Idol but look what God said we look at the unseen you look what your mortal eyes don't see you don't see with your eyes anyhow you only look with your eyes you see with your heart you look right at and say I don't see it how many times you go into the fridge room you're looking at something what I can't find it I can't see it because you don't understand that it's right there in front of you when you say I don't see it you mean you don't understand it you're seeing is understanding so you understand with your heart in 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 16 it says for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory and verse 18 is what I was talking about while we look at we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal see those gods that those lowercase gods and those lower coat with lower case lords those are temporal those things are going to perish it's something that the thief could steal is something that the Ruskin can wither away those are the things which are that are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal now I read this somewhere I can't remember who or where I got it from I like to give credit where I get information but he kind of breaks it down in this way he says so we fixed our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen for what is seen is temporary which is what we just read but what is unseen is eternal so if I live for anything that I can see I'm dead even why my while my physical body is breathing but I live for what is not seen I live even if I lose my physical body I have a lot of scriptures so bear with me first John and four and twelve kind of quiet this morning I'm wonder if I got the right one first John in four verse 12 it says no man hath seen God at any time has anybody seen God at any time I've never seen God face to face I've never seen if we love one another god dwelleth in US and his love is perfected in us hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he had given us given us of his spirit and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God God dwelleth in him and he and God and we have known and believed the love that God has to us for god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world and as we've read that those that love God are known of that and like I said we don't have to put a big billboard sign on us and flashing lights and a big marquee rolling around behind our vehicle that you're a Christian people are going to be able to tell that amen so verse 18 a' says there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if a man say I love God there here comes a clincher if a man say I love God and hated this brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he have not seen i-i've talked on this back to the home church and it's been a common statement that I've said it that it's that it's difficult to love the unseen it's it's it's difficult to love a a being that you can't see more than others that you can see so it's hard it's hard for us as natural men to to love of God love a God that we cannot see more than love our wives or our children or our friends different ones it gets a little bit difficult so I think sometimes get a little people get a little discouraged through that let me finish up with verse 21 it says and this commandment hath we from him that he who loveth God love his brother also so you can't do both you can't hate one and love the other you suit and you can't have that hate in your in your in your body towards your own brother and say that you love God for he says you become a liar by trying to do so but people God is contingent in people's mind on the fact of could see him or not because that that's what people say I can't believe in a god that I can't see well you go to you might go to an illusionist or you might enjoy going to a magician and you might see that you might love all those little tricks and you might say well I believe that could happen but here was an illusion the whole time that's why they're called an illusionist you know they make it look like something real happened but it was a trick it was a trick of the eye so you rather just you know anybody older I'm sure I'm sure everybody's heard the the the adage that the hand is quicker than the eye so somebody could take something from you faster than what you could see so seeing isn't always believing because the way that we pick things up through our eye through our mind then through the whole process you might see something that you really don't see so and a lot of people's relationship of whether or not God exists is contingent of if they could see him or not so if you believe in God this morning how great is your faith and a god that you can't see and you continue to love them and you continue to have that relationship grow amen but you know you can't see a lot of things but people realize that people realize that they exist and I'm going to get into a few examples here because they see what it could do so you may not be able to see God but you could see his manifestation you can't see different things let's let's say I'll just get into the examples everybody knows what a faucet is you go wash your hands in a faucet but a faucet has nothing of itself the faucet has to be tapped into a source for without us it could do nothing you can't see what's behind that faucet until the faith is applied brother Branham taught about and taught us about faith that it takes faith just to start your car so it takes faith to go and turn the faucet on something simple is that see when you go up to the faucet you're you have an expectation that when you turn that handle that there's going to be some kind of power behind that Amen so but without us that faucet can do nothing and you can't see anything but what's behind there you just see the plumbing and you see the manifestation of what comes out but you can't see further ahead you can't see with the sources you just believe that that's going to come through the pipe but how many times have you turned on the faucet and and you're expecting something to come out and it doesn't come out and you're just sitting there wondering what's going on well the first rule of troubleshooting whether it's an electrical circuit or or something and plumbing you could apply it to your life at any time the first rule of troubleshooting is is there power it as it turned on or somebody didn't push the button to turn it back on so that's that's like the number one thing that happens is that you'll find that there is no power so you just you have to ask yourself is it tapped into the source is there something wrong between it and the source between the faucet and the source is there something wrong in between so that's and you could apply the same thing in your life that is there something between me and God something between me and the source why is there not power in my life because I'm sure we've all had the question or just like gideon if god before is where are all the miracles if god be for us where are all these things I'm not seeing anything happening well seeing isn't always a believing thing amen so seeing just believing that God is and it's not an experience whether you see it or whether you don't see it whether you feel it or whether you don't feel it but that you believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him amen so somewhere down the line in the past something got between you and the source so now you have to find out why is that why isn't there no power behind it so you have to go back to the past where it went off so somebody might have went through and and shut the see I shut the hose off to the outside downstairs in the winter so the faucet the spigot outside doesn't freeze so if we don't remember what happened in the past how can you get right with God if you don't go back to the past where you changed this situation you change the circumstance but you have to go back to that point and turn that power back on amen but you have to be tapped into the source amen John 15 and 5 he says I am the vine and ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing so the faucet is sitting in the same condition without us it can do absolutely nothing amen so the only power that a faucet has is what you put to it it's only when the faucet is put to use that it has power behind it now power comes from the pressure of what's pushing behind it that's where the power is it's something else the faucet doesn't have the power of itself it's what's behind it that's pushing the power through it so it's not the faucets work since the source works it's not our work since his works through us amen everybody knows what an aerator is it goes right onto your faucet if you don't have that aerator on there it's kind of out of control but an aerator it controls the flow so you have so you use less water pretty much it kind of adds air into it but it controls the flow now if you have a gummed up aerator it's it's kind of it looks like a screen and it screws right onto your faucet so if that's all plugged up it restricts the flow now see we don't want our life all clogged up with sin and the blackness of sin man we you've got to have a clear passage it has to be clear now just because you see a faucet doesn't mean that it has power having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof amen it has a potential just sitting there it has a potential but it has to be chosen and it has to be tapped into the resource you can go to Lowe's and Home Depot and they have all kinds of faucets but that doesn't mean that they've got power they're just sitting there waiting on something but every one of them they're in empty vessels all right they're just waiting to be put to use it has to be chosen you have to walk the aisle you have to find one that you like you have to pick it out so you have to justify and then you have to go and then you have to sanctify and then you have to fill it with the Holy Ghost amen it has to go through the certain steps to receive that power and have that power to go through it amen so a faucet isn't a faucet just because it looks like a faucet it's a vessel that just sits there claiming to be a faucet a faucet is a faucet when it meets a criteria of what a faucet is supposed to do see faith without works is dead a Christian isn't a Christian just because someone labeled them that way a Christian is Christ like doing the works of the Father when people see you doing the works of the Father father you will be known as a Christian for it's the same word same n if any man loves God the same is known of him now plumbing and electrical that parallel each other so when you learn electrical they'll teach you the analogy of plumbing and vice versa with plumbing they'll teach you about electrical because it's pretty much the same thing because you have to apply power and then you have flow so power has to come from somewhere you know basic physics it states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest unless some outside other than itself something outside force some outside force changes its state and an object in motion tends to remain in motion with a constant velocity unless it's acted on by a nonzero net force that's friction gravity and any other force that would try to get between you and God amen anything that would try to hinder your walk power only happens when there is energy flow voltage in an electrical circuit is the pressure that makes current flow voltage and current are not the same voltage pushes the current through the circuit now what you what you end up having is oh my goodness in an electrical circuit whoo-hoo there has to be continuity in this circuit if you want to maintain power from the source there has to be an unbroken circuit in there your relationship has to be an unbroken with continuity with God amen and yeah and there's there's a thing called resistance Oh resist not the Holy Ghost my brothers and sisters because it slows the float of God be not quick to resist the Holy Ghost amen amen but you must maintain continuity with the source but the point of all this is being is that you don't see it happening you don't see the electricity flowing but as soon as you turn on that switch by faith you're connected to the power source here it comes the manifestation you see the light so just because people can't see God and they say that there's no God because I don't see them they should be able to see that and not every man has this knowledge but they should be able to see the manifestation of God in your life amen the manifestation should be there if the manifestation is not there if they can't do it would you be convicted if somebody charged you for being a Christian would there be enough evidence to convict you oh my people don't see that happening but they should be able to see the change that has taken place when when you're picked up from a broken condition and and God tends to mend all these puts all these patches no he doesn't put patches on anything he renews it but he sees them he's the the people should be able to see the work that he's doing you know you don't cuss anymore you don't drink anymore you don't smoke anymore and people have - it stands to reason or question why don't you do these things anymore well if you've got a few minutes let me tell you why see the people should be able to recognize that there is a change taking place you don't have to go broadcast to everybody of course we have boldness I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with that but I'm just saying you don't have to do that brother Branham says this he says this was taken out of the uncertain sound he says a men cut every obstacle from human beings you know if there's resistance in your life cut that obstacle out amen that they might be connected like in the Garden of Eden man as a militant he says you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent did not he say in mark 11:22 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass and you shall have what you said he says what happens when to omnipotence meet when God and man comes together to omnipotence something's got to shake whatsoever you say with that creative power of admittance of God knowing that he promised it and he said it at his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because - of nipa Tain's have met Barry Stan's oh he isn't he wonderful so when to omnipotence come something's got to take place that switch that light switch back there this one over here it that it's open until you close it it has to match the circuit with if you if I was to draw a diagram out it would look something like this so that means it's an open circuit so when you flip that switch what happens is that's gonna come down as gonna make contact amen oh one of these days he's gonna come down and we're gonna make contact we're just gonna take off amen praise God and then he says this and when you got supreme power when Jesus said lay hands on the sick they shall recover all what could stand in your way and you got supreme faith in that being the truth you need a supreme God they made a supreme promise and a supreme result will come amen he said that's it oh my he also says this and it wasn't so from the beginning when God and a believer meets there are two omnipotence because a man is because a man is a part of God are you a part of God this morning do you have to believe that you are a part of God this morning because if you don't believe that then you have no relationship there because the man is a part of God he is a son of God and sisters too and what little he joins with and what little he is joins with the entire body so you wear a many membered Bride you might be one thing and you might think of yourself something so insignificant so little but come together with many more how much more power is going to take place amen but he says he is the son of God with little he is joins with the entire body and Jesus said over and 11 to mark 11:22 saying the same thing he says if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart see that's the problem as we doubt in our heart because we have something we're afraid of something there's something keeping us from that promise down on the inside there's something wrong there's something saying I don't really believe that now that's what we have to get out of there we have to put to the side and say that I believe that promise I'm laying hold on that promise I'm no matter what I just heard a song here's a little bit ago it's called even if and I was just wondering what that song was I think it's Mercy Me or Casting Crowns I'm not here to promote them or the song but I like what he was saying with the song he was even saying that being up on stage that people have the idea that the person up on stage has everything together you know you might look at a preacher and think man he's got everything together why can't we like that and this man is a singer unfortunately people look at singers and they tend to worship them especially if there's a successful singer so they think they have everything together when they have just as many problems as you and sometimes a little bit more problems so he was saying that if you think I have no problems think again because there are times that I don't want to stand here and sing there I'm sure brother Jesse's felt it if if you haven't brother forgive me but he probably felt that he didn't really want to go to church that day he didn't really want to go preach that day you know I know brother Jim has had those struggles I know I've had those struggles well I don't want to go preach you know I just don't feel like going you know my thing is I don't feel I'm I'm just not good enough to to go preach you know I'm not and I'll never be good enough to do it but get the focus off me put the focus back on the other fellow but through his song I guess his son had diabetes since he was like 2 there was some type of diabetes so I can I can kind of understand what he's talking about with with a son getting over like 30,000 shots you know because after every meal he would have to have a shot of insulin but what he was saying through that song is even if you don't heal me I'm still gonna serve you it's not conditional of whether it's something that I see or something I received I'm not looking for a great reward reward on this earth for my reward is up in heaven amen so as long as I say true and I stay faithful amen then we should be able to go on we meet those conditions to be able to go what's going to hinder us even if he doesn't hear you on this earth and that is his will that is his will for you to be healed but if he doesn't heal you are you going to hold it against them or are you going to still love him no matter what even if he doesn't heal you even if he does heal you even if he doesn't meet those finances even if he does beat those finances it doesn't matter what the circumstance that you still serve God amen going on with what he was saying he says be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said and it will come to pass believe that what you have said and a Christian is so marked that around him is an atmosphere now there's an atmosphere that we have to create for the people you know to just love to be in your presence it's it's not an atmosphere or selfishness it's not an atmosphere of wantonness you know it's not an atmosphere of lack but it's an atmosphere of love that people so desired man I can't wait to get into brother amens presence again man I just love talking with that brother brother bang brother Jesse and brother Jose that I can't remember all the sisters name so forgive me but creating that atmosphere no matter what people do to you if you just create that atmosphere of love it's gonna draw more people to you now don't get that thought in your mind well brother Brian does that all the time no I don't but I sure would like to and I like that song that we came out I want to praise them more than what I do I want to love them more than what I do amen I want to do all those things I want to do all the good things more than what I do because I seriously lack but we need to have that atmosphere that's something that we can do amen see if your desire I'm sure it's the same as mine if you love Jesus you want to be pleasing unto him right which is the same desire that Jesus had to be pleasing to the Father he wanted to be about his father's business he wanted to fulfill when he was sent to earth for men but people won't be able to see that that super special force are I want to see what that's all about well you can't see it you can only see the manifestation you can only see what's taking place by what's happening let's talk about the wind no one knows where the wind comes from can anybody here tell where the wind come from can you tell where it's going you can only put a weather vane up there and see what direction it's going you could put a I can't remember what you call it but it's it's similar to a speedometer but it's it's uh you could see all fast the wind is traveling that's about all you could do you could put a windmill up you can harness the wind or you can harness the power of the wind but you can't really harness and control the wind there's absolutely nothing you can do for the wind they meant so you can just enjoy it where it is and respect it where you ought to now John three and eight it says the wind bloweth where it listeth and now here's the sound thereof but can't canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth and now you are likened unto the wind so as every one that is born of the Spirit they don't understand what you're doing they don't understand the concept of why you shun the very periods of evil well so what if you go out and have a beer or whatever I can but I don't want to well that movie isn't all that bad you know why do you hold yourself back from it why do you hold back from letting your ear not know why don't you let your kids do this why don't you let your kids do that it's because we're raising them up in a special way that they don't understand not every man has that knowledge that you have blessed are your ears blessed are your eyes that you could see a man they don't understand the things that we do and we're likened unto the wind they can't understand the wind they don't know where it comes from they don't know where it goes all they see is why are you so nitpicky well because I can't stay in the smell of cigarettes and I can't stay in the foul mouth that you have you know well since they asked you might as well tell them I'm not gonna come out and say things to people but if they ask I'm gonna tell them and you ought not to be afraid to say something either amen have you if somebody asks you don't lie about it don't be ashamed of the gospel don't shun to proclaim the whole counsel of God you know I've talked to some guys at work and they're not not all of them they're not clean that they don't have clean mouths but I've mentioned something about some other guys we have truck drivers that that deliver stuff and and I just can't believe the mouth that some of these guys that they have and under don't get me wrong I used to talk that way but I thought I had a better vocabulary than that but every other word I mean and then they say ya know that that even bothers me well if it bothers them how bad is that you know so but we don't have to we're not taken out of the world because of things like that but if we can interject the love you know not be judgmental but if we could have a little bit more love to show them what the love of Christ is amen but we were all once sinners yes amen I know I was I was saved by love my love of the people because I thought everybody was a hypno I thought I thought every church was a hypocrite I didn't I didn't like going to church I grew up in church and I just thought it was all hypocrisy but come to find out somebody proved me wrong but I didn't understand it I just knew something was different until I got more and more into the Word of God amen then I can understand it when I started taking on the principles of the word then I understood that that men couldn't understand I was in the same boat I don't understand why they do these things you know you know they do it behind closed doors not everybody is like that you know there are some people that have integrity in the heart to do the right thing even when nobody is looking there are some people that have integrity with the Holy Spirit that are filled with the Holy Spirit that continue to live a godly life with no matter what doors are closed whether it's home whether it's work or whatever it is you ever walk into a room and not nobody not know that somebody was in there did they find yourself do they find you grumbling and complaining and and cussing and swearing and proclaiming to be a Christian oh my say you never know when somebody's in and in the room with you I mean unless it's in your bedroom but I better get off of that one but but you get the point is if if you if you didn't know that somebody was in the room how do you conduct yourself are you ashamed when they make their voice heard and then their their presence is known do you know somebody was in here I shouldn't have said that I shouldn't have through this I shouldn't have thrown that you see what I mean how do we conduct ourselves behind closed doors amen it's wonderful that you put on a front on the outside but what's on the inside that's that that's what matters they meant but Jesus was telling Nicodemus that a man must be born again in return he asked how can these things be see Nicodemus didn't understand and Jesus said are you not are you not a ruler or a teacher I mean are you not a teacher and you don't understand these things so everybody has knowledge but knowledge puffeth up but it's love that edifies Amen when you're able to be taught you've got a humbleness of heart when you can't be taught anything you know everything nobody's going to be able to help you with anything you shut everybody off but being born again as a mystery just just like the wind nobody knows where the wind comes from nobody knows where it's going Amen well one minute the wind could be calm as could be the next moment it could be tempestuous it could be stormy but uh it could be high winds now we don't know where it comes from we don't know where it goes all we know is that it is nobody knows where the Spirit of God comes from nobody knows what the Spirit of God does but we know that it is amen oh my one day Moses didn't know what to say he didn't know who he didn't know how to say who sent him he says what who should I tell him to send me and what did God say tell them that I am amen so we know that he is all because he says I am we believe it right that's that's not the only reason but you know just imagine Moses on that day and he just said I am I'm gonna take that to the children of Israel I am could you imagine but all the power that lays in the in the words that I am Oh my axe to intuit it says and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting now wouldn't you just love to hear something like that and then not be a storm outside you just hear the the sound of a mighty rushing wind now we know what happened on that day when that sound of a mighty rushing wind came in that it was the presence of the Lord and when people heard the sound of a mighty rushing wind they didn't know what was going on but until they were inside and partakers with the wind amen oh my Moses Exodus 10 and 13 I'll try not to be too much longer Exodus 10 and 13 it says and Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night and when it was morning the east wind brought the locusts and in verse 19 of that same chapter says and the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind which took away the low cast them into the Red Sea there remain not one locus in all the coasts of Egypt now another place here in Exodus 14 and 21 it says and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided so we see who controls the wind because the Lord sent an east wind and he sent a west wind and it brought locusts and it took locusts away in a separated water and Adam made it as dry ground for the children of Israel walk on all right so there's power in the wind is that right God has remained the same he had controlled the wind in the Old Testament bringing in east and west wind he also had control of the wind in the New Testament when Jesus came and said peace be still so we know the source of the wind is God is that right everything that was made was made by him so he is the controller of the wind not man man can't control wind they wish they could because they would use it for evil wouldn't it God couldn't trust man or the wind in control of man look what look what man can control now and it's not of good power without character is satanic is that right no wonder he doesn't give us the power of these things because of man's selfish desire that's all they have is a selfish desire so fulfilling who could be on top who can who can have more power than the other see knowledge puffeth up but it's love that edifies love is what unifies love is what draws us together love is what's going to save people it's not how much you know it's not how many scriptures you can quote it's not how many message quotes you could quote it's not how much knowledge you have in the message and you know what brother Peter said here you know what brother brainer said there is it still okay to say that brother brain have said see knowledge puffeth up knowledge will take you so far from God it'll disconnect you from the power source oh my you just would be another faucet sitting there at home depot or lowes now in first Kings 19 verse 11 it says and he said go forth and stand upon the mountain before the Lord and behold the Lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and breaking pieces the rocks before the Lord their excuse me yes before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind see the wind could be powerful but the Lord was not in it at that time and after the wind an earthquake something else that was powerful but the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake of fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice oh how much there's power in a still small voice could you just think for a moment of how many times I how many situations were changed how many how many circumstances were changed of somebody in life and death all because they were obedient to the still small voice there's power in the still small voice it's something not all men had that knowledge of that still small boys how many people here can recognize when that still small boy speaks because sometimes it's hard to differentiate between the voice in your head and the still small voice of God but there's a time that we have to exercise that discernment to know whether it's the voice of God or not you got to check the motive you got to check the desire you got to check it with the word you got a check you to visit is it a righteous thing or not so just because there's a voice there it doesn't always mean that it's of God well I feel letter the Lord to go do this and knowing that it's contrary to his word you should know right then that is not the voice of God speaking they're still powering the still small voice when it's a genuine voice is God speaking there's been many demented men on that have dementia that said that they were led by God to go commit a horrendous acts of murder what God told me to go do this well I'm not sure what voice spoke in their head I'd be daring that not to say that it wasn't God but I have a hard time believing that it would be God for God to send somebody off in the New Testament age I'm not saying the Old Testament something in the New Testament I would have a hard I'm thinking that believing that God sent somebody to do some horrendous acts you know but we know that Judas was it was ordered of the Lord did not Jesus say go and do what you were called to do go do what you're supposed to do see the demons even have their place and they have to obey Him even when he speaks hey man [Music] but many magnificent powerful things have happened because of the obedience of the still small voice amen something where people on the outside people in the world have no understanding of how powerful a still small voice would be the obedience of a still small voice of the still small boys first John 4 verse 1 it says beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they're of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the Spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God that's a simple discernment isn't sometimes it gets a little bit more complicated than where it's not so cut and dry but that's where we have to have our discernment exercised yes we actually have to exercise on the Word of God and it's a free membership to this gym to walk this to walk in here and then to exercise it hey man you could afford it all it takes is a little bit of time redeeming the time is that right praise God and every spirit that confesseth not Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is the spirit of Antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in this world in the world so we know that it's here and we are here to contend with it that's the battle that we have that's one of the many battles that we have let's take for instance side by side here's another example you put side by side a glass of water glass of Hydra hydrochloric acid glass of sulfuric acid now each of those outside properties of what you see of what it is on the outside it all looks the same it would be so close that it would deceive the elect if it were possible Amen but glass of water glass of hydrochloric acid glass of sulfuric acid they all look clear they're all transparent they don't you put some ice in there and might they all look refreshing oh if I could have a drink of that water because I'm about the thirst of death maybe I will all look the same on the outside but it's what's on the inside what's on the inside the chemical makeup on the inside of each one of them is different the hydrochloric acid as you can guess from part of the name hydro hydrochloric is from water but water in its sense and in the man who just left me I get the the pH of it it has to be balanced because if you go too far one way it's going to be too much of a base that's going to be too caustic it's going to be too much soda and if you go too far the other way is we couldn't gonna become an acid so right in the middle is that pure word right in the middle is that pureness that holiness that stays right with that Amen you go too far it's going to go it's going to be acidic you go too far it's going to melt everything around it it's good it nobody wants to be around that one because it dissolves everybody right in the middle you go too far it's going to be too caustic it's going to be too much soda in it it just sits there and does nothing you drink either one um it's not gonna be good for you but right in the middle there's and it's either seven I think is a sweet spot for the pH of water it's like between six and a half seven and a half somewhere around there those that are more scholarly than me could could tell me if I'm wrong or not so it's the inside makeup of each one of those water and acid looks the same on the outside might look refreshing but it's what's on the inside that really matters hey man one has life the other one has death amen which one do you say but you can't see that life in that water now can you but you know that there's our because it gives other things life when it takes of that water that refreshing water it brings forth life plants needed humans need animals needed it brings forth life without it you will die but you can't see the life but you know it's there you see the change that life is making whether it be plants and animals or humans you can see you see that it when a baby is born you see that there is life because it grows it changes you see a sapling is you see from a seed it grows you know that there's life but you can't see the life on the inside you just know that it's there you can't see God but you know that he's there you know the manifestation is there we're on the inside life happens on the inside life doesn't happen on the outside life happens on the inside but you can't see it but there is something that continues to develop we can't see God but we know when he is done and a believer know that the changes have taken place at a believer you know something has happened now a tree under a burden will continue to grow and it will grow crooked now sometimes when a believer gets off some things get a little harder or when things go awry it doesn't it might look like that they're not a believer but say patch things up and they tap back into the source it'll grow straight again that believer will grow again like I said earlier with with the faucet that you have to go back when you find out that there's no power there you have to go back to the source and tap back into it amen when you take the burdens off it starts to grow straight again none amen better go in close everybody still good with me this morning lady had a baby over there this is brother branham this is out of Abraham in 1960 lost my lid flip my lid this morning a lady had his face baby over there the other night in an emergency room and I prayed for the little fellow and I told her I said like a stalk of corn coming up if nothing bothers it it'll produce a stalk of corn good and straight in a good ear if a vine wraps around it a clog lays over it it sticks a no crook well that's the way or anything else is there's something hindered it sometimes we have hindrances in our lives is that right well if you can move the the hindrance the thing will grow straight now a lot of people say why don't see any difference now excuse me that don't have anything to do with it not a thing excuse me pull the cloud off the corn it don't straighten up right now just give it a chance laying in the warm Sun so you can't cut people off just just because of the way that they look you know you can't count them as as a child of hell just because of their appearance now sometimes we do that man can you believe that person looks like that sometimes we get judgmental like that how can you have somebody who looks like that you know just look like they got in a fight with a stapler they got stuff all over him you know so sometimes we get judgmental why I don't want to be in near that person and they could be a sweet person all they need to hear is the love hear the word of God just need to experience the love of God one time they probably met church with with a lot of hypocrisy and then that's probably why they don't like church but talk to him you show him the real love of God amen as much as within you I better start in that paragraph the hood now a lot of people say well I don't see any difference now that don't have anything to do with it not a thing pull the Claud off off the corn and don't straighten up right now just give it a chance laying in the warm Sun the rain watch it comes right out straight so will you do the same thing you just believe it it's God 1 all life but that life is botany life which comes forth by the S UN but eternal life comes through the S Oh n is that right the Son of God tell you what you people could do pour concrete up and down on your sidewalk put the grass down down there where there's where there's the thickest of your grass next spring right along the edge of that sidewalk why it's that life in there you can't hide life how many times have you cleaned an area out and you put gravel down you even put the black plastic down we we went we went away one time and we had this garden they we put this black stuff on top of the garden you know it was to kill the weeds well lo and behold when we came back we were gone for a week here those weeds they pushed all that black stuff up so it was like knee-high weeds so you can't hide life that life is gonna grow oh my see when the Sun begins to warm that concrete that little life will grow right on out right on out stick his head up and praise God that's right you can't hide it that those times that you you clean an area out you put gravel in there you put that black plastic down lo and behold that grass is going to make through because you can't hold life back there are time there many times throughout the ages they tried to squash the Word of God they tried to kill it they tried to maim it they tried to hide it they tried to burn it and they couldn't do it because he can't hide life God is life he is the source of life he is the one who quit the life in us and we will live for him until that life goes out Amen use this as you better come but then he says this but he that understandeth he that knows his place in this hour he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath present tense eternal life shall not come into the judgment but has already passed from death unto life then when this new eternal life dwells in you it is the potential or the earnestness of you being quickened from mortal to immortality oh my let me say that again when this spirit this is what he says he says let me say that again when the Spirit has found you the individual and has come upon you it's the potential of your eternal inheritance that God thought of you and made for you before the foundation of the world that is your potential do you recognize your potential this morning it's more than just a pure warmer it's more than just going to work and saying I believe God it's more than that but there's an inheritance of eternal glory life excuse me like if you ask me for an oak tree and I give you an acorn now the life for the oak tree is in the Acorn now but you have to wait until it grows up so do we when you receive the Holy Spirit of God it's God's potential waiting upon you that's already recognized you and you're sealed by the spirit of promise of God into the body of Christ when God looked down at Calvary and seen Jesus dying he died for his bride the body which is the word church the church that believes the Word of God for the age whether its feet whether its body head or wherever it is Christ was bleeding and dying and God looking upon him saw his resurrection in the church raised with him on Easter see as I was saying earlier that to him you were an impotent as much as God as if nificent when you were in him for if you're in him and he's in you then you're part of him you were a son you were a daughter of God amen so that's where you live this morning if you have taken God upon his promises you believe God you you're born again that's what you haven't got I know I'm talking to believers I know there are some I don't know everybody here but if you could just see in this hour if you're tapped into the source of potential that you have Amen now he says now notice it's the earnest or the potential the quickening power of your resurrection when you receive the Holy Spirit is then dwelling in you the potential of it notice you are now on your way growing to the full resurrection no tree just comes up overnight it's got to grow as we grow in the Grace and knowledge of God you were baptized into the Holy Spirit now as the Pentecostal church baptized into the Holy Spirit it began growing lines' died they was pruning them off see soon do you take off the things that are hindering you the things that are sucking life away you have got to cut it off you cannot be friends with the world if it's sucking the life of God out of you if it's taking your time away cut it off you've got to prune it in order for it to grow amen but the tree is still growing it's still going on because it's got to come to the resurrection they're led by the spirit to quicken the word to you whose believers the word keeps quickening as you come to the first limb the second limb the third limb on up it just keeps quickening the Spirit of God keeps quickening you now catch this now look now the Bible didn't say these signs will follow William Branham oh oh this is brother branham's own words he said the Bible didn't say these signs will follow William Branham it didn't say it'll follow Oral Roberts only it didn't say it would follow brother cop or somebody or Jesse Smith or Brian Hawkins it didn't say that he said these signs shall follow them plural that belief if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover it's that power of God that's in you that brings a life to the person you got your hands on of the life-giving source of the Holy Ghost so it's the the Lord working through you when you believe on him how much oh my goodness it's just channeled to that person that you're laying your hands on a and it's with faith them you got a cast out on all that doubt hey man I'm not gonna read the rest that he has there I just want to share with you this song everybody I'm sure knows it it's called I claim the blood it says I have a source of strength when I am weak that takes me through when life is pressing me I have a source of power from above is that right I'm covered over by a shield of love then the course goes on I claim the blood that Jesus shed on Calvary those precious blood stains were made there just for me for all my sin my sickness in my pain when I need healing I claim those precious bloodstains are you in that condition do you find yourself calling out for the blood of Christ amen I do not know how others make it through and I can relate cuz I don't know how other people make it through who never go to Calvary as I do because when I can't make it through I can't help but I have to go to Calvary because that's my source of strength I have to go to Calvary for that's where I was born again I have to go to Calvary that's where I received life and then it says for there the healing cleansing stream still flows with peace that only his redeemed can know not every man has this knowledge but blessed are you to have that knowledge and blessed are you that you continue on with love because God is love you receive God and you could portray God you can manifest God you can manifest left love and again it's not your works but it's his works as we read in the beginning it's not our light he says you shine your light upon among men but your light is his light because you're reflecting his light and you're doing the works of the Father it's not your works but it's his works and what does it do it glorifies the father amen I stand to our feet bar has this if you play that song I claim why most presses a fountain the giver of life the giver of every good gift other we just thank you for this word that you've given us this morning Oh God and truly without you we can do nothing and as we talked about the faucet and the electrical and the different things that we've talked about for without you we can do nothing Oh God and for without us those things that we spoke of they could do nothing without us and Lord may be not our selfish works but maybe the works of the Father that we go and do that would glorify you Father and Lord forgive us of every sin every iniquity any hindrance that would be in our life and our relationship with you Lord if there's something in our lives lord help us to go back and to make that thing right that we can reconnect that we can have continuity with you once again father Lord that we can reconnect with the source of life and we can reconnect with you that we would continue and that we would have the power in our lives to say to this mountain it would be moved to say to this sickness that it would be moved to say to this there are our finances our struggles whatever it might be our dispirited situation where we can't see a way out but Lord God may it be that power that we call upon oh we just love you so much we appreciate you Oh God but may we be reconnected with you father made all those hindrance with Lord we know that there is no sin that would separate us we know that there is nothing out there that could separate us from the love of God so when we just come back and reunite with you and get a refreshing of you at done that we could reach handle being that jailer again that we would have that refreshing of the Holy Ghost that we could go renewed in our spirit for the scripture says that her that inward man that's renewed day by day that we could seek you first thing in the morning first thing in the noontime first thing in the evening time no matter what time it would be maybe that we would seek you first and in the kingdom of heaven and everything else would be battered unto it oh god Lord if we could just keep our mind and our eyes focused on you and that you would continue to give us understanding in your word that we can continue to fight these battles that we contend with each and every day father Lord that the enemy is out there just trying to buffett us and Buffett us and Buffett us but may we stay true no matter if you would heal this did this day or you would heal us that day no matter what that I would stay true to your word that I would continue to have that desire on the inside God that I would want to continue to serve you no matter what storm may come no matter what winds may blow then I would stay true that I would stay grounded that I would stay faithful unto you Father I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ that you would be upon every believer this morning that you would be upon every believer Lord do you see this their needs that they have in their lives you see what they're you know what they're thinking in their minds you know what they're thinking even in their hearts this morning northern somebody's calling out to you this morning that they want to get rid of these things is that's plaguing them in their lives something that's hindering their walk with you they want to get rid of it this morning just like that song that we were saying before I came out that the Lord I want to love you more than what I do I want to praise you more than what I do but Lord we've got to look to the author and finisher of our faith and lord help them in their unbelief this morning that you had cast all out all doubt from them this morning that they would receive what they're asking of Lord you know was hiding inside you can free Lord we can't even hide our thoughts from you father had just pray that you would be upon those situations manifest yourself in their lives will God manifest quicken your spirit to them once again nor do I ask in the name of Jesus Christ for we claim the blood this morning then press the sacrifice that was made on count that gives us that power that gives us the authority over our enemies because we've been born again and because we've received that seed that seed Word of God in our hearts and we won't let the enemy take it away from us but it's that good brown we're not gonna let the the stony places but Lord we believe where the good ground this morning just continue to the plaintive word plant your seed in our hearts at him and that we would drink the water that we would read into your water in your word that it would continue watering that word that he would grow and grow and grow Lord we ask and your blessed name the Lord Jesus Christ amen enable
