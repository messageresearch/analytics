TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thank you Jesus for his grace and his mercy and I'm thankful for the spiritual Road we're on that his Spirit leads us to him thank you Jesus for our Bible reading verse this morning let's turn to John 16 verse 13 John 16 verse 13 so the verse 13 it says how abide when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come thank you Jesus for the Holy Spirit today to lead and guide and direct us to open our eyes to open our hearts Hallelujah let's bow our heads for prayer yes Lord Heavenly Father we praise you for your love and your mercy Hallelujah we praise you that you lead and guide and direct us as we go through life Jes thank you Lord for opening our eyes and taking the veil off our hearts Hallelujah we want to praise and thank you for this Lord we ask your presence here today Lord help us that we can all be truly surrendered and that you can have your way Lord we ask that the Holy Spirit would just teach us today thank you Jesus for health and thank you for the many blessings we ask this in your name amen amen you may be seated I'm going to read a little bit in uh in Psalms 23 God laid on my heart this morning it says in Psalms 23 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want isn't that ever true The Lord Is Our Shepherd and we shall not want if we he will take care of us if we trust him it says seek ye first the kingdom of God in his righteousness and all things shall be added unto you we're serving the wonderful God in verse two he says he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yeay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me amen isn't that ever true amen I like to be on the Mountaintop I like the Mountaintop experiences but you know what I think I grow more if he takes me through the valley amen yes that we need to trust him if we're on the Mountaintop we might not be trusting him like we do if we go through trials and tribulations but God wants us to trust to truly trust him in all things and he will take care of us yes Lord it says Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup run us over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen the word of God is true it's sure we can stand on it it it will it's just so wonderful to just believe the word and Trust the word of God it says in beginning was the word and the Word was with God and God was the word isn't that true if God is the word why why don't we want want to eat the word amen it it says Us in in the Book of Revelation says us eat the little book yes that's open for us thank God thank you Lord I didn't know Jesse was keeping track how many times he came to preach for us but that's okay he said 17 times and I I remember one evening he came and down and he baptized 17 people that evening isn't that something glory amen it was hard for me to stop and think the things that we were taught a lot of them were wrong that's right but praise the Lord God sees our hearts yes if we truly want him yes he will make a way Hallelujah he did for the children of Israel he brought the children of Israel out of Egypt out of bondage and that's what he's doing today he's leading people to himself he's leading people out of bondage out of denominations right Hallelujah we can truly trust the word once I started see in that that we can truly trust trust the word and that's the only thing I want to trust it's the word trust God he's going to he knows his sheep and his sheep hear his voice and they follow him amen yes sir yes GL so who is here that's trying to distract us from that it is Satan the Old Devil that's trying to get us away from the word and just to mix if he can get us to believe one lie he's got us that's what happened back in the Garden of Eden yes sir the trees he he said we may freely eat of the trees all except the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil don't eat of this tree brothers and sister isn't that tree still available today that's right amen it is that tree is still available for us to eat today the tree of what the tree of knowledge right and what does the Bible say about knowledge it says knowledge puffers up amen we're not supposed to eat of that tree this is one thing that that we're learning we can we can memorize this whole book every word in here we can believe every story yes right up in our heads in knowledge right but it's not going to do us any good we're meeting people they're people struggling with us they think we're on the wrong path right after we receive true Freedom after we received the true word of God but brothers and sisters that's exactly how it was with Jesus when Jesus was walking here on Earth how many people received him very few that's right very few some said he's castes out uh Devils by Bells didn't they yeah they said they they mocked him on the cross they spit on him we can be very thankful if God opened our eyes if we're truly following him Hallelujah I'm going to turn to something that we're just realizing lately that was more uh precious and more powerful than we thought it was and this was before just before we uh received the the pro the books about the book about the prophet or thing two years ago I didn't know anything about that God send a prophet I didn't know anything about about that we never heard anything about this man but I'm going to read here in Matthew 16 I think that this is a in a scripture that is very important to us when in Matthew 16 I'm going to start in verse 14 it says and they said some say thou art John the Baptist some Elias and Jeremiah well I should read verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi they asked he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets isn't that how it is today we can ask people questions and we'll get different answers but brothers and sisters I think one of the most important things to pray for is that we get Revelation from God what this word actually means siru because this word is not going to change who's got to change we have to change we have to align ourselves with the word of God amen amen that's right brother so then Jesus asks the question he says unto them but whom say ye that I am we all need to ask us that question who do we say that Jesus is amen do we know him Hallelujah brothers and sisters I we can say we believe the message but that doesn't say we're a Christian that's right that's right amen that can be just another denomination yes sir but do we see that we are special people that he created us that he loves us that he cares for us and can we see that he's working in our lives yes brothers and sisters that's why we need that's what I'm seeing if we believe the word the word starts to clean us hallelujah we cannot clean ourself that's right sir how many people tried I did I've tried to do better did it work no it didn't work it's like an old oak tree we all know Falls here Falls coming the old oak tree hangs through its Leaf a lot of leaves will be hanging there maybe towards Spring that's right we don't need to go out and pull them off they'll probably go through a lot of wind and storms this winter they're cold but there's still going to be something hanging on there till next spring and what's going to bring them off the springtime Springtime isn't that what we need in our lives we need more Springtime in our lives when the the life comes out of the ground comes up the new leaves start to grow and the old fall off that's the way it is if we get the Holy Spirit into our lives and starts working it'll clean us from the inside out Our Lives will be changing and who gets the credit for it God Amen it says our works are as filthy rags praise the Lord hallelujah Jesus answered and said unto them and and he asked Peter who do you say that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God now listen what Jesus said and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bonah for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven that's for us hallelujah BL and sisters we're seeing this and then Jesus said and I see unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it I think it was January a year ago January 23 one morning I was having devotions and God gave me that Revelation and brothers and sisters that's a wonderful Revelation to have Hallelujah God Amen we can talk to people we can share the gospel but if people don't have the Revelation what God is building his church on we can't tell them that's right they cannot understand the scripture the natural mind cannot understand it we can try to read the word and read and study it let's pray for Revelation to reveal to reveal the mystery what's laying in the word doesn't the Bible say it's hid from people yes it is amen my thinking of the word of God is different than it was two years ago I was born again I became born again when I 36 years old but I stayed in denominations I didn't know better and it seems to me that that Veil kept the Holy Spirit from truly working in my life because once I got this Revelation things started to change and God God gave us more Revelation amen sometimes it keeps coming and coming on the way up um God gave me a new thought on something that I never realized before in the Bible it was when David the little boy David when came in and said he will go fight this big Philistine you know what Saul did he put his armor and Stu on David his shield and stuff and David wasn't comfortable with it right right David didn't trust in that isn't that exactly what it is in a denom where Creeds and dogmas are formed I never thought of that till this morning I just always thought well David wasn't comfortable in this he wasn't used to this but isn't that exactly what what it does if we add Creeds and dog rules and regulations to our lives and try to make us bit it didn't work where did David have his trust in the Lord amen so he picked up five Stones he took his staff and he went out and the Philistine giant he mocked him didn't he yeah but what happened David said I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts amen that's where our power is brothers and sisters Amen in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's where the power is not stoping thing of this where did that stone hit it hit Goliath right up here in the head where the knowledge is amen he lost his life we can take a lesson to that yes yes sir this is one thing when I used to read the Bible and I think many people do and it was stories it was just one story after another but brothers and sisters the Bible is written for me amen the Bible is written for you can we see ourselves yes right can we see ourselves in every story in the Bible it's written to help us to lead and to guide and to direct usen in the next verse he says and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall lose on Earth shall be loose on Heaven the verse before that it says and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it God is building his church Upon This Rock The Rock is the revelation of the word so that's where he's building his church on so our faith will be in that and the gates of hell and nobody's going to be able to take it away once God reveals something to us nobody can take it away not even the gates the demons from hell cannot even take that away That's How Strong a rock is that's what he's talking about and how important it is to stand on that and we will start believing even that yes what is the number one sin unbelief that's why the children of israels a lot of them didn't enter only Josh and Caleb and the young people entered the land of Canaan because of unbelief yes there's a lot of things lessons to be taken out of the children of Israel's story when they came to the Red Sea what happened do we have Red Seas sometime in our lives yeah things look impossible right but God was with them amen Moses held his staff out over the waters and the waters P separated yes and they could walk through on dry land isn't that something did everybody make it through right the enemy didn't make it right because they didn't believe amen sir so one thing we noticed fast forward as Josh and Caleb it says when the 12 Spies were sent over to inspect the land 10 of them came back with a negative report yes sir didn't they all see the same same thing the same land yes isn't that exactly how it is but Josh and Caleb said if God is with us we can overtake them but the Bible says according to their words this what happened right yes let's remember that our words are powerful amen negative and positive Hallelujah the power is lies in our tongue right death and life yes but the other thing I want to bring out of that it says there was a different there was a different spirit in Josh and KB Hallelujah so I hope that spirit is in each one of us today amen we need that Spirit yeah it'll give us a different Outlook in life how we look at things how we read the Bible Hallelujah so they could enter because they believe so we're struggling life if we're if we're in disbelief we're probably going around in desert like the children of Israel did around and around and we we can't grow we can't move forward so sometimes we got to stop and take inventory why am I doing this what's wrong in my life we've had that happen in our lives already even since we started believing the true word that Satan comes and tries to get us to doubt he brings discouragement or something like that and if you receive it there's only one way to go and that's down maybe you're discouraged maybe you get depressed and then it starts to time to start searching where am I going why am I going down the road like this am I not trusting my maker did I believe a lie somewhere in my life Satan can be so tricky he can get us to to believe a lie I know a brother that he he got freedom and he was doing a lot better than then a person came to him and he said oh you can be careful that you don't be deceived and he believed that lie right but you know what the devil did he didn't put his mind on what he believed he his mind went on other things that he struggled with like with sexual problems and things like that his mind was focused on there and the devil had him trapped yes till one day a person came and prayed for him and helped him and in other words they prayed and God revealed to him what happened where the door was that he believed a liee so he repented the lie and that took care of the other things went away praise the Lord so that's for all of us am we're on a journey one thing I noticed the enemy doesn't have to do anything in our lives if he has us but once we receive the truth the truth will make us free once we receive the truth then he's going to try to stumble us right so what I want to bring out here and and about the Revelation on Upon This Rock I'll build my church we we've noticed already that people that know the scriptures a whole lot better than I do they they TR they know the scriptures they but then they AR they ask question well why this why that and we came to the conclusion that there's no use trying to even tell somebody if they don't want it that's right that's right it says if the only way that we can come to God is if he us so I think the most important important part for me is to pray for people that God will open their eyes open their heart and draw them to him and if he wants us to speak a word let's be available to speak a word or share but let's not be arguing or de debating about the word of God because unless God opens her eyes we cannot see itall how many people are glad this morning that he came to seek and save those that are lost amen I am God's church or bride doesn't look the way I thought it would look years ago yes sir it's sad but if you stop and think when Jesus was here walking on Earth talking to people healing people he was right there in their midst and a lot of people couldn't see it a lot of people couldn't see it but they were going to church they're trying to keep the law yes sir does the law free us absolutely not what's the law good for to reveal to us what sin is yes sir yes sir isn't it yes sir that's what Paul said if it wouldn't been for the law I would have known that covetousness or lust whatever he said is sin that's right so the law is a mirror we can look into the law and the law condemns us but if that's all we see we're still condemned that's right so we need to turn to Jesus amen did Jesus pay for every sin amen isn't that a lie from the devil to try to get us to believe that we have sinned so much we've failed so much that we cannot be forgiven brother that's from the enemy brothers and sisters yes sir good he paid for all sin when Jesus said it is finished it was finished his blood thank you Jesus Hallelujah is that what the Bible says is that true how do we know unless we look into the Bible yes sir it says here in Luke 7 I'll start in verse 36 it said and want the Pharisees writed him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house brought an Alam box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and that wipe them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with ointment two different Spirits right yes sir good a Pharisee spirit and a person that seen I'm a sinner I'm lost and I need jesusall she fell at his feet started weeping and washing jesus' feet Hallelujah doesn't the Bible say we all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God hallelujah amen it does yes and when the Pharisees which were bitten saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touched him for she is a sinner and Jesus answering said unto him Simon I have somewhat to say against thee and he says Master say on and then he said there were certain creditor which had two dectors and one owed 500 pens and the other 50 and when he had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love the most Simon answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgave the most and he said unto him thou H has judged right L isn't that true yes sir if we're in debt if we buy a house or a farm and we go in debt a million dollars or if we're in debt $50,000 and Jesus came and forgave both of them which one will love the most yes sir probably the one that was a million dollars in debt right yes sir but there wasn't much hope for that to get out right unless you had a real good income but take that spiritually and that's who we are Hallelujah without Jesus yes but if we turn to him can we be Saints amen can we be free if Jesus will set us free we will be free indeed right and it says in Hebrews there is a rest for the people of God brothers and sisters that rest can start right today we can rest I think a lot of people in the world today are suffering from sicknesses from back AES from a lot of things because they're not resting in the Lord I truly believe and we've experienced things like that once we started trusting God and rest ing in in God even our bodies start relaxing and things start to change Hallelujah that's right there's so many things there's so many types and stuff in the Bible it just it's just the way it is there's another story I want to touch on that I think is a very important story that will tie into this and that's in John 4 about the woman in John 4:8 it says for his disciples were going away unto the city to buy me then sayith the woman of Samaria unto him how is how is it that thou being a Jew ask a string of me which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans does that sound familiar isn't that how it is today with all these different church group we have no dealings with this church or that church is that the way God wants it to be how many churches does God have amen we've talked about that many times are there going to be different rooms up in heaven for this group or that group because we can't get along with each other down here brothers and sisters I think it's important that we love everybody that we care for everybody yes Hallelujah even if they are our enemies we pray for them yes Hallelujah we love them like God loved them that's a sign that the the love of God is in us we need the Holy Spirit In Our Lives to love our enemies Hallelujah I used to read this as a story Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that sayest to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee Living Water so the woman didn't know who she was talking to isn't that the way it was it's the way it was with me I don't know who how it was with you yes maybe the word of God is living water it refreshes us if we drink of it right if we eat it if we take it in and it says if he that believeth as the scripture says out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water amen so if we believe the true word of God there will be flowing rivers of Living Water from our lives amen yes but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water spring up into Eternal WI the woman says unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw Jesus says unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou Hast well said I have no husbands for thou H has had five husbands and the one that you now has is not the husband does Jesus know everything am amen we cannot hide anything from him that's right she she was on her sixth husband did Jesus condemn her doesn't the Bible say we're not supposed to do that that's right he didn't condemn her he came to save people that were lost hallu I hope we can all think that way we're here to try to help people come to Christ we're not here to condemn people if we got true freedom in our lives I think that's what's going to be coming out of our Lives the woman saith unto him sir I perceive that thou are a prophet our fathers worshiped in the mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem place where men ought to worship Jesus says unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know that we worship for salvation of the Jews the hour cometh and is now when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him and then he says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth am brothers and sisters that's for us we need to worship Him in spirit and in truth and let's not depend on going to church on Sunday and listening to a sermon and Wednesday evening that that'll be enough we got to be in the word of God every day hallelujah amen we like to eat every day right physical body so we better be eating the word of God every day what will happen if we don't what will happen if we don't stay in the word stay in the spirit I can tell you what's going to happen this is what's going to happen in Revelation chapter 3 it says verse 14 and unto the angel of the Church of the leans right the things sayest the amen and the faithful and the true witness beginning of creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art loot wararmored thee out of my mouth so let's not get into that stage that's right God wants people that are on fire for him amen I think we're we're living in a time like never before there's a lot of evil happening a lot of things are happening in the world a lot of things are happening in churches but brothers and sisters I think one secret is he that forsaketh not all that he has cannot be my disciples we got to forsake everything that we have to follow him and brothers and sisters that's a very important thing that we see in our lives once the holy spirit is working in our lives is living within us our desires for Earthly things will start to demish Hallelujah and the spiritual things will start to grow we want more spiritual things we want more spiritual food it is not so important to make another dollar anymore than it used to be amen amen do we want to sit around maybe we got to make this very clear we don't sit around we don't work the Bible says we're supposed to work so we have something to give the needy so we can eat support our families let's not be lazy but brothers and sisters let's not be greedy also yes brother good there's a right way to do there's people that don't want to work but the Bible says if you don't want to work don't eat yes so there is a right way Hallelujah and God knows our hearts yes but I think this in in the Lea H this is what's going to happen a lot of people are going to be loot wararmed say the things uh uh the way the world things are going things are going it's not good that's right but brothers and sisters there's more light there's more light here on the word of God than there ever was before in any age isn't there so that's how where we want to look on the word of God there's light here and Jesus will not lose one of his hallelujah hallelujah there's nobody it says nobody's going to pluck them out of his hand so let's stay with Jesus that's the only place I can encourage you to stay with stay in the word stay with Jesus and it's going to lead you home where we all want to be amen we might have to go through trials through tribulations but let's keep a hold of the Master's Hand it says as many as I love I rebuke and Chase and beel us there for and repent it says behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and S with him and he with me and that's exactly true if we truly want him Jesus will come in what do we need to do we need to believe and we need to repent it says and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ yes and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost how many people want that amen I think we all want that gift of the Holy Spirit yes and it says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches Hallelujah Glory we can read I think it's in Matthew 13 we can read that people have ears and they can't hear that's right they have eyes but they can't see true who does God reveal his secrets to who does he give Revelation doesn't it say I think it's in Matthew 11 he said he reveals it to the babes yeah that's right to the people that can humble themsel and become little as children Hallelujah that's who he reveals himself to he's not here for the high educated people he can't help them Hallelujah they're trying to figure out their way they're trying to make their own way right I think it Peter says and I think James says humble yourself in the sight of God I think we need to Humble ourself and come to jesus' feet amen something I wanted to point out in John 4 about this woman at the well when she recognized that this was the Savior Jesus what did you do she had water pots alone didn't she her water pots and it says she left her water pots yeah that's something that's not easy to do once you're 60 years old leave your old traditions your old the water pots that you used to draw water with to leave that right so this is what I'm seeing once we start believing the word the word starts tearing down the veils in our lives yes the word is more powerful than any Creeds and traditions it starts to take them away so some of the things that we did some of the things we believe were true and some of them weren't true so we need the Holy Spirit the word of God to reveal it Hallelujah what's true and what's false praise God what to get rid of in our lives yes the word of God will do it GL the Holy Spirit if we let it I'm going to go back to U First Kings 17 there's a story here that I've read many times but I didn't realize what it the meaning of everything in here I probably still don't but I got more Revelation it's about the Widow Anala I think we're living in a time when there's spiritual famine in the land there's a spiritual famine in the land brothers and sisters but on the other hand there's a living well there's a living well in this land thank you Lord so we got to search it and see where where is the well who is the well but here in First Kings 17:12 it says and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have a little cake and a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat and die a widow so her husband had died and the only food she had left was a little bit of meal and here comes the prophet and talks to her and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou Hast said make me therefore a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee for thy and for thy son is that a picture of the church today yes yes sir there's not much life left that's right I didn't see this till just in the last week or two God revealed this to me the husband was dead right died so the Widow and her little son and here comes a man doesn't this look very selfish here comes a man and tells this Widow doesn't the Bible say we're to help widows we're to give to them and here comes a man and tells this woman do as you said make a meal what you have left but give to me first so what are we getting out of here there's a serious lesson in here so we got to realize this is a man from God right Elijah is a prophet that's right so she gave him first right we're to have God first in our lives Hallelujah and what happened for thus says the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the Cru of oil fail until the day that the Lord sent this rain upon the Earth and she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the Cru of oil fail according to the word of the Lord yes do we get it according to the word of the Lord so we're going through trials struggles if there's a famine in our life let's do what the word says hallelujah let's believe the word and do what the word says it says which he spake by Elijah and it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman and the Mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him I don't know what God is trying to tell us here in a this year where we live we had a drought that was serious grass quit growing the good thing is we always have water to drink some people had to ha water we had to feed hay to our cows so they have something to eat and the Harvest is not going to be like it usually is in some of the fields the way it looks we might not be harvesting anything so God is trying to get our attention right maybe to trust him that everything will work out okay he'll take care of us if we seek Him First amen we got a lot of rain in the last two weeks we probably got four or five inches it was so wet we were so dry and then it was so wet that our beans soy beans started sprouting on the plant so they're ruined isn't that something maybe we don't need him very long anymore maybe he's coming back soon we don't know but we want to be ready Amen in verse 22 it says and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived and Elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and Elijah said thy son liveth and the woman said to Elijah now by this I know that thou art a man of God and that the word of the Lord is in thy mouth is truth yes so she recognized what Elijah the prophet said was the truth do we believe I think it's wonderful to live in a time when the veil when the Mysteries were revealed in this book Hallelujah it says in the Book of Daniel things were sealed until the end so it all says is it in Amos or Hosea says that the mistress cannot be revealed unless through a prophet so God sent a prophet to reveal things to us and it's wonderful there were a lot of debate Ates already in in the Book of Revelations what this means and what that means and this is a book that we can read it we can study it every day but unless God reveals it and he revealed a lot of things through the prophet that men tried to figure out by themselves but they were wrong yes so it says here in uh Revelation 10 verse 8 it says the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall be bitter it and it shall make thy belly bitter but in it be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people Nations towns and Kings yes so what is he saying I believe what he's saying we are to eat the word of God yes it brings truth it brings life it's sweet we love it if God gives us revelation we love it it's like a revelation is I heard one preacher say one time it's just like a fresh kill of meat an animal we get something to eat it's not something that the vultures eat it's what we want to eat we like to eat good meat right and that's if God reveals gives us a revelation of the word it's some good meat to eat it's not milk it's meatl and sometimes we can eat on a revelation maybe for a week or so before he gives us another one it's it's good stuff good to eat on but what does he mean when he says it's going to be bitter in thy belly so to live it to live the Christian Life sometimes it's bitter right right amen we might have to go through some rejection some suffering does that line up with the word of God it sure does it say Jesus came and he I would think in my mind he came to bring peace in families and everything but this is one thing we see even in in our immediate family it causes divisions when one accepts the truth and the others don't it brings divisions but that's what he said if we don't forsake all that we have father mother son or daughter whoever it is we're supposed to have him first in our life hallelujah amen yes and I think it's like um like it was when the angel came to Mary in Luke 2 I think it is we know that Mary was the chosen virgin to bring Jesus into the world when the angel came to her and said you're going to be with child she didn't know how this is going to happen but the angel said well the Holy Ghost is going to come upon you you and Jesus is going to be born you're going to be the one and what did you do she did she surrendered yes Hallelujah so that's what we are to do in our life we're supposed to surrender and once the Holy Spirit comes into us it's it's a good thing but Mary as the child was growing she started to walk a different life right and that's the way it is with us if we receive the spirit in our Liv lives if we believe the word we're it's going to change us we're going to have a different walk Hallelujah it makes me think of Jacob stop and think all the things that Jacob did he was the elected one right yes but look what all he did he he was a deceiver right yes sir he lied he did all those things yes did we do everything right in our lives absolutely not but the day came when he wrestled with a man didn't he say he was Esau but that night he wrestled he said I won't let you go unless you bless me and then he asked him who art thou and he said I am Jacob yeah so he he told God who he was he was Jacob Hallelujah he wasn't Esau amen so his life changed from that day forward Hallelujah and I think that's how it is in our lives we got to we wrestle with God and we got to surrender we got to repent of things in our lives and this is a wonderful picture here as Mary as she walked it was bitter in her belly but that's the way it is with us this life is is is actually it's a good life it's not always roses flowers maybe but it's the only life the word of God lives in US Jesus the Holy Spirit and this is something that I see if we try to live a Godly life by rules and regulations we're going to be walking blind in darkness it says in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 it says for ye in verse two ye are our Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifested declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by us un written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tles of stone but in fleshly taplet of the heart and trust and such trust have we through Christ to God word not that we are sufficient ourselves seeing anything of ourself but our sufficiency is of God who also has made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kill us but the spirit give us life amen amen isn't that true Hallelujah I just love to experience the freedom in Christ I love to go to church and not have any rules and regulations except the spirit I think it's like a tree sometimes a tree is hollow on the inside you can walk up to it and it might look okay on the outside but on the inside it is hollow so if we don't have the spirit of God on the living on the inside we're just Hollow like a tree yes but once the spirit is on the inside it will start producing and give true life so the word the law just keeps us Hollow the spirit can't work it that was with Moses as in verse 13 it says and not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remainest the veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which which the veil is done away in Christ for even unto this day when Moses read the veil us upon their heart nevertheless listen what he says nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away amen amenallah that's so true now the spirit now the Lord of that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty yes isn't that true Hallelujah so what I want to bring out if the true spirit of God is within us we're not going to go and live like the world and live like the devil that's right Amen in Galatians 5 I think it says we if we are set free don't use your Liberty as an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another amen and I love to go to church with people that are in love in tune with god with the Holy Spirit and that are here to help each other if a brother or sister is struggling or Falls in sin we're here here to pray for the person to help him up lift him to Christ and not to condemn the person or to talk about the person behind his back stabing stabbing a knife in her back or anything like backbiting doesn't the Bible talk about backbiting sure does we don't need to live in a world like that we're here to help each other that's the love of God in our lives amen now where the spirit now now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with an open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord so what changes us amen the spirit of God changes us so who gets the honor God does hallelujah amen there's no room for pride in our life no room because God does the work in our life he cleans us praise the Lord another example is Rahab the Bible says Rahab was a harlot her house was on the wall when the spies came to inspect the land she received them right The Messengers she received the word a lot of people today aren't receiving the message what the message had to say I've been accused of following a man right I did that in my life earlier yes but not now that's right am amen you know what I tell people about this Prophet God talks through a prophet right his Spirit yes we can see it in Paul we can see it in Elijah I tell people the prophet to me came to shine a flashlight a light on the word of God God amen amen I'm not following the prophet that's right I'm following the spirit but it was God's way to reveal it to us that's right Hallelujah but you know who's going to receive it the true seedall the true seed the True Believers will receive it thank you Lord it's just like it was and all the way back some people received the word and some didn't so thank God that he put a seed in our hearts hallu thank God Hallelujah it's like Brother Kyle shared already like a pine tree if you have a pine tree with all the branches down low nothing's growing underneath it why cut off the lower branches and let the sun shine in there things start to grow right yes sir yes grass weeds whatever start to grow who put the seat there it was there all the time isn't that the way it is with us once the light strikes once the Holy Spirit touches our heart if we respond things start to grow in our lives amen that's the way it is thank you Jesus thank you so brothers and sisters I encourage you all stay in the word amen let the spirit of God lead you am we're not to worry about what people think what people say but what God says amen let's align ourselves with the word of God and let's pray that he'll give us Revelation let's seek him we need to die to self and keep walking with him there's another story in Genesis 24 about Isaac wanted a wife so he sent aaser to get a wife for him so he went over and I'm just going to make this short but there's a lot in here there's a lot in here isn't that what Jesus wants he wants a bride yes Hallelujah so he sent a messenger to get the bride so when when the aler came over there to the well he he prayed if a woman would come out to the well to give him water and she did Rebecca came out and she gave him water and she said not just him but she gave water she Drew water for the 10 camels so this was something special about this woman she was truly surrendered to draw water how much water did she draw for all these camels I've been told a camel can drink up to 25 50 gallons of water and she she Drew water for 10 of them so this woman was girl was dedicated wasn't she she was willing to surrender all was she willing to go back with this servant yes she was she went back with elaser to Isaac and this is how we should be once this word once this Spirit strikes us are we willing to go or are we going trust stay with our family or with our denomination I encourage us let's go as the spirit lead us amen she she forsook all to go meet her bridegroom brothers and sisters the hour is close and let's be faithful and let's trust him like Joshua and Caleb let's take all the land isn't that let's take let's receive all the word of God not just part of it let's receive all the land and get rid of the enemies amen amen well it's 5 minutes after 11 10 or 12 I think I'm going to leave it with this thank you for your prayers I only know a few people here but that's okay I know we all have a desire to be with the Lord in eternity sir thank you Jesus let's bow our heads for prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for your Holy Spirit we thank you for opening our eyes Opening Our Hearts we thank you Lord that you paid price for our sins we thank you that you resurrect that we can have life and they we can have it more abundantly thank you Jesus we ask that you would lead and guide and direct us as we go through life Lord we pray for people our enemies that don't like us the people that are walking in darkness that you just pour your spirit on them Lord and draw them to you Lord thank you for this and thank you for this group here we ask that you would bless everyone here and help us that we can trust you and be faithful the rest of our lives we pray this in your holy name amen
