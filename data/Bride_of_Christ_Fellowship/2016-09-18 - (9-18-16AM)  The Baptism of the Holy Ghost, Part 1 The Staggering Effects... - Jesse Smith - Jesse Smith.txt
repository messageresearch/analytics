Applause iate he can put up someone like me I don't know that just proves he's got a great gift in his life amen let's go to Acts chapter 2 praise God Acts chapter 2 verse one I've been really feeling led to preach on the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I'd like to start that Series this morning part one I'd like to call it the Staggering effects of the Holy Ghost I like to start with there by God's grace The Staggering effects of the Holy Ghost and I've had a few vindications all although the one on my heart has been the most important God had a brother from Ghana two Wednesdays ago travel all the way from Ghana to come preach a message called the assessment for oil assessment is a test I'm a teacher I give assessments all the time the test for the oil and I just announced the Wednesday before I feel led to preach on the Holy Ghost series and here God sends a man all the way over across the ocean to preach there's going to be a sess for oil I Christ Fellowship thank you Lord Jesus amen how much he cares about us amen praise God so I'd like to maybe take three or four sermons or series sermons rather in a series and preach on this by the grace of the Lord Acts chapter 2 please verse one I want to look at the effects of what the Holy Ghost produces first so um we know what it sounds like what it looks like when the Holy Ghost comes I think we've all you know well maybe not I know some of us have uh been in atmospheres like that for our younger brothers they not quite sure so I definitely want to lay it down for them and all of us by God's grace because it's prophecy that it must return every now and then we thank God that it does uh come but it's going to come for a final time in the latter Reign so it's prophesied it's thus say the Lord from the prophet and in the Bible so I want to I really feel like it's it's crucial and uh now's a good time for that amen that's what I believe so that's why I'm feeling LED right now acts chap 2 verse1 now if we can um let's read verse one let's read one verse one together on three one two three and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord and in one place I'll read verse two and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a in Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where where they were sitting so God comes as an eternal spirit but the wind fills the whole house so God isn't everywhere God is a being brother Bram said he's not in the tree although he gave life to the tree but God's not dwelling in the tree God's a being and so God came to come down and fill the whole room praise God Amen like a wind like a sound of a rushed Mighty Wind verse three and there appeared unto them clo and tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them let's read verse four together let's begin 1 2 3 and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance verse five and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because every man heard them speak in his own language they heard them in their own language verse eight I'm sorry seven rather and they were all amazed and marled saying one another behold are not all these which speak galileans let's read verse eight together one two three and how hear we every man in our own tongue where and we were born let's have word of prayer bow your head have a KN on your heart let let it be known to the Lord maybe somehow through bow head a hand rais or something like that surely God loves us surely feel God's guiding us into this subject here by God's prise Lord in heaven you're so wonderful it's so wonderful to sing your Praises worship is pleasant as we saw on Wednesday it's calmly for us lord it's so important Lord God to worship you Lord for it it it cast doubts away cast down Spirits Lord out of our mind and we can feel refreshed so we're thankful for the gifts of God in the church like brother Loris and different musicians and song specials we're grateful for those type of musical gifts Lord that that bring the power of God and help transform our minds Lord each day Lord especially on the worship days father take this word I truly feel Lord this is Led of you and I just want to be your servant this morning I just want to be faithful Lord God to the the burdens you've impressed Upon My Heart Lord youve called me to be Pastor here a pastor guides the Sheep Lord and points the Sheep to Still Waters and Green Pastures well I want to do that again this morning I want to point the Sheep I want to guide the Sheep Lord God to Ste Waters a place of refreshing a place of of green pasture a place where there's plenty to Feast upon and father that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost we thank you for that and help me Lord God and help your people as we look for thy coming in Jesus Christ's Name Church said amen amen God bless you being see there praise God it's good to see the Saints morning God bless everybody good be the house of the Lord praise the Lord uh I have a slideshow brother bang I've had trouble the last few weeks here I said a prayer I'm I ask the Lord to help help this will work can we do the HDMI here I just want to show the slides I think you gave me a note we changed it so now it's I don't want to show the quotes by God's grace amen for some reason it kicked me off a few Sunday nights ago and it always grees me to see the TV posters the movie posters and nonsense like that um so I just ask the Lord please help us I got to get something new we'll have to do that by God's grace I want to preach a series here on the baptism of the Holy Ghost uh for the person who wants to go in the Rapture this is the mo most important subject that we have KCK me out it's a ticket to the Rapture I don't know why it does that didn't kick off brother Gabe when he was here and he used it so I don't know by God's grace I guess we'll just get going here and if it just keeps doing that we'll just get rid of it I just you know like I since I'm a pastor I like I like for you to see the quotations and in the in future sermons I'm going to actually be playing some audio from Brother brandom's actual sermons so you can hear what it's like uh when the the Holy Ghost Falls I think it's so critical to do that by God's grace so part one I just want to look at the Staggering effects of the Holy Ghost we going to start seeing what it's like I know I know a couple people if not a few are searching for the Holy Ghost in our congregation amen and uh in that a wonderful thing brother said you're more blessed than anybody else in the world just to want it just to want it the gift of God the Eternal seal of God in your soul you're one of the most blessed people on the whole earth amen right Hallelujah so uh there could be hardly more important sermons other than we say outside of salvation but what I'm saying is this is a major the Holy Ghost is a major just like salvation's a major they're both major so they're both critical uh for us here so uh I didn't get to the next slide I had some I was looking for the quotes I didn't find them so I'm just going to skip that there's some quotes in 1960 where he's talking about the jab burn and tongues and we'll get to that hopefully next time he describes what it sounded like on the day of Pentecost so I want to uh go over what the prophet said it sounds like but are we read our text here 1 through eight and uh I want to start by reviewing a few things by God's grace uh the Lord willing um also want to say you know I want to kind of follow up from Wednesday night if you didn't get a chance to listen to Wednesday night's message I hope you will I really tried to labor on the importance of coming to church praise God and uh uh I think I feel it's really important in this hour that we uh come to church every time the doors are open if possible praise God we understand that people are sick or something like that and so forth like that but but brother brandom said attend every service and a prophet said says that and I want to do it by God's grace uh the Bible said brother B says that we must gather more as we see that day approaching and it's hard for a church like ours it's hard if we're all spread out it's hard for us to kind of gather maybe during the week or the weekends uh so one time we can gather is at least twice on Sunday uh and uh I've recently felt led uh you know maybe we won't do as many Saturday night services you know we'll try to just do two on Sunday or something like that because it is hard uh you know I offer people I've offered on the emails if anyone needs a hotel I'm happy to pay for the hotel so you can stay Saturday night Sunday but sometimes people uh maybe don't want to uh don't want to accept that gift or whatever more and that's fine you know people are feel they could be feel free to however they feel led to or however they feel to be led that's fine with them but to me it's just so critical um to be in the house of God every time the doors are open praise the Lord and uh as we set through the scripture that's that was a FR Revelation that came to me when we don't come uh we forsake the assembling and then we we uh we lose the influence that we can have on others in the church because the Bible said we edify and we strengthen and we provoke others when we come and gather physically you phys just physically being here you provoke or Inspire other people to serve God better how many can say Amen to that if you're not here you can't do that and if you don't want to do that something's wrong with you because this is the body of Christ we're going to heaven who doesn't want to help and influence the body of Christ who doesn't want to inspire the body of Christ oh my I want to by God's grace I want to inspire the body of Jesus Christ I want to be a strength to them if I see someone with help I want to go help them praise God because this is God's body and remember Paul said he said many are sick and weakly among you because you didn't discern the Lord's body there it is right there just came to me right there amen you don't judge you don't treat the Lord's body the right way it's so crucial so uh I'm growing as a pastor like I said I needed to apologize to the church I kind of challenged the church two Wednesdays ago I said I challenge you to come to prayer and fasting and later I felt that wasn't the right thing to do so forgive me um I know the Holy Ghost does give challenges but I felt in my heart at that time I wasn't in the right spirit I was a little upset so I hope you'll forgive me by God's grace brother Brandon you ask for forgiveness when he sins you know uh three four four Wednesdays ago we preached on brother BR he asked the church to forgive of a critical spirit and he said I still have it so pray that I'll get delivered so he lets them know I've got a sin in my life I got a complex you pray for me I'm still going to preach but pray for me that it leaves that's that's quite that's quite a thing right there uh God works with us in the midst of our complexes praise God hallelujah how merciful god is and that's my prayer help help me and my human struggles not to hinder the move of the Holy Ghost praise God so I just feel it's important and critical um if brother brandom said it I want to try to do by God's grace I do it with all my heart if the Bible says it I want to do that so uh if you haven't listened to that please do it I think it was a real word from the Lord I really do by his grace now I want to start here a little bit of this is review I remember when uh sister Megan and Sister Amy come up uh in April I preached on the bride and the Book of I'm sorry the bride and the day of Pentecost sister Meg you remember that by God's grace and you said you and Amy the whole way to church he talked about uh I don't know if you remember or not but I went and looked at the and you you both told me after service we were just talking about all those things on the way to church about how does the day of Pentecost fit with the bride of today and so I had the sermon and uh I was so blessed I I appreciate that by God's grace it's nice to know when when God discerns people's hearts you know and and helps people so a few of these first quotations will be about that uh a few of those things I want to just lay this down uh the Holy Ghost experience we just read about is the same today it is not different it's the same praise God uh because of this after the Holy Ghost fell on Cornelius and a bunch of Gentiles Peter goes back to the Jews and he says Brothers as I began to speak the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning that's how he knew it was the same because they acted the same amen they did the same thing they got filled with the Holy Ghost so Peter said I seen it once and now I see it again and I can recognize the filling of the Holy Ghost amen the falling of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah let me say like this the prophet understood it how it could be the same every time the prophet Peter and so did brother brandom amen he could recognize when it fell Hallelujah now here's what he says in the to in the pardon message 1963 if the blood applied the token see there's a token given of the blood and that's the Holy Spirit and when the Holy Spirit came down the day of Pentecost you know what it did to the people we just read it and every time that it will ever fall I'm sorry ever will come upon on the people it'll do the very same thing for Peter said the promises unto you your children all them that are called even as far as many as the Lord Our God shall call so let's say very same ready very same so the very thing we read if it falls this morning it'll be the very same thing praise God Sinners that would look at us would say oh they're a bunch of drunk people Glory now I say hallelujah let me be drunk on the Holy Ghost I don't want to be drunk on the world do you I don't I don't want to be drunk on alcohol I don't want to be be drunk in my sorrow I don't want be drunk In My Pride I don't want to be drunk in any of those things uh God said there's such a thing as a Spirit of Slumber that people are drunken with they go to sleep on God spiritually I don't know if it ties with the physical or not it might but they spiritually go to sleep and he said they're drunken with the Spirit of Slumber the Bible said so we don't want to be drunken with that we want to be alert how many our children of the day praise God I'm not a child of the night I'm a child of the day I'm alert during the daytime praise God Amen I'm not trying to wander around in the night time into darkness and sin I'm trying to be a Child of the Light amen different quote now I read this one too if you remember in April if not then you'll be blessed again amen and I heard brother Dwayne Lawson preaches recently which was a huge blessing uh I've inviting him to come but he's I guess looking for some time in his schedule we as the modern Church what any of these here screaming shouting tongue speaking acts 238 youngans around here so the denominational churches don't want the real Acts 2 experience they might want loud music or shouting or dancing but that's not the same as a surrendered life to God that's filled with the Holy Ghost it's different amen it has to be different she don't want any of them whooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah why such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination okay repeat after me say w ooping readying say cry cry say screaming screaming that's what brother random said it was amen now listen I've been guilty in the past for one to see that every single service and I've had to apologize to the church because I you know as I read these quotes I didn't have enough discernment at the time I was just a young preacher you know 27 or whatever 26 I was so I was just and brother John knows he was here brother bang knows that I would just preach like it had to be every service and if it wasn't every service something's wrong and uh I got had to correct me on that by God's grace I'll say it like this if we're not having this from time to time something is wrong praise God something is wrong and I and I don't know the time to time I don't know if that's months I don't know if that's a year I don't know if that's two years I'll say like this if we're not experiencing the presence of Christ we'll get a little cold in our walk with God Amen so that's what that's what I've had to learn as a preacher just being very honest and I try to be transparent and very very uh sincere he keeps going so the denominational churches are pregnated with something because they're they're bringing forth members all the time but but she don't want none of them screaming say screaming scre hollering say hollering now how about this one blabber how about let's say that ready blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures that she thinks they are Oh Glory it would certainly embarrass now remember denominational churches they get in the spirit all kinds of things like that there must be a difference then between just the anointing and the real Holy Ghost filling right Hallelujah I was raised in Pentecostal churches I seen people shout speak in tongues dance and go out and live like demons I see in the message churches right so how you live proves what happened when the Holy Ghost fell was it just a pre temporal anointing or was it a real filling a real change of the individual amen because look if the Holy Ghost would really fall in a denomination it would ruin the denomination it would ruin their educational system all of a sudden they'd say we don't need our our uh we don't need our seminaries anymore if the real Holy Ghost fell praise God it would ruin all their organizations and intellectualism and their ethical scientific Society Church that she belonged to here so see the real Holy Ghost filling is a different experience than just the anointing just being happy remember I preached on that last winter brother there are two types of anointings there's one that's a real presence of God he said that's where you feel like you're going to die and he said there's one that's like bubble dancing he said that's just for blessings and we thank God for the blessings I almost took around and danced all the way around up here during song service I was said oh Lord help me Jesus maybe I should have maybe I'll do it at the end I don't know but I feel so good today praise the Lord I feel his presence I feel near to the Lord amen I feel refreshed I feel revived amen by God's grace that's what prayer does amen hallelujah so all denominations will look at real Holy Ghost worship and say ah we don't need all that they would throw her out the next Council she can't have the real Holy Ghost baptism so she don't want to be pregnated with the word word because that's the only kind let's say that together ready the only kind the word can bring forth this is a a month and a little a few days before he died and here he is preaching in Louisiana a visible Union the bride but this is the only kind the preaching of the message will produce praise God this kind of Acts 238 screaming shouting hollering blabbering acts 238 young amen so that's what we expect when someone gets born again praise God Amen and I'm going to move later on and show what it actually means why do they blabber uh why do they scream why do they shout we're going to find out Lord winning in a minute by God's grace of course you child's being born but there's also something else spiritually that's going on there there's something spiritually going on that's why people aren't ashamed to act that way Hallelujah amen same sermon born of the spirit it has to be the spirit of God in it no intellectual Church join in Creed going bobbed hair pain of face there is no such thing as that all the all of it you don't find that in the word of God you find an oldfashioned Sanctified Holy Ghost filled child born of the spirit of God screaming Hing shouting praising God so when someone gets the Holy Ghost this is what we should hear by God's grace why because God just came down to live in them in a way he's never lived in them before amen glory God has taken residence in the house he's in the house is that right death has to flee amen now there's life where Darkness used to be you got a new person living with you now now he's living in your soul not just on your flesh not just uh in your mind but now he's living in your soul praise God now it's a seal now it's a mark As we were teaching in Sunday school this morning now you're marked to the day of your Redemption he writes he inscribes his word uh you are mine you're sealed you're marked until the day of redemption amen hallelujah I get have you I laugh a little bit forgive me and another notice what kind of children she's buing okay so think about that what kind of Believers are the denominational churches producing what kind of Life do they produce well they produce a life that will wear sexy clothes still right wear makeup they produce a life of men that set up to their wives right live and live a Godly life right still want to go to movies and still do to all kinds of evil things like that thinking about men you know that I meet uh especially at my school that's what I'm thinking about right now they tell that tells what their papa is whether it's the first Adam or the second Adam so everybody's born of one father amen they're either born of the first Adam which was death or the second Adam which is a quickening spirit if the church brings forth a child of the second Adam he acts the second Adam's way of acting like they did on the day of Pentecost that's the real true second Adam's children see right their nature is like his and hers amen how would they act when someone gets born again they'll act just like Acts chapter two praise God that's how they will act because God acts the same way in everybody amen hallelujah now there's little variations as we'll get to there's little variations between the actions but the ACT is a we'll get to a worship here rejected King 1960 remember this is the first time he preached beyond the current of time and he got that title rejected King from scoffield so a prophet can pull inspiration from just a we say a theologian I'll say it like that a scribe he pulls inspiration preaches the rejected King on Christ being rejected as King David being rejected as king and the same Holy Ghost up found the day of Pentecost which we all know that that was the birth of the new church if that same Holy Spirit don't bring the same experience to you then you got a different Holy Spirit than what that was so what do we say if you just get emotional but you can't live the life uh like we see a lot in denominations then the Holy Spirit came in a different way it only came on your flesh or maybe your spirit it didn't come down into your soul amen is that right Church same experience a different Holy Spirit falling it's a falling on the the body it's a falling upon the mind but not upon the soul amen if that don't make you live a what kind of life let's say that together a sacrificial life and not sacrificing what we think we need to sacrifice but sacrificing what God tells us to sacrifice it produces a sacrificial life and a life full of what joy and pleasure and the baptism of the spirit leading you into signs and wonders and miracles and things oh my it leads you into that and then when it leads into you right then these things follow you praise God Amen there's something happened Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe you like these quotations from a man from a prophet of God Amen it's beautiful it must be the same experience you must act in the same way and it will produce a life of sacrifice that means you're not living for what yourself anymore what you would like to do you can't do anymore because you have to sacrifice that and you have to do what God has called you to do praise God so not just well say I sacrifice and I go to church that's good but how about during the week what does God want you to sacrifice during the week amen hallelujah amen a life of that means some sacrifice something has to die praise God something has some desire you have has to die and God his will has to be first in your life let me read this quote because I just felt led i i subl a PA in this quote this morning I think I I think you'd like to hear it if I were you I want to hear it that's why I think I'm going to read it brother said this in Balman Gilead 1959 as I was speaking on the private interviews today and met a couple a man and the son so a man and the son I said you can never never go forward until you're perfectly satisfied and know without a shadow of doubt you're walking in God's will how many want to go forward this morning you and I cannot go forward until we have no doubt what the will of God is for our life amen what what will happen if you don't know you're wondering this for a while wonder wonder this for a while wonder that you're wanding wandering wondering wandering is not a good thing for a child of God wandering is not good good for sheep and the Sheep said wondering is not a good thing for sheep sheep need to know where they need to be praise God said you will never go forward with Christ until you know exactly what you're supposed to do how do you know what you're supposed to do well brother M said you can work either way you see you can work like Gideon and ask for signs or you can sit there and let God just sit there and receive the word of God and accept the word of God with faith drop it in your heart he said you can work one of either way and he said God will work with you whichever way you choose listen in the 1960 uh series on adoption that's where he says it he said God will work with you in any way you're built anything you need God will give it like my brother Simon and I we're we need signs we need to lay fleeces before the Lord and we need to see God give us a please and then I can say hallelujah right but some people are't that way they don't ask God for signs they they we say like they don't put God to the test with a vow they just they're not built that way but whichever way you're built you need to to find what you're supposed to do in this life amen because remember if you don't know the will of God Jesus said you might be lost because Jesus said they said Lord Lord have we not done this and he said you haven't done the will of God only those who will do the will of God enter the kingdom of God Amen now God's grace is that you can do the will of God the last few moments of your life and still go to heaven like the thief on the cross that's God's grace but that's not the will of God I want to live amen that's right I want to find out as soon as I can to know God's will walk in it do it sacrifice everything that would try to pull me and distract me away and do have a laser vision and be centered in be zeroed into the target of God and know exactly what I'm supposed to do and do it with joy in my heart with full of joy and pleasure and Lead Me into signs Miracles and wonders that's the kind of life I want to live amen Glory Hallelujah I thought you might like that well the cod's not done so bear with me then when you know you're in God's Will and walking in his way nothing can stop you it's you're Invincible because you know where you're standing you know the way you're going you know what's you've got in your mind you know what the will of God is and then you can do it now sister Amy's not here she thought told me she was going to be out today um but she asked me one time you know she said can you preach on the gifts of the Spirit and I preached on Jesus gifts of the Spirit but then I heard a good quote I'd forgotten about so I want to share that this morning brother brand said the way to know your gift now I don't want to get gift before the baptism of Holy Ghost baptism the Holy Ghost is first but for those of us who say we got it I'm just going to add this in here this morning brother said they ask how do you know you're called to preacher how you know you got a gift he said because you can do it I'm gonna say that again how do you know you have the gift of tongues because you can do it Hallelujah isn't that so simple how do you know you got to get to prophesy because you do it that's how brother said you know you're a preacher you do it you preach amen amen is that right how you know you got the GI of knowledge I give knowledge that's anoint of the Holy Ghost how do you know you got to get the wisdom God gives me wisdom for people and it's anointed to the Holy Ghost and it helps them out that's how I know God is not going to ask you to do something that he hasn't equipped you to do praise God so I I take that quote I apply it to my life how do I know I'm a pastor because I do it I've stood here for 10 years recently I'll just share this just I'm going to go very very superficial recently I one of my closest friends tell me they no longer feel led to be a pastor because they've had two mental breakdowns in numerous years of being a pastor so they resigned recently for being a pastor and now they're going to the field of evangelism I said praise the Lord this is a wonderful man of God one of the finest men of God I know so you might not have heard about it yet because I think they're just they don't feel led to share with everybody but that's fine I that's respectful but I know a little bit inside information so I'm going to share that with you because I think it'll help you this person saw I tried to passor for years but when I couldn't handle the pressure I realized I wasn't called to be Pastor it hurt his family it it made his family struggle so here now listen here he's trying to do a gift or trying to think he has a gift trying it for years and years and years but seeing it really struggles the family it's not a blessing i to the family necessarily but it brings leads to breakdowns I've been sting here 10 years without a mental breakdown Glory that me I can do it by his grace are you with me Church you understand what I'm saying understand that try to understand that by God's grace I had passed out one time but that's because I was I was foolish and trying to go without without faith for healing and John caught me bless his heart oh praise the Lord but you see I never had a breakdown where feel like I wanted to quit when God's called you to do something he gives you the grace to do it you know the word gift means Charisma you know where they get that word charismatic comes from that's the Greek word for gift and that means ability or that means power someone has a gift to Pastor someone has a gift to to prophesy you've got the power already you just need the anointing in the timing of God Amen is that right that's how you know I'm not trying to get the car before the horse don't get I'm just saying for some of you who say we got the Holy Ghost then we should be doing something with some type of gift praise God and I'm G to hold you accountable because you say you believe the message and I want you to hold me accountable because I preach the message so we all hold hold each other accountable don't we amen if you see sin in my life come talk to me about it if I see sin in yours I should come talk to you about it praise God now we're starting to do like Jesus said now it's starting to be the real church is that right that's why I called the prayer and fasting time and Lord willing I'll do that again if the Lord leads me I just really felt inspired to do that I don't see Jose here here so I need to pray for his grandson brother BR said they act the same way all the way around the world whenever the holy Holy Ghost Falls here's a man who went seven times around the world he knew something about the Holy Ghost when it fell praise God just like Peter oh oh this is just like that oh pray I I feel something here amen I feel there's some power here there's some Glory here amen said this is that praise God this is that again Peter could have said 1961 I noticed Down in Africa the other countries where I've been some of those people wouldn't even know which is right left hand but you know what happens when they get the Holy Ghost what they do the same thing you do when you get the Holy Ghost act the same way they will speak with tongues praise God how many love that Africans act the same way Americans do when the Holy Ghost Falls I'm so thankful for that Hallelujah now I'm talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost here talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost not just anointing you know to refresh you or whatever more uh I'm talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost talking about when God comes down to dwell in you his anointing is in your soul and now brother said it's like uh he said it's it's h i can't think of it's in thirst 1965 he say it's like a a timer or like a uh blinker or something like that it blinks or it it uh it it it makes a movement every time sin comes around praise God and he said it protects your life I can't think of the actual word there the Holy Ghost is God's life in you God's spirit in you and it gives you the discernment that you need praise God to recognize sin and overcome it praise God because a holy ghost filed Christian can live a way higher life than a foolish virgin amen the wise can live so wise above the foolish Hallelujah that's one thing I never got to but if you're interested in Reading you need something to read I read Proverbs and what I like to do is go through Proverbs and find all there's I mean there's how many scriptures and Proverbs that talk about they contrast wise and foolish I thought my that'd be so good for a sermon on the wise and foolish virgin it totally shows the contrast this is Abraham this is a lot amen hallelujah Glory Hallelujah this is a David and this is a Saul are you with me church you can see it it it helps gives you Grace and helps you give you signs to know that you're on the right Road amen so in Africa they act the same way when the Holy Ghost Falls as in akan Ohio hallelujah thank you Jesus you just whenever the people in them Heathen countries receive the Holy Ghost they act just like anybody else no matter where it's that it shows it's for whosoever Will May Come remember revelation 22 the spirit of the Bride say whosoever will let him come and drink of the Waters of Life freely Hallelujah now this is what I was talking about with sister Megan and sister um Amy I preached this back in April I don't remember who is here I'm sorry if you weren't but I want to just review this real quick brother Brandon said we must go back to Acts chapter 2 before we go up that's why I'm saying this is so important I want to start getting in your mind that our church or whatever Church you feel that later to go to wherever we got to be a church that has the Holy Ghost amongst us if not then we need to pray and confess our sin and have more prayer and fasting times praise God because this is prophecy this is thus sayi the Lord Brother baram said we got to have this before we go up amen now this is thus sayi the Lord he says it twice in her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back so remember I said you got to go back before we can go up you got to go back to Pentecost to where they were at the beginning that is thus sayith the lord it's thus sayith the Lord because Joel 2:23 to 26 does anybody remember last Sunday what was brother Dale's text Sunday morning anybody remember it was Joel 2 18 to 26 does anybody remember that nobody remember that that's all right but as a pastor that struck me man and he didn't read this quote but this is what brother Ram said he mentioned the oil and wine remember that he mentioned oil and wine last Sunday morning we've got to go back to acts two before we go up amen says this in CH three of the church age book he that have to ear let him hear what the spirit say to the churches now I'm sorry how trag tragic it is that the first age did not listen to the spirit instead it listen to man but thank God in the last age there will be a group rise up the true Bride of the last day she will listen to The Spirit Well the spirit already just told us where we're going we're going back to the beginning Amen in that day day of gross Darkness the light will return by the pure word so i' I've got a commission to preach the pure word that brother bambro and we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus amen hallelujah we must go back before we go up and welcome him back amen are you with me church but God is g to have a brid tree this is 1964 all the korm eat caterpillar eat all restore sayith the Lord Malachi 4 tells will be brought back to the original Faith like it was on the day of Pentecost the Faith of Our Fathers we believe that it will come I believe it's time for it now praise God the wheat seed goes back what is it what's the whole point of the wheat seed to reproduce the same seed that went into the ground amen is that right Hallelujah that's what this message will produce but it's got to have the right kind of ground to fall on and that's our heart condition Hallelujah that wheat plant is going to reproduce seed Again The Original Seed the same seed that went down the same saints that died the same life they had is going to be reproduced in the seed at the end time at Harvest Time amen the Shu will pull away the Pentecostal are pulled away all these things like that sometimes I wonder if they're shucking the message I don't know but it's going to pull away if there's anything that's not seed it's going to pull away from the seed because it's not the seed but the seed will be seed the seed will have the same life they'll act the same way the same experience the same God the same love the same power the same Grace oh the same worship it'll be the same thing because it's the same seed now this is the quote brother Dale even mentioned last week but when I preached in April I tried to I tried to bring a little bit different angle to it we can't stumble at this one quote there's one quote in the message and I searched the message uh there's one quote where he says the word for the day of Pentecost won't work today but you've got to take that into into context now watch let's seek to understand the word of the hour now look at the sermon this is an invisible Union that is the sermon I just read you how the word can only produce acts 238 speaking tongues unions right there's only one kind so in the same sermon at the end of the sermon he's saying the word that fell in the day of Pentecost will not work for this day but he just said thus say the Lord we got to go back to the beginning so what we need is an understanding how many need an understanding of that remember this is just one quote but I think it's of course it's right but I need to balance it out you have to understand this quote because it's in the same sermon he said we need acts 238 tongue speakers and that's the only kind they'll produce in this day amen no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride going home with the bride we got something different the Pentecostals represented that again we're in the bride age no more than the word of Noah the work in the days of Moses now here's what I brought out back in April for those who heard it God did the same and the remnant of the woman seed that was left upon the Earth today is the calling out of the Bride out of the church The Exodus for the Rapture for the church truly goes through the tribulation period as you Pentecostal Brothers has preached it I believe that the church goes through it but not the bride so we must understand this the first EX this brother Bram said was the Israel from a natural land into another natural land praise God the second Exodus brother BR said was a church out of a spiritual condition a Creed condition into he said a spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost condition amen hallelujah amen so the first was natural out of natural into a natural the second one was a bad spiritual into the real spiritual and now the last one is from the real spiritual Holy Ghost into the next Dimension praise God into the next life amen say it like that Hallelujah into the marriage supper of the Lamb we'll say like that or the meeting in the air it's a change of Dimension Hallelujah that's the Third Exodus now why couldn't they make this Exodus because it why can't they why couldn't they make this Exodus in their day because it wasn't the word for their day their word was to go from a spiritual condition of creed into a holy ghost experience we're enjoying today amen so he said the word that fell at Pentecost will not work today why because the word that fell at Pentecost what did Peter say the word was this is that which Joel said and it was verses 28-32 but brother B comes along and said the Rapture of the church the refilling of the Holy Ghost is in different verses that's why the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work for today because we have a different word it's another refilling of the Holy Ghost but it's refilling to give power for Rapture and we have this scripture as well along with many other scriptures about the Rapture I just didn't want to fill them in you can fill them in 1 Corinthians 15 you can keep going all you want you can do Enoch scriptures whatever you want to do so you see so you see how that we have a different word than the day of Pentecost brother bang is that can you see that okay all right it's a different word it's different scriptures if we just look at Joel 228 to 32 there's no Rapture in there but the Rapture is in Joel 2:23 because that scripture is about the Harvest and the Rapture is Harvest Time amen praise God so don't let that one quote stum you I've seen preachers take that quote and take all the emotion out of the church and now people can't they won't let the anointing get on their Spirit right they won't let they won't let the anointing let them get emotional worship God God when many times that brings you Deliverance when you get emotional praise God because God's spirit couldn't flow through your emotions but now since you surrendered or believed now the Holy Spirit can flow through your emotions amen so just Joel 22-32 will not work today we we need more than that we need the verses 23- 26 and the Rapture scriptures that have not been fulfilled by other Church ages that's how that makes sense and that's to me that's the only way that makes sense because we have other thus say the Lord quotes that say thus sayi the Lord sh the fullness of Pentecost just like at the beginning right we it's thus say the Lord all the years of cater caterpillar the canker worm Palmer worm all these things all that he said I'll restore all those years sayith the Lord amen now here's what the reality of it is and if you're you really got the Holy Ghost this morning you long for a constant return to the Holy Ghost baptism or refilling you long for that if you're born again now see I had that longing when I was hurting the church God forgive me I had that longing and my Zeal at up my wisdom I was wanting to see it so much that it became too much I feel like I was trying to force the people to get there and that was wrong I'm glad God show me my mistakes amen so I can do better but said if you're not learning constantly something's wrong with you if you're not because then you're not growing only way to grow is get pruned right yeah then you can produce more fruit so we need to be pruned uh and so we we want to love each other amen now a month before brother Brandon died he said this I know that each of you if you feel like I do I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God moving it Grieves me when I don't see the spirit of God moving in my life amen and it makes me hungry to see it is that is that how you feel he's so hungry here's a man who's seen in South Africa he'd seen he seen a parade of people walking down with a truckload full of uh crutches and wheelchairs remember that quote singing only believe he longed to see the spirit of God moving again oh my hallelujah look what he says I just can't hardly stand a year I'm sorry a month before he passes away I just can't stand it I want to see God move amongst us now look brother Brandon can't force to move any more than we can force God to move but we should long to see God move and we should hunger to see God move and that hunger can be satisfied right they who hunger and thirst for righteous shall be what fil some experiences I just had up in the mountain just to feel that once again that something that when I was first Saved our children have listened to and read the Supernatural series brother BR said when he first got save he was so excited got off his knees he said he got up and he jumped on the railroad track and he started punching like a boxer he's like I just got all this I just got all this energy he just and he starts running down the track and he's running all around because he's he's got so much joy in his heart he don't know what to do with it so he channels it through boxing he's boxing he's fighting all these things that's the only way he knew how to let it bent out and he said just to feel like that again where you feel the freshness and it's a reality and you're so sincere and you know there's nothing between the Lord and I I feel forgiven there's nothing wrong with hungering for that nothing wrong at all Jesus says you're blessed blessed are they who hunger and thirst that's why when we come to church I hunger to see that I've got to make sure I don't get upset with anybody or myself I got to just make sure I just try to love God with all my heart amen I got to be able to channel that hunger and that desire can't force it upon people you can't force God to move all you can do is worship and love God praise him and when God's timing he's going to sweep in here like a Russian Mighty Wind amen hallelujah glory and we can come into a place we can sit and seat Among Us that we are drying look at this a prophet of God saying we're drying out here it was at brother man said Arizona he said at one time right before he died he said was a spiritual desert as well you know he said that of course it didn't stay that way right because there was real good message churches out there like Loris and Karen things like that saints of God that love God was Supernatural with holy lives and all kinds of things like that but when brother BR was out there he said it was a spiritual dry place as well he said all the preachers are fighting against each other and every there's all kinds of division it's one of the most spiritual dry places you could go and this is one month before the Lord took him home he goes on to say as we sit here in the desert I get among my brethren they talk with me and I talk with them always in a little way of watching dealing out there with the spirit as it was to see just the condition of that brother to see what's wrong so brother would talk to people and listen to what they're what they're saying and he would judge huh what's wrong with their spiritual walk with God you ever try to do that you he had a gift of what discernment so he would do that as a as a Shepherd as a prophet he was called to lead you know lead God's people yet there's a c says he said by the grace of God I'm leading I'm spearheading the lead of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen I leading the Bride of Jesus Christ he said so he would talk with brothers and he would try to listen because your words will tell what's in your heart how many know that there's either life or death in the power of your tongue and your words will tell exactly what your heart condition is and if people lie and you know say things with their mouth and say say the right thing but then live the wrong thing that's called corrupt fruit that's fruit but that's corrupt fruit right and that's called hypocrisy right saying something different Jesus said how can bitter water and sweet water come out of the same power it can't so it shows hypocrisy has entered the person's life they're saying all the right thing but their life is totally different than what they're talking about oh my goodness brother Brandon said I began to feel us all what's that word reclining you ever getting your recliner I just bought my first two re I bought them off my ant I haven't had much time to recline in them lately though but he said they're getting away from the spirit so spiritually they got the recliner and they pulled back on God said hold up God I've given you enough I'm just gonna recline I give I've given you so much now I'm just gonna recline back and dry off a little bit brother Brandon saw this in 1965 a month before he passed brother BR said it in 1961 he said be encouraged he said because when the prophet left Gideon God came on the scene who was it that visited Tucson Tabernacle with Caren L God visited Tucson Tabernacle are you with me church amen so it it's a spiritual desert but once the prophet leaves then God can come on the scene amen I hope you understand what I'm saying that we would all look to God instead of a man and follow a man around and drive around the country which is fine all he's here that's fine but once he leaves who we gonna follow we gotta follow Christ amen he said it's expedient it's necessary that I go away amen because if I don't go away the Holy Ghost won't come you have to just follow a man and follow one man but if the Holy Ghost comes then you'll follow God wherever you are in aan whether you're in Pennsylvania wherever you are you'll follow God wherever you are because you're following the Holy Ghost and not a man amen it's become a too natural thing to us so the Holy Ghost has become too just becoming common to us uh Church uh prayer witnessing it's just become too natural we must Worship in the spirit where the spirit of God not only our message should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame in our hearts see it shows the message has to be in your heart or else you won't be burning bright for the lord it's got to be in your heart if not you recline away if you're not constantly thinking about oh this message is wonderful you need to find something that will stir up your heart find a sermon that will stir up your heart how you can say Amen to that this message the message the revelations God gave us has to be the fire in our heart so sometimes it's like this for my life it kind of it's just like a cycle sometimes Brother Andy I got to turn on a preacher like brother Donnie Reagan or or Tim puit and that will really give me some fire I'm like yes or brother Dwayne Lawson that really stir me up other times I gotta go back to brother brand I constantly listen to brother brand understand what I'm saying but sometimes you got to go back and listen to marriage and divorce and just stir me up again right or some of my favorite messages you know sometimes you got to go back and you gotta keep you gotta keep at the flame of your heart this message is different than all other churches you can attend this morning amen as good as Jewish churches might be at least they're trying to live holy right as good as some of these churches may be this message is God's will for the bride the true Christian in this hour it's a message that's higher than all other messages amen it takes more than human effort to live this message it takes the Holy Ghost amen glory it will take more than just a regular church membership it will take full surrender Hallelujah and so the message isn't burning in your heart then it's time to get revived because you've actually gotten the recliner spiritually and youve reclined way back I only used recliner twice and so Victoria was falling asleep on me this summer you I didn't have work so I just take her down for a nap I set her on my chest I recline back she fall asleep and I could work on my iPad and study I like that reclining that was pretty good I never fell asleep either time that's the kind of reclining I like and then Mom has a break you know the kids have a break I can just have some cuddle time you know and so for that's the kind of reclining I want to do not going away from the Holy Ghost I want to move into the Holy Ghost brother said Believers long for heaven to come down on Earth so the powers of Heaven can come down to earth they can rush in here like A Mighty Wind Jesus said it's like the wind you can't predict it right we all do that we all look at our phones okay weather's gonna be like this but sometimes it ain't how many times you looked out and it said it's supposed to be storming and it's not storming out there they're just kind of guessing right G geographically guessing right or sometimes it say the the rain might last was 90% chance till 8 o' but it's already done by 6 PM nobody can really predict it it's spontaneous and that's how God's spirit is amen we're sitting there with our human Minds is we pray we forget about our prayers years later but then the wind might rush in amen and answer some prayers hallelujah amen that's the wind of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah it comes when sometimes you're not look for it that's how atin and Benjamin came I remember I was I was I was a little bit discouraged this summer I joined hands with my children I said Lord do something Supernatural I don't care whether you save souls or whether you speak in tongues at church or something like that and then the very next day Gabe came and the rest is history by God's grace and what is there what greater what greater uh is what greater Miracle is there than salvation is there any greater Miracle does anybody know of anyone greater I don't and I just ask God said God do something stir us stir our hearts up and God did so I want to thank the Lord for that Mary's belief we got churches all over the city around the world that's preaching the unsearchable riches of Christ because we have Fellowship together we set in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the holy ghost coming upon us and overshadowing US empowering us with gifts and signs and wonders and miracles why is the closest thing to Heaven There is on Earth and this is why we should Hunger for More of the spirit of God it is it is as if Heaven comes down to earth there's a song that we like at our house it's called Uh Heaven Fall Down it's a just beautiful song about talks about heaven heaven fall down spirit Spirit pour out on us all now it's just a beautiful song it's a it's just a beautiful song Heaven comes down to earth sometimes amen the Holy Spirit comes down and when we have those experiences it's the closest we'll ever get to that Dimension while we're here in this Dimension amen and that's my future home so I like that I like to feel like I'm at home right I like to be like I'm getting close to home amen that but just the spirit of God the Purity the power of the Holy Ghost come down amongst us amen adoption series again but a real Spirit-filled church full of the power of God setting together in Heavenly places offering spiritual sacrifices what are those anybody know they're thanksgivings Hebrews 13 says spiritual sacrifices are giving thanks and if you're really thankful it's got come from where it's got to come from your lips we shouldn't make the song leader or the preacher we shouldn't have to have them ask us to give God thanks it should just flow out of our heart we shouldn't have to ask the river river can you flow out now can you come the river it just automatically flows out church are you with me I talk about the baptism of the Holy Ghost here when someone gets filled with the Holy Ghost we'll talk about that's kind of what it is the spirit it just has to come out but here's what brother man says Praises come out the Holy Spirit moving among them I like this Discerning sin and calling out the things that's among them that's wrong straightened out and making it a flattened level like John the Baptist brought the mountains down low brought up the valleys right that's what preaching does preaching against sin just brings it all level let's start all over amen I've got mountains in my way if I got valleys I'm stuck in let's level it out amen let's get so I can walk again amen walk straight in there are you with me Church sin often causes what remember sin is like a mountain right you got to speak to the mountain and move it amen that's what the preaching of the word does when it calls out sin or reclining or getting cold on God it's so we can we can confess that and make the make make the ground level for all Christians we can make the road a lot a lot easier to walk praise God I love that about John the Baptist he never did one Miracle the Bible said he wasn't Miracle working God as far as outward Miracles but he sure did spiritual powerful preaching he went up to Herod and said it's not lawful for you to be married to this woman and what was he doing he was raising up those valleys he was casting down those mountains of sin and leveling it out here Herod you can walk the the clear path if you just repent and put that wife away from you but he denied it but still John was doing great work he was doing good Landscaping work amen he was leveling out the land so that people could walk those who want to walk with God will walk with God amen glory so now I want to get to the day of Pentecost I really want to try to be mindful of the time here I'm about at 50 minutes okay I've been always I've been constantly preaching an hour and a half I try I want to stop that a little bit try want to maybe hour 15 here by God's grace if we can do that I just I get I get nervous like I can't finish the topic okay tearing let's look at this and behold I send the promise Pro of my father upon you but T you in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high so t means to wait they're to wait in Jerusalem until they're endued endued means clothed so see when the Holy Ghost falls on you it's like your soul is clothed with God's power now it's clothed with God's spirit praise God it's a spiritual garment the Bible calls it in Revelation 19 fine linen which is the what righteousness of saints you're right your Soul's righteous your soul is just because God's spirit has come upon that soul and God the Bible said once the seed of God's in you and anointed you cannot sin anymore how many know that this is what God's talking about you get endued you get clothed with power that's the Holy Ghost clothing anointing your soul praise God power from on high let's go to that let's let's go to First John if we can I believe it's chapter 3 let me turn there real quick he that's born of God cannot s and I know I'm building I'm building because I want the Holy Ghost to fall I want people to be filled with the Holy Ghost in our church that is the whole purpose of my life to preach God's word and try to get people filled with the Holy Ghost and get them saved that's why I was born on this Earth that's what God's revealed to me amen so first John I don't let anything else by God's grace get my way of that that's one thing I was called to do in my life and I'm going to do it by by his help and by his grace okay now looking for it if anybody finds it you can just speak it out I'll find it just a second yeah 1 John 39 yeah sorry it's right there in front of me verse 7 let's go to 1 John 3:7 if we can by God's grace little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committed sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil so why did christ come to destroy the works of Satan in your life think about when you were a sinner you used to do many works for Satan well Christ should have destroy those praise God like I was telling the brother yesterday or Austin's mom God destroyed uh my addiction to video games God destroyed my all my addiction to chewing tobacco and smoking and drinking right he destroyed that that's destroyed and I'm not gonna let it be build up again right my desire to cuss uh look at evil pictures Evil movies and things like that he took all that away he destroyed that praise God it's just like in the Old Testament where they would take out the idols they had to physically grab an idol and throw it down and smash it brother amen until it came to dust amen Glory that's what God did in my life spiritually the idol of sports the idol of Pride the idol of whatever attractiveness the idol whatever handsomeness or you know worldliness Hollywood they got to be crushed and they got to be stomped down they got to be cast down in Jesus name amen said we could use a holy ghost dust storm I think you said if I'm not mistaken a dust storm where where Idols are cast down and you stomp them out and you stomp them out of your life I can't some people ask me well cast this demon out of my life you're the one that's got to cast it out many times it's you're the one that's got to surrender you're the one that's got to get rid of it the presence of God removes uh the presence of God removes sicknesses for a while but if the person's not right with God it'll come right back praise God I've seen that I've seen God heal people one time we had services in app Point God healed a woman of nerve trouble she said she had all these and I remember it really well cuz my grandpa got healed that same day when we prayed for him he had a he had a numb he had a numb leg all the way down from his diabetes he never got rid of his diabetes but he couldn't feel his leg I prayed for him and he said he started saying Glory Glory Spanish Hallelujah glory glory alos and he come up and testified the next night that God brought all the feeling back in his leg as we prayed for him amen but the same night a woman I don't even remember her name I'm not going to share but she left the message now and I think that's why it might have come back on but she testified I remember her in tears said I all this nerve trouble in my back and my neck I can't even move and you know all kind like this you know and we were just praying there praying with brother steveen crestle brother Cam and uh different Brothers there praying brother Brooks I think was there and she testified the next night that God had completely taken out of the way but then it may come back oh my see the spirit of God does remove these things but it'll come back if you don't fill that with the Holy Ghost praise God but many times brother said uh there's a quote where brother talking about cigarettes and one time he tells a man let God take it away another time he said you got to take it away so depending on the person's makeup if they have if if they're just enjoying the sin he would be able to discern that and say you got to get rid of your sin problem and you got to cast it down another guy couldn't had no ability and he said just wait on God he believed God would do it and God did it amen Hallelujah because the quote with the one where the brother got delivered was the one where brother said do you want me to take a a carton of cigarettes up to your hospital bed and he said he didn't have to do that because he prayed for God he committed unto God he would go to Bam sermons and go out and smoke afterwards it's in the quotes you can hear it if you want he said don't worry about that he said get your eyes off your cigarettes and get them on Christ here's a man who couldn't do it on his own yet he believed God could do it and here's another man who could do it and wouldn't surrender and so brother R challenges him a different way don't you love the Lord so not every not every uh direction is the same for everybody it takes the Holy Spirit to discern our hearts where are we at with God what can we do well that was quite a thing okay so listen the disciples Carri I got 15 more minutes I'll go hour 15 by God's grace help me Jesus 10 days to fulfill the Feast of Weeks which was a type of the 50th day how many you know that I'm sorry pardon me can we go back to our Bibles first John 39 I didn't even get to the scripture oh help me Jesus Lord you know I love you Lord Jesus first joh 39 whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he's born of God I'm how many how many love that by God's grace you have to be able to separate your three parts and say the seed of God doesn't sin I hate to sin I I hate sin but then you have to go to chapter one let's go to chapter one verse eight if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in US amen so what is it my flesh has sins my mind has sins but I the seed of God have no sin amen hallelujah that's the mystery of it that's the revelation of it I don't sin the seed inside of me does not sin because it's born of God and unbelief has passed away and faith and life has entered the house amen but my flesh and my mind does have sin because Paul said my sin that dwelleth in my members don't let it stumble you other one place will say God forgive me I'm a sinner saved by grace and another place he said a Christian can't even sin he says well how do you de with those quotes well you gotta look at the three parts of man and then you'll understand by God's grace Hallelujah that se inside of you cannot if you have the Holy Ghost seat inside of you that can't produce Thorns it will produce wheat praise God there's nothing in it to produce Thorns Oh Glory there's nothing in our souls that wants to sin against God how many you feel that way amen nothing in your soul the very nature Soul means nature the very being the very nature of your being doesn't want to sin against God all right now now back to this so disciples had to wait 10 days but the requirement today is not 10 days of waiting it is meeting God's requirement of being fully Sanctified so it's not a number anymore it was a number in those days because they had to wait till the Feast of Weeks the day of Pentecost 50 because that was the day where they took out the two loaves and now you have the Jewish church and the Gentile church that were two loaves of bread remember Gideon Gideon's Army was a loaf of bread the Bible said stumbled barley bread stumbled down the hill and knocked out the the T of the moabites I think it was I amorites so but the requirement of our full obedience before our birth this is why people can't get born again they don't fully obey the word of God they don't fully obey the word of God this is probably where I end up closing a little bit and we Are Witnesses of these things and so also is the Holy Ghost whom God have given to them that obey him when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them who does God give the Holy Ghost to church those who obey him if you can't obey the word you can't expect to feel the Holy Ghost come upon you feel your soul you have to obey what the word says in [Music] everything said when you surrender fully you'll come in fully that's why some people have a partial experience with God sometimes they're partially feeling good with God other times they don't feel good with God they're not filled with God I don't want a half I don't want a half full cup I want a full cup praise God I'm an optimist but my a half cup is not a full cup I'll say it like that a full cup is a full cup a few a full Holy Ghost filled Christian is a full Holy Ghost filled Christian he or she is in the word all the away and they're interested in all the things of God but until you surrender he can't come in fully surrender surrender your thoughts surrender your thinking Surrender Your Life surrender all surrender your prestige so what people think about you I don't care what anybody thinks of me praise God Amen all I care is what God thinks about me and if I care about what God thinks me then like brother said then I have fear for my wife in other words I I I have a I want to live the right kind of life in front of my wife he said I I fear the kind conation I fear brother Neville then I want to serve other people if I love God so much then I want to love his people that's the only way you can know that you love God as if you love other people so we should be interested in the body of Christ right here if we see brother I to say like this I us don't do this but from the ppit but amen might have a car need you pray about it maybe God would use you to help him out amen isn't that what the body's for if my leg scratches what what do I need I need to send a message up to the hand come on hand go scratch my knee come on oh yeah thank you one part of the body helping another part of the body or just put an unspoken need in here if you don't like people to know but that's what a body's supposed to do a body's supposed to help out the rest of the body what better body to help out than Jesus is amen hallelujah the body of the Bride surrender everything to him now and he'll come in and fill you with the Holy Ghost like I said earlier until every door of every area of life is open to Jesus Christ a person won't be born again yet they still have more sanctification to go that's why I said every area of my life it was my words it was my relationship with my wife and we both said when the message came we're willing to leave each other if God wants to married or have mared different people but God kept us together I'm very happy happy for that by God's grace but we got to be willing to separate from anything anything that any appearance of evil the Bible said avoid all appearance let's read it first Thessalonians 5 because I know we got Austin and Benjamin here they need to see these things by God's grace I tell you it was great yesterday I had a chance to sit down with Austin his mom here Austin starts kind of like just ring off the word and all these things he's learned at church is sharing with his Bible like proud of that guy glory amen I see Benjamin you know correcting his son talking about the word oh no we need to go to church I said proud of him amen GL what we hear we should put it into action don't be a forgetful here come to church I don't even know what was said I don't even know if my life's ever going to change that's a that's foolish yes if the word says I'm something if I see my reflection here then I'm going to remember what I look like I'm going remember what I'm supposed to look like by God's grace 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 21 look at this well let's go to verse 18 and everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you even in hard times church can we give thanks yes yeah I think I need help with that I think we all need help with that quench not the spirit so don't do something where it would put out the Holy Spirit keep your heart and mind on God don't think about other things have one heart and one Accord by God's grace despise not prophesyings we love prophecy amen we don't actually have it operating in here too often but prophecy can work without a thus say the Lord Jesus never had to say thus sayi the Lord un prophesying he just told it would happen same thing can happen in our lives uh verse 21 prove all things hold fast to that which is good prove that it's the will like we said prove it's the will of God for your life prove to me that it's God's will for you not to do this or for you to do this you should be able to prove it's God's will for your life I don't know if I'm like sun night we're talking about tonight we don't know what maybe you don't know the next Direction next thing to do you know we're talking about work and things like that church if we don't know what do we need to do we need to ask God and we need to be able to prove this is God's will for my life because he and I we none of us none of us want to make a mistake while we're walking this Pilgrim Way do we does anybody want to walk off the path that God gave for us no sir I to follow those bloody Footprints all the way to heaven amen so prove it I know this is the right decision because this this this he gives two three Witnesses or maybe it's just God put such a burden in my heart I know this is the will of God it's the right thing for me to do now here where I go verse 22 brother Austin and V abstain from all appearance of evil something looks evil get get rid of it praise God it even looks this is the surrender you must have if you want the Holy Ghost if it looks evil get rid of it we some of us we've lived in sin so long we just get used to it we never even live without of it just try living without it and see how God will bless your life amen I never knew what a Christian Life I could live until I got rid of the TV bye then brother amen I started Living like I was supposed to live amen I I don't waste a whole Sunday I don't waste a whole Saturday watching football I can do all this for the Lord I can you know help out whatever do what whatever God wants me to do your life will turn upside down if you surrender everything because you'll be finally doing what God told you to do and your choice of what you do in your time shows if you're you're wise or foolish praise God let's go to Ephesians 4 that proves that whatever you choose to do with your time that's why I was preaching so hard on coming to church if you can if someone's not sick every time the doors are open what you do with your time shows if you're wise or foolish and the church said it is absolutely Bible truth what you do with your time isn't it strange how we can you know some of us we can come here and enjoy the word of God all every time the doors are open and those live streaming praise God if you're enjoying it that's wonderful but let's say someone doesn't live stream or someone doesn't attend how can we be loving God praising God receiving His blessings here drawing closer to God and then other people okay that they're not drawing closer to God how can that be possible when we invest our time here and they don't invest their time here it's because they're a different quality of a Christian a wise virgin redeems the time and the church said amen there ain't a choice in it the wise I'm sorry it's Ephesians 5 sorry the wise Christian redeems the time look at verse 15 Ephesians 5:15 see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the days are evil and be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is praise God a holy ghost to a Christian knows the perfect will of God for their life they know where they come from they know where they are and they know where they're going praise God they know what gifts they got in their life they know what God's called them to do they're open to receiving more Hallelujah they met with God they know God's will their mind is transformed because a transformed mind is the way to know the will of God you know hold ghost anointed mind and then you can prove to people this is God's will for my life how do you know because I can do it with God's help I can do it amen hallelujah Glory I got four five minutes bear with me I'm looking at my thing here right here five [Music] minutes I didn't even get to the Staggering part I was going to show you all the quotes of brother BR said they stagger on the day of Pentecost we'll get to that by God's grace if the Lord willing this is what the Holy Ghost produces when someone's born again it produces a type of reaction let's just since we're here let's close this understanding about tearing for the holy ghost look at this brother Ram said God is more anxious to give you the Holy Ghost than you are to receive it I can't wait till brother so and so is ready for me to fill him I can't wait for sister so- and so to finally surrender that I can come and dwell in their heart I can I can live in another Temple another Tabernacle Hallelujah I can fill another Tabernacle oh the Holy Spirit that's the house he desires to dwell in not a house made by hands but a house made by God amen glory you don't have to t t t there's no such thing while Peter yet spake the words the Holy Ghost fell them and heard it the trouble is we don't want it enough and that's the trouble we're not we don't want to Humble oursel so to be born again you have to humble yourself die to every single thing even die to what you want to think you're going to act like die to that I've got to speak in tongues or I've got to cry I've got to shout I've got to scream like a siren I've got to snot and boohoo on the altar until it's wet no just lose all your thoughts and just wait for God humble yourself now brother Brandon mentions is there's no tearing and he goes to acts 10 but get your Bibles ready I'm going to close with this go wor I think this is good while Peter yet spake the words the Holy Ghost fell in them all that which heard to work while he was preaching the Holy Ghost fell in way where he had to stop preaching I've had that happen to me twice on this Earth maybe three times three I preached by the Holy Spirit I know God's dealing with people and all of a sudden they start worshiping so much I got to stop and I just say I'm stopping because God's glory is here oh I love those times I love every time but I like those times too praise God when you can't Minister because there's so much glory of God hallelujah I like to see that come to after by God's grace we've had great times in the spirit you understand what I'm saying um I like to see it come again I'm going say like that like to see it come again like God but actually I don't think it's happened here though I just think it happened so that's what I'm saying maybe it's happened other brothers that preached here but I know for sure like when brother Tim M Kimmy was here I think it's a different times brother's been here where there just such a powerful atmosphere you know God was blessing people answering people's prayers and so forth so Peter's preaching and all of a sudden the Holy Ghost Falls okay I'm done preaching let's Worship the Lord Hallelujah let's close with this now see you don't have to Terry t t cornelius's house was not tearing for the Holy Ghost but they were being Sanctified which made them ready for the holy ghost look at the life of cornelus church just think about this life and honestly look at your heart look at your life right now cornelus and his house believed in Christ and God and God remembered their faithful giving of arms are we giving givings like Jesus said I'm not talking about offerings to the church I'm talking about alms and you can't take your ties and gives alms because ties are God's money I preach on that remember that probably here's a man who's already giving alms in other words brother uh brother Austin he's out there he just sees people that need help and he just helps him out he don't he doesn't he doesn't broadcast and say hey everybody look at me right Ms Ms are secret giving you help out people in secret here's a he's going to get the Holy Ghost any day right any any moment here in the scripture but his life has been given to alms he's been helping out poor people that makes him ready for the Holy Ghost because he's not living for cornelus anymore he's living for Christ praise God and he was fasting and God gave him the vision to go call Peter through his prayer and fasting here's a man he don't even have the Holy Ghost yet he's praying and fasting giving arms now think about your life are you praying fasting giving arms brother Ram said it's got to come exactly the same way the Bible came how they receive the Holy Ghost Falls the same exact way he gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him are you fasting are those that want the Holy Ghost are we fasting and praying God said I remembered your prayers Cornelius Cornus was a just man and feared God he feared God because he was praying to God Amen he feared God because he was helping out the poor this is the kind of a Christian he was he was a Sanctified Christian so when the message of the AR came it was easy for him to receive the Holy Ghost because he's already got a life that's surrendered to Christ amen he's not living for carus anymore he's living for the body of Christ they were a humble Sanctified Gentile group of Believers ready for the baptism Holy Ghost to stand our feet and just an hour 15 exactly on my clock praise God and about an hour now an hour later in brother R same sermon he said you don't have to T there you don't have to t t t look what he says an hour later he's saying stay right with it stay there oh Lord I'm gonna stay right here I don't care if it's in the morning other words he said you might have to T all night so there's a balance in the same sermon he said you don't have to Terry Terry T he says you might you said you should be willing to stay here all night till you get the Holy Ghost he said I don't care if it's in the morning I'll be standing here God praising you I know you're going to send it this convention is ending tonight and I'm here without the Holy Ghost I'm going away from here filled with the Holy Ghost so help me you promised it where did he promise it in Acts 238 and 239 Glory he who repents and is baptized in the name of Jesus Christ shall let's say shall ready shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost this promis is unto you and your children you promis it Lord and if people have to wait all night what does it mean they have to die out more they have to die out more you promise it I'll stand here like a Weather Vein I'll do anything you want me to do only I want the Holy Ghost I'm determined to get it so God is actually the one waiting until you're fully surrendered God's actually the one tearing Church can I say like that he's the one tearing well is brother so and so going to get ready is he going to surrender this or not I surely like to fill him oh I sure like to fill sister son so I'm just tearing I'm just waiting to fill them whenever they when they when they fully surrender to me and obey me I just want to fill them so much let me end with these quotes please thank you Lord I want to get to the tongues and help you to see what kind of tongues it ain't unknown tongues or I'm sorry it isn't unknown tongues let's close to this you must die to have a birth this is what I was saying earlier I was going to reference the reason people blabber Hallelujah the reason people shout praise snot whatever jibber jabber whatever stammer I said with stammering lips in another tongue the reason they do that is because they're dying amen that's why they cry that's why they scream that's why they shout someone just died and it was them hallelujah amen Jesus said except the corn of wheat fall on the ground and die it abides alone but if it die it bringeth forth fruits of the spirit amen is that right that's the reason they cried that's the reason they snot it out brother R said is because they're dying to myself somebody's died Hallelujah but until they die he can't come in because they still have they still they're keeping they're pushing God out they want even if it's just once sin they're pushing God out no I don't want to and God's like I'm waiting I'm tearing I'm tearing brother said he's hunting people to fill hallelujah look what he says brother says these exact words and I see you're afraid to turn yourself loose you're scared of something there's something wrong God don't make a promise and go back on it it's the truth it's up to you it's your what death that's why people cry go Hallelujah that's why I cried and I saw visions of Christ when I got born again amen because I was dying I recognized when he died and recognize that he died instead of me Hallelujah he died in my place he died for me he died in my stad yes he did but I died to wanting to do what Jesse Smith wanted to do and I lived to the will of God they're scared to die they're scared to fully surrender and and let go of all their sinful Pleasures it's your death it's your what burial it's your exception there's the word a few moments later friends you got to get away from that starchy Pentecostal way I'll just you know I'll just shout a little bit and jump around a little bit that's not dying anybody can do that anybody can feel good at anointed all the time people work I'll share testimonies oh I feel shivers down my back that's fine I'm not making fun of that but that's as far as they they think that's as far as you can go with God there's something beyond that it's called Death to self amen it's a Death to Your will it's a burial of your will and now the will of Christ can come into your soul Hallelujah as far as I go I feel Shiver I that's good I'm glad the testimony brings the Holy Spirit but who's ready to die who's ready to have their their will buried so that fruit of the Holy Spirit can come out of their life we're talking about a whole different experience this isn't just jumping and Shou and bubble dancing this is death and life you really got to mean it like we were talking recently you really got to mean I want God In My Soul you really gotta mean I'm done with this I'm done with that I'm done you really gotta mean it and until you mean it he can't come because you're still holding Idols in your heart and he can't take the place as number one in your heart you're keeping them out of doors in your life doors in your heart you got a partial hunger he said but not a real hunger no wonder there's noise of Believers dying they show all these videos recently of people being you know shot and different things and dying what are the girls do they're screaming all these things like that what is that showing us when death is happening it brings a reaction does it not amen life is leaving here and when a Christian dies and really dies out their Will dies out it dies and now Christ can finally have preeminence in their life that's about our heads here but L if you'll come here you can switch over thank you sir just play that I surrender all I want to make this a series I hope you understand by God's grace if you want prayer this morning I'm happy to pray with you but I found when brother Bron prayed for the Holy Ghost he often didn't lay hands on people he let them die out to themselves until God came at church the reason i' I've always laid hands on is because in Trinidad and Al being in different place where I preach and the Holy Ghost fell people wanted me to lay hands on them and they seem to get good results but here at the home church I don't know if it really has or not I'm not quite sure I'm not quite sure I see brother brandom letting people wrestled out this is the most important time of the service if anytime there's an important time it's right now but said the end of the preaching is the climax of the service how many believe that you believe it was a prophet because now it's on you the word has gone forth it's on me what are we do what are we going to do with the word are we going to mix that word with faith or not [Music] what I'm hoping is this as this series goes on this will Cate such a hunger in people's lives to die to S and really see am I really born again am I really interested in all the things of God am I re what am I doing with my time is my time Redeemed by God have I let God redeem all my time am I acting like it's the evening time and uh we only have a few more hours to labor and find a Ministry and do something for Jesus what is our attitude towards our free time or church time I want people to be able to say brother Jesse the word has show me I really am born again or the word has showed me I'm not and I want to die out that's what I want this to produce because at least if you know you're not you God can take you further but I don't want people leaving here thinking well I'm I guess I'll just always think I got it I don't care really what the preaching says shame on you if you act like that I don't care I'm not even listening to the sermon it don't mean nothing to me this is the most sacred thing we can do is examine our souls a Souls worth 10,000 worlds is it not 52 million people die every day how do you know this ain't your day how do you know tomorrow this week won't be your week to die 52 million people die every every single day no man knows the day or hour of Christ coming no man knows the day or the hour of their death God reveals it to them dying that's why people blabber brother sister that's why people cry that's why preachers persuade and beg people to get right with God that's why we pray and fast so someone will die to their selfishness die to a path that's lust that's ultimately going to lead them to death and Hell or maybe the tribulation for foolish virgin brother said the real Holy Ghost Church calls out sin discerns it that's the real Holy Ghost Church with your heads bowed let's go back to Kos let's close with that he was a just man that feared God how many would raise your hand and say brother Jesse I need to be more like Kos I need to fast pray give arms God bless those [Music] hands can put them down there I'm going to pray that your heart and my heart would be so focused on the baptism of Holy Ghost for the next few weeks Lord willing I have a guest preacher till the middle of October by God's help I want to keep on these thoughts unless God would take me out something else that would help the church we all know there's going to come a rapture we all know we've all heard it for years but now we know how we need to act when it comes we need to be fully surrendered totally died out all every part of our life has to be surrendered to Christ so old person middle-aged person young person in your heart right now listen as I pray Heavenly Father am I dead to self have I really died out Lord I've seen so many people say they're ready to be baptized and get baptized and you never we don't see fruit come from that it means Lord there's more death that needs to happen in people's lives and this is the time where it could happen Lord after the word has been preached Lord I just pray let there be a holy atmosphere in this church the next few weeks if it be your will let there be those like Cornus that fear God and they use their time to redeem it for the kingdom of God as you told Mary and Martha you said Mary has chosen the more needful thing to sit at the feet of Jesus Jesus and hear the word of God Mary chose to use her time work work work work work I'm sorry Martha did but Mary said I'm gonna take a break and I'm going to sit at Jesus feet and he said that'll never be taken from me Hallelujah Lord there's things in our lives when the word is preached that Satan cannot touch thank you that's called a revelation amen Lord let there be Revelation in our hearts that we must die out that's why people blabber that's why people scream that's why people don't scream and don't worship because they don't die out and I'm not talking every service I'm talking about being filled with the Holy Ghost and they wander from this to that without any pure Direction any perfect will of God lord Jesus I pray Lord God let people die out in this church I was crying yesterday praying for the same thing Lord send the Holy Ghost amongst us Lord I don't care when I just pray let that Holy wind that righteous wind of God May the Russian Mighty Wind come to us Lord God I don't care when it comes I just want it to come I want to see it in my lifetime should you T I've seen it visit other churches and things Lord here I Minister we've had wonderful times but Lord I would like to see it where people can leave the service say brother Jesse I know I was born again in that service that's what I want to see Lord I'm a Shepherd I want to guide the Sheep to Living Waters that's all I ask give me the inspiration Lord to guide the people to hunger and thirst for righteousness that they'll be filled with the Holy Ghost for those who need it Lord for those of us who have it we're so full of joy thank you Lord thank you Jesus we're so full of gratitude and Thanksgiving Lord we see Christ in our lives our life is sacrificed for the will of God we're walking day by day thankful for your grace yeah we struggle but we have a wise life Lord and I thank you for that Jesus I'm not interested in a lukewarm church I'm not interested in myself being a lukewarm Pastor that's the last thing I want Lord you said we should be hot or cold Lord here we are heat us up by God's grace turn up the heat Lord God I'm not maybe asking for persecution but I don't know what you'll use to turn up the heat but Lord bring us Lord a full surrender Lord God that the wind of the Holy Ghost can come in this place and people will know know that they know that they know I born again I've surrendered all my life to Jesus Christ I love him with all my heart and anything that's attached to Jesus Christ in the message I'm a part of it I'll give Ms I'll pray I'll fast I'll travel to help other people I'll do whatever I have to do whatever Christ asked me to do I'll do it because I'm a true child of God hallelujah if you pray that in your heart I trust God will give you the desires of your heart [Music] Church any desires prayer you're more than welcome to come other you just sing that for us that song right there longing for Jesus for Jes Lord we're longing for you this [Music] morning [Music] to feel his [Music] [Music] presence praise God let's s that again just pray in your heart whatever you're God's dealing with you Lord seek truth in our heart show us the reality of our life is it a Cornelius life is it a Peter life if it's not help us to long for that here I feel like brother brand I long to see the spirit of God moving together Lord thank you for saving these Souls Lord father we want them filled too those of us who don't know we're filled may you f them dear [Music] God the spirit of the Living God fall fresh on me and let's sing it with the thought of the Soul because it can all fall in our flesh and I might cry but if my desire doesn't change when I go out the door that's just what it was it was just on the flesh so as we sing this think about falling on my soul if it hasn't fallen there yet that seed hasn't been quickened you feel still feel like unbelief is at the very depth of your being you're not fully surrendered and let's sing it like that Lord soon fall upon my soul of the Living [Music] God Jesus us for ERS [Music] Jesus one more [Music] time [Music] Jesus [Music] in your own way just thank him for the message this today in the worship can you just thank him thank you Jesus the most critical time of the service Lord let our faith mix with this word of you let it become quite a compound Lord let it fully combine that your Prophet said this is the same experience as the book of Acts and we'll get it if we just do the same thing which is die [Music] out thank you [Music] Lord May everyone in the church die out to our Wills our own will Lord God even me every one of us looking for you to move Lord here I'll keep waiting in with patience love I know your word canot return void I felt this brother come preached it even brother Dale preached on the line and the oil the very next service I truly feel this is where you have us to come [Music] [Music] Jus Lord Jesus as we close in prayer draw near Lord God some of us may have pushed the spiritual P the spiritual recliner lever in our lives and we're just cooling off on God we're just relaxing on God we've lost our Zeal we've lost our desire lost our focus in life father may we undo the repining Lord realize how precious time is Lord as I had this thought what are the young people and children and all the children of the church what are they going to remember us adults as when they grow up what kind of a church are they going to say we have a church of cold starchy arrogant know it alls for a church that's filled with love for Christ parents and friends that they gave their whole life to Christ everything was secondary to Jesus Christ everything oh my when I grew up my daddy my mommy they were so in love with God they so L Jesus they died out to everything God the Next Generation soon to come help us to live the life in front of them dear God help us not be just satisfied in our walk and just recline and not really be on fire like we ought to be we've seen it in so many churches may we lord move towards you we pray God bless your people Lord God may you be with them whatever they decide to do whether they decide to come back or if they've got certain things or or be with every heart and I pray you just help us to die out to ourselves to hunger and thirst for [Music] righteousness and we'll pray for everyone Ines Jesus Christ Name Church set God bless you Church you're dismissed in the name of the Lord you're welcome more than welcome to stay here and pray if you do let's not talk in here let's just get out there so we can have a nice [Music] atmosphere cross in a
