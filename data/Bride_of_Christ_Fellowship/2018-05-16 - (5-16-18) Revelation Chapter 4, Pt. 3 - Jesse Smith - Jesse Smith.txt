verse four around about the throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold that's all read verse five one two three and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God amen let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer if you mean on your hearts making order to God Heavenly Father Lord God we just come back again Lord to hear your word it's our bread Lord God this word that we hear is our bread it's our life it sustains us who strengthens us and lore we love singing about how your love defends us Lord God we're so grateful for your love and your compassion Lord we're just trusting you to provide another healthy meal for us tonight Lord a full-course meal Lord Jesus we ask that you'd speak to us by your word Lord God through these thoughts that you've laid upon my heart and Lord we know you're able Lord God to give us more as the saints pull upon your word and father were just grateful to be here tonight in thy divine service Lord the world could that could be tempting us to do anything else Lord work on our yard or do other things Lord God or try to make more money but father our heart's desire is to be in your house Oh God it is better to be in your house tonight than a thousand other days anywhere else Lord God we know Holy Writ teaches that so father bless us in that presence we love you all of our trust is in you our faith is in you Lord and we ask that you be with us here tonight in a special way to meet every need in Jesus Christ's name the Saint said Amen god bless yours being seated the Lord so we like to look at revelation 4 again here by God's grace I do want to have a few slides here tonight well I got the next proof back from the publisher of our post card and they I must have not stated it right I wanted the pillar fire over here to be outlined but they outline the name so I have to go back and fix that so I must have worded it wrong or something in my haste I must have made a little mistake there so I got that back and we have two quotes there one from Naomi and Adam that gave us 5 stars at the church so we're grateful we know there's a lot more stars here than that because stars are the seed of Abraham praise the Lord so thank you for those quotations and we really appreciate that like I said I got one more I just wanted that pillar fire over here to stand out I thought I wrote it right but I must have made a mistake so forgive me on that well let's look right here to the Word of God here tonight and we're gonna get to that the Prophet teaches this here so let's look at this thought here we'll try to get as far as we can by the grace of the Lord hope you're enjoying the revelation series I know I am this is part 73 of the series so we're grateful for God's grace and patience with us and I'll just listen today again to part three and brother Branham says oh how I just wish I had time to go through this slowly so I guess I get to fulfill his desire to go through these things nice and slow don't have to be in a rush we can just enjoy the word of the Lord amen so we're looking at this is part 3 of Revelation chapter 4 series from 1961 and our text was verse 4 and 5 now the first thought brother Ram brings out is this out of the throne proceeded lightnings and this is kind of building on where we looked at last week by the grace of the Lord the prophet said that John saw a throne of judgment not have thrown a mercy because he been caught up at the end of chapter 3 actually beginning of chapter 4 and caught up out of the church ages so if you got your Bibles let's go to Exodus 19 maybe we can have our youngsters read that for us tonight our teens or preteens maybe tonight by God's grace but program compares that and he notes a striking similarity to the Mount Sinai when God gave the law to Israel so Moses on Mount Sinai saw thunder lightning which was the same thing John saw here in Revelation chapter 4 the Prophet said it was a judgment seat because anything that touched the mountain died so let's read Exodus 19 16 through 25 just so we got a good understanding of that like I said the Prophet said he wished he had more time to go through it slower so we're gonna do that by His grace revelation 19 of course is right before the Ten Commandments in chapter 20 so verse 16 why don't we have a Lydia you're the oldest for the teens here can you read 16 17 18 and 19 alright give you sick 17 18 19 amen now we look at the scripture here and God has come down God comes down his fire and that spiritual fire actually produces spiritual smoke the Bible said and it fills and covers with a mountain we'd say now one interesting note here is that this is God gonna bring forth the law correct he's gonna bring law in the next chapter and interesting to know here along with that comes a trumpet right the Bible said twice in our scripture that the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud so here the trumpet is calling them together and we also know the trumpets it relator in revelation I believe is chapter 11 if I'm not mistaken 9 I'm sorry 8 9 10 and 11 I'm sorry 8 9 and 11 the seven trumpets we know our God getting ready to sound for judgments to issue judgments upon the earth so here God is issue getting ready to issue the judgments of the 10 commandments but in Revelation when those seven angels sound the seven trumpets that will be destruction that will be during the tribulation so we see that Elijah can you read sir could you read 20 21 22 a men now as a striking God has a lot for his prophet to do he's got a run-up and then God said now go run back down he could have just spoke it from other places but see God's got a special meeting place with his servants praise God he calls them up says go back down tell him not to touch the mountain tell the priests to keep their their distance and if not if they don't respect God's presence God will break forth upon them so God is of course getting ready to show his judgments here and his power and it's interesting here that God speaks by voice back I've never actually heard the voice of God myself but how many have felt the burden of God's word upon your heart that's how I often feel it I church I don't honestly don't even need to hear a voice as long as I can read the Word of God amen as long as I can hear the word cuz blessed is he that heareth the words of this prophecy and keepeth it amen brother man make sure you emphasize is that when he preaches this series it doesn't matter if you're educated or illiterate you just have to be able to hear the voice of God amen hear the word of God so for some people like Moses and prophets they hear the literal voice for others they hear the preaching of God's voice the word of the Lord Amen verse 23 and Moses said to the Lord the people cannot come up to Mount Sinai for thou are just us saying set bounds about the Mount and sanctify it and the Lord said unto Him away get thee down and thou shalt come up now and Aaron with thee let not the priests and people break through to come up unto the Lord lest he break forth upon them so Moses went down to the people and spake unto them now remember what the Bible say the Bible said in Hebrews that the law was a shadow of good things to come so God was foreshadowing here Hermey he was showing the approach unto himself and that's what brother Ram that's brother hams main theme as we go through this sermon as I was listening to it over the last few weeks is the approach unto God God was showing that there was a special kind of approach you had to go through in order to contact God and the Old Testament it was very a very detailed process to go through Hermey and so God had to call Moses up for a special trip speak to his prophet and send him back down amen now program said Moses made things on earth and made the tabernacle like the things that he saw in heaven we know that don't we he said Paul did the same thing he said that Moses made things just like he did and Paul in his vision when he went up into heaven when he taught the great book of Hebrews he must have saw in his vision the same thing that Moses saw because he said that he taught that wonderful book of Hebrews how that Christianity was the anti-type of the Old Testament he was a great teacher Paul was now remember what's he talking about brother branham's talking about this scripture where Paul sang and said Gridley is 12 I came to visions and he said I went up into the third heaven so Paul was caught up in the third heaven but he couldn't talk about it he couldn't write about it but when he wrote the book of Hebrews he could say Moses saw the same things in heaven that he made on earth he caught the vision of heaven and he made that vision a reality on earth amen so brother man picks that up and he says that's exactly what happened here because the Bible said uncoordinated a pattern which the Lord showed Moses so he made the candlestick amen what a great example of Jesus's prayer let it be done on earth as it is in heaven praise God and Moses was faithful like that Moses was a real the Bible said no one was faithful in all God's house like unto Moses Amen if the word said it he was going to do it that ought to be our desire if the word says it church let's do it Amen let's do it let's not talk about it nine things we said some things we can't just bring the past the next day and brother Ram even says there's certain complexes you get he says he says the people say just shake yourself out of it and brother Anderson you can't shake yourself out of it you need to vine intervention so if in your in that case tonight just keep trusting in God keep confessing that God is going to bring me out I am NOT able to bring myself out I've gone to deeper I Baxter too far or I've made too many mistakes but you've got to confess that God is able to bring you out amen you just can't shake yourself out of this habit or shake yourself out of this feeling or shake yourself out of this thought or behavior but God is able to deliver you and I amen we must let the will of Evan come down to earth they meant and that's what I think all of our lives just surround about we just want to do what God wants us to do I don't care how big the church is how small the churches we don't care how big of how much money we have we're not interested in how famous we are we just want to do what Christ wants us to do amen that ought to be our greatest desire of our hearts so program says how Paul was caught up and he saw these things and and he couldn't talk about them but he could confirm that what Moses saw he brought to earth amen now the next sow that's the first thought the second thought that we'll get to this is probably the last thought will get to tonight because brother Ham spends most of the sermon talking about this thought he said and round about the throne so now program stops and he literally says I'll show it to you program literally says the spirit told me to say these things so this is important something we can't rush over and as I'm studying and praying I can't brush over something like this if the Holy Spirit told brother Graham to stop and teach it I think we need it today amen so buttering reads and round about the throne he said watch it's such a beautiful picture here don't miss it the throne he said now there's no use he said I can't I was going to pass this up I just can't do it where's the blackboard did you take it back is it back doc well maybe I can make you see it from here he said look get your presence of paper so I want to say something here I was saying this morning as something came to me so it was that that morning and this is the first day of this is January 1st 1961 that morning before service the Holy Spirit came to brother Branham and said teach this to the people he said I was sitting there something came to me now tell you what I did if you notice I got to draw on the back of here see just drawed it out as the spirit gave it to me draw it out here of what it be but I want to say something right here now you know what we're gonna get to we're gonna get to how man has three courts like the tabernacle of Moses had three courts God gave brother ran that drawing in order that he might share it with us praise the Lord now he said now God when he is enthroned he is then judge is that right when does the judges judge when he comes to the judgment seat of throne now I want you to watch how the Old Testament was made how the courts approaching to his throne was made how the he says and how John saw here we won't get it in this morning all of it but how John saw the same courts of the approach to him what the approach to his courts is now oh I love this so he keeps emphasizing the approach to the throne in the Old Testament there was called the congregation where the people gathered for thing before they come in the congregation to enter in there they had to come under the shed blood outer courts first they came to the waters of separation where the red heifer was killed and made of waters of separation that's the sinner who comes and listens at the word now preach that back in December after I went to I'm sorry in January after I went to North Carolina to preach down there but member before they could even get in here they had to have an experience with God out here before they could ever before the high priest or anyone could have the the very Shekinah glory an experience with God before anybody can have that they had to have an anointing in the outside of the outer courts and that's called the sprinkling of the waters of separation as we preached on about four months ago now notice what the Bible says in the New Testament let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience so before the sprinkling you have an evil conscience I did something wrong I should not it did that I'm guilty I'm a sinner I'm in sin after you're sprinkled you no longer have that conscience so sprinkling is an anointing it's not the filling or the sealing what we see a lot another all ranks as we see people get a little bit of sprinkling on them they get all excited you give them out six months or a year or five years or as we see lately three or four decades and pretty soon they leave the message it's because they never that's all they got at the beginning was a nice sprinkling they didn't feel this evil conscious anymore oh my I've been forgiven oh my but they never really got in to where we're going to go tonight that's true so this is not a filling it's not a sealing like I talked to Denise your brother's all the time because a Bible Club we have different brothers come in probably four or five brothers every year come in and they talk and they always say this you know they always say oh when you're forgiven the Holy Spirit's filling you and every time I in my mind I say no it's not and I've talked that to the kids that's not the fill the Holy Spirit see they know if they've said forgive me Lord I'm sorry they know what the presence of God feels like they know what the the sprinkling feels like in the outer courts and it feels good anybody know if it feels good tonight anybody ever felt forgiven tonight it feels good this evil conscious Oh your gift is your fault you're going to hell that leaves you when you're sprinkled by the blood of Christ amen if you don't feel like that it's time to get sprinkled again is that right because it's an evil conscience people feel evil I've done something evil I must be wrong God must be mad at me it's an evil conscience and so you've got to go in the prints of God by his approach and get sprinkled get anointed so you don't feel that anymore amen and notice this is the first now that we feel this after God's forgiveness through repentance this is the first step in the approach to God the lack of sprinkling explains why people take God's word or his house or spirit so lightly because they're cut off that's what we looked at in January so I think I was reviewing this because I thought some new people might come tonight I was under the impression they would come but apparently they didn't make it but that's okay so I wanted to review this just briefly remember I don't care how long you've been in the church if something died in your tent let's say that tent right there is yours if something died in there you cannot come here and experience any worship until you've been sprinkle with the waters of separation I don't care how long you've been the message if you let something die in your Tet and if you don't get clean you're going to be infected with death right and that's what we type so powerfully by the Holy Spirit speaking you know to different churches Iowa North Carolina it types so perfectly this is why the church gets boring after a while because people let dead things come into their home and they don't get clean when they come to the house of God and God spiritually shuts them out of the church it's exactly right because the Bible said whosoever touches a dead body of any man that's dead and purifies not himself we've got to come to church and get pure but people don't pray don't read their Bible don't listen to brother rhythm so their impure they live in sin they keep sinning and so they don't feel impure instead they have an evil conscience and if they don't purify themselves they defile the tabernacle the Lord not only did they have deadness in their home they make this place dirty too because a little leaven leavens the whole church see I thought I'd be reviewed a little bit tonight maybe it's good though and that so low so now God goes down to the very soul of the man what kind of a nature of a person wouldn't want to be clean and try to approach into God what condition would your soul be in if you know you're dirty and you won't get clean my oh what a responsibility if we're nowhere wrong let's confess it to God and if we sinned against somebody else let's confess it to them because some sins are just against God other sins are against other people see that soul shall be cut off from Israel I don't care how long they've been the church because the water separation was not sprinkled upon him he shall be unclean his uncleanness is yet upon him in other words your unconfessed sin is still upon you remember that woman that Sunday school teacher that brother Branham interviewed she'd spent all of her husband's money her husband worked for Chevy Company remember that she spent all this money at psychiatrists all these things and brother Graham saw the vision of how she had an adultery remember that and brother Branham said you'll never get anywhere with God she never could get anywhere with God until she went and confessed that adultery to her husband nothing was going to heal her nothing was gonna help her not she was never going to get any better until she confessed until she retired herself by confession by repentance and then the sprinkling of the blood could be sprinkled on her amen that's exactly right for years and years going to the side psychiatrist I feel bad for people don't you feel sorry for people that got to go to psychiatrists it you feel awful for them your burden for them and because you and I know they need to do is get in the presence of God and God will show them if they've wronged someone or if someone's wronged them and God will show them you've got to make this right and then all that evil conscience will pass away and the person can rejoice that Christ's blood has forgiven them amen oh my they'll spend thousands of dollars they'll spend all kinds of money to try to get a peace of mind but all you got to do is get on our knees in the presence of Jesus Christ amen now program goes on to tell us the approach that's just a small review there the real approach actually had four steps you had to be clean by the waters of separation before you ever came into the outer court so before you could ever go the brazen altar and have your Lambs neck cut in and hold that lamb and see the priest you know applies hand to the head and transfer your sins to the lamb before you could even enjoy that you had to be forgiven first you had to be made clean you couldn't be contacting dead things and that's why people they can't cry anymore when we sing about Jesus they don't cry anymore the cross doesn't mean anything to them because they still got an evil conscience the cross is just about just the cross we're into deeper things now we want deep things but without the cross it doesn't mean anything amen we have to have the cross first and then we'll go deeper deeper deeper deeper in the love of God amen you got to have both you got deep things you got at the cross but the cross is the way to get there hallelujah if not you're just climbing in another way you're a robber without the wedding garments we said last week trying to get into the mysteries of God without having the Spirit of God first day men and so see that's why the holy place and this in the holy place that's where we have the seven church age is the candlesticks that's why it doesn't mean anything to anybody or the book doesn't mean things to people it doesn't mean anything prayer doesn't mean anything it's that last before the holiest of holies all church prayers got to mean something if we never if we're having a great prayer time hallelujah if not our heart should be grieved that we're not where we need to be in prayer because prayer brings you in to the presence of Christ amen and prayers what changes things amen hallelujah oh these ought to mean more to us all the time but see if there's dead things in our homes dead things in our lives dead things on our phones doesn't mean much anymore he's speaking of the high priest he went there and offered the blood on the mercy seat once a year and while he was in there he was privileged to see that she kind of glory when the pillar of fire the amber light that come down that led the children of Israel he even smoked up the temple so no one could see it the glory Lord fell so that was all smoked up and he came in himself went in behind the veil and settled down on the mercy seat in the holiest of Holies most holy place it's called holy of Holy's and he had to be dressed a certain way walk a certain way anointed a certain way he was a special person to go there how the congregation must have envied him I love that phrase God but when Jesus died the temple veil rent not only a high priests but whosoever will can have that same anointing of the Shekinah glory and walk a holy life holy holy holy unto the Lord and approach in the very presence of God through the blood of Jesus Christ before him now like this this is applying this to our daily life and God help us here tonight as we're praying for sick people tonight we look on brother Graham he makes this holy holy holy so simple this is how we should apply holy holy holy to our lives brother Ram said Lord Jesus here lays a sick man he's my brother he's on the deathbed right now to die I'm approaching you holy holy holy unto the Lord and that beautiful just like Aaron would say holy holy holy unto the Lord he'd swing that back and forth with the incense that's what it's like when we pray Lord I'm coming here right now for sister so-and-so right I got my moves mixed up here I don't have any rhythm as long as I got the rhythm of the heartbeat of Christ that's all that matters they glory but this is the tough simple brother that makes it when you start praying say Oh God my child is sick or Oh God my grandmother's sick or my grandfather or whoever maybe that's us doing holy holy holy unto the Lord and the God says what for he says as a high priest what for in behalf of my brother holy holy holy unto the Lord he said there you are your daily walk your daily talk your daily behavior your heart so an all holy holy unto the Lord no roots of bitterness no nothing else holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy holy unto the Lord as we begin to approach in behalf of our brother how many appreciate that I love the simplicity that brother Graham teaches us to apply the Word of God to our lives when we close our eyes it's as if we're saying holy holy holy we want to come in the presence of God whosoever will may come anointed blood in front of him the blood going before him playing holy holy holy unto the Lord amen praise God now he gets in the next thought here I'm gonna go to the next stop well the RAM preaches that there are three Thrones brother Ram says heaven Christ and now man are three Thrones and I want to just make sure I clear something up here some people you know some people take this thought and they go too far with it so let me just clarify here but Ram says this he says now the first throw was in heaven the judgment seat the second throne was in Christ the third throne is in man now some people preach it they wrong they say okay not now the throne now you know when Jesus on earth they say oh now the throne of heaven wasn't in heaven God wasn't on his throne anymore now it's only in Christ and that's wrong and then now people say well well now the Thrones on the heart and so Jesus isn't really the throne anymore that's not the right thought heaven was not bankrupt when Jesus was on earth how many understand that Jesus looked up and said father glorify thy name and a voice from heaven came a man heaven was not bankrupt so see people get this doctrine all wrong they make heaven bankrupt when Jesus on earth and today they make Jesus in heaven bankrupt but now we're the throne of God like I'm the walking literal throne of God you are not I am NOT the walking literal throne of God but we are carriers of the Word of God amen it's the word that we're carrying amen it's the Holy Spirit that's sealed inside of us but I am NOT the literal throne of Jesus Christ I'm not that Thrones in heaven tonight amen so see people take it too far jesus said father and then the voice came from heaven and said I have both glorified it and I will glorify it again heaven was not bankrupt when Christ was on the earth that's just shows how great God is amen the Bible said the fullness of the Godhead bodily was in Christ and yet there's Christ with all of God and there's God in heaven as well not two people but God being able to divide himself amen God dividing himself separating herself and yet he's no lesser of God he's still the great almighty eternal God hallelujah look what Jesus said and these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said why did he just lift his eyes to his heart if he was the only throne of God because there was still God on the throne in heaven Jesus and lift up his eyes heaven said father the hour has come glorify thy son and I said also may glorify thee Jesus also said and call no man your father upon the earth for one as your father which is where in heaven now remember with Jesus member Moran said it's like having a dual personality sometimes Jesus's flesh would talk but then sometimes God would talk so in this case the flesh is talking right but when God would talk he would say before Abraham was I am right one of them said show us the father and he says have I been so long with you and you don't know me Philip he said I my father are one so see sometimes God was talking and sometimes the flesh of Jesus was talking and memories don't ever forget this because this really knocks the Trinity out of the ballpark jesus said the father is greater than I and the church said I might knock out some of people study theology but that's the Holy Scripture the father is the eternal spirit right created that body to draw it so of course that eternal spirit is greater than a flesh body the body of Jesus could die God's Spirit could never die its eternal life amen and we see that knocks out every Trinitarian definition because as it says all three persons are eternally co-equal and all these things like this and see they don't rightly divide the word that's a doctrine from the pits of hell because it creates three gods mass behind oh it's just three persons but one one essence Oh nonsense we don't need a Creed to explain God we've already got the Bible to explain God you see so see this thought of how the throne that's where message people got to be careful well when Jesus here there was no throne then Jesus was the throne and now I'm the throne of God if we're not careful that's blasphemy oh I'm the throne of god I'm gonna fullness of the Godhead no you're not proves you're not when you lie right through your teeth and say you are you understand by God's grace here's what we're trying to say brother Branham was saying judgment has gotten closer and closer as time passed from heaven see we used to be they used to be judged from heaven and it's got above us now when Christ come down now it's God with us and now in each and every heart now it's God in us in other words the Holy Ghost has gotten closer and closer to man and aren't you glad if you've got the Holy Ghost you've got eternal life in you this evening amen and yet it's in you but yet it's on the throne tonight as well hallelujah the Eternal Spirit of God can't be into just one space he's too great for that he can be wherever he wants to be here's where he says it romance now listen close he says so close then this should be kind of glory rays from that mercy seat one day and it settled on another Tabernacle amen this one the father judges no man but he's committed all judgment to the son God's judgement seat whew do you speak against me it will be forgiven you speak another another one coming another mercy seat speak you speak against the son of man how forgive you but some nay the Holy Spirit will come to dwell in the hearts of the people one word against it will never be forgiven now look at by the NSSC it keeps getting more severe and more severe all the time the judgment so the Spirit of God is getting closer with all these three dispensations of the Godhead the Holy Ghost was getting closer and closer and closer for judgment will prove it to you from the Word of God he said because God is continually wearing his patients aren't you glad God wears his patient out oh my he's wearing it out for you and hi he's wearing it out for the world he waited all these years until nineteen I'm sorry till 2000 when I finally gave my heart to Lord he waited twenty years so I could finally give my heart to the Lord he was where is patience out on me I'm thankful for the patience of God amen I'm so glad amen he said now trying to get sinners to come to him to be reconciled first he was in the heavens above and shining through the Stars the second he was on earth shining through the Shekinah glory next he come and was made flesh and dwelt among us so see brother man actually lists a fourth one there did you catch that he said he was in the heavens and the here he's on earth with Moses who actually says four Thrones so that's another thought where you could take four Thrones heaven Moses Christ now in the believers it's just God giving himself a witness on the earth that's what it is remember there must be witnesses in heaven he says this now he says there he redeemed man by blood came into his church in the form of the Holy Ghost and speak against that it's a finished thing done now you can see where the shaking come where the time they don't realize people can't comprehend what it means praise the Lord I hope I didn't lose anybody on that what I'm saying is that some people preach it in a way where they make you the throne of God where actually you are not the heavenly throne of God you are an extension of that throne you're a witness of that throne hallelujah right you're you're a witness of that hallelujah you're an extension of that but you and I are not the fullness of the Godhead bodily we're not that's absolutely true now brother Dave also says it like this he says there's a type of judgment at all three Thrones how we know this there's three there's judgments at all these Thrones and we can even throw Moses's in there but I didn't throw it in there because brother Graham says there's three side tried to stay with that one so there's a type of judgment from heaven there was a type of judgment in Christ and then there's a type of judgment today see God's throne the extensions of God's throne are getting closer and closer and closer to us where now it's walking right amongst us someone can speak the Word of Life if they've got the Holy Spirit they can speak the word of life and just like Jesus said if you speak it on earth he said how honor in heaven amen if you loose it on earth I loose it in heaven if you bind it on earth I'll bind it in heaven amen see God wants to get closer and closer he wants to bring his presence closer and closer to the people that's exactly right so look here's the heavenly throne in Samuel this is Hannah's prayer she said the adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces out of heaven shall the Thunder shall he's under upon them the Lord shall judge where is he judging from out of heaven he thunders from heaven and here the judgments come from heaven and he shall judge the ends of the earth and he shall give strengthen to his king and exalt the Horn of his anointed her me now next missus the one brother random quote in the sermon he said the father judges no man would have committed all judgment unto the son okay so this is where we'd say now people can be judged based upon how they treat the son their right that's exactly right and now here's the one that's beautiful well we kind of looked at already now the Holy Ghost in men so Jesus Jesus was showing this throne is going to now kind of extend the extensions of this throne or we'd say the outposts of this throne or the representations of this throne are going to reach out because whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man it'll be forgiven him see Jesus was speaking of the church ages but unto him that blasphemy against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven how many can say amen to that so see Jesus making this this note the extension or them the manifestations of the throne of heaven is going to come closer and closer and closer and you'll have a chance to either accept the eternal life or reject it if you reject it judgment falls upon them that's right now this is the most beautiful one well not but to me it's very beautiful it's acts 13 verse 45 but when the Jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul contradicting and blaspheming they called the Holy Spirit of God evil they blaspheme it so what does Paul say then Paul and Barnabas wax bold and said it was necessary that the Word of God should have first been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the Gentiles so there's Paul Barnabas preaching the word they've got a human throne and the Holy Spirit is on that throne and the Holy Spirit is speaking to them to receive the word and they evil speak it they blaspheme it they put it from them and Paul says right there you've already judged yourself because it was an extension of the throne of God not the very throat of God but an extension of the throne of God are you with me Church hope that's not too deep hope it's not too strict a strange or anything like that if so let's go back and listen to it again you know it'll help you but we cannot make ourselves God fully God is in us but we are not the fullness of the Godhead bodily we are a portion of the word amen now let me look at this thought now see each person has each person is a judge each person has a throne because the Bible says this the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for their foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that a spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man praise the Lord you like that see when you are a spiritual person you look at how everything affects you how your friends affect you how these phone the phones and the tablets and you look at how the books you read how does it affect you you judge everything you're constantly judging why because your heart is the throne and Christ is sitting on the Holy Spirit I say like that I don't wanna get you confused with the body the Spirit of Christ is sitting on your throne judging your life praise God and the spiritual man just doesn't judge on Wednesday nights he judges on Wednesday morning she judges on Sunday morning Sunday night Monday morning Monday night a spiritual person is judging things all the time amen constant this is right this is too much I've gone too far forgive me Lord Lord I'm coming back oh I know I need more of this or I gotta pray more I got to read more of my word I gotta Amen the word more I got to love God more I got to see God more see you're judging things all the time amen this person's a little bit crooked here I got to make sure I judge them right I gotta make sure I judge and watch my I'll watch how much time I spend around that person I got to make sure this influence doesn't influence me the wrong way you're constantly judging things you ever get the others your mind never get tired of judging things sometimes your mind gets tired anybody ever feel stressed out this week you know you're fighting the only thing you're fighting these demon powers no I'm not gonna argue oh you're not school that's all there's arguments at school I get so many shoutouts and argues it I got to make so many decisions by the end the day sometimes about I can't judge anything else I always like in judges I need to go home but a spiritual person constantly judging what's this email is it what spirit what spirit is behind this email what spirit is behind this sermon it's the Holy Spirit then you have to judge that and so this is what a spiritual person does because they've got a throat and someone's on that throne it's constantly judging things that are approaching that throne amen now look at this I know you've maybe heard me preach this if you haven't then this is for you and this I pray Paul says that your love may abound now bow means to increase yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment God wants our judgment to increase oh I didn't see this five years ago but this really hurts my life I'm growing in judgment I'm able to move past this now or oh I never really noticed that little music or I never know notice how this this certain individual impacts me and they're critical so I'm real critical afterwards or they got an angry spirit and they make me angry right and you grow and say ah yes that's right I've got a I got to be more judgment I gotta be more careful what I do with my words and my thoughts we got to be better judges now most people like Saab mostly we're like Solomon because most people are born again I'm talking about in nominal churches as they get older they get more relaxed on God oh I can allow a little bit of more TV in my life oh it's okay mercy I've been in the church three times this week already I'm so anointed I can handle a little bit of dirty jokes and that's wrong they can't you can't and so most people get relaxed and like brother Adam says in the church age books they find themselves doing things that they wouldn't do when they first came in the message so instead of growing in judgment they actually get dull of judgment it's called dull of hearing they can't hear the word of God anymore so why do we grow in judgment so we can improve oh this I approve of this this is good to be in my life I approve of this I could take that into my heart I can approve this or disproof things that are excellent that we may be sincere without offence to the day of Christ being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God how many want to be filled with the fruits of righteousness that your life is right you're doing the right things that's righteousness the right things and you've approved well I allow this because I know this is right I'll be just very honest with you church you know one of the things where I've got to constantly make sure I'm watching the prove of is with music I wasn't raised in a message church so I'm used to you know I'm using I'm used to loud drums and a little bit of electric guitar and I know a lot of churches have like your guitar albian has electric guitar they're real gentle with it you know brother Donny happy Valley Church got an electric guitar even brother Humes down there and North God he had electric guitar well that's one thing if if I'm not careful I'll let a song I'll play a song or I'll start liking a song that's got a little too much of that a little bit too much and if I'm not careful then I'll start like another one like that and this is where I know I'm growing in that because I'm starting to get rid of that oh I didn't catch that before I got rid of that and so I'm seeing myself growing that and be able to catch the right music by the grace of the Lord how many can understand that that's the area where I know I've grown but I also know I need to really rely upon the Lord so know yours might be in what you believe you know maybe you just believe other things that maybe aren't exactly scriptural so you've got to really make sure the things you approve that you believe are actually the scriptural truth or might be relationships you know you're just kind of lacks with relationships and you'll just be anybody's friend and you'll just do whatever they ask you to do and there's no boundaries and you find yourself being influenced by other people that you shouldn't be being influenced by and so we need God's help to grow in that area I want to be filled with his love let me fill with this fruit you see this is what the this is the thought brother branham is bringing out that we have our own throne and people will contact God through us right cuz program said God has no hands for yours and is yours and mine right he has no feet with your feet he has no voice right now except your voice so we are the extension were the representations of the throne of God look what Jesus said I haven't seemed like I hadn't read this in years and just kind of blessed me today I like my I forgot about that story Moses therefore gave you the circumcision not because it is a Moses but of the father's and yet on the Sabbath day circumcise a man I say I forgot I forgot that the Jews were were circumcising on the Sabbath I forgot about that so here they are working on the Sabbath you know imagine how bloody and gross that would be circumcisions and then they see Jesus here on the Sabbath and they get all upset yeah they got blood and they got gauze and they're you know they're cleaning it up and they got alcohol to clean the cuts and wounds they're working over here in surgeries and they see Jesus heal a paralyzed person they get upset you're working on the Sabbath and yet they're over here we're working on the Sabbath - oh my goodness it's so much hypocrisy in church if we're not careful we'll be the same way all right we'll look at other churches say look what they do look what they allow and if we're not careful we might allow some of that sinful - look at verse 23 if a man the Sabbath day received circumcision that the law of Moses should not be broken and you're angry at me because I made a man every wood hole in the Sabbath day can't you see your hypocrisy he said judge not according to the appearance but Judge righteous judgment so Jesus gives us the license we are supposed to judge but we must do it righteously right he gives us that he he he doesn't say boy don't judge he says no judge righteously because everybody has a throat everybody's got to make judgments somebody is ruling every person's life here tonight and it needs to be the Holy Ghost same ahead because he's the real judge he's the onus he's the only judge and we need I need Christ to judge things in my life just like you do I've got a constantly say Lord is this right I got to say holy holy holy unto the Lord is this right is this the right thing to say is this the right thing to do should i download this should I not watch this what should I do we've got to approve everything by the judge that's in our heart amen this is what Bertram's teaching this with the Holy Spirit told brother Ram to bring out to the people I love it now here's where now this is here's an example where Jesus Jesus was the throne of God okay an extension of the throne of God of course we know the fullness of God was in him but member he still said father they were still father on the throne as well at the same time jesus said he that rejects me and received not my words hath one that judgeth the word that I've spoken the same shall judge him at the last day so see Jesus was saying you know eventually the Holy Ghost is going to be the judge and you'll either judge yourselves worthy or judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life but the word that he preached to everybody those words wouldn't meet them all on the day of judgment because it was God's word issuing forth from the throne of God and church how many couldn't how many understand that when we come in here any preacher who's annoyed that the Holy Ghost it is God's voice speaking out from his throne unto us is every understanding that that's why I church is so important and I don't want to miss any I don't want to miss any Word of God that God is trying to clean out my life or God is trying to encourage me or strengthen me or heal me whatever he's trying to do I want God's voice in my life amen I want to hear the voice from the throne hey man Alleluia now I got about all these taps I didn't mean to do this this is the last thought I'm gonna try to close with this and give me about 15 minute - I had all these taps here so this is the thought brother Graham ends well I'm sorry exactly there's actually more thoughts I haven't gotten to he's got a few more thoughts we'll get to that next time so we see how this outer core is the body of man program says the Holy Spirit want him to say this then you have the spirit of man which is the holy place that's the human spirit then you have the soul of man which is the holiest of holies or the nature of the very nature of the human being all right now this is the illustration brother Ram drew it out of the chalkboard you drew it on the paper to show the people this is the illustration and the Bible says we've got three parts I pray your whole spirit soul and body be preserved blameless on the coming of the Lord so the Holy Spirit wanted you and I to know that we are a triune being now he says this I want to just read I don't have the quotes up here I just have it right here he said what is man he's a triune being body soul spirit how many know was that he said watch God's approach what is what is his heart you remember my message God chose a man's heart for his control tower the devil chose his head for the control tower see he makes him see things look through his eyes but God in his heart makes him believe things that he cannot see so Satan wants you to believe just the things that you can see God wants you to close your eyes and believe things you cannot see that's the beauty of prayer amen he says see God is on his heart in the heart of man is the throne of God you get it God made his throne in the heart of man he said that's the first part of it he said what's the first part of man the first part of man in his body the next part is his soul but brother man means spirit because he fixes it later in 1963-64 and 65 he said and now he approaches now the third part is his soul and the soul is the center of his heart and the center of his heart is where God comes for the throne now program goes back to the outer courts let's look at this outer courts for a moment he says now what is the outer court that's the flesh that's the first thing you come to to the flesh he says you've got to consume that first you've got to pass beyond the flesh and here's the example brother Bram gives now I didn't make this up brother branham said this he says this is how you passed me on the flesh he said I don't feel like getting up and going to church the roads are too slick in India Jeffersonville Indiana but man said that's the flesh so anytime you try to make an excuse well I'm coughing a little bit probably shouldn't go to church stub my toe yesterday probably shouldn't go to church roads might be a little slick but Ram said that's the flesh and you've got to get past that he said oh it's too slick or that's too hot tonight the firt or the air conditioners broken at church better not go to church tonight better stay home and livestreamer if I even do that maybe I'll just you know go out and do some errands for the under stay he said that's the flesh he said now you got to consume that and walk through that God has to get through that the next time he come he comes into the spirit he says Oh what will the Jones say about me you know my church will kick me out if I do something like that he said you've got to walk through that so the flesh is like I just don't even want to go or not for us it's like this I'm too tired to pray I said I guess I'm too busy to pray that's where the flesh battles us probably the most right oh I can't do it from two-time ironer I'm too busy the example he gives us oh I could never know he's talking about spiritual gifts like oh I could never dance the spirit I could never speak in tongues I can never shout and cry because what will the people think about me in the church they'll think you got the Holy Ghost is probably they'll think it's a church amen they'll think they'll think like you're anointed or something like that if I see somebody shout or cry or raise their hands or rejoice I think by the holy spirits here praise God God finally got ahold of somebody hey man I love those times hallelujah like Sunday was a great weeping time for me all that message on léa léa love to the Lord just oh I just felt like I was back at Calvary forgiven wash on if God loved Leah and God kept all the promises to Leah and made her a builder of the house of God despite having eye trouble did you catch that like Paul she had eye trouble like Paul she was tender eyed she wasn't as beautiful maybe she had high trouble and couldn't see as well well so did Paul Paul said I wrote so big a letters because I've got eye trouble he said you were too gripped out your eyes and given to me if I would ask you for Oh hallelujah look at that we've got to come through the flesh and come here then we got to come here we got to forget what anybody says we just got to realize God's here and then he said if you can go through that he said and then when you can walk through that then he goes into the heart and that's where he's thrown so the baptism of the Holy Ghost means Christ is fully throned in your heart and then everything that judged or that his judge must come through the Holy Spirit now we know even the Holy Ghost filled people can make mistakes right Paul said I want to do good but evils right there with me the good that I want to do I don't do remember Paul caught Peter and said oh you're the guilty one you know you've separated yourself from the Gentiles remember that and he was to be blamed so Peter was basically a segregationist at one point he was segregated I kind of said like this racist can I say like that he was racist against Gentiles for a while I wouldn't eat with them and Paul had to come straighten him out but see a real child of God can be straightened out that's right Oh Graham said see he's thrown that's the Holy Spirit Jesus said it before now he even brings it down to children who will eventually be filled with Holy Spirit he said any better than a millstone was hanging at your neck and he was drowning the depths of the sea then they even offend one of these little ones that believe in me hey man I think about all these Catholic priest Church that have offended God's little children and they've deceived them and take him in the back room and done evil things jesus said to be better that a millstone was hanging around their neck and you know this church I have an article from the Washington Post from two weeks ago I never preached it I was trying to get there I guess it's for tonight and the Washington Post I mean oh that's a very respected journal or newspaper and they had a man who interviewed the Pope and in the interview the man the man who was abused with the Pope how he been abused by some other priests and the Pope said don't you know abuse is not a sin he said it's just a mistake in that awful and that's in print that's for the whole world to see abusing a child is not a sin that's from the pizza hell that's why she's called the mother harlot that's why she's called the a mother of abomination and that's why the throne in heaven will rejoice when she's judged because it mean better if a millstone is always wrapped around that priests neck and thrown the seat than to offend one of these little children hallelujah can you imagine the wicked perversion I don't care how nice he looks I don't care that he drives the Escalade well they drive him in escalator a Royals Royce or whatever you call it Mercedes man's the outside has nothing to do with it he's got to be clean on the inside and that proves he's never been washed on the inside amen if you can look at sexual abuse and say oh it's not a sin it's just a mistake I got the article if you want to I'll text it to you after church if you want it my eyes were my I just came to tears my I felt I felt emotion coming up and to be ready to cry are you kidding me the man that everybody looks as you know Rick Warren says our Pope you know I hate to call names everybody just kind of stepped out there but people call them our Pope he's not my Pope God is my Heavenly Father and I only got one Heavenly Father that's the Holy Father amen to see you think about one of these children and I know people that were abused as children that are now Christians in the message and think about that abuser when that abuser snuck up on that individual wherever they were outside at a park or in a home wherever they were when that abuser snuck up they were really stinking up on a potential throne of God let me understand what I'm saying where the Word of God that's why I Paul said don't you know that the Saints will judge the earth because that was a potential throne of God and that person came in there to a temple of God which housed the throne of God and defiled that temple and they'll answer at the day of judgment if not confess they'll answer the day of judgment for defiling the temple of God everybody with me and so this is Nishan this is so important for us to know and applying to this day and age that no matter what the outer court looks like it's about what's on the inside they could white wash their clothes the Pharisees could whitewash the tombs and the cephalic curves and make everything look beautiful but inside it was full of dead men's bones death was actually on the inside all right but Ram said do not do them any harm just even to bring a fence of them just upset them about something it'd be better that you were you yourself drowned or never been born on the earth then even to bring it an offense to one did he mean it could Jesus lie did the apostles say it he said jesus said it jesus said if even bring an offense to one of them little ones that believe in me oh my now brother Brad now gives another example let's let's go to another example brother man talks about a preacher who preaches the gospel but he doesn't believe in mark 16 anymore these signs shall follow them to believe and the brother gives up he gives a conversation with the preach who doesn't believe and he said these signs shall follow them that believe and some great big fella say all I believe in hallelujah have you ever spoken tongues interpret tongues cast out devils visions as he promised no that's the days pass brother Bram said that man is not a believer because a believer believes all the Word of God and the power of God Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe he said that's the last words he says that's the Bible see that man he says is a make believer now here's what bro Graham tells us he said fine but when you find a believer that really believes with signs following and you see the humility of their life not an impersonator you know that they are a Christian a real genuine article just keep still the thing you ought to do is join right up with them start moving along because you're moving right up the Kings Highway amen hallelujah that's what we have at our church we have gifts in our church we know that many of us haven't seen signs miracles and wonders how many can say amen to that so the thing to do is stay with the Word of God stay with those who are living a humble life brother Branham says the humility of their life not in a person ater trying to impersonate the message but someone who lives the message now program goes to the church ages he says the outer court with Luther Wesley pilgrim holiness and now the last day so brother BAM he gives that type to I want to make sure I say that I'm gonna close to this the last and your power with this but the last thing before the holiest of holies was the veil and I want to just bring this out I don't think I've ever preached this specifically so I just want to close with this thought and I'll read - I'll read the quote here now brother Branham says how there's five gates to the outer court there's a see taste see smell and hear and there's five gates to the inner court which is a conscious reason affection imagination and I always forget one of them conscious reason affection imagination what's the other one memory yes conscious memory reason affection imagination yeah memory thank you I always forget one of those it seems like I can always get for him I got that fifth one he says now it's got these gates he still remember there was a veil a veil that hangs between the holy and the holiest of Holies and the hoist of hoist is where Christ comes to sit on your hearts throne Christ is enthroned he comes through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost that veil he says you know what that male is that bails your heart from it he said are you ready let me know what it is he says that bail is called self-will let's say together ready self-will brother Ram said this veil is self-will which makes perfect sense it shows how people can come all the way but then be lost the Bible said member they can trample they can be sanctified and trample publicly the son of God and beat them for it see they can follow along they could enjoy the cross they can do you enjoy the church ages the mysteries the bread and the prayer but they can't actually their prayers can't actually get them in the presence of God because they still have the will of themselves so brogrammer said what is keeping people out he said itself will you get the picture now their senses of the body senses to the spirit but the veil between that and the holy place he said his self will and the only way you can get in there is to have self will for whosoever will he said whoever whoever shakes hands know who suffers immersed know who sever joins the church know who suffer passes his letter know who sever will come behind the veil he said let Christ come to the senses and say well I ought to I don't want to go to hell that's one thing I'll join church he says all right Luther and I've had Lutheran's literally tell me that last fall I went to that reunion member I did the football reunion last year remember that back in the December I literally had a Lutheran I was witnessing this Lutheran about the Lord he's an older man he's of custodian at our old high school and I was witness to his about the Lord and talking all about Jesus and I was getting really excited he's like Oh Luther's don't know about that we're just saved by grace you know he literally told me that as I said if you knew why ever want to know any more let me know he's a Lutheran and he literally realizes I want to drink my alcohol but I want to be saved too and I've had I've had numerous Lutheran's tell me that as well because I grew up in a in a town that had a lot of Lutheran's and some of them were my best friends that's how I know that now not every Lutheran's like that my wife was a Lutheran by the way but now she's a Holy Ghost filled Saint so she knows about that's a lot of people's attitudes like they know Lutheran's know they don't have as much doctor as a Baptist right they know that and they know they don't have as much charismatic worship as the Pentecostals they know that and many of them are okay see they failed to go on past this outer court they know they haven't gone on to into here now how do we know we've gone on to here because jesus said the Holy Ghost will guide you into all truth everything the Bible says you want to live it you want to believe it you want to see God manifested in every part of your life and you're so hungry for God you just want more of God all the time a man because he's at hungers and thirst for righteousness shall be filled that's right church but Aram said all right whoever will let him come past the ribbon veil all glory to God I'm on the other side Halle tuning to his name whosoever will let him tear it down tear down the curtains of his own will that's beautiful and let God come into his heart there's Christ on his judgement seat in the human heart what's to happen now this is my last thought so bear with man just give me five more minutes as my last thought brother branham brings us out and now remember the Scriptures I mentioned earlier you judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life remember that now that the Holy Ghost is here when a real believer preaches the word or witnesses or lives the life of God it says anything from Christ's anointing to that person and bites them to church if they turn that down right there that could be them being judged and miss eternal life right there right because that's what happened Paul said they blaspheme they've judged themselves unworthy of everlasting life that's why every meeting we have is so important we've got to constantly walk holy holy holy unto the Lord now remember we also have the confidence though that all that the father has given me will come to me so we have that confidence to here's my last thought this is the from brother BAM this is paragraph 277 now brother man is talking about sinners they say oh you say I can tell dirty jokes it don't condemn me and women can say I have short hair it don't condemn me I can wear shorts it don't condemn me men can say it don't hurt me to smoke cigars and don't hurt me to play some cards and shoot dice it don't hurt me and brother BAM says that's because there's nothing there on your throne to condemn you for it the church said why doesn't it condemn people like women when they cut their hair or men when they tell filthy jokes or lust after other wit men's wives or single women or whatever watch pornography why doesn't it condemn them because Christ is not sitting on the throne of their heart is that right he says but when Christ comes in you prated an altar on your heart and your sins are taken daily as the great Saint Paul said I die daily nevertheless I live but not me Christ liveth within me he says there's the Intervale brother sister let's stand to our feet there's the Intervale praise God so the Holy Spirit inspired the prophet of God to share these circles he called him the three parts and the show this is why people don't feel condemned when they do wrong Church aren't you glad that you feel bad when you sin aren't you aren't you glad that something says no you should not have done that I remember brother Richard Sanchez from Sheffield when I first became in the message you know he said brother Jesse said one day I was at work and I was chewing some chewing gum and I just opened it up and he stopped through the paper back and he said I can't walk it he said all of a sudden the Holy Spirit said I didn't like that just a simple example he said he went back and picked that up and he said then he felt back in fellowship with the Lord and that's what it is Church that's I Christ should sit on all of our Thrones of our hearts that so when we do just one little thing wrong we can hear this still small voice and said I didn't mean that lord please forgive me I'll make that right as soon as I possibly can that wasn't the right thing to say wasn't the right thing to think wasn't the right thing to do I thought that was a good example now Church we all know this too like in the case like like I said of st. Paul and st. Peter someone can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but if they stop listening to that judges voice and they start living in the flesh or living in the spirit they can grieve the Holy Spirit because that's what Paul says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed to the day of your Redemption and how many know that so we have to battle today grieving which means offending so sometimes we we fail to listen to the judge and when we do that we start living in our mind one smart enough to figure this out I'm clever enough I'm good enough I don't need to pray I don't need to die daily today I'm okay or whatever excuse it maybe and if we live out of here we grieve the Holy Spirit and that offends the Holy Spirit brother Branham says like a dove that flies away from your human spirit it never left your soul because your souls sealed to the day of your Redemption and that explains why people today can be born again and do sins they shouldn't do because they stopped hearing the voice from the throne on their heart we've got to be careful to listen to that voice how many would say you've heard the voice of God tune I speak to your heart amen I have to let's have a word of Prayer here as we get ready to close and sing some songs back I can come oh my you and I are so blessed that we can recognize our heart is a throne of Christ the Holy Ghost we are so blessed the Pope of Rome with gold all over his his neck and his fingers an unlimited bank account he can't even recognize that abusing children is wrong because there's nothing on the throne oh my thank God for the Holy Ghost in this hour thank God that God would condescend as we sang on Sunday down from his glory that God would condescend and have a little representation of a miniature throne here on earth and dwell in you and I Alleluia how many would say pray for me brother Jesse and I'll judge all things up my judgement will about my hands up as well I want I want my judgment to increase be more fruitful I'll pray for you church let's just all pray together for one another Heavenly Father Lord we love you tonight we recognize Lord that you put a throne in every heart of every individual law and every individual has to make a decision will they let you sit on their throne or will they allow the devil father many of us here made that decision many years ago we want you to sit upon the throne of our heart but Lauren I think we all can say tonight that we won our judgment to grow we want your voice from the throne of our heart to get louder we don't want to hush that holy voice of judgment we want to hear it more clearly so father help us tonight Lord God as we've looked at your scriptures Lord let us judge ourselves worthy of everlasting life let's be careful that we do not offend the little ones with word or anything Lord especially not physically but Lord not even with word one of these little ones that believes in you Lord God because they've got a little thrown upon their heart they're a little tabernacle of the Holy Ghost as well and Lord we would never wanted to file your house Lord God or any representation of your house granite Lord Jesus we are fully dependent depending upon the voice of the Holy Spirit on the throne of our heart dear God no wonder your spirit move the Prophet to preach this Lord God [Music] Lord if that self-will needs torn up Lord I pray you'd help us to tear that up tonight amen Lord anything that we want to do that doesn't line up with your plan may we tear that veil tonight Lord God afresh as even Jesus did it in the
