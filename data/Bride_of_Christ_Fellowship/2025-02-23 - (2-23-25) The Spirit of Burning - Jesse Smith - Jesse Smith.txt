love you Lord God so bless this service that you might be magnified and glorified that we could be more obedient we could be more sensitive to the holy SP Spirit we could be more pleasing to you Lord as your bride we want to make ourselves ready today so Lord Jesus minister to all the needs of your people today and the Saints said amen God bless you you can take your Bibles let's stand here let's go to Isaiah chapter 4 as I told you on Wednesday this is a my sermon I just want to preach a just a regular preaching sermon by God's grace now you know I'm going to mix some teaching in here but it's mainly going to be preaching today uh by God's grace trying to learn how to catch the thoughts of God Isaiah 4 and we'll just read verse 4 Isaiah 4:4 if I had a title this morning I'd like to preach on the spirit of burning I'd like to preach on that this morning the spirit of burning Isaiah 4 verse4 so as I was studying this week and reading through the book of Isaiah last few weeks here I saw this phrase and I thought oh my it's a spirit it's an attribute of the Holy Spirit I said I'd like to preach this to the church as soon as I read that thought about all these scriptures here so we'll try to preach this here by the grace of God hallelujah I know the spirit of burning is here hallelujah because I feel it burning in my heart Hallelujah so the spirit of God is here hallelujah he promised me wherever two or three are gathered there I am right there in the midst Hallelujah Isaiah 4:4 if you're there say amen amen we'll just read that one verse and then have you be seated by God's grace let me set my timer Isaiah 4:4 let's read that if we can on three 1 2 3 when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated Hallelujah so even just as I'm reading that you know I'm recognizing here you see the spirit of judgment which would be likely discernment and then the spirit of Burning uh by the grace of God so today Lord willing we'll just look at here the spirit of burning this is the phrase that kind of struck out to me uh and I read it a few weeks ago and I've been studying on it off and on and writing down all my thoughts uh as the spirit of God would Quicken it to us here so I'll start there in Isaiah chapter 4 so if you could just stay there in Isaiah 4 we'll read through this chapter uh by God's grace we'll start at vers verse one to kind of understand the context and I found out brother brandom said one time brother BR said the spirit of burning one time in the message the future home brother the future home so brother man reads this scripture and he it takes him to the Future home so let's read this again Ephesians I'm sorry sorry Isaiah 4 vers1 Isaiah 4 vers1 and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name and to take away our reproach verse two in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious I think about that Israel right think of Israel in that day and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and calmly for them that are escaped of Israel verse three and it shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion and he that remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be Called holy even everyone that is written among the living in Jerusalem so here's how they become holy right here's how Israel shall be become holy here we'd say in the tribulation period when God is done cuts off the Gentiles and goes back to the Jews verse four when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall Purge the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning verse five and the Lord will create upon every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion now look at that every dwelling place right so we have uh we know we have Mount Zion right but then we also have Mount Mariah we have those two mountains right where the Lord was crucified right so God specifically says Mount Zion the Lord will create upon every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion remember Mount Zion was a little bit larger Hill or Mountain there right next to uh the mount Mariah where the Lord off of that mount was the Lord crucified right there there in Jerusalem and upon her assembly is a cloud and smoke by day and The Shining of the flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defense amen so we see the pillar of fire is there with Israel during the Millennium and the church said the pillar of fire was with them when they came out of Egypt right fou them all the way Hallelujah LED them all the way to the promised land and here we see the pillar of fire is back with Israel in the Millennium here after of course after the fire of God has washed their lives clean Hallelujah verse six and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the Heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain so the pillar of fire will be a fire at times and then there'll be a cloud at times so it shows God is going to bring Israel back to the condition that they were in as far as the visible power of God the visible spirit of God is going to be there to be with Israel just as he was with Moses hallelujah what a blessing Hallelujah now let's go back to verse one let me lay this in here verse one did you know this brother Ram said verse one is about the Gentiles in the church age does anybody everybody remember that brother Ram talked about that verse one and in that day seven women brother mam said that's seven Church ages he said shall take hold of one man who's that man Christ saying we will eat our own bread in other words we don't want the bread of God we don't want Jesus bread we want a a Creed bread right we don't want we don't want your bread and we'll wear our own clothes or lack of clothes right they don't want to wear holy clothes and they don't now that's natural but what about spiritual they don't want the righteousness of Christ so they got their own food they got their own wardrobe brother man said we should have a clothline religion Hallelujah right you you should wear you should wear minus clothes that cover right don't sisters don't expose your shoulders Brothers don't do that either right cover from your shoulders down to your sins Hallelujah we got the we got the understanding of that that we don't want to show nakedness to the world only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach so all these churches they know they're living in sin they don't want to eat God's word they don't want God's righteousness right these seven women these seven Church agents they don't want the word of God they want to wear sexy clothes or lack of clothes they want to strip down but they still want to be called by Christian name right to take away their reproach now brother man of course tells us are they is this the true church no brother M tells us this is the false church so the false Gentile churches Chris you've been to some right lately we've been to some they they want the name of Jesus but they won't take on the bread of Jesus they won't put on the clothes that Jesus wants them to wear Hallelujah see that by God's grace they want the name of Jesus but they don't want uh the Life of Christ how many want the Life of Christ today now what's interesting is of course as you know if You' read the church age book brother Braham said as Jesus talked down to the church ages he was always talking to both groups the True Vine and the false Vine I'm talking about Revelation Chapter 2 and three when he would address the seven churches so I hope I hope this will help people by God's grace brother R said he said keep in mind that religion is composed of two parts that intertwine but are as opposite as black and white religion and the spiritual world are made up of these two trees which had their roots in Eden both the tree of life and the tree of knowledge good and evil still in the midst of the garden and no doubt their very branches intertwin each other what a thought that is see the it's so close the deception is so close it might even deceive the very elected but it won't deceive the elect Hallelujah but see how close the true is from the false their branches in Twingle I'm sorry in in in intertwin sorry inter Twingle that's a new word did I make a new word maybe it'll be the word of 2025 no let's not intertwine now intertwine he says thus in the Ephesian church is that same Paradox the church is made up of good and bad two Vines make the church they're like the wheat and the tears growing up side by side but one is the true the other is the false now God will speak to each one and will'll talk about each one he will but he will call them the church so that's why he said to the Church of Ephesus and notice he rebuked the Church of Ephesus for one thing they left their first love but Church let's be spiritual that wasn't the True Vine that left their first love it was the false Vine Hallelujah this is going to help somebody out if you really catch the revelation of this Hallelujah but they're so close he's got to speak to both because both want his name both claim his name that's why brother R said judas's name was on the book of life because he claimed to believe in Jesus but then it was blotted out because he betrayed the Lord he blasphemed the holy Spirit but see anyone who calls upon the name of the Lord right if they call on it if they claim to be a Christian their name's written in the book of life but if they don't obey the words of Christ their names can be blotted out right until you're born again but if you get born again then it proves your name was never on The Book of Life your name was on the Lamb's Book of Life two different sections brother Chris in the same book it's like two chapters in the same book you got the book of life and then you've got the Lamb's Book of Life because there's two kinds of Christians Hallelujah there's foolish Christians and there's also wise virgin Christians hallelujah hallelujah that's right it's so true and so uh brother R quotes Matthew 24:24 there shall AR arise false Christ and false prophets and show great signs and wonders in in in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect Hallelujah now I want to keep he he says it again here uh I want to read through this uh by God's grace you can see it he mentions it twice at least twice in the church age book sorry I lost my spot there this thing kind of jumps around if I tap the wrong thing so pardon me here let me get down to this quote there it is brother B said I've been saying right all along that there are actually two churches though the spirit speaks to both of them in each age as though they were but one Hallelujah he says what what churches will be those that do not know the truth of course it is the false Vine group because the True Believers certainly know that judgment begins where at the house of the Lord amen and they being God-fearing judge themselves that they be not judged so that's why we come to church we come to church to hear the word of God of course worship praise God but we hear that we come also that God would help us to judge our lives so we can get the the wrong sinful things out and get the right things in the anointings of of Christ Hallelujah we want the anointing of God that's why we come for the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning we're look at that here today now why does God call these churches his churches even though they're false Vine the truth of the matter is that they are Christians they are not Christians of the spirit they're Christians of the flesh Hallelujah like all these churches we've seen that fall fall away they're just Christians in the flesh they don't have the real holy spirit because if you had the real Holy Spirit it would produce the life of Jesus Christ right you you'd eat the bread of God you'd wear the right clothes You' judge your life clean you let the fire of God burn out the sin in your life yes they're bearing the name in vain as Mark 7:7 brother reads this verse how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men but indeed they are Christians for what else could they be a muhammadan or a Muslim is a Muslim that's his religion no matter how he lives it because he subscri rbes in theory to what the Quran teaches but brother says all these false findes he's a nominal Christian and belongs to the church but he's not a true or spiritual believer that kind of believer is one who's been baptized into the body of Christ and is a member of him but nonetheless it is God's order that the tears grow up with the wheat and they're not to be uprooted that is the command of God their day for binding and burning is coming but not yet Hallelujah wow what a blessing by God's grace now just apply this now to our church age we're not going to go there but Revelation 3:14 through 22 when Jesus says you're lukewarm and I know your Works he's not speaking to the True Vine and the church said if you can catch that you'll leave here a happy person if you can catch that you'll leave here and you'll be happy to keep doing the works of Christ Hallelujah he because he's speaking to both both groups the truth seven women and then the false seven women he's speaking to both at the same time Glory Church you can't be a lukewarm Holy Ghost filled Christian you're either lukewarm and not born again or you're baptized with the Holy Ghost and you're hot and on fire Hallelujah God help us amen God help us to catch the Revelation here hallelujah he's talking to the false vine when he says you're lukewarm and your Works you're spewed out of my mouth Jesus says and you say you have no more need of God how many say today I need more of God that proves you're not the false Vine the false Vine says I don't need it I'm going to come to church I'll come to church anyway but I'm not going to get nothing out of it I'm just going to criticize or I'm just going to pull the service down but the true seed of God want more of God they create a spiritual atmosphere where the spirit of God can move Hallelujah that's right Glory they say oh I don't need more of God I'm rich and increased with goods and yet Jesus says you're blind miserable wretched and naked so Church you're not blind miserable wretched or naked if you're in love with Christ and you're truly born again he wasn't speaking to you when he said that he was speaking to you when he said you're hot and you have taken my counsel Hallelujah there's some people today that have taken the counsel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and you've got isav on your eyes so now you can see the truth of the church ages glory to God you put on a white robe of righteousness you're living in the righteousness of Jesus Christ Hallelujah yes hallelujah it's so true and you've got the gold you've got the the the Christlike character the - tested uh battle proven character of Jesus Christ it's gold uh Faith that's been tried in the fires of Affliction and suffering hallelujah amen but the thing most today people mainly today they suffer because of their own sins but if see if you live close to God you won't suffer as much for your own sin you'll suffer for persecution or trials that people come against you right so if you're suffering for your own sins that's not what we're talking about we're talking about the Christlike character that goes through uh that becomes gold through the fiery trials that you go through because you are obedient to God's word and church if you're the bride of Christ then you have opened the door to Jesus you heard Jesus knocking and say can I come in and S with you how many you heard that knock today I hope that's why you're here today not by just a religious uh observance but you're here because you want Jesus to come in and Su with you Hallelujah and then your promise if you have all this then you will overcome and you'll sit down with Jesus in his throne hallelujah what a promise by the grace of God Amen now Isaiah back to Isaiah 4 verse two so hopefully now in verse one you can see the seven Church ages that's why if you're a Christian you better dress with right you better Feast on the word of God hallelujah watch your diet make sure you're eating the things of God enjoying the things of God nothing could taste better than the the words of God hallelujah the bread of God that's right verse two in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious speaking of Israel and the fruit of the Earth shall be exellent calmly for them that are escaped of Israel okay so what what's that day speaking of when Israel gets B gathered back and church you know their na their land natural is very fruitful Israel is a major exporter of goods uh they have some of the greatest technology in the whole world they've got the Iron Dome right they've got the Iron Dome that it it caught and destroyed almost all of those I forget how many thousands of missiles that Iran shot at them or the Hamas shot at them but it intercepted almost every single one of them and they even recognized it's a miracle right God still doing miracles for Israel but see God is going to build up Israel and it's those that escape out of Israel right it's for those that escape it's those who who don't become a part of the One World system so I believe this verse is speaking of those that escape during the Great Tribulation period they'll escape the mark of the beast they'll Escape uh all the Gathering Together of the armies against the true Israel praise God verse four I'm sorry verse three it should come to pass that he that's left in Zion and remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be Called holy even everyone that's written among the living and so I believe this is for the 144,000 Jews who survive uh and they will stand with Jesus on Mount Zion as the Book of Revelation says hallelujah they're literally going to stand on Mount Zion right that's right that's to the let's say it'd be to the west of Mount Mariah that that wonderful Mountain Mount Zion Hallelujah they're going to stand there with Jesus and they'll escape the things of this world praise God now verse four is where we been looking at here the Lord shall have washed away so see when when the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning remember friends Jesus said the blood will be upon Jews hands for his crucifixion right because they they actually said L they they said oh let his blood be upon us and our children so there's got to come a time where God washes that guilty blood off of off of Israel and it's going to happen here during the tribulation period Hallelujah God promised it how many know he promised it save your spot there go to Daniel chapter n don't forget church there's a six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel and that the one of the purposes is to wash away all their sins Gabriel comes to give Daniel understanding in Daniel chapter 9 and in verse 24 he says 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to finish the transgression so here's what it is here's what God's going to do during the tribulation he's going to finish Israel's transgressions against God think of all the times they've rejected Christ think of all the time all these years they've rejected Christ he's going to make an end of their sins God's going to bring it to an end you're no longer going to be in sin now you can serve me and to make reconciliation for iniquity right for 2,000 years they've had iniquity uh they they've gone against the the fact that Jesus is the Messiah but Jesus is going to come and he's going to do these six things so that Israel can be a place like Isaiah said it's a place where all the sin has been washed away Hallelujah that's right it's thus sayth the scripture and then uh finishing verse 24 to bring in Everlasting righteousness that's the Millennium righteousness Jesus is going to make an end to their sin they're no longer blind they no longer are guilty of anything but now they can serve God hallelujah and now he says they have everlasting righteousness God accepts Israel and to seal up the vision and prophecy and anoint the most holy Hallelujah so that's what Jesus is going to do for uh Israel during the Great Tribulation period now how many know there's been Whispers amongst our new leaders ship in Washington about rebuilding the Third Temple Church we got to keep watching that I told my wife last night I heard one of the officials one of the new officials uh for president Trump say that their aim is to rebuild that Third Temple Church if that happens I told my wife we're going to have nightly prayer meetings on Zoom Hallelujah because if that if that Temple starts getting rebuilt then we know the coming of the Lord is at hand hallelujah it's thus sayith the Lord Brother Raam says and the because the Bible says that they're going to rebuild that Temple Hallelujah so let's keep our eyes watching let's keep watching and praying Hallelujah that's right and that that's what Jesus that's what the spirit of God will do in the Great Tribulation period it'll make an end it'll bring in Everlasting righteousness and seal up the vision in the prophecy and anoint the most holy brother Raam says what that means is Jesus doesn't need anointed he said but the millennial Temple needs Anointed with Jesus being there Hallelujah and so once once Jesus of course uh reveals himself to the 144,000 they get the baptism of the Holy Ghost uh then during the Millennium we have the Battle of arm again then after that during uh the Millennium they build a new Temple and then Jesus will step inside that Temple and now these 70 weeks are finished Hallelujah and now there's Everlasting righteousness in Jerusalem Hallelujah just like it's prophesied now what's going to do it it's the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning that's a long way to get around to the topic here but I just thought I'd lay that in there it's the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning all these people are like oh don't judge me don't judge me uh the Bible's the Bible says grow in judgment even nature wrote me that verse remember a few weeks ago nature I kept that little letter she she quoted Philippians where Philippians says Paul says I pray for you that you'll grow in judgment and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ they say don't judge me I say you already judge yourself right oh I can't judge you but you can judge me the very people saying don't judge me are the ones judging and like I told uh a brother recently I said it's I'm not judging your Eternal destination I'm judging your fruits and we're supposed to judge fruits Hallelujah by their fruits they are known Hallelujah and so the Holy Spirit brings judgment it brings a discernment this is right or this is wrong that's what the spirit does it will show Israel they they're wrong in these things and then it'll bring the spirit of burning on on them now in the future home brother R reads this and then he reads Isaiah 4:4 he says and this is paragraph 387 for those if you might read the future home that's always God's judgment when he makes his final judgment he calls you now look what brother applies this to he calls you he justifies you he brings you to Redemption then his judgment breaks forth upon on you and the Holy Ghost and Fire cleanses away the sin then you're his that's what brother said about verse four let's go back there now because you were in Daniel now go back to Isaiah 4 verse4 so brother reads Isaiah 4:4 he says this is what God does to you God brings his Spirit of judgment on you to show you you're wrong so then he justifies in other words he sanctifies you and then he fills you with the Holy Ghost that's what brother Ram gets out of this verse so what does this mean the 144,000 got to go through the same three works that you're going through right now they've got to have the spirit of God come upon them judge their their their ways these are good ways these are sinful ways and then the spirit of burning has to burn out all the sin out of their lives through justification sanctification and then the spirit of burning has to take Abode it has to come and live inside the soul of the 144,000 Believers Hallelujah that's right then brother Ram reads oh yeah oh yeah now his next statement is so he says this is the three works of Grace and then he brings it down to some you know he said it's the same thing God does to the earth when he purges it with fire by the spirit of burning now listen he says are you ready so brother R now uses it see the individual have to have the spirit ual fire on them just like the Earth has to have the fire on it now go to Second Peter chapter 3 might as well hit that then you can see it now I was so blessed on Wednesday you know brother Rod came up to after words he said I learned so much today brother Jesse i' never seen some of those things before so I just want you to know God is revealing his truth to people hallelujah I hope you're getting some Revelation too but if you're not uh check your life uh let the spirit of judgment check your life Hallelujah because we're having people receiving Revelation here right amongst us hallelujah now verse four brother Ram uses this verse in the future home too and saying where is the promise of his coming these are the scoffers for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this they are willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water was in the wat everyone say water ready what's the first step water right what's the second set brother man says blood so there's the flood of Noah and then the blood of Jesus Christ was shed and the blood fell upon the Earth brother said it Sanctified the Earth Hallelujah now it doesn't mention uh Jesus's uh his his sacrifice of blood in this chapter but we know it happened verse six whereby the world then that was being overflow with water perish but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto what fire against the day of judgment and the predition of ungodly men Hallelujah so see Paul Peter lays in here water fire now in between that was the blood of Jesus Christ water Blood Fire that's represents justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother Ram uses uh Isaiah 4:4 to show that's what is going to happen to the 144,000 justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right now since we're here well let's go down to verse 10 but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night that sounds familiar right just like 1 Thessalonians 5 in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the element shall melt with fervent heat does that sound like fire to anybody Hallelujah the Earth also and the works that are in them shall be burned up there's the spirit of burning Hallelujah glory to God in other words God redeems the Earth just like he redeems your life you get baptized in water the blood of Jesus the spirit of God comes out and sanctifies cleans out your life and then he sends the fire of the Holy Ghost he sets you on fire hallelujah amen I've been touched by a fire let the world come and watch me burn Hallelujah Glory thank you Jesus now look at verse 11 seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God whereby the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the element shall melt with fervent heat so notice what does Peter say what manner of person should you be because the coming of the Lord is at hand he said that 2,000 years ago but how many remember Wednesday what do we talk about Wednesday uh the Bible said Elijah is going to turn the heart to the of the the the fathers to the children that was John the Baptist and brother random his children back to the fathers now in this verse we can see the fathers Peter Peter saying get be ready for the coming of the Lord he's telling the children be ready live a Godly life because you don't know when it's going to happen you got to be ready for him to come Hallelujah so what am I saying here's the father saying what manner of persons be holy for Jesus was holy hallelujah it's the fathers with their hearts turned to the children and the church said and then what did Brother R do during the future home brother Jose brother Ram here is at the end time he's a child and he's pointing back to Peter the fathers of the faith hallelujah oh my thank God for the grace of God hallelujah the fathers Peter pointing to brother Brandon brother BR pointing us back to Peter and Paul he said we'll be judged by that Hallelujah he said I preach what Paul preached I pre preach what pre Peter preached that way will go in just like brother Brandon will go in hallelujah hallelujah we'll go in because brother man preach what Paul and Peter preached yes all right now you got that you got that so the only time brother Ram read Isaiah 4:4 that I can find the message was the future home and he applied it to the baptism of the Holy Ghost for the Jews and then he also applied of course uh to the Future home all right now since we're here I think I'll just stay here let's now go back to uh now go to Isaiah chapter 6 friends Isaiah chapter 6 verse one see when I first read that when I first read Isaiah 4 instantly I thought of Isaiah 6 because I was in that book Isaiah 6 verse one the verse one says in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple notice when did this happen the year the king died Hallelujah brother Ram explains why this was so important brother Ram said Isaiah and we know about history too he worked right in the court with the King he he was of Royal Blood that's why he was so his writing was so precise he was trained he was educated he he lived right there he worked right there amongst the Kings but he wasn't a prophet yet God had not commissioned him yet and church remember Uzziah he was one of the most Godly Kings right until the end the Bible said there was no King like him until the end when he tried to make himself uh he tried to make himself a priest remember he took the sensor he went in there they warned him don't go in there King don't go in there he's like I can do whatever I want and he goes in there and he comes out he's got leprosy he dies not long after that but but brother R says Isaiah brother am dramatized it he said all of Isaiah's life he looked up to the king Victory after victory Victory after Victory he honored God remember he as long as he sought God remember the Bible said he prospered so that's the real that's the real Prosperity Gospel I hope somebody catches that it's not this lying false prophecy uh Prosperity that preachers Preach Today you'll Prosper spiritually if you follow Jesus not always naturally you're not promised to be rich in natural things you're promised to be rich in spiritual things because Paul said you get the unsearchable riches of Jesus Christ Hallelujah remember church he did many inventions like he did catapults up on the he had all these machines that would help him to defeat all the victors he conquered so many enemies he built up fortresses and uh and fortifications he you know throughout all the land of Israel he was one of the most successful Kings until the very end brother R said Isaiah looked up to him like a mentor like oh this man is a servant of God but brother said when when Uzziah died Isaiah was sad he lost his mentor kind of like Lena's mom right kind of reminds me of Lena's mom right now we ought to be thankful for the the examples we have in the faith how be thankful for Sister beatric by God's grace and William examples like I said they've been around the message for four decades they've seen a lot brother Jose seen a lot Hallelujah thankful for Jose's testimony he's seen a lot a lot of things come and go right a lot of things raise up and fall down and a lot of times a lot of times these things come to ask the True Believers to see who really is the True Believer right we're not surprised when God lets evil spirits come Among Us that's what happened with Saul and David God let it come in to see who's the real believer that's right Hallelujah that's right happens in micaiah's age and each one of them they got to come in remember Paul Paul said Paul warned them for three years wolves are going to come in and try to scatter the flock no why wouldn't God just why wouldn't God just protect his lambs and keep out all the Wolves because God wants to see who's on his side there's always a thinning down time amen look at look at look at the church it's thinning down all the time it's always thinning down who's the real believer who's the true one the Believers that really love the word really love the Holy Ghost really love the scripture God's it's a Proving Grounds it's a testing grounds Hallelujah Jesus wants to see you overcome with the word of God hallelujah that's right now also notice this the death of someone is also the beginning of someone else's Ministry God told Joshua Moses my servant is dead now I'm with you as I was with Moses so I'll be with you right now the simple examples like in our church you know uh once our other song leader left God raised up Malachi has he been faithful on the piano Hallelujah right and when people leave out what does God do raise up somebody else that's God's way hallah that's right if you really love God there'll be somebody there that'll raise up and God will raise them up and use them for his purpose for the rest of the time that's right just like in the natural God raised up Kings he raised up Joe Biden he pulled him down right God can do whatever he wants he's raised up Trump but we'll see what happens it's all it's all in God's timing but you want to be raised up for Jesus's sake Hallelujah to be an example of Christianity an example of righteousness not to be used of the Lord uh uh as one of his vessels of Dishonor you want to be raised up as a vessel of Honor unto Christ that's right what a blessing so uh Uzziah was Isaiah's Mentor Isaiah was leaning on Uzziah brother Ram said he was a Godly Man for the most of his life but when Uzziah died God comes to Isaiah and gives him his own experience right God provided it Uzziah reigned for 52 years 2 Chronicles 26:3 says and did you know Isaiah married a prophet as well a propheus did you know that that have been some real good uh conversations at the dinner table wouldn't have it honey what' you see of the lord well let me tell you hubby I wrote it down that that's in Isaiah 8:3 Isaiah was married to a propheus and Isa was a prophet himself talk about some spiritual algebra there sister nature talk about that oh my oh honey I had this Vision right it was a a virgin shall conceive oh that's wonderful honey what did you see today here's what I saw amazing and Isaiah then once he became a prophet as we'll see in this chapter he served under Uzziah not as a prophet but afterwards and then the king Jo jotham ahaz and Hezekiah and he prophesied for about 40 or 50 years his messages were warnings against idolater social injustice political alliances with foreign Nations he also prophesied about the Babylonian exile the coming of the Messiah and the restoration of Israel Amen brother R said Isaiah wrote a whole Mini Bible because he wrote 66 chapters and there's 66 books in the book of Isaiah hallelujah oh my what a servant of God hallelujah he has some of the most famous Messiah prophecies about a virgin shall conceive and his name will be wonderful counselor Mighty God the Prince of Peace the Everlasting father hallelujah oh my glory to God verse two and Isaiah 6 ver2 but actually you know what let me read one again in that year he saw so he saw a vision we don't know if this is his first Vision but this is one of the most important Visions he ever had he saw the Throne of Christ and of course this is before Christ came but he would have saw the theophany high and lifted up and his train filled the temple now you in the old days the train uh it was this long robe and it it meant how many battles the king had won so Isaiah looks up and sees God has won every battle he's undefeated hallelujah praise God he wins every time don't fight against him fight for him Hallelujah Point your family to Jesus right don't don't let your family and friends keep serving the the devil try to reach out to them try to get them to see Jesus wins every battle Jesus never fails he's king of kings and Lord of lords Hallelujah his train filled the entire Temple this Mighty God imagine it just flowing uh like like the like the ocean's Tides you know just just flowing with the glory and the victory Of God Almighty and above it stood the seraphim now seraphim are different kinds of angels remember there's at least three kind of angels there's cherubim seraphim and Archangels right and then even Lucifer was a covering Angel which I believe was a cherub yeah the Bible calls him a cherub but the seraphim were specific angels that dealt with the Heavenly altar of God right remember the cherabin they just surround it saying holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty holy holy that's the cherubims but the seraphim they would go and Minister uh in the Heavenly Tabernacle Hallelujah and so Isaiah sees seraphim he doesn't see the cherubims he sees the seraphim dealing with the altar of God each one had six wings which Twain he did cover his face now getting back to six six is not a bad number Church six can be a good number the only six that's bad is 666 that's the only bad six six is a good number it had six wings and the church said you there's six pieces of armor on the armor of God hallelujah I got a whole preach a whole sermon on that and whole series I think my brother Jose was there my that was a wonderful series back in 2015 I got about 30 sermons on that Bible numerology boy it's been a long time had brother might have to revisit that but six is a good number six wings with Twain he covered his face so the sah had wings over their faces with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly now brother R brings out a simple teaching here brother said let's think he says with two Wings he had over his face in the presence of God which represents humility and the church said what what happened when they come around Jesus or Angels what they do they fall in their face right humbling themselves now the word humility in the New Testament it means a deep sense of your littleness you're so little your mind is so little most time it's like oh you're so great you so know you know so much you're so smart humility is like you really don't know that much you memorize a few multiplication division facts good for you now do something with it go work a job go go do something that's not very impressive but you know I I I cheer on my first graders yeah great job but I'm like I know that's just the beginning I'm glad they can understand that that in first grade but remember humility is littleness remember how little you are you can do nothing apart from Jesus we can do nothing let's all say that let's say I can do nothing ready I can do nothing smart as we think we might be as smart and intelligent we can do nothing without Jesus Christ and brother said that's what those two wings represent of these Sims that they're so humble In God's Presence they have to hide their face in the presence of God he said and second they had two Wings over their feet what was it he said reverence well I'm sorry I got these mixed up sorry yeah sorry he either he changed them or I got him mixed up so forgive me he said the two that covered I'm sorry yeah the two that cover his face yeah it changes here was reverence so this represents reverence so let me read reverence reverence in the Old Testament means Godly fear so the fear of the Lord so I'm sorry I got that mixed up Wings on the face is reverence right we're so reverent which is I fear the lord remember what's fear of God it's honor and adoration for God okay so the two over the face is reverence I reverence God he's so great I fear the lord I can hardly look at him he's so great and I honor him I respect him I give him the all the reverence okay and then the fee is humility because remember what did God say to Moses take your shoes off you're standing on Holy Ground Hal Hallelujah right humility there now we're getting to humility so sorry I got that mixed up there see preachers make mistakes all the time they just got to Humble themselves and say they made a mistake forgive me Lord so you need you need the fear of the Lord now brother applies this to us we can learn something from these seraphim the fear of the Lord and then he says humility how many knows what he said the wings in act I'm sorry the wings were being in action in other words not being being lazy for God doing something for God and church you came to church today you're in action if you raise your hands today if you clapped today if you said amen today if you prayed today you're in action that's right brother ra said that's right he said the two Wings he said what was he doing he was in action the two w wings represent action what was he doing he was showing the prophet that by this how the Prophet his prepared servant must be hallelujah oh that's beautiful God's prepared servant must be reverent humble and in action Hallelujah well now I'm thinking about me as a preacher and you can think about you as your your calling for God God didn't show him the cherubims brother Claude he didn't show him those beautiful cherubims that are up I'll say the covering chair was that guard the throne he didn't show them the throne guards because Isaiah wasn't going to be the throne guard God showed him the seraphim that were flying that covered their faces and covered their feet that the servant of God must be reverent humble he must stay in action that's what God will show you if you're going to be a servant you got to be humble reverent and you got to stay active for Jesus hallelujah hallelujah that's why I told you if You' got a a song gift like Malachi you better use it if you sing specials you better I mean there there's no specific time when you need to sing them but just be be available so God can sing through you if you're a preacher preach when the doors open because the gift will make room for itself my gift just happens to make room for itself three times a week Hallelujah that's right as much as times as I feel led to call service right just be in action be ready to go like brother Simon know not even before he's preaching he was in action doing Bible studies he was in action passing out tracks did you know Simon went door Todo in almost three cities or or towns he went door Todo and passed out tracks door too and some people criticize him but you know what at least he was in action he cared so much about those people he went door too like I told you remember Chris I told you I sent those letters and church age books to my family I'm just being in action right brother R even talked about that brother Ram said it's like being in a war and you got this big cannon this cannon machine right he said he said sometimes a guy would try to pull it and make it fire it wouldn't go off brother said don't quit firing he said just keep pulling it pretty soon something's going to go off Hallelujah glory to God if your gun jams up you throw your gun away and never use no you keep you clean it out fix it and then keep trying and pretty soon you're going to get some am ammunition to work in there Hallelujah stay in action let's stay busy for the Lord hallelujah what can you do for the lord well I'll tell you Church the best thing you can do is pray because that's the hardest thing Satan don't want you to do is pray Hallelujah well brother just I'm not a preacher or brother just we have a lot of sisters in the church I can pray till the walls fall down and the church said you sisters can sing specials right there's lots of things you can do you can before service you can come up here and pray for the service or you can pray after the service you can put prayer requests in every week there's things you can do Hallelujah you can read your Bible Hallelujah you can testify you can make sure you talk to people after service and encourage them see how they're doing see if they have any needs in our life and little sisters you can come tell me if they need something I'm the treasurer I got access to the church funds I can help them out financially with whatever we got by the grace of God you can clean you can take out the trash right you could clean the bathrooms that's a blessing because the greatest among you will be the servants that's the greatest there's many things you can do you can shovel you can meat me to church and shovel the snow off the wooden walkway Hallelujah there's ways to serve if we just get that eyv on our eyes and say oh let let me take a good look around here uh did you know there's such a thing as dust that builds up and you can dust off all the instruments if you wanted to now I'm not begging for workers I'm I'm just giving you examples if you want to be in service God will put you into service Hallelujah glory to God just got to open your heart open your mind to the Lord and the church said oh that's right you can look at all those books out there on the Shelf you can mail them to friends I'll I'll pay for the I'll pay for the postage you can mail them to your friends or if you want to do something I'm saying that cuz we got so many sisters in here that are not preachers and even Brothers if you're not preachers there's so much to be done we just got to do something for God we just got to be in service Hallelujah in action find an action to do brother Jesse on top of my regular job yes I work a job too Hallelujah if I can do it you can do it praise God that's right all right enough enough on that how many enjoyed that by God's grace those seraphim reverent humble and in action that's why the Bible said give them double honor because they're reverent humble they stay in action brother Chris right Mary and Joseph were visited by Gabriel now with with Abra it was God himself right the one time and then there was two angels with him we don't we're not told the names of them right but so those would be a different kind of angels right because we got those three kinds there could be more kinds too because the Bible says then in Hebrews 1 angels are sent forth as ministering spirits to them that would believe so there could be like uh angels that are just Messengers to the elect let's read that that's Hebrews chapter 1 right Hebrews chapter 1 Neon if I'm wrong I'm sure AAA will correct me back there right AA they're ministering Spirits sent forth to those that would be Heirs of Salvation now it's coming yeah they're just Glory it's Hebrews 1:14 brother Chris great question so it looks like there we have three types of angels just by name but it looks like there's another set of angels that are ministering Spirits sent out to the humans okay here it is that's how I'll read this on three ready 1 2 three are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be Heirs of Salvation brother Bram says each person has a guardian angel so maybe that's I don't know if that word Guardian is in the King James but we all have a ministering Spirit an angel to be with us brother said it watches you over you all your life right so we all have ministering or guarding angels we would say by God's grace yes yes let's say praise the Lord can we praise the Lord me too brother been many times I've been close to death God has been gracious to me very good question brother verse uh now let's go back to Isaiah 63 well I sure thought I was going to get through a lot today I can tell I'm not going to hardly get anything done today but all glory to God Isaiah 63 and one Cried unto another now look these three seraphim are flying around I'm sorry the seraphim are flying around and they cried to another saying holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory so now we're talking the seraphim also shout holy holy they join the cherubims shouting holy holy holy and they CED to another that's what we should cry right brother Claud we should say holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty right brother Mercy holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty Mali holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty we should say that to one another praise God I'll say it like this Our Lives should declare it Hallelujah we shouldn't have to say holy but we should have the Holiness of God on us that's what I heard brother McBride was was preaching at cams last week and I listened to his sermon and he said brother McBride said even at work brother McBride said a man will be around him and and they just be around each other he said he said are you a Christian right and brother McBride McBride's like what do you mean because he don't want to tell him right away he said I can tell you're a Christian just by the way you dress brother Bri's like I didn't wear a tie to work right but see they and he said every time I come around you there's a presence around you Church said I remember when I got hired at copi the very first meeting I went to uh her name was Kathy Clark Kathy CL Clark told me after the service she said it was like you were glowing she said she said we all knew you were a Christian as soon as you walked in the door I said thank God for the glow of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah see it just it uh they cried out so we should have we should carry the Holiness of Jesus with us that's right remember I had two women tell me that they knew I was going to be a pre someday an old high school girl and then uh the pastor's wife up there in Sheffield said as soon as the first time I saw you she said I knew you'd be a preacher I was like I wish somebody would told me too I wish somebody would have told me beforehand but I I you know I had my experiences so I I know I know God called me verse four so the angels are crying holy holy the whole earth is full of his glory verse four and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke look how great God is God is so great when he speaks Even Heaven shakes because Solomon said not even the heaven of Heavens can contain the glory of the Lord imagine that brother Chris you're in your house and you just say somebody help me get me some water and the whole walls Shake that's what it was like being in heaven every time God speaks everything shakes well no wonder they're saying holy no wonder they're covering their faces because God is Holy Hallelujah he's separate he's perfect he's all powerful he's Eternal and his whole house shakes when he talks yet the Bible tells us to be meek and humble I don't yell too much in my home I can't remember if I ever yelled in my house but I hope I hope the humility of Christ shakes my children by the grace of God but when God speaks in heaven the door of the post the gates everything shakes in heaven because God is so great remember Hebrews 12 says not only will God Shake Heaven he'll also shake all of Earth he's going to shake it again his voice is going to speak again of course shake it during the Great Tribulation period verse five then said I now we're finally getting down to the close here I got six minutes on my hour verse five then said I woe is me for I am undone so let's just take a moment back first he sees the throne then he sees this train this Victorious God then he sees the the Angels crying and then he hears God speak everything shakes and how does this make him feel woe is me I am a dirty wretched person huh God you know people say people they say oh God loves you so much God's got a great plan for your life that's the first thing they learn about God here's the first thing the Bible teaches about when you know about God you're a wretched sinner hallelujah amen like I've heard preachers say oh you know they witness the now of course they're internet preachers they witness to people and say oh God loves you so much you are God's Masterpiece and God loves you and you're so beautiful God has a great plan for your life you're a beautiful person that was different than how Isaiah met God and look what they turn out to be they get to be a lot of them turn out to be deceived church members the false Vine hallelujah how does God introduce Isaiah God introduces all these things to Isaiah the seraphim theol of God the place shaken and Isaiah says Woe Is Me In other words I'm under judgment ah the spirit of judgment's here hallelujah Glory the Holy Ghost will the Holy Ghost will make you feel judged I'm guilty and church we're all guilty Hallelujah we all deserve hell we all deserve woes we all deserve uh punishments chastisements we all deserve hell and we should all say this that we deserve it we should know we deserve the judgments of God and he says I'm undone in other words my life isn't complete there's nothing good about me my life is in pieces before Christ Our Life was in shambles I hoping somebody would say Amen on that Hallelujah if your life was good before well then you must have been in a certain type of a Temptation like the Rich Young Ruler or something like that then you need a lot of help praise God need a lot of help because you think you got everything figured out got all the money got all the answers you don't have any answers without the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah he said wo I'm under judgment wo is me I'm undone my life is all out of order I don't even know what to do my life is confusion my life is chaos Hallelujah because why because I'm a dirty mouth person and the church said I say evil things a prophet of God wasn't he born a prophet didn't God for know him as a prophet like Jeremiah yes so even prophets before their commission even prophets have to say I'm under the Judgment of God the Holy Spirit Will judge them and say I'm not worthy for this calling I speak evil things I have evil in my heart I deserve the punishment of God hallelujah so any spiritual experience if it makes you proud it probably wasn't from God but if you have a spiritual experience where you can put the state down like we talked about then it'll make you humble Hallelujah like those angels in the presence of God hallelujah you won't think oh I'm somebody great oh God's going to use me in the message or God's going to use me in akine you won't think that you'll think oh I'm nothing how could God ever used me I'm so filthy I'm so dirty but thank God there's Amazing Grace Hallelujah remember this is the man who wrote 66 chapters wrote his own Mini Bible and what did he think about himself I'm so smart no I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell amongst unclean people that was his assessment well what is my life really what is my life really like compared to heaven I'm dirty I'm filthy and so is everyone around me Hallelujah you know sometimes we want to meet Angels sometimes we want to have a dream of Jesus sometimes you want a supernatural thing but if you do look what's going to happen you're going to see how little you are and how great and holy Jesus is hallelujah praise God so I'm I'm dirty mouth and I live amongst dirty mouth people for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of the Heavenly Host amen so he saw all the hosts of Heaven all the innumerable Angels but he also saw the Lord he was Lord of hosts Hallelujah and this exper experence didn't make him think he's great it made him think he's dirty so can everybody see the spirit of judgment here so what's next after judgment what's next burning Hallelujah first you got to be judged that's why when I don't see people come up for prayer I don't see people pray for a while I wonder about them they're probably getting too full of themselves like they're such a great person in other words self-righteousness Pride the Holy Ghost doesn't make you prideful the Holy Ghost makes you humble it will judge you oh you shouldn't have done that this week you shouldn't have said that that was wrong Hallelujah that'll make you repent repent about it is that right so the spirit of judgment would come now and thinking about it now Church we've seen so many people fall out of the message and I'm not even talking about people in our church I'm not talking about people in our church but I've seen so many people were around this message and uh I think I shared a couple with you in private but the one brother remember he preached the message he got down at the altar next to Simon he prayed for five minutes got up and said I got the Holy Ghost he did not have a tear in his eye he did not say anything about I'm a man of unclean lips or any experience with God he just said I got the Holy Ghost and he's already fallen away from the message now he goes to the Baptist Church no no experience with God he wasn't thinking about how dirty he was he think about how great he's going to be used yes right and there's another brother that left the message and now he's being divorced or he's he divorced his his wife so sad a preacher that used to preach here sometimes and we always wondered you know does he have an experience with God and we and I've never seen him praising God weeping or repenting or anything like that I've never seen that none of his sermons produce that in anyone's life and one of the brothers that used to come here said I've always noticed about that brother I don't believe that brother has the baptism of the Holy Ghost what am I saying the Holy Ghost will bring a spirit of judgment on your life it'll make you realize you're Unholy and then the spirit of burning will come to burn out all the sin out of your life hallelujah it's going to burn out all the pride burn out all the arrogance burn out all of you that thinks you're so great or something you and I are nothing we got dirty lips we say dirty things we're amongst a bunch of dirty people but Christ can make us holy Hallelujah amen yes the presence of God will always make you humble like job job said I've heard about God he said but now I see God and I Repent in dust and Ashes the Holy Ghost makes you humble not brag about how great you are it makes you humble yourself that's one of the uh it's one of the attributes right reverent humble cover your feet reverent covers your face humble your feet and you're always in action always serving God's always doing something for Jesus Hallelujah verse six then flew one of the seraphim now notice when does The Burning come it comes after you admit you're a dirty sinner so the spirit of judgment comes to show you to judge that you're Unholy and you got to confess with the Bible said confess with your mouth that you're a sinner and call upon the name of the Lord Jesus and then you'll be saved that's why on Wednesday when we had that nice prayer with with with Genevie and she got saved on Wednesday let's give a round of applause right she got got saved on Wednesday remember what we prayed hun I said remember I said I'm a dirty or I've sinned I'm a sinner I don't deserve to go to heaven remember how we prayed that we're both in tears both worshiping the Lord Lord I didn't even see it at the end she just jumped right up in my arms just held on to me crying and thanking God that she's saved I said this is a beautiful picture this is what this is like heaven to me Hallelujah then so after the spirit of judgment comes you judge yourself dirty mouthed and after that then the angel comes and has a live coal in his hand which he taken off the tongs from off the altar of God hallelujah so there is a Brazen altar in heaven just like there was in the in the Tabernacle of Moses there's a Brazen altar there with a spiritual fire Hallelujah Church th that fire is more real than the fire down here if you understand what I'm saying that's that can be Eternal fire this is all this all passed away but an angel a saram takes tongs even the angels can't touch those coals brother sister that's how hot they are angels can't even touch them yes the spirit of burning and the angel comes down takes the tongue and flies right down to the prophet of God he says open up open up that mouth that you've been saying dirty filthy things in hallelujah look at verse seven and he laid it in my mouth so see your mouth used to be a tool for the the the devil it used to be a spew of evil but now as sarap from can come down he can lay that right there in your mouth but you got to open up Hallelujah you got to want to say different things Hallelujah you got to want to praise God and not sit quiet during church you got to want to say Amen to the word of God and not like him you got to want to testify or tell somebody about Jesus see he knows I speak unclean things all these people are dirty mouth people around me but Lord here I am I open my mouth Let the Fire of God let the presence of God come down into my mouth so I can finally say something of value to somebody Hallelujah I'm unclean man I speak unclean things but God you can help me to say something that will glorify your Holy Name Hallelujah I'm just preaching today and the church said I do a lot of teaching but I'm just preaching to you today telling you what the word of God says hallelujah he laid it on my mouth and said Lo this has touched your lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged see once the coal of the Holy Ghost touches your lips and it touches you once the spirit of God impacts you you've been affected by it and remember what is fire fire is a cleansing agent Hallelujah so God's God's fire touches your mouth now your mouth is clean now God can use your mouth for his glory look what these all these uh if you look and study in the Bible a live coal represents you're purified from sin Hallelujah your sin is burned away your iniquities and that's the thing you knew you shouldn't have done yet you still did them the fire of God can forgive even the things you knew you shouldn't have done hallelujah this this live call also represents atonement and forgiveness right the iniquity is removed uh the the sin is removed and now you're at one with God it also represents you're forgiven of all those dirty things you said Hallelujah when the when you've been touched by a fire from heaven you know that's what this you know what our church needs more than anything else it needs people to have a coal of fire touch their lips I just mean their whole life but you understand what I'm saying people in our church they need experience from Heaven I can't send it but God can Hallelujah if I my choice I'd say everybody open up your mouths you're getting a live cold today now we're all going to speak the right thing that's my choice but God's got look just like with Isaiah God's got a time and season for everything God's got a time when he's going to put you into service hallelujah amen hallelujah I'm sure hoping some of these brothers will be a preacher someday so I can get some extra help around here by God's grace but even if not I'll still keep preaching Hallelujah all these Services maybe God will raise one of them up just look for the coal to come hallelujah look for a coal to touch your mouth then you'll be reverent then you'll be humble and then you'll stay in action I won't have to ask you did you study this week did you pray this week did you listen to brother Bram this week if you got the coal I don't have to ask you to do those things because you're going to stay in action yeah we're going to make we're going to make mistakes we're going to fall short but God's going to get us right back on the right track Hallelujah he's going to make all things new like we like to sing about he's going to renew our minds day by day the Bible says he's going to keep you in action you know there was always this this wonderful brother but uh there in Lima there's always this wonderful brother I love him dearly but he just he you know he just couldn't keep the victory very long he said he was called to preach and said he was call called to song Lead and all these wonderful things but even to this day still struggles in and out of service sometimes able to preach some not saying I'm taking a break and all these things like that take uh years and months off from preaching friends what what I believe each person needs is a live coal experience that puts them into service and then if they get a coal from Heaven they'll have no more questions if they're called to speak for God hallelujah there'll be no more questions because I've been touched by a fire I've been touched from Heaven Hallelujah nobody's got to tell me about it I was there when it happened it happened to me Hallelujah that's what our church needs that's what every church needs some people would be touched by heaven so they can say the right thing and they can be put into Ministry but before that they first got to realize I'm unclean I'm dirty I say filthy things I just need Jesus to touch me so see a call of Fire represents it's preparing you for Ministry it's a symbol of God's power it's fire from the altar see Isaiah couldn't be a prophet without this live coal touching his mouth and I couldn't be a preacher either without the live coal touching my mouth as well I'm not going to tell you but I had a filthy mouth I said a lot of filthy things but the coal of fire touched my mouth I don't say filthy things anymore you're a witness I preached here 18 years by God's grace Hallelujah I've had that experience Hallelujah so see church we need an experience where God has touched our mouth and now we don't say unclean things we say clean things that's right so the spirit of judgment comes to convict you of your sins you confess that you're unclean and then the spirit of burning comes and it burns away all your iniquity Burns away all your sin you're forgiven and then it cleans your mouth so you can can talk for God yes verse seven says your iniquity is taken away your sin is purged now love verse eight also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send who will go for us all the Heavenly hosts I love that God talks and the whole the whole Kingdom shakes in heaven and then his next his next thought is who's going to go for heaven who wants to who wants to represent Heaven Hallelujah who on Earth wants to talk for heaven hallelujah what does Isaiah say he said I here am I send me but first he had to admit I'm a dirty filthy mouth preacher I need the cleansing power of God and then when God's fire touches you now now you feel ready now you know now I can go preach for Jesus because he's touched my mouth then you're willing that's why the Bible said a pastors got to be willing remember we read that 1 Timothy 3 you got to be willing you you desire a good thing Isaiah desired a good Ministry to be a prophet of God and once his mouth was burned with fire then he said now I'll go for Jesus that's when I said brother Chris now I can be the pastor and a because God has touching my mouth the the fire of God has anointed me see you can accept and desire God's call for your life after repenting under the spirit of judgment and then experiencing the spirit of burning that burns away your iniquity your dirty mouth then you can be used by God to speak for God the cleansing fire of God on your mouth your heart and your life it's unbelievable that's over an hour my goodness Isaiah 69 let's see what kind of a Ministry let's see if Isaiah's going to have a lot of yes men in the church and he said go and tell this people hear ye indeed but understand not and see you indeed and perceive not so this is going to be Isaiah's uh congregation he's going to say you see but you're blind you hear but you're not really hearing this is the kind of people he was GNA have to preach to I'm glad I got a church that says amen sometimes Hallelujah right I'm glad people say amen every service verse 10 make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes see about people sleeping in church you know it it's different if you work all night but if it's it's different too uh you shouldn't be staying up late at night doing things of the world either look at this lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and convert and be healed so he said you're he said basically you got a church that's dis disobedient The More You Preach the more they're going to get tired on you cold on you wow what a Ministry what a Ministry for a prophet of God verse 11 wait was his ministry going to get greater and greater like all these preachers oh well brother Jess your church is so small how could you be a real preacher well did did all these guys get big churches and were they treated really good all the time no they didn't grow all the time that's right verse 11 I just the Conant criticism you get then I said how long Lord and he answered until the cities be wasted without inhabitants so in other words he was going to prophesy to these people until they were scattered and none of them were left except the poor right the poor to take over The Vineyards and so forth and the houses without man the land be utterly desolate and the Lord have removed men far away and there be great forsaking in the midst of the land verse 13 but yet in it shall be a tenth and it shall return a Remnant and shall be eaten as a as a teal of tree and as an oak whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves so shall the holy seed shall be the substance thereof Hallelujah now let me close with this here by God's grace I'm just going to close I'm L Lord willing I'll probably preach a part two then remember what the Bible says what does the Bible say Deuteronomy 4:24 for the Lord your God God is a consuming fire a jealous God see God didn't want Isaiah talking all these these dirty things with all these dirty people he's jealous God want to use Isaiah's mouth for his sake right and all the rest of the people they're just going to get more cold on God more hard-hearted say more evil things but God needed somebody to talk for him God was jealous over their words Deuteronomy 9:3 understand therefore this day that the Lord thy God is he which goeth over before the as a consuming fire he shall destroy them and he shall bring them down before thy face so shall thou drive them out and Destroy them quickly as the Lord has said unto thee what is God like he's like a consuming fire Hebrews 12:29 for our God is a consuming fire what's the word consuming mean in the Hebrew it means to eat to devour to burn up or to feed so what does God say God said I'm a eating fire I'm a devouring fire in other words I'm not going to stay in one spot I'm going to keep devouring I'm GNA eat up your entire life amen I'm G to burn up I'm going to consume all your thoughts and the church said I'm gonna consume all your words Hallelujah glory to God I'm gonna consume all your actions all I just want more and more I want more of your life I want more of your dedication I want more of your worship our God is a consuming fire Hallelujah let's stand to our feet musicians can come now I've shared some of these testimonies before but I was an awful awful sinner but I know this as soon as I was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I started memorizing acts 238 and from that moment I've never said another cuss word I used to say all kinds of wicked things before I preached my first sermon at brother Brooks's I've told this before but I'm going tell it again I was wondering I kind of felt led to preach right before I went and preached there I fasted two days before leading up there and say God and my only prayer of those two days was God just show me if I'm called to preach or not let there be some sign now God's my witness before I went out to preach there if you I don't know if you've seen brother Brooks's office most of you haven't there's the office and then there's the there's a bathroom and then there's the spot behind the baptismal area so it's like the for us to be like yeah there's the pastor's room there's a bathroom for the pastor and then behind them is the water baptism you know if you sit in the pastor's office people are going to come in and knock and and want to talk all day which is okay but I was going to preach my first sermon in front of all these well not it's actually my second sermon in front of these hundred people and I fasted that week and said God am I supposed to preach or not so you know what I did I got I didn't go in there I didn't go in the office I went further in and I hid Myself Away behind the altar I'm sorry behind the water baptism I just prayed there and church God's my witness during the whole song service I laid there on my face almost the whole time and I said God show me I was shaking I was so nervous I was so shaking I said God don't let me say one thing don't let me say one thing that's wrong and I felt such an anointing come on me I was shaking and also when I stepped out there be after I finished uh that song uh I shall forever LIF lift my eyes to Calvary play that one that's the song as soon as we said praise God sister Karen Sanders right from her seat gave out a a a word of the Lord she gave a word of knowledge about exactly what I was going to preach on and so after that All the nervousness left me I preached and the whole almost the whole altar was filled with people repenting and that was my sign that God had cleansed my my lips and called me to preach I never doubt it again if I was called to preach or not Hallelujah because the fire of God had come down to cleans me when I started memorizing the Bible I've been baptized and then God's spirit met me back there and God's spirit gave me so many witnesses God had cleansed my lips cleansed my mouth and now nobody can take it away from me because God let me experience it hallelujah amen an angel brought aive call cleaned out my lips and let me speak for Jesus Christ Hallelujah and now I get to speak for heaven like Isaiah did of course I'm very small in comparison but God still needs preachers today that will preach for heaven that their mouth has been cleaned out by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's my testimony praise God and I was there when it happened I ought to know praise God I do know but the spirit of burning is here that's what people need they need such a experience with the Holy Ghost well they know they're forgiven and they know they're going to say the right thing instead of unclean things praise God and it won't be I go down there and youel up okay I got the Holy Ghost no you will feel ashamed of yourself you'll weep but say you'll boohoo you'll cry you'll have a real experience a Heavenly coal is going to touch your mouth that's not something light that's something heavy Hallelujah that's something you won't forget hallelujah how to remember all those things that happened in 2004 how do to remember that 21 years later because it was Supernatural because I haven't been the same since it happened to me Hallelujah let's bow our heads for a moment here Church you know if you're a man or woman of unclean lips saying the wrong thing you know because the spirit of judgment is here hallelujah amen the spirit of judgment will convict us and say I've said evil things and I'm amongst evil people so what's your response to that Lord you're right I am unclean woe is me I do speak evil things that's the right answer Hallelujah the spirit of judgment that's what Jesus said the Holy Ghost will convict us of sin Jesus Christ said that Hallelujah and if God can get somebody to say that I'm an unclean person I say unclean dirty things if God can get a person to say that God will send next the spirit of burning Hallelujah to burn up all that sin out of someone's heart and forgive them but the person really has to meet it how many know Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it's true see I don't know where everybody's at in their walk with God I don't know I don't live with you only you live with you and God I said last week put this on my heart I've been studying waiting on it for a couple weeks to preach but I'm sure if it's in the word of God I'm sure our church wants to believe it I'm sure our church appreciates the word of God hallelujah let's bow our heads for a moment
