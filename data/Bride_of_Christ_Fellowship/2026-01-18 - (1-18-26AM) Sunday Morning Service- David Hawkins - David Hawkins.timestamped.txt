[0:00] we'll be talking about this morning by
[0:01] God's grace if that's if he should lead
[0:03] that way. Um he could you never know he
[0:05] could he could always lead another
[0:06] direction but
[0:07] &gt;&gt; but praise the Lord. So this morning um
[0:11] if we'll we'll get ready to go into the
[0:13] scripture here. Um we'll be in 1 Timothy
[0:15] chapter 6.
[0:18] And this morning um this something that
[0:21] just kind of been on my heart. I I was
[0:23] trying to study a few different things
[0:25] but this is really what I felt like I
[0:27] couldn't get away from it here. So, I
[0:29] really I feel like these are the things
[0:31] the Lord put on my heart today. So, um I
[0:34] I trust it's it'll be edifying and that
[0:37] the Lord will be glorified uh through us
[0:40] this morning. Amen. And uh the Lord
[0:43] helping us. We'll be preaching on uh the
[0:45] real prosperity gospel. Amen. Don't
[0:47] don't don't start sweating on me,
[0:48] Brother Jesse. It's not the prosperity
[0:50] gospel, but the real prosperity gospel,
[0:52] sir. There's a there's a fake one out
[0:53] there. Amen.
[0:54] &gt;&gt; But there's a real, too. Amen. And uh
[0:56] before we read the scripture from uh
[0:58] first Timothy, let's bow our heads and
[1:00] ask the Lord to bless the word here.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, how we appreciate
[1:04] you and we thank you for bringing us all
[1:06] here, gathering uh under the name of the
[1:09] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10] &gt;&gt; uh to worship you, Lord, to hear from
[1:12] you, to hear your words, Lord, the
[1:14] wonderful words of life. Lord, we how we
[1:16] appreciate when you teach us, Lord, when
[1:18] you help us. You know what is needful,
[1:21] Lord, for our lives. We just pray that
[1:22] you'd uh uh sort this out to us and and
[1:26] give us ears to hear, Lord. Anoint the
[1:28] word that goes forth. I pray you'd help
[1:29] me to to be out of your way, Lord, and
[1:32] uh use me as a a tool in your hand,
[1:34] Lord. Just to bless your people, and uh
[1:37] anoint the people, Lord. Anoint our ears
[1:38] to hear and our hearts to receive,
[1:41] Father. And may we be helped and
[1:42] strengthened, encouraged, Lord, uh to
[1:45] help us stand in this evil day, Lord. We
[1:47] ask it for your glory. That you'd have
[1:49] your way and that uh you'd use all the
[1:51] gifts according to your will, however
[1:53] you would desire to do that, Lord. And
[1:55] uh that your anointing would be upon us,
[1:57] Father. All the working of your spirit
[1:59] in your house, Father, through your
[2:00] body. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:02] Amen.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:06] Hallelujah. uh 1 Timothy
[2:09] chapter 6 and uh we'll read verses uh 3
[2:13] to 12 and then uh 17 to 19.
[2:18] Praise the Lord.
[2:19] &gt;&gt; 1 Timothy chapter 6.
[2:22] Praise God.
[2:25] It's wonderful to be here. Amen.
[2:27] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord for for bringing us here
[2:28] safe this morning.
[2:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's been a lot of lot of
[2:32] nasty accidents on the road with the
[2:34] weather and things recently and we just
[2:36] we pray for them and we thank the Lord
[2:39] for bringing us here safely this
[2:40] morning.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh starting at verse three of 1
[2:46] Timothy chapter 6 here. If any man teach
[2:49] otherwise
[2:51] uh and consent not to wholesome words,
[2:54] even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:56] and to the doctrine which is according
[2:58] to godliness, he is proud, knowing
[3:01] nothing, but doting about questions and
[3:03] strifees of words, whereof cometh envy,
[3:06] strife, railings, evil surmisings. Amen.
[3:10] Is my is my microphone on? Can you hear
[3:12] me? Okay. Praise the Lord. Thank you.
[3:13] Thank you. Praise the Lord. Amen. Uh
[3:16] verse five, perverse disputings of men,
[3:19] of corrupt minds, and destitute of the
[3:22] truth, supposing that God that gain is
[3:25] godliness. Amen. From such withdraw
[3:28] thyself. Amen. We know that's that's the
[3:30] the prosperity gospel that big megaurch
[3:34] pastors and uh and uh different people
[3:37] preach um that that gain is godliness.
[3:40] That's exactly what they preach. And
[3:42] then they they somehow they read this in
[3:44] the scripture and still continue to
[3:45] preach it. Amen. Because they love the
[3:47] money that they're receiving. Amen.
[3:50] &gt;&gt; So he says, "From such withdraw
[3:52] thyself." That's not the real gospel. Um
[3:54] you're not save you don't know you're
[3:56] saved because of how much money you get.
[3:58] Right? Amen. It's it's as simple as
[4:01] that. But what does he say here in verse
[4:03] six? But godliness with contentment is
[4:06] great gain. Amen. That's the gain. to be
[4:09] partakers of the divine nature through
[4:10] godliness. Amen.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You can have your seats.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; So, we know that the real gain is is
[4:21] godliness, partaking in in in godliness
[4:24] and and righteousness and true holiness.
[4:26] Amen. And uh it's gain isn't godliness.
[4:30] Godliness is gain. Amen. We we see Paul
[4:32] sort that out here. And uh and then
[4:35] continuing on in verse 7, he says uh for
[4:39] we brought nothing into this world, and
[4:41] it is certain we can carry nothing out.
[4:45] &gt;&gt; And having food and raignment, let us
[4:47] therewith be therewith content.
[4:50] &gt;&gt; But they that will be rich fall into
[4:52] temptation and a snare. Now, it doesn't
[4:54] mean it's wrong to have money. Amen. But
[4:56] what he's saying is they that will be
[4:57] rich, they fall into temptation and a
[5:00] snare and into many foolish and hurtful
[5:03] lusts which drown men in destruction and
[5:06] predition. Uh money to the flesh, money
[5:09] enables you to fulfill more lust of the
[5:12] flesh. Amen. Because in in this world,
[5:15] money is power in in this earth. Amen.
[5:18] But it doesn't money doesn't mean
[5:20] anything to God. Amen. That's not power
[5:22] with God. Praise the Lord.
[5:25] Uh verse 10, for the love of money is
[5:27] the root of all evil.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; That's a powerful statement. Amen. Which
[5:32] while some coveted after, they have
[5:34] aired from the faith and pierce
[5:36] themselves through with many sorrows.
[5:39] Amen. So money is actually uh remember
[5:42] there's three things brother Bham taught
[5:43] that that would uh draw uh ministers
[5:46] away and that's money, popularity, and
[5:48] women. He taught. Amen. And so money
[5:51] when people get to where they they love
[5:55] receiving it and love being wealthy,
[5:56] love having the the nicest things and
[5:59] and and taking care of themselves and
[6:01] and and looking better than other people
[6:03] and and they get used to that prestige,
[6:06] you know, we call it. And and some it
[6:08] actually pulled them away from the
[6:10] faith.
[6:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if they if you continue in
[6:13] the true faith, your money belongs to
[6:16] God. Amen.
[6:17] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. You don't you
[6:18] can't in good conscience just use it all
[6:20] lavishly on your own to consume it on
[6:23] your lusts. Right? Amen.
[6:25] &gt;&gt; So, and then he says uh verse 11, but
[6:29] thou, oh man of God, flee these things
[6:32] and follow after righteousness,
[6:34] godliness, faith, love, patience,
[6:37] meekness. Amen. That that sounds better
[6:40] already. Amen.
[6:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Things that that pass
[6:43] that don't pass away. Amen.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Fight the good fight of
[6:47] faith. Lay hold on eternal life. Amen.
[6:50] Not the not the not the stocks and and
[6:54] uh don't you don't need to lay hold on
[6:57] uh the the biggest paycheck. Amen. Or he
[6:59] didn't say lay hold on six figures.
[7:01] Amen. Lay hold on eternal life. Amen.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's that's the real
[7:06] thing. Amen.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; Where unto thou art also called and hast
[7:10] professed a good profession before many
[7:13] witnesses.
[7:15] Amen. Skipping down to verse 17. Charge
[7:18] them that are rich in this world that
[7:21] they be not high-minded.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Uh oh, that's that's a you know, I can't
[7:26] speak to to people personally. Um these
[7:29] the the megaurch pastors, you could say.
[7:31] I mean, um but if you maybe you've seen
[7:35] video clips or you know, you you have to
[7:38] be careful what you see. It could be
[7:39] hearsay or anything, but generally the
[7:41] attitude of some is we know for sure
[7:43] it's the attitude of some, maybe not
[7:44] all.
[7:45] But they're high-minded. That's a good
[7:48] way to describe it. What he says that
[7:50] they they think they're so above. Well,
[7:53] obviously, um, the Lord loves me because
[7:56] I have I have four limos and and a
[7:59] private jet and and look how big my
[8:01] church is. The Lord wouldn't increase my
[8:03] church to um, you know, 400,000
[8:07] people or however much um, if if the
[8:10] Lord uh, didn't love me the most.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:14] But that's that's not what he's teaching
[8:16] here. That's high-minded. That's being
[8:17] puffed up.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. I Let me tell you something. This
[8:21] church is rich in the in the spirit of
[8:22] God, not having um a thousand people.
[8:25] Amen. I appreciate that.
[8:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's uh as long as we've been
[8:31] coming here and attending and and
[8:32] fellowshipping with brother Jesse and
[8:34] you all here, um the Lord is just as
[8:36] welcome here, probably more welcome here
[8:38] than a lot of other places. So it's not
[8:42] it's not about how much uh worldly goods
[8:46] the church has or the pastor has. Amen.
[8:48] We and we know this. Amen. This is is
[8:51] fundamentals of the of the faith here.
[8:53] &gt;&gt; But uh but it's needful. Amen. Praise
[8:55] the Lord. So verse 17, charge them that
[8:58] are rich in this world. They be not
[9:00] high- minded nor trust in uncertain
[9:02] riches. So that's what they're doing.
[9:03] They're trusting in their riches as a
[9:05] sign of God's approval. Amen. But what
[9:08] did brother Brandham say? He said,
[9:09] "Clear skies and sunny skies are not
[9:11] signs of God's approval, but neither are
[9:13] dark and cloudy skies signs of his
[9:15] disapproval." Amen.
[9:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; But he said, "But that they do good."
[9:21] Um, oh, sorry. But then the living God,
[9:24] verse 17, who giveth us richly all
[9:27] things to enjoy.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; Verse 18, that they do good, that they
[9:31] be rich in good works. Amen. Ready to
[9:34] distribute or share,
[9:36] &gt;&gt; uh, willing to communicate. Amen.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; Or take care of people, you know, and
[9:42] laying up in store for themselves a good
[9:43] foundation against the time to come.
[9:46] Amen. This isn't the time to come. This
[9:48] is the time now. But the time that's to
[9:50] come is in the the in the in the next in
[9:53] heaven. Amen.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That they may lay hold on eternal
[9:58] life. Amen. That again, he's pointing to
[10:01] eternal life as the gain. Godliness is
[10:03] the gain. Amen. The main thing, the
[10:05] prize. Amen. Yes.
[10:07] &gt;&gt; Eternal life. Praise God. You It can't
[10:09] be bought or sold. Amen.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; So, um
[10:14] going to uh we'll read Philippians here.
[10:16] Um in chapter 3
[10:21] of Philippians, uh we'll start verse 7.
[10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; We want to gain the heavenly treasures.
[10:32] Amen.
[10:36] Praise God.
[10:41] Amen. Excuse me. I had two scriptures
[10:43] written down here. Yes. Uh Philippians
[10:45] Yes. 3:7. Praise the Lord.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh even as is as it is meat for me
[10:52] to think uh this of you all because I
[10:56] have you in my heart. In as much as both
[10:58] in my bonds and in the defense and
[11:00] confirmation of the gospel, ye all are
[11:02] partakers of my grace. Uh for God is my
[11:05] record how greatly I long after you all
[11:07] in the bowels of Jesus Christ. Uh, and
[11:10] this I pray that your love may abound
[11:13] yet more and more in knowledge and in
[11:15] all judgment, that you may approve
[11:17] things that are excellent, that you may
[11:19] be sincere without offense till the day
[11:22] of Christ, being filled with the fruits
[11:24] of righteousness, which are by Jesus
[11:26] Christ unto the glory and praise of God.
[11:28] Amen. What did he say to to follow
[11:30] after? Amen. Uh, righteousness and um,
[11:34] you know, godliness, faith. Amen. These
[11:37] things that can't be purchased with
[11:38] money. Amen. and he said, "Lay hold on
[11:40] eternal life."
[11:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And then, uh, going to
[11:43] the next chapter here, Philippians 4.
[11:46] Amen. We're looking, that's what we're
[11:47] looking to attain is, is eternal life
[11:49] and the rapture. Amen.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking toward.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God. in Philippians 4 and
[11:56] starting at verse 10. He says, "But I
[11:58] rejoiced in the Lord greatly
[12:00] that how that now at the last your care
[12:03] of me hath flourished again, wherein you
[12:06] were also careful, but you lacked
[12:08] opportunity." Other words, they were
[12:09] trying to take care of Paul, but at the
[12:10] time they they just didn't have a way to
[12:12] to get their support to him. Maybe he
[12:15] was in in prison or they couldn't get
[12:16] somebody in the prison or something
[12:17] along those lines. Um, but he said, "Not
[12:20] that I speak in respect of one, for I
[12:23] have learned in whatsoever state I am,
[12:25] there was to be content."
[12:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I wonder all the I wonder
[12:30] all the lessons maybe he had to go
[12:32] through that he had to learn that. Amen.
[12:34] You You don't always learn just by
[12:36] receiving knowledge, you know, from a
[12:39] textbook or something. But but to learn
[12:40] these kind of things has to be by
[12:42] experience. Is that right?
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I I I wonder going from being a
[12:46] Pharisee of the Pharisees to being a a a
[12:48] hated apostle of Christ, servant of
[12:51] Christ,
[12:52] &gt;&gt; he had to learn in whatever state he was
[12:54] in, money or no money. Amen.
[12:56] &gt;&gt; Uh food, food or no food, you know, meal
[12:58] or no meal.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I know the Lord provided uh
[13:02] but he said in whatever state that I am
[13:04] in right now, I can be content. Amen.
[13:07] &gt;&gt; Because I've laid hold on eternal life.
[13:09] Amen.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[13:12] I know both how to be abased and I know
[13:15] how to abound. Everywhere and in all
[13:18] things I'm instructed both to be full
[13:20] and to be hungry, both to abound and to
[13:23] suffer need. Excuse me.
[13:28] So he said, I'm I'm instructed. Amen. By
[13:30] what? By the words of the Lord Jesus.
[13:32] Amen. That uh Jesus talked about and and
[13:35] by his own example, his life. Amen. He
[13:38] who he didn't even have the money to to
[13:40] pay the tax. So he told Peter to go to
[13:42] go catch a fish and the fish would have
[13:44] the money. You know, Jesus didn't just
[13:46] have a pile of money laying around that
[13:47] just, you know, he didn't he wasn't
[13:49] taking people's money. Amen.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; He he wasn't that kind of prosperity
[13:52] gospel preacher. Amen.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He was the He was the real
[13:55] prosperity gospel preacher.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Take no thought for
[14:00] tomorrow." Praise God.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I'm instructed, he said, both
[14:04] to be full and to be hungry, both to
[14:06] abound and to suffer need. Amen. And I
[14:09] can do, this is another scripture, verse
[14:11] 13, that that they uh many people use,
[14:14] you know, out of context or use in the
[14:16] wrong way, but it says, I can do all
[14:18] things through Christ which strengthenth
[14:20] me. These all things is to be abased, to
[14:23] be to abound, to be poor, to be rich,
[14:26] you know, and and what whatsoever state
[14:28] I am. Amen. I can do all of it through
[14:30] Christ.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; Which strengthenth me. Praise God. He is
[14:35] our portion. Amen.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; And verse 14, notwithstanding, ye have
[14:38] well done that you did communicate with
[14:40] my affliction. Uh now ye Philippians
[14:43] know also that in the beginning of the
[14:45] gospel when I departed from ne
[14:47] Macedonia, no church communicated with
[14:49] me concerning giving and receiving, but
[14:51] ye only.
[14:53] Now these days, you know, we still
[14:55] communicate with with apostles that the
[14:57] Lord sends missionaries. um now that
[14:59] that the Lord sends, we still want to
[15:00] support them with offerings and and uh
[15:03] support there. And um so we still want
[15:06] to communicate to their need. Amen. The
[15:08] same way. Praise God. And verse 16,
[15:11] &gt;&gt; for even in Thessalonica uh ye sent once
[15:14] again unto my necessity, not because I
[15:16] desire a gift. See, there's there's the
[15:19] difference. Um but I desire fruit that
[15:22] may abound to your account. Amen. Not
[15:25] because he desired them to pay all your
[15:28] all the money you have. Just give it to
[15:29] me. Amen. And I'll I'll use it, you
[15:31] know, for the for the Lord's work. You
[15:33] know, uh but he said, "I desire that
[15:35] fruit may actually abound to your
[15:37] account." Amen. He didn't just desire a
[15:39] gift. It was all going to the gospel.
[15:41] Amen.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God. To to invest in the kingdom
[15:43] of heaven. Amen. To win souls. That's
[15:46] what it was for.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And remember Jesus promised that
[15:49] whosoever shall give uh to drink uh to
[15:52] to one of his disciples a cup of cool
[15:54] water in the name of a disciple. Amen.
[15:56] They shall no li and no wise lose their
[15:58] reward. Amen. Praise God. In verse 18 he
[16:02] says but I have all and abound. I am
[16:05] full having received of Apaproditis the
[16:08] things which were sent from you. And
[16:09] notice what he says an odor of sweet
[16:12] smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well
[16:14] pleasing to God. Amen. Not just to Paul.
[16:16] Paul. It wasn't a sacrifice to Paul.
[16:18] Amen. It was support to Paul, but the
[16:20] sacrifice was to God. Amen. For the
[16:22] kingdom of God.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh you know in Acts
[16:26] chapter 10, uh we read the story of
[16:28] Cornelius and um I really appreciate
[16:31] that story. And it says that he he gave
[16:34] alms and prayed always. Amen. That he
[16:36] was a a devout man unto God. Now him
[16:38] being uh I believe he'd be a Roman.
[16:40] Amen. He was a uh he was um not a Jew,
[16:44] but still being a devout man. He was a
[16:47] gentile.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; Um but still he served the Lord. Maybe
[16:50] he saw the things that Jesus did and he
[16:52] recognized there was something real and
[16:54] and he thought that's the God that I
[16:56] want to serve. The the God of the
[16:57] Israelites is God. Amen. I want to serve
[16:59] him, too. Amen. And so he was devout,
[17:02] not even not knowing the whole gospel.
[17:04] Amen. He didn't even know. All he knew
[17:05] is he needed to serve God. Amen. Amen.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that his alms and
[17:10] his prayers actually came up as a
[17:12] memorial before God.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; So God saw it and he looked on it and
[17:16] and actually the Lord chose him and his
[17:20] house to be the first Gentiles to
[17:22] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[17:23] Amen. And isn't that a wonderful reward?
[17:26] Amen.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; Because the Gentiles before then, the
[17:31] Jews looked at them as dogs. Amen. But
[17:34] uh God gave Peter the vision, remember,
[17:36] of the unclean animals that uh that God
[17:38] told him, "Don't call unclean what I
[17:41] have made clean." Amen.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. He made a way for us to
[17:43] to us to be clean and and receive the
[17:45] Holy Ghost, too.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank the Lord. But it actually is
[17:49] a is a like Paul said, an odor of a
[17:51] sweet smell. It's something we can
[17:53] actually do for God. Amen. A sacrifice
[17:56] acceptable, well pleasing to God. Praise
[17:58] the Lord. That's what that's what I want
[18:00] to do. Amen. That's what I want. Amen.
[18:03] And uh realize God blessed in
[18:06] Cornelius's case, God blessed his soul.
[18:08] Amen. Not his not his bank account.
[18:10] Amen.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Which he can he can bless
[18:13] both. Amen. He he'll provide all our
[18:15] needs. Amen. And some people he entrusts
[18:18] with more than others. Amen. But the
[18:20] main thing, Amen, is is is your soul
[18:23] being rich before God.
[18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Laying hold on eternal life.
[18:27] That's the main thing. Amen. But my God
[18:30] shall supply all your need according to
[18:32] his riches and glory by Christ Jesus.
[18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the prosperity gospel.
[18:36] Amen. The real the real prosperity
[18:38] gospel. Praise God. And uh in Matthew
[18:41] chapter 16, uh Jesus says from starting
[18:45] in verse 24, uh he says uh then said
[18:48] Jesus to his disciples, if any man will
[18:51] come after me, let him deny himself.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Right?
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Oh boy. That's that's different from the
[18:57] the fake prosperity gospel mindset.
[18:59] Amen. They don't deny themselves. They
[19:01] indulge themselves. Amen. They they use
[19:04] their money to fulfill the lust of their
[19:06] flesh. Amen.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; But he instructs them to deny themsel.
[19:10] If any man will come after me, let him
[19:12] deny himself. Take up his cross. Amen. A
[19:15] cross is not a pleasant thing. Amen. He
[19:18] didn't say, "Let him take up his
[19:19] Lamborghini and follow me." Amen. Take
[19:22] up his cross. Amen.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God. the his the old things, the
[19:26] lust of the flesh are crucified. Amen.
[19:28] Done away with.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:32] And follow me.
[19:34] For whosoever will save his life shall
[19:37] lose it. Whosoever will lose his life
[19:39] for my sake shall find it.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. For what is a man profited if he
[19:44] shall gain the whole world
[19:45] &gt;&gt; and lose his own soul?
[19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you if you gain every every
[19:50] model sports car you wanted, every
[19:52] expensive house you could want. Amen. If
[19:54] you gain you you have your own island
[19:57] resort. Amen. Whatever it may be. Um or
[20:00] let's bring it maybe to the to the
[20:01] middle class. If you just if you just
[20:03] make the six figures that you wanted or
[20:05] whatever it may be, you just get the
[20:07] house that you just couldn't live
[20:08] without. Amen.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; But if you gain all that you wanted and
[20:12] thought you needed but failed to gain
[20:15] eternal life, what does it profit you?
[20:17] Amen. You've lost everything. Amen.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. For what is a man
[20:22] profited? if he shall gain the whole
[20:23] world and lose his own soul. Or what
[20:25] shall a man give in exchange for his
[20:27] soul?
[20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; You you can get everything you want and
[20:32] still fail to gain the the most precious
[20:35] thing. Amen. It's eternal life. Amen.
[20:38] And and they you get to the point if you
[20:40] follow after money uh and you get and
[20:42] get and get and and spend and buy and
[20:44] acquire and and for all for the flesh,
[20:47] you know, and you get to the point where
[20:49] the only thing you want is everything
[20:50] you don't have. Amen.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; That's that's all that they want is what
[20:54] they don't have. Amen.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; And and then it just becomes a a lust
[20:57] that that can't be um can't be
[21:00] satisfied. Amen. Because they're and
[21:02] we've we've all heard it put this way.
[21:04] They're trying to fill their God-shaped
[21:06] hole in their heart with the things of
[21:07] the world. Amen. It's the wrong things.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's only one thing that can
[21:12] satisfy that. That's the Lord Jesus
[21:14] Christ. Amen.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That's all all
[21:18] vanities. Amen. It's all vanity.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. and all the things of all the
[21:22] earthly things is vanity. Amen. And you
[21:24] know, I wonder uh if the if uh the the
[21:28] bigname um preachers and and uh
[21:31] prosperity gospel preachers that that
[21:33] spend so much time acquiring these
[21:35] things and and they've got, you know, um
[21:38] multiple accounts and and they're the
[21:40] CEO, you know, and and a big name and a
[21:44] reputation and I'm known all over the
[21:46] world. Amen. I'm Dr. Dr. Reverend so and
[21:49] so, you know, and and um and as as I
[21:53] think that's one way brother Brandon put
[21:54] it, um the holy Reverend Dr. Pope So and
[21:56] so or something along those lines and
[21:58] and um but they that's what they look
[22:00] for. They seek for um the certification
[22:04] and approval of man. Amen. And gaining
[22:06] all these these treasures and and that's
[22:09] what it is, approval of man. Amen. But
[22:11] they they fail to get the approval of
[22:13] God. Amen.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that the approval of God is
[22:17] his seal of the Holy Ghost. Amen. That
[22:18] he he approves your faith.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I I wonder in seeking all
[22:22] those things if they forgot to seek
[22:24] after righteousness and faith. Amen. And
[22:27] and and love and patience and meekness,
[22:29] all these things that that he he was
[22:32] instructing Timothy to seek after. He
[22:34] said, "But thou, oh man of God, flee
[22:36] those things. Seek after these things."
[22:38] Amen. Righteousness.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; Excuse me. My throat always seems to get
[22:44] dry right when I get up to preach.
[22:48] Praise the Lord. That's all right. The
[22:49] Lord's gracious. Amen.
[22:51] And uh, Brother Brandham says this here
[22:53] in in uh, a sermon called Come Follow Me
[22:56] from uh, 63. He says a little story I
[22:59] heard one time uh, a man who was he was
[23:02] poor and he he always wanted to be uh,
[23:05] rich. It's a a little fairy story. So,
[23:07] he's it's he's using this fairy tale as
[23:09] an example here. So, understand that.
[23:12] It always stuck with me though. And one
[23:14] day he picked a flower and the flower
[23:17] was was magic. You know, in the in the
[23:19] in the context of a fairy tale, it was
[23:21] magic. He says, "And the flower answered
[23:24] to him and said, "You've been poor all
[23:25] your life." He said, "Now ask what you
[23:28] will and it'll be given to you."
[23:31] In other words, it granted granted his
[23:33] wishes. You know, kind of like a genie
[23:35] or something. But uh but he said uh that
[23:39] yonder's mountain would open up. This
[23:41] was his desire that he was telling this
[23:42] flower that could grant anything he
[23:44] wanted. He said uh that yonder mountain
[23:46] would open up. I could go therein and
[23:49] find all the gold in the mountain. And
[23:51] he said, "Well, you'll have to take me
[23:53] wherever you go. See, you'll have to
[23:55] take me with you. So, wherever I am,
[23:57] then you can ask what you will." And he
[23:59] walked to the mountain and the mountain
[24:01] opened up. He went in, the shelves was
[24:03] full of gold and diamonds, as the little
[24:05] fairy story goes. He laid the flower
[24:08] down on a a table or a rock and he he
[24:11] grabbed a great big gem. He said, "I I
[24:13] must go show this to my friends and now
[24:15] I'm a rich man. I have everything now. I
[24:17] must show this." And so the flower
[24:20] spoke. Uh but said, "You forgot the main
[24:23] thing." So he runs back in, picks up,
[24:26] says, "Well, maybe I'll grab a piece of
[24:28] gold. I'll get a piece of silver." He
[24:29] says, "Then I'll hurry out, tell the the
[24:31] people how rich I am, what all I've
[24:33] got." And he got to the door and the
[24:35] flower said, "But you forgot the main
[24:37] thing." Amen. So he runs back and and
[24:39] picks up and says, "Well, maybe I'll um
[24:41] sorry." He runs back uh again says, "In
[24:44] here we find all kinds of materials." So
[24:46] he picked up a stone. He said, "I'll go
[24:49] um take this stone and show the people
[24:52] what kind of stone this mountain is made
[24:53] of so I can come find my way back to
[24:55] it." See, he started out the door again
[24:57] and the flower for the final time said,
[24:59] "You have forgot the main thing." He
[25:02] said, 'Oh, shut up.' And see, he didn't
[25:04] want to hear it anymore. Forgot the main
[25:06] thing this flower was trying to tell
[25:09] him. And and and he ran out the door.
[25:11] And when he did, the door closed behind
[25:13] him with a flower on the inside. Amen.
[25:15] The main thing was the flower the whole
[25:17] time. Amen. See, the main thing was the
[25:19] flower. And being a being a a fairy
[25:22] tale, he says, using it as an example,
[25:24] um being drawn to the riches. All he
[25:27] wanted was the riches. He forgot the
[25:29] main thing. Amen. that that was that
[25:32] made him able to get what he wanted in
[25:34] the first place. And that was the
[25:35] flower. And and it would be a type of of
[25:38] Jesus who said, "Ask what you will in my
[25:40] name and it'll be done unto you." Amen.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; But if you ask a miss just that you can
[25:45] consume upon your own lusts. Amen. That
[25:48] won't be given to you. Amen. Because you
[25:49] ask it miss. Amen. But they they ask and
[25:52] ask and and desire these things to
[25:53] consume upon their lusts and forget the
[25:55] main thing the whole time is the Lord
[25:58] Jesus. Amen.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; He is the main thing. They forget all
[26:01] about him. Amen. They they they leave
[26:02] him behind and uh and they use his name.
[26:05] Amen. But they leave him behind and and
[26:08] just use his name to get riches and
[26:10] glory for themselves, not for God. Amen.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; And uh we're all familiar with this
[26:16] here. The message to Leosia in
[26:17] Revelation um chapter 3:1 17 says
[26:22] because thou sayest, I am rich and
[26:25] increased with goods and have need of
[26:27] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[26:30] wretched and miserable and poor and
[26:32] blind and naked. My thinking they're
[26:35] rich but he told them their real
[26:37] condition. Amen.
[26:40] And they were wretched in his eyes and
[26:43] miserable, poor, blind, naked. Amen.
[26:46] And that doesn't sound rich. Amen. They
[26:48] weren't rich toward God. In other words,
[26:50] &gt;&gt; verse 18, I counsel thee to buy of me
[26:52] gold tried in the fire that thou mayest
[26:55] be rich, and white raignment that thou
[26:57] mayest be clothed, and that the shame of
[26:59] thy nakedness do not appear, and anoint
[27:02] thine eyes with Isaav, that thou mayest
[27:04] see. Amen. The the real treasure, the
[27:08] gold that's tried in the fire. Amen. But
[27:09] people don't want to be tried in the
[27:11] fire.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:12] In order to get something worth
[27:14] something, you've got to sacrifice
[27:16] something for it. Amen.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; And um again in Revelation, we we read
[27:24] uh in the the messages to the churches,
[27:26] um all of them come with a with a
[27:29] reward. Amen.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; And a reward to the overcomer. Whosoever
[27:32] overcomes um in in each age. Amen. And
[27:36] um I'll just read through them here um
[27:38] from Revelation chapter 2 and three. Um,
[27:42] but it's the portion of the overcomer
[27:44] here. He says, "He that hath an ear, let
[27:47] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[27:48] churches. To him that overcomemeth will
[27:50] I give to eat of the tree of life, which
[27:53] is in the midst of the paradise of God."
[27:54] Amen. Notice the the notice what all
[27:57] these portions are. Amen. The tree of
[27:59] life. Amen. And then, he that hath an
[28:01] ear, let him hear of the spirit saith
[28:02] unto the churches. He that overcomemeth
[28:04] shall not be hurt of the second death.
[28:06] Amen.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; Again, life. He that hath an ear, let
[28:10] him hear what the spirit saith to the
[28:12] churches. To him that overcomemeth will
[28:13] I give to eat of the hidden mana. Amen.
[28:16] And will give him a white stone, and in
[28:18] the stone a new name written, which no
[28:20] man knoweth, saving he that receiveth
[28:22] it. And he that overcomemeth, and
[28:24] keepeth my words uh my works unto the
[28:28] end. To him will I give power over the
[28:30] nations, and he shall rule over them or
[28:32] rule them with a rod of iron, as the
[28:35] vessels of a potter shall they be broken
[28:37] into shivers. uh even as I received of
[28:39] my father. Amen. And I will give him the
[28:42] morning star. Amen. So what is what is
[28:45] he saying? What are all the overcomers
[28:47] receiving? What is their portion? It is
[28:49] the Lord Jesus himself. Amen.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. The morning star. Praise God. The
[28:54] hidden mana, the living bread. Amen.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God. To him that overcomemeth.
[28:58] The same shall be clothed in white
[29:00] raignment. I will not blot out his name
[29:02] out of the book of life, but I will
[29:03] confess his name before my father and
[29:05] before his angels. Amen. What an honor
[29:06] that is. Amen.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Him that overcomemeth will I
[29:10] make a pillar in the temple of my God,
[29:12] and he shall go out, go no more out, and
[29:15] I will write upon him the name of my
[29:16] God, and the name of the city of my God,
[29:19] which is New Jerusalem, which cometh
[29:21] down out of heaven from my God, and I
[29:25] will write upon him my new name. Amen.
[29:27] Amen.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; And then to him that overcomemeth will I
[29:29] grant to situ uh with me in my throne
[29:32] even as I also overcame and am set down
[29:35] with my father in his throne. Amen.
[29:37] Praise God. The the portion the reward
[29:39] of the overcomer is the Lord Jesus
[29:41] himself. Amen.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; Because there there is no greater reward
[29:45] there that you that there could be.
[29:46] Amen.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; In the same way that he could swear by
[29:50] no greater because there was no greater.
[29:52] Thus he he also cannot reward any
[29:54] greater than himself. Amen. He is the
[29:56] reward. Praise God.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is our portion. Amen. There's
[30:00] What else could we ask? Amen. What else
[30:02] could we long for? Amen. Other than
[30:04] that, Amen.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's the reward of
[30:09] the soul. Amen.
[30:11] Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother.
[30:13] Appreciate that.
[30:17] Amen. And uh in Lamentations
[30:20] um chapter 3 and verse 24, he says, "The
[30:24] Lord is my portion. saith my soul. Amen.
[30:27] Not everybody can say that. Amen. Unless
[30:29] you're sure. Amen. Unless you've
[30:31] accepted the Lord and obeyed the Lord,
[30:33] then you can say like like he says here
[30:35] in Lamentations, the Lord is my portion,
[30:37] saith my soul.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Therefore will I hope in him. Amen. Not
[30:41] trusting in uncertain riches but in God.
[30:44] Praise the Lord.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um
[30:48] and brother Brandon, I'm here in in uh
[30:50] in a message called birth pains. Uh here
[30:53] he tells um the interpretation. He gives
[30:55] the interpretation of uh one time a a
[30:58] Baptist brother came up on the platform
[31:00] to greet him and um and the Lord
[31:02] anointed him, opened his mouth and he he
[31:05] uh spoke a message in tongues uh to
[31:07] brother Brandham. And uh of course we
[31:09] know it as as the uh as the harder way,
[31:11] you know, um
[31:12] &gt;&gt; quote here. And so this is the
[31:14] interpretation of that. But notice what
[31:16] the Lord wanted to tell brother Brandham
[31:18] here.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. that because thou hast chosen the
[31:21] narrow path, the harder way, thou hast
[31:24] walked of your own choosing. Praise God.
[31:26] It is a choice, brothers and sisters.
[31:28] Amen.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; That thou has picked the correct and
[31:31] precise decision. Amen.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; And hearing that from the Lord himself.
[31:35] Amen. Amen. We'll hear it, too. Amen.
[31:37] Well done, thou good and faithful
[31:39] servant. Amen.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; That's what we long to hear. Now, it's
[31:41] made the correct decision. Amen.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; That's what we want to choose. Uh and it
[31:46] is my way. Amen. Because of this
[31:49] momentous decision, a huge portion of
[31:51] heaven awaits thee. What a glorious
[31:53] decision thou has made. Amen. I have I
[31:56] have decided to follow Jesus. Amen. No
[31:58] turning back.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. No. None. Go with me. Still I will
[32:01] follow.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a glorious decision you've
[32:03] made if you've decided to follow Jesus.
[32:05] Amen.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; This in itself is that which I will give
[32:09] and make to come to pass. The tremendous
[32:11] victory in the love divine. Amen.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Isn't that wonderful?
[32:16] That's that's the portion I want. Amen.
[32:18] He said a huge portion of heaven awaits
[32:20] the the the biggest portion of heaven he
[32:22] could have is Jesus Christ. Amen. The
[32:24] the portion of the overcomer. Amen.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; And we know he'll also receive a
[32:29] prophet's reward. Whatever that is. We I
[32:31] I don't know at least on this side
[32:33] exactly what that is, but but um but we
[32:36] know he'll receive it. Amen. But we will
[32:38] also receive the greatest reward, Jesus
[32:41] Christ. Amen. Forever eternally. Amen.
[32:44] Our our light, our life. Amen.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Uh we read this in the
[32:49] in the church age book in the Smyrnian
[32:51] church age here and uh in the new book
[32:53] that was printed to be uh paragraph
[32:55] starting at paragraph 31. Amen. But it
[32:58] says I know thy poverty uh but thou are
[33:02] rich. And this is the the uh message to
[33:04] Smyrna here. There it is again. Uh see
[33:07] him walking up and down in the midst of
[33:09] the church like a father. He is looking
[33:11] down upon his family. He is the head of
[33:13] his household. He is the provider. He is
[33:15] the protector. Uh yet he looks on on at
[33:19] their poverty. Oh, how the untutored
[33:22] believer stumbles at this. My how can
[33:25] God bear to look upon his own in a time
[33:28] of need and not just stop it all, just
[33:30] give in and lavish every material thing
[33:32] upon them? Amen. That's how carnally
[33:34] people think. And that's why they fall
[33:35] for the prosperity gospel. Amen. Because
[33:37] they think that gain is godliness, not
[33:40] realizing that that godliness is gain.
[33:42] Amen. Yes, sir. Here is what you have to
[33:45] believe again or where you have to
[33:47] believe again in the love and goodness
[33:49] and wisdom of God. This too is needful.
[33:52] Remember he admonished take no thought
[33:54] for the tomorrow what ye shall eat or
[33:57] what you shall put on. Your father
[33:59] knoweth the things uh ye have need of.
[34:02] He who clothe the lily of the field uh
[34:04] and feeds the sparrow shall do much more
[34:06] for you. These physical things are not
[34:09] the true basic necessities of your life.
[34:11] For a man's life consisteth not of the
[34:13] things he possesses,
[34:15] &gt;&gt; but rather seek ye first the kingdom of
[34:16] God and his righteousness, and all
[34:18] material necessities will be added unto
[34:20] you.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Notice it's not not all material wants.
[34:24] Amen. It's the necessities. Amen. He
[34:26] knows what you have need of. Praise God.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Because what heart wants, Jesus said,
[34:29] the heart is deceitful above all things.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; It wants what the flesh wants.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. But but that's not what is
[34:35] needful. Amen.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; And but look what he says here. This
[34:38] struck me when I when I read it. The
[34:40] people of God are not material-minded.
[34:43] They are Christminded. Amen. They want
[34:46] the things of Christ. Amen. Who who
[34:48] cares if we have an a nice car or or uh
[34:51] you know a a mansion here on earth?
[34:53] Jesus didn't have anywhere to lay his
[34:54] head on earth. Amen.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; And if he was despised, he said, "You
[34:58] will also be despised." Amen. Not that
[35:01] again, not that we can't have houses.
[35:03] Thank the Lord we we have houses and
[35:05] roofs over our head. Thank the Lord we
[35:06] have vehicles to get us here and there
[35:08] and for places. Thank the Lord for those
[35:10] things. But that's not the main thing.
[35:13] Amen. Remember the main thing. Amen.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; They do not seek the treasures that are
[35:18] below. They seek those above. It is
[35:21] absolutely true. The majority of
[35:23] Christians are not wealthy. Uh rather
[35:26] they are on the poor side. Usually he
[35:28] says uh it was so in Jesus's day. It was
[35:31] true in Paul's day and it should be true
[35:32] today. And then he says, "Oh, it's not
[35:34] too true today for the Leoysian age is
[35:37] one of vast wealth where often the
[35:39] criterion of spirituality is an
[35:42] abundance of earthly goods." Amen.
[35:43] That's how they measure the blessings of
[35:45] God as their their physical goods, their
[35:48] earthly goods. Amen.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; But my how rich the church is in goods,
[35:52] but how poor in spirit,
[35:53] &gt;&gt; but not the not the poor in spirit Jesus
[35:55] was talking about because he said,
[35:56] "Blessed are the poor in spirit,
[35:58] &gt;&gt; but but poor or lacking in the fruits of
[36:01] the spirit." Amen. And the power of the
[36:03] spirit. They're lacking. They're poor.
[36:05] Amen.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Blessed are be ye poor, for yours is the
[36:10] kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is
[36:12] not meat and drink. It is not material.
[36:15] It is within us.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; A rich man is rich in God, not in
[36:20] worldly things. Praise the Lord.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, cries the spirit. I see your
[36:24] poverty. I see your need. Amen. Don't
[36:26] ever think he doesn't see it. Amen. He
[36:28] says, I see your need. You haven't very
[36:30] much if anything to boast of. What you
[36:32] did have has been taken from you. You
[36:34] gladly gave up your possessions in ex in
[36:37] exchange for eternal ones. Amen. You are
[36:39] laughed at. You are scorned. You don't
[36:41] have material resources to fall back on.
[36:43] But you are rich in spite of it all.
[36:45] Your security lies in him who is your
[36:47] shield and exceeding great reward.
[36:50] Praise the Lord. Amen. I I have that one
[36:52] highlighted. I just highlighted in the
[36:53] office there. Amen. Who is your your
[36:55] security lies in him who is your
[36:57] exceeding great reward. Amen.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Not what they call securities and and
[37:02] stocks and bonds. Amen.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; But that's the real security. Eternal
[37:05] security.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Assurance. Blessed assurance.
[37:08] Amen.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus is mine. Oh, what a foretaste of
[37:12] glory divine.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Heirs of salvation, purchase of God,
[37:15] born of a spirit, washed in his blood.
[37:17] Amen. Praise God. That's the main thing.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; He says, "Your kingdom is yet to come,
[37:22] but it will come and it will be an
[37:24] everlasting one." Yes. I I am mindful of
[37:26] your trials and woes. I know how hard it
[37:29] is to get along. But I will remember all
[37:31] of this when I return to claim you as my
[37:33] own. Amen. And then I will reward you.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now notice what he says here. This
[37:41] is nothing against rich people
[37:44] &gt;&gt; because God can save a rich man. Amen.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus just said how hardly it is for a
[37:49] rich man to enter into the kingdom of
[37:50] heaven.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; But God can save a rich man. Nothing
[37:53] against rich people. He says, "Some of
[37:56] God's children are rich." Again, like we
[37:58] said, God entrusts sometimes more to
[38:00] some people than others. Amen.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; But that is not the standard of of their
[38:04] condition of their soul with God. Amen.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; But money can be such a snare.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. Amen. Not only to
[38:12] those who have it, but to those who
[38:14] don't have it.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Way back there in the first age,
[38:17] James cried out to those who were
[38:19] putting stock in wealthy people. Have
[38:21] not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ
[38:23] with respect of persons. The poor there
[38:25] were trying to butter up the rich in
[38:27] order to get help rather than trusting
[38:29] in God.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Don't do it, says James. Don't do it.
[38:32] Money isn't everything. Money isn't the
[38:35] answer. And today, it is not the answer
[38:37] either. Amen. That's that's the point
[38:39] we're trying to get to. Amen. We have
[38:40] more wealth than we have ever had. And
[38:43] yet less is being accomplished
[38:44] spiritually. Amen. Look at the the
[38:47] conditions of churches, you know, in
[38:48] general, the national church. Amen. The
[38:50] global church, the condition is it's so
[38:53] sad. Amen. What they're focusing on.
[38:55] Amen. Getting themselves a name, having
[38:58] the best the best uh musicians and songs
[39:00] and um their their churches uh selling
[39:04] music and and um selling their their uh
[39:07] sermons or courses. Oh, just take this
[39:09] course. Learn even some of them. I've
[39:12] seen some of them that learn how to be a
[39:14] prophet. Take this course in order to
[39:15] learn how to be a prophet. Amen. And
[39:16] you'll be blessed, too. And it's like,
[39:18] well, that's that's not what the
[39:20] scripture teaches. Amen.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; The scripture teaches the Lord gives
[39:23] gifts severally to whom he will. Amen.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; And now, um, he says, uh, money isn't
[39:30] the answer. Um, yes, less less is being
[39:33] accomplished spiritually. Amen. How many
[39:35] souls are being saved and and sealed
[39:37] into the kingdom?
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. by by pastors gaining all these
[39:41] wealth all this wealth you know by
[39:44] taking all their money is that is that
[39:46] giving them eternal life amen by by
[39:49] taking their livelihood
[39:51] &gt;&gt; absolutely not that's that's hogwash we
[39:53] call it sir
[39:55] &gt;&gt; praise the lord it is not with money
[39:57] that god works again he can use it but
[40:00] it's not with money that god works he
[40:02] moves by his spirit
[40:04] &gt;&gt; and that moving of the spirit comes only
[40:07] to a life consecrated to the word. Amen.
[40:09] That's why they forsake the word and and
[40:12] take uh monetary gain. Amen.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; They take money. They serve mammon and
[40:18] not god because you you can only serve
[40:19] one or the other. You can't serve both.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. And I This is skipping down
[40:25] here a few paragraphs. Um and I will
[40:28] give thee a crown of life. Since not
[40:30] even a cup of cold water given in the
[40:32] name of the Lord fails to receive a
[40:34] reward, how great shall be the reward to
[40:37] him who gives his life as a martyr for
[40:39] the name of the Lord Jesus.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Perhaps we can get a small idea if we
[40:44] compare this crown uh with the crown one
[40:47] in a race. In 1 Corinthians 9:24, Paul
[40:50] says, "Know ye not that they which run
[40:52] in a race run all, but one receiveth the
[40:55] prize? So run that ye may obtain.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. A crown given to the winner of the
[41:00] Olympic race was a garland of olive
[41:02] branches. But the crown spoken of here
[41:05] in Revelation given to a martyr is the
[41:07] crown of royalty. Amen. Jesus calls it
[41:10] the crown of life. The one crown is for
[41:12] those who have striven. The other is for
[41:14] those who have given.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Both crowns are incorruptible. Amen.
[41:18] That's the that's the crown we're
[41:19] looking for. And not not even to gain a
[41:21] crown. Amen.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; But that the Lord Jesus is the one who
[41:24] gives it. Amen. and we'll be with him.
[41:26] Amen.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. He
[41:29] I'd give my crown to him. Amen. He He's
[41:32] the one that that deserves it. Amen.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's just It's only by
[41:35] his grace that we overcame it all. Amen.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Both crowns are incorruptible.
[41:41] They will not perish. The winners of the
[41:43] worldly race of life will soon lose the
[41:46] joy of the plot of the world. Their
[41:48] glory will fail. But those who give
[41:50] their lives for God, either by daily
[41:52] striving, Amen. or shedding their blood
[41:55] as the crowning sacrifice of their lives
[41:58] will be given the crown of life. Praise
[42:00] the Lord. Then watch what he says here.
[42:02] Amen. This is this is a main point here.
[42:05] I have this highlighted. All too little
[42:08] time is spent on laboring for the
[42:10] eternal rewards of God. Amen. Too little
[42:13] time we spend gaining the eternal
[42:15] things. Amen.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; And maybe sometimes we sometimes it's
[42:20] hard to balance. Amen. Like when we
[42:22] think of work and church. Amen. Um, it's
[42:25] necessary to work,
[42:27] &gt;&gt; but it is more necessary to be in
[42:28] church. Amen.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Not that it's not necessary to work, but
[42:32] if you sometimes it's needful, sometimes
[42:35] um our jobs just um once in a while
[42:37] maybe there's a way a reason that out of
[42:39] our control we can't make it to church,
[42:41] you know. But if if uh I hope it's okay
[42:44] to say this, if your job keeps you out
[42:46] of every church service every week,
[42:48] that's not the job the Lord has for you.
[42:50] Amen. Amen.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Because God's will is for you to be
[42:53] assembled together and not forsake the
[42:54] assembling of yourselves together. Amen.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; So if you're if it's between your job
[43:00] and church, Amen. It's time to find
[43:01] another job. Amen.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope that's all right to say,
[43:04] brother.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; But um there's I I know a brother that's
[43:08] that's going through a situation similar
[43:09] to that right now. Amen. That he was
[43:12] praying um he had a job out of
[43:14] necessity. It was it was the job he had
[43:16] at the time to provide for his family.
[43:17] and um and he he uh he was praying. He
[43:21] said, "Lord, I' I'd really like to make
[43:23] it to church. I don't like missing
[43:25] church." So, he was praying about it.
[43:27] And he actually lost that job. And um
[43:30] and it was a rough time for him, but now
[43:33] um the Lord has provided him another job
[43:35] that is um his uh he testified that it's
[43:38] all that they were looking for. Amen.
[43:40] That that he can still make to the
[43:41] church, still provide for his family.
[43:43] Amen. Praise the Lord. So, so if you
[43:45] commit it to the Lord, it'll be a trial
[43:47] going in between, you know, when you
[43:49] don't have the job. Amen. That that's
[43:51] that's the trial. Amen. But that's where
[43:53] trusting the Lord comes in. Amen.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; And knowing in your heart that what
[43:58] you're seeking is to be in the house of
[44:00] the Lord. Amen. That is good and right
[44:02] in the eyes of the Lord. That is that is
[44:04] what he wants you to seek. Amen.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; To to to keep his words, to do what he
[44:08] said. Amen. To to seek his word.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Um, all too little time
[44:15] is spent on laboring for the for the
[44:17] eternal rewards of God. The recompense
[44:20] of God is too lightly esteemed. My that
[44:24] is how true that is. Amen.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; If we believe in the reality of the
[44:28] resurrection of the body and an eternal
[44:30] kingdom of substance, then we ought to
[44:32] lay up in heaven those good treasures
[44:34] that are available to faithful saints.
[44:36] Amen. Lord, let me be found a faithful
[44:39] saint. Amen.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to be faithful to
[44:41] Jesus. Amen. That's that's worth
[44:43] laboring for. Amen.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; That is worth it. That's worth my life.
[44:47] Amen.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; And uh the he says the eternal rewards
[44:52] of God. Amen. Um again, the the things
[44:55] that don't pass away, righteousness.
[44:57] Amen. Peace, uh joy, the eternal life,
[45:02] escaping eternal separation from God.
[45:04] Amen.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Eternal separation from love and all all
[45:07] good things. Amen. escaping that and and
[45:10] and gaining everlasting peace, amen, in
[45:12] life.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the eternal rewards of God.
[45:15] Amen. To those that love him and and
[45:17] overcome and keep his commandments.
[45:19] Amen. Praise the Lord. That's the things
[45:21] we ought to seek after, brothers and
[45:23] sisters.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in in Luke the 12th chapter,
[45:27] uh Jesus says here
[45:33] starting at verse 15. And he said unto
[45:36] them, "Take heed and beware of
[45:38] covetousness." And what's covetousness?
[45:41] We know one of the commandments is thou
[45:42] shalt not covet.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Um thy neighbor's possessions or his
[45:47] wife. Um but covetousness is wanting
[45:50] something that belongs to something
[45:52] else. In other words, it's another form
[45:53] of lusting. It's it's it's lust.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Um now there's there's a good form of
[45:58] coveting. Is that right? Covet covet the
[46:00] best gifts. Amen. Desire the best gifts.
[46:02] Amen. But this, but beware of
[46:04] covetousness, for a man's life
[46:07] consisteth not in the abundance of the
[46:09] things which he possesseth.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that's what the prosperity
[46:13] gospel, the false one, teaches. Amen.
[46:15] That your life does consist of the
[46:17] abundance of things you possess.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Right? Is that right? Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; And he spoke a parable unto them,
[46:23] saying, "The ground of a certain rich
[46:24] man brought forth plentifully.
[46:27] And he thought within himself, saying,
[46:29] "What shall I do, because I have no room
[46:31] where to bestow my fruits?" And and he
[46:33] said, "This will I do. I will pull down
[46:35] my barns and build greater, and there I
[46:37] will bestow all my fruits and my goods."
[46:40] Uh, and I will say to my soul, soul,
[46:42] thou hast much goods laid up for many
[46:44] years. Uh, take thine ease, eat, drink,
[46:46] and be merry. Amen. He had everything,
[46:48] everything he wanted. It was taken care
[46:50] of. He now all he had to do was relax
[46:52] and enjoy it. Amen. And um or so he
[46:56] thought. Amen. So he he he just was
[46:58] going to eat and drink and be merry. Uh
[47:00] but God said unto him. Amen. Verse 20.
[47:04] Thou fool
[47:06] this night thy soul shall be required of
[47:09] thee. Amen. Then whose shall these
[47:12] things be which thou hast provided?
[47:14] Uhoh. He he forgot to worry about his
[47:16] soul. Amen.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; He was so busy gathering into his barns
[47:20] and all his riches. He said, "Ah, it's
[47:22] all it's all taken care of now. we can
[47:24] relax and and sit sit back and and watch
[47:26] the game and and uh and not worry about
[47:29] anything. Amen. It's all taken care of.
[47:31] But he forgot the main thing. Amen. That
[47:34] was his soul. Amen.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; God called him a fool because he forsook
[47:38] the main thing, eternal life and and
[47:41] gained worldly pleasure pleasures
[47:43] instead. Amen.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. He forsook his own mercy. Amen.
[47:47] Because he observed lying vanities.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:52] So is he that layeth up treasure for
[47:54] himself and is not rich toward God.
[47:57] Amen. That's the riches we're looking
[47:59] for. To be rich toward God. Amen. To buy
[48:02] of him gold tried in the fire. Amen.
[48:04] That fadeth not away. Amen. Praise God.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; And he said to his disciples, therefore
[48:09] I say unto you, take no thought for your
[48:11] life what you shall eat, neither for the
[48:14] body what you shall put on. uh don't
[48:17] worry if you have the uh silk suit and
[48:19] and um and and and and the best name
[48:22] brand shoes and and uh you know he said
[48:25] take no thought for any of that. He said
[48:28] the life is more than meat and the body
[48:30] is more than raignment. Amen. Consider
[48:32] the ravens for they neither sow nor reap
[48:35] uh which neither have storehouses nor
[48:37] barn and God feedth them. How much more
[48:40] are ye better than the fowls? Amen.
[48:43] And which of you
[48:46] um
[48:48] excuse me, consider the ravens, for they
[48:50] neither sow, neither uh nor reap. Sorry,
[48:52] I lost my place there. Um which neither
[48:54] have storehouse nor barn, and God feedth
[48:56] them. How much more are ye better than
[48:58] the fowls? Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; And which of you There we are. And which
[49:02] of you with taking thought can add to
[49:05] his stature one cubit? Amen. Can you are
[49:09] you able to by by thinking by mind over
[49:13] matter? Amen. Make yourself able enough
[49:15] to overcome uh every struggle. Amen. Or
[49:19] can you just
[49:21] &gt;&gt; uh manifest enough by meditation riches
[49:24] into your bank account? No, you you
[49:26] can't do it. Amen. That's beyond your
[49:28] power. So if you don't have power over
[49:30] it, Jesus said, um, if you then be not
[49:34] able to do that which is least, I mean
[49:36] to God that's a light thing, but you
[49:38] don't have power to do that in yourself.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Why take ye thought for the rest? Amen.
[49:43] As if you can do something about it
[49:46] yourself. Amen. But consider the liies,
[49:49] how they grow. They toil not, they spin
[49:51] not. And yet I say unto you that Solomon
[49:54] in all his glory was not arrayed like
[49:55] one of these. If then God so clothed the
[49:59] grass which today uh is today in the
[50:02] field and tomorrow is cast into the
[50:04] oven, how much more will he clothe you,
[50:05] oh ye of little faith.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; And seek not uh seek not ye what you
[50:12] shall eat or what you shall drink.
[50:14] Neither be ye of a doubtful mind. Amen.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; That's Lord help me. Sometimes I have
[50:19] such feel like I have such little faith
[50:21] when I when something maybe
[50:24] &gt;&gt; maybe a real example. Sometimes if
[50:26] something goes wrong in the car. Amen.
[50:28] Right now my thank the Lord we got here
[50:30] safe. I trust we'll get home safe. But
[50:32] your car just sometimes starts making
[50:34] noises. You don't know what it is.
[50:35] You're like, "Oh no."
[50:36] &gt;&gt; You know, as soon as you hear it, you
[50:38] have a doubtful mind. Is that right?
[50:40] &gt;&gt; But we ought to trust the Lord. I mean,
[50:42] if he provided the vehicle for you, then
[50:44] uh then he'll take care of you.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; If I I trust if the Lord didn't want me
[50:49] to be here, he would have maybe the car
[50:50] would have broke down. We wouldn't be
[50:51] here. But he did want us to be here. So
[50:54] he he uh he allowed the car to keep
[50:55] going. Amen.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. But um he says, "Neither be of a
[51:02] doubtful mind." Amen. For all these
[51:04] things do the nations of the world seek
[51:06] after, and your father knoweth that ye
[51:09] have need of these things. Amen. Like we
[51:11] were saying earlier, don't think that he
[51:13] doesn't see your afflictions. Amen. You
[51:16] think he doesn't know that he he forgot
[51:19] to to check in on you and and he doesn't
[51:22] realize that the bills are coming up and
[51:24] and you're you're a few dollars short,
[51:27] you know,
[51:28] &gt;&gt; and you think he doesn't see that that
[51:30] you you maybe you don't know how there's
[51:32] going to be bread on the table. Amen.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; But you don't think that he doesn't
[51:35] know. Amen. He sees he sees all of that.
[51:38] Amen.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; He does know. And not only does he know,
[51:42] he cares about it. Amen.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:45] Amen. He cares. Praise God. Do you care?
[51:48] Amen.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Um your your father knoweth you have
[51:51] need of these things, but rather seek ye
[51:53] the kingdom of God, and all these things
[51:56] shall be added unto you. Now, at first,
[51:58] when somebody hears that, maybe for the
[52:00] first time, they would think that that's
[52:02] crazy. See, why would I seek something I
[52:05] can't see and forsake things I can see
[52:09] that I need? You know, I I need clothes.
[52:11] I need food. You know, that's that's
[52:13] crazy. I can't do that. But remember,
[52:15] Jesus set the example himself of how to
[52:17] do that. Amen. He He made himself poor.
[52:22] Amen. Lowly, having not even a place to
[52:24] lay his head, you know, and and having
[52:27] not didn't even I'm sure didn't even
[52:29] have a bank account, you know, you know,
[52:32] didn't probably didn't own his own. He
[52:34] owned the cattle on a thousand hills.
[52:36] Amen. But the man Jesus, the flesh,
[52:38] Jesus, didn't have a scent to his name.
[52:40] Amen.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; He was poor so that he could come to the
[52:43] poor. Amen.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Is that right? But he was he was an
[52:46] example of that. So he wasn't just
[52:47] saying it um that that you do this and
[52:51] uh and um I don't need to, but you need
[52:53] to, you know, but he came to fulfill all
[52:55] righteousness, right? Um
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; to to show us our example, our example.
[53:01] Amen. Of of how we ought to be in
[53:04] spirit. Amen.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want his mind to be in us.
[53:08] Amen. His the attitude of Christ. Amen.
[53:10] And his humility to be in us. Amen. how
[53:12] much more humble we should be.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. But rather, seek ye the kingdom of
[53:19] God, and all these things shall be added
[53:20] unto you.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean all the all the sports
[53:25] cars you want will be added unto you.
[53:27] All these things Jesus was talking
[53:28] about. The body is more than raignment.
[53:30] The the the the things the necessities.
[53:33] Amen. These things will be added unto
[53:35] you. The um David said, "I have not seen
[53:38] the righteous forsaken, nor his seed
[53:40] begging for bread." Amen.
[53:43] that uh how he says that there I was
[53:45] thinking um he says but rather seek ye
[53:48] the the kingdom of God. I was thinking
[53:50] when I read that that of that game,
[53:53] there's a little game, you know, people
[53:54] play would you rather, you know, and
[53:55] they present different different uh
[53:57] questions here, you know, like would you
[53:59] rather get stung by a scorpion or or
[54:02] stung by a by 20 bees, you know,
[54:04] whatever. And uh just random things like
[54:06] that, just uh whatever. But I was
[54:09] thinking on a more serious level of
[54:11] that, would you rather seek the kingdom
[54:15] of God and gain the heavenly treasures
[54:18] or forsake all of that and seek earthly
[54:20] treasures which today are and tomorrow
[54:23] is nothing. Amen.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; It's it's the ultimate would you rather.
[54:27] Is that right?
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; But this one's not a game. Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; This one's not this one's not
[54:32] foolishness. Amen. This is serious. You
[54:34] must consider this, brothers and
[54:35] sisters. Amen.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; What What do you rather Amen.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is more needful? Praise God.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Seek the kingdom of God. Amen.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Fear not. Verse 32. What a promise this
[54:47] is. Amen. Fear not, little flock, for it
[54:49] is your father's good pleasure to give
[54:51] you the kingdom.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Sell that ye have and give alms. Provide
[54:55] yourselves bags which wax not old. A
[54:58] treasure in heaven that faileth not,
[54:59] where no thief approaches, neither moth
[55:02] corrupteth. Amen. That treasure is
[55:04] something no one can take away from you.
[55:06] Amen. Someone might break into your
[55:07] house and take your last dollar. Amen.
[55:09] But they they they can never break into
[55:11] heaven and take your name out of the
[55:12] book. Amen. Praise God. No one can take
[55:15] you out of his hand. Praise the Lord.
[55:17] Amen. That that that faileth not.
[55:19] Hallelujah. Amen. Neither moth
[55:21] corruptth. For where your heart is,
[55:23] verse 34, there will or for where your
[55:26] treasure is, excuse me, there will your
[55:27] heart be also.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't lay up your treasures down
[55:31] here, brothers and sisters. Amen. This
[55:33] is this is this isn't a solid investment
[55:35] down here. Amen. Because today it is,
[55:37] tomorrow it isn't. Amen.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Is that right? That reminds me of old
[55:41] song. Amen. Um I don't know how many of
[55:43] you here know him, but I know Brother
[55:44] Jesse knows Brother Jack back home. Um
[55:46] Brother Jack Hall, and he sings uh his
[55:49] song he's he's known for singing there
[55:51] is hold to God's unchanging hand. Amen.
[55:53] And uh that's the song I was thinking of
[55:55] when I was reading this that um uh covet
[55:59] not this world's vain riches that so
[56:01] rapidly decay but seek to gain the
[56:03] heavenly treasures for they will never
[56:05] pass away. Amen.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Hold to God's unchanging hand. Build
[56:08] your hopes on things eternal.
[56:09] Hallelujah.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Hold to God's unchanging hand. Praise
[56:12] God. They will never pass away.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Glory. Aren't you? We should be
[56:17] thankful, amen, that that we know that
[56:20] there's something eternal. Amen. We're
[56:22] not we're not just, oh man, I I I just
[56:24] hope it's true, you know, because
[56:26] everything he's said for all the all the
[56:29] years the earth has been here from
[56:31] creation till now, everything he said,
[56:33] he's done. Amen. He's kept his word.
[56:35] He's been faithful. Amen. He's he's
[56:37] never once lied. It's impossible for God
[56:39] to lie.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. His immutable promises. Praise the
[56:42] Lord. So So why would he lie about this?
[56:45] Amen.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "In my father's house are many
[56:47] mansions. If it weren't so, if it
[56:49] weren't so, I would have told you."
[56:50] Amen. That's right.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; He He told us the truth. Amen. To
[56:54] comfort our hearts.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "If uh then I I go to
[56:59] prepare that place for you." Amen. And
[57:01] if I go, I will also come again. Amen.
[57:03] That that where I am, there you may be
[57:05] also.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's the reward.
[57:08] Hallelujah.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Don't lay up your treasures down here,
[57:12] brothers and sisters. No, sir. Amen.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; It's a It's an investment. What are you
[57:17] investing in? Amen.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You're either investing
[57:20] in worldly goods or in heavenly goods.
[57:22] It's it's one or the other.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But but make the glorious
[57:27] decision. Amen.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Choose the correct path. Choose his way.
[57:30] Amen.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's my way." What a glorious
[57:33] decision thou made.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Praise God. For here we have no
[57:37] continuing city. Is that right? But we
[57:39] seek one to come. Amen.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; We we plainly declare that that we seek
[57:42] a country. Is that right?
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh I you know having no
[57:48] continuing city here it's for me myself
[57:52] um I'm a uh I tend to be a sentimental
[57:54] person you know and I I have a hard time
[57:57] throwing away notes and things people
[57:58] give me and and stuff and and it's hard
[58:01] sometimes for sentimental people not to
[58:03] get attached to things you know on in
[58:05] this world and uh but you know one day
[58:08] our our houses you know I I I have an
[58:11] attachment um just to to the house where
[58:14] I grew up and I was sad when we moved
[58:17] and you know and uh we were there for a
[58:19] long time. That was all my childhood
[58:21] memories were and and all that and we
[58:24] just get attached to things here and and
[58:25] brother Brandham tells this in his life
[58:27] story too how he would drive he would go
[58:29] and try to find that old cabin he grew
[58:30] up in and one day it just wasn't there
[58:32] anymore. It was knocked down and and
[58:34] there was something else they were
[58:35] building there and developing the area
[58:38] and but we don't want to get too
[58:40] attached to things here. It's hard, you
[58:42] know. We have memories. We have have
[58:44] have uh good things that, you know,
[58:48] hopefully we have good memories, you
[58:49] know,
[58:50] &gt;&gt; and people we love, uh things that we
[58:53] love, you know, and and we get attached.
[58:56] But here, brothers and sisters, we have
[58:58] no continuing city. These things are
[59:00] going to pass away and fail. But over
[59:02] there, there won't even be a a
[59:04] remembrance of it. It'll be the the good
[59:06] things that we think of in the past here
[59:09] won't even be worthy to compare with the
[59:11] good things over there. Amen. We'll be
[59:13] rejoicing so much we won't even the the
[59:15] old things will all be passed away.
[59:17] Amen.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And and that won't even
[59:20] end. It won't be a memory. It'll be all
[59:22] the time rejoicing, praising God.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's hard for sentimental
[59:29] people sometimes because we get we just
[59:31] get caught up, you know, oh man, I I
[59:32] miss this. I you know I I missed the old
[59:35] place, you know, things like that. And
[59:37] uh but don't caught don't get caught up
[59:38] in that, friends. Amen.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just we got to look
[59:41] ahead and and seek the heavenly
[59:43] treasures. Amen.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; We're we're this world is not my home.
[59:47] Amen. I'm just a passing through. My
[59:49] treasures are laid up somewhere beyond
[59:50] the blue. Amen.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Somewhere not here. Amen. And I'm glad
[59:54] it's not here. Amen. Because today it
[59:57] is, tomorrow it isn't. You know, houses
[59:59] can burn down. Um treasures can be
[1:00:01] stolen. Amen.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; But not that treasure. Amen. Praise the
[1:00:05] Lord. All right. Uh, brother Bham says
[1:00:07] this in things that are to be uh from
[1:00:10] 65. He says, "Now remember uh we think
[1:00:13] so much of this body uh we put so many
[1:00:17] clothes on it. We do so many things that
[1:00:18] unnecessary change after change after
[1:00:20] change all these things. And it's just
[1:00:23] everybody." And he says, "I don't care
[1:00:25] whether my coat matches my trousers. I I
[1:00:28] have a hard time. my wife or my
[1:00:30] daughter-in-law, someone have to tell me
[1:00:32] what kind of tie to wear with it. I
[1:00:34] don't care whether they match, though. I
[1:00:36] want my experience to match God's word.
[1:00:38] Amen.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's the thing because
[1:00:42] that's where I aim to live. Not down on
[1:00:44] the corner yonder with the Joneses, but
[1:00:46] yonder in glory where Jesus is. Praise
[1:00:48] the Lord. Gone to prepare us a place.
[1:00:50] Yes, we want that. Yes, sir. Keep from
[1:00:53] all this. Amen. this old earthly tabern
[1:00:56] tabernacle here. Forgive me if I'm
[1:00:58] speaking fast here. I'm just trying to
[1:00:59] get in. I feel bad last time. I I I went
[1:01:02] over two hours, I think, and I didn't
[1:01:04] even realize it. Forgive me. I We want
[1:01:06] the Lord to have his way, but we also
[1:01:08] need to use wisdom, you know. And um
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; it was good, brother.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Praise the Lord. Thank you,
[1:01:12] brother.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God. We just ultimately we just
[1:01:15] want the Lord to have his way. Amen. We
[1:01:17] don't want to put a time limit on God,
[1:01:19] but but we do want to be be wise and not
[1:01:22] wear out people, you know, and uh just
[1:01:24] get the point across. So, so uh praise
[1:01:26] the Lord. Anyways, um this old earthly
[1:01:29] tabernacle here, you know what it is?
[1:01:32] This body is like an old coat that you
[1:01:34] wear, a coat that you once wear,
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; but now
[1:01:41] you have one so much better
[1:01:43] you don't use it anymore. What do you
[1:01:45] do? You hang it in the closet, but
[1:01:47] you've got one better. You've got a
[1:01:49] better coat. It's more up to-date than
[1:01:51] the one you used to wear that's worn
[1:01:53] out. Thank the Lord there's going to be
[1:01:54] an up-to-date coat for us. Amen.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Not not the old one. Praise God.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Uh what it's it is that garment you are
[1:02:06] inside that there. That garment only
[1:02:08] done what? It bore your image. See? But
[1:02:11] you don't need it anymore. Now you've
[1:02:12] hung it up. It's a rag. Amen.
[1:02:15] And that's the way this whole body is.
[1:02:17] It bore uh it bore the image of the
[1:02:19] heavenly yet it is not you. You are on
[1:02:22] the inside of that body. You and the
[1:02:24] spirit of God is on the inside of that
[1:02:25] body. That's what makes the the outside
[1:02:27] come into subjections because the inside
[1:02:29] is pulling it. See bringing it in line
[1:02:31] with the word of God. Your inside
[1:02:33] yourself uh your being. This this body
[1:02:36] is just an old coat and someday what
[1:02:38] will you do with it? Um for you it's
[1:02:41] only in the garment for a while. That is
[1:02:43] like the earthly garment. This body,
[1:02:46] your real body, your real self self is
[1:02:48] on the inside of this old coat that you
[1:02:50] call William Brandham or Susie Jones,
[1:02:53] you know, or David Hawkins, you know, or
[1:02:55] whatever it is. See, someday it'll hang
[1:02:58] in the earthall of memory of you. You'll
[1:03:00] you'll put it out yondering the grave
[1:03:02] and somebody will put a tombstone up.
[1:03:04] Here lies Reverend so and so or John so
[1:03:06] and so. It'll lie there as a memorial of
[1:03:09] you. Um the people just seen you in
[1:03:11] this, right? and and and what you was
[1:03:14] your real you was on the inside of that.
[1:03:17] But the old coat itself just borne the
[1:03:20] image of the heavenly.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh people, have you made your
[1:03:24] reservation to change coats?" Amen.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Have you made reservations for heaven?
[1:03:28] Remember, you you must have
[1:03:30] reservations. You can't get in without
[1:03:32] them. Amen. Listen to that, brothers and
[1:03:34] sisters. You can't get in without that.
[1:03:35] Amen. He said, 'I'm talking to you in
[1:03:37] modern language now that you know if you
[1:03:39] go to the hotel, say, um, do you have
[1:03:42] reservations? Well, I'm sorry.
[1:03:44] Everything's filled up. You're out in
[1:03:45] the cold because you failed to make
[1:03:47] reservations. Amen.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; And if you come to the end of your
[1:03:50] life's journey, Amen. Listen to this. If
[1:03:52] you come to the end of your life's
[1:03:53] journey without reservations, there will
[1:03:56] be no one there to meet you. Amen.
[1:03:58] You'll have to step off into a dark
[1:04:00] eternity where there will be screaming
[1:04:01] and weeping and wailing and nashing of
[1:04:03] teeth. said you must you can't get into
[1:04:06] the city because you haven't got a
[1:04:07] reservation.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; You must have them to enter the city
[1:04:11] where Jesus has gone to prepare a place
[1:04:13] for you. Remember, you must have the
[1:04:15] reservations and the garment of
[1:04:17] salvation on. Amen.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; That's the main thing. Don't miss the
[1:04:20] main thing, brothers and sisters.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't we don't need
[1:04:24] reservations down here. Amen. But we're
[1:04:26] we want to be reserved there for when
[1:04:28] the time comes. Amen.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; That that we'll be accepted. Amen.
[1:04:33] Amen. And it's, you know, you can't
[1:04:35] afford not to have a reservation. Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; I I I I urge you. I trust we all here
[1:04:41] are are saved. You know, I I I pray we
[1:04:43] are. If not,
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; today is the day to do it. Amen.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; There's still while there's still blood.
[1:04:47] Amen. Still still a way made. Amen.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Today is the day. Amen.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; If you haven't made reservation, get it
[1:04:54] now. Amen.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; I would say space is limited, but time
[1:04:59] is limited. You know, usually that's how
[1:05:01] they're advertised. Reserve now before
[1:05:03] it runs out. But but time is limited
[1:05:05] here. Amen.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to get in before the
[1:05:09] coming of the Lord because after that
[1:05:11] you'll you'll seek for the Holy Ghost,
[1:05:12] it won't be available. Amen.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When the when the when
[1:05:16] the bride is gone, it's she's gone.
[1:05:19] Amen.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Make reservations, brothers and sisters.
[1:05:22] Amen. Make sure. Double check. Amen.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Ground your faith. Amen.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's it's it's worth
[1:05:30] all that we have. It's worth it. Amen.
[1:05:33] And Jesus said again here in Matthew 13,
[1:05:36] um a parable. He's talking here about
[1:05:39] the kingdom of heaven. He says, "The
[1:05:41] kingdom of heaven," verse 34, Matthew
[1:05:42] 13, he says, "Again, the kingdom of
[1:05:44] heaven is like unto a treasure hid in a
[1:05:46] field, the which when a man hath found,
[1:05:49] he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and
[1:05:51] sellth all that he hath, and buyth that
[1:05:54] field." Amen. everything he had. There
[1:05:56] was something in that field that was
[1:05:57] worth more than everything he possessed.
[1:05:59] Amen. He put it all behind him. Cast it
[1:06:01] away. Amen. He sold it. He said, "I
[1:06:04] would rather have this than this." Amen.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; That's how sad it is. Sometimes people
[1:06:10] will do the opposite. They'll trade
[1:06:12] They'll trade eternal life just to have
[1:06:14] a few days of pleasure here on the
[1:06:16] earth. Amen.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Seek to gain the heavenly
[1:06:18] treasures.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Again, the kingdom of heaven is
[1:06:21] like unto a merchant man seeking goodly
[1:06:23] pearls, who when he had found one pearl
[1:06:26] of great price, went and sold all he had
[1:06:28] and bought it. Amen. Praise God. It's It
[1:06:32] was worth more than the old things he
[1:06:34] had. Amen.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Forsaking all that is behind. Amen.
[1:06:39] Striving toward that that is before.
[1:06:41] Amen. Praise the Lord. In First Peter,
[1:06:43] the first chapter, we'll be winding down
[1:06:45] here by God's grace. 1 Peter uh chapter
[1:06:49] 1 and verse three
[1:06:51] uh it says, "Blessed be the God and
[1:06:53] father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
[1:06:55] according to his abundant mercy hath
[1:06:57] begotten us again, thank the Lord. Unto
[1:06:59] a lively hope by the resurrection of
[1:07:01] Jesus Christ from the dead, to an
[1:07:03] inheritance incorruptible, praise God,
[1:07:05] joint hes with Jesus, and undefiled and
[1:07:08] that fadeth not away." Praise God.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Our vehicles, they fade away. You get
[1:07:13] them in a it seems in a couple years
[1:07:15] they just quit on you, you know, and
[1:07:17] your your house fades away after a
[1:07:19] while. It needs repairs. It breaks down,
[1:07:21] you know, after a hundred years it might
[1:07:23] just rot away, you know, but but this
[1:07:26] inheritance, Amen. incorruptible,
[1:07:29] undefiled, which fadeth not away. Amen.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Reserved in heaven for you, a place
[1:07:35] prepared for you, brothers and sisters.
[1:07:36] Amen. who are kept by the power of God
[1:07:39] through faith unto salvation, ready to
[1:07:41] be revealed in the last time,
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; wherein you greatly rejoice. Amen.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; That though now for a season, if need
[1:07:48] be, you are in heaviness through
[1:07:50] manifold temptations. Amen.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; We we rejoice, but sometimes here the
[1:07:56] gold has to be tried in the fire. Right.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:00] Sometimes it it's he said if need be.
[1:08:02] Sometimes it's needful. Amen. Don't you
[1:08:04] think the Lord knows what you need?
[1:08:06] Amen.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; But sometimes it brings us heaviness,
[1:08:09] you know, um through manifold
[1:08:11] temptations. It's hard.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; It's a struggle. It's a labor. Amen. But
[1:08:16] the reward is worth it. Amen.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; The overcomers reward. Amen. It's worth
[1:08:20] it. Praise God.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes, you know, when
[1:08:25] people suddenly face a hard time or they
[1:08:28] they all of a sudden there's a trial or
[1:08:30] a temptation, they think, "Oh, what what
[1:08:33] did I do? What did I, you know, I made
[1:08:35] God angry at me, you know, oh, you know,
[1:08:38] what did I do? Did I look at somebody
[1:08:40] the wrong way? You know, what did I do
[1:08:42] to to that I lost my job? You know,
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; but maybe it's for God's glory. Amen.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's needful. Maybe it's if need
[1:08:50] be
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; that you go through manifold
[1:08:52] temptations. Amen.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I I'm thankful for the
[1:08:57] the the things the Lord brings us
[1:08:59] through. Amen. You you all heard my
[1:09:01] testimony. Amen. how the Lord sometimes
[1:09:03] he's got to get you in line. Amen. Get
[1:09:06] you into into shape. Amen. Praise the
[1:09:08] Lord. To to to take off the things that
[1:09:11] are not like him to to be molded into
[1:09:14] his image. Amen.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And you know, it brings us
[1:09:18] it ought to if we have faith, it bring
[1:09:20] us closer to him. Amen. Through it.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the goal. Amen. That's what
[1:09:25] he's trying to he's trying to attain in
[1:09:27] us to to draw us unto himself to to look
[1:09:30] at him. Amen. Look at the shepherd. Is
[1:09:32] that right?
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it might be for God's glory.
[1:09:36] Um like the you remember the blind man
[1:09:38] Jesus healed the the disciples asked him
[1:09:39] and said, "Lord, was this man born blind
[1:09:42] because he sinned or his parents?" You
[1:09:44] know, whose sin was it that caused him
[1:09:45] to be born blind? But Jesus told him, he
[1:09:48] said, "It wasn't because of a sin uh
[1:09:50] that they committed um not because this
[1:09:52] man sinned or his parents, but that the
[1:09:54] works of God might be manifested in
[1:09:56] him." Amen. that God would get the glory
[1:10:00] from it. Amen. It was it was an
[1:10:02] appointed thing for him. Praise God. Um
[1:10:06] and here I this I love this quote right
[1:10:09] here from the good shepherd of the sheep
[1:10:12] uh from 57,
[1:10:14] excuse me.
[1:10:19] He says, "And what a relief. What a
[1:10:22] lovely thing to know that when we are
[1:10:25] tucked into his blessed keeping, he
[1:10:27] becomes the door. There's nothing that
[1:10:29] could happen to you. No matter what it
[1:10:30] is, it'll all have to come by the
[1:10:32] shepherd. If it's sickness, it might be
[1:10:35] for your correction." Praise the Lord.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; It might be for a testimony against the
[1:10:40] enemy. It might be for the exaltation of
[1:10:42] Christ's name.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; But nothing can come to you except
[1:10:46] permits it to come. He's the door to the
[1:10:49] sheepfold. Amen. That's one of my
[1:10:52] favorite quotes right there. It's so
[1:10:54] personal to me because you've you've
[1:10:55] heard my testimony. I've seen that in my
[1:10:57] life. Amen. Praise the Lord. But nothing
[1:10:59] can come except he permits it. It might
[1:11:02] be for the exaltation of Christ's name.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; That uh and then going back to first
[1:11:08] Peter chapter uh one here verse 7 says
[1:11:11] that the trial of your faith being much
[1:11:14] more precious than that of gold that
[1:11:15] perisheth. Amen. Though it be tried with
[1:11:18] fire, might be found unto the praise and
[1:11:21] honor and glory at the appearing of
[1:11:23] Jesus Christ. Amen. That's what it's all
[1:11:25] for. Amen. The the appearing of Jesus
[1:11:28] Christ, the rapture. Amen. Pleasing our
[1:11:30] bridegroom. Amen. That we can be taken
[1:11:33] into the into the marriage. Amen. Praise
[1:11:35] God.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; If you you'd stand to your feet,
[1:11:37] brothers and sisters, we'll we'll close
[1:11:38] here. Um and whom having not seen,
[1:11:44] ye love. Yes.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Though now ye see him not, yet believing
[1:11:51] ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
[1:11:54] of glory.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Receiving the end of your faith.
[1:11:58] In other words, the manifestation of
[1:11:59] your faith, the uh the uh the end or the
[1:12:02] goal of your faith,
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; right? It's a means to an end. You say,
[1:12:06] you would say receiving the end of your
[1:12:08] faith, even salvation of your souls.
[1:12:11] Praise God. That shall that will be
[1:12:13] revealed in this last time. Amen.
[1:12:17] That's the main thing, brothers and
[1:12:19] sisters. Amen. The salvation of your
[1:12:20] souls. Lay hold on eternal life.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Seek to gain the heavenly treasures.
[1:12:24] They shall never pass away.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the main thing. Praise God.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Life. Eternal life. Escaping the eternal
[1:12:32] separation. Amen. That that that is the
[1:12:35] end of our faith. Praise God. There's
[1:12:38] the portion that awaits the overcomer.
[1:12:40] To him that overcometh. Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Don't you want to
[1:12:45] receive the Lord Jesus at the end? Amen.
[1:12:47] When he says, "Enter into the joys of
[1:12:49] the Lord." Amen. Prepared for you. Amen.
[1:12:52] That's our desire. Amen. The the things
[1:12:55] we suffer here and and experience here
[1:12:56] can't even be worthy
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; to be compared. Amen. To the glory that
[1:13:01] we shall see. Praise God.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; It's just I'm I'm so grateful that our
[1:13:07] reward isn't just a million dollars or,
[1:13:10] you know, or a billion dollars, a
[1:13:12] trillion, you know, it doesn't matter.
[1:13:13] I'm so glad it's not money that can just
[1:13:16] perish away. I'm so glad that's not
[1:13:19] that's not all we're striving for. Amen.
[1:13:21] But there's something eternal in the
[1:13:23] heavens. Amen. Prepared for you. There
[1:13:25] in my father's house are many mansions.
[1:13:27] Amen.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Hold to God's
[1:13:31] unchanging hand. Amen.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Build your hopes on things eternal.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Living with the Lord. Amen. The
[1:13:38] one who who loved me and gave himself
[1:13:40] for me. Amen. Let's bow our heads,
[1:13:42] brothers and sisters.
[1:13:46] Amen. If there's maybe there's
[1:13:48] struggles, you know, you're going
[1:13:50] through, you don't understand that maybe
[1:13:53] maybe it's something you've struggled
[1:13:54] with. Lord, why why can't I be rich? You
[1:13:57] know, how come other people seem to be
[1:13:59] blessed so easily and more than than I
[1:14:02] am? You know, how come they always just
[1:14:04] have to seem to be able to afford
[1:14:06] everything they they want and need? And
[1:14:08] maybe sometimes we get jealous and
[1:14:10] covetous maybe. But Lord, help us to to
[1:14:15] seek the heavenly treasures. Amen. To to
[1:14:18] be content in whatsoever state I am,
[1:14:20] therewith to be content, to be
[1:14:22] instructed, how to be abased, how to
[1:14:24] abound. Amen. How to be fruitful in the
[1:14:28] in the fruits of the spirit. Amen. The
[1:14:30] real riches.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you if you need that
[1:14:34] that help from the Lord, you can if you
[1:14:36] want, you can raise your hand to the
[1:14:37] Lord or if you want, you can just raise
[1:14:39] your heart to him. But if that's your
[1:14:40] desire, just make it known to him. Say,
[1:14:42] "Lord,
[1:14:44] this is something I I needed because
[1:14:46] I've been looking to material things.
[1:14:48] I've been wondering why I haven't been
[1:14:50] blessed more materially. I thought maybe
[1:14:52] I did something wrong." And sometimes he
[1:14:54] will do things to correct you. We know
[1:14:56] that. But remember, the clear sunny
[1:14:58] skies are not a sign of his approval.
[1:15:01] And neither are dark skies and cloudy
[1:15:02] skies a sign of his disapproval. Is that
[1:15:05] right? Amen. But we want to seek to
[1:15:07] please him and to gain the reward. Amen.
[1:15:10] The portion of the overcomer. Amen. The
[1:15:13] Lord is my portion, saith my soul.
[1:15:16] Therefore will I hope in him. Amen.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Father, Lord, we how we love you. Our
[1:15:24] portion, Lord. Our reward that we're
[1:15:26] looking forward to, Lord. We're we
[1:15:29] appreciate that you've promised us a
[1:15:31] crown, Lord.
[1:15:33] But really, we're looking forward to
[1:15:35] just being with you, Lord, living with
[1:15:36] you eternally, Lord. Crown or no crown,
[1:15:39] Lord. We which we desire your promise,
[1:15:42] Lord. We we desire you, Lord. We desire
[1:15:44] to please you to attain Christ.
[1:15:47] Lord, we desire the heavenly riches,
[1:15:50] Lord. I pray that you'd you'd awaken us,
[1:15:53] Father. If we've if we've got
[1:15:55] comfortable in this world, Lord, we know
[1:15:57] we're we're in the Leoysian age, Father.
[1:16:00] But help us to be living separate from
[1:16:03] that, looking unto Jesus, the author and
[1:16:06] the finish of our faith. Amen. As our
[1:16:08] example, Lord, we we know you didn't on
[1:16:11] earth here. You didn't live in mansions.
[1:16:13] You didn't you didn't uh you didn't have
[1:16:16] all wealth and prosperity after the the
[1:16:19] world's goods. But Lord, you gave us an
[1:16:22] example to please God.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; That gain isn't godliness, but godliness
[1:16:27] is gain. Amen.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; That's the the real wealth, the real
[1:16:31] treasures. Amen. Are not seen and
[1:16:33] handled with the hands here. But Lord,
[1:16:36] they are in heaven eternal in the
[1:16:38] heavens laid up for us. Lord, help us to
[1:16:41] seek that. Let us attain the portion
[1:16:43] reserved for faithful saints.
[1:16:46] Help us to be found faithful. Lord, help
[1:16:48] me to be found faithful, Lord.
[1:16:51] Father, I I pray that you'd help me
[1:16:53] sometimes. I I've struggled, Lord, with
[1:16:55] with wanting more material possessions,
[1:16:57] Lord, just for convenience sake. Or,
[1:17:00] Lord, just to have nice things. It's
[1:17:02] natural for the flesh to want that. But,
[1:17:03] Lord, let us put aside all the things
[1:17:06] that the flesh wants. Lord, we
[1:17:07] appreciate that which you give us, that
[1:17:09] which you allow us to have. We thank you
[1:17:11] for that. We pray you continue to
[1:17:12] provide our daily bread. Lord, we know
[1:17:14] you'll be faithful. But Lord, help us to
[1:17:17] look to eternal things. Father, I pray
[1:17:20] Lord if if there's anybody that hasn't
[1:17:24] yet made a reservation. Lord, I pray
[1:17:27] that this very day before the sun goes
[1:17:30] down, this very day while it is called
[1:17:31] today, Lord, that they would make a
[1:17:33] reservation in heaven, Lord, Father,
[1:17:36] that their name would be upon the book,
[1:17:39] Lord, that their soul would be right
[1:17:41] with you. that when their soul is
[1:17:43] required of them, not the riches, Lord,
[1:17:44] but when their soul is required of them,
[1:17:46] that they would be found rich toward God
[1:17:48] and the fruits of the spirit in faith
[1:17:51] and in believing. Amen. In pleasing God.
[1:17:55] Grant it, Lord, I pray. Help us to do
[1:17:57] this, Father. Help us to be rich toward
[1:18:00] God, abounding in good works, Lord. Not
[1:18:02] not that we're saved by works, but Lord,
[1:18:05] that men may see our good works and that
[1:18:06] you would be glorified. Father, help us.
[1:18:09] Teach us, Lord. Help us not to be uh
[1:18:13] attached to this world where we have no
[1:18:16] continuing city, but we seek a heavenly
[1:18:18] country whose builder and maker is God
[1:18:21] as the the seed of Abraham by faith.
[1:18:24] Amen. We declare plainly we seek a

[1:18:39] word. We pray now that it would help us
[1:18:41] and strengthen us and wake us up, Lord.

[1:18:47] your will. Help us to forsake all, to
[1:18:50] follow thee, Lord, to deny ourselves,
[1:18:52] take up our cross.
[1:18:55] Must Jesus bear the cross alone and all
[1:18:57] the world go free. No, there's a cross
[1:18:59] for everyone. Amen. And there's a cross

[1:19:03] bearing my cross, Lord. following you,
[1:19:06] Father, into death,

[1:19:15] to to to spiritual death. But Lord,

[1:19:24] believers. That's what we're looking to
