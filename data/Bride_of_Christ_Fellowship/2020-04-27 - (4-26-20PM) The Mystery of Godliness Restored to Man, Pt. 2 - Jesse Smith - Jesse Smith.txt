lord winning tonight would like to look at part two little Bible study on the mystery of godliness restored a man so I just want to briefly review for a moment here what we covered on Wednesday just real real quick we'll try to be real careful with the time here tonight by God's grace so this mystery is talked about in first Timothy 3:16 that's the location of the mystery Paul calls it a great mystery this is a great mystery and then brother Graham tells us it's the mystery of godliness being restored to man so how man how sinful man can become godly like God the Greek definition was loyal faithful devoted so we want to be like God we want to be faithful like God and Jesus says we can be therefore perfect as our Father which is in heaven is perfect and so God makes a way for us to come into godliness and we found that the way to get there is through slow steady growth just like a plant just like a baby Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man according to Luke chapter 2 so we saw a good example of that a perfect example and then we talked about the confusion with this mystery the confusion is how much human effort is required and is it is godliness even attainable and the answer is yes it isn't obtainable and the answer to how much human effort is all of it because it's based upon free more agency and so the proof of that is where Jesus gives the greatest commandment to love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and strength praise God and then love your neighbor as yourself and this is understood of course when you understand that all works are motivated by either worldly love or godly love and that's according to Jesus jesus said the condemnation has come because some men love darkness more than light so you either love light and gravitate toward light you do works because you love the light or you do works because you love darkness and based upon that choice God gives either person he God God gives each person either eternal life with him or eternal separation from him because if no if no effort is required that everybody would be saved and we know that's not the case humans have to decide they have to surrender their will they have to receive grace we know faith is a gift of God according to Ephesians chapter 2 verses 8 to 10 it is a gift of God but just like with any gift you have to receive it if someone tries to give you a gift and you turn it down well that's you lost out on that that's your loss that was your choice so it's the same with God God gives us these these great gifts he offers these great gifts and we got to be willing to accept them with a humble heart and of course when we see God's goodness we see as gifts makes us fall in love with the Lord and serve the Lord with all of our hearts so it cannot there can be no accusation to legalism because legalism adds to the word and everything about becoming like God is in the word because we're not to add or take away and the Bible says when you really love God the love of God is shed in your heart or so God gives you his love to help you obey the Word of God which is a tremendous gift from the Lord and we ended Wednesday by looking at Peter and Paul admonishing us to be holy to strive for all godliness Paul said seek for all godliness so all maturity and then Peter says knowing that fire is coming so Peter gives us a fiery warning knowing that fire is coming we need to be living in all holy conversation and godliness okay and now we like to look at some teaching on mature godliness because we know there's two kinds of godliness just like there's two kinds of Christians just like there's two kinds of feelings of the Holy Ghost ones in the spirit the other ones in the soul there's two kinds of faith right so there's two kinds of godliness so st. Paul he gives us five yeah st. Paul gives us five texts on godliness which is quite a few and Lord willing we'll look at each one of those tonight I got some faithful Bible readers over here some of my disciples over here which I'm thankful my arrows they're my arrows over here my children so I'm thankful just trying to keep him sharp you know read the word keep him singing thank God for all that they do for sweet little arrows it's one day Lord willing we'll shoot them out and they'll overcome they'll overcome by God's grace no hit God's target so let's look at the five texts that Paul uses now this is for mature godliness then let me see if we'll get and if we have time maybe we'll start on Peters godliness before you're born again which that begins the look into the statue of a perfect man so Lord willing we'll do that tonight and we'll try to just go like we did last week until 5:00 so let's get our Bibles ready got your Bibles and let's start with Titus chapter one so Lydia when we start with you Liddy's gonna retighten one and then Malachi first Timothy 2:1 so Titus 1:1 and first Timothy 2:1 acacia first Timothy 4:7 so Titus 1 1 first Timothy 2 1 and then first Timothy 4:7 so it's very it's very very fitting that Paul gives us the most teaching on godliness because he's the one that received the revelation from Jesus Christ that God was going to restore godliness to man great is the mystery of godliness and of course we see godliness through the life of Jesus Christ God slowly added more and more of his anointing more and more of his favor and of course Jesus Christ was the epitome of purity beauty holiness godliness anything desired was Jesus Christ our example praise God our Savior our high priest our all in all praise God so Lydia if just start with Titus 1 and we'll read verses 1 and 2 [Music] God that cannot lie promise amen so Paul of course is writing to Titus a faithful pastor and pause saying he's a servant according to the faith of God's elect and the acknowledging according to the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness okay so after means according to so the truth is according to godliness so the truth promotes godliness the Word of God promotes godliness so when you are living the truth and obeying the truth then you will live a godly life so there's only one path to godliness it's through the truth remember jesus said John 17 John 7 2000 17:17 sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth so it's acknowledging the truth which is according to godliness okay so let Mel Kai first Timothy 2 verses 1 2 & 3 made for all men for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty this is good praise God what a beautiful text Paul writes so Paul said it pleases God if we live a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness so we want to point that out all godliness is obtainable you know I was thinking right before we went online I was thinking about that all godliness is attainable I thought yeah that's right I said even the Old Testament you know as much godliness as was available in the Old Testament Moses had it he was living so godly that Pharaoh kicked him out of Egypt you know he was so obedient to the Holy Spirit and the ange of the Lord and brother Adam uses that you know why cry speak about Moses living so close to God in bromances we can live so close to God where a Satan doesn't know what to do with us and so that's one example there and obviously you know it's all based upon you know a person's dedication like it's possible for a young person to have all godliness because it's a it's a state of obedience and that's in Scripture remember Paul told Timothy he said let no man despise thy youth he said but be the example in faith and charity and love and all those spiritual attributes so Paul's telling Timothy you can be a you can be a Christian who walks in all godliness and so even in the context I want to just point out too when we live a life of godliness we pray for our leaders we should pray for the President the Vice President the Senators there were representatives and then our state governors especially during this time I mean my God's making it so clear we need to pray for these people and that pleases God I want to just show those two things it godliness is attainable within living godly and just praying for all men God sees that as such a godly life so we don't want to settle for a partial godliness right we don't want to setup for a partial so we know Paul says we can have all godliness so our whole lives can be you'll reverent to the Lord our whole lives can be loyal to the Lord our church is very blessed we have a very loyal church you know everybody's always there you know a lot of people livestream in here tonight and everybody's always there almost every Sunday such a loyalty and that's godly you know that's God's faithful to us right every morning Sun's up right it's hiding behind the clouds so we want to be faithful like God is faithful we want to be we want to be loyal we want to be obedient to the things of God it's obtainable so let's do it by God's grace let's continue to live that way all right next occations gonna read 1st timothy 4 7 and 8 for the third text on godliness [Music] [Music] heavy promise of the life that now is amen thank you sweetie what a beautiful text here from Paul my goodness it's so beautiful and remember this is a few just to shoot a few short verses after he defined the mystery of godliness and basically identified it for us we would not have known it so thank God he gave it to Paul but just a few verses after he talks about the mystery of godliness he explains how it's how its received and like we saw earlier how Jesus obtained a little bit at a time so Paul gives us another another clue and it's exercise I know everybody the church loves the exercise right yeah yeah my children knew they loved to run outside and exercise but Paul says spiritual exercise brings godliness so if you want to be healthy physically you got to exercise you want to be healthy spiritually you got to exercise your mind your mind on the things of God notice Paul heavily heavily rebukes exercising our minds in fiction okay because he says do not give yourself to profane and old wives fables so see see how important that is now Christian fiction will be okay because they teach you lessons like our kids like the Lamplighter series and there's other good fiction stories but Paul's saying profane so anything that has you know fornication murder you know abominations all those things anything you watched it's fiction or listen to be very very careful make sure it glorifies the Lord because people sometimes I say I want to break you know I need to just get my mind to break and so they listen to things they shouldn't be listening to or they'll watch things they shouldn't watch and Paul says don't give yourself to that because then you're you're you're not exercising you're getting weaker right you're getting spiritual atrophy I guess is the word to say right because if you don't use your muscles they get atrophy so they used to be strong but they get weaker so the same thing is with our mind if we don't watch the right things if we don't meditate on the right things we get weaker but Paul says spiritual exercise is the way to become godly beautiful scripture physical exercise prophets a little right that's why we don't give a whole lot of time to physical exercise and there's a little bit of a benefit but not too much so what's interesting is you know the way to exercise your mind is to do our memory verse right this sister Naomi gave us when you repeatedly think about good things true things honest things pure lovely virtuous and praiseworthy and then the Bible says you know you'll have the peace of God so that's how you set your affections on things above and then a final result is your spiritual transformation so if you want to be godly you got to exercise your mind you gotta work your mind to go to the right thing meditate on that's why I love writing books or writing scripts for YouTube videos I just love meditation want to meditate on it go over again and again and again that's spiritual exercise home by the way that video yesterday we released about William branham's absolute is doing really good we've already got like 36 comments on it and people are very thankful for it they're sharing it with people I've had two or three people tell me they're gonna share with people that either go to Jeffersonville or you know know people that are kind of caught up in the false doctrine so that you know that video like all the other ones are just it's just a product of meditating you know your mind on and exercising it on the things that are true and pure and right and holy and then the result is spiritual transformation godliness praise God because you accept God's truth right you love God's truth so you just meditate on it and you slowly grow into a more godly life because you're exercising yourself in it okay I'll read the next one because it's the longest maybe not we'll see here I understand it may be the longest so first Timothy 6 verses 3 to 12 yeah so I guess I wrote that this would this seemed to be the most the most thorough teaching on godliness which is interesting you know Paul identifies godliness in chapter 3 verse 16 hits on it in first Timothy chapter 4 which in case you just read and then now he goes in this huge portion all on godliness so our spiritual here should be really tuned in to this context right here so just in these nine or ten verses first Timothy six three to twelve Paul mentions godliness four times so you can see this is the theme that Paul is focusing on so here again he says the doctrine of Jesus Christ is according to godliness so it's after godliness and then he warns of false teachers who are saying that financial gain is a sign of godliness that's a tough lesson for us in America many times but just because people get more money doesn't mean they're living more godly and Paul even had to warn them you know in these days just because people are getting richer doesn't mean they're living more godly remember godliness is member t.j.s so a lot of times you know we don't see people's daily lives right people we just sometimes see people on Sunday or Wednesday and my oh they're getting more money or they tell they got some better clothes or they got a better car we don't see their daily lives but God is the one who sees our daily lives and we want to live in such a way where we're always living in a in a genuine state you know people see our genuine love our genuine devotion for God you want to live that way but a lot of people are saying oh you know if your godly you're gonna you're gonna be real blessed financially now there's a truth like you know with ties and offerings you know God promise you God God says prove me see if I won't do it if you pay tithes and offerings I'll open up the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing which you can't receive I found that to be true I know that with all my heart and we go through seasons of less and more but the you know the prosperity gospel was popular obviously in Paul's day too people said oh if you're godly then you gotta have a lot of money remember that's one reason why demas I remembered it this time right Dimas left Paul because he had cares for the the present world so Paul tells us to withdraw ourselves from anyone who's preaching the prosperity gospel you know God does not promise riches to the godly because true Christians are seeking spiritual prosperity right godliness peace love patience all those spiritual attributes you can buy you just you can't buy you can't hide it at home right you know you got a where you got a you gotta have the real treasure gonna have treasure in earthen vessels right so Paul lays this out this is the portion that has the love of money is the root of all evil and people that try to get rich they pierced themselves through with many sorrows so people hurt themselves just like Paul you know was told by Jesus why are you kicking against the pricks why are you hurting your own spiritual state because he was persecuting Christians well here the same thing happens with the sin of loving money you Pierce yourselves through like they're doing damage to themselves they're hurting themselves we don't want to hurt ourselves we want to help ourselves right you want to let God help us because we know he does all things for our good only always as we saw this morning and Deuteronomy everything God plans for us and commands us to do we'll always be for our good so I guess I'll just read this cuz it's a longer portion godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing in this world and a certain we can carry nothing out having Fugit food and raiment let us there with be content but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction in addition so it's like a drowning so you know so an addiction is kind of like a drowning right people drown their sorrows you know an alcohol or even drug addiction for the love of money is the root of all evil while which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows but Thou O man of God flee these things so can I say this o man of God o daughter of God if you're listening flee from those things don't don't run to people that are lovers of money he said fight the good fight of faith obviously loving money is gonna hurt your faith because you're gonna trust in the money more than you trust in God to fight the good fight he said lay a hold of eternal life whereunto thou art also called and as professed a good profession before many witnesses so see when you live godly you live godly in front of everybody and so everybody that comes in contact with you sees your godliness they see your holiness and so then on the on the day of judgement you know one way able to rise up and say oh this person to do that you know unless of course you didn't have a chance to apologize remember Jesus when we confess that Jesus puts everything under the blood and we're forgiven of all our transgressions so in other words always remember that you're fighting to obtain godliness it's going to be a fight against your sin sin Nate you're right your human will it's gonna be a fight against your human will and sin nature so one way you know you're growing in godliness is you are content with the things that you have and you're not always long for the things of the world alright so our fifth teaching the last one is in Paul's last letter so it's second Timothy 3:1 217 second Timothy 3:1 217 now of course we're not gonna read all this but I'll just read from my meditations here this was his final letter before he died as a martyr fulfilling his destiny you know what God called him to do that was his destiny to suffer great things for Christ's sake and so while he while he prophesized Paul he lists 18 sinful attributes that men will exhibit while having a form of godliness and these are in the days of perilous times which are dangerous spiritual conditions in the last days so let me read them again covetousness pride unthankfulness boastful and there's many more there's many more I didn't list all of them but then he said these striking words we need to catch this here he said they have a form of godliness and that means a shape of godliness the mere form or the mere outward image of something but not the inward image so see Satan Satan tricks the masses into having a hollow experience with God it's not a sin a real genuine solid experience with God because Paul calls it a form which is a hollow a hollow experience and he does this by training them to love sin rather than righteousness you know I just wrote some examples that people can see if you look at the life of the Pharisees they faithfully attended church on the Sabbath they faithfully paid their tithes and offerings right no doubt they spent a lot of time in their devotions they had their Mishnah which was a book about rabbi traditions and they they kept the tradition jesus said you made the traditions greater than the commandments of God and because of that you made the commandments of God a none effect so their own traditions they studied their own traditions more than the Word of God that's why we got to preach on Philippians right Ephesians Galatians and so I've got to preach on that so we know what Paul said so we don't make our own false idea what the gospel is but live the real apostolic doctrine and life so Jesus describes them they're beautiful on the outside but in word he says they're full of extortion excess hypocrisy and iniquity so modern day Pharisees are the same they have a form outwardly they might go to church pay their ties but inwardly they're not loyal as they should be they're not faithful and these are the same that I remember our coverage is pride unthankful unholy all those things that Paul mentioned this is a form of godliness so we don't want a hollow experience with God we don't want to be a hollow example we want to be a solid real example of Christianity and that what people see on the outside is really what we have on the inside and so remember Church this is what Paul tells us he said this is the last day so it specifically for our age a hollow godliness impulsive these preachers that are teaching this hollow godliness will wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived so this I think that's verse 13 second Timothy 3:13 because of this these trouble is troublesome dangerous spiritual times the preachers will create more and more deception and it makes the people Hollow they don't have any real substance right faith is a substance there it is phrase God they don't really have the faith faith cometh by hearing the word so the preachers will inject their own thoughts instead of preaching the Word of God and so true godliness of course that is living selflessly not in Pride as he said not in covetousness not wanting what other people have not in unthankfulness but thankfulness you you're genuinely thankful for all that God has done for you and you're on your way to godliness praise God so Paul says if you live in these things and you continue in the Holy Scriptures they'll make you wise unto salvation which is through faith in Christ Jesus amen beautiful the member church now let me just say this I wrote this on my notes from Wednesday this is all after you're born again right this the same before you're born again this is but after you're born again so after you're born again you know children we're gonna in Saints we're gonna have to battle to not long for the things of the world and love money we're have to crucify those things and find real godliness with contentment to be great gain okay so we'll go to the next thought here I got about twenty minutes so we'll try to we'll get into Peter steps to godliness and Booth begin the stature of a perfect man looks like some of this will be review but it's really good to go over it and see it again so now we'll move on to Peter steps to the initial godliness so the first godliness before you're born again I guess we could call the first godliness in the second godliness I guess we could do that and the same would be true right with baptism only gauche you have the first filling the spirit and then the second is filling the soul I guess you could say that now notice after after Christ anoints Paul to give us the main text on godliness after you're born again you know God anoints Peter to give us the main text on godliness before you're born again and then it's beautiful as you know Christ gives Peter all the steps to get to godliness this is what I just believe is so beautiful about the statue of a perfect man like you can know where you are with God at any time just like the Israel could say we're by Kadesh Barnea or we're by we're on Mount Sinai just like Israel could say that or we're on the east side of Jordan like the half tribe of manasseh right they they want to be on the east side of Jordan rather than entering in they could know exactly where they stood right I don't because they're on a map or they knew the map the geography well so can we know spiritually where we are with the Lord because God gives us the steps coming to godliness and then born again and then as we go into godliness the mature godliness so this is found of course in 2nd Peter 1 1 to 15 there's or I'm sure there's 8 paper there's eight portions of spiritual character that we must mature into and godliness is the sixth one right because you have faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness to godliness is the sixth attribute of Christian character we want to manifest now this was a new thought I didn't have until I wrote this book and meditated on it Jesus gave Peter both the keys to the kingdom and the steps for godliness I thought that was pretty awesome so you know the book of Acts shows how Peter took the keys of the kingdom and opened up the baptism of the Holy Ghost to Jews Samaritans and Gentiles and then here you know God gives Peter the steps to get to the kingdom right the steps to the kingdom so he had the keys to get them into the kingdom that the baptism Holy Ghost but he also had the steps on to get them to the kingdom so I thought that was a beautiful beautiful thought you know and design that's a beautiful design by Jesus Christ to give Peter both of those the steps to the keys and then the keys to get them in to the kingdom of God okay so these eight steps are God adding a portion or measure of His divine nature to each Christians spiritual character because Peter says that he says you are partaker of the divine nature so let's read that let's go to 2nd Peter chapter 1 Lydia can you get Romans 12:3 Alki feedings to eight so I'm gonna get second Peter chapter one that is gonna get Romans 12 Malachi is gonna get visions 2:8 so I want you to see this that to get to the first godliness the Lord has to give you a portion of his divine nature and you might say we might even say it's the daily bread right give us this day our daily bread a portion that we can take it and buy it we can grow up into something something greater in God's eyes okay so I'm gonna read verse 3 and 4 2nd Peter 1 3 and 4 according at his as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue so see there's another scripture that says we have no excuse why we can't get to godliness cuz he's given us all things that pertain to life and godliness verse 4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises how do we get there the promise of God believing the promise that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature praise God having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so you've escaped the corruption of the world so that means you've come to the incorruptible Word of God as Peter he also says that and then God gives us a promise and we must believe it right just like with Abraham God gave him a promise but then he got to go act on it so God does the same for us he promises his faith and virtue and knowledge and baptism Holy Ghost but then we have to accept it and then act on it so what is the statue from man it's God giving you and I a portion of his nature and his character that we can become more like Christ and one of the sixth one is godliness but then after you're born again broadly kindness charity then after that you're constantly growing and grace and knowledge and loyalty to the Lord's that you can obtain a fully surrendered life a life in all godliness paul says okay so Lidia Romans 12:3 another word another phrase we might call this divine nature is a measure so this is what Lidia is gonna read for us now spiritual measure alright so Paul tells us to be sober and humble because each of us have a measure not we don't have an immeasurable amount of faith we have a measurable Christ would have had access to that right immeasurable faith but Paul says be humble you've got a certain measure right we can see it you know amongst ourselves and other churches you know some people have a measure of maybe maybe like a gift of the maybe a gift of the holy spirit you know for miracles maybe speaking in tongues or prophecy or faith they have a certain measure of it it's given by God right so Paul's the one who gives this idea of God giving man a measure of his own character then we saw that with Jesus he grew in grace and knowledge of the Lord and so Peter gives us the list we know faith is the first character and then Malachi can you read that um seasons 2 8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God okay so all of these are gifts where we got to be willing to receive them so it's not legalism gotta be willing to receive them God's not gonna force them upon us we have to as you said love the things of God we have to look at the cross and see what Jesus Christ has done and fall in love with him and know that he's taking our sin and taking our shame our guilt and wants to save us and heal us and redeem us and so we've got to reject the world and Satan's plans to kill steal destroy and we got to accept Christ's plans the way the truth of the life praise God so faith is the first measure you get a measure of faith you get a portion or a part of God's divine nature faith now like the word Peter uses he uses the word add he said add to your faith virtue now this word add means to supply or furnish or to present that's what it means in the Greek so this is how a man receives God's divine nature he gets a God supplies him with faith then God supplies you with virtue and God supplies you with knowledge I think it's a beautiful illustration of God faithfully supplying us with the portion of his anointing that we need for that season and I remember that scripture just came to my mind God's not gonna give you a trial that you can't overcome right he's always gonna make a way out I'm gonna make a way of escape so God is guaranteed I'm always gonna give you a portion of my power and my blessings that you can overcome any trial not going to give you a trial that you just don't have enough have enough strength to overcome it right he's not gonna do that he's always only gonna allow us to be tested in an area where he knows we can overcome because he's not gonna set us up for failure he set us up for success for his cot because he loved us right we saw it earlier this morning because he loved us he gave us his word and it's always for our good always his commands are always gonna be for our good we can trust him with our lives praise God our souls our hope our future our past present future we can trust Jesus Christ with everything amen hallelujah so see God gives us a step of his I'm sorry a portion of his character for every step of our journey just like with Jesus Jesus increased in wisdom and stature right and in favor with God and man so God increased Jesus's character as he grew okay about 10 more minutes by God's grace let's go to Ephesians 4 acacia I'm gonna go with you Ephesians 4:8 now this is where we get the name the stature of a perfect man and we get the steps from Peter we get the name really from Paul so fusions 4:8 now because of times sake we're really familiar with this portion because we've been preaching on we just finished Ephesians so I think we'll go down to the main text I want to get to oh yeah sorry case you will read 12 and 13 I'll help you Feeny Andy so we want to look at 12 and 13 it's right after he talks about the fivefold ministry and remember those are God's dress where God hides behind the gift in the in the preachers life the preacher is just a coat as we saw last week that God puts on and he hides behind there when that man is anointed he's speaking God's Word that's God speaking to us so Keysha can you do 12 you know I'll do 13 you do 1213 amen there's five great things the fivefold ministry does I'll read those in just a minute but let's look at verse 13 till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man that means complete not sinless but perfect or complete unto the measure there it is again see measure the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so the church has to come into that you know we know the whole the whole predestinated bride of Jesus Christ once they're all saved born-again for though the ghosts that finished as the body of Christ that's what he's talking about here the fullness of the body of Christ that's right the fullness of Christ so see God uses these five gifts to impart these eight character qualities because here's the five things they do they perfect the preaching perfects the Saints it's for the work of the ministry it F eyes and that's that mean builds up edify means build up to build up the body of Christ it brings a unity of faith and knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man and it brings maturity and doctrinal stability so that's why preaching is so important even like this keeps me in the word keeps you in the word keeps us meditating on the things of God and preaching imparts all this character to our lives when we receive it and we say yes lord thank you lord I'm gonna act upon that I'm gonna let this I'm gonna meditate on that word let that word transform my mind that I'll obey the Word of God next time and every time praise God all right yeah cuz Jesus said to come in the unity and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man see the stature of a perfect man praise God unto the measure of the stature of Christ so remember Paul said you have a measure of faith so here you can see Peter says add this add this supply this God is gonna supply you with a measure with a portion of his divine character until you come into the completeness right I think that that you allow God to do in your life remember this is all through preaching because it's it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe that's 1st Corinthians 1:21 so you have to believe the preaching of God's Word and church is very comforting to know like how did Paul how did Peter how did James reach you know such godliness through preaching how can we get there through preaching praise God it doesn't it's not something new it's not gonna be well a new machine or something like that or a new pill it's the Gospels praise god it's the preaching of God's Word God's Word can't change is his method to make people godly was through preaching and so it'll always be through preaching praise God hallelujah thank you Lord I'm gonna be something different it's gonna be the same because faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God okay so I think we'll stop right there by God's grace let me get a pen here you know Church I tell you this this message that where the RAM calls the message he calls it the Bible message and that is nothing but the truth brother Rams message is the Bible truths restored the hearts of the children us the last believers turned back to the Apostolic fathers I'll tell you you know in studying the stature of a man and any doctrine brother Graham you know it was given by God it is so it is so comforting to find all these things in the word like even the word stature a perfect man like everything comes out of the word like this is a total Word message a Bible message and we are just so blessed to be able to have this I am you know I'm just often overwhelmed and I'm still amazed I get still amazed to see how scriptural this message really is that's why I love writing and meditating on it because something new will come off the pages and I'll Wow a measure of faith a measure of virtue of measure of knowledge it's scriptural we have you know God is supplying each one of these virtues or characters or character qualities as a portion of his divine nature for you and I how great is our God that's seen that praise God how great is our God singing with me [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause]
