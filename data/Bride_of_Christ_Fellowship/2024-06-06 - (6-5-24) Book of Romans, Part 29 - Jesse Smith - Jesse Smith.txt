they had a preacher uh from India come and preach in Ohio and he preached on the seven dimensions so I was listen to that I was blown away brother the way you might like this message it was really good so that makes me want to study on the seven dimensions so I'm going to Lord willing long as I have this time off here uh I like to study on the seven dimensions and preach that to you I've seen a lot of great things now of course I see things a few things a little differently um but just a powerful message and the reason I thought it was inspired because last week I was preaching on how our prayers reach into the holiest of holies how many remember that with Hebrews so Church think about that we're in this there's four dimensions right here right uh light time matter and then you know the invisible of the Waves you know the internet waves and yet we can go up to the seventh Dimension by Grace amen by the Holy Spirit like we are not kept out we're allowed in it's amazing like I was like wow that's right it clicked he didn't preach that but that's what was Quicken to me CU I just preached how we reach into the seventh Dimension our prayers go into to the seventh Dimension so it's amazing hallelujah we're not limited to just this atmosphere hallelujah hallelujah amen we can touch the heart of God hallelujah amen we can be a bride after the heart of the husband Jesus christes so just a real just wonderful message there if you'd like to copy that let me know I'll send you a link to it Romans 15 we'll just read verse one you've been standing a while thank you for your stance thank you for supporting the psalm service course let's just read verse one 1 2 3 we then that are strong ought to the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves let's add one more word of prayer father God thank you for tonight thank you for these songs of worship thank you for this place of worship I pray speak to the people here Lord through your word uh speak to the live streamers all those on archiv as well Lord should you Terry and father God just let the Holy Ghost have preeminence here today that's why we're here learn of you to know you Lord God to uh to draw Close to You Lord so Lord you would draw close to us we ask for all these blessings in Jesus Christ's name Saints said amen amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so we look at uh chapter 15 here I plan to get through all of chapter 15 tonight uh possible by God's grace um remember on Scofield's outline we are on the sixth part which is the Christian Life and service we've gone through part one the whole uh world is guilty before God uh the second part is we're justified by faith as the solution for our guilt uh and the third part was the Believers walk in the Holy Spirit uh the fourth part was the final result of the Gospel blessing in Romans 8 then we looked at Christian promises to Israel chapters 9- 11 and now we've been looking at Christian Life and Service uh chapters 12-1 15 chapter 16 is the outflow of Christian love and Paul's goodbyes uh that he writes it's it's amazing all these names that he names you know uh certain people that he would name think about that you know you're uh you if you were privileged to know Paul your name might get in that letter your name was in the Bible for all time what a what a blessing but even greater than that our names the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah written before the foundation of the world the Bible said chosen in Christ Hallelujah so verse uh yeah now chapter five I'm sorry chapter 15 covers two or three I'm sorry three topics Christ's example of service so we're looking at Christ's example hope for Jews and Gentiles because remember Paul was speaking to a church that was both Jew and Gentile they started out Jewish but then the Jews got kicked out they had some Gentiles but then the Gentiles multiplied while the Jews were gone cuz the Jews were kicked out of Rome but then the Jews came back yeah now you had like a clash between two different cultures right uh a gentile culture and a Jewish culture Paul had to bring the balance to everything aren't you glad he did amen it's such a blessing it helps us so much I was reading you know uh this is I'm sorry in my morning devotions and reading the Bible I've been copying my notes from Romans from my old Bible to my new Bible and I was just again blessed by all these beautiful uh scriptures in Romans remember brother said every time I go to F on the little blue I turn to Romans chapter 4 so if anybody gets depressed or defeated this week go to Romans 4 Hallelujah it'll bless you Hallelujah remember uh chapter 3 though the remember the blessedness that David describes blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin you know we we think oh maybe I'm not blessed or things haven't I I haven't been getting many bless lately well think about your Eternal blessings for a little bit Hallelujah that'll make you feel so happy it'll make you lay those burdens down hallelujah amen I was just blessed this week I'm like wow I have so much to be thankful for and when this happens this don't bother me at all you know like like I said we have these are these are minor things uh compared to things people go through these are very small in comparison I do wonder why happened six years later I do wonder that brother amen I do Wonder uh what I mean is maybe the plumber didn't do a good job the last time if he's a good plumber like Simon is a good plumber yeah that plumbing should last a long time but anyway Hallelujah God bless him amen so uh we look at those three Christ's example hope for Jew and Gentiles and the third part is Paul's Ministry and remember this is a quote I I uh I wanted to put up here I mean I had all these plans for that I was going to show all the slides and all the quotes because I had all this time to study and now I don't get to do it tonight so but I was going to show that quote brother said nothing else will pep up the church except the preaching of the word okay and he was talking about how uh he was talking about how he would see calves in the springtime they would go out and run into the fields and eat all the fresh plants and they and I've seen them too a few weeks ago I was seing them they they would run and they would like kick their heels you know they would jump up and kick their heels and uh they got all that energy brother said because they got all those vitamins that they eat and brother said that puts me that picture of calves jumping and eating he said that puts me in mind of some of these little old churches they got these big tall aspiring places you know with a $1,000 pipe organs on today be million dooll pip or yeah and plush seats and everything he said but they don't have nothing to eat right he said but you getting some old missions somewhere you know you might find a whole lot in there you know some spiritual vitamins he says God has got them there for you to help your spirit up to pep you up a little that's the preaching of the Gospel all those plants that calf would eat and make him jump that's what the preaching does to us amen he said if that won't pep up the church there's nothing that will because faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of God course that's Romans 10 other words I like wow that's Romans 10 like Romans right we keep getting Romans Romans all the time Hallelujah so we're thankful by God's grace now now chapter 15 verse1 now we'll get into the the teaching on these uh on these vers vers verse one we then that are strong ought to Bear the infirmity that means to lift to Bear to Bear means to lift so usually younger Christians or so forth uh they're not as strong to be able to Bear different subjects right or different doctrines and so forth but Paul says we ought to bear or lift the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves remember in context this is not talking about physical bit uh physical bearing right this is talking about spiritual bury yes spiritual Doctrine so remember in the previous chapter remember chapter 14 we listed these uh four things meat eating versus vegetarians right that's a burden you might have to carry right now not really in America right because most of us eat meat and and and vegetables right that doesn't really offend us but it offended the Roman Church right you had Jews probably that ate Less meat right Gentiles they probably ate anything that's just how they were raised the second church was holy days now that does impact us a little bit especially with Christmas and Easter right and Thanksgiving and some of these other other days that uh do impact us a little bit so if someone's weaker and they can't handle the fact that you maybe observe this day or don't OB observe this day that we ought to Bear the load that they carry and that means not please ourselves okay so if someone came up like let's say and said brother Jesse you know uh it offends me that you give your children presents on Christmas well then I guess what I would do I would just not mention it over the pulpit I would try and I try not to mention I I probably wouldn't sing any Christmas songs I'd say Amen don't sing Oh come let us adore here right that that's what it would look like for us if a person's so weak that they can't handle you know somebody's Liberty then Paul says be like Christ amen right bear their burden don't please yourself please the other person amen remember Church don't forget now this is important this is a book of Acts Church Hallelujah this is a book of Acts church this is Things book of Acts churches deal with Hallelujah like I told that to cam recently when I was when I preached out there in April I was telling him you know the book of Acts Church in in Corinth they struggle with suing each other right they struggle with uh uh fornication they struggle with false teachers they brought a lot of false teachers and Paul had to say listen I've got the resume I'm a real I'm a real Apostle he says you brought in the wrong preachers it's hurt you you know that's what the book of Acts Church struggles with right yeah third wine now I heard A good sermon on wine recently by brother Donnie Reagan and he I don't know if this is true but if it is it's it's really something it would change everything but he said there wine there's two kinds of wine in the Bible of course there's the grape juice and then there's the uh fermented wine right which would has content so brother Donnie I don't know if you ever heard this brother uh William he said brother Donnie said uh when Jesus multiplied the wine at Kana it was the grape juice now that would make more sense right because you have a wedding for seven days imagine feeding anyone for seven like a your whole guests for seven days right and we know God would never purposely get somebody drunk right that's an Abomination we preach through that drunkenness an Abomination so that's that would really change things right but then if you know if the Bible Paul told Timothy drink a little wine for your stomach sake no he notice he said a little just a little bit not a lot so uh now for us as I as I've always taught it you know I I just always thought you know the wine in the Bible had a little fermentation I didn't think it was grape juice and so what what I've said is that's why I'll never drink wine or alcohol out in public because I don't want to cause anybody to stumble I've never or I'm sorry I met a few people yes I met a few people in cows before I came to message and these we were all 21 we're all 22 you know we're all 20 years old and the preachers in our mega church down the road in aaran I've named it many times the preachers would drink alcohol and it caused some of these guys that were my age to get drunk and say well he did it so I can too brother even I wasn't the message brother William but I knew something was wrong with that in here cuz I had a preing predestinated spiritual seed inside of me Hallelujah I just knew that was wrong nobody could tell me any different so I never did what they did you know like that but uh you know that's uh that that's part of a Christian you never you give up your rights in order to please other people so you don't cause them to be weak or stumble it just shows Church you know there's always going to be stronger ones and weaker ones and we that are strong the Bible says we ought to which means we will we should yes it's your duty to lift somebody else's burden and strengthen them rather than discourage them or cause them to doubt your your your Christianity Hallelujah the next one the last one was eating meat sacrifice to Idols now that like I said that impacted Wendy one time uh it's never impacted us right we never uh I'm not sure how it impact us CU when Wendy talked about in Hong Kong they would actually have Idol set up like like demonic idols and they would U they would buy meat and then they would cook the meat and then they lay the meat before the idol and then they would pass it out the party so they would dedicate that meat and so I don't I don't think she was ever part of it but she saw it well in that's the case right then a Christian wouldn't eat that meat right because a younger Christian might look and say oh that was dedicated to Idols why are you eating that you're partaking with Devils what a real Christian knows is just meat that's right now a real Christian might rebuke that that Idol right there I rebuke you Satan you know you wouldn't have to really cuz you're you're on a higher plane than that as a Christian you're not afraid of demons you've got God on the inside greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world hallelujah amen right nobody can curse you I'm we're blessed amen you can't curse what God is blessed Hallelujah so we're not afraid of those things but you wouldn't want to just take it halfhazard and call somebody to stumble right and so remember the way you the way you uh bear the infirmities of the week is uh chapter 14:22 it says keep it between you and God alone so the lesson is if someone's going to stumble over something you do it by yourself with your family at home if there's any question just do it at home between you and God that's the way to be like Christ Hallelujah now verse two let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification edification means building up promote somebody's growth how can I help this person grow as a Christian amen the way you do that is you don't offend them yes right by the things that you allow right and then verse three for even Christ pleases not himself so all this goes back to Christ all of our interactions with the church members everybody in the church all of our interactions should be based upon Christ I should act like Christ around you you should act like Christ around me amen but Christ didn't please himself as it is written because Christ fulfilled the scripture it's from Psalm 69:9 the reproaches of them that reproach thee fell on me right so we're Christlike when we please others instead of ourselves and this means we should take reproach or criticism on us right can someone might criticize me for doing Christmas I don't do Santa Claus just the live streamers I don't do Santa Claus I don't do a Christmas tree but I don't think there's anything wrong with a tree as long as you don't worship the tree um but if someone got offended that I gave my kids presence then I uh in one way they'd be criticizing me right and hopefully they do it with a good spirit right hopefully they do it with kindness amen but even if not my Christian duty is to help them grow amen and if it's area if there's an area of question it's a area of Liberty or area question then I just give up my rights and I'll make them stronger right right now uh John Gil says what what how did Jesus fulfill Psalm 699 it says the Zeal of thine house that eat me up remember when he clean out the temple Jesus likes a clean church amen and the reproaches of them that reproach thee are Fallen upon me I like what John Gil says they they criticized Jesus they called him a glutton and a wine Biber but he wasn't right they called him a friend of publicans and siners he was Hallelujah they said he was a Samaritan and he had a devil he didn't they charged him with blasphemy and Sedition he didn't right when he was on the cross they mocked him reviled him they wagged their heads at him they ripped out his beard they spit in his face but he bore all of it patiently and look he reviled not again amen so let's applied to us if someone doesn't like how we do Christmas or if someone doesn't like then the thing to do is make sure we don't say anything negative to them Hallelujah that's a strong Christian how many can say Amen to that you don't say anything you just say Okay praise the Lord I'll bear your infirmity I'll bear your weakness and I'll help you be stronger hallelujah amen Jesus took all this reproach all this criticism on himself amen hallelujah he took the criticism of God on him Hallelujah because really they were criticizing God CU Jesus said I come from God and I go back to God hallelujah amen I my father are one he said my Doctrine is not mine I do what I hear from the father Hallelujah right cuz the reproaches that they put on God really fell on him true and so that's what happens sometimes you know God will allow us to be criticized and so what we do is we just put up with it and we we live a stronger Christian Life hallelujah amen we ought to Bear the infirmities of the weak or the younger in the faith Hallelujah now let's watch in the next few months if we got to do that Hallelujah you know there's a probably there's a reason we're preaching this right God has a time and season for everything hallelu but remember now here's what I share with somebody online a critical spirit finds nothing good about a person right there's a difference between a weak Christian and somebody criticizing you I get these all the time online Proverbs 17:20 he that hath a frower heart findeth no good yeah so somebody would look at you know Christmas and they wouldn't find any good in it like they they would say well do you pray more during Christmas which we do do we read the Bible more during Christmas yes we do Hallelujah do we go to church on Christmas or do script church we go to church on Christmas amen right we're we're not worshiping less we're worshiping more Hallelujah right but if somebody's critical they won't ask about any good that comes out of it yeah they'll just criticize because they got an evil spirit so that case is different than somebody that's just weak yeah they're just weak they're just young I don't understand I thought it was wrong right it's different right and so that's a good scripture just reminded me a few months ago I just want to share that with you again you know listen to how people talk to you listen to how the people uh you know what they say when they criticize you because it shows where they're at it shows if it's a critical spirit or just immaturity then you know how to deal with it right Romans 15:4 for whatsoever things were written a four time I love this were're written for our learning remember when I preached that little series there was a two-part series called learning from Jesus Remember that right last year I was so blessed by that so Paul says all these things you know about Jesus being reproached you know and bearing the affirm of the week all that was written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope amen look look how look how simple this is now remember learning is not an evil word Jesus said learn of me in Matthew 11 come unto me and we're going to read we're going to look at the Greek meanings of that in just a moment but this is speaking of spiritual learning not not Educational sful Learning right but actual learning from the holy spirit amen this is spiritual learning and it's so important if you don't get this learning you lose out on patience you miss the comfort of God we pray for people to be comforted like we're praying tonight but if we don't read the scripture we're going to miss out on that amen yes it's so important to learn and how do you learn it by reading the Old Testament right all the all the stories it teaches us patience amen it gives us Comfort praise God so that's why we must emphasize reading the scriptures preaching the scriptures if we want to get patient and if we want to be comforted in our trials amen hallelujah amen so important this is a book of Acts Church hallelujah amen Matthew 11:28 come unto me all you that labor that means tired or exhausted anybody tired or exhausted and or heavy laden which means loaded with a burden and I will give you rest so anyone that's tired and exhausted of trying to live right or you know just trying to live life Jesus said come to me amen now of course ultimately he's talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost but as mature Christians we know we get tired in our daily life and that's where we need to renew our minds hallelujah amen so that's that's why we many times on a Wednesday night we say Lord I'm coming to you renew my strength Hallelujah renew my heart renew my vision renew my mind amen he said take my yoke upon you remember yoke was was something that held two Ox together for work so Jesus said if you want to if you want to get rest come work with me amen and learn of me take my yoke and learn from me for I'm Meek which means gentle so I'm a gentle worker and I'm lowly I'm humble in my heart oh yes Lord and you shall find rest for your soul that's speaking of the baptism of the Holy ghosten for my yoke is easy which means virtuous virtue it's manageable my my my burden my work is manageable amen see look that is that awesome you can manage what God wants you to do every single day Hallelujah you know we think I don't have enough time I don't have strength no you can manage Hallelujah there your yoke to Christ Hallelujah my yoke is easy it's manageable I can manage this day it means Pleasant and my burden is light amen see God won't put too much on you that you can't handle that's 1 Corinthians 10:13 of course we're not going to read it but remember that so see Paul said learn from the scripture if you want to be patient and comforted Jesus said learn for me that's what that's Jesus is the word right in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God Hallelujah and this is another form of the word of God hallelujah I keep in these alerts that the sound is so loud in here so turn that notification off I try to turn it up back to Romans 15:5 now the god of patience and consolation Grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus Remember Two Worlds are colliding the Jewish world and the Gentile world and Paul said grant that you'll be on minded that you can all think the same thing Hallelujah that's right the stronger ones will sacrifice things for the weaker ones and you'll be Christlike you learn how to be patient with each other you learn how to be comforted when you when you feel discomforted when life throws you a curveball a mountain come that's why I told Brother ni I said speak to that mountain brother yes I don't care if the Rocky Mountains move or not but I need the mountains of my life to move hallah right I don't care if the Appalachian Mountains or whatever mountains I want the mountains I want the trials in my life to move by the word of God hallelujah God verse six that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ so Paul's saying You must be unified we want I want your worship to be unified that Jews and Gentiles no matter which background you come from holy days not holy days eating your diets like this my di like that I want you to all glorify Jesus Hallelujah with one voice amen amen so in other words Paul wanted strong Believers to please others rather than themselves and this mindset glorifies God right so the unity of the church glorifies God Amen and it's even like this you know kind of like uh I was mentioning with the prayer meetings it even like uh it's even submitting to what what I feel led to do right or like let's that's one example but let's look at another example we got three trustees what if what if our two trustees did something I didn't like what would I say I have to say Okay I'm going along with it now thankfully we had had to do that lately but it's a possibility like let's say at some point you know uh two trustees want to move and and I don't want to like move from this location well guess what I got to I got to I got to be unified right right or any like I can't hold a grudge against the two brothers right you know that's just two simple examples right amen of Christians bearing one another Hallelujah amen amen now thank God we've had very small decisions in our church but some Churches have big decisions it's like they got to vote a new pastor can you imagine that right I've seen I've seen that split churches I've seen it that's a big thing yeah what if you're the pastor you voted didn't get in or you when the new pastor comes up where you going to be think about that church this is Christianity we got to be like Christ Christ sacrifices his will for other people right brother man said he could have been married he could have he could have lived a longer life only live 33 years he could have he could have skipped the cross he could have now we know he wouldn't have cuz he was the word but see he sacrificed his desires he didn't want to drink of the cup that's why he said take this cup away from me if it's possible Hallelujah the flesh didn't want to go to the Cross but he didn't please himself he pleased us hallelujah example the Savior so this mindset this Unity glorifies God verse 7 wherefore receive ye one another as Christ also received us from the glory of God receive means to take as your companion how did Jesus take you like like as His companion Jesus saved you I this he pulled you up out of the world and then he says he walks along with you and then remember like Footprints in the Sand of time sometimes on the there's only one footprint there's not two that's because Jesus is carrying you through your hard trials that's a that's a real companion right there yes he carries you when you feel like you can't walk you feel like you can't go any further with God and Jesus picks you up that's a real savior amen that's a real God who cares amen a real companion so Paul said receive the church receive everybody as Christ received you he didn't say well no you got to do everything I want you got to do you got to do this right now you got to give this up right now that's not the Christ I serve Christ accepted me even when I was just Justified I wasn't even Sanctified he still loved me he still received me when I wasn't even Sanctified Hallelujah that's why we got to serve others Hallelujah accept others Christ easily forgave us saved us accepted us we ought to easily accept others convictions in these areas of Liberty meat eating holy days wine uh eating meat sacrific Idols holy holy days like like I said some of these other things we ought to easily receive one another now in the next verse notice Paul Paul now goes into this Jew and Gentile section and he quotes four scriptures from the Old Testament it's just beautiful I love that I love I love what Paul did Paul met with Jesus Remember Galatians 1 said Paul met with Jesus in Arabia and then he learned the gospel from Jesus Christ and he comes back and writes it Hallelujah so we have a written copy of the scripture and I love it Paul interprets the Old Testament and he interprets it for us for the New Testament so now we know what these Old Testament verses mean without Paul we wouldn't know hallelujah amen and without brother Brandon they wouldn't be restored hallelujah hallelujah they wouldn't be restored to us hallelujah Romans 158 now I say that Jesus Christ was the minister of circumcision that refers to Jews right circumcised Jews yeah Israel for the truth of God so Jesus remember remember he told them he said I don't go to the Gentiles I go to the lost sheep of the House of Israel remember that of course not a couple times he didn't minister to the Gentiles he said you got great faith Hallelujah I haven't seen such Faith like this even in all of Israel to confirm the promises made un the fathers verse 9 and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy so see we got a reason to glorify God today God's been merciful to us we didn't deserve his Mercy remember the Bible said in Ephesians we were far from the blood we are far from the covenants but by the blood of Christ we've come nigh to the Covenant oh and brother Paul texted me today he said I'm reading your book I thought Glory he took my book the thick one I'm talking I'm not talking about the little one I'm talking about the thick one he said oh he said I'm sorry if I preached the eight covenants different than you I said brother it's okay I said I was blessed I was just happy you got eight cuz I thought I was out of line and he and he I said you didn't do anything wrong brother just preach your conviction I said God will straighten everything out if I'm wrong God will straighten everything out he said that he said that sounds so beautiful he said just like brother R said we have no Creed but Christ no law but love no book but the Bible Hallelujah even though we might see things different we have the love of Jesus Christ so Paul says as it's written verse 9 for this cause I'll confess to thee among the Gentiles and sing of thy name he's actually citing psalm 1849 I had it all up here I had all ready to go it says therefore will I sing thanks unto thee Oh Lord among the Heathen so guess what we were in in the Old Testament we're called Heathen but now we're called beloved Hallelujah I used to be a heathen but now I'm beloved of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and sing praises unto thy name next one verse 10 and again so the second verse and again Rejoice ye Gentiles with with his people that's s Paul picking up Deuteronomy 32:43 Rejoice oh ye nations with his people hallelujah that's right so now we're supposed to Rejoice if we're going to Rejoice we better dance sometimes we better shout sometimes you better clap sometimes the Bible says Rejoice hallelujah hallelujah verse 11 and again third time he said praise the Lord all you Gentiles and L him all you people reciting Psalms 117 verse1 it says oh praise the Lord Jehovah capital l r d Jehovah the personal name of God oh praise the Lord all ye nations praise him all ye people hallelujah oh I love it and the fourth one and again Isaiah sayith verse 12 Romans 15:12 there should be a root of Jesse I love how my B my name's All Through the Bible I love that love how my name's connected to Jesus thank you Mom thanks Dad and he he that shall rise to reain over the Gentiles in him shall the Gentiles trust Paul's quoting Isaiah 11:10 and in that day there shall be a root of Jessie which shall stand for an inside of the people it's like a flag to it shall the Gentiles seek remember that's what the Bible says uh when the enemy comes in like a flood we just had another flood the spirit of God will raise up a standard a standard is a ring Play Hallelujah and the Bible said there'll be a root of Jesse and there'll be a ring place for the Gentiles hallelujah amen to it shall the Gentiles seek and a ring place is a place where we can fight the enemy together Hallelujah so as an army we're not spread out we're not divided but we've got a place where we gather we rally and say we're fighting from here we got to the full armor of God hallelujah and the Bible said to it shall the Gentiles seek that flag that rallying place and his rest shall be glorious that's the same rest we just read about Jesus said come unto me all you that are weary heavy laden I'll give you rest hallelujah amen I'll give you rest at the rallying place at the location of the flag the banner oh His Banner Over Us is love amen you beloving bride hallelujah it's Banner is love amen we're fighting a battle that's already been one hallelujah our Banner is the love of Jesus Christ and we rally there and that's what the Gentiles did by the grace of God we trust in Jesus Hallelujah his rest shall be glorious amen we'll trust in Jesus Christ amen I hope you're not trusting in your Merit tonight I hope you're trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ that's what the Bible said you got to trust in Jesus Hallelujah in him not in me not in your brother or your sister trust in Christ hallelujah amen verse 13 Romans 15:13 now the god of Hope fill you with all joy Joy that's why I was glad we saying about Joy before him cuz I was like oh yeah that's right that's in my notes hallelujah amen so Paul says God fill these juice and Gentiles that sometimes Clash some are weaker than others and they sometimes they're critical of others and sometimes they got differences in their daily life he said God fill them with all joy and peace in believing that ye may abound that word means overflow living in the Overflow Hallelujah that song I'm living in the Overflow that's what Paul wants us to do have joy and peace that overflows after other people oh my through the power of the Holy Ghost amen amen so see that is another form of power no doubt the nine gifts of the holy spirit are power the five preaching gifts are power but when you get an anointing of spirit of the Holy Spirit on you and you have joy and peace that overflows that's the power of God amen amen when you go out public and people notice you're joyful or happy I think it was nature we all week Go nature said you're the only one happy in here I think you said it or virtue said we are an AI everybody looked mean this on a Saturday like I was like well you know I trained myself to do that because I know it's a battlefield these are mean people in there I appreciate it I think it was nature or virtue they said brother Jesse you're the only one happy in here I said I ought to be I'm a Christian hallelujah amen and cuz I know people are watching me I always try to remember people are watching me I got my Jesus hat on you know people they're watching is what's he like what kind of church member what kind of church does he belong to I don't belong to a church necessarily I I belong to a body of Believers amen I belong to a body the body of Jesus Christ Hallelujah I don't belong to a church I belong to Christ Hallelujah so see the power of God comes on you as we sing worship as you repent as you pray power comes on you and then it overflows into the church amen and you're filled with all the joy and peace that you need amen see church we should desire to be full of joy and peace does that sound familiar didn't brother Jesse didn't you preach on that last chapter yes I did Romans 14:17 says the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but righteousness peace and joy I love it praise God so Paul uses two out of those same three attributes joy and peace well no one you got joy and peace the kingdom of God's inside you hallelujah amen a part of God a part of God is inside of us hallelujah God Amen the same one who sits on the throne right that that's a that's a spiritual body that's a the Bible calls it a Celestial body I'm kind of getting into my sermon on the seven dimensions that that's a Celestial body remember those bodies can wrestle the Angels wrestle in those celestial bodies those spiritual bodies kind of like this in one way they wrestle and God is you know in Christ in that body but his Spirit can be everywhere and he divides himself and the Eternal one puts a portion of Eternity in each one of us praise God hallelujah am amen and the god of Heaven is in us hallelujah so that's why we have joy and peace hallelujah amen and righteousness amen and don't forget that church the Bible said should overflow in Hope remember Romans chapter 4 the four steps to Hope tribulation Works what patience yes you got to have trials if you want to be patient patience which is steadfast waiting accomplishes or Works what experience which is character yes so trials bring you patience patience gives you character and character gives you hope amen which is a confident expectation chch that that's that's a that's a mature Christian a mature Christian is confident about their expectation that I'm going to heaven I've got the Holy Ghost Jesus is coming back from me I'm going in the Rapture praise God that's the hope of the church Hallelujah that's the the the the the four step of this maturity process I'm confident I'll be there Hallelujah because I've gone through trials and I've got patience and I've got experiences and now I got hope I've got an expectation that when the RS caught up yonder I'll be there amen gone through enough trials to know Hallelujah that he's with me he's giving me Grace Hallelujah he's loved me Hallelujah he's poured out his grace upon me Hallelujah am that's one thing I'll never doubt that God loves me Hallelujah well you know by his grace by his grace I could go through a joke trial I could go through other trials I hope by the grace of God I never would doubt his love for me now Paul switches gears now we gone through these two two topics right we just left Jew and Gentile now we go Paul the minister to the Gentiles Paul's Ministry Romans 15:14 and I myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye also are full of goodness filled with knowledge able also to admonish one another so Paul says you're full of all these good things this is quite a compliment Paul Paul's never even been there brother he hadn't even been there but from what he heard from the Saints he said you are full of goodness filled with knowledge you know things about the word word knowledge means understand you understand the gospel amen hallelujah and you're able to admonish which means warn or exort or encourage or urge one another when you urge people to do things and you you encourage them to do things that's admonish amen right so that's how we should be as Christians we're full of goodness we we understand things and we're urging other people to do things amen of course obey the word of God Amen right obey the word of God it's quite a compliment remember Romans 1:8 Paul says your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world what a testimony Hallelujah so somehow the the faith there was such goodness in that Roman Church there was such knowledge such admonishment going on that the whole Christian World heard about it and Paul heard about it too that's quite a testimony Hallelujah so here we see which attributes are highly commendable in the Christian book of Acts Church being good having knowledge encouraging others Paul's persuaded that they're full of these things verse 15 nevertheless Brethren I've written the more boldly unto you in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace of God that's given to me of God verse 16 that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles ministering the gospel of God remember gospel means what good news that the offering up of the Gentiles might be accepted being Sanctified by the Holy Ghost so Paul wrote boldly because he knew God chose him to go to the Gentiles remember that in the book of Acts when he got converted the Holy Ghost said uh Paul you're going to suffer many things for my name's sake but you're going to go to the Gentiles and turn them from Darkness to light amen you're going to take them from the power of Darkness to the power of God hallelujah this is why he could be bold with the church CU he said I know Jesus called me to do this and as your pastor sometimes I can be bold cuz I know God sent me to a Hallelujah I know I didn't ask to preach I didn't ask for all these things God called me to these things Hallelujah God ordained these things in my life like I told you two at least two people have said I knew you're going to preacher even you're going to be a preacher even before I preach one sermon they already saw the gift of God like I told that uh friend even when I went to my first uh uh my first uh interview to get my job there in a Christian woman was sitting there that goes to the chapel and she said as soon as you walked in we knew you're Christian you had a light over you praise God all I know is I just showered and shaved and got on my suit and tie and was being happy as possible hallelujah it's just the grace of God on your life it's just the Holy Ghost right it's just the Overflow amen we must had a good service that that day before Hallelujah it was already overflowing amen I I kept the we was keeping the victory by God's grace see we can be bold when we know what God's called us to do true if Jesus called me to it I'll be able to get through it Hallelujah I'll be able to do it if Jesus called me to do it Hallelujah that's a nice little r remember Paul knew I was called to make the church a chased virgin to Christ 2 Corinthians 11:2 that was not just for Corinth that was for the entire church remember as soon as you get saved all all your sins are forgiven you're a virgin to Christ amen hallelujah that old husband is dead now you can be married to Jesus Hallelujah no stains there's no mem to those former things the old things have passed away behold All Things become new hallelujah amen All Things become new you make all things new Hallelujah verse 16 that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles ministering the gospel of God that the offering of of the Gentiles might be acceptable being Sanctified by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah now I want to look at that word sanctification how many heard brother R Define it brother R always says it's a what a compound word right brother always says the word sanctify is a compound compound word mean to to clean out and set aside for service that sound familiar right now I don't know which uh lexicon he used mine doesn't say that but I'll take brother's word for it cuz it fits this the word Sanctified is hagazo I don't probably not saying that right it means to separate from profane things and dedicate to God to consecrate or to purify amen hallelujah right we all got things in our life we got to we got to separate it from other things so it doesn't get contaminated right especially in the fridge you know or other places you got to set that aside even a gun right you got to set that aside the kids don't get into those things that's just a small example you got to set I got to set the gasoline way up there so the kids don't get into the gasoline they got to set up on the Shelf got to sanctify that got to set that aside that's what Paul said I'm a minister to the Gentiles to make you an acceptable offering to God Amen and you're Sanctified by the Holy Ghost amen so the preaching of the word reading the scripture amen being patient getting comfort all that will continually and it will constantly separate you from the things of the world to a holy life Hallelujah that's what I've seen that's why I love coming to church that's why Church never gets old God is sanctifying me he's making me different from my former life he's making me different from the world and I'm a I'm an offering that's Sanctified by the Holy Ghost hallelujah our lives are an offering under the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen that's what the Bible says I'm continually being separated more and more unto the service of God amen amen amen you know I can't do some of those things I used to do I can't go to some of those places I used to go Hallelujah right there just certain things I can't do because God has shown me he separated me to serve him amen things that are profane I separate myself from that right we all do that that's what Paul says Paul said I I ministered to you so you be Sanctified by the Holy Ghost away from the things of the world verse 17 I have Therefore whereof I may Glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God now I didn't know how to quite uh understand that so I looked it up and Albert Barnes preacher from the 1800s he said Paul says I have a cause of rejoicing that God has made me a minister to the Gentiles that's what that means when it says I may Glory Paul is saying I can Rejoice because Jesus has done things that pertain to God in my life amen other words I can Rejoice because God's used me right that's what we can do as well that's what you and I we can rejoice when God uses us hallelujah cuz we're not worthy to be used we never lived a perfect holy life right you know we're not holy like the Angels who never sinned we fall short of God's Glory Hallelujah but he still sanctifies us he cleans us up and he uses us amen and then we can Glory I just read through this week remember brother amen when we preached on it over there all the things Paul did Paul would consent unto Christians dying he said I took many people to prison two prisons he he tried to get people to blast you in the name of Jesus Christ and yet Paul says I can Rejoice cuz God is using me oh if God used Paul Church God will use you Hallelujah forget about your past confess your sins amen move on with God let the Holy Ghost sanctify you and then you can glory and what God does in our lives Hallelujah he just did some of the most awful things right he tried to blashe he tried to get people to blashe the name of Jesus the unforgivable sin and yet God could still use him amen oh don't you love Grace unmerited favor amen I didn't deserve this he just poured out his favor on me amen glory Verse 18 for I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not wrought by me to make the Gentiles obedient by word or deed now here we get into an interesting statement remember Paul's trying to share with them that Jesus called him to the to his ministry it wasn't somebody else Jesus called him so he said I won't talk about things other Preachers did I'm only talking about what I did he said I'm going to basically confine myself strictly to what I've done I do not uh lift up myself or connect myself to what Christ has done by other people now this is a good lesson for us we thank God for brother brandham but brother bram's off the scene now we got to have testimonies I like reading brother's testimonies I like uh hearing them but we got to have testimonies I think that's how this applies to us we we shouldn't Glory so much in what God did through brother brand we should thank God for that we should say God use me Hallelujah use my life help me to uh be a servant to you amen uh you me her testimonies as well praise God Paul said I'm not going to speak about what Christ did through other people to make the Gentiles obedient by word or deed I'm going to speak of what God did in my life and remember Church you're rewarded for your labor you get a reward now remember the foolish version the only reward they get is eternal life brother R tells us in the church age book right they have no other inheritance other than eternal life right but if we're filled with the Holy Ghost now we can earn rewards amen right because we're pressing on toward the High Calling amen amen hallelujah we're not settling just for justification we're pressing on to the deeper things of God Paul said all those who labor are rewarded for their labors if their labors stand the test of the fires of God that's in 1 Corinthians chapter 3 we're not going to read it because of time already been preaching 45 minutes I hard believe that verse 19 Paul said through Mighty signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of God so that from Jerusalem and round about unto I a lum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ amen so Paul said see I'm not going to talk about what others or what God did through other people because you know what God did through me that's right you've seen God use me Hallelujah he says I was called by God to make you obedient to make you Sanctified to make you an offering that's acceptable to God and God has done many signs and wonders Paul says in my life by the spirit of God and I fully preach the gospel of Christ amen so what is he telling them I'm God's Prophet amen right that's what he's saying it's undeniable Paul was God's Prophet Hallelujah verse 20 yay so have I strived to preach the gospel not where Christ was named lest I should build upon another man's Foundation Hallelujah now Paul says in in the in Corinthians everybody else Builds on his foundation yes see Paul knew he was called he was the minister to the Gentiles the church yes Jesus was Min I'm sorry Peter was Peter and Jesus ministered to the circumcision we saw that today but Paul said I I didn't when I minister to Gentiles I didn't build on anybody else's preaching I started my own Ministry that everybody else Gentiles would build it on mine I I love church I love when I preach something I love brother William I can look down and if I'm preaching something real high up here I'm real glad I can look down and say I got a nice Foundation my Foundation St Paul Hallelujah I got a pretty strong Foundation my foundation's not got any cracks in it hallelujah it's sealed to the day of redemption hallelujah amen hallelujah I got a firm foundation when I'm preaching out of Paul's gospel I got a firm place to stand Hallelujah cuz I am building on top of his foundation that's right he laid he's the wise master builder Hallelujah now we're right at the top of that pyramid We Believe now if not there could be another generation after us well then I'm we're close to the top we're really close to the top Hallelujah if we get changed the moment ween alive then we were the top but if not we'll be right towards the top somewhere at the top by God's grace that's where God ordained us verse 20 so or yay so have I strived to preach to gospel not where Christ is nam th I'm sorry I read that verse 21 but as it is written to whom he was not spoken of they shall see speaking of the Gentiles and they that have not heard shall understand so Paul knew I'm called to the Gentiles I'm going to preach where nobody else preached before I'll say like this church I'm thankful we're the first message Church in Aron so I'm not building on another person's foundation in we laid the foundation brother bang and I we can say we laid the foundation now you're laying it with me yes amen I'm thankful for that because there's there you know everybody has a a purpose right everybody has a time and season and purpose but I'm thankful and I said like this I'm thankful I don't got to correct somebody before me I don't have to correct their false doctrines I'm glad I can just lay in the pure word of God Amen in all these 18 Years everybody can see everybody can see the results of our preaching Hallelujah yes all these preachers last time Paul and Aaron came in they said you guys have a wonderful song service every preacher says that thank God Amen so what do we we got to protect that that's right we can't let it go to our heads we got to be humble with it praise Goden he said we love how you guys sing We love your worship we love that hallelujah amen amen see we're laying the foundation so if there is another generation then it have the right foundation to it then the next the next Pastor the next church here in in Aron can stand on the word of God hallelujah just like we're standing Hallelujah church I'm saying like this none of us are standing on seeking SS this evening if you are that's not cuz we preach false Doctrine it's because you left the word of God now none of you are I'm just saying you know for the live streamers if people are on sinking sand it's not because of what we're preaching we're preaching the word of God h and if the Holy Ghost wants to correct me I want to be correct hallelujah amen I'm not going to dodge questions like on the internet I'm not going to dodge those questions now they're wasting my time that's different but I believe what I preach I can back it up by the word of God hallelujah amen amen thankful that we preach where not another man was building but we come here and build a fresh Church hallelujah amen verse 22 Paul's plan to is it Rome for which cause also I've been much hindered from coming to you now look at that he tried to get them so see Church um there's going to be times we really want to do something and I want you to notice this by history Paul never made it to Rome as far as the historians know see Church there's going to be things in life you want to accomplish and you know you're getting hindered but God hasn't called you to it but you you have the confidence all things work together for good to them that love the Lord yes amen Paul had this desire I want to be with you I keep getting hindered all right you might have the desires I feel like doing this I really do that I got a desire but things just keep hindering you yeah and that happens to me all the time financially I like to do something I like to get a new table or something and a new couch those couches are 14 years old you know but soon as something soon as something you know soon as I feel like I can get it something comes up that's just a small example I'm talking about like you know you want to travel somewhere you want to visit a church or you want to visit your father mother overseas or something you know something big you know and something keeps hindering you something that means a lot it would have meant a lot for Paul to go to that church CU he'd heard about him all around the world but something kept hindering him verse 23 but now having no more place in these parts and having a great desire these how many years years to come unto you so this was something years I haven't waited just a few weeks this wasn't waiting a week this was waiting years I'm waiting years on this desire there's a lot of times church God makes us wait years for our desires right so Paul repeats his desire church this is a repeat remember in chapter one he said I long to be with you that I could impart some spiritual gift to you that's why I want to go down to Junction City that's why I want to keep pastoring here so I can impart some spiritual gift to you I can see God used any gift in my life that would be a help to you it would strengthen you right I want to see you strong I want to see you overcoming I I do too but that's the real desire of preacher they want to be used by God so the gift of God can go to work and it can be a benefit and people can be encouraged they can be admonished Hallelujah by the word of God hallelujah and he had this desire for many years I'd like to be there in person I've been asked since I started pastoring back in 2006 I've been asked we come to this country in Africa we come to this country and they asked me in uh Zimbabwe they asked me uh Zambia they've asked me to come to Australia I'm like I can't come to these places I don't have enough money first of all second of all I got these eight kids and I'm going to leave my wife alone with these eight kids but I have that desire and you know maybe someday I'll get this I don't know I told the brothers I told Brother a few weeks ago I said brother I'll come to Nigeria or whatever or whatever it was I said come there you only got to wait 20 more years Till I Retire that's all you got to wait I said but it'll go like that go like that now I'm not saying I'll go there but it's that idea where you desire something you long to do something you have to wait many years but eventually God will give you the answer in Paul's case it was no Paul you're not going there but you get to meet him and Glory Hallelujah all those Romans get to run you my precious brother my precious brother just like they random brother random Hallelujah if you would not have gone I wouldn't be here hallelujah if you would not have preached I would not have received it if you would not have sacrificed I wouldn't be here I'm here because God used you to make me an offering to Jesus Christ hallelujah amen verse 24 whensoever I take my journey to Spain I will come for you look he's already got his plans for I trust to see you my journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first I be somewhat filled with your test your company sorry but now I go into Jerusalem to minister under the Saints see his life was all about ministering I want to do this but I got to minister I got to serve other people first and his historians say it's uncertain whether he ever visited Rome or not there's no record of it that I found but it's clear Paul was led by the spirit of God to minister to people amen serve others verse 26 I'll just say it's a real it's a it's a joy to serve you just by preaching the word it's a joy to serve this church I'm so blessed to have a church like this I've heard other pastors talk about their churches we're I'm blessed to be the pastor of this church Hallelujah I'm blessed amen it's a joy to serve you by preaching the word verse 26 for it have pleased them of Macedonia and AI to make a certain in contribution for the poor Saints which are at Jerusalem now we're not going to turn there but if you haven't read this lately read it it's 2 Corinthians 8 and9 Paul talks about all the uh all the liberality or the excess money and food that these Corinthians had and they said you God loves a cheerful Giver Paul said I'm going around I'm collecting food and money for these now probably would have been money at this point right CU he had to do these big travels he said now the reason you guys got extra money is so you can give it to help these Saints out in Rome right right and Philippi and other places you know he would take these uh he would take these offerings he said it pleased them to make these contributions for the poor Saints and that's what that's what when Paul and Peter left and they shook hands they met think about those two prophets shaking hand God bless you serving the lord and prob saw Visions while they're shaking hands you know but their last word was remember the poor right that's the last thing you're going to tell me don't don't forget the poor people begging out there on the street right he didn't say remember Jesus Remember these Visions he said Remember the poor because when you do it to the least of these my brothers amen done it unto me Hallelujah that's why it's good to send contributions to the poor Saints Hallelujah remember God loves a cheerful giver and voluntar voluntarily giving remember he told them to bring this on the first first day of the week that's 1 Corinthians 16:1 so that's the day you bring your tithes and offerings and donations to the poor so that's how Paul set it up that's why we do it on Sunday right it could be Wednesday night I never passed a plate on Wednesday night our church is so SM um but that's where Paul set it up there verse 27 it hath pleased them verily and their debtors they are think about that debtors now this isn't of course a workspace ation but Paul's going to explain it here when somebody does something nice to you it it you should feel like I want to do something nice to them okay and we're we're going to explain that here for if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things they talking about the Jews the poor Jews their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things so Paul said the Jews got all this extra money and things I'm sorry the Gentiles got all this extra money but the the Jews are poor so he said because the Gentiles got the spiritual things from the Jews the Gentiles should give back the natural things to the Jews you gave me something I'm going to give you something back that's how we do in our church right you do something nice for me I do something nice for you Hallelujah that's what this is set up in the Bible it's a body it's a body ministry right amen so see there's nothing wrong with feel like oh I can't wait till their birthday I'm going to give them something back or I can't wait till Christmas or something you know I can't wait till they're need I like to help them out they're that's okay that's a Christian Spirit right there's nothing wrong with that because that's what happened here Paul was saying you guys got this extra you should help out those who were poor cuz really they blessed you right so you should be able to bless them back and this is the same way preachers Paul says this for uh tithes and offerings for for preachers in 1 Corinthians 9:11 if they Minister spiritual things to you he said then what is it that you Minister the natural things to the preacher you know that's just it's the same idea if somebody's blessing you you should bless them and I'm not asking for money tonight I'm just saying it's it's a principle in in the in the family of God that's what Mary Magdalene did Lord Jesus cast seven demons out and so Mary Magdalene said I'm going to give money into your ministry I'm going to file you around and give money in your ministry Hallelujah I'm going to minister to you because you ministered to me the Bible says the body of Christ edifies itself in love Ephesians 4:16 other words you love people because they've been good to you and you want to love them back hallelujah amen verse 28 pretty good chapter here huh everybody enjoying this chapter really good chapter brother Jess I know it is hallelujah when therefore I I performed this and have sealed to them this fruit in other words I've actually presented them that money they actually have that money I will come to you into Spain now of course he never did as far as what we understand and I am sure that when I come unto you I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ amen I know if I ever get there I've been longing all these years I know if I ever get there God's full blessing will be on my Ministry but as far as we know it didn't happen verse 30 now I beseech you that means to beg or call upon brethren for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake and For the Love of the spirit I read this a few weeks ago and you did pray for me and I did get the victory Hallelujah and the love of the spirit that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me so thank you for praying for me that night remember I asked you that I said I laid my hands or laid hands on my wife and said can you all lay your hands on me this is one time I needed your prayers Hallelujah just strive with me with your prayers just strive a little more give me a little extra prayer Hallelujah I appreciate that Paul said I beg you pray for me a little more please verse 31 that I may delivered from them that do not believe in Judea see I I don't want to die there pray for me that I don't get persecuted there and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the Saints pray that they'll accept this service right they won't reject it or they won't speak bad of it or they won't get angry verse 32 that they may come unto you with joy by the will of God and may with you be refreshed that means rest together amen yes amen verse 33 now the god of peace be with you all amen amen you see church it's okay to ask for people to pray for you when you're going through persecutions or trials Paul said pray strive please strive I need delivered and I want these people to accept the word of God strive for me other words say a few extra pray prayers please during your lunch break you just go off in the closet and pray there you know whatever whatever go go pray for me I need your prayers he asked for per fervent prayer so he be delivered from his persecutors let's stand to our feet musician can come here we surely enjoy the word of God don't we I love preaching through books of the Bible like this because you can see how it so easily applies to us right I love how the I can take all these things and you can see how that applies to our lives and this is a book of Acts church and I love the Simplicity Paul wants the book of Acts Church to be filled with goodness knowledge hallelujah amen overflowing with joy overflowing with peace Hallelujah overflowing with all these attributes Hallelujah Lord let's bow our hearts father God we thank you for the word of God here tonight Lord we've learned so much God and that's what you told us in this scripture Lord to learn from the scriptures that we might be patient and comforted Lord I'm thinking Lord there's times for years I've had desires I'm still waiting for those desires oh yes help me to be like Paul and just be patient Lord God let me look at people David waited 13 years till he was King Joseph waited 2 years in prison Hallelujah so many people waited years and decades till they got the blessing as we looked at Anna Anna waited decades till she saw the Lord's prist decades Lord we can take comfort from those scriptures Lord God my time will come my desire be fulfilled and even if it's not Lord You're Still worthy of Praise amen you must have something better for me in heaven oh it's like that story where brother told about the woman with two mights Jesus let her give her final two might brother Rand said it's because God had something something better for her Hallelujah God was going to do something great for her down the line yet she was dirt poor Lord you give us these desires on our hearts Lord God I've expressed many my desires before Lord father help me to keep waiting Lord and while I'm waiting Lord help me to Bear the infirmities of the weak Lord God help me to be like Christ each one of us Lord God would have one mind and Lord we'd strive together in prayer when we go through difficult times Lord God lord we have these group texts Lord and I just pray when someone's going through difficult times they'll send a text and say please drive with me in prayer would you just say a few extra prayers for me I need it Lord I want to thank you that the Saints prayed for me a few Wednesday nights I don't do that very often Lord you know my heart I don't usually ask for the people's prayers Lord thank you for hearing their prayers I'm really thankful for their striving to take service a few minutes longer and I feel free Lord hallelujah spirit of fear is gone Lord God Amen I just want to thank you for that I'm no longer a snake to fear CU I'm a Child of God thank you for your mercy thank you for your love Jesus Lord we can learn so much from these beautiful letters Lord God they're Eternal and as the voice Cried Out Lord beyond the curtain of time we're resting on that that brother
