[38:14] we're watching and waiting for Jesus his
[38:16] second coming praise the Lord let's go
[38:19] to Revelation chapter 3 I like to look
[38:21] at the Laodicean Church age this will be
[38:22] part 6 of the Laodicean Church age the
[38:25] last time I preached it was November
[38:27] 2015 so it's been a while went back and
[38:30] checked my notes and did my studies so
[38:32] Revelation chapter 3 we're looking at
[38:36] types of the Laodicean Church age this
[38:37] morning it's a thought I've never really
[38:39] had before I was driving the car with my
[38:41] family and the thought just struck me
[38:44] did you ever something along the lines
[38:47] of you need to study the types of the
[38:49] layers see in church age and so I did
[38:51] that there's 22 hits on that and we did
[38:55] that by God's grace so let's go to
[38:56] Revelation chapter 3
[39:03] so thankful for God and God's grace good
[39:06] to see all the Saints this morning that
[39:07] could make it out to the house of Lord
[39:13] sister trying to make sure you tell the
[39:15] Saints we said hello hello and give our
[39:17] greetings to them as without by the
[39:18] grace the Lord revelation 3 let's go to
[39:22] verse 14 now before I read us remember
[39:28] Jesus gives no compliment to this church
[39:30] age this is kind of a rough church age
[39:32] but that's the hour that we're living in
[39:34] amen we've got to overcome all the
[39:37] temptations of the world we've got to
[39:40] live for Jesus Christ in this hour
[39:41] amen we're grateful to do it happy about
[39:44] it and we've got to do exactly what
[39:48] Jesus said in this hour so this is what
[39:50] Christ tells us to do in verse 14
[39:53] these are red-letter words the words of
[39:55] Jesus Christ and unto the Angel of the
[39:57] Church of the Laodiceans write these
[39:59] things saith the Amen the faithful and
[40:02] true witness the create I'm sorry the
[40:05] beginning of the creation of God I know
[40:09] thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[40:12] hot I would thou wert cold or hot so
[40:18] then because thou art lukewarm and
[40:19] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[40:21] out of my mouth most people don't know
[40:23] that Jesus talks about throwing up
[40:26] churches out of his mouth most people
[40:27] don't know that but that's in the Bible
[40:29] if a church will not speak the words of
[40:32] the Bible Jesus will not let them be his
[40:34] mouthpiece they'll not be part of the
[40:37] body of Christ verse 17 because they'll
[40:40] say US this is the attitude of the false
[40:42] churches because they say I'm rich I'm
[40:45] increased with Goods I have need of
[40:47] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[40:50] wretched and miserable poor and blind
[40:53] and naked I counsel thee to buy of me
[40:56] gold tried in the fire the Jesus is
[40:59] telling them how oh I'll give you advice
[41:01] I'll counsel you if you'll come to me I
[41:03] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[41:05] the fire that thou may s be rich and
[41:07] white raiment that thou mayest be
[41:09] clothed and that the shame of thy
[41:11] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[41:15] eyes with eyesalve that thou may
[41:17] see as many as I love I rebuke and
[41:20] chasten if Jesus loves you he's gonna
[41:23] tell you where you're wrong in order to
[41:25] correct to you how many boo that these
[41:28] zealous therefore and repent that's what
[41:30] we find so rare in this hour
[41:32] people that are eager to repent because
[41:36] it's a prideful age let's be those that
[41:38] are eager to repent praise God
[41:39] verse twenty behold I stand at the door
[41:42] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[41:45] the door I will come in to him and will
[41:48] sup with him and he with me to him that
[41:50] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[41:52] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[41:57] have sat down with my father in his
[41:59] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[42:02] what the spirit saith of the churches
[42:03] let's bow our heads for word of Prayer

[42:57] been taken to sacrifice may you bless
[42:59] them according to their their labors
[43:01] Lord God and we will give you all the
[43:03] praise and glory and honor and Jesus
[43:05] Christ Nate never said Amen god bless
[43:07] she's being seated praise the Lord this
[43:14] is part six of the latest in church age
[43:16] Malachi can switch over when you're
[43:18] learning okay thank you buddy he's on it
[43:21] thank you sir
[43:24] praise God
[43:28] mmm-hmm praise God no I think we'll just
[43:34] pick up right where we left off here I
[43:36] you say I haven't preached on this since
[43:38] November 22nd 2015 so I just felt a bird
[43:42] like I said I'm driving in the van and
[43:43] something just spoke to me and it said
[43:44] study the types of Laodicea I've never I
[43:48] never thought that in my life so I just
[43:50] wanted to see what the prophet of God
[43:52] said about Laodicea and it's types
[43:54] throughout the Bible and I found eight
[43:56] of them by the grace of Lord so we'll
[43:58] try to get through those today and show
[44:00] those to you by the grace of God there
[44:03] is an John and John and I were talking
[44:05] on this recently there is total
[44:06] application for everything we're
[44:08] preaching in other words everything we
[44:10] preach can be applied directly to your
[44:12] life and I'll just try to show that
[44:15] today by the grace of the Lord all these
[44:17] eight examples can be proved can be
[44:19] applied to your life and we just have to
[44:22] say is how does my life compared to Lots
[44:25] life or how does my life compared to
[44:26] Judas's or how does my life compared to
[44:29] Enochs hallelujah and if you do that if
[44:32] you apply every one of those then that's
[44:35] making the most of our time together and
[44:38] it's through the foolishness of
[44:40] preaching to save them that would
[44:42] believe Amen
[44:43] there's no greater power to change your
[44:46] life and through the preaching of the
[44:47] word how many know that's true there's
[44:49] no greater power it's to unite us as we
[44:51] saw last Sunday so unite us edify us and
[44:54] bring us in this full stature of the
[44:56] measure of Christ through the preaching
[44:58] of the word but and the prophet of God
[45:01] said if you want to get pepped up
[45:02] there's no other way to get pepped up if
[45:03] the preaching doesn't pep you up nothing
[45:05] will hey man let's get packed up this
[45:08] morning amen by the preaching of the
[45:10] word so we're in the Laodicean Church
[45:12] age it started in 1906 and we're not
[45:14] sure when it's gonna end
[45:15] we have no idea but we'll know the
[45:18] season Amen will feel the coming of the
[45:20] Lord because the bride makes herself
[45:22] ready as she approaches the going-away
[45:24] time as she approaches the wedding time
[45:26] she can feel it and she gets ready how
[45:29] many women been married in here what do
[45:31] you do you feel the pressure as you come
[45:34] up to your wedding day but isn't there -
[45:36] hopefully there's a time that comes when
[45:38] you can feel I'm ready
[45:40] maybe not for everybody but there should
[45:43] be there should be a feeling we made all
[45:45] the preparations we're ready for the
[45:47] wedding
[45:47] amen and I believe that's what the bride
[45:49] of Jesus Christ is experiencing now
[45:52] they're feeling the Holy Spirit help
[45:55] them get ready every day of their lives
[45:58] they've got on Sunday we feel it thank
[46:00] God we filled on Wednesday but I'm so
[46:02] more thankful I feel a-- on monday
[46:04] through sunday every day we should feel
[46:06] it being made ready every single day the
[46:10] messenger was Elijah because he was to
[46:12] restore the faith back to the father's
[46:15] according to Malachi 4 5 and 6 and of
[46:18] course we know that's William Branham he
[46:20] died in 1965 but had 56 years to leave a
[46:24] testimony for the name of Jesus Christ
[46:27] upon this earth and he did a fabulous
[46:29] job just as Eleazar did a perfect job to
[46:33] get a bride for Isaac so did our Eliezer
[46:35] Haman do the right job to get one for
[46:38] Jesus a bride for Jesus that's right
[46:40] now I just kind of changed my text here
[46:42] because I'm gonna add some visitors and
[46:44] maybe they never read revelation three
[46:46] so I changed my text you know just when
[46:48] we saw it we had visitors so they could
[46:49] see we wanted everybody to see what
[46:53] Jesus was saying to this church age it's
[46:55] not a very nice message because remember
[46:58] there's no compliments for Laodicea
[47:00] there's none and so we know that overall
[47:03] as a whole and that's because there's a
[47:05] very small group of faithful Christians
[47:07] in Laodicea this is the age when very
[47:10] few people will be saved most people
[47:12] would just be deceived by preachers the
[47:15] Bible says that deceivers will wax worse
[47:17] and worse most people have a preacher
[47:20] who deceives them into living in sin but
[47:23] there will be a small group who have the
[47:25] preachers of the Holy Spirit giving them
[47:27] inspiration to clean their lives to make
[47:29] them ready to get their lamps trimmed
[47:31] and get their fires burning for the
[47:33] coming of the Lord amen and they'll go
[47:36] out to meet Christ in the wedding
[47:37] procession amen they won't be saying oh
[47:40] I need a prayer life or I should have
[47:42] prayed more that's what the foolish
[47:43] virgin will be saying but the true Bride
[47:45] of Christ will have a prayer life should
[47:47] the fire of Christ their life everything
[47:49] will be made ready for the rapture amen
[47:52] hallelujah so
[47:53] I'm just gonna briefly review parts one
[47:56] through five and I do mean briefly I'm
[47:57] gonna try to go quickly here because I
[48:00] don't think any of us even I couldn't
[48:02] remember what I preached on the lay OC
[48:03] in church age so if I couldn't remember
[48:05] I don't know I didn't know how many of
[48:07] us could remember so we went over this a
[48:09] little bit but the world'll and the word
[48:11] Laodicea means justice of the people the
[48:13] literal city was a major financial and
[48:16] political power
[48:17] earthquakes destroyed the city the city
[48:19] perfectly types our church age with its
[48:21] riches and political pressures this age
[48:24] will also end with earthquakes as well
[48:26] the Bible clearly says that in the book
[48:28] of Revelation metha at the sounding of
[48:30] the trumpets when the earthquakes and
[48:31] the woes there's all these earthquakes
[48:33] at the end of the world and we know
[48:35] that's coming
[48:36] now our first verse we looked at and
[48:40] unto the Angel of the Church aleris
[48:41] ian's these things saith the Amen the
[48:43] faithful and true witness the beginning
[48:46] of the creation of God don't you love
[48:48] how Jesus describes himself you and I
[48:50] could try to describe Jesus but it's
[48:52] best when we let Jesus describe himself
[48:55] amen because when he describes himself
[48:57] we get the capstone revelation of is
[49:00] this three-fold capstone revelation this
[49:03] is the last Church age this is the last
[49:05] time Jesus is going to describe himself
[49:07] to his Gentile bride before he marries
[49:09] her and he tells his wife I'm the Amen
[49:11] I'm the Soviet I'm the faithful and true
[49:15] witness in other words you can trust me
[49:17] bride I'm faithful amen I'm a true
[49:20] witness of the things of God and I am
[49:22] the beginning of the creation of God and
[49:24] in other words Jesus saying you're part
[49:26] of the new creation of God amen
[49:29] when you're born again by the baptism of
[49:31] the Holy Ghost you are part of the new
[49:34] creation Jesus was the firstborn among
[49:37] many brethren and we are the next born
[49:39] among many brethren I'll say like this
[49:41] we're the last born among many brethren
[49:43] right until the 144,000 but were the
[49:47] last in the Gentile church age how many
[49:50] can say amen to that
[49:51] now remember Jesus says I know your
[49:53] works you're neither cold nor hot I
[49:56] would thou wert cold or hot Jesus would
[49:59] rather have you cold or hot than be
[50:01] lukewarm kind of wishy-washy in the
[50:04] middle of the road
[50:05] so Jesus gives no compliment to this age
[50:08] it's such a short age it's such a
[50:11] deceived age he cannot give a compliment
[50:13] to the age because the group of
[50:15] believers is so small yet God sees our
[50:19] works as our faith expressed it is
[50:22] better to be cold than lukewarm it's
[50:25] best to be hot amen
[50:27] how many want to be hot for Christ we
[50:30] must be hot for Christ that's the only
[50:32] hope of going in the rapture is to give
[50:35] everything to the Lord Jesus Christ I
[50:37] hope if any of the sermons I preached in
[50:39] the last few years have helped you I
[50:41] hope it's helped you in this way to help
[50:43] you decide I've got to cut everything
[50:45] out that doesn't glorify Christ and I
[50:47] want to serve Christ with a hot daily
[50:49] experience giving everything sacrificing
[50:52] everything for my Lord amen
[50:54] I hope that I hope your tent is clean
[50:56] this morning amen because if your tents
[50:59] clean this church will be clean
[51:01] hallelujah it's exactly right
[51:03] I said lukewarm now remember there's
[51:07] three conditions the word lukewarm means
[51:09] tepid lacking conviction when you come
[51:12] to church and read your Bible or you're
[51:14] listening to preach sermons you don't
[51:15] feel any conviction from those sermons
[51:17] that's a lukewarm experience that's what
[51:20] lukewarm means there's no fire there's
[51:22] you don't have you don't have a feeling
[51:23] for Jesus you come to church and you
[51:25] don't feel I mean you feel a little bit
[51:27] but not you don't feel real conviction
[51:28] we need to feel God's speaking to our
[51:31] hearts every service we need to feel God
[51:34] speaking to our hearts everyday amen and
[51:37] that the only way that's possible is
[51:39] through dying to ourselves and accepting
[51:42] the Word of God and saying God make it
[51:45] new again I want to fall another few
[51:48] again Jesus amen
[51:49] help me to fall in love with you and not
[51:52] the things of the world amen now
[51:54] remember a hot program tells us the hot
[51:56] experience is to know the truth and live
[51:59] it a cold chilly experience doesn't even
[52:03] care about God it's cold toward God
[52:05] doesn't care what the word says but yet
[52:07] those people can go to church as well
[52:08] right like Pharisees and so for like
[52:11] that they were twofold the children of
[52:13] hell than the people that witness to
[52:16] them or in proselyte of them to the
[52:17] Pharisee religion
[52:19] so they can even be Church members and
[52:21] be cold so what it boils down to is we
[52:25] must feel the conviction of the holy
[52:26] spirit we must have enthusiasm for God
[52:29] we must not neglect the things of God
[52:31] and we must live what we know hallelujah
[52:35] I notice he's gonna throw up Jesus is
[52:38] gonna vomit the false churches out of
[52:41] his mouth which means they will no
[52:43] longer be the mouthpiece of God most
[52:46] churches today are not speaking the Word
[52:48] of God they're preaching about all your
[52:50] best life can be now what an awful thing
[52:53] that is if you're if your best life is
[52:56] right now
[52:56] how awful you're not gonna enjoy heaven
[52:58] at all because you won't be there amen
[53:01] Church my best life is going to be in
[53:05] the New Jerusalem praise God and the
[53:07] Millennium that's where that my best
[53:10] life is going to be I want to live my
[53:12] best for Christ now yes but see our
[53:14] focus must be on on sacrificial love
[53:17] right now sacrificing for others and not
[53:21] caring about the external things but
[53:23] caring about the inward work that Christ
[53:26] is doing in our lives not so much
[53:28] dressing out the outside but having this
[53:30] the inside man dressed up for God's
[53:32] glory amen
[53:34] most churches are no longer mouthpieces
[53:37] of God how do you know when they let
[53:39] people sin and they keep letting them
[53:42] sin and don't preach against it and they
[53:44] don't rebuke sin they're no longer
[53:46] speaking for God because Jesus says you
[53:49] must be zealous and repent of your sins
[53:51] so any churches that allow people to get
[53:53] married two three times they're not the
[53:56] mouthpieces of God churches that are not
[53:58] homosexuality or transgender they're not
[54:01] the Churches of God they can say that
[54:03] they can call themselves churches but if
[54:05] they don't preach the Word of God and if
[54:08] they don't help the people to live
[54:09] according to Jesus he has thrown them up
[54:12] out of his mouth he has vomited them out
[54:15] because they won't say what he said we
[54:18] must say what Jesus is saying amen see
[54:22] the bride that's Jesus's wife the true
[54:24] church is the mouthpiece through the
[54:26] spirit they both say come to the word
[54:29] come to Christ come to the Word of God
[54:32] have your life changed by the revealed
[54:34] Word of God hey man I said yes sir the
[54:37] church is no longer the mouthpiece of
[54:39] God it is its own mouthpiece so God is
[54:42] turning on her
[54:43] he will confound her through the prophet
[54:45] and the bride for the voice of God will
[54:48] be in her amen
[54:50] how many believe the voice of God's in
[54:52] you I believe it I believe it's the
[54:55] voice of God is in me how do you know
[54:57] because people say God speaks to them
[54:59] when I preach or when I talk to them God
[55:01] speaks them how do you know because of
[55:03] the witnesses that God has given us when
[55:06] we stop saying our words but start
[55:09] saying his words now we become the
[55:11] mouthpiece of God amen
[55:13] the Bible said the spirit and the bride
[55:15] say come
[55:16] once more the world were here direct
[55:19] from God as at Pentecost but of course
[55:21] the word bride will be disowned as in
[55:24] the first church age so will be a
[55:26] smaller more rejected church all the
[55:28] time more rejection more rejection all
[55:30] the time now I'm still in part this part
[55:34] one still or this part one and two I
[55:36] think the Prophet described the church
[55:38] ages of the Lansing church age he said
[55:41] Chile services will drive the true
[55:43] believer to the red-hot services Amen
[55:47] hallelujah glory a true child of God
[55:50] cannot hang around cold dead churches
[55:52] they got to go someplace where there's
[55:54] life they men marry services show
[55:58] enthusiasm once in a while will be the
[56:02] Laodicean Church age where they only get
[56:04] excited about music instead of the word
[56:06] the word should make you most excited
[56:08] the music should refresh you so that
[56:11] when the word comes you can shout
[56:13] hallelujah event you can say hot leg you
[56:16] Jesus I'm gonna live that word amen
[56:19] the latest in church has no warmth of
[56:21] the Holy Ghost
[56:22] they have no burden for lost souls I'm
[56:25] happy to say where there's people crying
[56:27] for lost souls at the altar this morning
[56:29] before service how do you know because I
[56:31] saw it later to see
[56:35] lives are loaded down with worldly
[56:38] events causing lukewarmness they're so
[56:41] weighed down and by heavy burdens of the
[56:43] world they don't feel free when they
[56:44] come to church don't feel happy when
[56:46] they come to church their lives are so
[56:47] heavily burdened with cares of the world
[56:49] they can't even be free and rejoice and
[56:52] love the Lord they're so cold on God
[56:56] uh-huh Jesus said because you say you're
[57:00] rich increased with Goods and have need
[57:01] of nothing notice now not without
[57:03] wretched miserable poor blind and naked
[57:06] the profits of the church to most
[57:08] people's a business everyone has to be
[57:11] complains or there or I'm sorry paid or
[57:13] they complain most churches not ours
[57:16] most churches people can they're more
[57:19] concerned about the size of the crowd
[57:20] and the preaching of the word that's why
[57:23] we just had a few people here at the
[57:24] start of service it don't bother me
[57:25] because I know Jesus is here I'm not
[57:29] concerned about the number my concern
[57:30] yes to get people here to be safe
[57:32] yes I'm concerned about that but the
[57:34] overall number doesn't move us because
[57:36] all that the father has given me will
[57:38] come to me praise God the people are
[57:42] more concerned about the physical
[57:44] condition of the church than the move of
[57:46] the Holy Ghost you know last night our
[57:50] family came and we did some cleaning
[57:51] here at the church but you know what's
[57:55] more important was the praying we did
[57:56] before service today that's more
[57:58] important we want to we want to clean
[58:00] shirts we want everything organized and
[58:01] neat and clean and swept and everything
[58:04] like that but we want our mind swept out
[58:06] by the Holy Ghost we want our hearts and
[58:09] our desires and our motives and object
[58:11] is to be cleaned out by Jesus Christ
[58:14] amen
[58:15] but mem said people are in a layer to
[58:17] see in church are afraid to say Amen
[58:19] during the service and don't like it
[58:21] when people act drunk in the spirit they
[58:23] don't but I like that amen
[58:25] we like that praise God we like people
[58:28] to be happy about Jesus worshipping
[58:31] Jesus free in the spirit we want to see
[58:33] people move by the Holy Spirit amen and
[58:36] they're afraid people later seen
[58:39] churches are afraid of the
[58:40] manifestations of the gifts in their
[58:41] lives well I can now never want to speak
[58:43] in tongues right I never want to shout
[58:45] or I never want to pray for somebody or
[58:47] I I never want to prophesy
[58:49] because of what other people will think
[58:50] of me the real Christian all they care
[58:53] about is what God thinks about them but
[58:57] that's what Laodicean church is all we
[58:58] could we can never act like that I could
[59:00] never clap my hands I could never get
[59:02] excited you ought to that's why your
[59:03] hands were made to clap and glorify
[59:06] Jesus that's why they were made part
[59:10] three
[59:10] all right I've already done through two
[59:11] of them he said I counsel you to be
[59:13] buying me gold tried in the fire that
[59:15] thou mayest be rich and white raiment
[59:17] that thou mayest be clothed that the
[59:20] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[59:22] anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that
[59:24] thou mayest see I had a striking dream
[59:29] last night remind me not to forget I had
[59:31] a dream of our brother Brandon last
[59:32] night I've never had a dream about
[59:34] brother Branham till last night and I
[59:36] was in the prayer line I'm gonna tell
[59:38] you about that later so I don't forget
[59:40] it's striking I just remembered I forgot
[59:42] to tell my wife even I just I forgot til
[59:44] I was here at the altar praying and I
[59:46] believe it's uh it's godly wisdom for me
[59:48] going forward it was like I was in the
[59:50] prayer line and brother Graham discern
[59:51] my heart it was striking I've never had
[59:54] a dream like that in my life now the
[59:58] great burdens of this age are pressure
[1:00:00] of riches soft living and nervous
[1:00:02] tensions that's what we must overcome
[1:00:05] the pressure to be rich soft living we
[1:00:10] must not make our lives too easy
[1:00:13] we've got up you know to pay insurance
[1:00:15] we got to these things but we can't make
[1:00:17] them too easy that we neglect the
[1:00:19] spiritual needs in our lives like if
[1:00:24] Jesus would call us to you know
[1:00:25] sacrifice to sell this for the sake of
[1:00:28] the church and we won't do it
[1:00:29] something's wrong with our lives if
[1:00:31] God's calling us overseas and we won't
[1:00:33] go overseas
[1:00:34] something's wrong with us right I don't
[1:00:36] feel that call yet but I feel like
[1:00:38] coming back amen nervous tensions we
[1:00:42] must not let ourselves get overcome by
[1:00:45] nervousness we must have peace that
[1:00:48] passes understanding amen
[1:00:50] remember there's Philippians 4 there's
[1:00:52] eight channels of thought things that
[1:00:55] are pure lovely holy godly good report
[1:00:57] there's eight different channels and
[1:00:59] choose any of those eight and think on
[1:01:01] those things don't think
[1:01:03] nervous you are think about how good god
[1:01:05] is amen
[1:01:06] think about the last trial you went
[1:01:09] through if God brought me through that
[1:01:10] one he's gonna bring me through this one
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:13] he's faithful we must think on the right
[1:01:17] things and not be nervous
[1:01:19] don't let nervousness steal your joy or
[1:01:21] your victory
[1:01:23] remember gold the gold of God which is
[1:01:26] the christ-like character which we're
[1:01:27] gonna get to character then this sermon
[1:01:29] hopefully because my man said the rich
[1:01:31] young ruler had character and Jesus
[1:01:34] loved his character gold must character
[1:01:37] must be bought from Jesus alone you must
[1:01:40] go to Jesus and say Jesus I want to buy
[1:01:43] your character and it only comes through
[1:01:46] accepting the sufferings that he gives
[1:01:48] you that's the only way Jesus learned
[1:01:52] obedience through all the victories and
[1:01:54] miracles that he did does that sound
[1:01:55] right that gets the scripture no Jesus
[1:01:58] learned obedience through the things he
[1:02:00] suffered you and I will learn obedience
[1:02:03] through the things that we suffer that's
[1:02:08] the only way to get gold
[1:02:09] it's tried in the fire gold godly
[1:02:12] character is molded in the fires of
[1:02:14] affliction memorize am 55 said you can
[1:02:17] buy wine and milk from God without money
[1:02:19] with a price aren't you glad all of
[1:02:21] God's eternal blessings don't cost you
[1:02:23] one cent hey amen God asked you for 10
[1:02:27] or 11 percent you know to help the
[1:02:29] church hopefully more if you can give
[1:02:30] more that helps the people of God helps
[1:02:32] the Ministry of God do things like video
[1:02:35] ministry and all these things that are
[1:02:36] blessing people around the world but
[1:02:38] outside of that if you want more
[1:02:39] character God doesn't ask you for
[1:02:41] anything he asks you for a spiritual
[1:02:43] transaction he asks you to sacrifice
[1:02:46] cares of the world and desires of the
[1:02:48] world he asked you to sacrifice that and
[1:02:51] by the sufferings and allow everything
[1:02:54] I'm sorry to allow everything in your
[1:02:56] life to mold you into a real Christian
[1:02:58] amen to accept sufferings knowing that
[1:03:00] if I suffer it'll teach me how to reign
[1:03:03] with Christ amen the Bible said we
[1:03:05] cannot rule and reign with Christ unless
[1:03:07] we suffer with him amen
[1:03:10] hallelujah she must be willing to suffer
[1:03:14] the sufferings of life in order to reign
[1:03:16] with
[1:03:17] Jesus this course is different for
[1:03:19] everybody remember the rich kind of gold
[1:03:24] is christ-like character tried to the
[1:03:27] fiery affliction of a furnace I'm sorry
[1:03:29] the fiery furnace of affliction Jesus
[1:03:32] character went through Gethsemane
[1:03:34] Calvary and death and we must go through
[1:03:37] a daily death dying out to ourselves let
[1:03:45] me just um let me just go back there let
[1:03:47] me just share that dream now so I don't
[1:03:49] forget okay I never my wife can tell you
[1:03:51] I never have spiritual dreams rarely I
[1:03:53] thought like two or three most of them
[1:03:54] are because I have dreams because I'm so
[1:03:56] worn out and stressed and that affects
[1:03:58] you know my dreams and I get all nervous
[1:04:00] and I'm running from things I'm trying
[1:04:02] to make sure things don't crash you know
[1:04:03] I think it's the type of my life I'm
[1:04:06] trying to make sure I balance everything
[1:04:07] in my life don't don't crash the church
[1:04:09] and don't crash my job and don't crash
[1:04:11] my family but I had a dream last night
[1:04:14] Church I had a dream last night and I
[1:04:18] was in the prayer line in brother Brown
[1:04:19] when he was a little younger man he
[1:04:20] wasn't as old as he was at 65 and I come
[1:04:22] up with the prayer line and I said
[1:04:23] brother branham I said something along
[1:04:24] these lines as a brother branham I went
[1:04:27] to church why isn't the church moving
[1:04:28] you know why isn't the church
[1:04:29] moving like I like to you know could
[1:04:31] just help me and brother branham looked
[1:04:34] at me and he said you need to seek God
[1:04:38] more and honestly my dream I left I left
[1:04:43] the prayer line thing I come to church
[1:04:45] every Saturday I fast and pray every
[1:04:46] Saturday and Sunday I tried to see God I
[1:04:49] try to pray every morning and every
[1:04:50] night and I was a little bit upset
[1:04:53] thinking I fast and pray I try to
[1:04:56] sacrifice I try to seek God ask my wife
[1:04:58] I try to pray study as much as I
[1:05:00] possibly can I have twenty eight
[1:05:02] thousand words I've written on the book
[1:05:03] I'm almost done with chapter six I just
[1:05:05] tried to give all my devotion to Christ
[1:05:11] and I go in the prayer line now I don't
[1:05:13] know if this is your I don't know I'm
[1:05:14] not saying as I say the Lord but it's
[1:05:15] interesting I've never had a dream
[1:05:17] before about brother Branham and I come
[1:05:20] in the prayer line and I leave a little
[1:05:22] bit confused like I thought I was
[1:05:23] seeking God so it encouraged me to let
[1:05:27] me know that there's more of God I can
[1:05:29] seek
[1:05:30] it encouraged me that way I don't know
[1:05:33] what that would do to you but it showed
[1:05:35] me there must be more I must see God
[1:05:38] because remember Jeremiah said when you
[1:05:39] see God with all your heart all your
[1:05:41] soul all your strength I'll be found of
[1:05:45] you now how many of us can honestly say
[1:05:47] every day you see God with all your
[1:05:49] heart all your mind all your strength in
[1:05:53] your home on your job on your lunch
[1:05:55] break how many of us can say we really
[1:05:58] seek God with all that we have it
[1:06:01] encouraged me because let me know I need
[1:06:03] to see God more I need to pray more I
[1:06:06] need to devote more of my life to Christ
[1:06:08] sorry I have made me happy and I forgot
[1:06:11] about that till I was here praying the
[1:06:13] only time I've ever had a dream about
[1:06:14] brother branham he said you need to see
[1:06:17] God more now if the pastor is to see God
[1:06:19] more then God will help the church to
[1:06:21] see God more too because the God raises
[1:06:23] it past their congregation pastor
[1:06:25] congregation and God knows I've never
[1:06:27] given more of my time for Christ than
[1:06:29] right now I'm a deacon treasurer son
[1:06:31] leader trustee pastor you name it
[1:06:33] whatever it is I am I'm oh that I felt
[1:06:37] like I've never given more but there
[1:06:38] must be room for more to be given day
[1:06:41] man if Jesus could sanctify himself
[1:06:44] before his crucifixion and more
[1:06:46] consecrate his life to God how much more
[1:06:49] you and I a man so be encouraged I
[1:06:52] didn't ever knew this before but I was
[1:06:53] in the prayer line with brother Branham
[1:06:55] I never knew that that's really nice to
[1:06:57] have Amen if it wasn't just a dream
[1:06:59] praise the Lord I'm very thankful for
[1:07:01] that dream I can't flee to buy of me
[1:07:05] gold tried in the fire that thou mayest
[1:07:07] be rich and white raiment that thou
[1:07:09] may'st be clothed and that the shame of
[1:07:10] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[1:07:12] thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayst
[1:07:14] see so a prophet describes this all
[1:07:19] things are naked before the Word of God
[1:07:21] God sees everything every motive every
[1:07:23] objective God saw why you came to church
[1:07:24] today amen God knows why you're here are
[1:07:29] you here just so people don't think your
[1:07:30] back slid are you here because you feel
[1:07:32] bad you don't want to go to hell are you
[1:07:34] here because you love Jesus Christ I
[1:07:36] hope it's the third one you're here
[1:07:39] because you love Jesus Christ because
[1:07:43] Christ is
[1:07:43] makes everything known and remember your
[1:07:46] actions manifest what's inside of you
[1:07:48] right your reaction to this sermon today
[1:07:51] will show what's inside of you just like
[1:07:55] every sermon your response to the
[1:07:57] singing your your attitude towards me
[1:07:59] your the word that we're preaching your
[1:08:01] attitude shows what's in your heart
[1:08:03] already the Word of God makes everything
[1:08:06] naked the Word of God makes everything
[1:08:07] plain to see this is where the person
[1:08:10] stands this is where they're at this is
[1:08:12] what they're struggling with this is
[1:08:13] where they're getting victory the Word
[1:08:15] of God discerns everything amen now the
[1:08:19] bride is clothed in white garments the
[1:08:21] righteousness of saints meaning the
[1:08:24] purity of life and correctness of acting
[1:08:26] feeling and thinking this is what the
[1:08:30] white garment represents eternal life
[1:08:32] she's pure she's a pure life she acts
[1:08:35] the right way she feels everything the
[1:08:37] right thing she thinks the right thing
[1:08:39] and righteousness comes through faith
[1:08:42] and the washing of the regeneration of
[1:08:44] the Spirit as he washed you this week I
[1:08:46] hope you've had times this week where
[1:08:48] you felt like Jesus washed here he
[1:08:50] should wash you every day church amen
[1:08:52] he should wash you every day that's what
[1:08:54] prayers are through our prayer so
[1:08:55] powerful it's like a constant bath it's
[1:08:58] like another bath it's like another
[1:08:59] shower you get as you pray you feel the
[1:09:01] presence of God you repent of your sins
[1:09:03] remember you found that the outline PRA
[1:09:05] why you praise him you repent you ask
[1:09:08] and you yield those are the four
[1:09:09] ingredients remember that the altar of
[1:09:11] incense had four ingredients in the
[1:09:13] incense right so prayer has four
[1:09:16] ingredients when you surly pray you feel
[1:09:19] you need to repent and then you could
[1:09:21] ask God anything Amen hallelujah well
[1:09:26] this is a longer review and I thought
[1:09:27] you all but it is a good church you
[1:09:29] enjoy the review okay I heard a few
[1:09:31] amens hallelujah
[1:09:32] you will only take your character with
[1:09:34] you either the softness of the character
[1:09:37] lists Laodicean people or the
[1:09:39] christ-like character tried through the
[1:09:41] fiery furnace of affliction nearly all
[1:09:45] people today are naked and not aware of
[1:09:47] it that's why we didn't preach it on
[1:09:48] clothes that you wear right when men
[1:09:50] take off their shirts and show off their
[1:09:51] muscles or when women wear those tight
[1:09:53] pants they're showing off their legs
[1:09:55] they're basically naked men do it
[1:09:57] - they wear short shorts like that its
[1:10:00] nakedness women shows off her cleavage
[1:10:03] she's putting nakedness before men is
[1:10:06] that right that's exactly right anytime
[1:10:08] a woman shows down from her shoulders
[1:10:11] down here it's naked anytime a man shows
[1:10:13] from his knees up or a woman shows her
[1:10:14] knees up any area from here to here is
[1:10:16] naked praise God
[1:10:19] its nakedness and you must cover and
[1:10:22] Jesus said you're naked
[1:10:23] he said come to me and get some clothes
[1:10:25] amen now you come to me and I'll give
[1:10:28] you some clothes if you don't have any
[1:10:29] clothes that covers your thighs I'll
[1:10:30] give you some clothes I'll buy you some
[1:10:32] but Jesus wants you to be closed
[1:10:34] naturally and he wants you to be closed
[1:10:35] spiritually amen spiritually where your
[1:10:39] acts are righteous your attitude is
[1:10:41] righteous amen
[1:10:42] your works are holy and the price to pay
[1:10:46] for these garments is you must separate
[1:10:48] from sin and sinners hallelujah
[1:10:51] you must be although there must there's
[1:10:53] got to be times if you're a Christian
[1:10:55] where you feel all alone but you're
[1:10:56] never alone because Christ is with you
[1:10:58] amen but you must feel alone from your
[1:11:02] family from your friends from your
[1:11:04] buddies from your friends and your
[1:11:06] girlfriends and your boyfriend's you
[1:11:08] must leave all those to serve Jesus
[1:11:10] Christ hallelujah that's the price to
[1:11:13] pay for these garments I constantly to
[1:11:18] buy of me gold tried the fire
[1:11:20] I thought makes me rich ok I'm into the
[1:11:21] underlined part and anoint thine eyes
[1:11:23] with eyesalve that thou may see I self
[1:11:26] allows one to see that hot oil of the
[1:11:29] Holy Ghost the grease Laodiceans
[1:11:32] are blind to what God has for them he
[1:11:35] could only have his word for them but
[1:11:37] they don't want that they don't want
[1:11:39] that the only way to know what God has
[1:11:42] for you is to let him wash your eyes or
[1:11:45] get a hot oil of your eyes so you can
[1:11:47] get all the matter out of your eyes so
[1:11:49] you can see clearly that's the only way
[1:11:51] to know and then you can read your Bible
[1:11:52] Church and now the Bible can speak to
[1:11:55] you now what was striking the reason I
[1:11:59] knew this was a sermon to preach this
[1:12:00] morning my daily devotion was Romans 2
[1:12:04] and I read Romans 2 this morning he like
[1:12:06] I read Romans 1 yesterday and I go an
[1:12:09] open later sea and church
[1:12:11] age part 5 and I spent most of my time
[1:12:13] preaching on Romans - what are the
[1:12:16] chances of that church that was November
[1:12:18] 22nd of 2015 it's almost like the whole
[1:12:22] and I had a dream last night of brother
[1:12:23] Branham and all these latency in church
[1:12:24] age you know the world doesn't want to
[1:12:27] seek after God we must put more into
[1:12:29] seeking God we want to seek more of the
[1:12:32] word we must seek more of the message we
[1:12:34] must seek for more of Jesus amen because
[1:12:38] too many people are seeking for too many
[1:12:39] other worldly things soft living riches
[1:12:43] of the world they're nervous they're
[1:12:45] trying to break their nerves you know
[1:12:46] with things of the world
[1:12:48] there's only at one app that can help
[1:12:50] for that and that's the Bible app so
[1:12:53] read the Bible and then pray that's all
[1:12:55] right that's the only app that's going
[1:12:56] to help you for that churches today
[1:13:00] substitute the pot of the Holy Ghost for
[1:13:01] program and the word for Creed
[1:13:04] there's just everything's the same all
[1:13:06] the time there's nothing different that
[1:13:08] happens out of order nobody ever gets
[1:13:11] saved really you get saved or really
[1:13:12] repents and instead of preaching the
[1:13:14] word they preach traditions of Creed's
[1:13:16] right they're so blind they don't miss
[1:13:20] tongues and I hope you're missing
[1:13:22] spiritual gifts I hope you want to see
[1:13:24] more gifts in the church that's what I'm
[1:13:25] saying but man said they don't miss
[1:13:27] tongue speakers they don't miss
[1:13:29] prophesying or they don't like preaching
[1:13:31] they don't miss preaching that shucks
[1:13:33] you like a piece of corn it shucks you
[1:13:37] it rips down your hide it tears off your
[1:13:39] feelings it it takes no thought about
[1:13:41] how you're feeling
[1:13:42] Lanta see in churches don't miss that
[1:13:45] but we should want that we should want
[1:13:48] God to anoint me or whoever's preaching
[1:13:50] brother bricks or brother Craig or
[1:13:52] whoever's preaching to skinned our hides
[1:13:54] if we're wrong to skin our hides and
[1:13:57] help us to be pure before God hey man if
[1:14:00] not you're clearly Laodicean lukewarm
[1:14:04] and church you should
[1:14:07] here prank say God do a miracle this
[1:14:09] morning that right oh I don't miss those
[1:14:15] people used to cry and speak in tongues
[1:14:17] and shout and scream I don't miss any of
[1:14:19] that we shouldn't miss that we don't see
[1:14:22] it for a while we should miss and say

[1:14:27] annoyed somebody with the Holy Ghost
[1:14:29] amen
[1:14:29] and like me is what we should say most
[1:14:31] praise God anoint me we miss the move of
[1:14:35] the Holy Spirit anoint me to be your
[1:14:38] servant hallelujah and then Jesus
[1:14:41] standing outside trying to come in I'm
[1:14:44] DISA and he said program so he's trying
[1:14:45] to bring Pentecost back in he's trying
[1:14:51] to bring the Holy Ghost
[1:14:52] drunken experience back into the church
[1:14:54] amen he's saying can I bring the Holy
[1:14:56] Ghost in with me I love to bring it in
[1:14:58] with me motors to say don't even get
[1:15:00] there we'd rather have our Super Bowl
[1:15:02] we'd rather have our Olympics we'd
[1:15:04] rather celebrate that Jesus say well I'm
[1:15:06] gonna give you eternal life amen
[1:15:08] I'm gonna give you life and life more
[1:15:10] abundantly hallelujah amen I'm getting
[1:15:15] there bear with me as many as I love
[1:15:20] remember program describes us the focus
[1:15:23] is Jesus's love not ours necessarily and
[1:15:25] not what he's going back to
[1:15:27] predestination now in this statement as
[1:15:29] many as I love Jesus is showing we are
[1:15:32] saved based upon his choosing
[1:15:34] as many as I love we glory in his plan
[1:15:38] in his love elective love is Christ
[1:15:42] choosing to love us Jacob have I loved
[1:15:45] Esau have I hated
[1:15:48] elect according to the foreknowledge of
[1:15:50] God remember the Bible says that so this
[1:15:52] statement goes back to the election of
[1:15:54] God and then to as many as I love I
[1:15:58] rebuke to rebuke means to reprove and to
[1:16:01] expose with correction in mind it does
[1:16:04] not mean to publish I'm sorry punished
[1:16:07] sorry he chastens the Prophet says with
[1:16:10] nail-scarred hands so that hands that
[1:16:13] are correcting you you can see the nails
[1:16:15] you can know that the person who's
[1:16:17] correcting me suffered himself
[1:16:20] the person who's trying to correct me
[1:16:22] had to be corrected himself he had to be
[1:16:25] sanctified himself had to be guided
[1:16:28] himself had this submit to God's will
[1:16:31] himself he didn't want to die right he
[1:16:34] didn't want to go the cross three times
[1:16:35] he said don't let me go the cross and
[1:16:37] the father said you need to go to the
[1:16:38] cross that was the guest 70 conference
[1:16:42] do I have to go the cross and the Dove
[1:16:44] said yes you must go to the cross if you
[1:16:47] love them you must go to the cross amen
[1:16:50] remember he's the Potter we're the clay
[1:16:53] I never yet seen a good Potter beat up
[1:16:56] the clay have you honey no your art
[1:16:59] classes she didn't college you don't sit
[1:17:01] there and beat up the blue clay but you
[1:17:03] use gentle hands is that right I know it
[1:17:06] don't have to slam down the clay to kind
[1:17:08] of get to be one piece okay so maybe the
[1:17:09] first view the first view who touches
[1:17:12] you know it can be harsh but then when
[1:17:14] he takes the water of that word amen and
[1:17:17] begins applying the word to your life he
[1:17:20] shapes you with nail-scarred hands amen
[1:17:24] we must be zealous and repent the false
[1:17:26] church has the wrong zeal there's heels
[1:17:28] for big buildings and creeds like I said
[1:17:31] I've been to two denominational oneness
[1:17:33] churches in the last couple years and
[1:17:34] the biggest cheers I heard was when
[1:17:36] they're both building a brand they're
[1:17:38] both building a brand new church those
[1:17:40] were the biggest cheers of the services
[1:17:41] and I saw the one church they ran all
[1:17:43] the brothers ran around the church
[1:17:44] during the song service they were
[1:17:46] shouting and screaming clapping but the
[1:17:49] loudest cheers where we're getting a new
[1:17:51] church building
[1:17:51] what is our loudest cheer for it should
[1:17:55] be to praise Jesus
[1:17:56] it should be to thank him for all he's
[1:17:59] done for us
[1:18:00] amen not some building that's going to
[1:18:03] pass away but the fact that we're the
[1:18:05] building amen
[1:18:07] the believers are the building of Christ
[1:18:09] hallelujah
[1:18:10] I'm the temple of the Holy Ghost you're
[1:18:13] the Temple of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:18:15] that should get the biggest shots in the
[1:18:17] church amen hallelujah amen they're more
[1:18:22] zealous for their Creed's
[1:18:23] oh now homosexuals can preach in our
[1:18:25] church and the heavens saying they're
[1:18:28] weeping and crying saying no angels are
[1:18:32] weeping
[1:18:33] they rejoice when sinners come to
[1:18:35] repentance though with the cried to
[1:18:41] the Prophet said we NAMM an to challenge
[1:18:44] the churches like John the Baptist the
[1:18:47] best thing for the Laodicean church was
[1:18:49] a challenge that's why you should get
[1:18:51] used to me or any preacher giving you a
[1:18:53] challenge every service most people some
[1:18:56] people like challenges some people don't
[1:18:58] I challenge you to give this up I
[1:19:01] challenge you to repent I challenge you
[1:19:03] but the Prophet said this is what John
[1:19:04] the Baptist did this is what the spirit
[1:19:07] of Elijah does it challenges you to obey
[1:19:10] the word now for all the things that the
[1:19:13] Spirit is crying out against our true
[1:19:14] this age we need someone to come on the
[1:19:16] scene as John the Baptist did and
[1:19:18] challenge the church as never before
[1:19:20] what did I get last night a challenge to
[1:19:23] see God more my dream I thought I was
[1:19:26] seeking God brother Adam I thought I was
[1:19:29] but apparently there's more that I can
[1:19:31] give to God and I'm willing to accept
[1:19:34] that challenge it's a challenge God
[1:19:37] thought so much of it he came to me in a
[1:19:38] dream and he never does that rarely do I
[1:19:41] ever get a dream that spiritual like
[1:19:42] that got to seek God more hey hey man
[1:19:47] that's exactly what's coming to our age
[1:19:50] another John the Baptist has come in
[1:19:52] thank God he came and he will cry out
[1:19:55] exactly as did the first forerunner he
[1:19:57] will know we will know that because of
[1:19:59] what the next verse says as many as I
[1:20:01] love I rebuke and chasten be zealous
[1:20:02] therefore and repent and we know who he
[1:20:06] was brother William Branham this is the
[1:20:09] same message that John had as he cried
[1:20:11] out to the religious wilderness of
[1:20:13] pharisees sadducees and heathens repent
[1:20:16] there was no other course then there's
[1:20:18] no other course now there was no other
[1:20:20] way to get back to God then and there is
[1:20:22] no other way now it is repent change
[1:20:25] your mind
[1:20:27] turn around repent for why will you die
[1:20:29] there's only one way to be saved
[1:20:32] repent and change your mind never
[1:20:36] understand that that's the only way to
[1:20:40] go to heaven is repent of your sins stop
[1:20:43] thinking that way and change your life
[1:20:45] now we're almost there I'm preaching
[1:20:48] part 6 today it must be a fast message
[1:20:51] because I've spent a lot of time on the
[1:20:52] review as many as I love I rebuke and
[1:20:54] chasten the Prophet described of the
[1:20:55] we're judged by what our hearts did with
[1:20:57] the truth every one of us will be judged
[1:20:59] by what we did with the truth that which
[1:21:02] we heard that which was placed in our
[1:21:03] conscience the blind will also be judged
[1:21:08] because it was their choice to remain
[1:21:10] blind that's what the Bible says the god
[1:21:13] of this world blinded their eyes because
[1:21:15] they love darkness of their God of
[1:21:18] Laodicea more than light they chose to
[1:21:21] be blind they chose that and when people
[1:21:26] loved the world more than they loved
[1:21:28] Christ they're choosing to be blind and
[1:21:32] God will judge them because of that
[1:21:34] because they willingly saw the light but
[1:21:37] they turned down said I don't want to
[1:21:38] come to the light
[1:21:39] I'd rather love sin more never see that
[1:21:45] the only blind who can be saved or those
[1:21:47] who are grant eternal life at the white
[1:21:49] throne judgment because they must have
[1:21:50] had a glimmer of light hey man they must
[1:21:53] have had a little moment where they saw
[1:21:55] the light and they were good to a
[1:21:56] Christian other than that they're
[1:21:58] surprised what do you mean I get eternal
[1:22:00] life what do you mean I didn't do
[1:22:01] anything worthy of eternal life and
[1:22:02] Jesus said yes you did you must forgot
[1:22:04] you and you were good to the Brethren
[1:22:06] you were good to me
[1:22:09] goodness they gave clothes now this has
[1:22:14] to be natural this is not spiritual
[1:22:16] because a sinner cannot give the white
[1:22:18] righteousness of Christ to a saint
[1:22:21] that's why I'm glad all these churches
[1:22:23] are doing closed drives right food
[1:22:25] drives I'm grateful for that
[1:22:27] although they're not gonna get much of a
[1:22:30] reward I would say like that
[1:22:32] see they cared about people's clothes
[1:22:35] who didn't have clothes they gave food
[1:22:38] to the hungry they visited people in the
[1:22:41] hospital they visited the brethren of
[1:22:44] Christ
[1:22:47] Jesus gives them eternal life that's the
[1:22:49] only blind people they're gonna be saved
[1:22:52] the Prophet said hard I'm sorry no the
[1:22:55] Bible says hard unrepentant hearts store
[1:22:58] up the wrath of God against themselves
[1:23:00] for they obey not the truth
[1:23:03] every time they say no I'm not going to
[1:23:05] repair every service they come to said I
[1:23:07] will repent
[1:23:08] I'm gonna keep my bitterness I'm gonna
[1:23:09] keep my cares of the world I'm going to
[1:23:11] keep my lusts of the world all these
[1:23:13] things they're actually storing up for
[1:23:15] themselves
[1:23:15] heaps of wrath we're at the same time
[1:23:18] when we repent
[1:23:19] we're throwing up treasures in heaven oh
[1:23:21] yeah amen Romans 2 states that God has
[1:23:27] written the law upon every heart and our
[1:23:30] conscience is witness to this all men
[1:23:32] are without excuse in the day of
[1:23:33] judgment the Bible said those who have
[1:23:35] the law the Jews or will be judged by
[1:23:37] that law the Bible said those heathens
[1:23:39] who don't have any law already have the
[1:23:41] law in their hearts so every heathen
[1:23:43] every Aboriginal more they'll all be
[1:23:46] judged by the law that God placed in
[1:23:48] their hearts that's Hebrews after Romans
[1:23:50] chapter 2 the one I read this morning
[1:23:51] that's why I knew it was of God had two
[1:23:53] or three witnesses Jesus told the woman
[1:23:55] at the well of her sins including her
[1:23:56] adulteries Jesus then play around with
[1:23:58] people's sins John the Baptist told
[1:24:01] Herod all the evils he had done because
[1:24:06] that's what a true man of God will do
[1:24:07] he'll tell you all the evils you've done
[1:24:10] wrong one more John the Baptist did not
[1:24:16] want to harm Herod and Herodias by
[1:24:17] rebuking them he only wanted to save
[1:24:20] them from the wrath that was to come but
[1:24:22] men of God are always misunderstood and
[1:24:24] he paid for this preaching with his life
[1:24:26] preachers are always misunderstood when
[1:24:28] they're preaching by the Holy Ghost and
[1:24:29] it shucks you like a piece of corn and
[1:24:31] it tears apart all your worldly desires
[1:24:33] and all these things like that they're
[1:24:35] misunderstood they're thinking they're
[1:24:36] picking on me it's the Holy Ghost trying
[1:24:38] to say put the eye salve on your eyes
[1:24:40] put the white garments on take some of
[1:24:43] my gold amen
[1:24:44] have some gold tried in the fire be
[1:24:47] clothed with the righteousness of Christ
[1:24:49] amen
[1:24:50] they're always misunderstood and that's
[1:24:53] because the people are blind they love
[1:24:55] the world more than they love Christ now
[1:24:59] I can start
[1:25:00] part six was that a pretty good review I
[1:25:04] know
[1:25:06] well I knew nobody would remember all
[1:25:07] that so I thought it'd be good cuz I
[1:25:09] didn't remember it
[1:25:10] how many I only thought that was helpful
[1:25:12] by God's grace praise the Lord
[1:25:15] something told me in the car it spoke to
[1:25:17] my heart and it said types of Laodicea
[1:25:21] so I only looked up the types of layer
[1:25:23] to see the first one Jesus's blood is a
[1:25:26] type four layer to see I preached on
[1:25:27] this recently the Bible said Eleazar
[1:25:30] would took the blood of the red heifer
[1:25:33] for the waters of separation he would
[1:25:35] sprinkle at seven times glory and the
[1:25:40] Prophet said see oh if we just had time
[1:25:41] to linger here at the door a few minutes
[1:25:43] what those seven stripes of the door met
[1:25:45] seven ages the seven church a
[1:25:47] dispensation ever every age since
[1:25:49] Genesis to the end of Revelation it's
[1:25:51] been the blood through every age no
[1:25:53] Creed's
[1:25:53] no doctrines no nothing but the blood of
[1:25:56] the Lord Jesus amen so church there's a
[1:26:00] bread for us today amen it's a type now
[1:26:05] just so you know I looked up the the
[1:26:07] fires of the furnace where seven times
[1:26:09] hotter there's 22 hits on that and not
[1:26:11] one of them did he mention Laodicea now
[1:26:13] I know it might be a tight but I just
[1:26:14] used the ones brother Rams specifically
[1:26:17] said and I believe in taking Liberty
[1:26:19] Union you've heard me take Liberty I
[1:26:20] said I believe this is my revelation I
[1:26:22] believe in that but I just wanted this
[1:26:24] morning I just want to show you the
[1:26:25] eight that brother Brad have said
[1:26:27] himself that type out later to see ya
[1:26:31] number two Enoch and also an Enoch also
[1:26:34] the seventh from Adam prophesied of
[1:26:36] these saying behold the Lord cometh with
[1:26:38] ten thousand and the Saints program said
[1:26:42] so Enoch the type of the church here
[1:26:44] he's also typed in the seven churches
[1:26:46] can you think of that the seven church
[1:26:48] age how many believers there's been
[1:26:50] honey breeze there's been seven
[1:26:51] messengers oh we all believe it if we
[1:26:53] believe the Bible if you don't believe
[1:26:54] the Bible of course you don't believe it
[1:26:56] but there has been and now we're living
[1:26:58] in the seven church age and when the
[1:27:00] Bible said that the seven church age
[1:27:01] when the messenger of the seven church
[1:27:03] age begins to sound his message the
[1:27:05] mysteries of all the things that's been
[1:27:07] twisted up down through the age would be
[1:27:09] revealed in that time go here we see it
[1:27:12] the son of man coming among
[1:27:13] people and doing just exactly confirming
[1:27:16] his message as he said he would
[1:27:17] here we find in this last age now that
[1:27:19] was Enoch the seventh which was
[1:27:21] translated and Noah being a type of the
[1:27:23] remnant of the Jews is to be carried
[1:27:25] over hallelujah and Church huh me know
[1:27:28] what sacrificed in Enoch have to make it
[1:27:31] in the rapture blood sacrifice the same
[1:27:36] sacrifice Abraham had the same sacrifice
[1:27:39] Noah had they all had the same sacrifice
[1:27:42] but somebody had a calling for the
[1:27:44] rapture
[1:27:45] the difference was Enoch had a
[1:27:47] predestinated call he had a
[1:27:49] predestinated invitation to go to the
[1:27:51] rapture and his sacrifice was sufficient
[1:27:55] to take him in the rapture a man and so
[1:27:58] is our sacrifice the bread of Jesus
[1:28:00] Christ sufficient to take you and I in
[1:28:02] the rapture Amen hallelujah amen thank
[1:28:07] you Jesus a common farmer a common
[1:28:10] nobody he just said I'm gonna walk with
[1:28:13] Jesus Christ all the days of my life and
[1:28:15] pretty soon he started taking a heavenly
[1:28:17] March pretty soon he started going
[1:28:19] higher in heavenly places and brother
[1:28:21] Aaron said the father looked over and
[1:28:22] said can I take a walk with you today
[1:28:24] I'd like you to take your home today and
[1:28:26] brother Ram said Enoch said can I say
[1:28:28] goodbye to my wife and children first he
[1:28:32] was willing to leave behind everybody so
[1:28:34] he could take a heavenly rock and church
[1:28:36] we got to be like that too willing to
[1:28:38] leave behind any sin any person that
[1:28:40] won't separate themselves and take the
[1:28:42] white robes we've got to walk away from
[1:28:44] them put on the white robes and walk up
[1:28:47] with Jesus Laurie thank you lord
[1:28:51] ah the third one Israel's three stages
[1:28:56] to the promised land by the RAM did you
[1:28:58] know this I didn't know this I forgot
[1:29:00] this Ram said the taking the promised
[1:29:04] land was the third stage after coming
[1:29:08] out of Egypt and brother Ram typed those
[1:29:10] three stages to the last three Church
[1:29:11] ages Luther Wesley Elijah Branham now
[1:29:16] have the scripture here where they came
[1:29:17] through the wilderness and I give it and
[1:29:19] they go into a land that flows with milk
[1:29:20] and honey the Prophet said everything in
[1:29:22] the Old Testament type the new now as
[1:29:25] Israel made our journey going to the
[1:29:26] promised land had three stage
[1:29:27] the journey coming out of Egypt Cadis
[1:29:29] Bernina the judgment crossing in the
[1:29:31] promised land and that's just exactly
[1:29:33] the three churches after the dark age of
[1:29:37] three churches then the next come to
[1:29:39] Philadelphia then the next layer to see
[1:29:41] us then she crosses over beautiful oh
[1:29:44] how that God in the old days when the
[1:29:47] pillar flower was hanging over the top a
[1:29:49] camp of Israel they watch that how many
[1:29:51] when we preached on Joshua last summer
[1:29:52] and I showed you by the grace of God the
[1:29:55] seven enemies you got a fight when
[1:29:57] you're in the land once we get victory
[1:30:00] over those seven enemies guess what then
[1:30:01] we have peace then we have millennium
[1:30:05] honey I Amen where we got to get victory
[1:30:08] over those seven nations hallelujah
[1:30:11] after we get in the promised land and
[1:30:14] God will do it by His amazing grace
[1:30:16] hallelujah Oh glory the days of Ahab
[1:30:21] Jezebel denied you were type he have saw
[1:30:24] Elijah said art he that troubleth Israel
[1:30:26] he said no sir I'm not troubled Israel
[1:30:28] but now that father's house because
[1:30:31] you've forsaken the commandments of the
[1:30:32] Lord to see they had Elijah that was
[1:30:35] rebuking the leaders for their day so
[1:30:37] have we had Elijah that's rebuked the
[1:30:39] governments of this day now this
[1:30:42] Jehoshaphat feeling kind of good because
[1:30:44] he was a great king of Israel said come
[1:30:45] visit me went down there they took an ox
[1:30:47] and sheep and done sacrifice all the
[1:30:49] time in a Habs heart down there he was a
[1:30:52] deceiver because he was not worshiping
[1:30:55] that or offering those sheep and things
[1:30:56] with a true heart because after all he
[1:30:58] leaned more on his wife's religion hey
[1:31:00] man I'll preponderating arms of Christ
[1:31:04] religion we must lead upon the blood of
[1:31:08] Jesus Christ not upon the churches and
[1:31:10] famous churches and denominations and
[1:31:13] mega churches we're not leaning on that
[1:31:15] we're leaning on the bloody bleeding
[1:31:17] word of the message of the hour amen
[1:31:19] hallelujah that's what we're leaning on
[1:31:22] today see a have liens on his previous
[1:31:24] church worldly idolatrous Jezebel
[1:31:27] religion or don't lean upon your
[1:31:31] denominations thoughts lean upon this
[1:31:33] thus saith the Lord message God has
[1:31:35] given to us amen
[1:31:37] that's what I'm leaning upon hallelujah
[1:31:41] and notice just as they have married
[1:31:43] just about during the time that great
[1:31:45] Dark Age visionary brought idolatry into
[1:31:47] Israel a very type of today see a type
[1:31:51] just in the Dark Age where we come out
[1:31:52] through the early apostles second round
[1:31:55] third round over to the Dark Age the
[1:31:56] fifteen hundred years just as a have
[1:31:58] married Jezebel idolatry in Israel so
[1:32:01] did the Holy Ghost Church marrying two
[1:32:04] isms and brought idolatry back and we
[1:32:07] must be careful we don't worship William
[1:32:09] Branham we must be careful we don't
[1:32:11] worship pastors in the message or
[1:32:14] evangelist and exalt them and think
[1:32:18] they're so holy remember that's the seed
[1:32:20] of Nicoli anism to separate the
[1:32:23] preachers from the people but see the
[1:32:24] thing is you've got to participate in
[1:32:27] worship amen if I was out with the
[1:32:29] anointing on me I've got to participate
[1:32:31] in worship and if you want the anointing
[1:32:33] on you you've got to be a participant in
[1:32:35] the service amen now just sit back and
[1:32:38] do nothing but when you've got the Holy
[1:32:39] Ghost on you you have a part in the
[1:32:41] service amen you are participating
[1:32:44] you're enjoying it you're feeling
[1:32:46] convicted you're rejoicing in it you're
[1:32:48] getting strength from it why because
[1:32:50] you're filled with the Holy Ghost amen
[1:32:52] you participate in what God's doing amen
[1:32:54] all right thank you Jesus
[1:32:59] see it's a form of Christianity just
[1:33:02] very dark and now it's moved on down
[1:33:05] each day each church age moved downs
[1:33:07] that same thing to the great climax till
[1:33:09] the lukewarm condition comes a lukewarm
[1:33:11] Laodicean Church age it's all moving
[1:33:15] down
[1:33:15] what a horrible hour that we're living
[1:33:17] in November it's the most glorious and
[1:33:18] the most awful time it's both it's
[1:33:21] glorious for the believer awful for the
[1:33:23] unbeliever number five I'm going to
[1:33:25] eight and I'm almost done now I preach
[1:33:29] less than an hour today
[1:33:30] well maybe I'll extend a little bit just
[1:33:32] to meet my hour John twelve why was not
[1:33:36] this ointment sold for three hundred
[1:33:37] pence and given to the poor then he said
[1:33:39] not that he cared for the poor but
[1:33:42] because he was a thief and had the bag
[1:33:45] and bear what was put in the bag see
[1:33:50] when
[1:33:51] we need to care what the money spent on
[1:33:53] right but Judas didn't really care how
[1:33:56] the money was spent he wanted to have
[1:33:57] control the money so he could be
[1:33:59] benefited by the money praise God that's
[1:34:03] right
[1:34:03] look a brother who said Oh your
[1:34:05] identification could you be identified
[1:34:07] with the group that Judas was in he
[1:34:08] started to walk with Jesus he started
[1:34:11] out all right
[1:34:11] like the Pentecostals did years ago but
[1:34:15] the very thing they come out of the
[1:34:16] organization your mothers and fathers
[1:34:18] this young group has turned right back
[1:34:19] and made them one just like they come
[1:34:22] out of see what a type I'm sorry what
[1:34:24] type of group are you with now the Bible
[1:34:27] said the lancing Church a Judas you know
[1:34:29] carried he saw the possibilities are
[1:34:31] getting something great with what he had
[1:34:32] he was identified with Jesus so he
[1:34:35] thought with that he carried the bag he
[1:34:37] can make some extra money by selling him
[1:34:39] for thirty pieces of silver you know I
[1:34:42] can make money off this message I can
[1:34:45] make a few extra dollars off it and be
[1:34:48] disloyal to it I won't keep all the
[1:34:50] message I'll just keep most of it for
[1:34:52] three and a half years or hover I'll
[1:34:53] just keep it for a few years but when I
[1:34:55] can make some money off this message
[1:34:57] I'll make some money and go against the
[1:35:00] Word of God the Prophet said that's not
[1:35:06] somewhat not a little bit that's exactly
[1:35:10] what the layer of seeing church age did
[1:35:15] the Bible said so you are rich and
[1:35:17] increased you say I've increased I've
[1:35:19] got plenty of goods I have need of
[1:35:21] nothing and you don't know that you're
[1:35:22] wretched miserable blind naked and don't
[1:35:23] know it
[1:35:24] that's Pentecostal the last church age
[1:35:26] not Luthor not Wesley but Pentecostals
[1:35:28] that's the church hey does that help by
[1:35:30] God's grace all these churches that have
[1:35:33] been vomited out there on the level of
[1:35:35] Judas because they're so concerned about
[1:35:38] money but it's not money for the Gospels
[1:35:40] sake it's money for their sink like
[1:35:44] remember that quote I showed brother
[1:35:45] Graham brother Ram said if I had 100
[1:35:46] million dollars what would he do would
[1:35:47] he build a church he said I would he
[1:35:51] said I would take campaigns around the
[1:35:53] world and get the bride ready for the
[1:35:54] rapture his idea of money was going out
[1:35:58] to have services just go have services
[1:36:01] with people that don't have services
[1:36:03] now nothing wrong if you Birdman also
[1:36:05] says nothing wrong with building a
[1:36:07] building after coming allured hito is
[1:36:08] but we gotta examine ourselves do we
[1:36:13] think money is going to save the world
[1:36:15] or do we think holy ghost preaching is
[1:36:17] gonna save the world well we know anyone
[1:36:19] that can be saved it's gonna be few but
[1:36:21] they're gonna be saved by Holy Ghost
[1:36:22] preaching money does not say the world
[1:36:24] coz Peter said silver and gold have I
[1:36:26] none such as I have give I unto you so
[1:36:30] we can't focus on money it's got to be
[1:36:32] power we got to focus on the power of
[1:36:34] Christ I'm almost done this is this is
[1:36:41] my text now we're very familiar with
[1:36:44] this likewise also as was in days of lot
[1:36:46] they did eat they drank they bought they
[1:36:47] sold they planted they builded but the
[1:36:49] same day that lot went out of Sodom it
[1:36:51] rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:36:52] and destroyed them all even thou shalt
[1:36:56] be in the day when the Son of Man is
[1:36:58] revealed the prophet speaking of Abraham
[1:37:00] and lot and Abraham did not represent
[1:37:03] any of those he was not a city he was
[1:37:06] looking for a kingdom uh-huh and he had
[1:37:07] a group with him and there was one of
[1:37:09] the three that stayed behind and showed
[1:37:11] him a sign of who he was with his back
[1:37:13] turn of the tent and know what Sarah
[1:37:15] said in the tent our discernment of
[1:37:17] spirit Jesus plainly saying now remember
[1:37:19] there was not one more sign done until
[1:37:21] Sodom was burned the last thing that the
[1:37:23] church is going to see is Christ
[1:37:24] manifested in his power in fulness in
[1:37:27] his church just before the fire Falls
[1:37:34] remember a lot was the one the fire the
[1:37:39] fire fell from the sky not not back in
[1:37:41] the days of Noah the water came but
[1:37:43] Christ Express what type of ministry
[1:37:45] would be in the days of lot and now we
[1:37:48] see the holy spirit moving among his
[1:37:50] church in the same manner we find it in
[1:37:52] the lair sink addition just as it was
[1:37:55] there sorry
[1:37:57] Abraham lived in a Laodicean condition
[1:38:00] but he overcame by separating himself by
[1:38:05] training his entire house he trained
[1:38:07] them to be faithful to the mysteries of
[1:38:10] God amen
[1:38:13] and God said I'll reveal to him the
[1:38:15] secret said to come because
[1:38:17] no he'll train his family I know they'll
[1:38:20] train his children about the message of
[1:38:21] the hour and that's what all of us
[1:38:23] parents should be doing train them about
[1:38:25] the truths in the message of the hour
[1:38:27] that's what Abraham did show them the
[1:38:30] mystery of marriage in divorce
[1:38:31] show the mystery of rapture the mystery
[1:38:35] of the Gentile dispensation we must show
[1:38:36] them these mysteries because Abraham
[1:38:39] seed loves the mysteries lot didn't have
[1:38:42] those Laden understand him Loretta said
[1:38:45] he forgot about the promised son he
[1:38:47] forgot about the rapture he was so
[1:38:50] caught up in love in Sodom that all the
[1:38:53] riches and everything there he forgot
[1:38:54] about the rapture it just became like a
[1:38:57] thought used to have a former thought
[1:38:59] used to think about the wrath Abraham
[1:39:01] used to talk about the rapture Abraham
[1:39:04] lived in the Laodicean condition in that
[1:39:06] beautiful oh my that's glorious
[1:39:10] Dorne adore the church spiritual was not
[1:39:13] in there in the beginning Pentecostal
[1:39:15] type watch that messenger come back to
[1:39:17] the church
[1:39:18] the speaking of when God came in flesh
[1:39:20] to Abraham his tent he set and talked to
[1:39:23] Abraham he said where is your wife Sarah
[1:39:25] he said Abraham which his name was Abram
[1:39:28] where is your wife Sarah remember her
[1:39:30] name was SAR RA and now it's sa RA H
[1:39:34] she's in the tent behind you behind you
[1:39:36] he said I'm going to visit you according
[1:39:38] time of life he said why did Sarah laugh
[1:39:41] when I said that there he is why would
[1:39:43] it be we got to have a spirit like that
[1:39:46] visit the church a spirit of prophetic a
[1:39:49] spirit of discernment and when it comes
[1:39:51] in the people refuse it why it's a
[1:39:55] Laodicea
[1:39:57] we're so documented with Creed's and
[1:39:59] things till we can't accept it that's
[1:40:01] right see I stand at the door and knock
[1:40:04] any man hears my voice you see that
[1:40:06] Sarah didn't want to hear the voice at
[1:40:08] first but aren't you glad later she did
[1:40:10] the Bible said she received strength to
[1:40:13] conceive seed amen she lied to God's
[1:40:16] face she didn't believe it at first she
[1:40:19] rejected it in her later seeing
[1:40:21] condition but God woke that bride up a
[1:40:24] man and she received strength to bring
[1:40:27] forth the promised son oh god wake us up
[1:40:30] amen
[1:40:30] wake us up get us eyes that see ears
[1:40:33] that hear go give us white raiment help
[1:40:36] us to see in here and receive strength
[1:40:38] for the body change amen hallelujah he
[1:40:47] said all my faith don't accept those
[1:40:48] things he's then you got the wrong faith
[1:40:50] that faith though you know the real
[1:40:52] genuine faith will punctuate every
[1:40:54] promise of God with an amen a genuine
[1:40:56] Holy Spirit why because the Holy Spirit
[1:40:58] the Bible yes amen how could the Holy
[1:41:05] Spirit be in you and you deny the Word
[1:41:06] of God you can't do it it's impossible
[1:41:09] number seven this is what I was so
[1:41:12] struck me when I heard this yesterday I
[1:41:13] sent Simon and cam and brother Brian
[1:41:15] Hawkins a text saying have you ever
[1:41:17] heard this quote before I was shocked
[1:41:20] then jesus beholding him the rich young
[1:41:23] ruler loved him and sent him one thing
[1:41:25] thou lackest go thy way sell whatever
[1:41:27] thou hast and give it to the poor and
[1:41:29] thou shalt have treasure in heaven and
[1:41:31] come take up the cross and follow me and
[1:41:34] he was sad at that saying and went away
[1:41:37] grieve from church for he had great
[1:41:40] possessions the only way I want to leave
[1:41:45] Church grieved is I want to leave grieve
[1:41:47] for lost souls
[1:41:48] I don't wanna leave grieve because I'm
[1:41:51] not willing to do what Jesus asked me to
[1:41:53] do does that mean is that clear all the
[1:41:57] only one I want to be grieved I want say
[1:41:58] all I want to see so saved all these
[1:42:03] abominations and accra just grieve me
[1:42:05] all the abominations in Albion they just
[1:42:07] grieve me I want to see somebody fill
[1:42:10] with the Holy Ghost amen
[1:42:12] I want to see a sinner weep their way to
[1:42:14] the cross that's the only grieve and I
[1:42:17] want to leave with when I leave church
[1:42:20] but see the Richard rule he left grieve
[1:42:22] because he knew he couldn't keep the
[1:42:23] word oh I could not leave with that I
[1:42:25] could not live with that preacher said I
[1:42:27] think I'm just going to keep investing
[1:42:28] in my money I'll just keep investing in
[1:42:30] my business my Bramson he was a
[1:42:31] businessman and because that the church
[1:42:35] has turned down the Holy Spirit east
[1:42:37] days it's increased look at this the
[1:42:40] church has turned down Christ and
[1:42:41] actually got more popular
[1:42:44] and now you're going to ecumenical
[1:42:46] councils just exactly what the Bible
[1:42:47] said you would do
[1:42:48] now you're really later to see a rich
[1:42:49] and increasing Goods just exactly like
[1:42:51] the young man was he was a type of the
[1:42:53] church rejecting Paul was a type of the
[1:42:58] one receiving both of them had the
[1:43:01] opportunity as you have tonight as I
[1:43:04] have the rich young ruler increased in
[1:43:08] goods he got more rich so as the church
[1:43:11] the leaders in church age increasing
[1:43:12] goods I remember he got so great to
[1:43:14] become so popular to even the Monarchs
[1:43:16] the great people begin to come and he
[1:43:18] had a great banquet one time now here's
[1:43:21] the call that struck me this man was
[1:43:26] religious he was by no means an infidel
[1:43:28] he had been taught by his mother how to
[1:43:30] do right how to walk how to dress
[1:43:32] himself he'd been taught by his father a
[1:43:34] great businessman how to be a successful
[1:43:36] businessman and his business was
[1:43:38] successful and father mother raised him
[1:43:42] up in the church and pointed to be up to
[1:43:43] the priest and the priest and made him a
[1:43:44] real religious man there was a fine
[1:43:46] culture man he was a fine boy with good
[1:43:48] character and that's that's the word
[1:43:51] that struck me yesterday his character
[1:43:54] was outstanding people say well I want
[1:43:58] godly character well that's that's good
[1:44:00] that though that just being what that's
[1:44:02] just wanting to be like the rich young
[1:44:03] ruler though we've got to say God finish
[1:44:06] the character in me
[1:44:08] he started with good character but he
[1:44:12] didn't finish with the right character
[1:44:15] and he wasn't brother man he wasn't
[1:44:17] playing around either he really loved
[1:44:18] God he tried to serve God if Jesus
[1:44:22] Christ looked at him and loved him
[1:44:24] there must have been something about the
[1:44:25] boy that was real look he had a real
[1:44:28] love for God he said what must I do to
[1:44:30] inherit eternal life
[1:44:32] and Jesus and the brother man said he
[1:44:34] had love he was real Jesus looked at him
[1:44:38] and loved him he had real character it
[1:44:40] wasn't a put-on in other words he was
[1:44:42] saying I won't commit adultery against
[1:44:44] my wife I won't lie to my neighbor I
[1:44:46] will not bear false witness I will keep
[1:44:49] the commands of God and he had real
[1:44:51] character
[1:44:57] there must have been something real
[1:44:58] outstanding about this young man he was
[1:45:00] a good character and a good character
[1:45:02] rating if you could rate him he was one
[1:45:03] he was near the top he was a man that
[1:45:09] was raised right intellectual smart
[1:45:10] successful business religious man he had
[1:45:13] a lot of good characteristics that was
[1:45:14] outstanding think about that he never
[1:45:17] broke the Ten Commandments never we're
[1:45:20] talking about one who had character here
[1:45:23] we're talking about can I say like this
[1:45:25] we're talking about someone who had
[1:45:27] victory because character is a it's not
[1:45:30] a gift brother Adam he wasn't born with
[1:45:32] the gift brother John he wasn't born
[1:45:33] with the gift for character he he had
[1:45:36] the victories he knew what it was like
[1:45:39] to get a victory
[1:45:40] oh the the priest read the Torah today I
[1:45:42] got the victory and he would walk out
[1:45:46] for the Jose with the victory character
[1:45:50] comes by victories and even a try
[1:45:57] of Jesus Christ the Savior but when he
[1:46:00] was confronted being successful in all
[1:46:01] these other things and he was as
[1:46:04] religious as can be because Jesus and
[1:46:06] questioning here he said I've cut these
[1:46:07] Commandments observed them off from my
[1:46:09] youth and here's a little here's the one
[1:46:13] that shocked me so he'd been brought up
[1:46:14] right taught right but when he was
[1:46:16] confronted with the thought of eternal
[1:46:18] life now once you notice with all this
[1:46:20] character I heard that I thought what I
[1:46:23] was driving yesterday what I driving
[1:46:25] home from church from study I'm like oh
[1:46:27] this character that's the thing that we
[1:46:30] want because we're not taking our
[1:46:31] clothes with us we're not taking our
[1:46:33] Bibles with us
[1:46:34] we're only taking our what that's all
[1:46:37] we're taking with us and he had all this
[1:46:39] character but what he do the Bible said
[1:46:43] it all got burned up right he sacrificed
[1:46:47] all this character he had such godly
[1:46:49] habits can you imagine he was so golly
[1:46:51] he never committed adultery he never
[1:46:53] lied he never worshiped any false God he
[1:46:56] never took the name of the Lord he never
[1:46:57] cussed and he had all this victory and
[1:47:01] at the moment when Jesus said sell out
[1:47:04] everything so give all your money away
[1:47:06] and follow me he dumped all this
[1:47:09] character like it went it went to the
[1:47:11] trash can he dumped all this godly real
[1:47:14] character in the trash can he said I'm
[1:47:16] gonna just try to be rich then and he
[1:47:19] walked away from being a pasal of Jesus
[1:47:21] Christ for what money he traded all this
[1:47:25] character for this little sin of money
[1:47:27] but member that sin will grow up sin is
[1:47:30] like a seed - it'll grow up I'll take
[1:47:32] you further than you want to go and
[1:47:35] ultimately strangle your life like it'll
[1:47:37] choke your life and that's what it did
[1:47:39] it started as a he's had a little seed
[1:47:40] of of a greed for money and he gave up
[1:47:43] all this gold all this godly character
[1:47:45] he put in the trash can I said well fine
[1:47:47] I'll just try to I can't live with that
[1:47:49] preacher saying I'll just plant this
[1:47:51] little seed of greed in my heart and it
[1:47:53] grew up and strangled his life where he
[1:47:56] had no life for Christ then so what's
[1:48:00] the state of your current character your
[1:48:03] past character Church it might have been
[1:48:04] real oh my look at this sisters look all
[1:48:07] all these years she lived live godly
[1:48:08] character but you've got to keep that
[1:48:10] character going thank God for your past
[1:48:14] victories thank God for all the gold but
[1:48:16] you can sell out the gold of your
[1:48:18] character just like the rich young ruler
[1:48:19] just like Judas did you've got to keep
[1:48:23] the victory I don't know yeah you've got
[1:48:27] to receive the end of your faith that's
[1:48:32] why that's why it's so important here
[1:48:33] what is Christ asking you to do today
[1:48:35] I'm not asking you to look back and say
[1:48:37] oh thank God you obeyed him I'm glad you
[1:48:40] obeyed him back there what is he asking
[1:48:41] you to do today because that's that's
[1:48:43] that's where the rich young ruler fell
[1:48:45] he obeyed everything in the past he had
[1:48:47] victory over custody he had Vicky only
[1:48:50] said the name of Lord was hallow it's
[1:48:52] holy
[1:48:53] he never costs the name of God but when
[1:48:56] it came down to greed he poured all of
[1:49:00] his golden to the gold of God and the
[1:49:01] spiritual trash can and he went after
[1:49:04] money went after fame popularity a very
[1:49:08] perfect type of the Laodicean Church age
[1:49:10] today the message of the hour asked you
[1:49:13] to give up money ask you to give up a
[1:49:14] job for Christ asked you to give up
[1:49:16] financial blessings for Christ and
[1:49:18] sacrifice of her Christ are we listening
[1:49:20] with the Holy Spirit sang or not I don't
[1:49:23] care how much character you've had in
[1:49:24] the past you've got to keep that
[1:49:26] character and obey the Word of God look
[1:49:29] at that it's just struck me that's why
[1:49:31] Jesus was asking him to be an apostle
[1:49:33] because look at the character he had
[1:49:35] amen
[1:49:36] jeez don't ask anybody to have it be an
[1:49:38] apostle he asked people that are called
[1:49:40] to be an apostle he had such character
[1:49:44] and the potential to be a mighty apostle
[1:49:46] like Paul but he sold it out for money
[1:49:50] and greed so that's why it's so
[1:49:54] important what is Christ asking us to
[1:49:56] sell out I just had a dream last night I
[1:49:58] know I've got to seek him more for I got
[1:50:01] to see more of Christ I said brother
[1:50:04] branham what's what's wrong with the
[1:50:06] church I'll conquer the church how can
[1:50:08] the church improve and he said you've
[1:50:09] got to seek God more
[1:50:12] I don't want my character to stop today
[1:50:18] I want my character to improve
[1:50:19] I don't want less victories I don't want
[1:50:23] to get a relaxed life a soft living
[1:50:24] I want more victories in Christ I know
[1:50:27] what it says it's gonna require more
[1:50:29] sacrifice number eight
[1:50:32] let's stand our feet I'm gonna just
[1:50:33] finish with this one it's about less
[1:50:35] than an hour oh I'm sorry okay yeah less
[1:50:39] than an hour and a half that's what I'm
[1:50:40] thinking okay forgive me I always think
[1:50:43] it's an hour is actually a her and a
[1:50:45] half when I get the one o'clock and I'm
[1:50:46] still preaching the eighth and fight now
[1:50:51] this is what I found out if you find
[1:50:52] more quotes help me up I looked at I
[1:50:54] think there was 22 or actually plus the
[1:50:55] ten where there was 32 total cuz I
[1:50:58] looked up different words like
[1:50:59] representing Leo to see a type layer to
[1:51:01] SIA and this is the eighth and final one
[1:51:07] that I have for today
[1:51:08] have you been blessed today Church I
[1:51:11] hope you've had all this character but I
[1:51:14] hope you want more character and you
[1:51:17] have to hear what is Christ asking me to
[1:51:19] do today am I willing to sacrifice that
[1:51:22] more character today
[1:51:23] what's my ministry today that's why I've
[1:51:25] always had a burden for that everybody
[1:51:27] needs to have a ministry of some sort
[1:51:30] what is he asking you to give today the
[1:51:35] character of the past is powerful but
[1:51:37] we've got to build upon that character
[1:51:38] and not sell it out the eighth and final
[1:51:43] one was brother BAM said David was a
[1:51:46] fugitive in 2nd Samuel my through 23 he
[1:51:52] was a fugitive to his own City
[1:51:54] buh-bam said like Christ is a fugitive
[1:51:57] fugitive to his own church he was kicked
[1:52:00] out on the outside looking in and let me
[1:52:05] read this quote here this is the only
[1:52:09] one I'd
[1:52:09] didn't have time to really get up there
[1:52:11] well you know I'll just skipped I'll
[1:52:13] just read this what a type of today
[1:52:16] Christ effusion you say Christ is a
[1:52:18] fugitive according to the Bible God has
[1:52:22] gallantly taken us through these seven
[1:52:23] Church ages
[1:52:24] this latest see in church Christ was a
[1:52:27] fugitive outside of his church rejected
[1:52:29] trying to get back into the church see
[1:52:33] he's a fugitive to his own church and
[1:52:35] the reason he's a fugitive is because he
[1:52:39] was the word and they won't let the word
[1:52:43] in they've accepted Creed's instead and
[1:52:47] we find out that in this great struggle
[1:52:48] those gallant man around around David
[1:52:50] were Gentiles oh can we give the Lord a
[1:52:54] round of applause amen hallelujah
[1:52:56] oh my and you know the court probably
[1:53:01] program said and even why the least of
[1:53:05] Jesus's thoughts was a command to the
[1:53:09] Gentile people so it is today the least
[1:53:13] of Jesus's thoughts or how about his
[1:53:16] word should be a command to the Gentiles
[1:53:19] who love him how many love the Lord
[1:53:21] Jesus we've got to love him we've got to
[1:53:28] love Jesus Christ with all of our hearts
[1:53:31] if he's asking us to give up anything
[1:53:34] I believe he asked me last night to give
[1:53:36] up something I'm not even quite sure
[1:53:38] honestly at this point when I supposed
[1:53:40] to give up but I'm gonna seek him and
[1:53:42] I'm gonna pray it ask God Lord what must
[1:53:44] I give up to seek you more I didn't know
[1:53:48] how much more I could give up but I've
[1:53:51] got to seek Him to do that because I
[1:53:54] want to I want to see the church succeed
[1:53:56] don't you
[1:53:57] now remember Church we have your you
[1:53:59] have the choice everybody here's a
[1:54:00] choice you're gonna make this church go
[1:54:02] like this higher and higher and higher
[1:54:03] or it's gonna drop down every church
[1:54:07] every Church has that albian you know
[1:54:10] Sheffield Lorraine every Church it's the
[1:54:14] people's choice in my choice we're all
[1:54:16] choosing our church is either and
[1:54:17] they'll keep going up after struggles
[1:54:18] and struggle and struggles or it's gonna
[1:54:20] turn down Jesus and go down and down
[1:54:23] I've got a choice how many know that you
[1:54:27] have a choice - that's just bow our
[1:54:29] heads let me just ask you for a moment
[1:54:33] here I'm thankful for the character I
[1:54:40] see in the people of this church I tell
[1:54:44] my wife and I you know we talking I say
[1:54:47] thank God for the people that support
[1:54:48] the church with all they have I'm so
[1:54:50] thankful for the character it's such a
[1:54:53] blessing to me to know that God placed
[1:54:56] me here in Akron and there's people that
[1:54:58] supported a hundred percent I appreciate
[1:55:01] that I appreciate that very much and I
[1:55:08] thank God for the godly character of the
[1:55:10] Saints but I feel we've got to give more
[1:55:16] for Christ our character the past thank
[1:55:21] God for those victories but I believe
[1:55:23] Jesus wants to have a more victory today
[1:55:25] I mean would say amen to that
[1:55:27] I appreciate the character
[1:55:31] I appreciate the daily devotion and
[1:55:35] sacrifice for the gospel I wonder
[1:55:39] through that dream if the Lord doesn't
[1:55:40] ask in myself and the church maybe he's
[1:55:44] not asking you to seek him more I don't
[1:55:46] know I just don't see how that's
[1:55:47] biblical if he's not asking you to seek
[1:55:49] him more as me the pastor as well to
[1:55:52] seek him more how many wanna only raise
[1:55:56] your hands say Lord I want to find you
[1:55:57] more in my life I'm gonna bless those
[1:55:59] hands because memory said if you want to
[1:56:01] find me you got to seek me with all
[1:56:04] search let me pray for you please pray
[1:56:06] for me pray for one another let's just
[1:56:07] raise our hands because maybe some of us
[1:56:09] can raise our hands and lift up holy
[1:56:10] hands to God
[1:56:11] Heavenly Father our holy hands are
[1:56:13] lifted up thank you for the character of
[1:56:16] this church or not to tell my wife and I
[1:56:19] Lord I tell you thank you for the
[1:56:21] character the people who support this
[1:56:23] church we couldn't have it without them
[1:56:26] there would be no message Church in
[1:56:29] Akron sure could if it wasn't for the
[1:56:32] character of the people Lord to support
[1:56:33] it with their ties offerings there
[1:56:36] I'm there amens their sacrifice on the
[1:56:40] roads how they staying clean now they
[1:56:44] stay in new things

[1:57:00] to have more character help us not to
[1:57:04] quit elbows not to turn and walk away

[1:57:12] us to do Lord I know you're asking me to
[1:57:14] seek you more Lord Jesus thank you for
[1:57:24] that visitation Lord last night I just
[1:57:26] believe it was I don't see how the devil
[1:57:28] would ever say seek Christ more you're
[1:57:31] not seeking Christ in them I believe
[1:57:34] that was the Holy Spirit but I've always
[1:57:39] wanted to live in the days of brother
[1:57:40] Branham Lord God and just be around his
[1:57:42] ministry and I felt like in that little
[1:57:45] dream Lord you give me an opportunity to
