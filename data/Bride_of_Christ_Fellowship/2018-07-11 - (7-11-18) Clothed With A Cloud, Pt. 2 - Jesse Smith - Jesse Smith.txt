[Applause] [Music] thank you honest and our feet in that beautiful the Bible says singing the Lord for it's calmly Amen its pleasant to sing unto the Lord what a sweet refreshing anointing their praise God let's take our Bibles here and let's go to Revelation chapter 10 verse 1 by God's grace I want to continue that little thought from Sunday morning about clothes with the cloud I want to keep going on that thought by God's grace revelation 10 verse 1 we're very familiar with revelation 10 7 but I believe revelation 10 1 was fulfilled in February in March of 1963 I just happen to believe that I'm crazy enough I should say I'm anointed enough to believe that I'll say like that the world will call me crazy but I'm anointed in God's eyes amen to recognize that God sent a prophet in this day amen and I want to I've just been felt burdened to do that you know as you're turning there you know I had a I had a couple from Florida contact me and they said brother Jess how do you explain the cloud you know our children are kind of coming against the cloud and and I've been talking about the Jose about the cloud for years and I thought I need to preach us someday so that happened last week and then I just kept studying on it studying on I'm just gonna preach it this with this Sunday and so if you didn't get a chance to listen that I think you'd enjoy that from Sunday morning close with the cloud to show how God did vindicate our prophet by bringing that cloud in 1963 and so I got some good feedback on I was very happy a blessed people some people sent me some videos and some texts just saying what a blessing it was so that that makes it all worth it you know by God's grace when you know the Word of God has blessed someone it's met a need that they had in their heart answered questions we just say thank you Holy Spirit for helping the people praise God revelation 10 verse 1 let's read it together on three one two three and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his feet were as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire amen I'm sorry I said that wrong his face was as it were the Sun not his feet forgive me let's just bow our heads in word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart just make it known in to God here tonight Heavenly Father Lord we just come to you again now Lord after we've worshiped you it's our joy all of our soul sings to you Lord our hearts are prepared to hear the word now father we just pray let your word speak to us and let it fall on ears that can hear let it fall on hearts that will obey and and hearts that will worship and receive it and rejoice it in Oh God bless us father Lord by the end of the service we'll know our hearts have burned and you fed us up from the manna from heaven Lord just used me use the people Lord to accomplish what you desired for this service here tonight we'll be careful to give you all the praise and glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name and everybody said amen god bless she's being seated praise the Lord I would like to just start with a just a brief review so Malachi whenever you're ready can switch over there I just went to a brief review and today I had Lydia while I was on the drive ahead Lydia read a chapter in this book it's a great book if you never had this Acts of the Prophet by Perry Greene there's over three hundred thousand copies in the world it's a great testimony of his interactions with brother Branham I think he knew program for 15 years I think and it's just a beautiful book my family's read and my family finished the church age book so we're grateful boy they just we're busy readers you know and so we're very thankful we finished the whole Bible we finished a church age book and now we're going to Acts of the Prophet I'm not sure what's after that maybe we'll do the seven seals I don't know that's that's a bit more difficult kind of read because it's not edited but the children just kind of they're really flown through that so but if you if you need a copy that let me know I'll buy you a copy I mean that's what the ministry is here for if you need church age books take them if you need books take them whatever you need let me know if you don't have the money I'll help you out by God's grace that's why we're here we're here to help feed the flock of God many ways there's a whole chapter in here on the cloud and most of it was familiar to me but a few things I'll add you know to this little message here today but let's look at our text here oh I forgot to read the other one okay but we'll get to that eventually that's okay we'll get to that one I forgot to read that when I was just in the thought of worshipping you know in Revelation 10:1 so let's just review from Sunday morning just real quick I just got a few slides there was a cloud pictured over flagstaff on February 28 1963 and it was a supernatural manifestation of Jesus Christ the cloud was formed by seven angels and the cloud fulfilled Revelation 10:1 which was important because it led to the filling of Revelation 10 7c brother branham couldn't finish the mystery of God without meeting the angels who commissioned him to go back east open up the seven seals amen and take the seven seals off of the book of God or the revelation of Jesus Christ amen and based on the evidence the cloud must have appeared twice one time it appeared publicly over Flagstaff on February 28th and then a second time it appeared to brother Branham privately on either March seventh or March depending on who you talk to now the critics brought up four main accusations against the cloud being a legitimate sign from God but I showed how they're wrong on all four issues remember it was prophecy and location and timing and I can't remember the other one but we looked at that on Sunday like I said if you're interested in this I would encourage you to listen to that one but we saw three examples from the Bible of people being public witnesses of the supernatural remember there was Paul when he was got knocked down by the light there was witnesses around there Jesus spoke and a thunder you know the what God spoke to him and it was heard as a thunder and there was one more I can't remember the third one and others did not but I'm sorry some still did not believe and others did not receive the full experience as others the third one was Jesus after he raised it resurrected five hundred people saw him at one time his eleven apostles saw him at one time some people believe some people did it so it just proves that you and I can't force anybody believe their heart has to be open to believe and that's the fact that's where brother that's where the Bible gets predestination from God cannot pre to predestiny one until first by foreknowledge he knows what they're going to choose then when he know if since he already knows what they're gonna choose then the Bible said he can predestinate he can ordain everything in their lives to work out for their good because they love God amen because God's not gonna force anybody to love him he's never he's a he's a gentleman he's never gonna force himself he's always gonna be humbling and you know he's always gonna be knocking saying open the door I like to eat with you I like to have a spiritual meal with you amen he's always going to be doing that and some people don't get the full experience some people just doubt the whole thing but the believers boys believe the Word of God amen and programs cloud vision and experience match Ezekiel's prophetic experiences that was beautiful that that was just tremendous one time God literally picked up Ezekiel took him from his home in Jerusalem right oh right over to Babylon it was a translation just like Philip the Bible says that the second time he stayed in his house and the Bible said God picked him up by the hair his body stayed there God picked him up by his theophany hair carried him over to the the temple of in Israel showed him all the abominations in the temple and brother Brahim experienced the same thing a man brother man was physically caught up into the cloud physically a translation caught up into that cloud and then the other time when he went beyond the curtain of time his body stayed there but God lifted up his theophany amen we serve a miracle-working God amen we serve the same God of the Bible and the same God of the brother branham amen beautiful now then then we saw this how the first time brother Branham mentioned that Life magazine article which I left in my office but we looked at it on Sunday if you want to borrow it let me know but just please take real good care of it because I someone gave it to me and it was over a hundred dollars or something like that but the very the very first sermon brother Branham rep mentions this this this cloud brother way died in the end of the service brother Branham went in prayed for him and he came back to life right there in service so that was the vindication that life was with that cloud life was in that cloud Jesus was that cloud amen and Jesus is the way the truth and the life he's the life amen so Life magazine Jesus Christ and Jesus brings him back to life amen beautiful and then we saw on Sunday how the critics of the cloud had many erroneous videos but they rarely attack the doctrine of brother Branham because they have no scriptural backing for their false doctrine they'll never defeat water baptism they never defeat how God's one person though never the Bible never says he's three gods so they don't attack the doctor because the doctrine is rock solid amen but we must love our enemies we want to speak the truth in love now for today I excited try to keep it really short with the review for today I would look at a few things as I read this as Lydia rather read this to me on the way to church I was I was driving to church there's a few things that I want to mention that we wrote down here I thought would be helpful to you and actually let me one of them I'm going to mention I'm gonna show you back the picture that brother Chad Lam so in a moment in a moment we'll talk about this but the first one brother Perry Greene noted how st. Paul was caught up to the third heaven how many more of that it was in second Corinthians chapter 12 I believe Paul said I knew a man above 14 years ago he was caught up into third heaven later he said it was me he said because of the abundance of my revelations God allowed Satan to buff at me with buffeting messengers remember to keep me humble for all the revelations that have been that have been given to him okay so the same thing with brother ran just as Paul was carved a third heaven brother Brandon was caught up into a constellation of angels and it's exactly scriptural now this one this was even more striking here but there Chad lamb preached this at his church and I'm sorry I got cut off there I didn't do a good job of I didn't do a good job of that anyways the critics of the clouds say that the cloud that was seen here over Flagstaff that that pyramid cloud was actually the debris from an exploded rocket but as this brother said as the Perry green said he read the other scientific articles that that for rocket exploded five hundred miles off the coast five hundred miles he said that's what the weather wise magazine said so it makes it even more impossible so I don't know if this is the I don't think it's 10 miles from Flagstaff to California I'm pretty sure it's not so I don't know if this trip this calculation is wrong or if it's even more than that I think it's more net because he says in here it exploded 500 miles off the coastline so it could have been down here could have been out there and then somehow three hours and 48 minutes at sunset on September 28th it's a bug of it's above Flagstaff and the shocking thing was if it did explode 500 miles out here it traveled all these miles and no one even saw it until it got over Flagstaff and then when it was over flagstaff more than 80 people took a picture of it sent it in to the scientists and said we saw this this is amazing we've never seen anything like it before - my opinion it could not been a thaw rocket it had to bet Almighty God Amen because when have you seen when have you seen debris look that nice you've never seen an explosion look that nice where it's just perfectly like a pyramid or anything like that never Church it never looks like that where's all the pieces of the rocket you know where's all that it just doesn't make any sense so I wanted to tell you a little more facts that brother Peregrine knew about that brother Peregrine says he talked to the man who studied it there at the University of Tucson or Arizona whichever University was and I want to make sure you saw that by the grace of God so there was no way that could have happened okay so does that help by God's grace I just hope that's just I just want to real real quickly review that let me set my timer here so I don't go too long tonight I'll be honest if I go too long I really have a hard time on Thursday because I get I have a hard time going to sleep the longer I preach the more I feel like I get in the spirit and then the hardest for me to fall asleep and then it wears me out for the next few days but if I can just punch it you know but and so there's a bounce you know brother branham told brother neville he said if you can preach a 35 or 45 minute sermon he said that's just what the people need but then he says sometimes you got to preach really long and he says because you fill up heavy you got to empty out long you know so there's a balance so on Wednesday night so maybe I'll try to just shoot for this hour here that's what I like to do I think you understand what I'm trying to say now I want to just bring this out of the scripture so if you have your Bibles you can turn but I do have the scriptures up here I believe we want to you know part of this sermon about clos with the cloud we are taking sides with God's prophet that's what we're doing and the same thing had to be done in Paul's day I don't know if you knew this but Paul said he told Timothy in his very last letter before his head got chopped or chopped off by the Roman government he said be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of me his prisoner so don't be ashamed to my testimony but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power of God so Paul tells them if you actually accept me as God's prophet and messenger you're gonna suffer you're going to be rejected people are gonna disdain you people are gonna you're gonna have reproach all because you accept the messenger of the hour how many how many have ever experienced any reproach we're following the message of the hour all the time amen no he says now we are not ashamed of brother branham's testimony Oh Paul spent time trying to convince the Corinthian church to receive him and use his testimony for support can you imagine that a man who'd raised the dead a man who had done miracles healed a complete island the island of Malita the Bible said everybody on the island got healed and God had got it done so many miracles in Paul's life and yet here he has to convince the Corinth in church won't you receive me won't you receive my preachers he was begging for them to let him in their door and preach to them a man of God like that what does it show it shows that God's messengers as much as God vindicate them it takes an individual to have a heart that loves the Word of God amen now look what he says now look in Chapter seven in Chapter 11 he says receive us he's begging them receive us we've wronged no man so there must have been someone who thought Paul had wronged the Corinthians isn't that what they do to preachers they try to say with a preacher this wrong the preacher did that wrong the preacher did they're always pointing out the wrong things instead of the good things and the church said because if you want to find something wrong with me or anybody else you're gonna find it but if it's wrong you got to go to the person to correct it praise God and then the person's really letting the Holy Spirit they'll receive their correction and their life will line right back up with the Word of God everybody does that in fact I'll be just as bold to say everybody has to do that every single day of their life amen Paul says receive us please a Messenger of God who saw the pillar of fire who got his eyesight back after being blind you know his scales fell off his eyes and he saw Jesus Christ the hope the pillar fire like receive us please receive us in Chapter 11 he says I say again let no man think me a fool that means people were calling Paul a fool in the very church he started he said all they're just he's just a fool a mighty man of God we'd say letter the Holy Spirit if otherwise yeah as a fool receive me so he said if you're gonna call me a fool receive me as a fool that I may boast myself a little say yea just consider me a fool but let me brag on Jesus Christ amen let that be your testimony of the night for anyone to anyone here if you just think someone's a fool just let them back just appreciate how much they love Jesus amen somebody makes a mistake forgive them right receive them receive the Word of God amen so Paul know as as as mighty as God and vindicated his message he still was rejected by many people so remember what did he say he sees so trying to convince them he says of the Jews five times I received forty stripes save one thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice I was shipwrecked a night and a day I have been in the deep now I've never experienced anything like that but I have been told you're not welcome to come back there to preach anymore I haven't told that we don't want to hear preaching like that anymore we're not going to give you any more invitations I haven't told that I know people have told people stay away from brother Jesse don't listen to his preaching I've had had that but I've never had anything too severe but remember he had to experience this so he could understand the sufferings of Christ which he used to put on people holding their coats they could stone Stephen just standing and not saying anything so he had to suffer because he caused so much suffering he allowed so much suffering but he said he said for me to live as Christ to died as my gain amen it was a joy to him it was a pleasure for him to suffer like his Lord because of ours Lord had done for him ain't ahead saved him from no doubt he'll mine now here's I've mentioned recently I may have been a little wrong on this I want to bring this out tonight Paul says now this is the same last letter to Timothy this thou knowest that they all day which are in Asia be turned away from me of whom are Fidelis and Hermogenes the Lord gave mercy on the house of own F for us Inessa for us for he oft refresh me and was not ashamed of my chain so now we know the reason many of the people in Asia rejected Paul because he got arrested and put in jail how could a real preacher go to be put in jail come on your your pastor is a real man of God he got put in jail Oh your church age messenger he preaches the truth and yet he's arrested and spending years in jail that's so the reason they were ashamed of it was because he was suffering for the gospel of Christ but little did Satan know that while Paul was in prison he was right in most of the New Testament Amen hallelujah praise God see God works everything for his glory amen how could it be God's glory for me to be in prison how could it be in God's glory for me to be arrested and everybody's rejected me and God's like just let them go let the blind lead the blind you preach the word you write the word let me write my let me breathe into you my very words that you might write it and send it out to the churches that even the churches in Akron 2,000 years later can receive strength from the message of that hour amen glory because that's the same letters we're reading tonight amen the same ones he penned in prison are inspiring you and I tonight are you inspired you ought to be but man said don't love ever lose your enthusiasm for the word of God in other words never leave your first love hallelujah they're ashamed well he got arrested well your your your man of God went to jail my pastor didn't that's because he didn't preach against sin that's because he let everybody sin in the church that's because he rejects the holy spirit right but Paul didn't and that's why he was arrested and put in prison they're ashamed of his imprisonment now this is a commentary brother Ram did reference this I could show to you if you want this is the commentary he used in church you know brother branham never said you know the lexicon or the dyg lot was thus saith the Lord he never said Scofield er or any of those guys with us saith the Lord but brother Brandon would read them and then the Holy Spirit would point out that this was the truth of God and he pulled this truth and that truth now all of it was truth of course because they're not the Bible those writers and those books the lexicon of Adar not though the true Word of God but there's thoughts in there that he could pull out and then he would show them to the people and those would be inspired thoughts of God amen there it is brother am pulling inspiration from the written truths that were out there which that's just what Jeremiah did remember um so that's what Daniel did remember the Bible said Daniel read the words of Jeremiah and then he understood the 490 years Daniel seventy weeks that's what the Bible says the way Daniel understood it was by reading what Jeremiah said brother Branham do the same amen now this one it says here all who there are now when they were in Rome not be or are but turned from me then were ashamed of my chain in contrast to Oh Nessa for us so those in Asia at that church now this is where I've been wrong I thought that every church in Asia rejected Paul but apparently that's not the truth according to this this commentary but again I don't know I'm just saying I could be wrong I'm just letting you know I could be wrong I want to be humble enough if I'm wrong to say I'm wrong I want to be humble enough he said they did not stand with me but forsook me it is possible that the occasion of their turning from him was that his apprehension and Nicko Paulus whether they had escorted him on his way to Rome but from which they turn back to Asia a hint to Timothy now in Asia not to be like them but to imitate rather onesa force and to come to him amen so for whatever reason these Asian churches didn't like him being arrested they didn't come visit him anymore they didn't come seeing him anymore but Paul says be like own Ephesus he's often refreshed me in church we got to make sure that we're constantly seeing to the words of brother Branham we have to make sure we don't leave brother Branham behind like they left Paul behind praise the Lord we have to do the to make sure we're hearing the voice of God's prophet amen see they left him behind that's what I said before the same it's the same idea when Joanna when Herodias cut off John the Baptist's head she silenced the prophet and we can't let brother and his voice be silenced in our lives it's the same ideal I'm not going to listen that anymore I'm not gonna put up with that anymore I'm not gonna do that anymore it's the same idea they're silencing the messenger the star of the hour but we're not to run from it were to enjoy the light and the fire of the star amen hallelujah we're supposed to gain power from that every time I hear brother Branham preach I get something off some some type of inspiration off one of the office servants every single one there's only something that strikes or I never heard of like that never heard of like that it's constantly pouring out to us because why the Holy Spirit was with him and the Holy Spirit's with us amen so I could be wrong it may not have been every church in Asia but at least all those with Fela genus and high manias I may have said that wrong they're Asian churches had rejected Paul now Church I don't know about you but I'm going to stand with brother Branham the critics mostly attack on their videos and their websites and their blogs they mostly attack how he changed dates when he told stories and details of his stories that's what they attacked the most but let me say this none of those changes contradict the state the Lord statements so so for example the brother Branham said there's one video they have can you believe they did this silly video they did a video where brother Branham said my dad died in my arms when I was just a boy and they calculated and found out brother Branham was like 32 years old and so they say oh brother and was not a boy he was 32 years old but if you go back and listen to brother Branham that's what he means by a young man he just calls young man boys and brother Aaron is never saying like thus saith the Lord like my dad died in my arms when I was fifteen he never said that and yet they make a whole video saying he he wasn't a boys 33 years old see he wasn't a prophet shame on them are they attacking water baptism they won't touch that because that's the sort of the word they say they can't handle that sharp sword of the Word of God so they go off on little details like like that well then another one they did was a but the bærum said the cars will be in egg shapes at the end time so they they they showed a video of a Cadbury bunny car and they play silly music mock and brother branham but if you listen to the quote brother Ram said it would be an egg-shaped type of car he didn't say just like an egg he said an egg shape and if you compare cars from 1933 there like rectangular boxes like rectangular prisms compare that now to just your Honda Accord and you can see the top of any car out there any that's like a four-door sedan they're all egg-shaped there are all of them compared to what they were nine thirty 1933 what are they doing they're picking that little thing they're straining at a net and swallowing a camel but you and I by the grace of the Holy Spirit our bodies will be swallowed up in life at the rapture amen that's a swirl look you're gonna have amen they're swallowing down all kinds of lies but we're going to be slowed up in the Holy Spirit in a brand new glorified body when we meet Christ in the air amen I hope it happens in my life birth amen over the air and I hope it happens limonite if not I'll be the first one to be there because the Bible said the dead in Christ will rise first they met on a new yacht amen thank you Jesus plus as I said this have any of those critics ever had a schedule like brother branham and what I mean by that is brother brand didn't have time to write down all these dates and all these details you never had time to write a book leave al edited that book for him right the church age book leave bro man just he just heard it and he wrote back his comments and everything like that he didn't have time look what he was doing I can show you quotes from Noah that listen to know that not 1965 brother Graham said he drove all night to get the church agreed to get back to Jeffersonville and he said I didn't have time to crack open my Bible because I drove all night and day to get back and brother Neville just said come preach to the pulpit and he didn't have many texts or any notes that's how dedicated that man was the church and listen that tape he said I could have sat home and I could have rested and stayed there he said but how could I do that knowing that all of you are gathered on a Wednesday night prayer meeting worshiping the Lord he said I needed to be in the house of God like you are amen that's a real example right there amen hallelujah now one of those critics ever done that drive all day then preach their hearts out and this whole time brother branham he's preaching he's praying for the sick he got calls all the time pray for the sick encountering visions and then dealing with the physical strain of visions one vision left Daniel sick for several days the Bible says and brother Branham I have the coal I could show it to you afterwards brother Branham says the reason I can handle more visions is because Jesus Christ said in John 14:12 that the word he said greater works will you do because I go to my father hallelujah he knew where he stood he said I can handle more than Daniel because Jesus said I could do greater works than that hey man I wonder how many of those critics ever had to do that how about interpreting dreams or answering questions I wonder how many but see they got all this they got all this free time they're not reading their Bibles save all this free time to attack God's prophet all this time to make videos and blog posts and and all these things like that to attack brother Branham and what are they doing for the kingdom of God all brother Branham was trying to do was get demons cast out of people he's trying to get soul saved and get him baptized in Jesus Christ saying well these guys do it they don't understand nothing so they should get off his back amen you understand that's why I stand with I stand with brother Branham although he mixed up a few dates nothing was mixed up with thus saith the Lord he just got a few dates you know he just said things though different than what people understood it doesn't change the meaning of those experiences also now this is very sensitive I hope you understand the critics attack the statements about miss dogmeat and marriage and divorce where brother Ram calls a woman immoral woman not a godly woman and a moral woman a spiritual he said that he's a sexual trash disposal that's what he calls a more now that's rough and the church said this is rough miss dog me and Anna sexual of this garbage disposal that's rough but that is the scripture because that's what we read that on last Wednesday night we read that with Solomon members in Ecclesiastes chapter 7 he said where can I find out of a thousand women I can't find one good one of course he was hanging around bad ones that was his fault he knew it a proper Saudi one woman he knew he should have been hanging around those but he had BAC stood in his own age and so see people criticize well he's just so hard on women will so was so was every Bible preacher everybody Paul said don't even let him speak in the church make sure they ask their husbands the questions at home that's what Paul said right that's the Word of God but see they don't remember how Elijah was forceful even aggressive with the prophets of bail they don't remember that brother Branham had this spirit of Elijah and today's culture is different than his day as everyone was aware of the controversy with makeup wearing pants and all the other things that were changing you listen to our challenge you go listen look up mrs. dog me and listen to what the people do they laugh after it we'll see in those days you could say things like that people would laugh you say today people are gonna call you hypocrite they're gonna want to fight you after church they're gonna walk out the door and slam the door behind them and don't get me wrong that's personal that's there was some very tough things to say but Elijah said the same thing on Mount Carmel he said where is your God did your God Baal fun vacation is he taking a nap somewhere do you want to wait till he wakes up from his nap he said go ahead and cut yourselves going to all these things he said but I've done everything at the command of the Lord in other words I saw the visions and I know what's going to happen I've got the saint the Lord he said and just like Joshua said choose you this day whom you're gonna serve Elisha said the same day are you going to serve the God in Israel or the gods of a land that's what that's what a Jezebel is doing today they're serving the God of fashion they're serving the God of Hollywood rather than the God of the Bible Jesus Amen in church I don't know about you but when God gives us a stern rebuke the elect can take it you can take a rebuke from God because you know God loves you and he's your father what did Jesus tell the men after after his resurrection oh you sweet disciples it's okay you didn't believe those women when they came to you you're such fine men you're so fine cultured and find rest you know you're so handsome meant he said Oh fools so to believe every word of God he called his own people fools but see did they get up and leave the church and say no I'm leaving ah you're too rough Jesus ear to rough Jesus said sit 70 has left me do you want to go to can you imagine if I said that tonight you guys will leave the church to go ahead there's the door that's what Jesus said jesus said if you want to go go ahead I know what God's called me to do and I'm gonna stand on the Word of God amen because every child of God can stand the test that God brings them a man they can stand the chastening of the Lord you see people don't consider that people don't consider these things that he was under the spirit of Elijah and Bible prophets don't play around with people they're sincere they're strict they're rough what would they have thought when Ezekiel I think it was his equal Isaiah give me a minute remember they laid on their sides naked for two years remember that let me get that real quick I think I could pull it up real quick by God's grace okay bear with me let me see if I can pull it up this will be a real blessing if I can pull this I'm looking for a note prophets were allegories yeah there it is okay glory Hosea okay God told Hosea to marry a harlot oh you see who the Prophet married he married that streetwalker and he calls himself a man of God I'm never going back to his church again and he's saying there and say I know it looks bad but God told me to do it I wonder who would left his church would you have left his church look at Isaiah Isaiah walked naked as a sign to for the coming Egyptians for three years so the king of Assyria led the Egyptians Brit led away the Egyptian prisoners and the Ethiopian captors young and old naked and barefoot even with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of Egypt how many you had followed Isaiah in his ministry oh I saw his bottom doctor honestly happened the prophets got his bottom hanging out mercy he's not being very modest and then people get upset a brother man takes his shirt off you see how we need God to wash our minds a little bit see how we need some patience in our hearts you know how you know it is true we need to put some things up on the Shelf before judging other people put it on the Shelf and say God just show me I'm not going to judge them I'm not the judge the Bible says I just have to judge myself amen authorities and then if we judge ourselves right then we'll judge angels at the white throne judgement amen well we got to judge ourselves first he said go loose the sack cloth from off thy loins the loins is the reproductive parts and put off thy shoe from thy foot and he did so walking naked and barefoot and the Lord said like as my servant Isaiah have walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and I wonder upon Egypt in Ethiopia it was a sign God hadn't do it for a sign Ezekiel now look at this church talk about your diet how you want to eat healthy God commanded Zico to eat dung cakes in the sight of Israel because Israel would eat defiled bread among the Gentiles and be driven to the Gentiles thou shall eat it as barley cakes and thou shalt bake it with the dung that cometh out of a man so as Eko had to see a man go number two walk over there can you imagine this church grab it pack it with other stuff and eat it in the sight of all Israel well that prophet he really lost it today he was eaten dung can you imagine what his breath was like honestly and people criticize brother branham for saying mrs. dogmeat do you understand and these guys walked around with their bottoms hanging out eating dung and were also led with dust say at the Lord let's be careful how we judge things Church Berbera said I'll see that just the ideas of man how about this man I wonder what the doctor would think of this when a prophet in the Bible was command to strip off his clothes and walk naked before the people what would your doctor say about that he would really have been crazy what knee now God told us about the brand it's look away to Jesus but God told him to it another one had to lay on his side for 340 months or sorry so that's the one I couldn't find get a lay on the side for off to look that one up I believe was laying on his side and one through the other side and eat a pot of lentil that he made there and had to go and see this stuff and make it together eat it all at the time reach over get a handful eat it laying on a Sun oh how far people can get away really from the Word of God now listen we just get so educated till they educate themselves away from God I don't want education I want revelation and though the Word of God will always bring you and I revelation how me understand that amen so see we have all these critics that won't stand with brother Branham because of all their excuses when it comes down to it how do they know that God wasn't telling him to do that they don't know and it shows they don't know because they don't believe what he taught from the Bible amen I don't know does ever understand I don't mean to sound upset tonight I'm not mad at anybody I'm not upset with anybody here I'm not upset with anybody listening Elijah me I'm not gonna said with anybody but I want people to know they just don't wait on God they just people watching or whatever they don't pray long enough about it they're quick to judge they're quick to think they know everything about it instead of being humble we've got to humble ourselves on the side of and then got to lift us up God's known in simplicity by humility what's that Malkin okay Rita buddy glory amen all right give me I'll carry on father thank you sir that's all right look it up buddy yeah lore Ezekiel 44 okay praise the Lord that's right see people just don't understand God sometimes God does things out of the ordinary in order to disprove that the people that don't believe just to give him something to stumble over wasn't Jesus called the stone of stumbling how we know that he was called the rock of offense he was called the stone of stumbling Jesus was all rock but to the unbeliever he's a rock they stumble over I'm not gonna stumble over Jesus I'm gonna fall on Jesus that I get crushed a man that he can request me and make me a Moby there's a scripture on that now he's either gonna fall on you or you're gonna fall on him I want to fall on him I don't want him to crush me I would have fallen him I'll be crushed and he can make me over by God's grace I love area church I'm staying with brother branham you can I know you are too but I'm just telling to the people that might listen is they can stand with whatever they want but I'm standing with us saith the Lord from the Word of God now let's look at this I got a few more minutes here you know I never set my timer so forgive me I never said it forgive me okay I just said it for 15 more minutes I'll try to go 15 or 20 here and this is uh this is a thought I had recently probably last year I've just kind of been saving it my notes were waiting to preachers I'm gonna preach it tonight by God's grace is that okay it's your Bibles go to first Kings I think that's our first Scripture first Kings I believe it's chapter 20 if I'm not mistaken yes first Kings 22 rather chapter 22 first Kings chapter 22 I saw on Facebook and I appreciate all the brothers that on Facebook that always put out brother branham stuff now let me tell you I don't do that all the time I don't do that all the time because I'm a public I'm a public worker I'm a public schoolteacher and I've been to meetings with my Union and I have to be very careful what I put on social media I've been very careful because people could put they could they could screenshot some of my posts and they could place at other places and if it might seem offensive I could lose my job and you say well you don't have enough faith that's not true Daniel worked in the government of Babylon all those years and the church said so did Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they were government officials the whole time and they never lost their jobs so see they lived a separate life without blasting and condemning everybody so I'm just balancing my walk by the scripture when I put quotes on it that are more severe I put it you know I or more honest I say like that or more harsh I put them on our church's YouTube page I'm sorry Facebook page on now this is the first time this month this is the first time I've ever put any really thing about brother Branham I put a few things before but this month with our outreach meetings you know with our the the 2500 postcards we sent out this is the first time I've really put things out there on my personal page and I'm trying to do it in wisdom without specifically stating it so someone who's really hungry will follow the link and then watch one of our sermons and this week I did get a message from one friend she's an older friend from the Copley area and she watched our sermon from Sunday night about thus saith the Lord for the future she said those are some compelling thoughts brother Jesse I said yes they are I said let me know if you have any questions but she said she and she said she's got to be in her 60s or 70s and she said you brother she said one thing you're right about Jesse is this nation is in decline spiritually so she's seen it her whole life you know she's 70 years old she's seen the decline of the nation so she can't deny that now let's see if God doesn't let's see if God will draw her in or I'm sorry if she'll listen to God's drawing because we can't do it ourselves we have to let the Lord do it anyways I got this whole thought right here from a meme and I'll show it to you at the end of the service here and which should we just be hope hopefully a few more minutes now God gave brother brand the most Bible base minister any man I've ever seen in my lifetime here's what I mean look at this let's go with each one a time like job God talked to brother Branham in a whirlwind who do you know on TV or who do you know in your denomination that talked to God in a whirlwind I don't know anybody that never talked to God no ruin but if you go to job 42 God speaks to job out of a whirlwind and the first time but brother Graham saw the whirlwind voice told me six years old he said don't you ever smoke drink or chew her to fire body anyway there'll be a work for you to do when you get older amen who is more Bible base than William Branham I've never seen anyone who's more Bible based than William Branham and my testimony was when I preach brother Graham sermon in South America I cast out devils just the way Jesus Christ did I'd pray for them and they let out a scream like they were dying they'd fight and they were foaming they'd scream and they fall down like they were dead and I waited a few minutes pray over me and they'd raise up and me deliver to the name of Jesus Christ that's when I knew that was 2010 that's when I knew more for sure that this message was absolutely right and of course I knew it before that but that's when I saw the god of this message amen the very same God of the Bible did the same things in the Bible in my life and they had to better their to knock on my door to get me out of my my pajamas to come out there and cast the devil out I was already my pajamas ready to go to bed that night I'd preach that day and they said come out here that he got Devils in a mic oh my lord have mercy I gotta cast out Devils today I tried before it didn't work because I didn't have enough faith but at that time my faith rose and I saw the very same God of the Bible operate and it's just a humble little setting just like he did in 2000 years ago he did it the same way in 2010 and he's the same today in 2018 amen he's the same yesterday today and forever like MO the pillar of fire led him so much so that brother Ram got a picture taken with the pillar of fire and George J Lacey said light actually struck the lens it was a literal light also this is beautiful you know this man God gave brother Branham two signs to get the people to believe just like God gave Moses two signs so he's like job and he's like Moses so far oh my brother bear had the sign in his hand the bumps and there's numerous people you can watch on youtube if you want some links I'll shared you they actually saw them they saw the bumps on mother man's hands road man would pray for them they see the bumps and he pray for them and they behold again and the bumps would be gone this is legitimate this is actually a gift from God just like Moses because remember Moses could stick his hand in it come out leprous he could stick his hand in and it come out wide his snow right and then he put it back in and come out normal he had a gift in his hand so did our prophet have a gift in his hand that's right and then of course you know the second pole the first pole was the gift in the hand the second pole was the discernment which we know and love and I've met people that have gone through discernment lines and God discerned their hearts like sister Humes from North Carolina now she passed away but I showed the video I showed the picture a few weeks ago at our first July first outreach now he got your Bibles first Kings 22 verse 7 like my kaya brother Branham was reviled by the clergy let's see how the clergy reviled him now I don't think brother man was ever beaten up like micaiah was micaiah was slapped in the face and thrown in a dungeon I don't think brother bear I've ever had to go through that but they did revile him and they tried they try to set traps for brother Branham ok 22 7 now I don't want to read it because my voice but I'm gonna read it because the people were livestream and say they can't hear you when you read it so now I'm stuck I got to read it that's ok verse 7 and Jehoshaphat said is there not you're a prophet of the Lord besides that we might inquire of him remember hey I want to go up to ramoth-gilead and take God's land back but it wasn't the time and season and Joseph s like well 400 prophets are saying yeah isn't there one more and that shows there's a truth there's got to be a true discernment in a real believer to know that a true believer can recognize false prophets versus a true prophet hey honey that's right you could go to churches that you always felt something's missing there's got to be more there's got to be some other preacher who's preaching about Jesus Christ who's more right than these fellas amen oh I hope I'm one of them amen I believe I am by God's grace I always knew there was something you know when I went to the president's hearing church I always knew there was more the Pentecostal church I knew there was more and the last time I was listening to Baptist John Piper I loved it but I knew there was more and then came the message amen and it proves right here a real believer can recognize there's got to be more to this and the king of Israel said unto Joseph at yet there is yet one man mark I the son of imlah by whom we may inquire Lord but I hate him I hate that prophet oh my for he does not prophesy good concerning me but evil I wonder how many people have left this shirt saying I hate brother Jesse well they don't even call me brother but I hate the way he preaches that's okay because they're entitled to what they want to believe but if you're gonna stand on God's side you got to be rejected and persecuted you have to be spoken evil against if you're gonna be on God's side that's okay don't bother me and your host Matt said let not the king say so please like all your little rough you got a rough spirit there a hab now you know the story let's go down to verse let's go to verse 13 and the messenger that was gone to Mike I spake at him saying behold now the words of the prophets declare good under the king with one mouth let not word I pray they be like the word of one of them and speak which good talk about peer pressure the preachers are the king saying come on all 400 I've said good can't you just say something good about me can't you just give me something good thus saith the Lord for me what do you think it's not a real mount a real man of God will never give in to peer pressure no matter how many people you say well you should preach this or you should do this or you should do that or you should change your tune on this or you should your tune on that a real man of God stays with us saith the Lord amen he ain't gonna compromise one bit on thus saith the Lord so glad we have thus saith the Lord today thank you Jesus and Mike I said verse 14 as the Lord liveth what's that what the Lord saith unto me that way I speak now you know that you know what he says he kind of gives him a little Johnny look how he jokes in verse 15 so came the king and the King said I didn't Micmac I shall we go up against ramoth-gilead to battle sherry forbear and the answer go and prosper for this Lord shall deliver in the hand of the king did you realize he's joking right there do you realize he's being sarcastic right there does it sound familiar like Elijah being sarcastic with the prophets of bale Mount Carmel brother branham being a little sarcastic about the dog meat and everything like that kind of mocking them do you see that he's this prophet is anointed and he's so filled with the spirit that he's bringing a rebuke upon the false believers and God never had him apologize and I never heard brother Branham apologize for those statements either Oh God open up our understanding praise the Lord look at the King said in verse 16 how many times should I journey that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord and he said I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills as sheep that happen to have not a shepherd and the Lord said these have no masters so there now he's telling the King basically you're not even a shepherd to these people you're going to be killed and they're going to all your people are going to be scattered they're not gonna have a king and look at verse 18 and the King said unto Joseph did not I tell you that I was prophesied no gird concerning but evil didn't I tell you this Holy Roller preacher always balls me out for my sin didn't I tell you he's always against me this preachers always preaching against my sin he ought to preach against their said he was a murderer praise God he let Jezebel get away with murder so that means he accepted murder he's got a murdering spirit on him so God let God lets him get mocked God a little sarcasm because all the evil he's done by now they ask him and they say who's gonna persuade and that oh I'm sorry Micaiah says he saw the vision and the Lord said I need a spirit to persuade a have to go to Mount Gilead and on lying spirit came up and the Lord said yes you can go and deceive hey hab now look what the Bible said look at the Bible said verse 23 now therefore behold the Lord hath put a lying sphere in the mouth of all these prophets and the Lord has spoken evil concerning thee so what he's basically doing he said you you're preachers are a bunch of liars you're preachers are saying it's okay to baptize in the father son Holy Ghost bunch of liars that kind of hits home doesn't it oh you're preachers say it's okay for women to wear pants and cross dress like men bunch of liars that's rough but that's what the Spirit of God then did then did then at that time and that's we didn't brother Brandon's ministry and that's what the Spirit of God will always do it'll always declare truth from a lie now look how they treated him Church look at verse 24 but Zedekiah the son of jamya went near and smoke Mike ayah on the cheek and said which way went the spear Lord from me to speak unto thee and macaé said behold thou shalt see in that day when thou shalt go into inner chamber to hide thyself look at verse 28 Mike I said have valerie turn it on peace the Lord hath not spoken by me that man knew where he was standing with God and the church said now let me read you a quote where brother Branham so see Mike I was reviled let me read you a quote where brother Branham was reviled I think I copied it right here yeah this is from is your life where the gospel how many ever listen to that one that's one of my favorite sermons when I first came in the message brother Ram said he was going miss Chicago and 300 preachers were sitting there and the Lord told me that night what they was going to do they had a trap set for me 300 against one ha ha ha I wonder who's gonna win now look it's just in the scripture they had 400 against one ah is it it's just it's just like it's like a type right just like how Joseph was sold for 20 and Jesus thirty pieces of silver it's not exactly but it's very similar the same thing here 300 verse 1 400 verse 1 God toys in the minority but with God where the majority amen where the majority when we stand with dust saith the Lord Oh hallelujah he said me go over there I went up and told brother Carlos and I said you'll not have it in that hotel you'll have to take it to another place it'll be a green room and they have a trap set for me haven't they brother Carlson and he dropped his head he sat there in my office a few days ago come from Chicago meaning I said I'll never forget that brother branham and that's how Perry green church where's that book that's how Peregrine eventually realized he was the prophet Elijah because brother Brandon discerned his harsh so many times he tells it in this book he said he said after that last time he said he said you got he said I perceive you're a prophet and I perceive you have the spirit of Elijah and brother man said why don't go broadcasting that he said but that's the truth that's what I said to God God revealed every every truth to me reveal every minister to me reveal every true call of God person I want to know because I want to be led by the Holy Spirit amen I wouldn't know what God is doing today amen amen now we know he's not gonna be a major profit today but what I'm saying is God reveal who your people are reveal who the true saints of God are in this hour there's my 15 minutes man and I said brother why won't you speak he said I couldn't do it he said I thought you said you'd do me a favor and I said last night the Lord told me you're going down there today and you will find out you're not going to get that building you're going to another building dr. Meade will be set in this side that colored man his wife that sings will be sitting right here and so forth whether I'll be sitting I said there'll be a Buddha priest there and I said now find out they got it against me because I preached the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ ray and they got against me because I preached the Serpent's seed did I tell you I had somebody a few weeks ago send me a text from overseas and they said I watched your video on the serpent seen in the it says they said that was one of the greatest videos I've ever watched in my life I know about you Church but that does something to me when God can take his word and use me to present something that literally changes a person's life where they can see the truth of God so clear it's one of the greatest revelations they received in their life I just say Lord let me be humble just keep using me open more blind eyes that they can walk in the truth of the word of God amen they got it against me because the evidence is not speaking with tongues he says and I said come down and watch God 300 against one he said I got in there they went down there and the very two hours from then or better at the same time that afternoon they called her brother Carlson he said that guy that let them have that room they paid a down payment on it we have to cancel because the manager said he'd already promised it to a band for that night and they couldn't have it in the room the first room so he went out of town and he said he went out to the town and country hotel and that morning we got in there and stood there and brother Carlson said there's one thing he's so he standing before all these ministers and brother Carlson says there's one thing you brother might disagree with brother branham but he's not scared to say what he believes he told me these things would happen just exactly the way they are now here he is let him speak for himself and brother man said he took the scripture from the book of Acts where Paul said I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision oh my and I said you've got it in for me for a lot of baptism in the name of Jesus Christ better than 300 of you introduce yourself as dr. so-and-so and dr. so-and-so and I said I haven't even got a grammar school education but I challenge any man here to bring your Bible and stand here by my side and deny that one of those words about baptism and Surrency and deny one of them that's been ever said amen holiday left and he says you got it on me here he said I got it on tape if you want to hear it he said that was the quietest crowd you ever heard hallelujah that's how it is today when I talked to people or you know either text them were talking about the Word of God like I told my friends a few weeks ago about women preachers I said show me I said I just made a video how women are not to preach the gospel and I'm sorry about high heels and I said I just made a video about high heels and how they're not in the Bible and that's the quietest group of brothers you ever heard they wait a few seconds they change the subject see that nothing they don't have any Word of God they don't have any truth to show them that it's okay to for a woman to press herself out like that in a sexual manner they don't have any truth but we've got the Spirit of Truth amen and it only shuts the mouth of the devil hallelujah he said that was a quietest crowd you ever heard three hundred the quietest preachers you ever heard oh thank you Jesus but I said what's the matter is there anybody here tonight was in that morning meeting let's see hold your hand well sure he said then if you can't support it then get off my back all right he said there's a lot of hollering when they're around the corner but come face-to-face with the issue it's different he said then men walked out of the preaching they'll say a lot of things behind your back that they won't say in front of her face Tommy Hicks now here's one man and watch this one of the men stand up and say I want 300 of those tapes so every and I'll send it to every Pretender Trinitarian preacher I know of he said some of them men were shaking my hands they will come down there Jeffersonville and be baptized and brother BAM said now says in 63 where are they at he said they all made excuses and said I can't do it my denomination won't let me do it and brother BAM said that's just what Jesus said I married a wife and I can't come to the wedding supper I bought a yoke of oxen and I bought a piece of ground I've got to go look at it he said is that a life that's worthy of the gospel 300 men say I'll be baptized give me some of those tapes I want to hear the message and not one of them came down to be baptized can't you see how the Bible said Liars will not inherit the kingdom of God I'll be baptized in Jesus Christ I believe you ah I believe God's will in person I'll believe I'll meet I'll come to your church service I've had so many people tell me they're gonna come to my church and they never come to our church I wonder if they're gonna answer on the day of judgment is that a life that's worthy the gospel when all you're doing is sharing the love of Jesus Christ and the Word of God and the revelations of the Bible is that our life that's where the gospel it's not and the church said let me try to finish here my boy it just gets good I get all excited and get all stirred up and I don't want to quit I'm gonna pay for it tomorrow now I love this look at this man like Elijah he's a man of the earnest he rebuked the modern-day Jezebel and Ahab my own brother have said that Jezebel was the Roman Catholic Church now his you know Kennedy's wife Jacqueline she was a bad influence but brother man never says she was Jezebel the quotes I've read say that the Roman Catholic Church was the Jezebel behind the Ahab of JFK are you with me but of course she did influence you know Jacqueline Kennedy did influence the nation in the wrong way but I can't find a quote where he literally said that sober man said Elijah rebuked man-made religions and immoral women and they both spoke with thus saith the Lord like Jeremiah he wanted to quit preaching brother I remember said he had a complex standing in the gap he says I'm just gonna go up the wilderness I'll take my wife up there and I'll just stop down here when I got thus saith the Lord he was gonna quit preaching but the Bible said in Jeremiah Jeremiah said the same thing let's read it Jeremiah 20 verse 9 and I've always said this until you're in jail and you feel like quitting being a Christian until you're in jail you shouldn't really use this phrase oh it was like fire shut up in my bones and then the next day you're all discouraged and bent out of shape about something Jeremiah said I had fire shut up in my bones after I'd spent months in prison so let's be careful how we use that and the church said if you got fire your bones let's see some real fire and let's see some Holy Ghost fire not up one net in one week and next week you're down well where is the sister where's the brother it's Church time it's time to pray where they at where's the fire in their bones now is that right keep yeah that's why you got to keep the fire going at your house you get a fire here you got a fire they're gonna fire the Word of God keep the fire burnin in your prayer closet amen it's exactly right I've never said that all the fire show up in my bones I never said that because I think it's a little irreverent I think it's without understanding Jeremiah 20 verse 9 then said I then said I will not make mention of him nor speak any more in his name but his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and I was weary with forbearing and I could not stay now look at verse 2 look he just got smacked in the face and put in stocks look at this then pastor smoked Jeremiah the Prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin which was by the house of the Lord so not only did Mike I get slapped of course Jesus too but Jeremiah did too and then he feels like quit and given up and then God sends a holy anointing he feels fiery so that's okay I'll keep preaching I'm not ready to give up I've been smacked in the face I've been thrown into prison I feel like quit but all of a sudden I got the anointing now when you go through that let me know then you can say I got fire in my bones but if you if we can't witness and we can't pray for more than five minutes that we can't have more of the Spirit of God let's be sound on that let's first get it and then let's talk about it after that let's first get the fire keep the fire burning and then let's talk about a fire shut up in my bones that's always a certain sermon or thought I like to inject because I think people just throw it around the wrong way this man was beaten and accused and persecuted all right like Daniel he saw the visions of the future they both saw the end of the Gentile dispensation Daniel saw Daniel chapter 2 with the image of Nebuchadnezzar brother Branham saw in the seven major visions on an area both prophet saw at the end of the Gentile dispensation amen glory so can we just review real quick he's like Joe Moses mkhaya Elijah Jeremiah Daniel which preacher do know is like that I don't know any preacher that's like that like David he fought against the religious Goliath of the day brother Branham had the vision of the man with a three-headed club and defeated it with the Word of God remember that mission he said the man kept beating down the woman as soon as the woman rise up with the baptism that 3-headed club would beat her down no it's Trinity it's late person three person and brother and finally said he got the nerve up and when he spoke the name of Jesus that man got small small small see brother been defeated the Goliath of his day and Samson hey preached it when he was here he said what did he said what did what sort of David use to defeat Goliath he said Goliath own sword what sore did brother random use to defeat the trench hands the very sword they were holding the Word of God amen hallelujah see they're holding the Word of God saying it's father so he goes program takes that sort and chops off that Trinitarian head amen glories the Goliath of his day haha I like that praise God because he was holding the word hallelujah what are you holding tonight we're holding the Word of God amen the sword is the Word of God like Isaiah bar BAM saw angels but Bertram saw the angel of the Lord Isaiah saw seraphim's now there may be other visions I could forget brother BAM saw numerous angels it could have been well he saw the seven angels there you go amen how did they appraised it hard he saw the seven angels and there's probably more like Jonah brother BAM tried to run from the Lord due to his mother's law his mother-in-law's influence he ran from the commission all those invitations to do evangelistic work he ran from he ran from his commission I have a quote brother BAM or Church I have a quote where brother BAM said he was in the shoes of Balaam did you know he said that it's unlikely I think it's like in 1953 at one time in brother hams ministry he was telling the people bring the hardest cases bring the hardest miracles and I'm praying for them first and brother BAM said that was being in the seat of Balaam because he said he was trying to get attention he was trying to produce attention and proved everybody how great God was and he said he was going about it the wrong way and programs because he was using a gift the wrong way see how important it is that we use God's gift for the right way like Paul Moses but this is what one brother Branham preached I think it was a marriage in divorce just like Paul Moses brother Branham was sent to the desert in 1963 to receive instruction from the Lord Moses received the law in the desert Paul received the New Testament the desert brother Brandon received the restoration of what Paul had plus the revelation of what Paul had not heard yet which was the book of Revelation and the writings of st. John the Revelator and the church said all right we have a modern-day prophet that's visited to this age and like Saint Paul this is the one we read Sunday he preached long and a man died but then he prayed the prayer of faith and the man rose up and received his life back Paul preached one time all night unica's fell out of the window he went down and prayed for him the Bible said life came back into them they lifted him up same thing happened in June of 1963 like John the Baptist's brother Ram had the spirit of Elijah was a man of the wilderness and saw visions John saw the Spirit descend a remain of Christ both men were forerunners of Jesus Christ Oh hallelujah let's stand to our feet I'm gonna have to close I better stop here I'm already an hour and 15 minutes that's longer I wanted to preach like Saint Peter brother random baptize in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and preached the baptism of the Holy Ghost here's the last - I got two more slides again any other preacher was Billy Graham doing all this do all this any preacher TD jakes does he do this no one Josey no none of them do this and that's fine they can only do it that was what the gifts they've been given but our prophet had the gifts of God like John the Revelator brother random saw the opening of the seven seals now remember John saw the symbols and he heard what the thunders uttered the thunders were the voice of God uttering the seven thunders were the revelations of the seven seals but John was forbidden to write them brother branham though received the revelation of them along with the timing of them in other words he said when the first seal took place the second third fourth he told us when they all took place so he received the reality form as well and was even allowed to preach them John wasn't allowed to ride him brother branham was allowed to preach them amen hallelujah thank you lord like John the like Moses Elijah Christ yeah the Holy Ghost anointing him in manifestation did you ever hear this quote brother Branham said did you know brother man had the spirit of Moses on him Elijah and Christ today I know that let me review the quote Church this is not Maya this is saith the Lord romances in December 4 1960 the revelation of Jesus Christ he talks about a women we've prophesied numerous times over him and she said and then before she could say anything the Holy Spirit give the interpretation and said thus at the Lord within three months there would be the spirit of Moses Elijah and Christ ministering in this bram tabernacle and there it happened perfectly now is that the scripture or not can the spirit of Elijah go on other people yes or no turkey yeah can the spirit of Moses gone people yeah remember the Bible said God said the spirit of Moses of Moses and put it on seventy other people and of course if you've got the Holy Ghost you've got the Spirit of Christ amen hallelujah brother man says thus saith the Lord the spirit of Elijah Moses and Jesus Christ will minister from band Tabernacle within three months and he said it was thus saith the Lord had happened Oh hallelujah brother and I feel like shouting hey not in the Yellow Sea God can take that Holy Spirit with the characteristics and put it on another man for the purpose that God wants to fulfill now the very last one I saved the best for last because who do you love best Moses or Jesus Jesus Jeremiah or Jesus who do you love most the Lord Jesus like the Lord Jesus Christ brother Branham discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart Jesus was the son of man notice I capitalized that brother Branham was just a minor lower son of man don't worship brother Branham and call him Jesus he wasn't in Jesus he manifested the spirit of Jesus what them okay my oh my battery's dead okay this for the live streamers not because I want to be heard I don't like to hear my voice anyway so the live streamers okay is it on okay so on thank you so see what greater on or could God give to his prophet than to be like a son oh it's okay Brad you finish off with that thank you though for being willing sir I appreciate that so in closing this is this the mean that I saw from Facebook I know it's hard to read but I basically just took these than I either added some or I basically added to it this is from brother rod maleva from the Philippines I saw this and brother it just struck me brother William like hey this is powerful brother Brandon was such a bible-based vindicated modern-day prophet you could see his life in almost every prophet in the entire Bible so how many appreciate that by God's grace I'm you're thankful who wants to stand on that this profit side who wants to take sides with the message of the hour I'll be the first one I know you would be too we all be wrestling for the first spot will stand behind God's prophet because he had a bible-based ministry and he preached thus saith the Lord amen let's just bow our heads here for a moment by God's grace I'm believe that the God of brother Branham is here tonight how many believe that I believe with all my heart there's any needs tonight let's have a word of Prayer and if anyone needs prayer you're more than welcome to come up I know he's the same yesterday today and forever it was on a Wednesday night like this you know when I was preaching in 2010 about Christ being a healer that my wife got here the migraines it's just on a Wednesday night there was just there was less people here tonight than this I was preaching on how Jesus Christ is a healer he's the same yesterday today and forever and my wife said she sat there and she and I said how the the the children's bread is just the the crumbs the the children eat the crumbs I'm sorry the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table how much more do the children eat the bread of God and my wife sat there and the God spoke to her heart and said I'm a daughter of God I received the children's bread I don't have to have migraines anymore and God gave her healing right there in her seat now it's back at Waterloo that little hole in the ground never ever used to have Church it'll cave there it don't matter what not in this church it matters when your faith is in the living Jesus Christ who is the same yesterday today and forever do you love him let's bow our heads here father in heaven we thank you for your mercy and grace Lord one thing I know is that you are the same yesterday today and forever your word is true your prophet was a faithful prophet and although people attack him Lord God and criticize him with the wrong spirit we can see by the Spirit of Truth how his ministry matched the Bible perfectly and he said he came that we would have a spiritual relationship with you Lord while brother branham's not here we know you're here and you're the one who really brings all the power and anointing we appreciate your profit you've called him home but Lord we still need you so badly tonight Lord every night we want that fire shut up in our souls Lord God you really don't matter if it's in my bones or where I went in my soul then I'm sealed I believe I am Lord all of us want the fire in our soul Lord the baptism of the Holy Ghost or we can stay on fire door not burning with the Holy Spirit we thank you Lord for tonight we know you're real Lord God we know your true north if there's anything Lord on the people's hearts I pray they reach out and believe it tonight they don't have to come up but Lord we have all got to reach out and grab ahold of your promise my thing granted Lord Jesus bless our gathering here as we close Lord and help our thoughts to be on you Lord God help us to know how near you are in Jesus Christ II the church said a man desires prayer you're

starting to fall away and he'd leave this later there's two men there but this one was more sincere he's not with a closer mom I don't want to fall back away so we prayed and we prayed on the altar we prayed as sincerely as I can't like tonight this is seriously and they be sanctified come to find out sister Wendy went and saw him like months later and people pointed that man out to Wendy and said look this guy is so much different he's been walking so close to the Lord ever since that service in May oh my church if we were to closer or with God we can have it oh we got any willing to do what the word says draw nigh to God no draw nigh unto you I'm prayed for a lot of people you know how you pray for me dude but isn't it great when we see people who act upon the word because God is faithful if you could have faith God what you ask for [Music] Wow on life's darkness I trip you live in a dark world we live in a dark world but God you have Jesus Christ with you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] our faith truly lives up to you you gave the prophet all these signs order the whole purpose of it was that we would fall in love with Jesus Christ and recognize your presence in every day of our life dear God hallelujah thank you Lord for the derivative living in this hour we know this the hour we had to live we perform for this hour it's the hardest is the most deceptive hour to live in rather the darkest hour but Lord you chose us to be lights in the south of no glory of our own for the glory of our Savior who is our light
