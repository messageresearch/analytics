[44:05] letting the devil get in the best get
[44:07] the best the best amen
[44:09] matthew 26 please some water please
[44:19] [Music]
[44:21] beginning at the 53rd verse of the 26th
[44:25] chapter of Matthew then said Jesus unto
[44:35] him put up again thy sword in his place
[44:38] into this place for all these that take
[44:42] the sword shall perish with the sword
[44:45] think it's all not that I cannot now
[44:49] pray to my father and he shall presently
[44:54] give me more than twelve legions of
[44:57] angels but how then shall the Scriptures
[45:00] be fulfilled that thus it must be I love
[45:05] that question basically he's saying how
[45:07] if I did that then how can the
[45:09] Scriptures be fulfilled that's not the
[45:12] way God planned it in the same hour said
[45:16] Jesus to the multitude are you come out
[45:20] as against a thief with swords and
[45:24] starves for to make take me well i sat
[45:28] daily with you teaching in the temple
[45:31] and he laid no hold on me but all this
[45:36] was done that the scriptures of the
[45:38] prophets might be fulfilled then all the
[45:43] disciples forsook him and fled you love
[45:50] God let us pray
[45:54] I don't have any father we thank you for
[45:57] your grace and your mercy we thank you
[46:00] for being so good to us Lord we thank
[46:03] you Lord for breaking the bread of life
[46:06] to us this morning father we pray that
[46:09] you your will will be done this morning
[46:11] break and destroy the yokes of the enemy
[46:14] I pray this morning O God that you have
[46:17] preeminence in the service forgive us
[46:20] Lord for any and everything that we may
[46:23] have done or said or think thought that
[46:26] is not pleasing in non eyes Lord cleanse
[46:30] this house of God and glorify
[46:32] you'll name this morning in your name
[46:35] Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be
[46:38] seated
[46:41] we'd like to entitle this message
[46:45] identification to vindication I believe
[46:50] that it is not enough just to call
[46:52] ourselves message believe us actually
[46:56] the devil is a message believer because
[46:59] he believe it's right he believes it's
[47:01] true but the thing that Satan cannot do
[47:05] and that is to live it
[47:07] you see God vindicates his word and I
[47:12] have found in my pastoring for many
[47:16] years I find out that there are so many
[47:20] people who are claiming to be a believer
[47:26] but then when it comes to faith they
[47:30] seem to like lack what it takes as an
[47:35] overcomer now I say this because Amen we
[47:40] understand the prophet of God talks
[47:42] about two kinds of faith and he said
[47:45] there is a mental faith and I believe
[47:48] that all of us are born with a certain
[47:50] amount of faith that is mental Amen we
[47:52] we believe things that that really is
[47:54] impossible for us to do but those things
[47:57] that we we learn how to do become common
[48:00] to us and we never think about faith or
[48:03] the kind of faith it takes or took for
[48:06] us to achieve what we achieved even in
[48:09] our natural faith as a prophet of God
[48:12] said is of God the natural man can be
[48:17] wrong but God cannot be wrong see what
[48:21] I'm saying he can never be wrong he said
[48:26] no matter how rich how poor how popular
[48:30] or unpopular we are it's all must go but
[48:35] there's only one thing that our being
[48:38] here is centered around and that's Jesus
[48:41] Christ
[48:42] so God let us lay aside everything
[48:46] as secondarily and hold to him and he is
[48:52] the word he said granite Lord so what
[48:56] are you saying what I'm trying to say is
[48:58] that it's something that we must look
[49:03] and we must see and must understand that
[49:07] as individuals we must be vindicated by
[49:12] God wait a minute I must say it again
[49:15] see I didn't know I was going to preach
[49:17] this message until a few minutes ago God
[49:19] gave me something I thought he wanted me
[49:21] to preach this morning but he told me to
[49:23] do it this evening
[49:25] so I didn't even know I'm just bringing
[49:28] this up a priestess to my church because
[49:31] I really realized that we are coming to
[49:34] a place that we must only reset reflect
[49:38] the life of Christ God don't care about
[49:44] what you used to be he's not even
[49:47] interested it meant in in your agenda
[49:50] matter of fact everything about you must
[49:53] die and rot hallelujah and I really
[49:57] believe with all my heart
[49:59] Amen that the issues amen that are we
[50:02] have amen in this chart because I said
[50:05] this church I mean among the bride is
[50:08] because we want the pastor to perfect us
[50:12] hallelujah but the pastor has no ability
[50:14] in himself to prevent you he himself
[50:19] needs to be perfected and that
[50:21] perfection comes by Jesus Christ alone
[50:25] you better hear what I'm saying now let
[50:28] me say this to you the anointing of God
[50:31] can never be overlooked hello because I
[50:37] can preach to you all morning
[50:39] and if God presence is in here you're
[50:42] not getting anything
[50:44] why because it is the anointing that
[50:49] breaks the yokes
[50:50] it is God who comes down and he breaks
[50:53] the bread of life to you you understand
[50:57] me Oh
[50:59] listen I don't know what's happening but
[51:03] you know God don't like starchiness
[51:08] hello let me say it again God do not
[51:14] like stiff and starchy church folk God
[51:19] is a quickening spirit and in order for
[51:23] me to get this message over to you you
[51:25] gonna have to pull on him better than
[51:27] your doing
[51:29] you're not gonna work me up here you
[51:33] understand me
[51:33] I'm just here to preach the Word of God
[51:35] but you've got to pull on else Sharia in
[51:39] order to get what you need now how many
[51:41] needs something hallelujah amen Oh some
[51:45] of y'all didn't raise our hand so God
[51:47] saw that you don't need nothing huh so
[51:50] anyway you said it you did it he heard
[51:53] it is that okay do I sound rough to you
[51:55] I hope I do I'm hoping I'm rough because
[52:01] I want you to understand we're living in
[52:03] the last days we supposed to be super
[52:06] fire fault with God don't listen God let
[52:11] me say it like this do you really think
[52:13] being stiff and starchy is gonna make
[52:16] you holy
[52:17] that's no sign of holiness at all but
[52:22] you must understand that we are the most
[52:24] I should be the most happiest people in
[52:27] the world it's supposed to reflect
[52:31] through our lives what's only inside of
[52:34] us let me go on with the message but you
[52:37] see in our lives we supposed to only
[52:39] refract Christ is that right the prophet
[52:43] of God says in the lamb and the Dove he
[52:45] said as long as you've got malice Envy
[52:49] strife and all these things of the world
[52:52] then you know Christ isn't in there the
[52:56] Bible says if you love the world or the
[52:59] things of the world the love of God not
[53:01] even in you see when we think about the
[53:04] love of the love of the world and in the
[53:06] things of the world we think about
[53:08] fashions we think about houses we think
[53:11] about cars but I'm going to tell you
[53:13] something
[53:13] paulus is of the world hatred is of the
[53:17] world strife is of the world hello
[53:20] somebody and you know there are those
[53:23] people who seem to hold on to that thing
[53:26] of those things and as long as you hold
[53:28] all of those things God is not in you
[53:31] that's what he said in that you love the
[53:35] Lord I'm gonna praise the Lord if you

[1:00:51] this is our brother Jesse my point is
[1:00:53] and then we're living it scaring me it's
[1:00:56] really I was telling brother I don't
[1:00:57] worry about the denomination's and
[1:01:00] people out there I mean if I can get a
[1:01:01] chance of witnessing him I'm happy to do
[1:01:04] so but I worry about those that are in
[1:01:06] the message who claim to have the Holy
[1:01:08] Ghost and I don't see any signs of it
[1:01:11] brother Brendan says shouting was wrong
[1:01:14] he didn't say dance was wrong he didn't
[1:01:16] say anything was wrong he just said
[1:01:18] don't get confused but when the life is
[1:01:21] there it's gonna produce those things
[1:01:24] you see what I'm saying this is a job I
[1:01:27] was going to preach I guess God didn't
[1:01:30] want me to preach it but I had got a
[1:01:32] message by God precious this is precious
[1:01:36] priceless is the word a priceless
[1:01:39] message given to you and priceless
[1:01:45] nothing can pay for it there's nothing
[1:01:47] no no value in this world that's worth
[1:01:50] trading it for heard of God
[1:01:54] identification and everybody said well I
[1:01:56] follow you know the prophet of God
[1:01:58] Elijah brother branham I follow you know
[1:02:00] his message and everything else folks
[1:02:03] let me ask you something go and tell the
[1:02:05] story
[1:02:06] about this junket a hand is bored
[1:02:09] following him this junket was staggering
[1:02:13] and all of a sudden the drunker looked
[1:02:16] back to make sure his boy was behind him
[1:02:18] and he saw his son doing the same thing
[1:02:23] what was his son doing following his
[1:02:26] daddy so every move his daddy made the
[1:02:31] boy made
[1:02:32] that's what following the message is
[1:02:34] every move the message make you move
[1:02:37] with the message y'all hear them saying
[1:02:40] you do as the message goes right that's
[1:02:44] the problem God let me ask you a
[1:02:48] question how many y'all before getting
[1:02:49] saved y'all danced in the world raise
[1:02:53] your hand raise your hey don't be
[1:02:58] ashamed I'm not trying to trick you but
[1:03:00] I'm trying to tell you something
[1:03:01] God gave you a gift of dancing the gifts
[1:03:05] of God are without repentance you just
[1:03:08] danced with the wrong partner right that
[1:03:12] means that gift is supposed to be used
[1:03:14] when you come to God I got you now but
[1:03:21] how are I'm to trick you what I'm trying
[1:03:23] to say if that gift
[1:03:24] listen don't you understand that when
[1:03:26] people see the joy of the Lord that you
[1:03:28] have that's what draws them what was the
[1:03:33] one thing that they said these men are
[1:03:35] drunk but not as you suppose they're
[1:03:39] drunk that drunk off new wine why is it
[1:03:42] that the wine we're drinking is not
[1:03:44] making us drunk it must be a different
[1:03:47] wine because the wine that God brings
[1:03:51] down brings you to a drunk state is that
[1:03:56] right Oh humming Allah how many y'all
[1:03:59] been drunk in the spirit I'm telling you
[1:04:02] I've been drunk in the spirit till I
[1:04:04] almost forget my name of where I am and
[1:04:06] where I am Ronnie I think I might have
[1:04:08] told you this before there was one time
[1:04:10] I was so drunk
[1:04:11] I was going up and down the road after
[1:04:12] service not knowing where I was going
[1:04:15] then some people had the gas they say
[1:04:18] that looks like brother Bruce Scott we
[1:04:19] better stop
[1:04:19] what's going on and they stopped me to
[1:04:22] say do you know where you're going I
[1:04:23] said no you know where you are no and
[1:04:28] then they gave me directions to get home
[1:04:31] but that's just we had such a powerful
[1:04:34] service and then I got so filled with
[1:04:37] God that I was in heavenly places though
[1:04:39] I was still on earth y'all hear what I'm
[1:04:42] saying this message it's the greatest
[1:04:44] thing that ever hit the earth and God
[1:04:47] wants you to will wanted to reflect
[1:04:49] y'all hear them say oh come on somebody
[1:04:52] is true you take a mirror and you take
[1:04:55] that mirror and you place it in the way
[1:04:56] of a Sun and you shine that thing in
[1:04:58] somebody face they're gonna jump Wow
[1:05:01] because the reflection of that Sun will
[1:05:03] still have the intensity of it enough to
[1:05:06] blind that person if you would if you
[1:05:08] didn't move the light and if we are
[1:05:11] reflectors we suppose reflect the Sun so
[1:05:15] much so it will get next to the person
[1:05:18] you reflecting me to oh lord help me
[1:05:21] Jesus
[1:05:22] anyway let's move on I don't mean to get
[1:05:24] I'm trying to take big character to move
[1:05:27] you out of this y'all too comfortable in
[1:05:29] these chests yeah maybe he need to get
[1:05:31] some metal ones or something at least
[1:05:35] you look like you're in the spirit and
[1:05:36] moving around a little bit you know you
[1:05:44] my family so I can talk to you like this
[1:05:47] I'll tell you what people just don't my
[1:05:49] point is this you want when you come to
[1:05:51] church you know who you trying to make
[1:05:53] happy Jesus
[1:05:55] you're trying to make him happy you
[1:05:57] don't want to go like like that Simon's
[1:06:00] house and you don't invite Jesus over to
[1:06:02] the house and nobody won't won't do
[1:06:04] nothing with him he has come but nobody
[1:06:07] won't anoint him nope nobody won't kiss
[1:06:09] his feet
[1:06:10] hallelujah and don't you know I'm in the
[1:06:12] state of Christ right now and the way
[1:06:15] you anoint Christ right now is you say I
[1:06:18] praise the Lord
[1:06:20] Sikkim when you've indicated that means
[1:06:29] Amen is a you know whether are you
[1:06:32] justified
[1:06:33] in other words you got somebody who's
[1:06:36] can prove that you are who you are or
[1:06:39] something to say no this is the original
[1:06:43] something that will was put a stamp on
[1:06:46] you because remember Jesus said if you
[1:06:49] don't believe that I am he because I
[1:06:52] have I'm telling you I'm he didn't
[1:06:54] relieve me because of the very works
[1:06:56] that I do the words that I do aren't
[1:06:59] there the works that the Messiah would
[1:07:02] do when he comes so he had he not only
[1:07:05] had a word which we say we have a word
[1:07:07] but God won't say show me the miracles I
[1:07:10] want to see your vindication what God
[1:07:13] has done in your life there's you know I
[1:07:17] told my I was talking with somebody I
[1:07:20] said this is the season of testimony
[1:07:23] they overcame by the blood and the word
[1:07:26] of their testimony everybody waiting to
[1:07:29] get to heaven to tell their testimony
[1:07:31] God gives you trials so you can tell
[1:07:33] your testimonies now vindication I don't
[1:07:38] want to be called a message believer
[1:07:40] without God vindicating Who I am I want
[1:07:44] God to vindicate that I am a believer no
[1:07:48] matter what he has to send me through oh
[1:07:52] come on somebody yes sir the word is the
[1:07:57] same today as it was yesterday today and
[1:07:59] forever is that right
[1:08:01] hallelujah look at what look at God Amen
[1:08:04] when God allows Stephen be stoned you
[1:08:06] know you think that was a coincidence or
[1:08:08] God didn't know that Stephen was going
[1:08:10] to be the first martyr to the New
[1:08:13] Testament church he knew that God knew
[1:08:17] that and and and we find out by God's
[1:08:20] grace and then Stephen was the one that
[1:08:22] was surprised if you want to put it that
[1:08:24] way he didn't know that he was going to
[1:08:27] be stoned right but it was God
[1:08:30] vindicating that Stephen had the same
[1:08:32] thing in him that Jesus had
[1:08:38] amen here they were thank you here they
[1:08:41] were stolen Stephen and his steed
[1:08:45] instead of Stephen getting angry and mad
[1:08:47] and upset huh you know what he said
[1:08:52] Lord forgive him charge nothing to these
[1:08:58] I always think about that because you
[1:09:01] know what if he would have said Lord
[1:09:03] revenge me of my adversary Paul would
[1:09:06] have been in trouble you see what I'm
[1:09:10] saying even though everybody looked like
[1:09:12] a enemy Paul looked like the enemy but
[1:09:15] only inside of him on the inside of him
[1:09:24] was God Himself Christ vindicating he
[1:09:28] was pedigree thoroughbred from the
[1:09:31] original vine you see what I'm saying
[1:09:34] you know I can't rest on all the things
[1:09:36] brother branham has done I got to have
[1:09:39] my own testimony you got to have your
[1:09:42] own testimony
[1:09:45] hallelujah somebody said oh you all have
[1:09:48] been there when the Holy Ghost fell on
[1:09:50] me well come on somebody can anybody say
[1:09:55] that this morning somebody listened
[1:09:57] because when the Holy Ghost fell on me I
[1:10:00] started jumping I started running I
[1:10:03] started shouting I started praising God
[1:10:06] I ain't gonna say no more I don't say it
[1:10:13] enough on that area but I'm gonna tell
[1:10:14] you something one of these old days this
[1:10:18] church and everybody else's church
[1:10:20] brother branham say these times of this
[1:10:22] service we can't become a farm memory
[1:10:24] there gonna be a time you wish you had
[1:10:26] praise God you gonna wish you had
[1:10:29] shouted you gonna wish you had dance
[1:10:30] you're gonna wish because they're gonna
[1:10:31] outlaw it hmm he said I just listened to
[1:10:36] him the other day he said these kind of
[1:10:38] churches they're going to shut down
[1:10:41] forbid us to even hey hands on the sick
[1:10:45] if you lay hands on the sick and you get
[1:10:49] your
[1:10:49] doing it they can put you to prison take
[1:10:51] you to prison or even kill you on the
[1:10:53] spot
[1:10:54] oh that's foolish virgin okay tell me
[1:10:57] what he said so you and I must
[1:11:00] understand I hear he was being stoned
[1:11:07] and the Bible said his face shine
[1:11:13] he wasn't frowning like if I had a brick
[1:11:19] I'll throw one at you no he wasn't
[1:11:22] thinking like that his mind was so
[1:11:24] elevated in God he caught he was in
[1:11:27] another round he was in the rim that God
[1:11:31] wants us all to live in in heavenly
[1:11:34] places in Christ Jesus so when these
[1:11:38] things come amen we can shine like this
[1:11:40] idiot he had the face of an angel
[1:11:43] hallelujah even the line of God was so
[1:11:46] over him it meant that God transfigured
[1:11:49] him right in front of the people's eyes
[1:11:53] that's the kind I'm talking about Amen
[1:11:57] why because Stephen stayed on the word
[1:12:00] listen he said his face might not have
[1:12:03] shined like a light up there but an
[1:12:05] angel knows what are you doing and the
[1:12:07] angel is a messenger that commissioned
[1:12:09] from God he doesn't have to take down
[1:12:11] he's knows exactly and them half a
[1:12:14] million howling wolves of clergy and out
[1:12:17] the there are condemning the man for
[1:12:20] what the way he was doing and the
[1:12:22] sermons he was preaching and Stephen
[1:12:24] stood and said you uncircumcised of the
[1:12:28] heart and ears and you resist the Holy
[1:12:30] Ghost like your fathers did so are you
[1:12:33] doing the same thing he was telling them
[1:12:36] the way back to God that opened up the
[1:12:39] Red Sea and tell them to God who reign
[1:12:41] on the place down in Egypt
[1:12:44] otherwise he was worshipping God he knew
[1:12:48] who he was worshipping he understood who
[1:12:52] he was worshipping and his God was God
[1:12:56] do you know God my question I tell my
[1:13:00] church I said okay people I said oh you
[1:13:02] everybody
[1:13:03] no mr. Savior you say you know him as
[1:13:05] Lord but there are tons of Christians
[1:13:09] who don't even know him as a friend how
[1:13:13] many of you disported know Jesus as a
[1:13:17] friend this friend I'm talking about he
[1:13:20] sticks closer than a brother y'all
[1:13:25] believe that but listen even in a time
[1:13:28] of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego when
[1:13:31] they were thrown into the fire where
[1:13:32] were all the other Jews but his friend
[1:13:37] their friend came all the way down from
[1:13:41] glory stepped into the fire just for
[1:13:44] some fellowship that's what I love about
[1:13:47] Jesus whenever I'm going through hard
[1:13:49] trials he just don't let me go alone
[1:13:52] he's always there hallelujah and I can
[1:13:55] count on him I count on him why because
[1:14:00] he's my friend
[1:14:04] hallelujah that's what God wants you to
[1:14:06] be to him he wasn't just the Lord and
[1:14:08] Shepard of those disciples but he was a
[1:14:11] friend he told him secrets hallelujah he
[1:14:16] fellowship with them hallelujah amen he
[1:14:19] didn't want them amen to make him
[1:14:21] listening way above him huh because he
[1:14:24] wanted to be a friend he wanted to be a
[1:14:26] brother he wanted them give the show
[1:14:28] that he was made of flesh too and he was
[1:14:31] a high priest that can be touched by the
[1:14:33] feelings of their infirmities but one of
[1:14:35] the things he wanted them to do he

[1:16:14] of a Catholic Church I never joined but
[1:16:16] I went there for a couple of years I
[1:16:18] went to the Apostolic Church you know

[1:21:03] devil I'm gonna tell y'all something -
[1:21:05] devil really hit me with a bad spirit of
[1:21:06] a week or so ago now think it is real
[1:21:08] bad it was like I was about to lose my
[1:21:10] mind and everything and when I came to
[1:21:12] myself I sold there were you in trouble
[1:21:14] I said I can't fight you I said but I'm

[1:21:30] I started that day I went to a bra to
[1:21:32] this fella I tried to give him the
[1:21:33] church he wouldn't come I didn't then
[1:21:36] when I didn't get this one some the sky
[1:21:38] I witness to some time ago call me says
[1:21:41] hey I'm coming your church Sunday I see
[1:21:43] yes Lord hallelujah
[1:21:47] let me tell you something there were
[1:21:48] situations that I didn't know how to
[1:21:50] deal
[1:21:50] and I had to give him over to God and
[1:21:52] then and did last week amen I don't know
[1:21:55] what to pray something changing I'm
[1:21:57] telling you my wife called me about a
[1:21:59] victory that happened today I can't talk
[1:22:01] about it because it's too personal but
[1:22:03] God gave me victory in another situation
[1:22:05] ha cuz when I pray I believe God go
[1:22:08] answer huh when you pray and believe
[1:22:16] that God is gonna answer then God will
[1:22:18] answer hallelujah y'all believe that
[1:22:24] when you are believer how can God refuse
[1:22:28] you the thing is we need to endure
[1:22:31] because Satan is going to try to make
[1:22:33] you think God is a liar God doesn't
[1:22:36] answer his word and God answer every
[1:22:38] word your prayer requests he answered
[1:22:42] them some time he might say no but he
[1:22:44] ain't gonna leave you hanging he gonna
[1:22:46] let you say no in your spirit is no some
[1:22:50] way or another you love the Lord think
[1:22:52] about it Jesus was so in tune to the
[1:22:55] will of the Father
[1:22:56] the Bible said he could have why do you
[1:22:58] think they had this in here he could
[1:23:01] have called 10 legions 10,000 angels why
[1:23:03] do you think they had that in there
[1:23:05] he thought just wasn't equal you hear
[1:23:07] that was facts
[1:23:08] these are facts he could have called God
[1:23:12] gave him his choice an option
[1:23:14] he could have option out or stayed in it
[1:23:17] he could have called 10,000 angels but
[1:23:23] then he understood that's not the way
[1:23:25] it's supposed to happen he not my will
[1:23:29] but thine be done
[1:23:31] oh come on folks not my will but thine
[1:23:34] be done he could have called 10,000 even
[1:23:38] brother branham said those angels was
[1:23:40] there anything in the trees everywhere
[1:23:42] said all you had to do was move one
[1:23:44] finger it was all it would have been all
[1:23:46] over he had a choice God always gives us
[1:23:51] a choice but in order for God to
[1:23:53] vindicate you your will must become his
[1:23:56] will
[1:23:58] you understand me no matter how you
[1:24:01] might have a choice you might listen say
[1:24:04] Lord deliver me but is this what God
[1:24:06] wants to do at this present time see God
[1:24:12] wants us to go through things it's
[1:24:15] character-building and when you say well
[1:24:18] Lord I want to be more like you do you
[1:24:20] know you ask him for troubles it is okay
[1:24:25] I don't care what I go through Lord if
[1:24:27] they gotta take me to the guillotine
[1:24:29] that's okay as long as I know you with
[1:24:31] me none of the saints of over afraid
[1:24:35] because God said I'll never leave him
[1:24:37] nor I will forsake you so when they went
[1:24:40] through the fire they knew he was going
[1:24:41] to be there when they were getting ready
[1:24:43] to cut their heads off he knew they knew
[1:24:45] he was going to be there whatever they
[1:24:47] were going to do whatever Satan's plan
[1:24:49] was was not going to be disturbed by
[1:24:52] their human emotions and elements
[1:24:54] because they knew God was always with
[1:24:57] them why he promised it is that okay
[1:25:06] Jesus could have called but he went what
[1:25:10] he says but how then tell the Scriptures
[1:25:13] be fulfilled if I call these legions and
[1:25:16] they come to my rescue then there won't
[1:25:19] be a cavalry did we would have been
[1:25:23] locked in our sins but the Bible said
[1:25:26] for the joy of the UH what he he sowed
[1:25:30] the joy of the future
[1:25:31] he said his face like a flint see he
[1:25:36] knew that afterwards what it was going
[1:25:38] to reap cuz he was the one that he was
[1:25:41] the author of the law each seed shall
[1:25:43] bring forth of this kind so he knew that
[1:25:46] once he died because he said now this
[1:25:48] seed by soul only is of no value but it
[1:25:51] must die it must rot in order to bring
[1:25:54] forth hallelujah
[1:25:55] every seat and what happened God's
[1:25:57] allowed Christ to die so that we can
[1:26:00] live oh I don't know whether you can see
[1:26:04] it like I'm seeing it that's listen if I
[1:26:07] want to be dead I'm on the roof this
[1:26:14] if it wasn't for my chest movie you
[1:26:16] wouldn't know I was alive you understand
[1:26:20] me but God gave us life that we might
[1:26:24] have it more abundantly
[1:26:25] don't you people got it got it you know
[1:26:28] got it inches oh I am on our door don't
[1:26:32] not want maturity and in this day
[1:26:35] there's a lot of children that have more
[1:26:37] there's a lot of children with more chip
[1:26:38] maturity then grown-ups maturity you
[1:26:47] understand me but he don't ever want you
[1:26:49] to forget your child like y'all
[1:26:52] understand me he said in order to get
[1:26:54] there you must be at a child child
[1:26:58] children fussing fighting in a laughing
[1:27:00] plane they laugh and brave and they fuss
[1:27:02] and fight but you better not talk about
[1:27:06] their best friend hmm I'm telling you my
[1:27:12] baby with my grandbaby it meant he's
[1:27:14] smart as a whip and you know he's he's
[1:27:16] got a lot of energy so I'm talking to
[1:27:19] his older sister some things about his
[1:27:21] mom which I probably shouldn't have said
[1:27:23] and he said don't you beat my from the
[1:27:25] back he picked up on it I didn't call
[1:27:27] her name don't you beat it
[1:27:29] don't you be talking about my mama guess
[1:27:33] what he said my mama is good character I
[1:27:36] don't even know he knew the word you see
[1:27:42] when I'm trying to say you know he
[1:27:44] looked like the Talbot in this thinking
[1:27:46] he was mature he understood God is so
[1:27:53] good to me he corrects me a lot and
[1:27:55] that's the way I want I want I want to
[1:27:57] be the corrected you love the Lord let
[1:28:01] me listen Matthew 717 I want to bring
[1:28:03] something to you because I want y'all to
[1:28:04] understand nothing happens by chance
[1:28:07] God is he God be he has to prove us he
[1:28:11] has to prove us we have to be tried
[1:28:13] we've got to go through things right and
[1:28:15] don't you know that God even our gain
[1:28:17] some time for you to fall whoo you don't
[1:28:22] believe that
[1:28:27] explain Samson story do you think God
[1:28:33] didn't know Samson was going to fall it
[1:28:38] was part of his plan and God knew what
[1:28:44] Samson aim was gonna be even though he
[1:28:46] didn't know it
[1:28:50] hallelujah Oh what about the story Ruth
[1:28:54] do you think God did not allow Ruth a
[1:28:57] husband and family to backslide on
[1:29:00] purpose who understand the mind of God
[1:29:05] but he knew he had he had he had excuse
[1:29:08] me I said I'm Naomi Naomi's husband and
[1:29:11] family to backslide because there was a
[1:29:13] roof over there how were they going to
[1:29:16] get Ruth being into Jerusalem of
[1:29:18] Bethlehem how God allowed it amen and
[1:29:23] God allowed their lives to be lived in
[1:29:25] front of Ruth she was a more - but she
[1:29:30] was converted under their ministry think
[1:29:35] about it she knew that their God was God
[1:29:38] so much so when she followed Naomi she
[1:29:41] said yo God be my god yo people be my
[1:29:44] people how many y'all would do that see
[1:29:49] that I'm saying but it's the end result
[1:29:52] in what God is looking at
[1:29:53] oh come on somebody what if God would
[1:29:56] have spoke the word and all of us would
[1:29:58] appeared in heaven just like but God
[1:30:06] wanted you to know good and evil he
[1:30:10] didn't do it himself but he allowed the
[1:30:14] vessel Lucifer because Lucifer was an
[1:30:17] opposite of Christ he understand me and
[1:30:20] he knew that to know good and evil you
[1:30:23] would become gods which you were all
[1:30:26] along but you needed to know that
[1:30:29] negative part come on somebody you know
[1:30:34] I never understood why you had to put
[1:30:35] salt and cake
[1:30:40] all of that in you got baking powder yes
[1:30:43] so all of those ingredients help that
[1:30:46] thing rise up and be it's nice and it is
[1:30:49] and God uses these earthly ingredients
[1:30:53] to form and fashion your character after
[1:30:58] this there will never be another Lucifer
[1:31:01] ah
[1:31:04] because Gordon got all that devil out of
[1:31:06] you yahudim say over there you and I
[1:31:11] won't have to worry about no tears and
[1:31:13] sorrows no pain they'll never be a
[1:31:15] revolting a god against God ever will be
[1:31:19] singing Amazing Grace how sweet the
[1:31:22] sound
[1:31:23] knowing Amen that God not only I just
[1:31:26] love I love him because I realize he's
[1:31:29] forming God's out of us and we know he
[1:31:32] don't tell us the story how he came to
[1:31:33] existence but we know he's eternal he
[1:31:36] had no beginning no ending
[1:31:37] we can't comprehend but at the same time
[1:31:40] he's given us a part of eternity and one
[1:31:45] of these old days we may even come to
[1:31:47] understand it I don't know but we'll be
[1:31:52] so much like him is that the word yes
[1:31:55] sir
[1:31:56] when God put told him to pick up the pen
[1:31:58] and write and then he wrote it he said
[1:32:00] the broader be just so much like her
[1:32:02] he'll he'll put the pulling out of
[1:32:04] heaven hallelujah listen people you got
[1:32:07] to understand the Pentecostals you might
[1:32:10] call them live fire but at least they
[1:32:12] got something yeah

[1:34:49] before this ain't something I'm just
[1:34:53] saying I've been there
[1:34:54] amen but now that I understand I want
[1:34:57] the little ones when I hear them speak I
[1:35:00] want to be able to move you love the
[1:35:05] Lord
[1:35:05] I hope this is making sis I'm preaching
[1:35:08] about his inspiration but I want you to
[1:35:11] understand see when we talk about seed
[1:35:13] and it's so important that we understand
[1:35:15] what we're talking about Jesus Christ is
[1:35:18] the seed of God say Amen
[1:35:21] is that right he is the seed of God now
[1:35:25] when we talk about baptism of the Holy
[1:35:27] Ghost we're not just talking about you
[1:35:29] know are being filled but we're talking
[1:35:31] about oh I got an anointing of blood a
[1:35:34] spiritual blood gene entering the seed
[1:35:37] of God that he planted within us before
[1:35:40] the foundation of the world
[1:35:41] that's your birth hello
[1:35:45] that's your birth that's when God comes
[1:35:48] in that seed and brings life to it
[1:35:50] you've been born again right but you
[1:35:54] haven't produced the baby yet you know
[1:35:59] how the baby is produced by pushing and
[1:36:04] a lot of screens see people don't want
[1:36:10] to my brother and say this is the only
[1:36:12] kind this message can bring acts 2:38
[1:36:15] streaming and Harlan babies see why he
[1:36:19] does you know my god because God knows
[1:36:22] it doesn't matter what part of the
[1:36:24] country you come from you know how to
[1:36:26] scream labor is something that every
[1:36:30] woman knows about it doesn't matter
[1:36:34] whether you're black white yellow pink
[1:36:36] striped or whatever you know what labor
[1:36:38] is y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:36:42] right my daughter I don't know there's a
[1:36:45] stage in that birth she called it the
[1:36:47] Ring of Fire she said that it that part
[1:36:51] is about it it's like it's gonna take
[1:36:54] your mind and you thinking I can't go
[1:36:57] any further and then the doctor says now
[1:37:00] it's time to push but the point is when
[1:37:11] that lady comes at that point that's why
[1:37:13] I'm trying to tell people about church
[1:37:14] how much time I got really well that's
[1:37:17] what I tell people about church don't
[1:37:18] come up here with
[1:37:19] coming false labor oh I want to hold it
[1:37:23] go and then you get down to the altar
[1:37:25] five minutes ten minutes
[1:37:27] no you ain't got that kind of pace to
[1:37:30] get it that quick somebody be but most
[1:37:34] people don't some people have to really
[1:37:37] labor and you know a lot of the churches
[1:37:40] don't took that out out of it it's still
[1:37:44] real right I mean brother Jess and I
[1:37:47] just witness there the women's retreat
[1:37:49] God coming in and sweeping the place
[1:37:52] people being filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:37:55] ha they came with a sincere mind they
[1:37:58] came with a determination there was like
[1:38:01] Jacob I'm not going to let you go until
[1:38:02] you bless me and God bless them but we
[1:38:07] want this little easy your Baptist
[1:38:09] experienced Methodists or something
[1:38:13] Catholic you know whatever how they do
[1:38:15] it you know what I got it now oh you
[1:38:17] want the little Eucharist oh yeah I was
[1:38:24] so shocked I was listening to a
[1:38:26] Christian about a Catholic place and
[1:38:28] they they got this thing with their
[1:38:30] people supposed to look forward to going
[1:38:31] and get the Holy Eucharist not ever see
[1:38:34] I pick it on the body but my point is
[1:38:39] sometimes people don't understand they
[1:38:41] just don't understand God is not a
[1:38:43] cookie he's not a wafer he called
[1:38:47] himself the bread of life and did you
[1:38:50] know before he become the bread of life
[1:38:52] he was that that that see but that she
[1:38:56] didn't become red until after it was
[1:38:59] crushed your understanding that she'd
[1:39:04] had to be crushed and made into a
[1:39:06] flowering type of substance in order to
[1:39:09] make the brain and every seed of God
[1:39:12] must be crushed come on somebody
[1:39:15] what was God doing I will show you your
[1:39:18] will see Samson had a will and brother
[1:39:21] branham said it like this he said he
[1:39:23] gave God his strength when God wanted
[1:39:25] his heart right God don't want your
[1:39:28] strength he loves it he loves you when
[1:39:29] you work in the church and do things but
[1:39:31] that don't save you
[1:39:33] and here it was he found out that his
[1:39:35] heart wasn't given to God because he
[1:39:37] kept running after the women hello but
[1:39:43] because he was seeing him because God
[1:39:44] was on a mission God put his eyes out
[1:39:48] he took away his pride took away his
[1:39:52] arrogance took away his strength his
[1:39:55] physical strength and guess what he did
[1:39:58] put him on the grinders wheel and while
[1:40:02] he was walking he was symbolically
[1:40:05] showing what God was doing to Samson
[1:40:08] crushing Samson crushing Samson round
[1:40:14] and around and around and around and
[1:40:16] around oh I did this fog come this way
[1:40:18] again yeah you ain't ready yet come on
[1:40:22] God took that wheel and he crushed
[1:40:24] Samson so much I can see something
[1:40:27] crying and you know whatever and I'm
[1:40:30] gonna tell you something when God
[1:40:30] crushed you you will cry yes you will
[1:40:36] repent when God crushes you you will
[1:40:38] repeat y'all hear what I'm saying but
[1:40:41] listen it's all in the making of God he
[1:40:47] had to go that way did you know Amen
[1:40:50] that's whether the bread that we called
[1:40:54] manna came down and seed for that same
[1:40:59] seed had to be crushed but God said I
[1:41:02] was that bread of life
[1:41:04] y'all hear me so they had a look little
[1:41:07] Sheena look crusher they put the seed an
[1:41:10] egg question made I thought the man was
[1:41:12] already you know ready to eat like he
[1:41:14] was you know perhaps it was like like
[1:41:16] sesame seeds and all I don't know
[1:41:18] but in order to make bread it had to be
[1:41:21] crushed and so when Jesus that communion
[1:41:26] breaks that bread and gives it to you
[1:41:30] it's all not only there's a simmer that
[1:41:32] you're part of him but he's saying you
[1:41:34] see you must come in this form
[1:41:38] and when you in this form you a part of
[1:41:41] me every seed must because don't think
[1:41:46] this is an easy ride God is going to
[1:41:48] bring every one of us into that place
[1:41:51] but after he takes you out of that place
[1:41:54] like you did Samson
[1:41:56] the Bible says Samson kill Luke fill the
[1:41:58] stars in his death because until you get
[1:42:02] to the place that you really and willing
[1:42:04] to die to yourself you're not there yet
[1:42:07] and that God's will live his will must
[1:42:11] live you love the Lord give me a little
[1:42:16] bit more fear you know they don't use in
[1:42:19] fearing nothing you know we I just heard
[1:42:23] the probably God say the other day he
[1:42:25] said don't feel communism oh look at the
[1:42:29] North Korean and all that for us those
[1:42:37] who are true believers will be gold I
[1:42:40] don't have to feel what they doing that
[1:42:43] God preparing that table before me
[1:42:46] that's not my table oh come on somehow
[1:42:50] my tables and Lord suppers on a new yuck
[1:42:53] and you and I must realize that this
[1:42:56] thing's in something wrong if they can't
[1:42:59] see where we are in time I'm so happy
[1:43:06] listen I'm happy it's going home time
[1:43:11] you say what brother works you ought not
[1:43:13] be so happy I'm sorry but I ain't
[1:43:16] because I can't save the people that God
[1:43:19] can't say hello did you know there are
[1:43:24] people that God cannot say because they
[1:43:27] end them to be saved
[1:43:28] hello there is a general generation that
[1:43:31] loves their father the devil and that's
[1:43:35] what we're living in we're living in a
[1:43:37] time where people love Satan more than
[1:43:39] they love God ha there are his children
[1:43:45] with what we hated because we're not
[1:43:48] here
[1:43:49] oh I wish that let me show you something
[1:43:54] you see these two bottles here this is
[1:43:58] Jesus and that's the devil okay the only
[1:44:04] way there's no way I can become that
[1:44:09] there's no way this become that we are
[1:44:13] not transformed into Devils the Cisse
[1:44:17] was born Devils this see says we're born
[1:44:22] God's now we may been like the word God
[1:44:26] we may have looked like children of
[1:44:28] Wrath but only inside of this this
[1:44:31] prefer that flesh was a seed of God
[1:44:35] right this is why Jesus said a fountain
[1:44:39] the sweet fountain came bring forth
[1:44:41] filled water because it ain't in the DNA
[1:44:45] is not in the gene it's not in the
[1:44:46] composition of the sea hallelujah and
[1:44:49] this she can never bring forth
[1:44:51] righteousness or holiness because this
[1:44:53] seed didn't come from God it knows
[1:44:55] nothing about holiness still I'm saying
[1:44:59] so when the devil says to you oh you've
[1:45:01] gone to hell you said I can't
[1:45:03] God made sure I wouldn't buy the seed
[1:45:06] that he planted in me before the
[1:45:09] foundation of the world the only way I
[1:45:12] can go is switch to the place I came
[1:45:15] from that's why Jesus said I came from
[1:45:17] God I go back to God those like Lucifer
[1:45:21] those like Judas those like Esau that
[1:45:25] came from the devil they go back to him
[1:45:30] God's not worried about his children
[1:45:32] coming to the light they can't help it
[1:45:35] why you say that because he said my
[1:45:37] sheep heareth my voice and the stranger
[1:45:41] they will not follow oh it looked like a
[1:45:45] lot of choosing hey but the thing I love
[1:45:47] about it because God chose it he did the
[1:45:49] choosing before the foundation of the
[1:45:51] world now understand me now I don't
[1:45:54] fully understand this but God based a
[1:45:57] history of predestination upon the
[1:45:59] things that we chose at that time
[1:46:01] whatever we chosen we
[1:46:03] did God then he'll stand with us now you
[1:46:08] love the Lord I gotta take a little
[1:46:09] while excuse me I'm almost done almost
[1:46:11] done just a thought I was telling my
[1:46:18] church the hardest thing for a pastor to
[1:46:20] do is get the people to see his vision
[1:46:23] God do you struggle brother you don't
[1:46:29] have to answer that but my point is it's
[1:46:31] the truth you know I got people in my
[1:46:33] church who's been with me for 10 years
[1:46:35] and and that's all they've been this
[1:46:37] thing with me and I said Lord I said
[1:46:41] I've tried to do missionary work I try
[1:46:43] to get people out there but there's
[1:46:45] nobody we want to sacrifice nobody who
[1:46:47] want to do anything nobody you know and
[1:46:50] then I found out that in most churches
[1:46:51] at least mine once I bring somebody in
[1:46:54] you know you got those they're waiting
[1:46:56] for you to bring the fish so they can
[1:46:57] clean it I don't need you to clean the
[1:47:00] fish icon go catch your own fish am I
[1:47:06] making sense you know you coming to
[1:47:08] church and the first thing they see
[1:47:09] somebody and the ain't got on a dress or
[1:47:11] ain't long enough oh you did an x-ray on
[1:47:24] you know that made them feel
[1:47:26] accomplished are you going down and
[1:47:27] looking at them you know people are
[1:47:29] sitting if they already sensitive when
[1:47:33] they come to church they're looking for
[1:47:35] love not criticism then we get them in
[1:47:41] here and if they ain't change in a month
[1:47:42] she's been here long enough she ought to
[1:47:44] know better now how long did it take you
[1:47:48] it's God who gives the revelation when
[1:47:51] God gives a revelation to an individual
[1:47:53] you'll never worry have to worry about
[1:47:55] them going backwards on it is that right
[1:48:00] it's the truth why can't we love people
[1:48:04] when they're different when God loves
[1:48:06] all of us and we're all different anyway
[1:48:10] I don't know God had that for somebody
[1:48:11] listen
[1:48:17] I preached a message I'm a preaching on
[1:48:20] this mess it's perfect
[1:48:21] because everybody you go everywhere you
[1:48:22] go people say perfect perfect perfect
[1:48:24] you know oh that's perfect you know go
[1:48:28] do this for me you go do they're perfect
[1:48:30] you ain't near perfect you know me they
[1:48:36] don't understand God is the only one
[1:48:38] that's perfect and the only thing that
[1:48:41] makes us perfect because God is in us
[1:48:44] your flesh ain't perfect mine is not
[1:48:48] right
[1:48:49] how can anything perfect die nothing
[1:48:54] that's perfect can die this come by some
[1:48:59] fault
[1:49:00] something flawed is what brings death
[1:49:04] and if it's perfect it can't die God is
[1:49:07] the only one that's perfect but he said
[1:49:10] be perfect for your father which is in
[1:49:12] heaven who I love that he didn't say God
[1:49:15] which is in heaven he said father which
[1:49:17] is in heaven your father which is in
[1:49:19] heaven so if God is perfect and
[1:49:23] imperfect if I'm born of him so I cannot
[1:49:27] die oh lord help me Jesus reason why I'm
[1:49:33] saying all of this is this we're coming
[1:49:36] to a time listen people you must know
[1:49:40] the word understand it was the word that
[1:49:46] he was tried with when Jesus out of all
[1:49:50] that he had suffered the devil came to
[1:49:52] him when he was almost at the end of his
[1:49:53] fast and tempted him or what the word
[1:50:00] misplacing it giving a different twist
[1:50:05] if he wasn't the word he could have
[1:50:08] possibly flunked the death but because
[1:50:10] he was the word he is the author and the
[1:50:13] finisher of it he caught it just like
[1:50:21] the other day I read a quote I didn't
[1:50:24] finish it and it comes out I think it's
[1:50:27] called the result of decision
[1:50:29] brother branham said even the prophets
[1:50:31] are deceived sometimes I just left it
[1:50:34] that day hey I know what you talked
[1:50:36] about
[1:50:36] he's never deceived on the word but he
[1:50:39] was working with this Jacob and Esau
[1:50:46] when Jacob came and disguised himself
[1:50:49] and Esau God blinded the prophesize God
[1:50:57] blinded the prophets all right just
[1:51:00] think he goes on like Nathan said unto
[1:51:03] David do all that was in your heart and
[1:51:08] God said you spoke makes me out of turn
[1:51:10] no no no he can't do that right so you
[1:51:14] see by God's God's grace God allows
[1:51:17] those things but if a man is truly born
[1:51:23] again if he got the Holy Spirit of God
[1:51:26] in him or even if he's just seed when
[1:51:29] Jesus did all he let me change them God
[1:51:31] will put something your way to see the
[1:51:34] weather you're gonna fight the stand on
[1:51:35] leaving
[1:51:36] did you know brother Ellen say that
[1:51:38] sometimes God have put things in your
[1:51:40] way you said what do you mean he said to
[1:51:44] those seventy except you eat my flesh
[1:51:45] and drink my blood
[1:51:46] he was cleaning house getting rid of all
[1:51:50] that make believe us come on at that
[1:51:53] point in time they should have stayed
[1:51:55] but because they had to process it what
[1:51:59] I tell people the worst thing you can do
[1:52:02] is try to process God where to come by
[1:52:04] faith in that processing you ain't got
[1:52:07] to see it you believe it
[1:52:09] your faith will give you sight right I'm
[1:52:12] almost done so anyway I look at these
[1:52:14] things I'm saying this to you and myself
[1:52:16] when God's began to take you to the
[1:52:19] chest don't think that God is not with
[1:52:22] you first of all he promised you you
[1:52:24] believe the promise I'll never leave you
[1:52:26] nor will I forsake you well I don't feel
[1:52:28] like he's listening who told you yet you
[1:52:30] got to feel it you don't have to feel it
[1:52:36] somebody sent me this look capture about
[1:52:39] this this was some from Africa and
[1:52:43] and and and this intellectual man was
[1:52:44] arguing with these children because they
[1:52:46] were saying how God is real and I love
[1:52:48] the Lord and this net and in the man
[1:52:51] said well have you ever seen him no have
[1:52:54] you ever felt him no well he said that
[1:52:56] don't make sense then God don't exist
[1:52:58] and the little boy said hey sir
[1:53:01] have you ever seen your conscience oh
[1:53:08] yeah he used another word I don't know
[1:53:10] whether was a memory or something he
[1:53:11] said have you ever seen it have you ever
[1:53:15] no no he said well then you don't make
[1:53:18] no sense so yo you ain't got no sense
[1:53:24] see if you came you didn't you never
[1:53:27] seen your sense but you say you got it
[1:53:30] but you never seen it so because you
[1:53:33] you've never seen your sense that means
[1:53:35] it doesn't exist so that means you've
[1:53:38] got no sense I thought that was really
[1:53:40] funny I mean it's your true people try
[1:53:43] to say things to you and they way of
[1:53:46] course you love the Lord folks I know
[1:53:50] this is elementary but my point is this
[1:53:53] everybody's working with your mind but
[1:53:58] this thing right here could be full of
[1:54:01] the knowledge of Malachi 4 and you know
[1:54:05] you won't change as long as this thing
[1:54:08] is in your head and ain't gonna change
[1:54:09] you it's the heart issues of life flows
[1:54:17] from this place right as a man thinketh
[1:54:21] in his heart see so you got to
[1:54:24] understand when you see and I just don't
[1:54:26] want to be see I don't want nobody else
[1:54:28] to be deceived I mean you know I've got
[1:54:30] my children I got my church and I said
[1:54:32] to myself I don't travel this Christian
[1:54:34] road for a long time and I don't see I
[1:54:38] don't know hundreds of more people leave
[1:54:41] God because of some silliness like God
[1:54:46] is to blame in closing you need to be
[1:54:51] vindicated you need vindication in your
[1:54:54] life you
[1:54:55] as individual signs and wonders oh wait
[1:54:58] to come to church well I want to see a
[1:54:59] miracle let your life be that miracle
[1:55:03] and let God show miracles in your life
[1:55:06] he wants to I've seen God do two things
[1:55:11] in the last month that there was no way
[1:55:13] I could have done it and I'm a pretty
[1:55:16] this way I saw two families two
[1:55:19] different families who don't even know
[1:55:20] each other
[1:55:21] husband and wife ready for divorce and
[1:55:24] God brought him back together
[1:55:27] supernaturally God has brought them back
[1:55:30] together now I didn't have nothing to do
[1:55:32] with it the only thing I could do was
[1:55:33] pray don't tell me what God can't do I
[1:55:38] know what God can do and I really
[1:55:41] believe that if God can take somebody's
[1:55:43] Muller somebody's animal and bring it
[1:55:45] back home he can bring your husband your
[1:55:46] wife home hallelujah just got to have
[1:55:52] enough love in your heart to receive
[1:55:54] them you love the Lord People of God
[1:56:01] I let me read this now what's the matter
[1:56:09] with the Pentecostal church tonight too
[1:56:11] much differences as soon as you get
[1:56:13] saved you start this way and a little
[1:56:16] trial comes along and you fall off and
[1:56:18] you go all this way and that this way
[1:56:21] and ups and downs and fusses and fights
[1:56:24] and carry on until how could God trust
[1:56:28] you would think those things to adopt
[1:56:31] you into the kingdom of God into the
[1:56:33] possession give you heir to all the
[1:56:37] spiritual benefits if the church would
[1:56:41] only hell together and quit fussing and
[1:56:44] splitting up and arguing over little
[1:56:47] baptisms and things like that you've
[1:56:49] been a lot better off and one church
[1:56:52] against the other
[1:56:53] he's a that isn't sons of God God can't
[1:56:56] trust you and my point is this when when
[1:57:02] things come and God sends them
[1:57:06] every trial you go through God has
[1:57:11] ordained it God has never said oh I
[1:57:15] didn't know that was happening
[1:57:17] everything you go through good or bad
[1:57:20] what I can tell you now before I became
[1:57:24] a Christian how many times God saved my
[1:57:27] life when I didn't even know him but he
[1:57:32] knew me he knew me he knew you and he
[1:57:38] protected you you think God has
[1:57:40] protected you all the time today and so
[1:57:45] that you can be lost I was telling my
[1:57:49] church in closing I said you know what I
[1:57:52] said God and it you've heard me say this
[1:57:54] before and none of these is or not I
[1:57:57] said God come along any cause of
[1:58:04] millions of people
[1:58:06] he detoured them in the wilderness for
[1:58:11] 40 years 40 whole years
[1:58:17] fine because in his mind Rahab was on
[1:58:21] the other side when they loved Egypt
[1:58:25] Rahab wasn't ready and God made them
[1:58:31] wandering in the wilderness that
[1:58:33] wandering wasn't in vain but that
[1:58:39] wandering was all ordained for God and
[1:58:42] what was it doing 15 it was separating
[1:58:51] the wheat from the tan and that that's
[1:58:57] what you must understand you're tried
[1:58:59] when the farmer go out there in the
[1:59:01] field
[1:59:02] Amen and bring in the wheat one of the
[1:59:06] first thing you get along right
[1:59:07] it's the threshing floor you got beat
[1:59:10] Bob you enjoyed the blessings first let
[1:59:13] him get come the BT City you so glad
[1:59:17] that you've been chosen to combine them
[1:59:18] pick you up
[1:59:19] right
[1:59:20] yeah but that ain't nearly done yet
[1:59:22] you've got to go through the
[1:59:23] threshing-floor you gotta be whooped God
[1:59:26] gotta break you away from that ciao
[1:59:29] hey y'all you think it's all over now
[1:59:32] I'm gathered it to the gardener you know
[1:59:34] it's fine but then somebody gonna come
[1:59:36] and buy some wheat and they want to make
[1:59:40] some bread and now you gotta be crushed
[1:59:44] process huh you got to go through it in
[1:59:48] order to be consumed you understand and
[1:59:51] that's all I want
[1:59:52] bring on the beatings if that's what it
[1:59:56] takes you know what I mean all I know is
[1:59:59] my mind is set on heaven now that's all
[2:00:01] I want I don't want to be left behind
[2:00:05] because of some silly thing right
[2:00:11] you know I this suit was given to me and
[2:00:15] it was so funny cuz I saw this brother
[2:00:17] with a suit on some months ago away uh
[2:00:19] same kind then when I saw him with the
[2:00:22] suit he didn't know it was given to me
[2:00:24] so I didn't know what he thought was
[2:00:26] he's like mice and he just went in
[2:00:27] Baltimore you know people think like
[2:00:30] that well you know so I had to tell
[2:00:33] about that's all brother I said ah I say
[2:00:36] this is exactly like my I said what
[2:00:43] brother I said it was a gift but it was
[2:00:46] a gift I had to tell him you know
[2:00:48] because people have strange ways about
[2:00:50] them you know they think that the
[2:00:53] manufacturers make one kind of a suit
[2:00:56] only one and they got it that was it so
[2:01:00] if you go buy one right it's not your is
[2:01:03] not you don't have a right to buy a suit
[2:01:05] like mine now it might sound silly but
[2:01:08] people think like that folks you know
[2:01:11] and my thing is you know that's carnal
[2:01:13] that that doesn't make sense I wouldn't
[2:01:15] care me about it first of all as I'm
[2:01:17] concerned he can come to my house right
[2:01:19] now I wish he was my size I give him all
[2:01:22] he wants you know I learned that I don't
[2:01:27] have a favorite suit per se that if I
[2:01:30] knew somebody needed it I wouldn't give
[2:01:32] it up
[2:01:33] I learned the lesson with tides people
[2:01:37] see your tyloo I like that that's okay
[2:01:40] you didn't have it but in the back of my
[2:01:42] mind I'm thinking I can go buy another
[2:01:44] one like it see that wasn't right
[2:01:48] that's just what y'all understand me
[2:01:50] that just wasn't right I gave it away
[2:01:52] because I knew I could get another one
[2:01:54] the same way same God and then one day I
[2:01:56] gave at Iowa and I couldn't find the
[2:01:58] same right now how do I do I feel right
[2:02:02] like I've been I've been cheated but
[2:02:04] what it was I was dishonest
[2:02:06] I wasn't pure in my heart you know me I
[2:02:08] gave it to him because I knew I could
[2:02:09] get another but God wants you to get
[2:02:11] when you know you can't give another one
[2:02:14] see that's the kind of giving God wants
[2:02:17] that kind that you know it's not looking
[2:02:19] for some reward you see Christians are
[2:02:24] great I can't explain it you can't help
[2:02:26] if you're a real Christian you cannot
[2:02:28] help it you know
[2:02:31] you'll be just like Martin I got one
[2:02:34] code in order to save this man's life
[2:02:36] I'm gonna cut this code in half he gonna
[2:02:38] have half and I'm gonna have half right
[2:02:43] that's Christians you can't help the
[2:02:45] Christ in you will compel you to do the
[2:02:48] things that Christ would do in all
[2:02:51] circumstances and that's how you know
[2:02:54] it's real because now you're doing
[2:02:56] things that you know that you would not
[2:02:58] have been capable of doing yourself
[2:03:01] those are the kinds of things that count
[2:03:04] that's what really counts when Christ is
[2:03:08] in you it's not like the probably God
[2:03:10] said well I you know I don't smoke no
[2:03:12] more I don't drink no more I don't I
[2:03:15] don't do this no more no no you need a
[2:03:18] birth anyway cuz I Richard on who to say
[2:03:22] hey I hadn't done it all from my youth I
[2:03:25] did it all
[2:03:26] and Jesus said would come follow me
[2:03:28] probably God said he called that man to
[2:03:31] be an evangelist and he denied it he
[2:03:34] turned it down he said with the gift
[2:03:36] that was in him was in him even when he
[2:03:39] was in hell he wanted this go back and
[2:03:42] evangelize
[2:03:45] you see what I'm saying so my point is
[2:03:48] don't whatever is in you this is another
[2:03:52] miracle I'm gonna tell you something
[2:03:54] I've had a brother with me Amen for
[2:03:57] years play the piano used to be the
[2:04:00] top-notch piano in the Lutheran Church
[2:04:04] but he wouldn't play for me and just the
[2:04:10] other day he says not only he's gonna
[2:04:12] play for me but he's gonna play with the
[2:04:15] other musician I got all I could see was
[2:04:25] I'm a happy Christian folks I enjoyed
[2:04:31] being a Christian I don't want to be not
[2:04:33] now I'm enjoy being a Christian you know
[2:04:36] it's not a burden to me the thing that
[2:04:39] burdens me is when I don't measure up
[2:04:41] that's what burdens me right but I I you
[2:04:46] know I look at this thing and and I get
[2:04:48] jealous of people in that's the truth
[2:04:50] you might think I'm a fanatic and maybe
[2:04:51] I am but who else gonna be a fan for
[2:04:54] Jesus you know and I went to this church
[2:04:56] in Arizona I'm sacrificing my time
[2:05:03] because I'm tired I don't sing and
[2:05:05] everything at the concert and I'm going
[2:05:06] to this church to get refilled or get
[2:05:08] touched again or something like that and
[2:05:10] I go up and I got a nice quiet and
[2:05:12] everybody sitting in there all fires
[2:05:13] like they did some Methodists some
[2:05:15] church and you be the match since the
[2:05:41] Church of fire when they come in you
[2:05:43] coming in this church you don't worry
[2:05:45] about nobody she saw hear what they were
[2:05:53] saying but that was a part of mine she
[2:05:55] thought oh I'm a worship
[2:06:05] we don't worship we don't need a group
[2:06:09] he need you and when that when you come
[2:06:13] in it people say well you know I know I
[2:06:15] know a few I have system
[2:06:20] she's my house I call him that
[2:06:23] Trojan horse but nobody was gonna praise
[2:06:27] God and there was a time there were
[2:06:29] times she'd be over there with a husband
[2:06:31] and then put it on in a gift God come it
[2:06:34] all of a sudden the Holy Spirit sweeping
[2:06:36] all church one match somebody one fire
[2:06:41] don't let the devil who you are you is
[2:06:45] an American spirit you don't don't ever
[2:06:53] sing that song
[2:06:54] oh I can only imagine you don't do it
[2:06:59] now get your jump in now with your
[2:07:07] shouting nothing get your phrase on now
[2:07:09] [Applause]
[2:07:14] and I don't like it give it in my own
[2:07:18] church I feel them all right to say this
[2:07:21] is okay yes sir yes sir I love brother

[2:07:49] them afire and almost speaking on this
[2:07:52] church all y'all sit back and think well
[2:07:59] you all want to control those are the
[2:08:01] kind I like to see God get over
[2:08:03] I remember when I was in line with the
[2:08:06] power of God came back you know we had
[2:08:13] no suits always you know Holy Ghost came
[2:08:21] in there was the brother when he calls
[2:08:23] then he was a brother from Africa bunch
[2:08:25] of coals you don't know him brother
[2:08:27] Chico's he came in and he was preaching
[2:08:28] all of a sudden 20 meters I think he was
[2:08:31] the power of God came in then that
[2:08:34] brother could care less on what he had
[2:08:36] he was running up and all down the aisle
[2:08:38] and I'm like oh she's got get them all

[2:16:45] bride and I want to be I want God to
[2:16:47] vindicate me surprise
[2:16:50] and whatever I do I want to do it
[2:16:52] just like how you know is God when God

[2:16:57] could I would be supernational I just
[2:17:03] know what he talks to me I know it's
[2:17:04] when is him I can't explain them if I
[2:17:07] tried to the devil tried and he'll try
[2:17:09] to imitate any confusion I don't need
[2:17:12] him to do that so I don't try to explain
[2:17:14] how I know but when he spoke to me and
[2:17:16] told me about that ladies shoes and then
[2:17:21] he rocked a department store about ready
[2:17:24] to shout when she says I don't I don't

[2:17:43] so grateful because I just don't I just
[2:17:47] totally everybody and then God you set
[2:17:51] the stage that's all my church and I
[2:17:55] come from this I told my church si si I
[2:18:02] don't know what y'all message people say
[2:18:04] we don't do that I can't everybody else
[2:18:08] I just know who I am God started me out
[2:18:12] on the corner when I was in the
[2:18:14] Apostolic Church I knew by revelation to
[2:18:18] baptize people in the name of the Lord
[2:18:19] Jesus Christ
[2:18:20] I never baptized Jesus only I baptized
[2:18:25] and named the Lord Jesus Christ and I
[2:18:28] would get out on that corner me and a
[2:18:30] couple of sisters and a brother too
[2:18:32] we get out then singing and maybe all of
[2:18:34] us sing it and I had my tambourine I
[2:18:35] play the tambourine and we witness we
[2:18:37] had see our sisters or brothers or the
[2:18:41] present and we agree mr. purple
[2:18:44] we got a baptized oh yes I know that
[2:18:48] cars and when they would
[2:18:50] yes anyway
[2:19:44] [Laughter]
[2:20:27] [Music]
[2:20:49] I'm nervous person desires you know I
[2:21:14] think you said a lot of things that are
[2:21:15] important don't you the vision for the
[2:21:17] church I've I shared it I think
[2:21:18] appreciate last last year in vision for
[2:21:21] the church is the fullness of Pentecost
[2:21:23] would be in the variety that's the
[2:21:25] vision because that's the prophecy we
[2:21:27] can't have a vision outside of the Word
[2:21:28] of God how many we that's the vision
[2:21:30] it's enough saith the Lord and so if we
[2:21:34] want that we've got to eventually you're
[2:21:35] not to sacrifice so much money to
[2:21:37] sacrifice the greatest privilege of our
[2:22:11] lives to be invited to not ask ourselves
[2:22:16] has not vindicated me that I'm going to
[2:22:18] be or we never want to get in a spot
[2:22:25] where that Satan can guilt us into being
[2:22:30] deceived the Lord the Holy Spirit of
[2:22:35] Truth
[2:22:37] [Music]
[2:22:39] we believe your spirit is here today
[2:22:42] that's truth so we can truly know have
[2:22:50] we been vindicated else ask ourselves
[2:22:54] have I really cried out to God for my
[2:22:56] desires I really labored in prayer for
[2:23:01] my desires falsely my brothers or do you
[2:23:08] see each tear I cry or as we saw when we
[2:23:33] remember Sharon out on Wednesday we know
[2:23:36] the prophecy when other nations we just
[2:23:38] don't know how you're gonna bring it to
[2:23:39] pass I don't know how you're gonna read
[2:23:51] their battle and I know you're gonna
[2:23:52] bring it to pass I hope we just have a
[2:23:55] strong hand a thing that I can hold that
[2:23:57] key of the word the word says the
[2:24:01] fullness of Pentecost the word says our
[2:24:03] stood the word says that we change the
[2:24:05] moment with you my help my hand of faith
[2:24:08] to be strong to hold that brothers
[2:24:11] despite maybe wandering around the lunar
[2:24:13] this Lord we'd say no symbol or despite
[2:24:17] the delay this you're allowing time to
[2:24:19] keep passing Lord
[2:24:21] relying things to get darker Lord our
[2:24:24] light shines brighter in darkness
[2:24:33] we thank you for your service
[2:24:36] you know my heart Lord I want to see
[2:24:39] everything our brother was talking about
[2:24:41] because actually around brother branham
[2:24:43] preacher people shouting people
[2:24:46] rejoicing people crying people nor Kanu
[2:24:49] raise their hands at every service I'm
[2:24:53] sure all the real saints dude we're
[2:25:01] waiting upon your promise we know Lord
[2:25:08] the time had to get to a spot where the
[2:25:10] Holy Ghost we've all had to be the 50th
[2:25:12] day or do you know it's not a time thing
[2:25:16] now it's not a number of days it's a
[2:25:18] syringe on condition that you do so
[2:25:21] there's our vows of our lives and the
[2:25:24] battles we go through the condition that
[2:25:28] we can be ready to receive all your
[2:25:32] blessings to see the kind of church we'd
[2:25:35] like to see all the Lord we love one
[2:25:37] another here
