[0:00] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:02] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:05] this video is to let you know that my
[0:06] identity was stolen this took place
[0:10] around April 8th and so this hacker has
[0:12] been trying to reach out to people in my
[0:15] contacts and ask for money so please do
[0:17] not send money to this hacker this evil
[0:20] person has full control over my former
[0:22] email address jesse. smith1
[0:26] sbcglobal.net
[0:28] I've reached out to AT&T to try to get
[0:31] help to get my email back but they do
[0:34] not provide support for that so I will
[0:36] no longer use that email address jesse.
[0:39] smith1 SBC global.net do not accept any
[0:43] emails from that
[0:45] address and please know as always that
[0:48] I've never asked anyone for money the
[0:51] reason I want to make a quick video
[0:52] about this is because we had a visitor
[0:55] attend our church recently visitors come
[0:58] a few times over the last few months and
[1:00] once the hacker stole my email account
[1:03] he saw that the visitor had emailed me a
[1:05] few times and so the hacker impersonated
[1:08] me and asked that visitor for money and
[1:10] because the visitor doesn't know me that
[1:12] well yet the visitor sent him some money
[1:15] and then when I saw the visitor at
[1:16] church we were just talking and he
[1:18] mentioned that and I said brother I
[1:20] never asked you for any money so I
[1:22] wanted to make this video and just warn
[1:23] everyone please do not accept any emails
[1:26] from my former email address the SBC
[1:28] global.net
[1:30] account the email I'm going to use
[1:32] primarily now is jesse. smith1
[1:36] icloud.com and of course the safest way
[1:38] to contact me is through my cell phone
[1:41] but again anyone that knows me knows I
[1:42] will not ask for money I've never done
[1:45] that and by God's grace I believe I'll
[1:47] never do it so please be aware of this
[1:49] scammer or group of scammers seems like
[1:51] there may be more than one of them but
[1:53] again the scripture says there's no
[1:54] weapon that's formed against us that
[1:56] will prosper and vengeance is mine
[1:58] sayith the Lord God will repay these
[2:00] hackers or the hacker this has been a
[2:03] very difficult situation many hours have
[2:05] put into this but what these hackers
[2:07] meant for evil God will use it for good
[2:09] and I just pray they'll repent of their
[2:11] deception their lies their stealing
[2:14] because they will face Jesus Christ on
[2:16] the day of judgment and I hope they face
[2:18] him with repentant Hearts before they
[2:20] pass away so again in closing please do
[2:23] not accept any emails from jesse. smith1
[2:26] SBC global.net I will never ask you for
[2:29] money I've been on YouTube for over 10
[2:31] years I've been preaching for over 20
[2:33] years I've never asked anyone for a
[2:35] single scent and I will not start now by
