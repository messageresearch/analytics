[0:03] praise god
[0:54] is
[1:05] this is one of the few that are actually
[1:07] spoken of great blessings
[1:09] a lot of people call the blessings
[1:25] a couple um happens
[1:52] shall praise
[1:57] my father's children shall bow down
[2:00] before the father
[2:03] that's that word
[2:12] you're the king that's in the room
[2:13] tonight lord thank you jesus we just ask
[2:15] god as the holy spirit has been felt
[2:17] around this place lord you've anointed
[2:19] me god to preach your word uh the people
[2:21] to receive them all we all need you or
[2:23] they're going to need to receive it as
[2:25] well but all of us will be what a
[2:26] coordinator tonight that's a humble
[2:28] little gathering but yeah we're so
[2:30] grateful to be in the house of the lord
[2:31] the great deployment people and all the
[2:33] efforts that can make weekends
[2:46] jesus christ
[3:02] spelled out prophetically
[3:05] it's just another great testimony around
[3:07] the holy spirit where
[3:09] in this case we're looking at judah if
[3:10] it was
[3:11] this prophecy some of these prophecies
[3:13] didn't have the past for 640 years
[3:16] imagine we won't even wait about 57
[3:18] years 56 years since our property went
[3:20] off the scene
[3:21] it was 640 years
[3:24] until this prophecy of jacob came to
[3:26] pass so it really shows how the holy
[3:28] spirit is prophetic and holy spirit is
[3:30] very detailed too
[3:34] all about judah and all about each other
[3:38] and uh again i just want to show this
[3:39] like this is a quote we have to balance
[3:41] right because brother adam says the
[3:42] heart is burned each one of those hebrew
[3:45] mothers giving birth to their children
[3:47] she spoke the very place in your labor
[3:50] of where they would be positioned in the
[3:52] prophecy
[3:54] this
[3:55] the thought is beautiful right in other
[3:56] words there's prophecy about where the
[3:58] boys would end up but some of the
[3:59] details go around with just guessing
[4:02] maybe he had confused with other things
[4:04] he said oh it's a great study we only go
[4:06] in the details we take hours after hours
[4:08] someday when we get our church fix i
[4:10] decided to come and take a solid month
[4:12] or two
[4:13] and stay right in so as we looked at the
[4:16] bible church the last few services there
[4:18] wasn't the mothers placing them it was
[4:20] the father
[4:21] or moses the prophet
[4:24] again look at that tonight by the grace
[4:26] of the lord
[4:30] okay so i went through uh
[4:32] and showed these here
[4:34] it seems like just two of them are the
[4:36] prophecies for told about specific
[4:38] places in the land
[4:40] again some
[4:48] is one of the two that specifically told
[4:50] about the land it said zebulun would
[4:52] live at that pavement
[4:58] in the bible
[5:00] uh
[5:01] but it specifically says he's going to
[5:02] live by the sea of canaan of the sea
[5:06] and then it mentions the mountains
[5:16] he's gonna have a pleasant land and
[5:17] mentioned the mountain which one is
[5:21] ion
[5:26] not sure
[5:28] which one that's referring to but it
[5:30] kind of mentions land right
[5:32] asher mentions bread and yellow but
[5:34] again no land it does mention bread
[5:40] joseph had mentioned land mountains and
[5:42] hills that could be a lot of different
[5:43] places but just so you know it does
[5:45] mention that
[5:46] and then gad mentions
[5:49] he gets a portion of the law giver he
[5:52] was seated amongst that so does this
[5:54] possibly in judah's land actually say
[5:56] that without having enough yet
[5:59] death tally is definitely a second one
[6:01] now this is quite mysterious
[6:03] he says downtown possesses the west and
[6:07] the south
[6:09] yeah i think i have a picture
[6:12] but i have the picture where um natalie
[6:15] is up at the north and he's
[6:18] doesn't really look like the south
[6:19] oregon
[6:20] maybe it means like west and south or
[6:22] some other location so it's just a
[6:23] little bit mysterious to defend some of
[6:25] these prophecies in the bible and kill
[6:27] the spirits
[6:28] and then asher says it mentioned he had
[6:30] a split with oil but doesn't say where
[6:33] so i just i'll just show you out of the
[6:35] ones i've read out of jacob and moses it
[6:38] looks like only two give specific
[6:40] definitions about the land
[6:42] okay roman said all the mothers told
[6:45] them where they'd be in their land
[7:01] okay
[7:02] all right so these are the ones they
[7:04] don't these these have nothing said
[7:05] about them remember we read rumen this
[7:06] morning don't say anything about
[7:07] reuben's land doesn't doesn't say
[7:09] anything about simeon other than he'd be
[7:11] divided from levi
[7:13] levi gets no land he only got cities
[7:15] right this portion was the lord
[7:19] judah as we write as a reader tonight
[7:21] i'll show you it doesn't say anything
[7:22] about his land it's all prophetic about
[7:24] christ
[7:25] and david
[7:26] okay benjamin doesn't mention details
[7:29] about his land or dan
[7:31] okay
[7:32] so that's six of them right
[7:36] so that just gives you an idea so we're
[7:38] trying to balance this out by the word
[7:39] of god yes it is a beautiful thought
[7:42] but the prophecy is more to deal with
[7:43] like their future interactions with each
[7:45] other not so much the land there's like
[7:47] right places
[7:51] okay let's look at judah and uh
[7:56] um so judah the first scripture
[8:00] genesis 29 35.
[8:04] his name needs to be praised because his
[8:06] mother praised the lord that she was
[8:08] given another son
[8:10] they did say anything about the land
[8:11] right
[8:12] i'm saying that critically i'm just
[8:13] saying that a matter of fact they said
[8:15] we could rightly divide the world but
[8:17] let's read his past this is a beautiful
[8:18] long prophecy that was our text okay we
[8:21] only read verse 8 john 3 9 10 11 9
[8:26] after it says
[8:29] you have the neck of thy enemies and the
[8:31] father's children will bow down before
[8:33] judah is a lion's wealth
[8:38] from the my son now are gone up
[8:40] he stooped down he crouched as a lion as
[8:43] an old man who shall rouse them up so it
[8:45] kind of sits like a
[8:47] lion who's kind of in his comfortable
[8:49] position right dude is like this
[8:50] comfortable line so strong but yet he's
[8:52] just
[9:07] nor a lawgiver from between his feet
[9:10] until shiloh comes
[9:13] so judah's been a rule but he wasn't the
[9:15] firstborn
[9:18] reuben was the firstborn
[9:35] right the scepter shall not depart from
[9:36] judah verse 10 nor a law giver from
[9:39] between the speech so all the law givers
[9:41] then they're going to come out as you
[9:44] this is spoken 640 years before david
[9:47] he's the first lawgiver
[9:51] this is all speaking of prophetic
[9:53] david's coming and then he's out today
[9:59] praise god
[10:00] all right uh next finish
[10:03] and unto him shall the gathering of the
[10:05] people be so everybody would gather unto
[10:08] jesus
[10:10] and of course christ
[10:12] verse 11. now here's the strength this
[10:14] is the strange i don't understand
[10:16] i need his skull onto the vine i'll try
[10:19] binding his hole into the diving hide
[10:21] his donkey to your body
[10:24] and his asses coal unto the choice vine
[10:28] he washes garments in line and is
[10:51] okay so did anybody say anything about
[10:53] land in there and same thing about we'll
[10:55] see ruling and then some food and supply
[10:59] okay
[11:00] all right so let's go to moses that was
[11:02] jacob let's go to moses prophecy in
[11:04] deuteronomy 37.
[11:22] so moses just put one person here about
[11:24] you
[11:25] and this is the blessing of judah and he
[11:27] said hear o lord the voice of jesus
[11:29] bring him unto his people and his hands
[11:32] be sufficient for him
[11:34] to be thou of help to him
[11:36] from his enemies
[11:51] this is speaking of god delivering the
[11:53] kings of judah remember there was no
[11:55] good kings out of samaria
[11:58] remember after solomon they broke into
[11:59] two halves right
[12:01] northern and then
[12:03] right
[12:04] this is speaking of the god being with
[12:06] judah because they had some godly kings
[12:07] right josiah
[12:18] okay so just one verse from uh moses
[12:21] about judah now the result we'll look at
[12:24] this in the next slide but nothing said
[12:25] about the land yet he possessed over a
[12:27] third of it
[12:29] out of all the land judah had a third of
[12:31] it this is how great jesus is going to
[12:33] be
[12:33] in the eyes of god
[12:35] this man and then of course the tribe of
[12:37] jesus
[12:38] okay
[12:39] so now program says but go back and judo
[12:42] whatever judah means that his position
[12:44] placed
[12:45] among the children of israel so i'm not
[12:47] sure about that quote
[12:49] because his name means to be friends
[12:51] right so that doesn't really speak up
[12:52] position naturally
[12:54] but it speaks of a theme right the
[12:55] kingship
[12:57] and here's where i mentioned this this
[12:58] morning remember we must always look in
[13:00] the bible if there's a question
[13:02] but there's really no questions for us
[13:04] about acts 23 so
[13:18] i found with this study i had to look in
[13:20] the bible
[13:21] more often because i'm not very familiar
[13:24] with some of these
[13:25] things
[13:26] okay so let's go back to judah who was
[13:28] jewish leader one of his leaders was
[13:29] caleb
[13:31] he holy followed the lord he was a man
[13:33] said give me my mountain i'll take on
[13:35] the giants this is where jesus came out
[13:39] praise god
[13:40] this is where david came out of praise
[13:42] god the tribe of judah he was one of the
[13:45] spies
[13:46] he marched and no yeah he was and he had
[13:49] alliance pictures he was the one that
[13:50] held the the banner of the line remember
[13:52] there was four there was four beasts
[13:54] right or for uh banners and they each
[13:56] had a symbol and this was the lion
[13:59] symbol it talks about again kingdoms
[14:02] ministry the inheritance was first fully
[14:04] one-third of the whole country of jordan
[14:07] about 2300 square miles
[14:09] within a second distribution when simeon
[14:11] received a lot in it about a thousand
[14:13] miles of the portion of judah and joshua
[14:15] 19.
[14:16] and that was meant remain in judah it
[14:18] was still a very large portion
[14:20] of the church okay so he gave up
[14:22] something right you saw that i was
[14:24] saying like mostly he prophesied because
[14:27] he was already
[14:30] right now i just i just want to show
[14:32] this i'm not going to read through all
[14:32] this but
[14:34] judah had undone pasture ground between
[14:37] the hills and the desert this became my
[14:40] favorite camping guide of the old
[14:42] patriarchs in other words hebron
[14:44] remember abraham abraham he didn't have
[14:46] rash
[14:47] you know so there was good pasture
[14:49] ground there
[14:50] also there was valleys and lowlands
[14:52] and this was like a garden right and
[14:55] this was like the drainage ice they had
[14:56] a place in the desert they also had a
[14:58] place for pastures and a place
[15:01] for a garden it had so much land and so
[15:03] many resources
[15:05] and then a hill country here an elevated
[15:07] plateau
[15:09] stretching from hebron to
[15:10] jerusalem uh look at that look at all
[15:13] these resources they had corn wine oil
[15:16] and fruit
[15:17] i think look at this how come simeon
[15:19] didn't get that because he wasn't gonna
[15:20] be faithful
[15:22] how come reuben didn't get that he
[15:23] wasn't gonna be faithful so look god
[15:25] already had the blessing set up for you
[15:27] and i thank you amen praise god how can
[15:29] we get the blessing
[15:31] sometimes why do we give blessings other
[15:33] people don't because god is rewarding
[15:35] his people
[15:36] look at that they get awful they get
[15:38] this beautiful land of blessings because
[15:40] god knew they were going to be a
[15:42] faithful tribe amen i knew there was
[15:44] going to be a daily coming out of there
[15:46] there's already a payload can come out
[15:48] of there so god could bless remember
[15:50] caleb's son-in-law
[15:52] he was a mighty man of faith he was the
[15:53] first judge
[15:54] so this is gonna be a tribe full of men
[15:57] that had faith in the word of god that
[15:59] god was gonna bless them with some rich
[16:00] corn wine oil fruit
[16:03] they had daring shepherds that led their
[16:05] flocks far over the neighboring plains
[16:07] and through the mountains the florida
[16:09] city
[16:10] this is a beautiful place
[16:12] it didn't have some barren ground but it
[16:14] was good still for the sheep and the
[16:15] goats to pasture
[16:17] and also there'd be wide animals there
[16:19] like leopards bears goats outlaws so
[16:21] jude is like a huge place that has all
[16:23] kinds of different land
[16:25] but it's exactly what they needed to
[16:27] meet the needs of the people right they
[16:28] have all these dresses the greenery
[16:30] right
[16:31] oil wine fruit everything
[16:34] so
[16:35] it means
[16:36] to be praised the word judah means to be
[16:38] praised
[16:39] the messiah and all the kings would come
[16:42] out of this tribe all the good kings
[16:45] david was from this tribe a man after
[16:48] the heart of god was from this drive
[16:50] praise god
[16:51] now notice judah received the promise in
[16:53] shiloh
[16:54] i'm sorry that shiloh would come but
[16:57] shiloh means a place of rest that had to
[16:59] be christ but christ said i come to give
[17:01] you rest okay we'll look forward to that
[17:02] in just a little bit here
[17:04] in judah was ruler of the family also
[17:07] shown in praise and his brothers would
[17:09] bow down before remember that as in
[17:12] verse eight his brothers were bowed down
[17:14] before 49 verse 8.
[17:18] yeah that's right my father's children
[17:21] shall bow down before thee so this shows
[17:23] where reuben lost
[17:25] uh he lost the blessing of the family
[17:27] because he slept with his father's
[17:29] servant
[17:30] and so because of that he's unstable as
[17:32] water and it's as if as if jacob and the
[17:35] holy spirit said i'm not giving it to
[17:36] the firstborn i'm giving it to judah
[17:40] judah as a faithful son inherits all
[17:42] these blessings he was the only one
[17:44] waiting to see joseph
[17:46] brother that guy got all many many
[17:48] blessings why because he was faithful
[17:51] who was like joseph the bible said it
[17:53] was almost a perfect name
[17:55] right he's only just said lie a little
[17:57] bit about the shepherds one time
[17:58] but look how he's faithful to prison he
[18:00] was faithful at his father's house
[18:02] faithful part of his eyes he's faithful
[18:03] to pharaoh this was just a faithful man
[18:06] you can trust him with everything right
[18:07] you trust him with your wife right
[18:09] right
[18:10] he was a good apart of his wife you can
[18:12] trust this guy with anything he wouldn't
[18:13] dishonor god he was always honoring god
[18:15] praise god and so god if you lift you
[18:18] read these i heard
[18:19] the preacher said judah and joseph get
[18:22] exalted as two of the most prominent
[18:24] sons of the whole family
[18:26] and out of judah of damon and also jesus
[18:29] christ that's a testimony
[18:31] what a testimony that jesus christ comes
[18:34] out of the tribe of judah
[18:37] amen
[18:38] so here
[18:39] judah takes the leadership from reuben
[18:41] the firstborn due to his sin reuben sin
[18:44] david took the scepter that's what we
[18:46] read there the bible said you have the
[18:48] scepter
[18:50] in verse 10 yes
[18:53] the bible said the scepter would come to
[18:54] him but he had to wait 640 years
[18:58] to get this scepter
[19:01] and all the good things came out of
[19:03] judah remember there was none that come
[19:04] out of northern part samaria
[19:07] let me just add this too did you realize
[19:09] that after after they broke up in the
[19:11] northern and southern did you realize
[19:13] all the tribes were called judah
[19:16] right
[19:18] but judah just
[19:19] because all the good kings came out of
[19:21] judah all those all those tribes that
[19:23] had land underneath the northern part
[19:26] they just all called him judah
[19:28] because that was such a good name and
[19:29] that's why that's where we get the name
[19:31] jews from you know
[19:33] the word jew comes from judah
[19:36] because judah became such a prominent uh
[19:39] tribe and it ruled all the others so
[19:41] well
[19:42] that they just started calling all
[19:43] israelites jews
[19:45] because they came because they were led
[19:46] by judah
[19:48] so their name becomes the name of god
[19:50] just like the lord jesus christ becomes
[19:52] the name of the bride amen
[19:54] there it is right now
[19:56] right now
[19:57] see like all jews are known by judah
[20:00] because he's the one that's losing
[20:01] praise
[20:02] his tribe was one of the greatest tribes
[20:05] the brothers bowed down the scepter was
[20:07] giving him all the kings came out of all
[20:09] the good people
[20:13] it's tremendous like god raised up judah
[20:15] right reuben falls sidney falls levi
[20:17] rises judah rises that's how our lives
[20:20] are right you know i hope all of our
[20:22] brothers and sisters get saved but if
[20:23] not church we're the ones rising
[20:25] praise god by the grace of god by the
[20:27] grace of god we want all the rights
[20:29] right i want all the rights
[20:30] but we're not guaranteed that
[20:32] we couldn't pray for it we could hope
[20:33] for it we can ask for it we should not
[20:35] we should ask for it we do ask for it
[20:37] but by god's grace we're gonna be the
[20:39] ones arise because we're in the house of
[20:41] the lord we love jesus jesus is in our
[20:43] homes amen
[20:45] see so that's this is this is where i
[20:47] love the the part about god's poor god
[20:49] god knows which of the sons are going to
[20:51] raise
[20:52] so he prepares blessings for them amen
[20:55] that's what we are church we are the
[20:57] ones that are going to raise by the
[20:58] grace of god
[21:05] now this is beautiful too jacob when
[21:07] he's prophesied here in genesis 49 he
[21:10] actually gives this is a prophecy of the
[21:12] messiah but it's not the first prophecy
[21:14] the first prophecy was genesis 3 15
[21:17] right the serpent is going to bruise i'm
[21:19] sorry
[21:20] the messiah is going to bruise the
[21:21] serpent's head the serpent will bruise
[21:22] his heel
[21:24] but then genesis 12 had another prophecy
[21:26] about the messiah he's going to come
[21:28] through abraham's seat
[21:30] and now god look how god just gives you
[21:32] more revelation amen as time goes on and
[21:35] now he says not only he's going to be a
[21:37] bruiser the serpent satan not only is
[21:39] going to be abraham see now he's going
[21:40] to be of this specific tribe
[21:43] so god is giving more revelation as tide
[21:45] goes that's just what happened with
[21:46] martin luther right john wesley now
[21:48] brother
[21:49] we've got we're giving more and more
[21:50] revelation all the time
[21:52] amen we have way more revelation than
[21:54] luther i went to a methodist church
[21:56] today we saw we have way more revelation
[21:59] than methodist by god's grace it's only
[22:01] by god's grace
[22:02] but that's exactly how he did it then
[22:04] that's how he does it today praise god
[22:07] he just gives more revelation to each
[22:08] generation that's seeking him god gives
[22:10] him more revelation about his second
[22:12] coming amen
[22:15] okay now let's examine just those
[22:17] scriptures again so verse 40 i'm sorry
[22:21] the holy spirit said judah will present
[22:23] will have the neck of their enemies and
[22:25] let's read psalms 18 40.
[22:28] psalms 18 verse 40. this was literally
[22:30] fulfilled in david
[22:52] here's the son of judah that i say like
[22:55] he's a
[22:56] offspring of judah saying i'm possessing
[22:59] the next of my enemies which
[23:02] which his grandfather prophesied
[23:10] this is over a thousand yeah i'm sorry
[23:12] about 700
[23:13] 700 years later
[23:15] he's fulfilling what his great great
[23:17] great great great grandfather said about
[23:19] him here david is possessing the
[23:21] promises of god amen
[23:23] that's beautiful
[23:25] i think the prophesied of it david
[23:27] fulfilled it way down the line
[23:29] now a lion's wealth the war speaks of
[23:32] the authority and power of a lion the
[23:35] leader right why it's king of the jungle
[23:37] so judah was going to be king of the
[23:38] tribes
[23:40] right because he's going to have
[23:42] christ is going to come out of him
[23:43] because christ is called the line of the
[23:45] tribe of judah
[23:47] also a law giver speaks of the
[23:48] succession of kings of judah until
[23:51] christ came
[23:53] i wish i had a list of those kings
[23:57] but you can see all the good things that
[23:58] come out of here
[24:14] so law giver rulers lions scepters this
[24:18] is the highest privilege was given to
[24:20] judah that's what it looks like
[24:22] because christ the messiah comes out of
[24:24] judah praise christ comes out of praise
[24:27] he anoints our praise now that remember
[24:29] that scripture we read it was kind of
[24:30] strange where he's going to have a
[24:32] vine around the whole neck
[24:34] that's interesting because all this kind
[24:36] of speaks of natural prosperity right
[24:39] but also speaks of christ because he
[24:41] wrote the coat he wrote the cult the
[24:43] foul of an ass
[24:45] remember when he came in on good friday
[24:50] and then also the bible said he treads
[24:52] the wine press of the wrath of almighty
[24:54] god
[24:56] so these scriptures seem to point to
[24:58] christ somehow prophetically you know
[25:00] the bible said that jesus
[25:02] uh would eat butter and honey did you
[25:03] know that
[25:04] and i was speaking of a spirit book
[25:07] so let's read that let's go to isaiah 7.
[25:09] you guys can see that that was so
[25:10] strange because it prophesies of judah
[25:12] having wine and milk
[25:15] but the messiah was going to have also
[25:17] oil
[25:18] they also have honey
[25:21] so isaiah 7 15.
[25:24] this is speaking of the spiritual
[25:25] blessing here
[25:27] say seven
[25:29] fifteen
[25:52] also have
[26:08] now eating butter and honey doesn't make
[26:10] you live a good life right but this has
[26:12] to be spirit i wish it didn't
[26:14] we'll give you passing that out
[26:16] right
[26:17] but butter and honey this must be
[26:18] thinking of spiritual things
[26:36] but it sounds really good
[26:38] just confess go go to your friends to
[26:41] tell them their fault sounds good
[26:43] but it's harder to do it's harder to
[26:45] accomplish
[26:46] not sure what's better than them
[27:04] brothers
[27:07] is
[27:20] yeah so this is the same
[27:22] section of
[27:24] this chapter seven you haven't mentioned
[27:27] you know what honestly i think about
[27:28] that i don't know
[27:32] so
[27:44] it doesn't seem
[27:59] obviously
[28:03] and then i put up here i put oil wine
[28:04] that's where the good samaritan jesus
[28:06] pours in oil and wine so again we have
[28:08] that connection his eyes are red with
[28:10] wine and he's got water
[28:14] judgment right to be an angry equipment
[28:16] but it can also be lessened right
[28:18] revelation
[28:19] uh first peter two verse two says desire
[28:22] the sincere milk of the word
[28:24] well here's the messiah now this milk
[28:25] his teeth are violent
[28:28] so he's he knows how to feed the people
[28:30] he's got the deal
[28:32] right
[28:32] in revelation 6 6 uh
[28:34] oh yeah he said touch not the oil on the
[28:36] line praise god
[28:38] you see jesus christ always associated
[28:40] with butter honey oil
[28:45] you see them connected with all these so
[28:47] i just think it's interesting those are
[28:48] connected with
[28:50] the other prophecies about
[28:52] judah being a lion and having a scepter
[28:54] it's all connected to jesus christ
[29:09] oh
[29:17] dan has dan is an interesting character
[29:19] he has a good start but then like later
[29:21] on
[29:23] a really nice start
[29:26] it just seems like the fathers of the
[29:28] faithful faithful but then not later on
[29:33] remember he was removed
[29:36] from under him
[29:38] i
[29:52] you can be recognized
[29:54] in heaven but not on earth
[29:59] okay
[30:00] so what does his name mean a judge
[30:02] because remember the mother said god is
[30:04] judge me and give me a son i think it
[30:06] was
[30:16] genesis 49.
[30:35] i hear this
[30:36] dan should be a serpent by the way
[30:42] and certainly he's going to be a snake
[30:45] an adder in the path he's going to be a
[30:47] snake aligned with that what kind of
[30:48] life
[30:59] imagine god describing your life well
[31:01] jesse's just going to be a laying in the
[31:03] back
[31:04] doesn't sound very good right
[31:06] it doesn't compare to like you're just
[31:07] ready
[31:08] it doesn't sound good like judah or
[31:10] joseph
[31:12] okay he's in the path that bited the
[31:14] horse's heels now he's biting horses
[31:29] so that part sounds negative
[31:42] moses said dan is a lion's wealth again
[31:49] he shall lead from
[31:51] god so i have a few history notes on
[31:52] that
[31:54] yeah let's give you a daily job
[31:57] oh yeah that's right
[31:58] yeah yeah
[32:13] and that's a great story he said so
[32:15] again the line is well
[32:17] and then he leads from the shop so let's
[32:19] look at this here so there's no mention
[32:21] you see the mention of land about dan
[32:23] no it's that quote from my grandmother
[32:29] here's some history he's the fifth son
[32:30] of jacob his mother was bill rachel's
[32:33] name
[32:34] god has judged me she said i'm grateful
[32:37] for herself
[32:40] the blessing pronounced on him by his
[32:41] father was dance of judge's people
[32:44] probably an illusion this is where it is
[32:46] uh to the
[32:48] judgment of samson who was of the tribe
[32:51] of dane
[32:52] remember he ruled he only will church
[32:54] for 20 years you know that chance didn't
[32:57] rule very long he only judged for 20
[32:59] years but the holy spirit prophesied
[33:01] that dan would judge the people
[33:04] in other words the holy spirit was
[33:05] prophesied by the great man
[33:08] right because he had a special place in
[33:09] the plan of god
[33:11] bring down the philistines
[33:14] right
[33:16] now here uh they have their place in the
[33:18] march it says
[33:19] they receive a portion of land
[33:22] now their territory extended from the
[33:24] west of ephraim and benjamin to the sea
[33:27] it was small but very fertile small
[33:30] place of really good
[33:33] sounds like archer small church were
[33:35] very fertile
[33:40] you go to church big church they have
[33:42] all kinds of false doctrines
[33:44] right or it's called as a that is a
[33:46] dominant right nobody wants to pray
[33:47] nobody wants to sing and you know
[33:49] so we got to remember you could have
[33:51] small but you can vary fertility very
[33:53] blessed
[33:54] it included among others the cities of
[33:56] lida akron
[33:58] jabo his farm is northern boundary but
[34:01] the district was too limited
[34:02] squeeze into a narrow strip between the
[34:04] mountains and the sea its energies were
[34:07] great behind its numbers
[34:10] okay now this is interesting they were
[34:12] they couldn't overcome the amorites in
[34:14] philistines so they long for another
[34:16] place
[34:17] so let's get down a little bit they sent
[34:18] out spies and then when they got
[34:20] reported back 600 of them girded on
[34:23] their weapons of war
[34:25] and taking with them their wives
[34:26] returned they marched to the foot of
[34:28] hermione and fought against the shem and
[34:31] took it from the sedonians
[34:33] and dwelt there and changed the name of
[34:35] the conquered town to dan
[34:39] this is where we get the idea where
[34:40] moses said he's going to be alive he's
[34:42] going to leap from
[34:44] so he left this his land wasn't big
[34:46] enough so he left to another land and
[34:48] overcame them
[34:49] that's interesting they couldn't defeat
[34:51] the one the two there but they could
[34:53] defeat the other
[34:55] right so that's interesting they have
[34:56] enough faith to defeat those two and
[34:58] rights of philistines but they come down
[35:00] there to herman and they defeat the
[35:02] sidonians
[35:04] so
[35:05] i'm not sure how that type works out
[35:07] right but the land they were promised
[35:09] they couldn't handle so they leave as a
[35:11] lion to another place and they get the
[35:13] victory right there this is all perfect
[35:17] this was four tall
[35:19] uh this one is supposed to be this
[35:21] wasn't too long for this
[35:29] is that processing some people have to
[35:30] wait a long time other people have to
[35:32] wait very well you had to wait 640 years
[35:35] joshua 19 okay this is four
[35:38] wow that was only seven years later
[35:41] moses died only seven years later uh
[35:44] they jumped from their other they left
[35:46] that land and they come and potentially
[35:48] introduce
[35:49] just like the holy spirit
[35:52] okay great now here so see they start
[35:54] out good right they get a good victory
[35:55] now here's where they fall away we're
[35:57] going to read this one too
[36:00] so the
[36:01] so this this gentleman named manny must
[36:04] be a historian
[36:06] he compares dan
[36:08] lot was under a similar temptation they
[36:10] seem to have succumbed to the evil
[36:12] influences around them they sunk down in
[36:14] the condition of semi-hedianism from
[36:16] which they never emerged
[36:18] the grounds of ruin which marked the
[36:20] site of the holy city sorry beside the
[36:22] city show that it covered a considerable
[36:24] extent
[36:25] but there remains no record of any noble
[36:27] deed wrought by the degenerate trump
[36:29] nothing good on this drive other than
[36:31] samson
[36:33] that's all they had their name
[36:35] disappears from the role book of the
[36:37] natural and spiritual israel
[36:40] right and that's where everything is
[36:41] very fine
[36:42] this is slide 27.
[36:51] this is where dan disappears right so
[36:53] dan's here when they come out of egypt
[36:54] remember dan's missing
[36:56] so because
[36:58] he started out good but because he got
[37:00] idols god took him out of the tribes
[37:02] and he's not even recognized right now
[37:06] but he will be recognized
[37:08] in the military exactly
[37:11] because that's the dead he raised back
[37:13] up right began himself
[37:16] religious people
[37:17] just facing people and then he'll get a
[37:18] land
[37:19] glory they're going to land in that look
[37:21] at a portion of that land with no wars
[37:24] this time
[37:25] he's got jesus christ praise god
[37:28] he's got the messiah there praise god
[37:30] with the rod of iron okay does that help
[37:32] my god
[37:33] dan started out good
[37:35] but then because of idolatry fell away
[37:37] yes you brought the idolatry solomon's
[37:40] son in terrible
[37:42] but that's what we saw at least he died
[37:44] he saw a dad going down to worship
[37:57] that's a great lesson for us we always
[37:58] have to feed our children you know
[38:01] the ways of god never let them see
[38:34] so this this this tribe basically lasted
[38:36] 500 years until the descendants
[38:40] said okay jeroboam okay king of the
[38:42] northern king right not judah the
[38:57] uh
[39:02] um
[39:27] um
[40:03] is
[40:36] in our life
[40:48] it was so crucial
[40:58] all right so now let's go back to what
[41:00] they said
[41:01] uh
[41:02] moses said dr jacob said he's gonna be a
[41:04] serpent right this could have two
[41:06] meanings it can be it could mean dan
[41:08] could be small
[41:10] uh and wise right the jesus said be
[41:12] harmless as a
[41:14] serpent why is it done
[41:18] but it looks like it means it refers to
[41:20] that idol jeroboam was set up because it
[41:22] caused people to stop me right
[41:24] like just like a serpent would cause
[41:26] that force to throw up with rider
[41:28] their idolatry threw off the whole tribe
[41:31] right now the tribe has thrown off their
[41:33] power ready their connection to god
[41:34] they're throwing off because there's
[41:36] something you know the safety taking the
[41:38] senior members idolated so for me it
[41:40] looks like idolatry
[41:41] i can't really see this one but it was
[41:43] possible
[41:44] remember dan was a small tribe the
[41:45] serpent's a small animal
[42:00] uh
[42:10] so
[42:10] after dan it seems like jacob just takes
[42:13] a break and he says
[42:14] i have waited for thy salvation
[42:20] about all the sons and then he breaks
[42:21] into the next
[42:23] group of
[42:24] the second half of sons but notice
[42:26] that's the this is the first time the
[42:27] word salvation is used in the bible
[42:42] this is the first time
[42:45] um
[42:47] okay here we see dan was removed on the
[42:49] book under heaven either
[42:55] okay so the
[42:56] lions well oh yeah it also could mean
[42:59] this when samson saw that line remember
[43:05] so it could mean that dan is a lion's
[43:06] wealth so he has been strength and
[43:09] strong like a lion with the spirit lord
[43:24] everybody
[43:38] so you guys have any questions about
[43:39] this you know
[43:41] anything that you thought this morning
[43:43] or anybody's false doctors
[44:43] it seems like jacob just takes out
[44:45] joseph
[45:01] joseph decided to go
[45:06] nobody thought joseph died
[45:08] right all those years ago
[45:11] in his life
[45:15] the rest of the holy spirit like you
[45:17] know taking out lehigh right
[45:20] taking out kills
[45:22] maybe the brother of joseph
[45:25] he also said he was so thankful
[45:29] he was such a wonderful son you couldn't
[45:31] have just one tribe god
[45:34] that's another thumbnail
[45:36] this is where he adopts him jacob adopts
[45:38] his grandchildren
[45:41] and now my two sons even master which
[45:43] were born
[45:50] they should be mine
[45:57] yeah verse 8 literally
[46:10] the blessing from the youngers
[46:15] so
[46:16] yeah that's that's all i can find in
[46:17] scripture today somehow
[46:19] it looks like god just want to bless
[46:20] joseph
[46:38] plus
[46:48] i might not have that answer
[46:50] any questions about
[46:54] yourself um
[47:42] is
[48:14] at the very end
[48:23] myself
[48:37] okay
[48:58] government
[49:05] um
[49:42] oh is
[50:06] wow
[50:24] i think
[50:41] your righteous development
[51:20] uh
[51:34] there
[52:07] okay
[52:41] is
[53:13] they
[53:31] um
[53:45] uh
[54:01] sit down with abraham
[54:18] is
[54:51] you
[55:07] uh
[56:01] it
