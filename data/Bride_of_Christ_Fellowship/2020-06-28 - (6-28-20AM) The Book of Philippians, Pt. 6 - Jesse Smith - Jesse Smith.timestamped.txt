[32:14] chapter one will just read out those
[32:15] scripture there I do have some quotes
[32:17] acacia after this after we read our
[32:18] scriptures so I like to go over those by
[32:21] God's grace like to look at the book of
[32:24] Philippians part 6 this morning Lord
[32:27] willing tonight we'll look at godliness
[32:29] on the stretch perform and let's cry
[32:32] what I'm feeling led to look at this
[32:34] morning so Philippians chapter 1 I
[32:38] believe it was verse I want to just read
[32:41] it verse 20
[32:54] so thankful for the Word of God you know
[32:57] God has been extra gracious to us you
[32:59] know we live in a very dangerous time
[33:02] you know evil seducers wax worse and
[33:04] worse because iniquity abounds the love
[33:08] of many shall wax cold it's a very cold
[33:10] age where there's not much love but
[33:13] within the Bride of Christ there's a lot
[33:14] of warmth there's a lot of love please
[33:17] God we should really of all the people
[33:18] we should really love the people here by
[33:21] God's grace and so we got to keep that
[33:23] love strong we gotta keep our our sword
[33:25] sharpened we got to make sure we're not
[33:27] deceived and God loved us so much he
[33:30] gave us the whole Bible which men and
[33:32] women have died for for 2,000 years
[33:35] they've shed their blood for this holy
[33:38] word these Scrolls that have been
[33:39] interpreted translated for us and on top
[33:42] of that he sends us a prophet and gives
[33:45] us 1200 sermons to listen he prays God
[33:47] to show us what is a hot look hot light
[33:50] look like what is a family what does a
[33:52] hot local church look like and God gives
[33:55] us all these sermons to help us line up
[33:59] our lives with that and so this week
[34:01] I've been listening to the church ages
[34:02] again from 1960 with some Myrna Pergamos
[34:06] yesterday I listened to Pergamos just
[34:08] great to hear you know the Holy Spirit
[34:10] moving in the home church you know and
[34:12] how brother Branham dealt with these
[34:14] topics so let's go to Philippians 1
[34:18] remember his church was just a
[34:19] continuation of the book of Acts we know
[34:22] God's restoring we should see him slowly
[34:25] restoring our lives to the book of Acts
[34:27] but we know his life was a star his life
[34:32] was a bright shining example of Jesus
[34:35] Christ and so that's why we thank God
[34:37] for the tapes we learned so much but we
[34:39] can also learn how our church can be
[34:41] more like Christ Philippians 1 verse 20
[34:45] I'll read a little bit here I'll just
[34:47] read this and then we'll read our memory
[34:48] verse here verse 20 says according to my
[34:51] earnest expectation and my hope that in
[34:54] nothing I shall be ashamed but nothing
[34:56] I'm sorry but that with
[34:58] all bonus as always so now also Christ
[35:01] shall be magnified in my body whether it
[35:03] be by life or by death for me to live is
[35:09] Christ and to die is gain but if I live
[35:12] in the flesh this is the fruit of my
[35:13] labor yet what I shall choose I what not
[35:16] for I am in a strait betwixt two having
[35:19] a desire to depart and to be with Christ
[35:22] which is far better nevertheless to
[35:25] abide in the flesh is more needful for
[35:28] you and having this confidence I know
[35:31] that I shall abide and continue with all
[35:33] with you all rather for your furtherance
[35:36] and joy of faith that your rejoicing may
[35:39] be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me
[35:43] by my coming to you again only let your
[35:47] conversation be as it becometh the
[35:50] gospel of Christ that whether I come and
[35:53] see you or else be absent I may hear of
[35:55] your affairs that you stand fast in one
[35:58] spirit with one mind striving together
[36:00] for the faith of the gospel and let's go
[36:04] to our memory verse here 1st
[36:06] Thessalonians 4:13 before 14-minute
[36:13] verse Estonian is 5:14
[36:28] let's read a 14 to 23 let's begin on
[36:32] three one two three
[36:33] now we exhort you brethren warn them
[36:37] that are unruly comfort the
[36:39] feeble-minded support the weak be
[36:42] patient toward all men see that none
[36:46] render evil for evil unto any men but
[36:49] ever follow that which is good both
[36:52] among yourselves and to all men rejoice
[36:56] evermore pray without ceasing in
[36:59] everything give thanks for this is the
[37:02] will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[37:04] you quench not the spirit despise not
[37:08] prophecized prove all things hold fast
[37:11] that which is good abstain from all
[37:14] appearance of evil and the very God of
[37:18] peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God
[37:21] your whole spirit and soul and body be
[37:24] preserved blameless under the coming of
[37:27] our Lord Jesus Christ let's have one
[37:29] more word of Prayer you can let's just
[37:31] bow our heads for word of prayer if you
[37:32] have a need on your heart let's make it
[37:33] known unto God today Heavenly Father we
[37:36] love you we're happy to be here we're so
[37:38] thankful for the beautiful weather this
[37:40] wonderful season we're living in Lord
[37:41] God it's also a great spiritual season
[37:44] to be living in where we can be high we
[37:46] can trim our lamps Lord garden where we
[37:48] can be zealous of good works and we can
[37:50] read your word Lord as it's a grand
[37:53] privilege Lord to be in your house today
[37:55] better is one day in the courts of Jesus
[37:58] than a thousand elsewhere so father help
[38:00] us to surrender as we sang Lord God and
[38:03] surrender our thoughts and Lord receive
[38:05] your thoughts meditate upon your word
[38:08] the Lord teach us Lord God these
[38:10] Commandments write these things upon the
[38:12] tables of our hearts more that we can
[38:14] see this restoration of the bride of
[38:16] Jesus Christ coming to pass in our lives
[38:19] we can see our lives transformed God by
[38:22] the renewing of our minds lets us Lord
[38:25] and bless all these saints that have
[38:26] made the sacrifices to be here and I
[38:29] pray you bless them in Jesus Christ's
[38:31] name and the church said Amen god bless
[38:33] you being see the priests go so we like
[38:39] to just take a few maybe let's take an
[38:40] hour or willing and we'll preach on the
[38:43] this these thoughts here in chapter one
[38:46] and we're really we might even get
[38:48] started on chapter two by the grace of
[38:51] the Lord today and I have two other
[38:53] thoughts I want to get to I'll just see
[38:54] where the Holy Spirit Guides me you know
[38:57] we'll see what the Lord does here as
[39:00] he's guiding us also I want to let
[39:05] everybody know if if you would like a if
[39:08] you would like a copy of the message
[39:10] software I'll just hold it up here like
[39:11] brother amen I don't know if you know in
[39:14] 2010 voice of God recordings put out the
[39:17] software and it's a great tool and it
[39:20] has like I was mentioning on Wednesday
[39:21] it has all brother Rams books that he
[39:23] studied from there's like right 30 or 40
[39:25] maybe more and you can search them by
[39:28] words and if you have a Windows computer
[39:33] and a work automatically I think I like
[39:36] Mac I just kind of got an apple you know
[39:38] a couple years ago and I just kind of
[39:40] stayed in that ecosystem but if you
[39:43] would like a copy of that voice of God
[39:44] said it's ok with what pastor buys it
[39:46] and the church can't afford it like most
[39:48] of you probably can't afford you know
[39:49] just five hundred dollars this month I
[39:51] mean which of you could which of you
[39:53] have just five hundred dollars laying
[39:55] around spy the software most of you
[39:57] don't I mean you have to have a savings
[39:58] that you know a rainy day savings which
[40:01] of you you know if you don't have five
[40:03] hundred hours laying around and you'd
[40:05] like a free copy of the software you're
[40:06] we can just share the software I want to
[40:08] make sure I offer that it's been a great
[40:10] help to me I have to buy but there may
[40:13] have to buy a crossover software to put
[40:15] on the Mac so I can run this old pc
[40:17] software so it cost me 40 bucks a year
[40:21] but to me that's nothing you know I can
[40:23] have programs books that he studied from
[40:26] it's worth every penny I love doing that
[40:28] so I just want to offer that if you
[40:30] haven't if you would like that software
[40:32] I can give it to anybody just got to
[40:34] bring your computer here I'll just take
[40:36] a few minutes maybe 15 minutes to put on
[40:38] the software but it's been a great help
[40:42] as we as I've been studying history I'm
[40:44] writing this second-to-last chapter on
[40:46] the church ages and it's been a great
[40:48] study through there so I want to look
[40:52] here as we look here in chapter one
[40:55] and like I said I want to get to two
[40:57] other thoughts by God's grace so we're
[41:01] looking at Philippians 1 the 22:26 I'm
[41:04] going to turn my Bible back there to the
[41:07] scripture I will be reading a few
[41:14] scriptures here so you might want to
[41:15] have your Bible handy now verse 20 I'm
[41:18] going to be again just reading the
[41:19] scripture and then making comments here
[41:21] preaching what the Holy Spirit placed
[41:23] upon my heart as I you know studied and
[41:25] prepared verse 20 now we know apologists
[41:29] got done he said he said my imprisonment
[41:32] was for the glory of God now that's
[41:34] contrary to what we would think we would
[41:36] think if somebody got arrested or was in
[41:38] a really awful persecution we would
[41:40] think the gospel would be hindered
[41:42] churches you know that even Diocletian
[41:44] he was the most evil of all Roman Empire
[41:49] do you know he and the other Emperor's
[41:52] that did this ten-year persecution they
[41:55] actually thought they would eradicate
[41:58] the name of Jesus Christ off the face of
[42:00] the earth and they were bragging history
[42:03] says they were bragging oh we we've
[42:06] taken the name of Jesus off the earth
[42:08] look at it now look how foolish they
[42:12] were they were so foolish to think if we
[42:14] kill Christians it's just gonna hinder
[42:16] Christianity in fact the opposite was
[42:19] true
[42:19] I don't know how God does it it's just a
[42:21] miracle but the more you try to destroy
[42:23] Christianity and Israel the bigger they
[42:26] grow even so God has a supernatural
[42:29] power I don't know how he does it but he
[42:32] just he multiplies the more you try to
[42:34] kill it the bigger it grows amen
[42:36] and so you know Diocletian that was in
[42:40] 303 to 313 ad this was you know which
[42:44] was like 2 over 200 years after Paul
[42:46] wrote this letter but Paul is even
[42:49] showing us this truth whenever people
[42:51] try to hinder Christianity or hinder the
[42:54] message it's only going to grow praise
[42:57] God because God needs to take it he said
[42:59] to every nation praise the Lord and Paul
[43:02] said even though I'm arrested he said it
[43:04] further the gospel in other words all
[43:07] those
[43:07] soldiers got to hear about Jesus Christ
[43:10] they all got the whispered say oh that's
[43:12] that fanatic who says he's a Christian
[43:15] they all say Jesus rose from the dead
[43:17] yeah right but if there is any desire or
[43:19] any those soldiers to know about Jesus
[43:21] and know the truth
[43:22] that was their opportunity to hear the
[43:24] message praise God and if they had a
[43:27] desire for God Paul already said God is
[43:30] not far from each one of us because in
[43:33] him we move and him we breathe and in
[43:36] him we have our being
[43:37] just churches you being on your job just
[43:41] you being with amongst your family it
[43:44] gives people a chance that are hungry
[43:46] and thirsting for God it just gives them
[43:49] a chance if they want to know God God's
[43:51] right there praise God
[43:53] you know why because he's right there in
[43:54] you amen so Paul realized even though
[43:59] I'm in prison he said I'm the gospel is
[44:02] being furthered praise God preachers are
[44:04] getting more encouraged amen they're
[44:07] getting more bold that some would
[44:09] despise him of course but he said most
[44:11] of them most of the real believers got
[44:13] stronger because of his persecutions
[44:16] amen in church the more we go through
[44:18] trials the more we go through
[44:19] tribulations or persecutions the
[44:22] stronger we're gonna get I haven't seen
[44:25] my life get weaker I've seen it get
[44:27] stronger praise God like I was saying
[44:29] you know I know I can list all the
[44:31] things they used to struggle with you
[44:32] know movies tobacco dirty movies and
[44:35] sports I don't see my life getting
[44:38] weaker brother bang I don't see my life
[44:39] you know surrendering back to those
[44:41] things in fact I find myself stronger
[44:44] towards those things brother Graham said
[44:47] in Ephesians H he said that was one of
[44:50] the reasons they could know they were
[44:51] backsliding the things they once left
[44:54] they went back to but if we stay o
[44:57] out of the things we once did that shows
[45:00] were still on fire
[45:01] it shows we still have our first love
[45:06] thank you darling I'm so thankful for
[45:08] the grace of God just as happy today as
[45:12] I was when I heard the message amen
[45:14] happy re man because God's Word it
[45:18] continues to unfold it can
[45:20] ten years to give us guidance and
[45:22] strength and protection and and health
[45:25] in this hour amen because you know
[45:28] church you know it's the truth
[45:30] there's gonna be a lot of message
[45:31] searches that take the mark of the beast
[45:33] because if they don't have a real love
[45:36] for Jesus Christ if they're not born
[45:38] again they're gonna take the mark
[45:40] because their money's tied into the
[45:42] system just like ours is the RAM says
[45:45] the Holy Spirit told the bride is going
[45:47] to be forced to stop preaching the word
[45:49] well churches that depend on the money
[45:51] churches that care about the money well
[45:53] they're gonna want to keep their truth
[45:54] doors open so they can keep getting
[45:56] their money but churches that don't care
[45:59] the real bride churches they will carry
[46:00] then take the money or take our church
[46:03] take whatever you want
[46:04] we're not taking we're not taking any
[46:06] association with the government and laws
[46:09] that that take our freedoms away we're
[46:11] going to we're going to keep the
[46:13] freedoms of the Holy Spirit
[46:14] well worship and brother Jesse's garage
[46:17] if we have to amen we worship we ever
[46:19] have to worship because we want to
[46:21] praise God amen so you see it's gonna
[46:24] eventually get to that if the Lord
[46:26] tarries you know if he comes in our life
[46:29] something like that is gonna have to
[46:31] happen and so we must be ready for it
[46:34] now praise God that's why you don't put
[46:35] too much emphasis on money right in
[46:37] buildings and things like that because
[46:39] that's not real what really matters what
[46:41] really matters is a unified Christian
[46:43] Church that you and I all want the same
[46:46] thing we want to see Jesus as a and
[46:50] that's all that matters amen that we are
[46:53] unified that in other words we don't
[46:55] love this world more we love the world
[46:57] to come or future holy we're looking for
[47:05] a marriage supper of the Lamb that is
[47:06] more important than anything we possess
[47:09] here praise God
[47:10] hey man it's so true and while we're
[47:14] waiting we shine the light like I'm
[47:16] thinking about for the Amen in his wife
[47:17] we've been able to go out to see his
[47:18] mother you know in Minnesota there what
[47:20] a great example of how while we're
[47:23] waiting that's your chance to further
[47:26] the gospel and and that neither of them
[47:29] have to preach anything because their
[47:31] lives will preach louder than
[47:33] their words amen now if God opens the
[47:36] door I know they'll testify I know
[47:38] you'll testify if God opens the door and
[47:41] people ask you bang how do you know
[47:42] Jesus is the Messiah I know you open
[47:44] your mouth and you'll testify but many
[47:46] times that's not how it will have to be
[47:49] Paul knew all these soldiers got got to
[47:52] hear the gospel because I'm here praise
[47:54] God they got to hear them to think about
[47:57] the name of Jesus Christ just because
[48:00] I'm here our lives further the gospel
[48:03] later it is our job to further the
[48:05] gospel and our lives will preach louder
[48:07] than anything we could say Paul knew it
[48:12] and he said just we pray for boldness in
[48:14] verse 20 his earnest desire was to be
[48:17] unashamed that's my desire I just want
[48:19] to be unashamed for what I believe and I
[48:22] want to be bold to presently magnify
[48:25] Christ in life or death see I want to
[48:30] make Christ greater with my life I want
[48:33] people to know Christ more through my
[48:35] life or dead so this retired requires a
[48:39] total submission up we looked at this a
[48:41] few month or last month rather than May
[48:43] so magnify means to declare great or to
[48:47] extort elebrate err so we we we make we
[48:50] make Jesus great by our lives or by
[48:54] death now Paul says I either whether I
[48:56] live or die I will make Christ great my
[48:59] life will make Christ's name to be
[49:01] praised amen
[49:03] praise God verse 21 he says for me to
[49:07] live is Christ and to die is gain so
[49:11] living here serving Christ he said is
[49:14] great but dying is gaining Christ so
[49:17] we're living for Christ here or if we
[49:20] die we gain Christ ah let's not feel bad
[49:23] for those who have passed away but
[49:25] they're real believer they've gained
[49:27] Christ they're not just living Christ
[49:30] they've gained him amen they're they've
[49:34] gained it they've arrived
[49:38] the Bible says right now we see glass
[49:41] darkly like this this is how we see you
[49:43] know we don't really know what's out
[49:45] there right but it's kinda like heaven
[49:47] Oh heaven I can see some glimpses of it
[49:49] in there but church women that when we
[49:51] can say this like we've arrived amen we
[49:54] can see it we will see Jesus amen amen
[49:57] and ball says if I live it's Christ but
[50:01] if I die I gained him praise God somehow
[50:04] like I said the last time I preached is
[50:07] somehow they'll come greet us and then
[50:08] maybe he'll go back to work I'm not sure
[50:10] how that works but we know things go a
[50:12] lot faster over there right we've got a
[50:15] speed up to go there because God's
[50:17] outside of time
[50:18] he says if I live in the flesh this in
[50:22] other words writing letters and helping
[50:24] the churches if I live in the flesh this
[50:26] is the fruit of my labor
[50:28] helping the churches yet what I shall
[50:32] choose I what not so see living here
[50:37] meant bringing forth fruit helping the
[50:39] churches and Paul but Paul was undecided
[50:42] about his preference he's like well I'm
[50:44] not quite sure what I really want to do
[50:47] but he tells us a little later in the
[50:49] next few verses he said for I'm gonna
[50:52] straight which means a pressure
[50:53] situation I'm gonna straight between the
[50:56] two choices heaven or state heaven or
[50:58] state having a desire to depart and to
[51:01] be with Christ which is far better than
[51:03] I imagined us this is the guy that went
[51:05] out in the wilderness mother May he went
[51:07] out in the deserts of Arabia and he met
[51:09] the pillar fire no wonder he went he
[51:12] probably wanted to go to heaven he
[51:15] remembers what it was like when they men
[51:17] to be in that room to be in that tent no
[51:19] not it was a tent he was a tech major he
[51:22] had a tent out of the winners and the
[51:23] pillar of fire would come in the tent no
[51:26] wonder he desired it's ok if I go home
[51:29] I'll be in the presence of that pillar
[51:30] of fire ah
[51:33] can you imagine most even I can't I've
[51:36] never seen the pillar of fire but can
[51:38] you imagine seeing it and then talking
[51:40] to it and seeing and talking that pillar
[51:44] of fire made him just like he was so
[51:46] he's so relaxed if I stay here praise
[51:50] God
[51:50] but if I die
[51:52] he's God I gain Jesus Christ the one
[51:56] that met me in Arabia amen the one that
[51:59] talked to me on the road to Damascus
[52:01] I'll gain that voice amen so you can see
[52:06] I've got desires the people really need
[52:08] me here but boy would I like to be with
[52:11] Jesus praise God
[52:13] now here this is why another reason why
[52:16] church which is different for us he had
[52:21] suffered greatly he wrote this letter at
[52:25] 56 years old now he lived from 85-82 64
[52:30] or 67 ad so he lived to be 62 years old
[52:34] right now as he's riding this he's only
[52:36] 56 now we look at that and that's like
[52:39] that's like middle age right they say uh
[52:42] they say 50 is the new 40
[52:45] but Paul he's gonna be he's 56 years old
[52:50] and he's he's I said I've already having
[52:54] this battle I'm only fit nah that's all
[52:55] her brother ran was when he died 56 and
[52:59] he's like I really want to go to heaven
[53:01] but I can see the people need me here
[53:03] the church he had suffered in his short
[53:07] ministry more than we've ever suffered
[53:11] remember he wrote now I mean we're gonna
[53:13] read this portion let's read his
[53:15] sufferings again real quick
[53:17] he wrote second Corinthians when he was
[53:20] 51 years old so five years after he
[53:24] lists Augustine he suffers he's like you
[53:27] said I'm just I got pressure I'm not
[53:28] sure it's hard to decide do I want to go
[53:30] home and I want to stay here so when he
[53:34] was 51 he already wrote this he said I'm
[53:37] in Labor's more abundant than everybody
[53:39] else I've been strikes in measure above
[53:42] measure even whipped above measure
[53:44] prison I'm in prison more often than any
[53:47] other preacher in death so in other
[53:50] words I've been the valley of the shadow
[53:53] of death very often of the Jews by
[54:00] times I received forty stripes save one
[54:02] now he wrote this that 51 I mean just
[54:07] think of that already
[54:08] often these face with death prison all
[54:12] the time wit four times three times was
[54:15] he beaten with rods once was i stoned
[54:18] thrice i suffered shipwreck a ninety
[54:21] today i been the deep so imagine that
[54:24] all night in a day you're in the deep is
[54:27] floating on a on a piece of wood how
[54:30] many would like that i get nervous just
[54:32] thinking about it like some you know
[54:35] sharks gonna bite me from below or
[54:37] something like that you know cuz they
[54:41] they say food i know my son and
[54:44] daughters like sharks you know he keeps
[54:47] and he's not even done he says I'm in
[54:49] journeyings often perils of water so
[54:52] waters that look like they're gonna
[54:54] drown him perils of robbers he'd been
[54:57] even nog too many times mud
[54:59] I've never been mugged now my car's been
[55:01] broken into but I've never had I never
[55:03] been at gunpoint well say like that he
[55:05] was often at gunpoint or knifepoint
[55:09] perros of waters robbers perils of my
[55:12] own countrymen Jews in perils by the
[55:14] heathen the heathen would want to kill
[55:16] him in perils in the city in perils in
[55:19] the wilderness in perils in the sea in
[55:20] perils among false brethren in other
[55:23] words everywhere he turned was trouble
[55:25] perils you think your life is gonna be
[55:29] easy when you become a Christian its
[55:31] peril now see that's a different age
[55:33] right that was the lion age we're in the
[55:35] Eagle Age right that was an appeaser
[55:38] nation now in the Laodicean age where
[55:41] it's rich and increased with Goods and
[55:42] have need of nothing it's different
[55:45] agents right but still look what he says
[55:49] in weariness and painfulness in
[55:51] watchings often in hunger and thirst
[55:54] there was times he was very hungry
[55:56] there's times he's very thirsty and
[55:57] didn't have access to food and water
[55:59] fastings often in cold and nakedness
[56:05] beside those things that are without
[56:07] that which cometh upon me daily the care
[56:10] of all the churches so every day there
[56:12] were some church some
[56:14] needing something from him if he's not
[56:17] getting his mug if he's not getting beat
[56:19] if he's not getting stoned then
[56:22] everybody needs something from him all
[56:24] the time so mom and dad don't feel too
[56:26] bad berries god I was counting yesterday
[56:28] how many times does my tutor say daddy
[56:30] daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy
[56:32] daddy
[56:33] and that's cake that's that's nothing
[56:36] compared to what this guy went through
[56:38] and children you can always say my name
[56:40] just say is it understand you know what
[56:42] I'm talking about when people need me
[56:43] sometimes
[56:44] not my children need me which is great
[56:46] but look how much they need it Paul he
[56:50] said every day every day people need
[56:53] something from me remember he was just a
[56:55] humble tentmaker brother bang he didn't
[56:57] have millions of dollars in the bank
[56:58] account he did he was so poor he said
[57:02] send me that one coat right before he
[57:04] died bring that one coat with me that
[57:07] wasn't a rich man so when we think about
[57:12] all that these saints went through
[57:14] church we ought to rejoice you know we
[57:16] ought to be thankful praise God for all
[57:18] the God's done for us we ought to thank
[57:21] God for men and women that have hazard
[57:23] their lives for the gospel of Jesus
[57:25] Christ that he wrote that when he was 51
[57:28] five years later no doubt we can see why
[57:32] he wanted how many can see why he might
[57:33] want to go home it's hard to be mugged
[57:36] it's hard to have everybody criticize
[57:39] you a name call you he said my
[57:42] countrymen the heathen everybody's
[57:44] against me except the churches but then
[57:46] the churches they always need something
[57:48] from me which they were poor he was a
[57:51] poor age it wasn't the Laodicean age
[57:53] right it was a poor age now look he
[58:00] next in the city looks like as he's
[58:02] riding the Holy Spirit writes this
[58:04] nevertheless to abide in the flesh is
[58:06] more needful for you so he's looking at
[58:10] it should I go Lord I want to go to
[58:12] heaven or stay here
[58:13] he said I'm he said I don't need to be
[58:16] interested in my needs I need to be
[58:19] interested in the needs of others
[58:21] so Paul models what a Christian should
[58:24] desire church when you have a desire
[58:26] well should I move here should I get
[58:28] this job should I do this our desire
[58:30] should always be what's best for where
[58:32] what's best for God amen
[58:34] what does God want for my life praise
[58:36] God and when we make decisions here
[58:39] locally what's best for the church
[58:41] what's best for the people of God you
[58:45] know Paul said it wasn't what was best
[58:47] for him it was what's what's more
[58:49] needful for God's people to see when it
[58:53] all comes down to it this is selfless
[58:55] Paul is humbling himself and he putting
[58:59] that he's putting the needs of others
[59:00] above himself I think that's a real
[59:05] godly thing to do don't you put yourself
[59:09] below other people that's humility
[59:11] others needs are more important than
[59:14] mine now verses 25 and 26 I'm gonna read
[59:20] him out of here because I don't have him
[59:21] up on the screen and having this
[59:25] confidence I know that I shall abide and
[59:27] continue with you all so he says now he
[59:29] said I've had this battle but I'm
[59:31] confident God wants me to stay and he
[59:33] did stay he said about five more years
[59:35] I'm sorry that was six more years yeah
[59:39] from 61 to 67
[59:41] he stayed about six more years so he was
[59:44] confident I think God wants me to stay
[59:47] praise God
[59:48] oh my he wanted to go home and see Jesus
[59:50] he won the game Christ but Christ said
[59:53] you got six more years of labor he said
[59:57] I know that I shall abide and continue
[59:59] with you all for your furtherance and
[1:00:01] joy of faith so Paul stank Paul knew his
[1:00:06] staing on earth he was gonna have more
[1:00:07] trouble more problems you know just the
[1:00:09] same old same old right but he knew the
[1:00:12] Saints would
[1:00:13] growing joy amen isn't that how you felt
[1:00:16] wasn't it great to see brother Brooks
[1:00:17] the other day one day Greg you see by
[1:00:18] the gamin
[1:00:19] what does that what does that
[1:00:20] automatically do it makes you full of
[1:00:23] joy amen
[1:00:24] it should at least right if you got the
[1:00:27] right heart right attitude so it you
[1:00:30] know along you know on top of the
[1:00:32] preaching and all the things the Word of
[1:00:34] God does just be with God's people makes
[1:00:36] you joyful because you know you're
[1:00:40] you're one of them you're one of your
[1:00:42] brothers and sisters your other children
[1:00:44] of God
[1:00:45] hey man it's your real family amen the
[1:00:49] children of God are your real family
[1:00:51] praise God so see was confident I I'm
[1:01:01] pretty sure God it's gonna allow me to
[1:01:04] stay here so you can have more joy so
[1:01:08] your faith can increase and your joy can
[1:01:10] increase that's what I say as a pastor
[1:01:12] if God wants me to stay here so that you
[1:01:14] guys everybody here gets more joy and
[1:01:16] faith I'm happy to do that I love this
[1:01:18] church I love coming this church I love
[1:01:20] it the whole time I want to be wherever
[1:01:22] I can be a blessing and be used by God
[1:01:25] right just like God told Abraham he said
[1:01:29] you're gonna be a blessing and people
[1:01:31] are gonna bless you amen
[1:01:32] that's what we want we want to bless
[1:01:34] other people and we want God to bless us
[1:01:39] so true verse 26 that your rejoicing may
[1:01:45] be more abundant see just Paul being
[1:01:48] alive who's gonna make them law
[1:01:50] rejoiceful is that a word I don't think
[1:01:53] so
[1:01:53] make them rejoice more may be more
[1:01:56] abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my
[1:01:59] coming to you again Paul knew if he
[1:02:01] gonna get just get there they'd rejoice
[1:02:02] they'd be so happy and I'm praying about
[1:02:05] our next guest ministers after brother
[1:02:07] Matthew I'm praying about which funds
[1:02:09] I've been praying about it asking God to
[1:02:11] show me which one that will bring us
[1:02:13] rejoicing right that will bring us joy
[1:02:15] and raise our faith amen I know he'll
[1:02:19] you know he's always right on time
[1:02:20] praise God God is always right on time
[1:02:22] see just Paul coming to see them again
[1:02:25] would make them reach
[1:02:27] and increase their faith like when I see
[1:02:31] brother Brooks preached hard like that I
[1:02:32] see cam preached hard like that that
[1:02:34] makes me one live closer to Christ amen
[1:02:36] right maybe it inspires me it raises my
[1:02:39] faith that makes me happy to say I'm so
[1:02:42] thankful these brothers are my brothers
[1:02:43] hey I'm so thankful to be associated
[1:02:46] with men of God like this amen
[1:02:49] because there's a lot of men of God that
[1:02:51] compromise I don't want to be amongst
[1:02:54] them I want to be amongst faithful
[1:02:55] brothers the real children of God now
[1:02:58] verse 27 I'll read it only now here
[1:03:01] we're looking this thought only let your
[1:03:03] conversation be as it becometh the
[1:03:06] gospel of Christ now this is a strange
[1:03:09] word conversation actually means
[1:03:11] citizenship so he said he said I want to
[1:03:16] make you happy I want to make you
[1:03:18] rejoice if I stay he said but one thing
[1:03:20] just let your conversation let your
[1:03:23] citizenship become as the gospel of
[1:03:27] Christ
[1:03:27] in other words live the gospel may live
[1:03:31] like a citizen of heaven praise God
[1:03:36] remember this will give me the last
[1:03:37] letter he ever wrote as far as history
[1:03:39] wheat knows or says I don't think he
[1:03:42] ever got back to it Philip I he never
[1:03:44] really got to see him this was his last
[1:03:45] communication with them he said so let
[1:03:50] me give you my request
[1:03:51] he said just let your conversation your
[1:03:53] citizenship become as the gospel of
[1:03:57] Christ that whether I come to see you or
[1:04:00] else be absent see he said I might come
[1:04:02] to you I might not
[1:04:04] he wasn't Darren thing and he wasn't
[1:04:06] prophesied or anything got in his
[1:04:08] shoulder my prophecy that he was going
[1:04:09] to make it back but he said whether I
[1:04:11] come or not he said let your
[1:04:14] conversation become as the gospel of
[1:04:19] Jesus Christ he said let me hear of your
[1:04:22] affairs that you stand fast in one
[1:04:25] spirit with one mind striving together
[1:04:28] for the faith of the gospel so Paul said
[1:04:33] whether I come or not I want to get word
[1:04:35] I want to hear how is the church at
[1:04:38] Philippi doing and I want to get the
[1:04:41] word
[1:04:41] there in one Accord there just like it
[1:04:46] wasn't Pentecost
[1:04:47] Paul says market say I wasn't there but
[1:04:50] I know what it would have been like to
[1:04:51] been there
[1:04:52] hey man cuz I've been dealing with the
[1:04:55] Holy Ghost amen
[1:04:56] I know what it would be like Paul prayed
[1:04:59] for them in court I'm sorry god I'll
[1:05:02] pray for them at Ephesus and the Holy
[1:05:04] Ghost fell that was and there's only 12
[1:05:06] people there praise God
[1:05:07] but Paul knew what it was like to be at
[1:05:10] Pentecost because it always falls the
[1:05:12] same way and Paul said keep that same
[1:05:17] mind keep one Accord amongst the
[1:05:21] believers keep that feeling like it was
[1:05:24] on the day of Pentecost where you're so
[1:05:27] happy happy to rejoice and your faith is
[1:05:30] strong and you have joy in your heart
[1:05:32] he said keep that one mind let me hear
[1:05:35] you report that everybody's in one
[1:05:38] Accord and notice he didn't say he
[1:05:43] didn't say let me hear that all hundred
[1:05:45] people get baptized did he did he say
[1:05:47] that no he let me hear that a hundred
[1:05:50] people speak in tongues do you say that
[1:05:52] no let me hear that you knew a hundred
[1:05:56] miracles or ten people get raised from
[1:05:58] the dead did you say that no he just
[1:06:01] wanted to hear that everybody is in one
[1:06:05] Accord did I say like this if your one
[1:06:07] Accord those things happen praise God if
[1:06:15] we're one Accord these things happen
[1:06:20] that was verse 27 see he wanted to see
[1:06:25] unity one mind striving together for the
[1:06:31] faith of the gospel
[1:06:33] so yeah conversation is to be a citizen
[1:06:36] this is the Greek here manage your state
[1:06:39] to be a citizen behave as a citizen so
[1:06:43] Paul said let your behavior let your
[1:06:46] behavior and citizenship be as the
[1:06:49] gospel of Christ so behave like a real
[1:06:53] heaven born child
[1:06:55] right live in this kingdom like you're
[1:06:59] part of God's kingdom amen
[1:07:01] now this just reminds me the scripture
[1:07:03] we're at Paul back in Ephesians 2 he
[1:07:06] said he said you were dead in your sins
[1:07:08] but Jesus quickened you used to walk
[1:07:10] according to the course of the power of
[1:07:12] the Prince of the air the spirit that
[1:07:14] works the turn of disobedience whom also
[1:07:17] we had on conversation and that's the
[1:07:19] same Greek word citizenship so you have
[1:07:23] to be able to look at your behavior as a
[1:07:25] citizen of the world and this should be
[1:07:28] totally different then your behavior now
[1:07:30] that you're a part of the kingdom of God
[1:07:33] so just a simple idea see a spirit leads
[1:07:38] you a spirit either the unholy spirit or
[1:07:40] the Holy Spirit and when you're a sinner
[1:07:43] you follow the leadership of the unholy
[1:07:45] spirit and you act like a citizen of
[1:07:48] hell but when you become a believer you
[1:07:50] act like a citizen of heaven amen that's
[1:07:55] why we have classes where in America
[1:07:57] where you have become American citizen
[1:07:58] now we just went through it right last
[1:08:00] year she is a citizen now she had to
[1:08:04] pass the test and was it a long test
[1:08:07] sister Elissa short test a short desc
[1:08:10] so they had to make sure you know sister
[1:08:12] Naomi could answer these questions and
[1:08:15] they knew she was going to know these
[1:08:16] certain things about our country certain
[1:08:18] facts about America and then if she
[1:08:22] passed the test she became a citizen of
[1:08:24] our country praise God and they expect
[1:08:27] her now that she's a citizen they expect
[1:08:30] her to honor the country and obey all
[1:08:33] the laws of the country and if you're
[1:08:35] born again you obey the laws of God amen
[1:08:38] the heavenly laws of the citizenship of
[1:08:41] heaven praise God
[1:08:42] amen she Paul said used to walk
[1:08:46] according to the course of the scene
[1:08:48] used to walk court of the Spirit I'm
[1:08:50] just reviewing this your works reveal
[1:08:52] your spirit faith works by love so you
[1:08:55] start with love for God you gotta fall
[1:08:56] in love with God that gives you faith
[1:08:58] and then you have to have faith you work
[1:09:00] if you love sin you have unbelief and
[1:09:03] you'll do sinful work so I'm just
[1:09:04] reviewing that because it's helpful it's
[1:09:08] helpful to remind us the
[1:09:09] if we're disappointed in our works it's
[1:09:12] because we got to fall more in love with
[1:09:13] Jesus we've left our first love and we
[1:09:17] got a we got to go back to the crops or
[1:09:19] repent and just fall again in love with
[1:09:22] Jesus that will strengthen our faith and
[1:09:24] then faith will go to work now verse 27
[1:09:33] he says my only prayer is that you have
[1:09:37] one conversation let your conversation
[1:09:40] be come let your citizenship be as the
[1:09:42] gospel of Christ whether I see or not
[1:09:44] you're standing fast in one spirit with
[1:09:47] one mind striving together for the faith
[1:09:50] of the gospel so pause one request is
[1:09:54] that everybody have the same citizenship
[1:09:57] and here he says strive together so
[1:10:01] everybody is laboring that's what the
[1:10:03] Greek word means to labor at the same
[1:10:06] time as one another
[1:10:08] it means laborer strive with me the rest
[1:10:11] of the Saints for the one faith so
[1:10:14] everybody has work to do praise God we
[1:10:18] want everybody doing a job for Jesus
[1:10:20] Christ amen we don't want anybody taking
[1:10:23] a break it's not time to take a break
[1:10:26] this is not in the labor for Jesus amen
[1:10:28] it's a good thing you're here cuz you're
[1:10:30] laboring for Christ a he meant he said I
[1:10:33] even if I don't come I want to hear that
[1:10:35] you have one conversation one
[1:10:38] citizenship everybody has one spirit but
[1:10:41] he's standing pass in one spirit and
[1:10:44] you're working together for the gospel
[1:10:47] of Jesus Christ so his big thing was
[1:10:51] just unity I want to see a church that's
[1:10:54] unified in the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:57] to live it every single day
[1:10:59] praise God if you could have one just
[1:11:06] one request I want to know that the
[1:11:08] Bride of Christ fellowship is unified
[1:11:10] they're standing together they're
[1:11:12] laboring for the things of God for the
[1:11:14] gospel of Jesus Christ everybody wants
[1:11:17] the same thing praise God this one
[1:11:22] Paul's desire a profit desired everybody
[1:11:26] working together
[1:11:27] look at verse 28 now here's where often
[1:11:33] satan starts dividing the church he does
[1:11:36] it through fear right fear either people
[1:11:41] be persecuted or from outside the church
[1:11:44] or Satan will send somebody in the
[1:11:46] church and to buy the church and then
[1:11:48] this group is scared to talk to that
[1:11:51] group and it's fear Paul says it's fear
[1:11:53] verse 28 and in nothing he said in and
[1:11:58] nothing be terrified by your adversaries
[1:12:01] see sometimes your adversaries are in
[1:12:04] the church sometimes they're outside the
[1:12:06] church praise God sin others do not
[1:12:11] become terrified which means frightened
[1:12:16] in nothing be frightened by your
[1:12:19] adversaries which is to them an evident
[1:12:22] token of perdition so in other words
[1:12:26] there's people that want to frighten you
[1:12:28] they want to frighten you out of serving
[1:12:30] God they were too frightened you about
[1:12:33] money right they want to get you scared
[1:12:34] about money I want you to get scared
[1:12:37] about your relationships or your future
[1:12:39] or scare you about other people in the
[1:12:42] church you know anyone that comes to
[1:12:46] frighten you Paul says that is a token
[1:12:49] that they're headed for perdition amen
[1:12:53] anybody that's rise to persecute the
[1:12:56] bride of Jesus Christ they're heading
[1:12:58] for destruction if they don't repent
[1:13:00] yeah that's what he says it is an
[1:13:03] evident token that they're headed to
[1:13:06] perdition when they persecute the Bride
[1:13:09] of Christ that's true that's what he
[1:13:12] says anyone that tries to frighten you
[1:13:15] divide God's body divide the Church of
[1:13:18] Jesus Christ he said they're an
[1:13:20] adversary and it's proof they're headed
[1:13:23] for him that's what I found through
[1:13:27] history church that's what brother
[1:13:30] Branham found - I was listening
[1:13:31] yesterday he told us how did you choose
[1:13:33] the seven messengers can you imagine not
[1:13:35] have
[1:13:36] forty books and mother I'm reading these
[1:13:38] books which one do you choose think of
[1:13:42] that like for the second age you had
[1:13:45] Iranians you had Tertullian you had
[1:13:48] origin you had a Novation you had all
[1:13:52] these men how do you choose which one
[1:13:55] was the messenger and my man told us
[1:13:58] it's the one that was most like Paul
[1:14:00] praise God it was the ones that fought
[1:14:04] against the Antichrist spirit
[1:14:07] it was the ones that were dying that
[1:14:10] were giving their lives for the gospel
[1:14:11] praise God it was one that were speaking
[1:14:14] out against false doctrine it was the
[1:14:17] ones that were trying to unify and keep
[1:14:19] together the saint they were giving
[1:14:21] their lives for the Saints living
[1:14:23] neither humble lives those are the lives
[1:14:26] a man that wrote and said that's the
[1:14:28] real child of God but the ones that
[1:14:32] we're trying to scare the true believer
[1:14:34] those were the children of hell Jesus
[1:14:37] calls them the synagogue of Satan it's
[1:14:42] proof of their destruction when people
[1:14:45] try to frighten you when it's proof of
[1:14:47] your salvation then those are try to
[1:14:53] discourage you from serving God those
[1:14:56] are try to divide the church those that
[1:14:58] try to frustrate you it's very the very
[1:15:01] proof that you're being attacked is
[1:15:03] proof that you're a child of God that
[1:15:06] God set my timer here so let me said it
[1:15:08] real quick so thank you lord
[1:15:13] now how many believe this is Holy Bible
[1:15:15] I believe this is the Word of God
[1:15:16] course you do and you know Jesus is the
[1:15:19] same yesterday today and forever right
[1:15:22] Paul said the same thing in Galatians
[1:15:24] the children of the bondwoman will
[1:15:27] always persecute the children of the
[1:15:30] free sorry see and we're not persecuting
[1:15:35] anybody like that we're calling out sin
[1:15:39] or giving warnings but we're not the
[1:15:41] ones being the persecutors we're being
[1:15:43] persecuted praise God usually from your
[1:15:46] families usually right or people that
[1:15:49] will turn in the church
[1:15:50] turn on you yeah because that was Satan
[1:15:53] and Paul says it right there whoever's
[1:15:56] trying to frighten you and scare you
[1:15:58] that's the devil so the next time you
[1:16:02] get scared I hope the Holy Spirit will
[1:16:03] bring that back to your memories that's
[1:16:07] the devil so Paul said stand together as
[1:16:12] one army working hard for the Lord do
[1:16:15] labor and strive together and if anybody
[1:16:18] tries to frighten you he said stand
[1:16:20] against that and keep laboring and he
[1:16:26] said let it be a token he said let the
[1:16:29] persecutor be a token that they're going
[1:16:31] to Perdition and let you the ones who
[1:16:33] United let it be a token that you are
[1:16:36] the saved of God I tell you it helps to
[1:16:42] reduce the books nice and slow doesn't
[1:16:43] it we might have just read over that
[1:16:46] looking I'm gonna write right over
[1:16:47] looking for my favorite scripture right
[1:16:50] but if you go slow Church as we go
[1:16:52] slowly through these things you can see
[1:16:55] how we're just like that early church
[1:16:57] how come we don't have more people here
[1:16:59] it's because we've reached such a true
[1:17:01] doctor and praise God Paul said there
[1:17:04] will be a great falling away of the
[1:17:07] churches perilous troubling times you go
[1:17:10] praise God but Paul said what you've
[1:17:13] heard of me what you've seen of me what
[1:17:16] you've learned of me keep that unto the
[1:17:18] day of redemption praise God and that's
[1:17:21] what we're doing we're keeping what Paul
[1:17:23] said and I'm always open to any
[1:17:27] correction if I'm not doing something
[1:17:29] Paul said then God helped me to do it by
[1:17:31] God's grace come show me where I'm not
[1:17:33] doing I want to do better you do too
[1:17:37] right this is the gospel this is this is
[1:17:43] the this is the blueprint brother ran
[1:17:45] cousin this is the blueprint this is how
[1:17:48] God builds his Holy Ghost filled church
[1:17:52] his one desire just be United just labor
[1:17:55] together everybody think about the same
[1:17:58] things that's we're gonna get to it I
[1:18:01] think in a few moments here verse 29
[1:18:05] for unto you it is given in the behalf
[1:18:08] of Christ
[1:18:09] now here we get they're getting a little
[1:18:11] bit of a balance here here you get a
[1:18:14] little bit of a bitterness there's a
[1:18:17] little bitterness for your belly right
[1:18:18] the Word of God tastes honey in your
[1:18:20] mouth but bailar bitter in your belly
[1:18:22] here's where Paul starts to bring it in
[1:18:24] no listen he says you're gonna have a
[1:18:26] lot of people trying to scare you
[1:18:27] the devil is gonna try to frighten you
[1:18:29] with Cova 19 they're losing your job or
[1:18:33] the economy tanking does that happen
[1:18:35] that happened in 2008 but remember with
[1:18:37] the house system went down or the real
[1:18:39] stakes I was nervous I was gonna lose my
[1:18:41] job they started laying off people
[1:18:44] frighten us he say don't allow all these
[1:18:47] things to frighten us Lisa don't he said
[1:18:52] don't be terrified by that be united in
[1:18:54] Christ for into you it's giving the
[1:19:00] behalf of Christ not only to believe on
[1:19:02] him but also to suffer for his sake
[1:19:06] so now Paul says see you have to have
[1:19:09] these people terrifying you we don't
[1:19:15] like it but we have to have people try
[1:19:17] to frighten you he said because not only
[1:19:20] do you have to believe on him you have
[1:19:23] to suffer for him yeah remember he said
[1:19:26] if you want to reign with him you have
[1:19:28] to suffer with him because power without
[1:19:30] character is satanic you you would not
[1:19:34] be fit to rule in the Millenium member
[1:19:36] if you're faithful with vibez five times
[1:19:38] for the man you'll make you rule over
[1:19:39] ten cities you and I would not be able
[1:19:42] to rule over ten cities unless we suffer
[1:19:45] here we wouldn't be one to be fit we
[1:19:50] wouldn't know how to do it in other
[1:19:52] words our trials now in these little
[1:19:54] tests teach us to rely upon the Word of
[1:19:56] God
[1:19:57] so that when the millennium comes no
[1:19:59] matter what the heathen nations do we'll
[1:20:01] rely more on the Word of God will we
[1:20:04] have a perfect a perfect application of
[1:20:09] the laws of God because we learn to keep
[1:20:11] the laws of God on this side praise God
[1:20:19] so see it's your adversities are given
[1:20:22] you for Christ's purpose see Christ has
[1:20:27] a place for you in the Millennial I know
[1:20:28] it's hard to believe Church it is for me
[1:20:29] sometimes too like that we use a little
[1:20:31] person like me and maybe rule over city
[1:20:33] yes because you can rule over sin now
[1:20:38] when it is just let's lay there in front
[1:20:40] of you like Joseph that with Popular's
[1:20:42] liven the temptations are just right
[1:20:44] there they're right there on your phone
[1:20:46] you know you can you can every
[1:20:47] temptation is right at your fingertips
[1:20:49] yet you deny it because you are the
[1:20:51] please God because your father is in
[1:20:54] heaven and you wouldn't even become
[1:20:58] because you're not a part of this
[1:21:00] kingdom really you're a part of heavens
[1:21:05] Kingdom
[1:21:07] that's Christ's purpose to believe on so
[1:21:11] we want you to believe in the midst of
[1:21:12] your trial and suffer in the midst of
[1:21:16] the trial verse 30 having the same
[1:21:27] conflict which you saw on me so Paul
[1:21:29] says you have the same conflict you have
[1:21:33] in me in other words the same thing Paul
[1:21:35] is battling the Lord I really like to go
[1:21:37] home I really would like to go to heaven
[1:21:39] now I want to get rid of this
[1:21:40] persecution I don't like living in this
[1:21:42] world Paul said you have the same trials
[1:21:46] you have the same conflict you rather go
[1:21:49] see Jesus so you'd have to suffer here
[1:21:53] for us it's like suffer through the
[1:21:55] temptations because nobody's been
[1:21:57] tempted like this day this is the
[1:21:59] greatest day of temptation and deception
[1:22:01] there ever has been right iniquity is
[1:22:04] abounding like it's never a bounded
[1:22:06] before it's like the days of Noah and
[1:22:09] not only is like the days of Noah it's
[1:22:11] like the base of lot I mean it's double
[1:22:14] at least double as far as temptations
[1:22:18] and tests and trials and mindmatters and
[1:22:21] demon powers trying to deceive and being
[1:22:24] the scene but Paul says you have the
[1:22:28] same conflict which you saw in me and
[1:22:30] now he
[1:22:31] to be in nice and now you need to hear
[1:22:33] see they'd heard about it from other
[1:22:34] people but now Paul says himself people
[1:22:38] had told that he know Paul really wants
[1:22:39] to go home he's 56 years old Paul really
[1:22:41] would like to go to heaven and they
[1:22:44] heard about it I wonder what the Prophet
[1:22:45] way no wonder why wouldn't want to stay
[1:22:48] and help us out we're now pausing with
[1:22:50] Paul tells him with his own words yes I
[1:22:53] like to go to heaven but it's more
[1:22:54] important that I stay here to increase
[1:22:56] your face oh yeah
[1:23:05] now let me get to this thought and then
[1:23:08] I'll I think I'll share these two
[1:23:09] thoughts well you know what yeah I guess
[1:23:19] we'll go okay now you're striving
[1:23:20] together okay some of my slides are
[1:23:22] sorry when the Bible said strive
[1:23:24] together it means actually you're
[1:23:26] fighting in a game fighting in a contest
[1:23:31] so it's kind of like football or
[1:23:34] baseball it's like we are on the same
[1:23:37] team and we're we're in a game we're in
[1:23:41] a contest and Paul says you have to all
[1:23:43] strive together to win the game Church
[1:23:47] have you ever seen a team sport
[1:23:48] where one person won the whole game for
[1:23:51] everybody have you ever seen that I
[1:23:52] never had
[1:23:54] I think about basketball then one person
[1:23:57] win that game know you've got to have
[1:23:59] all five people write soccer and I don't
[1:24:03] like soccer very much but I know a lot
[1:24:05] most the world does but you can't win
[1:24:07] soccer with just one player you've got
[1:24:11] to have everybody doing their part and
[1:24:13] they can't be distracted they got to be
[1:24:15] focused on the goal praise God
[1:24:18] that's what Paul Paul is using these
[1:24:21] sports analogies of these these military
[1:24:23] analogies to get them to see everybody
[1:24:26] plays a huge part in this game it's a
[1:24:30] great contest everybody's do everybody's
[1:24:33] part is so important and you got to be
[1:24:35] focused on being unified in one Accord
[1:24:38] for the game
[1:24:44] now there can't be any distractions
[1:24:46] Church we have to completely focus on
[1:24:50] get on the task at hand now I'm going to
[1:24:54] exports phonetics I'll just tell us a
[1:24:55] few just a little story you know some of
[1:24:58] the greatest sports heroes are ones that
[1:25:01] have had horrible situations half of
[1:25:03] their lives like their mom dad or mom
[1:25:05] southern mom dies their dad died and yet
[1:25:07] they'll go to the game the next day
[1:25:08] brother bang and had this great game and
[1:25:11] and and the sports writers will will
[1:25:14] honor them because they were able them
[1:25:16] to deal with the frustration and put the
[1:25:19] distractions away in and have a great
[1:25:21] game like that even matters right but
[1:25:26] see that's what a Christian is supposed
[1:25:28] to do praise God we're supposed to
[1:25:30] forget about any struggle any suffering
[1:25:32] and we're supposed to keep laboring and
[1:25:35] focusing on the gospel spreading the
[1:25:37] gospel furthering the gospel and Paul
[1:25:40] says that's what I want to hear about
[1:25:43] the one thing I want to hear about is
[1:25:45] that the church is focused on the game
[1:25:48] praise God on the contest amen but keep
[1:25:52] their mind on furthering the gospel
[1:25:55] above any I got something to tell you
[1:25:57] buddy this week a pastor called me up
[1:26:00] and he said we have a lot of extra money
[1:26:03] and he said what how much money could I
[1:26:06] give you brother Jesse I said I said let
[1:26:08] me pray about it because banging on I
[1:26:10] told him I said banging I were just
[1:26:12] talking about needing money to translate
[1:26:16] my book or go overseas remember we were
[1:26:18] talking about that last Sunday brother
[1:26:20] to preach to his people and it was just
[1:26:24] it was just something we were just
[1:26:25] basically talking just kind of generally
[1:26:27] talking about but I was I've always
[1:26:29] hoped been and Beggs always told me
[1:26:31] we've always talked we voice had that
[1:26:32] desire to go preach the gospel to his
[1:26:35] people and we've you know we've said in
[1:26:38] passing over the years Bay I kind of
[1:26:40] joke what time's a bang you could be my
[1:26:41] translator you know but you know I
[1:26:46] wouldn't have to be preaching just
[1:26:48] giving out the gospel like I said
[1:26:49] praying for people having a prayer
[1:26:51] meeting like Paul just have a prayer
[1:26:52] meeting you know my one that you know
[1:26:55] what brother said I've got
[1:26:58] I'll just say it $20,000 and they said
[1:27:03] they said we want to find that he said
[1:27:05] where he's looking at different churches
[1:27:06] but they were to find people that want
[1:27:08] to take the gospel and do something with
[1:27:10] the gospel you know I told I said the
[1:27:12] first thing that came to my mind is
[1:27:13] whether man said it by the hundred
[1:27:14] million dollars you know brother Graham
[1:27:16] would do he said I'd go around the
[1:27:18] country and set up meetings to preach to
[1:27:21] the Americans to get them ready for the
[1:27:23] rapture won't grogram do he told trip
[1:27:27] services so I said brother I said that
[1:27:29] was my first stop take the gospel
[1:27:31] somewhere
[1:27:33] I said let's pray fast let's have a
[1:27:35] outreach service in Cleveland or
[1:27:37] something I don't know
[1:27:37] I'll read service downtown Akron I don't
[1:27:39] know he said pray bite and that's the
[1:27:43] main thing church is praying about it
[1:27:44] remember the Holy Spirit told Paul don't
[1:27:47] go to Asia in Acts in acts 4 14 x-14
[1:27:52] though is a 6-minute 16 I might be wrong
[1:27:55] boy let's see back in other words Bank
[1:27:58] and I have good ideas and we have hopes
[1:28:00] and dreams maybe someday when it's got
[1:28:02] to be led by the Holy Spirit that's why
[1:28:05] I went to eyes that's why I said I'm
[1:28:06] gonna take any money time pray about it
[1:28:09] but brother and I told the brother then
[1:28:12] I just talked to you and he said oh that
[1:28:14] looks like the timing of God so just so
[1:28:18] you know it's something we need to pray
[1:28:19] about maybe after service as we close in
[1:28:21] a little bit let's pray about that they
[1:28:24] got $20,000 that he said we got to
[1:28:26] churches so maybe 10,000 that church
[1:28:28] 10,000 us what would you do if somebody
[1:28:30] handed you $10,000 and they said do it
[1:28:33] for Jesus kind well also I would do try
[1:28:36] to preach the gospel I mean it's the
[1:28:39] foolishness of preaching to say then
[1:28:42] that would believe they always is that
[1:28:45] way
[1:28:46] preaching somebody that we have to get
[1:28:48] people here to here preaching Amen take
[1:28:51] the Breezy to them amen so I just
[1:28:56] thought I'd share that because that was
[1:28:57] very timely yeah it was the Monday so we
[1:29:00] talked Sunday I got a call Monday just
[1:29:03] and this person never calls me I'll tell
[1:29:06] you after church but I notice on
[1:29:08] livestream now I want to get people
[1:29:09] I'll go get money
[1:29:10] Jesse now yeah you'd be surprised how
[1:29:14] many emails I got a week I got to this
[1:29:16] week asking me for money I'm like oh man
[1:29:18] I don't even know these people I can't
[1:29:19] send money to other people unless I know
[1:29:21] who they are I just have to have that
[1:29:23] unless I feel definitely led of the Holy
[1:29:25] Spirit so it's something we need to pray
[1:29:28] about if somebody wanted to give you
[1:29:32] money what would you do well I try to
[1:29:34] preach the gospel so see we have all
[1:29:39] these distractions in life but we have
[1:29:41] to be able to set those aside and stay
[1:29:43] focused on the game the Christian
[1:29:46] contests praise God we have to work
[1:29:49] together everybody has to do their part
[1:29:50] in the gospel let me close with these uh
[1:30:01] let's just read verses 1 & 2 now I have
[1:30:04] notes on these first few verses let's
[1:30:07] just read let's go to get your Bibles
[1:30:08] here Philippians 2 1 2 this is a great
[1:30:11] thought here and church the more I study
[1:30:18] this book the more I see Paul's main
[1:30:22] thoughts for the believers and he knew
[1:30:27] they were gonna die he knew they were
[1:30:28] going to persecute it Paul knew he was
[1:30:30] gonna die
[1:30:31] what is his main subject its unity of
[1:30:34] the mind you and I got three parts we
[1:30:38] hate the flesh right the souls the back
[1:30:42] the seal of God the nature of God but we
[1:30:44] live most of time in the mind
[1:30:47] Paul's main idea through every letter is
[1:30:50] just everybody think the same way he
[1:30:54] wants us to be brainwashed it's true
[1:30:57] it's true the whole point of Paul's
[1:31:00] letters many times no with at least with
[1:31:03] Philippians was to get them to think the
[1:31:05] same thing now prove it to you look at
[1:31:09] verses 1 and 2 in chapter 2 if there be
[1:31:15] any consolation in Christ is their
[1:31:17] consolation in Christ yes if any comfort
[1:31:22] of love is their comfort of love
[1:31:24] Christ yes if any fellowship of the
[1:31:29] spirit is there fellowship with the holy
[1:31:31] spirit in Christ yes
[1:31:33] if any bowels and mercies is their
[1:31:37] bowels and mercies in Christ
[1:31:39] yes remember these were in chapters
[1:31:41] before or numbers that was in the 1300s
[1:31:44] they finally put the Bible with numbers
[1:31:46] in chapters
[1:31:46] I was only 700 years ago so memories
[1:31:50] finishing the previous chapter you have
[1:31:51] to believe in Christ suffer you have the
[1:31:54] same conflict whether go to heaven or
[1:31:56] stay here and now he says if you have
[1:31:59] any of these blessings of Christ verse
[1:32:02] to fulfill ye my joy in other words
[1:32:06] bring joy to my heart you know you're
[1:32:10] gonna die you're gonna suffer but he
[1:32:13] said bring joy to my heart by what Paul
[1:32:16] that you be like-minded having the same
[1:32:24] love being of one Accord of one mind to
[1:32:31] see Paul asked are these five things in
[1:32:35] Christ and you would say yes all of
[1:32:39] these things are in Christ so pause
[1:32:41] asking in this F thing if to kind of
[1:32:44] make a point here of course all these
[1:32:47] things are in Christ
[1:32:48] well Paul saying if these are so obvious
[1:32:52] that they're in Christ then make my
[1:32:55] heart happy bring me real Christian joy
[1:32:59] by being in one Accord what is
[1:33:06] consolation it's encouragement is there
[1:33:09] refreshment in Christ I love coming to
[1:33:12] vastly God I feel so refreshed amen
[1:33:16] I'd be like hopping around and jumping
[1:33:18] around just steering brain then sing and
[1:33:21] the Malachi Lydia everybody praising God
[1:33:23] it refreshes you
[1:33:25] Paul says is there any consolation of
[1:33:28] course is there comfort of love no love
[1:33:33] of course it's a gopping which means
[1:33:34] goodwill is there benevolence you
[1:33:38] comforted by everyone's goodwill in
[1:33:40] Christ yes do you get fellowship or
[1:33:44] joint participation or that brother
[1:33:45] won't talk to me that sister won't talk
[1:33:47] to me no there's participation in Christ
[1:33:50] there's fellowship in Christ is their
[1:33:55] bowels which means it means like your
[1:33:57] liver and your heart and your most inner
[1:33:59] part intestines and your your large and
[1:34:03] small it means like your very deepest
[1:34:05] inward parts which means your most
[1:34:08] intense feeling do you get the best
[1:34:11] feelings of your life in Christ yes yes
[1:34:14] it's the best feeling you have all week
[1:34:17] is to be in the house of God hey and
[1:34:20] rejoice with Jesus Christ is there
[1:34:23] mercies in Christ yes you know Christ
[1:34:26] pities you Christ is gentle with you he
[1:34:30] longs for you thank God I'm glad
[1:34:35] somebody pities neighbors God
[1:34:37] babe I'm weak and I get discouraged
[1:34:40] sometimes too easily I'm glad there
[1:34:42] there's mercies in Christ Jesus if
[1:34:46] there's all these things in Christ then
[1:34:49] he says fill to the top of my joy fill
[1:34:53] my joy tip off top off my joy in other
[1:34:58] words make my joy run over because
[1:35:03] there's so much love in Jesus there's so
[1:35:06] much mercy in Jesus he said overflow my
[1:35:10] joy and be united with the same mind
[1:35:14] I wonder what mindset do you have coming
[1:35:23] to church that's what we need to fix
[1:35:27] it's actually someone need to fix up a
[1:35:30] day which reminds that when you get up
[1:35:32] in the morning mine wasn't very good
[1:35:34] this morning my body's tired I think it
[1:35:37] was exercising a little too hard
[1:35:38] yesterday you know played some
[1:35:39] basketballs now a guy hey I didn't wake
[1:35:43] up feeling real good just to say the
[1:35:44] least but see he says what what do our
[1:35:48] minds focus on throughout the day we
[1:35:51] often
[1:35:52] every day we need to think about the
[1:35:53] same things Christ the gospel furthering
[1:35:57] the gospel sharing the message with
[1:35:59] other people worshiping God amen if
[1:36:04] there's any love if there's anything
[1:36:07] good in Christ make the Prophet happy by
[1:36:12] hearing his message that's right praise
[1:36:15] God
[1:36:16] make the Prophet happy to know that his
[1:36:19] preaching has impact in people's lives
[1:36:26] because Jesus's love is so great because
[1:36:29] his mercy is so great
[1:36:31] make the Prophet joyful by obeying what
[1:36:34] he said now look at this church 10 times
[1:36:43] you can look it up we'll go over it
[1:36:45] maybe tonight maybe we will just switch
[1:36:46] over and back to this here for tonight
[1:36:47] 10 times Paul says Inc the same think on
[1:36:52] good things I merchants mr. Hanley's
[1:36:54] member think on these things be like
[1:36:57] minded being one Accord I may never see
[1:37:01] you again but just stay unified and
[1:37:04] don't let the devil frighten you don't
[1:37:06] don't let the devil be discouraged don't
[1:37:08] let him divide you but stay united in
[1:37:12] the one contest the one game of
[1:37:15] furthering the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:37:19] don't let anything divide Judy says ten
[1:37:23] times he focuses on the mind and no
[1:37:27] doubt because he's writing from prison
[1:37:29] if anybody was allowed if you would have
[1:37:31] mercy on anybody to have a mighty battle
[1:37:33] it'd be somebody in prison because they
[1:37:35] could get beaten starved ravished right
[1:37:41] if anybody could have mercy that we'd
[1:37:43] say well it's okay they went crazy
[1:37:45] because they were in jail because it's
[1:37:47] like lawlessness if anybody deserved
[1:37:51] could art could we can understand how
[1:37:54] they would have mine vandals would be
[1:37:55] someone in prison but Paul is imprisoned
[1:37:58] he says I'm rejoicing
[1:37:59] I see the Gospels being further he said
[1:38:02] let me hear let my cup run over by
[1:38:05] hearing that
[1:38:06] everybody's in one Accord everybody's
[1:38:08] got the same thoughts quite a thing
[1:38:13] isn't it quite a thing George I'm taking
[1:38:16] it by your quietness that you're
[1:38:17] thinking about that not saying a matter
[1:38:21] because you're thinking about my
[1:38:23] thoughts irony God to help me with my
[1:38:24] thoughts over and over Paul says same
[1:38:30] mind same Accord think on these things
[1:38:36] where's he dealing with which realm is
[1:38:38] he dealing with the flesh the soul my
[1:38:44] remember Church the mind is just I'm
[1:38:47] sorry the mind and words the outflow
[1:38:49] what's in your soul you know we can
[1:38:53] always tell many times many times you
[1:38:56] and I can tell what's on each other's
[1:38:57] minds by what comes out of our mouth
[1:39:01] right jesus said a good man brings forth
[1:39:04] good treasure out of his heart evil man
[1:39:07] brings out evil treasure for of the
[1:39:09] abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
[1:39:11] you know we could talk all day about
[1:39:14] different things but the main thing we
[1:39:16] should talk about is our maybe loving
[1:39:17] our children how we can let our children
[1:39:19] how we can love our husbands and wives
[1:39:21] how we can further the gospel of Jesus
[1:39:24] Christ how would you do some mission
[1:39:26] work how we can make our music ministry
[1:39:28] better how we can make our preaching
[1:39:30] ministry better right it should all
[1:39:32] focus on how do we better serve God how
[1:39:36] can we further the gospel that God has
[1:39:37] shown us he thought Paul thought so much
[1:39:42] of it he gave us 10 scriptures on it in
[1:39:45] this one letter I have to say think
[1:39:48] about the same things don't think about
[1:39:50] other things that aren't gonna further
[1:39:52] the gospel think about the gospel of
[1:39:54] Jesus Christ now as we're closed in here
[1:40:00] I would just want to just share a couple
[1:40:02] things here maybe I'll save the other
[1:40:04] one for tonight
[1:40:05] I think I'll share this one for the
[1:40:09] morning
[1:40:10] yeah and I'll share the other one the
[1:40:11] first one I want to share is about how
[1:40:13] sin came in the early church the second
[1:40:15] one is just my experiences with cultural
[1:40:18] integration because we're have
[1:40:20] all this racial stuff going on in
[1:40:21] America now just a small group it's not
[1:40:23] most most people are most people are
[1:40:25] simple
[1:40:26] sane people in America there's just a
[1:40:29] small crazy group that they are actually
[1:40:32] insane and devil possessed it's not
[1:40:36] millions and millions the remember
[1:40:37] there's 325 million people in America
[1:40:40] most people are insane or I'm sorry most
[1:40:43] people are saying rather and they're not
[1:40:46] crazy like a lot of these youngsters
[1:40:48] you're bringing down the monuments and
[1:40:50] all kinds of things killing people
[1:40:51] killing shooting cops I think I'll save
[1:40:55] that one for tonight but for this
[1:40:57] morning
[1:40:59] since we're coming in to July 4th
[1:41:01] weekend I know you got some good plans
[1:41:03] something good traveling plan that's
[1:41:04] wonderful we wish we could travel too
[1:41:08] and we love when we have traveled but I
[1:41:12] just saw a connection with July 4th
[1:41:17] who is our biggest enemy Rome Rome Levin
[1:41:21] says don't fear communism Romanism yeah
[1:41:24] why because it's disguised Christianity
[1:41:26] it's an iniquity filled form of
[1:41:29] Christianity but sponsorship and Satan
[1:41:33] knows we'll never go over and you know
[1:41:35] sleep at the bar and become drug dealers
[1:41:37] say no they never do that but he tried
[1:41:39] to tempt us into a religious experience
[1:41:41] that's actually iniquity filled right
[1:41:44] workers of iniquity but I was looking at
[1:41:47] the early church and I'll just take just
[1:41:48] give me three minutes here there was
[1:41:53] churches in Rome member Paul wrote a
[1:41:54] letter to Rome Booker Romans Christian
[1:41:59] authors say it's the most powerful book
[1:42:01] on theology ever and I agree I agree
[1:42:04] he goes through sin and then Grace and
[1:42:07] justification baptism Holy Ghost in
[1:42:09] Chapter eight he's had and then he's
[1:42:11] renew your mind in Chapter 12 and then
[1:42:13] the mystery of Israel at the end I mean
[1:42:15] this is powerful Gentile dispensation he
[1:42:18] basically covers the whole span of
[1:42:19] history in one book many ways Christians
[1:42:24] were banned by the bang in AD 41 number
[1:42:27] the Holy Ghost fell in a t-33 or 30 so
[1:42:32] about 11 or 13 years late
[1:42:33] Christian's get banned out of Rome well
[1:42:35] some of the pretenders Saints hung
[1:42:38] around the church the real believers
[1:42:41] were banned for 13 years a brother band
[1:42:43] even says it its history I got just
[1:42:45] bought a new book on it real Christians
[1:42:49] were banned out of Rome in AD 41 you
[1:42:52] know what the first thing they heard
[1:42:55] about you know what they first stumbled
[1:42:57] on holidays so we're coming up to 4th of
[1:43:00] July so I just thought I'd share with
[1:43:01] you now the ones that might get us will
[1:43:03] be Christmas and Easter or actually
[1:43:07] Thanksgiving too because people watch
[1:43:09] football all day and overeat they'll get
[1:43:13] in the flesh and though they'll just do
[1:43:15] evil things but the first thing when the
[1:43:20] saints came back by the bank the first
[1:43:22] thing they saw according to history was
[1:43:25] that instead of celebrating Easter like
[1:43:27] the Lord's Supper
[1:43:28] they started participating they would go
[1:43:31] out and join the feast of Ishtar because
[1:43:35] the church leaders allowed them to go
[1:43:37] out and celebrate the holidays with the
[1:43:40] wicked and they didn't participate in
[1:43:43] everything just a few things when
[1:43:48] Polycarp came there about about forty
[1:43:52] years after after the saints came back
[1:43:54] the first church of rome when the saints
[1:43:58] came back they could enjoy so they had
[1:43:59] to start in the second Church of Rome
[1:44:02] because the First Church of Rome started
[1:44:04] worshipping and holidays and they
[1:44:08] started bringing in the the wickedness
[1:44:10] 40 years later pilot car cane just to
[1:44:12] watch remember I told you Oh Lindsey by
[1:44:14] that time 40 years later they'd already
[1:44:16] made their own wafer for communion and
[1:44:18] started transubstantiation and before
[1:44:21] they left they had to bow down to the
[1:44:23] statue of Peter before they left
[1:44:25] polycarb just sat there and watch it and
[1:44:27] tried to correct the bishop afterwards
[1:44:29] bishop victor i believe was his name
[1:44:32] but it started it started by Christians
[1:44:37] being around sinners a little too much
[1:44:40] and then participating in their acts so
[1:44:44] you might have a cookout for July 4th
[1:44:45] well I'm saying
[1:44:50] if there's a listener feeding if there's
[1:44:53] not a lot of Christians there
[1:44:54] don't say long unless you're witnessing
[1:44:57] praise God cuz you don't want to start
[1:45:01] doing the works that will make you
[1:45:04] lukewarm do you that's how it start it
[1:45:08] starts with one little compromise then
[1:45:16] within 40 years they had idolatry they
[1:45:18] had transubstantiation which is more
[1:45:20] idolatry fifty years after that so
[1:45:25] hundred years later
[1:45:26] Tertullian came in and he saw the
[1:45:28] priests church he saw the priests taking
[1:45:30] bribes they were already taking runs
[1:45:32] from people to pay off their sins that
[1:45:36] was only 150 AD the priests were already
[1:45:39] letting certain men divorce and remarry
[1:45:42] in other words adultery was taken over
[1:45:44] it would just be 400 years 400 years
[1:45:47] later that the that very church the
[1:45:49] Church of Rome would hire prostitutes
[1:45:51] and they were known as a prostitute
[1:45:52] church so all the bishops could have
[1:45:55] prostitutes see how one little
[1:45:57] compromise will grow and grow and grow
[1:46:00] into more wickedness let's see how
[1:46:02] obedience will grow more and more into
[1:46:05] holiness praise God why by keeping your
