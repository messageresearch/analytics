[23:34] here I like to one scripture I kind of
[23:38] want to focus on tonight I think I may
[23:41] close well maybe not close let's go to
[23:44] Acts chapter 1 verse 3 I like to just
[23:47] look at the number 40 again tonight
[23:49] we're looking at biblical numerology
[23:49] again
[23:52] I believe this is part 16 we've been
[23:55] going right down through the numbers
[23:57] here and trust you've been blessed by it
[24:00] after what God did on Sunday I know God
[24:02] likes this message I know this wasn't my
[24:05] thought it was his thought the Holy
[24:08] Ghost could fall like that and feel
[24:09] somebody with the Holy Ghost and then
[24:10] you know meet these other people's needs
[24:12] then I know it's his word and of course
[24:15] not mine you and I can take credit for
[24:17] nothing and so God must God above I am
[24:20] said to God always vindicates his word
[24:23] so we're thankful for that so Acts
[24:25] chapter 1 thank the Lord I want to
[24:35] continue look at the number 40 we we we
[24:37] didn't get through 40 on Sunday there
[24:40] was such a tremendous poll we thank the
[24:42] Lord for that but I thought I thought
[24:44] I'd get all the way to 50 on Sunday but
[24:47] you all were pulling so much we couldn't
[24:48] get off that 40 so that showed us where
[24:51] we were all at seemed like we all needed
[24:53] help with temptations and tests praise
[24:55] the Lord so it seemed like the Lord was
[24:58] really dealing with us on that so thank
[25:00] the Lord for His mercy verse 3 let's
[25:03] read this together just verse 3 let's
[25:07] read on three one two three to whom also
[25:10] he shewed himself alive after his
[25:13] passion by many infallible proofs being
[25:17] seen of them forty days and speaking of
[25:21] the things pertaining to the kingdom of
[25:23] God that's of our heads one more time in
[25:25] a word of Prayer let's ask the Lord to
[25:26] bless the word of God tonight
[25:28] Heavenly Father this is your word not
[25:30] our word Lord God it's inspired Lord
[25:33] it's eternal Lord and father we ask that
[25:36] the Eternal Spirit would come and anoint
[25:38] your Eternal Word Lord God surely we
[25:41] need your grace surely we need your
[25:42] mercy Lord God Lord to help us tonight
[25:45] help us to dwell upon these things help
[25:47] us to meditate upon your word may we
[25:49] feel your presence fill this room Lord
[25:51] God and may a minister to every need in
[25:54] every soul Lord God surely your presence
[25:56] is in this place Lord God help us learn
[25:59] not to be distracted by anything of the
[26:01] world but help us Lord God to be
[26:03] anointed O God help us Lord God
[26:06] or be filled with your presence tonight
[26:08] Lord God or the Huichol Iver sang our
[26:10] hearts burn and not only that but our
[26:12] hearts will continue to burn and we'll
[26:14] take this anointing home Lord God and as
[26:16] we sang earlier let it start on us that
[26:19] the revival start in us we pray we love
[26:22] you Lord God bless each and every heart
[26:23] and soul bless those who have pressed
[26:25] their way out to the house of God and
[26:26] our visitor brother ray blessing and his
[26:29] home church their Sheffield Lord God
[26:31] ministered to them Lord God tomorrow
[26:33] night and and father were so grateful of
[26:35] their testimonies father just ministered
[26:37] by the Holy Spirit pray in Jesus
[26:39] Christ's name and the church said Amen
[26:42] god bless she's been seated praise the
[26:43] Lord so again we're thankful to be here
[26:48] again in the house of Lord tonight I do
[26:51] have the scriptures Lydia if we could
[26:56] pull that up here and I have some quotes
[27:00] Lord willing you know I just try to just
[27:03] try to preach you know what's inspired
[27:06] here so we're looking at part 16 here
[27:09] by the grace of the Lord now I like to
[27:12] just review these real quick I'm gonna
[27:14] skip back a few weeks to when we looked
[27:17] at the numbers now through the prophets
[27:19] quotes and the Bible I found the
[27:21] meanings of the numbers and I hope
[27:24] they've been a blessing to you by God's
[27:26] grace I was real blessing to me last
[27:28] week when we're looking at how 21 was
[27:30] then the the number of the arrival of
[27:32] the word you know Daniels message came
[27:36] on the 21st day from the angel right
[27:39] hagee I received the message on the 21st
[27:41] day of the month and I received a
[27:43] message when I was 21 years old amens I
[27:47] love how God speaks to us through his
[27:49] numbers praise the Lord so what is
[27:52] preeminence and primacy also unity
[27:55] they're all in one place in one Accord
[27:57] and not division
[27:59] difference testimony and then friendship
[28:02] and unity as well two fellows in one
[28:04] ship three is divine perfection bruh
[28:07] have said he's also said three is life
[28:09] well Aram tells us four is deliverance
[28:12] buh-bam says specifically it's also a
[28:14] double confirmation program also called
[28:17] it an earthly number
[28:19] five is grace or favor and also laboring
[28:22] grace buh-bam says and also Redemption
[28:25] six his fall man and beast and as
[28:28] brother Graham said he's six times he
[28:29] had had the spoken word he said this
[28:32] squirrel six times he said that's the
[28:34] number of man he says so six is an
[28:36] anointed man Adam was anointed on the
[28:38] sixth day he was anointed on that day of
[28:41] course he fell but he started out
[28:42] anointed and six measures time as well
[28:45] seven is completion eight is eternity
[28:49] first day again also new creation new
[28:51] beginning and means abundance in the
[28:53] Hebrew eight means abundance in Hebrew
[28:55] nine is fruit or consummation also can
[28:59] mean closure or judgment ten is divine
[29:02] order or worldliness is the opposite I
[29:05] think seems to be there's a couple of
[29:07] scriptures like the ten virgins seems
[29:09] like can be a faithful remnant two of
[29:12] the twelve tribes got their names
[29:13] removed off off under heaven right under
[29:18] heaven not in heaven under heaven
[29:20] according to the the seals taught us
[29:23] that the seven seals out is that so 10
[29:26] were faithful 11 is disorder or the last
[29:29] call were the eleventh hour' workers how
[29:31] many eleven our workers we got out there
[29:32] thank the Lord for that twelve is a
[29:36] number of government or rule also of
[29:38] worship 13 means rebellion it can also
[29:41] mean victory or Revelation it seems like
[29:43] because there are scriptures
[29:45] Joshua went around Jericho thirteen
[29:47] times six times and then seven times
[29:50] thirteen fourteen could be a double
[29:54] seven or relates to generations I'm not
[29:56] quite sure on this one that's why I put
[29:59] the question marks 15 was triple five
[30:01] could be or relates to the fee sirs I
[30:03] don't have a whole lot on fifteen
[30:04] sixteen looks like maybe a double eight
[30:06] not quite sure read that one a few weeks
[30:09] ago seventeen certainly means Christ
[30:12] bride certainly I could probably take
[30:14] away the question mark on that one I
[30:15] think we thoroughly proved it through
[30:18] the scripture seventeen seems to be
[30:20] Christ's bride eighteen not quite sure
[30:22] on that one nineteen not sure those are
[30:26] all the ones from last week twenty seems
[30:29] that certain Leiby expectancy twenty
[30:31] years
[30:32] you wait and then something
[30:33] seems to happen we prove that from the
[30:35] scripture okay so that's must been where
[30:37] we picked up the other week yeah that's
[30:40] where I picked up 21 was arrived of the
[30:42] word 22 seemed to be like double
[30:44] disorder but not a whole lot on that
[30:46] not much on 23 24 was definitely worship
[30:49] brother band taught us 24 was worship no
[30:52] doubt about that I didn't have much for
[30:54] 25 to 29 other than brother or than
[30:58] Abraham waiting 25 years for Isaac
[31:00] there's 27 New Testament books 30 was
[31:03] certainly leadership we saw plainly saw
[31:05] that from the scripture Jesus started at
[31:08] 30 years old David started at 30 years
[31:10] old the Levite started at 30 years old
[31:12] thirty is certainly leadership no doubt
[31:15] about that 31 to 39 were unsure I just
[31:19] had different examples I'm just kind of
[31:21] gonna skip through those and let's go
[31:23] back to 40 okay let's just I just kind
[31:25] of want to run through those and I think
[31:28] it's good Church to have those in mind
[31:30] don't you because as you have those in
[31:32] mind you can start seeing how God can be
[31:34] moving in your life now not to mate not
[31:36] to make every single thing like okay oh
[31:39] there's there's 12 ants over there
[31:41] something like that not to make
[31:42] everything spiritual but obviously when
[31:46] God was talking to people in the Bible
[31:48] it's obvious he used numbers to do it in
[31:51] all these 15 sermons hopefully you've
[31:53] seen that God uses numbers to talk to
[31:56] people praise God and so he does it to
[31:59] us as well now let's pick up here with
[32:01] 40 it could mean temptation or test we
[32:04] kind of focused on that on Sunday and
[32:06] persecution now we're gonna see tonight
[32:08] 40 can be a good number as well 40 can
[32:12] mean rest amen and 40 can mean
[32:16] generation now I don't I don't have much
[32:19] on generation tonight so I'm gonna spend
[32:20] most of my time I think maybe I have a
[32:22] few to finish up on these Lord willing
[32:25] so we start off just by Jonah gave ninna
[32:29] 40 days to repent so they had a 40 day
[32:33] little period there in which they had to
[32:37] repent and Jonah cried he said yet forty
[32:40] days and Nineveh shall be overthrown now
[32:43] can you imagine how he preached this he
[32:45] probably preached this church
[32:47] with the wrong spirit because he wanted
[32:49] them to die and sometimes as preachers
[32:53] or even as witnesses right sometimes we
[32:56] say the right thing but we got the wrong
[32:58] spirit behind is that right we've all
[33:01] done it I've said the right thing to my
[33:02] mom but it was the wrong spirit I just
[33:04] say I'm sorry write about something
[33:07] about brother Branham or or something
[33:09] from the scripture and we all do it but
[33:11] Jonah came in there and blasted you've
[33:13] got 40 days to repent and you're gonna
[33:16] be overthrown now what's interesting
[33:18] though when I looked at all the quotes
[33:20] from brother Branham on this
[33:22] I just basically come to this one I like
[33:24] Jonah I'm picking up here if this is
[33:26] from Christ identified the same in all
[33:27] generations
[33:28] like Jonah when he was delivered from
[33:30] the belly of the whale that was his side
[33:32] then his voice was repent or in 40 days
[33:36] you'll perish so there's always the
[33:39] voice going with the sign so beau Graham
[33:42] didn't labor much on the 40 at least
[33:44] what I could find cuz I typed in 40 in
[33:46] Jonah and this was the the most
[33:47] interesting quote I could find other
[33:49] than him just referring to the 40 days
[33:51] and he says the voice goes with the sign
[33:55] so the sign was a prophet being spitted
[33:58] out of a whale right and then the whale
[34:01] worshipers see that mine here comes a
[34:04] man he should not have lived but he
[34:06] comes out and they didn't know it but
[34:08] they were gonna say it years later that
[34:10] was a pre figure of Jesus Christ amen
[34:14] Christ coming out of the belly of a
[34:17] beast right Christ coming out from the
[34:20] from the depths of hell we'd say amen
[34:23] and that's what Jonah said he said that
[34:25] whale took me down to the depths of hell
[34:27] he said that and he said I was down
[34:30] there forever so three days can feel
[34:31] like forever
[34:32] you ever had three real days of hard
[34:34] trial you're not alone if it feels like
[34:36] forever Jonah did the same thing but if
[34:39] God's grace was sufficient to help him
[34:41] amongst whale vomit among seaweed
[34:44] wrapped around his face all because he
[34:46] turned his face and prayed to a human
[34:48] temple a man built temple how much more
[34:51] will God give you and I grace if we pray
[34:54] to the true heavenly temple
[34:56] amen but the thing is we've got to turn
[34:59] it right we got to turn from our
[35:00] attitude we got to turn from our our
[35:02] unbelief our excuses for our mistakes we
[35:06] got to turn from that and we got to look
[35:07] to Jesus Christ for he is God's provide
[35:10] a place of worship amen hallelujah so no
[35:14] doubt that was the sign a prophet coming
[35:17] out but you had to follow the voice of
[35:19] the side you know it's common I think
[35:21] you know it too you know we see it all
[35:24] the time you know people like Benny Hinn
[35:26] or or Marilyn Hickey different people
[35:28] they can all recognize brother Branham
[35:30] had a ministry that was from God but to
[35:34] save their congregations and to to fill
[35:37] their pocketbooks they all say he got
[35:38] off on his doctrine at the end of his
[35:41] ministry see they can all recognize this
[35:44] side but they don't like the voice that
[35:47] follows may God help us to be able to
[35:49] receive all the word that the voice is
[35:51] saying that followed the side and that's
[35:54] what we're seeing today we're seeing
[35:55] groups either drawing closer to the
[35:58] voice or they're drawing away from the
[36:00] voice we have to be a group that draws
[36:03] closer to the voice when brother Branham
[36:05] says we it's the will of God and we must
[36:08] do a certain thing you and I have to be
[36:10] the ones that say amen to the voice not
[36:13] try to silence the voice but try to draw
[36:15] close to the voice and obey the voice of
[36:18] God that's right praise God that's our
[36:22] desire is to hear the voice that follows
[36:26] the sign amen
[36:28] even brothers that have left the message
[36:30] I'll just call a name real quick I don't
[36:32] think he'd mind Geoff Jenkins even he
[36:34] can recognize still even though he
[36:36] doesn't believe the message even he
[36:38] still says after he left that it's still
[36:41] he's still a gifted prop a gifted man
[36:44] with him with a gift even they even he
[36:47] can recognize the sign right hey almost
[36:52] anybody can recognize that they're
[36:53] genuine side that's a genuine gift but
[36:56] it takes a special kind of believer to
[36:58] listen those sermons before the gift
[37:01] operates at the end of the sermon right
[37:03] and hear the voice of what's being
[37:05] preached before that and take it back to
[37:08] the word
[37:09] that's what you and I have to do by the
[37:11] grace of God amen
[37:13] take what he said back to the word and
[37:16] that's been my whole life that's been on
[37:18] my whole ministry I hope it's been your
[37:20] life as well your whole life is to hear
[37:22] the word that's on the tape and take
[37:25] that back to to the word and then apply
[37:28] it to your life praise God that's our
[37:33] whole duty is to hear the voice of the
[37:36] side now let's move to Moses Moses
[37:40] waited 40 years until God appeared to
[37:42] him in a burning bush right and when
[37:45] forty years were expired there appeared
[37:47] to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai
[37:49] angel the Lord in a flame of fire in a
[37:53] bush so remember this was he was 80
[37:57] years old which was two-thirds of his
[37:59] life right God couldn't use him until
[38:04] two thirds of his life was over but God
[38:07] used them in a great way now Church how
[38:10] thankful should you and I be if God got
[38:12] ahold of our lives before two-thirds of
[38:15] the way done right does how thankful
[38:18] should we be because because of Moses's
[38:22] mistake brother Graham said the second
[38:25] 40 years of his life was God beating his
[38:30] disobedience out of him let me share
[38:32] something real personal humbly that's
[38:34] what God has done to my father my father
[38:36] got right with God in 1983 but then he
[38:39] back slid and since 1983 he has he's had
[38:42] nothing but trouble
[38:43] 83 93 2003 2013 and he still tells me
[38:50] like I seen him last time he still tells
[38:52] me he's struggling and we know he's
[38:54] struggling think about that if God
[38:57] Tarrasch to 2023 he's had 40 years of
[39:00] struggle for what he told me was
[39:02] disobeying the Lord think about that a
[39:05] church you and I have a choice now
[39:08] you're in the best place you could be in
[39:10] the house of God judgment begins in the
[39:13] house of God it doesn't begin in our
[39:15] homes although we love our homes don't
[39:17] we
[39:17] doesn't begin in our jobs although I
[39:20] thank God for my job judgment
[39:23] begin their judgment begins right here
[39:25] in the house of God and if judgment
[39:28] begins with us right then how many
[39:31] scarcely will be saved out there who
[39:33] don't come to the house of God
[39:35] Oh advantage we have Church in other
[39:38] words how close are we to God's presence
[39:41] amen
[39:42] how close are we to God's heart to God's
[39:45] heartbeat we can hear it can't you hear
[39:47] on services when the Word of God is
[39:49] breached
[39:50] can't you feel God's heartbeat can't you
[39:53] hear it can't you skate you hear what
[39:56] God is saying for you and I to do to get
[39:58] closer to the Lord you ought to be able
[40:00] to hear that but because he disobeyed at
[40:03] the wrong time spent 40 years of wasted
[40:06] time but our God is the great Redeemer
[40:09] amen
[40:11] and use that last 40 better than the
[40:14] previous 80 amen right now that's all I
[40:21] want to read out of that quote cuz I
[40:22] preached this recently when we talked to
[40:24] showed how brother Branham didn't know
[40:25] everything you know some groups like
[40:27] voice of God are saying he knows
[40:28] everything every word he says thus saith
[40:30] the Lord but I've never said that and so
[40:33] they're there they're off the beam path
[40:34] but we pray for them and we thank God
[40:36] for what they do most of what they do
[40:38] but just spit out the seeds I guess
[40:43] right enjoy the cherry pies spit out the
[40:45] seeds that's the program dollars to do
[40:48] so I'm just gonna stop right there now I
[40:53] want to look at this church look at this
[40:55] this is so interesting then think about
[40:58] your life in judges 3 verse 9 the Bible
[41:02] says 2 when the children crying the Lord
[41:04] the Lord raised up to deliver to the
[41:05] church of Israel who delivered them even
[41:07] after yo look what his name means line
[41:10] of God what an anointed name usnea look
[41:16] it up in the Hebrew Lion of God reminds
[41:19] me of Ashland right reminds you the Lion
[41:24] of the tribe of Judah the son of caen as
[41:27] Caleb's younger brother ma look how
[41:30] faith ran in the family I thank God for
[41:34] the faith in my brother cam
[41:36] then the faith of my brother Simon amen
[41:40] the faith of my sister Betsy amen to
[41:43] count everything that they had before
[41:46] the message as done and to serve crux
[41:49] with all their hearts
[41:50] I appreciate that faith it was not only
[41:55] in Calum but it was in Caleb's younger
[41:58] brother the Lion of God came upon him
[42:04] and he does Israel went out to war and
[42:07] the Lord delivered shoosh shoosh on rish
[42:12] a theme saying that one king of
[42:16] Mesopotamia in his hand and his hand
[42:17] prevailed against I'm not gonna say that
[42:20] verse 11 and the lad had one Church rest
[42:25] for how many years 40 is 40 or is a bad
[42:30] number no 40 can be a number God used
[42:35] mops is for 40 years that wasn't a bad
[42:39] time that was a good time praise or in
[42:42] this case God blesses the line of God on
[42:47] earth and his generation after him with
[42:50] 40 years of rest from being under
[42:52] slavery hey man in church that's under
[42:57] the blood of bulls and goats amen amen
[43:01] under the blood of Jesus Christ when we
[43:05] know there's generational curses but
[43:08] thank god there's generation of
[43:10] blessings hallelujah amen
[43:13] think about that rose and goats but
[43:17] we're under the lamb of god who takes
[43:19] away all the sin of the world I started
[43:24] doing some math here before service I
[43:26] was in here prayer on my face crying
[43:28] praying and our nation is now 243 years
[43:32] old and we all know that program said
[43:37] that we know this my history our
[43:38] founders were real men of God and they
[43:41] went out and fought literal battles
[43:43] right there like the modern-day Israel
[43:47] they went out and fought litter
[43:49] battles and God has given us so much
[43:52] grace over the 243 years of our nation
[43:56] are you with me
[43:57] now you know though that in 1956 brother
[44:01] Graham said thus saith the Lord it was
[44:02] their last call is that right
[44:05] for revival and they turned it down is
[44:09] that right and that was at the 180 year
[44:13] mark now I don't have any further
[44:16] revelation beyond those numbers I'm just
[44:18] giving numbers but I thought was so
[44:20] interesting that with 243 years we've
[44:25] already had over 6 sets of 40 groups or
[44:28] 40 years over 6 sets and think about all
[44:32] those generations brother ray
[44:33] most of those generations have not had
[44:36] to endure war there's been a few World
[44:38] War 1 World War 2
[44:40] some of the Korean War you know we know
[44:42] that Vietnam Civil War obviously a huge
[44:45] one but think about all the year all the
[44:48] years of rest and I wonder where it came
[44:51] from
[44:51] there's rest from the devil or distress
[44:54] come from God Almighty what I'm saying
[45:00] is that these songs that we've son God
[45:03] shed His grace on America that's exactly
[45:06] right
[45:07] let me say like this God shed His grace
[45:10] on you God shed His grace on your family
[45:14] amen and you've got a right to clean
[45:16] that grace amen
[45:18] Lord I've taken your way amen and I've
[45:22] drove it out all the inhabitants of this
[45:24] land amen I knew you every enemy
[45:28] everything in my life that exalts itself
[45:31] against the message I'm defeated by the
[45:34] Word of God and if you gave them rest
[45:37] lord give us rest amen
[45:40] in other words let us not be enslaved
[45:43] let us not be addicted to less let us
[45:46] not be a slave to depression amen
[45:49] let's not be a slave to money and greed
[45:52] and prosperity does not be enslaved in
[45:55] there it leaves me free service living
[45:58] in peace and power of Almighty God
[46:00] through the baptism of the Holy
[46:02] hey man that's what I feel like when I
[46:07] read these scriptures because I'm taking
[46:09] land to brother ray we've taken this
[46:13] land Akron Ohio praise God we've had to
[46:17] fight for every inch for 13 years but
[46:20] we're finally getting somewhere praise
[46:21] of the heart are you understand we've
[46:25] gotten somewhere all alone I'm just
[46:27] saying I feel like we're getting we're
[46:28] getting momentum praise God if we can
[46:31] have a good move of the Holy Spirit like
[46:32] Sunday with no guest preacher it shows a
[46:35] little bit a lot of maturity in the
[46:36] church doesn't it that means you and I
[46:39] were able to look past the veil and
[46:42] recognize there's somebody greater that
[46:45] your pastor here there's somebody
[46:47] greater then your soul leader here
[46:50] there's somebody greater than your mom
[46:52] or your dad your birth sister here and
[46:54] that greater person is the Lord Jesus
[46:57] Christ and I've always said that that's
[47:01] the sign of a true mature Christian
[47:02] faithful church attendance full
[47:05] dedication to the house of God and being
[47:07] able to pull on the Word of God and
[47:09] receive revelation from God no matter
[47:12] who's preaching that's a real sign of
[47:14] maturity because Satan wants you to law
[47:18] you to sleep by all just the pastor
[47:20] we're not going to hear from God tonight
[47:22] I'm not going to receive any revelation
[47:24] we're just going through the acts that's
[47:26] the demonic lukewarm spirit that right
[47:29] and we need to tell that devil get
[47:32] behind me in the name of Jesus Christ it
[47:35] doesn't matter who's here as far as the
[47:38] physical people as long as Christ comes
[47:40] we'll have a glorious time you see 40 is
[47:47] a number of rest as well it's a good
[47:51] number now I just made a video about
[47:56] this it just I just uploaded it to
[47:59] YouTube on Sunday morning so it's gone
[48:03] to the 10 commandments apply to
[48:04] Christian so I this freshly on my heart
[48:06] of course they do because those same
[48:08] commands are found in the New Testament
[48:11] and that's how you know that's how you
[48:14] know if though if
[48:15] the law the moral or another the
[48:18] ceremonial law was fulfilled the Bible
[48:20] said we now have a new priest not Aaron
[48:22] but we have milk as a decrease in it
[48:25] that's how we know all those ceremonial
[48:28] laws are done away with but God's moral
[48:30] law it's the same because God is the
[48:33] same he said I'm the same and I change
[48:35] not
[48:36] and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[48:40] today and forever
[48:42] amen so I want to just go back and show
[48:45] you that when someone gets born again
[48:48] they enter in to rest and it's not just
[48:53] one day of the week like my Saturday
[48:55] Sabbath friends through email and text
[48:57] have told me it's that I would much
[49:01] rather rest every day of the week from
[49:03] my sins my sins slaving habits amen
[49:06] I remember this all seven days than just
[49:09] Saturday hallelujah that's what I put my
[49:13] book right there as you can get if you
[49:15] don't get a copy all right I think
[49:16] everybody got a copy if you didn't get a
[49:18] copy that's in Chapter two I'd much
[49:20] rather rest from sin every day of my
[49:23] life than just one day a week that's
[49:27] right Church so let's prove it now get
[49:31] your Bible I just want to prove this to
[49:32] you go real slow so you got this you
[49:34] never have to wonder about this again go
[49:36] to Hebrews four nine this scripture
[49:41] proves there's a rest that remains for
[49:45] the people of God see Church if the
[49:49] Saturday Sabbath was what God wanted
[49:53] then Paul would not have wrote this he
[49:57] would have said well the rest is already
[49:58] here it's just Saturday just just go to
[50:00] state stay in your house from sunset on
[50:04] Friday you know to sunrise on Sunday
[50:08] we're sorry sunset on Saturday night
[50:09] Yeah right Friday to Saturday night
[50:11] sunrise sunset right that's a day yeah
[50:14] that's what he said but he didn't say
[50:17] that
[50:18] now Hebrews 4 verse 9 there therefore
[50:23] remaineth a rest to the people of God
[50:25] for he that is entered see they remain
[50:28] there's still a rest
[50:29] the people of God that remains for he
[50:31] that has entered in his rest
[50:33] he has also ceased from his old works as
[50:35] God did from him Oh amen if you are
[50:41] really resting in Christ you cease from
[50:44] your sinful works praise God the custom
[50:47] I used to do the smoking the drink in
[50:50] the women shakes in the lesson to cut
[50:52] all of them evil movies and the sports
[50:55] addictions all those less than I used to
[50:57] do those were my works that I could do
[51:00] but if I've entered into the rest of
[51:02] Jesus Christ I cease from those and I do
[51:05] the works that the Holy Ghost wants me
[51:07] to do verse 11 let us labor so see
[51:12] you're gonna have to get out that
[51:13] laboring grace that number five you got
[51:16] the labor to enter in this grace which
[51:18] is mean sanctification you need God's
[51:21] grace to give you power to labor to
[51:24] enter therefore to enter into that rest
[51:27] lest any man fall for the same example
[51:29] of unbelief for the word of God is quick
[51:32] and powerful and sharper than a
[51:33] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[51:35] dividing asunder of soul and spirit and
[51:37] the joints of the marrow and is a
[51:38] discerner of the thoughts in tents of
[51:40] the harp so he's not talking about a
[51:42] Saturday rest he's talking about it
[51:45] comes by the Word of God amen and that
[51:49] word divides your soul from your human
[51:51] spirit so we are not like the
[51:54] Pentecostals that they just try to get
[51:55] the Holy Ghost in your spirit speak in
[51:57] tongues come on speak in tongues come on
[51:59] speaking to see the Holy Ghost says see
[52:02] a divided spirit and soul and so now as
[52:06] we know the real baptism the Holy Ghost
[52:08] if you speak in tongues that's a great
[52:10] thing but that's not the sign of it the
[52:13] sign of is it is that the Holy Ghost is
[52:15] in your soul and your whole life is
[52:18] working for God's purpose because Jesus
[52:22] said in John 16:13 he said when the Holy
[52:24] Spirit comes he will guide you into
[52:27] denominational truth no I miss Corder
[52:29] that he said I'll guide you into all
[52:31] truth and Jesus said thy Word is truth
[52:34] so in other words it'll guide you into
[52:36] all the Word of God but we where where
[52:41] we see people stopped today in the
[52:42] message they
[52:43] after God sent a prophet and they don't
[52:45] go any further they they really don't
[52:47] study well what does the Bible say about
[52:49] modesty but what are actually the
[52:52] scriptures that God says about the
[52:54] nothing gifts to the holy spirit all
[52:56] right with me
[52:57] they they they just know that they they
[52:59] they they're to just content well we're
[53:01] out of their system and so we're fine
[53:04] but no if you got if you got to get born
[53:06] again you got the labor to enter into
[53:09] the rest and when you're resting you no
[53:11] longer live to the lusts of the way you
[53:14] live your whole life to the things of
[53:16] God through the Holy Spirit's power
[53:18] that's right so see the rest is
[53:22] connected to the word dividing your soul
[53:25] and spirit amen now go to Matthew 11:28
[53:30] 29 oso simple when the Holy Ghost shows
[53:34] these things my child could see it thank
[53:38] the Lord that we must become like a
[53:40] child to enter the kingdom of God
[53:42] Matthew 11:28 29 I'm trying to show you
[53:47] a 40 this is a good 40 hey man this is
[53:50] what we want to enter into the rest the
[53:53] spiritual rest praise God
[53:55] now look at 28 come unto me all you that
[53:59] labor or heavy laden and I will give you
[54:01] rest well I thought the Old Testament
[54:04] gave you rest I thought it's just
[54:05] Saturday Jesus take my yoke upon you and
[54:08] learn of me right why did you say oh
[54:11] just do the fifth commandment right or
[54:15] forth come I'm sorry fourth commandment
[54:16] support command
[54:17] fifth is the children so you take my
[54:20] yoke upon you and learn of me for I am
[54:22] meek and lowly in heart you shall find
[54:23] rest unto your what so this is different
[54:27] the Saturday rest was rest for your body
[54:29] but Jesus is introducing a new covenant
[54:32] and he's saying there's a new rest it's
[54:34] not for your flesh it's not even for
[54:36] your mind because Satan still has access
[54:38] to your minds and there's hardly any
[54:41] rest for your minds right oh but there
[54:43] is rest for your soul the nature of your
[54:46] soul it can go from unbelief and it can
[54:49] turn into faith hallelujah and then it
[54:52] can rest and no longer disbelieves it
[54:54] always believes God's presence is
[54:56] sealing
[54:57] there and it's a real child of God from
[54:59] now on that's the latest that would be a
[55:02] part of amen
[55:03] that no matter of the struggles out here
[55:06] or in here if I just sit down long
[55:09] enough and start praying long enough
[55:10] pretty soon I'll get it I'll get a
[55:12] message from the soul man hey Matt the
[55:15] nature of God will tell me this is right
[55:17] or this is wrong I'm gonna go with the
[55:19] ride amen
[55:20] yeah I'm gonna rest in that I'm not
[55:23] gonna let myself be worried up here I'm
[55:26] gonna rest and what the nature in my
[55:28] soul tells me to rest it tell you with
[55:31] me see why this is important Church this
[55:34] is extremely important people think well
[55:37] I shouted or I danced in this beer or
[55:40] like Sunday people could say well I
[55:41] cried at the altar well that that's good
[55:43] but now watch your life afterwards and
[55:47] make sure your life lines up with this
[55:49] holy book right here and then make sure
[55:51] you you start resting from sin you're
[55:55] not a participant in it you're not
[55:57] active in sin you're resting from sin
[56:00] then you'll see pretty good what you
[56:03] brought like Marisa then you'll see
[56:04] which win hit you he said I got hit I
[56:07] got smacked my winning Church I'm born
[56:08] again my parents said well let's find
[56:09] out where that wind came from and the
[56:12] way we find out is watching how you live
[56:14] after you got hit by that wind glory
[56:18] good isaiah 28:11
[56:30] isaiah 28:11 now paul
[56:38] Quotes this next we'll read it next but
[56:40] let's just look at this scripture
[56:42] briefly actually I start at verse
[56:53] started verse seven okay I didn't plan
[56:55] to read all this but I think we'll just
[56:56] take our time tonight but they also have
[56:59] erred through wine and through strong
[57:01] drink our out of the way the priest and
[57:03] the Prophet have erred through strong
[57:04] drink now he's talking about if you look
[57:08] at verse one he's talking about the
[57:09] drunkards of Ephraim okay so he's
[57:12] basically rebuking Israel they have a
[57:14] brother in verse three says they have a
[57:16] crown of pride so they've crowned
[57:18] themselves with pride instead of letting
[57:20] God crown them with humility right
[57:27] they've erred through strong drink
[57:29] they're swelled up of wine they're out
[57:32] of the way through strong drink they err
[57:33] in vision they stumble in judgment so
[57:36] they were actually getting drunk with
[57:38] literal wine and then trying to get in
[57:40] the spirit I'm glad we don't have to
[57:42] worry about that praise God I'm glad you
[57:45] and I can get drunk on the spirit just
[57:47] by confessing our sins worshiping saying
[57:49] Amen getting in the spirit praising God
[57:52] hearing the word and agreeing with
[57:54] everything God's Word says we get the
[57:57] spirit just doing that yes verse eight I
[58:02] look this is denominations program said
[58:05] this verse refers to denominations today
[58:07] for all tables are full of vomit and
[58:10] filthiness said there is no place clean
[58:14] so they cannot go to any service and
[58:17] really have a real church service in
[58:19] Israel it was awful in other words
[58:21] spiritual vomit like Jesus said it made
[58:23] him sick and so he vomited them out of
[58:25] his mouth they were lukewarm so they
[58:29] went through part of the motions but not
[58:31] all the motions Church the same thing
[58:33] can happen here if we just go through
[58:34] the motions and come to church and we
[58:36] don't live what's being preached at home
[58:38] our church will turn into a lukewarm
[58:40] table and the only thing that left is
[58:43] Jesus can't speak how to speak to us
[58:45] anymore but if we keep our lives clean
[58:47] we keep on altar clean we keep our altar
[58:50] on clean
[58:51] when we come to church we can expect to
[58:53] have a table that's clean and hear from
[58:55] God and feasts on his holy word but if
[59:00] not we'll have a lot of awful smells
[59:03] here I have a lot of awful condition
[59:06] we've got to live a Pure Life before God
[59:10] they couldn't find one clean place well
[59:13] I wonder if I wonder if the the brazen
[59:15] altar is clean no that's that's full of
[59:17] vomit I wonder if the brazen Laver is
[59:20] clean no that's full of can you imagine
[59:21] the brazen Laver full of vomit it's
[59:23] supposed to be filled with clean water
[59:24] and this is what God sees when people
[59:28] live half hearted lukewarm lies and they
[59:30] put cried said well I'm in the message I
[59:32] don't have to fast and pray anymore I'll
[59:34] have to draw closer to God have to read
[59:35] my Bible I'll have to do what the
[59:37] preacher says they've crown themselves
[59:39] with a crowd of bride lukewarm it shows
[59:42] they're not hungry and thirsty for
[59:44] Rice's it shows they're hungry and
[59:46] thirsty for our righteousness they go in
[59:52] the holy place the breads moldy there's
[59:54] alter their vomit on the key imagine
[59:56] bread vomit on it Molden command the
[1:00:00] candlesticks gone out the altar of
[1:00:02] incense I'm an owner I mean that's the
[1:00:04] picture God's giving if we don't live
[1:00:07] sincerely before God it becomes a
[1:00:09] disgrace oh but if we live holy and
[1:00:12] clean before God it becomes that the
[1:00:15] chosen place of God's worship amen all
[1:00:19] right so we won't have Church amen no
[1:00:21] matter if there's two people in the
[1:00:22] church or two hundred what does it
[1:00:26] matter it's got to be clean so let it
[1:00:30] start at me praise God
[1:00:31] let's start in you you're the only one
[1:00:35] that gives you you're the only one
[1:00:36] that's in charge of your life you can't
[1:00:39] make me live holy I can't make Univ only
[1:00:41] we got let the Holy Ghost help us live
[1:00:43] holy we got to yield to him now look at
[1:00:47] verse 9 whom should I teach knowledge
[1:00:48] whom should I make to understand
[1:00:50] doctrine then that are weaned from the
[1:00:52] milk and drawn from the breasts so see
[1:00:54] there they're busy getting drunk on
[1:00:55] natural drink
[1:00:56] and God says you've got a nurse from L
[1:00:58] shoddy eye for
[1:01:02] except or commandment must be upon
[1:01:03] precept precept upon precept line upon
[1:01:05] line line upon line here a little and
[1:01:07] there a little so that's exactly that's
[1:01:12] exactly what Jesus tells us in the Bible
[1:01:17] and it's exactly what we see Paul doing
[1:01:20] Paul what he will tell a doctrine and
[1:01:23] he'll start pulling scriptures from all
[1:01:24] over the Old Testament can I show you a
[1:01:26] quick example this just kind of came to
[1:01:27] my mind I have this video saved on here
[1:01:31] and maybe it's still on here I hope it's
[1:01:33] still on here I wasn't planning this so
[1:01:38] forgive me here it is
[1:01:39] so let's look what I found this in a
[1:01:42] book a few years ago let's look at what
[1:01:44] the prophets said about Jesus and look
[1:01:46] how look how all these prophecies about
[1:01:48] Jesus first coming were scattered all
[1:01:51] over the only way you would have known
[1:01:53] Jesus coming for sure is to take a line
[1:01:55] here from Micah and then a line from
[1:01:58] Malachi a line from Isaiah but a line
[1:02:01] from Jeremiah a line from Hosea alive
[1:02:04] from Zechariah and a bunch of lines from
[1:02:07] Isaiah a man but line upon line upon
[1:02:10] line here a little day a little and
[1:02:12] pretty soon you've got the doctrine of
[1:02:14] God she has to do that for those a
[1:02:17] because he hides it from the eyes of the
[1:02:19] wise and prudent ha ha ha and he
[1:02:21] revealed and the birds such as will
[1:02:23] search the scripture and let me play
[1:02:26] this video I don't know if I got my
[1:02:27] volume up here I try to always turn it
[1:02:29] down in case I get a ping or something
[1:02:30] like that
[1:02:31] forgive me came and went there's
[1:02:42] numerous scriptures scatter all over the
[1:02:45] Old Testament and they were not all in
[1:02:47] one chapter the Bible nor were they in
[1:02:49] chronological order and so just like it
[1:02:52] wasn't the first coming be that way the
[1:02:53] second coming where the scriptures would
[1:02:55] be from all over the place and it won't
[1:02:57] be just a straight an order
[1:02:59] chronologically like a lot of now I'm
[1:03:01] gonna stop it right there look at that
[1:03:02] they're not in any order they're just
[1:03:05] all over the Bible it's not like God
[1:03:08] made it like okay well here's the first
[1:03:09] thing that's going to happen then the
[1:03:10] second thing then the next God's
[1:03:12] scattered all over and here Isaiah gets
[1:03:15] an
[1:03:15] by the Holy Spirit and he said if you
[1:03:17] want to learn from God you've gotta
[1:03:19] learn line upon line here a little there
[1:03:21] little you've got to search the whole
[1:03:23] Bible little nuggets from all over the
[1:03:25] place you put a bunch of little nuggets
[1:03:27] together you've got a bunch of gold
[1:03:29] nuggets amen
[1:03:30] but the nuggets are spread out all over
[1:03:33] and you gotta bring them to one place
[1:03:34] and I got something real valuable praise
[1:03:36] God see and if Jesus first coming was
[1:03:41] like that that's how the rapture is
[1:03:43] gonna be like as well because he's the
[1:03:45] same yesterday today and forever
[1:03:47] ha ha ha that's right so can everybody
[1:03:49] see that that's Isaiah 28 thank you I
[1:03:54] hope that was okay was that okay now
[1:03:56] verse 11 and 12 is when we're looking at
[1:03:59] with the 44 rest look at verse 11 12 and
[1:04:01] with stammering lips and another tongue
[1:04:03] will he speak to this people he's
[1:04:06] prophesied on the day of Pentecost to
[1:04:08] whom he said this is the rest wherewith
[1:04:12] he may cause the weary to rest
[1:04:15] Isaiah how are the Jews finding an
[1:04:18] arrest when they get the Holy Ghost so
[1:04:20] much that their lips are severs have
[1:04:22] stammered are they going to get rest are
[1:04:29] you finally gonna rest from sin get so
[1:04:31] full of God as you can that's what the
[1:04:43] Almighty God wanted to tell you this is
[1:04:45] how you rest
[1:04:46] not seeing how smart you can mean I
[1:04:49] guess how much spit you can keep from
[1:04:51] flying but they get so full of God that
[1:04:56] you only have any words say and so God
[1:04:58] has to give you another language Oh
[1:05:01] glory
[1:05:03] I've never spoke in tongues but I felt
[1:05:05] like many times I could have and I've
[1:05:07] asked God to help me so maybe one of
[1:05:08] these days I will but to me it don't
[1:05:11] matter because I know my lips have
[1:05:13] stammered like Hannah I prayed and I
[1:05:16] haven't been able to bring words I've
[1:05:18] just been we've been in cried rejoicing
[1:05:20] so I know I've had experiences like that
[1:05:22] amen
[1:05:23] so I know I've had it like that but it
[1:05:26] doesn't matter I mean once you have a
[1:05:27] great
[1:05:28] but now you got to live with that
[1:05:30] inoculation that you received let's live
[1:05:32] with that amen let's prove to everybody
[1:05:34] you got the right inoculation look at
[1:05:40] that that's and look at verse 12 this is
[1:05:42] what blew me away and last year I was
[1:05:43] reading the scripture to whom he said
[1:05:45] this is the rest like like there's no
[1:05:47] debate about what the rest is is it
[1:05:50] Saturday or is it getting so full so
[1:05:52] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:05:53] you can hardly form sentences which one
[1:05:58] is a church is it is it saturday or
[1:06:01] stammering stammering that is the rest
[1:06:06] that's when you're really rest from sin
[1:06:08] when you fall so unleavened God he fills
[1:06:10] you up you're gonna only talk and then
[1:06:12] you want to tell everybody about it
[1:06:13] won't you come down from that mountain
[1:06:16] that's exactly right
[1:06:19] don't you love God's Word oh thank you
[1:06:24] Jesus with stammering lips and another
[1:06:27] tongue will he speak to this people whom
[1:06:29] he said this is the rest wherever you
[1:06:31] may cause the weary to rest and this is
[1:06:33] the refreshing yet they would not hear
[1:06:34] so though the world Lord was under them
[1:06:36] precept upon precept line upon precept
[1:06:38] upon precept line upon line line upon
[1:06:40] line here a little there know that they
[1:06:42] might go and fall backward and be broken
[1:06:43] and snared and taken all right let's go
[1:06:47] to first Corinthians 14 now this is the
[1:06:51] chapter if you are Bible reader or you
[1:06:53] got good memory with the Bible this is
[1:06:55] the chapter on tongues how many know
[1:06:56] that you know about tongues really read
[1:07:00] first Corinthians 14 you know all about
[1:07:02] tongues 13 is all about love 12 is all
[1:07:05] about the gifts in general 14 is all
[1:07:08] about tongues and rightly so God used
[1:07:11] these stammering tongues to give
[1:07:13] everybody rest on the day of Pentecost
[1:07:15] God thought so much of this stammering
[1:07:18] blabbering experience booth who
[1:07:20] experienced God's Optimo so much of it
[1:07:22] he had to write a whole chapter on it in
[1:07:24] chapter 14 all right now verse 21 22
[1:07:31] actually let's
[1:07:34] let's go back to 18 I thank my god I
[1:07:36] speak tongues with tongues more than
[1:07:39] y'all
[1:07:39] yet in church says he yet into the
[1:07:41] church so he must have spoken tongues a
[1:07:44] lot in his prayer closet yet in the
[1:07:46] church I'd rather speak five words with
[1:07:48] my understanding that by my voice I
[1:07:50] might teach others also than ten
[1:07:51] thousand words in an unknown tongue
[1:07:54] brethren be not children understanding
[1:07:57] how be it malice be children but an
[1:07:59] understanding be men in the law it is
[1:08:02] written I look here it is with men of
[1:08:05] other tongues and other lips will I
[1:08:08] speak in this people and yet for all
[1:08:10] that they will not hear saith the Lord
[1:08:14] how many know that's quoting Isaiah 28
[1:08:17] if you look in your Scofield reference
[1:08:19] there and it quotes it right there it's
[1:08:20] letter e isaiah 28:11 and 12 paul is
[1:08:24] directly quoting he's talking about
[1:08:26] tongues and so he goes back as a 28 11
[1:08:29] and 12 he quotes that in order to prove
[1:08:32] that that was the rest that God's rest
[1:08:35] came was with stammering lips and
[1:08:37] another tongue
[1:08:39] glory verse 22 wherefore tongues are for
[1:08:43] a sign not to them that believe so see
[1:08:48] but to them that believe not but
[1:08:53] prophesying serveth not for them that
[1:08:55] believe not but for them which believe
[1:08:58] praise the Lord so it doesn't take
[1:09:02] to speak in unknown tongues to get me
[1:09:04] but to believe because I'm already a
[1:09:05] believer right but I want to see
[1:09:08] somebody speak in tongues whoever it is
[1:09:10] and then a prophecy right that's why we
[1:09:13] pray after somebody speaks in tongues
[1:09:14] right yeah because that is for me thanks
[1:09:18] God oh yeah I wouldn't know what that
[1:09:22] voice said because God might be talking
[1:09:24] to me and that's why I Church Dodd I've
[1:09:28] asked you many times I'm going to
[1:09:30] continue asking with all the love my
[1:09:31] heart we should come either you should
[1:09:33] pray it for half an hour before you come
[1:09:35] to church or come here and pray half an
[1:09:36] hour before church because that's how
[1:09:38] brother Branham said that's how you want
[1:09:39] to come if you want to see the gifts
[1:09:40] operate that's what he said over and
[1:09:43] over again over Oh from 58 all the way
[1:09:45] to 63 I can show you that if you want to
[1:09:47] see the power of God you've got to make
[1:09:49] a way for God praise the Lord you've got
[1:09:53] to do that like I was telling her the
[1:09:55] Amen on Sunday morning after that movie
[1:09:56] the Holy Ghost I said with Amen before
[1:09:59] service I was at the altar here for 30
[1:10:00] minutes and I prayed this I said Jesus
[1:10:03] when you came on Palm Sunday first the
[1:10:06] palms were laid and then you came in
[1:10:09] your glory and I said Lord I'm laying my
[1:10:11] palms right here and let the Lord come
[1:10:14] and glory in church he came hallelujah
[1:10:20] thank the Lord not prayed that many
[1:10:22] times before died maybe I don't feel
[1:10:23] like he came
[1:10:24] it is great glory what I'm saying is
[1:10:27] that there's some there's a way there's
[1:10:29] an approach to getting what we need from
[1:10:31] God and it's through prayer all right
[1:10:37] so that's why I've always preached that
[1:10:39] that's how I've always asked that that's
[1:10:40] why I continue to ask that that's why I
[1:10:42] continue to model it before the church
[1:10:43] that's the way we get in touch with God
[1:10:45] is by prayer and by sacrificing and
[1:10:48] preparing for the word to come that's
[1:10:52] right so can everybody see that forty
[1:10:57] years can be a good thing how many can
[1:10:58] see that and then the rest is a type
[1:11:01] that rests after getting the victory is
[1:11:03] a type when you get the victory you'll
[1:11:05] finally die out to yourself because my
[1:11:07] dad said when you surrender not fully
[1:11:09] he'll come in fully yes they met when
[1:11:13] you finally slay your will
[1:11:16] when you file like bourbon ever says
[1:11:18] that veil of self-will before the
[1:11:20] holiest of all when you finally tear
[1:11:22] that thing all the way and you say let
[1:11:25] to me for me to live is Christ to die it
[1:11:28] is my gain when you can finally rent
[1:11:31] that balance in my whole life is for
[1:11:33] Jesus Christ then you'll get in the
[1:11:34] prints of God you'll be born again ha ha
[1:11:39] ha that's right bleh
[1:11:41] now if you want to watch that like I
[1:11:43] said I can send you the link or you can
[1:11:45] just go on our our page there but that's
[1:11:48] that what I just taught there was on
[1:11:50] that video to try to show that they
[1:11:52] apply to Christians the only one that's
[1:11:54] different is the fourth commandment
[1:11:55] Saturday sabbath-keeping is not done
[1:11:58] away with but it has a new application
[1:12:00] now go to acts 20 verse 7 that just kind
[1:12:04] of came to my mind here and every
[1:12:08] Saturday Sabbath person I've had 4 or 5
[1:12:09] the last year that comes to me I go they
[1:12:11] say well that's not in the Bible
[1:12:12] worshiping on Sunday it's not in the
[1:12:14] Bible and I have to say well did you eat
[1:12:16] acts 20 verse 7 I don't say that
[1:12:18] arrogantly but with patience in my heart
[1:12:20] have you ever read acts 20 verse 7 this
[1:12:25] is when Paul preaches all night and
[1:12:28] eutychus was it fell out the window and
[1:12:31] God raised him up by the power of God
[1:12:33] and all night preaching that's a real a
[1:12:36] night preacher right now they could do
[1:12:39] that church because he wasn't going to
[1:12:40] be back right I missed the last time
[1:12:42] they may heard him preach so they'd say
[1:12:44] preach preach on we may do that sometime
[1:12:48] brother if you keep saying Amen like
[1:12:49] that we may do that some night hopefully
[1:12:51] snot on the work night but we'll see if
[1:12:54] we didn't preach all night we probably
[1:12:55] such anointing we could work the next
[1:12:56] day but you see they had such a burden
[1:13:01] for the word they could preach all night
[1:13:02] yes they could sit up and say praise the
[1:13:04] Lord Paul and member brother Graham said
[1:13:06] he was filled with the Holy Ghost but he
[1:13:08] was scholarly like remember he said that
[1:13:10] he said Peter was the firebrand he said
[1:13:13] Andrew was the pray lawyer and Paul was
[1:13:16] the scholarly one so Paul would come in
[1:13:18] there and he'd preach he say he get out
[1:13:20] as scrolls as they see this is where he
[1:13:22] said it right here in Isaiah right here
[1:13:24] look look it say okay now let me hold
[1:13:26] well on this one this is where he said I
[1:13:28] hear in Genesis look at this imagine
[1:13:29] you know cleave to his wife and this is
[1:13:32] a mystery about him speaking concerning
[1:13:33] Christ in the church you see God has all
[1:13:39] different kinds of gifts to meet all of
[1:13:41] the needs of the body everybody before I
[1:13:44] forget if you don't have one of my books
[1:13:46] and you want to pass them out I got a
[1:13:48] bunch out there on the shelf you can
[1:13:50] take them with you no cost it's just to
[1:13:53] get the word out and your pastors
[1:13:55] already read it he loved it so so it's
[1:13:57] okay and I just got word back today from
[1:14:00] Tim Pruitt Tim fruits read it and he
[1:14:01] wants to buy one for everybody in his
[1:14:03] church that was a real blessed that
[1:14:05] really blessed my heart so we'll see you
[1:14:07] know but those who are hungry and
[1:14:11] thirsty will be filled because it's
[1:14:13] God's Word it's not our word you and I
[1:14:15] have no good word except he gives us the
[1:14:17] word
[1:14:18] now look Moab was subdued that day under
[1:14:21] the hand of Israel and that land had
[1:14:22] rests how many fourscore that's 80 years
[1:14:27] so not 40 but a double portion 80 right
[1:14:33] like I told you our land has America's
[1:14:36] had rests for all these years where
[1:14:39] we've had rest I wonder why that rest
[1:14:41] came is because of real Christian
[1:14:43] soldiers that are willing to shed their
[1:14:45] blood for this type of lifestyle freedom
[1:14:48] freedom to worship worship however you
[1:14:51] want but Jesus Christ reigns amen
[1:14:54] not tyranny not dictatorship but freedom
[1:14:58] freedom of religion God's bless this
[1:15:00] nation more than any other nation that's
[1:15:02] why I'm proud to be an American in one
[1:15:04] way one way am i ashamed of her sins of
[1:15:07] course but I'm proud of her past and I
[1:15:10] want to live closer to God like those
[1:15:12] men amen
[1:15:13] now of course we know she and garbs
[1:15:15] after that now he who'd or a HUD was the
[1:15:18] deliverer up here so he lives such a
[1:15:20] godly life he lives such a victorious
[1:15:23] life before God God ended his muscle
[1:15:26] Authority I said I'm he said I'm giving
[1:15:28] you 80 80 years of rest because of your
[1:15:33] faithful service to God oh my our God is
[1:15:36] so loving is he not look at that church
[1:15:41] that's the Word of God that's the God
[1:15:43] word you know what God wants you and I
[1:15:46] to be he wants you and I to raise up and
[1:15:48] be delivers in our families deliver
[1:15:50] people from sin yeah witness to people
[1:15:53] pray for them save them God wants you
[1:15:55] and I to be delivers as well
[1:15:57] now I'm give me 15 more minutes I want
[1:15:59] to try to finish up here so I don't wear
[1:16:01] a canary tell have already preacher real
[1:16:03] hard tonight yeah it's just did I forget
[1:16:04] about haha so God gave me grace that the
[1:16:07] blood reach to the lowest Valley Amen so
[1:16:10] that all that enemies perish Oh Lord but
[1:16:13] let them that love him be as a son when
[1:16:15] he goeth forth and his mind oh that's
[1:16:17] how I want to be and the land had rest
[1:16:20] forty years this was after Deborah
[1:16:23] Deborah member Deborah got the anointing
[1:16:25] never got the prophesy and then she went
[1:16:27] and shared with barrack but did you
[1:16:29] notice in Hebrews 7 who did point out it
[1:16:31] point out barrack because he was the
[1:16:34] leader that day he's the one who had to
[1:16:37] decide is this spirit on his sister of
[1:16:39] this judge remember she's in politics
[1:16:41] she wasn't in the Levitical priesthood
[1:16:43] and that was a backs to the nation right
[1:16:46] right and so he had he's the one had to
[1:16:50] decide as this the Lord or not he said
[1:16:52] yes but then look Frasor he said I'm
[1:16:54] only going if you go with me but the
[1:17:00] Bible gives credit to barrack in Hebrews
[1:17:04] 11 because he's the Lord had to make the
[1:17:06] decision now is this a time and season
[1:17:09] I'm the leader of the hour is this the
[1:17:12] right anointing so he too went to God
[1:17:14] and he must God must have showed him
[1:17:16] this is the hour of victory and after he
[1:17:20] took that woman's jointing it and took
[1:17:22] her word of prophecy
[1:17:23] they had forty years of no slavery to
[1:17:26] any evil person Amen hallelujah
[1:17:30] imagine Aaron by the hose a they got to
[1:17:32] raise their children and they'd have to
[1:17:34] tell me well this is why we're in
[1:17:35] slavery because you know your dad is
[1:17:37] addicted to porn right that right they
[1:17:42] have to say well this is what you know
[1:17:43] we're slaves today because you know your
[1:17:45] grandpa was a murderer
[1:17:49] your grandmother was a gossiper and
[1:17:51] broke up family she's a prostitute
[1:17:53] that's why we're in slavery day wearing
[1:17:55] these chains know they could walk out
[1:17:57] for
[1:17:57] and say we're free the godly men obeyed
[1:18:00] the Word of God and now you're free
[1:18:03] enjoy the fruits of freedom because God
[1:18:05] has blessed all of our efforts to please
[1:18:07] a man
[1:18:11] one day I would tell my children all the
[1:18:14] testimony all my testimony the reason
[1:18:16] you guys are free the children the
[1:18:18] reason you have a good life the reason
[1:18:20] you're not being abused and hurt all
[1:18:22] these things is because God's grace has
[1:18:24] shined upon our family amen
[1:18:27] now Matt guys been in some houses right
[1:18:29] Malachi has been in some houses when
[1:18:31] I've done some witnessing and he's seen
[1:18:32] some pretty dirty houses right up there
[1:18:35] in Akron he's seen some houses that do
[1:18:38] not have the blessing of God on them are
[1:18:40] you worth you write Milka
[1:18:41] you've seen him drugs prostitution he's
[1:18:45] been in some places I didn't even know I
[1:18:46] was taking him there of course I would
[1:18:48] not have taken in their head and known
[1:18:49] it was going on evil and he's seen a
[1:18:53] cursed house how much more should we be
[1:18:56] grateful for the blessings of God upon
[1:18:58] our homes amen you ought to thank your
[1:19:01] mom and dad and grandpa
[1:19:02] whoever prayed for you you ought to
[1:19:04] thank them for praying for you I called
[1:19:06] my mom off last month I said thank you
[1:19:08] mom she said for what I said for praying
[1:19:10] for my wretched soul because now I see
[1:19:12] all the blessings of your prayers right
[1:19:14] upon my life what is it God honors those
[1:19:18] who honor him hallelujah Gideon had
[1:19:25] great victories and so God gave them
[1:19:29] quietness for 40 years in the days of
[1:19:33] Gideon 40 years me a good number of rest
[1:19:39] candidate you may struggle for 40 years
[1:19:42] you may struggle for 40 days the one
[1:19:43] that applies to us mostly will be 40
[1:19:45] days right for the race you hadn't
[1:19:47] you've had battles that lasts more this
[1:19:48] has been a hard month right all right
[1:19:50] when is April going to get over this has
[1:19:52] been an awful month
[1:19:53] I've had a few months like that lately a
[1:19:55] couple not goodness and I wonder if we
[1:19:59] go back and count
[1:20:00] I wonder if we'd see it maybe was 40
[1:20:02] days or so you know give or take a few
[1:20:05] because God allows tests in 40s
[1:20:11] wants to see how we're gonna respond but
[1:20:15] because of God's grace to Gideon had 40
[1:20:18] years of a quiet quiet life now did you
[1:20:25] know the Bible said this you know all
[1:20:27] the time Church I think I mentioned this
[1:20:29] a few times in the last years all the
[1:20:31] time you know we think well a book of
[1:20:32] Acts church has got to have all kinds of
[1:20:34] persecution and all kinds if we're
[1:20:36] really the true church will have
[1:20:37] miracles and and we'll have such
[1:20:38] persecution but look what Paul tells the
[1:20:41] Saints at that solonian I'm not saying
[1:20:43] we should have miracles we should have
[1:20:44] miracles but there's gonna be a time I
[1:20:47] believe and I think we've lived it I
[1:20:49] know I feel like I've lived it we're all
[1:20:51] I should have a peaceful quietness to
[1:20:54] them because of God's blessing upon our
[1:20:57] lives look what the Bible says as
[1:21:03] touching brotherly love you need not
[1:21:06] that I riding you for you yourselves are
[1:21:07] taught of God to love one another and
[1:21:09] indeed you do it toward all the brethren
[1:21:11] which are all Macedonia to see Macedonia
[1:21:14] was a local city we should have love to
[1:21:16] the Saints in Sheffield right
[1:21:19] we should have love to the Saints in
[1:21:21] Lorraine and I'm glad we do we have love
[1:21:24] you know you guys do - we should have
[1:21:26] love for any church that's local right
[1:21:29] any church we shouldn't have any
[1:21:30] bitterness against any message Church we
[1:21:32] should be filled with love toward them
[1:21:34] that if anyone that walked in here and
[1:21:37] disbelieved
[1:21:38] or disagrees what we said we can still
[1:21:40] shake their head and say God bless you
[1:21:41] may may Lord be with you sir and he said
[1:21:48] I beseech your brother that you increase
[1:21:49] more and more and that you study to be
[1:21:51] what study to be obnoxious and arrogant
[1:21:58] to be abusive on no social media and
[1:22:02] badger people study to be quiet and do
[1:22:09] your own business now this words quiet
[1:22:11] means to not be into other people's
[1:22:14] personal business let people's dirty
[1:22:19] laundry write people's problems that you
[1:22:23] don't want people to know about
[1:22:24] like my mistakes I don't want my
[1:22:26] mistakes hanging out in social media
[1:22:27] well brother Jesse made a mistake let's
[1:22:29] all bash him and that's all yeah
[1:22:31] ridicule him I don't want there that's
[1:22:35] why I don't even criticize politicians
[1:22:37] on social media I don't because I know
[1:22:40] there's a law that if I attack them God
[1:22:45] might allow me God might allow me to be
[1:22:47] attacked right so I'm very careful what
[1:22:50] I put on social media study be quiet do
[1:22:54] your own business and work with your own
[1:22:56] hands
[1:22:57] see you never have to tell Christian
[1:22:59] could you just get a job and stop having
[1:23:03] to rely upon brother so-and-so all the
[1:23:05] time right
[1:23:06] like we've had in this church for the
[1:23:08] last few years people that just want to
[1:23:10] sit around and do nothing
[1:23:12] and won't even go get a job when there's
[1:23:14] a where there's a restaurant right down
[1:23:16] the street they can go bus tables right
[1:23:20] you don't have to tell Christian to work
[1:23:22] because if there are son of Adam Adam
[1:23:25] was charged at work if you're a son or
[1:23:26] daughter of Adam and Eve you'll work to
[1:23:29] see as we command you that you may walk
[1:23:32] honestly toward them with it or without
[1:23:33] and that you may have lack of nothing so
[1:23:40] see this means not being in a gossip not
[1:23:43] not getting into people's business that
[1:23:45] you shouldn't be a part of now as a
[1:23:46] pastor I often have to get involved with
[1:23:48] people's business that's my job
[1:23:49] qualification but see I don't put your
[1:23:52] business out on social media do I
[1:23:54] Jose I've ever put any your troubles out
[1:23:56] on social media have you ever put any of
[1:23:59] my troubles out on social media brother
[1:24:00] Jose see why because we have brotherly
[1:24:02] love for each other cuz he knows I'm a
[1:24:04] man I make mistakes and I know he's a
[1:24:06] man he makes we all make mistakes see
[1:24:10] let nothing be done through strife or
[1:24:12] vainglory but in lowliness see we always
[1:24:14] see how little we are that each esteem
[1:24:17] other better than themselves look not
[1:24:23] every man on his own things now look
[1:24:25] we're supposed to look every man I'm
[1:24:28] thinking we should look at other people
[1:24:29] but not get into their business in the
[1:24:31] wrong way so we should try to help them
[1:24:34] out and constantly who can I help do you
[1:24:37] need food
[1:24:38] do you need help you need a new shirt
[1:24:41] you know do you need a new Bible you
[1:24:42] need a book you need a message whip you
[1:24:45] know write need a new computer right we
[1:24:49] should look to the help their needs but
[1:24:52] not get into their personal lives and
[1:24:54] try to gossip about it every understand
[1:24:57] and Paul says that's a quiet life that's
[1:25:01] the kind of quiet life he said you
[1:25:02] should study to be quiet
[1:25:08] and I appreciate that I know there's
[1:25:10] people in this church that have reached
[1:25:12] out to others and say can I help you
[1:25:13] with something
[1:25:14] do you need help with this do you need
[1:25:16] help with that and I appreciate that
[1:25:17] don't you but you because that's that's
[1:25:20] what we're fulfilling every man is
[1:25:22] supposed to look upon the needs of
[1:25:24] others that's a real Christian Church
[1:25:27] when we care and love each other so much
[1:25:30] here that we actually reach out and say
[1:25:32] can we help you with anything that's
[1:25:34] real Christianity because you don't look
[1:25:38] at your own self well I got everything I
[1:25:39] need who I can forget about everybody
[1:25:41] else now I can go watch Netflix or
[1:25:42] something like that you're gonna get
[1:25:44] caught in the Satan's Netflix that's for
[1:25:46] sure isn't that right yeah your God
[1:25:54] isn't that that's for sure yeah and with
[1:25:57] all the younger to speak in the younger
[1:25:59] widows learned to be idle wandering
[1:26:02] about from house to house see this is
[1:26:03] what he's talking about
[1:26:04] he says study to be quiet don't wander
[1:26:06] from a hospice and not only idle but
[1:26:09] tattlers also well did you know brother
[1:26:11] Jesse does this in his home he shouldn't
[1:26:13] do that he's a bastard and preacher you
[1:26:18] see I'm saying there busybodies tattlers
[1:26:21] you should have seen what Jose did the
[1:26:24] other week goodness after jerk he went
[1:26:27] out said someone do you even think he's
[1:26:30] got the Holy Ghost see Church we gotta
[1:26:34] be very careful what we say busybodies
[1:26:41] speaking things which they ought not to
[1:26:44] say all right let me
[1:26:48] I got five minutes let me close I'll try
[1:26:50] to finish this thought and Dave was
[1:26:52] thirty years old he beginner and he
[1:26:53] reigned 40 years Solomon reigned 40
[1:26:55] years see 40 can be a good number a man
[1:27:00] after God's own heart he reigned 40
[1:27:02] years glory joash remember he was a
[1:27:06] seven year old king right he reigned how
[1:27:09] long 40 years and he did that which was
[1:27:12] right in the side of the Lord in the
[1:27:15] seventh year jay who reigned 40 years
[1:27:17] reign he injures and I'm sorry Jay go
[1:27:20] ash Jihu ash he reign 40 years and Jihu
[1:27:24] ash Jehu ash did that which was right in
[1:27:26] the side Lord in all the ways all the
[1:27:28] days wearing Jahoda of the high priests
[1:27:30] instructed him but the high places were
[1:27:32] not taken away so he was kind of like
[1:27:33] did a pretty good job but not all the
[1:27:35] way now I want to close with this this
[1:27:38] is what I started on this one when I
[1:27:39] close with know some of these things are
[1:27:41] very familiar but I just want to close
[1:27:43] to this Jesus was seen 40 days the
[1:27:45] disciples before he sent it and led them
[1:27:47] captive now Church was this a hard time
[1:27:51] for the sciples or is this a glorious
[1:27:53] time so disciples glorious this was not
[1:27:57] a bad forward this is not like oh this
[1:27:59] is so awful seeing Jesus all over the
[1:28:01] place brother Ram said at any turn of
[1:28:05] the corner
[1:28:05] they were looking I can see Jesus over
[1:28:08] here every turn a quarter is Christ
[1:28:15] around here or under great expectation
[1:28:25] the Lord Jesus is alive Haven this was
[1:28:29] in 40 days of class or trials this is 40
[1:28:32] days of God proving that they can rest
[1:28:35] from the noise the crutch was not amen
[1:28:38] oh but he had a greater rest coming
[1:28:42] about ten days after that brother a ha
[1:28:44] ha ha the baptismal all the games amen
[1:28:47] which came the truth yes but he called
[1:28:50] that Pentecost he called that Jubilee a
[1:28:52] man with the stammering lips and another
[1:28:55] tongue eats big and give them rest in
[1:28:58] their souls
[1:29:02] for 40 days I'm gonna prove to you
[1:29:06] infallibly that Jesus Christ is alive
[1:29:12] now I'm gonna skip this program I'm
[1:29:14] talking about
[1:29:15] in every Church age he said Jesus was
[1:29:19] put out of the age and every Church age
[1:29:21] there was a messenger he spoke the word
[1:29:23] and then the people after that after he
[1:29:24] died they kicked him out wish I could
[1:29:27] hear about two or three weeks on Bible
[1:29:29] teaching or prophecy see where we were
[1:29:31] living friends what's the matter with
[1:29:32] people can't you see we're at the end
[1:29:34] time it's all over the next thing will
[1:29:35] be a sweep with that little group
[1:29:37] together in a month or so she'll be gone
[1:29:39] as soon as she's gathered together as
[1:29:44] soon as we're gathered under the ladder
[1:29:46] head in right because that's what's got
[1:29:48] to gather us together the Holy Spirit
[1:29:50] has to gather us together right a fresh
[1:29:54] anointing whether that's enough
[1:29:55] refilling the Holy Ghost for those who
[1:29:57] already got it and a fresh feeling for
[1:29:59] those who haven't got it yet
[1:30:00] hey man million he says about a month or
[1:30:04] so and Perry Green said this is where
[1:30:07] bo-ram he was talking to him afterwards
[1:30:09] you can hear on Peregrine's testimony
[1:30:10] out of any business church he said this
[1:30:12] Ribera said 'that's the 40 days he was
[1:30:14] later talking with him after the service
[1:30:15] this was in 1962 the next thing will be
[1:30:21] that little group gathering together
[1:30:24] well we're at the end there's no hopes
[1:30:26] of nowhere run to Christ people run to
[1:30:28] Christ that's what you did tonight run
[1:30:30] to Christ now you probably owe this one
[1:30:33] the greatest battle greatest news flash
[1:30:34] in history he says I'm mom
[1:30:40] those great outstanding glorious 40 days
[1:30:42] were they awful days but ma'am said
[1:30:44] glorious that our Lord was on earth
[1:30:50] appearing to disciples and others after
[1:30:52] his resurrection I have stood a many
[1:30:54] time and thought what if I could have
[1:30:56] been there you magic walking just
[1:30:59] walking and Jesus a walk out from behind
[1:31:03] a car something like for our day
[1:31:05] somebody just join you start walking
[1:31:07] with you hey what are you guys talking
[1:31:09] about oh you're talking about a rapture
[1:31:12] Oh tell me what do you know about the
[1:31:14] rapture
[1:31:14] oh you mean Christ is going to come back
[1:31:18] and there's a ladder rain and all these
[1:31:20] things tell me about that what other
[1:31:22] scriptures now hopefully this time we
[1:31:25] will he won't cause fools so to believe
[1:31:28] hopefully you'll say oh you faithful
[1:31:30] wise virgin a fool today men oh you know
[1:31:36] the scriptures and Here I am praise God
[1:31:38] a man you're getting ready for the
[1:31:41] rapture amen that I met I never thought
[1:31:44] about that that's how it should go
[1:31:46] we instead of being fool sorta believe
[1:31:49] we should be wise already believin
[1:31:52] that's fresh for you craz alone there
[1:31:56] that great expectation that how that
[1:31:58] every mend the road you might meet with
[1:32:00] him face to face that resurrected Lord
[1:32:05] Jesus what a thrill would have been to
[1:32:07] have met him and know that that was he
[1:32:11] every bend in the road on your drive
[1:32:15] home tonight every curve turning the
[1:32:18] corner and maybe there's a man standing
[1:32:20] there that could be Jesus then you turn
[1:32:23] another another one well maybe that
[1:32:25] man's Jesus he's about 5 foot 3 5 foot 2
[1:32:28] ugly looking guy you know he's not do
[1:32:30] handsome right ya know Beauty we desire
[1:32:32] not a real handsome man but that could
[1:32:35] be the Lord Jesus con
[1:32:40] between God and Satan look at this he
[1:32:42] said filming he said the spirit don't
[1:32:44] have flesh and bones got let he said
[1:32:46] like you got to eat so I've got
[1:32:48] something eat he had fish and bread and
[1:32:50] he was with them for days proving like
[1:32:52] Joshua that the land was there all the
[1:32:56] church can you believe that Taemin is
[1:32:58] your face strong enough for that is my
[1:33:00] faith that we start seeing the dead
[1:33:02] Saints Rick it will prove to us again
[1:33:06] because we already know by the Holy
[1:33:08] Spirit but it'll prove to us that that
[1:33:10] sixth dimension that seventh dimension
[1:33:12] is there it'll prove that that land
[1:33:19] exists he's the evidence of the land
[1:33:24] there Joshua and Caleb were evidence
[1:33:30] they'd been there and they came back
[1:33:31] when we say in the Dead come back it's
[1:33:34] evidence there is a land there it's
[1:33:37] proof I know the rapture is coming soon
[1:33:40] by the Jess I've seen them you know you
[1:33:43] might come to church maybe maybe Aaron
[1:33:44] sees them first brother Jesse the
[1:33:47] rapture is gonna be soon well that's
[1:33:49] great brother I believe that too maybe
[1:33:50] in the next year so no brother Jesse
[1:33:52] this I've seen I've seen my grandpa I've
[1:33:59] seen brother Branham it's gonna be very
[1:34:01] soon now you and I couldn't argue with
[1:34:04] that now he would not as much as happy
[1:34:07] as he is now think think about how happy
[1:34:09] he'd be if he saw brother Branham we
[1:34:12] know brother Aaron is a pretty happy guy
[1:34:13] pretty joyful guy comes a man and but
[1:34:18] think about how he act if he saw Saint
[1:34:21] Paul the great st. Paul or how about
[1:34:26] John the Divine the apostle of love I'm
[1:34:33] at
[1:34:33] one of us would act whoever saw of his
[1:34:35] where we walk in here a little
[1:34:37] differently to church right Aaron would
[1:34:41] walk in here to open the door he'd go
[1:34:43] around the corner of the prayer request
[1:34:45] table just thought maybe Mary would be
[1:34:50] there
[1:34:55] open the sanctuary door peek in there
[1:34:59] order for Andrew the prayer warriors up
[1:35:01] at the altar there right it would be
[1:35:07] such expectation he would have proof
[1:35:10] supernatural proof and he'd have nothing
[1:35:12] to pray he couldn't show it to us we'd
[1:35:14] have to see it on him and then his
[1:35:17] spirit would bear witness with our
[1:35:19] spirit yeah is that right that's why God
[1:35:25] give you the Holy Ghost so your Holy
[1:35:26] Ghost can give witness that somebody
[1:35:28] else has got the Holy Ghost amen
[1:35:31] proof that that land is their number ten
[1:35:37] quotes are first Corinthians I'm sorry
[1:35:39] 1st Thessalonians 4 about the rapture
[1:35:41] look at the order see God knows that we
[1:35:43] long to see our loved ones and if we got
[1:35:44] there to meet him first
[1:35:45] we've been looking around to see if
[1:35:47] mother dad and the rest one was there
[1:35:48] but see how the wisdom of the Holy
[1:35:49] Spirit they meet one another first and
[1:35:53] then we get there and sing amazing grace
[1:35:55] that's when they're going to be a time
[1:35:59] of worship you think I act funny now
[1:36:02] Church watch me up there do you think
[1:36:07] we're exiting now or crazy now or the
[1:36:09] night when we get to the heavenly sky
[1:36:12] what a good one I better get to the
[1:36:14] meeting in the air
[1:36:15] oh I think we'll just when we saw beyond
[1:36:18] ourselves but before that God wants to
[1:36:23] take out all the questions if this
[1:36:26] person made the rapture or that one he's
[1:36:28] gonna let us see all those that are
[1:36:30] going to be there so when we get up to
[1:36:32] the sky we're not looking like well
[1:36:34] there's Jesus but where is dad where's
[1:36:37] mom Tiberium said that's the reason
[1:36:40] we're going to see the resurrected ones
[1:36:42] first so we know who's already in it
[1:36:44] there's no wonder about a
[1:36:46] so then we all get the body change we'll
[1:36:49] only let the Jesus oh the wisdom of God
[1:36:54] praise the Lord and to think of us
[1:36:58] standing in modes we can die when the
[1:37:00] world won't know what's going on but all
[1:37:02] of a sudden you'll see up here before
[1:37:03] you your loved one that's gone on has
[1:37:07] come to unite with you again and we'll
[1:37:10] be changing a moment twinkling of an eye
[1:37:12] and be caught up together to meet our
[1:37:14] Lord in the air and the unite with him
[1:37:15] to be there forever and never to be out
[1:37:17] of his presence again if Jesus let the
[1:37:21] Old Testament Saints rise and be seen 40
[1:37:25] days for his first coming don't you
[1:37:27] think he'll do it on a second coming
[1:37:28] don't you think he's the same yesterday
[1:37:30] today and forever don't you think God
[1:37:33] wants us to have that same faith that
[1:37:36] they had that same expectation that same
[1:37:40] desire to have no worries about the
[1:37:42] rapture to have no question about the
[1:37:44] rapture because we'll be having
[1:37:46] supernatural experiences happening to us
[1:37:51] he said all that
[1:37:53] at that the trumpet sound you happen to
[1:37:55] stand look and well there's a brother
[1:37:57] and you know it ain't long in a few
[1:37:59] minutes we'll be changed in a moment
[1:38:00] wink of an eye and together with them be
[1:38:02] missing on earth and caught up to meet
[1:38:04] the Lord in the air oh thank you lord oh
[1:38:10] won't that be a time just walk along
[1:38:12] someday and here appears somebody who is
[1:38:15] it mother amen
[1:38:18] it ain't going to be long now just in a
[1:38:20] few minutes your changed now look
[1:38:24] brother branham starts naming people
[1:38:26] that died in the tabernacle here's
[1:38:28] brother sewer that old brother that used
[1:38:29] to be in the church here why there's
[1:38:31] brother de Ark he's that first black
[1:38:32] brother that brother man met at the
[1:38:34] Pentecostal meetings brother dark he
[1:38:38] stayed at his house that those verse
[1:38:39] meetings so why looky here they're all
[1:38:41] around me can you imagine not just one
[1:38:44] brother Ray but you're just surrounded
[1:38:46] by saints one two three four five six
[1:38:52] seven I imagine sevens completes it
[1:38:55] imagine you're surrounded by these
[1:38:57] before you ain't gonna be long now it's
[1:39:03] gonna be changed now just in a moment oh
[1:39:05] yes and the morning breaks eternal
[1:39:07] bright and fair let's send our feet and
[1:39:11] now if the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:39:12] those who are really loving is coming
[1:39:14] that's living for how many living for it
[1:39:17] you're not living for money you're not
[1:39:19] living for worldly pleasures or sexual
[1:39:22] pleasures or not living for drug
[1:39:23] pleasures you're living for Christ
[1:39:26] that's really living for when he appears
[1:39:29] in the sky the church that's dead in
[1:39:31] Christ sure eyes and those will be
[1:39:33] changed in a moment the rest of them
[1:39:34] will know nothing about it remember
[1:39:36] appear to those in the city see the
[1:39:38] rapture be like that we'll see each
[1:39:39] other we'll see them the rest of the
[1:39:41] world won't see them and it'd be caught
[1:39:45] away as a seeker going waiting for that
[1:39:47] time now I'm gonna stop right there I
[1:39:49] have up to 49 but I'm going to stop
[1:39:51] right there for time sake by God's grace
[1:39:54] how many love the Lord tonight oh let's
[1:39:56] just thank the Lord can we just thank
[1:39:57] the Lord thank you for your word Jesus
[1:39:59] thank you for your word Lord God how do
[1:40:01] you
[1:40:03] thank you lord praise the Lord if God
[1:40:10] was so certain to let the Saints know
[1:40:13] that this was rapture time at the bit at
[1:40:16] the first coming of Christ
[1:40:17] you know he'll do it for us as well
[1:40:20] he'll do it for us if he gave him
[1:40:23] fallible proofs of his resurrection
[1:40:24] after the first resurrection what about
[1:40:27] the second what about the rapture
[1:40:30] certainly God is rich in mercy Church
[1:40:34] and he put these in numbers and numbered
[1:40:37] it 40 so we know he gave us a number now
[1:40:44] think about I just thought about this
[1:40:45] think of all the church services you can
[1:40:46] have in 40 days let me pull this up here
[1:40:47] real quick let me pull my calendar 40
[1:40:51] days maybe seven seven or eight services
[1:41:01] can you imagine the anointing that would
[1:41:03] be in the church during those services
[1:41:04] the whole world would know nothing about
[1:41:06] it but we would be seeing people
[1:41:10] surrounding us that have died and gone
[1:41:11] on and they're not old and they don't
[1:41:13] have scholars on them they're 21 years
[1:41:15] old again I just saw my grandpa on
[1:41:22] Saturday night and now I'm coming to
[1:41:24] church Sunday morning what is your
[1:41:25] worship gonna look like when we sing
[1:41:32] hallelujah we shall rise and you just
[1:41:35] saw your bill Paul raised last night
[1:41:39] amen
[1:41:40] think about that and this is not a
[1:41:45] fairytale Church this is thus saith the
[1:41:47] Word of God forty days he did it
[1:41:52] I'm not saying this is the said the Lord
[1:41:54] program didn't say that that but I'm
[1:41:56] saying what he did for forty days was
[1:41:58] thus saith the Lord his first coming and
[1:42:00] he's likely he's as a pattern a God who
[1:42:03] works in patterns he's likely to do it
[1:42:05] again
[1:42:08] David ah
[1:42:10] what a glory it is how glorious it is to
[1:42:13] be alive in this day where we could be
[1:42:16] the ones all right the only group in
[1:42:22] history that will ever defeat death and
[1:42:25] bypass death as a whole group now
[1:42:28] [Music]
[1:42:30] individuals have done it but it's never
[1:42:32] been done by a group before we would be
[1:42:35] part of the first and only group the
[1:42:37] Bride of Christ his wife that would
[1:42:42] bypass death and not have to die and
[1:42:47] walk into a glorified eternal condition
[1:42:51] because of his grace in His mercy
[1:42:55] because we chose the walk in the light
[1:42:58] such a beautiful light oh let's just bow
[1:43:03] our heads for a moment and pray here
[1:43:05] tonight how many want to be a part of
[1:43:07] that special time if that don't you come
[1:43:09] let's raise our hands to god let's pray
[1:43:11] ask God to help us to be prepared for
[1:43:13] that time Emily father we love you
[1:43:16] tonight lord thank you for your word
[1:43:18] thank you for your prophet or your
[1:43:20] prophet seems to say this over and over
[1:43:22] again this forty not the forty of
[1:43:25] persecution but the forty of rest where
[1:43:30] Lord you'll give us forty days perhaps
[1:43:32] to rest in the fact that we know we'll
[1:43:36] be a part of the rapture you'll take all
[1:43:39] the questions out about well as this
[1:43:41] family member going to be there that
[1:43:42] Pastor dog is that family member is that
[1:43:46] friend from the church you're gonna take
[1:43:47] all the questions out so we won't be
[1:43:49] looking for them because we already have
[1:43:51] seen them amen Oh
[1:43:53] all's we'll be looking for is you Jesus
[1:43:57] amen god help us those who are desiring
[1:44:03] this law

[1:44:23] services Lord God for the King of glory
[1:44:25] to come down in each service Lord I know
[1:44:32] that each and every year that passes on
[1:44:35] each and every month but we can be more
[1:44:38] sure that we will be at the meeting in
[1:44:41] the air Lord God and we can have that
[1:44:46] rest that because we've entered into
[1:44:49] your spiritual rest the baptism of the
[1:44:52] Holy Ghost if anyone here is not born
[1:44:54] again Lord I pray in Jesus Christ's name
[1:44:56] they'll get serious about their walk
[1:44:59] with you and have a time of cleaning out
[1:45:03] their houses cleaning out their lives
[1:45:05] and seek your face that they might be
[1:45:08] mourned again and have this stammering
[1:45:11] lips experience everybody which I
[1:45:14] believe we saw on Sunday after first
[1:45:16] service Lord God I believe we saw
[1:45:18] someone standing there Lord God smiling
[1:45:21] and crying and shouting and screaming
[1:45:22] and praising God hallelujah I believe
[1:45:27] we've seen that Lord God and we're
[1:45:29] grateful but Lord all those in the

[1:46:08] where when he came to Christ Christ had
[1:46:10] no weak spots hallelujah because he knew
