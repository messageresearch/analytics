[1:46] today's got to meet House of Lords that
[1:49] well where our summers the prayer time I
[1:51] didn't get here early as I'd like to so
[1:53] I can pray a little bit
[1:54] there were some important needs I want
[1:56] you to keep it right here so Malachi if
[1:59] you could switch over Bank says this is
[2:01] HDMI three now there's a new connection
[2:07] let's see if this works okay I was
[2:10] reading up with this picture up here
[2:12] this is the little girl were praying for
[2:15] crews battle cancer three times
[2:20] you
[2:25] you
[2:32] great there'd be no more - absolutely I
[2:37] invited I would invite everybody to do
[2:40] some fasting on Saturday I think I'll
[2:42] fast probably two three meals if I can
[2:44] on Saturday just take that time then you
[2:50] know she's got all her hair back you
[2:52] know it used to be really long but that
[2:53] you know with each tumor with all the
[2:55] chemotherapy falls out she was pretty
[2:58] good
[3:00] now I got her little sister in my class
[3:03] this year also know some other ones up
[3:12] here so fasting for the other Saturday
[3:17] if you can you know I understand if you
[3:19] can't but it's a real good way to strip
[3:21] the Lord we're gonna talk about the car
[3:24] games down a little bit
[3:25] got to get it down one of the brothers
[3:28] their guests about the car games I
[3:33] mentioned on Sunday mixed up the car
[3:37] being so forgiving
[3:38] I guess solitaire is not a gambling game
[3:40] I don't know I thought it was that shows
[3:45] how much I know about cars I thought it
[3:49] was okay I never I never played it at
[3:53] all the game I thought it was gross
[3:57] pokers I know pokers again to me I know
[3:59] that much so the point I was making was
[4:04] that when people have poker games and
[4:09] cards right now it shows they have a
[4:12] spirit behind gambling is like lust
[4:15] covetousness is also pride you know I'm
[4:17] trying to take your money and it goes
[4:20] against all God's principles of patients
[4:22] with sowing and reaping right so your
[4:27] seed you work harder to job if you
[4:29] replay go see gambling is impatient
[4:37] selfish so I just wanted to see that the
[4:41] scriptures and some of the thoughts
[4:42] behind that I mixed up the gauge because
[4:45] I don't know any answer for you I would
[4:48] everybody know that I'm just so just
[4:51] having the deck of cards isn't evil it's
[4:53] what you do with the cards for example
[4:56] at my school we use decks of cards but
[4:58] we just use it to add and subtract
[5:01] there's no poker there's no Jack's on
[5:03] there there's no kings or queens but
[5:05] their cars about the game you know
[5:08] there's nothing evil on there it's just
[5:10] a carbine you know just a game
[5:13] when you start getting into gambling and
[5:15] taking people's money than really got
[5:17] some spirits so those are some good
[5:20] questions I appreciated the questions I
[5:22] just wanted to kind of clarify that and
[5:26] I'll say like this if you've got cards
[5:28] on your table you know at your house and
[5:31] that's the centerpiece of your house or
[5:33] like the Prophet said love story
[5:35] magazines romance novels there's
[5:37] definitely some problems you know in
[5:39] that house I would hope that they're not
[5:41] in our our homes my house grace dude
[5:43] we've heard it before I'm so I'm set
[5:45] yeah those of us who followed the
[5:46] message brother banner through the Bible
[5:50] I wouldn't expect those in our houses
[5:53] but just to clarify I just want to say
[5:55] that by God's grace so just let's pray
[5:59] for that one pray for all so I had a
[6:02] co-worker her dad passed away and she
[6:05] loves the Lord you know to whatever
[6:07] I think she's Baptist is Right Baptist
[6:10] and she said her mom's taking it really
[6:12] hard so let's pray for her mother then
[6:19] the other requests tonight and even
[6:28] [Music]
[6:40] any other purpose we have our operation

[8:56] little background on her she comes from
[8:57] churches that preach a lot of false
[8:59] doctrine
[9:00] around the message I can go out the last
[9:02] afraid a lot of emphasis on money riches
[9:08] things of the world over other false

[34:46] okay relations reverse rested all week
[35:03] with which sermon to preach in those
[35:04] regions are here this morning I just
[35:06] kind of fun a poll to go here so that
[35:09] means I didn't get enough time to put
[35:10] all the clothes I'll be on the screen so
[35:12] reading some of the book here
[35:21] messenger to the nation and the Prophet
[35:24] said a lot about that which we've heard
[35:25] I like to go just through some of these
[35:27] sources like Britannica and to make a
[35:31] pedia the Methodists website I'd like to
[35:35] look at their lives I think it could be
[35:37] a real inspiration you know Susanna
[35:39] Weston was a godly woman had 19 kids
[35:42] night above died in infancy so she had
[35:45] 10 kids and there was a couple of times
[35:48] she looked at her house got burned down
[35:49] twice her husband left her a cup for a
[35:53] couple years and he was even a preacher
[35:55] as she raised all those kids all tent by
[35:58] herself for come here so our sisters can
[36:01] gain a lot of strength I've spoken our
[36:02] brothers that sometimes your husbands
[36:05] and dads who represents an encouragement
[36:07] I think anybody whether it's male or
[36:09] female if we can pull inspiration from
[36:13] them praise the Lord like for example I
[36:15] pull inspiration from Mary write the
[36:17] Virgin Mary she kept that word and
[36:20] didn't doubt she should just said be
[36:21] done to me ignored and I work that's how
[36:23] I would it be I want to hear the word I
[36:26] don't say be done to me according then
[36:28] and hope you had a good week up this is
[36:31] the best we could prayer had in a long
[36:32] time sermon on sudden they really did
[36:34] something follow you by God's grace
[36:35] really touch my heart
[36:37] the unsearchable riches of Christ let's
[36:40] uh pick up I was here at revelation
[36:42] three seven they're really for us or for
[36:53] me this is the last church age
[36:55] I've already preached all the other six
[36:57] by God's grace so this is coming down to
[37:00] the last without reference to the
[37:02] development they ever seen just to kind
[37:04] of refresh a little bit but we're all
[37:06] grateful big of course with age living
[37:09] so let's look at revelation three seven
[37:11] we'll just read that verse because I
[37:13] don't imagine up all right let's read
[37:22] this together if we can on three one two
[37:24] three and to the Angel of the Church and
[37:27] know that right Lee said
[37:33] true yeah here they Charlotte and
[37:38] Charlotte as far as a word prayer but
[37:43] you know in your heart just lives it
[37:45] under God and God will see your parents
[37:48] requests
[37:49] how many father we love you tonight and
[37:51] thank you again for your mercy and grace
[37:52] you are also efficient Oh God you are as
[37:55] the scripture says here Lord amen
[38:00] you have the key of David what your
[38:02] prophet said was the Millennium and also
[38:05] the key to responsibility for it over
[38:07] your bride the church thank you that
[38:10] you've opened these things to us no man
[38:12] can shut the Word of God to us because
[38:14] it was you Jesus who opened this word to
[38:18] us we thank you for that tonight Lord we
[38:21] just pray to speak to us help us to all
[38:23] inspiration from the lives of this these
[38:26] two individuals here John Wesley and his
[38:29] mother Susannah Lord as we look to you
[38:32] Lord look to these truths Lorna I just
[38:34] pray don't speak to us or it surely has
[38:37] already this week is not listening twice
[38:39] I think to this church age the church
[38:43] age Bokan knowing that a man preached
[38:45] 800 sermons in one year is never went
[38:49] out I would be encouraged by that and
[38:52] ought to encourage gain strength to know
[38:54] that Lord you could you're with me just
[38:57] as you were with it and your promises
[38:59] are just as true so help us all Lord God
[39:02] - to focus in more than with this beard
[39:05] saying here tonight I'm just a man of
[39:07] nothing but orders we heard on Sunday
[39:09] Lord if we can approach every gift Lord
[39:12] with respected reference will be
[39:14] benefited not be in your house tonight
[39:16] help us now it was strengthened grace
[39:18] Jesus Christ II know reset it god bless
[39:22] you didn't see the Great Scott
[39:27] alright this look at this here I can
[39:30] switch over back to the HDMI three that
[39:33] turn off the notifications on that phone
[39:38] that's gimme so yeah I'm going back to
[39:41] see here here's our you know usual
[39:44] screen we've been working on we're all
[39:46] the Philadelphia Church age it was from
[39:48] 1715 and ended in round 19
[40:04] here's serving the law but actually I
[40:08] look at it he actually didn't start
[40:09] preaching under his message of two moves
[40:11] 35 so that was encouraging so I'm 36
[40:14] praise the Lord
[40:16] he's never 35 worked 88 preaching as
[40:20] much as it could so you know this shows
[40:23] there was more light in the Philadelphia
[40:26] age than the 30 artists artists n
[40:28] Thyatira because Jesus caught this aged
[40:31] motive dork so this was the greatest
[40:33] missionary age the Prophet talked about
[40:37] with more men going further around the
[40:39] world that had the better technology to
[40:41] do it and so this was the age of the
[40:43] open door which Jesus told that in
[40:46] chapter 3 verse 8 but we didn't read
[40:50] that many ways okay that's this could
[40:52] not so tight daughters are texts we
[40:54] never read all protectively just right
[40:56] here seven here's the prophets summer if
[40:58] you listen the thief in church age the
[41:03] Philadelphia church age was the age of
[41:04] brotherly love the Great Commission age
[41:07] and the great missionary age the open
[41:09] door first connected to the foundation
[41:16] and that means that were faithful in our
[41:19] in our day were connected to the
[41:21] Apostles because we preach the same word
[41:24] and then he says reveal the names of God
[41:29] was to be during this age when it went
[41:32] around 1906 so the name of Jesus Christ
[41:36] as the name of God became a revelation
[41:39] towards the end of this church age
[41:43] alright so there's a picture nothing
[41:45] else get past that because I think I
[41:46] just somebody's not doubled it away so
[41:50] here we are right here
[41:55] now a lot a lot more little well a
[41:57] little more like the Wesleyan that less
[41:59] light for our day this is the day we're
[42:01] living in you know the revival for our
[42:03] each so in 1906 glad it's still going on
[42:06] right here in Akron Ohio because Church
[42:08] the revivals didn't eat the revivals
[42:11] that needed praise God
[42:12] yeah that's right because our lives are
[42:14] revived and on fire for Jesus at last
[42:16] the world can't put out this fire
[42:19] he doesn't started from head and he may
[42:20] know keep going it's been going this
[42:22] mommy's gonna keep going by the grace of
[42:24] the Lord so we're so thankful you know
[42:26] all the lights you know some light that
[42:29] might in this date you know they had so
[42:30] much light back there at Paul's day but
[42:33] we're thankful for the light we have
[42:34] today now here we are again just another
[42:39] view this age was 156 years long so it
[42:45] was the shortest two three the fourth
[42:49] shortest Church age and again I'm just
[42:52] want to show this here's where we are
[42:54] where this church age the throne up with
[42:55] church age and so you see they're still
[42:58] battling you know Luke Wesley these days
[43:00] still battle this this black horse rider
[43:04] there's still persecution it still meant
[43:06] death in different places the Roman
[43:08] Catholic Church is still ruling a lot
[43:10] right during this time they had a lot of
[43:12] power so that's the that's the battle
[43:15] they were overcoming but one thing they
[43:18] didn't have was the Holy Ghost annoying
[43:19] to amen as a man the wisdom of a man
[43:22] we'd say to overcome the black horse
[43:24] rider and the great battle was the
[43:28] synagogue of Satan they were really
[43:30] battling the denominations the Roman
[43:34] Catholic Church system they're really
[43:35] battling that whereas you know Luther
[43:39] battle living a name but we're dead the
[43:41] lot of people say in the organization
[43:43] but they literally come out but then
[43:46] they battle that synagogue the great way
[43:51] okay the city of Philadelphia let's read
[43:54] a little bit on this there's a little
[43:56] bit on this it was 75 miles south of
[43:58] Sardis the second largest city in Lydia
[44:08] it had a coin a ting the coins that they
[44:11] used at the head of Bacchus on one side
[44:14] which was the same person as Nimrod from
[44:17] the book of Genesis and then the figure
[44:20] of a woman priestess the population had
[44:26] Jews Christians and heathens there was
[44:30] frequent earthquakes in the city but he
[44:32] had lasted the longest of all the seven
[44:34] churches of Revelation and is still
[44:37] alive this is so existing today at least
[44:39] one this was written called Alice seer
[44:44] Alice here the City of God now the coins
[44:49] represented this but the Prophet said
[44:51] when you flip a coin
[44:52] he said either way it was wrong one side
[44:54] was the Roman system the Nimrod system
[44:57] and the other side was woman worship so
[44:59] he said that's what they battle that's
[45:01] what the coin represented in those days
[45:03] either side you flip the coin you're
[45:05] gonna get false doctrine that's that
[45:08] wreck that was that's what that
[45:09] symbolized now let's look at the age
[45:12] here there's not much on that the age
[45:16] again as we said was from 1750 to 1906
[45:20] now here's the messenger of course we
[45:22] know John Wesley but we're gonna start
[45:24] with remember Martin Luther was the
[45:26] messenger to the Sardis age from 1520 to
[45:29] 1750 and here we have John Wesley's life
[45:32] so he was born at the end of the Sardis
[45:36] Church age and lived into the beginning
[45:38] of the Philadelphia churches and then of
[45:40] course we know William Branham was the
[45:41] messenger and that's where his life
[45:42] falls at the beginning of the church age
[45:45] all right someone leave that up there
[45:48] Malik I reckon up and she leave it up
[45:50] there now I'm going to look at the life
[45:51] of John Wesley how many ever studied on
[45:53] John Wesley's life what he studied on it
[45:56] all right okay there's supposed to be do
[45:58] have you read this chapter but okay
[46:01] praise the Lord so they'll have the
[46:03] background on that I'm sure but in Jose
[46:04] I have some background if anyone else is
[46:06] ready all right let's look a little bit
[46:09] of facts on John Wesley and as I read
[46:12] the Britannica it was strikingly
[46:15] familiar or almost sometimes exactly to
[46:19] the same words in the church age book so
[46:22] what
[46:22] for historical references the Prophet
[46:24] used with lavell they're extremely actor
[46:26] with the ones Britannica used so we
[46:29] found that to be interesting I'm going
[46:32] to go through John Wesley's life first
[46:33] then we'll end with Susan in the West
[46:35] it's okay you want to do it alright so
[46:40] I'm sorry John the messenger then we'll
[46:43] close with Susannah okay so John Wesley
[46:50] was born to Susannah and Samuel Wesley
[46:55] he was the second son and his dad was
[46:59] actually at the center of the Church of
[47:00] England he was a preacher
[47:03] so do you catch that his dad was like
[47:06] we'd say he was a religious you know
[47:09] person you know he left the false
[47:12] doctrine so see that was already kind of
[47:14] in his families they were familiar with
[47:17] that his dad knew what it was like to
[47:19] leave the church system and pretty soon
[47:21] John Leslie would leave the church
[47:23] system actually he get kicked out this
[47:27] is what happened so when he was when he
[47:32] was educated he went to Oxford
[47:33] University graduated four years later
[47:36] and became an ordained priest he was
[47:38] made a deacon a year later and then he
[47:42] started assisting his father at two
[47:45] different locations then got ordained
[47:48] I'm southern god ordained as a priest
[47:50] official priest in 1728 now while he was
[47:55] right after he got ordained it's pretty
[47:57] interesting he started a movement and
[47:59] they were called the Methodist and I
[48:03] just want to give you the background he
[48:04] wasn't even now what did his own
[48:06] testimony he wasn't even saved yet
[48:08] Church he had just gone through all the
[48:11] religious acts of the denomination that
[48:14] he was or the group that he was
[48:15] associated with okay he just gone
[48:18] through the act so he and his friends
[48:20] even his brother Charles were they were
[48:22] ministers they were all day long I went
[48:24] through school and everything and they
[48:26] started the group and they called them
[48:27] the Methodists I'm sorry the actual name
[48:29] was the holy club that was their name
[48:32] the holy club these are grown men they
[48:34] just graduated college
[48:35] Roman Holi club and here's what they did
[48:38] listen they did frequent communion
[48:40] services they keen union all the time
[48:42] they fasted two days a week doesn't that
[48:48] sound familiar the Pharisees I'm not
[48:50] saying they work I'm just saying like
[48:51] they were John Wesley wasn't saying yet
[48:54] and he thought this is how I'm gonna be
[48:56] say V thought well I'm saying I need to
[48:57] do this don't get me wrong we need to
[48:59] fast - we're gonna do that right but the
[49:02] point was you can be as religious as you
[49:05] want but you have to know Christ for
[49:06] yourself that's that's the bottom line
[49:11] now here's what they did next then they
[49:13] did they visited prisoners they talked
[49:16] prisoners to read as anybody ever done
[49:18] to a president visit any person I
[49:20] visited 2-butanol prison anybody else
[49:22] I've never taught him to read though he
[49:26] would sit there and teach prisoners to
[49:28] read the Bible imagine that they would
[49:32] pay the debts of the prisoners to get
[49:35] them out of jail and this is before he's
[49:38] even safe so he had a love for God -
[49:41] just not having a revelation then he
[49:47] would attempt to find jobs for them once
[49:49] they got out of jail so he had like a
[49:51] prison ministry like he'd said today
[49:53] that's John Wesley oh they actually more
[49:58] they had they had work houses for poor
[50:01] people they distributed food to the poor
[50:04] close to the for medicine and books
[50:07] while also running this school so John
[50:10] Wesley with August his brother Charles
[50:12] and all these other men did all this
[50:14] they have a school they have a close
[50:17] ministry food ministry prison ministry
[50:18] teaching ministry and this is all
[50:21] without being saved so does that help
[50:22] today people go to church today and not
[50:24] even be saved and just do good religious
[50:28] things right this is what John Wesley's
[50:31] testimony is this is history
[50:35] now look at this in 1735 so the column
[50:39] to this church moved last seven years
[50:42] 1735 John and Charles left and then the
[50:45] group just disintegrated
[50:47] so that shows that every ministry
[50:49] there's Oh
[50:49] there's always just a couple people who
[50:51] are in the real backbone right you
[50:53] probably seen it I give a pass to leave
[50:54] the church there's a church stay
[50:56] together they disband
[50:58] that shows you how many leaders there
[51:00] are if they stay together it shows they
[51:02] got some real good leadership and you
[51:04] know they're there for more than just to
[51:07] be see right you really believe there's
[51:09] a work for God like I don't know
[51:10] recently a couple churches where the
[51:12] pastor left but the people just stayed
[51:13] together they just stayed together
[51:15] waited on the Lord God sent her pastor
[51:18] talking about some of you his dad died
[51:23] in 1735 so that's maybe why they stopped
[51:25] those the holy club but then he was
[51:29] persuaded to go on a missionary trip to
[51:32] North America do you know that he
[51:34] traveled from England in North America
[51:35] and he he was trying to help out the
[51:41] Moravian immigrants immigrant I'm not
[51:45] sure what their background is like I
[51:47] start about did they call them Indians
[51:50] maybe Native Americans so Wesley went
[51:53] over there to minister to them and they
[51:54] failed they didn't it didn't make any
[51:56] converts but Wesley was so he was so
[52:02] moved by their dedication he came back
[52:05] to England this is his famous quote the
[52:07] Prophet accorded force here he said I
[52:11] went to America to convert the Indians
[52:12] but Oh who shall convert me so he went
[52:18] there to try to convert them and he saw
[52:20] how meek they were how much peace they
[52:23] had how much courage they had in
[52:25] difficult circumstances mr. Courtney
[52:27] history and he comes back he's already a
[52:29] priest and he comes back and says he was
[52:31] going to convert me I went to go make
[52:33] the converts and I need to learn all
[52:36] right let's see let's see what's next
[52:38] year back in London and he again met
[52:44] these same people of Moravia and then it
[52:48] was a man named Peter bowler who showed
[52:50] him the way to salvation and he was
[52:53] truly born again as a preacher Harvey he
[52:59] was born again as a preacher right
[53:00] Martin Luther's words about Jessica
[53:03] so this is beautiful he's not even safe
[53:06] he's living here in London somebody's
[53:08] reading the previous Church age
[53:09] messengers teachings and the next
[53:12] messenger gets same day man that's
[53:15] beautiful right there hallelujah
[53:18] he wasn't even saved and then he reads
[53:21] Martin Luther's ideas on justification
[53:23] then he gets justified that's beautiful
[53:27] he said from this point forward at the
[53:29] age of 35
[53:31] Wesley viewed his mission in life as one
[53:33] proclaiming the good news of salvation
[53:35] by faith so see he was trying to earn
[53:38] salvation by works and he constantly
[53:41] fell far from God and we have to be
[53:45] careful that too that we are not trying
[53:47] to earn God's favor that might do more
[53:49] works but we're doing it because we love
[53:50] God or another reason we're doing it
[53:53] because we're trying to crucify this
[53:54] flesh we're trying to get out of the
[53:57] flesh and we're trying to get into the
[53:58] spirit yes do you want God's favor but
[54:01] we're not trying to work our way to be
[54:02] saved
[54:03] we know we're saved we realize we got to
[54:05] bring this body under subjection seized
[54:08] that's why that's why I think we need to
[54:10] fast like I'm saying not not because it
[54:13] will save us it does it we're already
[54:15] sitting but because it gets us thinking
[54:17] away from natural things onto
[54:19] supernatural things
[54:20] hallelujah amen praise God
[54:25] there you go and that's what I was asked
[54:29] today so they asked me what are you fast
[54:30] and I said well it's an Isaiah 56 you
[54:34] fast because the Bible said it breaks
[54:36] chains with officers it restores your
[54:39] health says it gives you strength and
[54:42] power in Isaiah 56 that's what happened
[54:45] you get so you just so filled with the
[54:47] things of God that you'd become stronger
[54:48] spiritually got the mind of Christ walk
[54:51] into the anointing you're more aware of
[54:54] spiritual things instead of oh what am I
[54:56] going to eat next what am I going to do
[54:58] for something I might do for practice
[55:00] yeah Wesley preached whenever a pulpit
[55:06] was offered to him but soon the
[55:09] congregation's closed their doors
[55:11] because of his enthusiasm before get
[55:15] every door open
[55:16] because he was just a regular
[55:17] denominational preacher but after he got
[55:19] saved and do it's not by works it's by
[55:21] grace and he started preaching that
[55:24] enthusiastic gospel everybody shut their
[55:27] doors that's true
[55:31] so next says he started traveling and
[55:37] going out into fields and preaching to
[55:40] large groups kinda like Christ him and
[55:43] he would preach the multitude it became
[55:45] that type of ministry and he was said to
[55:48] be one of the founders of the circuit
[55:50] writer preacher movement where you'd
[55:53] have a preacher who would ride his horse
[55:54] from town to town and he would just go
[55:56] in a circle he'd get back home rest a
[55:59] while and then he go back again alright
[56:01] and so looked like we what we would call
[56:02] evangelist today that's what we would
[56:05] call today
[56:05] I think Samuel is the first ones the
[56:08] Bible that I could see because the Bible
[56:10] said he went over all Israel t-top all
[56:12] Israel he went from each tribe and tall
[56:15] the children of Israel
[56:18] now next next he did it now this is
[56:25] interesting he did it develop religious
[56:28] clubs again but there was no
[56:31] organizational connection there was no
[56:33] connection any church it was just
[56:35] brothers who were banded together in
[56:37] Christ to live a holy life that's what
[56:40] this says here they were they all had to
[56:45] be the same sex that ought to be boys
[56:46] I'm sorry boys ought to be married men
[56:49] and they ought to sit having the same
[56:50] marital status so you couldn't be in one
[56:52] of these groups
[56:53] if one guys single another married you
[56:55] could they couldn't be the same groups
[56:56] they had to be in separate groups and
[56:57] that makes sense right
[56:59] because they if you're single you have
[57:01] the same battles this other single men
[57:03] and you can gain strength from other
[57:06] people that are in your same situation
[57:07] whereas if you're married you have
[57:09] different struggles when you're married
[57:11] and then you want to be a part of brews
[57:13] with married men right they can
[57:15] encourage you they can strengthen you oh
[57:17] I know God help me overcome this you can
[57:19] overcome this to take curved you know
[57:21] things like that and then it says next
[57:25] that
[57:29] he went to the unchurched masses and had
[57:34] many converts and societies they
[57:37] continue to develop and spiritual growth
[57:39] let me read now the moral of the
[57:41] prophets it he said John would come and
[57:48] preach in the fields where thousands
[57:50] would listen to the Word of God he saw
[57:55] the throgs and saw the working of the
[57:58] gospel on the part of the Spirit he
[58:00] turned a whole heartedly to open-air
[58:03] preaching now he says this year next I
[58:09] want to skip a little bit down here he
[58:13] said so powerful was John's preaching he
[58:16] said that people would have fall to the
[58:17] ground crime in great distress over
[58:20] their cities that's how powerful was
[58:23] I've been in a few meetings where that's
[58:24] happened I preached and people were all
[58:26] down and prayed for them and they fall
[58:29] down I had that a few times but this was
[58:31] a common theme in his life his ministry
[58:35] people so be addicted by the Holy Spirit
[58:40] now did you know he said this he said he
[58:43] never felt low in the spirit for even 15
[58:46] minutes his whole life can you imagine
[58:49] think about how many times you feel
[58:51] discouraged or depressed and sometimes
[58:54] will go for a half hour hour maybe day
[58:57] we so people get hit
[58:59] yeah you might have a different battle
[59:01] right I have a hard battle he said he
[59:04] didn't remember struggling for 15
[59:05] minutes praise God he was a man who was
[59:10] a star of God right never and the stars
[59:13] in Christ's hands he had to be a star
[59:16] for Jesus Christ did we miss he slept no
[59:21] more than six hours a day he rose and
[59:26] time to start preaching at 5 a.m.
[59:28] practically every day and preached
[59:31] sometimes up to four times a day in a
[59:34] year he would average over 800 sir 800
[59:38] sermons remember this was the ancient
[59:40] open door people receiving everywhere
[59:42] people would receive the gospel imagine
[59:44] having baptisms every day and new
[59:46] believers every day that's what it was
[59:47] like for this man God opened great doors
[59:50] for he travels 4,500 miles every year by
[59:55] a horse so wonder how many horses he
[59:57] went through as time went along he
[1:00:04] formed groups of men called United
[1:00:06] societies and they had a strict set of
[1:00:09] rules to be self-disciplined for the
[1:00:12] good of their souls but he said Wesley
[1:00:18] recognized after his death the movement
[1:00:20] could be organized and the Spirit of God
[1:00:22] would leave them to a dead floor did you
[1:00:27] know Wesley have a favorite saying on
[1:00:29] money you know what his favorite abstain
[1:00:30] was on money as you remember that he
[1:00:32] said get all of the money you can then
[1:00:36] he said save all the money you can and
[1:00:39] then he said give all the money you can
[1:00:42] I like that yet all you can save all you
[1:00:47] can get now what does Jesus love a
[1:00:51] cheerful Giver see most Americans stop
[1:00:55] it get all you can it most don't even
[1:00:58] save and then most don't even give they
[1:01:01] don't even give 10% or you know they
[1:01:03] don't even give but that was that to get
[1:01:05] as much as you can but then save as much
[1:01:06] but then give as much as well all right
[1:01:20] okay I think I'm stop right there he
[1:01:26] looked to news 88 the Prophet said he
[1:01:28] died 288 having served God as few men
[1:01:31] would dare to even think they might
[1:01:34] serve God praise the Lord let me see
[1:01:41] there's anything else I'm here when the
[1:01:42] city never you understand his life a
[1:01:48] little bit
[1:01:49] he started off being raised in church
[1:01:50] you know raised a daddy was a preacher
[1:01:52] all these things he just got he was just
[1:01:54] going through the motions he knew
[1:01:55] the right thing to do but he never
[1:01:57] really had a real connection in his life
[1:01:59] to Christ I'm so glad that's how I was
[1:02:02] you know I was raised in the church but
[1:02:03] I never felt like I was one of them
[1:02:06] I always knew I was still a sinner I
[1:02:08] always do that until I finally repented
[1:02:11] gave my heart to Christ and then I could
[1:02:14] then I could sing for myself then I
[1:02:16] could praise God for myself
[1:02:18] I could raise my hands for myself so I
[1:02:21] can relate a lot to John West and I
[1:02:22] think all of us here can do that tonight
[1:02:25] as well there was a time when we tried
[1:02:27] to be a church member but there's a time
[1:02:28] when we became a Christian and now we do
[1:02:32] it from our souls we do it from our
[1:02:33] hearts okay praise the Lord all right
[1:02:38] let's see them I mean give me about a
[1:02:40] half hour and we'll try to finish my
[1:02:41] primer finished in less than that this
[1:02:43] might be another short nap but pretty
[1:02:45] simple in you know let's look at Susanna
[1:02:48] West a little bit now before I read that
[1:02:51] Susanna Wesley had to the most famous
[1:02:55] children during this time John which we
[1:02:58] went through and then Charles Charles
[1:03:02] wrote six more than 6,000 sins 6,000 I
[1:03:08] never wrote one song he's wrote a
[1:03:11] seizure over 6,000 songs
[1:03:14] now the reason I do these children -
[1:03:17] while it's good that we did these
[1:03:19] children first it's nice to see them to
[1:03:21] look at what kind of mother did they
[1:03:23] have what kind of mother would produce
[1:03:26] children like this that would preach 800
[1:03:29] times in one year
[1:03:31] what kind of mother would it take to
[1:03:33] produce something a child that would
[1:03:35] write six thousand songs so I want to go
[1:03:47] through this a little bit yeah there's
[1:03:55] anything else I want to say about -
[1:03:57] Charles Lester I didn't get a whole lot
[1:03:59] of information here okay all right so
[1:04:02] your Susanna's life
[1:04:07] okay she's into Wesley she was the
[1:04:13] daughter of Samuel and Mary white and
[1:04:18] here's her personal life she was the
[1:04:20] 25th of 25 children
[1:04:23] her parents had 25 kids she was number
[1:04:28] 25 her dad also descended from the
[1:04:34] established Church of England Nexus II
[1:04:37] it was in John's it was in John's blood
[1:04:39] John's grandpa came out of the church
[1:04:43] and then John's dad came out of that
[1:04:45] church they were constantly leaving the
[1:04:48] established system to clean the truth
[1:04:52] glory at the age of 13 she stopped
[1:04:56] attending her father's Church oh and
[1:04:58] then she joined the official Church of
[1:04:59] England which I don't know that's a good
[1:05:01] thing or not I'm not sure they did
[1:05:03] enough reading on that okay she was
[1:05:10] married at 19 years old then she got
[1:05:12] married okay so that was her age at
[1:05:15] marriage she had 19 children nine of the
[1:05:18] children died his infants for the
[1:05:21] children who died were twins so she had
[1:05:23] two sets of twins that died then her
[1:05:27] maid accidentally smothered one of her
[1:05:30] children and that child died here's one
[1:05:34] little little little-known thing about
[1:05:36] Susanna Wesley
[1:05:37] brother Branham said she found at least
[1:05:39] an hour to pray every day and you know
[1:05:43] sometimes we think how in the world but
[1:05:45] church she had it made because the maid
[1:05:48] smothered her job she had can you
[1:05:50] imagine sisters having amazing job
[1:05:52] I can't yeah he imagined so you know Wow
[1:05:58] while she was a godly woman Wow you know
[1:06:01] brother Graham uses her as I always used
[1:06:03] to her a nice collie example we have to
[1:06:05] remember that she had a maid to take
[1:06:07] care of the children the ten children
[1:06:08] well she could have some time to pray
[1:06:11] just keep that in mind that's just for
[1:06:16] testing them there so yeah mate
[1:06:20] whatever children was one of the nine
[1:06:22] that passed away at her death only eight
[1:06:28] of her children were still lives than
[1:06:29] she outlived I'm sorry the tumors of her
[1:06:32] died before she died
[1:06:34] it's only a tit when were alive when she
[1:06:36] passed away okay no Susanna Wesley is
[1:06:43] known as the mother of Method Methodism
[1:06:47] in other words they say they really
[1:06:50] attribute all of John Wesley's efforts
[1:06:53] to his mother which there's some truth
[1:06:55] behind that like right like Timothy what
[1:06:58] did Paul say basta I saw the faith of
[1:07:00] your mother your mother ain't
[1:07:01] grandmother Lois and Timothy remember
[1:07:03] that from Scripture that member what
[1:07:06] made Moses such a godly man is his mouth
[1:07:08] jakka bed right jack Abed was such a
[1:07:11] wonderful trainer and teacher of Moses
[1:07:14] of course prayer warrior we know that
[1:07:17] too because the Bible says she didn't
[1:07:20] fear the threat of the king
[1:07:22] she took Moses down there and just knew
[1:07:24] God revealed to her he's going to be all
[1:07:27] right
[1:07:27] and God delivered on his promise amen so
[1:07:34] let's learn a little bit more about her
[1:07:36] life here
[1:07:37] Suzanne experienced many hardships
[1:07:39] throughout her life her husband left her
[1:07:43] and the children for over a year one
[1:07:44] time because of a minor dispute here's
[1:07:48] what was written in her letter while her
[1:07:51] husband had left her she said I have a
[1:07:55] woman but I've also the mistress of a
[1:07:56] large family and though the superior
[1:08:00] charge of the souls contained in it lies
[1:08:03] upon you
[1:08:04] I think she's writing your husband yet
[1:08:06] in your long absence I cannot my look
[1:08:07] upon every song you leave under my
[1:08:10] charge as a tailor committed to me under
[1:08:13] trust praise God you see that she
[1:08:17] considered every child was a talent
[1:08:19] given under her remember Jesus said some
[1:08:21] people have one Talent three talents
[1:08:23] five counts she said I've got ten
[1:08:25] talents in other words wow what a way to
[1:08:30] look at your children remember a talent
[1:08:32] I forgot how many thousand dollars of
[1:08:33] talent was
[1:08:34] in those days it was a tremendous amount
[1:08:35] of money she said each one of my
[1:08:38] children is a talent look what she says
[1:08:45] her husband left her so she says I am
[1:08:48] NOT a man nor a minister yet as a mother
[1:08:50] to mistress I feel I ought to do more
[1:08:53] than I had yet done now listen I
[1:08:57] resolved to begin with my own children
[1:08:59] that's a good way that's a good lesson
[1:09:01] all parents to live work and learn here
[1:09:03] tonight in which I observe the following
[1:09:08] method so she uses the word method and
[1:09:10] it produce Methodists okay so that means
[1:09:14] she just she had good habits that's what
[1:09:16] a method is a habit right he grabs this
[1:09:20] is something that my wife and I could
[1:09:21] talk about here it's not tuning it over
[1:09:23] so this is Miss Lydia meows miss I
[1:09:27] observed the following method I take a
[1:09:29] proportion of time as I can spare every
[1:09:32] night to talk or discourse with each
[1:09:35] child individually so she have ten kids
[1:09:39] I don't know there's not ten days during
[1:09:44] the weeks I'm not sure how she did that
[1:09:47] so she said on Monday I talked with
[1:09:49] Molly on Tuesday with Hedy Wednesday
[1:09:52] Nancy Thursday Jackie Friday patty
[1:09:55] Saturday with Charles so before the day
[1:09:59] would end she would call one at one side
[1:10:01] at a time and just talk with them now
[1:10:04] the industry says she didn't ignore them
[1:10:05] the rest of the week right parents can't
[1:10:08] ignore your children rusty but she just
[1:10:10] made sure she took some one-on-one time
[1:10:12] with each child throughout the week now
[1:10:14] isn't that a good lesson church honey
[1:10:16] was your parents would've done that I
[1:10:17] wish my parents would did that they
[1:10:20] never pulled me aside really to talk to
[1:10:21] me to say Jesse how are you doing are
[1:10:23] you serving the Lord any questions about
[1:10:25] the Bible what do you think you wouldn't
[1:10:28] be when you grow up my parents never did
[1:10:30] that they never said what do you think
[1:10:33] you would do with your life you know
[1:10:34] what do you think you wouldn't do they
[1:10:36] would lecture me you know her down a
[1:10:37] time but she pulled each one aside she
[1:10:40] said if my husband's not gonna be here I
[1:10:42] am gonna invest in each one of my
[1:10:44] children
[1:10:44] isn't that God is that a wonderful thing
[1:10:47] to do
[1:10:47] I thought you'd like that now her
[1:10:52] husband member and left her this is
[1:10:53] John's dad and John's dad Samuel spent
[1:10:58] time in jail twice due to his poor
[1:11:00] financial abilities so he got them dead
[1:11:03] remember those days if you got a debt
[1:11:05] too far and could pay her debts
[1:11:10] the lack of money was a continual
[1:11:12] struggle for Susannah missing church
[1:11:17] their home was burned down twice just by
[1:11:20] fire I don't know how it happened but
[1:11:22] burned down twice imagine your house
[1:11:28] being lost twice during one of the fires
[1:11:30] her son John Wesley nearly died and had
[1:11:34] to be rescued from the second-story
[1:11:35] window praise God
[1:11:37] amen look his say he trying to kill that
[1:11:39] all that star god oh are you a star got
[1:11:45] it younger than the young boy there
[1:11:46] someone came in to rescue God's God star
[1:11:49] oh that's beautiful
[1:11:52] praise God amen
[1:11:57] and she was the primary source of her
[1:12:01] child's education how many believe in a
[1:12:02] home school they don't believe in home
[1:12:05] school I'm a public school teacher I
[1:12:07] believe in public schooling as long as
[1:12:09] you got Christian teachers are good good
[1:12:13] people that don't teach evil things that
[1:12:17] was a product of public school you know
[1:12:18] my wife was a product of screws oh yeah
[1:12:20] good godly teachers there's nothing
[1:12:22] wrong with that
[1:12:22] brother man I made this quote he said
[1:12:25] and I can show to you on it he said my
[1:12:27] to Turner over at the high school he
[1:12:30] said I wish they were up in an Indian
[1:12:32] Reservation he said but it doesn't
[1:12:33] really matter where they were he says
[1:12:35] because whatever seeds inside of them
[1:12:37] it's going to come out so there's a
[1:12:41] quote where some people say oh no you
[1:12:43] can't send your kids to school brother
[1:12:44] Graham says it really doesn't matter I
[1:12:45] mean you have to you have to follow the
[1:12:47] leading of the Lord
[1:12:48] but whatever the leading the Lord will
[1:12:51] be will be righted it might be the
[1:12:53] public school or might be to home-school
[1:12:56] was I talking was it uh was it New York
[1:13:01] I was talking with somebody recently
[1:13:03] about their children okay
[1:13:08] and whatever the case was one of their
[1:13:13] children it was a little girl I think
[1:13:14] she was like a fourth grade and she
[1:13:18] believed the message and she only wore
[1:13:19] skirts and almost New York yeah I was
[1:13:23] when I was out there New York this
[1:13:24] happened in New York right in the Bronx
[1:13:27] that's right okay now so she's in the
[1:13:32] Bronx and this was a very liberal area
[1:13:34] right
[1:13:34] it's very liberal people dress crazy you
[1:13:37] know big city her daughter has long hair
[1:13:40] braids long skirts the guidance
[1:13:45] counselor pulled her in a room without
[1:13:46] Sun her parents and questioned her and
[1:13:48] said why he wears skirts your parents
[1:13:51] making wear skirts
[1:13:52] why don't you cut your hair she said she
[1:13:55] said don't you know you can cut your
[1:13:56] hair and you'll have you can wear pants
[1:13:57] and shorts like the other kids and she's
[1:13:58] like I don't want to I want to serve God
[1:14:01] and when the mother found out she was
[1:14:03] furious which I would be too and when it
[1:14:08] had a meeting and then the guidance
[1:14:09] counselor did it again and so that time
[1:14:13] the pastor went in and I know the pastor
[1:14:16] sent another preacher in and lay down
[1:14:19] lay down the law had I think they
[1:14:21] brought a lawyer with them one of those
[1:14:24] Christian lawyers and after that it
[1:14:26] stopped but then still the next year
[1:14:29] they took her out the whole square
[1:14:30] because they didn't take any chances
[1:14:32] which I thought was wisdom I know that
[1:14:35] was a good but like in our school no one
[1:14:37] ever does that you know it's just a good
[1:14:39] like tomorrow or next month we'll see
[1:14:41] God will see god Bless America with five
[1:14:44] hundred kids in the gym next month we'll
[1:14:47] see god bless the USA so our our
[1:14:50] district is very open for religious
[1:14:51] things so that's why I took an idea for
[1:14:54] me to work there if I saw some wrongs
[1:14:56] and I look for a new job somewhere else
[1:14:58] but anyway there's something considered
[1:15:01] you know God's will is not always up on
[1:15:03] the Indian Reservation brother Graham
[1:15:05] says you know you got to find that's we
[1:15:07] need to pray and ask God to show you
[1:15:09] where your
[1:15:10] we need to go okay so anyways Susanna
[1:15:14] Wesley was a good homemakers he's a good
[1:15:17] home school bus with ten kids plus a
[1:15:20] mate
[1:15:21] plus I made one time
[1:15:28] it says I'm sorry doing one of the times
[1:15:29] when the house burned down Susannah had
[1:15:33] to send her children to different homes
[1:15:35] friends and when they got back actually
[1:15:39] after the Hustlas rebuilt she said she
[1:15:41] was mortified because her children began
[1:15:43] to use the improper speech instead of
[1:15:45] talking and she got really upset she was
[1:15:50] Susanna Wesley was all about education
[1:15:53] she said as soon as her children turned
[1:15:55] five years old she said they were in
[1:15:57] school for six hours a day let me think
[1:15:59] about that you guys talk about our your
[1:16:01] home schools can't do it it's good to
[1:16:03] think about I gotta think about mine too
[1:16:05] it said right here that she expected our
[1:16:08] children to be in sitting in a desk for
[1:16:11] six hours every day so if you guys
[1:16:13] started at the same now kind you guys
[1:16:15] started at 10 a.m. you couldn't leave
[1:16:18] your chair to the floor peanut I'm
[1:16:22] pretty sure that's not she's 51 because
[1:16:24] with homeschool you go a lot faster
[1:16:25] because there's less kids they can go
[1:16:27] through a lot of work to earlier tasks
[1:16:29] because there's less kids but she was
[1:16:33] all about education Suzanne Weston
[1:16:35] really believes education a member a
[1:16:37] prayer warrior on top of all that she's
[1:16:39] a pretty woman he met next most up okay
[1:16:52] no all the daughters learned Latin and
[1:16:59] Greek that's how hard they worked in
[1:17:07] their books that in Greek and we're well
[1:17:10] tutored in the classical studies that
[1:17:11] were traditional in England at that time
[1:17:15] during a time when her husband was in
[1:17:18] London defending a friend against
[1:17:20] charges of heresy yet appointed a locum
[1:17:23] to bring them
[1:17:24] the man's sermons revolve solely around
[1:17:26] repaying debts the lack of diverse
[1:17:30] spiritual teaching cause Susannah to
[1:17:32] assembler her children Sunday afternoon
[1:17:33] her family services they would sing a
[1:17:37] song and then Susannah would read a
[1:17:39] sermon from either her husband's her
[1:17:41] father sermon file followed by another
[1:17:44] song instead when the preacher was a
[1:17:47] false preacher
[1:17:48] she bought her family after the sermon
[1:17:50] she pulled her family for a second
[1:17:52] service and she would read her husband's
[1:17:55] service because she knew they weren't
[1:17:57] getting spiritually fed that sound like
[1:17:59] a good mom making sure if they're not
[1:18:02] going to get fed there I'm gonna feed
[1:18:04] them at my house in other words for
[1:18:07] today be like this if you're not getting
[1:18:08] fed somewhere hopefully you're gonna fed
[1:18:10] here mercy if not let me know if you
[1:18:13] weren't getting fed the thing to do then
[1:18:15] is listen to more tapes at home right
[1:18:18] that's thing to do but she never stopped
[1:18:20] attending the church she gets supported
[1:18:22] to church but while her husband was gone
[1:18:24] hold them aside crate
[1:18:26] saying Psalms read The Book of Psalms to
[1:18:29] them and read her husband's sermons to
[1:18:31] make sure they got fed the Word of God
[1:18:36] the local people begin to ask if they
[1:18:39] can attend at one point there are over
[1:18:41] 200 people who attend Susanna's Sunday
[1:18:44] afternoon service we believe that over
[1:18:48] 200 people this is a woman that love the
[1:18:52] Lord my family is not getting fed I'm
[1:18:55] gonna make sure they get fed I'm gonna
[1:18:56] sing with them every Sunday praise God
[1:18:58] I'm gonna pray with them every Sunday
[1:18:59] and it produced the messenger of the age
[1:19:02] hallelujah and it produced the man who
[1:19:04] wrote six thousands of Giddings
[1:19:06] hallelujah all right
[1:19:19] susannah practice daily devotion
[1:19:21] throughout her life and in replied to
[1:19:24] her sons Charles letter she addressed
[1:19:26] her experience of the depravity of her
[1:19:28] human nature and the grace of God so
[1:19:31] this letter shows that she was awakened
[1:19:33] spiritually before her sons were
[1:19:36] awakened okay so that's that's what they
[1:19:39] prove my history she had a spiritual
[1:19:41] experience even before her sons did so I
[1:19:45] managed and you know she started
[1:19:47] following their teachings once they had
[1:19:49] it but she had a real walk with the Lord
[1:19:51] which is really nice to see that that's
[1:19:56] one more paragraph her husband Sandra
[1:19:59] spent his whole life and all the
[1:20:00] family's finances on his book about the
[1:20:04] book of Job however his work was not
[1:20:08] remembered and had little impact on his
[1:20:09] family other than the hardships they
[1:20:12] went through but it says in contrast
[1:20:14] Susanna wrote several pieces that would
[1:20:16] be fundamental in the education of her
[1:20:18] children along with letter she wrote
[1:20:22] meditations and scriptural commentaries
[1:20:24] for her own use in other words she
[1:20:26] journal about the Bible well this means
[1:20:28] this to me this means that to me this
[1:20:30] was a blessing here few journal about
[1:20:33] the Bible okay
[1:20:44] and let me close with one more day here
[1:20:46] my gosh let me close with one more thing
[1:20:47] do for Yotam okay good all right now
[1:20:50] let's go back and your bottom sink your
[1:20:52] Bible sure that's close I'm gonna get on
[1:20:53] a different thought as we close kind of
[1:20:56] goes with John Wesley now let's go to
[1:21:01] Revelation chapter 3 here still have
[1:21:04] thought the Prophet brings us up in the
[1:21:07] actual preaching of the total future
[1:21:09] change in the sermon from 1960
[1:21:18] revelation 3 verse 1 let's read a few in
[1:21:24] here since we've got a little bit
[1:21:28] I'm sorry I'm really trying to control
[1:21:30] not a throat because it really hurts
[1:21:31] these program you my wife's making
[1:21:34] specialties for me and I'm sure I was
[1:21:36] trying that
[1:21:39] because here's the reality Church not
[1:21:43] the last year I've been preaching and
[1:21:46] singing at least three times a week two
[1:21:49] or three times a week every service and
[1:21:51] I just get so excited I just go too loud
[1:21:54] I can only go so far on that and then
[1:21:57] now I started well then we did a Bible
[1:21:59] Club when school starts so I'm singing
[1:22:01] and shouting they're trying to get the
[1:22:02] kids attention and then we started
[1:22:04] another ba because I would I'm doing the
[1:22:06] same thing they're so it's like having
[1:22:08] five services and I just haven't been
[1:22:12] taken care of and then I go to Taekwondo
[1:22:14] I've took the last month off but you
[1:22:16] have to shout there too supposed to
[1:22:17] punch and shout out so I throws didn't
[1:22:19] know and all day I teach at school I
[1:22:21] don't get any break talking I break from
[1:22:25] talking just have mercy on that have
[1:22:29] mercy on that side like that I don't
[1:22:31] want to leave the paupers but I just
[1:22:32] seem like I need a little break so
[1:22:33] hopefully I can send some helpers you
[1:22:35] know by God's grace well like I said I'm
[1:22:39] trying to bite people they keep turning
[1:22:40] me down okay a relation someone look at
[1:22:48] this last off of the name and unto the
[1:22:52] Angel of the church in Sardis write
[1:22:53] these things saith he that had the seven
[1:22:55] spirits of God and the Seven Stars I
[1:22:58] know that works that thou has a name
[1:23:00] that now liveth but our dead see they
[1:23:04] had a denominational name but they were
[1:23:06] dead to the things of God those are the
[1:23:09] people that were not a part of Luther's
[1:23:11] church be watchful and strengthen the
[1:23:14] things which remain that are ready to
[1:23:15] die or I'd not found thy works perfect
[1:23:18] before God remember therefore how the
[1:23:21] ice received and heard and hold fast and
[1:23:24] repent if therefore thou shalt not watch
[1:23:27] I will call on thee as a thief and thou
[1:23:29] shalt not know what hour come upon me
[1:23:32] now has a few names even as ours which
[1:23:35] have not defiled their garments and they
[1:23:37] shall walk with me in white
[1:23:41] for they are worthy okay now let stop
[1:23:46] right there just roamed now remember the
[1:23:47] Prophet said Sardis was the age where
[1:23:49] they lost the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:50] Christ remember he said they actually
[1:23:53] lost around the fire to your church they
[1:23:57] they weren't using the name of the Lord
[1:24:00] they had their own names and then in the
[1:24:03] Sardis church age of verse 1 it says
[1:24:04] they have a name but they're dead so
[1:24:07] they have a name like well I'm a Baptist
[1:24:10] or I'm a Catholic or I'm this or on that
[1:24:12] they have a name but they're actually
[1:24:13] spiritually dead and the prophets that
[1:24:17] they didn't have the name of Jesus
[1:24:19] Christ and history says that in it they
[1:24:20] just said father son Holy Ghost like
[1:24:22] people do I don't even know what do they
[1:24:23] do I'm just this is I'm just trying to
[1:24:25] remember what they do something like
[1:24:27] this I don't know but they lost their
[1:24:30] yeah they lost they lost the name of
[1:24:32] Christ and that's what the problem with
[1:24:34] denominations who believe in three
[1:24:36] persons in three gods it's really three
[1:24:38] gods they have three separate titles
[1:24:40] three separate names it's wrong they
[1:24:43] shouldn't do that but this age Sardis
[1:24:46] had they just had the Father Son Holy
[1:24:49] Ghost most of them they didn't have the
[1:24:51] name of Jesus now it's interesting
[1:24:54] Church now now let's go to verse 5 and
[1:25:02] here's the thought that I thought the
[1:25:04] Lord brought to me this may have been a
[1:25:06] few weeks ago yeah scope weeks ago in
[1:25:09] the age when the name of Christ was not
[1:25:13] known and in the age when they had the
[1:25:16] wrong name the reward for the overcomer
[1:25:19] of that age was to be given the name of
[1:25:22] Christ is that in your Senate so this
[1:25:25] age Sardis age had a major focus on a
[1:25:28] name there's something important about a
[1:25:30] name because it represents Authority it
[1:25:33] represents you as an individual it
[1:25:36] represents your identity don't we all
[1:25:38] one identity right like me my identity
[1:25:41] so I'm Jesse Smith you know I'm a
[1:25:43] teacher I'm a father I'm a pastor my
[1:25:45] name is wrapped around my identity right
[1:25:48] and so in the age where they they didn't
[1:25:52] have the identity of Christ Jesus says
[1:25:54] if your face
[1:25:54] for me you'll have mine in Maine I'm
[1:25:56] gonna give you by name so they reversed
[1:25:59] five he that overcometh the same shall
[1:26:01] be clothed in white raiment and I will
[1:26:03] not blot out his name on the book of
[1:26:07] life praise God
[1:26:07] so there's a great emphasis on the name
[1:26:09] in the Sardis Church age and that leads
[1:26:12] into the next often let's keep reading
[1:26:14] and I will confess his name before my
[1:26:18] father and before his angels now in this
[1:26:23] age now sort of Philadelphia verse
[1:26:29] where's that okay verse eight I know
[1:26:35] that works for you hold I have set
[1:26:36] before thee an open door and no man can
[1:26:39] shut it for thou has a little strength
[1:26:40] and has kept my word and has not denied
[1:26:44] my name
[1:26:46] there it is brother Branham said this I
[1:26:49] like to truth according to be what my
[1:26:50] RAM said that father son Holy Ghost here
[1:26:52] he said the name of Jesus Christ was
[1:26:54] restored at the end of this age praise
[1:26:57] God
[1:26:58] so see here they had a name but they
[1:27:00] weren't living it they didn't know life
[1:27:02] so he's had a church name and he jesus
[1:27:04] promises I'll give you my name and then
[1:27:07] the very next age because of their
[1:27:08] faithfulness
[1:27:09] now this age restores or gets the
[1:27:12] restoration of the name of Jesus Christ
[1:27:14] back please God I think that's beautiful
[1:27:17] and now they've got the reward for
[1:27:19] Philadelphia so stand to our feet here
[1:27:21] our posters brother Branham in the
[1:27:27] sermon gonna help you church age said
[1:27:29] this is a three-fold name reward a
[1:27:32] three-fold name or word verse 12
[1:27:34] either overcometh will i make a pillar
[1:27:38] that double my god and he should go no
[1:27:40] more out and i'll write upon him the
[1:27:42] name of my god he's the lord and the
[1:27:47] name of the city of my god propagate the
[1:27:50] new jerusalem bless you thank you
[1:27:52] which is New Jerusalem which cometh down
[1:27:55] out of heaven from my god that all right
[1:27:59] upon him my praise God
[1:28:03] how did it go did you catch that the
[1:28:07] name of God was lost
[1:28:08] God was slowly restoring it and then now
[1:28:11] here now we get the name of Jesus Christ
[1:28:15] back and he said all those who have the
[1:28:17] literal name bring back the literal name
[1:28:19] of Jesus Christ he said I'm gonna write
[1:28:21] upon you the name of God so that's not
[1:28:24] gonna be the name of God the name of New
[1:28:25] Jerusalem and then my you name the name
[1:28:28] of Jesus Christ amen
[1:28:30] so see there's an importance of the name
[1:28:33] brother Brooks came here and preached on
[1:28:35] harm the name of Jesus Christ there's
[1:28:37] power in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:28:40] church God was going to restore his name
[1:28:44] in this age so he could have chose no
[1:28:47] better man to use than John Wesley
[1:28:50] someone who would love the name so much
[1:28:52] he preached on that name 800 time TV and
[1:28:58] give him a mommy that would pray for him
[1:28:59] right and talked with him every week
[1:29:02] praise the Lord and pray our for their
[1:29:05] family every single day this is the kind
[1:29:07] of is the kind of family that the name
[1:29:10] of Christ gets honored in they may
[1:29:14] praise the Lord thank God there are some
[1:29:16] families doing that by God's grace we
[1:29:18] need a lot more of it though how many
[1:29:20] thankful for the word Lord Amen thank
[1:29:22] you for bearing with me I appreciate
[1:29:23] your patience and usually a little more
[1:29:25] you know energetic but they're just
[1:29:26] trying to try to control myself here
[1:29:28] tonight but it's the truth behind it
[1:29:30] that's not about my emotion or your it
[1:29:33] it's about the truth behind all these
[1:29:35] things so as we prepare to pray how many
[1:29:38] would say lord help me to take more
[1:29:40] advantage of my time hoping to be more
[1:29:43] faithful with my time help me to live
[1:29:44] the name of Jesus Christ Susanna Wesley
[1:29:48] 10 children she's all alone her husband
[1:29:50] wasn't around and yet she still said I'm
[1:29:52] gonna I'm gonna value this time I'm
[1:29:55] gonna redeem the time and I'm gonna put
[1:29:58] all my focus on my children to prepare
[1:30:01] the next generation and look what it
[1:30:03] produced John Wesley Charles Wesley
[1:30:06] praise God
[1:30:07] what a wonderful thought this is what a
[1:30:10] great look at history I'm so blessed by
[1:30:11] that you know I shared that about the
[1:30:14] sisters about the maid because you know
[1:30:16] sisters feel bad now talk to my wife and
[1:30:18] and other sisters they feel bad when
[1:30:21] they hear this
[1:30:22] Wesley prayed our day with 10 kids you
[1:30:24] know but people don't know she had a
[1:30:26] baby yeah
[1:30:27] they don't know that if you had help at
[1:30:30] your house for an hour day you could get
[1:30:31] a lot more done - but the point is she
[1:30:35] was committed to praying she was stay
[1:30:37] faithful to her husband she was
[1:30:39] committed to her children and the thing
[1:30:41] was she invested in the talents that God
[1:30:43] made man praise God so let's just pray
[1:30:46] let's ask God to help us to invest in
[1:30:48] the talents he gives us and perhaps this
[1:30:50] may be more pray that God will help you
[1:30:52] to see what's a tailor in your life that
[1:30:54] maybe were missing

[1:31:30] Fame of faith had been written after the
[1:31:32] days of Wesley Susanna Wesley would have
[1:31:34] been in there

[1:31:44] inspiration of the Holy Spirit of Hope

[1:31:52] a.m. and preached sometimes four times a
