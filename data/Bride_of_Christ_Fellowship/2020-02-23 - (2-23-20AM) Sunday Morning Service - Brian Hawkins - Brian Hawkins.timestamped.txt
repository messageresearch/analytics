[17:21] thank going man so sorry but I dream
[17:37] that I was in my dream I was sleeping in
[17:40] my dream and uh I turn around and I
[17:42] instantly saw Jesus and he looked
[17:45] exactly like that but he was wearing a
[17:47] white robe instead I was so excited I
[17:49] was crying like Jesus is really I really
[17:52] thought the rapture happened but um he
[17:55] told me um he told me I'm coming now and
[17:59] at first I really understand it cuz I'm
[18:01] just so excited I thought he was already
[18:03] here and I was holding his hand he told
[18:05] me again tell my people I'm coming now
[18:08] and I woke up and I'm here to tell you
[18:11] I'm just here to share their dream huh
[18:13] tell you guys that Jesus is coming now
[18:15] and I told them that I would tell you
[18:17] guys Iowa says we'll know the time and
[18:28] season so that that's that's what that
[18:31] must mean right he's saying now it must
[18:33] be the time and season no man knows the
[18:36] day or the hour so we're just looking
[18:38] for the coming of the Lord trimming our
[18:40] lamps praise God
[18:42] being ready for the coming of God amen
[18:44] and ISIF sister Cheyenne if she would
[18:47] share just real quick her testimony
[18:49] about her eyes being healed so if you
[18:53] wouldn't mind sister would you come
[18:54] sharing that just real quick I thought
[18:56] that'd be a real good encouragement to
[18:57] the church here it's good to be here to
[19:02] see you all um whenever I was younger my
[19:06] mom noticed about my eyes
[19:08] we're crossings
[19:09] of course I had to get glasses and them
[19:12] so through the years probably about the
[19:14] time I was 12 I got sick and tired of
[19:16] every month so I went up for prayer I
[19:18] had my pastor pray for me and he annoyed
[19:21] me boy and prayed for me and I still
[19:24] didn't see the results but I quit
[19:25] wearing my glasses and a few years later
[19:29] at believers youth camp brother Tim
[19:35] Pruett was ministering Jr and he was
[19:39] reading out of the the book prophet
[19:42] visit South Africa just reading
[19:44] different witnesses and testimonies from
[19:46] that and one of the ones that he read
[19:49] well during service my ayah was crossing
[19:51] and it was like very distracting because
[19:53] I'm trying to focus on the testimonies
[19:55] and I couldn't focus and so so I just
[19:59] started thanking Lord for healing me um
[20:02] just quietly you know thank you Lord for
[20:04] healing my eyes and as soon as I started
[20:07] doing that he started reading a
[20:08] testimony from the book that was about a
[20:12] young girl saying in the congregation
[20:14] who was born with crossed eyes and she
[20:17] had talked to sister Bosworth I think it
[20:19] was about like she couldn't get in the
[20:24] prayer line and stuff like that and she
[20:26] said well just pray and ask the Lord to
[20:28] raise your faith to the healing level
[20:31] and like it's everything in the
[20:33] testimony I felt like was exactly what I
[20:36] needed and so I just started thanking
[20:38] the Lord and praising him and um my
[20:42] healing still wasn't manifested at that
[20:44] point I don't know maybe my faith wasn't
[20:46] quite up so we're supposed to be I don't
[20:49] know the Lord knows but um then year to
[20:53] later which was this past year at
[20:55] believers youth camp I was just sitting
[20:58] there brother Andrew Glover was
[20:59] preaching and just in the service all of
[21:02] a sudden my eyes just focused on me and
[21:04] it was like the first time in years I
[21:05] could see a minister straight without my
[21:08] eyes cross and everything so just other
[21:10] thing my hair
[21:12] [Applause]
[21:18] Thank You sister I appreciate that you
[21:22] know one of the reasons I want her to
[21:23] share that was because bang came up for
[21:27] prayer I think two weeks ago or a week
[21:28] ago and asked that we'd pray for CEA's
[21:32] eyes and so I just thought that'd be an
[21:35] encouragement now they're not here but
[21:36] I'll tell them to go back and listen to
[21:38] the beginning of the service or the
[21:40] testimony I think they'll be a great
[21:42] encouragement what a great testimony of
[21:44] just waiting upon the Lord praise God
[21:46] just being patient right there the wait
[21:48] upon the Lord renew their strength so I
[21:50] thought that'd be a great encouragement
[21:51] for us to keep waiting on the Lord
[21:53] whatever our need is we just need to
[21:55] keep waiting upon God pema confessing
[21:58] keep them even keep trusting in the Lord
[22:01] so any requests that we have this
[22:04] morning I'd like to remember the Sanchez
[22:07] family I text brother Richard Sanchez
[22:10] his granddaughter passed away
[22:12] Lilliana a six year old from cancer I
[22:15] texted him and he thanked us for our
[22:17] prayers and let's just continue to pray
[22:20] for them it's really difficult obviously
[22:23] and then brother Brian said there's a
[22:25] family near him who had a tragic loss of
[22:30] a young son so let's let's just remember
[22:32] them in prayer does anybody else 17
[22:36] needs they like to be remembered this
[22:37] morning sister that's right the Gousha

[40:43] every sin every iniquity not just myself
[40:45] but every person in here that we become
[40:47] with the confidence in our heart Lord
[40:49] I'm sure each person in here has a need
[40:51] upon their hearts this morning something
[40:53] that's in the back of their mind
[40:54] something that's been troubling them all
[40:56] week months or years whatever it might
[40:58] be Lord God but but to know that you
[41:01] were the waymaker this morning the
[41:03] father of our faith could just look up
[41:05] to you if our faith could just reach its
[41:07] target this morning nor God increase our
[41:09] faith and nor God we just pray that you
[41:12] would help our unbelief this morning and

[41:17] faith Lord God I pray that you regard my

[41:46] time just pray that you would bless each
[41:48] of us here and we could receive from you
[41:50] this morning we ask it your blessed name
[41:52] our Lord Jesus Christ as is my usual
[42:03] dilemma it's not so much of a dilemma
[42:09] all the time I just don't know which way
[42:11] to go
[42:12] yet this morning this
[42:19] mr. out here if you would turn with me
[42:24] to John chapter 1 the home church sends
[42:32] greetings brother Frank brother Jim
[42:35] sister Eileen sister Kathy all the
[42:38] different ones they're supposed to tell
[42:42] you that brother Frank you owe him a
[42:44] text
[42:44] I had to write that down because or I
[42:49] would have forgot that we both would
[42:52] have been in trouble no brother Frank is
[42:55] a wonderful brother and named rightly
[42:59] you know could appreciate the brother
[43:02] that if he has something to say you know
[43:04] where he stands if he has something to
[43:06] say you know you know where he stands
[43:07] that he you're not wondering where he's
[43:10] sitting so he'll plainly tell you so and
[43:14] just appreciate the brother thank you
[43:16] for the opportunity that we could be
[43:18] here this morning that it's wonderful to
[43:21] see you all again amen
[43:24] is it okay if I shed this early John
[43:31] chapter one and verse one it says in the
[43:36] beginning was the word and the Word was
[43:38] with God and the Word was God
[43:43] the same was in the beginning with God
[43:46] all things were made by him and without
[43:52] him was not anything made that was made
[43:55] so nothing was made without him having
[43:58] his hand put to it amen in him was life
[44:02] and the life was the light of been and
[44:07] the light shine earth and darkness and
[44:09] the darkness comprehended it not now
[44:13] comprehend means to understand so the
[44:18] darkness
[44:18] cannot understand the light it
[44:20] comprehended it not it also means to
[44:22] possess so the darkness could not
[44:24] possess the light it could not overtake
[44:25] the light to possess the light so it
[44:27] could not understand the light darkness
[44:29] doesn't understand what light does we
[44:33] here in in verse four we hear that the
[44:40] light of man or that there is light and
[44:42] man brother Branham talked about taking
[44:46] x-rays that that a man's body has light
[44:50] in it already so we know that a man has
[44:55] light as long as he lives but when when
[44:58] that man dies the light goes out
[44:59] naturally so spiritually being in the
[45:03] light as he is in the light there is
[45:05] light but when a man lives in sin he
[45:09] lives in darkness and he doesn't
[45:10] comprehend the light so we so to have
[45:15] light means to have the source of life
[45:17] for he said he was the resurrection and
[45:20] the life and what I'd like to talk on
[45:22] this morning is that is the source in
[45:27] Matthew 5 and 16 at referencing verse 4
[45:32] of John 1 and verse 4 it says in him was
[45:36] life and the life was the light of men
[45:38] and in Matthew 5:16 it says let your
[45:41] light so shine before men so he's saying
[45:43] that you have a light but that light if
[45:46] you abide in him that is his light
[45:48] abiding in you amen
[45:49] so it's it's an int you're an individual
[45:53] person but it's his light that they may
[45:56] see your good works and glorify your
[45:58] father which is in heaven see his
[46:00] individual works but it's his works
[46:03] going through you for didn't he say the
[46:07] same works that I do shall you do also
[46:09] and those works people will know you by
[46:13] those works and they will glorify the
[46:15] father in you amen you may be seated
[46:20] now first corinthians chapter eight kind
[46:26] of like to talk on seen and unseen
[46:28] unseen things first corinthians chapter
[46:32] 8 and verse 1 it says now as touching
[46:35] things offered unto idols we know that
[46:40] we all have knowledge every one of us
[46:42] has some kind of a knowledge but he says
[46:44] knowledge puffeth up so when we learn
[46:46] something we gain some knowledge we gain
[46:48] a little bit of confidence and in that
[46:50] confidence we get a little hotty with
[46:52] that knowledge some a little bit more
[46:53] than others but notice what he says here
[46:58] but charity edifieth everybody has some
[47:01] kind of a knowledge but not like he said
[47:04] that knowledge puffs up love does not
[47:06] puffs up but love edifies love vaunteth
[47:10] not itself it is not selfish but love
[47:13] edifies and verse 2 it says and if any
[47:17] man think that he knoweth anything he
[47:19] knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know
[47:21] but if any man love God the same is
[47:25] known of him so when you love God people
[47:27] are gonna know that you love God you
[47:28] don't have to have a billboard going
[47:30] around saying I'm a Christian I love God
[47:32] they're gonna know that you love God now
[47:38] it's concerning therefore the eating of
[47:41] those things that are offered in
[47:42] sacrifice unto idols we know that an
[47:46] idol is nothing in the world and that
[47:48] there is none other but got none other
[47:50] God but one is all right there's one God
[47:54] for though there be that are for though
[47:58] there be that are called God's whether
[48:00] in heaven or on earth as there be God's
[48:03] many and Lords Betty notice that's
[48:05] lowercase God's lowercase Lords but
[48:08] there is one capital G god amen but unto
[48:14] us there is but one God the Father of
[48:16] whom are all things and we in him and
[48:19] one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all
[48:21] things and we by him as we open up in
[48:24] Scripture that God made everything the
[48:27] father made everything and nothing was
[48:29] made except unless he was involved with
[48:31] it so his hand was put to it all
[48:34] and verse 7 it says howbeit there is not
[48:38] in every man that knowledge not everyone
[48:40] knows all this so blessed are you amen
[48:45] howbeit there is not in every man that
[48:47] knowledge for some with conscience of
[48:49] the idol unto this hour eat it as a
[48:52] thing offered unto an idol and their
[48:54] conscience being weak is defiled see for
[48:56] some with their conscience their
[48:58] conscious of it because it's there set
[48:59] before them so they could see that Idol
[49:01] so they could worship that I know they
[49:03] could sacrifice under that Idol but look
[49:07] what God said we look at the unseen you
[49:11] look what your mortal eyes don't see you
[49:13] don't see with your eyes anyhow
[49:15] you only look with your eyes you see
[49:18] with your heart you look right at and
[49:22] say I don't see it how many times you go
[49:23] into the fridge room you're looking at
[49:25] something what I can't find it I can't
[49:27] see it because you don't understand that
[49:29] it's right there in front of you when
[49:34] you say I don't see it you mean you
[49:36] don't understand it you're seeing is
[49:37] understanding so you understand with
[49:40] your heart in 2nd Corinthians chapter 4
[49:45] and verse 16 it says for which cause we
[49:48] faint not but though our outward man
[49:51] perish yet the inward man is renewed day
[49:54] by day for our light affliction which is
[49:58] but for a moment worketh for us a far
[50:00] more exceeding and eternal weight of
[50:02] glory and verse 18 is what I was talking
[50:05] about while we look at we look not at
[50:07] the things which are seen but at the
[50:09] things which are not seen for the things
[50:13] which are seen are temporal see those
[50:16] gods that those lowercase gods and those
[50:18] lower coat with lower case lords those
[50:21] are temporal those things are going to
[50:23] perish it's something that the thief
[50:25] could steal is something that the Ruskin
[50:27] can wither away those are the things
[50:31] which are that are temporal but the
[50:33] things which are not seen are eternal
[50:36] now I read this somewhere I can't
[50:39] remember who or where I got it from I
[50:42] like to give credit where I get
[50:44] information but he kind of breaks it
[50:46] down in this way he says so we fixed
[50:48] our eyes not on what is seen but on what
[50:51] is unseen for what is seen is temporary
[50:54] which is what we just read but what is
[50:57] unseen is eternal so if I live for
[50:59] anything that I can see I'm dead even
[51:04] why my while my physical body is
[51:06] breathing but I live for what is not
[51:10] seen I live even if I lose my physical
[51:15] body I have a lot of scriptures so bear
[51:18] with me first John and four and twelve
[51:29] kind of quiet this morning I'm wonder if
[51:32] I got the right one first John in four
[51:39] verse 12 it says no man hath seen God at
[51:43] any time
[51:44] has anybody seen God at any time I've
[51:46] never seen God face to face I've never
[51:49] seen if we love one another god dwelleth
[51:52] in US and his love is perfected in us
[51:57] hereby know we that we dwell in him and
[52:00] he in us because he had given us given
[52:04] us of his spirit and we have seen and do
[52:08] testify that the father sent the son to
[52:10] be the savior of the world
[52:13] whosoever shall confess that Jesus is
[52:16] the Son of God God dwelleth in him and
[52:18] he and God and we have known and
[52:23] believed the love that God has to us for
[52:27] god is love and he that dwelleth in love
[52:29] dwelleth in God and God in him
[52:33] herein is our love made perfect that we
[52:36] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[52:39] because as he is so are we in this world
[52:42] and as we've read that those that love
[52:45] God are known of that and like I said we
[52:51] don't have to put a big billboard sign
[52:53] on us and flashing lights and a big
[52:55] marquee rolling around behind our
[52:57] vehicle that you're a Christian people
[52:59] are going to be able to tell that amen
[53:00] so verse 18 a' says there is no fear in
[53:06] love but perfect love casteth out fear
[53:09] because fear hath torment he that
[53:13] feareth is not made perfect in love we
[53:18] love him because he first loved us if a
[53:21] man say I love God there here comes a
[53:24] clincher if a man say I love God and
[53:27] hated this brother he is a liar for he
[53:32] that loveth not his brother whom he has
[53:34] seen how can he love God whom he have
[53:38] not seen i-i've talked on this back to
[53:42] the home church and it's been a common
[53:44] statement that I've said it that it's
[53:45] that it's difficult to love the unseen
[53:48] it's it's it's difficult to love a a
[53:51] being that you can't see more than
[53:54] others that you can see so it's hard
[53:57] it's hard for us as natural men to to
[54:00] love of God love a God that we cannot
[54:02] see more than love our wives or our
[54:05] children or our friends different ones
[54:07] it gets a little bit difficult so I
[54:09] think sometimes get a little people get
[54:11] a little discouraged through that let me
[54:15] finish up with verse 21 it says and this
[54:18] commandment hath we from him that he who
[54:21] loveth God love his brother also so you
[54:25] can't do both you can't hate one and
[54:28] love the other you suit and you can't
[54:30] have that hate in your in your in your
[54:33] body towards your own brother and say
[54:35] that you love God for he says you become
[54:38] a liar by trying to do so but people God
[54:46] is contingent in people's mind on the
[54:52] fact of
[54:52] could see him or not because that that's
[54:55] what people say I can't believe in a god
[54:57] that I can't see well you go to you
[55:02] might go to an illusionist or you might
[55:04] enjoy going to a magician and you might
[55:08] see that you might love all those little
[55:09] tricks and you might say well I believe
[55:12] that could happen but here was an
[55:14] illusion the whole time that's why
[55:15] they're called an illusionist you know
[55:17] they make it look like something real
[55:19] happened but it was a trick it was a
[55:20] trick of the eye so you rather just you
[55:23] know anybody older I'm sure I'm sure
[55:25] everybody's heard the the the adage that
[55:27] the hand is quicker than the eye so
[55:29] somebody could take something from you
[55:31] faster than what you could see so seeing
[55:34] isn't always believing because the way
[55:38] that we pick things up through our eye
[55:40] through our mind then through the whole
[55:42] process you might see something that you
[55:44] really don't see so and a lot of
[55:48] people's relationship of whether or not
[55:51] God exists is contingent of if they
[55:54] could see him or not so if you believe
[55:58] in God this morning how great is your
[56:00] faith and a god that you can't see and
[56:02] you continue to love them and you
[56:03] continue to have that relationship grow
[56:05] amen but you know you can't see a lot of
[56:09] things but people realize that people
[56:15] realize that they exist and I'm going to
[56:18] get into a few examples here because
[56:20] they see what it could do so you may not
[56:25] be able to see God but you could see his
[56:26] manifestation you can't see different
[56:28] things let's let's say I'll just get
[56:33] into the examples
[56:36] everybody knows what a faucet is you go
[56:38] wash your hands in a faucet but a faucet
[56:42] has nothing of itself the faucet has to
[56:45] be tapped into a source for without us
[56:47] it could do nothing you can't see what's
[56:51] behind that faucet until the faith is
[56:54] applied brother Branham taught about and
[56:56] taught us about faith that it takes
[56:58] faith just to start your car so it takes
[57:01] faith to go and turn the faucet on
[57:03] something simple is that see when you go
[57:06] up to the faucet you're you have an
[57:08] expectation that when you turn that
[57:09] handle that there's going to be some
[57:11] kind of power behind that Amen so but
[57:15] without us that faucet can do nothing
[57:16] and you can't see anything but what's
[57:19] behind there you just see the plumbing
[57:20] and you see the manifestation of what
[57:23] comes out but you can't see further
[57:24] ahead you can't see with the sources you
[57:26] just believe that that's going to come
[57:28] through the pipe but how many times have
[57:32] you turned on the faucet and and you're
[57:35] expecting something to come out and it
[57:36] doesn't come out and you're just sitting
[57:38] there wondering what's going on well the
[57:42] first rule of troubleshooting whether
[57:44] it's an electrical circuit or or
[57:46] something and plumbing you could apply
[57:48] it to your life at any time the first
[57:50] rule of troubleshooting is is there
[57:52] power it as it turned on or somebody
[57:56] didn't push the button to turn it back
[57:58] on so that's that's like the number one
[58:01] thing that happens is that you'll find
[58:04] that there is no power so you just you
[58:07] have to ask yourself is it tapped into
[58:09] the source is there something wrong
[58:11] between it and the source between the
[58:14] faucet and the source is there something
[58:16] wrong in between so that's and you could
[58:20] apply the same thing in your life that
[58:22] is there something between me and God
[58:24] something between me and the source why
[58:27] is there not power in my life because
[58:29] I'm sure we've all had the question or
[58:31] just like gideon if god before is where
[58:33] are all the miracles if god be for us
[58:35] where are all these things I'm not
[58:37] seeing anything happening well seeing
[58:39] isn't always a believing thing amen so
[58:41] seeing just believing that God is and
[58:44] it's not an experience whether you see
[58:45] it or whether
[58:46] you don't see it whether you feel it or
[58:48] whether you don't feel it but that you
[58:50] believe that he is and that he is a
[58:52] rewarder of those who diligently seek
[58:55] Him amen
[58:55] so somewhere down the line in the past
[58:59] something got between you and the source
[59:01] so now you have to find out why is that
[59:03] why isn't there no power behind it so
[59:06] you have to go back to the past where it
[59:09] went off so somebody might have went
[59:11] through and and shut the see I shut the
[59:13] hose off to the outside downstairs in
[59:15] the winter so the faucet the spigot
[59:17] outside doesn't freeze so if we don't
[59:19] remember what happened in the past how
[59:22] can you get right with God if you don't
[59:23] go back to the past where you changed
[59:26] this situation you change the
[59:28] circumstance but you have to go back to
[59:31] that point and turn that power back on
[59:33] amen but you have to be tapped into the
[59:38] source amen John 15 and 5 he says I am
[59:42] the vine and ye are the branches he that
[59:44] abideth in me and I in him the same
[59:46] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[59:49] you can do nothing so the faucet is
[59:51] sitting in the same condition without us
[59:53] it can do absolutely nothing
[59:56] amen so the only power that a faucet has
[59:59] is what you put to it it's only when the
[1:00:04] faucet is put to use that it has power
[1:00:06] behind it now power comes from the
[1:00:09] pressure of what's pushing behind it
[1:00:11] that's where the power is it's something
[1:00:14] else the faucet doesn't have the power
[1:00:15] of itself it's what's behind it that's
[1:00:18] pushing the power through it so it's not
[1:00:20] the faucets work since the source works
[1:00:22] it's not our work since his works
[1:00:24] through us amen everybody knows what an
[1:00:29] aerator is it goes right onto your
[1:00:31] faucet if you don't have that aerator on
[1:00:34] there it's kind of out of control but an
[1:00:35] aerator it controls the flow so you have
[1:00:38] so you use less water pretty much it
[1:00:41] kind of adds air into it but it controls
[1:00:43] the flow now if you have a gummed up
[1:00:45] aerator it's it's kind of it looks like
[1:00:48] a screen and it screws right onto your
[1:00:50] faucet so if that's all plugged up it
[1:00:53] restricts the flow now see we don't want
[1:00:57] our life all clogged up with sin and the
[1:00:59] blackness of sin
[1:01:00] man we you've got to have a clear
[1:01:02] passage it has to be clear now just
[1:01:07] because you see a faucet doesn't mean
[1:01:09] that it has power having a form of
[1:01:11] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:01:13] amen it has a potential just sitting
[1:01:16] there it has a potential but it has to
[1:01:19] be chosen and it has to be tapped into
[1:01:21] the resource you can go to Lowe's and
[1:01:23] Home Depot and they have all kinds of
[1:01:26] faucets but that doesn't mean that
[1:01:27] they've got power they're just sitting
[1:01:29] there waiting on something but every one
[1:01:33] of them they're in empty vessels all
[1:01:35] right
[1:01:36] they're just waiting to be put to use it
[1:01:39] has to be chosen you have to walk the
[1:01:40] aisle you have to find one that you like
[1:01:42] you have to pick it out so you have to
[1:01:44] justify and then you have to go and then
[1:01:46] you have to sanctify and then you have
[1:01:48] to fill it with the Holy Ghost amen it
[1:01:50] has to go through the certain steps to
[1:01:52] receive that power and have that power
[1:01:54] to go through it amen
[1:01:56] so a faucet isn't a faucet just because
[1:02:00] it looks like a faucet it's a vessel
[1:02:02] that just sits there claiming to be a
[1:02:04] faucet a faucet is a faucet when it
[1:02:07] meets a criteria of what a faucet is
[1:02:09] supposed to do see faith without works
[1:02:11] is dead a Christian isn't a Christian
[1:02:16] just because someone labeled them that
[1:02:17] way a Christian is Christ like doing the
[1:02:22] works of the Father when people see you
[1:02:25] doing the works of the Father father you
[1:02:27] will be known as a Christian for it's
[1:02:29] the same word same n if any man loves
[1:02:32] God the same is known of him now
[1:02:34] plumbing and electrical that parallel
[1:02:37] each other so when you learn electrical
[1:02:39] they'll teach you the analogy of
[1:02:41] plumbing and vice versa with plumbing
[1:02:44] they'll teach you about electrical
[1:02:45] because it's pretty much the same thing
[1:02:47] because you have to apply power and then
[1:02:49] you have flow so power has to come from
[1:02:56] somewhere you know basic physics it
[1:02:59] states that an object at rest tends to
[1:03:01] stay at rest unless some outside other
[1:03:06] than itself something outside force some
[1:03:08] outside force changes its state and an
[1:03:11] object in motion tends to remain in
[1:03:13] motion
[1:03:14] with a constant velocity unless it's
[1:03:16] acted on by a nonzero net force that's
[1:03:20] friction gravity and any other force
[1:03:22] that would try to get between you and
[1:03:24] God amen anything that would try to
[1:03:26] hinder your walk power only happens when
[1:03:32] there is energy flow voltage in an
[1:03:35] electrical circuit is the pressure that
[1:03:37] makes current flow voltage and current
[1:03:39] are not the same voltage pushes the
[1:03:42] current through the circuit now what you
[1:03:44] what you end up having is oh my goodness
[1:03:47] in an electrical circuit whoo-hoo there
[1:03:51] has to be continuity in this circuit if
[1:03:53] you want to maintain power from the
[1:03:56] source there has to be an unbroken
[1:03:58] circuit in there your relationship has
[1:04:01] to be an unbroken with continuity with
[1:04:04] God amen
[1:04:05] and yeah and there's there's a thing
[1:04:07] called resistance Oh resist not the Holy
[1:04:10] Ghost my brothers and sisters because it
[1:04:14] slows the float of God be not quick to
[1:04:16] resist the Holy Ghost amen amen
[1:04:20] but you must maintain continuity with
[1:04:24] the source but the point of all this is
[1:04:27] being is that you don't see it happening
[1:04:29] you don't see the electricity flowing
[1:04:31] but as soon as you turn on that switch
[1:04:33] by faith you're connected to the power
[1:04:35] source here it comes the manifestation
[1:04:37] you see the light so just because people
[1:04:40] can't see God and they say that there's
[1:04:42] no God because I don't see them they
[1:04:43] should be able to see that and not every
[1:04:45] man has this knowledge but they should
[1:04:47] be able to see the manifestation of God
[1:04:49] in your life amen the manifestation
[1:04:54] should be there if the manifestation is
[1:04:57] not there if they can't do it would you
[1:04:58] be convicted if somebody charged you for
[1:05:01] being a Christian would there be enough
[1:05:02] evidence to convict you oh my people
[1:05:09] don't see that happening but they should
[1:05:11] be able to see the change that has taken
[1:05:12] place when when you're picked up from a
[1:05:15] broken condition and and God tends to
[1:05:17] mend all these puts all these patches no
[1:05:19] he doesn't put patches on anything he
[1:05:20] renews it but he sees them he's the the
[1:05:24] people should be able to see the work
[1:05:26] that he's doing
[1:05:27] you know you don't cuss anymore you
[1:05:28] don't drink anymore you don't smoke
[1:05:30] anymore and people have - it stands to
[1:05:33] reason or question why don't you do
[1:05:34] these things anymore well if you've got
[1:05:36] a few minutes let me tell you why see
[1:05:42] the people should be able to recognize
[1:05:43] that there is a change taking place you
[1:05:46] don't have to go broadcast to everybody
[1:05:48] of course we have boldness I'm not
[1:05:50] saying that there's anything wrong with
[1:05:52] that but I'm just saying you don't have
[1:05:53] to do that brother Branham says this he
[1:06:01] says this was taken out of the uncertain
[1:06:04] sound he says a men cut every obstacle
[1:06:07] from human beings you know if there's
[1:06:10] resistance in your life cut that
[1:06:12] obstacle out amen that they might be
[1:06:14] connected like in the Garden of Eden man
[1:06:19] as a militant he says you don't believe
[1:06:23] that but he is a man fully surrendered
[1:06:28] to God is omnipotent did not he say in
[1:06:33] mark 11:22 whatsoever things you say and
[1:06:36] don't doubt in your heart it'll come to
[1:06:38] pass and you shall have what you said he
[1:06:41] says what happens when to omnipotence
[1:06:43] meet when God and man comes together to
[1:06:46] omnipotence something's got to shake
[1:06:49] whatsoever you say with that creative
[1:06:51] power of admittance of God knowing that
[1:06:54] he promised it and he said it at his
[1:06:56] word it creates a power that goes out
[1:06:58] yonder and brings things to pass things
[1:07:00] that is not it makes them as though they
[1:07:02] are because - of nipa Tain's have met
[1:07:05] Barry Stan's oh he isn't he wonderful
[1:07:08] so when to omnipotence come something's
[1:07:10] got to take place that switch that light
[1:07:13] switch back there this one over here it
[1:07:15] that it's open until you close it it has
[1:07:19] to match the circuit with if you if I
[1:07:21] was to draw a diagram out it would look
[1:07:23] something like this so that means it's
[1:07:25] an open circuit so when you flip that
[1:07:27] switch what happens is that's gonna come
[1:07:29] down as gonna make contact amen oh one
[1:07:33] of these days he's gonna come down and
[1:07:35] we're gonna make contact we're just
[1:07:36] gonna take off amen praise God
[1:07:40] and then he says this and when you got
[1:07:43] supreme power when Jesus said lay hands
[1:07:46] on the sick they shall recover all what
[1:07:48] could stand in your way and you got
[1:07:50] supreme faith in that being the truth
[1:07:52] you need a supreme God
[1:07:54] they made a supreme promise and a
[1:07:56] supreme result will come amen he said
[1:08:01] that's it
[1:08:02] oh my he also says this and it wasn't so
[1:08:09] from the beginning when God and a
[1:08:11] believer meets there are two omnipotence
[1:08:13] because a man is because a man is a part
[1:08:15] of God are you a part of God this
[1:08:17] morning do you have to believe that you
[1:08:20] are a part of God this morning because
[1:08:21] if you don't believe that then you have
[1:08:23] no relationship there because the man is
[1:08:27] a part of God he is a son of God and
[1:08:30] sisters too and what little he joins
[1:08:33] with and what little he is joins with
[1:08:37] the entire body so you wear a many
[1:08:39] membered Bride you might be one thing
[1:08:41] and you might think of yourself
[1:08:43] something so insignificant so little but
[1:08:45] come together with many more how much
[1:08:47] more power is going to take place amen
[1:08:51] but he says he is the son of God with
[1:08:54] little he is joins with the entire body
[1:08:56] and Jesus said over and 11 to mark 11:22
[1:08:59] saying the same thing he says if you say
[1:09:01] to this mountain be moved and don't
[1:09:03] doubt in your heart see that's the
[1:09:04] problem as we doubt in our heart because
[1:09:06] we have something we're afraid of
[1:09:08] something there's something keeping us
[1:09:10] from that promise down on the inside
[1:09:12] there's something wrong there's
[1:09:14] something saying I don't really believe
[1:09:16] that now that's what we have to get out
[1:09:18] of there we have to put to the side and
[1:09:20] say that I believe that promise I'm
[1:09:22] laying hold on that promise I'm no
[1:09:24] matter what I just heard a song here's a
[1:09:25] little bit ago it's called even if and I
[1:09:28] was just wondering what that song was I
[1:09:30] think it's Mercy Me or Casting Crowns
[1:09:32] I'm not here to promote them or the song
[1:09:34] but I like what he was saying with the
[1:09:37] song he was even saying that being up on
[1:09:42] stage that people have the idea that the
[1:09:46] person up on stage has everything
[1:09:48] together you know you might look at a
[1:09:50] preacher and think man he's got
[1:09:52] everything together why can't we
[1:09:54] like that and this man is a singer
[1:09:57] unfortunately people look at singers and
[1:10:00] they tend to worship them especially if
[1:10:02] there's a successful singer so they
[1:10:04] think they have everything together
[1:10:05] when they have just as many problems as
[1:10:07] you and sometimes a little bit more
[1:10:08] problems so he was saying that if you
[1:10:14] think I have no problems think again
[1:10:16] because there are times that I don't
[1:10:17] want to stand here and sing there I'm
[1:10:21] sure brother Jesse's felt it if if you
[1:10:23] haven't brother forgive me but he
[1:10:26] probably felt that he didn't really want
[1:10:28] to go to church that day he didn't
[1:10:29] really want to go preach that day you
[1:10:31] know I know brother Jim has had those
[1:10:33] struggles I know I've had those
[1:10:34] struggles well I don't want to go preach
[1:10:36] you know I just don't feel like going
[1:10:37] you know my thing is I don't feel I'm
[1:10:40] I'm just not good enough to to go preach
[1:10:43] you know I'm not and I'll never be good
[1:10:46] enough to do it but get the focus off me
[1:10:50] put the focus back on the other fellow
[1:10:52] but through his song I guess his son had
[1:10:55] diabetes since he was like 2 there was
[1:10:59] some type of diabetes so I can I can
[1:11:04] kind of understand what he's talking
[1:11:05] about with with a son getting over like
[1:11:07] 30,000 shots you know because after
[1:11:09] every meal he would have to have a shot
[1:11:11] of insulin but what he was saying
[1:11:15] through that song is even if you don't
[1:11:17] heal me I'm still gonna serve you it's
[1:11:19] not conditional of whether it's
[1:11:21] something that I see or something I
[1:11:23] received I'm not looking for a great
[1:11:25] reward reward on this earth for my
[1:11:27] reward is up in heaven amen so as long
[1:11:29] as I say true and I stay faithful amen
[1:11:33] then we should be able to go on we meet
[1:11:34] those conditions to be able to go what's
[1:11:38] going to hinder us even if he doesn't
[1:11:40] hear you on this earth and that is his
[1:11:42] will that is his will for you to be
[1:11:44] healed but if he doesn't heal you are
[1:11:46] you going to hold it against them
[1:11:47] or are you going to still love him no
[1:11:51] matter what even if he doesn't heal you
[1:11:53] even if he does heal you even if he
[1:11:55] doesn't meet those finances even if he
[1:11:58] does beat those finances it doesn't
[1:11:59] matter what the circumstance that you
[1:12:01] still serve God
[1:12:04] amen going on with what he was saying he
[1:12:14] says be moved and don't doubt in your
[1:12:15] heart but believe what you have said and
[1:12:17] it will come to pass
[1:12:18] believe that what you have said and a
[1:12:20] Christian is so marked that around him
[1:12:23] is an atmosphere now there's an
[1:12:25] atmosphere that we have to create for
[1:12:27] the people you know to just love to be
[1:12:30] in your presence it's it's not an
[1:12:31] atmosphere or selfishness it's not an
[1:12:33] atmosphere of wantonness you know it's
[1:12:37] not an atmosphere of lack but it's an
[1:12:40] atmosphere of love that people so
[1:12:43] desired man I can't wait to get into
[1:12:45] brother amens presence again man I just
[1:12:47] love talking with that brother brother
[1:12:49] bang brother Jesse and brother Jose that
[1:12:52] I can't remember all the sisters name so
[1:12:54] forgive me but creating that atmosphere
[1:12:58] no matter what people do to you if you
[1:13:02] just create that atmosphere of love it's
[1:13:05] gonna draw more people to you now don't
[1:13:09] get that thought in your mind well
[1:13:10] brother Brian does that all the time no
[1:13:12] I don't but I sure would like to and I
[1:13:14] like that song that we came out I want
[1:13:16] to praise them more than what I do I
[1:13:18] want to love them more than what I do
[1:13:19] amen I want to do all those things I
[1:13:22] want to do all the good things more than
[1:13:23] what I do because I seriously lack but
[1:13:26] we need to have that atmosphere that's
[1:13:30] something that we can do amen see if
[1:13:37] your desire I'm sure it's the same as
[1:13:40] mine if you love Jesus you want to be
[1:13:41] pleasing unto him right which is the
[1:13:43] same desire that Jesus had to be
[1:13:46] pleasing to the Father he wanted to be
[1:13:48] about his father's business he wanted to
[1:13:50] fulfill when he was sent to earth for
[1:13:52] men but people won't be able to see that
[1:13:56] that super special force are I want to
[1:14:00] see what that's all about
[1:14:02] well you can't see it you can only see
[1:14:04] the manifestation you can only see
[1:14:06] what's taking place by what's happening
[1:14:18] let's talk about the wind no one knows
[1:14:22] where the wind comes from can anybody
[1:14:25] here tell where the wind come from can
[1:14:26] you tell where it's going you can only
[1:14:28] put a weather vane up there and see what
[1:14:30] direction it's going you could put a I
[1:14:32] can't remember what you call it but it's
[1:14:34] it's similar to a speedometer but it's
[1:14:36] it's uh you could see all fast the wind
[1:14:38] is traveling that's about all you could
[1:14:40] do you could put a windmill up you can
[1:14:42] harness the wind or you can harness the
[1:14:44] power of the wind but you can't really
[1:14:46] harness and control the wind there's
[1:14:48] absolutely nothing you can do for the
[1:14:50] wind they meant so you can just enjoy it
[1:14:55] where it is and respect it where you
[1:14:59] ought to now John three and eight it
[1:15:03] says the wind bloweth where it listeth
[1:15:05] and now here's the sound thereof but
[1:15:08] can't canst not tell whence it cometh
[1:15:11] and whither it goeth and now you are
[1:15:15] likened unto the wind so as every one
[1:15:18] that is born of the Spirit they don't
[1:15:20] understand what you're doing they don't
[1:15:23] understand the concept of why you shun
[1:15:25] the very periods of evil well so what if
[1:15:29] you go out and have a beer or whatever I
[1:15:31] can but I don't want to well that movie
[1:15:37] isn't all that bad you know why do you
[1:15:39] hold yourself back from it why do you
[1:15:41] hold back from letting your ear not know
[1:15:43] why don't you let your kids do this why
[1:15:45] don't you let your kids do that it's
[1:15:49] because we're raising them up in a
[1:15:51] special way that they don't understand
[1:15:54] not every man has that knowledge that
[1:15:56] you have blessed are your ears blessed
[1:15:58] are your eyes that you could see a man
[1:16:01] they don't understand the things that we
[1:16:04] do and we're likened unto the wind they
[1:16:07] can't understand the wind they don't
[1:16:09] know where it comes from they don't know
[1:16:10] where it goes all they see is why are
[1:16:13] you so nitpicky well because I can't
[1:16:17] stay in the smell of cigarettes and I
[1:16:19] can't stay in the foul mouth that you
[1:16:21] have you know well since they asked
[1:16:24] you might as well tell them I'm not
[1:16:25] gonna come out and say things to people
[1:16:27] but if they ask I'm gonna tell them and
[1:16:29] you ought not to be afraid to say
[1:16:31] something either amen have you if
[1:16:35] somebody asks you don't lie about it
[1:16:37] don't be ashamed of the gospel don't
[1:16:40] shun to proclaim the whole counsel of
[1:16:42] God you know I've talked to some guys at
[1:16:51] work and they're not not all of them
[1:16:54] they're not clean that they don't have
[1:16:56] clean mouths but I've mentioned
[1:16:58] something about some other guys we have
[1:17:02] truck drivers that that deliver stuff
[1:17:03] and and I just can't believe the mouth
[1:17:09] that some of these guys that they have
[1:17:12] and under don't get me wrong I used to
[1:17:15] talk that way but I thought I had a
[1:17:18] better vocabulary than that but every
[1:17:20] other word I mean and then they say ya
[1:17:24] know that that even bothers me well if
[1:17:26] it bothers them how bad is that you know
[1:17:29] so but we don't have to
[1:17:32] we're not taken out of the world because
[1:17:35] of things like that but if we can
[1:17:37] interject the love you know not be
[1:17:39] judgmental but if we could have a little
[1:17:41] bit more love to show them what the love
[1:17:43] of Christ is amen but we were all once
[1:17:47] sinners yes amen
[1:17:49] I know I was I was saved by love my love
[1:17:56] of the people because I thought
[1:17:59] everybody was a hypno I thought I
[1:18:01] thought every church was a hypocrite I
[1:18:03] didn't I didn't like going to church I
[1:18:04] grew up in church and I just thought it
[1:18:08] was all hypocrisy but come to find out
[1:18:11] somebody proved me wrong but I didn't
[1:18:13] understand it I just knew something was
[1:18:16] different until I got more and more into
[1:18:18] the Word of God amen then I can
[1:18:21] understand it when I started taking on
[1:18:23] the principles of the word then I
[1:18:25] understood that that men couldn't
[1:18:28] understand I was in the same boat I
[1:18:30] don't understand why they do these
[1:18:31] things you know you know they do it
[1:18:33] behind closed doors not everybody is
[1:18:34] like that
[1:18:36] you know there are some people that have
[1:18:38] integrity in the heart to do the right
[1:18:40] thing even when nobody is looking there
[1:18:42] are some people that have integrity with
[1:18:44] the Holy Spirit that are filled with the
[1:18:46] Holy Spirit that continue to live a
[1:18:47] godly life with no matter what doors are
[1:18:49] closed whether it's home whether it's
[1:18:51] work or whatever it is you ever walk
[1:18:55] into a room and not nobody not know that
[1:18:57] somebody was in there did they find
[1:19:01] yourself do they find you grumbling and
[1:19:04] complaining and and cussing and swearing
[1:19:05] and proclaiming to be a Christian
[1:19:07] oh my say you never know when somebody's
[1:19:12] in and in the room with you I mean
[1:19:16] unless it's in your bedroom but I better
[1:19:19] get off of that one but but you get the
[1:19:21] point is if if you if you didn't know
[1:19:25] that somebody was in the room how do you
[1:19:27] conduct yourself are you ashamed when
[1:19:30] they make their voice heard and then
[1:19:32] their their presence is known do you
[1:19:35] know somebody was in here I shouldn't
[1:19:38] have said that
[1:19:38] I shouldn't have through this I
[1:19:40] shouldn't have thrown that you see what
[1:19:44] I mean how do we conduct ourselves
[1:19:45] behind closed doors amen
[1:19:47] it's wonderful that you put on a front
[1:19:49] on the outside but what's on the inside
[1:19:51] that's that that's what matters they
[1:19:54] meant but Jesus was telling Nicodemus
[1:19:59] that a man must be born again
[1:20:01] in return he asked how can these things
[1:20:04] be see Nicodemus didn't understand
[1:20:06] and Jesus said are you not are you not a
[1:20:08] ruler or a teacher I mean are you not a
[1:20:11] teacher and you don't understand these
[1:20:13] things so everybody has knowledge but
[1:20:17] knowledge puffeth up but it's love that
[1:20:21] edifies Amen when you're able to be
[1:20:25] taught you've got a humbleness of heart
[1:20:28] when you can't be taught anything you
[1:20:30] know everything nobody's going to be
[1:20:33] able to help you with anything you shut
[1:20:36] everybody off
[1:20:40] but being born again as a mystery just
[1:20:43] just like the wind nobody knows where
[1:20:45] the wind comes from nobody knows where
[1:20:47] it's going Amen well one minute the wind
[1:20:51] could be calm as could be the next
[1:20:53] moment it could be tempestuous it could
[1:20:56] be stormy but uh it could be high winds
[1:20:59] now we don't know where it comes from we
[1:21:01] don't know where it goes all we know is
[1:21:03] that it is nobody knows where the Spirit
[1:21:06] of God comes from nobody knows what the
[1:21:08] Spirit of God does but we know that it
[1:21:10] is amen
[1:21:12] oh my one day Moses didn't know what to
[1:21:16] say he didn't know who he didn't know
[1:21:19] how to say who sent him he says what who
[1:21:22] should I tell him to send me and what
[1:21:24] did God say tell them that I am amen
[1:21:28] so we know that he is all because he
[1:21:31] says I am we believe it right that's
[1:21:34] that's not the only reason but you know
[1:21:36] just imagine Moses on that day and he
[1:21:40] just said I am I'm gonna take that to
[1:21:43] the children of Israel I am could you
[1:21:47] imagine
[1:21:48] but all the power that lays in the in
[1:21:51] the words that I am Oh my axe to intuit
[1:21:54] it says and suddenly there came a sound
[1:21:56] from heaven as a as of a rushing mighty
[1:22:00] wind and it filled all the house where
[1:22:02] they were sitting now wouldn't you just
[1:22:05] love to hear something like that and
[1:22:06] then not be a storm outside you just
[1:22:07] hear the the sound of a mighty rushing
[1:22:10] wind now we know what happened on that
[1:22:12] day when that sound of a mighty rushing
[1:22:14] wind came in that it was the presence of
[1:22:15] the Lord and when people heard the sound
[1:22:18] of a mighty rushing wind they didn't
[1:22:20] know what was going on but until they
[1:22:22] were inside and partakers with the wind
[1:22:24] amen oh my
[1:22:27] Moses Exodus 10 and 13 I'll try not to
[1:22:31] be too much longer
[1:22:33] Exodus 10 and 13 it says and Moses
[1:22:36] stretched forth his rod over the land of
[1:22:37] Egypt and the Lord brought an east wind
[1:22:40] upon the land all that day and all that
[1:22:43] night and when it was morning the east
[1:22:45] wind brought the locusts and in verse 19
[1:22:48] of that same chapter says and the Lord
[1:22:50] turned a mighty strong west wind which
[1:22:53] took away the low
[1:22:54] cast them into the Red Sea there remain
[1:22:57] not one locus in all the coasts of Egypt
[1:23:00] now another place here in Exodus 14 and
[1:23:03] 21 it says and Moses stretched out his
[1:23:06] hand over the sea and the Lord caused
[1:23:08] the sea to go back by a strong east wind
[1:23:11] all that night and made the sea dry land
[1:23:15] and the waters were divided so we see
[1:23:17] who controls the wind because the Lord
[1:23:19] sent an east wind and he sent a west
[1:23:21] wind and it brought locusts and it took
[1:23:23] locusts away in a separated water and
[1:23:26] Adam made it as dry ground for the
[1:23:27] children of Israel walk on all right so
[1:23:31] there's power in the wind is that right
[1:23:33] God has remained the same he had
[1:23:35] controlled the wind in the Old Testament
[1:23:37] bringing in east and west wind he also
[1:23:39] had control of the wind in the New
[1:23:41] Testament when Jesus came and said peace
[1:23:44] be still so we know the source of the
[1:23:47] wind is God is that right everything
[1:23:49] that was made was made by him so he is
[1:23:52] the controller of the wind not man man
[1:23:54] can't control wind they wish they could
[1:23:56] because they would use it for evil
[1:23:57] wouldn't it God couldn't trust man or
[1:24:00] the wind in control of man look what
[1:24:02] look what man can control now and it's
[1:24:05] not of good power without character is
[1:24:10] satanic is that right no wonder he
[1:24:12] doesn't give us the power of these
[1:24:13] things because of man's selfish desire
[1:24:16] that's all they have is a selfish desire
[1:24:19] so fulfilling who could be on top who
[1:24:21] can who can have more power than the
[1:24:23] other see knowledge puffeth up but it's
[1:24:26] love that edifies love is what unifies
[1:24:29] love is what draws us together love is
[1:24:32] what's going to save people it's not how
[1:24:34] much you know it's not how many
[1:24:36] scriptures you can quote it's not how
[1:24:38] many message quotes you could quote it's
[1:24:40] not how much knowledge you have in the
[1:24:42] message and you know what brother Peter
[1:24:43] said here you know what brother brainer
[1:24:44] said there is it still okay to say that
[1:24:47] brother brain have said see knowledge
[1:24:49] puffeth up knowledge will take you so
[1:24:52] far from God it'll disconnect you from
[1:24:56] the power source
[1:24:57] oh my you just would be another faucet
[1:25:01] sitting there at home depot or lowes
[1:25:06] now in first Kings 19 verse 11 it says
[1:25:09] and he said go forth and stand upon the
[1:25:12] mountain before the Lord and behold the
[1:25:14] Lord passed by and a great and strong
[1:25:16] wind rent the mountains and breaking
[1:25:18] pieces the rocks before the Lord their
[1:25:20] excuse me yes before the Lord but the
[1:25:24] Lord was not in the wind see the wind
[1:25:27] could be powerful but the Lord was not
[1:25:28] in it at that time
[1:25:29] and after the wind an earthquake
[1:25:31] something else that was powerful but the
[1:25:33] Lord was not in the earthquake and after
[1:25:36] the earthquake of fire but the Lord was
[1:25:38] not in the fire and after the fire a
[1:25:41] still small voice oh how much there's
[1:25:48] power in a still small voice could you
[1:25:50] just think for a moment of how many
[1:25:52] times I how many situations were changed
[1:25:54] how many how many circumstances were
[1:25:56] changed of somebody in life and death
[1:25:58] all because they were obedient to the
[1:26:00] still small voice there's power in the
[1:26:05] still small voice it's something not all
[1:26:07] men had that knowledge of that still
[1:26:09] small boys how many people here can
[1:26:11] recognize when that still small boy
[1:26:13] speaks because sometimes it's hard to
[1:26:15] differentiate between the voice in your
[1:26:17] head and the still small voice of God
[1:26:19] but there's a time that we have to
[1:26:21] exercise that discernment to know
[1:26:23] whether it's the voice of God or not you
[1:26:27] got to check the motive you got to check
[1:26:28] the desire you got to check it with the
[1:26:30] word you got a check you to visit is it
[1:26:32] a righteous thing or not so just because
[1:26:34] there's a voice there it doesn't always
[1:26:35] mean that it's of God well I feel letter
[1:26:38] the Lord to go do this and knowing that
[1:26:40] it's contrary to his word you should
[1:26:42] know right then that is not the voice of
[1:26:44] God speaking they're still powering the
[1:26:47] still small voice when it's a genuine
[1:26:49] voice is God speaking there's been many
[1:26:52] demented men on that have dementia that
[1:26:54] said that they were led by God to go
[1:26:56] commit a horrendous acts of murder what
[1:27:01] God told me to go do this well I'm not
[1:27:04] sure what voice spoke in their head I'd
[1:27:06] be daring that not to say that it wasn't
[1:27:08] God but I have a hard time believing
[1:27:11] that it would be God for God to send
[1:27:13] somebody off in the New Testament age
[1:27:15] I'm not saying the Old Testament
[1:27:17] something in the New Testament I would
[1:27:19] have a hard
[1:27:20] I'm thinking that believing that God
[1:27:22] sent somebody to do some horrendous acts
[1:27:24] you know but we know that Judas was it
[1:27:28] was ordered of the Lord did not Jesus
[1:27:30] say go and do what you were called to do
[1:27:33] go do what you're supposed to do see the
[1:27:37] demons even have their place and they
[1:27:38] have to obey Him even when he speaks hey
[1:27:41] man
[1:27:41] [Music]
[1:27:43] but many magnificent powerful things
[1:27:45] have happened because of the obedience
[1:27:47] of the still small voice amen
[1:27:50] something where people on the outside
[1:27:53] people in the world have no
[1:27:54] understanding of how powerful a still
[1:27:57] small voice would be the obedience of a
[1:28:01] still small voice of the still small
[1:28:04] boys first John 4 verse 1 it says
[1:28:12] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[1:28:16] the spirits whether they're of God
[1:28:19] because many false prophets are gone out
[1:28:21] into the world hereby know ye the Spirit
[1:28:24] of God every spirit that confesseth that
[1:28:27] Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of
[1:28:29] God and every spirit that confesseth not
[1:28:32] that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
[1:28:34] is not of God that's a simple
[1:28:36] discernment isn't sometimes it gets a
[1:28:38] little bit more complicated than where
[1:28:40] it's not so cut and dry but that's where
[1:28:42] we have to have our discernment
[1:28:43] exercised yes we actually have to
[1:28:47] exercise on the Word of God and it's a
[1:28:49] free membership to this gym to walk this
[1:28:51] to walk in here and then to exercise it
[1:28:54] hey man you could afford it all it takes
[1:28:57] is a little bit of time redeeming the
[1:28:59] time is that right praise God
[1:29:02] and every spirit that confesseth not
[1:29:05] Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is
[1:29:07] not of God and this is the spirit of
[1:29:09] Antichrist
[1:29:09] wherever you have heard that it should
[1:29:12] come and even now already is it in this
[1:29:15] world in the world so we know that it's
[1:29:17] here and we are here to contend with it
[1:29:19] that's the battle that we have that's
[1:29:22] one of the many battles that we have
[1:29:27] let's take for instance
[1:29:29] side by side here's another example you
[1:29:32] put side by side a glass of water glass
[1:29:35] of Hydra hydrochloric acid glass of
[1:29:40] sulfuric acid now each of those outside
[1:29:44] properties of what you see of what it is
[1:29:48] on the outside it all looks the same it
[1:29:52] would be so close that it would deceive
[1:29:54] the elect if it were possible Amen but
[1:29:59] glass of water glass of hydrochloric
[1:30:01] acid glass of sulfuric acid
[1:30:05] they all look clear they're all
[1:30:09] transparent they don't you put some ice
[1:30:12] in there and might they all look
[1:30:13] refreshing oh if I could have a drink of
[1:30:16] that water because I'm about the thirst
[1:30:18] of death maybe I will all look the same
[1:30:29] on the outside but it's what's on the
[1:30:31] inside what's on the inside the chemical
[1:30:34] makeup on the inside of each one of them
[1:30:37] is different the hydrochloric acid as
[1:30:40] you can guess from part of the name
[1:30:42] hydro hydrochloric is from water but
[1:30:46] water in its sense and in the man who
[1:30:51] just left me I get the the pH of it it
[1:30:53] has to be balanced because if you go too
[1:30:56] far one way it's going to be too much of
[1:30:59] a base that's going to be too caustic
[1:31:00] it's going to be too much soda and if
[1:31:03] you go too far the other way is we
[1:31:05] couldn't gonna become an acid so right
[1:31:10] in the middle is that pure word right in
[1:31:15] the middle is that pureness that
[1:31:17] holiness that stays right with that Amen
[1:31:19] you go too far it's going to go it's
[1:31:22] going to be acidic you go too far it's
[1:31:24] going to melt everything around it it's
[1:31:26] good it nobody wants to be around that
[1:31:28] one because it dissolves everybody right
[1:31:31] in the middle you go too far it's going
[1:31:33] to be too caustic it's going to be too
[1:31:35] much soda in it it just sits there and
[1:31:37] does nothing
[1:31:41] you drink either one um it's not gonna
[1:31:43] be good for you but right in the middle
[1:31:47] there's and it's either seven I think is
[1:31:50] a sweet spot for the pH of water it's
[1:31:52] like between six and a half seven and a
[1:31:54] half somewhere around there those that
[1:31:56] are more scholarly than me could could
[1:31:58] tell me if I'm wrong or not so it's the
[1:32:01] inside makeup of each one of those water
[1:32:04] and acid looks the same on the outside
[1:32:07] might look refreshing but it's what's on
[1:32:09] the inside that really matters hey man
[1:32:13] one has life the other one has death
[1:32:16] amen which one do you say but you can't
[1:32:20] see that life in that water now can you
[1:32:22] but you know that there's our because it
[1:32:24] gives other things life when it takes of
[1:32:27] that water that refreshing water it
[1:32:29] brings forth life plants needed humans
[1:32:32] need animals needed it brings forth life
[1:32:35] without it you will die but you can't
[1:32:43] see the life but you know it's there you
[1:32:47] see the change that life is making
[1:32:48] whether it be plants and animals or
[1:32:50] humans you can see you see that it when
[1:32:52] a baby is born you see that there is
[1:32:54] life because it grows it changes you see
[1:32:59] a sapling is you see from a seed it
[1:33:01] grows you know that there's life but you
[1:33:03] can't see the life on the inside you
[1:33:06] just know that it's there you can't see
[1:33:08] God but you know that he's there
[1:33:10] you know the manifestation is there
[1:33:12] we're on the inside life happens on the
[1:33:16] inside life doesn't happen on the
[1:33:18] outside life happens on the inside but
[1:33:24] you can't see it but there is something
[1:33:27] that continues to develop we can't see
[1:33:31] God but we know when he is done and a
[1:33:33] believer know that the changes have
[1:33:35] taken place at a believer you know
[1:33:36] something has happened now a tree under
[1:33:39] a burden will continue to grow and it
[1:33:41] will grow crooked now sometimes when a
[1:33:43] believer gets off some things get a
[1:33:46] little harder or when things go awry it
[1:33:50] doesn't it might look like that they're
[1:33:53] not a believer but
[1:33:54] say patch things up and they tap back
[1:33:56] into the source it'll grow straight
[1:33:58] again that believer will grow again like
[1:34:01] I said earlier with with the faucet that
[1:34:03] you have to go back when you find out
[1:34:05] that there's no power there you have to
[1:34:07] go back to the source and tap back into
[1:34:09] it amen when you take the burdens off it
[1:34:17] starts to grow straight again none amen
[1:34:21] better go in close everybody still good
[1:34:23] with me this morning lady had a
[1:34:31] baby over there this is brother branham
[1:34:33] this is out of Abraham in 1960 lost my
[1:34:40] lid flip my lid this morning a lady had
[1:34:47] his face baby over there the
[1:34:49] other night in an emergency room and I
[1:34:51] prayed for the little fellow and I told
[1:34:53] her I said like a stalk of corn coming
[1:34:55] up if nothing bothers it it'll produce a
[1:34:58] stalk of corn good and straight in a
[1:35:00] good ear if a vine wraps around it a
[1:35:02] clog lays over it it sticks a no crook
[1:35:05] well that's the way or anything
[1:35:08] else is there's something hindered it
[1:35:10] sometimes we have hindrances in our
[1:35:12] lives is that right well if you can move
[1:35:15] the the hindrance the thing will grow
[1:35:18] straight now a lot of people say why
[1:35:21] don't see any difference now excuse me
[1:35:24] that don't have anything to do with it
[1:35:26] not a thing excuse me pull the cloud off
[1:35:30] the corn it don't straighten up right
[1:35:32] now just give it a chance laying in the
[1:35:34] warm Sun so you can't cut people off
[1:35:36] just just because of the way that they
[1:35:38] look you know you can't count them as as
[1:35:40] a child of hell just because of their
[1:35:45] appearance now sometimes we do that man
[1:35:47] can you believe that person looks like
[1:35:49] that sometimes we get judgmental like
[1:35:51] that how can you have somebody who looks
[1:35:52] like that you know just look like they
[1:35:56] got in a fight with a stapler they got
[1:35:57] stuff all over him you know so sometimes
[1:36:01] we get judgmental why I don't want to be
[1:36:02] in near that person and they could be a
[1:36:04] sweet person all they need to hear is
[1:36:05] the love hear the word of God
[1:36:07] just need to experience the love of God
[1:36:09] one time they probably met church with
[1:36:11] with a lot of hypocrisy and then that's
[1:36:14] probably why they don't like church but
[1:36:16] talk to him you show him the real love
[1:36:17] of God amen
[1:36:18] as much as within you I better start in
[1:36:25] that paragraph the hood now a lot of
[1:36:26] people say well I don't see any
[1:36:28] difference now that don't have anything
[1:36:29] to do with it not a thing
[1:36:31] pull the Claud off off the corn and
[1:36:33] don't straighten up right now just give
[1:36:34] it a chance
[1:36:34] laying in the warm Sun the rain watch it
[1:36:37] comes right out straight so will you do
[1:36:40] the same thing you just believe it it's
[1:36:42] God 1 all life but that life is botany
[1:36:46] life which comes forth by the S UN but
[1:36:48] eternal life comes through the S Oh n is
[1:36:51] that right the Son of God tell you what
[1:36:56] you people could do pour concrete up and
[1:36:59] down on your sidewalk put the grass down
[1:37:01] down there where there's where there's
[1:37:04] the thickest of your grass next spring
[1:37:07] right along the edge of that sidewalk
[1:37:09] why it's that life in there you can't
[1:37:11] hide life how many times have you
[1:37:14] cleaned an area out and you put gravel
[1:37:15] down you even put the black plastic down
[1:37:18] we we went we went away one time and we
[1:37:21] had this garden they we put this black
[1:37:23] stuff on top of the garden you know it
[1:37:25] was to kill the weeds well lo and behold
[1:37:27] when we came back we were gone for a
[1:37:29] week here those weeds they pushed all
[1:37:31] that black stuff up so it was like
[1:37:34] knee-high weeds so you can't hide life
[1:37:36] that life is gonna grow oh my see when
[1:37:41] the Sun begins to warm that concrete
[1:37:43] that little life will grow right on out
[1:37:45] right on out stick his head up and
[1:37:48] praise God that's right you can't hide
[1:37:50] it that those times that you you clean
[1:37:53] an area out you put gravel in there you
[1:37:54] put that black plastic down lo and
[1:37:56] behold that grass is going to make
[1:37:57] through because you can't hold life back
[1:38:00] there are time there many times
[1:38:02] throughout the ages they tried to squash
[1:38:04] the Word of God they tried to kill it
[1:38:05] they tried to maim it they tried to hide
[1:38:07] it they tried to burn it and they
[1:38:08] couldn't do it because he can't hide
[1:38:10] life God is life he is the source of
[1:38:13] life he is the one who quit the life in
[1:38:15] us and we will live for him until that
[1:38:17] life goes out
[1:38:19] Amen use this as you better come but
[1:38:25] then he says this but he that
[1:38:27] understandeth he that knows his place in
[1:38:31] this hour he that heareth my word and
[1:38:33] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:38:34] present tense eternal life shall not
[1:38:37] come into the judgment but has already
[1:38:40] passed from death unto life then when
[1:38:42] this new eternal life dwells in you it
[1:38:44] is the potential or the earnestness of
[1:38:46] you being quickened from mortal to
[1:38:48] immortality oh my let me say that again
[1:38:53] when this spirit this is what he says he
[1:38:56] says let me say that again when the
[1:38:57] Spirit has found you the individual and
[1:39:00] has come upon you it's the potential of
[1:39:03] your eternal inheritance that God
[1:39:05] thought of you and made for you before
[1:39:07] the foundation of the world that is your
[1:39:10] potential do you recognize your
[1:39:12] potential this morning it's more than
[1:39:14] just a pure warmer it's more than just
[1:39:15] going to work and saying I believe God
[1:39:17] it's more than that but there's an
[1:39:19] inheritance of eternal glory life excuse
[1:39:25] me like if you ask me for an oak tree
[1:39:26] and I give you an acorn now the life for
[1:39:29] the oak tree is in the Acorn now but you
[1:39:31] have to wait until it grows up
[1:39:33] so do we when you receive the Holy
[1:39:36] Spirit of God it's God's potential
[1:39:38] waiting upon you that's already
[1:39:40] recognized you and you're sealed by the
[1:39:43] spirit of promise of God into the body
[1:39:45] of Christ when God looked down at
[1:39:47] Calvary and seen Jesus dying he died for
[1:39:50] his bride the body which is the word
[1:39:52] church the church that believes the Word
[1:39:54] of God for the age whether its feet
[1:39:57] whether its body head or wherever it is
[1:40:00] Christ was bleeding and dying and God
[1:40:02] looking upon him saw his resurrection in
[1:40:05] the church raised with him on Easter see
[1:40:08] as I was saying earlier that to him you
[1:40:11] were an impotent as much as God as if
[1:40:12] nificent when you were in him for if
[1:40:15] you're in him and he's in you then
[1:40:16] you're part of him you were a son you
[1:40:18] were a daughter of God amen so that's
[1:40:20] where you live this morning if you have
[1:40:22] taken God upon his promises you believe
[1:40:25] God you you're born again that's what
[1:40:27] you haven't got I know I'm talking to
[1:40:29] believers I know there are some I don't
[1:40:30] know everybody here but
[1:40:32] if you could just see in this hour if
[1:40:34] you're tapped into the source of
[1:40:35] potential that you have Amen now he says
[1:40:42] now notice it's the earnest or the
[1:40:44] potential the quickening power of your
[1:40:47] resurrection when you receive the Holy
[1:40:49] Spirit is then dwelling in you the
[1:40:51] potential of it notice you are now on
[1:40:55] your way growing to the full
[1:40:56] resurrection no tree just comes up
[1:40:59] overnight it's got to grow as we grow in
[1:41:01] the Grace and knowledge of God you were
[1:41:03] baptized into the Holy Spirit
[1:41:05] now as the Pentecostal church baptized
[1:41:08] into the Holy Spirit it began growing
[1:41:10] lines' died they was pruning them off
[1:41:12] see soon do you take off the things that
[1:41:14] are hindering you the things that are
[1:41:16] sucking life away you have got to cut it
[1:41:18] off you cannot be friends with the world
[1:41:20] if it's sucking the life of God out of
[1:41:22] you if it's taking your time away cut it
[1:41:24] off you've got to prune it in order for
[1:41:26] it to grow amen but the tree is still
[1:41:37] growing it's still going on because it's
[1:41:40] got to come to the resurrection they're
[1:41:42] led by the spirit to quicken the word to
[1:41:44] you whose believers the word keeps
[1:41:47] quickening as you come to the first limb
[1:41:49] the second limb the third limb on up it
[1:41:51] just keeps quickening the Spirit of God
[1:41:53] keeps quickening you now catch this now
[1:41:55] look now the Bible didn't say these
[1:41:58] signs will follow William Branham oh oh
[1:42:02] this is brother branham's own words he
[1:42:05] said the Bible didn't say these signs
[1:42:07] will follow William Branham it didn't
[1:42:09] say it'll follow Oral Roberts only it
[1:42:12] didn't say it would follow brother cop
[1:42:14] or somebody or Jesse Smith or Brian
[1:42:16] Hawkins it didn't say that he said these
[1:42:18] signs shall follow them plural that
[1:42:21] belief if they lay their hands on the
[1:42:23] sick they shall recover it's that power
[1:42:26] of God that's in you that brings a life
[1:42:28] to the person you got your hands on of
[1:42:31] the life-giving source of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:33] so it's the the Lord working through you
[1:42:36] when you believe on him how much oh my
[1:42:39] goodness it's just channeled to that
[1:42:40] person that you're laying your hands on
[1:42:42] a
[1:42:42] and it's with faith them you got a cast
[1:42:45] out on all that doubt hey man I'm not
[1:42:48] gonna read the rest that he has there I
[1:42:52] just want to share with you this song
[1:42:55] everybody I'm sure knows it it's called
[1:42:57] I claim the blood it says I have a
[1:43:00] source of strength when I am weak that
[1:43:03] takes me through when life is pressing
[1:43:05] me I have a source of power from above
[1:43:08] is that right I'm covered over by a
[1:43:11] shield of love then the course goes on I
[1:43:15] claim the blood that Jesus shed on
[1:43:19] Calvary those precious blood stains were
[1:43:21] made there just for me for all my sin my
[1:43:25] sickness in my pain when I need healing
[1:43:27] I claim those precious bloodstains are
[1:43:31] you in that condition do you find
[1:43:33] yourself calling out for the blood of
[1:43:35] Christ amen
[1:43:36] I do not know how others make it through
[1:43:39] and I can relate cuz I don't know how
[1:43:42] other people make it through who never
[1:43:46] go to Calvary as I do because when I
[1:43:49] can't make it through I can't help but I
[1:43:51] have to go to Calvary because that's my
[1:43:53] source of strength I have to go to
[1:43:56] Calvary for that's where I was born
[1:43:59] again I have to go to Calvary that's
[1:44:03] where I received life and then it says
[1:44:05] for there the healing cleansing stream
[1:44:08] still flows with peace that only his
[1:44:12] redeemed
[1:44:13] can know not every man has this
[1:44:16] knowledge but blessed are you to have
[1:44:19] that knowledge and blessed are you that
[1:44:22] you continue on with love because God is
[1:44:25] love you receive God and you could
[1:44:27] portray God you can manifest God you can
[1:44:29] manifest left
[1:44:30] love and again it's not your works but
[1:44:33] it's his works as we read in the
[1:44:34] beginning it's not our light
[1:44:37] he says you shine your light upon among
[1:44:40] men but your light is his light because
[1:44:42] you're reflecting his light and you're
[1:44:45] doing the works of the Father it's not
[1:44:47] your works but it's his works and what
[1:44:49] does it do it glorifies the father
[1:44:52] amen I stand to our feet bar has this
[1:44:56] if you play that song I claim why most
[1:45:03] presses a fountain the giver of life the
[1:45:08] giver of every good gift other we just
[1:45:15] thank you for this word that you've
[1:45:17] given us this morning Oh God and truly
[1:45:20] without you we can do nothing and as we
[1:45:23] talked about the faucet and the
[1:45:26] electrical and the different things that
[1:45:28] we've talked about for without you we
[1:45:30] can do nothing Oh God and for without us
[1:45:33] those things that we spoke of they could
[1:45:36] do nothing without us and Lord may be
[1:45:40] not our selfish works but maybe the
[1:45:42] works of the Father that we go and do
[1:45:44] that would glorify you Father and Lord
[1:45:47] forgive us of every sin every iniquity
[1:45:49] any hindrance that would be in our life
[1:45:51] and our relationship with you Lord if
[1:45:53] there's something in our lives lord help
[1:45:55] us to go back and to make that thing
[1:45:57] right that we can reconnect that we can
