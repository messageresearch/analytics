[41:10] chapter to start at verse 14 I do look
[41:17] at part 8 of the book of Ephesians by
[41:20] God's grace so this week we finished the
[41:23] Sardis Church age I think that was the
[41:25] end on Sunday these how I'm feeling
[41:27] right now and this week I listen to the
[41:29] Philadelphia Church age up to detailed
[41:31] notes on it the sermon so now I got to
[41:33] go read the book so I have another book
[41:35] in years I can't preach at Philadelphia
[41:37] Church Jason tonight probably Sunday but
[41:39] I got the whole sermon listen to and
[41:41] listen to it diligently and took all the
[41:43] notes this weekend so we'll try to begin
[41:46] preach on that Lord willing on Sunday by
[41:48] God's grace but let's go to fees chapter
[41:50] 2 verse 14 I like to look at part eight
[41:52] tonight by God's grace the book of
[41:56] Ephesians I would like to start at verse
[41:59] 14 but we preach on verses 14 and 15
[42:04] last time and so I want to spend a
[42:06] little more time on verses 16 to the end
[42:09] and will probably begin chapter 3
[42:11] tonight as well by God's grace for there
[42:17] say amen I'll read 14 15 16 then we'll
[42:24] all read 17 and 18 about that by God's
[42:26] grace I'll read 14 15 16 we can all read
[42:29] 17 and 18 verse 14 says for he is our
[42:32] peace
[42:33] who has made both one and hath broken
[42:37] down the middle wall partition between
[42:39] us having abolished in his flesh the
[42:42] enmity even the law of Commandments
[42:47] contained in ordinances for to make in
[42:49] himself of Twain one new man so making
[42:53] peace
[42:54] so now Jew and Gentile are not two
[42:57] separate men now there are one man there
[42:59] one body verse 16 and that he might
[43:06] reconcile both unto God in one body by
[43:08] the cross having slain the enmity
[43:11] thereby now let's read 17 on three one
[43:15] two three and came and preached peace to
[43:18] you which were afar off and to them that
[43:21] were not let's read 18 for through him
[43:24] we both have access by one spirit unto
[43:27] the father let's have a word of Prayer
[43:30] if you would just bow your heads here if
[43:32] you have a need on your heart just make
[43:33] a known unto God by raising your hand
[43:35] how many father you see our hands Lord
[43:37] you Lord you heard all these requests
[43:39] that we prayed for here tonight many
[43:41] many requests we know Lord and we're
[43:45] confident that you could meet every need
[43:46] o God we thank you in the past how
[43:48] you've met different prayer requests
[43:50] answered prayers given us testimonies
[43:53] sometimes you answer right away
[43:55] other times Lord you strengthen our
[43:58] faith through trials and you raise our
[43:59] faith by waiting upon the Lord Lord you
[44:04] told us in patience we actually possess
[44:07] our souls we actually grab a hold of
[44:09] that eternal life as we wait upon you

[44:15] waiting for you Lord the prophet teaches
[44:17] in the church age book so father we're
[44:20] waiting on you tonight Lord God and
[44:22] we're waiting only for you so father
[44:25] take these words we've read in the book
[44:26] of Ephesians quicken them to our hearts
[44:28] Lord God I just pray you teach us give
[44:31] us the wisdom and understanding and
[44:32] revelation we have need of here tonight
[44:34] Lord God as your prophet said these are
[44:37] teachings that evangelist can't do Lord
[44:39] God this is specifically for the
[44:42] teaching and Pastoral Ministries so Lord
[44:44] feed your children sheep food here
[44:46] tonight
[44:47] the Word of God we love you Lord we'd
[44:50] ever need in Jesus Christ name
[44:52] everybody said amen god bless you being
[44:54] seated praise God look at the word of
[45:05] the Lord here tonight God's grace now
[45:08] how you can switch over when you're
[45:10] ready
[45:11] it's good to see our brother amen I've
[45:12] always been working a lot let's give him
[45:14] a round thought thank God so thankful
[45:18] you know tonight offer work praise the
[45:21] Lord Amen thankful for that and just
[45:24] like when anybody misses you know we
[45:25] just longed to see them you know we
[45:27] haven't seen Kevin Murray for a couple
[45:28] of weeks but we prayed for them and
[45:31] we're thankful you know when the Saints
[45:33] make it to the house of the Lord praise
[45:36] God many times that go through battles
[45:37] but we're more than conquerors amen more
[45:40] than conquerors in Christ Jesus so let's
[45:42] look at these here I got a few thoughts
[45:44] here and I just want to refresh your
[45:48] thinking you know we're looking at the
[45:50] book of Ephesians remember there's three
[45:52] themes in Ephesians the first theme is
[45:55] the believers exalted position in Christ
[45:57] and you see that in chapter one and it
[46:03] goes you know from chapter one verse one
[46:06] all the way to the end of chapter one
[46:10] and then chapter two it starts talking
[46:15] about the second theme which is the one
[46:18] body of Christ both Jew and Gentile and
[46:22] that's what we're on right now we're
[46:24] still on the second theme in the book of
[46:26] Ephesians we get in the chat once
[46:30] chapter four verse one hits then you
[46:32] start looking at the walk of the
[46:33] believer and the warfare the believer
[46:36] amen I'm grateful to be walking as a
[46:39] Christian today praise God and I'm glad
[46:42] I can be a part of the warfare that the
[46:45] believer goes through recently a
[46:48] recently this week I got another
[46:49] testimony from the online YouTube videos
[46:52] I think I pray for somebody and God
[46:54] answered their prayer there on the video
[46:55] so we appreciate the testimonies and
[46:57] church says that happens all of us right
[46:59] you know we don't
[47:00] always hear about it but we are kings
[47:03] and priests unto God and as we said were
[47:06] we are no more special than anybody else
[47:08] but we do have a special calling our
[47:13] calling is a holy calling we all know
[47:17] there's wise and foolish virgins the
[47:19] wise virgin has a holy high calling
[47:22] they're not any better because we're
[47:24] both saved by grace can you say men in
[47:27] fact I was reading this week in
[47:28] Galatians and Paul said o foolish
[47:30] Galatians who hath bewitched you to be
[47:33] so far removed from grace he said did
[47:36] you receive the spirit by the works of
[47:38] the law or the hearing of faith how'd
[47:41] you get the Holy Ghost you heard the
[47:42] word you believed it Ava had you got
[47:45] justify sanctified filled with the Holy
[47:46] Ghost through faith you just believed it
[47:49] right and it went to work in your life
[47:50] it wasn't just a checklist of look what
[47:53] I've done look what I've done you didn't
[47:55] earn it that way love led you to obey
[47:58] all those doctrines all the
[48:00] justification sanctification love leads
[48:02] you to these things and it was just by
[48:04] hearing it and just being excited about
[48:06] it and God which excitement just another
[48:09] word for inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[48:10] anointed because you won't find the word
[48:12] I'm excited about Christ which you'll
[48:14] find I'm anointed by Christ that's what
[48:16] you'll find in the scripture the
[48:18] anointing of the Holy Spirit so that's
[48:21] what we have by God's grace that's how
[48:24] that's the themes we're looking at here
[48:27] through the book of Ephesians now as I
[48:29] said in Chapter I'm sorry in part 7 of
[48:32] this series we looked at verses 14 and
[48:34] 15 again at the middle wall perdition
[48:36] how it's been broken down and God has
[48:40] made peace between Jew and Gentile now I
[48:43] want to read a few scriptures let's look
[48:46] at verse 16 that he might reconcile both
[48:50] unto God in one body by the cross having
[48:53] slain the enmity thereby so the cross
[49:00] destroyed the hatred that was against
[49:02] the believer the cross destroyed that so
[49:05] let's look at a few scriptures that
[49:06] prove that go to Romans 6:6 we'll start
[49:11] there Romans 6:6 I've got some numerous
[49:12] scriptures here
[49:14] I want to show you how the cross slough
[49:17] or killed the hatred against us the
[49:22] cross did that because I remember I read
[49:25] that I thought my god the cross slaying
[49:27] the end of the cross slay the entity and
[49:29] I just want to show some scriptures here
[49:31] that encouraged us by God's grace Romans
[49:35] 6:6 okay can I have a reader for that
[49:40] when we like to read Malachi and we'll
[49:42] go to Adam Malachi Romans 6:6 and then
[49:44] we have Adam after that amen so how did
[49:54] the cross slay the hatred against you
[49:56] well it actually slew the old man that
[49:59] you once were right if the Bible said we
[50:04] were crucified with him why cuz we were
[50:06] in the plan of God we are in the mind of
[50:09] God praise the Lord Jesus looked ahead
[50:12] for the joy that was set before him he
[50:14] died for all of us all of our sins were
[50:16] placed upon him and the Bible said your
[50:18] old man was crucified with him that old
[50:22] brother Jesse I used to be or wouldn't
[50:24] say brother the old sinner Jesse I used
[50:25] to be he died on Calvary is that right
[50:28] none of the Bible said it was crucified
[50:30] with him hey man so my old nature died
[50:34] there I just came to recognize it in
[50:36] 1999 Amen although I was born in 1980 so
[50:40] 19 years later I recognized my old man
[50:42] was already dead he already got
[50:43] crucified back there the cross slew the
[50:47] hatred against me because the cross took
[50:50] all the old man he killed the old man
[50:51] Amen that's where the old man died on
[50:53] the cross is that true Romans 8:3 my
[50:58] brother Adam want to read Romans 8:3 for
[51:00] us a men so Christ condemned sin in his
[51:18] flesh so Jesus judges sin and said
[51:21] you're paid for you can't have you can't
[51:25] have any authority over a brother
[51:28] Jessie anymore right now you put
[51:29] yourself in there it's condemned I
[51:31] condemn you Satan right you had all
[51:33] these charges against the people I
[51:36] condemn you those charges are paid for
[51:39] how did he do it in his flesh hallelujah
[51:42] he condemned sin in his flesh Jesus
[51:45] broke sins power by his holy flesh his
[51:50] holy life the fact that he lived pure
[51:53] faith that we could be pure because we
[51:56] were in him amen we're in his mind we're
[51:58] in the plan of God amen because all the
[52:01] sin of the whole world was placed upon
[52:03] Christ amen now let's go to Colossians
[52:06] 2:14 did I see a new hand that one to
[52:10] read Colossians 2:14 anybody wanna read
[52:12] sister Bo thank you Colossians 2:14 this
[52:16] has always been one of my favorite
[52:17] scriptures about the cross hey
[52:19] Colossians 2 whenever you're ready
[52:20] sister Colossians 2:14 amen so what did
[52:34] God do with all the handwriting that was
[52:36] against us the Bible said he nailed it
[52:39] to the cross
[52:40] it was put on the cross that's how the
[52:42] cross slew the hatred against us cuz
[52:45] what hey what hey 'tried was against us
[52:47] all the condemnation that was against us
[52:49] that was written on those handwriting of
[52:51] Ordinances that we failed to we failed
[52:54] to live up to but Jesus the Bible said
[52:56] God nailed them to Jesus's cross you
[52:58] didn't see it but that whole list
[53:00] against us was nailed to the cross
[53:01] that's always one of my favorite
[53:03] scriptures and he blotted it out so it's
[53:05] no longer there so the devil can't say
[53:08] brother amen there's a big long list
[53:09] against you you can't say that because
[53:11] it's already been nailed to the cross
[53:13] amen
[53:14] he can't hold that it was already taken
[53:16] on the cross Jesus already paid for that
[53:19] there's no kind of nation to them that
[53:21] are in Christ Jesus amen
[53:22] who can lay any charge to God's elect
[53:25] because the charge that was against us
[53:27] was already placed on the cross
[53:28] hallelujah there's no charge against the
[53:32] believer tonight hallelujah in the last
[53:34] one this is one of my favorite ones too
[53:35] Hebrews 2:14 do you have a different
[53:37] reader like to read that one tonight
[53:39] Hebrews 2:14 with Amen
[53:42] all right thank you the Liddy you'll be
[53:43] next up for that Hebrews 2:14 Hebrews
[53:48] 2:14 soberly amen whenever you're ready
[53:58] [Music]
[54:02] amen
[54:03] so Jesus destroyed Satan his influence
[54:08] and his power of death in other words
[54:12] when we die Satan can't grab ahold us
[54:14] and drag us down to the regions of the
[54:17] Lost anymore
[54:18] right now of course we know there was
[54:20] Abraham's bosom but that power of death
[54:22] has been broken the Bible says that and
[54:24] Jesus destroyed that means destroyed his
[54:27] influence
[54:28] so Satan can no longer influence us
[54:31] right if we live by the word if we walk
[54:34] in the spirit who's gonna make you who's
[54:36] gonna make you cuss and watch a dirty
[54:38] movie nobody because you've got power to
[54:40] overcome that you see like he his
[54:43] influence has been destroyed today at
[54:46] the meeting everybody's laughing about
[54:47] getting drunk and laughing about all
[54:50] kinds of evil sex acts and I just stand
[54:52] there and I just stare at the paper and
[54:53] I just say God have mercy on this people
[54:55] they're all laughing and looking around
[54:56] and I'm just I'm just bird and it just
[54:58] breaks my heart
[54:59] Satan can't tempt me there why because
[55:01] Jesus destroyed his power over me
[55:05] that could come here and rejoice and
[55:07] intercede for Souls and praise God and
[55:09] worship and preach the Word of God why
[55:11] because Satan his power has been
[55:13] destroyed over my life amen we walk in
[55:16] the power of the Holy Spirit so I just
[55:18] want those are the scriptures I wrote
[55:20] down those are the first four that I
[55:21] found that they that support Ephesians
[55:26] 216 I believe that was so I'm gonna go
[55:28] back there
[55:28] visions 216 what uh what a thought Paul
[55:32] gives us that the cross slain or
[55:36] destroyed the hatred against us because
[55:38] it was nailed to the cross and also
[55:40] defeated Satan's influence over us
[55:42] because now we walk in the power of the
[55:44] Spirit not in the flesh we walk in the
[55:46] spirit praise God
[55:47] amen now next let's go to this next
[55:52] thought verse 17
[55:55] and preach peace to you which were afar
[55:57] off and to them that were nice oh Jesus
[56:00] he and his ministry ministers preach
[56:03] peace to those that were far off the
[56:05] Gentiles and those that were nigh the
[56:07] Jews and he preaches peace to all of
[56:11] them and we ought to be thankful for
[56:13] peace with God tonight because there are
[56:15] so many people that don't have peace
[56:17] with God tonight and they're trying to
[56:19] fulfill with drugs they're trying to
[56:20] shoot up with drugs because they have no
[56:21] peace with God right but we don't have
[56:24] to shoot up with anything natural we
[56:26] just say God fill me with more of your
[56:27] love amen
[56:28] feel let me get drunk on the Holy Ghost
[56:30] let me just just get so joyful and
[56:33] worship amen fill me with your joy man
[56:35] that's why we come to church to get
[56:37] drunk on the Holy Ghost Oh glory that's
[56:40] exactly right Church I have this place
[56:43] where I feel the best and all the world
[56:44] is in the house of God amen
[56:46] because in his presence is fullness of
[56:48] joy oh it's so true it's so true now
[56:52] let's look at verse 18 I want to lay a
[56:53] few scriptures about verse 18 because as
[56:56] I read this this struck my heart and
[56:57] then I heard brother Brooks preach on it
[56:59] you probably will remember some of the
[57:00] things he said but I want to read them
[57:02] again okay the next one is access to God
[57:07] there's my next slide there access to
[57:09] God for through him we both have access
[57:12] by one spirit unto the Father so through
[57:18] the blood of Jesus Christ he forgave our
[57:20] sins now we have access to the Father
[57:23] through the spirit through the Holy
[57:26] Spirit now I want to look at two
[57:28] examples of how people in the Old
[57:31] Testament had access to a king just
[57:34] because it shows types brother Brooks
[57:36] brought out one of them so let's go that
[57:38] one first Samuel 25 let's go there first
[57:41] Samuel 25 this is Abigail and Abel other
[57:44] Brooks was right it was Nabal was the
[57:45] name I couldn't remember it while he was
[57:47] preaching it so I looked it up on my
[57:49] Bible my Bible app on my phone and it
[57:51] was in Abel he was right
[57:52] First Samuel 25 First Samuel 25 watch
[58:00] the approach and watch how Abigail gets
[58:04] access to the king how many want access
[58:06] to Christ I want to open door to
[58:09] I swear I know I can come before Christ
[58:11] and he won't turn me away
[58:13] we know the veil has been tall we know
[58:15] there's no mental wall partition we know
[58:17] all these things but spiritually there's
[58:19] an approach to take unto Christ and it
[58:22] we did it tonight through prayer and
[58:24] worship but let's look at it as a type
[58:27] in the Old Testament okay so you can see
[58:30] this truth of it first samuel 25 verse
[58:34] 18 it's kind of a long lengthy scripture
[58:38] but I know Lydia's got some healthy
[58:40] lungs there and can read on it has a lot
[58:42] of endurance so 25 I'm on the wrong page
[58:47] 18 okay so you remember the story David
[58:52] asked nabel's Shepherd's can you just
[58:55] give us some water and food and they say
[58:56] no who's David navels like no who's
[58:58] David and so David's thinking I'm gonna
[59:01] go kill Nabal because he was he was in
[59:04] the flesh that was the flesh that wasn't
[59:06] the holy spirit that was the flesh and
[59:09] nabel's wife Abigail years of it and she
[59:12] knows her husband's a fool but she
[59:13] doesn't badmouth her husband that's what
[59:15] a good lesson for our sisters and even
[59:17] for our brothers always show respect and
[59:19] love never badmouth anybody right so
[59:25] here's the the story here's what she
[59:29] says here's her
[59:30] here's her approach to get access to
[59:33] King David okay so Lydia verse 18 can
[59:36] you read 18 and 19
[59:59] all right so we get this idea of when
[1:00:05] you want favor from the king you have to
[1:00:08] show love to the king you have to show
[1:00:12] you have to give gifts to the king and
[1:00:15] gods not asking for raisins from us
[1:00:17] right he's died he's asking for our
[1:00:19] humility he's asking for our praise our
[1:00:22] songs our testimonies our worship our
[1:00:26] love that's all God's asking for us
[1:00:29] right from us that's the only real gifts
[1:00:32] he wants yes we should give tithes and
[1:00:33] offerings that we know that that's a
[1:00:35] minor Doctor memory Jesus told us that
[1:00:37] he said that's one of the least of the
[1:00:38] commandments you know what really God
[1:00:40] wants is justice judgment and mercy
[1:00:42] amen those are the weightier matters
[1:00:44] Jesus told us when we preach on that
[1:00:46] last month so see that's what she brings
[1:00:50] she knows if I'm gonna have any access
[1:00:52] to God if I'm gonna touch the heart of
[1:00:55] God I've got to bring my best and that's
[1:00:58] what that's what David needed David
[1:01:00] needed food so she brought the best food
[1:01:03] she could find loaves right uh a corn
[1:01:08] wine she brought the best and church
[1:01:11] that's why we bring our best to the
[1:01:12] house of God we give God our best
[1:01:15] attention during the service amen that's
[1:01:17] showing God that we love Him that's
[1:01:19] giving him an offering praise God and
[1:01:22] that's how you get access now we know
[1:01:29] the story she brings it now look when
[1:01:31] she gets there verse 23 I'll read 23 and
[1:01:37] when Abigail saw David she hasted and
[1:01:39] lighted off the ass and fell before
[1:01:41] David on her face and bowed herself to
[1:01:43] the ground so once again now we see the
[1:01:46] humility not only does she give lots of
[1:01:48] gifts lots of praises Lots gives the
[1:01:50] Lord when it gives David whatever she
[1:01:52] wants whatever he needs right now with
[1:01:55] that but she physically humbles herself
[1:01:57] praise God
[1:01:59] and we could we could go for some amore
[1:02:01] that could we they don't have to be a
[1:02:03] church right because nobody said on
[1:02:04] Sunday
[1:02:05] anybody can love to stand in front of
[1:02:06] pray and pray in front of people the
[1:02:08] publicans loved to pray there long
[1:02:10] prayers in front of everybody else
[1:02:12] but see if we didn't pray this morning
[1:02:13] then god help us that'd be more sincere
[1:02:15] pray at home and for a church that's the
[1:02:18] idea
[1:02:18] pray all day that's the idea pray all
[1:02:21] day just don't save your only prayers
[1:02:23] you know for church if you had a busy
[1:02:25] morning you got up late God understands
[1:02:27] that right God's got a mercy but let's
[1:02:30] make it a habit of praying all day so
[1:02:32] God knows how sincere we are we must do
[1:02:35] that so see she humbles herself falls on
[1:02:39] at his feet now look at verse 20 this is
[1:02:41] beautiful my and fell at his feet and
[1:02:44] said upon me my lord upon me let this
[1:02:47] iniquity be and let thine handmaid I
[1:02:49] pray thee speak in that audience and
[1:02:52] hear the words of thine handmaid you see
[1:02:54] that David's mad at her husband but she
[1:02:57] said Lord put all of his iniquity on me
[1:03:00] does that sound familiar what did Paul
[1:03:02] tell Philemon he said Philemon put all
[1:03:06] the charges that was against the servant
[1:03:07] put him on my account I'll pay for right
[1:03:11] and Paul said I wish I was cursed so
[1:03:14] that the Jews could be saved
[1:03:15] you see that's thought that's the real
[1:03:18] Christian heart right here don't be
[1:03:20] upset with this person forgive this
[1:03:22] person put it on me and would you please
[1:03:25] after I've given all my gifts after I've
[1:03:28] asked you to have mercy on others will
[1:03:30] you now listen to me can I just say a
[1:03:32] few words
[1:03:33] see that's and that's the model of
[1:03:35] Prayer we should first worship God
[1:03:37] forgive others as they Ferraz God
[1:03:40] forgives us right and then bring your
[1:03:43] requests before God could everybody see
[1:03:44] that
[1:03:45] give him your worship first there's a
[1:03:47] little song we've been listening to
[1:03:48] called first by Lauren Danko I don't
[1:03:50] know has anybody heard it but it says
[1:03:52] before I bring my needs I'll bring my
[1:03:54] heart and I thought that was of just a
[1:03:56] beautiful song and that's what Abigail
[1:03:58] is doing here before she tells you tells
[1:04:00] David all the things she needs first she
[1:04:03] blesses him with all these gifts oh god
[1:04:06] help us to just come and give a
[1:04:07] sacrifice of praise amen in the house of
[1:04:10] the Lord lift our hands say thank you
[1:04:12] Jesus for another day
[1:04:13] thank you for letting me come to church
[1:04:14] thank you for giving me the strength to
[1:04:15] be in the house of God there's so many
[1:04:17] people that can't mean the house of God
[1:04:19] or refuse to come to the house of God
[1:04:20] and Lord I bring my best raisins I bring
[1:04:23] my breast wine I bring my best corn I
[1:04:25] bring my best song tonight by God's
[1:04:27] grace Oh hallelujah God give us Avigail
[1:04:30] hearts amen
[1:04:31] all right now you know the story well
[1:04:34] you might know the story you might not
[1:04:35] I'm not sure last time you read it but
[1:04:39] David thanks her for the advice in verse
[1:04:41] 33 so see that's what women can do women
[1:04:44] can be a source of wisdom not preaching
[1:04:47] at the man but giving them wisdom right
[1:04:51] brother Brandon brother Branham say my
[1:04:53] wife is my correction remember that
[1:04:57] quote the man said my wife is my
[1:05:00] correction see because these two are one
[1:05:04] so the woman remember she doesn't bring
[1:05:06] the word and say hubby you know I'm
[1:05:08] preaching at you know what she said
[1:05:09] darling I feel I have this little
[1:05:11] thought on my heart could I share this
[1:05:12] with you you see there's a difference in
[1:05:15] the approach right it's bringing the
[1:05:17] love first bring the love bring the love
[1:05:19] and then you bring a little advice you
[1:05:21] have some requests it's all about love
[1:05:24] church it's all about love to God and
[1:05:27] then love to one another that's how she
[1:05:29] brings it and then David thanks her
[1:05:33] blessed be your advice in verse 33
[1:05:38] alright so how does she get access to
[1:05:41] God bring gifts gifts and then pray for
[1:05:46] others forgive others right intercede
[1:05:50] for others then the third thing and I
[1:05:52] bring my request before God how many
[1:05:55] raise your hand say God helped me to do
[1:05:57] better job of just entering into worship
[1:05:59] and prayer just with praise how many
[1:06:01] would say that I'm gonna say help me to
[1:06:02] be in an Abigail my hands up sometimes
[1:06:05] I'll just go down and I just got a
[1:06:06] burden that's the first thing I wanted
[1:06:08] to do is ask God God will you take this
[1:06:10] burden off my heart but I even I know I
[1:06:13] need that too when I pray the first
[1:06:15] things out of my mouth I want to say
[1:06:16] thank you Jesus let's give him praise
[1:06:18] let's give him the best gifts we can
[1:06:20] give all right now the second example
[1:06:22] you're probably familiar with is Esther
[1:06:25] but before we go to Esther
[1:06:27] let's go to Roman's 5 to Romans 5 - I
[1:06:32] don't want to leave this out I want to
[1:06:33] make sure I read this because once again
[1:06:34] the ester I might you know just get
[1:06:35] excited I might forget to do Romans 5 -
[1:06:38] honestly because that's just such a
[1:06:39] beautiful story
[1:06:40] Romans 5 - Romans 5 - and you remember
[1:06:51] these scriptures are on my heart this
[1:06:52] evening so when I come down to pray you
[1:06:54] know I was entering into prayer through
[1:06:57] praise I was just thanking the law I'm
[1:06:58] sure you did too you know for prayer
[1:07:01] because that's that's the right approach
[1:07:03] to God that's how you gain access and
[1:07:06] access means an open door that's how you
[1:07:08] gain God's ear that's how you that's how
[1:07:11] you show the Lord you love him is by
[1:07:12] praising him first amen so Romans 5:2
[1:07:17] how about Malachi could you read that
[1:07:18] sir Romans 5 - buddy thank you amen
[1:07:29] so the reason read this is accessed by
[1:07:31] what faith access by faith what is faith
[1:07:35] it's the substance things hope for its
[1:07:37] the revelation of God's will for your
[1:07:39] life right so that's the way we have
[1:07:42] access it's through these gifts so when
[1:07:44] we give the gifts we've got to remember
[1:07:46] we have to have faith to remember God
[1:07:47] loves my prayers God loves me God died
[1:07:51] for me all that high-riding was placed
[1:07:53] upon the cross amen that's faith that's
[1:07:55] a revelation I know God loves me and
[1:07:58] that's how I'm getting access he's
[1:08:00] invited me to come I didn't ask to come
[1:08:02] he invited me to come amen he said let
[1:08:05] every other children come unto me
[1:08:06] he said he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:08:07] what the spirit saith to the churches
[1:08:09] praise God
[1:08:11] so it's accessed by faith we have to
[1:08:15] have the understanding God called me to
[1:08:17] be a Christian in Akron I know God
[1:08:18] placed me here I know God sent me here I
[1:08:21] know I'm in the perfect will of God I've
[1:08:23] got faith in that and I know God wants
[1:08:24] me to pray for others as well right
[1:08:27] okay one more now let's go to Esther -
[1:08:29] Esther - verse 9 Esther - verse 9
[1:08:42] ester to verse nine
[1:08:45] how does ester now you actually have to
[1:08:48] two thoughts on access with ester at
[1:08:51] least two the first one is you have
[1:08:54] access to relationship so in chapter 2
[1:08:58] you see how she gains access to the
[1:09:01] relationship with King Artaxerxes I
[1:09:04] think that's the right way to say that's
[1:09:05] a hard word to say artaxerxes and then
[1:09:10] later in chapter 5 his access for
[1:09:16] requests or intercession ok so there's
[1:09:19] two different ones there first she gets
[1:09:21] access to have a relationship with the
[1:09:23] king and then she gets access to ask the
[1:09:25] King a question and to save souls so
[1:09:28] let's look at these two different ways
[1:09:30] of access and I think you'll see the
[1:09:33] typer similar to Abigail I think you see
[1:09:35] the types the type is that we need
[1:09:38] something outside of ourselves we need
[1:09:40] something because we are not worthy can
[1:09:43] the church say Amen we're not worthy we
[1:09:45] need some we need something to help us
[1:09:48] to come in the presence of God amen
[1:09:51] asked her to verse I say 19 I'm sorry 9
[1:09:54] is it 9 ok Esther 2:9 and the maiden
[1:10:02] pleased him and she obtained kindness of
[1:10:04] him and she speedily gave her her things
[1:10:09] I'm sorry he speedily gave her her
[1:10:12] things for purification with such things
[1:10:14] as belonged to her in seven maidens
[1:10:17] which were meat to be given her out of
[1:10:19] the king's house and he preferred her
[1:10:22] and her maids unto the best place of the
[1:10:25] house of the women verse 10 Esther had
[1:10:30] not showed her people nor her kindred
[1:10:33] for Mordecai charged her that she should
[1:10:35] not show it
[1:10:36] and Mordecai walked every day before the
[1:10:40] core of the woman's house to know how
[1:10:42] Esther did and what should become of her
[1:10:44] now let's stop there just a moment
[1:10:46] [Music]
[1:10:49] Esther had a worker Hege I the keeper of
[1:10:54] the women he had a or she had a helper
[1:10:57] to help get her clean before her
[1:11:00] approached before the King okay so
[1:11:04] before she could have a relationship
[1:11:05] with the king she needed a keeper of the
[1:11:08] women the man who kept the women pure
[1:11:11] the man who knew how to get the women
[1:11:14] clean she needed a man to help get her
[1:11:17] clean so she could have a relationship
[1:11:19] with the king so she could get access to
[1:11:21] the king now can you see how that's a
[1:11:23] type of the preaching ministry today
[1:11:25] women represents the church so the women
[1:11:28] the women the church needs a man that
[1:11:31] will prepare her to come before Christ
[1:11:34] so you see that has to type out the
[1:11:36] preaching of the word of God because God
[1:11:39] sends men to preach the gospel God never
[1:11:41] sent a woman to preach the gospel you'll
[1:11:43] never find the Bible of course right we
[1:11:45] know that you never find that Jesus had
[1:11:47] all 12 men right as apostles he never
[1:11:50] called a woman
[1:11:51] Paul said I never allow a woman to a
[1:11:54] SERP or take authority over a man so a
[1:11:58] woman never stands up there and said
[1:11:59] listen I've got the authority of Jesus
[1:12:00] you man you need to listen to me no it's
[1:12:04] the other way the man says I got the
[1:12:05] authority of Christ because God made me
[1:12:09] the head of my family God made me the
[1:12:11] head of the church right that's what a
[1:12:13] man stands there and he's got that
[1:12:15] authority now he don't have to pound on
[1:12:16] the pulpit but I'm just showing that as
[1:12:19] a illustration the man has the authority
[1:12:21] and it's god-given it's not nothing we
[1:12:24] asked for it's God given praise God so
[1:12:27] we understand that it doesn't make us
[1:12:28] any better it just makes us to have that
[1:12:30] calling and church hears when it comes
[1:12:31] down to it's just more responsibility
[1:12:33] that's what it comes down to the man
[1:12:36] just has more responsibility just like
[1:12:38] the wise version she has a higher
[1:12:40] responsibility than the foolish virgin
[1:12:42] she's got to bring the oil she's got to
[1:12:44] pack the oil are you with me she's got
[1:12:46] to make sure she has enough oil to last
[1:12:48] throughout the entire watch the foolish
[1:12:51] virgin doesn't bring enough she does she
[1:12:52] can't handle that responsibility it's
[1:12:54] not important to her but the wise virgin
[1:12:57] has that responsibility and she follows
[1:12:59] through with it praise God she makes
[1:13:00] sure she's got oil plenty of oil too
[1:13:03] so Jesus comes hallelujah amen so see
[1:13:08] she needs to be made pure so every day
[1:13:13] this Hege I and Mordecai's checking on
[1:13:15] her every day her uncle her family
[1:13:17] relation which he types out the Old
[1:13:18] Testament I think but I can't remember I
[1:13:20] haven't preached on that in a while but
[1:13:22] the point is every day she's made pure
[1:13:24] made pure every day a little bit more
[1:13:27] clean oh you like the sign of that
[1:13:28] church every service a little more clean
[1:13:31] every day a little more clean I'm
[1:13:33] getting more pure more pure more pure
[1:13:35] and then I get access to relationship
[1:13:38] with God hallelujah I like that now
[1:13:42] verse 12 is the stinger most people say
[1:13:44] this is where women are allowed to wear
[1:13:46] makeup but you never find that in the
[1:13:47] Bible what it is is she gets to wear
[1:13:50] oils okay
[1:13:51] oils so that's verse 12 now when every
[1:13:55] maids turn was come to go into King has
[1:13:58] you eres another name is artaxerxes
[1:14:01] there's two different names he's got
[1:14:02] after that she had been 12 months
[1:14:05] according to the manner of those women
[1:14:07] for so were the days of her purification
[1:14:09] 'he's accomplished to it six months with
[1:14:12] oil of myrrh and six months with sweet
[1:14:15] odors and with other things for the
[1:14:18] purifying of the women so oil and odors
[1:14:23] never says anything are there about what
[1:14:26] the world thinks right oil and odors for
[1:14:31] 12 whole months 365 days amen a whole
[1:14:35] year we and the church that's how we are
[1:14:38] we need to fully get purified we need to
[1:14:41] go through I'll say like this we to go
[1:14:42] through the full process of getting
[1:14:43] clean before God amen that's how we get
[1:14:46] access to a relationship with God
[1:14:48] because remember relationship is the
[1:14:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost all right
[1:14:59] can anybody handle a really deep quote
[1:15:04] can anybody handle a deep quote tonight
[1:15:07] okay it's from marriage and divorce I'm
[1:15:12] gonna read a deep quote
[1:15:15] put on your spiritual jackets this might
[1:15:18] shock you we're talking about
[1:15:21] relationship husband and wife how is a
[1:15:24] husband wife relationship consummated
[1:15:26] through intercourse right intercourse
[1:15:30] between a man and woman the wedding
[1:15:32] night
[1:15:32] yeah that's right one flesh very good
[1:15:36] that well that's what makes them one
[1:15:38] flesh
[1:15:38] now put your jackets on I'm gonna burn
[1:15:40] they up there be careful brother Rams
[1:15:42] talking at the bromance preaching and
[1:15:44] marriage and divorce and he's talking
[1:15:46] about how King Ahasuerus could put any
[1:15:49] woman away for disobeying him but she
[1:15:55] could never marry another man but he
[1:15:57] could marry another woman because he's
[1:15:59] the man and God and brother Rams
[1:16:01] comparing that to God God can put any
[1:16:04] Church away he once but the church can't
[1:16:07] get another husband because there's only
[1:16:09] one husband praise the Lord now listen
[1:16:12] this quote it might shock you notice he
[1:16:16] can put her away but she cannot put him
[1:16:19] away he did it has proved it in the days
[1:16:23] when Luther Wesleyan Pentecost let's
[1:16:27] stop right there Luther's church was
[1:16:30] right for a while but then when they
[1:16:32] denominated what did what did God do
[1:16:33] what did Christ do he put them away and
[1:16:35] raised up Wesley but see Luther after
[1:16:40] Luther got revival at one point they
[1:16:42] stopped refusing and said I'm I can't go
[1:16:44] any further with the Holy Ghost I'm not
[1:16:45] this is all I'm doing so so Christ put
[1:16:48] her away and got a new wife now look
[1:16:52] what he says next
[1:16:53] brace yourself here it is in the days
[1:16:56] when Luther Wesley and Pentecost when
[1:16:58] they refused listen to become the
[1:17:00] further part of him by having spiritual
[1:17:04] sexual affair to become pregnant with
[1:17:08] the further part of the word so can you
[1:17:11] can you grasp that what I'm saying is
[1:17:13] that the physical intercourse between a
[1:17:16] man and a woman brother branham likens
[1:17:18] unto the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:20] in the soul every understand that
[1:17:24] because remember jesus said he told the
[1:17:26] he told the workers of iniquity you did
[1:17:28] miracles
[1:17:29] but I never knew you that new word is
[1:17:31] actually is actually marriage knowledge
[1:17:34] of intimacy see he never got into the
[1:17:39] bedroom with them they never they never
[1:17:41] received the true seed of Christ are you
[1:17:44] with me Church I know that's deep and I
[1:17:46] hope you guys hope we have we all appear
[1:17:48] mines tonight we do even quote there in
[1:17:53] other words they refuse to get born
[1:17:55] again in the soul they could go so far
[1:17:57] and this is how brother Adam explained
[1:17:59] it he said there's three rooms in a
[1:18:00] house
[1:18:00] there's kitchen and there's the living
[1:18:04] room
[1:18:04] then there's bedrooms there's really
[1:18:07] only three rooms in a house really you
[1:18:09] eat in one you fellowship in another and
[1:18:11] then you have intimate relations in
[1:18:13] another can everybody say Amen and
[1:18:16] brother Graham likens that unto
[1:18:18] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:18:21] the Holy Ghost never understand that
[1:18:26] Luther wouldn't go out wouldn't even go
[1:18:28] into the parlor wouldn't even go into
[1:18:30] the living room with Jesus they said I'm
[1:18:33] only going to eat with Jesus I'm only
[1:18:34] gonna get saved with Jesus when they
[1:18:35] refused to go into the parlor Jesus put
[1:18:38] her away he went the parlor and called a
[1:18:40] Wesley into the parlor praise God but
[1:18:44] when he invited Wesley Wesley come on in
[1:18:48] here he had to raise up another
[1:18:50] generations ever understand that by
[1:18:52] God's grace into the baptism of the Holy
[1:18:55] Ghost right so was that too bad was that
[1:18:59] too harsh or not was that okay I just
[1:19:01] you know I just hope it wasn't you know
[1:19:02] misunderstood I want you understand
[1:19:04] justification segregation vacation
[1:19:06] baptism Holy Ghost is a type of the
[1:19:09] bedroom that's where you get the life of
[1:19:11] God in the soul amen when you're born
[1:19:13] again this soul that's the same as a
[1:19:15] husband and wife being one flesh now
[1:19:17] you're one soul with Christ amen when
[1:19:19] you get burned again
[1:19:20] does that help by God's grace that's
[1:19:23] what we're talking about access to God
[1:19:24] that's what we're talking about with
[1:19:25] Esther Esther knew of the king but she
[1:19:28] didn't know him until she got married
[1:19:30] and had the wedding night with the king
[1:19:32] does that make sense okay that's what
[1:19:36] we're talking about she had now she died
[1:19:38] dollars-- she got married she got access
[1:19:40] to the King for relationship
[1:19:42] now I have a relationship with the king
[1:19:44] I'm not just a woman out there but I'm
[1:19:46] his actual wife praise God
[1:19:48] Oh Laurie now and what did she need she
[1:19:53] did every day more purification more
[1:19:55] word Maureen you're behaving more
[1:19:57] sermons more prayin every day just Phil
[1:20:00] Phil Phil now you're pure now you can go
[1:20:02] before the king and she was so
[1:20:04] sanctified she walked in there and the
[1:20:06] Bible said that those keepers were like
[1:20:08] okay another woman another woman another
[1:20:10] woman but as soon as Esther walked in
[1:20:12] there they picked up their heads and
[1:20:13] said oh this woman is different and
[1:20:16] church that's how you are Jesus looks at
[1:20:18] us said there's a church there's a
[1:20:19] church there's a church but then he
[1:20:21] looks at you I said there's the bride
[1:20:23] she's sanctified
[1:20:27] he's gonna meet my wife Sheila makes all
[1:20:30] the Word of God he don't add to the word
[1:20:32] we just live what it says praise God and
[1:20:34] then when he sees that bride walk in she
[1:20:36] said he said oh my this one's different
[1:20:38] all the angels of heaven said this one
[1:20:40] is different
[1:20:41] all those churches are compromised on
[1:20:43] sin and love and sent over this church
[1:20:45] loves Christ she's she's purified she's
[1:20:48] obeying every word and now she has
[1:20:50] access to me through the concept
[1:20:53] purification and now she can have
[1:20:55] relationship ring hallelujah but it's
[1:20:59] through a daily walk right daily
[1:21:02] purification purification a long time
[1:21:04] the full cycle although all the cleaning
[1:21:07] out of God that's how you get
[1:21:08] relationship with Christ if not if you
[1:21:11] he said if you refuse a further
[1:21:14] spiritual sexual affair
[1:21:16] he said he'll put you away at church
[1:21:18] that's where we gotta watch to what if
[1:21:20] we're in the bedroom what is God calling
[1:21:21] us to do now that we're in the bedroom
[1:21:23] it's bring forth more children can every
[1:21:27] say amen to that
[1:21:27] that's the Great Commission finishing
[1:21:30] the Great Commission going into all the
[1:21:31] world
[1:21:32] going into Akron and preaching the
[1:21:33] gospel to every creature we need to do
[1:21:36] that by God's grace and we need to do
[1:21:38] that we need to be led though we need to
[1:21:40] be led and know how to do it by God's
[1:21:42] grace that's what I need I need to be
[1:21:43] led on how to do that how to invite
[1:21:45] people how to get more people here like
[1:21:48] Jose bringing Helen you know that's
[1:21:49] that's it just form a relationship with
[1:21:52] somebody invite him to the house of God
[1:21:54] praise the Lord but see we cannot refuse
[1:21:57] to go further with God and this is why I
[1:22:01] said earlier I'm gonna make one more
[1:22:02] statement about this that's why I think
[1:22:04] we need to pray more Church come too
[1:22:06] early and pray I've asked that before
[1:22:08] I'll keep asking that but see if the
[1:22:10] Holy Spirit's asking us for a more
[1:22:11] relationship we've got to be willing to
[1:22:13] do that but like you know the most
[1:22:16] important prayer is at home that's the
[1:22:19] most important prayer but there's
[1:22:20] something special about group prayer
[1:22:22] here where the Jose how many times we
[1:22:24] prayed here at church and God's answered
[1:22:25] your prayer how many times many times
[1:22:28] where the hose they used to tell me too
[1:22:30] many times but yes he said too many
[1:22:31] times so there's something special about
[1:22:35] the house praying here but there's only
[1:22:37] power here if we're already praying at
[1:22:39] home
[1:22:41] but see the Holy Spirit might act may
[1:22:42] ask us to go a little higher
[1:22:44] will you go further in mire in your
[1:22:45] relationship with me can we go a little
[1:22:47] further and we got to be willing to do
[1:22:50] that okay hope that was all right that
[1:22:52] was a merit member marriage and divorce
[1:22:53] paragraph 256 if anyone listened to that
[1:22:56] okay now you know the story of Esther
[1:22:58] let's skip ahead to chapter 4
[1:23:08] remember in verse 14 4:14 mordecai sent
[1:23:14] that letter
[1:23:14] remember to asked her and said you know
[1:23:17] don't think you're gonna escape this if
[1:23:19] if Haman is able to destroy all the Jews
[1:23:22] he said you're gonna die too he said but
[1:23:25] don't you know that God sent you to the
[1:23:27] kingdom for such a time as this don't
[1:23:29] you know you're here for such a time as
[1:23:30] this
[1:23:31] praise God we're here in Akron for such
[1:23:34] a time as this as they're getting darker
[1:23:36] and darker our light should be shining
[1:23:38] brighter and brighter we're here for
[1:23:40] such a time as this and what was this
[1:23:43] ministry now for it was access for
[1:23:45] intercession this is not access for
[1:23:49] relationship she already has the
[1:23:50] relationship she's already married and
[1:23:51] this is where I think you and I they're
[1:23:54] working we can turn a lot of strength
[1:23:56] from this this is what we need to do get
[1:23:58] more in tune for intercession for other
[1:24:00] people's souls that's true now look at
[1:24:03] verse 16 this is Esther's answer to
[1:24:08] Mordecai go gather all the Jews that are
[1:24:11] present in Shushan and fast for me and
[1:24:13] neither eat nor drink three days day or
[1:24:16] night I also and my maidens will fast
[1:24:18] likewise and so will I go in unto the
[1:24:20] king which is not according to the law
[1:24:22] and if I perish I perish all right now
[1:24:28] look at chapter five verse one we'll
[1:24:31] skip that last verse go to chapter five
[1:24:32] verse one who can read it for me but
[1:24:34] Adam thank you sir can you read just
[1:24:35] verse one
[1:24:41] [Music]
[1:24:52] great now reverse - and it was so when
[1:24:55] the King saw Esther the Queen standing
[1:24:57] in the court as she obtained favor in a
[1:24:59] site and the King held out to Esther the
[1:25:01] golden scepter that was in her hand I'm
[1:25:03] sorry in his hand so Esther drew near
[1:25:05] and touch the top of the scepter so now
[1:25:07] how does she get access for intercession
[1:25:11] she had to consecrate her life she had
[1:25:16] to say I'm gonna have to miss some meals
[1:25:17] because I want some people to be saved
[1:25:19] and churches it's not like it's not law
[1:25:22] because listen now it's just overcoming
[1:25:25] this label to see an age that's why we
[1:25:29] have to pray and fast because if we
[1:25:31] don't this layer of sea an age is gonna
[1:25:33] distract us right you understand what
[1:25:35] I'm saying we have to reconsecrate
[1:25:39] ourselves because the way of men and
[1:25:40] women is to just drift away right if we
[1:25:44] don't invest and give God more time we
[1:25:46] just naturally drift away right so this
[1:25:51] is what it's saying if we want to
[1:25:52] intercede for others we've got to make
[1:25:55] some sacrifices when you want to
[1:25:58] intercede for someone I was up there in
[1:26:00] New York and I think I told you this
[1:26:02] story maybe I didn't and brother Avon
[1:26:04] told me his teenage daughters and sons
[1:26:06] were getting really worldly so his wife
[1:26:08] went on a three-day fast she cooked all
[1:26:14] his meals for three days and put him in
[1:26:15] the freezer and said hubby
[1:26:16] you just got to heat him up when you're
[1:26:18] hungry she said I'm going in the
[1:26:20] basement I'm fasting for three days
[1:26:22] straight and she did the second day she
[1:26:24] had a vision or a dream or something she
[1:26:26] came up and said I saw my daughter
[1:26:28] coming out the room with her hands up
[1:26:30] saying praise the Lord I'm gonna repent
[1:26:31] and she's getting really worldly and
[1:26:34] real worldly and like threatening all
[1:26:37] I'm gonna leave and and her dad had a
[1:26:39] word from the Lord saying you know if
[1:26:42] you leave we're cutting you off
[1:26:43] judgments gonna fall on you if you leave
[1:26:45] this church because you're gonna go out
[1:26:48] in the world and sin like a sinner
[1:26:49] worshipping the devil and so the wife
[1:26:52] got really sincere fasted three days
[1:26:56] and also by the way she fasted for every
[1:27:00] Wednesday and Sunday for 30 straight
[1:27:02] years she never ate a meal while her
[1:27:04] husband preached for 30 years can you
[1:27:08] imagine that that's dedication how many
[1:27:12] how many say Laura helped my delegation
[1:27:13] that's what I say and no wonder God has
[1:27:18] given such great testimonies in New York
[1:27:20] I mean God has done some tremendous
[1:27:21] things one of a one of the people almost
[1:27:22] died in the 9/11 bombings and then came
[1:27:25] the message right afterwards I believe
[1:27:27] it's probably because all those prayers
[1:27:29] those faithful prayers papal prayers
[1:27:32] anyways on the third day of her fast her
[1:27:37] the pastor was sitting out there he said
[1:27:39] and and her his wife had already told
[1:27:43] told him I saw this dream of our
[1:27:45] daughter coming out and they said on the
[1:27:47] third day that that exact dream happened
[1:27:50] they turned around and the daughter came
[1:27:52] out crying with her hands up saying
[1:27:53] praise the Lord praise God forgive me
[1:27:55] I've been so awful to your parents and
[1:27:57] now she plays in the band and they got
[1:28:00] two CDs and they make just such
[1:28:02] beautiful worship music it is really
[1:28:05] beautiful so see it's not that it's not
[1:28:07] that we earn our parents our children
[1:28:09] salvation or it's not that we're working
[1:28:11] to save them but it's we're trying to
[1:28:14] get in the mind of God in the channel of
[1:28:17] God how many want the channel of God how
[1:28:20] many want intercession with God well
[1:28:22] you've got to get in the channel of
[1:28:24] Esther just didn't say well I'm the wife
[1:28:26] I can just walk in and I she knew if she

[1:30:51] breath verse 19 now therefore ye are no
[1:30:57] more strangers and foreigners like the
[1:31:01] Gentile used to be but fellow citizens
[1:31:04] with the Saints and of the household of
[1:31:07] faith and our bill upon the foundation
[1:31:11] of the apostles and prophets Jesus
[1:31:14] Christ Himself being the chief
[1:31:18] Cornerstone and that's the scripture I
[1:31:20] want to close with look at a few
[1:31:22] thoughts here now if I can hopefully
[1:31:28] this will work out I want to show that
[1:31:31] again with the statue perfect man I
[1:31:36] think I got the statue curved man on
[1:31:38] here just give me a moment
[1:31:39] remember we're built upon the foundation
[1:31:41] of the Apostles so I'm sorry I'm sorry
[1:31:44] that's got a load up on the Wi-Fi
[1:31:47] remember Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum
[1:31:50] Thyatira Sardis Philadelphia Laodicea
[1:31:55] we're built upon the foundation of them
[1:31:57] I just want to show that pyramid again
[1:31:59] one more time we are not strangers we're
[1:32:03] fellow citizens we are part of the
[1:32:05] building of God and then I want to look
[1:32:09] at another scripture in Revelation
[1:32:10] chapter 3 by the grace of the Lord okay
[1:32:13] I got 400 slides on that church age
[1:32:19] right there 400 quotes in scriptures and
[1:32:22] teachings on that so I thank the Lord
[1:32:25] for that okay I know I'm not sure our
[1:32:29] sister Helen have you ever have you ever
[1:32:31] seen the the statue of a perfect man the
[1:32:33] pyramid have you ever seen that okay all
[1:32:36] right well then just give me a minute I
[1:32:38] just got to scroll up here what it means
[1:32:41] is that the apostles were the foundation
[1:32:44] they're like our foundation and God
[1:32:46] keeps building and building and building
[1:32:47] and we're at the top but we're only as
[1:32:50] strong as our foundation and our
[1:32:52] foundation is right here in the Word of
[1:32:54] God amen the apostles let me show that
[1:32:57] again I guess got a scroll
[1:32:58] in just a moment here the sake of our
[1:33:01] sister hearing these things help me Lord
[1:33:07] where did I put this here
[1:33:12] I've been faster to search Google I
[1:33:14] would have come up there on Google I'm
[1:33:19] in the 200s I thought I put it in here
[1:33:29] maybe I didn't yeah that was last week
[1:33:35] okay no I didn't forgive me I thought
[1:33:38] for sure that was in there
[1:33:43] sorry church I thought it was in there
[1:33:46] oh I think it's in the sanctification
[1:33:48] one let's try that when I'm pretty sure
[1:33:50] it's in oh yeah I'm pretty sure it's in
[1:33:51] that one that's why I do what the the
[1:33:53] the children yeah there it is okay they
[1:33:56] might have a better one no yeah there it
[1:34:00] is that's the one okay so thanks for
[1:34:02] your two minutes there forgive me
[1:34:03] forgive me I hate to do that but okay so
[1:34:05] this is what it's saying sister Helen we
[1:34:07] are built upon the foundation of the
[1:34:09] Ephesus church age so these are the
[1:34:11] believers who live in the days out right
[1:34:14] after Jesus was on the earth
[1:34:15] they're called the Ephesian believers
[1:34:17] okay then the Samarin church age
[1:34:20] Pergamos Thyatira Sardis was Martin
[1:34:23] Luther's day the Reformation around the
[1:34:24] 1500s okay Philadelphia was John
[1:34:27] Wesley's day John Wesley's day and then
[1:34:30] Laodicea is our last day this is the
[1:34:32] last time before Christ returns
[1:34:33] according to the book of Revelation okay
[1:34:37] so we're built upon the foundation of
[1:34:40] st. Paul okay so we're way up here so
[1:34:43] see 2,000 years have passed this is like
[1:34:45] a timeline 2,000 years have passed but
[1:34:49] Paul was our foundation did you know
[1:34:51] Paul said that if anybody changed
[1:34:54] anything he preached they were cursed
[1:34:56] did you know that now he said that in
[1:34:58] Galatians chapter 1 that's why he's our
[1:35:00] foundation if if we take away the
[1:35:03] foundation what's gonna happen to the
[1:35:04] building it's gonna it's gonna fall over
[1:35:06] yeah it's gonna fall over that's why we
[1:35:09] can't change one thing that's why it's
[1:35:11] important to preach the book
[1:35:12] Ephesians Church and Galatians and
[1:35:14] Colossians and a flip in that's why it's
[1:35:17] important if you take any of that out
[1:35:18] your foundations gonna fall right so it
[1:35:23] proves they're not the true churches
[1:35:25] they can still be saved though but they
[1:35:27] have to do they have to be kind to
[1:35:28] Jesus's children and that's what Jesus
[1:35:31] said we don't over that on Sunday we
[1:35:32] actually went over on Sunday that's the
[1:35:35] only way they can be saved if they if
[1:35:37] they if they destroy the foundation the
[1:35:41] only way they can be saved is by that
[1:35:42] last act of grace at the end and that's
[1:35:44] scriptural yeah that's actual Bible
[1:35:46] Scripture okay so it's our duty to never
[1:35:49] change the foundation right don't change
[1:35:52] anything about the foundation keep it
[1:35:53] all the same praise the Lord okay now
[1:35:56] the last scripture I want to read now to
[1:35:59] go along with this is what I just
[1:36:00] listened to yesterday in the
[1:36:01] Philadelphia Church age the prophet
[1:36:03] quoted Ephesians 2 19 and 20 that we
[1:36:06] just read and he quoted it out of
[1:36:08] Revelation 3 so we've got your Bible go
[1:36:10] to Revelation 3 verse it's first yeah
[1:36:18] verse 12 revelation 3:12 and I'm trying
[1:36:22] to close I got three minutes here so
[1:36:24] bear with me and I appreciate your
[1:36:27] patience I hope that was it help to
[1:36:28] everybody so Paul and Ephesians said
[1:36:31] we're built upon the foundation of the
[1:36:32] prophets and holy apostles this is the
[1:36:34] foundation the building were way up here
[1:36:37] at the top we're the small little church
[1:36:38] at the top it's a small minority all
[1:36:44] right we'd like to read 312 for me 312
[1:36:46] anybody I'd like to read 312 but Adam
[1:36:47] again okay how about Amen cause Adam did
[1:36:49] last time thanks but Adam Amen yeah
[1:36:51] whenever you can read 312
[1:37:10] amen thank you sir
[1:37:12] now not to jump ahead too much but I'll
[1:37:16] preach this probably again or maybe a
[1:37:18] different life this last statement I
[1:37:20] want to make is the pillar in the house
[1:37:23] of God for the believer who overcame in
[1:37:27] the days of Wesley Jesus said I'm gonna
[1:37:30] make you a pillar in the temple of God
[1:37:33] okay so the Prophet reads this and
[1:37:36] here's what he says I have this some of
[1:37:37] the exact quotes he said a pillar is
[1:37:41] part of the foundation and isn't it you
[1:37:44] know you have your foundation here then
[1:37:45] you have your pillars but the pillar is
[1:37:46] connected to the foundation okay he says
[1:37:51] a pillar of foundation in the house of
[1:37:53] God he said let's read Ephesians 2:19
[1:37:57] which we already did they said let's see
[1:38:00] what Paul said about the foundation in
[1:38:02] that first church age he said Jesus
[1:38:06] Christ as the chief Cornerstone were
[1:38:07] built upon the chief Cornerstone and the
[1:38:09] holy poss was in a prophets and he said
[1:38:12] jesus said if you overcome I'll make you
[1:38:15] a pillar he said or part of the
[1:38:18] foundation he says which means I'm
[1:38:20] giving you the doctrine of the Apostles
[1:38:24] hallelujah if he makes you a pillar in
[1:38:27] the house of God that means you're
[1:38:29] connected to the doctrine of the
[1:38:31] Apostles you're gonna have the same
[1:38:33] teaching as st. Paul had all right he
[1:38:38] said Jesus is the everlasting father the
[1:38:40] mighty God the same thing the Apostles
[1:38:42] taught he said he will keep you from the
[1:38:47] synagogue of Satan he said I'll put the
[1:38:50] overcomer in the foundation where he can
[1:38:53] stay right with the word oh you ought to
[1:38:55] be happy if you can stay with the word
[1:38:56] amen because we're staying with the
[1:38:59] foundation that Paul laid we're not
[1:39:01] changing the foundation we're
[1:39:03] maintaining the foundation because where
[1:39:06] he makes us a pillar for overcomers we
[1:39:08] become pillars in the house of God we
[1:39:10] maintain and hold the same doctrine
[1:39:13] teaching that the Apostles had it's
[1:39:15] exactly right he said Jesus said if
[1:39:18] you're a pillar you can no more go out
[1:39:21] of God's house see you're sealed in the
[1:39:24] temple of God I knew ya if the pillar
[1:39:27] what happens if the pillars moved out
[1:39:29] Church what happens if they move the
[1:39:31] pillar out the whole buildings gonna
[1:39:33] crumble at least the Front's of the
[1:39:34] buildings gonna crumble right take the
[1:39:36] pillar out of the White House what's
[1:39:37] gonna happen well the part on top she's
[1:39:39] gonna fall down right but the Prophet
[1:39:42] says if you're a pillar he said you
[1:39:44] can't go out anymore the house needs you
[1:39:46] in other words you're sealed into the
[1:39:48] house of God
[1:39:49] you've got eternal life hallelujah
[1:39:52] you're you were in Christ when he was on
[1:39:54] the cross hallelujah see he said he's
[1:39:57] the pillar there's my time he said he's
[1:40:00] a pillar
[1:40:00] he's the bride this represents the bride
[1:40:04] if you're a pillar you're your build
[1:40:06] upon the foundation he said you're part
[1:40:08] of the bride you're part of the house of
[1:40:10] God hallelujah so he said that's why we
[1:40:14] baptized in the literal name of Jesus
[1:40:16] Christ he said there is the bride there
[1:40:22] before the throne of God he said they're
[1:40:24] inside the house of God there's the
[1:40:27] bride let's stand to our feet praise the
[1:40:29] Lord amen
[1:40:30] I hope you enjoyed that by God's grace
[1:40:33] the overcomer becomes a pillar which the
[1:40:38] we must support the same doctrine that
[1:40:41] Paul preached we cannot change one thing
[1:40:44] about it that's why it's good to go
[1:40:46] through these things especially the
[1:40:48] books that are oh of course you know the
[1:40:50] whole New Testament especially those
[1:40:52] because it usually said if you change
[1:40:53] anything in that foundation you said
[1:40:56] then you're gonna fall you're gonna
[1:40:57] stumble praise God
[1:41:02] okay so the next time we're willing we
[1:41:04] do Ephesians will do chapter three and
[1:41:06] look at no more than body Christ by
[1:41:10] God's grace that's just our henceforward
[1:41:11] prayer you know I think tonight's
[1:41:13] message if you know kind of felt the
[1:41:15] Holy Spirit I think tonight's message
[1:41:16] was a lot on access I think that's where
[1:41:18] God was dealing with us the most access
[1:41:21] to relationship and access to
[1:41:25] intercession
[1:41:29] now Church one thing I know let me just
[1:41:32] say is if you're a sincere Christian one
[1:41:35] thing I know is that everyone here can
[1:41:40] grow in their access for intercession I
[1:41:42] hope everybody heard me everybody here
[1:41:45] should say raise your hand and say
[1:41:47] brother Jesse pray for me that out I'll
[1:41:49] learn to access God for it more
[1:41:52] intercession I'm gonna pray for
[1:41:54] everybody on that one now for
[1:41:57] relationship that's where the baptism
[1:41:59] the Holy Ghost I don't know I can't tell
[1:42:03] necessarily where everybody's at with
[1:42:06] the baptism the Holy Ghost but if that's
[1:42:08] your earnest desire I need access into
[1:42:11] the relationship of the Holy Ghost seek
[1:42:14] God for it with all your heart see God
[1:42:17] for it with all your heart if you see
[1:42:19] sinful habits and things a believer a
[1:42:21] Christian shouldn't have then you
[1:42:23] probably still need sanctified it
[1:42:24] there's a sill of for the world and
[1:42:26] things in the world then you there's
[1:42:28] still more sanctification then may God
[1:42:30] help you the seek relationship access to
[1:42:34] relationship how they do the churches so
[1:42:38] you know I don't like people my life for
[1:42:39] me but I believe our greatest need of
[1:42:41] our church is access for the baptism of
[1:42:43] the Holy Ghost because the Prophet said
[1:42:45] that all these people have the Holy
[1:42:47] Ghost we'd be seeing signs multiplied he
[1:42:50] said we'd be seeing miracles multiplied
[1:42:52] and now we kind of see in time to time
[1:42:56] but see we want to see a multiply well
[1:42:59] we want to see more and more and that's
[1:43:02] just my thought if I probably said that
[1:43:03] then that's just my thought I really
[1:43:06] feel like our church can grow in access
[1:43:09] to the born-again experience hallelujah
[1:43:12] and then access to intercession let's
[1:43:17] pray together Church you think about
[1:43:19] what you need prayer for I'm gonna pray
[1:43:21] for both access to relationship and
[1:43:24] access for intercession for all of us
[1:43:29] yeah yeah yeah we can do that and just
[1:43:39] so you know sister
[1:43:40] this might help you to as you pray to be
[1:43:42] pregnant Satan told Jesus that he had
[1:43:48] power over every government that's in
[1:43:51] the book of Matthew members say he said
[1:43:54] bow down to where she meet I'll give you
[1:43:56] all these kingdoms so that grew Satan is
[1:43:59] really in charge of government's but we
[1:44:02] didn't pray that some of those
[1:44:04] individuals in the government will have
[1:44:07] a real relationship sure yeah I used to
[1:44:13] pray for brocco bomber he's made a lot
[1:44:16] of decisions I didn't agree for his soul
[1:44:37] let's pray that some individuals in that
[1:44:39] government will get safe father in
[1:44:43] heaven thank you for today North this is
[1:44:48] what we need we need access read access
[1:44:54] for relationship to really be the Bride
[1:44:57] of Christ we need the baptism the Holy
[1:45:00] Ghost our church Lord God Father I pray

[1:45:24] the Holy Spirit to prepare those who are
[1:45:26] not more to get to be born again

[1:57:56] morning I think it broke too fast at six

[1:57:59] supper and God answer just after that
[1:58:01] little just two meals just two people
[1:58:04] missed two meals and God took away
[1:58:07] cancer and seizures
[1:58:13] how many by the Lord amen
[1:58:16] we just we just gotta get access so let
[1:58:22] me know pray by going to let me know
[1:58:23] tonight you sent me a text
[1:58:24] let me know if you're busy this Saturday
[1:58:27] and we do next Saturday it's best to do
[1:58:29] it on a day where you don't have to work
[1:58:30] well at least for me at work I'd be
[1:58:33] hungry because I'm just talking I'm
[1:58:36] teaching all the time of mind you know
[1:58:38] your mind he's really your mind uses
[1:58:40] most of your energy from your food well
[1:58:43] they're not one time if you have a
[1:58:46] burden to fast and pray for so much let
[1:58:48] me know I'll join you the prayer there's
[1:58:51] power in the past
[1:58:52] Esther interceded in one souls for such
[1:58:56] is this okay yeah you would have to what
[1:59:05] the Bible said you'd have to wait till
[1:59:07] God put it on your heart too fast
[1:59:10] because if God puts on your heart you'll
[1:59:12] be okay but if you don't be a legend
[1:59:15] fast then you just you just do the show
[1:59:17] I just do that yeah yeah and we went
[1:59:22] over in the Book of Daniel gay or way
[1:59:25] was it 14 days or 12 days or 21 days
[1:59:28] ever again but he had what was he facets
[1:59:31] from major foods so he just ate light
[1:59:33] foods so like if you got you know you
[1:59:36] don't suffer you have chicken we just
[1:59:37] would eat the chicken you just eat the
[1:59:39] rice or them
[1:59:40] you just eat lighter and that might be
[1:59:43] the way you would fast okay so there are
[1:59:48] different kinds of fats Daniel did a
[1:59:50] juice only fast and when were that one
[1:59:52] in the scripture he just had liquids but
[1:59:57] some people if when you're really
[1:59:59] anointed you don't eat or drink nothing
[2:00:01] you can do that to the longest ever did
[2:00:05] that was there just a day and a half I
[2:00:06] didn't drink any water didn't eat one
[2:00:08] thing per day that I know my brother's
[2:00:10] cam in Simon they've gone two or three
[2:00:12] days without eating or drinking nothing
[2:00:14] just because that anointing was on there
[2:00:16] that anointing was on them you know and
[2:00:19] when that anointing leaves that's when
[2:00:20] you go eat so all parts of mine is clear
[2:00:26] does every understanding if you have a
[2:00:28] burden let's do that I think it's
[2:00:30] inspired if it's been preached night by
[2:00:32] God's Word if it's poked to your heart
[2:00:34] let me know you can pray and intercede
[2:00:36] for that if you can't come to church you
[2:00:37] I'll let you know what time I'll be
[2:00:39] praying you pray at the same time let's
[2:00:41] get those requests they may know before
[2:00:43] the Lord all right let's just let's just
[2:00:48] have a word of Prayer let's just close
[2:00:49] it prayer will be dismisses right oh
[2:00:51] that's great how many father we love you
[2:00:54] again tonight we close with this prayer
[2:00:58] we just want to say thank you for the
[2:01:00] service just want to thank you let us
[2:01:04] see like Abigail Lord let us be like
[2:01:06] Esther
[2:01:09] let us bring our love let's bring gifts
[2:01:13] of love first before I bring my need let
[2:01:16] us bring our hearts teachers learn to
[2:01:22] pray like that that's how we get access
[2:01:26] that's how we get noticed by the key
[2:01:30] because we can't pray a selfish prayer
[2:01:33] and expect to be heard
[2:01:34] we can't prepare with sit in our arms it
[2:01:38] expect to be heard
[2:01:40] we must pray a prayer with nothing
[2:01:43] doubting nothing in our hearts that we
[2:01:47] hidden in the prayer cloud and you have
[2:01:54] us the faster over something there are
[2:01:56] the people's hearts so we can all do it
[2:01:59] together we're thankful for what you did
[2:02:08] last we know you're the same God you
[2:02:15] understand what we go through you
[2:02:16] understand or trials you understand how
[2:02:19] dark they ever see this the Lord we
[2:02:22] should understand how powerful your
[2:02:24] spirit it will give us strength or God
[2:02:28] it'll be a standard that raises up
[2:02:30] against the flood of the enemy it will
[2:02:34] overcome temptations we will always be
[2:02:40] stronger than the temptation Thank You
[2:02:46] Preston to the house of God and those
[2:02:49] that live Street listen later I pray for
[2:02:52] those who won't that you create such a
[2:02:53] hungry because if you have the holy
[2:02:59] spirit we're talking it only feeds on
[2:03:02] the ring so for those whom are extremely
[2:03:08] god will humble then Lord draw them
[2:03:10] closer to you can you stop the Word of
[2:03:13] God nor Qaida's now Lord if we should
[2:03:17] intercede with your fasting sorry to
[2:03:20] intercede martyr pray for acts
[2:03:23] to the relationship thank you for help
[2:03:27] our church to grow grace and knowledge
[2:03:28] of you Jesus Christ
[2:03:31] god bless you to this world
