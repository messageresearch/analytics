let's go to Revelation chapter 3 I'm gonna finish the church agents tonight I believe by the grace of Lord I want to preach one more message I'll be message number 59 tonight by God's grace so very thankful for that and I can feel complete as a pastor and I guess that's just as a brother maybe as a man I'd like to finish what I started so I look forward to tonight finishing this thought up and I trust you've been blessed I know there's been so many things as I preached this series that I've needed to write at that hour and God has made himself of course more real during this time to me the secrets to the church ages and all these things that have been revealed to us we're so thankful for them I trusted been a great blessing to you as well so I have guys can put it up there maokai when you're ready Revelation chapter 3 let's go to verse 20 we'll just read the last few scriptures again as we did last Wednesday night then Sunday Lord willing I'll be preaching Sunday I think I'm going to preach on the last chapter of Proverbs I'm going to preach on to proverbs 31 woman so I think I'm feeling led to preach on that by the grace of the Lord remember that's supposed to be a message of encouragement that's not supposed to be a message of you know making women feel bad or something like that it's actually a chapter that shows the potential of what a woman can achieve over the course of her lifetime that's what that chapter shows I know in times past you know I've talked to different people and I could never be a proverbs 31 woman or I could never do that but you have to look at the scope of this this is a woman throughout her entire life at one stage of her life she's ministering to her children she makes sure her children have everything they need a winter time right then another stage of her life she's out there buying a field planting a vineyard making money and having a food shipped in from other countries this is a woman who's mature this is this is the UH the the full fruit of a godly woman over the course of decades so it's something to keep in mind and we know they're rare to find the Bible says they're very rare to find because the Bible said her price is far above rubies and so I'm sure our sisters want to be that but I'm sure our brothers want to be a spiritual proverbs 31 woman they want to be a pleasing wife to Christ I know I do it's kind of odd to say that though you know a man wanted to be a wife it's hard to say that but I think you understand spiritually speaking revelation 3:20 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me aren't you glad you've heard the voice aren't you glad you've opened the door I'm so happy I'm having supper with Christ tonight verse 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let's just bow our heads and word of Prayer you have a need on your heart just making known to God as we pray Heavenly Father Lord I'm so thankful for tonight for many reasons the Lord for life breath my being my family this church Lord my job the Saints were so grateful for all that we have most of all were grateful for you Lord our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and father were grateful to come to the conclusion of this series Lord God it seemed like it would never get here at times because or as this my human mind I just want to finish what I start and so Lord I'm grateful for tonight I'm asking for grace that I could finish this subject Lord God as far as at least for now Lord perhaps the Holy Spirit will direct me here later on but Lord I know this series has been tremendous for me personally Lord God it so helped me to understand the spirit within the the two spirits rather within the framework of the church Lord and by your grace Lord I believe with all my heart our churches part of the true the true vine Lord God and we're overcoming the false vine Lord and we're recognizing the false spirit and withstanding the false spirit Lord Jesus by your grace Heavenly Father so Lord speak to us here tonight we need you Lord meet every need of every individual Lord our hearts are raised our hands are raised Oh God speak to every heart we need you tonight Lord God and we're so looking forward to your word and our worship afterwards we give you glory in Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen god bless she's been seated here praise the Lord so I started the church ages in 2015 I just introduced them and then I preached on Laodicea and then I took a break 2016-2017 I'm sorry I took a break in 2016 and then I picked it back up in 2017 and now Lord willing tonight we can finish it by the grace of the Lord so let's look at this here part 59 this is the resume so chapter 10 of the book which I finished lat couple weekends ago is called chapter 10 is called the resume of the church ages which means a summary like when you fill out a resume for your job it's a summary of what you've done over the course of your life and so brother branham you know felt led of course maybe with lavell you know to right a summary of the church ages so I'd like to do that tonight and just hit the highlights of these last 14 pages of the book if you have a chance to to read that then I'm gonna read the last three paragraphs Malachi let me borrow a copy his book I left mine in my car after work so I'm gonna read the last few paragraphs to kind of show what how the Prophet closes this thought now he begins his chapter by saying due to the fact that our studies have been a verse by verse exposition of those scriptures that deal with the seven ages we've not set forth a continuous historical pattern of the church as much as we ought to have done it is therefore our purpose now to take this chapter and beginning with the vision age trace all through the ages the church and her history has given to John by the Spirit of God we will not be adding any new material as much as correlating what we already have okay so there is there's not much new in this last chapter but so the purpose of this is to trace the two spirits from Ephesus back all the way down to today the time of Laodicea that's his purpose to kind of focus on those two spirits so he says before we even start remember there was three great revelations about the church ages that we must remember the first is that the church in Revelation in chapters 2 and 3 refers to anyone who calls himself a Christian it includes the elect and it also includes the reprobate because it's anyone who calls himself a Christian whatever comes out of your mouth God's gonna hold you accountable for what comes out of your mouth right with you I'm a Baptist or I'm a Luther I'm a message believer I'm a Buddhist I'm a Muslim whatever comes out of your mouth God's gonna hold you accountable for that unless you repent of it because the Bible said Jesus said every idle word will be given account for so we must make sure the words that come out of our mouth are sincere we must stand up and say what we believe and we must stand on the truth of God's Word now the second part was that the last two vines would grow side by side until the harvest you would never get rid of all the tares and then thank God the tares could never get rid of all the weak - amen Rome tried to squash her out and her out in the thyroid here in church age but she couldn't do it because God is always gonna have a witness amen and thirdly the Holy Spirit could and would fall upon both vines that's another truth these three truths are the three major revelations of the church ages we have to understand that that they flow all the way through the church's elect and reprobate it's filled with both and then you have both vines growing side by side and the Holy Spirit will fall on both because the church ages are like a field and in a field you have wheat and you have tears amen this might be a short sermon tonight we'll see Ephesus now Ephesus the Prophet gives a few things to note he says the birth of the church was at Pentecost that was the birth of it and the church shortly thereafter became a fallen woman so a few years after Pentecost the church became a fallen woman and the Prophet tells us why he says just like Eve he said just like Satan got to Eve right before Adam and Eve could come together and multiply so did Satan get to the true church before the rapture that's what the Prophet says before the future home so the same thing happened the church fell and the church as a whole like we said there's reprobates and many of them left their first love the church is a whole fell just like Eve fell at the beginning and death entered into the church and brother Branham says this is can be proved because Jesus later in the Church ages offers them to partake of the Tree of Life hey Holly literally I thought that was beautiful amen death had already entered because Jesus was offering the Tree of Life to the overcomer so it shows the churches started dying they left their first love they had left their their focus on the Word of God and they let something else enter in to their lives the Prophet said this this was the age of leaving the first love the church left their first love and now the Prophet said the message of course was to them but also to the entire Age the entire Age had left their first love and then the Prophet tells us here they had added things like titles like bishops and they started doing the deeds of the Nicolaitans and here he says the tears always flourish more in a field unless they're uprooted but we know Jesus told the angel don't uproot the tares while the wheat grows with it so the tares flourish more the tares grew more than the true church yeah the deeds of the Nicolaitans entered a member deeds were not anything written in concrete they weren't you know doctrines of the church they're just little habits the church got into they were sinful habits that people started doing like we say like we gave some examples at the beginning like baptizing babies you know sprinkling babies baptize them father said well I should say baptism father suddenly goes but just doing other little things like that letting women have a ruling in the church and and all kinds of things and just letting little sins go it's okay to have this bad habit and it's okay to let this sin go they started compromising on the word and then they started giving preachers titles like Bishop and and presbyter and all these different titles they gave them and they started leaving the initial truth of the word of God and he said it's like when a married couple the first first few months of marriage are just fine and dandy but you give it a little time give it a few years and then they lose their first love in their wedded life so that's what happened to the church and the Prophet said that Jesus bought all the humanity on the cross he said and so all the church belongs to him and so everyone is required to obey the word of Jesus he's the husband he's the one who bought the entire church so the Prophet summarizes it like that so now we'll just start summarizing the sins I'm gonna go down like this up and around so the first church age their deeds were wrong they started let it they started cooling off towards God they cared more about what the world thought about them than what God thought about them that's right now for some urn of the Prophet shortens this as well and he says what happened in Samara now you have of a full church first there was just deeds and the and the the reprobate we're hanging out amongst the sinner or I'm sorry that the elect reprobate among the elect but then in this church age they started separating themselves and they started having their own churches and Jesus says now they're the synagogue of Satan they've at this point in the submergence earch age they've already separated themselves they have their own churches and now they're the synagogue of Satan and now they start persecuting the true vine in the second church age and the Prophet said this is the stage where we start seeing the children of the bondwoman persecuting or making fun of the children of the free woman so like Ishmael persecuting Isaac during this time you had the false Church now persecuting the true Church yet saying were the true seed were the true people of God but it wasn't true and Jesus let many of them die because we're getting towards the Ox age the Ox anointing jesus said I understand I know your sufferings I could I could keep you from being a martyr but he allowed them to be martyrs because Jesus knew that the bride must be faithful unto death and then we must love Jesus more and more amen no matter the trials we must fall in love with Jesus more and more hallelujah now the Prophet said Jesus will hold these people in the synagogue's of Satan he'll hold them accountable because they're saying they're Christians they they say we're the Church of Christ and but jesus said they're liars they baptize they go through ceremonies they sing songs they have rituals they do all these things but they're still not of God when they have the wrong spirit behind them he said this is just like Balaam because Balaam knew the proper approach to God he sacrificed 7 clean bullocks that was part of the approach to God under the Feast of Israel the seventh feast I believe the feast of atonement David toment one of the sacrifices was seven feasts of Israel I'm sorry seven clean bullocks and so Balaam picked that up and Balaam copied that worship and he brought seven clean bullocks as part of his worship he copied the worship of God that's right but yet Balaam still chose his own way the Prophet said he wanted his own way and so God gave him his own way God gave Balaam his heart's desire and how me know God's gonna give you your heart's desire - it all depends though what's your heart's desire hey man and your choices you out make in your life will show what your heart desire is if you choose to run after money or choose to run after relationships and put that above God and break god's word or if you choose to walk in full obedience to the word of the Lord amen and that's why Balaam went to hell because God offered him and showed him the perfect will of God but he turned on the perfect will of God and walked in the permissive will of God for the love of money and that's why God sent him to hell because he chose with his harsh desire he chose money popularity and fame over the perfect will of God now the Prophet said the churches of today all represent Balaam these churches these false churches that are synagogue of Satan he said gave examples they'll take the permissive will of God like women preachers he said organizations denominations false doctrines they all represent Balaam today they all claim God spoke to them which Balaam could claim that - God spoke to Balaam he said but and they all have manifestations of the Holy Spirit like Balaam had but they left the perfect will of God for the permissive will of God so see when it all boils down to it what matters most is that we do the will of God how many can say amen to that glory now we see their hatred increases they're the synagogue of Satan that's about where I left off on many of my notes because I just ran out of time now a Pergamos in Pergamos the main thing that Satan was doing was bringing the doctrine of Balaam okay we mentioned that earlier but see how Satan works he from just deeds that were written down now they have their separate churches persecuting the true church and now they've got the doctrine of balaam which happened in the third church age which deals with Constantine which of course this is right around the time of the the Council of Nicaea which we'll talk about here in just a moment now the Prophet said the doctrine of the Nicolaitans was also the doctrine of Balaam and this is the a when the preachers started making themselves higher than the laity this is the age where they started doing that he said this involved evolved in today what we have a modern-day priesthood and this doctrine forbid the lady from their spiritual rights so it puts all the holiness and the priests it puts all the power and all the authority in the priests and the people have no holiness they have no anointing they have no power they have no authority so that's what Satan wants to do Satan wants to put all authority in the person behind the pulpit all power in them and he wants the church to feel like they have none but as we heard on Sunday morning we do have power and authority every bride member has power Authority the scripture is talking about me it's prophetic of me it's talking about you is it not they've had it's me the scripture is talking about you we are all supposed to fulfill the scripture we're all supposed to have the leadership of the Holy Spirit it's exactly right that's what I believe our church does that I believe our church by the grace of God I believe our church preaches that everyone should have the power of God in their life can you say amen to that I believe our church preaches that you shouldn't come just expecting the preacher to have anointing but you should come with your anointing to I believe that our church preaches that every person should have a gift of the Holy Spirit and a ministry I believe our church preaches that and I and I believe I do as master I believe I do everything I can do to try to encourage the people to do that and if not let me know praise the Lord I invite you to come early to pray I might to a prayer service we try do everything we possibly can do to let every person have a part of the Holy Ghost ministry but in this age that was the key deception to make the priests hire make them have all the rights all the authority or the power it gave more rights to the clergy than the land t-then buh-bam said the antichrist spirit tried to get the local leaders to have more responsibility than just their local church now we don't have anything like that going on I don't have any influence over any other churches other than this one right here but you know churches that do right I know there's a lot of people in the message they've got they rally around one man and so what they'll have is satellite churches especially with the internet today right now one man and he's got you know through 30 churches that are satellite churches that's wrong it shouldn't be like that the Bible said ordain elders in every city praise the Lord there should be a local elder a local pastor in every church even if they are in the same city they should have their own pastor one pastor should not rule over numerous congregations now of course can a pastor help out a church you know for a little bit you know until they get a pastor yes but the plan should be that the pastor just helps them out for a while until God anoints somebody who can who can be the ox of the team right but this is the age when they started putting men having more than just local responsibilities I've had people reach out to me lately can you give me money to do this than that and they're from other church and I say no I'm sorry I don't know you first of all I don't know you and I said my responsibility is to help the sheep that God gave me you have to say that humbly I want to help them but I don't know what they're gonna do I don't know I never from overseas I don't know what they're gonna do but that's what God that's what that person needs to do they need to go to their pastor or get a pastor and and and work with the pastor support the pastor proving the past year not a goat prove to the pastor you're a sheep and how do you do that by obeying everywhere that's in the Bible not every order of the pastor but every thing the pastor says that's in the Bible because again I don't have any real authority over you other than just to preach God's Word to you that's the only authority I have over you I don't tell you how to run your life I don't tell you I give you a suggestions on higher in my life and you can follow it if you want you can follow my example if you want but I don't lord over you I don't tell you what to do I don't tell you all these things like that that's what Gentiles do that's what that's what the Antichrist spirit does but the true Holy Spirit will give us influence over the local church to try to point them to Jesus Christ the word amen hallelujah now he said the doctrine of balaam the Prophet says this he said the doctrine of balaam literally was when Constantine around this point right here around 325 AD so right after the beginning of the church age through here's 312 so right after that right in here Constantine gathered all the Christians together that would come now not the true ones they didn't go to the meeting brother Branham said and of course history would say that too he tried to gather them all together and unite church and state that's exactly what Balaam did Balaam was the religion and then Balak was the state and he United them at bale peor and the Prophet said that's exactly what happened when Constantine United church and state did he not he did and then he let the the Christian churches had after that council of nicaea he let them have the buildings of the pagan gods and they just they kept the statues but they swapped out the names so went from Jupiter to Paul right right from Venus to Jesus they just they have the same Babylonian religion just with Christian names and that was called the doctrine of balaam they United the church and state and now their worship if you go to a Catholic service when was last time you went to one it's been a while for me but I went to Catholic wedding recently and their whole service is based upon creed dogma and tradition now we've got to make sure our services don't turn into Creed doctrine and religion in other words we've got to come here looking for the Living God we got to say God speak to brother Jesse or speak to brother Darrell as brother Brooks come speak to brother Brooks speak to us that our lives can be changed and we can realize that you're right amongst us amen whether it's through healing or forgiveness or repentance or salvation or the baptism of the Holy Ghost let us feel your power and let us obey your spirit amen we can't let our churches turn it our church sir into Creed's and dogmas in rituals we must call upon God for the supernatural power of the Holy Ghost it's exactly right now brother Branham said the biggest the greatest danger who knows what the greatest danger of the doctrine of balaam is anybody no program said the greatest danger of this doctrine he says is to for the clergy or the preachers to tie the people to themselves instead of the Christ and that's why I've always said like this I've always said if you feel led to leave this church follow that leading and leave this church I'm not gonna bind you here to myself but I also have to say on the other hand if the Holy Spirit tells you to stay here you better stay here right is that right but but the clergy the the the were the worst deception of that was they trying to get the people to be fearful oh if you don't practice this sprinkling if you don't teach your children the catechism they're going to be lost they try to keep them in the church by fear rather than by faith and I want I want our church and all true churches should keep the people there by faith and not fear amen that means God faith is a revelation so God has revealed to you this is where your home church is this is where you feed like a sheep on the word of God this is where you grow in Christ amen but like I said before if God takes me out of the pulpit and and pulls me away from me in a pastor you would be just as strong here and pray until God sends another pastor because you're not tied to me you're tied to Christ amen never understand that by God's grace now of course I hope you love me as your pastor I hope you appreciate me as your pastor I appreciate you as the church but we're not tied together like that like denominationalism in other words you can stand if I'm not here I can stand if you're not here because we're standing for Christ amen but that's the danger of the doctrine of balaam they've got to bind themselves to the state they got to bind themselves to the preacher the preachers got to keep the people there with fear or if you leave the satan will get after you oh my it all depends on the leadership of the Holy Spirit amen we must be led by the Holy Spirit now he said this also was they they made the leadership of the church human leadership rather than spiritual leadership of the Holy Spirit they wanted the human leaders rather than Holy Ghost leaders and he said what they did is they wrapped up for the Roman Church wrapped up I already said it before I'll say it again they wrapped up Babylonian worship and gave it a Christian title so kind of like a wolf in sheep's clothing right that really behind all Roman Catholicism is Babylon confusion of the word they don't really believe the word and that's wrapped up in this sheep's type of clothing it's hid behind a Christian mask we'd say and the Prophet says this I haven't preached this yet so this is not review the Prophet said if the rapture took place today no one in the denominations today would have any excuse for missing the rapture he said and that's because they all have a human conscience they all at some point should have been able to discern is this the Bible or is this not the Bible right he said they're mean he said there will be no appeals in the core of God's judgment because they're in the wrong ranks oh my aren't you glad to be in the ranks of the message of the hour I'm so glad I'm not in the Presbyterian ranks like I used to be or the the Baptist race or the Pentecostal ranks I'm so glad to be in your ranks amen the race of the bride because there'll be no excuse for the rapture comes member he that's holy is holy still he that's righteous the foolish virgin is righteous still and he that's unholy is unholy still amen and I forget the other one what's the other one - unrighteous thing is unrighteous unholy unrighteous and holy and righteous I believe from Revelation chapter 22 when the rapture comes there's no excuse for whatever rank you're in now Church does that give you hope - that no matter what people around me decide I'm gonna stay in God's church amen I'm going to stay in the true Church of God I'm gonna stay in the right ranks the Satan can't offer me anything that would cause me to leave these ranks amen because we're in the ranks of the prophetic hour of the day amen glory there's no excuses everybody has a discernment everybody should be able to say well well I know there's one book that God's going to judge us by everybody knows God's gonna judge the world by this Bible everybody knows that that's why they're the most popular sell book every year it's just human it's just human conscience God places that understanding in the human conscious remember we said we saw that Romans 1 recently everything that's we know known about God or like what is known about God is already revealed in every human being it's in your mind you see in your body you look at your mind you look at your body use do you think about your mind everybody knows that there's a creator they can't deny it and then only a fool is an atheist and says there is no creator that's right now program says let me limit let me say it again we are not against this the people were against the system that's why I'm friends with many people that go to domination on church I'm so friendly with them when they asked me about different things about women preachers or makeup I tell them they still thankfully I've only lost a couple of friends because of makeup I lost a few friends because that video makeup in the Bible I haven't lost too many other friends other than that the ones that left me come back to me and we're my friends again so haven't lost too many other than a few so it must must not be the hour yet you know where they have to turn remember that's a term we saw that last week they have to turn from any vestige of truth and then if they're persecute the true bride so we know it's probably not that our yet we're not against the people were for the people were against the system now brother Adam says because of all this marrying church and state this set the stage for the Dark Ages this thousand year period here the Dark Ages I already went over this here I just put little reminders up there for myself now we're ready for the Dark Ages which is thyroid pterosaur getting down to the end here now the Dark Ages was thousand years of darkness spiritual darkness and brother branham said this is the depths of Satan so you could not get any deeper in Satan's Antichrist spirit than to have the Jezebel religion right I'm sorry we're not there yet that's that's what happens this this period yeah this is what happened this period this is as deep as you can go to have Jezebel religion you already had the deeds you had the little sinful things that weren't bathrooms yet then you made them doctrines here and now you've got Jezebel religion which is the false church with full complete power that's Jezebel religion because this is the age when Rome had most of their martyrs of the 68 million member of 68 million brother man talked about that six to eight million from foxes Book of Martyrs this is the age where we had the Crusades this is the age where you had the other Inquisition Inquisition that's where he had that as well millions and millions and millions of Christians died this was the depths of Satan that were warned about now he says this with money political power and religious influence the only place left to go was Jezebel religion so this teaches us that the worst religion possible is Jezebel religion that's the worst religion possible she was a murderer and so was the Roman Catholic Church she controlled Bert I'm sorry Rome controlled both church and state just like Jezebel did and then the Prophet tells us these three manifestations are on the same antichrist sphere just in a different stage so this is how Satan will increase in false churches he'll start out with deeds and they'll move two doctrines and Nicolaitans the deeds that become doctrines and then doctrines have become like Balaam where you compromise right with the world you come out from the Church compromised of the world and then you become a part of the false church system which in our day would be the Roman Catholic Church and her daughter's Church we're not our church is never gonna go join the Catholic Church right and our church is never gonna say oh let's leave the message and let's go join with the Baptist's you know we're never going to do that but what do we need to worry about church right here deeds we will never we will never write bylaws and give you like bylaws that break the Word of God we have to have bylaws but we're never going to write bylaws that break the Word of God right we're not going to do that but what happens as you've seen it in message churches right we see it where they have just traditions that are not written down there just deeds and the deeds produce sin in the church and it creates a cancer in the church right because it's like leaven and that leaven is going to keep multiplying unless it's cleaned out right and so you see churches go through good times where the leavens all cleaned out and they go through bad times when sin is left sitting in people's lives so now now the preachers have to preach against that and then the preacher and the people have to go to that individual let's say it's this individual right here there's no but let's say the individual sits at this chair which nobody does the either the pastor has to go to this individual or somebody the church has to go to this individual and talk to them in order to get the leaven out because if we don't get the leaven out it's going to leaven the whole entire church it's gonna cause unbelief that spirit will hinder you while we're trying to raise our faith that spirit will try to hinder you it's led leaven that leavens the whole lump is that right like we recently we've seen in the years past God has taken out sinners out of the church that didn't believe the Word of God amen right I've had asked a couple people not to come back you might not know about that but I've had told people until you repent brother Brooks was there when I told one person that is not allowed to come to our church anymore I said until you repent of this you're not allowed to come back and so there was other things exceda in exchange but I told that person you're and they've called me numerous times but I told him I said until you repent you're I'm not I'm not letting you come back I cannot let leaven sit in here and think oh it's just it's not going to hurt anybody eventually we'll get rid of it I've got to get rid of it right now and if you know somebody who's got leaven in their life whether fornication greed unconfessed sin if you know and I don't know you've got to go to them or you've got to let me know about it because that's what's gonna happen our churches you have to worry about this I'm not going to say let's go up let's go down here to the Southern Baptist Convention let's have some fellowship with a Southern Baptist I never going to invite you to do that that's what Balaam did he said let's go join up with bale PR and they fornicated in 24,000 I I'm never going to say oh let's go join the Roman Catholic Church it's never going to happen but what could happen here is that if I'm not careful you're not careful we'll start doing things that a little bit sinful and if we don't repent of them it'll start growing and that will start hurting the church right your prayer life will be hurting your Bible reading we're burning your church attendance will hurt your giving work it'll just start somehow it'll start affecting your spiritual life you won't have patience with your brother or sister anymore right you know some of those fruits remember brother may have said what is the thing that Antichrist spirit eats off first the fruit of the Spirit so love joy peace long-suffering gentleness kindness goodness faithfulness all those fruits you start seeing little joy leave your life you start seeing little gentleness leave your life what's happening some deed came into the church we've got to cut out the deeds amen all of our deeds must just be Christian needs Amen that's right Church this is what I've got to watch out for this is what you've got to watch out for we'll never get into this you know we'll never do that but it's this we've got to make sure we keep the little sins remember it's the little foxes that spoil the vine and that was written a song a song it's the love book amen the love book the love letter the love letter says you must keep little sins out of our lives roast 11 the whole of Amen Church so that's that Jezebel religion on it I wasn't planning and say all that but that was good praise the Lord I like that and that's that's what we've got to watch out for these deeds see wheat and that's why we preach it over and over again we've got to keep Christ as our first love we got to keep Christ as our first up we got to make come into the house of God our most important thing as I preached recently though more wise you get in Christ the more preeminence you'll give Jesus the more with the more of your time you want to give to Christ because the wise redeem the time they take back the time and they invest their time and things of God amen so that's what we've got to do in this hour now let's go to Sardis let's skip skip on here by the grace of Lord what kind of set a timer here but let me just set timer I'll try to it I was telling my wife first on somebody else oh brother John I said I'll try to be done by 8:45 I will give us you know some time to sing and then worship but I want to go too late Sardis Sardis now finally thank God can you imagine finally after a thousand years people start protesting the Roman Catholic Church residence on the church age book finally after a thousand years people start saying ma this church is not exactly right now the true vine was always out right the true vine was always out but it kept shrinking shrieking shrieking shrieking but finally in the Sardis age people started thinking my must not I don't think it's right to steal and kill like that I don't think it's right to do indulgences you know I think it's right to you know pay the priest you can kill somebody I don't think that's right they finally because this was the age of restoration I'll say like this this was the age of springtime brother branham caused it they were in the winter in the Dark Ages and now we're starting to see signs of spring don't you wish we saw more signs of spring we'll see last time signs the winter it's a good type for this oh I thought spring was coming Sardis is the springtime oh it started to get us that's so cold in the mornings you know I can get out and walk around a little bit and go for a walk now right now but that's what the Reformation was right have said Reformation began with Luther he said men started to begin protesting the wickedness of the Roman Catholic Church after Martin Luther received and preached the revelation of I'm justified by faith I'm not justified by my works amen I'm justified because I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God I'm justified amen I'm righteous and now that I'm righteous what can I do that's good now right that's what when you get safe once you're saved you want to do good works but the other side is I'm just doing good works to try to be justified the other the right side is I'm saying now Lauren what can I do for you that's right that's that's the right approach brother Branham said that their churches broke from the false vine like Luther but eventually after Luther died the next generation they all went back to the mother and that's actually historical because history says they all got state financial support the church is needed to keep their churches going so they needed money from the government so even and that's what the best what Jesus said Jesus said they had a name that they live but were dead remember that that's what this church age is all about let me skip forward they have names but they're dead now Luther wasn't dead Church he was alive amen many of those men were alive but it was the generation after that that denominated again right brother Brahim said and I got to make a correction later brother Bramson Luther had the baptism of the Holy Ghost when I preached I said Luther didn't have the baptism Holy Ghost because of other quotes I kind of got some quotes mixed up so if I was wrong forgive me I still don't actually don't know the answer to that I I can't prove it you know what I mean I can't prove it because earlier in the Sardis Age I preached that you know they only had justification they didn't have Saint fication bats as Holy Ghost I preached that I remember Adam and Beau we're here and I appreciate I remember they were here but anyways I'm just letting you know I could be wrong on that because at the end of this chapter brother Branham says that Luther Wesley and Azusa all had the baptism Holy Ghost the people who were true to God which it could be I could be wrong like I said but I was just basing it off other quotes so you have quotes on both sides so I honestly don't know the answer at this point right now because remember Luther hated Jews and I don't see that I have a hard time or he didn't hate Jews but he said the Jews were the enemies to Christians and it actually caused some Jews to be persecuted so I don't see how somebody with the baptism holy ghost could say that I just don't know I don't know how that's possible so I'm just saying I don't know so could luther be born again he could be I don't know I just don't know how you could be born again and not like God's people the Jews I don't know I'm I don't know that's just I'm just saying I just don't know now just so you know again it was not Luther's age they I'm sorry not Luther's generation he had it right it was the next generation that organized and that was wrong now brother have said this is not an age of restoration it's an age of reformation he said this is springtime he says this is the little shoe of the seed that was playing that in the ground back here during the death of the church now it started shooting up this is the tassel and then this is the seed at the end so brother Graham said Luther was springtime that means Wesley what's summertime brother branham said when you get a lot of your good fruit summertime right when you harvest your food usually well it depends you have cold weather crops and warm weather crops but you harvest a lot of good stuff in the summertime right we got apples and peaches and all these great corn sweet corns right in the middle of the summer right how many love sweet corn so Luther was springtime romances Wesley was summertime and Moran said this is the age of the open door see all these souls being saved well Graham said this is the age where God flourished the number of believers more than any other age because it was a missionary age but member they'd have all the power because they were just getting the realization of the name of Jesus the open door was the name they're just starting to get that the power in Jesus name program said though the generations that followed Wesley organized and died and that set the stage for the daughters three turn back to the mother Rome in laodicea man what wisdom church this had to bend the Holy Ghost I mean this has to be the Holy Ghost and let me tell you why because my family some of some people my family they bought my children church history books you guys remember that Malick I'd remember the church history books that our family bought us there's like a series of seven or eight books remember that and talks about Constantine okay so my family members I believe they used to go to the Baptist Church I'm not sure what they go to now but they bought my children a a series it was basically the seven churches except through the eyes of the Baptist Church and they were praising Constantine for uniting the church and state praising him and they were praising everything Luther did which remember not everything it was good and that so that's the way the denomination sees the church ages they see oh it's a good thing Constantine is it's a good thing for the Roman Catholic Church it's a good thing for the Dark Ages good thing for the Crusades they see all that is good where we see the opposite we say that we see that is bad right and so we see all this return of denominations and I was even when that Trinity guy was emailing members attorney guy was he he never emailed me back when I said him that thought that remember you shared that shot thought with me he never emailed me back yeah that's he's still thinking about it but even he was saying see he said all these denominations are good because at least people had a Creed that they could believe and not be deceived but I thought what about the move of the Holy Ghost that was trying to show them the truth and get them away from a tradition and get them back to the word amen now program did say God use organizations and denominations for a little bit of time but after that he sent the Prophet to reveal the Word of God to everyone so see were the only ones really there's a couple of churches like apostolic the oneness apple stock that they believe this too but most people do not believe this most people see denominations as a good thing but we see it as daughters of the mother harlot and they're all going to be thrown into a bed together and burn the Bible said but like I said I have books for my family Baptist history that says all these things are good the dark ages Constantine the Council of Nicaea they don't see it as daughters of a mother and a bad sense they see it as a good sense well she's the mother she had good holy daughters but she's an evil woman right she's called Mystery Babylon she's the mother of abominations it's exactly right and so what a program called this well gee I'm sorry Jesus called it Jesus not brother Graham Jesus called this age the synagogue of Satan again remember how repeated brother Branham gave this illustration he said notice synagogues and Satan he said one two gave it three gave it three Church ages and then it was back again but this is the age of the open door amen well while Satan is establishing his own churches and denominations synagogue of Satan Jesus is open the door say come on into the rapture hey come on in the baptism of the Holy Ghost come into Jesus name in water baptism hallelujah that's right and now we're getting down to the end here praise the Lord can you believe this 59 sermons on the church can you believe that oh it's been I'm so happy it's kinda like if you finish a project you've been working on for years anybody got any projects you're working on for years out there this is like a project I've been working on for you Haven you got a project okay good praise the Lord Haven now Laodicea the last age now I got some thoughts up here I'm gonna go through these a little bit slower Luther with springtime Wesley with summer that means layer to see his harvest time this is the age of the harvest now program said there's not a great growth physically in harvest time how many can say amen to that you know that you've seen a fruit right before you pick it in the fall doesn't grow very much from summer to fall it's about the same size and program said that's exactly what's happening right now well the RAM said even the Falls Church their numbers aren't growing in fact if you I saw a recent study online and it said the church attendance in churches is falling nationwide even though the churches even I hate to say it like that but even the tear churches their numbers are declining it's not getting bigger and bigger and bigger now will it get bigger yes when they start putting money if you don't come to church we're gonna call if your ATM cards as soon as that happens you're gonna see a lot more people in their churches because the Bible said that take the mark of the beast they can't buy or sell anymore I'll go to church as long as I can have my money in my bank account that's the wrong reason to go to church you should go to church because you want to have a bank account in heaven amen you would have treasures in heaven amen but they only go to church you know and they can get their money in there their credit cards and ATM accounts ah but yeah church attendance is declining everywhere in America subra have said the same things true with the true line is our attendance skyrocketing here at Myra Christ fellowship no not really I want a round little message no every professor I talk to they're just trying to what they're trying to is just trying to train the young people up in the next generation because all their efforts they might win a soul here might win a soul here in the United States because member it's already been sowed over they might win a few souls here there but the main emphasis in America is the Train of these shouldn't try to get them saved before Satan gets to them amen try that's what I pray for my children up for every Sunday God fill him with the Holy Ghost help them to be sanctified God keep them from the grips of Satan I've already dedicated to Christ that don't mean I'm gonna give up praying I'm gonna pray even more hallelujah because I want Jesus to hear my prayers and I believe that he can't go over my prayers if I ask in his name Amen I'm just unbelieving like I said I can't guarantee my true gonna be safe but I'm gonna give it every effort I can to keep them safe and I had a good preacher one time tell me he said brother Jesse he said he told me this he had a future and I went wayward he said brother Jesse he said do everything with your children he said the mistake I made was that I didn't do more with my children he said I took too many preaching trips and left my children at home he said then when they got to be teenagers he said I let them hang out with questionable families in the church and they got introduced to pornography movies video games he said I should have what I should have done is then bring their friends over to my house that sound like godly wisdom right there absolutely he said everything you do do with your children don't let them go off and do some game you go with them but make sure it's a good game don't make it an unholy game make go play basketball with them or go play baseball with them go whatever be with them guard that like the Bible said guard your heart with all that you have amen guard the guard them guard your heart so see we have that responsibility we've got to train the young in the next generation we're not going to see much growth we'd say as far as great revival numbers because it's harvest time the seed doesn't get much bigger it's just it just change this member from the green stage to the yellow stage to the white stage remember that load the wheat the wheat seed has three stages in the first stage you can you can you can clip it and it bleeds milk the second stage you can rip the top part off but the third stage you put your fingernail on that thing it doesn't budge it's so solid you can't hurt it all and that's the kind of walk we need with Christ we need to be so solid that Satan's temptations can't hurt us at all amen oh yeah Satan can squeeze us all he wants and there's gonna come a squeeze yeah but it ain't gonna change us we're gonna be full word seed we're bride Christians amen the squeeze is just going to show what we are we're real Christians hallelujah amen it's exactly right not much growth during this time in fact what Jesus said it's fewer and fewer actually be saved as we go along let's preach on that and during the Philadelphia Church age program said the false seed will mature through false preachers but he said the true seed will mature through the message of the prophet of Malachi 4 5 and 6 he said the word of the Prophet will make the bride mighty inward and mighty in power amen I love that we're gonna be mighty in word and mighty in power how many can see the power of God already work in your life amen if it's not an outside miracles we're thank God for outside miracles when they happen but we should see the power of God on a daily basis in our lives overcoming sin death Helmand and the world overcoming this on a daily basis that's what we should see in our lives then the Prophet said the World Council of Churches is what is going to unite together the person the Antichrist will lead them although they won't envision it they won't they won't start out thinking he's going to lead them but eventually he'll take over because the woman Catholic Church rides the Beast and the World Council of Churches is the image erected to the Beast okay so the world counts the churches is the image and everybody's gonna see that's the organization but then that woman will ride that beast system the Roman Catholic Church will control that power and then the Prophet said then we'll see the maturation of the final fruit of both vines brother Branham said the mark in the hand is what I'm sorry the mark in the head is what the doctrine trinitarianism false baptisms women preachers all these false doctrines that's the mark in the head rabbana the mark in the hand is doing what the church wants you to do I know I'm reviewing these but it's part of that that's part of that chapter I thought I should review them and then he says remember this chapter is tracing those two spirits all the way down to the consummation and then he gets into the part we went over last week the beginning of this age and Laodicea was Azusa Street they sense in their spirits something told them this is the end so he started crying out to God send us powers than this power God answered amen after prayer means for February March God sent the Holy Ghost in April amen look at 3 don't worry just like the resurrection three days right so after a prayer means for February March and April God send the Holy Ghost away was the April 9th 1906 God sent the Holy Ghost or was April 13th I can't remember which one it was they thought it was the latter rain but we found out it couldn't be the latter rain because the former rain had not come yet which was the message of the hour former former in the Hebrew means teaching so the former rain is the teaching rain from the messenger and then the latter rain is rapturing faith from the Holy Ghost that's right in Wilbraham said remember there's two spirits there's Jesus of spirit and there's Judas his spirit there traced he said through the first four seals so let me get to that slide there the two spirits you've seen it before but these two spirits this period of Jesus is fighting the spirit of Satan in all four of these stages Jesus spirit was like a lion in the early days then it was an ox and it was a man now it's an eagle spirit a flying eagle or you're flying above denominations and the Creed's of man say in spirit went from white deception to red bloody to black ruling over the world in dark ages and now it's the pale spiritual death a sick it's so sick Jesus spits it out of his mouth right lukewarm is so is so pale and sick he spews them he don't talk through them anymore he'll talk through the bride because the spirit the brides they come that's right brother Branham said it is the spirit of Judas in the pale horse rider so the spirit of the Antichrist we'd say is the spirit of Judas it's one the same and notice he says this the person of the Antichrist will lead the world council of churches by his money just as Judas controlled the money bag oh what a good type there Judas held the money so the Antichrist will hold the gold of the world brother Branham says the gold the world all right now preaches most times but let's read it again because this is the this is the doctor and you're supposed to have I'm sorry this is the prophecy Joel 2:23 I preached it numerous times lately but I'm gonna keep preaching it until we live it that's includes me - Joel 2:23 brother Branham said these three these four scriptures are the prophecy thus saith the Lord it's going to happen before the rapture be glad then you turn it up sign and rejoice in the Lord your God so we should be happy rejoicing in Christ forgiving you the former rain monalee that's the prophets message and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in his first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the VAT shall overflow with wine and oil this is where he says the fullness of the Spirit will be in the bride all the wine all the oil all the wheat all the bread everything spiritually we have need of is supposed to be with us before the rapture amen that's right that's not saith the Lord and I'll restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the canker and the caterpillar of the poem and member these are the four horse riders right there the for insects same insect in four stages just like the four horse riders are the same demon power just four different stages amen so everything that had at Christ fear took away from the church we're supposed to get it back hallelujah that's why I get excited because I would live to see that I would have lived to see where the fullness of Pentecost is in this church amen and I so believe that that you remember when I preached on the keys of the door I preached on keys the door on December was at December 4 2016 remember I told people when they come up to the altar I said write it down what you prayed for it you remember that when I preached that it's okay if you don't remember that but I wrote it down and I was crying up there and I said the key to the door okay the key is the word I'll remember that the key is the word so this is the key I'm holding on it you probably don't see it but I'm holding on this key tonight and what I'm holding it on to is my hand the mother may have said you're holding on to at the hand of your and he said you're only as strong with the key as your faith is with the Word of God that's why I said yeah I'm praying I'm gonna see this key open the door in my lifetime where this church we see the fullness of Pentecost in this church what does that mean really just that means that when God wants to do a miracle he can do it because all the sin is purged out of our church right and I said that's the key I said I want Lord I said I want those two promises I want the full of full of the Pentecost and the bride and I prayed for another family too that would come to the church they haven't come yet but I'm still praying for them I just asked God I didn't I just was hoping God would bring that family to the church but see we're supposed to have it restored it's supposed to be given back to us restored the great army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty that's what I'm saying we should be happy when we eat on the Word of God we should have plenty to eat on with the Word of God and be satisfied we should be satisfied with the word and praise the name of the Lord your God who had dealt wonderous Lee with you and my people shall never be ashamed we won't be ashamed to be Holy Ghost Oh Christians hey hallelujah we won't be ashamed we'll be so thankful how God has worked in our lives God you have worked wonderfully with my life you've kept me from such evil you've kept me from all my temptations you have one nurse Lee dealt with me that's what the bride's gonna have that's thus saith the Lord it's not enough save me it's thus saith the Lord does that help by God's grace I know I preach that probably five or six times in the last two years I preached out a lot but listen that's the prophecy we have to fulfill like when brother Darrell preached that it's me it's me what's me that Joel too is me Joel too is you that's you that's what you're supposed to be that's what I'm supposed to be I'm supposed to be satisfied with the things of God I'm supposed to rejoice in the Lord my God I'm supposed to enjoy all the wine all the oil and all the wheat I can possibly have oh oh glory amen thank you Jesus now you got your Bible well you've got it memorized brother ban would close to this part by saying Mathew 24:24 is in complete fulfillment right now so I'm gonna read that for you mo so you could probably you can probably finish it after I started so let's see I'll give you a test and we ready for a pop quiz tonight Matthew 24 I don't give them at school I just I just gave my church Matthew 24:24 I'll start it you finish it for there shall rise good false Christ good and false false prophets good false Christ's and false prophets good and shall show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were they should have Siva all right give yourselves run you pass the test glory but see it's got like with this is I know how this is how you feel I want it in my head but I also want to in my heart because any preacher out there I anybody can have anywhere in their heart but this is the word where we gotta say this is me it's written on my heart and I'm gonna manifest this prophesy amen glory it's a great job on your pop quiz tonight program said this isn't complete fulfillment right now and look around you see how the big the big TV preachers with all kinds of money they have miracles I was reading on one of the I'll just say it Joel scenes website and his testimony page has many healings on that page many but yet he said I'll go to a homosexual wedding and support a homosexual now Church see that see the deception that the anointing falls on him while he's preaching and people get saved well I don't know maybe but I know one thing they get healed and I've seen videos where people have driven across the country to come to his church shake his hand and some thank you for a preacher I got healed by your preaching the anointing falls on the just and the unjust but yet he'll go to a homosexual wedding and say it's okay for a man to marry man it's okay for a woman to marry where marry woman that's fine and he says I don't preach on that because I don't want to cause division in the church well that's what Jesus said I come to divide your family I don't come to bring peace now he gives peace in you but he said I don't come to bring peace in your family I come to bring a sword in your family so see he's preaching a different Jesus right he's got some things right about Jesus but there's other parts and don't really line up with Jesus on it and I think he's a fine he's a probably fine man but if he don't take a sin against sin he's gonna answer for that on the day of judgment just like me if I don't think I stayed on sin I'll answer on the day of judgment I'm not picking on preachers I'm not jealous of him I mean I'm happy he's got money but that can be a big snare if you're not careful that can be a big snare what we need is not more money we need more of the Holy Ghost that's what we need amen to keep all the sin out and then do miracles and save people we just need more of the Holy Ghost but see they have partial Holy Ghost but not all the Holy Ghost that's complete fulfillment today false Christ false prophets rising up among you and it's so deceptive that they deceived the very lected if it were possible that's in fulfilling right now now look can I let me read you this here brother Bram said these false preachers will listen outshine he said outshine the elect in effort and zeal no let me ask you this question how much effort have you given to feed the poor you say well I maybe did this to that let me show you one of my friends is in denominational Church and he runs marathons to get sponsors and had they just their group just raised a million dollars to send food to Africa and to dig wells in Africa where they don't have clean water now who gave more effort to the poor the message churches or denominational churches the church said they gave way more effort than we did right prove it well I will prove it they gave thousands of their own dollars so they gave more money than we did and they ran a 26.2 mile marathon they gave a lot more effort and brother Graham said they're gonna have more effort and zeal than we have he said but it's the wrong zeal amen Lori just like the Jews they have a lot of zeal for Moses but they got the wrong zeal because now Christ is our Moses with me church brother band says the false church is going to outshine you in effort and in zeal but it's not about natural effort it's not about natural zeal it's about holy go seal amen because that same guy will wear shorts when he runs the race brother Adam and he'll wear a tank top showing off his big muscles the same guy and then they'll have women painting face with makeup showing off their chests running in a race cause some brothers so I wonder how many brothers look over there and during the race lust after them and commit adultery while they're doing it but who's got more effort and zeal they do naturally but what about you you've got spiritual you got spiritual CIA men and let me tell you this church listen you you put forth more spiritual effort to crucify the lusts of the flesh than they ever did Amen somebody ought to be saying Amen out there I just told you you're not giving effort like them but now I told you you're giving more effort than them you're giving more effort spiritually to crucify the lusts of the flesh than they ever give to crucify their lusts of the flesh Amen I just said you don't have as much zeal and effort now I'm saying you have more zeal and more effort spiritual zeal and effort are you with me Church that's why I've got to make sure I don't feel bad I went to remember I told you went to my students game on Saturday at this fancy Church in Fairlawn it's a huge mega church in Fairlawn and they were showing how they sent twenty thousand meals to Africa last year twenty thousand and I felt bad for a moment for a moment and then I watched all those women walk down the the mothers of all the people the children playing basketball i watch them all walk down with high heels on i wants to mark with high heels on and their skin tight jeans on and they're paying up faces and cut hair and I wonder hum and then they're showing off their cleavage I wonder how many of those women are they sending those men to hell praise the Lord and if they don't repent they're gonna answer for exposing themselves so I felt bad for a moment and I think of this quote now those churches are going to blow us away in natural effort and zeal naturally but by the grace of God we will have more effort and zeal in the spiritual side there's my time does every wonder standing I'm not trying to make you feel bad I hope you understand they have more physical and natural effort zeal we have more spiritual zeal and more spiritual effort when you're down there on your knees Church and your prayer closet god help me not to give in to this money temptation help me not to give in this lust and help me not to give and you're preying on these and yet they get they don't have to do that they got they could just do whatever they you know Oh God will forgive me God Oh forgive me who's given more effort you're giving more effort amen will you come to church faithfully three times a week and you don't care how hard the preacher preaches you just say let Jesus's word be preached amen but they won't come to church unless it tickles their ears Oh fine he won't preach what I like I'll go to some other church I'll change my ranks and I'll go to the Methodist tonight or I'll go to the the the Canton church or the the Canton mega church I'll go to that mega church down in 77 they won't preach what I like you see but you just keep coming back for hard sermon after hard sermon because it's Christ words it's because you love Jesus Christ and you know Jesus Christ is the word amen hallelujah so don't feel bad that we don't send 20,000 meals overseas to Africa we can't we can't do that we don't have the plane to do that they have all kinds of resources and millions and millions of dollars pumping into theirs we have you know maybe three thousand dollars a month and a 1200 that goes to rent Church some months four thousand I'll show you the finances if you'd like me to show you the money heads but see God's not after the number he's after the quality he's never been after big numbers and he's after the quality of the number just like you do you want to do you just want the cheapest and you're the cheapest pair of shoes or do you want a quality pair of shoes it's gonna last you longer you want the cheap cheap jacket or you want a jacket that's gonna last you you want quality because you know if you get a cheap one you just got to get another one a few months later right more and more and more and more money you know you want quality and that's how God is he wants quality and his wife you don't want to pretend wife that can produce all like Vashti you know just be pretty on the outside but not have real character he wants to Esther he wants a star of God he wasn't somebody who shines the light of God hey man let me close I'm going over again here here we go praise the Lord you love the Lord tonight I just you know have all these ideas and I'm just trying to follow the idea of the holy spirit help me Jesus brother branham said how do you know that the effort zeal is false he said because they go after big crowds look after big churches big money and then they brag online and they brag on Facebook and they brag on their church signs of how much they gave away where Jesus said real giving is giving in secret and Jesus said giving two mites 3/8 of a penny if that's all you have giving 3/8 of a penny it's more than giving a million dollars if that's just your extra money see God's looking at the quality of what you do how many love the Lord I love a God like that he's not looking at the amount he's looking at the quality of what you give sincerity secrecy private giving humble giving humility God's looking for humility and brother Branham said here's another thing he said they won't preach on controversial subjects because it'll deplete their crowd and their less money that's why Joel Osteen and other preachers won't preach about homosexuality it will decrease their numbers whereas that's about all we preaches controversial things right yeah I've had people visit you know and I had a brother remember Steve Alexander never remember Steve Alexander he used to come here Malachi okay he's a big tall skinny guy he kind of exhaustion you know physical problems you know he brought some of his preacher friends one time over when we were at the wilder church and I was preaching on the three works of grace and he couldn't I started off with justification he was looking at me pretty good but pretty soon when I got into sanctification and the baptism all he goes he got real stiff on me and we talked afterwards and he said well he said I kind of understood some of the things you said and he's a rope he's a real smart guy he's he's a teacher that one of the chapel churches over here and he said but I'll have to look up that Wesley and Zuza and random thing off they look back that look at that get back to you and he never got back to me I don't have his number I'll somebody got back to him he didn't want me to have his number in fact he sent me a text saying don't keep my number he actually took me that into text he didn't want to contact me but see that's what they don't want to preach on controversial things and that shows we do love God because God's Word in its purity is controversial to them but to us its purity to us there's no controversy about it it's the plain truth amen it's just if that's what it says believe it it's God's Word amen what do you mean sanctify I can't smoke and can't wear high heels and what do you care the Bible says you don't tinkle on these you know the Bible says these things but it's too controversial we don't want to split our church let the church be split let the chips fall where they may the true children of God will never leave the Word of God amen that's encouraging me amen small Church that's fine oh we love it we just want people here that are in the right ranks hallelujah we don't want goat amongst our sheep we don't want wolves amongst our sheep do we Paul cried because wolves would come against or come amongst the Sheep Paul cried and here's the last thing Miriam says whenever the false churches these false tainted churches whenever they get cornered on a false doctrine where they're wrong let's say father and only ghost I'm trying to close mercy or Trinity whenever they get cornered their last excuse is well we get results don't we so we must be of God and that's what churches say today well we help the we have the poor in Africa we're saving all these souls or we get we get healings on our website there's testimony people we get results God must be with us so where does it come down to they don't even they can't even ascertain the true spirit of God from the false spirit they think the true spirit of God that heals their sick and save souls and save people from dying they think that same spirit lets them watch dirty movies cut their hair cuss and smoke and do all these evil things that the Bible says is wrong they have so little understanding they can't even discern the two spirits but thank God we can discern the two spirits in the framework of the church let's stay on our feet alright last thing this is the I'm gonna read the last paragraph of the book if you haven't read it read it not for one moment do I brother branham bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I've never done that and I will not do that now I have no interest in doing those things but I do have an interest in the things of God in people and if I can accomplish just one thing I'll be satisfied who knows what brother Graham wanted to accomplish the one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men amen that's one reason why I love brother Branham brother Branham never point himself come to my church remember they all want to join his church he said go where the Holy Spirit lead you he never said start an organization and follow William Graham call the Branham organization he never said that that's why I love brother brand that's why I know he's a true man of God he never said you've got to follow me to be saved you got to follow me to do this you got to follow me he never pointed to himself he only pointed to Christ his whole goal writing this book or preaching what this is 381 pages the whole goal writing this book is so that you can have a spiritual relationship between God and yourself in other words you can discern the fall spirit this is not a relationship with Jesus and this is a relationship with Jesus and that's what this whole chapter was about tracing these two spirits through the church the one thing I want to see is establishes a true spirits relationship between God and men wearing men become new creatures in Christ filled with the spirit and live according to his word I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to even as I trust in my heart I have given my all to him god bless you and may his coming rejoice your heart let's get a lawyer on the law they met hallelujah Jesus thank you lord oh my thank you Jesus that's why we know he's a man of God he wasn't trying to say oh you better if you leave my church if you don't read the church age book you're going to hell you know he said as I've tried to do is get you to feel like you have a true relationship between God and yourself that you can no I'm not of the false church I'm not of the Antichrist I am of the true spirit of Christ how many thankful you're part of the true spirit of Christ how many are thankful that the message has come and now you feel like you know who God is that's the whole point of this message was to help us to know Christ and him crucified and in knowing him and his crucifixion then the power of the Holy Ghost comes into you and then you become a part of the true church Heavenly Father thank you for tonight lord thank you for your Holy Spirit Lord God thank you for the grace you give me these last three years to preach this series I know he took a year off
