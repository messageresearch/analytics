[31:28] break your word we never wanted to do
[31:29] that we want to stand still Lord and let

[31:41] thus saith the Lord your God that's what
[31:43] the bride is called to do she's called

[32:23] break into your people of each one of us
[32:26] Lord God to receive it and we'll give
[32:28] you all the glory as we leave this place
[32:29] in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen let's
[32:33] take our Bibles here let's go to Isaiah
[32:34] chapter 14 verse 27 we'd like to start
[32:40] there I'm sorry verse 24
[32:42] kind of an odd text I've never really
[32:44] read out of Isaiah before but I just
[32:48] kind of want to read a few scriptures so
[32:54] Isaiah 14:24 I like to look
[32:59] purpose again tonight this is part three
[33:01] a purpose it's been a few weeks since we
[33:03] looked at purpose I've been kind of
[33:05] looking at other topics of course you
[33:08] know like numerology and the book of
[33:10] Revelation I like to look at purpose
[33:13] again tonight by God's grace sister
[33:15] Brenna's good to see without the cane
[33:16] again praise the Lord and uh miss
[33:18] scooter there let's just thank the Lord
[33:19] for that praise God surely you're an
[33:23] example of standing still and letting
[33:24] God move so I just thought that was
[33:28] inspiring you're a real inspiration to a
[33:30] sister Brenda we appreciate amen hahaha
[33:33] it is God's grace let's just thank the
[33:35] Lord for God's grace amen
[33:36] that's beautiful that's beautiful
[33:39] praise God I don't think I ever forget
[33:42] that when you walked in and said I had
[33:43] my Holy Ghost experience I was beautiful
[33:47] praise God thank the Lord
[33:50] Isaiah 14:24 I'm gonna take a little bit
[33:55] about way to look at purpose tonight you
[34:00] know what I did is I went through the
[34:01] whole Bible and looked at the word
[34:02] purpose all the way through the Bible
[34:03] and then you know I read that Purpose
[34:06] Driven Life and I looked at all the
[34:08] times brother Branham said serve your
[34:09] purpose so with all these thoughts I'm
[34:11] just trying to kind of pull them
[34:12] together to maybe preach a few different
[34:15] thoughts that have kind of stood out to
[34:16] me as I've prepared and studied and so
[34:19] forth I'm not gonna look at the clock
[34:23] tonight and I'm just gonna preach
[34:24] tonight you know then we'd have a
[34:25] service this morning we can just be here
[34:27] all night
[34:28] of course I don't think I'll take you
[34:30] all night but as they have 1424 it's so
[34:34] good to be in the house of Lord see the
[34:36] saints of God for these guys it's always
[34:37] too long in between the times you see
[34:39] the real saints of God Isaiah 14:24
[34:44] the Lord of Hosts has sworn saying
[34:46] surely as I have thought so shall it
[34:48] come to pass and as I have purposed so
[34:52] shall it stand then I will break the
[34:55] Assyrian in my land and upon my
[34:58] mountains tread him underfoot then shall
[35:02] his yoke depart from off them and his
[35:05] burden depart from off their shoulders
[35:08] the
[35:09] is the purpose that is purpose upon the
[35:12] whole earth and this is the hand that
[35:16] has stretched out upon all the nations
[35:18] may God as blessing it was reading of
[35:21] his word you may be seated
[35:27] kind of a strange text there you know
[35:29] and brother Branham of course we know it
[35:31] he says it's not so much in the amount
[35:33] of what you read or even in even in how
[35:36] many words you read it matters what you
[35:38] read and so my thought behind this was
[35:41] in verse 26 and Lydia I do have some
[35:44] quotes to go through about this is the
[35:46] purpose that is purposed upon the whole
[35:47] earth so I like to look at some of these
[35:51] thoughts here tonight if I had it like a
[35:53] little subtopic and being driven it's at
[35:56] the top driven to purpose and driven by
[35:58] purpose so I'm gonna get to that at the
[36:01] end Lord willing but I want to start off
[36:03] just by looking at a few thoughts about
[36:05] God's purpose that he's doing right now
[36:07] upon the whole earth maybe review some
[36:09] of those things that he's doing but as
[36:12] you know maybe you haven't thought about
[36:14] it lately or maybe you have first God
[36:17] God has to drive us to our purpose and
[36:20] you can see it with almost every
[36:22] character in the Bible it almost like
[36:23] God has to orchestrate all these events
[36:25] to drive them in order to get to their
[36:28] purpose and then once they know their
[36:31] purpose in life that purpose drives them
[36:34] the rest of their days amen so if you
[36:37] haven't seen that hopefully by the end
[36:38] of this message you'll be able to see
[36:40] that because brother mayhem talks about
[36:42] it and of course the Bible speaks of it
[36:44] as well now remember the word purpose
[36:46] means intent God has an intention God
[36:50] has a purpose for each and every one of
[36:52] us so we read our text there I didn't
[36:55] read all the way to 28 but we remember
[36:56] in part one on New Year's Eve we looked
[36:58] at your purpose starts in God whenever
[37:01] God has called you for whatever
[37:03] intention God has it has to be first in
[37:06] his word which was course was in his
[37:08] mind and your purpose must be found in
[37:11] God and we saw how brother Branham that
[37:13] knew his purpose being a Eliezer
[37:16] his purpose on the three poles his
[37:18] purpose to heal the sick all of his
[37:21] purposes he could all find
[37:23] in the Word of God and then we saw how
[37:25] David found his purpose was to rule
[37:28] Israel was the lead Israel well that was
[37:30] his purpose
[37:31] it was beyond killing Goliath there was
[37:33] more to his purpose than just defeating
[37:35] a giant God had a more of a purpose than
[37:38] that and that's how it is for us we have
[37:40] more than just you know one or two great
[37:42] events in our life there's a greater
[37:44] purpose beyond just maybe one great
[37:46] great thing of being saved or one seen
[37:49] one miracle there's a purpose behind
[37:51] that and God wants us to be kings and
[37:53] priests on the earth amen
[37:55] and then part two we saw how God planned
[37:58] your purpose this was all planned out
[38:00] before the foundation of the world so
[38:03] today I want to look at just this
[38:05] thought of being driven to your purpose
[38:07] and then your purpose drives you but I
[38:10] want to first look at the global purpose
[38:12] you know we looked at our text in Isaiah
[38:14] 14 and and God said my whole purpose on
[38:18] the earth right now is to destroy
[38:21] Assyria now the Assyrian army had just
[38:26] started ruling recently and this was and
[38:29] jerry' and Isaiah says this in 712 BC
[38:33] and according to you know history the
[38:36] next major ruling was Babylon and so
[38:40] history says we'll get to this in a
[38:42] moment about matthew henry and some of
[38:44] the history that he writes but but God
[38:46] pronounces this that I'm that my whole
[38:49] purpose right now on the earth is to
[38:50] bring Assyria down so he was raising up
[38:53] Babylon and and according to history
[38:56] would be 200 years before this would
[38:59] come to pass so God doesn't always move
[39:02] like that and God pronounced it through
[39:06] a prophet and everybody thinks well this
[39:09] guy's off his rocker how is the Assyrian
[39:10] ever gonna fall see cuz that they never
[39:13] seen a Babylon before they never seen
[39:17] that
[39:17] but God was gonna raise it up and so God
[39:20] was going to use 200 years to move Kings
[39:23] down and raise Kings up and to move up
[39:25] armies and pulled out armies and he was
[39:27] gonna do it it was going to take some
[39:29] time but the Word of God would be
[39:32] accomplished praise the Lord his purpose
[39:35] that he purposed Saul
[39:36] the whole earth would be accomplished
[39:39] and this is the next few scriptures for
[39:42] the Lord of a hose had purpose it who
[39:44] shall dissin all it if God has intended
[39:47] something to happen there's no man
[39:49] that's going to stop it from happening
[39:51] his hand is stretched out and who shall
[39:53] turn it back in the year that King Ahaz
[39:56] died was this burden see everything in
[39:58] earth was working for God's purpose to
[40:01] break me assyrian oak but of course if
[40:03] you know if they walked outside their
[40:05] homes and they would see the Assyrian
[40:07] soldiers and they would see the armies
[40:08] and think well I don't know if Isaiah he
[40:10] might have just might that might have
[40:12] just been Isaiah preaching today when he
[40:14] said God was gonna destroy Assyria you
[40:17] know the same thing happened like and
[40:18] when brother Branham was here people
[40:19] might hurt himself
[40:20] California's gonna fall in the ocean
[40:22] they thought well he just no yeah right
[40:24] like that'll ever happen or you know
[40:27] they might have heard him say different
[40:29] things and and not really had a
[40:30] spiritual understanding like brother
[40:32] Branham said he said thus saith the Lord
[40:34] they'll never come a greater ministry
[40:35] than the ministry you've seen in my
[40:37] ministry and people thought early in the
[40:39] next 56 years you know spent six years
[40:41] since been off these 54 years since but
[40:45] man went off the scenes surely oh surely
[40:46] somebody will raise up all she does is
[40:48] discern the sick
[40:49] and church there's never been a greater
[40:51] one raised up since oh yeah amen they
[40:56] might have thought oh come on he's just
[40:57] speaking out the side of his you know
[40:59] tongue-in-cheek or something like that
[41:00] if it's God's Word
[41:02] there's no man that can dis annul it
[41:04] God's Word is going to stand amen and
[41:08] see everything was working behind the
[41:10] scenes and God was going to accomplish
[41:11] everything that he complan the earth now
[41:14] just to give you an idea here Isaiah was
[41:16] this one went out in 700 what was it 712
[41:21] so Isaiah had said this around 712 that
[41:24] Assyria was going to be broke look it
[41:26] wasn't even in the middle of their of
[41:28] their time of ruling and yet God is
[41:31] already foretelling
[41:32] this is what I'm doing upon the whole
[41:34] earth amen and it was going to come to
[41:37] pass
[41:37] God was going to raise up a Babylon and
[41:39] it wasn't even actually going to be it
[41:41] even though it was a head of gold
[41:42] it wasn't even going to last as long as
[41:44] the Persian Empire see God knows what
[41:47] he's doing and we want what we must do
[41:49] is we must hear the word
[41:50] the profit we must hear thus say the
[41:52] Lord and just stay with it praise God
[41:55] and not get distracted and not getting
[41:57] discouraged and not getting defeated but
[42:00] became confidence in Revelation that
[42:03] whatever God said it's going to come to
[42:05] pass amen
[42:08] we'll look at some more scriptures from
[42:09] Isaiah Jeremiah and Daniel we know how
[42:11] these all kind of went together but
[42:14] God's purpose if it was accomplished
[42:16] those 3,000 years ago
[42:18] surely church God's purpose is going to
[42:20] be accomplished today hallelujah
[42:23] if scholars look at the Bible over and
[42:25] they can put a date on Isaiah and then a
[42:27] date on this and the date on that if
[42:29] they can put dates on these things and
[42:31] see that God's words come to pass then
[42:32] surely that we can have confidence in
[42:34] every single time God said thus saith
[42:37] the Lord
[42:37] hallelujah see it was going to happen it
[42:42] was going to be accomplished but the
[42:45] people just needed to have patience and
[42:47] understand that God's purpose was going
[42:49] to be accomplished praise God so see
[42:52] matthew henry said the destruction of
[42:54] Babylon and the Chaldeans Empire was the
[42:57] thing at a great distance the Empire not
[43:00] risen to any considerable height when
[43:01] it's fall here was foretold it was
[43:03] almost two hundred years from this
[43:05] prediction of babylons fall to the
[43:07] accomplishment of it and again it's only
[43:09] been fifty year four years since brother
[43:11] Branham passed off the scene see people
[43:15] are and people already get coal we know
[43:17] a lot of people have left you know the
[43:19] message and things like that because of
[43:20] their own understandings or their own
[43:22] interpretations of what they think
[43:24] brother Branham said but the reality of
[43:27] it is that this hasn't been a very small
[43:29] little we'd say air puff right it's just
[43:32] been a very small vapor since God's
[43:34] prophet was here and God is working
[43:36] everything for his own good praise the
[43:39] Lord
[43:39] now remember brother Han tells us here
[43:41] the times of the Gentiles with I don't
[43:44] have a picture but the statue of the
[43:45] Gentiles we're at the feet with the very
[43:48] feet here we're not the iron and clay
[43:50] praise God
[43:51] we're at the Catholic and Protestant and
[43:53] it's exactly right it's right where it
[43:56] has to be and it's it's still in this
[43:59] area and and we know the Catholic Church
[44:01] has got to get stronger and the
[44:03] nominations and
[44:04] politics have to get stronger we're
[44:06] right where we have to be everything's
[44:09] working out just like Daniels mission
[44:10] said amen
[44:11] Daniel's mission is almost 2500 years
[44:14] old and it's still exactly right it's
[44:17] still working out and we just got to
[44:19] find our position in Christ in this hour
[44:21] amen the worlds are falling away they're
[44:24] getting more weak and all the time more
[44:26] deceived all the time but we've got to
[44:28] be getting more holy more in tune with
[44:30] God's Spirit we got to be more obedient
[44:32] we got to be more ready for the coming
[44:33] of the Lord
[44:34] ha ha ha hallelujah now remember this is
[44:39] also part of it Jesus said that's why
[44:42] you gather up the tares ye root up the
[44:43] wheat also let both grow together until
[44:45] the harvest and the time of harvest I'll
[44:49] say the Reapers gather together first
[44:51] the tares and bind them in bundles to
[44:53] burn them but gather the wheat in my
[44:55] barn you know we've got to let the tares
[44:58] grow we've got a we've got it it's hard
[45:01] right as hard as we said on Wednesday
[45:03] it's hard to see the abortion law passed
[45:05] in New York but I read earlier this week
[45:06] that one's already been passed like that
[45:09] New Mexico
[45:10] I mean they've already had them the
[45:12] tails are just gonna grow they love
[45:14] murder they love death they love sin and
[45:17] they've just we just got to let them
[45:18] grow we got to pray against sin and
[45:20] speak out against it but in one way we
[45:22] just gotta let them grow but at the same
[45:25] time we're growing amen
[45:27] they're gonna let us grow hallelujah
[45:30] God's gonna let the bride growing then
[45:32] grow up into the Word of God hallelujah
[45:35] it's exactly right I know if you saw but
[45:38] I saw another news article - but Iowa
[45:41] just passed a good law to protect babies
[45:44] longer so see how that people that are
[45:47] all sinful are all all over thank god
[45:49] there's a couple out there that still
[45:50] care about life mine and you know it's
[45:53] not just Democrat Republican because
[45:54] Church Republican had Republicans
[45:57] recently just had the house and the
[45:58] Senate and they could have passed a law
[46:00] against abortion right they could have
[46:01] tried to stop it but they didn't because
[46:04] many of them it's just a it's just a
[46:06] political thing just to get votes from
[46:08] the Conservatives then when they get an
[46:10] office they don't do nothing about it
[46:11] see when you find somebody who's got
[46:13] some action behind their word than you
[46:15] then you got somebody that's actually
[46:17] worth maybe voting for
[46:18] right because it's not even the
[46:21] Republicans gonna change it in the last
[46:22] two years but they did it so see it's us
[46:25] it's not about politics it's about the
[46:27] Word of God amen
[46:28] our confidence is not in politics anyway
[46:30] it's in Christ Jesus praise God
[46:33] see we gotta let both grow together
[46:34] remember brother an tells us plainly in
[46:36] 62 it's binding time now that's the time
[46:39] that it is just like it was time where
[46:42] God was going to take down Assyria there
[46:44] in the days of Isaiah it's binding time
[46:46] now he said that every every council
[46:49] world council council churches every
[46:51] denomination polling right into the big
[46:53] thing going on all of them coming back
[46:55] to Rome just as they promised an image
[46:57] made into the Beast a power
[46:58] Confederation of Churches just exactly
[47:01] what God said would come to pass now
[47:03] while they're uniting brother Bram said
[47:05] God's uniting with his bride she's
[47:07] coming together from the east and the
[47:09] west and north of the south
[47:10] this is uniting time and that's all
[47:12] right now
[47:14] glory see they're both growing together
[47:17] that's why I like the unite with you and
[47:19] you you're not with me we used to put
[47:21] our faith together we just unite with
[47:23] God's Word we just come from every
[47:24] direction and we just come together and
[47:26] we rally around God's Word glory what's
[47:30] uniting forth the rapture she's God's
[47:32] getting her ready that's right what's
[47:34] she writing with the word so we just
[47:37] unite rolling this word in order to be
[47:39] united for the rapture praise God for
[47:42] all heavens and earth shall pass away
[47:43] but my words will never pass away
[47:45] she's uniting herself with thus saith
[47:48] the Lord
[47:48] regardless of what any denomination or
[47:50] anybody else says she's uniting herself
[47:53] she's getting ready why she is the bride
[47:55] she's United herself with her bridegroom
[47:57] see the bridegroom is the word in the
[47:59] beginning was the word the Word was with
[48:00] God the Word was God and the Word was
[48:02] made flesh and dwelt among us and the
[48:04] church and bride and the word is
[48:06] becoming so on until the very word
[48:08] itself is working out the work of the
[48:11] bridegroom so as the word works in us
[48:15] then we do what Jesus wants us to do
[48:17] finish the Great Commission praise God
[48:20] you see a uniting not no more join the
[48:22] church no more this book flee from
[48:24] everything and tied to Jesus Christ see
[48:26] it's uniting time God uniting his bride
[48:29] together bringing it back just exactly
[48:30] uniting the world
[48:32] of his promise hallelujah look this is
[48:37] all God is bringing all this together
[48:39] God is working on a global scale right
[48:41] now he's bringing me he's letting the
[48:44] tears grow up
[48:45] he's watering the tears he's also water
[48:47] in the weekday men hallelujah
[48:50] they live off the same anointing we do
[48:52] all you got to do is turn on you do it
[48:54] and type in you know some worship songs
[48:56] and you see them they're got cut hit
[48:58] women cut their hair the men men got
[49:00] long hair they all got makeup on men and
[49:02] women they got they all got their
[49:03] clothes off and they're all rejoicing
[49:06] and shouting under God's anointing and
[49:07] that's what's keeping them alive and
[49:10] here we are we live holy we live like
[49:13] the Bible said and we rejoice under the
[49:15] worship to praise God amen
[49:17] we're both living under the same water
[49:19] but the life is different because it's
[49:22] different seed I thank God for the seed
[49:24] of the word the Bible said it's the
[49:26] incorruptible seed the Word of God
[49:28] hallelujah but look when Jesus comes
[49:32] back this is arm again the Bible said
[49:34] all Kindred's of the earth shall wail
[49:36] because of him see this is what it's
[49:40] leading up to this is not just a serious
[49:42] going down now we have a new leadership
[49:44] when Jesus the part we're at now the
[49:47] purpose of the whole earth now is so
[49:49] Jesus can let give everybody a chance
[49:51] but then when he comes back they're
[49:54] gonna wail because he's so holy but this
[49:58] is what we're building up to you he's
[49:59] got to let them get hold unholy unholy
[50:02] wicked wicked so that when he comes back
[50:04] it scares them not that he wants to do
[50:07] it but he's trying to give them a chance
[50:09] he's giving them mercy after mercy think
[50:11] of this decade after decade a year after
[50:14] year giving them chances to receive the
[50:16] Word of God
[50:17] now all everybody on the earth almost
[50:19] all they have to do is type in their
[50:21] phone and they can hear preaching about
[50:22] Christ if they just got an internet
[50:25] connection God is trying to get to them
[50:27] through the internet he's trying to get
[50:28] through them to live preachers he's
[50:30] doing everything giving them every
[50:31] chance they can because they'll answer
[50:33] on the day of judgment this is God's
[50:35] time of mercy God is so gracious but
[50:38] when he comes back all the world will
[50:40] wail see we won't wail because we'll be
[50:43] feasting at the marriage supper of the
[50:44] Lamb
[50:46] hallelujah how do you know we're just
[50:49] cuz right now I'm feasting at his table
[50:51] now amen
[50:52] I'm not feasting at the devil's table
[50:54] these tables this this preaching is not
[50:56] tables filled with vomit you can turn on
[50:59] any denominational service and see that
[51:01] that's what they're preaching like I was
[51:03] listening to a you know somebody just
[51:05] one of the well one of the churches the
[51:07] mega churches in the area just had a
[51:08] Lincoln House you know finishing up my
[51:10] day on and I just thought well I'll
[51:12] check Facebook one more time people were
[51:13] texting me and and then I thought well
[51:15] I'll just I'll just I'll just skip to
[51:17] the end of this service of a mega church
[51:18] and Akron and see what they're preaching
[51:20] on and they're preaching on the prodigal
[51:22] son which is a good topic to preach on
[51:24] but in the midst of that they're saying
[51:26] that it's okay to get tattoos and
[51:28] they're laughing and and all these
[51:29] things and see and and see that's a
[51:32] perversion and they're laughing about
[51:34] like it's okay and then they're immoral
[51:37] and so see Church that's not what we
[51:40] feast on that's a table filled with
[51:42] vomit defiling the bodies no holiness no
[51:46] regard for the word and there's no
[51:49] Christian maturity to understand that
[51:51] your body is not just a finger it's not
[51:54] your us not even yours amen it's the
[51:56] temple of the Holy Ghost amen
[51:58] it's not something to joke about when
[52:00] you defy your body your devotees
[52:02] supposed to glorify Jesus Christ amen
[52:06] but there's no maturity there's no
[52:08] understanding it's without understanding
[52:10] but our tables have the real food of God
[52:13] at our table amen it's not saith the
[52:16] Lord thank you Jesus see he's got to get
[52:20] to the spot where this comes this hour
[52:22] of temptation and all of the world will
[52:25] be tempted in an hour to take the mark
[52:26] of the beast that's the time we're
[52:28] living that's God's purpose he's trying
[52:30] to save what he can and the rest are
[52:32] just getting further and further away
[52:34] and he's got to lay down the mark he's
[52:37] gotta let Satan rather lay down the mark
[52:40] the Bible said the Great Dragon was cast
[52:42] out in Revelation 12 that old serpent
[52:44] the devil Satan which deceiveth the
[52:46] whole world he was cast out into the
[52:48] earth and his angels were cast out with
[52:49] him see this is the time where this is
[52:51] the binding time they're being bound to
[52:54] their deception they love to be deceived
[52:56] the Bible said they love having teachers
[52:59] we'll tickle their ears can you imagine
[53:00] if I to feather and I just was like this
[53:02] too brother amen I was a other tickling
[53:06] his ear like that and I went around just
[53:08] tickling and making everybody feel good
[53:09] trying to get you to laugh Oh what kind
[53:12] of preacher would that be that'd be a
[53:14] jelly jelly fish creature with no
[53:16] backbone we don't even know and I hope
[53:18] it's okay I mean it's really tickle your
[53:19] ear buddy so sorry about that
[53:21] I know hopefully I didn't tickle but
[53:24] that's not that's not why we're here
[53:26] we're not here to be tickled in here all
[53:28] good we are but instead we come here for
[53:30] one purpose to find our weaknesses and
[53:33] low spots that we can better serve
[53:35] Christ amen that's why we come here but
[53:40] see Satan deceives everybody and I don't
[53:43] see why Trinitarians can't see that that
[53:45] Father Son Holy Ghost is just titles
[53:47] look at this he's called serpent devil
[53:48] Satan great dragon he's got four titles
[53:52] there but the Satan fort is Satan for
[53:54] persons he's no he's one person I don't
[53:56] know why people can't see it but people
[53:58] can't see it I guess if they opened
[53:59] their hearts to Christ so see remember
[54:02] God when God's cup of remembrance is
[54:05] full his wrath will be poured out
[54:08] November God told Abraham he said your
[54:11] seed is going to be in Egypt but in the
[54:13] fourth generation they'll come out again
[54:16] for the iniquity am rights is not yet
[54:18] full see God was gonna let that cup get
[54:21] full I wish I had a cup up here I don't
[54:23] have a cup I've just got this the
[54:27] communion jar God has got to let that up
[54:30] and it's gonna take 400 years to fill
[54:32] that up God in His mercy mercy more
[54:35] mercy mercy patience give them profit
[54:38] preaching after preaching to give them a
[54:40] chance and once it got for once God when
[54:43] knew was full then he'd bring Joshua
[54:45] motor Moses in there and Joshua and they
[54:48] would purge out the land because God
[54:50] gave them plenty of chances aren't you
[54:52] glad of the God who gives you more
[54:54] chances amen the Bible says the same
[54:57] thing about revelation about the mother
[54:59] harlot her sins have reached unto heaven
[55:01] God remembered her iniquities reward her
[55:03] even as she rewarded you and double and
[55:06] her double corner works in the cup which
[55:08] she hath filled fill to her double so
[55:10] she's got a cup she's floated there
[55:12] drunken with the blood
[55:13] and God said double that of all the
[55:15] blood she said double all the punishment
[55:17] on her and that's the kind old priest
[55:20] you see that's the kind no priests all
[55:22] that that's their doctrine that's that's
[55:24] what it produces right oh my god I let
[55:27] that God I let that cup get filled up to
[55:29] a certain spot and when it gets full
[55:31] then comes the wrath of God I say also
[55:34] said God was against more he the
[55:36] nation's just like today God is against
[55:38] Muslim and Buddhist nations God is
[55:40] against them he's nothing he's having
[55:42] mercy he's letting them get bound to
[55:44] their lives but God is against them amen
[55:47] look what I say I said he said that
[55:51] would be broken I'm sorry they shall be
[55:53] broken in the purposes there of all that
[55:54] makes sluices and ponds for fish where
[55:57] are they where are the wise men and let
[55:59] them tell thee now and let them know
[56:01] what the Lord of Hosts hath purposed
[56:03] upon Egypt so God tells Isaiah let them
[56:06] know what's coming to Egypt it's I mean
[56:09] mine can you imagine Egypt still getting
[56:12] punished this is a thousand years after
[56:14] Moses and God is still punishing them
[56:17] mercy God's judgment was against I read
[56:21] a Phoenician city on the Mediterranean
[56:23] coast near Israel his purpose was
[56:26] disdain its glory so God was going to
[56:29] take the next we'd say a hundred to two
[56:30] hundred years and sustain the glory of
[56:33] tyree they thought they were so
[56:35] beautiful
[56:35] they're patting themselves on the back
[56:36] they thought there's such or such a
[56:38] beautiful city and God was going to take
[56:40] their next 200 years and put a stain on
[56:42] them that's what he said now I have to
[56:47] report a concerning Egypt so shall they
[56:49] be so solely pained at the report of
[56:52] tyree now he says the Lord of Hosts has
[56:54] purposed it to stayed the pride of all
[56:57] glory and to bring into the contempt all
[57:00] the honorable of the earth so this was
[57:04] God's purpose in that day God was going
[57:06] to bring bring down the Syria raised up
[57:09] Babylon and all their glory and all that
[57:11] they thought they were God was going to
[57:13] put a stain upon it and bring contempt
[57:15] upon them right
[57:19] Isaiah 45 now this is kind of small but
[57:21] this should've scripture just mix he
[57:23] says God says I purpose it against them
[57:26] and
[57:26] I will also do it I'm gonna skip ahead
[57:29] general my now this is a few years later
[57:31] don't look at Jeremiah 427 on to each of
[57:34] the year on asurs crying out
[57:37] chronological order I keep saying that
[57:39] word raha ah this is uh okay
[57:43] BC 612 okay so this is actually yeah
[57:46] hundred years after Isaiah for thus
[57:49] saith the Lord the whole land shall be
[57:51] desolate yet I won't not make a full end
[57:52] for this show the earth mourn in the
[57:55] heavens above be black because I've
[57:56] spoken it I have purposed it and will
[57:58] not repent neither will I turn back from
[58:01] it God is going to turn the heavens
[58:03] black right now
[58:07] Jehovah Kim was the son of Josiah he was
[58:10] the third to last king of Judah before
[58:12] captivity
[58:13] now I'm gonna skip down to verse 3 if so
[58:15] be they will hearken and turn every man
[58:17] from his evil way that I repent me of
[58:19] the evil which I purpose and do unto
[58:22] them because of the evil their doings
[58:24] look how merciful God is God said I've
[58:27] it's my purpose to punish Israel but if
[58:29] their repent
[58:30] I'll have mercy on them Amen Alleluia
[58:33] and you know how we leave you know
[58:36] people like that too you know God's
[58:37] wrath is upon them but we know because
[58:39] of this because of God's love if they
[58:42] will just turn God will turn from his
[58:44] evil that he's purposed on them because
[58:46] God has a greater purpose of mercy amen
[58:52] and here's what he says just just tell
[58:54] them they'll say it the Lord if they'll
[58:55] hearken to me if they'll walk in my law
[58:57] which I've set before you to hearken the
[58:59] words of my servants the prophets whom
[59:01] I've set upon you both rising up early
[59:03] and sending them but you have not
[59:05] hearkened then I'll make this house like
[59:07] Shiloh we'll make this city a curse to
[59:09] all the nations of the earth God is so
[59:12] merciful Church he just wants what does
[59:14] he want he just wants us to here thus
[59:15] saith the Lord and obey that's all he
[59:18] wants here's the slate the Lord hear the
[59:20] word and obey and I'll have mercy on you
[59:22] oh what a what a simple thing to do
[59:25] isn't it just hear the us say at the
[59:27] Lord and obey jeremiah 36 i'm gonna skip
[59:30] ahead just to see the year sometimes
[59:31] they skip decades and so forth Jeremiah
[59:35] 36 - okay
[59:38] 607 so about five years later he said
[59:42] that it may be that the house of Judah
[59:44] will hear all the evil which I purpose
[59:45] it new to them that they may return
[59:47] every man from his evil way that I may
[59:49] forgive their iniquity and their sin God
[59:50] five years later saying the same thing
[59:52] just just turn now five years seems like
[59:55] like that right to us think how much
[59:57] more God right that's why I like those
[1:00:00] pop-ups on Facebook well I posted that
[1:00:02] four years ago that was last year my
[1:00:04] goodness
[1:00:05] but God repeats it again through is
[1:00:07] through Isaiah or Jeremiah give them
[1:00:10] another chance you still have a chance
[1:00:11] you still got time and that's so I'm
[1:00:13] here today to tell you and and you're
[1:00:15] here to tell your friends we're here to
[1:00:17] tell people God will say mercy if you'll
[1:00:20] turn to God amen
[1:00:21] we just we just must be echoes right we
[1:00:24] just mean be reflectors of God's light
[1:00:26] reflectors of God's love I tried to pray
[1:00:28] for a man yesterday I said can I pray
[1:00:30] for you at the the gas station the
[1:00:33] children were there at home Alki was
[1:00:34] there and Karras and he was all custom
[1:00:38] and saying all these evil things and I
[1:00:39] said sir I said the church is not I said
[1:00:42] you're not talking about the church
[1:00:42] you're talking about whooping Wolf's and
[1:00:44] sheep clothing I said the true church
[1:00:46] doesn't act like that he said all
[1:00:48] churches in a corner awful I said my our
[1:00:49] church is inaccurate our church was an
[1:00:51] awful he'd been hurt by churches you
[1:00:54] know and I said did you know those are
[1:00:56] not true churches if they do any sin
[1:00:57] they're just wolves in sheep's clothing
[1:00:59] I said can I pray for he said no I said
[1:01:01] well you take my card he said okay I'll
[1:01:03] take your card and that's sad you try to
[1:01:06] pray for people they won't even accept
[1:01:07] your prayers uh what is it God right now
[1:01:11] mercy God trying to just reach anyone
[1:01:14] amen now this is what five years later
[1:01:20] yes
[1:01:22] no God had purposes against the city of
[1:01:24] T man he said therefore hear the counsel
[1:01:29] of the Lord which he had taken against
[1:01:30] Edom and his purposes that he had
[1:01:31] purpose against inhabitants of T men
[1:01:33] surely the least of the flock shall draw
[1:01:35] them out so see it isn't gonna take much
[1:01:37] to defeat these people surely shall make
[1:01:39] their habitations desolate with them now
[1:01:42] look at this this is beautiful look at
[1:01:43] this
[1:01:43] God had purposes against the land of the
[1:01:45] Chaldeans and Babylon during Jeremiah's
[1:01:48] ministry so let's look at this here and
[1:01:50] that's that's right that's actually the
[1:01:52] wrong date I looked at that's Wikipedian
[1:01:54] they gave me the wrong date they're so
[1:01:55] hard on me Jeremiah 51 I realized that
[1:01:59] after I read I didn't have this Bible in
[1:02:00] my house so I didn't have this when I
[1:02:02] wish I wish it would have brought it
[1:02:03] home I left it on the pulpit Jeremiah 51
[1:02:07] 29 okay this is 80 or I'm sorry bc5 95
[1:02:11] now look the Bible said the land shall
[1:02:13] tremble as sorrow for every purpose of
[1:02:16] the Lord should be performed against
[1:02:17] Babylon to make the land of Babylon a
[1:02:19] desolation without inhabitant now this
[1:02:22] is 59 I'm sorry 5 59 BC Babylon fell in
[1:02:27] 539 BC praise God this is less than 60
[1:02:33] or 50 years God spoken through a prophet
[1:02:36] and and said Babylon is gonna fall and
[1:02:39] it took 50 years the church you got to
[1:02:44] hang on a few more how many willing to
[1:02:45] hang on a few more programs only been
[1:02:47] going 54 years that hasn't been too long
[1:02:51] this one was shorter than the other one
[1:02:53] right this was a lot shorter than
[1:02:54] Isaiah's I say this was two hundred
[1:02:56] years you had to wait the virgin shall
[1:02:58] conceive was eight hundred years you see
[1:03:01] so you just got to hang on just got to
[1:03:03] serve God just got to do what God's
[1:03:05] called you to do be happy to be thankful
[1:03:08] in it and being the best light for
[1:03:10] Christ you can be Amen that's all we're
[1:03:12] doing now what now I'm done with this
[1:03:15] global purpose now I want to jump into
[1:03:17] this thought here now I got this thought
[1:03:20] from the book I'm not gonna read all
[1:03:21] this but I'm just gonna briefly go
[1:03:23] through this because I want to get to
[1:03:24] the end thought yeah I'm not gonna look
[1:03:28] at my time that's right so as I was
[1:03:31] reading this book
[1:03:32] and I recommend anybody read it I've
[1:03:34] only found really two or three things
[1:03:35] that I didn't like about the book I'm
[1:03:37] putting in them in my next book I'm
[1:03:39] working on about the Trinity so the
[1:03:42] author believes in the Trinity and so he
[1:03:45] mentions the Trinity twice and says you
[1:03:47] know God brother Bram said God was alone
[1:03:49] but this man says no God wasn't alone
[1:03:51] because he had two other persons to talk
[1:03:53] with a church if that's not paganism I
[1:03:56] don't know what is are you with me now
[1:03:59] there's a balance to because the Bible
[1:04:01] the Bible said that Jesus was a logos
[1:04:03] and he was a light dancing before the
[1:04:05] invisible father so you got a balance
[1:04:07] it's here you know that Holy Spirit
[1:04:08] became visible but it wasn't like oh
[1:04:11] talking like three people like I'll talk
[1:04:12] to van over here I'll talk to a man over
[1:04:14] here how you guys doing and that's how
[1:04:17] they make it in this book you know now
[1:04:19] it's true God doesn't need us you know
[1:04:21] but the brother said God was lonely
[1:04:23] and he wanted to be with this family
[1:04:25] prays a little hard so see just got you
[1:04:28] know whatever you read just just make
[1:04:30] this your filter right whatever you read
[1:04:32] and of course don't read evil things but
[1:04:33] if it points you to God and you feel led
[1:04:35] to read it read it and then and then
[1:04:37] just take it through the filter of God's
[1:04:39] Word this will catch all the bugs this
[1:04:42] will catch all the residue this will
[1:04:45] catch all the solids right it'll catch
[1:04:48] all the all the bad stuff it'll filter
[1:04:50] it out now this this chapter starts off
[1:04:53] with everyone's life is driven by
[1:04:55] something and I think this is actually
[1:04:57] breaking the law too so I'm have to stop
[1:04:59] because you're not allowed to capture
[1:05:00] the any part of the book without
[1:05:02] permission so I just been doing it
[1:05:04] because it's easier for me type than
[1:05:05] typing it out but let's do this and so I
[1:05:11] don't break the law I'll just have it
[1:05:12] before me okay then when I'm done with
[1:05:13] these I'll jump back is that okay with
[1:05:15] everybody you know I just thought of
[1:05:18] that I better not do that see so drive
[1:05:21] means to guide or control or direct your
[1:05:24] life what drives your life what what
[1:05:26] directs your life whether you're driving
[1:05:29] a car a nail or a golf ball you're
[1:05:32] guiding and rolling and directing it at
[1:05:34] that moment what is the driving force in
[1:05:36] your life he says I thought that was
[1:05:37] good see now the trouble comes when were
[1:05:41] driven by problems pressure or or things
[1:05:45] like that
[1:05:46] that's the problem when we feel like Oh
[1:05:48] all my life is just driven it's just
[1:05:50] guided by my work or it's just guided by
[1:05:53] this person in my family or just guided
[1:05:55] by this we shouldn't allow that we
[1:05:58] should let our life be guided and
[1:06:00] directed and controlled by the Holy
[1:06:02] Spirit yes we're still going to have
[1:06:05] these forces and the struggles and these
[1:06:08] evil influences but we can't let them
[1:06:11] drive us to tell us what to do
[1:06:12] we've got to let the Holy Spirit drive
[1:06:14] us and deal with those as we are driven
[1:06:17] by the Lord and that's kind of the point
[1:06:21] he's making here he said many people are
[1:06:25] driven by guilt and shame you see that
[1:06:27] with people that struggle with
[1:06:28] depression their whole life like like I
[1:06:30] hate to say it but my dad he's driven by
[1:06:32] that whole mistakes he's made he is his
[1:06:35] letters let that just drive and down
[1:06:37] into depression all of his mistakes uh
[1:06:39] and church we're all gonna make mistakes
[1:06:42] who here has ever made a mistake go
[1:06:44] ahead everybody raise your hand now this
[1:06:45] is a good time everybody should raise
[1:06:47] their head if not you got the wrong
[1:06:49] spirit on you everybody's made mistakes
[1:06:52] remember Paul said in verse 15 he said
[1:06:55] I'm not meat to be called an apostle
[1:06:57] because I persecuted the Church of God
[1:06:59] if anybody could have lived on Gil it
[1:07:03] would have been Paul I held I held the
[1:07:08] coat of Steve and he got stoned
[1:07:09] oh I'm just the worst as a murderer I'm
[1:07:12] just as evil that's true one sense but
[1:07:15] what if he would have stopped then
[1:07:17] churches never would have heard the
[1:07:18] gospel people would not have got healed
[1:07:21] what if Moses would have stopped after
[1:07:23] putting that last last handful of sand
[1:07:26] on the dead body what if he said well I
[1:07:28] might as well kill myself now then two
[1:07:30] million people never would have came out
[1:07:32] of Egypt by the blood by the blood of
[1:07:34] the Lamb a man see we have to understand
[1:07:38] we've all got little dead Egyptians
[1:07:41] buried in the sand in our lives we've
[1:07:44] all you know I used to laugh at
[1:07:46] Christians always feel bad about that or
[1:07:47] maybe there's times I didn't stick up
[1:07:49] like I should for certain situations see
[1:07:52] I can't let that drive me I've got to
[1:07:53] say God forgive me but I'm moving on in
[1:07:56] Jesus Christ
[1:07:58] I'm gonna use that as motivation I'll
[1:08:00] never do that again the best scripture
[1:08:02] the Bible said take revenge upon the
[1:08:05] devil amen it says that sin Corinthians
[1:08:07] chapter 6 what revenge
[1:08:10] what zeal we should have if we really
[1:08:12] repent of something we should not let it
[1:08:14] let regret overtake us and get us
[1:08:16] depress or discourage we just read here
[1:08:19] here's the remedy for guilt repent
[1:08:22] recognize God's grace and then labor by
[1:08:25] God's grace because that's what Paul
[1:08:27] said he said but by the grace of God I
[1:08:30] am what I am see I can't change he
[1:08:33] couldn't change that he held Stevens go
[1:08:35] and watch Steven die and was happy about
[1:08:37] it he couldn't do anything about that
[1:08:39] neither could Moses do anything about I
[1:08:41] killed the man Moses couldn't bring him
[1:08:42] back but he Creek you can't live with
[1:08:45] that you've got to recognize I am I am
[1:08:47] by the grace of God God must have wanted
[1:08:50] me to experience that so I could
[1:08:52] experience forgiveness amen and then he
[1:08:55] that's forgiven much loves much amen
[1:08:59] hallelujah so that's guilts remedy is to
[1:09:02] repent recognize God's grace and then
[1:09:05] labor and do all you can for God let
[1:09:08] God's grace labor in your life don't let
[1:09:12] guilt drive your life guilt shouldn't
[1:09:15] determine your life see I started
[1:09:19] looking at this see Cain's sin drove him
[1:09:24] out of God's presence God tried to take
[1:09:27] Cain's mistake of offering the wrong
[1:09:29] sacrifice and God used that to drive him
[1:09:32] to obey but he didn't want that so he
[1:09:34] let his pride driving the other way see
[1:09:36] that God came to him and said why don't
[1:09:39] why don't you just offer like your
[1:09:41] brother he said you'll lead the family
[1:09:42] you're the leader of the family you were
[1:09:43] born first of the twins
[1:09:45] you'll lead the family if you'll just do
[1:09:46] right God was trying to use his a
[1:09:49] mistake to guide him to obey but he
[1:09:51] didn't obey but see we have to accept it
[1:09:54] when we make a mistake say god you're
[1:09:56] right I'll obey no matter how hard it is
[1:09:58] I will be next time amen and not leave
[1:10:01] the word and not leave it behind and say
[1:10:03] well I'll never get over that I'll never
[1:10:05] be able to do that no we've got to let
[1:10:07] God's our mistakes that God points out
[1:10:10] to us drive us to do the right
[1:10:12] thing see Moses's murder drove him out
[1:10:16] of Egypt so God could drive all that
[1:10:19] education on him for the next 40 years
[1:10:22] Larry
[1:10:23] his mistake drove him out of Egypt and
[1:10:28] drove him to find his sweet little wife
[1:10:29] Zipporah although they had some temper
[1:10:31] tantrum arguments and he said oh she
[1:10:34] said all your bloody husband to me he
[1:10:37] didn't circumcise Goshen but they were
[1:10:40] still they still loved each other
[1:10:42] brother branham's complex almost drove
[1:10:45] them out of the wilderness but it drove
[1:10:47] him to get desperate and prayed say god
[1:10:49] I'm just gonna go up in the winters with
[1:10:51] my wife and it drove him to talk to God
[1:10:54] then God said look over there's a seven
[1:10:56] mountain peaks your names written all
[1:10:58] over there don't take your wife up there
[1:11:00] in the mountains don't leave the people
[1:11:02] keep preaching to the people Amen don't
[1:11:04] get discouraged that don't don't get
[1:11:06] down don't isolate yourself stay with my
[1:11:09] people keep preaching you're a New
[1:11:11] Testament preacher see our trials drive
[1:11:13] us into God's presence amen didn't
[1:11:18] Jonah's decision to obey eventually
[1:11:20] drove him to his purpose he thought well
[1:11:23] I'm I'm doing a fast one now all right
[1:11:25] where they met I'm gonna fast for now
[1:11:27] I'll get on a ship to Tarshish right I
[1:11:29] won't go to Nineveh I'll go to Tarsus
[1:11:31] I'm a pretty smart fella and his
[1:11:34] mistakes drove him to go away but God
[1:11:38] used that mistake to let him be a type
[1:11:41] of the resurrection of Christ amen
[1:11:42] three days and nights in the belly of a
[1:11:45] fish and God said I'm going to use your
[1:11:47] mistake and it's going to drive you for
[1:11:49] your purpose your purpose is to reflect
[1:11:51] Jesus Christ they meant your purpose is
[1:11:54] to preach to a people that will actually
[1:11:56] receive it
[1:11:57] can you imagine he got upset at a
[1:11:59] revival and people who've repented I
[1:12:02] would rejoice if somebody could repent
[1:12:03] amen
[1:12:06] [Music]
[1:12:08] I'd do anything to see people repent
[1:12:12] right and he got mad I can't believe
[1:12:15] these Ninevites are repenting they
[1:12:17] should have died I'm just like can we
[1:12:20] save somebody else other than brother
[1:12:21] amen and sister who is anybody else out
[1:12:24] there we can save God help us to say I'm
[1:12:26] sure that's what they say about me is
[1:12:28] anybody else be saying another method
[1:12:29] brother Jesse I'm sure that's what Simon
[1:12:31] Says can I save somebody else see
[1:12:33] there's got to be somebody that's hungry
[1:12:35] for God but see our mistakes God will
[1:12:38] use our mistakes and they'll drive us to
[1:12:40] fulfill our purpose because we're God's
[1:12:42] children and all things work together
[1:12:44] for the good them to love them then them
[1:12:46] are called according to his purpose
[1:12:52] some people are driven by anger and
[1:12:54] resentment complexes their whole life is
[1:12:58] about complexes I see it all the time
[1:12:59] amongst churches you know people get
[1:13:01] upset with up my other church pastors I
[1:13:03] talked to when I go up reach other
[1:13:04] places they talk about the problems they
[1:13:06] have and not everybody but some of them
[1:13:08] you know and these people will die with
[1:13:10] complexes against message people or this
[1:13:12] this instead of their family members you
[1:13:14] know Pete many people are driven by
[1:13:16] resentment and anger but you can't you
[1:13:19] can't be led by that you got to be led
[1:13:21] by the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit
[1:13:23] will lead you to humble yourself and
[1:13:25] even take the wrong if you have to just
[1:13:27] define peace of people God delights in
[1:13:30] peace church humming its amen to that
[1:13:31] God the lights and peace his next point
[1:13:35] he said many are driven by fear they
[1:13:37] play it safe they're afraid to venture
[1:13:39] out they avoid anything or they do
[1:13:41] anything to avoid taking a risk to
[1:13:43] maintain the status quo my but the Bible
[1:13:50] says there's no fear in love perfect
[1:13:51] love casts out all fear next he said
[1:13:56] many people are driven by materialism
[1:13:57] and I thought rich young ruler that's
[1:13:59] what drove him see God was God was
[1:14:02] trying to drive him to Christ come be a
[1:14:04] preacher all you got to do is just sell
[1:14:05] out everything and just call me a
[1:14:07] preacher but instead he was driven by
[1:14:09] materialism oh I've got to build bigger
[1:14:10] barns
[1:14:11] oh my his life was driven by the wrong
[1:14:14] thing it should have been driven by
[1:14:16] Christ
[1:14:20] some people are driven by approval
[1:14:22] though they just want to be approved by
[1:14:24] other people just one piece somebody to
[1:14:26] pat him on the back but jesus said you
[1:14:27] cannot serve two masters
[1:14:29] you can only serve one and you know
[1:14:32] unfortunately you know God's approval
[1:14:34] isn't always public right God's approval
[1:14:39] doesn't always feel as good as maybe
[1:14:41] somebody recognizing you at a government
[1:14:46] function you know again a plaque or a
[1:14:48] reward look at your church your church
[1:14:50] you know set up a a charity bank and
[1:14:53] everybody gets to come in Accra and
[1:14:54] everybody can hear you you gave away ten
[1:14:57] thousand dollars at the charity bank and
[1:14:59] you get a picture in the paper God's
[1:15:02] approval isn't always like that it's not
[1:15:04] always man's approval you cannot serve
[1:15:07] two masters you can only serve one
[1:15:09] master now here's the benefits like I
[1:15:12] said I'm going quickly through these
[1:15:13] because I want to get to this thought
[1:15:15] here before we finish and I like some of
[1:15:19] these thoughts he says knowing your
[1:15:22] purpose gives meaning to your life
[1:15:25] praise God that's why people wonder so
[1:15:30] what am I going to be when I grew up
[1:15:31] what up and they think that college
[1:15:33] brother bang is gonna tell them is gonna
[1:15:35] answer their call for purpose the
[1:15:36] college ain't gonna tell you you might
[1:15:38] find out while you're there you might
[1:15:39] find out well I'm not gonna this I'm not
[1:15:41] good that look at that like I just
[1:15:44] talked to my friend in Taekwondo and
[1:15:45] he's leaving the military he was in the
[1:15:47] reserves I said I said well did you find
[1:15:49] your purpose well you know anything
[1:15:51] about purpose now I was there he said no
[1:15:54] he said I just found out it wasn't for
[1:15:55] me now there's nothing wrong with that
[1:15:57] I'm not I'm not making him look bad but
[1:15:59] in any question our life we can find out
[1:16:03] God's purpose before we act on something
[1:16:05] in other words we can save ourself a
[1:16:07] little bit of time if we first when I
[1:16:10] wonder if I should try being a preacher
[1:16:12] I'll try being a preacher oh that don't
[1:16:13] work out maybe I should try to be a song
[1:16:14] leader that don't work out maybe I
[1:16:15] should I try to be a musician that'll
[1:16:17] work out maybe I should try to date this
[1:16:18] girl maybe I should try to court that
[1:16:19] girl instead of just guess it all the
[1:16:22] time it's not to guess the thing to do
[1:16:25] is leave your your idea out and get the
[1:16:27] mind of Christ amen
[1:16:32] we're not the guess we're not gonna try
[1:16:34] and try to reason we're just trying
[1:16:38] where you gotta lay ourselves before God
[1:16:39] say God show me what you want me to do
[1:16:41] and I'll be happy to do it then we got
[1:16:43] to do it
[1:16:47] glory knowing your purpose simplifies
[1:16:51] your life because once you know what
[1:16:52] God's called you to do you can say no to
[1:16:54] everything else oh my friends invited me
[1:16:57] to go to the Super Bowl party today got
[1:17:00] Church not quite sure what to do well if
[1:17:03] you knew your purpose would be an easy
[1:17:04] answer right well here's a job offer oh
[1:17:07] but I got to wear pants if I'm a woman
[1:17:09] or oh I don't know sure if I should let
[1:17:11] me pray about that you don't have to
[1:17:13] pray about that see when you know God's
[1:17:16] purpose for your life it simplifies your
[1:17:19] life life becomes so simple praise God
[1:17:21] I always put Christ first right always
[1:17:24] believe Christ keep your ABCs it's so
[1:17:27] simple always believe Christ
[1:17:31] remember jesus promised he said I'm
[1:17:34] leaving you my peace we can have peace
[1:17:38] in this life can't we he said the world
[1:17:42] will give you trouble but I'm leaving
[1:17:44] you my joy and I'm leaving you my peace
[1:17:46] once you know your purpose in life then
[1:17:48] you have the peace of God in your heart
[1:17:51] hallelujah once you know your purpose it
[1:17:55] focuses your life like Paul tells
[1:17:59] preachers if you're a preacher he said
[1:18:01] give yourself to reading exhortation
[1:18:03] prayer all those things and then you
[1:18:06] preach sound doctrine and then the
[1:18:08] people that hear you preach that hear
[1:18:09] you preach they believe it they'll be
[1:18:10] saved it's very simple
[1:18:11] give yourself wholly to whatever God
[1:18:14] gifts God's giving you give yourself
[1:18:16] wholly to that and then God will bless
[1:18:18] it very simple God simplifies our lives
[1:18:20] praise God amen now he
[1:18:26] a good bill straight he's the polite
[1:18:31] diffuse light has little power or impact
[1:18:34] but if you can concentrate the energy of
[1:18:36] light by focusing it with the magnifying
[1:18:38] glass the Rays of the Sun can be focused
[1:18:41] to set grass or paper on fire and when
[1:18:45] light is focused even more as a laser
[1:18:48] beam it can cut through steel amen
[1:18:50] hallelujah and that beautiful if you can
[1:18:53] focus light it will burn it will start a
[1:18:56] fire amen and you can find the focus of
[1:18:59] the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll
[1:19:01] start a fire your life amen
[1:19:05] how do you do and there the world and
[1:19:08] all the barriers well I could never do
[1:19:09] this I could never do that that's what I
[1:19:12] pray for my children get the Holy Ghost
[1:19:13] because once they get the Holy Ghost
[1:19:14] they'll be laser-focused it'll start a
[1:19:18] fire in this church I don't know yeah or
[1:19:21] if you get the Holy Ghost wherever
[1:19:23] you're at when you're wrong with God
[1:19:24] it'll start a fire people will notice
[1:19:26] that persons on fire they're focused
[1:19:29] they know what God wants and the v-ray
[1:19:31] man the light of God is shining strong
[1:19:34] in their life thank you Lord right
[1:19:42] knowing your purpose motivates you see
[1:19:47] purpose always produces passion he says
[1:19:48] I like that purpose produces passion
[1:19:52] nothing energizes like a clear purpose
[1:19:56] but nothing wears us that like
[1:19:58] overworked overworked saps our strength
[1:20:01] and robs our joy when we're not doing
[1:20:03] God's purpose did I remember did you
[1:20:05] remember when I told you this brother
[1:20:06] Simon wondered for all these years he
[1:20:08] tried preaching in what was it 2007 or
[1:20:11] something like that each time and tried
[1:20:12] preaching and he thought well I'm not
[1:20:14] called to preach he and I I just kept
[1:20:17] feeling lead for Simon to preach I just
[1:20:19] felt leanin of the Lord I thought he was
[1:20:21] a teacher and pretty soon had him coming
[1:20:24] and he said he said but then he saw he
[1:20:26] had like three dreams about Thailand for
[1:20:28] some reason and then a brother said he
[1:20:30] had a dream about Simon preaching in
[1:20:32] Thailand and so Simon said Lord I'm
[1:20:33] putting in your hands you know he he
[1:20:35] could tell the story better than I could
[1:20:36] and he said I'm going off these three
[1:20:39] witnesses and he said
[1:20:40] when he got the tire in the first time
[1:20:42] and started preaching and ministering
[1:20:43] and trying to win souls he said it was
[1:20:45] the first time he felt alive in his life
[1:20:48] and he's over 40 years old church amen
[1:20:52] honey there we are see when you know
[1:20:54] God's purpose for your life you finally
[1:20:57] feel like I'm alive amen
[1:20:59] honey I feel like I'm living and that's
[1:21:01] what I feel every time I start reading
[1:21:03] or preaching or teaching God's work I
[1:21:05] feel alive amen I feel like this is what
[1:21:08] I was born to do preach Jesus Christ and
[1:21:10] him crucified a man
[1:21:12] I'm preaching he's coming back for a
[1:21:13] rapture bori see purpose gives you
[1:21:17] motivation it doesn't mean we don't get
[1:21:20] discouraged sometimes I lose my
[1:21:21] motivation
[1:21:22] it also takes us a little bit of
[1:21:23] humility also takes a little bit of
[1:21:25] trials pressure also takes a few
[1:21:27] testimonies and here comes my passion
[1:21:29] right back we all go through that don't
[1:21:31] we Church we all see knowing your
[1:21:34] purpose gives you motivation the true
[1:21:39] joy of life is being used for your
[1:21:41] purpose all right
[1:21:47] okay let's go back up here I'm just
[1:21:51] gonna put one thing up there real quick
[1:21:52] at the end of this chapter yes
[1:21:54] what would my family and friends say is
[1:21:56] the driving force in your life if
[1:22:00] someone was watching your life and they
[1:22:02] just got to watch all day I'm just gonna
[1:22:04] watch where they amen and when a man
[1:22:07] leaves okay I'll follow him out just
[1:22:08] watch him get my car I'll follow him
[1:22:11] maybe stops at McDonald's he stops at
[1:22:15] Burger King I'm like well I know what
[1:22:16] drives his life now I'm just kidding
[1:22:18] I follow bang home he stops at Home
[1:22:22] Depot then Lowe's I know what it drives
[1:22:25] his life he's trying to fix things I
[1:22:27] know you know stop at Burger King and
[1:22:29] McDonald's brother I'm sorry I took oh
[1:22:31] dear and I make jokes about fast-food
[1:22:33] forgive me but I'm just trying to use an
[1:22:36] example I need to use myself next time
[1:22:38] what would people say what drives their
[1:22:41] life what drives your life what controls
[1:22:45] and if we if we could ask your children
[1:22:47] if we could pause my Twitter side and I
[1:22:49] want to be there and you know maybe
[1:22:50] Karen could interview them what drives
[1:22:52] our dads like what is his May
[1:22:53] driving force what is the thing he wants
[1:22:56] the most out of life I wonder what my
[1:22:58] tuner would say money is that always in
[1:23:01] this is room counting money and and
[1:23:03] trying to call to make deals to make
[1:23:05] more money I wonder I wonder what your
[1:23:12] children would say or your husband or
[1:23:15] wife I wonder what they would say what
[1:23:17] is the driving force what is pushing
[1:23:19] them through life what's controlling
[1:23:22] their thoughts is that is that a pretty
[1:23:24] good thought what's controlling your
[1:23:28] thoughts what's driving you now I'm just
[1:23:33] as I said concluded the chapter I just
[1:23:35] wrote these out we are not driven by
[1:23:37] fear but faith prophecy should drive our
[1:23:40] life the prophecy of Joel 2 about the
[1:23:41] end times paul told timothy remember the
[1:23:44] prophecy about his life maybe some of us
[1:23:47] have a prophecy on our life i know uh
[1:23:49] cam does I know but Tim iers does I know
[1:23:52] different ones I was there when Tim
[1:23:53] Myers got a prophecy all the time I was
[1:23:55] there he's out the vestibule and and
[1:23:57] everybody's fellowship and all of a
[1:23:59] sudden sister Karen she was letting the
[1:24:00] Holy Spirit just walked up and said thus
[1:24:02] saith the Lord it's our prophesied over
[1:24:03] Tim Myers
[1:24:07] preach the rock or praise the Lord but I
[1:24:12] haven't let that discourage me even
[1:24:13] though anyone nobody prophesied over me
[1:24:15] I know God did because he he said I said
[1:24:19] I've chosen you in Christ before the
[1:24:20] foundation of the world
[1:24:21] so whether anybody prophesize me over
[1:24:24] overnight that's okay cuz I know Jesus
[1:24:26] has in other words I'm not gonna be
[1:24:28] discouraged if I'm not like somebody
[1:24:30] else I'm not gonna be like Peter say
[1:24:32] what about John what about him what I'm
[1:24:35] not gonna follow him he said go do what
[1:24:36] God's called you to do follow thou me we
[1:24:41] thank God for that though we really do
[1:24:42] thank God for that Paul said to know the
[1:24:44] will of God redeemed the time so if you
[1:24:47] want to know God's will make the best
[1:24:49] use of your time don't waste your time
[1:24:51] let purpose Drive your life purpose will
[1:24:54] simplify your life now don't look at the
[1:25:01] time he said God saves you now here's
[1:25:03] here's a thought God now here's a
[1:25:07] different thought God saves you from
[1:25:08] your own purpose how many had a
[1:25:10] different purpose before you became a
[1:25:11] Christian you had different things you
[1:25:12] wanted to do with your life I wrote it
[1:25:15] on my wife can tell you I wrote it in my
[1:25:17] wallet I said I want to be in the NFL I
[1:25:18] want to make million dollars and buy my
[1:25:20] mom a house that was my gold goal in
[1:25:22] life I never would have made it probably
[1:25:25] but that was my goal anyway now look
[1:25:29] what Joe said this is in the midst of
[1:25:31] job's trials for God's actually actually
[1:25:33] the end of jobs trials because I'm in
[1:25:35] chapter 22 to find this for God speaketh
[1:25:41] once you ain't twice and yet man doesn't
[1:25:43] perceive it you realize that God's
[1:25:44] talking to us all the time and we just
[1:25:46] sometimes we don't catch it in a dream
[1:25:48] and a vision of the night when deep
[1:25:50] sleep falls upon men in slum brings upon
[1:25:53] the bed then he opened the ears of men
[1:25:55] and sealed their instruction that he may
[1:25:57] withdraw man from his purpose and hide
[1:26:00] man from pride thank God hallelujah
[1:26:02] thank God that God has to somehow seal
[1:26:06] up our instructional her seal for our
[1:26:08] ears he'll get us all closed off from
[1:26:10] the things of the world so that we can
[1:26:12] hear God's Word and pull us away from
[1:26:15] our purposes in life thank God for that
[1:26:18] amen don't do that John knew God
[1:26:21] to get your ear sealed up in order for
[1:26:24] you to hear his voice that he can
[1:26:26] withdraw you from your purpose thank God
[1:26:30] for that
[1:26:32] I'm so glad that you know when Simon
[1:26:34] came to hear the message or you came to
[1:26:37] give me the message back in 2001 that's
[1:26:39] what God did God drew me away from my
[1:26:41] purpose wanting to be an NFL and Simon
[1:26:43] said come up here you know my room was
[1:26:45] the Upper Room so I heard the message up
[1:26:48] in the upper room and now I got the Holy
[1:26:50] Ghost - amen
[1:26:52] idea that's what I heard it see that he
[1:26:55] may withdraw you and it pulled me away
[1:26:57] from my purpose and it drew me to shut
[1:27:00] off all the things of the world so I
[1:27:01] could hear the message of the hour
[1:27:04] God keepeth back his soul from the pit
[1:27:06] and his life from perishing by the sword
[1:27:09] amen
[1:27:10] who's kept you alive all these years
[1:27:12] Lord Jesus Christ he kept you from
[1:27:16] perishing now I just wanna lay in there
[1:27:19] cuz as I looked through the word purpose
[1:27:21] I came upon that and church we should be
[1:27:23] so thankful for that that God didn't let
[1:27:25] you achieve your purpose in life that
[1:27:27] you want to do first
[1:27:29] what would you be we hardly like to
[1:27:32] think about it but where would you be
[1:27:33] tonight if God didn't come and take you
[1:27:36] away from your purpose my goodness
[1:27:40] thank God he pulled us away so here's
[1:27:43] how God does it first
[1:27:45] we're driven to our purpose and then
[1:27:48] once we know our purpose then that
[1:27:50] purpose drives us forward see then your
[1:27:55] purpose drives you first God drives you
[1:27:57] to purpose then your purpose drives you
[1:27:59] here's some examples now I meant notice
[1:28:01] and I'm gonna use guarantee our netpeak
[1:28:04] again like brother BAM did see God
[1:28:08] spares men's lies by drawing them away
[1:28:10] from their own purposes this was even
[1:28:15] brother
[1:28:15] number of milligrams talked about his
[1:28:17] purpose that wouldn't be a cowboy that
[1:28:20] was his purpose in life to be a cowboy
[1:28:23] can you imagine him not be in minds
[1:28:25] behind the pulp of a ridin horses last
[1:28:27] so in cattle whoo
[1:28:30] can you imagine our profit that's what
[1:28:33] he wanted to do I'm gonna be a real
[1:28:35] cowboy but he saw the boy said I'm not a
[1:28:37] cowboy God has a way to drive us away
[1:28:40] from our purpose I'm so glad he does
[1:28:44] church remember up for each other so few
[1:28:48] weeks ago he got polio 15 he died at 17
[1:28:51] not a potent open to some other flu and
[1:28:53] disease but he made it he may have died
[1:28:55] from polio but eventually but he didn't
[1:28:57] actually die from polio the good program
[1:29:01] says remember the last time I saw garner
[1:29:04] and he we stepped in unexpectedly his
[1:29:07] love is in a home he was staying with
[1:29:09] his people and what we did find it would
[1:29:11] be a real example for any Christian
[1:29:12] minister to see this sober man kind of
[1:29:14] slips into his house without let him
[1:29:16] know he was coming and he was setting up
[1:29:19] out of the rocking bed had his arms in a
[1:29:21] little sling and as we walked to the
[1:29:23] house he was always so welcome there was
[1:29:26] Garnett before him was the Bible would
[1:29:30] you like that when people if people
[1:29:32] walked into your house and they caught
[1:29:33] you reading the Bible that's how brother
[1:29:36] ham caught this boy with polio and the
[1:29:40] little lady that was taking care of him
[1:29:41] was sitting over there a little do a
[1:29:42] full affair and they were having Bible
[1:29:45] study and I looked at him and my heart
[1:29:49] just melted god forbid if
[1:29:55] should go in the hospital and if I'd
[1:29:58] ever have to come pray for you or you
[1:29:59] come pray for me I hope you find this I
[1:30:02] hope you find me if I'm in the hospital
[1:30:05] at all
[1:30:05] I hope you find me with my Bible opening
[1:30:07] I'm doing a Bible study with the nurse
[1:30:08] oh no sister no the Bible actually says
[1:30:11] this 10 days later they're baptized the
[1:30:13] name of Lord Jesus Christ pardon me
[1:30:16] excuse me can you increase my medicine
[1:30:19] excuse me wouldn't you want that
[1:30:24] testimony Church somebody actually oh oh
[1:30:28] it's room 7-eleven or o'the room 7 7 7
[1:30:31] well oh yeah there's there's brother
[1:30:34] bang oh he broke his leg or something
[1:30:36] I'm not speaking bad things here well
[1:30:38] he's got his Bible open he's witnessing
[1:30:40] to the nurses there oh that's a real
[1:30:43] Christian right there
[1:30:45] and I said to him asked him a question I
[1:30:48] said garnet perhaps what if this had
[1:30:50] never happened to you with polio let's
[1:30:54] say I was caught up here tonight a young
[1:30:56] boy by the name of Garnett pica just got
[1:30:58] killed out of here on the highway with
[1:30:59] this car and the boy was drunk in other
[1:31:01] words would you rather have polio o or
[1:31:05] get drunk and die in a car I got no God
[1:31:07] and he said just let it be the way it is
[1:31:10] as long as I know Jesus the way I know
[1:31:13] him now he said it's more than life even
[1:31:18] though I have to stay here all my life
[1:31:19] in this condition hey man hallelujah do
[1:31:26] you wish you could just
[1:31:27] some fun and not be in the bed and go
[1:31:29] out there and drink with your buddies
[1:31:30] and drive hot rods and maybe die drunk
[1:31:33] would you rather have that would you
[1:31:34] rather be stricken by polio in the bed
[1:31:36] he said I'd rather have polio that I
[1:31:39] would know Christ amen
[1:31:43] see this is what my mom said it was gone
[1:31:46] it's time to go at 17 it was his time to
[1:31:49] go he had served his purpose he come to
[1:31:52] Christ been German ties what if he would
[1:31:55] have died before this time polio drove
[1:31:57] him to God see you have to be driven to
[1:32:04] your purpose and then when you have your
[1:32:05] purpose that purpose can drive you to 15
[1:32:09] years old God used polio Garnett
[1:32:12] probably won't repent without polio I've
[1:32:16] got a lot of polio now he didn't say
[1:32:18] probably he knew Garnett would not
[1:32:20] repent without polio I've gotta let the
[1:32:23] 15 year-old boy get polio and this will
[1:32:25] drive him to me and then once he has me
[1:32:29] and knows my prophet he'll have the
[1:32:32] purpose of God he'll have Bible studies
[1:32:34] for the next two years ha ha
[1:32:35] amen and this will drive the rest of his
[1:32:38] life now that he knows me praise God
[1:32:43] polio drove him to God he was to be a
[1:32:47] tobacco auctioneer that's what he had in
[1:32:49] his mind I'm gonna be a real slick real
[1:32:50] fast talker I'm gonna make lots of money
[1:32:52] I'm gonna be the fanciest guy with the
[1:32:54] microphone oh I'm gonna be a good fella
[1:32:57] but that wasn't his purpose at all we
[1:33:01] knew that his purpose was to be a
[1:33:03] Christian now a tobacco auctioneer
[1:33:07] somebody said well maybe 75 years from
[1:33:09] today if the world would stand that long
[1:33:10] and garnet he was a great auction ear
[1:33:12] maybe that's all the minister could have
[1:33:14] said his funeral he was a great
[1:33:14] auctioneer but see now he's a Christian
[1:33:18] look what the Bible said remember this I
[1:33:20] don't know if you remember I preached
[1:33:21] this a couple years ago the righteous
[1:33:23] perishes and no man laid at the heart no
[1:33:25] one really thinks why did this righteous
[1:33:27] person perish why did God let this young
[1:33:30] person die the Bible said
[1:33:33] merciful men are taken away nun
[1:33:35] considering that the righteous is taken
[1:33:37] away from the evil to come you know a
[1:33:39] way to turn an evil life tobacco
[1:33:42] auctioneering and pride and who knows
[1:33:46] cancer you know cuz visit maybe he had
[1:33:48] addiction to tobacco who knows but God
[1:33:52] took him before the evil would happen
[1:33:55] his mind oh I'm gonna make lots of money
[1:33:57] I'm gonna be famous
[1:33:58] i'ma be the smoothest talking auctioneer
[1:34:00] there ever was God said that's not your
[1:34:04] purpose so I'm going to use this
[1:34:06] sickness and it will drive garnett to me
[1:34:10] and then it will drive him the next two
[1:34:12] years of his life now that he's found
[1:34:14] his purpose praise God remember even God
[1:34:21] has a place for little ones that die
[1:34:22] prematurely remember David said that
[1:34:24] David said well why am I gonna mourn now
[1:34:26] he said I'll go to him but he should not
[1:34:28] return to me God has a purpose even
[1:34:31] those little ones that pass away
[1:34:33] God has a little purpose there's a place
[1:34:35] for them
[1:34:36] according to David God's got a place God
[1:34:39] has a purpose for all things now here's
[1:34:47] a little more on
[1:34:48] our net and then I want to close with a
[1:34:49] mother Ford quote but God had to throw
[1:34:52] him garnet in that stage to get out of
[1:34:55] him to serve the purpose I've got to let
[1:35:00] polio come upon a fifteen year old boy
[1:35:02] in order to get something out of him
[1:35:08] look at his patients remember the word
[1:35:12] long-suffering is another word for
[1:35:13] patience and long-suffering is a fruit
[1:35:16] of the Holy Spirit it was going to take
[1:35:19] two years of battling polio and God was
[1:35:22] gonna allow the fruit of patience to
[1:35:24] come out of Garnett's life said
[1:35:27] everybody in the town could come up by
[1:35:29] and see oh here's a real Christian look
[1:35:30] he's got the fruit of it he's not
[1:35:32] impatient he's patient this was the
[1:35:36] purpose of his life don't all plants and
[1:35:39] vegetables have a purpose Church so do
[1:35:43] spiritual trees spiritual trees have a
[1:35:45] purpose his purpose was to produce the
[1:35:47] fruit I just want everybody to see a
[1:35:49] real patient Holy Ghost field Christian
[1:35:52] now even the myths of staring down a
[1:35:54] life-threatening disease you can still
[1:35:56] be patient with God that's what I want
[1:35:59] this whole community I think was
[1:36:00] Campbellsville Kentucky God said this is
[1:36:03] what I want Campbellsville Kentucky to
[1:36:05] see a patient Christian so brother
[1:36:08] Branham said on the day of judgment it
[1:36:09] will testify against the community
[1:36:12] look at his patients his testimonies
[1:36:14] among you neighbors look what he was
[1:36:16] what how his little life I spoke to many
[1:36:18] of you that at the day of judgment
[1:36:20] without that his life will testify right
[1:36:23] back against you he was an example of
[1:36:28] what God wanted with him he served God's
[1:36:30] purpose two years of having polio but
[1:36:36] the end of that two years he had a real
[1:36:39] testimony of fruit to his life and the
[1:36:42] people could esal see ma look at that
[1:36:44] precious fruit he's not regretting it
[1:36:47] he's not cursing God he's not saying oh
[1:36:50] I wish I was this I wish I was that he
[1:36:52] produced a godly fruit of patience don't
[1:36:55] you don't know you think we take it for
[1:36:57] granted
[1:36:57] when was last time you had an apple when
[1:36:59] was last time you had a orange
[1:37:01] this delicious fruit and use we just
[1:37:03] might in July but we fail many times to
[1:37:10] see just how glorious that fruit is get
[1:37:14] hungry one time and you'll see how
[1:37:16] glorious that fruit is right church and
[1:37:20] that's what Garnett's life was these
[1:37:23] hungry the Bible said there's a famine
[1:37:25] right in the last days for the word of
[1:37:26] God there's a famine and all these
[1:37:28] hungry sinners get to see my look at
[1:37:31] that delicious fruit of patience what a
[1:37:34] patient godly person garnet was and no
[1:37:38] doubt that I would say with on the rest
[1:37:39] of their life because Moran said they'll
[1:37:41] answer the day of judgment you saw
[1:37:43] patience that's how you act when trials
[1:37:46] come upon you because that's what Jesus
[1:37:48] had to do Jesus had to be patient omits
[1:37:50] of his trials two years two years it
[1:37:57] produced repentance Bible study
[1:37:59] Christian testimony all those years and
[1:38:01] at the end he brings forth his fruit and
[1:38:06] all the world all the world stands that
[1:38:08] looks like God's fruit this is what I
[1:38:10] produce hallelujah
[1:38:13] remember the Bible said the same thing
[1:38:15] of job you have heard of the patience of
[1:38:17] Job the Bible said see it's the purpose
[1:38:20] of patience sometimes our lives are to
[1:38:23] produce one of these fruits of the
[1:38:24] spirit remember I preached this from the
[1:38:29] numerology I just copied and pasted see
[1:38:31] three times three is nine nines a number
[1:38:33] of fruit or maturity the three times for
[1:38:36] the fruit of divine maturity or the
[1:38:38] maturity of divine things so in that two
[1:38:44] years
[1:38:44] and garter became a mature Christian in
[1:38:47] a two-year span and brother Han said he
[1:38:50] was German ties which means he had the
[1:38:51] baptism holy ghost God gave the men the
[1:38:54] Holy Ghost with polio and produced a
[1:38:58] godly mature Christian in the matter of
[1:39:00] two years that's how great our goddess
[1:39:03] amen
[1:39:04] to save someone right before it's their
[1:39:06] time to go to drive them to drive them
[1:39:08] away from me in a worldly auctioneer
[1:39:10] tobacco auctioneer to dry them to Christ
[1:39:13] and then Christ would drive that that
[1:39:15] desire that that that love for Christ
[1:39:17] would drive them forward for the next
[1:39:19] years of their life remaining
[1:39:22] see because long-suffering is patience
[1:39:26] now let me read one more well it's it's
[1:39:30] a string of quotes and I know I know I
[1:39:33] appreciate you been a good audience here
[1:39:35] let me finish up with mrs. Ford how many
[1:39:38] do they remember mrs. Ford but Ram story
[1:39:41] mrs. Ford was the woman that gay brother
[1:39:45] branham that that boy scout legging that
[1:39:48] he wanted mrs. Ford's son was brother
[1:39:52] his friend who had the Boy Scout uniform
[1:39:53] brother Graham always wanted it and he
[1:39:56] said promise me when that wears out
[1:39:58] you'll give it to me and all that was
[1:39:59] left was the pants was one legging that
[1:40:03] was mrs. Ford's son and real man talks
[1:40:08] about mrs. Ford's purpose in life
[1:40:10] now I'm gonna skip passes he said see I
[1:40:13] wore that leg in the school so it was
[1:40:14] the Boy Scout leggings mother that was
[1:40:20] his mother that just passed away mrs.
[1:40:22] Ford this is from letting off the
[1:40:24] pressure
[1:40:24] I was listening a sermon I almost
[1:40:25] started crying I'm so beautiful and
[1:40:27] they're among the poorest of the poor
[1:40:30] people but they must had enough money to
[1:40:32] get me Boy Scouts or maybe they maybe
[1:40:34] they had the hand-me-down Boy Scout
[1:40:35] uniform Lloyd the boy who gave me the
[1:40:38] legging we've been Chum since little
[1:40:40] boys I said of Lloyd what would you want
[1:40:42] me to take the funeral text from and
[1:40:44] said brother Billy just would like you
[1:40:46] to speak for this if it's the will of
[1:40:47] the Lord just give me some assurance
[1:40:50] that my mother will be back again and I
[1:40:52] said very well so brother
[1:40:56] took the subject for mrs. Ford's funeral
[1:40:58] anything that lives to the will and
[1:41:00] purpose of God has a resurrection glory
[1:41:04] hallelujah and brother man talks about
[1:41:10] God's a God of variety
[1:41:12] he makes us different because he wants
[1:41:13] us that way he makes some rich some poor
[1:41:16] so mrs. Ford was not made a rich woman
[1:41:18] but she still loved Jesus Christ program
[1:41:24] said God makes some rich makes some poor
[1:41:26] why can't they just got out of their
[1:41:28] poorness why they why they always over
[1:41:30] and come with poverty maybe God made him
[1:41:32] like that God made Hattie right like
[1:41:34] that and people still preach on her
[1:41:36] testimonies all the time how about that
[1:41:38] where's the testimonies all the rich
[1:41:39] people the message see God sometimes
[1:41:42] chooses the poor of this world rich in
[1:41:44] faith hallelujah but we got to a place
[1:41:50] to serve God and that's the place that
[1:41:52] he's placed us in if we'll just abide in
[1:41:55] that place see not be driven to get out
[1:41:59] of the place God's called us but to be
[1:42:01] in the place where God's called us
[1:42:06] everybody talks
[1:42:08] about how a lily has tutorial to give
[1:42:10] off its its fragrance and then once it
[1:42:13] gives it off nobody thanks to Lily it
[1:42:16] serves its purpose you smell the flowers
[1:42:19] that's pretty good and going the next
[1:42:20] thing now I mean it Labor's it for all
[1:42:24] of that it Labor's just to give that off
[1:42:25] and then that dies you throw it in the
[1:42:28] compost bin or throw it in the trash
[1:42:35] what if the little stalk of corn see
[1:42:37] that corn stock would say I'm so sorry
[1:42:39] there's nothing pretty about me I don't
[1:42:41] have no honey to give out I didn't have
[1:42:43] this or the other that's what we say
[1:42:45] well I'm just not like mr. Christian er
[1:42:47] I wish I was like that Christian but
[1:42:51] then the master of all would say yes but
[1:42:53] the lily that little lily couldn't make
[1:42:55] corn flakes either
[1:42:56] I just don't smell good like that Lily I
[1:43:00] I'm just a I'm just a cornstalk but
[1:43:04] you've got a purpose you've got
[1:43:07] something God has called you to do that
[1:43:09] other people can't do but you can do it
[1:43:12] when you're aligned with God's Spirit
[1:43:15] see we all have a thing that we can do
[1:43:17] we serve God in the category that were
[1:43:20] put in and it comes back just the same
[1:43:23] you didn't think you'd hear preaching
[1:43:25] about cornflakes today did you when you
[1:43:26] have poured your cornflakes at breakfast
[1:43:28] this morning did you well maybe tomorrow
[1:43:31] morning when you pour your clock wakes
[1:43:33] you'll think about this quote thank God
[1:43:36] for the corn while you're smelling your
[1:43:39] lilies on your table Oh delicious or
[1:43:43] beautiful so refreshing Church is the
[1:43:48] purpose God has a purpose for everything
[1:43:51] and church something you know often we
[1:43:54] just overlook God's purpose we're so
[1:43:56] looking for everything else this is
[1:43:58] where it's laying right there in front
[1:43:59] of us outside it's laying right there in
[1:44:02] front of us but always looking to
[1:44:03] everything else I love this
[1:44:12] I'm gonna read this whole thing let's
[1:44:13] say in our feet now in the face of all
[1:44:17] that at the funeral brother have said I
[1:44:18] said this I said here's a little mother
[1:44:20] forward as I know her she's washed my
[1:44:22] little bitty face when I was a kid
[1:44:24] minute can you imagine that she was so
[1:44:27] led by God God led her over not to just
[1:44:29] she'd wash some of the faces for that he
[1:44:31] grabbed a whole that prophet of God's
[1:44:32] face hallelujah God had a woman there to
[1:44:41] take care of his little prophet I'll
[1:44:43] clean off his face make sure it looks
[1:44:45] presentable when he goes home glory see
[1:44:50] Church everything every little thing you
[1:44:52] do God's watching see there was his
[1:44:59] pores could be but she was born a female
[1:45:01] a lovely girl and she's born a female
[1:45:03] then that was for a purpose to have a
[1:45:05] mate a male and she did a loyal mate she
[1:45:10] was a men she lived with her husband for
[1:45:18] some 60 years or better and our Lord
[1:45:20] your woman wasn't more now that includes
[1:45:23] his wife his wives hope Mita and his
[1:45:26] mama a more loyal woman er wasn't more
[1:45:29] as I know of a real lady now he's not
[1:45:32] exalting her but he's just saying she's
[1:45:33] one of the most loyal women I've ever
[1:45:34] known being that she was that that Union
[1:45:40] they were to have children now look at
[1:45:42] this is beautiful you can hear brother
[1:45:43] I'm talking to mrs. Ford's children at
[1:45:46] the sermon and brother I said here's her
[1:45:49] fine her nice buying shirt or sent here
[1:45:52] just as lovely you children would never
[1:45:54] want a better mother or would you and
[1:45:57] you can hear him say no we wouldn't see
[1:46:03] no her
[1:46:04] Ben could not want a better wife what
[1:46:08] was your purpose well I'm just a woman
[1:46:10] I'm just a mother that's all I am I just
[1:46:12] have children I'm just a wife that's all
[1:46:14] I am but your purpose is to be the best
[1:46:19] wife and mother that your husband could
[1:46:22] ever add and your children could ever
[1:46:23] have your purpose is to be more loyal or
[1:46:27] lawyer or Pew more pure than anyone that
[1:46:30] that could possibly be be as pure be as
[1:46:34] loyal be as loving as you possibly can
[1:46:38] be so loyal that your family if you god
[1:46:41] forbid it then they should be at your
[1:46:42] funeral some day that they could say I
[1:46:44] could never want a better father than my
[1:46:46] daddy now some of us don't have that
[1:46:49] privilege right I I wish I had a better
[1:46:51] father mother you know in some ways but
[1:46:53] I'm thankful for what they did for me
[1:46:55] I'm they for the godly instruction that
[1:46:57] didn't have but I could have a better
[1:46:59] yeah I wish I had a little better but
[1:47:01] God knew Church God knew but see we have
[1:47:04] a choice now we have a choice now to be
[1:47:07] as loyal as we can as loving as we can
[1:47:10] as christ-like as we can right now to
[1:47:14] serve God's purpose for our life I never
[1:47:17] met a more loyal pastor than brother
[1:47:19] Jesse I hope you can say that at my
[1:47:20] funeral if I have I never met a more
[1:47:26] loyal father than my daddy brother Jesse
[1:47:29] I hope by God's grace people can say
[1:47:34] that about my life because that's my
[1:47:35] purpose my purpose is not to mix up and
[1:47:37] give my eyes off of the one I'm supposed
[1:47:39] to do my purposes to be focused like a
[1:47:41] laser and burn with the Holy Ghost for
[1:47:45] my purpose I said she was
[1:47:51] poor cabbie but nobody now look could
[1:47:53] ever come to her door or need but what
[1:47:56] she would give to them the neighbors no
[1:48:00] matter what trouble they was in mrs.
[1:48:01] Ford any hour of the night was there to
[1:48:06] help them do anything she could with
[1:48:10] what she had to do with remember the
[1:48:12] proverbs 31 woman one thing about her
[1:48:14] her light was on all night now sisters
[1:48:17] you have to have your lights on but
[1:48:20] who's the one that gets up when the kids
[1:48:21] get sick my wife she don't need a light
[1:48:24] on she just gets up I'm the one who got
[1:48:26] any find my phone and where was that
[1:48:27] flashlight button I know it's here
[1:48:31] somewhere
[1:48:36] look at look at her testimony loyal wife
[1:48:39] loyal mother loyal neighbor brother BAM
[1:48:44] said I could not find a more loyal woman
[1:48:46] than this she served her purpose and I
[1:48:53] said above all that glory what could be
[1:48:55] above being a better wife and mother
[1:48:57] this could that I had the privilege one
[1:49:02] time I seen that steed German she was
[1:49:07] born again in the spirit of god
[1:49:09] I said now where now we're gonna plant
[1:49:12] her a little bit in the ground and who
[1:49:14] who intelligently could stand up and say
[1:49:16] she will not rise again she served God's
[1:49:19] purpose on the earth hallelujah above
[1:49:23] everything see when you're born again
[1:49:26] it drives you right you know I'm sorry
[1:49:28] God drives you to being born again and
[1:49:31] then once you're born again it drives
[1:49:32] you into your purpose how they do you
[1:49:36] and thence then people say well that
[1:49:38] I've never seen a more loyal person than
[1:49:40] this I've never seen a more godly worker
[1:49:44] at the bank than that person wherever
[1:49:46] you work I've never seen a more godly
[1:49:49] teacher than brother so-and-so sister so
[1:49:51] and so that's what Christ
[1:49:54] how many thankful that Christ produced
[1:49:56] is that kind of fruit in your life now
[1:49:59] kind a man once you come here I better
[1:50:00] stop right there
[1:50:07] brother branham said you would be crazy
[1:50:09] to say that that person that died if
[1:50:12] they're real Christian would never rise
[1:50:14] again you'd be crazy to do that because
[1:50:17] all Christianity is based upon one thing
[1:50:19] resurrection that's what all this Paul
[1:50:23] said we are miserable if we don't have
[1:50:26] the resurrection it's all about the
[1:50:28] resurrection we see people die don't get
[1:50:31] discouraged
[1:50:32] you'll see them again thank God
[1:50:35] we'll see them again it's all based upon
[1:50:38] this seed life if this seed got the the
[1:50:42] seed can't bring more for free for
[1:50:44] unless it raises the dies rots and
[1:50:46] raises again Jesus had to die in order
[1:50:49] to bring forth more seed but minister
[1:50:52] the church had to die in the days of
[1:50:53] Luther in order before Luther and then
[1:50:56] rise again in a resurrection hey man how
[1:50:58] do they Laurie in order to produce the
[1:51:01] rapture seat at the end time hallelujah
[1:51:06] all right you can switch over to songs
[1:51:09] here
[1:51:13] how many thank
[1:51:14] for God's grace in your life how many
[1:51:17] can see God driving you to the message
[1:51:21] and the batson Holy Ghost and once you
[1:51:23] got the Holy Ghost now you can see this
[1:51:25] Holy Ghost driving your purpose forward
[1:51:27] in life if you can see that church then
[1:51:30] brother Baron said above all that's the
[1:51:31] most wonderful thing you could have in
[1:51:33] this life the most wonderful thing you
[1:51:37] could have a thing through it all
[1:51:39] through it all I've learned to trust in
[1:51:41] Jesus I've learned to trust in God
[1:51:43] Church let's not let anger drive us
[1:51:46] don't let anger drive this week don't

[1:51:56] you know we're here we're here we have
[1:51:58] to work jobs and new and run families
[1:52:00] those things but we should say God let
[1:52:03] your spirit drive me to be the best
[1:52:05] example of Christianity I can be so that
[1:52:10] if I do go to the grave people will know
[1:52:12] what drove Jesse Smith people will know
[1:52:17] what drove our sister beatrice to fly
[1:52:20] across the ocean this many times to be a
[1:52:22] blessing to her grandchildren people

[1:52:28] Brenda the church when she wasn't
[1:52:31] feeling good all those times they don't
[1:52:34] know what drove her because all those
[1:52:39] who don't receive Christ will have to
