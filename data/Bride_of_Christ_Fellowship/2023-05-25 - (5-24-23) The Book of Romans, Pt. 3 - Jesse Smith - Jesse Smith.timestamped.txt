[0:00] got a thought from Sunday when brother
[0:02] Dukes was preaching so I want to
[0:04] incorporate that into this sermon here
[0:06] today by God's grace Romans chapter 2
[0:08] verse 1 will read verses one through
[0:10] four
[0:16] Romans chapter 2.
[0:20] verse 1.
[0:40] Hallelujah
[0:43] I'll read verses one two and three and
[0:44] then we can read verse four together
[0:46] here by God's grace
[0:48] therefore thou are inexcusable old man
[0:50] whosoever thou art that judgest
[0:53] for wherein thou judges another thou
[0:55] condemn us thyself for thou that judges
[0:59] do us the same things
[1:01] verse two but we are sure that the
[1:03] Judgment of God is a coordinated truth
[1:05] against them which commit such things
[1:08] and think is thou this o man that judges
[1:11] them which do such things and do us the
[1:14] same that thou shalt escape the Judgment
[1:17] of God
[1:18] let's read verse 4 together just
[1:20] beautiful scripture One Two Three or
[1:22] despises thou The Riches of his goodness
[1:26] and forbearance and long-suffering not
[1:30] knowing that the goodness of God leadeth
[1:33] thee to repentance praise God may God
[1:35] add His blessings word may be seated
[1:37] praise God
[1:45] Hallelujah all right so we want to start
[1:47] here in Romans Chapter 2 just preaching
[1:50] through this book of the Bible here let
[1:52] me pull my Bible out there's a scripture
[1:53] I just told him
[1:57] and we'll keep going here by the grace
[1:59] of God
[2:03] I couldn't think of where Jesus said
[2:04] about Judge judging
[2:11] so again it's good to see brother Ray
[2:12] There by God's grace sir praise God good
[2:14] to see you Hallelujah
[2:19] okay yeah there we go so we're starting
[2:21] here in chapter 2 verse one and I want
[2:24] to Lord will and get to this thought
[2:25] eventually I want to get to the thought
[2:27] of reaping and sowing here tonight I'll
[2:28] be the kind of like the subtopic but I
[2:30] want to preach through this first part
[2:32] of this chapter here we preach through
[2:33] all of chapter one hope that was a
[2:35] blessing there by the grace of God uh
[2:37] seeing this wonderful
[2:39] scripture here
[2:40] just on a side note I taught our
[2:44] Arrowhead Elementary students to
[2:46] memorize Romans 1 16. so I was really
[2:49] really proud of them I think three or
[2:50] four actually memorized the verse there
[2:52] so it's really encouraging to see them
[2:54] testify there and memorize the scripture
[2:57] by God's grace so chapter 2 verse one
[3:00] therefore thou are inexcusable o man
[3:03] whosoever thou that judges for wherein
[3:05] thou judges another thou condemneth
[3:07] thyself
[3:08] for thou that judges do us the same
[3:10] things praise God now remember this is
[3:13] uh following uh chapter one of course
[3:15] and we just finished with that uh two
[3:18] Wednesdays ago last Wednesday we looked
[3:19] at the arrow of Deliverance praise God
[3:22] and Lord willing here
[3:25] it was on just on a side note it was
[3:27] wonderful to see how God delivered
[3:28] sister Naomi and those requests that she
[3:30] had right just speaking the word of God
[3:32] and trusting God that was really
[3:33] wonderful to see her get there with safe
[3:35] travel and God allowed her not to get
[3:38] the jab praise God
[3:40] Hallelujah so we thank the Lord for that
[3:45] so uh here Paul is now he's he's making
[3:48] this uh argument here here how uh
[3:53] he's going to get into this thought of
[3:55] how a gentile
[3:57] pagans are no better than other pagans
[4:00] and then he's going to show how
[4:01] legalistic Jews are no better than
[4:04] pagans
[4:05] right remember Paul is writing to a
[4:07] church in Rome where uh it was Jewish
[4:10] and Gentile but then the emperor got rid
[4:13] of the Jews right he expelled the Jews
[4:15] for five years no Jews were allowed in
[4:17] Rome
[4:18] and then after five years they come back
[4:20] and and now the churches uh is it was
[4:22] well now it's it was mostly Gentile
[4:24] right for those five years and of course
[4:26] no Jews were allowed but they had
[4:28] forgotten a lot of the Jewish practices
[4:30] right or a lot of the Jewish word
[4:32] and now that Paul writes to him now
[4:34] they're having trouble between Jew and
[4:35] Gentile so Paul writes the letter to
[4:38] solve the problems in the church how
[4:40] many believe that these letters still
[4:41] solve all of our problems
[4:42] no doubt about it praise God as you know
[4:44] just take a brief thought you know uh
[4:46] Gentiles struggle I'm sorry the book of
[4:48] The Book of Galatians shows how that
[4:50] church struggle struggled with legalism
[4:51] right the Ephesus Church they were
[4:54] deeper but they still needed instruction
[4:56] especially on marriage right Ephesians
[4:59] chapter five Hallelujah and then the
[5:01] fivefold ministry there in Ephesians
[5:03] chapter four they needed that type of
[5:04] instruction uh the Philippians and the
[5:07] Colossians need an encouragement not so
[5:09] much from physical persecution but the
[5:12] spiritual deception that people were
[5:13] trying to bring upon them right and that
[5:15] relates a lot to us right we don't have
[5:18] physical battles at least not yet but we
[5:20] battle spiritual wickedness in high
[5:21] places
[5:22] right right and then the Corinthian
[5:24] Church was very carnal
[5:26] right they were very carnal they had uh
[5:29] people that weren't mourning over sexual
[5:31] sin in the church
[5:32] uh they would speak in tongues so much
[5:35] and they would have so many tongues
[5:37] interpretations there was too many and
[5:39] there was confusion and Paul had to set
[5:40] that in order
[5:42] in other words and then they were
[5:44] arguing about who's the best preacher
[5:45] they're always worried about who's the
[5:46] best preacher right
[5:48] Apollo cephas and
[5:50] so see church we can kind of see how
[5:52] every church needs a certain type of a
[5:54] message
[5:55] right our church when preachers come
[5:57] here they're going to preach in a
[5:58] certain way
[5:59] right where they might not have to
[6:01] preach that at another church so brother
[6:02] Diggs brother Diggs didn't have to
[6:04] preach to us about you guys need to sing
[6:05] to sing more you guys need to worship
[6:07] more right you'd have to preach on that
[6:09] so what did he preach to us he preached
[6:11] us about the sovereignty of God to trust
[6:13] in God
[6:14] right uh to to trust in the The Covenant
[6:17] of God hallelujah that God's going to
[6:19] bring us through amen hallelujah I think
[6:22] it's a blessing praise God I think it's
[6:23] a blessing that the Holy Ghost will give
[6:25] us the word that we have need of in the
[6:27] due season
[6:28] Hallelujah so you watch that you know
[6:30] you and as you listen to others you know
[6:31] sermons from other preachers you can see
[6:33] uh what they have need of
[6:35] you know what do the churches have need
[6:36] of and so our our need at this moment
[6:38] there was trusting in God's sovereignty
[6:40] and trusting in the promise of God in
[6:42] other words don't give up on God
[6:43] hallelujah
[6:45] Hallelujah we worship God we sing to God
[6:46] we love God we love one another but then
[6:48] we have needs as well and the Holy
[6:50] Spirit always is faithful to give us
[6:52] that which we have need of Amen
[6:54] and so uh here uh the book of Romans
[6:57] here Paul is going to he's going to uh
[6:59] unite the Jews and Gentiles into one
[7:01] Faith praise God and we're going to see
[7:04] uh we see here in this beginning of the
[7:05] chapter there's a lot of
[7:07] self-righteousness in this church
[7:10] now I wonder if we have that here
[7:12] people think they're so good or they're
[7:14] so holy they're better than other people
[7:16] now I hope not by God's grace but
[7:18] uh it's it's it needs to be preached
[7:20] praise God right all those millions of
[7:23] voices when brother man went beyond the
[7:24] current of time we're resting on the
[7:26] fact that brother Adam preached what
[7:28] Paul preached amen hallelujah thank God
[7:30] we're resting on that amen
[7:33] now Paul says these all men really are
[7:35] inexcusable now Paul says though people
[7:38] that judge others are inexcusable
[7:41] in our church it's a simple people
[7:43] judging people simple saying oh that
[7:45] guy's a serpent seed or there's no hope
[7:46] for that woman she's a devil
[7:49] or something like that just something
[7:50] where
[7:51] instead of being grieved for Sinners
[7:54] you're angry at sinners
[7:56] or secretly in your heart you want uh
[7:59] you want people to go to hell or or you
[8:01] want the judgments of God to fall on
[8:03] them
[8:04] something to that degree well Paul has
[8:06] to lay this out that we have no excuses
[8:08] when we judge others because we're
[8:10] guilty of the same things
[8:12] like many times we're guilty of the same
[8:15] things
[8:16] uh that's what he says here this there
[8:18] was a certain group of course that were
[8:20] judging others and they did the exact
[8:22] same things and we'll give some examples
[8:24] later in this chapter
[8:26] but I just want to show the difference
[8:27] this is this scripture is referring to
[8:29] Eternal judgment
[8:31] right
[8:33] but the Bible says that we are uh we are
[8:37] supposed to judge right we are supposed
[8:38] to judge I believe the Bible says in
[8:40] First Corinthians 2 that the spiritual
[8:42] person judges all things
[8:45] so there has to be some type of balance
[8:47] here
[8:48] right Paul says we judge all things and
[8:50] then he here he says if you judge others
[8:52] you're condemned
[8:54] so there's two kinds of judgment there's
[8:56] judging people eternally but you're not
[8:58] fit to do that
[9:00] right you and I don't have the
[9:02] qualification as we're god of the
[9:03] universe right so we can't we can't
[9:06] judge Eternal each other's Eternal
[9:08] destination but what we are we're Fruit
[9:10] judgers
[9:12] right we judge people's fruits because
[9:14] Jesus said you'll know them by their
[9:16] fruits
[9:18] so in other words we judge people's
[9:20] actions we do not judge their Eternal
[9:22] destination
[9:23] because what if somebody would have
[9:25] judged me in my actions when I was 16
[9:27] years old
[9:28] or 18 where they have any would they
[9:30] have had any hope for brother Jeff's
[9:31] probably not a lot of Hope probably not
[9:32] but thank God Amen look at the goodness
[9:35] of God Amen Hallelujah thank God Here I
[9:38] Stand All These Years Later amen
[9:40] rejoicing in what God has done and God
[9:42] continues to have mercy on me and
[9:44] strengthen me praise God and equip me
[9:46] for a service amen when I I feel like
[9:48] Paul many times you know God's the one
[9:50] that called me into this service praise
[9:52] God God called me from my mother's womb
[9:54] amen it wasn't a man-made begging me to
[9:57] be a preacher it wasn't a denomination
[9:58] begging me to be a servant of God God
[10:01] called me to this in church each one of
[10:02] us as we as we saw last week were
[10:04] fearfully wonderfully made praise God
[10:06] God has a purpose for each and every one
[10:08] of us the thing to do is find your
[10:09] purpose Hallelujah and then give give
[10:12] God everything you have to fulfill your
[10:14] purpose in this life amen
[10:16] God form you mother's womb praise God as
[10:18] we saw the Mother's Day sermon right he
[10:21] formed in your mother's womb and you're
[10:22] highly favored Hallelujah just like Mary
[10:25] was highly favored you're highly favored
[10:26] too praise God Amen brother Brown says
[10:29] the weakest Christian is stronger than
[10:31] Satan when he he or she's on their knees
[10:34] praise God
[10:35] right we have power anytime you get on
[10:38] your knees of prayer anytime you pray
[10:39] with sincerity you have power over
[10:41] wickedness you have power over evil
[10:43] spirits praise God
[10:45] what a blessing you're highly favored
[10:47] God is with you praise God and I'm going
[10:50] to get to this eventually but the more
[10:51] you pray it's like planting seeds
[10:54] right prayers are like seeds you plant
[10:56] and the more you plant the more you
[10:58] harvest praise God that's scripture
[11:01] because the Bible said Elijah the
[11:03] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[11:04] prevaileth much praise God
[11:07] and there he prayed and he prayed and he
[11:09] prayed and God hearkened to Elijah
[11:12] no God had it not rained for three and a
[11:14] half years but that's really not our
[11:16] prayers and maybe not it's not our
[11:17] ministry by God's grace but we can pray
[11:19] and ask God to move mountains praise God
[11:22] or move obstacles Hallelujah but it's
[11:25] fervent prayer hallelujah it's having a
[11:28] burden for prayer how many want a burden
[11:29] for prayer
[11:30] hallelujah amen
[11:33] so the scripture I was thinking of uh
[11:35] was Matthew 7 1 so let's go there by the
[11:37] grace of God
[11:40] you see some pretty good scriptures here
[11:43] by God's grace
[11:46] Matthew 7 1.
[11:55] now this is a uh uh the word judge here
[11:58] means condemn Jesus says judge not
[12:01] condemn not that you be not condemned
[12:04] right so we get this idea of
[12:06] uh having no mercy on people right
[12:09] this idea of maybe judging Eternal
[12:11] destinations
[12:13] for with what judgment ye judge ye shall
[12:15] be judged
[12:18] right
[12:19] and that word means condemnation for
[12:20] with what condemnation you judge ye
[12:22] shall be judged and with what measure
[12:24] you meet it should be measured to you
[12:28] okay so whatever uh whatever uh
[12:30] measuring line you use to judge others
[12:33] that's how you'll be judged by the
[12:34] church how many want to have mercy on on
[12:36] one another by God's grace
[12:39] I'm not saying I'm not saying let's be
[12:41] like the Corinthians church and and not
[12:43] uh and not uh grieve over sin but let's
[12:47] not Also let's not be quick to condemn
[12:50] people either
[12:51] let's be gracious let's be merciful
[12:53] because however you treat someone else
[12:55] when they're in sin that's how you're
[12:57] going to be treated
[12:58] right or when you're struggling or
[13:01] you're you're falling short and maybe
[13:03] you and I aren't living as high as we
[13:04] would like to live by the grace of God
[13:06] we're going through a valley
[13:08] right however we judge others others
[13:10] that's how we're going to have judgment
[13:12] when we go through struggles
[13:14] oh my
[13:15] God Lord have mercy Hallelujah the verse
[13:18] three now here he gets into this idea
[13:19] here of of condemning others and why
[13:21] behold is thou the moat that is in thy
[13:24] brother's eye
[13:25] but considers not the beam that is in
[13:28] thine own
[13:29] see you can see someone else's sin but
[13:32] can't see your own
[13:34] well the Bible says that we want to see
[13:35] our sin we've got to look in the mirror
[13:36] of God's word
[13:38] so we gotta look in the mirror of God's
[13:39] words with an honest heart praise God
[13:42] right before we start pointing out other
[13:43] people's faults that's why even you know
[13:45] like when I do the YouTube videos and I
[13:47] point out you know Branham Tabernacle
[13:48] the reason I do that is because I've
[13:50] gone to them publicly or I'm sorry yeah
[13:52] privately I've known to them privately
[13:54] right and I've looked in and I've said
[13:56] uh do I have that issue do I worship
[13:58] brother Brandon do I worship the tapes
[13:59] and I don't I've looked at myself in the
[14:01] word of God right I've examined Myself
[14:03] by the word of God and then I go out and
[14:06] I gotta call out other sins
[14:07] by God's grace but you got to look at
[14:10] yourself first
[14:11] right
[14:14] he says verse 4 or how wilt thou say to
[14:16] thy brother let me pull out the moat out
[14:19] of thine eye and behold a beam is in
[14:22] thine own eye
[14:24] let me help you brother but yet you're
[14:26] the one that needs help
[14:27] sister let me help you but you're the
[14:29] one that needs help praise God
[14:31] so what does this
[14:32] teaches us about verse five thou
[14:35] hypocrite so it speaks of hypocrisy
[14:38] right we shouldn't judge others if we're
[14:40] guilty the same things
[14:42] First cast out the beam out of thine own
[14:44] eye and then Thou shalt thou See Clearly
[14:47] to cast out the moat out of thy
[14:49] brother's eye
[14:51] all right so first we got to get our
[14:53] lives cleaned up and then we can help
[14:54] out others praise God is that right all
[14:57] right
[14:58] Hallelujah
[15:00] now this other scripture about the Lord
[15:02] just come to me here
[15:03] judge righteous judgment
[15:07] all right so let's go to that one here
[15:09] let me pull it up here
[15:11] I'm sorry I didn't have this one ready
[15:13] just kind of came to me here
[15:17] oh yeah John 7. thank you John 7 24.
[15:19] thanks for your patience there this will
[15:21] be the last one and we'll move on here
[15:23] John 7 24.
[15:40] okay John 7 24 judge not according to
[15:43] appearance but judge righteous judgment
[15:47] now that's a difficult thing praise God
[15:49] it's a difficult thing because we so
[15:51] rely upon our five senses
[15:54] it's kind of like what Samuel or I'm
[15:56] sorry what God told Samuel don't look on
[15:58] the outward appearance look on the heart
[16:01] and many times you can tell people's
[16:02] hearts by the words they speak
[16:04] because Jesus says from the abundance of
[16:06] the heart the mouth speaketh right my
[16:09] goodness so so we got to take all these
[16:12] scriptures about judgment Jesus says
[16:15] judge not in other words don't condemn
[16:16] but here he says judge righteous
[16:18] judgment
[16:19] I think Austin and I have talked to
[16:20] people they say oh you're judging me
[16:21] right they'll say you're judging me well
[16:23] we're not judging your Eternal
[16:24] destination we're judging your words and
[16:26] your actions and we're supposed to do
[16:28] that
[16:30] Hallelujah there's one more let me uh I
[16:32] believe the scripture is abound in
[16:34] judgment if I'm not mistaken I think
[16:35] that's from the
[16:37] uh the series on the Philippians abound
[16:40] in judgment here
[16:44] yeah Philippians 1 verse nine yeah thank
[16:46] you Philippians 1 verse 9.
[16:49] this meant a lot to me as I was
[16:50] preaching that uh series there
[16:53] because I realized that God doesn't want
[16:56] us to do less judging of fruits God
[16:59] wants us to grow in our judgment because
[17:01] the word means discernment
[17:03] right and brother Brandon said that's
[17:04] the great thing the tool we need for the
[17:06] end times he said is the anointing of
[17:08] discernment to judge between right and
[17:11] wrong
[17:12] to judge between the Holy Spirit and the
[17:14] Antichrist spirit
[17:16] and this was a Prayer church so you got
[17:18] you got the right to pray for this God
[17:20] give me some discernment in my life to
[17:22] discern the right people for me right
[17:25] the people that I should be friends with
[17:27] as you get older marriage discern if if
[17:30] you should marry the person right if you
[17:31] should Court a person right
[17:33] I mean you're going to need discernment
[17:34] praise God hallelujah
[17:36] amen
[17:38] or wherever any major decision any
[17:40] decision in life grow in discernment and
[17:43] that's what Paul says uh Philippians 1 9
[17:45] and this I pray that your love may about
[17:47] more yet more and more
[17:49] in knowledge and in all judgment or
[17:53] discernment
[17:54] so we've got to grow in our knowledge of
[17:56] God and we've got to grow in our
[17:57] discernment and this is done by the love
[17:59] of God
[18:00] but falling and falling more in love
[18:02] with God you become you have more
[18:05] knowledge and you have more discernment
[18:08] Hallelujah that's what we find churches
[18:10] time goes on you know when technology
[18:12] changes it's still the same devil behind
[18:14] all the new technologies
[18:16] right the sermon can pick that up it's
[18:19] the same thing right it's you know uh
[18:22] when I was growing up we had walkmans
[18:23] you know with CDs
[18:25] and boom boxes now I never carried one
[18:27] but I had one in my room some people
[18:29] carried them down the street I never did
[18:30] that I never want to lose my hearing
[18:32] when I was a teenager I knew better than
[18:34] that and of course I didn't have the
[18:35] money to buy all those batteries either
[18:37] but uh
[18:39] but all that was was a distraction you
[18:41] know it was just it was evil spirits
[18:43] well all I mean that's all the same same
[18:45] thing today you know that now it's on
[18:47] the phone right now it's just on the
[18:49] cell phone
[18:50] right now people got cell phones or they
[18:52] got the earbuds or whatever you know
[18:53] it's the same thing right and
[18:55] discernment should help us to be able to
[18:57] discern the right messages from the
[19:00] wrong messages praise God Hallelujah and
[19:02] we should grow we should grow in
[19:04] knowledge of God and in all judgment so
[19:06] if someone says uh you're judging me say
[19:08] thank you I am I'm judging your fruits
[19:10] praise God
[19:11] I'm judging your words
[19:14] and say well you don't like the word
[19:15] judge well then say discern I'm
[19:17] Discerning you
[19:18] right
[19:19] let's use that word you don't like the
[19:21] word judge let's use the word
[19:22] discernment
[19:24] hallelujah praise God
[19:26] all right praise the Lord now
[19:29] so Jesus commands us to judge and Paul
[19:32] commands us to abound or increase our
[19:35] discernment
[19:36] praise God
[19:39] now verse two let's go back to Romans 2
[19:41] verse 2.
[19:51] Romans 2 verse 2. but we are sure that
[19:54] the Judgment of God is according to
[19:56] truth against them which commit such
[19:59] things
[20:00] so in other words we know God is going
[20:02] to judge truly
[20:04] Hallelujah when God judges a person
[20:06] whether heaven or hell it's going to be
[20:08] the right judgment the church we have a
[20:10] lot of questions down here on Earth
[20:11] don't we
[20:12] when people passed away were they saved
[20:15] or not
[20:15] right brother Ray were they filled with
[20:17] the Holy Ghost or not
[20:19] it's hard sometimes to know it's hard we
[20:22] don't because we don't see what's going
[20:23] on we only see them at certain times
[20:25] but God has a way he's going to judge
[20:27] everybody exactly right now think about
[20:29] that
[20:31] and he could just look right to the to
[20:33] their soul where you can look right into
[20:35] their soul
[20:36] he searches the Reigns and the hearts
[20:38] and he knows church he knows if they're
[20:40] putting on a spiritual act here and then
[20:41] if they're living like a devil at home
[20:44] he knows it right but he also knows if
[20:47] you're struggling and trying to stay
[20:48] with the word of God and he knows if
[20:50] you're really trying to overcome or not
[20:52] praise God
[20:53] hallelujah amen
[20:56] it's clear to God God can clearly see
[20:58] it's just like black and white right
[21:01] he knows either you're trying or you're
[21:03] really not trying you're you're
[21:04] overcoming or you're not overcoming
[21:06] praise God oh my God can judge you
[21:08] exactly right
[21:11] I mean I had to preach that one friend's
[21:13] uh funeral a couple years ago and he was
[21:15] an awful sinner
[21:17] and church is hard to stare at people in
[21:19] a hundred people in a funeral room
[21:21] and try to be happy for the man but I
[21:25] was weeping and crying in my hometown
[21:26] and I said God will do
[21:29] uh with this man what's exactly right I
[21:31] think I won't use one of these
[21:32] scriptures actually God will judge God
[21:34] will judge him exactly Fair
[21:37] and that's what that's just why I left
[21:38] it at I didn't say thank God he's in
[21:39] heaven thank God he's saved I said God
[21:42] knew his heart and God will judge him
[21:43] it's the Purdue man there it is the
[21:44] Purdue man
[21:47] uh
[21:48] and I know he lived a dirty life I I
[21:50] knew it but his son thought saw me on
[21:52] Facebook as a preacher and he asked me
[21:54] to do the funeral
[21:55] so I thought I'd do it and it was a
[21:57] blessing to preach the gospel praise God
[21:58] my mom even came and got to hear me
[22:00] preach again
[22:01] but we have nothing to worry about God
[22:03] looks past the outward he looks right
[22:06] down to the heart amen aren't you glad
[22:08] amen hallelujah like brother Madison we
[22:10] read that quote from Brother Brown a few
[22:11] weeks ago
[22:12] brother random said God sees that you're
[22:14] trying to serve him Hallelujah God sees
[22:18] your efforts amen hallelujah all her
[22:19] efforts are not perfect right but like
[22:21] brothers said just keep fire like
[22:23] Eisenhower just keep putting the bullets
[22:25] in and keep fire one of these times
[22:26] you're going to hit the target praise
[22:28] God
[22:29] God sees your efforts praise God
[22:33] now what's he talking about those that
[22:34] are worthy
[22:36] of judgment commit what things it's the
[22:38] things in chapter one I'm going to read
[22:40] through them again briefly
[22:41] quickly
[22:43] just to reiterate because you went over
[22:45] this two weeks ago
[22:48] but this is a total list of uh this is a
[22:51] total list of modern America right if
[22:53] you go to verse 28 and even as they did
[22:56] not like to retain God in their
[22:57] knowledge
[22:58] they don't they don't bring up scripture
[23:00] when they have discussions they don't
[23:01] talk about the word of God they don't
[23:03] care what the word of God says they just
[23:06] say I believe in God but they don't
[23:08] retain the knowledge of God the Bible
[23:10] just said grow in knowledge amen I just
[23:12] we just read it praise God
[23:14] but they don't retain God's word
[23:16] God gave them over to represent mine to
[23:18] do those things which are not convenient
[23:20] being filled with all unrighteousness
[23:22] fornication wickedness covetousness
[23:25] maliciousness full of Envy murder debate
[23:28] deceit malignity Whispers now remember I
[23:32] gave you all the definitions two weeks
[23:33] ago I can't remember how the definition
[23:34] is now he says backbiters haters of God
[23:38] despiteful proud boasters inventors of
[23:41] evil things
[23:42] disobedient to parents
[23:45] without understanding Covenant Breakers
[23:47] without natural affection implacable
[23:50] unmerciful now see there's there's
[23:52] unmerciful right not showing Mercy on
[23:54] people
[23:56] who knowing the Judgment of God that
[23:58] they which commit such things are worthy
[24:00] of death not only do the same but have
[24:02] pleasure in them that do them
[24:05] so they just enjoy all the wicked
[24:07] Pleasures uh their lovers of pleasures
[24:09] and they're not lovers of God they're
[24:11] haters of God
[24:13] okay so Paul says clearly in verse 2 God
[24:17] will judge them according to truth
[24:20] God will give them exactly what they
[24:22] deserve
[24:23] bye that'll Shake us up a little bit
[24:25] here by God's grace all right chapter 2
[24:28] verse 3 and think as thou this o man
[24:31] that judges them which do such things
[24:34] and do us the same that thou shalt
[24:36] escape the Judgment of God think about
[24:38] that think about that Jews or people in
[24:40] this church uh we're blasting people for
[24:43] uh fornication and yet they were guilty
[24:46] of it
[24:48] right they're blessing people for
[24:51] murdering and covetousness yet they
[24:53] murdered and they were covetous
[24:57] right
[24:59] now church for us what do we what do we
[25:01] often hit we always talk about modest
[25:02] clothes
[25:04] right it would be a hypocrisy if I'm
[25:05] preaching modest clothes and then you
[25:07] see me out there with my shirt off in
[25:09] public or something like that
[25:11] that's what they are doing
[25:13] right they're condemned it'd be like me
[25:15] preaching on Sunday about not smoking
[25:17] then going smoking tomorrow that'd be
[25:19] hypocrisy
[25:20] but this is what now look this was what
[25:22] happened in a book of Acts church right
[25:25] if this is an early church
[25:28] this is happening amongst believers
[25:34] I
[25:36] so what do we must do we must avoid
[25:38] sinful self-righteousness and pride
[25:43] right it's easy to bash others about
[25:45] like uh it's easy to I shouldn't say
[25:47] bash but it's easy to warn the
[25:50] homosexual crowd but do we have any
[25:51] sexual sins in our lives
[25:53] see
[25:55] it's the same thing right sexual sin or
[25:58] just sin in general
[26:00] right it doesn't matter any of those
[26:01] like I said
[26:03] any of these
[26:04] are we always obedient are the young
[26:06] people always obedient to their parents
[26:09] right children obedient to their parents
[26:11] Hallelujah
[26:13] do we ever back by others talk bad about
[26:16] them behind their back right
[26:18] I mean same idea same thing
[26:21] so we must not be self-righteous and
[26:23] prideful we've got to be humble praise
[26:25] God got to be humble verse 4. or
[26:28] despises thou The Riches of his goodness
[26:32] and forbearance and long-suffering think
[26:35] about that people that judge others they
[26:38] despise God's goodness they just want to
[26:40] see people that are struggling they want
[26:41] to see them fall they want to see them
[26:43] instantly be killed and go to hell or
[26:44] something like that that's what they
[26:46] desire
[26:47] and Paul says don't you know don't you
[26:49] just don't you know you despise The
[26:51] Riches of God's goodness and his
[26:53] long-suffering
[26:55] he says don't you know that the goodness
[26:57] of God is what leads us to repentance
[27:01] the fact that God is so good I ran from
[27:04] God for 19 years with the goodness of
[27:06] God never gave up on me praise God
[27:09] now I was a child some of those years so
[27:11] let's say you know
[27:12] 12 or 15 12 or 13 or 14 years I ran from
[27:16] God
[27:16] but God was rich in Mercy praise God
[27:19] hallelujah
[27:20] now this attitude church is kind of like
[27:22] uh
[27:24] it gets it can be a complex like a god
[27:27] on Jonah
[27:28] Jonah was a prophet of God
[27:31] and yet this happened to him
[27:34] he despised The Riches of goodness to
[27:37] the ninevites
[27:40] he was all concerned about a gourd he
[27:43] was all disappointed that the gourd was
[27:45] destroyed
[27:46] his gourd his shade
[27:48] he was more upset about that
[27:51] right and he was all concerned about
[27:53] that and not con and they was upset that
[27:55] the ninevites were going to be killed
[27:57] I'll say that in the universe we're
[27:58] going to be saved
[28:01] he despised the goodness of God he
[28:03] wanted to see them die right but then he
[28:05] was then he wanted he wanted Mercy right
[28:08] he wanted Mercy for himself shade for
[28:09] himself but he wanted to see destruction
[28:11] on the ninevites
[28:14] yet he was saved yet he was a prophet
[28:16] yet him in the Wales Valley was a type
[28:18] of Christ amen
[28:21] we use him as a type of Jesus Christ
[28:23] death burial Resurrection yet he
[28:25] despised the goodness of God
[28:28] for that little moment
[28:29] so see Church we're not immune to it
[28:32] we're not immune to it at all
[28:34] we got to be careful
[28:36] right like brother random I preached an
[28:37] old sermon on it years ago and I think
[28:39] it was 2015. a whole sermon on how
[28:41] brother man battled the critical spirit
[28:43] and he said I'm haunted by a critical
[28:45] spirit and he's even at the pope he said
[28:47] pray for me I'm haunted by this critical
[28:49] spirit and he said I'm I'm critical of
[28:52] the voice of healing I'm critical of
[28:54] preachers that I hear about he said I'm
[28:55] just critical of everybody now see
[28:57] Church
[28:58] so there's got to be a way to discern
[29:01] things but not be critical
[29:03] then the Bible then the Bible just say
[29:05] grow in all judgment in the Bible just
[29:07] said hey so we're supposed to grow in
[29:09] discernment but yet not have a critical
[29:11] or negative attitude towards people
[29:15] I think I think the best way to do this
[29:17] church just watch and observe people
[29:20] and recognize in your mind you make a
[29:21] checklist okay that one's off the word
[29:23] there off the word there off the word
[29:25] there but don't say anything bad about
[29:26] it
[29:28] in other words don't try to kill their
[29:29] influence
[29:30] but you just keep a record right just
[29:33] keep a mental note
[29:35] right
[29:38] like when certain people will come from
[29:39] certain churches well I know that church
[29:41] in my mind I'm not going to say anything
[29:42] bad about the church
[29:43] but in my mind I know they allow women
[29:45] to wear makeup we talk about this right
[29:48] I won't blast I won't blast that church
[29:50] from the pulpit but I know that church
[29:52] allows makeup mascara trimmed hair high
[29:55] heels
[29:57] I've got to have discernment yet they
[29:59] say they believe the masters of the hour
[30:01] and growing and booming or something
[30:03] like that you know what I mean just
[30:04] everybody loves it everybody loves
[30:06] certain parts but in my mind I got a
[30:08] mental discernment list
[30:09] and if I see them I'll say how you doing
[30:11] God bless you but I you know I won't say
[30:13] anything unless I feel prompted by God
[30:17] right
[30:19] no maybe in the future I'll have to go
[30:20] to that person privately that church
[30:22] privately and then I might have to make
[30:23] a YouTube about it we'll see I'm done
[30:26] I'm just joking
[30:27] you know however you feel that by the
[30:29] Holy Spirit
[30:30] Church you can't let the bars up because
[30:33] then the goats come in
[30:35] and that's the best way to let the goats
[30:37] in is by bringing the world in
[30:40] makeup mascara
[30:42] painted on uh fingernails
[30:45] and for the men uh drinking alcohol
[30:48] drinking wine all kinds of things that
[30:50] are unsuitable for Christians
[30:53] watching the Super Bowls and things like
[30:55] that that's unsuitable for a Christian
[30:57] when you do that you're not separated
[30:59] from the world you're a part of the
[31:01] world
[31:02] but the Bible said be holy for I'm holy
[31:05] be separate from the world because I'm
[31:07] separate from the world
[31:09] amen
[31:12] all right so I thought that wasn't in my
[31:13] notes but that kind of reminded me of
[31:15] our conversation the other night
[31:17] good conversations we have to discern
[31:19] all things we should get better at
[31:21] Discerning and yet not be critical in
[31:24] condemning of people
[31:27] right we just saw that from the
[31:28] scriptures I showed you judge not unless
[31:31] you be judged and you can only help
[31:32] somebody if you've got that sin under
[31:34] control in your life or can I say this
[31:36] better word crucified in your life
[31:39] right
[31:42] you can only help somebody
[31:44] if the sins are crucified in your life
[31:47] Hallelujah
[31:51] amen
[31:53] I just like that scripture you know in
[31:54] Luke 15 how
[31:58] The Prodigal had to remember the
[31:59] goodness of God when he was in the pig
[32:01] pen
[32:02] he had to remember it he's eating Pig's
[32:05] food
[32:06] it's a it's basically like an
[32:07] Abomination to Jews right pigs and Swine
[32:10] it's an Abomination but there he comes
[32:12] to himself and he says surely
[32:15] uh if I just humble myself and go to my
[32:18] father he'll at least let me be a
[32:20] servant in his house what is the church
[32:22] he trusted in this goodness of his
[32:24] father amen he knew his father good
[32:26] enough to know that the father will have
[32:28] mercy on me and that's how we should act
[32:30] we might stumble we might fall we might
[32:32] make a mistake but let's remember our
[32:33] father is merciful amen
[32:37] and guess what he trusts in the mercy of
[32:38] the father what do you get a lot more
[32:40] than that amen hallelujah amen he got a
[32:43] ring he got a new robe amen you got a
[32:46] party praise God a graduation party
[32:49] he got a good party praise God
[32:52] he got all the status back
[32:55] but one thing he never had was the
[32:57] reward that the Elder son was going to
[32:59] have
[33:01] right some people look they make so much
[33:04] evil the Elder son but Church remember
[33:06] the father said you have everything that
[33:08] belongs to me in other words you have
[33:10] all the rewards
[33:13] the father or the younger one just the
[33:15] older one just got a critical spirit
[33:16] there it is
[33:18] it's got a critical spear
[33:21] but the father said all that I have is
[33:23] yours in other words all the treasures
[33:25] are yours
[33:27] and the younger one would have no reward
[33:30] so it's a lesson for all of us
[33:32] if somebody leaves comes back or
[33:34] whatever uh let's not you know if you
[33:37] were faithful the whole time don't be
[33:39] discouraged God has great rewards for
[33:41] you praise God right
[33:43] that's what the Bible says amen
[33:45] he had to know my dad is good
[33:49] I'm the I'm the Rascal
[33:52] my dad was good to me I'm the Rascal
[33:55] right
[33:57] and so it's the goodness of God that
[34:00] leads us to repentance praise God oh I
[34:02] remember on the boat remember one time
[34:04] Jesus said cast the net on the other
[34:06] side Peter said what do you mean we
[34:08] fished all night I'm Gonna Catch nothing
[34:12] he said yet for your sake I'll do it
[34:15] and then he takes the net and he throws
[34:17] it over and they pull it on the fish and
[34:19] what did Peter do
[34:21] he said Lord depart from me I'm a sinful
[34:23] man
[34:25] the goodness of God led him to
[34:27] repentance
[34:28] the church said
[34:31] Jesus was so good to him think about
[34:33] that how many of you ever worked all
[34:34] night and never made one dollar
[34:38] nobody nobody said because you work you
[34:40] get paid by the hour
[34:42] but now Peter he got paid in fishes by
[34:44] the hour
[34:45] he worked all night got nothing got a
[34:48] little snippy with Jesus Jesus still
[34:50] blesses him and he sees the goodness of
[34:52] God he said now look at this church the
[34:54] prince of God made him humble and
[34:56] realized what a sinner he was
[34:59] that's what that's what the moments of
[35:01] the presence of God will always make you
[35:03] feel humble praise God
[35:04] now of course there's
[35:06] bubble dancing and you're right like I
[35:08] said the spirit of God bubbling up in
[35:09] you that's a different kind of anointing
[35:11] right
[35:12] but when we're when we're in fault and
[35:15] the spirit of God comes to us and makes
[35:17] us humble and the goodness of God is
[35:19] what leads us to repent praise God
[35:21] amen all right verse five trying to get
[35:25] where I need to go here by God's grace
[35:26] at least where I felt like I need to go
[35:28] by the grace of God Romans 2 verse 5.
[35:30] but after thy hardness and look the
[35:32] hardness and in penitent in repentant
[35:35] heart Treasures up unto thyself Wrath
[35:40] so see a hard heart stores up Treasure
[35:43] of Wrath now that's not really a
[35:45] treasure uh in our way of thinking about
[35:47] it but it is it is a reward it's all
[35:49] evil reward right it's a uh it's a
[35:52] judgment reward
[35:53] a hard heart an unrepentant heart will
[35:56] yield to God's Wrath that's why church
[35:58] we ought to take every service and we
[36:01] ought to say Lord if there's anything in
[36:02] my life forgive me of it
[36:08] people fall away when they fail to
[36:10] repent
[36:12] of their daily sins there it is right
[36:13] there
[36:16] see you know church if you're confessing
[36:18] your sins every day God's Gonna you're
[36:20] gonna stay in good fellowship with God
[36:21] but it's when people won't repent week
[36:24] after week they won't repent service
[36:25] after service they'll fail to repent
[36:27] they'll they'll fail to apologize and
[36:30] ask God to forgive them and this is what
[36:33] stores up the wrath of God against them
[36:36] right
[36:39] God is a merciful father right God is
[36:41] slow to anger but here now we know it
[36:43] what brings this anger on it's service
[36:46] after service or damn after day the
[36:48] spirit of God showing you should repent
[36:50] of something and you don't repent of it
[36:52] and that builds up to God's Wrath
[36:55] not upon the believer but of course this
[36:57] will be on the Sinners those that are
[36:59] being judged
[37:01] eternally like the Bible says here
[37:05] and the revelation of the righteous
[37:07] Judgment of God Church there's two kinds
[37:10] of hard hearts
[37:13] here is the hard heart that gets the
[37:15] wrath of God these are the lost people
[37:18] right these are the vessels that are
[37:19] fitted unto destruction but there's
[37:21] another kind of hard heart that we have
[37:23] to battle
[37:25] that's found in Mark 16 14. let's read
[37:27] that there Mark 16 14.
[37:29] who knows what verse that is
[37:33] Mark 16 14.
[37:40] let's not think well oh brother Jess
[37:42] I'll never get a hard heart I always be
[37:43] tenderhearted toward god well give it
[37:45] some time
[37:47] you're going to be tested with time
[37:49] all of us have to pass through the Hall
[37:51] of critics right all of us have to be
[37:52] tested to have a testimony
[37:56] look at this
[37:57] and afterward he Jesus appeared unto
[38:00] leaven as they sat at me and upgraded
[38:02] them with their unbelief and what
[38:04] hardness the 11 preachers
[38:08] Malachi preachers can get hard hearts
[38:14] your pastor can get a hard heart if I'm
[38:15] not careful
[38:18] and Jesus will come and what he'll do
[38:19] he'll rebuke us for hard hearts
[38:22] and we've got to be open to that praise
[38:24] God we've got to be open to Lord be
[38:26] honest with God lord just show me if I
[38:28] got a hard heart in this situation
[38:31] now were these 11 lost no no no they
[38:35] were they were the Beloved praise God
[38:38] right those were his inner circle
[38:42] these are the ones that stayed 70 left
[38:44] and then Judas these 11 were left
[38:48] yeah right
[38:49] and yet they had Hardness of Heart in
[38:51] the midst of the trial their leader got
[38:53] crucified
[38:54] right right before them they all
[38:56] scattered in Iran they're all ashamed of
[38:57] themselves
[39:00] right
[39:01] and then they don't believe they don't
[39:03] understand Jesus told them about the
[39:04] resurrection they didn't catch it none
[39:06] of us would have
[39:07] but Jesus says you've got a hard heart
[39:10] because you're not believing the promise
[39:12] of God
[39:13] church as the Rapture appears as a
[39:16] Rapture it comes closer I want to Tender
[39:19] Heart toward God
[39:20] I don't want to hard heart toward the
[39:22] Rapture thinking oh God will never do it
[39:23] to me or God would never use me God
[39:26] could never Rapture me I want to saw
[39:28] tender heart towards God Amen and the
[39:30] best way to do that is constantly repent
[39:32] praise God Amen if you need to amen when
[39:34] you need to
[39:36] stay soft toward God say in love with
[39:39] Jesus Hallelujah
[39:42] so there's two kinds of hard hearts
[39:44] there's a heart and a soul that will
[39:46] never be saved right that's not us we're
[39:48] saved by God's grace
[39:49] but what we've got to battle is When
[39:51] Trials come and our hearts get hard and
[39:53] we disbelieve that God can change the
[39:55] situation
[39:57] so may God give us Grace to know he that
[39:59] he can change the situation
[40:02] Hallelujah
[40:05] remember like in Exodus 4 21 God
[40:08] hardened Pharaoh's heart
[40:10] but Romans 9 as we'll get to maybe in a
[40:13] few months I don't know
[40:16] Pharaoh is the modern example of he is a
[40:20] predestinated vessel unto destruction
[40:24] and yet God gave him free more agency
[40:28] he could have softened his heart but God
[40:31] knew he never would
[40:33] think about that after the frogs left
[40:37] if I had frogs in my cup my coffee cup
[40:40] every morning right if I had frogs in my
[40:42] lunch and then they were away I'd say
[40:44] hallelujah thank you God if I had frogs
[40:46] crawl into my shirt
[40:48] all day and then I finally all the frogs
[40:50] are gone and say hallelujah thank you
[40:51] God that's not what Pharaoh did
[40:53] he got harder
[40:55] he got a harder heart he got upset with
[40:58] God more and more but see we would have
[41:00] said hallelujah thank God all the lights
[41:03] are gone thank God all the swarms of
[41:06] fleas are gone thank God Hallelujah
[41:09] but he didn't even have that in him
[41:11] right he chose
[41:13] to disobey he chose to be a vessel Of
[41:16] Dishonor so God knew that
[41:18] right because he must have had lusts and
[41:19] Pleasures with his false gods so God
[41:22] hardened him again God would make him
[41:24] harder and harder and God has power to
[41:26] do that because he has power over the
[41:28] clay amen ah
[41:31] Hallelujah he's the Potter
[41:34] he can make a vessel any way he was
[41:36] thank you ought to shout and rejoice if
[41:39] you're a vessel of God's honor
[41:40] hallelujah amen
[41:42] thank God Amen thank God we can repent
[41:45] thank God we can glorify the Lord and
[41:47] worship God and love God with all of our
[41:49] hearts praise God yes we make mistakes
[41:51] but thank God overall we're trying to
[41:54] serve God the best we can and we have a
[41:56] heart to love Jesus amen
[41:58] oh my thank God
[42:01] but instead of it but instead some
[42:03] people they get blessings from God and
[42:04] they just get harder toward God
[42:09] let's not be like that
[42:11] like I've always said let's be that one
[42:13] leper that comes back to thank God in
[42:15] other words
[42:16] when Sunday or Wednesday comes you'll be
[42:18] one to put your testimony in I want to
[42:20] hear what God has done for you
[42:22] God can take away a hundred thousand
[42:24] dollars in medical bills right sister
[42:26] Hallelujah
[42:28] three thousand whatever it was amen
[42:30] thank God that's a testimony to God's
[42:32] grace amen
[42:34] and we ought to come back and give God
[42:36] some thanks
[42:37] right
[42:39] and not be hardened by the trials of
[42:42] life
[42:42] and get upset with God or anything but
[42:45] be soft and sweet towards the Lord
[42:47] because God is merciful to us amen
[42:49] hallelujah verse six here's kind of
[42:52] where I want to get you I'm not sure how
[42:53] much I'll go beyond this one right here
[43:02] Romans 2 Verse 6 who will render to
[43:05] every man according to his deeds
[43:10] so Paul says
[43:13] sinners
[43:15] uh
[43:17] fail to repent and they get the wrath of
[43:19] God and then Paul says
[43:22] God will give to every man God will
[43:24] render to them God will restore to them
[43:26] the word in the Greek means to pay off
[43:29] every man for what he does
[43:31] in other words there's going to be a
[43:32] Payday for all your actions
[43:34] and thank God that we're doing the right
[43:36] actions
[43:37] Hallelujah there's going to be a Payday
[43:40] he will render to every man and woman
[43:43] according to their Deeds Done In the
[43:46] Flesh that says in another place
[43:47] right all the Deeds Done think of the
[43:49] Deeds you did today
[43:51] did you work hard at work
[43:54] did you pay your tithes and offerings
[43:56] did you Worship the Lord did you help
[43:58] out the friend who needed help what'd
[44:00] you do today
[44:01] whatever you did for God God's going to
[44:03] reward you for that
[44:05] Hallelujah remember you work hard
[44:06] remember we saw that in Colossians
[44:09] there is eternal rewards for working
[44:11] hard on your job
[44:13] there's a reward for that because that's
[44:15] faithful
[44:16] you're not working for the boss really
[44:17] you're working for God
[44:19] there's rewards that go along with that
[44:22] Hallelujah
[44:24] I just had a this was a special
[44:25] testimony for me
[44:28] I was I was uh testifying about our our
[44:31] principal being a Christian and I was
[44:33] testifying to the families today and I
[44:35] said that principle was an answer to my
[44:36] prayers

[44:40] said Mr Smith you're the answer to our
[44:42] prayers
[44:43] thank God Amen I wasn't looking for a
[44:46] compliments or anything like that but I
[44:48] was actually in the process of

[44:55] her name thank you I forgot her

[49:49] homosexual agenda transgender agenda all
[49:52] that the murderers and the cities the
[49:55] unrest the violence they're reaping
[49:57] right what they've sowed for all those
[50:00] years I was listening to a a preacher
[50:02] from the 90s
[50:06] and then he said 50 years ago in 1940
[50:09] the biggest problem in high schools that
[50:12] teachers had to deal with
[50:13] was talking too much
[50:16] that was the biggest problem
[50:18] and then he gave data from 1990 what's
[50:20] the biggest problem in high schools rape
[50:25] how can you go from just talking too
[50:27] much jobs really man my class was really
[50:30] chatty to my my class they're raping one
[50:33] another
[50:35] that was from 1940 to 1990. see and in
[50:40] that time they took prayer out of school
[50:41] and what happened
[50:43] they sowed to the wind they're reaping
[50:45] the Whirlwind
[50:51] so that's good scripture there so you
[50:52] can see that of course we're aware of
[50:54] these things but
[50:56] just going to point it out about you
[50:57] reap what you sow Emma do you want to
[50:59] read that Psalm 126 verse 5.
[51:04] amen hallelujah
[51:07] see we're going to go through hard
[51:08] Seasons right after church we got to cry
[51:10] it out sometimes you're gonna cry

[51:15] righteous man or woman prevails much
[51:17] praise God
[51:19] Hallelujah

[51:23] Austin but we sure got the joy back
[51:25] Hallelujah

[51:32] God for
[51:34] and then God answers and now joy joy has
[51:37] come praise God
[51:38] it's a promise
[51:41] all those tears God sees each one of
[51:43] them and they're like little seeds that
[51:45] fall down there now your your tissue
[51:46] might catch them but God's actually
[51:48] catching them in a charger up there in
[51:50] heaven right
[51:51] sketching the prayers of the Saints
[51:53] they're like little seeds
[51:55] and God sees each and every one of those
[51:57] Hallelujah
[51:58] and God will bring the joy back in other
[52:00] words when you're lacking joy and you're
[52:02] crying out to God and your desire for
[52:04] God to restore your joy God is going to
[52:06] hear that God will restore it you'll
[52:08] feel joyful again your church you're
[52:10] going to hear you're going to have days
[52:11] when it sounds like the birds are all
[52:13] singing you're on cloud nine God's
[52:15] giving you the victories and you're
[52:16] walking in faith Hallelujah you're not
[52:19] walking to defeatism and depression and
[52:21] discouragement but you're walking in
[52:23] faith Hallelujah
[52:24] amen just keep crying and keep crying
[52:28] out to God the Bible says those are
[52:30] seeds and you'll reap Joy Hallelujah
[52:33] oh what a blessing amen
[52:35] what a blessing
[52:38] like like the one example I always give
[52:40] is the Roe v Wade from 2017 on I cried
[52:43] numerous times over and over maybe 15
[52:45] 20. I don't know how many times maybe
[52:46] more at this altar
[52:48] and then the joy comes in June of 2022
[52:51] it's it's over Roe v Wade's over praise
[52:54] God and they estimated one month that
[52:56] four thousand babies were saved in Texas
[52:57] alone and now spreading to all those all
[53:00] those uh States all the conservative
[53:02] States
[53:03] what a blessing
[53:05] so this is proof this is proven in my
[53:08] life
[53:09] it's proven in our lives let's believe
[53:11] God let's let's find those areas where
[53:13] we're struggling or where we have
[53:15] questions and let's pray about him let's
[53:17] remember when we cry God sees our tears
[53:19] and let's trust that God will answer
[53:21] praise God
[53:22] amen all right Galatians 6 verse 9
[53:25] brother
[53:33] amen thank you brother
[53:35] just an encouraging scripture that
[53:36] doesn't sound a lot like Romans 2 7
[53:40] right don't be wearing while doing
[53:44] because in due season you'll reap just
[53:46] don't give up
[53:48] just don't give up just don't let the
[53:50] guards down just don't throw in the
[53:53] towel praise God
[53:55] patient continuance leads to eternal
[53:59] life
[54:00] that's why I love that song you're
[54:01] saying on Sunday I will wait for you
[54:03] through the storms and through the night
[54:06] I'll wait for you until my soul is
[54:08] satisfied that means there's gonna be
[54:10] sometimes your Soul's not satisfied
[54:12] but you just got to keep waiting and God
[54:14] will satisfy your soul
[54:16] keep trusting in God keep waiting in God
[54:19] one thing's for sure if we leave God
[54:20] we're not going to get anything from God
[54:23] and the Bible says in Hebrews 11 God's
[54:25] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[54:28] him praise God that's one reason people
[54:29] don't get rewards they don't diligently
[54:31] seek God like they ought to
[54:35] that's right let's read that Romans 11.
[54:37] let's read that then you can see
[54:39] oh I read that tonight
[54:43] verse six Romans I'm sorry Hebrews 11 6
[54:45] sorry Hebrews 11 6.
[54:48] let's read that together
[54:49] you got up there huh
[54:51] let's read this whole thing together
[54:53] ready one two three but without faith is
[54:55] it impossible to please him for he that
[54:59] cometh to God must believe that he is
[55:02] and that he is rewarder of them that
[55:05] diligently seek him sometimes seek Him
[55:08] diligently seek him
[55:10] stay with it patient continuance don't
[55:13] give up on God hallelujah
[55:16] amen
[55:17] all right
[55:19] now I want to close with this here give
[55:20] me 10 minutes here
[55:27] by God's grace
[55:29] I really believe that
[55:32] Church there's so many examples of
[55:34] people reaping what they sowed in the
[55:36] Bible
[55:37] this is what inspired me when brother
[55:38] Diggs was talking about David and
[55:39] Goliath I was like oh that's right
[55:41] Goliath died by his own sword
[55:44] so I thought about this one Jacob
[55:46] deceived his father for the right for
[55:49] the blessing but then later his
[55:51] father-in-law deceived him by giving him
[55:52] Leah
[55:54] you reap what you sow
[55:57] right
[56:00] this one I heard a brother preach this
[56:02] is a good thought Pharaoh drowned babies
[56:06] and killed babies
[56:08] in the days of Moses
[56:10] later his son was killed and his army
[56:13] was drowned
[56:17] whatever he
[56:18] sowed that's what he reached
[56:21] now it's not an absolute so hang on
[56:25] because the the the scripture that says
[56:27] why sometimes it is sometimes it's
[56:29] you'll see the reaping and sowing
[56:30] sometimes you don't
[56:32] but God sees all of it
[56:34] and God's got a God's got a sowing I'm
[56:36] sorry God's got a reaping for all
[56:38] actions we just read it but some of them
[56:40] you don't we don't see all the time
[56:43] Saul spared and a malachite King
[56:46] remember God told him kill the Malachi
[56:47] King
[56:50] he didn't kill the amalkite and then in
[56:53] a malachite killed Saul
[56:57] he was supposed to kill the Malachi he
[56:58] didn't a malachite killed him
[57:01] he reaped what he sowed
[57:03] right
[57:04] Dave we know this one David sinned
[57:07] and murdered secretly later his wives
[57:10] were publicly shamed
[57:12] he's putting a nice way
[57:14] and then some of his family members were
[57:15] murdered
[57:17] publicly
[57:19] right
[57:20] you reap what you sow
[57:23] right
[57:25] now I'm going with negatives first
[57:28] but you know there's positives too
[57:30] Hallelujah
[57:33] the Philistines bragged about Goliath
[57:36] being a warrior and he boasted for 40
[57:38] days
[57:39] he boasted I'm the greatest man where's
[57:42] the man that can fight me for 40 days he
[57:44] boasted
[57:45] but later he was humbled
[57:48] right
[57:50] right Pride goes before the fall right
[57:54] see
[57:55] and he fell and he was humbled he fell
[57:58] to a small tiny teenager
[58:02] and then he was killed by his own sword
[58:05] that he was trusting him
[58:07] right
[58:08] he reap what he sowed brag brag brag I'm
[58:11] so great I'm so great and then he says
[58:13] he was shown by God you're little you're
[58:15] nothing
[58:16] a little teenage ready boy can defeat
[58:19] you with one stone
[58:21] and your Warrior training don't mean
[58:22] nothing
[58:24] the training you need is God's training
[58:25] praise God right amen
[58:28] Eli didn't restrain his sons in the
[58:31] priesthood
[58:33] so later his sons were killed the ark
[58:36] was taken and the priesthood was taken
[58:38] from him
[58:39] he reap what he sowed
[58:41] because he rejected the presence of God
[58:43] to correct his sons the presence of God
[58:45] left Israel
[58:47] right
[58:50] you all know this one we saw this one
[58:51] live Haman had Gallows built for
[58:54] Mordecai
[58:56] but later he was hung on the Gallows
[58:58] himself the very Gallows he built
[59:01] is that right
[59:04] how many times remember we saw in 2008
[59:07] with the stock market crash and
[59:08] everything
[59:10] these a lot of these Bankers did Ponzi
[59:13] schemes to get rich and now then they
[59:16] were poor right
[59:19] they uh they planted easy money right
[59:22] quick money they planted deception but
[59:24] then they were found out and some of
[59:25] them committed suicide some of them I
[59:27] think one of them was even murdered in
[59:28] prison
[59:30] they reaped what they sowed
[59:33] right
[59:34] same thing we see here
[59:37] get your Bibles here let's go to
[59:38] Revelation here Book of Revelation 16.
[59:40] go to Revelation 16 4.
[59:43] I heard a preacher preach this was
[59:44] pretty good
[59:47] now Revelation 16 4. now in the
[59:50] tribulation
[59:51] masses of people are killed because I'm
[59:55] sorry the masses kill people because
[59:57] they won't take the mark of the beast
[59:59] how many know that
[1:00:00] you can't buy or sell without the mark
[1:00:02] of the beast
[1:00:04] so large groups of people are
[1:00:07] bloodthirsty
[1:00:09] right and they kill anyone who take
[1:00:11] won't take the mark of the beast look at
[1:00:12] the third vial and the angel poured out
[1:00:14] his vow upon the rivers third Angel and
[1:00:17] The Fountains of waters and they became
[1:00:18] blood
[1:00:20] and I heard the angel of the water say
[1:00:22] thou art righteous O Lord which art and
[1:00:23] was and shall be because thou has judged
[1:00:26] thus
[1:00:28] the people that murdered all the people
[1:00:30] that wouldn't take the mark of the beast
[1:00:31] or Christians
[1:00:35] for look what have they done they've
[1:00:36] shed the blood of saints and Prophets
[1:00:39] and now it's given them blood to drink
[1:00:41] for they are worthy
[1:00:44] now look they sought blood
[1:00:48] and they reaped
[1:00:50] they reap blood
[1:00:52] right they were blood thirsty so they
[1:00:54] were made to drink blood
[1:00:56] because all the rivers turn to blood
[1:00:58] imagine when that happens maybe they'll
[1:01:00] they'll turn on the sinks and get some
[1:01:02] water the water found blood will come
[1:01:04] out
[1:01:06] right they're reaping what they showed
[1:01:10] they were bloodthirsty so the Bible said
[1:01:12] God's going to give them blood to drink
[1:01:18] look at verse seven and I heard another
[1:01:19] out of the altar say even so Lord God
[1:01:21] Almighty this is what the angels are
[1:01:23] saying in heaven true and righteous are
[1:01:25] thy judgments
[1:01:26] this is God's righteousness
[1:01:30] see all these people that are murderers
[1:01:32] and and are calling for uh the death of
[1:01:35] Christians and all these things the
[1:01:36] death of God the death of the Bible if
[1:01:38] they don't repent they will reap exactly
[1:01:40] what they showed
[1:01:42] they will suffer they will pay for that
[1:01:44] haters of God they will absolutely get
[1:01:47] what if if all they did was just was
[1:01:50] blasting them against God God will speak
[1:01:52] awful things against them
[1:01:54] it's exactly right because these people
[1:01:56] are bloodthirsty and they're made to
[1:01:58] drink blood and anyone who drinks blood
[1:02:00] is an abomination in the sight of God
[1:02:03] right
[1:02:07] their Waters were and church and these
[1:02:09] people they went and killed all these
[1:02:12] people right they murdered all these
[1:02:13] people who didn't take the mark of the
[1:02:14] beast and then they'll try to die but
[1:02:17] they won't be able to die
[1:02:20] right the Bible said they'll try to go
[1:02:21] into caves the mouth and say follow us
[1:02:23] and they'll be unable to even commit
[1:02:25] suicide
[1:02:29] see they tormented others so they've got
[1:02:31] to be tormented
[1:02:33] oh my like brother man says you don't
[1:02:35] want to be here during the tribulation
[1:02:37] let's get the Holy Ghost praise God Amen
[1:02:39] Hallelujah let's make sure we're born
[1:02:41] again let's be ready to go praise God
[1:02:43] hallelujah amen
[1:02:46] the Bible said they drink blood because
[1:02:48] they shed blood
[1:02:50] they reap what they sow
[1:02:52] my goodness
[1:02:56] now here's the key to it first Timothy 5
[1:02:58] I'm almost at my 10 minutes here yeah
[1:02:59] about eight minutes First Timothy 5 24
[1:03:01] some men's sins are open beforehand
[1:03:04] going before the judgment and some men
[1:03:06] they follow after
[1:03:09] like when Elvis died we saw all his sins
[1:03:11] right he died at 42 I'm 42 Elvis died at
[1:03:14] 42. I couldn't believe that I heard that
[1:03:15] the other day I'm like what
[1:03:17] and he looked awful
[1:03:19] look what look what look what he sowed
[1:03:22] yeah look what he reaped
[1:03:25] oh my goodness
[1:03:27] so see some men's will some men sins
[1:03:29] that women says we'll see them before
[1:03:31] they pass away others we won't
[1:03:34] but don't be discouraged verse 25
[1:03:37] likewise also the good works of some are
[1:03:40] manifest beforehand praise God and they
[1:03:43] that are otherwise cannot be hit
[1:03:45] so it's the same
[1:03:46] with evildoers sometimes you see their
[1:03:48] good work or their evil works sometimes
[1:03:50] you don't so it is with Believers
[1:03:52] sometimes you see their good works
[1:03:53] sometimes you don't what encouragement
[1:03:55] church if God has made us little and
[1:03:57] nobody sees our life we shouldn't be
[1:03:59] discouraged God sees it hallelujah amen
[1:04:02] God's keeping track amen hallelujah God
[1:04:05] watches over his children praise God and
[1:04:07] there will be a day of reaping praise
[1:04:09] God the main thing is keep planting amen
[1:04:12] keep sowing and God will give you a day
[1:04:14] of harvest praise God
[1:04:16] amen what a promise
[1:04:20] some men sins are known now some are
[1:04:22] later some people's good works some
[1:04:25] people are like I think about that some
[1:04:26] people are like the city on a hill that
[1:04:28] can't be hidden Jesus said no they'll
[1:04:30] see your good works and they'll glorify
[1:04:32] the Father in heaven but that's not true
[1:04:34] for everybody
[1:04:36] you might be the person not everybody
[1:04:37] sees your good works but God sees your
[1:04:39] good works
[1:04:41] God chose some people to be like a city
[1:04:43] on a hill and people see it my
[1:04:45] Hallelujah
[1:04:47] thank God for those people but God still
[1:04:50] sees all the Unseen people
[1:04:53] you can never be unseen if you're a
[1:04:55] child of God because his eyes run to and
[1:04:57] fro upon the whole earth he's just
[1:04:59] looking for somebody that's doing good
[1:05:01] works amen he's looking for somebody
[1:05:02] that's patient and continually does good
[1:05:05] that's seeking immortality and eternal
[1:05:08] life in other words he's looking for you
[1:05:09] to come to Heaven praise God
[1:05:11] amen
[1:05:15] church we reap what we sow hallelujah
[1:05:17] how many believe that
[1:05:20] I love one thing about brother rounds
[1:05:22] beyond the curtain of time
[1:05:24] the the millions run up to him and they
[1:05:26] say our precious brother there's my 10
[1:05:27] minutes they're precious brother
[1:05:28] precious brother and they said if you
[1:05:31] hadn't have went we would not have been
[1:05:33] here
[1:05:35] in other words brother Ram we are the
[1:05:37] fruits of all your labors
[1:05:39] now did he suffer yes his marriage
[1:05:41] suffered right his marriage suffered
[1:05:44] like I read those scriptures I read
[1:05:46] those quotes a few months ago
[1:05:48] right brother I said I love you Mita she
[1:05:50] said I don't think you do brother
[1:05:54] right
[1:05:57] but it's it's a it's a struggle that
[1:05:59] that couple had to deal with not every
[1:06:01] couple has to deal with that
[1:06:03] right
[1:06:04] but when he gets on the other side
[1:06:06] he sees all the sermons think of all
[1:06:08] those we have one thousand one hundred
[1:06:11] was it 83 sermons on tape
[1:06:13] and a lot of them are different churches
[1:06:15] all around the world in the nation
[1:06:17] each one of those is a seed planted
[1:06:20] each one is a seed and each one brother
[1:06:22] Ray there was probably an author call
[1:06:24] made and people gave their heart to the
[1:06:26] Lord
[1:06:28] and so when road ram goes beyond the
[1:06:29] current of time he sees millions of
[1:06:31] people running to him our precious
[1:06:32] brother our precious brother
[1:06:34] Hallelujah if you had not away I
[1:06:37] wouldn't be here and church the same is
[1:06:39] going to be said to you praise God
[1:06:41] because brother Ram could not have went
[1:06:42] unless his mom had the baby and reared
[1:06:44] him up and trained him right each one of
[1:06:47] us
[1:06:48] each one of us had to go each one of us
[1:06:51] were led by God each one of us were
[1:06:53] predestinated to do what God's called us
[1:06:55] to do and people run to us and say God
[1:06:57] bless you my precious sister God bless
[1:07:00] you my precious brother and we ought to
[1:07:02] be living like that we ought to be
[1:07:03] living because there's a reward
[1:07:05] Hallelujah beyond the curtain of time
[1:07:07] for each one of us praise God all these
[1:07:09] seeds God is going to bring them to
[1:07:11] fruition and we'll have a harvest Day
[1:07:13] praise God
[1:07:15] amen
[1:07:17] bye
[1:07:19] go to Revelation 14 4. I think it was my
[1:07:22] last verse
[1:07:24] yeah I'll make this my last verse here
[1:07:27] Hallelujah
[1:07:28] my goodness
[1:07:32] now I'm not going to read the one in
[1:07:33] Isaiah 53 the Bible said Jesus would die
[1:07:36] as a suffering servant and then the
[1:07:38] Bible said that he would see his seed
[1:07:41] right and who's that that's the Gentile
[1:07:43] Church
[1:07:45] after his resurrection he sent the holy
[1:07:47] ghost in the day of Pentecost and he'd
[1:07:48] see his seed he'd see the Church of God
[1:07:52] but there's also another group
[1:07:54] Hallelujah
[1:07:56] there's also a reaping that Jesus gets
[1:07:59] right there in the middle of the
[1:08:00] tribulation period or right after the
[1:08:02] middle of it
[1:08:03] it's the 144 000 Jews
[1:08:06] look what the Bible calls him now think
[1:08:08] about this they're blinded to Jesus for
[1:08:10] all these years
[1:08:11] and church right now they're getting
[1:08:12] ready right they're still getting ready
[1:08:14] and I mean they think the temple might
[1:08:16] come anytime
[1:08:19] did you see that again they got all
[1:08:20] those red heifers I think they have five
[1:08:22] red heifers right they got five red
[1:08:24] heifers not even one white hair on them
[1:08:28] they got to have that if they're going
[1:08:29] to have the temple worship and animal
[1:08:31] sacrifice
[1:08:32] I don't know if it's going to be in our
[1:08:34] lifetime I mean I believe it is but if
[1:08:35] not
[1:08:37] but they're getting ready the thing is
[1:08:39] they're living true to the word of God
[1:08:40] Hallelujah by patient continuance
[1:08:43] they're keeping the law of Moses I
[1:08:44] always do that sorry they're keeping the
[1:08:46] law of Moses they're going to the law
[1:08:48] they're going uh to the letter of the
[1:08:50] word of God obey obey well doing well
[1:08:53] doing well doing someday there's going
[1:08:55] to be a harvest someday and they're
[1:08:56] going to be a harvest praise God and
[1:08:57] when Jesus comes back he's going to show
[1:08:59] himself right and they're going to say
[1:09:01] you've got wounds in your hands where'd
[1:09:03] you get these wounds they'll say he says
[1:09:05] I got him in the house of my friends
[1:09:07] and then they'll weep from house to
[1:09:09] house but some boy they'll come to Jesus
[1:09:11] and they'll say you are a messiah you're
[1:09:13] the one we waited for you're the one
[1:09:15] we've longed for and the Bible said a
[1:09:18] fountain is open in the House of David
[1:09:20] praise God a Fountain Springs forth of
[1:09:23] repentance and rejoicing and the and the
[1:09:26] uh the the the blinders are taken off
[1:09:29] and now they can see this is our Messiah
[1:09:31] and they start praising God glorifying
[1:09:34] God and the Bible says when they're born
[1:09:36] again they're redeemed from among men
[1:09:38] they are the firstfruits unto God and to
[1:09:42] the lamb praise God
[1:09:43] oh Hallelujah Jesus
[1:09:46] preaching in these 144 000 being saved
[1:09:49] this is the reaping after all the sowing
[1:09:51] of the word of God even the sowing of
[1:09:53] the two prophets Hallelujah Moses and
[1:09:55] Elijah planted all those seeds of
[1:09:57] preaching and now here's the results and
[1:10:00] church the results are the greatest
[1:10:02] results there could ever be it's Souls
[1:10:05] because nothing is more valuable than a
[1:10:08] soul praise God
[1:10:09] Hallelujah
[1:10:13] church as far as Heaven you know we
[1:10:16] don't care how many you know what kind
[1:10:17] of rewards I don't care about the
[1:10:18] Mansions or streets of gold the main
[1:10:20] reward we want is to see Souls there
[1:10:22] praise God
[1:10:24] because he that's wise win his Souls
[1:10:28] let's stand to our feet praise God
[1:10:29] musicians can come
[1:10:32] Hallelujah I could have went through
[1:10:33] other examples of reaping and so on but
[1:10:35] I just want to end with Jesus I'm
[1:10:36] already almost at nine o'clock by God's
[1:10:38] grace
[1:10:41] Hallelujah
[1:10:42] the two prophets plant all these seeds
[1:10:45] of the word of God the same message that
[1:10:47] we believe praise God for three and a
[1:10:49] half years
[1:10:50] and then when Jesus comes
[1:10:52] he reaps the Harvest the first fruits of
[1:10:55] the earth and 144 000 received the
[1:10:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:00] Hallelujah that's that's quite a reaping
[1:11:02] how many would say Amen to that
[1:11:04] 144 000 born again in one day
[1:11:07] we had that Revival service at Napoleon
[1:11:09] what six or seven people got the Holy
[1:11:10] Ghost what a time of that was well
[1:11:12] imagine 144 000 of them get in the Holy
[1:11:15] Ghost what's that going to look like
[1:11:17] Hallelujah

[1:11:21] there's gonna be some shout and there's
[1:11:22] gonna be some Screaming there's gonna be
[1:11:24] some rejoicing there's gonna be some
[1:11:25] weeping there's gonna be some dance and
[1:11:27] praise God
[1:11:28] think about that 144
[1:11:31] 000.
[1:11:33] and each one of those is a fruit
[1:11:36] unto the ministry of the two Prophets
[1:11:38] hallelujah it's all for the glory of God
[1:11:41] let's buy our heads here by God's grace

[1:12:32] reaping what they sow
[1:12:36] they planted all those bad seeds and so
[1:12:38] they got
[1:12:40] same scenes back
