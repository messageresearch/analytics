[18:21] forever be praised God what a blessing
[18:24] let's take a few testimony to have a few
[18:26] testimonies tonight by God's grace oh
[18:27] we're happy about that make sure I don't
[18:31] miss anything here my wife has a little
[18:36] testimony she said this morning
[18:39] Genevieve scratched her eye area with a
[18:41] small wire brush she cried for a long
[18:45] time and wouldn't open her eyes so I
[18:48] took her to the eye doctor to see if
[18:49] there was damage praise God
[18:50] her eyes were fine whether God protected
[18:53] them from being scratched or healed them
[18:55] before we got to doctor we're so
[18:57] thankful she's not hurt praise the Lord
[19:18] you share here a little testimony the
[19:22] sister from cams church had cancer on
[19:24] her leg like from her knee down her shin
[19:27] and she did five chemo treatments and it
[19:31] was basically all gone except for a
[19:33] little spot and and then they wonder do
[19:37] more chemo and she said no I'm done with
[19:38] that and so but the doctors said the
[19:44] chemo didn't actually take away the
[19:46] cancer so they said you need to do these
[19:49] four more treatments and so they the
[19:53] doctors didn't know what took it away
[19:54] but cam and the church believe it was
[19:56] prayer by God's grace and then because
[19:59] of the cancer her dimmed and she said
[20:05] she like shadows kind on the outside of
[20:07] her sight all the time but we prayed for
[20:08] her on we actually prayed for her son on
[20:10] Sunday morning and she said after he
[20:12] prayed for her son she opened her eyes
[20:13] and her eyes are completely well so I
[20:23] just thought that was a good testimony
[20:24] there by the grace of Lord
[20:26] also we prayed for a brother who hadn't
[20:28] had sleep really well for years and he
[20:31] said after we pray for him he went home
[20:32] that night and had the best sleep he's
[20:34] had in the number of years so thank the
[20:36] Lord for that that was a blessing praise
[20:38] God also now let's take a few prayer
[20:42] requests here so we're happy that that
[20:45] one that one cancer situation seemed to
[20:48] be God has been moving healing that
[20:50] person the other one another one though
[20:53] is kind of getting worse so that little

[20:59] her ask the Lord to move on her behalf
[21:03] so Karras put that requests in because

[37:27] following prayer to bless this church
[37:29] continually Lord brother Jesse and his
[37:32] family lost Church family and all those
[37:34] connected in the name of Jesus Christ we
[37:37] pray in church say men a man of you have
[37:42] your Bibles let's turn to the book of
[37:45] Judges judges 6 I believe our judges 6
[37:53] praise the Lord
[38:03] judges chapter 6 and to make the reading
[38:10] short let's just let's just started on
[38:13] verse 11 judges 6 and verse 11 the Bible
[38:25] says and there came an angel of the Lord
[38:28] and said under an oak which was in Ofra
[38:33] that pertained them to Joe as the abra
[38:37] Knight and his son Gideon threshed week
[38:41] by the winepress to hide it from the
[38:44] Midianites and the angel of the Lord
[38:46] appeared unto him and said unto Him the
[38:49] Lord is with thee thou mighty man of
[38:51] Valor and Gideon said unto Him o my lord
[38:55] if the Lord be with us
[38:58] why then is this befallen us and where
[39:04] be all his miracles which our Father
[39:07] told us of saying did not the Lord bring
[39:11] us up from Egypt but now the LORD hath
[39:14] forsaken us and deliver us into the
[39:17] hands of the Midianites let's go to 1st
[39:19] John chapter 5 first John chapter 5
[39:35] first John chapter 5 and let's read
[39:42] verse 13 this thing have I written unto
[39:49] you that believe on the name of the son
[39:52] of God that ye may know that ye have
[39:56] eternal life and that ye may believe on
[39:58] the name of the Son of God and this is
[40:01] the confidence that we have in him that
[40:05] if we ask anything according to his will
[40:08] he heareth us amen may Lord bless the
[40:13] reading of his word you can have your
[40:15] seats
[40:17] amen praise God today brother imp of the
[40:24] Lord I want to dig in a thought it may
[40:31] sound kind of strange but you know my
[40:34] thought tonight is the blessing of not
[40:37] knowing
[40:38] the blessing of not knowing now you know
[40:43] as I look in the Word of God you know
[40:45] and one thing I realize about God he
[40:50] loves to unveil himself dad loves to
[40:54] reveal himself to his people and you
[40:57] know so so that's kind of where my topic
[41:00] is coming from today that there areas in
[41:03] our life that we don't know God so God
[41:07] being God has to reveal himself in a
[41:10] certain way so he could be expressed
[41:13] because God's desire is for us to know
[41:17] him and to know him completely amen not
[41:21] just know a part of God but as his
[41:24] children as his seed he wants us to know
[41:26] him in fullness that's why God unveiled
[41:30] himself from generation to generation
[41:32] from church age to Church change because
[41:35] the first church age didn't know all
[41:38] about God so God kept unveiling himself
[41:41] so he had to keep creation going amen
[41:45] because God and he wanted to be known
[41:48] amen he wanted to know he wanted his
[41:51] creation to know all of his expressions
[41:53] but for us it's such a blessing when God
[41:58] reveals himself because what happens
[42:01] when God reveals himself in a certain
[42:03] way it produces the confidence to us hey
[42:07] man you know I think about when God
[42:09] filled himself to me as a healer that
[42:12] puts such a smile on my face you know
[42:15] and it produced a confidence in that
[42:19] area of my life then nobody could take
[42:21] away heylia so you know just like the
[42:24] scripture says it says you know and this
[42:28] is the confidence that we have in him
[42:30] then we ask anything according to his
[42:32] will he hears us now when it comes to
[42:36] healing we should have a confidence
[42:38] because I believe healing is his will
[42:41] hallelujah so when we go to God we go to
[42:44] God not knowing but we go in that
[42:47] breathy hallelujah that God is able to
[42:50] reveal
[42:51] you know when I when I look at this
[42:53] where he were Gillian you know and we
[42:57] look at how God does things you know
[42:59] Church it's mind-blowing that we read
[43:03] the Bible we look really closely we see
[43:06] God is a God of patterns oh yeah he's a
[43:11] God of patterns the Bible says he says
[43:13] I'm the Lord and I changed now if you
[43:18] read through the scripture you can see
[43:20] that he constantly kind of their sleeves
[43:23] the same way and he calls people and
[43:26] they do things the same way you know and
[43:29] as I look at her and I thought about you
[43:32] know just stop the blessing of not
[43:33] knowing you know Abraham he didn't know
[43:37] God but yet it was a blessing because
[43:41] when God calls him God was going to
[43:44] reveal himself in such a way that it
[43:47] would erase all Abraham's doubts oh yeah
[43:51] so if we can say that I want you to
[43:54] examine your life and just maybe you
[43:57] know go into the depths of who you are
[44:02] baby
[44:03] well but God is obligated God is
[44:08] obligated to reveal himself so you ought
[44:11] to not necessarily challenge God but but
[44:15] prove you're a man say say Lord you know
[44:17] you stand neither of wholesale financial
[44:21] situation God has to prove himself as
[44:24] being a provider or we should know they
[44:27] will call him Jehovah Jireh hell yeah so
[44:31] therefore it's a blessing to you to not
[44:33] know because God has to prove him hire
[44:37] you you know hi you know I look at this
[44:40] way Gideon this was a strenuous time you
[44:45] know in the land and you know the media
[44:47] nights they were putting pressure on
[44:49] them you know but you look at God God
[44:53] comes to us in times of fear you know
[44:58] and we are afraid
[45:02] it's a cure if you cannot take the word
[45:04] confidence confidence is the complete
[45:07] opposite of being secure you know but
[45:10] confidence comes when God hire you
[45:13] totally annihilate your fears and you
[45:17] look what he came cagillion he came in a
[45:20] time when he was most afraid hey he's
[45:25] back there hiding behind a request
[45:27] because of the Midianites and in the
[45:29] moment when he's hiding and sharing some
[45:33] his life he's sharing from his moment
[45:35] God comes in and God calls him a mighty
[45:39] man of Valor through the visitation of
[45:42] angels oh my what a mighty God he also
[45:49] in that blessing of not doing God and
[45:52] that mighty deliverer not knowing God
[45:55] you know of one who can come in and
[45:58] change the whole situation just like
[46:00] that it was a blessing and not knowing
[46:02] because God had to show Gideon how great
[46:05] he is so you get the stages God took
[46:08] just to show just to bill Gideon's
[46:11] confidence because guinea was like if
[46:14] the Lord is with us then why I always
[46:17] been following us you know we asked that
[46:18] question a lot sometimes you know we ask
[46:22] God say Lord if I got the Holy Ghost so
[46:25] I'm trying to serve you and you doing
[46:28] Lord you know why's my life go like this
[46:31] you know God is a confidence booster so
[46:39] you have to have areas in your life that
[46:41] you kind of feel kind of weak or you may
[46:44] feel kind of insecure because you didn't
[46:48] have moments like that there'll be no
[46:50] need for mighty God so God allows us to
[46:54] go through fears and insecurities that
[46:57] all these things so he could show his
[46:59] greatness in your life where he can
[47:02] build a company where in that moment in
[47:06] that place of time you can look back and
[47:08] you can see man in that moment when I
[47:11] was afraid when I was insecure
[47:14] when I was worried well I didn't know
[47:15] what was gonna happen God came in and
[47:18] gave me a confidence oh yeah
[47:21] showers breast not to know God so by
[47:24] knowing God by not knowing God trying to
[47:27] make sure that I knew him whom I just
[47:35] loved the god of simplicity cuz you know
[47:37] in one place apostle of God he said Amen
[47:40] you you you you you you solve the
[47:43] equation by the problem or you take the
[47:46] you take you take the solution and the
[47:49] problem and put it together and you get
[47:50] your answer you know but when it comes
[47:52] to you rejecting us up as a teacher to
[47:57] check your work you have to take the
[48:00] answer and process a portion and get the
[48:02] beginning and all that stuff so just we
[48:05] have to be able to see God in the midst
[48:07] of doing something you know churching as
[48:10] I look at Gideon Gideon
[48:12] he he he wasn't confident in the calling
[48:17] of God but God wanted to make him sure
[48:21] so what God did go ahead I want you to
[48:24] go down tear down the grows everything
[48:26] I'll be with you
[48:27] he was like Lord I don't know my dad and
[48:30] God I need a son eyes me I need I need a
[48:34] sign it he took the sweet sweet on the
[48:36] story of the fleece you know and he said
[48:38] I out and one was place he said I need
[48:41] the fleece to be driving the ground
[48:43] where God did that that should have been
[48:45] enough to build his confidence but you
[48:47] know what you know what church God knows
[48:50] how much it will take and God is willing
[48:53] to go the extra mile to make sure we
[48:57] know him and you look what God did God
[49:01] didn't just stop earlier he didn't just
[49:04] see in that moment where he made the
[49:07] speech dry in the ground way God proves
[49:10] who he was he was he proved that what he
[49:16] said again I'm agree with you he proved
[49:18] it he didn't have to do anything else
[49:21] but just to make sure we are confident
[49:25] just to make sure
[49:27] haria we are confident in him he'll go
[49:30] the extra mile to prove his will that's
[49:34] why he says this is the confidence we
[49:36] have that when we ask anything
[49:38] hallelujah we have got anything
[49:40] according to his will
[49:41] we'll have what we ask for now God
[49:44] didn't have to come and make ground dry
[49:47] in the fresh wet but he did that because
[49:50] it was his will to show Gideon how great
[49:54] he was and not just when I say how great
[49:58] he was not just God being great but his
[50:02] greatness being revealed and Gideon so
[50:05] that's why higher your God produced his
[50:07] confidence he said and this is the
[50:09] confidence that we have in him hurry
[50:12] that if we ask anything according to his
[50:14] will so you know God made the fish drive
[50:18] hurry up and the ground wet and Gideon
[50:21] comes back and Jesus says make the
[50:23] ground dry and the free sweat why did
[50:25] God fulfill that second desire because
[50:28] it was his real hallelujah
[50:31] it was as real to show Gideon that you
[50:35] are mighty man of Valor and I'm sending
[50:37] you to come against hurry these ungodly
[50:40] God's earlier so god he he fulfills what
[50:46] we ask when it's according to the will
[50:49] of God huh so church as we see Gideon
[50:54] girls and heshes obedient to God he he
[50:57] turns down the girls but he does that
[51:00] still with an element of fear after all
[51:04] God did he still has an element of fear
[51:07] why where does that fear coming from not
[51:10] knowing the blessing of not knowing
[51:14] cuz not knowing and not being able to
[51:17] trust in God and God who's a person who
[51:23] Leah oh my just think about this God
[51:25] will use us when we don't even trust him
[51:32] he's getting and getting didn't even
[51:36] trust God oh my he didn't believe that
[51:39] regard
[51:40] said he was gonna do he's gonna do it
[51:42] earlier but God still use the man even
[51:45] though he was doubting him huh
[51:48] gosh did you Sarah even though she was
[51:51] doubting him huh - did you ever ham even
[51:55] though she was doubting him God use
[51:58] Moses even though he was dumping his
[52:01] vulnerability the blessing of that
[52:07] knowing huh because when we feel like we
[52:10] don't know what God's gonna do God or
[52:12] come to show himself and to prove to us
[52:16] who eat her Leah she turns the mall oh
[52:21] my and Burgess I feel my hippo coming on
[52:25] honey
[52:26] the more I feel I find myself in trials
[52:30] the more I realized I'm not the one
[52:33] really being tried catch me earlier if I
[52:40] say I'm a child of God
[52:41] it's I say I'm a believer so who's the
[52:45] one on trial my god oh yeah because I go
[52:49] around testifying you know like I said
[52:51] it was healing my God is a healer I'm
[52:54] not a child anymore my Guardians I go
[52:57] around and say my God is a provider
[52:59] hurry up
[53:00] I'm not the one on child as being the
[53:03] provider my god is so if I don't know
[53:06] how God has to come and fulfill that to
[53:11] me God has to come and unveil the
[53:15] mystery of Leah's to me so I can rock
[53:18] this journey in confidence
[53:21] hallelujah so what we have to do we have
[53:27] to look at our life our child's our
[53:29] tribulations as a blessing because this
[53:32] is how it happens Church in the Old
[53:34] Testament the worship well let's just
[53:37] say you and I the rush book will come
[53:39] and we offer a sacrifice and we bring
[53:42] the sacrifice to the priest for all
[53:45] seems to be forgiven and this priest had
[53:47] to offer the sacrifice for the
[53:49] forgiveness of our sins but what
[53:51] happened to the worshiper
[53:52] he tell the worshiper
[53:54] you go ahead this right here is all
[53:56] about your sacrifice hurry up I want to
[53:59] make sure your sacrifice is worthy of
[54:02] bringing it before God that your sins
[54:05] may be forgiven huh
[54:06] now Jesus Christ is our sacrifice
[54:09] earlier so in anything we do hire you if
[54:12] God proclaims himself to be the
[54:15] perpetuation are to claim himself to be
[54:18] the supreme sacrifice that means hurry
[54:21] wherever we stand in need of he is the
[54:24] supreme meat he is the supreme answer
[54:28] for honey hey man y'all so we will get
[54:32] Gideon and Gideon you know God didn't
[54:35] stop God wanted to increase his right
[54:39] reputable I would say I'm kind of I'm
[54:42] kind of leery about saying increased his
[54:45] faith because I believe the faith we
[54:51] need for every situation is already in
[54:54] us so I don't like to say increase your
[55:00] faith I like to say release your faith
[55:02] huh Leah because wondering about God
[55:04] when God created you hug he didn't have
[55:07] to come back and add stuff to you
[55:10] everything you need is already in you
[55:12] can you imagine God creating me or
[55:14] creating you with no eyes and he said oh
[55:17] I forgot let me put some eyes in you're
[55:22] dealing with somebody when that happens
[55:25] you're dealing with a creator that
[55:27] doesn't know what he's doing or he's
[55:29] going to trial and error that means that
[55:33] the Creator halia has a level of fault
[55:36] in him see see and that's the prime
[55:41] example Harlan
[55:42] why God created a man to be a man and a
[55:45] woman to be a woman because God is not a
[55:48] creator by default that's who he is
[55:51] huh he doesn't make mistakes so can you
[55:53] imagine the LBJ cutie community how he
[55:57] said you know they say well I was born
[55:59] this way I'm rich man trapped in a
[56:03] woman's body no that'll be saying God
[56:05] didn't know what he was doing
[56:08] that gotta be saying that he's not
[56:10] perfect
[56:11] that'll be saying that he's not
[56:13] omnipotent or omniscient oh yeah
[56:16] he's not all-knowing all ooh yeah now
[56:18] how can you be God and not know what
[56:21] you're doing oh yeah to be God
[56:26] you and your subjects cannot be on the
[56:29] same level
[56:32] just Jesus have to have something to
[56:36] look up to know the Bible says that we
[56:39] are as in joint heirs of Christ but
[56:42] that's on this side cuz we have to hurry
[56:45] we on this side we have to look up God
[56:48] so that in --see we are joint heirs
[56:52] see it's like climbing in July oh yeah
[56:55] but just see God is building our company
[56:59] and you know you know when I think about
[57:03] you know what they say about you know
[57:05] God is the God of love and all these
[57:07] things you know and and you know like I
[57:11] said I'm on this animal I'm a woman in a
[57:13] man's body walk man in a woman's body
[57:15] and they say you know I was born like
[57:18] just no no demons have perverted your
[57:22] mind honey
[57:24] amen and what they've done they've come
[57:27] to take away your confidence and that's
[57:31] what he does to a person that's in that
[57:33] condition that man is no longer
[57:35] confident being a man honey so he wants
[57:38] to be a woman because of things that
[57:39] have befallen his life and his vice
[57:42] versa with the woman the woman is no
[57:44] longer confident being a woman she tries
[57:47] to be a man because what you're trying
[57:49] to do build her confidence but God
[57:57] building our confidence is about us
[58:00] knowing who we are
[58:04] oh yeah so as he reveals of himself he's
[58:08] really showing us who we are
[58:11] hariya so as God look at how he did it
[58:15] all throughout the Bible you know in
[58:18] times of fear and times of turmoil and
[58:23] peril
[58:23] you know God came in he done things that
[58:27] you can only imagine you know like I
[58:29] said he called Moses and Moses were like
[58:32] no I can't talk
[58:34] and God says who made your mouth hey you
[58:40] know Moses comes with skills that you
[58:42] and God see see bad is like God is like
[58:46] a an operating room you know that well
[58:50] he wants you to die from yourself he
[58:53] just flat lies huh he does it in such a
[58:57] way where you can't even say nothing
[58:59] else huh and that's what I did in Moses
[59:02] Moses came excuse an excuse an excuse
[59:05] and then God told Moses hey you be God
[59:08] and it Aaron be a prophet now what is is
[59:13] he gonna say after God tells him you be
[59:16] God see God came with the ultimate
[59:21] confidence placing in Moses he see Moses
[59:26] said I came talking I can't be delivered
[59:28] and I can't be this and I can't do this
[59:30] it people hear me and who gonna say
[59:33] should I come and then God God just
[59:35] flies the whole situation and God says
[59:37] hey I won't say how would you remote
[59:48] touch he does the same thing to us when
[59:51] we get in situations you know God tells
[59:53] us why cross back to situation he lies
[59:59] the whole situation he wants us to die
[1:00:02] to what we know and believe in him honey
[1:00:07] you know but Jesse that's the place I'm
[1:00:09] getting I'm getting to by God's grace
[1:00:11] that I'm looking at situations of my
[1:00:13] life and different situations well I'm
[1:00:16] just taking a step back
[1:00:17] hey I got the proof nothing this is all
[1:00:22] you got
[1:00:23] this is all about you I walk around I be
[1:00:26] clean I got the greatest guard ever this
[1:00:30] is a real I walk around up a clean my
[1:00:33] god is a provider this is on him oh yeah
[1:00:37] so when God does these things Malachi it
[1:00:40] should produce a confidence so when
[1:00:44] these situations arise we don't step
[1:00:47] into it that we're not knowing no we
[1:00:50] were already blessed in that area of not
[1:00:52] knowing now we have confidence look look
[1:01:01] what God does he uses God uses people at
[1:01:09] the time I believe at the time when God
[1:01:12] called most of the men in the scriptures
[1:01:15] didn't really know who they were they
[1:01:18] didn't have the confidence to walk as
[1:01:20] prophets and you know what mighty men of
[1:01:23] valor and you know as kings and all
[1:01:25] these things know God had to develop
[1:01:27] that in him it was a growth process man
[1:01:31] it's like it's like it's like uh uh uh
[1:01:33] Michael Jordan didn't you know when he
[1:01:37] was in college
[1:01:38] or let's just say high school he didn't
[1:01:40] believe he was the greatest he's gonna
[1:01:42] be the greatest player cuz he had trial
[1:01:45] and error
[1:01:46] he even got caught in his earlier days
[1:01:50] he got caught but as he began to hone in
[1:01:54] on his crash terrain as he began to grow
[1:01:58] into who he was
[1:02:00] [Music]
[1:02:02] get to some saddle what was that
[1:02:05] confidence I like I like to talk about
[1:02:10] this the game way where the Bulls played
[1:02:16] the Celtics in the playoffs in Jordan
[1:02:19] scored 63 against the bull of Larry Bird
[1:02:23] he scored 63 against that team and they
[1:02:27] interview Jordan they asked him they
[1:02:29] said what was going through your mind in
[1:02:31] that moment he said that I was
[1:02:33] unstoppable see he believed Harley even
[1:02:40] though he was in a room with four other
[1:02:43] guys on his team but he felt like he was
[1:02:46] the one that was unstoppable
[1:02:47] he won't worry about team oh yeah see he
[1:02:51] had such a confidence he had such a
[1:02:56] confidence in that moment I do he
[1:03:02] pretended to put the ball and what God
[1:03:04] is trying to do for us is produced such
[1:03:07] a confidence in us that we can walk with
[1:03:09] God he talked to God
[1:03:11] we have session with him that we could
[1:03:13] go to him in our time of need and asked
[1:03:16] what we will and God hears us that's
[1:03:23] what confidence does confidence when you
[1:03:25] go to God and prayer you're believing
[1:03:28] he's going to answer back
[1:03:32] that's why prayer should be a
[1:03:34] relationship holy you know but I'm gonna
[1:03:39] be too much longer but as I looking and
[1:03:41] I think about Gideon go I challenge you
[1:03:43] to go back and read after Gideon turn
[1:03:45] around the groves you know they said we
[1:03:48] don't kill him who did this we don't
[1:03:51] kill now he didn't know all that was
[1:03:54] gonna come after he did whatever God
[1:03:56] said but I want you to see something the
[1:03:59] blessing of not knowing God told him to
[1:04:01] do that but God didn't tell him what was
[1:04:03] gonna be the outcome so who has to
[1:04:05] handle everything after that if you do
[1:04:08] what God says
[1:04:11] coz if you do what God says the
[1:04:14] repercussions of you doing it he's not
[1:04:16] on you
[1:04:17] he's on God my prophet will come and he
[1:04:22] would say if God sends you he's
[1:04:24] obligated to take care other God called
[1:04:28] you to do called you to do anything
[1:04:32] he'll provide Holly on that other hand
[1:04:35] whatever he told you honey
[1:04:38] that's how God works he has to why
[1:04:46] because he's a confidence builder and
[1:04:51] you think about him being God this is
[1:04:54] one thing I believe here the Bible says
[1:04:57] you know that um
[1:04:59] John 3:16 hugging it they got saved the
[1:05:03] sins of the whole world he died for the
[1:05:06] whole world sins of the whole world you
[1:05:09] know but we know everybody's not gonna
[1:05:12] be saved
[1:05:13] so why would God die and illustrate it
[1:05:16] and he died for the sins of the world
[1:05:18] because nobody's gonna be able to say in
[1:05:21] that great day
[1:05:23] his blood was throwing up for me nobody
[1:05:28] is gonna be able to say that that's why
[1:05:31] God presented his life to the whole
[1:05:34] world that was up to us to accept it by
[1:05:37] faith surely see God did his fatherly he
[1:05:41] did his part now the rest all the other
[1:05:44] steps we have to make her knowing honey
[1:05:48] she we make a step towards healing God
[1:05:50] already took a nap ah he's just trying
[1:05:53] to produce confidence in you honey
[1:05:57] that's how he wants nobody would be able
[1:06:00] to stand there in in in the reeks of
[1:06:02] judgment in the reeks of having that
[1:06:04] great gain is they well you said you
[1:06:07] know you died for see the whole world
[1:06:09] but I'm not saved and gotta say simply
[1:06:11] because you didn't take home the
[1:06:13] sacrifice I gave you the price but you
[1:06:19] did not receive it huh I offered us
[1:06:23] supreme sacrifice
[1:06:24] Oh think about this church there gonna
[1:06:26] be people standing there and they're
[1:06:28] gonna be saying to God what about me and
[1:06:30] God's gonna say I'll put you a covering
[1:06:33] but you never took but you know I look
[1:06:44] at God look at how he chooses he he
[1:06:46] chooses heal heal heal you
[1:06:50] we know that according to God's
[1:06:53] foreknowledge predestination he already
[1:06:55] knows who's bride who's not Brad but we
[1:06:58] don't know the stages of our life so we
[1:07:02] go through battles and different things
[1:07:04] and God gives us more and more
[1:07:06] confidence look at God David didn't know
[1:07:09] he was gonna have to fight a lion he
[1:07:12] didn't know he was gonna have a bear
[1:07:14] fight a bear what was that
[1:07:15] those were confidence boosters cuz he
[1:07:18] was glad to get to Goliath so sometimes
[1:07:25] things will happen with us not knowing
[1:07:27] oh yeah David didn't know that he was
[1:07:31] gonna have to fight a lion or have to
[1:07:33] fight a bear but that was a blessing and
[1:07:35] not knowing because God was setting him
[1:07:37] up for greater hallelujah can you think
[1:07:42] about it I like to say this you know you
[1:07:44] throughout a relationship or maybe a
[1:07:46] relationship between husband and wife if
[1:07:48] you knew everything about that person
[1:07:50] the relationship would be very dull and
[1:07:52] boring because you'd be like you robots
[1:07:56] no okay
[1:07:58] I can't surprise him because I know
[1:08:03] he knows you imagine you come on one day
[1:08:07] to your spouse with some flowers like oh
[1:08:10] yeah and he's gonna do that already
[1:08:16] what kind of relationship is that see so
[1:08:19] it's a blessing and not knowing every
[1:08:22] step because you have the ability you
[1:08:25] you you you you have the makeup to be
[1:08:28] surprised huh
[1:08:32] and that's why God hurry constantly
[1:08:35] unveils himself to us because he wants
[1:08:37] to keep us in surprise mode
[1:08:40] hurry up cuz we're getting situations
[1:08:42] and you'd be like why me why this happen
[1:08:45] why does the next thing you know you
[1:08:46] turn around and God has some flowers in
[1:08:48] your face I wasn't expecting that but
[1:09:00] see that makes a relationship so good
[1:09:04] cuz you have x in there when it's
[1:09:07] spontaneous other times in there when
[1:09:11] you're not expecting certain things
[1:09:13] hurry
[1:09:14] and what does that do that puts a smile
[1:09:16] on your face and it also boosts your
[1:09:19] confidence oh yeah you know if you your
[1:09:25] your relationship you come home every
[1:09:27] day and you got the same meal every day
[1:09:33] every day rice and gravy fried chicken
[1:09:37] greens macaroni and Cornbury that's a
[1:09:44] supreme meal for me I mean what did I
[1:09:49] walk smiling tell me but if I come home
[1:09:54] to that every day it will be boring
[1:09:58] because there'll be no more element of
[1:10:00] surprise and you know what if that
[1:10:03] happens every day
[1:10:05] hurry I could no longer crazy I don't
[1:10:15] know to crave it or have a desire for it
[1:10:18] because it's always there it's always
[1:10:21] there I don't I don't have a chance to
[1:10:23] miss it failure and that's what God does
[1:10:28] to us hurry up he keeps us in ammo when
[1:10:30] we're hungry and thirsting for
[1:10:32] righteousness oh yeah we're craving and
[1:10:35] desiring more God what does that do that
[1:10:39] gives the relationship because it's a
[1:10:45] blessing and not knowing what you're
[1:10:47] walking into
[1:10:51] think about a church God told Abraham I
[1:10:55] want you going wrong and walk my faith
[1:10:57] Church walking my faith is the ultimate
[1:11:00] hallelujah way of getting God's
[1:11:03] attention
[1:11:03] he says Abraham I need you go down to
[1:11:06] the land you know whose buildings and
[1:11:08] makers that man we know the story
[1:11:10] and Abraham starts the walk Abraham
[1:11:12] leaves the place where he's supposed to
[1:11:14] go and I he's walking down he's looking
[1:11:16] at his wife he's like man girl you look
[1:11:19] good you say you know what the king
[1:11:22] gonna try to kill me he's thinking all
[1:11:24] of King gonna try to come try to kill me
[1:11:27] cuz you look good he say you know what
[1:11:30] hey the closer we get down here when we
[1:11:33] get down in this land was talking to a
[1:11:36] ram fear see he doesn't have the
[1:11:40] confidence yet in his God
[1:11:43] Church he's the father faith but in this
[1:11:48] moment where was his faith it was still
[1:11:52] locked up earlier but God still didn't
[1:11:55] take away God is a man I can use you
[1:11:57] I gotta give me another father thing no
[1:11:59] he knows he does we initially call God
[1:12:07] know what he's doing when he initially
[1:12:09] call you the child and tribulation does
[1:12:13] not change God's purpose in your life
[1:12:16] just like when Peter denied the Lord
[1:12:24] three times that did not change that he
[1:12:27] was a son of God he denied him three
[1:12:30] times
[1:12:31] not only the night but he's trying cost
[1:12:34] the last time oh yeah but you look
[1:12:36] before you got there God aren't over
[1:12:39] here gave him the keys to the taint of
[1:12:43] God to touch for we never realize God is
[1:12:48] more confident in you blessing you not
[1:12:59] knowing it keeps it keeps my
[1:13:08] relationship with God fresh huh because
[1:13:13] I'm walking right now by faith I don't
[1:13:16] know what are you gonna do honey but I
[1:13:18] believe oh yeah
[1:13:20] I got I got I got financial issues in
[1:13:23] Hong Kong other stuff but hurry God said
[1:13:27] he will be my provider oh yeah
[1:13:30] so look what he's gonna do I don't know
[1:13:32] how certain bills certain things gonna
[1:13:35] be paid but I know he's done it before
[1:13:37] huh
[1:13:39] so I have my confidence in waiting call
[1:13:41] yeah so as I wait earlier God is looking
[1:13:44] at me watching my behavior in my
[1:13:46] demeanor and everything and then God
[1:13:48] gets surprised you say man is blowing on
[1:13:50] doubt me let me go and drop that
[1:13:51] blessing
[1:13:55] here waited long enough okay now I got
[1:13:58] you honey
[1:14:01] she sees the confidence you have him
[1:14:04] you're not wavering honey it doesn't
[1:14:08] matter what you're freaking me saying
[1:14:09] other people say all these things
[1:14:11] the problem that God said earlier when
[1:14:13] God took jobs through his trial God
[1:14:16] wanted to see somebody hallelujah that
[1:14:19] was gonna stand in his favor no matter
[1:14:23] what the church people were saying no
[1:14:25] matter what they saw with the eyes God
[1:14:28] told somebody who he was confident about
[1:14:37] it God he don't put us in situations to
[1:14:43] fail he put us in situations to grow
[1:14:46] honey
[1:14:47] that night night we've all had failures
[1:14:50] you know why we fail because we didn't
[1:14:53] listen while we were going through it
[1:14:55] that's why we fail without just fail
[1:15:03] that's not God God don't put us in
[1:15:05] positions of failure he put us in
[1:15:07] positions of growth honey you know you
[1:15:10] know you don't put your child on the
[1:15:12] porch if they can't walk so they can
[1:15:14] fall around and bust a head no God no
[1:15:16] things like that is your child learning
[1:15:19] how to walk you put on a level ground
[1:15:20] huh
[1:15:22] true level ground in areas of where we
[1:15:25] wish where they can't get hurt oh but
[1:15:27] they'll fall down but you know they'll
[1:15:29] get back up again
[1:15:31] you're expecting them to fall but you
[1:15:33] know in that moment they'll get back
[1:15:35] company they won't be so damaged by the
[1:15:37] fall they just walk away from no get
[1:15:40] back up again and that's what God does
[1:15:42] God doesn't put us in positions where
[1:15:44] we're so distraught we were like oh I
[1:15:47] can't be a Christian no he puts us in
[1:15:49] position hurry he pushes in situation
[1:15:51] when things come out of us hurry when
[1:15:54] the confidence comes out when we even
[1:15:56] know we had and just just a prime
[1:16:00] example God chose Abraham
[1:16:02] goki the boy and I get to the moment a
[1:16:05] man a confidence comes out that
[1:16:07] I didn't tell him anything about he says
[1:16:09] I'm the lad gonna go and I let go turn
[1:16:11] where did that come from there is a
[1:16:17] blessing of not knowing he didn't know
[1:16:21] if you did he will say this child or
[1:16:23] kill his child he just had to walk by
[1:16:25] faith and in him not knowing God was
[1:16:29] already produces a confidence such a
[1:16:35] confidence was coming up in that moment
[1:16:37] and Abraham didn't even realize what he
[1:16:39] was doing he speaks to his situation god
[1:16:42] never told him go down there and i'ma
[1:16:44] stop the night no he said o killin see
[1:16:48] the blessing your not knowing holy not
[1:16:51] knowing that confidence is right there
[1:16:53] in God and now in that moment Abraham
[1:16:56] says either they're gonna go huh I don't
[1:16:58] like a return that was the first step
[1:17:00] that God has been working on it oh and
[1:17:05] now he's just down there Arlena
[1:17:07] everything is gathered
[1:17:08] you got the fire you got you got you got
[1:17:10] you got all to all these things and
[1:17:12] Isaac says that I see everything else
[1:17:15] whereas the sacrifice
[1:17:16] Abraham's confidence speaks out against
[1:17:19] God
[1:17:20] we provide himself the confidence in
[1:17:27] that moment holier may hurry up what he
[1:17:31] needed materialized is the same thing
[1:17:39] happened in our prophets journey honey
[1:17:41] they were walking and going to God told
[1:17:44] him then you know he'll kill a silver to
[1:17:46] the caribou and all this
[1:17:48] he killed the caribou had vision
[1:17:50] everything just net killed the caribou
[1:17:52] and walking back down the mouth he said
[1:17:54] they could see clearly down from where
[1:17:57] the campground was to where he was and
[1:18:00] as they details burned wasn't a boy I
[1:18:01] was wrong with him
[1:18:02] blowing now you said that years will get
[1:18:05] a simple tip grizzly by the time you get
[1:18:08] back down here he said I was Lord told
[1:18:12] me he's a yeast you show right you mean
[1:18:16] down into the bottom where that guy
[1:18:18] standing with the green check shadow
[1:18:21] huh he said yeah he they bars you down
[1:18:24] he said how you say you play so he said
[1:18:27] but I can see clear to the bottom but
[1:18:31] the confidence
[1:18:32] God had but the confidence the prophet
[1:18:35] had in God he kept saying yes that's
[1:18:38] what God said yes I'm gonna get the
[1:18:41] Silvertip yes between here and there I'm
[1:18:44] gonna intercept him
[1:18:45] so whether the seventh team come from it
[1:18:47] came from his confidence not knowing
[1:18:56] what's gonna happen next
[1:18:58] believing in God and here comes the
[1:19:07] superchip he kills the Silvertip holy
[1:19:10] church before I close look God uses
[1:19:15] Gideon in when he scariest moments you
[1:19:19] know he's back yet hiding an angel comes
[1:19:22] and visits him in that so like God huh
[1:19:26] in one of your scariest situation God
[1:19:30] does something ugly to give you such a
[1:19:33] confidence that change a life forever
[1:19:35] you think you think about new Hebrew
[1:19:37] boys hallelujah now they already had an
[1:19:40] element accompli
[1:19:42] but God was gonna turn into supreme
[1:19:44] confidence he say he said music come
[1:19:50] maybe we need to come everybody fall
[1:19:52] down and worship then boy's head not
[1:19:55] else told me we don't worship without

[1:20:02] that and besides how God is able to
[1:20:05] deliver us every don't dude listen to
[1:20:09] this confidence if he doesn't deliver us

[1:20:21] see but you know what talking talk is
[1:20:26] good oh how we say talk is cheap but

[1:20:45] head wrote a check because in cash but
[1:20:48] it wasn't up to them because their
[1:20:51] conference was in there God the great
[1:20:53] deliverer look before they got to the
[1:20:56] fire they were already saying our God to
[1:20:59] deliver else now I was goggles stand
[1:21:02] back haven't even told the whole kingdom
[1:21:04] how God is using heosu magazine no I
[1:21:09] don't feel like delivering the night he
[1:21:13] got to because he got the big confident
[1:21:15] some more you know that new chance a lot
[1:21:19] of times your child is not for you but
[1:21:22] it's for the people watching you cuz God
[1:21:25] would have build that confidence in the
[1:21:27] real God you you'd be surprised
[1:21:30] and how many people I've met her that
[1:21:33] have had cancer or brain to like me and
[1:21:36] they tell me out my testimony help them
[1:21:40] so it wasn't hariya just me going
[1:21:43] through a trial no God will use that
[1:21:45] testimony to build go in a church he was
[1:21:58] they get down and walking put those in
[1:22:00] fire they step in fire God already
[1:22:03] plotting in heaven god I really look at
[1:22:06] that scene
[1:22:07] God got angels nothing oh come on let me
[1:22:09] go let me go deliver just let me go
[1:22:11] deliver them because they know that's
[1:22:13] his weight they know God's weight is a
[1:22:15] way of deliverance honey so god honey
[1:22:18] the angels are standing back saying go
[1:22:20] to this time let me go to this time I
[1:22:22] love when you use me in the motion of
[1:22:25] deliverance
[1:22:25] can I go let me meet wormwood I mean
[1:22:28] those Gabriel I can be mighty I can do
[1:22:30] and God says nope ain't none of y'all go
[1:22:32] understand they asked for me they said
[1:22:36] my God is able to deliver us so since I
[1:22:40] just believe I just believe before they
[1:22:44] even stepped in the fire God was already
[1:22:46] in there
[1:22:50] and when they walk did holy church when
[1:22:53] they walked in honey when they've
[1:22:55] stepped into that fire all three of them
[1:22:57] everybody got no then feel anything huh
[1:23:00] the clothes the clothes became fire
[1:23:03] resistant Wow they cause became
[1:23:09] fireproof they became firefighters
[1:23:16] before there ever was a firefighter
[1:23:20] Church and then oh yeah the witnesses
[1:23:23] come back and say I thought you do three
[1:23:25] of them in there they say no I see four
[1:23:28] look like the Son of God
[1:23:31] Seaton hey dealing with the confidence
[1:23:33] of the people looking around huh and
[1:23:36] think about it when the boys stuff not
[1:23:37] to fire everybody everybody around knew
[1:23:41] that their God was real produce the
[1:23:44] confidence in the whole land where where
[1:23:48] where they probably changed the whole
[1:23:50] ordinance on worship I'm a close I'm
[1:23:58] patata closer Gideon Gideon God wasn't
[1:24:01] doing him God say I want you to go down
[1:24:04] and fight take over everything so give
[1:24:06] me steps out with his large army but the
[1:24:08] army he wouldn't fight was three times
[1:24:10] bzees if it was 90,000 get it only had
[1:24:15] 30 that's already defeated battle unless
[1:24:20] you got some ammunition some secret
[1:24:22] weapons that day never seen before
[1:24:24] but this is all new to Gideon Gideon
[1:24:27] ain't know how to fight
[1:24:28] so just what God does God oh yeah
[1:24:31] God be your confidence it'll be
[1:24:36] unshakable
[1:24:37] now the blessing in not knowing getting
[1:24:40] is like how I got my 30 pound leg up by
[1:24:45] landing what we gonna do
[1:24:47] so God beginner God we're gonna do
[1:24:49] things that seem even more ridiculous
[1:24:51] God there you know you got two minutes
[1:24:53] just shake that down about ten dollars
[1:24:56] so he shake it down some more so they go
[1:24:59] out and he you know he thought yeah the
[1:25:01] only
[1:25:02] they just you know on the way in God
[1:25:04] says hey I want you separate I want you
[1:25:07] to put this group of winners group
[1:25:08] overhead
[1:25:08] you don't watch how they drink the water
[1:25:10] you know what y'all know I'm
[1:25:11] paraphrasing Bobby - ain't just like I'm
[1:25:14] paying phrase for the sake of time you
[1:25:16] know and you got this group over here
[1:25:17] this group / - everybody drinking you
[1:25:19] know I got him the Lord that drink you
[1:25:22] know ain't looking around
[1:25:23] Jim Jim didn't want you alone but he
[1:25:25] wasn't drinking and watching where they
[1:25:27] do it the other one she won't and just
[1:25:28] so happened it was only 300 m now you go
[1:25:34] from thousands to 300 it looked like
[1:25:43] Gideon should have no more confidence
[1:25:47] the one thing I love and blessing and
[1:25:50] not knowing how he's gonna win this
[1:25:52] battle because God made it look
[1:25:55] impossible so when he won the battle it
[1:25:59] would produce his confidence from there
[1:26:01] on out
[1:26:02] - never doubt God again he takes 300
[1:26:05] million honey you go down God honey go
[1:26:08] into the camp stay at the camp and I
[1:26:10] always didn't not run Gideon had did
[1:26:16] nothing what was it it was the mighty
[1:26:18] God behind him it was mighty God it
[1:26:22] wasn't even the 300 me it was the mighty
[1:26:26] God behind him in one place
[1:26:29] before they're gonna fight God see some
[1:26:31] bees out and one of my favorites and I
[1:26:39] do this sometimes one of my favorite the
[1:26:42] king of the king of Syria wrote Hezekiah
[1:26:44] a letter tell Hezekiah not to trust in
[1:26:47] his God
[1:26:48] don't you trust in your God you seen
[1:26:50] what I did and you Brian
[1:26:52] you see what I did to the other kingdoms
[1:26:53] who trusted in any God don't you be
[1:26:55] foolish enough to trust in your God so
[1:26:57] you know his guy did
[1:26:59] Hezekiah took the letter did he win in
[1:27:02] the prayer and the Bible says he spread
[1:27:04] a little before a Lord and he was down
[1:27:06] to pray he read the letter to God he's a
[1:27:09] lord this is what the king of Syria is
[1:27:12] saying about you
[1:27:20] take your light wheel take your mortgage
[1:27:23] holder take your bank statements Oh God
[1:27:27] and you say this is what my financial
[1:27:30] situation is this is what they say that
[1:27:33] I shouldn't trust in you and my provider
[1:27:37] and better yet if I played my time it
[1:27:41] doesn't matter what it look like you
[1:27:43] still alive I'm already blessed I'm just
[1:27:53] waiting on God just feel my confidence
[1:27:55] in this area honey so Gideon wins the
[1:27:58] battle and you better leave from that
[1:28:00] point he never doubted God again look
[1:28:04] with Abraham gather the knife he was
[1:28:07] going down early the Bible says Abraham
[1:28:11] now I know you feel honey he says I
[1:28:15] won't hide nothing from you from this
[1:28:17] point on he and just just just give up
[1:28:23] stages of his journey in one place he
[1:28:25] was afraid told the king that's his
[1:28:27] right I mean I said sister when I was
[1:28:29] his wife he was afraid but then when God
[1:28:31] began to move with his life and God
[1:28:34] brought him out of that city can you
[1:28:35] imagine you lied to a person get all the
[1:28:37] stuff and that person come back you
[1:28:39] saying I'm sorry for you lying to me the
[1:28:49] key came back and apologized to Abraham
[1:28:53] for Abraham has lied to him
[1:28:58] wouldn't that builds your confidence we
[1:29:01] did let you know that God is behind you
[1:29:03] you didn't be in the room and the person
[1:29:05] you did wrong to come back apologize
[1:29:08] kneel and passing you on your journey
[1:29:13] now can't you see what color Abraham
[1:29:17] would take hallelujah uh-uh
[1:29:19] 318 service and go fight two kings
[1:29:25] because God had built this confidence
[1:29:27] back here even though he know he was
[1:29:29] wrong honey now he's going to get his
[1:29:32] brother hallelujah I'm gonna read you
[1:29:39] something that I'm a close and this is
[1:29:41] the statement just blows me away blows
[1:29:44] me away Church listen and if you witness
[1:29:49] if you are witness to anything you're
[1:29:51] just as guilty as being a project of it
[1:29:54] so if we witness say oh yes they are to
[1:29:59] have done this and so and so be careful
[1:30:02] what you say because you're guilty the
[1:30:05] way you judge the way your judgment goes
[1:30:08] if you can't decide don't say nothing
[1:30:12] honey you can't decide they'll say I'm
[1:30:15] gonna do this I'll be ready you don't
[1:30:17] know just say I don't know listen he
[1:30:21] said just leave it alone then when you
[1:30:23] testified that you are Christian then
[1:30:26] you're guilty see you're guilty of being
[1:30:29] a Christian and you must live to that
[1:30:32] and when that listen this is where I'm
[1:30:34] going and when God makes a promise in
[1:30:37] the Bible
[1:30:38] I see a man here in a wheelchair when
[1:30:41] God makes a promise he's guilty of that
[1:30:44] promise unless he brings it to pass huh
[1:30:51] my childhood
[1:30:52] Danny look skim milk to me hallelujah
[1:30:54] that's vitamin D right there huh he said
[1:30:59] when God makes a promise God is guilty
[1:31:02] of fulfilling that promise listen I it's
[1:31:05] gonna resonate a little bit more listen
[1:31:07] he said God is guilty when he makes a
[1:31:10] promise and oh my oh my let me back up
[1:31:13] back up he said what God makes a promise
[1:31:16] in the Bible hurry I see a man here in a
[1:31:20] wheelchair when God makes a promise he's
[1:31:22] guilty that promise unless he brings it
[1:31:24] to pass God is guilty when he makes a
[1:31:27] promise and the Scriptures are guilty
[1:31:30] until they are fulfilled
[1:31:32] oh I feel like the Pentecostal preacher
[1:31:38] y'all don't hear me God is Dukie unless
[1:31:46] that promise that you be in is fulfilled
[1:31:50] in your life this purchase I put myself
[1:31:57] in every broke my 70 book or so the
[1:32:02] Bible says higher if you delight
[1:32:04] yourself in the Lord he promised to give
[1:32:07] you the desires of your heart I know I
[1:32:10] got desires and I delight myself in the
[1:32:13] Lord so the stitches are Gucci a deal my
[1:32:17] desires are fulfilled promises all over
[1:32:28] the Bible and God has fulfilled him not
[1:32:31] to remain guilty
[1:32:32] I got a promise right now that God is
[1:32:37] working old because the Bible says that
[1:32:39] the Holy Ghost is unto you and unto your
[1:32:41] children the scriptures are duty with
[1:32:48] the Holy Ghost not in QG oh yes the
[1:33:07] scriptures are guilty hunt is the field
[1:33:12] in your life oh my see that's right as a
[1:33:19] statement that God has made and it's got
[1:33:23] to be fulfilled or God is guilty how can
[1:33:29] I innocent God be guilty he can't
[1:33:34] because that's not a part of his
[1:33:36] character
[1:33:37] you'll never find God guilty so one way
[1:33:42] or another he has to fulfill
[1:33:45] what you believe in and what does that
[1:33:50] do that Purdue see right now I'm
[1:33:52] confident I'm confident honey because
[1:33:57] I'm blessed in that know what's gonna
[1:33:58] happen but I'm confident because right
[1:34:01] here I just read a quotation that said
[1:34:03] God is guilty holy and to the promise of
[1:34:06] the word what I believe is fulfilled our
[1:34:09] life
