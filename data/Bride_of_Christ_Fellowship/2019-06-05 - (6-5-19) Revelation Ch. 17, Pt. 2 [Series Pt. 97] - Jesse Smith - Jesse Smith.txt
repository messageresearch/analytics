His grace that's what you did for me mercy we restore will they fall before me ah [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] thank God Razia let's take our Bibles here just go to Revelation 17 so thankful for God's mercy tonight praise the Lord revelations and would like to just pick up on where we left off last week revelation 17 and I think Lord willing tonight we'll start looking at all the proofs about Mystery Babylon and I think it'd be good for the the children here to go through these by the grace of the Lord it's revelation 17 let's start at verse 6 I believe we read 2 verse 5 and let's look to the Lord here after we read our text and ask the Lord to help us here tonight revelation 17 6 let's all read verse 6 together then I'll read verse 7 myself Sabri there everybody got their Bibles there thanks girls let's all read verse 6 ready one two three and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration now read verse seven your Lord willing and then verse seven and the angel said unto me wherefore didst thou marvel I will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the Beast that carried her which hath the seven heads and ten horns let's have one more word of Prayer let's just bow our heads here have any father we're so thankful for your mercy Lord I think of this chapter Lord you called me out of this woman Lord you called me out of this church Nora and her daughters and I thank you for that Lord God that's what your mercy did for me so loadings me great praise though it rises up in my soul Lord I say thank you Lord this is what your mercy did for me it called me out Lord and separated me unto you that I could be your child I could learn to walk with you Lord God and learn to love you bless us here tonight in your divine presence as we preach in your word and sing and worship Lord God the Father will give you all the glory and what I'm trusting you to answer these requests that we've lifted up tonight again thank you for it Lord Jesus we feel you near Lord God and may you be pleased with our worship and father honor these requests in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god bless you me and Sita then praise the Lord before you get started Lydia if I run out of battery let me know just go like that because it's you know the brothers preach brother Diggs preached with her twice on Sunday and it's been a while since I switched the batteries so case our case I run out let me know well let's look here to the Scriptures last week we looked at part 1 and we showed how wisdom was required to recognize this identity of this woman and we of course we all know it to be the Roman Catholic Church but if somebody didn't know it we're going to start proving it here tonight by God's grace and then we also looked at the confusion around Mystery Babylon who could it be and the the second-closest will on the runner-up we thought and I felt like as after studying it was Jerusalem because Jerusalem is called a harlot and a city but yet I did the math this week as well there's only 11 million Jews in the entire world and 82 percent of them live in the United States and Israel now there's a thousand millions in a billion try to wrap your mind around that one because you can go up to 999 million and then when you get your thousandth million now you've got 1 billion all right so 11 million Jews and there's 1.3 billion Catholics so the Jew the Jews cannot be this woman who sits upon Malta and waters and nations and tongues the Jews can't be because 11 million is not even it's not even a tenth of the 1.3 billion it's like not even it's not even 1% so it can't be Jerusalem Jerusalem can't be and neither can the Muslims because Istanbul which we'll look at a little bit here Istanbul sits on seven hills and that's a very famous city but if sambal is not even the headquarters of Islam Mecca is Mecca is a different City where they all take their pilgrimage right there their command and once a once their lifetime to go to Mecca and we don't of course we don't have any pilgrim pilgrim ridges and the message although some people might think so but we don't have any the main pilgrim we got to be is just be a pilgrim and stranger all the days of our life and don't let this world become our home praise God we got to have homes gotta have jobs got to have food but it never really is our home our home is New Jerusalem praise God we have to make sure we keep it that way although we appreciate home and brother Branham had said in a couple occasions you know he had a rambling spirit he wished you know he could have stayed in Drew in Jeffersonville that would have been his home but he God had to give him a rambling spirit to spread the message and so we're thankful that you know that we can have a home and I'm thankful I don't have to ramble around the world thank God for that I love to be home so Jerusalem is the runner up but still only has a few matching requirements and so we know this woman has to be Rome and let me start out with this let me read this there was two other church age messengers that believed now of course probably more but at least two of them that I know of that believe Mystery Babylon was Rome one of them was Iranian and one of them was Martin Luther now on top of that you had other church fathers that I've read that believed Rome was Mystery Babylon lack lactantius Tertullian of course he started the word Trinity so he had some things right but he had some things awful wrong Jerome was an other church Father and then Reformation Reformers John Knox John Calvin William Tyndale and John Wickliffe all believed that Rome was the mother harlot and so I we we find it there's much great evidence that this woman is Rome now I have eleven proofs and we'll try to go through these quite quickly or we'll try to go through them quickly so then we can move on Lord winning in the weeks to come but as I realize you know I've gotten numerous emails and calls that people are really enjoying the live stream and so I don't know who's listening but I know I want to go through this this chapter and I want to preach it and of course I know my children need to hear it as well so I'll try to go quick but maybe not too quick now let's look at verse one here I'll try to look at these scriptures here revelation 17 1 and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying come hither I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great that sitteth upon many waters with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication verse three so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written Mystery Babylon the Great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth I will stop right there now some of these symbols we already looked at remember a couple weeks ago we looked at the horrors forehead remember that 144,000 had the father's name in their forehead but this false church has a whole horse forehead which means she's unashamed of her sin and that's in Jeremiah chapter 2 we're not going to read it because we already read but the Bible said God God anoints Jeremiah to say Jerusalem you have a horse forehead because you're unashamed he said but I'm gonna give you pastors after my own heart that'll feed you praise God and he say the only thing you got to do is acknowledge your iniquity be honest before God confess your sin tell the truth admit where you're wrong and God said I'll receive you if your turn from your sins and acknowledge where you fell short and if you return to me God said I'll return to you amen Oh God is so gracious to forgive and so it's so much greater than we would you know we would give somebody five chances maybe six chances you know but God is so merciful life time after time after time God continued us to have mercy and all we can say is thank God for divine mercy because human mercy can only go so far but God's mercy goes way beyond ours Amen hallelujah now let's look at these reasons now I like to just hit a few scriptures just to kind of give you a place to stand here on the Word of God let's go to acts yeah let's go to book of Acts and I want to read a couple of verses here acts 738 yeah let's just react 738 so I just want to show a few scriptures how a woman is a church and so Israel we know was was a church acts 738 now let's read 38 this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in mount sinai with our fathers who received the lively Oracle's given to us so the Bible calls Moses with Israel and then speaking of God God says I was with the church in the wilderness because the word church of course means called out alright now go to Ezekiel 16 so not only as Israel Church Israel is a woman so john sees a woman in revelation 17 so this woman has to be a church and like i said i'm doing this for the young children I know Beatrice knows this I'm sure Aaron knows this but bear with us were we're laying down the foundations for the children so the children know that all right so zekiel sixteen and let's pull the first one there lady went and pull verse one of this a beautiful chapter it shows how God found Israel in Egypt and the Bible says it's like she was laying in her own blood you know she was just left for dead spiritually but God came and rescued her so it's a beautiful picture of the Lord look let's go down to verse 4 as for thy nativity thy birth in the day that I was born thy navel was not cut neither was now wash and water to supple thee that was not salted on or swaddled at all no I pity thee to do any of these under thee I have compassion upon thee but thou was cast out in the open field to the look no thing of that person the day that thou was born and when I passed by the install the pollutant thine own blood I said unto thee where now what's in thy blood live yay I said in thee when thou wast in thy blood live now let's go to verse 8 now when I pass by thee and looked upon me behold that time was the time of love and I spread my skirt over thee and covered thy nakedness yeah I swear unto thee and entered into covenant with thee saith the Lord and now became as mine now I'm gonna skip down here go down to verse 15 without his trust in that own beauty and play the harlot because of thy renown and pours out life or negations on every one that passed by his it was now this is striking isn't it God finds Israel in her lowest most bloody most awful position you could be in and God spreads his skirt over and God then cleans her washes her out adorns her and she gets all beautiful and gets a husband and then she starts flirting with other men now go to verse 3 though I'll go to verse 2 though that you can see this is Jerusalem son of man cause drew 'some to know her abominations now we know God knows the beginning from the end right God knew Jerusalem was going to turn away but even in his mercy even God knowing that they would backside God still chose the khalsa call it Jerusalem out of the world see because he wanted a kingdom of priests he one of the people that would worship Him and serve him amen and so God knows our church if God will forgive drew Israel Jerusalem for all that they've done and still save them through the Covenant of the blood of bulls and goats on Mount Sinai then we know God will be with us despite our mistakes because our covenant is with the blood of Jesus Christ amen my god knew they would backside God knew they'd even crucify his own son but yet his love extend to them how much more does his love extend us amen through the blood of Christ amen see it was a church and it was a woman so a woman children always represents the church and this is good for you nature and virtue that's right good good for them too you know that's this is all good for everybody so you can see this is playing the scripture he's speaking to a city he's speaking to the capital of Israel and he's saying you're like a woman that I cleaned up and I decked out like her wedding day but yet she wasn't faithful to me all right now go to verse 22 so you can see this too and in all that abominations and I whoredoms thou must not remember the days that I youth when thou was naked and bare and what's polluting that blood so see I can I can understand I can relate with how people may get confused with Babylon being Jerusalem because it's some of the same language can everybody see that now of course that's without the understanding the message but see we never want to get prideful and say why can't you see it you know we God has to open their eyes right and they have to be open to God opening their eyes we can't give a revelation we can pray for people to get revelation but only the father said only the father have revealed it to you amen the father has revealed to them so we have to be merciful and that's just a beautiful scripture there that God here says remember the days years now that's what we need to remember church we must never get too far removed from what did we look like before we came in the message or what kind of life did we live you know sometimes I'm sure I'm sure Beatrice you know so we've served God you know I'm coming up on 20 years on most of in the message and and Beatrice probably a lot longer than that but you know sometimes we forget how far God has brought us from but that that's the trouble Israel got in Israel forgot how awful it was in Egypt and we've got to remember say God help me not to get complacent where I forget where you brought me from help me to remember the big pet that I was in before I came back to the father's house amen help me to realize how great I've got it amen help me not to forget all your benefits that you daily bestow upon me amen amen and I was listening to brother Branham you know today condemnation by representation and boat man was saying he said he said look at the master child he said that fornication was so evil that it took forty generations to purify that seed line before that bastard child could enter in the kingdom of God that's over 400 years so of course he could never that bastard child could never go in or is the sentence to 40 generations now that's that that's that's unreal but bro man was saying that's how evil fornication is to God but then we know by the end of the message God gave brother rather the revelation that the blood of Jesus Christ washes all that away and a bastard child today can still be born again and filled with the Holy Ghost amen because of God's great mercy and love but sometimes we forget you know the awfulness of our sin and we forget where we came from that's what God's telling Israel you forgot what it was to be like over there and he says never forget be always grateful and everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you amen as our brother was preaching on Sunday about not murmuring and not complaining I thought surely was for me that sermon was really for me because I don't want to complain I want to be thankful in all situations I want to look up where all the blessings come from I don't want to I don't want to get angry I don't want to get upset with situations because anything that happens God allowed it and it's for my good amen all these things work together for good to them that love the Lord now a familiar scripture Bertold Ephesians 5 or well since we're there go to John 329 since we're there so I want the children to see this John 329 I'm trying to let the Lord help me too or just follow lenient leadership of the Lord and maybe show some scriptures maybe the children haven't heard before John 329 this is beautiful you know when I first saw this I just like wow the Bible really says this you know this is really wonderful truth John 329 all right now let's go to the verse 28 though ye yourselves bear me witness and I said I'm not the Christ but I am but that I am sent before him so John the Baptist was sent before to prepare the way for Christ verse 29 keep the half the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is filled fulfilled he must increase but I must decrease amen how do any man of God any messenger any forerunner of Christ will always say help me to decrease and may Jesus Christ increase amen hallelujah I children did you catch that John the Baptist is saying I'm a friend to the bridegroom or the husband I am a friend of the of Christ in other words and I rejoice in the voice of Christ but he says he that is the bridegroom he that's the husband is the one who has the wife in other words John saying I'm not married to the church Jesus is married to the church amen the church is not my wife it's not I'm just trying to point I'm the friend of the husband and I'm just trying to bring them together amen brother bands not her husband he's just pointing us to our husband amen now children do you see that John the Baptist calls Jesus the husband and that means the husband has a wife and we're the wife we're the Bride of Christ okay we're called the Church of Living God now go to Ephesians 5:22 and I'm taking a lot of time on this but I want to just anchor in their hearts Asian's 5:22 well for times sake let me just skip ahead here let's go to let's go to five 22 wives submit yourselves unto your own husband's as into the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church so Christ's wife is called a church alright and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husband's in everything now of course brother man tells us not if your husband tells you to break the word you don't submit to sin but everything that's in the Lord you submit in the Lord now go down to verse 32 this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church there it is again so see a church always represents a woman or a group of people and so now getting back to Mystery Babylon John looks up and he sees a woman sitting on a scarlet coloured Beast so this woman is a church alright now that's so the first proof here the first proof that the Catholic Church is Mystery Babylon is that the Catholic Church is a woman in the in the sight of God according to definitions of the Bible because a woman is a church that's the first proof so see it can't be Istanbul Turkey because Istanbul Turkey is not a church right it's just a city of the Muslims where a lot of Muslims live there but it's not a church okay so right there that knocks off Istanbul the Mystery Babylon can't be in the Muslims it's got to be somebody else it's got to be Rome alright so that's the first one second one the Catholic Church is modern day Babylon now children you know in Genesis 10 and 11 Babylon is first named at what the tower Babel right now this was a group of men and women that wanted to reach heaven by man-made means while establishing a name for themselves right they said we're gonna reach to heaven right and we're gonna make a name for ourselves so we're gonna reach heaven in our own name and that just gets right into blasphemous names right well we're we're Pentecostal so we can make it to heaven on our own or we're we're Lutheran we're Baptists we're Methodists we're message we can make it there on our own we'll only make it to heaven by the name of Jesus Christ we don't take any other name yeah we got to have a church name on the building and be recognized by the government yeah we got to have a movement that we're associated with message to the our but that's not a real name our real name is mrs. Lord Jesus Christ amen because the whole family in heaven and earth is named Lord Jesus Christ so those really you know message really isn't our name that's just what we call our movement okay just like the Lutheran's were you know they were Lutheran's because that was the movement of their day right but really we're a Holy Ghost fool Christian's married to Jesus Christ that's our real name the Lord Jesus Christ now you know God stopped Babylon's movement by confounding their language now the Roman Catholic Church is modern Babel because it promotes a false man-made path to heaven contrary to Scripture now what it does it gives a false works requirement for salvation which one man calls an arduous process so if you ever read their book which I've read it not all the way through but I've read their catechism it's hard to understand their way to heaven it's really hard there's all these kind of penances they do and there's different levels of sins and they got to go do all these things and confess their sins and member church they can't they cannot have the anointing of the Holy Ghost on them unless that they recently had that wafer did you know that their book says as long as that wafers in their body they got the anointing but as soon as they pass it and use the restroom whatever and the twelve hours goes by digestant they don't have it anymore the anointings off them oh I'm so glad for a seal that stays in my soul the anointings in my soul not to 12 hours but to the day of redemption amen that's why Mel Gibson went in that movie passion you if you read his testimony he took communion every single day because he wanted to make sure he was under the anointing I'm so glad we don't have to do that I'm so glad we don't have to go take a natural way for a natural to make sure I'm anointed what we have to do to make sure we're anointed is pray confess our sins worship because he inhabits the praises of his people amen so see it's a it's a hard thing to get saved in the Catholic Church because it's based upon works and remember it's mandatory according to their paragraph and let me call the paragraph number according to paragraph 1030 it's mandatory that they go to purgatory or hell a form of Hell it's mandatory so when they die it's not a happy thing they know well they think they know that they have to go and suffer in order to go to heaven to be purified oh I'm so glad Jesus does the purification right now Haven Oh what a hope that we have to know that angels are going to pack us or care us not to a place of torment where we have to suffer and say I'm sorry Hail Mary I'm sorry Hail Mary but we can go right to the Friends of God with a brand new body get a theophany body and rejoice with the millions of others that have theophany bodies that will come run and hug us and say my precious brother my precious sister amen it's not a sad thing it's pure joy amen to cross over in that land hallelujah but see just as the original babel exalted their own name Babel Rome does the same thing because they call themselves the holy sea or the Holy Church so they've exalted the name of the Holy See above Jesus Christ they've exalted Mary's name the mother of God they've exalted that above the name of Jesus right because now she's the mother of God well who's higher than God well the only person that could be higher than God is the mud of God because the mothers a wonder that the offspring comes out of right so the mother of God is actually above God now they've exalted another name there's another way to get to heaven through the mother mine so the Catholic Church is a matter today at modern-day Babylon and you and I know that the image in Daniel chapter 2 had four parts to it now of course the last part had the feet and the feet that were both iron and clay but the head was Babylon but we know that each part was Babylon because it was the same spirit right just in a different Kingdom right so is the same demons of Babylon demons that was in Babylon with the Medes and Persians right and then the same demons were a king the Alexander the Great and the same demons were the the Roman Empire but now all those demons are in the unholy Roman Empire right the Roman Catholic Church so we know this so now we know the second proof not only is she's a she's the church it's the Roman Catholic Church it's a woman but the second one is that she's the modern day Babylon that's right now let me say there's two let's go to a scripture here let's go to Daniel 2:35 you got your Bibles and Lydia maybe could board up there Daniel 2:35 now some people say that Rome is the final Kingdom and this this image of Daniels already fulfilled but that's it can't be right because of Daniel 2:35 then was the iron the clay the brass the silver the gold broke into pieces together and became like chaff of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the gray image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth some people say that that Jesus when he came the first time was his stone that came and broke the Roman Empire and now now the the images no more the Roman empires no more but anybody with half half half a wisdom or half an ounce of discernment knows that Christianity doesn't reign on the earth Christianity hasn't filled the earth right in fact jesus said he has to shorten the time at the end so that somebody can even be saved so Christianity is not growing Christianity shrinking and we're part of a shrinking group but thank God we're part of it amen we're just like Noah were some of the last believers brother Aaron amen we're some of these last ones that are coloring up who will come into the Ark of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen not in that's right but who will come in and be saved in this Great Escape the Great Tribulation his brother have said our Ark today is Jesus Christ weren't us were part of the shrinking movement a dying way a shrinking movement not dying maybe dying in number but living an eternal life praise God but see Jesus first coming did not fill the earth with Christianity this has to be the second coming this has to be the millennium as we read last week right because that stone becomes a mountain the stone hits the earth or the the image the image breaks up like chaff and that stone grows and covers the whole earth amen haha let us know what kind of science is that a stone that can hit the earth and then expand and cover the whole earth amen it's the growing power of God's Word you the stone has not come back yet we're still waiting for that stone and Babylon is still here it's just in a different form it's in the feet form of that image the feet form all right everybody got that okay puts the same Neiman Powers just in a different form and let me read this quote this is from March 1962 brother Branham said Russia I'm sorry Russia communism isn't going to conquer nothing God's Word can't fail Romanism is going to conquer the world it isn't Russia it's Rome thus saith the Lord so we know we've got thus saith the Lord Rome has to rule that that that image is going to stand until Jesus Christ returns for Armageddon praise God and then Armageddon the sword goes out of his mouth it breaks up everything dies right the birds come down and eat and that symbolizes that symbolized when when the sword comes out and destroys them that symbolizes chaff that image breaking up and dividing like chaff and then God's Word and holiness you know will burn up the whole earth and then righteousness will reign for a thousand years hey I'm halia praise God amen that's what it represents that's number two we got eleven of these I'm not sure how far we'll get tonight number three the Catholic Church is the mother of harlots so see the Roman Church is the first human organized and man led church God is not leading the mother harlots now the Roman Catholic Church claims that on their in their book that they are the mother church the church which every church took its start that's not true they're the church which every false Church took their start this church did not take a start for Rome our church started on the day of Pentecost I don't know yeah amen and we can trace our lineage all the way back praise God from brother Branham to John Wesley Hardin Luther and you could take them all the way back to st. Paul amen and keep taking them back all the way to say Peter amen our church started on the day of Pentecost and still going strong amen in the in the minority of believers we're still going strong in that small little group as we said we're a shrinking number but it's still going strong in their lives because the blood of Jesus Christ has never lost its power amen now she claims to be the mother church but because of her traditions she makes the Word of God of none effect she limits the Holy One of Israel praise the Lord now because she calls herself because she's called mother harlot so revelation 17 she's a mother of harlots and then the Catholic Church in their own book says they're the mother church Jesus calls her mother Jesus causes mother Jezebel in Revelation 220s let's read that again I know we preach down the church agent let's go to revelation 2:20 Jesus calls out this mother again and gives her a name she's called Jezebel there's got a lot of names done she's got mother harlot Mystery Babylon and here in revelation 2 Jesus calls her Jezebel because she's we're told that she has daughters revelation 2:20 this is in the authority of church age the darkest of all church ages we have the most deceptive but this is the darkest verse 20 notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things psycho sacrifice unto idols and I gave her space to repent of her fornication she repented not behold I will cast her into bed with them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds and I will kill her children so now we have Jezebel as a mother with children exactly right with death and all the churches shall know that I'm he would searches the reins of the hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your works ok children can everybody see that there that there Jesus names a mother's name and it's Jezebel and she's got daughters so there can't be two different churches there's only one false church right and she's the mother church right now this is quite striking let's go to a few scriptures here let's go to Ezekiel 16 44 oh we were just there yeah does he kill 16:44 let's read that but there and you want to read that for us when you get there brother he goes 16:44 now here's a great proverb that fits Jezebel and her daughters whatever you ready brother [Music] amen now this works good for godly women but it also works for evil women like Jezebel and I'm so thankful my children my daughter's got a wonderful mother I'm so thankful Naomi had a great mother over there sister Beatrice because as the mother is so is the daughters and the church said right now this is speaking of Jerusalem and Samaria Jerusalem the mother Samaria the daughter they both went a whoring after other idols right but this can be used in a good way to write with natural Gauley mothers that train their daughters to serve the Lord but concerning Jezebel she had an awful daughter named Athaliah I'm sorry Ethel Ethel ayah so let's turn there let's just read one scripture about her it's in second Kings 11:1 let's read that same Kings 11:1 and we she was an evil woman we know that she once her husband died she took over the kingdom and she tried to kill all the male's that could take her spot except the godly people found a little baby right they found that little boy I forget his name now but they hid him away so she couldn't kill so God never left himself without a witness praise God amen then when he come of age I think it was in the seventh year I think it was seven years old they came out in the seventh year which is a type of this church ages right and he comes out and they they kill Ethel ayah and they put the man the holy seed the godly seed they put the man back on the throw amen a type of the church so second Kings 11 and it was verse 1 oh yeah we got it right up there I'll just read that up there sorry got this and when after why the mother of as I has ayah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal so we know Jezebel was a murderer and look her daughter does the same thing amen remember the Bible said I think Jezebel killed 400 or 500 Hebrew prophets was it it was a whole bunch and of course nabe off for his vineyard you know she had him killed deceitfully so she was a murderer to the core now Jezebel was a murderer just like the Roman Catholic Church in their Wars and their inquisitions oh there's a great parallel Jezebel in the Catholic Church both did the same things they both had death their murders they're both I doubters and they both have sexual abuse sexual immorality amen Jezebel killed the Roman Catholic Church had Wars and inquisitions Jezebel wasn't I doubt her she built had a have build all these houses and what does the Roman Catholic Church do they have what's called the veneration of images and statues they venerate them which means honor but really they worship them right there to kiss them they're allowed to pray they think there's like a holy anointing on them so they worship them and they lay sacrifices you can see it all over their own website their own YouTube channel if you want they have it all over there so they death murderers idolaters the sex the third thing was sexual immorality the Bible said Jezebel caused people to commit whoredoms so we don't know she was involved with the whoredoms or she just let people do it but we know this the Roman Catholic Church is guilty of millions of sexual abuse cases with the the men clergy but also the nuns now that's starting to come out too those nuns are doing just as evil things as the men so do you see that how the Roman Catholic Church is perfectly parallel to Jezebel does everybody see that idolatry murders sexual immorality and every be every word be established in the mouth of two or three witnesses there it is right there Amen that's right now every church is an every Church that supports the mother harlot and doesn't speak out against her is a daughter of her right because who how can two walk together except there be agreed now I'll be friends with Catholics I'll say this like brother Ram my brother may have said he believed Catholic people could be saved but for us to say all they're they're all good people the systems are good people to say that the system is a good system to say that is a lie and to compromise against God's Word the reason people don't attack the Roman Catholic Church like they ought to is because of the Trinity doctrine right which is a great lie and program said there are that the other thing is communion they try to say well it's okay as long as they're having communion but remember they they they change the bullet the wine into literal blood and they change the bread and the literal body of Christ and that's what the word mass means sacrifice so every time they have communion it's like there there on Golgotha right maybe you didn't know that chair but that's what they believe every time they take the mass and the wafer and they drink it it's like they're at gal Gotha right there that's how real they say communion is that it's like Jesus is crucified again and so that's wrong that's not the Bible said he was crucified once and for all amen not every time Amen but once it fell praise God not every time they have you know their communion so see the mother has traded the word for Creed's and any church that does the same thing trades the words for Creed's and and and loves the mother and submits the mother is guilty of partaken of the same thing she's guilty of because of proverbs 17:15 that he pulled up there proverbs 17:15 and people say well you know every church has has hypocrites and you know we shouldn't judge the Catholic Church listen we should judge the church we should not condemn the people though because the people can be saved but the church can never be redeemed because Christ gave her space to repent and she repented not Amen see that the people there's some people that can be saved but the church cannot she's the mother of harlots she already turned her back she'll never be saved she's right for judgment look here see he that justifies the wicked to justify the Catholic Church to say well that church is going to come back and have revival it's impossible and he that condemneth that just even they're both an abomination to the Lord so see to justify and say well well you know Jesse your church has sinners in it too you know you shouldn't condemn the Catholic Church no we don't we've got the Bible say we passed now one way yes but another way no in our in our bodies we have sinned but in our souls we know they men because the soul the Bible said the soul has no more sin the Bible said the soul cannot see a name ahead oh yeah that's what the word of god says this eat of God cannot sit anymore amen so see we're not we have a part of us that doesn't sin anymore those churches don't have that because they can't be born again and remain in a dead church if you're born again and you've got life you've got to go to a place where you're getting life amen you'll die if you don't get fed the Word of God so it's impossible to be born again and stay in the denomination because there's no life there there's only life in the message of the hour amen see to justify that that woman is a she's a nice woman well she's done they have food pantries every weekend and they do nice things that that's fine it's good to feed the poor but the systems did the systems of the modern-day Jezebel she's guilty she'll never come back and we should say come out of her my people alright number four the Catholic Church sits on many waters and I said this earlier but let's go to Revelation 17 15 so I only done three proofs so far and Jerusalem can't meet this root three requirements neither can Istanbul Turkey neither can Albin II New York like we saw last week none of them can meet these requirements there's only one place in the world that meets the requirements in its Rome now and he said to me the waters which thou sawest where the sitteth are multitudes people's multitudes nations and tongues now here's recent data that I found online there's 1.3 billion Catholics that's almost 20% of the world's entire population so almost one out of five people are Roman Catholic in this earth one out of five now that's one that's one thousand three hundred million people that's 1.3 billion they have nearly a quarter million parishes worldwide that's a lot of churches they built so see just building a church doesn't make you save the false church builds you know the false church builds churches or we're building churches that's good but that don't mean you're saved anybody can do that they have parishes in nearly every country on the earth and nearly every nation has diplomatic or other political relations with the Holy See the number of Catholics is greater than that of nearly all other religious traditions there are more Roman Catholics than all other Christians combined and more Roman Catholics than all Buddhists or Hindus the only thing that's even close is Muslims and they're they're going to catch up pretty soon because they have so many children and then of course Christians don't well I shouldn't say Christians I should say denominational churches don't because they don't believe in fulfilling the Word of God that's true all right now the two largest Protestant churches are Anglican and Methodists and they both have eighty million members approximately so eighty million is nothing compared to 1.3 billion okay billion so eighty is nowhere eighties not even close to a thousand right 80s like eight percent of a thousand so it's not even close I mean to sign me close when you put Protestants next to Catholics it's not even close okay so can everybody see that that the Roman Catholic Church sits on many waters okay yeah Bri see that all right number five the Catholic Church sits on seven mountains or Hills now it's in revelation 17 nine if you got your Bible revelation seventeen nine they didn't even pull up there thank you and here is the mind which hath wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth now by God's grace let me pull this up here real quick I can list the names of them yeah I got all the seven names you probably not familiar with any of them Aventine sealian Palatine s Quillin Capitoline women'll and Carr quieren all Hill and these seven hills are only five miles from the Vatican Toki if you take a if you took a worldwide perspective the Seven Hills are really close to the Vatican right so this woman sits on seven mountains or Hills she's right there really close to it it can only be the city of Rome yeah five miles and remember Istanbul Turkey has seven hills as well it's religious majority are Muslim the second largest religion in the world but Istanbul's not the headquarters or the mother city of Islam that goes to Mecca and that's been proven just that's proven just by general fact Mecca is the mother city of Islam not assemble okay that's number five now we're gonna move a little faster number six the Catholic Church is a harlot or a to Christ now here's what the word means one who yields herself to defilement for the sake of gain and so this church has two very evils defilement for gain and idolatry so it has those two things so the Catholic Church spreads their church for gain they're trying to make money right and they're trying to increase idolatry rather than true worship all right now let's show this let's go to Romans seven for that you don't need to read this - and this would be a good reminder for us adults that note it because I haven't preached on Romans seven for a long time it's like a marriage and divorce Scripture so children here's why the Catholic Church will be judged as an unfaithful wife because anyone who takes the name of Jesus claims to be married to Jesus whether it's Catholic Lutheran Methodist Protestant whatever anyone who says I'm a Christian I believe in Christ you whoever says that is claiming to be married to Christ because they're a part of the church and we saw a church as a woman Christ is the bridegroom and the church is the bride all right now wherefore my brethren you also become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God amen glory the scene before we became filled with the Holy Ghost we were married we're married to the law of sin and death is that right you're married to it she used to obey I used to obey it by the custom and by the addictions and by the the bad pictures and the bad movies I used to obey that I used to be married to it I was tied to it but Jesus divorced me from that Amen hallelujah those chains have been broken you know the divorce papers have been signed amen I'm divorced from sin and death and I'm married to Jesus Christ the word see that's what the word says so Malachi you need to be married to another to Christ case Yun Haven and cares and virtue and sorry nature sorry all those names my fault everyone you're married to Jesus Christ when you say how would it be a new creature I'm baptized and I'm going to serve guys you become married to Christ now you're married now you got to be true to your husband so this is how the Catholic Church can be a because they take the name of Christ within they make love with idols with evil spirits right doctrines of devils the Bible said claiming to believe this book claiming to love this book when tell their members well don't go don't go too crazy with it right don't read it too much don't become like brother Ray was telling us a few weeks ago remember he was Catholic but they said well if you read it don't become like crazy like those fanatics they said oh they said just listen to your priest mostly they said you can read it but just don't go crazy like those fanatics in the front that he's talked about the Protestants that's what he was told as a child in the Catholic Church you can read it but don't become one of those fat fanatics I'm glad to be a fanatic for Christ amen you're gonna be a fanatic for somebody let's be a fanatic for Jesus amen let's go all the way for Christ to see Romans seven says you got to be married to Jesus Christ alright I'm looking at a few scriptures here that we could read see which ones you might want to read yeah let's just go and read this Lydia Pope John 13 I'm sorry John 15:3 now this is after Judas had already got filled with Satan and he left in chapter 13 now Jesus is preaching them he said now you are clean so Judas is there so Judas can't be clean through the word which I've spoken to you and it just struck me right now see the only way to be clean is to stay with the word Judas walked for a long time but not long enough when he left the word he's no longer clean only the people that stay with the Lord all their lives are gonna be clean in a glory just struck me like that see he's already left in 3rd chapter 13 he's not there anymore they're there singing hymns or making their way out to you know guess M&E but you're only clean so a wife to Jesus will only be clean through the current spoken word amen hallelujah that's what we've got the spoken word the original seed of God's Word amen thank your order we can be clean we can be a clean Church amen if we stay with God's Word hallelujah that's why it's so important but the Roman Catholic Church has received the wrong seed or false teachings of Satan and then share those lies with the peoples from nearly every nation the Bible said in verse 17 verse 2 ladypau 17 to Revelation 17 - she commits fornication with the kings of the nations of the earth and she does this by pleasing the governments and people rather than pleasing her husband Christ the word okay so we got that can every see that the kings of the earth so the Catholic Church goes in the countries and they say things that please the earth the kings of the earth remember I showed you a few weeks ago well I told you about the Pope kissing the feet of those leaders from Africa I forget their name yeah I pulled up here real quick as Sudan yeah Sudan North and Southern Sudan yeah all she got to do is like it here's a quick picture kind of hard to see there but the Pope kissed their feet come on the Pope kissed their feet did you see that a couple of weeks ago see the Pope the Pope goes into their country and he kisses their feet he pleases them that's him kissing the feet of the the Sudan Kings because they stop their civil war so he goes in there and he and he basically flatters them right he kisses their feet and the Bible said don't fall down and worship any man's feet right amen don't worship any man right where's him Christ now I mentioned this a few months ago too but I'm gonna say it again when the Pope vis the United States in September 2015 he addressed Congress and he called for cooperation unity and peace but he never rebuked the nation for all the murders of abortion that they've been doing he rebuked the he rebuked the country more for not let me say it I want to read it exactly I want to read it the right way oh for clim change he rebuked America because we're not making greater sense for climate change and he he left out all the 54 million abortions that have been done in this country which you're probably more than that Steve he's pleasing the kings of the earth 54 million but don't you know the Bible says the blood of Abel cried from the ground up to heaven and if that was just one man what about 54 million voices crying up to heaven right and they're all crying up there to say God have mercy and the Pope just comes in and says you need to do a better job with your with your exhausts coming out of your car you need to do more recycling and yet all these voices are crying up to heaven mercy on a revenge on blood and you know Jesus is going to avenge their blood amen this nation is going to be judged all these tornadoes and floods and earthquakes it's God's judgment against this nation so all those millions of voices going up there but you had this Pope what does he do he commits fornication with the kings of the earth did you know when he came there was eleven thousand people in lined up on the streets by the White House and they hired trumpeters to Trump it and they had they hired a course of people to sing out a man as he passed the but the the article said they had a course of amens as the Pope drove by coming to the White House see heaven is trumpeting for him and I'm sorry earth is trumpeting and saying amen for him but heaven is condemning him because he won't stand for God's Word because they're committing fornication with the Obamas or if the trumps near the Trump's or the Bush family whoever it is if they compromise on God's Word they're committing fornication right now God can forgive it thank God he can forgive but when we repent we got to have fruits worthy of repentance and so we all need amen fifty-four million voices crying to God but how does he come in like a wolf in sheep's clothing my goodness now let me close with this I'm just gonna close with these last few things I'll give me ten minutes hear me closest false doctrine is like unto bad seat right because remember way in the parable Jesus told the good Soler's of son of man he's so good seat but then the the saying came around so bad seed right so false doctrine is like bad seed and so this church spreads her wrong see she's friends she spreads her false converts around the world with false doctrine now I'm gonna go through a list let me see one two three four five six seven let me I'll close of these just last seven quick points so here's some of the false doctrine she spreads around just seven quick things that you can all see how evil it is the first one is mandatory clerical celibacy which means priests are not allowed to marry and look what this has caused sexual abuse and they get that because they say well like Jesus and Paul you know Catholic Catholic men should be more they should have free from distractions so they can serve God but the Bible says a bishop must rule his own house and his children before he can rule the house of God amen now really what the church is trying to they're trying to save money so that they don't have to pay the preacher and feed his children - that's what they're trying to do right that's and that's what videos that's what news videos say when these when these abuse victims come and they and they they expose the Catholic Church that's what they say I've seen that I've seen that on their own videos That's not me that's what they're saying the reason they don't want these men to marry is so that the church does have to feed the mouse of those children that's what that's what they say so they could have more money for the Roman Catholic Church shame on them that's an evil doctrine that's a doctrine of devils the Bible said that's a seducing spirit and a doctrine of devils and it's led to this sex abuse epidemic through this false doctrine that's right now every now and then Church you'll have a man who's really strong and anointed and can be celibate you know there's a few around the message that they never get married and they're strong for God they can serve God that way and God bless them for that st. Paul said I wish you were all like me but if we're all like him there'd be fewer Christian converts right there be surely less pastors we'd have no home churches because the pastor asked the rulers own children first before he can rule the house of God second was the one I told you transubstantiation it teaches the bread and wine are the literal substance of the body and blood of Jesus Christ this is idolatry this exalts the bread and the wine into deity can you imagine that it's like this right here if we're at the Catholic Church this would change into deity this is God now come here and drink God is what they'd say that's what they're saying drink God like it's some natural real thing but we know when we drink in the anointing or when we drink in God's Word that's DNA coming at us amen see how close it is it's so close but it would not deceive the elect because the elect be deceived amen see they're saying drink this eternal life but that's what we do every service amen a fresh anointing and we're drinking in the living waters of God amen see it's such a closed thing but it's so perverted at the same time the Bible calls the cup of blessing aren't you glad for the blessing we get just just in the natural cup it's symbolic it's not a it but we do get a blessing by doing that now number three is the Pope office and the the Holy Father title now if Pope means father and Latin if you didn't know that Pope means father in Latin but the bottle said the five preaching officers Pope's not in there it's possible prophet teacher pastor evangelist there's no father in there jesus said call no man father in matthew 23:9 but paul said there would be some preachers that were like a father to you because he described his relationship with timothy as a son with a father and he claimed the corinthians were begotten to christ through the gospel which paul preached and paul said you have many teachers but not many fathers so you can have a father figure someone that preached the message the first time you heard it you've heard it you were born again of the Holy Ghost so Mel Brooks is like a father figure to me well I don't call him Holy Father we come preach for his Holy Father you can you dedicate my children Holy Father can I kiss your feet I never call him father because the Bible says have call no man father but you can look to someone as a father who's preached the Holy Ghost and you got saved and filled the Holy Ghost so when they call the Pope the Holy Father it's a complete robbery of God the father's title in John 17:11 Lydia pulling up there John 17:11 the title Holy Fathers used one time in the Bible and the Roman Catholic Church steals the title from God and gives it to a man how wicked is that its total idolatry Jesus says Holy Father keep through thy no name those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are so the Catholic Church is so arrogant that they take a title that belongs only to God and they give it to the man and you saw Barack Obama could called him Holy Father I don't know if Trump did or not but Barack Obama called him Holy Father that's idolatry that's to me to take a name that belongs to God and give it to a man that's blasphemy because that's God's name Jesus said Holy Father see and so the Catholic Church as a woman takes this false word and she spreads it to this country and now every every every president every tyre says Holy Father Holy Father Holy Father and they're blaspheming the name of Jesus Christ okay number five I'm sorry number five before kissing a Pope's ring or priests and I'm bowing to a pope or priest this is wrong recently it was in the news the Pope someone tried to kiss his ring and you know what he did he turned it away he said because so many people had kissed it that he said their germs were on there and he said it was flu season so he and he got he got he got a bunch of flack for that Oh Holy Father why would you turn your ring away and he's like I don't want you to get sick well if you're so holy how can there be even meat germs there doesn't your holiness burn those germs away see and then the article says they've been kissing his ring and kissing his feet for centuries everybody knows this and it's idolatry it's man worship it's a forerunner to the Anti Christ the Bible teaches do not bow to any man in Exodus 20 verse 5 revelation 19:10 in revelation 22 8 and 9 or never kiss any man's hand according to 2nd Samuel 15 5 do not kiss a man's hand this is man worship and it breaks the first commandment all right let's say into our feet let me close to these last few the fifth one his veneration of statues and images already kind of went over that one the Bible said no make no graven image or likeness that is in heaven or earth in the water and I and Rome is the chief global seat of idolatry spread through the worship of statues and images let me do two more number six the communion of saints the Catholic Church says there is an exchange of spiritual goods through prayers between the disciples currently on earth and those that are in glory so the Catholic Church says you can pray to disciples in heaven and that's called the communion of saints and they're supposed to pray that they may be loosed from their sins but the Bible said Jesus blood already forgives all of our trespasses right now amen so they're praying to people to forgive their sins when the Bible said it's already forgiven the Catechism says that believers should fly to Mary in prayer and request prayer from her but nowhere does the Bible ever teach that this is a form of spiritualism so if they're not contacting Mary if you can't pray to Mary and if you can't pray to disciples and who they contacting they're contacting demons which brother Graham said is the highest form of spiritualism is praying to dead people because you're not you're not contacting dead people you're actually contacting demon powers that are disguising themselves as dead people so yeah it's it's very serious and this is what she's spreading he's spreading this to all these nations these nations the last one this is kind of what we I can come here and start playing the last one is deifying the Virgin Mary let me quote they call Mary the all holy one that's what they call in their book all holy one know only God's holy only Jesus is all holy they say Mary was preserved from all stain of original sin you know that's not true either the Bible said that Mary rejoiced in God my Savior if she was all holy she doesn't need a Savior but she needed a Savior amen hallelujah she rejoices that thank you God you're my Savior I had to be saved for my sins no not true she's not the all Holy One she was not a preserved from the stain of original sin like the Catholic Church says was she forgiven of all of her sins yes by the blood of Jesus that's right when they looked into heaven heaven in Revelation 5 they said who's worthy to loose the seals that Mary come up and say I'm worthy now the virus that no man was found in heaven or earth through the sea or under the seat the woman was found anywhere only Jesus was found there's only one worthy not Mary Jesus Christ the Catholic Church says she has a saving office she's the mother of God Queen over all things advocate help her benefactors and Mediatrix but the bible says in isaiah 40:3 God is the only Savior amen and the Eternal Spirit of God has no mother the Bible says that clearly in Hebrews 7 verse 3 without father without mother ain't had an area my goodness Mary was only the mother to the human body that human body program says and we know the Bible says that human body wasn't iya T it could die it could get tired if you get sick but the sphere that came and gone that body was deity amen and Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and men now do you like that church we got through six of the eleven proofs the next week Lord willing we'll get all the way and children of that helped by God's grace may God write that upon your heart God write it upon your heart amen children you know the Bible said God sent the seventh angel to finish the mystery of God you need to
