take a look at Justin how I saw policing at this morning freeda bloodletting that to the but we can come into his presence through the blood I ez'n save our feet braids got word of God me tonight so I want to minister on this whole thought theses parallel Joshua tonight by the grace of the Lord okay that's into you would let's go to Ephesians we'll start here at Ephesians first are separate for its provisions for Kevin listen to this series in a while of course I recommend all but many sermons and if you're looking for some listen to enjoy this season's for 422 here for mayor I preaches for sermons about the position on the manifestation of sons of God and Ephesians parallels joshua later it was called the adoption series one of the four servants called adoption so we go really like that if you haven't heard at the lab I think I've this is no album now and a real blessing so let's go to Ephesians here on chapter 4 verse 22 okay Bursk Laurie 22 23 and 24 of course with this thought we're looking at a type here we're looking at type of the spiritual believer possessing we say the land which is the holy ghost life life filled with the Holy Ghost so verse 22 chapter 4 now you put off concerning the former conversation the old man chords that woulda been the man in Egypt ray which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which is I'm sorry which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness praise God so a life of a Christian living in the promised land is a life of true holiness and how many want that tonight by God's grace true holiness let me pray one more time father we love you tonight thank you for this reading that I word bless it to ask Lord God thank you for this gathering for the saints that love you and want to such it's so easy to love your people Lord because they have your spirit in them that's those that are here physically those live streaming minister to your body your bride you know you have that Lord God we just ask and pray you continue to minister to us here tonight in Jesus Christ's name every said in a godless she's beat see their praise the Lord praise God so we're thankful the last Sunday night I preached 47 minutes so I said 45 I only met two over so I'm going to try to do that tonight it just saves my voice I really got to do it because when I do something I will do all the way when I want to preach I want to preach with all my emotions you want to preach with all my body on my voice and that's not good for my voice because I lost it and so I just asking God to give me grace and mercy so I had a good week this week you know I voice seemed to come back but I feel like that's wisdom I got to be able to do it by God's grace and so I'm gonna set the timer here just like that okay alright so glory I hope you've been enjoying the services that goes on wednesday night on the Ephesian series here by the grace of the Lord I'm going to be doing a quite a few quotes tonight out of this message of fees which parallels Josh room from 1960 may 18th I think you'll really enjoy it like I was great so I'm just going to kind of build build off of what brother band set and show the types I'm going to close with Caleb which is a real nice beautiful type there of the believer ok so I'm starting with this quote this is his first quote that I pulled out I wanted to share brother man says before even starts preaching he says Oh God Phyllis freshly with thy spirit and with thy love and goodness so I want to start there because on Wednesday night I showed the three parts of a man body soul spirit and so someone who's already sealed in the soul they as far as I can see I can't see in scripture where you can get sealed again in the soul so when brother man is asking us to Phyllis fresh with the Holy Spirit for those who are born to get he's asking for fresh anointing a cleaning out of the mind that's what he's asking for i believe by scripture and for those who aren't filled with the Holy Ghost guests and ladies asking for a seal the Holy Ghost so I want to just prove that by the scripture now our text tonight is verse 20 or 22 23 24 verse 23 is what i read here and be renewed not be renewed means to make new so be renewed we're in the spirit of your mind be renewed in the spirit of your mind so you can be brand new in your mind how to enjoy that by God's grace I love it you know I'll battle depression sometimes I found depression sometimes I matter now you know a different thoughts about different things you know whether it's lust the flesh prior to life and you just get so we're in your mind right but when the Holy Spirit comes it's like you got a new mind and they clear again you know I've gotta confess my sin or confess this whatever long and you renewed in your mind and that's a great blessing in this day because Satan wants to put anxiousness nervousness like we said depression cares of the world he wants to fill your mind with those things but the Bible said your renewed in the spirit of your mind now sister Jean Paul second billions or 16 this is what we're talking on this morning this is we need the victory in our minds that's where we need the victory for our new sealed in the soul and the battle is or the human spirit a mile for which cause we fake not so we don't give up the cause of Christ but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed how often day by day every day Paul said I die immediately right so aware that when you're seeing by the Holy Ghost praise God you've got God willing in your soul you've got the nature of God quickened and made a live in your soul but your mind is where you need renewed every single day that's where we are getting the victory as Christians we must contend for that victory this square brother have said you can back side every day that's in your mind not your soul your soul never backs lines it's sealed the soul cannot sit remember that from verse John a soul a soul cannot sit on a kind of them chalking it up I don't have it in front of me but it just kind of came to me a Christian cannot sin my mam says in your soul because it's sealed it is the friend it's the nature of the Spirit of God but in your human mind is where you backslide daily now i wanna i want to read this quote this is from communion 1965 i'll be that's my man's last last message okay i want to read this here because it basically says we need a fresh experience every day he says well it's the same thing we find in this message we see it's right we see God vindicates it's right it's perfectly right you're out through here you have to hear continues right can use right everything it says happened just exactly the way he said now we know it's right but see don't do it from an intellectual standpoint if you do you got a second hand of religion we don't want a second hand and religion something that somebody else has experienced and we're living off their testimony the Bible says the message we cannot live off of someone else's testimony we got to have our own testimony hey Corey so we got to be renewed like the scripture said in the spirit of our mind every day so in this message let me say like this we don't want to try to live off a brother branham's experiences although we are blessed by that right his experiences can help us so much what if we just rely on what he's experienced and we don't have any experiences ourselves then it's a second handle religion we must know God was like this we must know Christ in the power of his resurrection amen we ourselves must know it the stories of brother branham of guidance encourages to say my if God gave the victory in his experience than God can us the same in victory in our experiences we can experience the same Living God that he experienced amen so that's what I want to get to that I make sure we want to see God for a testimony of our own every day we must be refreshed and have a testimony that we're experiencing presently with the Lord Amen now let me read this quote this is from adoption part 1by that raw but perhaps that i like to say this the book of Ephesians Ephesians perfectly parallels the Old Testament Joshua he said perfectly parallel so the first time I heard about how is that possible how could a new testament book purposely parallel or perfectly parallel a new testament now here's and I looked at my just happy looking Maya Scofield Bible and here's what Scofield says I wonder brother I've got to stop from there it was the Holy Spirit either way seems to be right Scofield says this there is a close spiritual affinity between Ephesians and Joshua the heavenlies answering and Christian position to Canaan in Israel's experience so a Christian who's sitting in heavenly places baptized with the Holy Ghost is the same thing as a Israelite living and kadens late Lori I like that that's what's going on says here in both so in Canaan and also the Christian experience he says there's conflict even failure but also victory rest and possession amen like that okay so now let's get back to a quote from one branch so you set a perfectly parallel that's what Scofield said in both you have struggles which all set victory possession and promises achieve in both of them all right here's what program says next he says the book of Ephesians to my opinion is one of the greatest books of the new testament a we should preach it the prophets that is one of the greatest books of the new testament i think we ought to greet you he's the lower keep we're on down from chapter 2 we're not quite through in chapter 2 we're about the middle chapter 2 and our teaching we know on scripture by scripture one of the greatest books of the new testament but man says now look here now here's the reason why he gets reason the vesians leaves us on where Calvinism runs out on one limb and our mania nism runs out on the other limb so I'm going to miss play these because these are kind of don't remember I'd be hard to read about what they meet a Madison palmas and runs out there armik arminianism runs out there but Ephesians he says draws it together and positionally places the church all right so who knows what Calvinism is Calvinism is salvation through the works of God only God determined to her salvation so Kyle ISM is like hyper predestination it's all god it's all God God three Destiny's everything and so this is where if you run too far on that just sit back and say why should I go to church and already determine what I'm going to be saved or not why should I obey the Bible guys already notice that I'm gonna be saved or not why should I bring it back the Holy Spirit's already here like they say why should I do that now that's hyper-calvinism right that's that's extreme the other side arminianism is salvation through the works of fan right nan determines their salvation so they'll post scripture says choose you this day whom you will serve it right from Joshua or on the pole a revelation 22 where says believe arm server it says the spirit of brides say column whoever's thirsty let them come and drink of the water supply for you and that's a typer and you can go hyper Arminianism where it's too far it's too much on man's free more agency with this size is too much on God running everything and I don't have a choice on this side but they have said Ephesians get brings it together right down the middle of the road amen so there must be a balance Jesus says no man can come to me except the father draw that's true he said you've not chose to me but I chose to you that's true but Peter said your elect according to God's poured out so God elected you because he knew when she would choose and then the revelation 22 whoever's thirsty let him come let him drink choose from JavaScript shooters you this day whom you will serve so we have scriptures on both sides and that's where Ephesians now those the scriptures are not hyper on either one right if their emphasis on it be gets too hyper so all these scriptures on both sides are right out in the middle it's a combination God did give freedom or agency so man must make a choice but already but God already knows what's going to be chosen so because that he could predetermine the event program says that in this series he talks about that in length all right now here's how I see that in the book of a fiend I've already read this book of Ephesians I took notes on every scripture so here's how asians balances it out in chapter 1 the Bible said you are right now in heavenly places so that heavenly places on this calvinism side hi your saw such in heavenly places your way higher other bag your brother Jassi where we're just out there heavenly places my we're so enjoying the things of God it also says in verse for your jokes in Christ before the foundation soil so look at this at all it's on this side of look at God wow we're in God's plan and God has all control over this he does the Bible says in verse 6 of chapter one here accepted the beloved in chapter 5 verse 5 and 11 on chapter one you're predestinated it says twice the Bible says in verse 11 of chapter one you have eternal inheritance these are all spiritual blessings out here on God's side but when you turn to chapter four verse 30 it says grieve not the holy spirit so you're in heavenly places you're ohs in a foundational world you've got inheritance my you all these blessings waiting for you in heaven but then he says but don't grieve don't offend the Holy Ghost and so now we start be able to get out see it's going to take these scriptures he can run but look good who cares to be slow to care if you felt adultery that's going to save you anyway who cares you can live with into you people can take it too far i'm not saying Calvin said that but people can take it too far right I'm already in heavenly places like a live hundra what I can smoke and drink are you up but on this side of the man part God says you must not grieve me don't offend me in other words don't sing god forbid that we would say we saw that earlier today ended up I was sending in Ephesians 5 18 do not be drunk online which leads to pottery but be filled with the spirit so man has a choice what am I going to fill my life with alcohol offenses sins unto God Paul Paul tells us be filled with the spirit Paul says don't grieve the Holy Spirit so now can you see how Jesus is the great balance of this profession where count as it goes too far our maiden goes too far Ephesians balances are right down the middle you have all these or predestinate a plan about all these promises but then you've also got a duty to live right before the Lord amen glory remember systems for the greatest books in the body the new testimony says now if you if you know the divisions Ephesians is divided up perfectly to show us about Israel it's divided the three basically three parts the first chapter chapter 1 to n to the end of the chapter verse 21 is all about the believers position in Christ there in heavenly places the free testing their chose the mind of God now from check from chapter 1 verse 22 all the way through the end of chapter three is a section all about the body of Christ if you read that and it's all about the body of Christ how we were Gentiles and God brought us in we preach on that on Wednesday night you were sins and how you're quick and unto God so the first part is the first part of Ephesians in three parts just like Israel and that Israel came with the promised land into three parts amen the first part is your heavenly position the second part is your position in the body hey how the body of Christ has the same rights and privileges as Israel the third and final part is your walk and service and warfare as a Christian amen sorry it's got six chapters but it's divided into those three thoughts your position heavenly your position the body so position individually fiction as a body of Gentiles in Christ and then your walk service and warfare has to believe we're to God beautiful and how does it how does the book of Ephesians and it ends by talking about the full armor of God you gotta fight but it starts off I say you're in heavenly places you got eternal inheritance you are totally Chrysler Ford Foundation you are so predestinated but then it ends by saying make sure you fight a man stand up to everyone is satan's temptation save NC so it's a perfect balance right down the middle it's not too much on predestination it's not too much on your work it's right down the middle the road amen let me answer the bride would be right down the road I'll Olivia will be too much I'll devotion will be too much on the election ISM should be right down the middle of the road all right thank you Jesus I love these brother calls these nuggets he said I month of these nuggets okay a paragraph 36 adoption partner but he's in fellowship now kayden does not represent the age of the millennium so when Israel took the promised land Lorenzo's I don't represent the millennium he said it only represents the age of the overcomer the dispensation of overcoming because in Hayden they killed and burned and conquered and took cities and there'll be no death in the Millennium what type of alidium Solomon's tired never there was peace rolla not maybe not even 40 years but they had pieces have such a oddest anointing and everything but most glorious time of Israel was the brain of solid years it was like a type of peace but then Davey the promised land was not a type of the millennium because the blending will have no death right no no Wars it's a thousand years of peace so but I said when they take painted it's not the millennium it's actually time of war all right and then if you know the servant brother Ram goes through justification same nation bath as well he goes justification for us was being repenting baptized in water justification for Israel was coming out of Egypt right going through the waters of the Red Sea coming out of Egypt so for sanctification for us is getting our heart and mind ready for holiness getting ready for the Holy Ghost your daily I think uh yeah John Wesley called sanctification cleanliness of heart of mind amen cousin I was his revelation when God we yes we're just fine by faith but now we have telling us a heart a nine-day bad glory and for them that was going through the wilderness following a pillar of fire glory so they filed a thorough fire and God was sanctifying them in the wilderness now the promise and when they cross over Jordan remember how to get circumcised before they cross over Jordan so see let me see like this there's one final act of circumcision before you cross over to that to the Holy Ghost you got any fully circumcised you'll be fully cut off the things of the world yeah fully obey fully surrender the Word of God and then you can cross over to the baptism of the ghost so possessing the Promised Land of Israel was a perfect type of the damn Pentecost glory a baptism of the Holy Ghost they totally crossed over that's her brother BAM peaches paragraph 38 now he asked what is the land promised the New Testament believer but may have said the promise is the Holy Spirit and he goes Joel 228 horror mystery upon all flesh sons and daughters of promise I and they goes acts 2 38 and 39 repent every one of you the name of Jesus Christ to remit to forgive to take away all back trans trespasses all right now look what my dad says next night encodes a scripture from Joshua chapter 3 verse 5 if you got your Bible and Josh her son of the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you so they would not see the wonders of God in their life until they were fully sanctified until they had been circumcised and then they would cross over that was Joshua 35 now brother Ram quotes this in paragraph 39 did you notice Joshua before they cross Jordan Joshua said go through the midst of the camp clean your clothes and sanctify everyone to you and let no man come at his wife with three days you'll see the glory of God see amedisys it's a process of getting ready to inherit the promised amen every promise mean hair is the process praise God we don't we don't want to get our mind like oh we just say one prayer and God is going to God's going to answer our prayer that doesn't happen all the time hardly happens very much God gives us in the process and ready to receive a promise so I like a word process for the better news see it's a process getting ready to inherit the promises and pop three stages again all right Oh dad said there was three stages of the journey and there's three stages of this journey and it goes through the three works of breaks I'm going to move past that because we're familiar with that I got I'm already 25 minutes into it so I got 20 minutes to finish up here so Gloria now here's what I want to get to all right now now he takes him up to Kadesh Barnea which is numbers chapter 13 let's go to the numbers 13 if you got ciabatta numbers chapter 13 now of course this is where people walked away we'd say from going in the promised land boban types us to you know not being born again of the Holy Spirit types it to denominational churches like totem holiness and Nazarene pardon sorry bout that numbers chapter 13 now you the story they go over oh I just seen that in verse 22 and they set it up by the south and came unto Hebron where a high man sheesh I and Tom by the turn of a knock were never on was built seven years before so so in Egypt all right that's the spies ok now the spies come back after 40 days and come back now in verse 26 they show them the fruit of the land they brought back word and now let's go to verse 27 and they told him and said we came under land whither thou sent us us and surely upload with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are long and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there the Amalekites well the land of the South the Hittites in the chubby side slammer I explore the mountains and the canines 12 by the sea by the coast of Jordan but they seen all this trouble in the land they were looking so much and now here's what here's the trouble they looked at the battles more they look at the promise right hey look at the evils and the trials that would be in that land more they look at the promise of God praise the Lord so we learn we can't look at the trials or we can't look at the foes that will face we've got a look at the promise of God matter how big the enemy looks a mess i look at the enemy we must look at the promise of god amen let me say like this that's why some people don't get bored again they're like oh I don't want God to take away my my lust thing right because he said this morning I don't have to give up busting I'll have to give up that I don't wanna have to give up that all your turkey just got to wear different clothes your cheek Church teaches no make up your shirty shins no custance where an old movie guard they don't they can't handle the enemies right they don't want to fight those battles right that's right they don't they just can't take the promise they can't believe they don't enemies look too great they don't want the promise of God they don't believe the promise of God yeah I like this diverse 30 and Caleb still the people before Moses said let us go at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said BP not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we know they're only looking at ourselves they're not even looking at god that's true those men were physically stronger than Israel but that's not what kayla was looking at caleb wasn't going at god's strength and not their own they then and they brought up an evil report on the land which they had searched into the turn of Israel saying the land through which we had gone to search is a land that keys nothing happens they're up and all the people that we saw in it our men and Greg stench now look this is what these people are saying oh that's going to eat us up that's too hard that's too hard but there's two men I say it's not going to eat me up then those foes are not going to eat me up I'm going to eat them up praise God there's only two out of what those two million that said they're not going to eat me up I'm gonna eat them up by the power of God I'm going to drive him out that's the kind of a Christian that we need to date someone who's got the Holy Ghost said I'm not scared of that battle I overcome I more than able God clonus I can possess the land they met brother have said you should see that's where you Israel not yet received the promise they're on their journey he said that's where even a serene cougar holiness fell because Israel when they come to the spot a penas Barney I despise went over and said the land is great but some of them come back said we can't take it because the cities are wall and so forth he said but Joshua and Caleb stood out so we're more than able to take it but because of their creeds they're signed up document statements they only believed in two works of race justification and sanctification and could not move any farther the whole generation Paris in the wilderness that went over in the promise that had brought back the evidence that was it a good Atlantic look over and says in some of the people going on receiving the Holy Spirit speaking with tongues receiving the power of God the baptism of the holy ghost signs wonders and miracles they felt it would break down their tradition of doctrine and what happened they perished in the land by they perish right up at the land but I said they wouldn't go to the signs wonders and miracles speaking in tongues the power of God they didn't want to fight those battles oh my what help us be able to fight those battles praise the Lord he said this is but the believers McAdam and Joshua outfit like that that was going on to the promise they moved on over into the land and took the land and settle down in the land as the possession and we never stopped at justification sanctification let us go on into the baptism of the Holy Spirit let's not stop at believing on the Lord Jesus being baptized let's not stop because he cleaned us up from a life of sin but now we press on into position a promise of the Baptist with the Holy Ghost he says the promise is unto you your children and to the other than are far off even as many as the Lord our God sir paul amen that's why sometimes hurts me gotta fight for pray for people that they'll be healed right that's why we gotta lose meals we got ass and pray we got to be willing to see our loved ones say to praise to God save their souls we're going to agonize in prayer we gotta cry out to god we have to put effort into it we got a lever in order to see these promises come to pass we got to be willing to fight for it amen there's a lot of unbelief up there's a lot of Jeff junkies I unbeliever Emily dwelling in our land right there's like unbelief and temptations and sins and stares dwelling in this land there is I got 18 minutes left so close with these two things here by God's grace let's look at I want to say this year so thought the Canes me so think about all they've been through think about Egypt think about the wilderness and I'll think about crossing over the Jordan River think about that now after you get the Holy Ghost you cross over Jordan how many believe that you cross over Jordan now then this should kind of struck me loans in there playing studying to this afternoon think about that you've gone through all this process all these years all this process if you're Joshua and Caleb and now God brings you back to the land and you've got a funny in front of you ever thought you did you've got all kinds of alien like sinful inhabitants in your land right and you got to drive them out God brought you all this far and he brings you to a sudden you're cross the river and praise God in the promised land I got the Holy Ghost I've made it and but now you find out it's full of aliens it's full of squatters what do you mean this is our promised land at church that's what we find out we get we repent we get baptized in jesus christ enemy of sanctified we sit in church it and go through the sanctifying process we get boarded in the altar or wherever we sprayed or screaming or shouting their token tons or whatever we did and now we're going to go to god what a wonderful land this is and then you realize you've got all this same laying in your mind and in your flesh is that right sit so much so that paul said o wretched man that I am right o wretched man that I am we just thought we got only goes well I is going to be the sweetest thing I'm never going to have a bow it's going to be the most glorious and it instant alerts life but it ain't a cakewalk and ate a picnic right and their whole land was filled with inhabitants right because they said they said anak hey burst many numbers nothing anak he said in verse 28 malachite Hittites Jebusites ever writes King tonight's there's six there's six sets of people's multitudes that we're gonna have to drive out of the land oh we're so happy we're out of Egypt thank God but guess what the war just started and the Lord just started and brother Graham says this is this from the message God doesn't Colome into judgment without first one in him in 1963 july twenty four my dad said you say well if I got baptized the Holy Ghost then maybe the Lord will take me to heaven no not only that he said you're just then getting ready to live you ain't ready to live until you get the Holy Ghost and then when you get the Holy Ghost then you're just fit to live you wasn't fit to live before that seat but now you're just fit to live after you got the Holy go see just getting you ready people say well I got ready to die he said oh boy i'm getting ready to live programs lori the thing of it is getting ready to live live in Christ victorious like over sin death town home and said I already have the victory he's my victory and itís evidence and I've been evidence of his victory hey man glory the people say I probably got all the ghosts I'm ready to die but master that's wrong you're not ready to live but you gotta fight for every inch that your walk off right that's we got told Josh you'll fight for every little bit right so see what's your boarding only ghosts now that shouldn't be enough I got the only ghost praise God but you should want more and a real believer in those days and today they want to find their god-given position I want to find a place where I'm supposed to live in Christ I want to find the blessings of God for my life my family and my church praise the Lord I just have an experience I'm still today reduction praise God but now that I'm in I don't know exactly where I was supposed to live the mounted on social little the valley i'm supposed to live it wherever God's calling me to beat and I'll inherit all the blessings i want to work the land on the work this the gifts that God has placed in my life amen I want to work in the ministry got placed me I want to be a positionally place son or daughter of God I want to dwell rockland supposed to be I'm just to pick out some outlet hike let me kick them out I'm just the kick-out impacts let me kick them out but there they have possession of what I want possession up amen and so see when someone just gets all the ghosts it's impossible for them to be positioning place because the type is what you get positioning place now it's time for war now it's time to fight off all these enemies until you find your place where God is positionally called you to be let me just scroll down just for a moment brother BAM said yeah brother Alan tells us the purpose of preaching these four servants here's what he said is buried r51 now this is my purpose of doing this the church is always trying to take somebody else's quarter but don't do that you can never raise corn and Ephraim's corner if you're Manasseh my pen you've got to take your place in Christ positionally take it remember the glue it gets deep and rich when we get in here I'll that God puts one of the church to speak with tongues what is what i'm getting at your gifts the gifts of your spear in your life right so he's typing when at or after a planning core which I left strap I can check that out I know Asher put his foot in oil i searched that out levan tongs not that he put his foot in oil and with nothing and that's even in the Bible later on generations would have lots of olive oil and oil you know from Asher's try but he says but we've got it gets deep and rich when you find your gift in your life now we've been through this into we talked many times we all have to speak with tongues that's wrong we all got to do it though we do they didn't do all one thing in the promised land each one was positionally placed Gloria now so what's the purpose of preaching these for sermons we call the adoption series so you don't try to take somebody's house position you can find your position in Christ now let me close with this I got 11 minutes here I'm in trying to close I said I i think i need to do i need to have a better sense of self control it's like I said I just pour myself in and I don't think about my body I pray that's the Lord if you bring my voice back I will I will take care of my body better so I'm trying to they're actively do that by God's grace ok let's go to Joshua 14 let's close with its joshua 14 I'm looking Caleb like I told you I want to close with Calum joshua chapter 14 Josh for 14 now charmer six because Elaine get started divided up here in chapter 14 actually starts getting divided in chapter 13 right yes yeah all the tribes of inheritance except Levi their inheritances God amen now chapter chapter 14 verse 6 now this is where God told Josh will start dividing the land so Harbor sick man the children of Judah came unto Joshua yoga and came of a son of Jeff Anna the Kenna's Ike said unto Him thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and v + k dash bar do so there was a promise made by God given to given de que Ella through Moses a promise came through the prophet of God from God amen 40 years old was I when Moses the servant Lord 17 from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in my heart that's so beautiful amen remember caleb was the first one to say we can thank Allah head right he's the first one is it up and said we can take it we can do it it's in my heart God told Moses to tell me I can have the lair and so listen church whatever's in your hearts going to come out of your mouth is that right boy like we said this morning set your heart your affection on things above think all these things if your heart is set on things you'll say the right thing hey man so now we know what's in your heart by what we say forsake nevertheless my brother that went up with me made the heart of the people melt my holy thought of the Lord my God how do you only follow Lord he just repeated with the Prophet said Laurie he just said what brother Raymond said let me said I bet he said what brother very upset as God talk on the brand if God told her mother Branham we can say it exactly right it's going to happen that's how we wholly follow the Lord amen per se I'm sorry already ready for Snyder and Moses world that they say is truly the lantern we're on my feet up tron shall be thine inheritance and I children's forever because now is holy father the Lord by god it's so important what we say and what we do about a promise of God we must confess a promise of God that shows were wholly following the Lord like hikers tent hire in the chaos personal testimony and now behold the Lord of kept me alive as he said he's 40 and five years even since the Lord spake this word of the Moses while the children is were wandered the wilderness and now though I this day four score and five years old now look he kind of separates himself look the Lord cap Nina vibe they all died they were laundry look heah was not longer Union he knew where he was going he really wasn't wondering although he was with them he wasn't wondering because he knew where he was going God promised him will seek God's post in Hebron and they all died because they didn't believe it they didn't believe the Lord with all their hearts he said when I wasn't wondering I knew where I was going I was going to have rod amen they all died but I'm alive yet today because God has kept me alive aren't you here today because God has kept you alive amen first 11 and yet I have a strong this day as I was the day that most is set me that's how I want to be going to be strong this day as the day when God commissioned me to leave the message you've been gone I'd be just as strong today as I was when I started amen as my shrink was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out to come in other words ought to be just a much of a prayer warrior just as much as one who can confess the promise as I was when I first came the message glory now verse well are from one of our favorite verses now therefore give me this mountain where of the Lord spake in that day in other words give me the possession of God Foley Lord you promised in your word now give it to me Josh prevented Josh represent the Holy Spirit right Josh represents the Holy Spirit so we when we printed Holy Spirit dear Lord I'm claiming give me what you promised in your word you promised me my love woman right you promised me to operate the gift or whatever's in my life you promised me this now give it to me all right I believe it let it be manifested operate in my life today's the day let me see it fulfilled in my life amen give it to me says give me this mountain Lord or thou hurt us in the day out aunt Anna Kim's were there and that the cities were great and fenced it so be the Lord will be with me and I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said amen well Kim says listen I didn't have to tear down fences although these are jump offense or tear it down these Amma Kim's are in my land but I'm willing and it's a mountain right I've got to climb a mountain in fact the history of eberron is it's surrounded by mountains where they live in the battling that's why I just right on the dictionary so that he had to climb these dogs look at the look at the value have to climb up over fences on mountain and then go down into the valley in storm glory I'm willing to climb mountains I'm willing to overcome basis in order to inherit what God promised me through the prophets hey beautiful and if God's with me i'll drive out all these leavings all these temptations all these foreigners all these aliens i'll drive them out out of my promised land that's what we student that's what we're doing trying to hear right drive out all the unbelief out of our church drive out all of the unbelief out of the bride right try out all these spirits that work upon these believers and after right we're trying to drive it all out so we can possess the land that God gave us amen sorry that's what we're doing by God's grace 10 years so far we'll keep doing it by the grace of the Lord this is our land amen god commissioned us here praise the Lord and we're driving about one by one under there you and Joshua blessed him so always real bless you Hey look for faith like that and gave unto Caleb the son of jaffna hevron perdon heritance hevron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb who sent up jeffanddana kenza night under this date because that he holy follow the lord god of israel now if you know the story when Joseph would Commission and say he give you the land and it'll fight for it she's basically said you go leave this big revival you leave the big army and you into smaller army and you go possess that land he said I'm giving you that land now go fight for it right so Caleb said I'm ready to fight I'm ready to take what's mine and that's what we should do that's what we are doing right when we pray for people to church we're praying how brother so and so officer so-and-so to possess the land that could call them help them to walk in the minish you call them to dude hope them to live the life are supposed to live and we're supposed to fight as the we'd say the bride of Akron right we're supposed to fight for one another so everybody can take their position so he can manifest Christ in this area amen petron was in Judah in praise so caleb was positioned in praise because God was in his heart Larry Caleb knew he was asking for a fight but he wanted what truly belong to him I don't forget my brother Jim Shumate came and preached that he said people who say Caleb he'll give me my mouth but what he was saying was giving a fight I'm ready to pray through praise God I'm ready to cast down spirits I'm ready to go green correction i'm ready to receive correction i'm ready to fight and battle whatever i must do in order to possess the promises God has for my life in other words this is my land I was ordained to live a victorious adopted positionally place Christian life and I can live this life in Akron Ohio Lord amen I can live this life here I was all to live here I was called to be an overcomer right here again I can drive out whatever I need to in order to possess hevron in order to possess the promised land for my life and if you remember we preach on Abraham Abraham built his first altar to the Lord injustice 1318 he built it in memory which is in what hedron glory so Caleb would say listen I'm going back and I'm going to possess the land of Abraham my father and churches that what we're supposed to do we're supposed to be the seed of Abraham we're supposed to possess the case of our enemies like Abraham possess the gates of his enemy hey man man reading strength so Abraham set up an altar in the strength which was in Hevron memory which is in heaven and head Rob means communion hell are you abraham's first author was in the strength of communion and that's where hard as for our altars that it's in the strength communing with God feasting on his word walking in the word talking pray in the strength of communion I have strengthened communion I have I'm in memory of chevra and caleb was saying either the 12 and the strength of communion I'll kick out all the a mechanic Kim's because I was called to live here i have a seed of Abraham I'll possess the gates of my enemies like Abraham did amen he said this is my purpose lets tame to her feet the church is always trying to take somebody else's corner you've got to take your place in Christ positionally take it right and i just finished 45 minutes praise the lord amen oh it gets deep and rich how God puts one of the church to speak with tongues having taught many times that we all speak with tongues he said no we have to do all the one thing each one was called the land was divvied up and provided by inspiration praise God now let me just shave Sarah few things from my heart I appreciate those who come out on a Sunday night I really do it means a lot to me and tonight I just want to close with a little prayer I want to pray that God will help us and pray for the entire church that we can all find our position the body of Christ in the past I preach on gifts and things like that nice EE that's part of it I simply that's part of it and so the thing to do is pray I think as you know especially as we see you know newcomers coming like whether a man and practices brother Benjamin different ones like that we can see how we're trying to get them if they're not born again we can see how we're trying to get them to a closer walk with the lower and we can look around each other and see mine can see Loras is truly positioned administered by the Holy Spirit on the piano can we see that by God's grace for sisters its gifts in their lives sometimes it's just of course it's gifts the spirit sometimes it's mothering I'm absent mother bad bass club and brother branham I was just a mother I never preach the gospel brother man said you did exactly what you're supposed to do because you do that you said there's a place for you over yonder and that's my burden as a pastor I want to see everybody in the church kick out all the inhabitants on their land right all the city of the leap out and people possess positions in the body I thought was interesting sister Karen came to me a few months ago that Jeff's we got that extra room in the in the room there is room in that front pasture study she said perhaps it could be a place of prayer before service about hallelujah that would be a position in the body of the church right to pray for the service to intercede for the surface like yesterday i'm here at the altar come here two to three times this is my prayer time to pray for the services today that's my position preach the word that's my position repeat the word of God probably there's there some in here tonight or there's someone here in our church this morning how do you believe there's people that need to find a position I believe that is when you truly find your positions after you get the Holy Ghost as you break through all the health of wilderness after you cross over Jordan now let's take our position let's find where's my position in the body of Christ what am I what was I born to do like my medicine somebody i was born in the natural to raise corn I was born to put my feet in the oil like a she would say actually means happy right happy he's got his footing oil of course he'd be happy in his footing zone right that's he was going to do that but I really have a burden I just want to see people let me tell you I want to see people burden to find that position so when they come to church it's important that they come to church they're here to minister I will get me wrong you're here to receive from God of course but how about ministering to the Lord how about ministering to others that's such an important thing the Bible said when you pray and fast you minister unto God we need people like that that are called of God to minister perhaps into that room perhaps us up here at the altar I don't know we need people that know their position know what they're called to do Hollywood agree to that by God I believe that follow my heart into something as a patch I want to keep continually reminding the people the rapture won't come until what everybody's in their position everybody's got other name on the book recognize the name on the book and find their position of the body of Christ amen if we can just bow our heads for a moment let's just pray for everybody in the church of course if you desire personal prayer we can do that I really want to spend a few minutes here like I said I stopped right at 45 minutes I've talked for about three and four minutes now well if we're bored together the Holy Ghost we're finally ready to live highland we're ready to live but now let's find our position let's fight what would we call to do on this earth and do it with all of our hearts little by little we'll drive out to having service after service it's supposed to be more clear God as opposed to or if we take his word his word will show us more of the inhabitants we got to try about that we can fully serve God in the position that he's called us with you let's pray how many father Lord I know I'd enough Egypt years ago the hotel brother Benjamin this week I started crying I remember when I came back from that athletes in action conference I took all my Snoop Dogg of Metallica and all kinds of country music and I opened that trash can up and I dumped it all it i just got all the pictures off the wall i stumped him in the trash can i still remember doing it on a sunday night after we got back from the weekends curses I remember when I left Egypt I remember when brother Brooks baptized me in the in the winter of 2002 I

promised land who would've thought I left age if I've got to the workers and now I'm in the promised land Laura de I honestly could look back and see with tears to my eyes I can look back and see how you helped me drive out and have it inside of my life thoughts that inhabited by my mind have been trimming out scared to start a church my lord you allowed us to do it you push this past the fear

little we take possession this land or does Caleb said give me this mount I'm ready to fight I'm ready to drive out the inhabitants I'm ready to find my little parcel glamour I can plant my crops I can have my own home I can keep my family in the promises of God in the will of god lord what a beautiful type this is your promise and it's a perfect parallel to the life of a Christian the Prophet says one of the greatest books of the New Testament where it gives us all the predestinated promises our position heavily places we got it puts the responsibility always be filled the spirit do not read the Spirit of God if you're going to keep this clan you must keep out all the inhabitants Lawrence I'll pray for myself I trust to be more train honking hearted I'll be able to push out it more

their lives as they keep the word father bless all the states here tonight those in our livestream bless them help them to find their position I pray for everyone the church Lord okay for the whole

positions whether it's gifts or positions and families we've all got some gift we've all got stub burdensome ministry upon our hardest baby it's prayer faster maybe it's music we've all got gifts of the Spirit Lord the Lord will be like Caleb I know you're going to give me what you promised me help me to possess help me to follow the leadership of Joshua the Holy Ghost is this out Gordon seems
