[22:23] let's take our Bibles that stand here I
[22:25] like to go to let's go to Hebrews five I
[22:28] kind of left off there a couple weeks
[22:29] ago let's look at this thought on
[22:31] hearing and I won't need to
[22:35] I don't need to slide still later on
[22:37] Malachi so I'm not we'll just do the
[22:39] scriptures for now and I don't I don't I
[22:42] don't have a slideshow for this one
[22:43] didn't have time to prepare that so I
[22:45] want to go tea brews Chapter five this
[22:49] is like part four of the worship series
[22:51] I just did a little small series here on
[22:53] worship at least right now Hebrews
[22:56] chapter five and just update their on
[22:59] the voting we got fourteen people to
[23:02] vote to didn't turn them in today and
[23:05] then there's three there so we have five
[23:07] voting or voters left here by God's
[23:10] grace so those are due by next Sunday so
[23:12] hopefully we'll be able to nonce the
[23:15] results there by God's grace next I
[23:18] won't be here but I guess we have to
[23:20] have an announce it may be next Sunday
[23:22] well I'll talk to you better about that
[23:23] by God's grace they're just new next
[23:25] Sunday then we'll have to tally them up
[23:27] I'll leave my office so you can tell him
[23:30] up if you need to you brother by God's
[23:31] grace we'll talk about that he Hebrews
[23:35] chapter 5 here Hebrews chapter five
[23:40] yes verse eleven verse eleven Hebrews
[23:45] 5:11 like look at da love hearing
[23:47] tonight and we want to be able to be
[23:50] people that can hear the word of God but
[23:54] I want to just show the scriptures about
[23:56] hearing because Jesus mentions it
[23:58] numerous times Paul mentions it here
[24:01] this was the spirit that was on the
[24:03] pharisees sadducees anyone that rejected
[24:05] christ in his date this was what was on
[24:07] them they heard all of it but they
[24:09] didn't hear it so that natural hearing
[24:11] were not spiritual hearing so I want to
[24:13] show through the scripture here the lack
[24:16] of the ability to hear the word of God
[24:19] and then we can thank God at the
[24:21] and I'll show you some some interesting
[24:23] things here are some really good things
[24:24] at the end about how blessed we should
[24:27] feel because we can hear the word of God
[24:29] thank God for that
[24:30] amen Hebrews five verse 11 of whom we
[24:34] have many things to say and hard to be
[24:35] uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing I
[24:38] was talking to Hebrew Christians I'm not
[24:40] sure where we're not told where this
[24:42] letter was sent to but it's Hebrew
[24:44] Christians and they were already dull of
[24:47] hearing for when for the time ye ought
[24:51] to be teachers I'm sorry this might be -
[24:56] you have need that one teach you again
[24:59] which be the first principles of the
[25:01] Oracles of God and are become as such as
[25:04] have need of milk and not of strong meat
[25:09] for everyone that uses milk is
[25:11] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[25:13] for he is a babe but strong meat
[25:17] belongeth to them that are of full age
[25:19] even those who by reason of use have
[25:22] their senses exercised to discern both
[25:25] good and evil amen
[25:28] let's just have one more word of Prayer
[25:29] as we approach the word haven't father
[25:31] we're thankful for this word father we
[25:34] want to be those that are in our
[25:36] position we want to be those that can
[25:37] hear the Word of God that can teach
[25:39] others so help us Lord to have ears that
[25:43] hear father and Lord I know we're
[25:45] looking at the the the one slice the one
[25:48] side of the slice tonight but Lord we'll
[25:50] end by looking at Lord the other side
[25:52] which we're grateful to be on that side
[25:54] father help us Lord Jesus to rightly
[25:57] divide your word I'm trusting all my
[25:59] trust is in you lord I need you this
[26:00] hour that people need you or as we said
[26:03] this morning help us remember our moral
[26:05] littleness Lord God a little we are how
[26:08] how quickly we can make a mistake if
[26:10] we're not spiritually on guard at every
[26:12] moment help us Lord and we'll give all
[26:14] the glory to you Lord for the vocation
[26:16] you've given us in Jesus Christ's name
[26:19] never said Amen god bless she's being
[26:21] seated praise God
[26:31] and just so you know I think the
[26:33] livestream I think Malachi told me I
[26:34] messed it up this morning so it was on
[26:36] my it was on my regular YouTube account
[26:39] and not the church YouTube so if you
[26:41] want to go back and listen this
[26:42] morning's message they have to go on my
[26:45] personal account I put it on the wrong
[26:47] account so I don't know if that impacts
[26:49] anybody but I know people that might be
[26:51] live-streaming tonight if they wanted to
[26:54] hear this morning's message they have to
[26:56] go on my personal YouTube account just
[26:59] so just a small detail there I just want
[27:02] to share that by God's grace okay so
[27:04] let's start here write in Hebrews 5 and
[27:08] I want to take all this I want to take
[27:09] most of time and show the scriptures of
[27:11] how all the scriptures about dull of
[27:14] hearing and then I want to close by
[27:16] showing how Jesus told us that we can
[27:20] hear the word of God so I want to start
[27:22] with that and I think it would be a real
[27:24] blessing to yell I got a lot of good
[27:25] quotes here and I think you'll like that
[27:28] it could be encouraged here okay so
[27:30] Hebrews 10 I'm sorry he was 5:11 pardon
[27:33] me now we start off here now in verse 11
[27:38] here Paul says he has more to say about
[27:41] Melchizedek because look at verse 10
[27:43] called of God and high priest after the
[27:45] order of Melchizedek and then he says in
[27:48] verse 11 we have of whom we have many
[27:50] things to say and are hard to be uttered
[27:53] seeing you're dull of hearing so Paul
[27:57] said he'd like to tell them more about
[27:58] Melchizedek but they're not ready for
[28:01] they're not ready for the teaching on
[28:02] Melchizedek and isn't it striking that
[28:04] brother Branham came in 1965 right
[28:06] before he goes off the scene in February
[28:09] of 65 and he preaches who is this
[28:12] Melchizedek amen he said there's two
[28:15] schools of thought most people think he
[28:16] was either made up or he was the actual
[28:19] real priests you know just like a
[28:20] regular man priests but the Prophet goes
[28:22] back to the scripture and shows that he
[28:24] was without mother without father
[28:26] without beginning of days without ending
[28:28] of life showing us that it was God
[28:30] Himself God in a body was Melchizedek
[28:34] amen so but they did this church
[28:37] couldn't handle that because they were
[28:40] dull of hearing now the
[28:41] dull means sluggish slow dull so a slow
[28:48] to understanding of course the ear means
[28:50] understanding spiritually you hear it
[28:52] with a natural ear but understanding it
[28:55] spiritually they were slow to understand
[28:57] what he was what Paul was actually
[28:59] saying and now here's another indicator
[29:02] we ended a couple weeks ago a couple
[29:04] Sundays ago ended with this thought
[29:06] verse 12 for when I'm sorry for when for
[29:10] the time ye ought to be teachers you
[29:13] have need that one teach you again which
[29:15] be the first principles of the Oracles
[29:18] of God let me finish that scripture and
[29:23] our become such as have need of milk and
[29:25] not of strong meat
[29:27] now the word unskillful means
[29:33] inexperienced in teaching the Word of
[29:34] God so the the believers these Hebrew
[29:38] believers were inexperienced with
[29:39] teaching God's Word they couldn't teach
[29:41] it in a deep way they could only teach
[29:44] it in a very simple way they'd have much
[29:45] experience to teach the Word of God now
[29:49] the meat let's go to verse 14 but first
[29:52] but strong meat belongeth to them that
[29:54] are full age now meat means nourishment
[29:56] or food in the Greek so strong
[30:00] nourishment or strong word word it's got
[30:03] some real nourishment to us belongs to
[30:07] them that are a full age even those by
[30:10] who by who by reason of use have their
[30:13] senses exercised to discern good and
[30:17] evil okay now use means habit or
[30:20] practice so those who can handle the
[30:22] strong meat of the word have habits to
[30:29] exer stand or perceive right and wrong
[30:32] amen
[30:33] so in other words mature Christians have
[30:36] such strong senses they can sense evil
[30:39] and they can sense good like I said this
[30:42] morning like when that person said oh
[30:43] the greatest privilege of my life was to
[30:45] meet brother Branham I had a sense I had
[30:47] a strong sense I had their strong sense
[30:50] that's not right that's wrong to exalt
[30:53] brother Branham to the same place as
[30:55] god that's wrong that's idolatry
[30:57] remember idolatry means your name gets
[30:59] removed off the book of life I remember
[31:01] that we were preach on that in the
[31:03] Sardis Church age oh we need to we need
[31:05] to have a spiritual exercise going on
[31:07] tonight praise God that we can exercise
[31:09] and be full mature Christians to be able
[31:12] to pick up on things that are right and
[31:14] pick up on things that are wrong
[31:16] okay now the elementary principles are
[31:22] in chapter 6 verses 1 to 3 so let's go
[31:24] read that Hebrews 6 1 2 3 and and I
[31:28] think as we just look at these briefly
[31:30] you'll see this is what Paul saying Paul
[31:32] saying you have any move past the six
[31:36] elementary foundational principles he
[31:40] said so how can we go into other things
[31:42] deeper things more mature things you
[31:46] have to have these six things first and
[31:48] then you can go in to deeper things and
[31:51] let's see I think I think number one I
[31:52] think the first one is the most
[31:53] important one I think you all agree as
[31:55] we look at this let's look at verse 1
[31:58] chapter 6 therefore leaving the
[32:01] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[32:03] us go on unto perfection not laying
[32:07] again the foundation of here's the four
[32:10] very first one repentance from dead
[32:13] works that's the first one second one
[32:16] faith toward God verse two of the
[32:21] doctrine of baptisms that's number three
[32:25] okay in verse two and verse two and of
[32:27] laying out of hands that's number four
[32:29] laying on of hands number five the
[32:32] resurrection of the Dead which of course
[32:34] we knows there's two resurrections
[32:35] rapture and the second resurrection two
[32:38] white throne judgment and number six
[32:41] which is in verse three I'm sorry number
[32:43] six is in verse two and of eternal
[32:46] judgment now notice eternal judgment it
[32:49] didn't say eternal fire right or eternal
[32:52] burning it didn't say eternal burning
[32:55] because you can't burn eternally without
[32:57] eternal life so see the Bible is
[33:00] perfectly accurate we have to make sure
[33:02] we say just what it says so did you
[33:06] catch that six things now look just let
[33:08] look at the first one a little bit the
[33:11] very first foundational principle for
[33:14] someone who's going to be a beginner
[33:15] babe in Christ is to learn how to repent
[33:18] from their dead works okay now think
[33:22] about that a moment people that fall
[33:24] away for the message or people that fall
[33:26] away from Christ what happened was they
[33:29] never repented in the first place right
[33:31] they never like they could be baptized
[33:33] in Jesus Christ's name acts 2:38 but if
[33:36] they never repented and really died to
[33:39] their love of sin they're gonna be like
[33:41] a pig that goes back to the Waller right
[33:44] they're gonna be a dog that goes back to
[33:46] its vomit because they never repented
[33:49] they never died for to the love of sin
[33:52] and so the very first one at lists is
[33:55] the one most people never get past which
[33:58] is a genuine repentance amen we see a
[34:01] genuine repentance is a full death to
[34:04] self it's fully selling out to taking up
[34:07] a cross and following him daily and see
[34:10] that's where most people fall they they
[34:13] never even get to first base with God
[34:15] we'd say they never get to this first
[34:17] foundational principle of repenting from
[34:20] their dead works how do you know brother
[34:21] Jess because they go back and do the
[34:23] same works they used to do right they go
[34:25] back to the same thing and that's why so
[34:27] it's so important to get people just to
[34:30] repent of their initial dead works
[34:33] because they can't go on to perfection
[34:34] which would be the baptism of the Holy
[34:36] Ghost completion they can't even go on
[34:38] to that until they get these six things
[34:41] first okay so see that that's why that's
[34:44] why repentance is so crucial because
[34:46] it's the very foundation of becoming a
[34:48] Christian you have to feel sorry for
[34:51] your work have to be like like Zacchaeus
[34:53] and say if I send I'll make it right
[34:56] with anybody I know if I stole I'll give
[34:58] you four times more than what I stole
[34:59] that's a real sincere heart amen willing
[35:02] to make up and and try to make all their
[35:04] wrongs try to right amen now second
[35:08] thing faith towards God so you have to
[35:09] have a revelation towards God do they
[35:11] have like brother Branham said they have
[35:13] an intellectual conception or
[35:15] commandment like Cain or I know I've got
[35:16] a sacrifice I guess I'll just bring
[35:18] fruit did they have an intellectual
[35:20] conception or do they have a revelation
[35:22] of what
[35:23] glory like Abel had he had a revelation
[35:25] of God's will amen
[35:28] third thing baptisms noticed baptisms
[35:31] there's multiple baptisms there's a
[35:32] water baptism which brother branham says
[35:34] is for fellowship and then there's a
[35:37] spirit baptism which is for the Holy
[35:39] Ghost okay so they have to understand
[35:41] that they have to understand that
[35:43] there's two baptisms the water and
[35:45] spirit now the fourth one is laying on
[35:48] of hands see divine healing is in the
[35:49] foundation divine healing is a
[35:51] foundational doctrine that we have to
[35:53] know it that we need to know that if
[35:55] someone's sick you can lay hands on the
[35:57] sick and they shall recover if not God's
[36:00] got a reason for or this person's in sin
[36:02] or both people are in sin but God has a
[36:04] reason for we need to know that God
[36:06] wants us to lay hands on the sick they
[36:08] shall recover because that's one of the
[36:11] signs go you therefore and these signs
[36:13] shall follow them that believe number
[36:16] five the resurrection of the Dead they
[36:17] have to know that that everybody who
[36:19] lives is going to have to be resurrected
[36:20] they have to meet their maker amen
[36:23] God is going to resurrect Adolf Hitler
[36:24] God's got resurrect you name it any man
[36:27] who gets died any woman that's died
[36:29] Cleopatra Julius Caesar God's gonna
[36:31] resurrect all them and they have to
[36:33] answer for the deeds they've done this
[36:34] flesh and then six if like we said
[36:37] eternal judgment the judgment against
[36:39] Judas will last eternally everybody
[36:41] understand that but he will not burn
[36:43] eternally that judgment God's decision
[36:46] you're a son of perdition you're
[36:48] separated from my presence that judgment
[36:50] will last eternally but he himself will
[36:52] cease to exist at some point because he
[36:55] doesn't have eternal life
[36:56] remember eternal means you never had a
[36:58] beginning never had an ending if hell
[37:01] had a beginning it has to have an ending
[37:03] amen it has to because it had a
[37:06] beginning oh that's why you and I if we
[37:09] have eternal life the Holy Spirit showed
[37:10] we were in the mind of God already and
[37:12] when God shares that life with us and
[37:14] that life is housing a brand-new body
[37:16] and eternal body then we live eternally
[37:19] amen
[37:20] that's the grass the promise of the
[37:22] gospel what a promise we have glory now
[37:26] does that help this is helped by God's
[37:27] grace these Christians were dull of
[37:30] hearing they should have been teaching
[37:33] deeper things of God but Paul said we
[37:35] need to go back and teach
[37:36] repentance all over again we got to go
[37:39] teach you the two baptisms again we've
[37:41] got to teach you a leg on of hands we
[37:43] have teaches these things all over again
[37:44] because they got slow to here they
[37:47] couldn't understand who is this
[37:48] Melchizedek imagine that they couldn't
[37:51] understand marriage and divorce they
[37:53] couldn't understand these deeper
[37:54] mysteries because they just got tired of
[37:57] hearing slow to understand all right now
[38:01] that's the first one on the dole of
[38:02] hearing let me read you a quote and go
[38:06] to Hebrews chapter 10 where brother
[38:08] Branham talks about me preaching join
[38:11] here what brother Graham said was me
[38:12] preaching it's in Hebrews chapter 10
[38:14] brother Graham calls this meat preaching
[38:16] I got the quote for you
[38:19] it's from the CEO of the Christ 1955
[38:21] that's look at some meat preaching all
[38:27] right and I believe it's verse I believe
[38:29] it's verse 29 so just go to 29
[38:31] oh no it's verse 26 yeah 26 which I
[38:35] think 26 27 28 29 all go together here
[38:39] let's look at this quote here yeah he
[38:45] calls this strong me he calls Hebrews 10
[38:47] strong meat and he starts with verse 26
[38:51] now let's read verse 26 so we kind of
[38:53] get the idea what he's talking about for
[38:56] if we sin willfully after that we've
[38:59] received the knowledge of the truth
[39:01] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[39:04] sin the RAM said that is me preaching
[39:10] amen look but look at 27 but a certain
[39:14] fearful looking for the judgment and
[39:16] fiery indignation which shall devour the
[39:19] adversaries he that despised Moses law
[39:21] died without mercy under two or three
[39:22] witnesses now look at verse 29 of how
[39:25] much sorer punishment suppose ye shall
[39:27] he be thought worthy who hath trodden
[39:29] under foot the Son of God and hath
[39:32] counted the blood of the Covenant
[39:33] wherewith he was sanctified an unholy
[39:35] thing and hath done despite unto the
[39:38] spirit of grace amen
[39:40] what are we talking about we're talking
[39:42] about this twelve twelve spies eleven of
[39:45] them taste of the promised land 12 of
[39:48] them tasted right and then
[39:49] ten of them came back and said we can't
[39:51] do it we're talking about Judas who went
[39:54] into the promised land and got the
[39:56] anointing of the Holy Spirit but then
[39:58] and sold it out and went to hell right
[40:01] that's me preaching according to our
[40:04] prophet I'm glad we preached it here
[40:05] amen that's why many times Church I've
[40:07] got a labor down on the the difference
[40:09] between the wise virgin the foolish
[40:11] virgin I've got a major on that hammer
[40:13] on that why what's drawing me to do that
[40:16] the Holy Spirit is because the Prophet
[40:18] said this is spiritual meat amen
[40:21] so that we really examine our lives and
[40:23] we really can examine ourselves and see
[40:25] are we in the faith or are we not see
[40:28] because the real Christian wants to know
[40:29] a real Christian has that tension I want
[40:32] to be right I want to be I want to go in
[40:34] the rapture I don't want to play Church
[40:36] I want to serve God amen they got that
[40:39] tension am i pleasing to God where's
[40:42] some people just come to church our
[40:43] church any church and they're just going
[40:45] through the motions they're not coming
[40:47] to hear and so what happens their ears
[40:49] get dull of hearing they can't after a
[40:51] while just don't want to understand and
[40:53] don't care to understand because if they
[40:56] didn't know if they want to understand
[40:57] they come ask me or they come ask cam or
[40:59] Simon or brother Cragar brother Brooks
[41:01] whoever's here they come to ask us if
[41:03] they wanted to know right now let me
[41:07] read the quote this is like I said the
[41:08] seal of the Christ Jesus said whosoever
[41:10] speak of the word against the Holy
[41:11] Spirit has no forgiveness in this world
[41:13] or the world to come in other words you
[41:15] Pharisees the Holy Spirit is in the
[41:16] world now so it's loose to every
[41:18] believer so you'll be forgiven of it but
[41:21] one day that Holy Spirit's are coming
[41:23] and then let that generation say
[41:25] something against it and call the very
[41:26] same works of the devil they'll never be
[41:28] forgiven in this world or the world to
[41:31] come all right he said there it is Paul
[41:34] picks it up over in Hebrews 10 listen
[41:36] here I like this he said if we just
[41:39] believe or sin and what is sin but
[41:40] unbelief he that believeth not is
[41:43] condemned already if we just believe
[41:45] wilfully after we've received a
[41:47] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[41:49] no more sacrifice for sin but a fearful
[41:51] looking to the judgment the fiery
[41:53] indignation which shall devour the
[41:55] adversary so Paul saying if you sin
[41:57] wilfully you are looking at the fires of
[42:00] hell the burning fires of the lake
[42:03] fire if you know the truth but then you
[42:06] still live contrary to it you're getting
[42:07] very close to burning in the lake of
[42:09] fire and brother Ram says this is me
[42:12] preaching he says it next he said awful
[42:14] strong isn't it
[42:16] but that's what we need hey man
[42:21] hallelujah that's what we need we need
[42:23] strong si we need meat preaching right
[42:26] we got to get down to really are people
[42:28] really receiving the Word of God are
[42:30] they really were shipping God or not he
[42:34] said if we have served the Lord you
[42:36] Christians all these years it's time we
[42:39] are getting off a milk diet hallelujah
[42:44] time we were able to eat some strong
[42:47] meat he says glory the strong meat is
[42:50] here for us and the Holy Spirit will
[42:53] feed it to us if we'll only open up and
[42:56] let him do it
[42:57] we have said now to reject the truth
[43:00] when it's presented then your ears are
[43:01] sealed like the all right from the Old
[43:04] Testament that slave does who want to go
[43:07] free he goes that gets down to the altar
[43:09] or go down the temple and he gets that
[43:11] earring in his ear he said you'll turn
[43:15] away from God but be very religious like
[43:17] Simon preached last Sunday night the
[43:18] east gate remember Cain moved to the
[43:20] eastern gate eat the eastern side of the
[43:22] Garden of Eden
[43:23] so eastern gate represents where God's
[43:25] people are but Satan goes there to try
[43:28] to copy God's people he's very religious
[43:31] but man said the scripture said heady
[43:33] highminded lovers of pleasures more than
[43:34] lovers of God true spray per drape I'm
[43:37] sorry trucebreakers false accusers
[43:39] incontinent despised are good having a
[43:42] form of godliness he said all the forms
[43:44] very fundamental the forms of godliness
[43:47] but denying of from such turn away amen
[43:51] so that my friends is me preaching if
[43:55] someone hears the word and sends
[43:58] willfully there only remains fire and
[44:01] judgment for them and they trodden under
[44:04] foot the Son of God they do despite they
[44:06] do out visit what the Bible says rather
[44:09] than what the Bible says he said that's
[44:11] what we need we need me preaching amen
[44:14] all right hope that was a help by God's
[44:16] grace
[44:17] I got a couple more quotes on this here
[44:21] where brother man talks about texts that
[44:23] are me preaching okay here's another one
[44:29] how many ever heard the message trying
[44:31] to God a service without doing his will
[44:33] brother random said that's me preaching
[44:35] so let me read that to you you ought to
[44:37] be encouraged if you're feasting on that
[44:39] you ought to be encouraged I can eat on
[44:41] the meat of the word because why church
[44:43] because he was a genuine child of God
[44:46] David was but he got too emotional right
[44:50] he got emotional he tried to bring the
[44:52] Word of God to pass without staying with
[44:54] the word and the same thing had happened
[44:56] to us we is so enthusiastic we can get
[44:58] so excited if we're not careful we have
[45:00] to make that to examine everything we do
[45:02] by the Word of God that's me preaching
[45:06] right because what to do it caused a man
[45:09] to die Uzziah
[45:10] it caused Uzziah he reached out and
[45:13] tried to grab a hold of that cart and to
[45:15] study the car and brother branham said
[45:16] he did it with a kind heart
[45:18] he cut he tries to study the cart but
[45:21] because he broke the word God said you
[45:23] can't break my word and the innocent man
[45:26] died right there because a man David
[45:28] didn't examine the word first
[45:30] that's my glad we can look at the word
[45:32] first amen we should hear the preaching
[45:34] first look at the word read the Bible do
[45:36] that first then make your decision after
[45:38] you've made sure everything lines up
[45:40] with the word of God Amen all right now
[45:44] Bourbon says this and trying to got a
[45:45] service November 27th 65 he said David
[45:50] never consulted it in the day I'm sorry
[45:52] Saul never consulted it in his day
[45:54] because saw back slid so they never
[45:56] consulted the Ark at all the Covenant in
[45:58] the days of saw because he backs it and
[45:59] got away from God so David quickly with
[46:01] inspiration I noticed it's a very
[46:03] treacherous text if you don't get it
[46:06] right and I feel that the hour is coming
[46:08] where we should be men instead of babies
[46:10] uh-huh we should have strong meat
[46:12] instead of milk hallelujah praise God we
[46:18] can hear preaching like trying to do God
[46:19] a service which I preached two years ago
[46:21] in 2015 when we can handle strong
[46:24] preaching like that then we know we're
[46:26] feasting on the Word of God
[46:27] so see what we're saying strong
[46:29] preaching is
[46:31] really getting down deeper and seeing
[46:32] who is really obeying and who's not
[46:34] who's examined their lives by the word
[46:37] and who's not living the word I want to
[46:38] be one that examines my life and obeys
[46:41] all the word because that is the meat of
[46:43] the word being able to discern is this
[46:45] the Word of God or is this a false
[46:47] spirit being able to discern that's what
[46:50] we need in this hour the Prophet said
[46:52] all right here's another example brother
[46:59] Brad Marie's Hebrews five about milk and
[47:03] meat and then he says this he I'll quote
[47:06] him exactly this is from Hebrews chapter
[47:08] five and six part one
[47:11] from 1957 he says if you give a baby
[47:14] strong me you kill it that's the reason
[47:17] so many people say I don't believe that
[47:19] and walk away they're still babies they
[47:22] can't they just can't understand they
[47:24] can't grasp the truth that kills them he
[47:26] said great mighty things the church
[47:28] should know today but you can't teach it
[47:30] they they stumble over it they don't
[47:33] know what to do amen
[47:37] hallelujah now let me keep going I think
[47:40] there's a more quote to this he said
[47:42] Paul speaking the Hebrew group he says
[47:44] but the deep spiritual mystery the
[47:46] church is still blinded to it he said
[47:48] when you ought to be teachers you're
[47:50] still a babe and I know now look what he
[47:53] look what he brings us to he brings it
[47:55] to church attendance about being a
[47:57] mature Christian he said oh I know
[48:00] there's many that rise up and say oh I
[48:01] don't need to go to church anymore
[48:02] praise God the Holy Ghost has come he's
[48:05] the teacher and brother have said when
[48:07] you get that idea you're just wrong for
[48:09] why did the Holy Spirit set teachers in
[48:11] the church is if he was going to be the
[48:13] teacher see first apostles past prophets
[48:16] pastors evangelists and teachers the
[48:19] Holy Spirit sets in the church so that
[48:21] he can teach through that teacher all
[48:24] right and then he says strong me belong
[48:28] attended a full age he said know what's
[48:30] right and what's wrong
[48:31] by the discernment amen so our Christian
[48:35] discernment remember discernment is
[48:36] being able to judge we must judge is
[48:39] this the right attitude is this the
[48:40] right doctrine is this the right move is
[48:43] this the right approach that's what
[48:44] being a
[48:45] mature Christian is discerning right
[48:47] from wrong hey man hallelujah brother
[48:53] Graham says this now this is my last one
[48:56] he's praying and says Oh our Heavenly
[48:58] Father God there's many wait were
[49:02] children straying from God they've never
[49:05] been able to rise above just a little
[49:06] Church joining somewhere yet they love
[49:08] you now look he compares it to the army
[49:11] we have a veteran brother Adam in here
[49:12] he said in the great army there'll
[49:14] always be a private if they keep the way
[49:16] they are now but they're in the army but
[49:19] oh god what's the reward we want to be
[49:21] majors and Generals he said as Paul said
[49:25] when you ought to be teachers you need
[49:27] someone to teach you Father we pray
[49:31] tonight you'll bless each one of them
[49:32] bring them up the ladder just a little
[49:34] higher tonight give them some sort of a
[49:37] new experience tonight that they'll know
[49:40] you've blessed them I like that thought
[49:43] that's a good thought when you say God
[49:45] take me up the ladder give him give me
[49:47] an experience where I can go from being
[49:49] younger in Christ so I can feel like I'm
[49:52] more mature in Christ maybe I feel young
[49:55] in Christ God give me an experience
[49:57] where I can go a little higher I don't
[49:58] want to be a babe I want to be more
[50:00] mature in Christ so the prophets said we
[50:03] don't have to you always don't want to
[50:04] be a private we got to come up the
[50:05] ladder well then what does it take to go
[50:07] up the ladder does it take tests
[50:09] promotions ok fitness I've got to stay
[50:15] spiritually exercise for emotions who
[50:18] promote you is it like the other higher
[50:20] ranks okay I like that
[50:22] amen the Bible said pastors right the
[50:26] presbytery the leaders will lay hands on
[50:28] promote right the presbyterian lay hands
[50:30] and odain gifts and the churches I like
[50:32] that so you got to be faithful you got
[50:35] to work hard amen you got to stay in the
[50:37] faith I like that by God's grace
[50:39] wonderful ok that's the first thought
[50:43] there let me go to the next thought here
[50:47] now I wrote down when I got here I got I
[50:52] got three more or sorry three portions
[50:55] of scripture about the dangers of dull
[50:57] hearing I got three more
[50:59] the first danger of not hearing the Word
[51:01] of God is what we already read in
[51:03] Hebrews five you should have been a
[51:06] teacher you should have been up the road
[51:08] but you're not there that's the first
[51:10] that's the first danger of having a dull
[51:13] hearing and now church that's something
[51:15] you and I that that was something that
[51:17] God would have to show us individually
[51:19] like I should be higher in God but I'm
[51:21] not I don't want to make people feel bad
[51:24] it's between you and God I'm not the one
[51:25] I don't want to feel bad but we have to
[51:27] see God and we have to find out are we
[51:29] where we need to be with God or should
[51:31] we be higher if we feel like God has
[51:34] revealed we should have we should be
[51:36] more than a private we should be more
[51:38] than just this mall rank then we need to
[51:40] go to God and say God forgive me I've
[51:42] been dull of hearing help me to hear the
[51:44] word of God so I can go up the ladder I
[51:47] can go up the ladder I can be more
[51:48] spiritually mature I can go past
[51:50] repentance and laying on of hands and
[51:52] baptism I can go beyond that that's the
[51:55] first danger of not hearing the word the
[51:58] right way is you will not become what
[52:00] God has called you to become okay here's
[52:05] a really good thought let's go to
[52:06] Matthew 13 this is a good thought from
[52:09] the Lord Jesus here about being dull of
[52:12] hearing this is probably one we're most
[52:13] familiar with Matthew 13 15 and this is
[52:23] what I taught at Bible Club on Thursday
[52:27] I said children I said how many ever
[52:29] heard this before like nobody raised
[52:31] their hand out of like 70 or 80 kids no
[52:34] one had heard that God hides himself
[52:35] from the wise and prudent hides I said I
[52:40] told the churn I said you like hide and
[52:41] seek they said yeah I said well guess
[52:43] what God likes hide and seek - he said
[52:47] it is the glory of God to hide something
[52:52] okay God loves to hide because he wants
[52:56] to see who's gonna come find me I think
[52:59] there's a story about that a person a
[53:00] child who went playing hide and seek and
[53:02] they got sad because nobody came looking
[53:04] for him would that be so sad well that's
[53:07] how God is God's like come seek me in my
[53:10] word and all these churches just go to
[53:11] church and they don't
[53:12] and they don't go home and study they
[53:14] don't go home and pray and gods like
[53:16] come come find me I'm in the secret
[53:19] place I'm in the closet I'm in the
[53:23] secret place but they don't go and find
[53:26] God my striking thought so I know that I
[53:31] know that the children got a good new
[53:32] lesson on Thursday because I preach that
[53:34] and they never heard that before
[53:35] that God loves to play hide and seek and
[53:38] the reason he does ads because the
[53:40] people or the RAM says he says it right
[53:42] here he actually used this word they're
[53:44] not interested enough in God see they're
[53:47] so interested in other things like I
[53:48] said we can name a million worldly
[53:50] things they're interested in other
[53:51] things rather than God's Word this is
[53:54] the reason Matthew 13 15 remember this
[53:59] was prophesied in verse 14 it says that
[54:01] Isaiah prophesied of this condition dull
[54:03] of hearing that they're just slow to
[54:05] actually hear what the preachers saying
[54:07] or the or the Bible
[54:09] verse 15 for this people's heart is
[54:12] waxed gross and their ears are dull of
[54:15] hearing slow of hearing and they have
[54:18] eyes I'm sorry and their eyes they have
[54:21] closed lest at any time they should see
[54:24] with their eyes and hear with their ears
[54:25] and should understand with their heart
[54:27] and should be converted and I should
[54:31] heal them Wow do you see what goes along
[54:34] look at the benefits this is powerful
[54:36] look at the benefits that go along with
[54:38] being able to hear the word of God did
[54:41] you get that if you can actually hear
[54:43] the word of God look at the benefits you
[54:45] understand the Word of God in your heart
[54:48] you get converted and you get healed
[54:52] amen so see the Pharisees never had this
[54:56] they never could be understanding the
[54:58] word they couldn't be healed and they
[55:00] couldn't be converted because their ears
[55:02] were dull of hearing they just didn't
[55:05] want to understand they just they wanted
[55:08] their denomination more and they don't
[55:10] want to apply that preached in their
[55:11] lives they'd rather have their money
[55:13] system and they'd rather have their
[55:14] support systems and they just want to
[55:16] keep their tradition going but I say God
[55:18] break up any tradition we have and let's
[55:21] get back to the Holy Ghost amen whooping
[55:23] - that we're all open to that
[55:25] look how faithful you all
[55:26] to come tonight we all want the power
[55:28] the Holy Ghost we want Jesus Christ to
[55:30] move that's why we're here tonight amen
[55:32] we don't have we don't have this
[55:34] attitude like I said I'm willing to be
[55:36] voted out I think I'm gonna be voted in
[55:37] again but I'm willing to get voted out
[55:39] just so we can have the truth I'm
[55:41] because we want to we want the truth of
[55:43] God and we want to be right with God
[55:45] that's how sincere we should be God
[55:47] destroy our tradition destroy our
[55:49] thinking give us clean hearts purify us
[55:53] right convert us heal us
[55:55] we just want ears that can hear the word
[55:57] of God no holds barred we say used to
[56:00] say that in the world no holds barred
[56:01] you know just just enough no rules that
[56:04] we don't want any rules of our own we
[56:05] just want God's Word amen I think I
[56:08] think you understand that we should be
[56:09] dead
[56:11] verse 15 now look what program says
[56:13] about this and this is why actually
[56:15] let's read verse 10 and the Sipos came
[56:17] and said why speakest thou unto them in
[56:19] parables and he answered and said and
[56:21] then because it is given to you to know
[56:23] the mysteries the king of heaven but to
[56:25] them it is not given they asked Jesus
[56:27] why are you speaking in parables and he
[56:30] said because it's for you to understand
[56:32] and to them it's not given now look how
[56:35] brother branham explains us like I said
[56:36] earlier he said it's because he used
[56:39] parables because they're plain simple
[56:41] lessons and the people would lose their
[56:43] interest can you imagine that brother
[56:45] Adam sister sisters can you imagine that
[56:48] God knew they wouldn't be interested so
[56:51] God is this you simple common parables
[56:54] to bore them okay this is God's this is
[57:00] God hiding himself God's foreknowledge
[57:03] knowing they're really not that
[57:05] interested in the gospel so I'm just
[57:06] going to give them simple parables so
[57:09] they just so they won't hear this is
[57:12] God's character
[57:14] the co-brother mem says this isn't here
[57:16] you him 1957 God's wrote it in riddles
[57:19] and parables so that he could hide it
[57:21] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[57:23] and reveal it to babes such as would
[57:26] learn Jesus thank the Father for doing
[57:29] that is that right that's what I showed
[57:32] the children the Bible said Jesus
[57:33] rejoiced and said thank you God that you
[57:36] hid this from the wise and prudent Jesus
[57:39] sad for those can I say like this he
[57:42] wasn't sad for those serpentine in one
[57:43] way do you understand what I'm saying
[57:44] like yes God wants all people to be safe
[57:47] but another way Jesus is like yes Lord
[57:49] you've hid it from them and you're only
[57:51] giving it to those who really can become
[57:53] humble like children amen
[57:55] so you got to see both sides of the
[57:58] slice like we said earlier he rejoiced
[58:00] in it you know but then he wants all to
[58:03] be same width of both sides of the slice
[58:06] and then he says this because you don't
[58:10] know God like reading a newspaper
[58:12] it's a spiritual revelation now here's
[58:15] where that word interest comes in and
[58:17] it's revealed to them who are interested
[58:20] in learning it so see that proves the
[58:24] Pharisees and Sadducees and all these
[58:26] sinners they were not really interested
[58:29] in the Word of God so Jesus told them
[58:32] parables simple stories just common
[58:36] everyday stories right here's another
[58:39] quote to back this up brother Branham
[58:42] said he purposely told parables to
[58:45] confuse them that's what the brother man
[58:48] said Jesus told parables to confuse the
[58:52] wise in other words the haughty and the
[58:55] self-righteous and we don't want to be
[58:57] self-righteous he purposely confused
[59:01] them Church listen what he said but we
[59:03] want to take a new route on this tonight
[59:05] another way around because every word of
[59:07] God dovetails together there's no
[59:09] contradiction in God's word I'd like to
[59:12] see the scripture that contradicts
[59:13] itself that cannot be straightened by
[59:15] the same scripture it is written surely
[59:18] in parables because it's purposely did
[59:21] that way to confuse the wise and the
[59:25] prudent that God might reveal it to
[59:28] babes such as would learned everybody
[59:31] understand that God told parables on
[59:34] purpose to confuse the wise and the
[59:38] prudent and I said this a few weeks ago
[59:40] but I want you to think about this again
[59:42] brother Branham said if Jesus was here
[59:44] today he would still preach baptize them
[59:47] in the name of Father Son Holy Ghost I
[59:50] have to find that quote for you brother
[59:52] Branham said that
[59:53] why would he why would he do that he did
[59:56] that because he's hiding it from the
[59:58] eyes of the wise and prudent he's
[1:00:01] purposely laying out there to confuse
[1:00:03] him because what's behind what's the
[1:00:05] real motive behind these serpent seeds
[1:00:07] heart it's self gratification it's lust
[1:00:11] it's selfishness I know that's kind of
[1:00:13] hard for our minds that's the real
[1:00:15] motivation behind it let me give an
[1:00:18] example I can go on Facebook on any time
[1:00:20] there's a high state football game and
[1:00:22] all these preachers and church members
[1:00:23] are on their faces painted jerseys on
[1:00:26] beers in their hand and they all as far
[1:00:29] as many as I know all of them they've
[1:00:30] all been baptized Father Son Holy Ghost
[1:00:33] and you see that can everybody see that
[1:00:35] that Jesus laid it out there on purpose
[1:00:38] and they're Lutheran there
[1:00:39] you name it they're independent you know
[1:00:41] they're they're Baptists I can show you
[1:00:44] all my friends like this and when if
[1:00:47] they're brought to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:48] how many would come to that baptism how
[1:00:50] many would forsake their fathers and
[1:00:52] only goes you see Satan hides behind
[1:00:55] that father son Holy Ghost so they can
[1:00:57] live selfish lives so they can live
[1:01:01] worldly lives are you with me tonight by
[1:01:02] God's grace you see that that's the
[1:01:06] mystery behind this Jesus said it on
[1:01:09] purpose to see because they he knew they
[1:01:11] weren't really interested so he speaks
[1:01:14] in a parable he speaks in plain speech
[1:01:16] and then he even speaks in ways that
[1:01:18] might confuse because he knows the wise
[1:01:21] and the prudent the prideful they don't
[1:01:23] really want the truth they just want to
[1:01:26] be able to have religion like Cain Cain
[1:01:30] had religion but he rejected the
[1:01:32] revelation he rejected the blood he
[1:01:35] rejected the Holy Ghost but I said Holy
[1:01:38] Ghost fall fresh on me amen
[1:01:39] followed them I saw my spirit my body
[1:01:42] taken full control me lever every fiber
[1:01:44] of my being be dedicated to the Holy
[1:01:46] Ghost amen
[1:01:47] you see this this is striking to me he
[1:01:51] did it on purpose to confuse them see
[1:01:56] this is the side of God's love that is
[1:01:58] the sovereign part of God's love where
[1:02:01] God knows who's gonna choose it and
[1:02:03] who's not he already knows so because of
[1:02:06] that he purposely
[1:02:07] confuses the Pharisees today he
[1:02:09] purposely confuses denominations and
[1:02:11] even message church members but
[1:02:13] everybody that's really in the message
[1:02:15] is born-again now because the message is
[1:02:17] Christ I'm just saying people go to
[1:02:19] message churches that are not really out
[1:02:21] there to serve God they just want to
[1:02:23] have religion but they still want to
[1:02:25] remain in sin and Jesus said they're
[1:02:26] dull of hearing so I'm gonna tell them
[1:02:29] simple parables they'll confuse them
[1:02:33] that's striking to me let's go to John
[1:02:36] chapter 8 I want to make sure I hit this
[1:02:38] Scripture if you never heard this one
[1:02:39] where Jesus says you cannot hear my word
[1:02:43] it just kind of came to me it's not even
[1:02:46] in my notes yeah John 8:43 okay yeah
[1:02:55] let's go to verse 842 John 8:42 jesus
[1:03:01] said to them if God we're your father
[1:03:03] you would love me that's why I say they
[1:03:06] your father
[1:03:07] you'll love the preaching of the message
[1:03:08] for I proceeded forth and came from God
[1:03:11] neither came I of myself but he sent me
[1:03:14] now verse 43 why do you not understand
[1:03:17] my speech they stalking the Pharisees if
[1:03:19] you read in the earlier chapter even
[1:03:21] because you cannot hear my word they
[1:03:24] heard it they they heard the parables
[1:03:26] they heard the literal words but they
[1:03:28] didn't obey what he said they had dull
[1:03:32] ears too slow to believe that remember
[1:03:34] they wouldn't been better they wouldn't
[1:03:35] be baptized under the forerunner John
[1:03:37] they wouldn't even believe Elijah how
[1:03:39] they gonna believe the God of Elijah
[1:03:41] right and if we can't believe brother
[1:03:43] Branham how are we gonna believe Jesus
[1:03:44] Christ
[1:03:45] see we got to hear God's prophet first
[1:03:47] and then we'll receive Jesus Christ
[1:03:49] because he spoke of Jesus Christ Jesus
[1:03:51] Christ set this Elijah in this hour
[1:03:53] amen verse 44 he just lays it out
[1:03:57] recently I had a youtube person say oh
[1:04:00] you know your video on makeup is to
[1:04:03] condemning and Jesus never condemned
[1:04:05] anybody I said what about John 8:44 he
[1:04:08] says you are of your father the devil I
[1:04:10] mean people just they have this love
[1:04:12] preaching doctrine like love they got to
[1:04:15] all confuse it's all perversion love is
[1:04:17] keeping the Word of God and I got this
[1:04:20] this perverted idea and they're not even
[1:04:23] hearing with the heart because they're
[1:04:25] not converted they don't understand and
[1:04:27] they're not healed so they're not healed
[1:04:30] from their sins they still have since
[1:04:33] they never repented in the first place
[1:04:35] so they'll continue to live in sin he
[1:04:40] said yer of your father the devil and
[1:04:41] the lusts of your father you will do he
[1:04:44] was a murderer from the beginning and
[1:04:45] abode not in the truth because there's
[1:04:46] no truth in him when he speaketh the
[1:04:48] life speaketh of his own for he's a liar
[1:04:50] and the father of it and because I tell
[1:04:53] you the truth you believe me not see
[1:04:56] that they couldn't hear heart but they
[1:04:59] could hear with their ears all the all
[1:05:01] the work that Jesus said they didn't
[1:05:03] want to obey it now that's pretty simple
[1:05:06] but I just want to lay that out there
[1:05:08] okay so another I just showed you two
[1:05:10] conditions now two dangers the first
[1:05:12] danger is you're not a teacher you're
[1:05:14] not a leader you're not where you should
[1:05:15] be in Christ the second danger as it
[1:05:20] says right here you'll you'll miss the
[1:05:23] plainness of the parables you'll miss
[1:05:25] the revelation of the mystery that's the
[1:05:28] danger they're slow of hearing is
[1:05:29] missing the revelation I think I got two
[1:05:32] more scriptures you let's go to acts 28
[1:05:34] 27 here's the next one
[1:05:39] yeah acts 28 27 so not only does Jesus
[1:05:44] quote as a ax but now st. Paul quotes
[1:05:48] Isaiah acts 28 27 we want to have ears
[1:06:01] that can hear amen we don't want dull
[1:06:03] ears we want to be able to hear what the
[1:06:06] Spirit saying amen acts 28 27 but Adam
[1:06:10] you wanna read that for me sir
[1:06:24] understand with their heart and should
[1:06:26] be converted and I Amen oh that's not
[1:06:30] exactly like what we read in Matthew 13
[1:06:32] pause now
[1:06:34] he's inviting people into his house this
[1:06:38] is his apartment here in acts 28 he was
[1:06:42] bringing them in and teaching them
[1:06:43] anyone that would come here him yeah
[1:06:46] that was in verse 30 he would dwelt in a
[1:06:48] house two whole years in a hired house
[1:06:49] and received all that came so Paul's
[1:06:51] basically have in house Bible studies
[1:06:53] but he even as he's doing house Bible
[1:06:55] studies he's seeing how people are
[1:06:57] coming in and they're hearing but they
[1:06:58] don't hear look at verse 28 but be it
[1:07:03] known therefore unto you that the
[1:07:05] salvation of God is sent into the
[1:07:06] Gentiles and they will hear it so Paul's
[1:07:09] saying Jews can't hear it they rejected
[1:07:13] it but now the Gentiles are hearing it
[1:07:16] so there's a third thing the third
[1:07:17] danger we have to hear the word of God
[1:07:20] while it's our season to hear the word
[1:07:23] of God or else we'll be dull of hearing
[1:07:26] amen now I think I got one more okay you
[1:07:34] know what brother Graham said is the way
[1:07:35] to get rid of dull hearing if we feel
[1:07:37] dull but the bram said is to have a
[1:07:39] personal experience in prayer that burns
[1:07:42] out the dullness so let me read you this
[1:07:45] quote if I can here let me read you this
[1:07:47] this is from what I'm sorry I got two
[1:07:54] quotes here let me see oh yeah this is
[1:07:58] from a personal experience with God 1954
[1:08:00] he said what the church needs tonight is
[1:08:02] to stop studying so much theology and
[1:08:04] get down to the altar and pray until a
[1:08:06] personal experience burns down into the
[1:08:09] human heart and burns out all the
[1:08:11] dullness and gives you a new vision
[1:08:13] that's what people don't do enough
[1:08:15] either of us pray and say God renew my
[1:08:17] vision help me to see what's really
[1:08:19] going on in my life
[1:08:20] how many people do you know that
[1:08:21] actually do that let me see what what is
[1:08:24] my life really like what am i producing
[1:08:25] in my life that's what will bring a
[1:08:28] person from dullness to real hearing
[1:08:31] that's what the Prophet says and then he
[1:08:34] says if you're light you can be like the
[1:08:36] rod of Aaron's rod that budded every
[1:08:37] sinner I don't care how dull how black
[1:08:40] what your life has been in the prints of
[1:08:42] Jesus Christ you'll live again and blue
[1:08:44] and bring forth opossums nursed of the
[1:08:47] Spirit amen
[1:08:48] hallelujah but Rev says you God you
[1:08:52] haven't left your people it's your
[1:08:54] people that's left you we become so dull
[1:08:57] and sense bound to we count upon our
[1:09:00] senses for all things so we have to
[1:09:02] count on the spiritual sense amen the
[1:09:04] spiritual sense of faith what is they
[1:09:06] telling me faith tells me God's Word is
[1:09:08] right now here's the thing Bob Arum said
[1:09:13] this he said so many things are dulling
[1:09:17] the senses of people today over in the
[1:09:21] midst of all that in spite of every
[1:09:22] dulling and every voices in the world
[1:09:24] today some of them are pleasure voices
[1:09:26] some of them are sinful voices to lure
[1:09:28] the people but in spite of every bit of
[1:09:31] that the truth of God still remains key
[1:09:34] that will hear my voice let him come
[1:09:36] after me and deny himself see brother
[1:09:39] Branham says it's like voices the way
[1:09:42] people get dull of hearing as they let
[1:09:43] too many voices in right they don't hear
[1:09:47] God's voice you don't hear the voice of
[1:09:48] the word or the voice of the five foot
[1:09:49] ministry they hear all these other
[1:09:51] voices rather than the voice they're
[1:09:53] supposed to hear amen
[1:09:55] I got a couple more things here and I'll
[1:09:59] try to finish up soon I told my wife an
[1:10:01] hour because I want to wear myself out
[1:10:03] but I mentioned something remember when
[1:10:08] I mentioned about brother Ram said he
[1:10:10] said a log will write rule rot twice as
[1:10:15] fast in water
[1:10:16] I remember that quote okay let me read
[1:10:18] this this is how can I overcome we'll
[1:10:19] look at a few scriptures now while
[1:10:21] you're waiting let's go to them back to
[1:10:22] Matthew 13:20 brother band said this is
[1:10:25] rodding this is or riding or withering
[1:10:27] he said our synonymous Matthew 13:20
[1:10:31] let's go there
[1:10:44] okay now Malka you can switch over now I
[1:10:47] want to I want to show that chart I'd
[1:10:50] use this chart quite often I want to
[1:10:52] show this chart of the four kinds of
[1:10:53] believers here yeah okay so the prophet
[1:11:02] of God said these are the you have saved
[1:11:05] and lost you have the believer your
[1:11:07] three kinds of believers believer make
[1:11:08] your unbeliever then brother Branham in
[1:11:10] the church age book says there's another
[1:11:11] class of believer there's foolish virgin
[1:11:13] and wise virgin so now you have these
[1:11:15] four three kinds of leaders in four
[1:11:18] classes of these fourth four classes all
[1:11:20] the way down through the Bible and we're
[1:11:22] looking at this right here
[1:11:24] the good ground the thority ground the
[1:11:26] stony ground the wayside groan brother
[1:11:28] Branham said that the stony ground is
[1:11:31] the one that had joy for a while but
[1:11:34] then after a while they withered away
[1:11:36] because they didn't have the ground
[1:11:38] they'd have the moisture of the dirt
[1:11:40] okay so this quote about someone who
[1:11:44] rots twice as fast brother Branham and
[1:11:47] the Bible teaches us it has to be this
[1:11:49] Judas a make believer thank God we're
[1:11:52] not riding away
[1:11:53] amen amen thank God we still love the
[1:11:56] Word of God and we're not riding away
[1:11:58] and don't see any more fruits and we're
[1:12:00] going old and angry and everything like
[1:12:03] that we can be we can be happy we're
[1:12:06] gonna be full of joy full of peace
[1:12:08] that's the Christian walk amen the
[1:12:10] fruits of the spirit but this is what he
[1:12:13] says here is those that rot now I'm
[1:12:17] gonna switch back over here these quotes
[1:12:18] are gonna be super tiny but I just
[1:12:19] wanted to show you that this isn't how
[1:12:22] can I overcome so I'm sorry this is just
[1:12:24] so small I really don't want you have to
[1:12:26] look at that but it's so small anyways
[1:12:30] you don't look at it but you probably
[1:12:32] will because it's hard not to look at it
[1:12:33] and later to see you had it coming to
[1:12:36] her now we see then knowing this is the
[1:12:37] lair of seen age knowing this age needs
[1:12:40] a sharp rebuke from God and he's a
[1:12:41] sharper Buch and when our clergy gets so
[1:12:43] soft and dodi like some age grandfather
[1:12:46] to his grandchildren every what they do
[1:12:48] is perfect it's been said so much that
[1:12:51] God is such a good God until they try to
[1:12:52] make God just a big dodi grandfather
[1:12:55] you see he's not he's a father a father
[1:12:57] right system correction and love is
[1:12:59] always corrective love corrects no
[1:13:00] matter how bad it hurts it's still
[1:13:02] corrects a real mother will correct her
[1:13:05] children a real dad will correct if you
[1:13:07] just get softened Dodie said I was
[1:13:09] crossing the old log the other day down
[1:13:11] a wash or what's called a hollow and I
[1:13:13] jump on this log on the outside look
[1:13:15] good look like big old beech log but
[1:13:18] when I jumped on it Oh a great big chunk
[1:13:20] of it fell off it was real rotten and OD
[1:13:22] I said that's the way the Christians are
[1:13:24] becoming they've been dead and sin and
[1:13:26] trespasses so long till they become Dodi
[1:13:29] now how can a Christian be dead in sins
[1:13:31] and trespasses because they never
[1:13:33] repented they never got past the dead
[1:13:35] works right we just saw in Hebrews
[1:13:38] chapter six he said they how they can
[1:13:42] hold no weight at all they don't know
[1:13:44] what the overcoming means he said I
[1:13:47] begin to think of this text then
[1:13:48] overcome keep life in you when life went
[1:13:51] out that's what brought that log to that
[1:13:52] condition see and it made it worse than
[1:13:54] ever when it late in the branch where
[1:13:56] the water was and there you take a
[1:14:00] Christian that's supposed to be a
[1:14:01] Christian and let the life of God go
[1:14:04] from him experience the joy of serving
[1:14:08] Christ and living in a church where such
[1:14:10] is going on he wrought ins twice as
[1:14:12] quick right under that condition now
[1:14:17] what is that that's Matthew 13:20 so
[1:14:20] let's go there notice the word joy
[1:14:22] brother Adam says join time so I'm sorry
[1:14:24] again that's so smart and they have time
[1:14:26] to really put these quotes on there the
[1:14:29] joy but they have said they can
[1:14:31] experience the joy of serving Christ
[1:14:33] there is the joy of serving Christ but
[1:14:36] then fall away and rot twice as quick it
[1:14:38] has to be scriptural right but whatever
[1:14:41] brother ham says if it's right it has to
[1:14:44] be in the scripture so Matthew 13:20 but
[1:14:48] he that received the seed in the stony
[1:14:50] places the same is he that heareth the
[1:14:52] word and anon with joy receiveth it but
[1:14:57] what happens yet hath he no root in
[1:14:59] himself he dearth but awhile for when
[1:15:01] tribulation or persecution arises
[1:15:03] because of the word by and by he is
[1:15:06] offended amen
[1:15:09] now it seems like I miss in the
[1:15:11] withering part where did I miss that
[1:15:13] it's verse yeah there it is verse six go
[1:15:17] back to verse six thirteen six sorry
[1:15:18] this is the withering part that's why I
[1:15:21] said withering and rotting is synonymous
[1:15:23] at least in the scripture that's what
[1:15:24] brother I was talking about a log that
[1:15:26] will rot twice as fast just like a plant
[1:15:28] that will wither twice as fast same
[1:15:30] thing they both die they both have no
[1:15:32] life in them amen verse six and when the
[1:15:36] Sun was up they were scorched and
[1:15:37] because they had no root they withered
[1:15:40] away all right so now we know what this
[1:15:44] means
[1:15:45] brother Rams always when we're hearing
[1:15:46] this about rotting twice as a message
[1:15:49] church or where the message towers that
[1:15:51] scripture because that's what happened
[1:15:53] to Judas
[1:15:54] can you imagine he was around Jesus my
[1:15:56] wife and I were talking about this not
[1:15:58] all the disciples were there from the
[1:15:59] very beginning of Jesus ministry so not
[1:16:01] all disciples were with him three and a
[1:16:02] half years I just learned that today I
[1:16:04] didn't even know that that's how I
[1:16:05] looked it up in the scripture it's
[1:16:06] exactly right so I don't know how long
[1:16:09] Judas was there but Judas the whole time
[1:16:11] he was with Jesus he had some good
[1:16:13] moments old taught in church he was
[1:16:15] riding away Heidi no because gonna come
[1:16:17] down to the end he just rotted away and
[1:16:19] committed suicide like he he sold out
[1:16:21] the word he had no life in him he didn't
[1:16:24] he was a log that sat there around the
[1:16:25] mess of the hour and rotted away until
[1:16:28] that thief's heart ate him alive it
[1:16:31] killed the very life of God we said that
[1:16:34] in Sector when I remember the four
[1:16:36] insects is that insect this ate away
[1:16:38] until there was no life and all there
[1:16:40] was was old death he looked like a
[1:16:41] strong log on the outside but if he
[1:16:43] stepped on him he broke in half does
[1:16:46] every understand that and this is me
[1:16:48] preaching this is down to the meed amen
[1:16:51] if you sin willfully after having a
[1:16:54] knowledge of truth there remaineth no
[1:16:55] more sacrifice for sin that's meat
[1:16:58] preaching so see that ties it with the
[1:17:00] four kinds of grounds remember I'm said
[1:17:01] that since it was a stony ground or one
[1:17:03] that had joy he said that's Catholic or
[1:17:06] that's the denominational spirit because
[1:17:08] they say I'm Peter up on this rock I'll
[1:17:09] build my church brother Adam said the
[1:17:11] stony represents that denominational
[1:17:13] idea right that mother harlot anyone
[1:17:16] who's a joint apart that mother harlot
[1:17:17] or that mother harlot system has a stony
[1:17:20] heart because
[1:17:22] for a while they rejoice in it but then
[1:17:23] they sell it out for the things of the
[1:17:25] world so rotten in the scripture cornice
[1:17:29] quo rotten is the same as wither now
[1:17:32] here's these last scriptures I want to
[1:17:34] read and then well I wanted to go a
[1:17:39] little bit further I really pretty short
[1:17:43] this morning darkness I really did I'll
[1:17:47] try to go fast I'll go fast go fast I'll
[1:17:49] set a timer
[1:17:50] give me temperament I'll try to shorten
[1:17:53] it a little bit once I get going I want
[1:17:55] to finish the thought you know and
[1:17:57] okay so here's rottenness in the bible i
[1:18:00] found some good scriptures I know it's
[1:18:01] so small forgive me mercy proverbs 12
[1:18:04] for a virtuous woman is a crowned her
[1:18:07] husband but she that make of the shame
[1:18:08] is his rottenness and his bone so a
[1:18:10] characterless woman think about the
[1:18:12] church the church is a woman a church
[1:18:15] without any character of real Bible
[1:18:18] character is rottenness in the bones of
[1:18:20] Jesus I say like that right he's just
[1:18:22] dead to him right it's a dead church so
[1:18:24] that's why he's on the outside trying to
[1:18:25] get back in cuz she's dead
[1:18:28] she's no longer the voice of God she's
[1:18:30] rotting she has no character propers
[1:18:33] 14:30 a sound heart is the life of the
[1:18:36] flesh I'm sorry that's probably close to
[1:18:37] me I keep bumping it forgive me I just
[1:18:40] want everybody to hear you know it's
[1:18:41] whenever to be able to hear so forgive
[1:18:43] me a sound heart is the life of the
[1:18:45] flesh but Envy is the rottenness of
[1:18:48] bones so people that are jealous or
[1:18:50] people that are Envy the heart condition
[1:18:53] that envies somebody else they're
[1:18:55] starting to rot so see every Christian
[1:18:57] should be so happy for every other
[1:18:58] Christian I'm so happy for you I'm so
[1:19:00] happy for it I'm so happy for you I'm so
[1:19:01] happy
[1:19:02] we shouldn't Envy each other we should
[1:19:04] just be happy if there's anything good
[1:19:06] in my life Jesus put it there anyway had
[1:19:07] nothing to do with me you can be happy
[1:19:09] for me I'll be happy for you we should
[1:19:12] have no Envy no jealousy no bitterness
[1:19:14] at all because that's rottenness sober
[1:19:18] man says remember he said some people
[1:19:19] like Judas they rot around the waters of
[1:19:22] the life they rot in the fastest because
[1:19:25] they're right by the message of the hour
[1:19:27] and this scripture the Jews were
[1:19:31] despising God's Word so God said you're
[1:19:34] rotting
[1:19:35] therefore as fire devoureth the stubble
[1:19:36] and the flame consumed the chaff so
[1:19:39] their roots shall be as rottenness and
[1:19:42] their blossoms shall go up as dust
[1:19:44] because they have cast away the law of
[1:19:46] the Lord of Hosts and despise the word
[1:19:48] of the Holy One of Israel so people
[1:19:51] start despising the preaching spies in
[1:19:53] God's thus saith the Lord the Bible said
[1:19:56] they're rotting already at the roots
[1:19:57] they're dying ok now my last thought I
[1:20:01] want to show this ok I've gone pretty
[1:20:05] hard on the dullness feel like I had to
[1:20:12] [Music]
[1:20:14] yeah yeah here's the closing
[1:20:20] close of this yeah this is my last
[1:20:21] thought okay let's go back to Matthew 13
[1:20:24] 16 I think yeah I think we're ready
[1:20:26] there yeah I meant through 1360 so right
[1:20:28] after Jesus says I'm gonna teach
[1:20:30] parables to purposely he said purposely
[1:20:34] confused them and he said because
[1:20:36] they're not interested in other words
[1:20:37] he's gonna bore them Jesus is gonna tell
[1:20:39] simple parable stories to bore them
[1:20:41] because they're really not interested in
[1:20:43] the gospel and Jesus rejoiced about that
[1:20:45] he said thank you Lord for hiding it and
[1:20:48] the eyes that's just striking to me
[1:20:49] because it's a different side of God
[1:20:51] that it takes faith to understand
[1:20:53] because it's sovereign it's just his
[1:20:55] sovereign just like when Jesus said can
[1:20:57] you imagine that she said I don't pray
[1:20:58] for the world does that make you so sad
[1:21:01] that makes you want to cry but yet he
[1:21:04] said it because he had foreknowledge of
[1:21:06] who would be saved and who be lost so
[1:21:08] Jesus isn't going to cry over tears
[1:21:10] he's not gonna pray for tears but you
[1:21:12] and I don't know who the tears are I
[1:21:15] remember the Bible said God does not
[1:21:17] even delight in the death of the wicked
[1:21:19] God doesn't love to see them go to hell
[1:21:20] but at the same time he's not gonna pray
[1:21:23] and waste his time praying for tears
[1:21:25] that he know are never gonna be wheat
[1:21:27] that's that's me preaching right there
[1:21:29] let's be preaching huh Matthew 13 16 he
[1:21:35] said but blessed are your eyes for they
[1:21:38] see and your ears for they hear looking
[1:21:42] for 17 this is what struck me this
[1:21:43] morning for verily I say to you that
[1:21:45] many apostles and righteous men have
[1:21:47] desired to see those things which you
[1:21:50] see and have not seen them and to hear
[1:21:53] those things which you hear and have not
[1:21:55] heard them amen now this is my question
[1:22:00] according to the Thompson chain Jesus
[1:22:03] spoke Matthew 13 in the second year of
[1:22:05] his ministry now this makes sense
[1:22:07] because Jesus telling them your eyes
[1:22:10] you've heard things that people just
[1:22:11] wanted to hear you've been around me
[1:22:13] long enough to hear some of these things
[1:22:17] and I thought well I need to go through
[1:22:19] and see what all that Jesus preached
[1:22:21] leading up to Matthew 13 why did what
[1:22:23] preaching had they heard that everybody
[1:22:25] had wanted to hear for all these about
[1:22:27] 4000 years it's pretty striking
[1:22:33] so let's do that let me know I'm closing
[1:22:35] with this I I will close with this cuz I
[1:22:37] got five minutes perfect in the back of
[1:22:41] my Bible I have a Thompson shame bag
[1:22:42] when I first came to message my brother
[1:22:44] Simon bought me at Thompson chamber who
[1:22:46] has a who has the Thompson chain bob was
[1:22:48] anyhow just my wife and I they are
[1:22:50] tremendous study Bibles if you don't
[1:22:52] have when they're expensive though
[1:22:52] you're gonna pay a hundred bucks for
[1:22:53] what assignment bought me when I first
[1:22:56] came in the message so I went back and
[1:22:59] looked at this is called the tree of
[1:23:00] Jesus life and it just goes through the
[1:23:02] whole history of his life but just a
[1:23:03] visual the the thing I want to show you
[1:23:06] is this this is the key to the tree of
[1:23:09] Jesus life the first part is about how
[1:23:11] Christ existed eternally because he was
[1:23:15] in the mind of God he was God the
[1:23:17] prophecies of Christ and then it goes to
[1:23:19] Christ's childhood and then it starts
[1:23:21] year one of his ministry
[1:23:22] now here's what I wonder I want to zoom
[1:23:24] into this so you can see this remember
[1:23:27] Jesus said he said blessed are your eyes
[1:23:30] you've seen and heard things that others
[1:23:33] have desired to see but haven't seen now
[1:23:36] let's see what they saw what did they
[1:23:38] hear about Jesus that everybody wanted
[1:23:41] to hear here's what they heard well
[1:23:47] first of all they saw water made to wine
[1:23:50] they miracles that they'd heard about
[1:23:52] right that they knew the Messiah would
[1:23:53] do and they got to see things that other
[1:23:56] people never got to see sorry and then
[1:24:00] what'd he do he cleaned up the temple
[1:24:02] this is chronological order of his
[1:24:03] ministry the first year of his ministry
[1:24:04] he gets baptized wilderness he testimony
[1:24:07] about John the Baptist he enrolls he
[1:24:09] only enrolled five of the disciples in
[1:24:11] his first year then he made water to
[1:24:13] wine he had the first Passover he
[1:24:16] cleansed the temple in the first year
[1:24:18] and this one like right here this is the
[1:24:20] preaching that all they wanted to hear
[1:24:22] the discourse on the new birth remember
[1:24:25] John chapter three what do they say they
[1:24:28] say we know your teacher said from God
[1:24:30] you couldn't do all these things these
[1:24:32] miracles unless God was with you and
[1:24:35] what is beginning to do he begins to
[1:24:37] teach them about the new birth and
[1:24:39] Colossians 1 said that Christ in you and
[1:24:42] the hope of glory was hidden God before
[1:24:44] the foundation of the world
[1:24:46] aim
[1:24:48] bless your eyes blessed are your ears
[1:24:51] for you heard things that people have
[1:24:54] longed to hear glory next he talks about
[1:24:59] the waters of life that's in John 4 yeah
[1:25:04] he talked about the waters with the the
[1:25:06] Samaritan woman then they have the
[1:25:09] revival in Samaritan then he heals the
[1:25:11] no woman's son then John gets in prison
[1:25:13] then he retires the Galilee then he has
[1:25:16] a discourse at Nazareth now let me go
[1:25:17] finishing year 1 and I'm sorry that was
[1:25:20] your 1 now this is year 2 they've put
[1:25:23] this in order chronologically and then
[1:25:27] he gets rejected in Nazareth he removes
[1:25:29] to Capernaum then he calls for more
[1:25:31] disciples so he called five disciples
[1:25:32] then four more in a second year and then
[1:25:36] he has the draught of fishes the miracle
[1:25:38] fishes then the demon demon demon iock

[1:26:13] the withered hand of the leper the
[1:26:16] Pharisees oppose him many are here to
[1:26:18] Galilee the 12th then he ordains the
[1:26:21] twelve in the second year and then he
[1:26:23] preaches the Sermon on the Mount hey man
[1:26:26] hallelujah where he says you've been
[1:26:29] told that now shalt not commit adultery
[1:26:32] but I say unto you even to think about
[1:26:35] it you've already committed it in your
[1:26:37] heart this is a very brother brother who
[1:26:40] said this is where Christ became the law
[1:26:42] giver the anti-type of Moses amen
[1:26:46] Moses brought the law but Jesus brought
[1:26:48] the real law of God this he said blessed
[1:26:51] are your eyes for you heard me preach on
[1:26:54] the new birth you've heard me preach the

[1:27:11] same as murder this is what men had
[1:27:16] desired to hear for all the ages and he

[1:27:23] let's stand to our feet by God's grace I
[1:27:26] could go on as you see there's a lot of
[1:27:29] things Jesus did and then were in John
[1:27:30] it said he did so much that even though
[1:27:32] all the books of the world couldn't
[1:27:33] contain it but isn't that beautiful
[1:27:36] Church don't you love that he said
[1:27:38] blessed of your eyes for they hear
