========================================

however I'd like to memorize that song and practice that song It's a Beautiful song there brother Chris suggested to us so thank you sir let's go to Proverbs chapter 18 verse 1. I Was preparing today I thought I was going to go with the dance series but then I had this thought about isolation again so I looked like to look at Isolation part two I just want to go a little bit deeper here I sat down there and it's going to go through my notes and I just I feel like there's something else I'd like to preach on that so we just hopefully it was the right inspiration by God's grace Proverbs 18 verse 1. but he had any battles all week or is everybody on cloud nine this week how's everybody doing good Hallelujah what's that no nightmares all right well how many do you think honestly I had a nightmare last night so I've been at a few battles this week but thank God for his grace and his Mercy hallelujah thank God for those victories those are wonderful wonderful moments praise God Proverbs 18 verse 1. Hallelujah let's read that together if we can here on three one two three through a desire a man having separated himself seeketh and intermedoleth with all wisdom amen let's have a word of Prayer God would help us to overcome our desires of our flesh and the desires of our mind praise God father God we just bow our heads Lord God we're grateful Lord God for all you've done Lord God we're thankful for these Services we're thankful for the fellowship and Lord as we start this year lord it's been so wonderful and father Lord we just ask you God to give us Grace here tonight to get out of your way completely Lord God you have a certain uh desire for tonight Lord You've ordained this service you've ordained all these services and father you have a certain testimony you want to bring out of this service so father help me just be yielded to you Lord I'm at my post to duty Lord God I've done my praying in the closet I've I've studied your word Lord God I just need your Holy Spirit now father each person Lord each one has a part Lord each one has a portion lord of the ministry of the Holy Ghost so God May each person get in that channel of the Holy Spirit and may we have a breakthrough Lord God may we have a victory Lord I just pray God your Holy Spirit could move Lord as you like to move Lord God we've been so grateful how you've been moving lately and to hear the testimonies of and father we just want that to continue Lord God so father all we know how to do is repent pray have the fervent desire to serve you Lord God hallelujah passion know your word Lord God and reaching out the Holy Spirit God we also have the great holy spirit will move here tonight Lord in a special way have your way Lord here tonight bless your people and we need you tonight Lord God we really need you to move God we're in the midst of Trials no doubt some of us and some of us need to see our sick healed Lord God some of us need encouraging words for others God just ministered to every need thou knowest what we have need of so Lord grant our needs to us we pray in Jesus Christ's name the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so we're thankful again for God's grace it's good to be here in the house of the Lord we have uh some slides here I have some quotes like to scriptures like to share just want to look at isolation part two and uh we read our text here tonight I'm not going to read on Luke 5 but we read how the scripture says through desire a man having separated himself so this is the case of of a man or woman of course yielding to the to the either the lust of the eyes lust of the flesh or pride of life and and they start feeling like like they can figure out life they feel like they don't need uh God's leading in this certain area or this certain time of their life and may God help us to not have as many of those times praise God we want to we want to actually live in God's wisdom praise God we want to have the fear of the Lord that's the beginning of wisdom praise God but we need a constant for us we saw we need a constant flow of the fear of the Lord because we just don't want the beginning of wisdom we like the end of wisdom right we like the middle of wisdom we like the end of wisdom what the Bible calls the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls so I'd like to stay in the channel of that uh the fear of the Lord and the knowledge of God and I'll just briefly review you know I'm not going to review much on that that first part listen to that today you know on double speed and I thought my what a uh what a time of the Holy Spirit speaking to us you know it was I was really quite moved by the Holy Spirit again just to see how God was speaking and uh of course we know there's numerous prayer testimonies afterwards and everything like that so it was really wonderful to see that but I just want to review that briefly you know as we go through great victories you know as we go through all the great emotions uh being born again and having Victory and as we go through all the Motions of having Joy I've been preaching a lot on emotion and having joy and praising God we got to remember there's going to be times when we don't feel it there's going to be times I think I maybe woke up was it Monday or Tuesday I didn't feel a whole lot of anything other than just tired cranky uh and I was like where's all my joy where's all my joy from Sunday um but that's just human nature that's the cycle by the way I'm talked about uh the Bible talks about there's a time and season for everything you know and so you know we this week you know even today we find ourselves in one of these isolated places we're either isolated into a sinful complex or a sinful uh Choice by our own choosing or God is maybe kind of withdrawn his Spirit a little bit from us and he's testing us may not feel as uh joyful or we may not feel as strong as we did maybe even a few days ago but God is giving us an insight into what's in our heart God's letting us see okay this is what's still in my mind I still got this idea I've still got that passion I've still got that desire and so that's isolated from God's maybe influence but it's it's God testing us it's God refining us right so we'll look a little bit more at that I want to go a little deeper there with job a little bit and also with Hezekiah just a little bit into those not a whole lot but a little bit into those but the best place to be as isolated with God Amen Hallelujah and you know the we're comforted isn't it such a comfort to know that no matter where we are God will never forsake us he'll never say I'm done with the bride of Christ Fellowship I'm done with him I don't care about them anymore God's never going to cast us away like that and so that that's a great consolation God gave us we'd say a thus saith the scripture thus saith the Bible he will never leave us nor forsake us as I want to revisit a few scriptures on that again tonight as well so you know we looked at we looked at Believers or you know people yeah we looked at Believers in every one of these cases right we looked at you know how Samson with his awful sins that he did yet even isolated by his own sin God could still wake him up praise God never said I'm done with this guy he's brought so much reproach on my gospel well of course the Old Testament law there's still Grace right there's still Grace in the Old Testament even though he was isolated in that dungeon or Evermore eyes plucked out God never forsake Him and God made sure the word of God on his life was fulfilled ah amen thank God and church we've got Philippians one if you ever doubt what God's going to finish you can go back to Philippians 1 say God is going to finish that which he started in my life praise God that verse has just been such a blessing over the years you know you hear different preachers preaching and different people confess it it is so beautiful it's so true God is going to finish what he started now that just come to me now like you know some of those Saints in uh Philippi uh well I'm sorry I was thinking I was getting Colossians and Philippians mixed up sorry so forget that thought um but you know we saw the prodigal son his own choosing he chose to leave the father's house and yet even eating Pig's food even in the uh we'd say the the most dirty condition you could be in he came to himself think about that God let him get back to his sound mind when he ran from a sound mind when he ran from common sense when he ran from Holiness he ran from uh sanctification he ran from everything yet God still allowed his mind to come back to him praise God oh thank God Amen how they do sometimes we get the wrong mind we're fixing to do something who steps in God steps in praise God Amen like I said God keeps us from ourselves amen he keeps us from the things we would do or the things we might do or the things we're planning hallelujah thank God he interrupts our life Hallelujah keeps us from doing things that we would do otherwise keeps us from shame praise God and as we'll see we'll get to you know we'll get to uh job we'll get to Hezekiah with the testing um you know with Hezekiah I was looking at that he was 38 or 39 when Isaiah said thus saith the Lord set your house in order is going to die because he started writing he started ruling out 25. he was only 14 or 15 years into being King and God said it's the perfect time that you go right now he's like I don't want to die before 40. now who we'd all say that wouldn't we we I don't want to die before I'm 40. I'm already 42 but I don't want to die before I'm 50. I don't want to die before I'm 60. I would like to live to 100. but that's just have a context of what it's there like God God said it would be best to leave at 38 or 39. but because of his Integrity he cries out to God and God gives him a dozen thus say the Lord Isaiah go back in there and tell them I'll give him 15 more years but the Bible said God uh said God was upset with uh Hezekiah because he did not bestow the same Honor on God that he'd given before God honored him but then he didn't return the honor back to God now look at that that shows you know in these situations God will honor you but God wants you to honor him in return right Hezekiah had honored him for all those years but then God said okay I'm going to honor your faith I'm going to give you some more time but then God expects you to honor him with all your time ah amen amen hallelujah and that was a time though when God said I'm okay I'm going to take away some of these feelings I'm going to take away my constant present from his presence from Isaiah Hezekiah and let's see he's going to find out what's in his heart and what was in his heart compromise was in his heart now look at that he compromised with those Babylonian princes had it been Pride right had it been Pride because he didn't honor God he honored himself he was trying to honor Israel right look at all the look at all the gold cups look at all this look at all the priests uh instruments look at all this gold look at all this silver he was caught up in Pride so God said look you still have some pride in your life he's 39 he's 40. he's 50. whenever those princes came we don't know when he came but we didn't they know we know he came within 15 years of being 40. see no matter how good we've done for God now look he said I've served you with a pure heart look at this church no matter how good we serve God up to now we've got to understand God can still test us right and we can still dishonor some some some area of our life but let's be disciplined no matter what season we're in we're going to stay with the word of God hallelujah right because he was isolated God isolated Hezekiah to see now I'm going to show you what's in your heart and it's a test it was a test God wanted him to pass the test but did he pass it no he failed that one now of course he repented later and he had a good you know a good death and good victories good testimonies but in that particular test he you know when God isolated himself he failed that particular test because of pride and so may God help us like I pray you know I prayed I preached it before God help me not to sin before the people Help me to live so pure before the people if I sin let's just be between you and I Lord God you know I don't that because I never want to put a stumbling block in somebody's way I want to put Stepping Stones amen hallelujah I'm gonna put stumbling Stones I'm gonna put Stepping Stones so you can walk higher amen you see my life you see my testimony and I know you wouldn't do the same thing too amen you want to put stepping stones in my for me oh look at brother awesome praise God I'm gonna go higher in faith Hallelujah look at brother amen and look at our brothers sisters my look at our young people that makes you want to go a little higher in Christ myself amen and then of course isolation with God is the best thing to do you're shutting with God ah those precious moments shut in with God in the secret place amen they are in the spirit be holding his face amen gaining new power to run in his race amen how I long to be struggled with God see now you might long for it but listen Church you might be in one of these as we'll get to you might be here in the sinful isolation and you don't know how to get yourself out and you might be longing for some fellowship but thank God there's a way out praise God Hallelujah same way you got in by your own will praise God your own will was going to get you out we'll get to that here by God's grace and so uh let's remember here we have these different types of isolation isolation is not always a bad thing it's not always a bad thing like we saw you know it's not always a bad thing you know God will isolate you for a time and season to have fellowship with him right that can be a good thing uh when you're isolated away from Sinners thank God when you're isolated away from Temptations Hallelujah that's a good thing Hallelujah and so we gotta look at it like that too you know there's there's benefits to being isolated like brothers said in 1960 remember he said he said the holy spirit said to walk with me you'll walk alone but he said I've catered too much to denominations so brother Brown was catering he was making little uh compromises here and there right which he admits he says many times I fail many times I do these things I caused an impersonation on the third pole remember that he said I've caused many impersonations because that and the angel rebuked him for it he was a man just like we're human we make mistakes right but we were thankful God will never leave us or forsake us hallelujah God's not in the forsaking business oh amen he's in the faithfulness business Hallelujah he's in the saving business Hallelujah amen thank God so we're grateful you know that uh no matter where we find ourselves we know God will never leave us nor forsake us Hallelujah now here's the thought here's the main thought as I was meditating there and uh I just kind of went back to this sermon I thought I was going to go with the thought on Joy I thought I was going to go with joy dancing with joy but I just felt led to hear go here so kind of how I try to do it by God's grace so now um I want to see how isolation uh kind of fits in with trials and temptations because they're the same thing a trial or Temptation right same thing now regarding this trial or Temptation so if you're not in that isolation with God then you're in one of these right you're either approaching you're you're coming up to a temptation right or you're in the trial or temptation or you're a hedge from the trial or temptation all right right so it's very similar right to the isolation you're the isolated with God you got the Hedge and just you and God right Satan gets mad at that one we saw that in the Book of Job he gets mad when God does that if I say do it more God Amen do it more praise God it's not going to be shutting with the Lord but see we're either in one of these and this is the thought I preached this back in I think 2013 almost 10 years ago I preached this little thought I'm not going to preach much of that but this is just that thought I had I was like oh yeah that's right we're either approaching one we're in one or we're hedged from one and so uh here's the one we're approaching it Jesus come to disciples this on the night of his arrest and finding them asleep and said unto Peter what could you not what watch with me one hour now look Jesus says you would have been able to overcome if you would have prayed one hour think about that if they would have prayed one hour they would not have been afraid about being arrested and would not have scattered think about that think about the power of Prayer in The Hour of Power That's Why They Call It The Hour of Power the televangelist stole that that actually less holy ghost power they stole it and they made it a TV show it's not the hour of power of the TV show it's The Hour of Prayer and I pray this weekend an hour all for Sunday service I made sure I was like that's why I gave the amen that envelope I said I'm going to pray for an hour I'm going to see if something happens on Sunday now I didn't see a whole lot Supernatural but I saw a person who'd been gone for 12 years come up for prayer so I said I'll take that I'll take that amen I've been praying for them inviting them back to church praise God and uh just see the tears and it was just really beautiful so I'll take that praise God but see I got to reach out more in the spirit though he says watch him pray that you enter not into temptation in other words you're approaching a Temptation what was it it was arrest right it was scattering Satan had a trap and he was going to scatter all these Burly fishermen right who could one could walk on water at one time right oh I'll never forsake you Jesus I'll die for you tonight but a Temptation was coming then right they were coming right up to it or I said like this it was coming right to them right the mob came right up to them it came to them and Jesus says you're going to approach it he said the only way to approach it is getting your flesh and mine in one Accord with a soul hey there it is amen hallelujah praise God he hurts me can't get too tired on God right if not we're going to enter into the Temptation that's why we got to sleep good you got to eat good right you got to cast your cares on the Lord you can't be stressed out because the the Temptation is coming pray that you don't enter into it and you got to have your flesh you got to have your mind and you got to have that one Accord with the soul praise God I didn't see that till now praise God your flesh is weak so you better take care of that flesh and bring it under subjection to the word of God Hallelujah so here we see you know these disciples uh the 12 or 11 rather we're in this place where here it comes here comes the battle and I let oh my I even love this Jesus says uh Jesus I say like this Jesus tried to prepare them for that oh there it is right there the Holy Ghost will bring sermons and try to prepare you for the next the next battle Yeah Jesus said come pray with me how many times you went three times back each time you come back you guys are sleeping come on say up pray with me you guys are you guys with me are you in me are you with me in this no they're great they're sleeping again okay just go ahead and sleep on go and sleep he said I need help here comes a great Temptation here comes a great trial I need help Church how many times do we need each other's help here tonight praise God and who's depending on our prayers now we've seen it with Jose God's really blessed our prayers awesome those who prayed for the Jose God's delivered him from some of these health issues because of some of our prayers now how much more everybody else I'm just saying he's one person what about the rest of the church see how our prayers are going to be so pivotal because God will put it on our heart it'll bring a sermon or it's a song or something let you know a trial is coming you better get into prayer Hallelujah if you're going to overcome you need an hour of power amen hallelujah praise God Amen amen that's right that's right church and after that hour of weekend of prayer I felt so much I felt really good I knew God was going to move on Sunday I knew it I didn't know how but I was like oh God's gonna move today that's why I wrote that down I never did that before I gave it to brother amen I just felt led I just felt burden there I felt burdened uh about that but here you know you you might be here you might be here where you're approaching or God is bringing a trial your way right and so that's what we need we need uh to understand well am I approaching one if so I better get into prayer I better get into prayer now here the second one is when you're in the trial right now this just so you know this this trial Peter writes about it doesn't seem like it's self-inflicted this seems like you're being tested you know because God's maybe pulling away from you right to test your faith now look wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season a season a season of testing if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold Temptations so they are heavy temptations there are lots this church Peter wrote to had lots of Temptations right now like they were he wrote them that letter in the moment they're going through his trial after trial it's time it might be a year it might be a year of tests after test struggle after struggle but Peter said don't forget to Rejoice because the trial of your faith is more precious than gold amen it's producing something in you amen it's not meaningless it's producing a weight of glory amen if I can quote John Piper I love that no you slay me oh if you like playing that tonight it's producing something Hallelujah it's creating in you an expectation for God to move right either a move here on Earth or move you up to heaven right if it's the end of your road no matter the suffering whatever the manifold temptation is oh this is I feel like I can't handle much more of this this is overwhelming this is overwhelming but take courage it's producing something praise God it's either getting you ready for greater battles down the road or it's getting ready for you to get your great reward are you laughing a theophany body hallelujah amen hallelujah a place in heaven Hallelujah to be absent from the body be present with the Lord It's producing a weight of Glory praise God and so this church was going through manifold not one Temptation oh brother Justin really struggling with this one Temptation they had more than that they had lots of them think of the busiest or hardest time of your life which what would it be you got troubles in the home you got troubles with your health right think of job you got troubles on the job troubles in the church everywhere you look it's just oh Burden Burden Burden when is this ever going to end but see God allows you to go in there because he put you in the fires to burn away some of that dross Amen to burn away some of that uh Humanity or those human thoughts right it's being tried it's your faith is being tested by fire that's why I believe one of the one of the definitions of that you're baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire that's either the fire of God in your soul or it's the bats of the Holy Ghost in your soul so you can endure the fires of Trials it could be either one Holy Ghost and Fire because we see it here it's more it's tried with fire then these are born again Saints Peter tells them later You've Got The Incorruptible seed of God Amen Hallelujah you're not born again of a natural seed it's an Incorruptible it's an eternal seed of God Amen you're a gene seed of God you're an attribute of God you've got eternal life Hallelujah but yet you're going through heavy manifold Temptation battle after battle after battle when am I going to get out of this battle when it's your season to get out of the battle Hallelujah so what you should you do he said Rejoice I know it's hard church I know it's hard I'll say Amen with all of you that's hard it's extremely hard that's what I love about coming to church though even I can have like a headache I can be in the midst of a trials but I feel like this is this is my time to just forget all about that and just meditate on Jesus Hallelujah I know there might be battles after church there might have been battles before church there might I know there might be battles tomorrow or this weekend there's going to be a battle but at least I can forget about that for a few moments I can get in the prince of God I can give God praise Hallelujah I can worship him because he's worthy of my praise and I then I can say Glory then I can say at least I've praised him in the trial amen at least I went to church and praised him instead of complaining about it and say you'll say well uh you're you're a hypocrite well of course my flesh is a hypocrite but I'm not talking about my flesh here that's why I need a blood sacrifice of course I'm a hypocrite but Satan actually you're the biggest hypocrite I know because you were by the very Throne of God and tried to exalt yourself above God you actually sang to God and now you're fighting against God but your ending is a lot worse than mine amen I don't have a bad ending I might go to the grave but my soul lives Hallelujah and I'll go to the prince of God but you're going to Lake of Fire so I'm not going to listen to you I'm listening to God's word amen Glory Hallelujah in other words I might have cancer I might have a Parkinson's who knows what will happen hopefully none of it but what if you do a lot of message people have died over the last few years who would have thought who would have thought we'd be here in 2023 you know you don't you don't know but you got to have faith so that when you go through the trials you can overcome praise God and you can praise God you can bless God in the midst of the trials Hallelujah so you don't complain or you know we're all going to battle that but you got to overcome praise God you got to recognize this is just a test God is refining me I'm becoming a better Christian praise God oh Hallelujah so rejoice in the midst they're in the midst of the fire they're in the midst of the temptation all the Temptations are all around them they're tempted to be angry they're tempted to be bitter they're tempted to lust they're tempted to steal they're tempted to lie all these Temptations right but Peter said Rejoice your faith is being tested and church if you're a child of God you're going to pass the test because God won't give you a test you can't pass amen God's not some of these whack teachers out there you know he's he's a he's a faithful teacher Hallelujah he's the best teacher he's not going to allow you to be overcome he's going to rescue you praise God amen so these were trials that didn't seem self-inflicted now this one is self-inflicted okay now Paul is speaking to about the ministers the servant and Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach impatient now watch this if someone comes to church and they're in an awful struggle or a snare or they're in uh isolated by themselves as a minister or Minister we have to in order to help them we've got to be meek to help them we can't be prideful like oh you're a backslidden like William was telling me you've seen preachers do that oh that you're just a bachelor and so and so you got to repent all this it's actually meekness is what wins over people that are caught in snares see it's the tender hand of Jehovah can I say like that hallelujah it's gentle Jesus right now there are time for rebukes don't get me wrong but here's what I'm just giving you here's the context of what Paul said the sermon of the Lord in meekness must instruct those that oppose themselves they're fighting against themselves they're causing their own problems they're causing their own addictions like they're the cause of that they're they're defeating themselves but the servant Lord must not point that out so much the server Lord must be humble yeah or say in a humble way see we've got to be meek well here's here's where you went wrong you know here's we got to do this to get out of this snare got to do this next and do that right it's got to be humble not prideful it's got to be humble so if someone is in their own uh Temptation they've caused it's their own isolation their their own desires have led them into this a minister have to has the spirit of humility to instruct them well here's how you get out of it you know you know why a minister can do that because the minister has been in Trials before amen that's why the Bible says the minister can't be a novice he had to go through some trials you don't put a guy who just got saved up there and start preaching he don't know nothing about any battles he's not even he's not even had a trial come to him right now he's living in sin yeah he might add one Victory he got to salvation but he hasn't weathered any storms he hasn't gone through the season but Church you and I have gone through the seasons amen Hallelujah we know how to fight we know how to overcome praise God and it's through humility it's through obeying the word of God and because we've overcome now that we've overcome we can tell people this is how you'll overcome praise God Hallelujah now look if now look at this it's a big if not every person we minister to is going to come out of their addiction or their Temptation if God per Adventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth see it's it's in God's hand this is God in other words God knows this person's choices what they're going to do God has predestinated this event right and all we can do sometimes Church all we can do is just instruct them here's how you get out but they've got to get out right if God will give them repentance see they've got to acknowledge the truth most of the time it's your own it's our own fault right if we're in snares it's our own fault can you think of a time where you were in a snare and it wasn't your fault right most of the time it's my fault right I shouldn't have done that I should have had better poor knowledge than that like I told you some of my thoughts on Sunday night remember I told you two of my faults there from the fall I'm not ashamed I'm sorry I'm embarrassed about that I'm ashamed of that but I got caught up in uh the past I got caught up and I didn't even think about wow it's gonna be totally different than what it was like when I was in school and it was it was ten times it was 20 times worse than it was when I was in school I couldn't believe that but that was my fault but see all we can do is instruct and then we got to pray that they will recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will see God doesn't tempt us the devil tempts us and so it's Satan's will I want to attempt brother Jesse or I'm going to tap it Malachi or I gotta I got this snare set up for Lydia and I can't wait to hurt them I can't wait to wound them I can't wait to get them trapped so they uh so they doubt God or they speak evil or they they get hatred in their hearts remember the Bible said Jesus said Peter Satan has a desire to sift you as wheat well how do you sift wheat you got to shake it around you agitate it right agitate you got to throw it up in the air That's what Satan wants to do shake up our lives and throw it up in the air and it's all chaos right Satan wants to create chaos but you've got to trust in God hallelujah amen you got to find peace Amen in the midst of the storm amen you gotta find victory in the midst of the trial in the midst of your Temptation you got to find joy you got to find rejoicing you got to find a promise of God Amen we can't look at the natural things we gotta look at the spiritual things amen we don't look at things that are seen we look at the Unseen amen so Satan desired to trap and put yourself in there he trapped us let's say we're in a snare it was Satan's will but see we gave our will over to that and now we've got to Humble ourselves we've got to acknowledge the truth so we can get out of this see what is it it's always about the truth the spirit of Truth that's why you got to Worship in spirit and Truth see that's why if we come to church and the word of God doesn't change us it doesn't do if the truth doesn't do something to us we're in a bad spot because the acknowledging the truth sets us free the word of God Jesus has Sanctified them through thy truth Thy word is truth the word is truth amen just the word preach should set people free praise God Amen they can acknowledge that in the spirit of God they believe that they obey that the spirit of God will come upon them then you got spirit and Truth again amen Glory see now this was totally self-inflicted uh snare was set I gave into the snare now I'm trapped can you imagine like uh we had to catch a mice a few weeks or Mouse a few weeks ago that poor little mouse but again that that glue trap you know and he's on there and he's stuck good I'm like I hate touching these things but he was caught in a snare it's his own fault no he didn't have to walk on there but I put some sunflower seeds in there it's his own fault and then he got thrown out with the trash the next day you know he was it was self-inflicted he couldn't contain his hunger now see we got a hunger and thirst after righteousness like I was telling Chris you got to feed the holy spirit inside of you yeah sometimes I feel bad saying like a white dog and black dog like the holy spirit's not like a dog I just feed the holy spirit inside of you he's a dove even feed the white dove amen not the black crow or whatever more feed the white dove Hallelujah make him strong see so see your lust got you into

want to be a I don't want to be caught in this anymore I don't want to be a slave to this anymore I want to be free and praise God I don't want to be trapped in here I want to be victorious Hallelujah but you got to want the victory more than you want the pleasure usually it's pleasure and the church said because they were lovers of Pleasures more lovers God we're not that but sometimes we get caught in the little sins right brother I said we don't do we won't do major we'll do minor the church said we won't do major Sins murder adultery homosexuality all these things we want to do major things but we'll do minor things that displease the Lord and they are snares there are snares they're traps that Satan had set up right he said well I see Jesse goes here every day I see Jesse uh he

Jesus Hallelujah keep going keep serving God Amen right like it happens like usually happens like uh someone will try to get you to bad-mouth somebody right or worship somebody like brother Brandon worship a tape or something like that they'll try to get you off and so you got to be ready you got to be prayed up praise God you got to be aware I may be coming into a Temptation so I need my spirit strong I need my flesh strong I need well my soul's always strong Hallelujah all right Glory now here's the beautiful part when you're hedged about amen the Lord said to say have you considered my hedge about servant job I put that in there if you can serve have you considered my protected servant over here is that that's what it was there's nobody like him in the earth well of course you can live like that when you're in a holy bubble yeah like how many times have you thought that I mean I've talked to friends man I wish I could just live at the church all day my cousin Adam told me that sometimes I feel like that too I'd have this holy bubble well spiritually we can have that how many can say Amen to that you've gone through weeks nah not even a trial two weeks not even trial we'll wait to that third week no I'm just kidding you know you don't know how long it's going to last but God's like have you considered him look I hedged him around I bless everything he's done all of his financial decisions all of his children I bless them all have you considered him like I said what does he fear God for nothing does he fear God for not you may didn't you make him a hedge about him and his house now of course don't forget church job had a part in that too because he prayed all the time for his kids amen he sacrificed all the time for the kids Hallelujah amen so see job one of the glory job one of the heads God set up a hedge if you were the Hedge God just God will set one up for you praise God amen now remember so you'll last the season but enjoy that season praise God because it's better than the other one better than the boils better than cancer right Church yeah right I saw a co-worker last night I haven't seen her for years I said how's your son how's your daughter doing he's like well she's like well my daughter just got a job just graduated college my son just got done with leukemia and I'm like this dude I saw this dude a few years ago he was working at Chipotle Dylan's his name he was a football player like he played for Copley you know what she's just pointing up to God she's like God I just trusted you know the the radiation helped and she said I just trusted doesn't come back I thought well I'm going to pray for them he's 22 23. leukemia I had a friend in high school he was a star football player he died at 20 years old from leukemia 20. we don't have no guarantee surgery there's no continuing City here so we got to be ready we got to be faithful When Trials come I'll say like this we ought to Rejoice if we got a hedge about us that's why sometimes I've danced these last few months because God's been so good to me I look at my friends people died cancer leukemia all these deaths all around here what do we got nothing but Grace nothing but God's mercy nothing but Grace hallelujah what has he done he's put a hedge about his church so there's times I just want to thank God for that Hallelujah that's why the devil don't like that one wait to the next one I dance amen glory because it's all God's grace well look at you done hadn't you done that and of course God would have said of course I did that but job prayed for it here's the proof right over here like remember uh in uh uh Cornelius had all those memorials in heaven ah all those prayers all those alms all those fast things Heaven had witness of it praise God I wonder if God said well devil look over there look at all jobs and memorials see can't you see why I put a hedge about him I'm going to hedge about you well it's time to pray amen time to fast time to give homes draw close to God and draw God will draw closer to you praise God amen Glory see he had a hedge now here's some of your Hedges that I want to reiterate again tonight what is your hedge brother Jesse it's the fact I'm saved and I can praise God how are you protected from the devil well I trust God's salvation and I always give God praise my walls are salvation my gates are praise amen Hallelujah keep praising God keep thanking God that you're saved amen that's your wall that's your wall salvation you're saved you're going to heaven you're not going to hell you're going to heaven Hallelujah that's my wall Hallelujah that's my hedge and the gates in our praise come on Praise You Jesus I love you praise His name forever praise the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world Amen Glory [Laughter] thank you Jesus amen I feel like preaching now and I'm feeling religious Glory but I won't preach two hours tonight hopefully see hedge your hedge God has you fenced around with walls of salvation Gates of praise Hallelujah the church sometimes you know as a song leader I'm sure but amen I'm not Amos never told me this but I know as a song leader when I see people not praising God like they ought to sometimes I wonder what's going on in their life how can you not praise God are those hands so heavy you can't lift them to Jesus at least you can lift them some people can't lift their hands right this is the this is the protection the Bible said he inhabits there it is he inhabits them Praises of his people you want God's anoint you start praising God Amen start dancers start shouting start singing start moving praise God because God will come and anoint that worship amen Hallelujah he comes to anoint those who worship Him amen hallelujah thank you Jesus beautiful scripture Lord Jesus thank you thank you Hallelujah he Hedges us about with salvation with praise Hallelujah see church that's what we need we need a life of praise right we need a life knowing we're saved Hallelujah I know I'm saved and that also means I know Satan's going to try to do everything he can to think to convince me I'm not but I'm gonna do everything I can to convince him I am Hallelujah that's right now remember there's these these principles on Temptations remember you're either coming one coming to one you're in one or you're protected from them right but we have these principles and these ought to make us rejoice God will not allow us to be defeated in Temptation if we want to overcome right he will not suffer Saints I copy this from Albert Barnes I think it was to be exposed or beyond their powers to bear God won't make the burden so heavy that you just you have to quit no there's always strength God will always give you strength to Bear the burden Hallelujah it's never going to be too hard like oh I can't overcome the peer pressure or I can't overcome the feeling or I can't overcome the Temptation it's never going to be like that God's gracious Hallelujah he's not going to make it too hard right because then every sinner would go to heaven and say well I couldn't handle God's gonna say like yeah you could anybody could look Jesse could her the sister could brother could you know we can overcome it God makes a way of escape and knows how to deliver so God's trying to do a testimony in your life praise God he allows his snare to be set but he also allows a great escape and a great way out God wants to give a testimony through this God allows us temptation to come so you can overcome and then you can give a testimony at church on Wednesday night yes or on Sunday morning or Sunday night or on a podcast amen you give a testimony praise God wants you to find the way out like that's why they put those exit signs that's why it's code you got to have the way out it's got to be clear it's got to be playing God can't make it any more plainer than giving us the word of God and sermons and songs all have testify that God's away maker praise God he makes a way through the fire makes a way through the Temptation whether it's manifold or wood or you're just approaching one he'll always make a way so you can get out praise God hmm he knows how to deliver you he gives you Grace to embed to Bear The Temptations I can put up with this for a little while longer I can handle this for a few more days Hallelujah and the Bible said yeah like first Peter said we may have heavy Temptations it may be like it may be like War this may be a season of War one after another one after another but God's always going to make a way out brother Ram said I have the quote I didn't put it up here but remember said the test is the best thing that happened to you I wonder if job would say that right it's the best thing that happened to you because it's going to purify you it's going to promote the character of Christ in your life and then Paul said this was a good thought I thought Paul said I had a Temptation in my flesh sometimes you're being tested in your flesh mainly right a sickness tumor covid you know whatever it is sometimes it's a battle of the Mind the test is up here complex right I can overcome this complex I just can't stop thinking about that I can't stop worrying about that there's a balm in Gilead for that there's a serum for that there's a solution to that problem praise God Amen we all know it but it's good it's great to hear it amen because we forget about it right we go through battles and trials it's great to hear about it again it's great to have that reminder stir up my mind by way of remembrance praise God remind me who I am amen remind me of the word of God remind me of the victories remind me of the promises remind me of God's favor on my life amen remind me of God's love for me praise God hallelujah oh God loves you he loves me sometimes you got to locate the Temptation most of us is going to be in the flesh or the mind ain't gonna be the soul because the Soul's already given over to the Lord surrender to the Lord right so it's going to be the mind it's these mind battles off of my battles or this this Thorn In My Flesh I just can't get well I can't figure this out we can't find the root cause of it it's a Temptation in the flesh and so God has allowed you you've come to it and now you're in the battle right there in the middle remember like like Albert Barnes said this too he said we can be tempted without entering in temptation right as Jesus overcame everyone so you can be right at you can be right as a neighbor to Temptation I guess or it's right at your doorstep right like brother man talks about the boxer rattlesnakes Hallelujah you could be right there and right next to the temptation but you can still say no you can still overcome praise God hallelujah you can be right in the face right you're looking at it right right in the eyes you can look at the right at the testimony or I'm sorry the Temptation it might seem uh alluring it might seem difficult but even there right in the face of it you've got a high priest who can understand what that feels like amen and the Bible said and even look in the face of Temptation you can reach out and touch the Lord and He Can Be Touched by the feeling of your infirmity amen I say the best way to touch them is probably like this right get on your knees and reach up to heaven praise God hallelujah pray in other words pray and touch the heart of God touch the Throne of God hallelujah amen you can be tempted without entering into it right remember church this was about job I don't you remember this this was a blessing to me when I was looking at my notes from Wagga God is saying hey look how great job is I place the Hedge about him and I won't deny that but job said this caught me when I got a little bit Lacks remember the Bible said that it was in job 16 12. I'm going to read that job 16. so that's why it's important church that's why discipline is so important I know it's hard to preach and hard to hear uh verse I was at ease but he hath broken me asunder and he hath also taken me by my neck and shaken me to pieces and set me up for his mark though he slay me yet I'll trust him same as who said that said this so see job was faithful with the prayers but look he was human too just like you right and remember John the Baptist was greater than job he's greater than Moses John the Baptist is greater than Enoch we talked about John the Baptist last night that's why he's fresh on my mind did the Bible say last night man of the wilderness but see Joe got the spot where he just took a look started taking a cruise control on his spiritual life well I just try to get through these Services I'm not going to really put much into them like I should like the pastor's been preaching right or the guest preacher or whoever it is yeah see we kind of take an Ease on we we put we take a little uh we take our foot off the pedal maybe that's a better illustration bar rather than pressing into it and really going into it we kind of take a step back well that's a good time well that was the time God allowed okay you can be tested you can be Satan can have these things this hedge can be taken away when he was at ease all right now even at the end remember he abhorred himself with sackcloch and Ashes he didn't feel better about himself afterwards he actually felt worse because the test exposed what was in his heart remember church he exalted himself above God he said God is unrighteous and I'm righteous see how that was still in his heart he got prideful I gave to the Widow I gave to the poor I sacrificed all this look how righteous I am and God's saying you still got some pride in there how many know you still got some pride in there you always raise your hands unless you want to all right let's be honest still had some pride left and yet God looked down and said God he's perfect right because of the sacrifice because of predestination because of election God knew he's going to get purged he's going to be on fire right he's going to get purged by the fire he's going to be made more like my my like my my character or my my image right he needed purging and he said you know these things came about me because of fear so he got a little he took his little lacks on Godzilla got a little lazy on God will say and then he started letting fear come in instead of praying about it he maybe got worried about it right or started talking with his wife about well boy if this happens that sure would be awful wouldn't it yeah let's not talk about that you know let's pray about it right let's not talk about that let's pray about it remember you know like Paul said we all need to take heed lest we fall and so just like job this is Temptations common to all men and women right so let me say like this you and I are going to come to a season where we're a little taking little lacks on God we get a little lazy on our prayer life little lays on our prayer reading right our Bible reading rather pray everything Bible reading you're a little lazy on our amens but listen church God is faithful and God said all things work together not some things all things work together even in my human element of getting lazy my human element being tired all things will still work together for my good amen God's already good but God's trying to make me good amen Hallelujah all things will work together for my good because God's already good I'm the one who needs to be better or gooder like brother Brooks would say don't get no gooder than that brother Brook said Hallelujah I'm the one that needs to be better and all things will work together for good to them that love the Lord we believe that right now this is what now here a little bit more on uh Hezekiah I just went a little bit but uh sometimes God isolates his anointing right but he never forsakes us right just like the Bible said the Holy Spirit can be grieved the Holy Spirit can be offended but then there's times where the holy spirit's not offended but he withdraws his Spirit from from us I feel that all the time like I said I wake I go to bed happy in the Lord I wake up I don't even feel like a Christian how did this happen I just danced around the church yesterday how could this happen I shouted till my throat hurt I praise God I I was I cried I wept how can this happen welcome to humanity welcome to the cycle of Revival actually death and Revival so he was left alone to be tempted right tested he wanted to see God wanted him to see what was still in his mind he still had pride in his mind look how great we are aren't we the greatest people on the face of the Earth the message people call themselves The Greatest about them my wife gave me a good thought on there even the Catholics don't say they're the greatest Christians of all time and dinner say if time goes on the Pentecostals will be way worse than the Catholics that's what program said now look at the message people today they'll say things even Catholics won't say we're the greatest Christians of all time even a Catholic or Baptist or Luther won't even say that isn't that something I was really inspired honey I thought that was inspired yeah see so God wants to see what's on your mind what do you where do you let your mind wander see God withdrew himself let me see what Hezekiah I'm going to give him 15 more years I'm going to bless him and honor him and I'm well he already knew but God's gonna say he's going to find out what's in his heart you don't see that with John the Baptist Glory right God withdrew his spirit and he said are you the Messiah or not don't worry that's a beautiful story amen I might as well preach on that Hallelujah are you the one or we look for another we read those in the scripture right yesterday and in John's weakest hour Christ gave him the greatest words of encouragement he could ever get praise God Amen Christian when word our weakest Jesus will do his best to encourage us amen he said go tell John he said he's more than a prophet Hallelujah he's a messenger of the Covenant and there's never been a prophet as great as him praise God Dory he got that last word right as he was going to get his head chopped off I imagine he was just like Paul oh death where's your thing amen my God has told me my God so am I six months of ministry God said I was the greatest it was all worth it soon I'll see Jesus face to face amen Glory Hallelujah in our weakest moments God will give us the best encouragement thank God Amen Hallelujah well of course that's on my mind because I got a human mind I'm going to struggle I need refined yeah but I'll say like this I'm a work in progress he's still working on me to make me what he wants me to be praise God Hezekiah has a guy could say the same thing but the preaching on this is to motivate you to stay dedicated to God Amen that we all stay dedicated to God hallelujah but understand Even in our trials when God we feel like God's presence have left he'll never forsake us he will bring us back to repentance he'll bring us back to our first love Glory I'll be in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon who sent unto him to inquire the wonder that was done in the land god left him God left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart see God already knew it was in his heart but God wanted Hezekiah look at these things you still think about look at these things you still meditate on right he was either 38 or 39. so this test case come sometime after he was 50. brother Brandon went through his complex about leaving the ministry or leaving leaving the churches rather he was still going to be a prophet at 54 years old 54. I'm 42. right and at 54 he was almost talked out to leaving the churches almost talked out of it oh I'm sorry I almost talked into leaving he's almost talked into the temptation of leaving the churches he said I'll just go live up in the wilderness all by myself I won't have to deal with all these people rejecting me and I'll just stomp down like Old Testament prophet and say thus saith the Lord and then walk back out and say see you guys had enough of that that rebellious spirit I don't want to deal with that rebellious spirit he almost walked away all right good Abraham David could admit adultery I think when he was 50 50. they already had eight other wives okay it's a snare Satan set the Trap but he was out of place in the season of War he wasn't in his battle he wasn't in his battle position in war we've got to stay in position Church don't lay down your armor Saints don't lay down that sword of the spear don't take off that Helm of Salvation keep fighting praise God hallelujah look when he was at ease there it is when he's at ease there it is that's when the Temptation came oh I'm not going to go out this year I'm getting too old or I don't know exactly what he said but he said I'm not going out this year I go out every year to fight I'm going out I always go up to pray every time I'm not going up to pray this time I'm not going into battle I'm not going to go battle for the Saints and the church said some people here are depending on your prayers right I'm depending on your prayers yeah yeah I know you're depending on mine where's Dave Dave where's David they were depending on him and he was out of position at 50. Abraham was past 75 when he let Ishmael right Hagar he let his wife talk him into taking another woman she convinced him their Camino Supernatural this can't happen we're Baron we this can't happen okay we'll try the natural route this must be God's will past 80. father of faith well you know I found a scripture today where the Bible said about Abraham the Bible said God called Abraham and Sarah and separated them alone unto himself amen hallelujah amen he said separate yourself from Babylon come out of shinar come to a place where you can dwell in my presence amen amen amen of course he had trials there too but he was way better off there in Cadence land the land of Melchizedek amen he's way better than the land of Melchizedek than the land of shinar yeah and church we're way better in the message of the hour praise God that in the Catholic church or the bar something like that God's blessed us we're the children of Abraham we're in the land of possession amen the land of the word hallelujah thank God but there's going to be a time God may leave you for a season not forsake you but just pull back his influence now I'm going to let this brother I'm let this sister see what's in their heart and mind and let me say like this church it is not a pretty thing when we see what's in our heart and Minds I think you can all say Amen to that so see Church even in the midst of our trials we're struggling but we're not defeated Hallelujah job was struggling but he sure wasn't going down he could ah Glory Satan could not get job to curse God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah that's what his wife said she was really going through the ringer I don't know if she was I imagine she was safe but she was really really the wrong spirit but he was struggling but he just kept going he just kept going kept going I want to talk to God I want God's presence I want to hear from God and finally he did wasn't what he wanted but he got it I think he got more than he asked for I think is what happened God rebuked him and asked him 60 some questions and he couldn't even answer one of them right he said where are the storehouses of snow where's snow made can you figure that one out job where where is snow made and where do those Lambs uh reproduce where do they give birth out there or I'm sorry the mountain goats where's all that happen Can you tame the Leviathan Can you tame the behemoth his Tail's like a cedar can he'll he laughs at you God said he laughs at you so if you can't understand all these things how can you understand the way I'm running this world come on you can't so just trust and Obey for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus but to trust in obey Hallelujah you can't understand the natural things how are you going to understand the spiritual things how was job going to understand the debate between God and the devil up there he won't understand it no right he wasn't going to understand he just had to learn how to trust and obey if God let me say like this if God wants you to know something he's going to let you know it sure if he doesn't let you know that he doesn't want you to know and he wants your faith to be made stronger even in not knowing Hallelujah right didn't the Bible say the Holy Ghost is going to guide you into all truth well that means if he don't let you know some truth then it wasn't part of your testimony you didn't need to know it for the Holy Ghost you didn't know it need to know for the Rapture but you'll know it later Hallelujah because you know you got unending ages amen you know you've got an eternity with Christ Hallelujah age after age he'll show you his mercy and his grace age after age Revolution after revolution oh it's a cycle of all blessings it's not a cycle of death and Revival it's a cycle of Greater blessing and greater blessing and more Revelation and more blessing it keeps going greater and greater and it never ends amen oh thank you Jesus for God who command the light to shine out of the darkness has shined in our hearts my heart's not full of darkness my heart's full of the light of God to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ that's the verse I used over there in Iowa and a man said you wouldn't even believe in brother Branham afterwards I said I believe in brother Branham but I felt let the Lord to preach this on Easter Sunday and little did he know a teenage girl come up to confess that she was sexually abused and he's mocking me there for not saying brother random enough and God just dealt with a sister revealed the thoughts and intents of her heart a secret sin nobody knew but God hallelujah thank God Amen I just got I just got I just got in the mind of Christ I thought this is a very strange Easter message I don't have a whole lot of quotes from Brother random on this one I was like that's the word well that's all I needed what's the word right but see how you get criticized you don't fit uh you don't fit the mode I don't want to fit man's mode I don't care what man says I care what God says amen Hallelujah you're not going to make me into the what preacher they want me to be I'm gonna be the preacher God called me to be praise God who would have thought that verse brought a teenager up I said you got to go approach that man she's like I fear for my life I said well then you got to have a plan to get out of town as soon as you tell him you better get out of town I said you might want to I said you need to I said you need to get the authorities involved Hallelujah thank God he's shining our hearts I had a resurrection in our hearts but we have this treasure in Earthen vessels that the Excellency of the power of God I'm sorry maybe of God and not of us we have no power of our own it's all God's power we are traveling on every side but I'm not distressed amen oh I'm perplexed but I'm not in despair I'm persecuted but not forsaken I'm cast out but Satan cannot stop me praise God he can't stop you praise God you might be in the midst of a trial a midst of a Temptation fiery manifold Temptations but you're still not defeated you're still the Overcomer praise God it's just going to make you more of an overcomer that's what these trials God has ordained that's what they're made to do they're make you more of an overcomer like with brother Austin if God allowed him to overcome the drugs and that lifestyle how much more is he going to overcome Hallelujah my life I had the alcohol the the addictions you know the evil magazines Evil movies Sports all these things and look what God has done with my life that's my testimony running the race for Christ I used to run for the World Sports but now I run that same way for Jesus I'll say like this I'm more dedicated to Jesus than I was Sports I worked hard but I didn't work that hard I wasn't like Kobe Bryant sleeping four days to four four hours a day and then working out uh 20 hours I didn't do that I wasn't insane like that but see we run for Christ we're we're gonna struggle we're going to go through these Temptations but Christ will help us overcome we're never defeated we're never left alone praise God we're we're we have a treasure thank God we have a treasure in our Earth and vessel praise God Hallelujah always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for which we live are always delivered unto death for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh that's why each day you feel like I've got to die to this passion I've got to die to this desire that's that's that's a part of Jesus death as you're learning to die out to things that's taking a taste of the death of Jesus he had to die out to every desire Brothers he wouldn't have a family it could have a family who you know of course he could have had a wife you know could have all these could have had a long life but he had to die out to that and we've got to die out to the will of God now here's a paradox Paul said God take this Thorn away from my flesh three times and Jesus said my grace is sufficient for you my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me he found the strength in the midst of his flesh the Temptation was in his flesh in the midst of the temptation of his flesh he still found ability to glory in God wonderful it's like for example like with brother awesome with the headache he still comes up here to prayer he still gives God praise Hallelujah I had that headache a few weeks ago I just danced right through it God well God was gracious and took it away and not that I deserved it right but I just chose to praise God I'm going to keep preaching I'm not going to quit I'm not going to give up I'm going to keep preaching praise God I'll Glory my infirmities therefore listen I take Pleasures in infirmity who does that who likes to get sick nobody but Paul learned here towards the end of his life I've learned to take pleasure in these things why because it's for Christ's sake it's forming Christ it's forming the character of Christ in my life I can recognize the Temptations in here but I can also see the victories up there praise God Amen Hallelujah I can see this is temporal your afflictions are temporary your afflictions are light praise God but your Victory and your blessings and your reward is great Hallelujah your trials are light your afflictions are temporary but your reward is eternal and your reward is an eternal weight of Glory Hallelujah for when I'm weak then I'm strong well this is the same idea remember Jesus said when you get persecuted when people say evil things about you go ahead and leap around the church I can't wait to see some leaping in here Hallelujah I can't wait somebody some of you gonna get some persecution maybe we'll be singing I'll see somebody dancing like oh they just got persecuted praise God hallelujah now I know what's going on in their life they're getting persecuted that's what Jesus said leap when you're persecuted because great is your reward in heaven so when brother and I went through this uh he went through this complex about leaving the ministry notice he was isolated in the car Billy Paul's sleeping he gets isolated in the car he was just talking about you know moving up up in the Colorado many miles away from civilization he sent a voice just like you here here as you hear mine it sounded so neurotically but I've got through expressing have ever told you anything that was right and a voice got to talking I was talking to him and it said carry out your plans and you'll be like that his stepbrother who was a bum if you carry out the plans of your complex it's going to lead to your ruination see church if God let us go through with our complexes we'd ruin ourselves thank God he corrects us out of our complexes amen thank God he rescues us out of our desires of our flesh and mind because else we be bums we'd have no hope we'd have no testimony right no reward he said Lord I don't want to be like that I don't I don't want to be a bum I like my brother-in-law Fletcher he and the Holy Spirit said your wife will go too your wife will leave you she won't live up there in them Hills like that and you'll become a bum just as a dream showed you would I said I don't want to be like that I don't want to have to live like that I want something different amen hallelujah he thought he wanted it but then when he when the Holy Spirit came to him he said I don't want that see how this church our flesh won things once things but our soul doesn't want it I was told that you called me to be a prophet I want to live in the wilderness like a prophet but it was my use of my own excuse so I could hunt and my own good look he was making excuses so he could enjoy sports more and the church said hunting is a sport his complex was centered around him having no Rebellion to his preaching and he could enjoy his Sports more make an excuse so he could enjoy the sports come on somebody I've walked into Master believer's houses they got a TV up there watching sports I'm like what is wrong with you guys you're messaging Believers there are some of these some of these same people will tell me how great the old days were and I'm like what about today today looks pretty awful they said they could pray all this time and sing all this time and do all these things I'm like what about what you've got sexy women on your what are you doing what see it's always talking about what God used to be let's let's have a god of right now oh God is moving my life right now amen he's just as sweet as me now as he was 10 years ago amen he gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by Hallelujah Glory don't tell me what he used to do tell me what he's what he used to you now and he said but that was prophets of the Old Testament so the holy spirit said you're not an Old Testament Prophet you're a new testament prophet you've been called to be in there at much higher office than that see New Testament prophets are higher he said you have more gifts besides that you was called to pray for the sick now bro that's what we're talking about Elijah's were men of the Wilderness but in the New Testament they can't be totally separated they got to be with the church brother man thought I can just leave the church and the Holy Spirit said no your new testament you've got to stay with the church because the Bible says gather more as you see as you see that day approaching and brother Brown would be breaking that scripture if he would have left the church right they were isolated with God and it was the Old Testament yes good brother good that's right very good Hallelujah he said you were called to pray for the gifts I'm sorry pray for the sick you have more gifts than the Old Testament prophets preach the gospel your Apostolic gospel or Apostolic prophet greater things greater gifts and now look the Holy Spirit rebukes him why do you wait for me to move you every time you move where's your reward and that's what I want to say where's our reward tonight Hallelujah where's our reward our reward is taking the word that we know and acting upon it praise God not running from the commission not making an excuse like we all do I'm not putting brother bam out there all by himself we all do it we all get tempted we all get complexes but we've got to choose to get back to the commission and sometimes God has to send out a voice down from heaven amen or sometimes God has to say no dream to you sometimes God has to bring a sermon and it just tells your whole life praise God what is it it's the grace of God it's the tender hand of Jehovah to get you back on the right track and to get you out of your complex and get you into a season where God can bless you praise God because you got yourself in the wrong thing praise God I got myself on the wrong thing I can say right Hallelujah he said you got like Moses you forgot the feeling of your people you forgot to call the call that I called you to I'm trying to close your church I don't have a lot to say today brother said I let this sick lay so brother I'm neglected sick people he said I want the Lord to tell me where to go and not to go that's wrong I built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message okay now did you catch that there's sometimes God's not going to tell you where to go like for me as a preacher I don't always know who to invite or where to go sometimes I know for sure and I see a Vindicated like Oh Glory Hallelujah are there times I don't why because God wants me to have a reward God wants me to pray and use the gifts of my life and wisdom in my life and seek God and then I get a reward for that right like God don't tell me why tell us why everything happens in our life we don't know we've got to overcome is that right Church see there's so see there's a rewards for overcoming your complexes oh that's a whole other sermon there the member Church we're not saved by feelings yet I've been preaching about all the feelings we get dancing and shouting but you're not saved by feelings well Ram said I'm not safe tonight because I get happy and Shout that isn't it I'm not saying because the gift of God works through me I'm saved because I met the conditions that Jesus Christ required of me I'm saved according to the Bible see is that right not because I feel like I'm safe Satan can whip you around the stump with your feelings now picture yourself how many times has Satan whipped you around the Sun keep going Jesse keep going I got you I'm whipping

around the stump like that but what you got to do get your Bible out praise God stop running from the devil and start speaking of the devil you're a liar and the father of Lies but my father is a god of creation amen hallelujah Glory he's the father of lies he's the father of Eternity he's the father of my life amen Satan can whip you around the stump on your feelings while I'm feeling depressed or I'm feeling tired I'm feeling upset I feel betrayed I feel jealous forget your feelings Satan can't beat you when you've got thus ain't the Lord amen he can't do go that he can't wait across that

are you gonna say that Satan that ain't true well I know you're a bluffer now I know you're not lying now because God told me he cares for me he can't wait across this sword does he just hold the sword out to him he ain't going to touch you he can't get to your mind just hold the sword out there yeah I'm not safe today because I can shout I'm not saying today because I'm I feel like I'm safe I'm saved because I met God's conditions in the Bible Jesus said he that Hearth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but pass from Death in the life I believe that that's right and on them conditions I'm saying because God said so the devil says you ain't saved God said I'm saved Hallelujah I'm trusting God's word I'm just saying what he said praise God hallelujah I'm just saying the Eternal Word that cannot fail praise God I'm trusting in somebody who doesn't lie like you Satan Hallelujah I don't believe Liars I believe the I believe the God who tells the truth I'm going to give my energy to believe in Liars failures rebellious ones accusers the Brethren I'm giving my time and energy to the way the truth and the life amen okay God said so if he told me I would say because somebody said a Russian Mighty Wind hit me in the face that's wonderful but I want to know where that Russian body wouldn't come from before it hit me in the face Hallelujah see now what kind of Life are you going to live after that Russia Mighty winds hits you see it's by your fruit you're known so if I dance up here that's great but now Satan wants to see how I'm going to live when I get home that's where I get to Victory I'll say like that that's where I keep the victory so I got the victory here amen Hallelujah I'm not saved tonight because I feel like I'm saved I'm saved tonight because I met God's requirements his word God is under obligation take care of me if I meet these requirements see God's going to take care of your church if you keep the word of God is that right well somebody says I'm saved because I feel good drunkers do that drunkards feel safe drunkards feel happy the devil can beat you around and around the stump on your feelings when that meets the word of God no sir he can't come on that God brought salvation Divine Healing so simple the weakest Christian can have every attribute of his life amen Divine Healing and salvation is so simple the weakest one here can believe it the children or whoever the weakest one because it's whosoever believeth praise God all it takes is belief all it takes is say I'm not going to believe a lie I'm not going to doubt I'm just going to believe the Bible said Faith like a child hallelujah how many times have I seen it Daddy you said you're going to get eggs or dad you said you're going to take us out for this daddy you said you're going to do that how many times I hear that all the time that's what I do I always keep my word they know I'm going to keep my word now sometimes they're wrong and I didn't promise I said maybe right but so simple believe the father's word believe God instead of the devil trust God's word that's how you know you're saved amen this is one of my favorite ones yeah listen brother you're never saved by any sign you're never saved by any sensation those are good it's good to have feelings and that's good but that's not what you're saying by you're saved when you meet God's condition of his word and nothing else are you saved by that's right God's word is made away you're not saved because you feel like you're saved I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved listen church because a lot of times I don't feel that way and the church said a prophet of God who would have to bite his finger when the angel came in a prophet of God who felt the tingling all the time the prophet of God who would go into Visions all the time he said a lot of times I don't even feel like I'm saved see when he stepped out of those Visions he got in the flesh and God had to leave him at times to test him just like Hezekiah just like everybody else a lot of times I don't even feel like I'm saved because he had to overcome I'm saved because God gave the promise I met God's conditions and upon God's holy word I can defeat Satan seven days a week and as many nights because it's God's word he said that's what the King of Kings said how many have passed from Death unto life the King of Kings says you'll not come into under condemnation all right I better find out it's already 8 30. let me see if I can find a place to close I had some I want to run over a few more thoughts here okay I just had two more main thoughts yeah let me just do this okay when I preach the Mighty Man series remember we have this we went over these scriptures these scriptures help us know that God is watching us and we're not alone we're not isolated right humble yourself under the mighty hand of God he may exalt you due time cast all your care on him for he cares for you don't live a stressed out life don't live a life full of anxiety tell God about your problems and say God I'm leaving them with you praise God I can't solve them I've tried to solve them uh you put you've proved to me I can't solve them so I'm giving them to you praise God because you care for me and church hasn't he cared for you all these years has he showed it year after year month after month service after service how much he does care so if he shows how much he cares let's start casting our cares on again because we're not alone he said fear not so don't be afraid little church it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom see sometimes I wonder are we going to see the latter rain well if I do if it comes in my day I am because I Fear God right I'm in God's Little Flock I'm not following all the the harling Shepherds hireling Shepherds I'm not following all the denominations I'm following the word of God and this encourages me right I know if I live to see the Rapture I'll go in it because it's God's pleasure to give me the kingdom I Fear God right I'm part of the little flock I'm not a part of the big denominations at mega churches I'm a part of God's Little Flock now this is a good one but I'm gonna this is more about Israel but remember this one this is so beautiful listen church yay I'll Rejoice over them to do them good speaking of Israel and I'll plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul I just love this verse God said I'm gonna put all my heart I'm going to put all my soul into getting Israel back to that natural land what about us praise God God's gonna put all of his heart all of his soul to make sure we go in the Rapture praise God all of him he's not going to put half of him he's not going to put half of his deity he's going to put all of himself he's going to put everything behind it praise God he's going to keep pressing and keep helping us and he's going to make sure we reach the goal praise God that ought to encourage everybody nothing could be greater than God's whole heart and soul what he what else could he say all right I'm gonna put all my money into making sure Israel gets back I'm gonna put all my cattles on the Hills as uh as a ransom so that you guys get back no I'm gonna put all my heart and soul into it it could put nothing more than that he didn't say I'm gonna put my wallet into it I'm gonna put my heart and soul into it and if he was that careful about Israel he's more careful about us now this one I didn't get to I want to get to this a few weeks ago for as a Young Man marries a virgin so shall thy Sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride so shall God Rejoice over you Hallelujah I laugh because I how happy I was to get married right all those years I want to get married a happy home and I can imagine what was I rejoicing I was rejoicing over getting married and now that was a human man what about a almighty God so the closest thing God could get to how much do I care about you how much do I Rejoice how much I love you was a man who can't wait to go get married so we should talk to Austin after service for some of those reminders right brother I'll bring my notepad so I can write down I'll preach it on Sunday well Simon's here I'll preach you next Wednesday God is rejoicing Over You Like a Man rejoices over his broad amen remember him say what does God do he whispers says love Seekers into his bride's ear amen he gives her gifts all the time amen he can't wait to be United with her praise God but there's a time and season for that but church just so you know you're not alone you want to be isolated with God and if you're isolated with God it's like a husband and wife praise God because he rejoices over you like a bridegroom rejoices over his bride can't get no sweeter than that praise God hallelujah Jesus said Lo I'm with you always let's all say that he's with me always ready he's with me always until the end of this church age to the end of the millennium he's with us through the end where there's no end to the Future home please with us at the end of the millennium and then beyond let your conversation be without covetousness be content with such things as you have for he said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so don't forget I'm closing here remember I showed you this a few weeks months ago Church the Bible said we're made to possess every gift right every every good and perfect gift is from the father we are blessed the Bible said Ephesians chapter 1 with all spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus praise God so today let's not be isolated let's not let's not let Temptation bring us into desperation or depression let's not be tempted to go I just want to feel sorry for myself let's let's avoid that temptation let's avoid feeling like God doesn't see us let's let's avoid that snare don't in other words don't get trapped in the snare of feeling like God doesn't see you no God does see you amen don't get trapped into feeling like God doesn't love you I just showed you he loves you with all of his heart and soul amen Hallelujah don't get trapped into doubting or having anxiety or feeling like you're gonna fail or feeling like you're lazy right don't get trapped into feeling like your afflictions will never end because they will don't get trapped into looking for Revenge don't get trapped in the lust don't get trapped into being impatient when's my time coming don't get trapped into feeling like I lack everything the Bible said contentment is a great game and don't get trapped into feeling like God has left me where is God he's Watching Over You Like a Shepherd Hallelujah Hallelujah he's making sure you won't be abandoned he's making sure you overcome the snare he's going to make sure you overcome this isolation Hallelujah he's going to make sure you get back to a place where it's just you and him as a bride and a

is be disciplined if you're hedged about with God don't get lazy on God right stay disciplined because God is doing something great in your life he's going to finish what he started how many believe that let's have a word of prayer here father God we thank you for tonight Lord God thank you that you're you've poured your whole heart and soul amen into your bride Dear God that's what you said as a
