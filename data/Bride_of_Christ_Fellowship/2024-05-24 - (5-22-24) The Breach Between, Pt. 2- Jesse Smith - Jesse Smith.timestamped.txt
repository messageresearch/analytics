[0:00] seven Church ages and the Seven Seals by
[0:02] God's
[0:14] grace Revelation chapter
[0:26] 5 let's go to verse five we'll start
[0:29] there by
[0:43] let's try to maybe we can all read verse
[0:45] 5 six and seven together let's try that
[0:47] by God's grace we'll read three verses
[0:49] here
[1:00] okay let's read verse 5 6 7 together
[1:03] ready 1 2 3 and one of the elders saith
[1:06] unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the
[1:10] tribe of Judah the root of David hath
[1:14] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[1:17] the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and
[1:21] lo in the midst of the throne and of the
[1:24] four beasts and in the midst of the
[1:26] elders stood a lamb as it had been said
[1:29] slain having seven horns and seven eyes
[1:34] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[1:37] forth into all the Earth and he came and
[1:40] took the book out of the right hand of
[1:43] him that sat upon the throne amen may
[1:46] God add his Blessing to the reading of
[1:48] this Thy word Lord may be seated
[1:50] Hallelujah bless our word Lord here
[1:53] tonight
[1:58] hallelu so just a really Brief Review U
[2:01] we looked at on Sunday uh the breach
[2:03] between the seven Church ages and Seven
[2:05] Seals the breach means a gap and brother
[2:08] R this is not the Seven Seals or the
[2:10] church ages it's the Gap in between
[2:12] there but as we'll see tonight this is
[2:14] actually very uh this is connected to
[2:16] the Seven Seals because this is the time
[2:18] when the lamb takes the book and that's
[2:20] the seven seal books there is a
[2:22] connection but brother man's just
[2:23] pointing out you know between the church
[2:25] ages and the seals there's this breach
[2:27] here or this Gap and it deals with of
[2:29] course chapter four which are the things
[2:31] that should be Hereafter John being
[2:33] caught up and then the enthroned elders
[2:35] and then the four living creatures then
[2:37] chapter four then chapter five is the
[2:39] seven seal book Hallelujah and Christ
[2:41] coming to take the seven seal book amen
[2:44] uh we looked at how the book of
[2:45] redemption is the main thing uh of this
[2:48] sermon here from brother brandham and
[2:50] then brother Ram dealt immediately with
[2:52] Revelation 10 after reading his text and
[2:55] showing how uh the seventh Church age
[2:57] Messenger will be on earth when this
[2:59] book is revealed revealed hallelujah
[3:01] amen so people that say the Seven Seals
[3:03] are not revealed uh they they're going
[3:05] against that quotation right they're
[3:06] going against that but we don't want to
[3:08] go with it I'm sorry we don't want to go
[3:09] against it we want to go with the word
[3:10] of God hallelujah and we saw that how
[3:12] though some may say Jesus is here in
[3:14] some ways and yes in one way is Spirits
[3:16] here uh we saw that we're still looking
[3:18] for the Corporal body hallelujah we're
[3:20] still looking to Heaven brother Ram said
[3:22] for the coming of the Corporal body
[3:23] Hallelujah so we don't want to get
[3:24] caught up in false doctrines and false
[3:26] moves and so forth and thank God we're
[3:28] not uh we're thankful that the kinsman
[3:31] redeemer is what we see in this chapter
[3:34] brother Ram of course dealt with uh Ruth
[3:36] and Naomi and Boaz Hallelujah as we
[3:39] looked at at the end there and I didn't
[3:41] spend a lot of time on that I'm not
[3:42] going to spend a lot of time on that
[3:43] either tonight I just kind of felt led
[3:44] to go to these other routes here uh but
[3:47] we see Revelation five reveals the
[3:50] kinsman redeemer I'll say like this the
[3:51] true kinsman redeemer right because
[3:54] although Boaz was a wonderful kinsman
[3:56] redeemer Boaz died right Boaz sinned
[4:00] but there came a kinsman redeemer that
[4:02] never sinned hallelujah amen there came
[4:04] a kinsman redeemer that could redeem
[4:06] more than just Ruth and Naomi there
[4:08] there came a kinsman redeemer that could
[4:09] reveal all of us redeem all of us
[4:11] Hallelujah by the grace of God think of
[4:13] that from the dawn of time till now
[4:15] these 6,000 years of human history that
[4:18] one great kinsman redeemer the Divine
[4:20] kinsman redeemer was able to redeem all
[4:22] of us hallelujah there's power in the
[4:24] blood of Jesus tonight amen and we know
[4:26] that you know law had requirements and
[4:28] there were very strict requirements no
[4:29] one could meet it Grace met the
[4:32] requirements Hallelujah and then we saw
[4:34] again how uh Boaz was a type and I just
[4:38] thought that was beautiful wasn't it
[4:39] beautiful just to see how uh Boaz was so
[4:41] thankful for the respect that uh Ruth
[4:43] had shown to the word of God wasn't that
[4:45] beautiful just a real beautiful love
[4:47] story Hallelujah that God places in
[4:49] there and she respected the headship of
[4:52] her previous husband so much so uh that
[4:55] God honored her by giving her a Boaz
[4:58] Hallelujah and that's just one thing IID
[4:59] like to here thank God that we respect
[5:01] the headship of the word of God
[5:03] hallelujah remember I preach this in the
[5:06] uh in the series on the
[5:07] Mysteries every other denomination they
[5:10] have a head but it's not the it's not
[5:12] Christ it's their Creeds their headship
[5:15] is not God because if it would if it was
[5:18] they'd accept all the revelations of the
[5:20] Bible right and that's one of those
[5:22] great types I saw there in re in
[5:24] Ephesians chapter 5 the head of the
[5:26] woman is Christ the head of the church
[5:29] is Christ
[5:30] so the the word of God is our absolute
[5:33] amen not a Creed not an idea not a
[5:35] tradition of man not a saying not a
[5:37] writing from a church father but our
[5:39] absolute is the headship of Jesus Christ
[5:41] the word amen hallelujah I just thought
[5:45] for me I just want to place that in
[5:46] there a little more uh emphasis there by
[5:49] God's grace Hallelujah that's our
[5:51] headship that's why we type or the
[5:52] anti-type of Ruth Ruth is the type we're
[5:55] the anti-type Hallelujah does the Bible
[5:58] say in Romans 7 we areed married to sin
[6:00] remember that but the Bible said that
[6:02] that husband has died now we can be
[6:05] married to Christ hallelujah amen we
[6:07] should be married to another Hallelujah
[6:10] the one who died and rose again that's
[6:11] who we're married to hallelujah amen oh
[6:14] my it's an invisible Union hallelujah
[6:16] praise God there's coming a day though
[6:19] when our face shall be sight Hallelujah
[6:21] and it will be a visible Union amen the
[6:24] Bible said when we were when when we're
[6:25] with Christ when we meet him in the air
[6:27] we shall ever be with the Lord
[6:28] hallelujah amen amen my what a
[6:33] blessing now the next thought and this
[6:36] is the one I kind of skipped over Sunday
[6:37] because I I knew I had a little more on
[6:39] this and I didn't uh go into this one
[6:41] real depth real in depth but it kind of
[6:43] ties in actually pretty quite similarly
[6:45] with this this song that we've been
[6:47] preaching through right the song uh
[6:50] recognizing you today serpent seed
[6:52] perfect Faith now we're on the breach
[6:54] but this tied imperfectly and believe it
[6:56] or not did anybody listen to uh the
[6:57] breach this week okay Believe It or Not
[7:00] brother random when he reads about the
[7:02] kinsman redeemer his statement is about
[7:05] serpent seed which I preached a few
[7:07] weeks
[7:08] ago brother BR said oh when I think of
[7:11] that scripture now let's go to the
[7:12] scripture he's talking about uh
[7:14] Revelation
[7:16] 5 verse uh 9 and 10 and they sung a new
[7:20] song saying thou are worthy to take the
[7:21] book and to open the seals thereof for
[7:23] thou was slain and H has redeemed us to
[7:25] God by thy blood amen out of every
[7:28] kindred and tongue and people and nation
[7:32] and has made us unto our God Kings and
[7:35] Priests and we shall reign on the earth
[7:39] Hallelujah this is a beautiful thought I
[7:41] never I never really caught this if I
[7:43] did I forgot it but brother R says oh
[7:45] when I think of that scripture for thou
[7:47] has redeemed us back to God and we may
[7:49] Reign and be Kings and Priests on the
[7:51] earth did you catch that these Saints
[7:54] are now saying we you've redeemed back
[7:57] what Adam lost Adam was the the original
[8:00] King Adam was the original priest and
[8:02] now by the blood of Jesus Christ he
[8:04] gives it back to us hallelujah he
[8:07] restores us back now of course this is
[8:08] for the Millennium but right now we're
[8:10] spiritual Kings and Priests but the
[8:12] Millennium will be natural and spiritual
[8:14] Kings and Priests it'll be just like the
[8:16] first day amen hallelujah Glory
[8:18] Hallelujah it'll be that honeymoon
[8:20] Hallelujah that thousand year honeymoon
[8:22] the millennial rain and the Bible said
[8:24] we reign as kings and Priests on the
[8:27] earth back with the same Dominion that
[8:29] Adam had hallelujah
[8:31] amen it's all connected to this seven
[8:34] seal book this Revelation and brother
[8:36] Adam gave it to us with thus sayith the
[8:38] Lord hallelujah oh my thank God I think
[8:42] about it sometimes it just it's
[8:43] overwhelming my goodness oh my what the
[8:47] kinsman redeemer oh what a story we
[8:49] would have here he says notice the law
[8:51] required a kinsman redeemer to redeem a
[8:53] law substance Grace met this requirement
[8:55] in the person of Jesus Christ a Kinsman
[8:58] must be born
[8:59] of the human race
[9:02] Hallelujah he said and now now he could
[9:05] we could be when every man that's born
[9:07] anybody that couldn't see that it was
[9:09] adultery well there well is totally
[9:11] blind because every man that was born
[9:13] was born of a woman so this is an
[9:15] amazing thought and I never really
[9:17] caught it I've been preaching all these
[9:18] years I've been preaching 20 years and
[9:20] I'm going to share this in just a moment
[9:22] but I've always wondered why would
[9:23] brother Brandon bring in serpent SE to
[9:26] the Seven
[9:28] Seals and I just might as well read the
[9:30] quotes right now here's a quote this one
[9:32] stumped me for years Saints from a sham
[9:33] 1965 July
[9:35] 11th there he is with them Angels he's
[9:37] talking about that picture of the cloud
[9:39] out there which is a supernatural Cloud
[9:41] the message which was the seven breaking
[9:44] of them Seven Seals that revealed
[9:45] serpent seed and all these things here
[9:47] now that always stumbled me the Seven
[9:51] Seals revealed the serpent seed because
[9:53] I think about the first seal I think
[9:55] about the second seal now I don't see
[9:56] any serpent seed in there third seal
[9:58] anybody try think of them now four seal
[10:01] this six seven like I don't see any
[10:03] serpent seed in there and then all all
[10:06] on the way to drive the church on Sunday
[10:07] morning it struck me while I'm sitting
[10:09] there praising God the serpent seed is
[10:11] seen in chapter five because no man is
[10:14] worthy it's hidden in there and because
[10:17] every man was born of Woman except Adam
[10:21] and then he sinned so we see the seed of
[10:25] the woman not the seed of the serpent
[10:27] the seed of the woman is the only one
[10:29] who could Prevail hallelujah oh oh I
[10:32] hope you see it by God's grace no one
[10:34] was worthy so it took a virgin born
[10:37] kinsman redeemer the seed of the woman
[10:40] Genesis 3:15 Hallelujah not the seed of
[10:43] the serpent the seed of the woman so
[10:44] right there serpent seed is in it
[10:47] because of the evil of serpent seed at
[10:48] the beginning God had to create a
[10:50] kinsman redeemer he created his own son
[10:53] Hallelujah and he sent that son to
[10:55] redeem us back to
[10:56] God oh 20 years of preaching and I got
[10:59] the Revelation driving to church
[11:01] amen oh my it's amazing amen I didn't
[11:05] get to it I wonder that for 20 years why
[11:06] did Brother Ram say serpent seed with
[11:08] those Seven Seals I never saw it before
[11:10] until Sunday now you all might be way
[11:12] ahead of me but let me Rejoice for a few
[11:14] minutes if you already saw that
[11:16] hallelujah hallelujah he said he said
[11:20] there's this covering he says Seven
[11:21] Seals and revealed serpent seeds Seven
[11:23] Seals rais for serpent seed yes it did
[11:26] chapter 5 and it shows that it is his
[11:28] very ing his supreme authority that
[11:31] cloud is the supreme authority the head
[11:34] like a cloud he said the Supreme he's
[11:36] the wigged one the Bible said he changed
[11:38] his countenance and changed himself
[11:39] amorph the word comes from the Greek
[11:41] word
[11:43] Amor he said God is changing his mask
[11:46] and doing another act you know we went
[11:48] to a play we had a field trip at our
[11:50] school we went to a play and this one
[11:51] guy changed his mask about seven or
[11:53] eight times and by the end he was
[11:55] sweating I thought wow that's just like
[11:58] Christ right you see Christ in in Adam
[12:00] in Adam's life you see Christ in Noah's
[12:03] life you see Christ in Abraham he keeps
[12:05] changing his mask but God don't sweat
[12:06] Hallelujah God don't get tired amen he
[12:09] don't sleep nor does he get weary amen
[12:11] he's always there when we need him
[12:13] Hallelujah he always shows up he changes
[12:15] his mask Hallelujah he manifests himself
[12:18] Hallelujah I was just reading this week
[12:19] again how he hides himself so many times
[12:21] in scripture remember in John chapter 5
[12:23] he healed that man that blind man and
[12:26] then the Pharisees kick him out of
[12:27] church he says who are you to teach te
[12:29] us the fair that's that demonic uh
[12:31] spirit from the spirit of the serpent
[12:32] you can't teach them nothing they think
[12:34] they know it all but he said who are you
[12:36] to teach us get out of here and the
[12:38] Bible said then Jesus went and found him
[12:40] because Jesus was
[12:41] hiding oh God my Hallelujah and then he
[12:44] revealed himself he said he saidh do you
[12:46] believe in the Son of God he said I I
[12:47] don't know who he is he said the one
[12:48] that speaks to you is the Son of God
[12:50] Church the one that opened our eyes is
[12:52] the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah the Son
[12:54] of God
[12:55] Amen so
[12:57] true and that remember he hid himself uh
[13:01] on the on the road toas he act like he
[13:03] was going to walk away remember that he
[13:05] act like he's going to walk away
[13:07] sometimes God's acting like he's going
[13:08] to leave our presence to see if we want
[13:10] him to stay Hallelujah so what do we got
[13:13] to do we got to invite him back Jesus
[13:14] don't leave me Jesus stay with me keep
[13:17] your anointing on me praise God remember
[13:20] remember out there on the sea of giley
[13:21] he act like he was going to walk by he's
[13:24] actually walking by his disciples in
[13:25] their boat in the storm he's walking by
[13:28] like not not even looking at him right
[13:31] what does he do he wants you to cry out
[13:33] Amen brother man said God likes it when
[13:35] we're like children and we cry out for
[13:37] his Blessing Hallelujah God wants us to
[13:39] cry out and say I Need You Jesus Lord I
[13:42] need you every hour I need you amen oh
[13:47] Hallelujah there he is changing his mask
[13:49] here's another beautiful one along the
[13:51] same lines these two quotes always stump
[13:53] me there's probably
[13:54] others what a day what a time we're
[13:56] living this great mystery of God being
[13:58] finished bringing in the godhead showing
[14:01] what it is how these little isms and
[14:03] went off and made this and somebody made
[14:04] him this and somebody made him that but
[14:07] the angel Lord came down and brought up
[14:09] all their isms and pulled out that truth
[14:11] of it that's exactly right and presented
[14:13] it and there it is just as perfect as it
[14:16] can be no other way you could go there
[14:18] it is that's what he is see serpent seed
[14:21] all these different things that's been
[14:22] so mysterious among the people see what
[14:24] it is it's the sign to unite he says
[14:29] Hallelujah that's what we've been doing
[14:30] Church in our lives we've been uniting
[14:32] with the
[14:33] word right everybody okay tonight by
[14:35] God's grace amen all right did I say
[14:38] something wrong Hallelujah well if I
[14:40] said something right you can say Amen to
[14:42] it hallelujah amen sign to unite and
[14:46] that's what uh William and uh beatress
[14:48] have been doing since they come in the
[14:49] message they've been uniting with the
[14:51] word and now here our next Generation
[14:54] what are we doing we're uniting with the
[14:57] word I need more of the word
[14:59] I want to be with the word I want the
[15:01] word in me praise God I want to speak
[15:03] the word I want to live the word I want
[15:05] to do the word hallelujah but notice he
[15:08] ties
[15:09] in oh now he ties in the godhead with
[15:11] the seals the godhead is in the seals I
[15:15] had to go look but I found it before
[15:16] service
[15:17] hallelujah
[15:19] amen my goodness it's amazing so now now
[15:23] now now that I see the serpent seene in
[15:25] Revelation chapter 5 and I just was I
[15:27] was praying up here it just kind of
[15:28] struck me so I wrote them down so we see
[15:29] the serpent seed in Revelation 5 that's
[15:31] part of the
[15:32] seals we see the godhead in Revelation 5
[15:36] because it's the line of the tribe of
[15:37] Judah and the root of David so somebody
[15:40] was before
[15:41] David and we know Jesus told us in the
[15:44] in the uh in in the gospels who that was
[15:47] who's the root and offspring of David
[15:49] who came before David and after David
[15:51] that's no man that's got to be God
[15:53] hallelujah is that right amen so the God
[15:56] and then and then Jesus comes and takes
[15:59] the book out of the right hand of him
[16:00] that sits on the throne now we know
[16:02] God's
[16:03] invisible right so we don't we don't
[16:05] know there there wasn't there wasn't
[16:07] like a uh we we don't know what the
[16:09] throne was like but somehow Jesus comes
[16:11] like a lamb and he comes and brother man
[16:13] said he proceeded out of Eternity amen
[16:16] hallelujah brother said he proceeded out
[16:18] of Eternity and come come forth from the
[16:20] intercessory Chambers the Bible said
[16:23] remember there's the Bible said your
[16:24] hope is in the is in the holiest of
[16:26] holies your hope anchors in heaven
[16:28] remember that that from
[16:29] Hebrews so out of the throne comes forth
[16:32] the lamb and the lamb takes the book and
[16:34] he comes to open the book amen oh my
[16:38] there's the godhead not two persons not
[16:41] three persons didn't say there was a
[16:43] dove there and an old man there people
[16:45] confuse Daniel chapter 7 but it all
[16:47] works together if you got a spiritual
[16:48] mind Hallelujah so there the godhead is
[16:51] in Revelation chapter 5 as
[16:53] well the church ages are in the seals
[16:56] because the four beasts are the four
[16:57] anointings on the church ages
[16:59] and the church said the oil and wine is
[17:02] in the third seal what's that what's the
[17:04] oil the baptism of the Holy
[17:06] Ghost you don't get the Holy Ghost when
[17:08] you first get saved you got to be
[17:09] Sanctified you then you got to be filled
[17:12] Hallelujah Glory so many people can't
[17:14] see that they're blind they're blinded
[17:16] by the the systems of this world but
[17:18] thank God your eyes can see
[17:20] hallelujah oh my thank God the baptism
[17:24] of the Holy Ghost are in the seals
[17:26] amen hallelujah so is the god so serpent
[17:29] seed so is the church ages Israel's
[17:32] blindness that's a big topic right
[17:34] Romans 11 Hallelujah Romans 10 Romans N9
[17:38] Ephesians 2 Ephesians 3 is and then the
[17:41] fifth seal is Israel's blindness
[17:43] Hallelujah the mystery of iniquity the
[17:46] White Horse right that's the Antichrist
[17:49] Spirit that's the mystery of iniquity
[17:51] that's what the Antichrist does it
[17:53] commits
[17:54] iniquity Hallelujah and then you got the
[17:57] Rapture the Rapture is a seven SE seal
[17:59] oh my no wonder Bram could say when
[18:01] those seals broke it it finished the
[18:03] whole mystery of God it ties all these
[18:05] things together every other Doctrine can
[18:08] be tied in together perfectly and we've
[18:10] got the mind of Christ oh my Hallelujah
[18:13] now while I'm on this I'm going to read
[18:15] a few things here uh by God's
[18:20] grace because the serpent seed remember
[18:22] and I was reading it just tiing it with
[18:24] everything I was reading here this week
[18:26] I was reading I'm reading through the
[18:27] Book of John the Gospel of John
[18:29] and Jesus is speaking to
[18:31] Pharisees we know there's a lot of
[18:33] Pharisees out there today Jesus proved
[18:34] it Jesus said few there be that find the
[18:36] narrow road so that means most people
[18:38] associated with churches are Pharisees
[18:40] going to hell it's sad to say that but
[18:42] that's what Jesus said not what I said
[18:45] Jesus said few there find the the narrow
[18:47] road that leads to
[18:48] life
[18:50] right but notice what Jesus told these
[18:52] phes he says in in uh John 8:23 you are
[18:56] from beneath I am from above
[18:59] this is the part where Jesus is not
[19:00] pulling punches with these
[19:02] Pharisees Hallelujah if you believe not
[19:05] I am he you shall die in your
[19:09] sins he said uh verse 37 I know you are
[19:12] Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me
[19:15] because my word has no place in you so
[19:17] see what are the attributes they want to
[19:19] kill they want to silence God Jesus
[19:23] Hallelujah he said if you were Abraham's
[19:26] children in verse 39 you do the works of
[19:28] Abraham
[19:29] Hallelujah he said vers verse 41 you do
[19:32] the Deeds of your father Oh my he said
[19:36] if God were your father you would love
[19:38] me for I proceeded forth and came from
[19:40] God in verse
[19:41] 42 verse 43 he says why do you not
[19:43] understand my speech even because you
[19:45] cannot hear my word now I'm talking
[19:46] about Pharisees I'm talking about people
[19:48] that go to church and they can't
[19:50] understand the word of God blessed are
[19:52] your ears for you can understand
[19:55] Hallelujah because look this is the
[19:58] dominant Spirit of this day people that
[20:00] go to church claim to know all about it
[20:03] but you can't teach them anything they
[20:04] can't learn new
[20:06] revelation and they're going to hell if
[20:08] they don't
[20:10] repent right the majority few there be
[20:14] that find the narrow road my verse 44
[20:17] and ye are of your father the devil
[20:19] because the lust of your father ye will
[20:21] do see outwardly they had it all good
[20:24] but inwardly Jesus said they were dead
[20:25] men's bones inwardly they wanted best
[20:29] seats in the market right they wanted
[20:30] the greetings in the market they wanted
[20:32] the best clothes and they uh they cared
[20:35] so much about the little things and they
[20:37] left out the bigger things of the
[20:39] gospel and they wanted everybody else to
[20:41] do the work but the Jesus said you
[20:43] wouldn't even lift a
[20:44] finger let's not forget many times we're
[20:47] surrounded by these people is that right
[20:51] Church Hallelujah remember I went
[20:53] through that list of 110 false doctrines
[20:55] a lot of those deal with sanctification
[20:58] so most most Pharisee churches today
[21:00] allow people to sin and we can go
[21:02] through the list in 1 Corinthians 6 and
[21:04] Galatians chapter 5 fornication adultery
[21:08] homosexuality right revilers heresies
[21:11] all these things that's the mark of
[21:14] people that are uh under the Pharisee
[21:17] spirit thank God we've got the Holy
[21:19] Spirit hallelujah hallelujah amen this
[21:22] is what separated them verse 47 he that
[21:25] is of God hears God's word amen that's
[21:29] why we can see serpent seed and godhead
[21:31] and the rapture we can see all that in
[21:33] the Seven Seals
[21:35] Hallelujah because we we know God's word
[21:38] hallelujah oh my it's creating a greater
[21:41] separation every day right the Bible
[21:43] said this they're getting darker we're
[21:45] getting lighter they're becoming more
[21:47] like the beneath we're rising up on that
[21:49] stature Hallelujah ready to unite with
[21:51] the Capstone hallelujah amen we're
[21:53] building up in here ready to unite with
[21:56] the Capstone hallelujah we're uniting
[21:58] with the word of God
[22:00] hallelujah
[22:03] amen they said he's got a devil verse 49
[22:05] Jesus answered I not a devil but I honor
[22:08] my father and you dishonor
[22:09] me
[22:12] Hallelujah then he he just uh he he does
[22:15] a mic drop at the
[22:16] end he said I he said Abraham saw my day
[22:19] and was glad he said you're 50 years old
[22:21] have you seen Abraham he said before
[22:22] Abraham was I
[22:24] am amen mic drop right there Hallelujah
[22:28] and then they they they tried to get him
[22:29] but what the Bible said he hid himself
[22:31] there it is amen God hiding himself in
[22:33] Simplicity Hallelujah God hides himself
[22:36] in the word the simple Bible Revelation
[22:39] God is hiding himself tonight hallelujah
[22:41] thank God that we can find him
[22:43] Hallelujah the Pharisees will never find
[22:46] him now remember I have uh how many I
[22:48] got there's six attributes I put in my
[22:51] book about the uh attributes of serpent
[22:54] seed I thought I'd go through this
[22:56] because brother saw serpent seed in here
[22:59] Hallelujah and I showed you the nine
[23:00] proofs a few weeks ago when I preach on
[23:01] serpent seed right number one the
[23:04] serpent seed they go through they're
[23:05] Lawless and they go through vain
[23:07] beautiful religious acts uh and create
[23:09] their own Traditions that's the first
[23:11] attribute I lift Cain there's all the I
[23:13] mean there's all these Bible verses in
[23:14] here footnote upon
[23:16] footnote second they do not abide in the
[23:19] truth and therefore they despise the
[23:22] truth right that's why we got to be
[23:24] careful when people leave a message
[23:25] church or you know they got to be
[23:27] careful they can take the wrong
[23:29] Spirits right that's 1 Timothy 4:1 if
[23:32] you accept a false Doctrine you've got a
[23:34] seducing
[23:35] Spirit right or even somebody in a
[23:38] message church right number three the
[23:42] Lawless deny the full power of the Holy
[23:45] Spirit the Bible said they deny the
[23:47] power thereof they have a form of
[23:49] godliness but deny the power thereof
[23:52] amen any anyone need God's power
[23:54] Hallelujah see they want to shut down
[23:56] God's power but we've got to cry out for
[23:58] for God's power amen they deny it they
[24:01] don't want it they get used to not
[24:03] having it we've got to cry out for it
[24:05] Hallelujah number four Satan's Children
[24:07] lie that's what Jesus said there are
[24:10] their father the devil Liars Hallelujah
[24:14] fifth they persecute and kill the
[24:17] righteous and if they can't kill you
[24:19] physically they try to silence you like
[24:20] herodias silenced John the Baptist that
[24:23] Spirit of Elijah oh can you see it today
[24:27] Hallelujah everybody see
[24:29] today oh my thank you Lord thank you
[24:33] Jesus amen woo Hallelujah that made me
[24:36] happy because I want to hear the spirit
[24:38] of Elijah Hallelujah we get to hear it
[24:40] praise God Amen oh
[24:44] my so brother man said anyone that can't
[24:46] see that was adultery they're totally
[24:48] blind because every other man in
[24:50] Revelation 5 was born of a woman it
[24:52] required a kinsman
[24:54] redeemer he said every man on Earth was
[24:57] born of a man a woman of an act I'm
[24:59] taking out some of the words for the
[25:00] children he said now you don't don't see
[25:03] now don't you see that's where it come
[25:04] from that's where sin started so see
[25:06] where it's at now then there he comes
[25:09] your seed of the serpent in so that's
[25:11] where Cain came in right it was in the
[25:14] garden but Jesus was promised 4,000
[25:17] years later I'll send the seed of the
[25:19] woman and he'll crush the Serpent's head
[25:22] church that doesn't mean uh kill
[25:24] physically it means to stop the
[25:27] influence Jesus Jesus has delivered us
[25:29] from the influence of Satan oh
[25:31] Hallelujah my thank the Lord
[25:37] amen hallelujah now the the scripture I
[25:41] want you pull up is second Peter 1:4
[25:43] we've been getting some good timely
[25:44] scriptures out of second Peter 1 lately
[25:47] I forget the other one but somebody
[25:48] found it might have been Malachi
[25:49] somebody found me might have been
[25:51] Lydia oh yeah yeah the uh life he's
[25:54] given to us life and godliness all
[25:55] things that pertain to life and
[25:56] godliness yes that's right Hallelujah
[25:58] that I think that was at Junction City
[25:59] when the Holy Spirit brought that to
[26:01] us in other words uh yeah Jesus said
[26:04] John 16:13 the Holy Ghost will guide you
[26:07] into all truth how many believe that but
[26:09] that doesn't mean like you'll know every
[26:10] secret like the Rapture or you know the
[26:12] new name it just means everything Glory
[26:14] that pertains to life and godliness God
[26:16] will guide you into
[26:18] it right let's let's find that one can
[26:20] you find the scripture about life and
[26:21] godliness is that is that verse three
[26:23] he's given to or is it verse
[26:26] five pertaining to life and godliness
[26:29] is that it yeah according as divine
[26:32] power hath given unto us all things that
[26:34] pertain to life and godliness and the
[26:35] church said God will guide you into the
[26:38] truth but it's not every single thing in
[26:40] the every knowledge every single fact or
[26:42] Revelation but it's all the life and
[26:44] godliness you need for today and your
[26:47] lifetime Hallelujah think about that
[26:48] Martin Luther John Wesley they didn't
[26:50] have the Seven Seals open right but they
[26:53] had all things that they needed for a
[26:55] Godly life hallelujah amen oh my thank
[26:58] the Lord Lord Heen
[27:00] now so now I can finally understand why
[27:02] brother Ram connected serpent seed with
[27:05] the seals it just struck me on Sunday
[27:07] morning Hallelujah so corruption came by
[27:11] lust let's read verse four sorry how did
[27:13] Sin get in the world the Bible said lust
[27:16] I don't know anyone that's lusted after
[27:18] an
[27:20] apple
[27:21] right I mean it's it's very clear the
[27:24] the the words that God uses see we we we
[27:27] you know Jesus gave us these promises
[27:29] that we might be partakers of divine
[27:30] nature having escaped the corruption
[27:32] that's in the world through lust lust so
[27:36] we can see it
[27:39] plainly
[27:41] now corruption came in the world by lust
[27:44] so adultery but Redemption came by
[27:48] virginity or Purity right Redemption
[27:51] came by the seed of the woman corruption
[27:54] came by the serpent seed so so no man
[27:57] was a able to look on the book get that
[27:59] Dominion back get that eternal life back
[28:01] no one was able to look on it except a
[28:04] seed of a woman that was created for
[28:06] that purpose hallelujah oh my amen
[28:10] hallelujah so now I can I might make a
[28:13] video about that one next week by God's
[28:14] grace Hallelujah because I like to share
[28:16] these fresh Revelations like oh I never
[28:17] seen it and then today while I'm praying
[28:19] I'm like there's one two three four five
[28:21] six seven eight major maybe major is not
[28:24] the best word but eight very important
[28:26] teachings Hallelujah re Revelations even
[28:29] Mysteries right godheads a mystery
[28:31] Rapture is a mystery Israel's blindness
[28:32] is a mystery Church ages are mystery
[28:34] serpent part of the mystery of iniquity
[28:36] mystery of iniquities mystery so those
[28:39] are all right there in a part of the
[28:41] Seven Seals amen all right
[28:44] now uh acts
[28:48] 2028 brother said now notice now he must
[28:51] be Kinsman so you see an angel couldn't
[28:53] do it a man couldn't do it well it must
[28:56] be a man but he can't be born of a woman
[28:59] of a male and female act so the Virgin
[29:02] birth the Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary
[29:05] therefore Jesus was not a Jew Jesus was
[29:07] not a gentile Jesus was God Amen
[29:11] Hallelujah that right that's exactly his
[29:14] blood didn't come from a human uh
[29:17] Marriage
[29:18] Act he was the Holy created blood of God
[29:22] and we're not saved by Jewish blood nor
[29:25] by Gentile blood we're saved by the
[29:27] blood of God that's according to the
[29:29] Bible it says so hallelujah oh where
[29:32] does it say that in Acts chapter 20
[29:34] Hallelujah take heed this is Paul's last
[29:36] message to the Ephesians right we want
[29:38] to be Ephesians we want to be mature
[29:39] Christians right you forget about that
[29:41] lately I I did take Eed therefore unto
[29:44] yourselves and to all the flock over
[29:46] which the Holy Ghost has made you
[29:48] overseer so that's what a minister we're
[29:49] supposed to oversee and make sure
[29:51] everybody's doing good by God's grace
[29:53] everybody's feeding on the word of God
[29:56] watch over the flock make sure sure
[29:58] everybody's doing good by God's grace
[30:00] feed them the word of
[30:03] God to feed the Church of God which he
[30:06] has purchased with his own blood so that
[30:10] wasn't Mary's blood it wasn't Joseph's
[30:12] blood it was the blood of God hallelujah
[30:15] and the church said so the real kinsman
[30:18] redeemer didn't have blood from a
[30:19] natural man and woman he had blood from
[30:21] God hallelujah created blood amen that's
[30:25] what brother says he said
[30:28] so you see Jesus was God he was not no
[30:30] third person I like that grammar not no
[30:33] third person fourth person second person
[30:35] he was the person he was God see he was
[30:38] God Emanuel God come down from his glory
[30:40] revealed himself I love that song of
[30:42] Booth cliber uh oh love of God how rich
[30:45] and pure hallelujah amen I love that
[30:48] song now of course he then he sings it
[30:49] there oh how I love him oh oh how I
[30:51] adore him my breath my sunshine my all
[30:53] and all the great Creator became my
[30:55] savior and all God's fullness dwells in
[30:57] him oh my amen maybe we'll sing that at
[30:59] the end here by God's grace now he says
[31:02] Christ has redeemed us now we're now
[31:04] redeemed everybody say now but he has
[31:06] not claimed his possession yet so he
[31:09] hasn't come down and claimed his wife
[31:11] yet actually come down the living the
[31:13] living wife
[31:14] right now you might differ with that and
[31:17] even the Earth right he hasn't come down
[31:18] and taken over the Earth yet he hasn't
[31:20] that's his possession he purchased the
[31:21] Earth with his
[31:23] blood right brother man Tau the water of
[31:25] Noah's day that's type justification
[31:27] Jesus SP filled his blood on the cross
[31:29] that's sanctification by the blood and
[31:32] the fire that's going to burn the Earth
[31:33] over for the Millennium that types the
[31:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost water blood
[31:38] spirit right water Blood Fire Hallelujah
[31:41] so Jesus has uh he's washed it he's uh
[31:45] Sanctified it but he hasn't come down
[31:47] and claimed it as his own yet he's
[31:49] already purchased it though he's
[31:50] redeemed it
[31:52] amen he said now you might differ with
[31:55] that but just hold on a minute see we'll
[31:56] see he hasn't climed it see if he took
[31:59] the book of redemption everything that
[32:01] Adam had and everything that he lost
[32:02] Christ redeems back and he's already
[32:05] redeemed us but he hasn't took the
[32:06] possession yet he cannot until the time
[32:09] appointed and then come the resurrection
[32:12] and the Earth will be renewed again and
[32:13] then he'll take possession his
[32:15] possession which he got when he redeemed
[32:17] us but it will do it at the appointed
[32:19] time oh my hallelujah oh there's an
[32:23] appointed time church amen Jesus is
[32:25] going to come back and he's going to
[32:27] claim his possession he's going to take
[32:29] what belongs to him and that's what the
[32:31] Rapture is about he's taking his bride
[32:33] he's claiming his bride before he pours
[32:34] out his wrath upon the
[32:36] Earth right now if you got your Bible go
[32:39] to Jeremiah
[32:40] 326 this is a very little known
[32:42] scripture do you remember this verse
[32:44] brother Diggs read this last time he was
[32:46] here on his opening text but then he
[32:48] never preached it the rest of the time
[32:49] did everybody anybody catch that all
[32:52] right oh yeah virtue did all right amen
[32:53] me too Jeremiah 32 so I was waiting I'm
[32:57] like I've always wondered about this
[32:58] verse I I said in my mind I was like
[33:00] brother BR preach it in the seals but it
[33:02] was the
[33:03] breach Jeremiah
[33:05] 32 so let's read it and then we'll see
[33:08] how brother Braham uses this
[33:12] here Jeremiah
[33:14] 32 and it's verse 6 6 to5 just a little
[33:17] portion there by God's
[33:23] grace what I say 6 to
[33:25] 15 keep looking for the oh okay there
[33:27] all right yeah all right now verse six
[33:29] and Jeremiah said the word of the Lord
[33:30] came unto me saying behold Hanam the son
[33:33] of shalam thine Uncle shall come unto
[33:36] thee saying buy thee my field that is in
[33:39] anoth for the right of redemption is
[33:42] thine to buy it okay so there's a land
[33:45] that
[33:46] belonged
[33:47] uh his uncle and then he's supposed to
[33:51] buy it it belonged to his uncle right
[33:53] he's supposed to buy it and that's his
[33:55] right so he must have been the nearest
[33:56] of kin to the the uncle right but you
[34:00] got to buy it church we can talk about
[34:02] uh uh our possessions all we want right
[34:05] we can talk about God's promises all we
[34:06] want but we got to buy it we got to
[34:08] believe it right the Bible says buy the
[34:11] truth and sell it not Hallelujah we got
[34:13] to
[34:14] believe he says uh no I lost my spot
[34:18] verse eight so Handel mine uncle's son
[34:20] came to me in the court of the prison
[34:21] according to the word of the Lord they
[34:22] said to me by my field I pray thee that
[34:24] is in anathoth which is in the country
[34:26] of Benjamin for the right of inheritance
[34:28] is thine and the Redemption is thine buy
[34:30] it for thyself then I knew that this was
[34:33] the word of the
[34:34] Lord verse nine and I bought the field
[34:37] of Han hamile my uncle's son that was in
[34:40] ameo and weighed him the money even 17
[34:43] shekels of silver and I subscribed the
[34:45] evidence and sealed it and took
[34:48] Witnesses and weighed him the money in
[34:51] the bounces so he paid it he's got
[34:54] evidence of it and it's
[34:56] sealed Hallelujah
[34:58] sound pretty good those are some pretty
[34:59] good Bible words right there right
[35:02] Redemption bu it evidence sealed amen
[35:07] sounds like the Holy Ghost to me
[35:08] Hallelujah sounds like the Seven Seals
[35:10] to me and the church said Hallelujah
[35:15] by verse 11 so I took the evidence of
[35:18] the purchase both that which was sealed
[35:20] according to the law and the custom and
[35:22] that which was
[35:23] open and I gave the evidence of the
[35:25] purchase unto Baro the the son of nah
[35:29] the son of Mah in the sight of Hann
[35:32] Hanam mine uncle's son and in the
[35:34] presence of the witnesses that
[35:35] subscribed the book of the purchase
[35:38] before all the Jews that sat in the
[35:40] court of the prison so he did it in the
[35:42] front of
[35:43] witnesses didn't Jesus rais from the
[35:45] dead and he proved it to uh countless
[35:48] Witnesses Hallelujah when God does
[35:50] something doesn't he give a witness
[35:52] hallelujah our spirit Bears witness with
[35:55] his spirit that we are the children of
[35:57] God Hallelujah right on Mount
[35:59] Transfiguration when Jesus got that
[36:01] saying right hear ye him what happened
[36:03] God took Witnesses up there Hallelujah
[36:05] when you get married there's Witnesses

[36:18] got evidence it's sealed and then
[36:20] there's witnesses to it oh
[36:22] Hallelujah didn't Boaz have to get
[36:24] Witnesses before he could purchase Ruth
[36:26] and Naomi Hal
[36:28] he's got to get Witnesses Hallelujah God
[36:30] always has a witness of the truth
[36:33] hallelujah amen verse 13 and I charged
[36:37] barug before them saying thus sayith the
[36:38] Lord of hosts the god of Israel take
[36:40] these evidences this evidence of the
[36:42] purchase both which is sealed and the
[36:44] evidence which is open and put them in
[36:46] an earth and vessel that they may
[36:48] continue many days for thus sayith the
[36:50] Lord of hosts the god of Israel houses
[36:52] and Fields and vengers shall be
[36:54] possessed again in this land amen amen
[36:57] Hallelujah I'm going to buy this I'm
[36:59] going to purchase this I'm going to seal
[37:01] this but then I'm going to hide it away
[37:03] for the right time I can get it back
[37:05] hallelujah oh my Hallelujah sound
[37:08] familiar
[37:10] Church how many know what I'm talking
[37:12] about you know the punch line already
[37:14] all right but let me before that one let
[37:15] me read this here uh John Gil said this
[37:18] he bought it so it might continue many
[37:20] days even many years to the end of the
[37:23] Captivity oh my my that's the natural
[37:26] captivity what about the end into the
[37:27] spiritual captivity hallelujah oh my as
[37:31] it was designed they should when
[37:33] Jeremiah's heirs having some of them
[37:36] when they were deposited might take them
[37:38] up and claim the estate so Jeremiah
[37:41] bought it oh Jeremiah bought it so his
[37:44] heirs years later could possess the
[37:47] promises the promises of inheritance
[37:50] amen oh my do you see it church amen we
[37:54] got it on two levels
[37:56] here the resurrection and then the
[37:59] opening of The Seven Seals Jesus
[38:01] resurrection and the opening of The
[38:03] Seven
[38:04] Seals oh right is that
[38:07] right oh my brother Bram says this now
[38:11] where I lost my spot
[38:13] there he said now if you'd like to look
[38:15] in the scripture you can get over in
[38:17] Jeremiah and find out there anybody
[38:19] remember listen that
[38:20] one when he was going to the Captivity
[38:23] land you know he bought his uncle's Sons
[38:26] had some property and went through that
[38:28] ceiling and if we took it we got all
[38:31] that also in the seven Church ages them
[38:33] seals and so forth in
[38:35] there so you see a seal on the Old
[38:38] Testament was like a roll and then
[38:39] brother R demonstrates a roll I'll just
[38:41] do it like this so brother R said the
[38:43] old the old books are like you've seen
[38:45] the Scrolls right so brother would said
[38:48] that that'd be the first seal and then
[38:49] the second seal was another paper he'd
[38:50] wrap around that right it' have a seal
[38:52] on you have to put that wax seal on
[38:54] there right then you put another one
[38:56] that's the first well in this case it
[38:57] might be the seventh seal because it's
[38:58] all the way in there right I wish I had
[39:00] seven papers to make it more scriptural
[39:02] tonight but you understand so that if I
[39:03] put a wax seal on there now there two
[39:05] seals same book right but all seven had
[39:09] to be broken
[39:10] hallelujah
[39:13] amen he says no so he explains that he
[39:17] said we have books now but they they
[39:19] they were called
[39:22] Scrolls he says and then when he break
[39:24] the other one loose you can see what the
[39:26] claim was and the whole thing here is
[39:28] Seven Seals got the mystery of God from
[39:30] the foundation of the world all sealed
[39:32] up in there and revealed by seven
[39:34] different seals that if God willing let
[39:37] us pull back these seals and look down
[39:39] through the book and find out what it's
[39:41] all
[39:42] about see I hope we have a great time
[39:45] remember this is right the day before he
[39:46] preached the first seal there the
[39:47] mystery of redemption is sealed this
[39:49] book could not be broken until the last
[39:51] Angel's message the scroll is there we
[39:53] know it was there we know it was
[39:55] Redemption we believe it was Redemption
[39:57] Jer I said the scroll must be kept as
[39:59] you read it in there he'll say he must
[40:02] be kept in an earn vessel now here it is
[40:05] listen you hold on a long time with this
[40:07] quote he said oh what a beautiful thing
[40:09] I could talk about a while the scroll
[40:11] was kept in an earn vessel a vessel that
[40:14] once became flesh
[40:16] Glory died rose again and kept in an
[40:20] earth and vessel until the time of
[40:23] purchase Oh My beautifully amen and
[40:26] church not many people say Amen on it
[40:28] right because they weren't it was the
[40:28] first time they' heard it Hallelujah but
[40:31] now you can see it Jesus came down and
[40:34] he purchased the possession he purchased
[40:37] it he gave evidence for it and it was
[40:40] sealed they tried to seal him in but he
[40:42] broke the Easter seal he broke the Roman
[40:45] seal hallelujah amen and the Bible said
[40:48] he he revealed himself he made a show of
[40:50] them openly Hallelujah he made a show of
[40:52] all the principalities and Powers he
[40:54] showed them and gave them W many
[40:56] witnesses that I am alive I was dead but
[40:58] now I live
[41:00] Hallelujah and then he sealed up these
[41:03] Mysteries right in an earth and vessel
[41:05] until a later time when it could be
[41:07] possessed
[41:08] Hallelujah and when was that that was in
[41:11] 1963 We Believe by God's grace now the
[41:14] reason we say that is because brother R
[41:15] would preach a seal and then he say
[41:17] that's thus sayith the Lord and then we
[41:19] see it line up with scripture it's got
[41:21] to be right because it lines up with
[41:23] everything else in the scripture
[41:25] Hallelujah so now God has brought the
[41:28] book back to us so we can redeem we can
[41:31] uh we can live the blessings of being a
[41:33] redeemed child of God we can enjoy the
[41:37] rights of being a Christian
[41:39] hallelujah how many appreciate the
[41:41] rights of a Christian
[41:42] amen you have rights of the the
[41:45] scripture these are your rights
[41:47] hallelujah hallelujah they were they
[41:48] were hidden a vessel for seven Church
[41:50] ages amen hallelujah these some of these
[41:53] seven seal Revelations were hidden there
[41:55] for seven Church ages Hallelujah
[41:57] and now they've been brought out for you
[41:59] and I hallelujah oh my
[42:03] hallelujah oh thank the Lord amen thank
[42:06] the
[42:08] Lord let's see where I better finish
[42:10] right here let me finish with this one I
[42:11] made a video on this one today I just
[42:12] had a I like 10 minutes to throw
[42:14] together a video and put out there it
[42:15] was a real blessing to me now brother
[42:17] man goes back to uh Revelation 5 we're
[42:19] going to try to close here by God's
[42:20] grace
[42:27] 5 yes verse verse 5 Revelation
[42:34] 55 and one of the elders saith unto me
[42:36] weep not behold the lon of the tribe of
[42:38] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[42:40] to open the book and to loose the Seven
[42:43] Seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the
[42:44] midst of the throne and of the four
[42:46] beasts in the midst of the elders stood
[42:48] a lamb as had been slain having seven
[42:50] horns and seven eyes which are the seven
[42:53] spirits of God sent forth into all the
[42:55] Earth and he came and took the look out
[42:57] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[42:59] the throne oh we got a beautiful picture
[43:01] in here brother Bram says brother Bram
[43:04] said we the Bible tells us we come to we
[43:07] we announce that a lion has prevailed
[43:09] and brother BR said John looked over
[43:11] expecting to see a lion but he saw a
[43:14] lamb Hallelujah because we know Jesus is
[43:17] both The Lion and the
[43:19] lamb how many you see that in your life
[43:21] sometimes you got boldness like a lion
[43:23] sometimes you got to be real humble like
[43:24] a lamb and take some beating or take
[43:27] some I'll say like this take take some
[43:29] uh chastisement can I say it like that I
[43:32] shouldn't say beaten but chastisement
[43:34] some people get offense at words like
[43:35] that nowadays you
[43:37] know chastisement got to take some
[43:40] correction or remember and and the Bible
[43:43] says sometimes you'll suffer for your
[43:44] mistakes but the Bible said you'd have
[43:46] to deal with that but the Bible says God
[43:48] gets Glory when you suffer for something
[43:49] you didn't do Peter says that that's
[43:53] real suffering that's partaking in
[43:55] Christ suffering when you're persecuted
[43:57] just for being a Christian just for your
[43:59] stand on the word of God
[44:02] Amen so John turns to see a lion but
[44:06] instead he sees a
[44:08] lamb and look he's all bloody so this
[44:11] again proves you can't have the Seven
[44:13] Seals without the cross the blood of
[44:16] Jesus Christ amen and that proves it to
[44:18] us if the Seven Seals were open this day
[44:20] then we need to know about the blood we
[44:22] have people that have been to Calvary
[44:24] amen they've confessed their sins they
[44:27] they've called on God they repented been
[44:29] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[44:30] Christ and filled with the Holy Ghost
[44:32] amen that's what we need today we see it
[44:35] here you can't have the Seven Seals
[44:37] without a real experience with the the
[44:39] bloody lamb I'll say it like
[44:41] that amen there's that lie going around
[44:44] of course it went around for many years
[44:45] that you got to you got to know brother
[44:47] brandom to be saved you got to know
[44:48] brother brandom and that's the evidence
[44:49] of the Holy Ghost that's a lie you've
[44:51] got to confess your sins and become a
[44:53] Christian amen that's how you get saved
[44:56] you got to trust in the blood of Jesus
[44:57] Christ to be saved am and then you got
[44:59] to get Sanctified got to walk through
[45:01] your Wilderness you got to get a a new
[45:03] heart that justification new spirit then
[45:05] you got to get God's spirit
[45:08] hallelujah oh we're thankful Hallelujah
[45:10] for God's
[45:12] grace oh
[45:16] my so we see it's all connected here by
[45:19] God's grace we can see all these and can
[45:20] everybody see all these uh revelations
[45:22] in here all these topics all tied in
[45:24] with these Seven Seals it's amazing it
[45:26] just blew my mind
[45:28] now I'm going to read this quotee this
[45:29] be my last quote I think by God's grace
[45:31] I might pull up another one
[45:33] actually just because I put this one on
[45:35] the video okay this one's from the first
[45:37] one's from the breach here by God's
[45:41] grace just give me a second here I want
[45:42] to pull this other one up uh I remember
[45:44] it's Amos and
[45:49] lion
[45:54] okay thank you
[46:02] thank you for your
[46:11] patience okay all right let me start
[46:12] with this one sorry that's quite quite a
[46:14] long pause there have some time to get
[46:15] your breath there and the line of the
[46:17] tribe of Judah prevailed but said don't
[46:19] weep John for the line of the tribe of
[46:21] Judah the root of David has prevailed
[46:23] he's already overcome he has done it
[46:24] it's over John Woo oh my he produced a
[46:27] bleach that sends sin along back to the
[46:30] greasy
[46:32] hands uh that defiled it that defiled
[46:34] the human being so back to hell right
[46:36] back to Satan all the punishment for the
[46:38] sin goes back on
[46:40] Satan
[46:42] right the Bible tells us that right
[46:44] he'll have a he'll have an end time the
[46:45] Bible say he shall be no more that
[46:47] proves he won't burn eternally like this
[46:50] uh Catholic Doctrine it's a Catholic dog
[46:51] Dogma Lydia showed that with me I still
[46:53] got to preach that I gu still got to
[46:54] make a video on that I got to show that
[46:56] how uh there's no eternal hell like it
[46:58] was a Catholic created Doctrine remember
[47:00] that you Shar that with me no okay
[47:02] somebody did I know I got in my notes
[47:05] that's okay if you didn't hun
[47:06] sorry somebody Shar with me he
[47:09] says but when John turned to look he saw
[47:12] a lamb what a different from a lion he
[47:15] said the lion has prevailed see I can
[47:18] use that here God hiding him in
[47:19] Simplicity amen he looks for a lion but
[47:22] God's hiding in a
[47:23] lamb oh my he's called a lion but he
[47:26] looks like a lamb am hallelujah oh my we

[47:45] Christian because you've got Christ in
[47:46] you like I heard brother R say like you
[47:48] can't train a a a hog to dress up like a
[47:52] tuxedo and go out to some nice
[47:53] restaurant or something like that you
[47:55] don't have that nature I mean you you
[47:56] can dress him up like that but he's not
[47:58] going to act

[49:03] that again God hiding himself in
[49:04] Simplicity look there's a lion but there
[49:06] goes a lamb he said there's a lion
[49:08] that's the king of the Beast the lion
[49:10] has prevailed the strongest thing there
[49:12] is is a lion I've laid out there in the
[49:14] jungles of Africa and heard the giraffe
[49:16] squealing and the Great Mighty elephant
[49:18] with his trunk in the air we we wee we
[49:20] saw family member I didn't tell you this

[49:57] there God vindicating I felt like this
[49:59] was what he wanted me to preach just a
[50:01] humble just my my
[50:03] guess brother man I hear the giraffe
[50:06] squealing the mighty elephant is trunk
[50:08] in the air he says wee wee wee and then
[50:10] I hear the little Savages of the desert
[50:12] screaming out their bloody curdle
[50:14] cries yeah sometimes we hear those uh
[50:17] don't we hear foxes out in the field and
[50:19] they're who's got the blood curling
[50:20] cries out there the foxes man they sound
[50:23] crazy they found like they sound like
[50:25] screaming women like fck violent fights
[50:28] or something like that we can hear their
[50:29] bloody curdle cries yeah it's amazing
[50:31] what he hear out there he says and The
[50:34] Beetles till he said Billy Paul and I
[50:36] laying on a little old piece or place
[50:39] covered over stickers but then way off
[50:42] in the distance a lion will Roar so it's
[50:44] not even loud a lion will
[50:46] Roar he said and everything in the
[50:49] desert shuts up even The Beetles stop
[50:53] hollering so from the biggest animals
[50:54] down to the littlest beetle the king
[50:57] speaks he said oh my now he's talking
[50:59] about Revelation 5 the he's looking for
[51:02] a lion comes out and sees a bloody
[51:05] lamb he said I tell you he says that's
[51:08] when
[51:09] denominations and doubts fall to the
[51:12] ground and the church said everything
[51:14] gets quiet he says when the king speaks
[51:17] and this is the king that's his
[51:20] word hallelujah praise God Amen this is
[51:25] the king speaking Hallelujah when the
[51:26] word of God is preached and it's Purity
[51:29] the lion is roaring the king is speaking
[51:31] it's God's word
[51:33] amen every denomination shuts
[51:36] up right as I told you I'm still waiting
[51:38] for somebody to challenge me on my two
[51:40] books or my videos on the Seven Seals
[51:43] and all these major doct even water
[51:44] baptism still waiting for somebody to
[51:46] challenge and they can never do it right
[51:48] all they can say is well you've got your
[51:50] opinion and I've got mine but no I've
[51:52] got more of opinion I've got the word of
[51:55] God because there's not one scripture uh
[51:58] where a person was ever baptized in
[52:00] titles right or God's ever God's never
[52:03] called two persons or three persons
[52:05] that's the absolute truth so they can
[52:08] make all their excuses all they want
[52:10] God's word Roars like a lion hallelujah
[52:13] amen God's word cannot be stopped God's
[52:16] revelation is true it's right it's
[52:18] Vindicated Hallelujah and it Roars like
[52:19] a mighty lion hallelujah amen let's
[52:22] stand to our feet by God's grace I
[52:23] better stop right
[52:24] there I'm going to read that quote I
[52:26] went searching for Mal you can
[52:33] come brother BR said I believe it was
[52:36] Amos as I was referred to him a while
[52:37] ago when he said he was not a prophet
[52:39] neither a son of a prophet but said when
[52:41] the lion roars who can but
[52:43] fear then he says he tells this story
[52:45] again and if anyone ever heard a real
[52:47] lion roar in the wilderness these you
[52:49] hear in the cages around here are just
[52:51] meowing right how many been to the Aran
[52:53] zoo I went to ACO one time and he kind
[52:55] of roared a little I was like that
[52:57] wasn't really that
[52:58] impressive but that's CU he's
[53:01] inside that's CU he's in a cage what if
[53:04] he was outside and he had all his his
[53:07] livelihood but they're just meowing they
[53:09] just meow at the Aran Zoo but when one
[53:12] Roars in the wilderness everything takes
[53:13] heed I've laid in the jungle to hunt
[53:15] them he's the king of the beasts I've
[53:17] laid he says when the lion roars even
[53:19] The Beetles stop holling everything does
[53:21] the jackals hyena screaming other
[53:22] animals squawking the baboons and
[53:24] monkeys beetles you can hardly think to
[53:26] your self but in the distance let a line
[53:28] Roar and every Beetle will stop
[53:29] hollering see everything is afraid of
[53:31] him yet there's many things that can
[53:33] kill him like a humans but he's
[53:34] recognized as the king amongst the
[53:36] beasts and he said when the lion roars
[53:39] who can but fear he said then God has
[53:41] spoken who can but prophesy pull up uh
[53:45] Amos 37 and 8 I believe it
[53:48] is this is a this is a Bible requirement
[53:51] for a Prophet this is why we know so
[53:53] many people that say they prophets are
[53:54] not false I'm sorry not prophets they're
[53:56] false prophets because they've never
[53:58] revealed any secrets in the Bible they
[54:01] they they they introduce false doctrines
[54:03] they introduce confusion and lust of the
[54:06] flesh right that the people can do the
[54:07] lust of the
[54:09] flesh but this is how we know this is
[54:11] one proof brother R was the prophet of
[54:12] God surely the Lord God will do nothing
[54:14] but he revealed his secret unto the
[54:16] Servants of the prophets brother R
[54:17] revealed Secrets right and we just named
[54:19] some of them here especially the Seven
[54:21] Seals I proved it Hallelujah by God's
[54:24] grace Hallelujah
[54:29] he says the lion hath roared who will
[54:30] not fear the lord God has spoken but who
[54:32] can but prophesy so we see here any
[54:35] prophet of God who's speaking thus
[54:37] sayith the Lord Roars like a lion and
[54:39] everything else gets
[54:40] quiet everything else is quiet
[54:43] everything else brother R says every
