[29:06] sorry Mac I could do that again I don't

[29:10] want to look at this thought like I said
[29:12] I want to focus on the exceedingly
[29:14] abundantly above all we ask or think
[29:18] I prepared some slides okay there we go
[29:20] praise the Lord thank you
[29:21] children appreciate that look into part
[29:25] 11 I remember there's three themes we're
[29:26] still dealing with this second theme
[29:28] right here the one body of Christ both
[29:31] the Jew and Gentile so we're talking
[29:32] about the blessings of being in this
[29:35] body tonight and that and see after
[29:37] tonight Lord willing if we finished
[29:38] tonight we'll go to chapter 4 and then
[29:41] we'll get into the third theme the walk
[29:42] and the warfare now the walk is in
[29:44] chapter 4 and 5 the Warfare's in chapter
[29:47] 6 is your pride familiar with in the
[29:49] book of Ephesians now remember part 10
[29:51] the last time about two weeks ago we
[29:53] focused on the fellowship of the mystery
[29:55] which was the intimacy of the mystery
[29:57] which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[29:59] God wanted such an intimate relationship
[30:01] and this is what I'm teaching tomorrow
[30:03] Bible club I'm actually teaching this
[30:05] about the secret that God hid from the
[30:08] foundation world I'm gonna teach it to
[30:09] the kids tomorrow and it's the baptism
[30:11] of the Holy Ghost I could to show them
[30:13] how this was hid from all ages Paul said
[30:15] in Colossians 1 I'm gonna show how it
[30:17] was hid it was hid in the Old Testament
[30:19] it was hid all these times the Bible
[30:22] said the Holy Ghost could not be given
[30:23] until Jesus was glorified and then after
[30:26] his resurrection he breathed on some
[30:27] receive the Holy Ghost receive be born
[30:31] again
[30:32] let my spirit live in you let the
[30:34] comfort of her live in you and now this
[30:37] mystery that's been hidden is now made
[30:39] manifest to us amen so hopefully that
[30:41] the children will catch you tomorrow if
[30:43] not the children I'm confident those
[30:44] adults will catch it tomorrow by God's
[30:46] grace because they're starting to catch
[30:47] the name of Jesus and different things
[30:49] about that that we've been teaching oh
[30:51] and the three works of grace they've
[30:53] some of the adults have caught that oh
[30:54] yeah you you need to be filled with the
[30:56] Holy Ghost you after you're baptized you
[30:58] know you you just don't receive the Holy
[30:59] Ghost of your baptism you got to be
[31:00] filled with the Holy Ghost I'm so glad
[31:02] the word cannot be defeated amen praise
[31:05] God I'm so thankful now tonight I'm not
[31:07] gonna review it all that one let's go
[31:09] right to the scripture verse thirteen so
[31:10] have you got your Bible Oh Paul tells us
[31:13] I'm sorry Paul tells the Ephesians to
[31:15] not faint at his persecution because
[31:18] remember right now he's in prison
[31:20] he's riding in prison one historian said
[31:22] he was chained up you know to to a Roman
[31:25] guard it's at times not sure how often
[31:28] but he said don't say at my persecutions
[31:31] because they're actually a strength to
[31:34] you
[31:34] which is interesting so look at this
[31:37] let's read verse thirteen
[31:39] remember we finished last time with
[31:41] verse twelve about the boldness and
[31:43] access with confidence we have when we
[31:45] pray verse four 13 wherefore I desire
[31:49] that you faint not at my tribulations
[31:51] for you
[31:53] which is your glory
[31:56] now verse let me read unto 16 for this
[31:59] cause I bow my knees in to the father of
[32:01] our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole
[32:03] family in heaven earth is named that he
[32:06] would grant you according to the riches
[32:08] of his glory to be strengthened with
[32:10] might by his spirit in the inner man
[32:15] now let's just break that down there's a
[32:17] lot in here this is one of the medius
[32:19] sections of the book of Ephesians right
[32:22] here there's a the scriptures are just
[32:23] so deep and so filled with with
[32:26] statements and verbs and powerful
[32:29] scriptures let's just slow down this a
[32:31] little bit by God's grace now verse 13
[32:34] remember Paul said don't faint at my
[32:38] tribulation so don't be spiritless don't
[32:40] be discouraged when Christians are
[32:42] persecuted
[32:43] don't let your spirit I like like we
[32:45] talked about in Ghana you know what the
[32:46] pastor passing away that shouldn't leave
[32:48] a spiritless or we read our exhausted
[32:51] will we be sad absolutely but Paul said
[32:54] not to be weary at persecutions he said
[32:58] but let it be for your strength let it
[33:01] be for your your glory he says now this
[33:04] is interesting but let's this will lead
[33:06] us into some more scriptures we cannot
[33:08] faint we can't become spiritless we've
[33:10] got to let that encourage us I know it's
[33:12] hard to say especially in situations
[33:14] that are so personal like we talked
[33:15] about
[33:16] but we've got to see what God is doing
[33:19] God allowed it remember God told Joe or
[33:22] job said God allowed good and God
[33:24] allowed evil so even Satan can't get the
[33:27] credit for evil right because God
[33:30] allowed it Satan's gonna get credit for
[33:32] nothing except sin right and unbelief
[33:35] but see God allowed evil God allows good
[33:38] God allows evil we must accept both at
[33:41] the hand of God and we must let it
[33:43] encourage us and seek God for
[33:46] understanding that we might go through
[33:48] the trial and come forth as gold in
[33:50] other words come forth with more faith
[33:52] with stronger faith
[33:54] now which is the scripture says which is
[33:57] your glory so rather which are your
[34:01] glory namely and as much as showing that
[34:04] God loved you so much as both to give
[34:07] his son for you and to permit his
[34:10] apostles to suffer tribulations for you
[34:12] in preaching the gospel to the Gentiles
[34:16] so see that Paul said this was for your
[34:18] glory I'm being persecuted for your
[34:20] glory
[34:22] he says now now remember he said he was
[34:26] a prisoner in Ephesians 3-1 so he says
[34:29] my tribulations here are your spiritual
[34:32] glory as your faith is further thereby
[34:36] if we were preaching some lie do you
[34:39] think it'd be persecuted absolutely not
[34:41] they let you know look at all the look
[34:43] at all the other religions that don't
[34:44] get persecuted why is Christianity so
[34:47] highly persecuted around the world
[34:48] because it's nothing but the truth it's
[34:51] the truth of God it has a true anointing
[34:53] of the Holy Spirit and the spirit of
[34:55] Antichrist hates the Spirit of God and
[34:58] wants to destroy anyone who truly has
[35:00] the Spirit of God hallelujah and so see
[35:04] when we hear about Christians being
[35:05] persecuted it should give us hope it
[35:07] should give us strength yes we will
[35:10] sweet we weep with them we hurt with
[35:11] them we feel with them at the same time
[35:13] it raises our faith God's letting them
[35:15] be persecuted and that ought to raise
[35:17] our faith let's read these scriptures I
[35:20] took time to write those out I read each
[35:22] one let's take a moment and read those
[35:24] if we can so let's go to first
[35:25] Corinthians 4:10
[35:27] Paul says this over and over we've not
[35:30] to let persecutions strengthen us
[35:33] first Corinthians 4:10 I know it's tough
[35:35] like I said
[35:37] first Corinthians 4:10
[35:45] now here Paul's writing here
[35:49] about the apostles 1st corinthians 4
[35:52] time who would like someone like to read
[35:54] this for me madam thank you sir
[36:08] amen Paul's making the point about the
[36:12] preachers the Apostle the Apostles that
[36:14] travel and sacrifice the Apostles the
[36:16] one that looked like fools right because
[36:18] they're out there on the front lines and
[36:19] they're the ones being persecuted in
[36:21] this case especially in Paul's day all
[36:23] the great persecution
[36:25] he said the posture looked like fools
[36:28] but the Christians are the ones they're
[36:30] not being persecuted our wise
[36:31] Paul said we are the weak ones because
[36:33] we're actually getting persecuted
[36:35] buffeted he said but you are strong and
[36:39] he says ye are honorable he said and we
[36:43] are despised
[36:44] so you see this there's this there's
[36:47] there's these said like this there's
[36:48] some soldiers on the battlefront that
[36:51] are going through the hardest trials
[36:52] right but when we know they're suffering
[36:55] it should encourage us it should make us
[36:57] strong we should take courage by those
[37:00] who are on the front lines don't you
[37:01] take courage when you hear about
[37:02] missionaries going into China don't you
[37:05] get encouraged when you hear about
[37:06] missionaries going into Vietnam crossing
[37:08] and they're putting their lives on the
[37:09] line doesn't that encourage you they're
[37:11] the ones that look like fools they're
[37:13] the ones that are destitute there's one
[37:14] but we're the ones that are getting
[37:16] strengthened because of that we're
[37:18] seeing that the faith of Christ I'll say
[37:20] like this the Great Commission is being
[37:22] fulfilled Amen it's going to happen if
[37:25] God didn't call you and I to go then we
[37:26] ought to send somebody and our prayers
[37:29] should be with them constantly that's
[37:32] why we can pray for them tonight at the
[37:33] end of the service as well but see he
[37:35] said that's what it is those on the
[37:36] front lines those are the Apostles
[37:38] they're the ones that are going through
[37:39] the great heavy burdens on the battle
[37:41] fronts and here we are back here we're
[37:43] not really suffering but thank God were
[37:45] wise thank God were strong hallelujah
[37:48] and thank God were honorable praise God
[37:51] thank God for that I go to second
[37:53] Corinthians 1 verse 6
[38:00] thinker thien's 1 verse 6
[38:05] and whether we be afflicted it is for
[38:09] your consolation and salvation
[38:12] which is effectual in the enduring of
[38:15] the same sufferings which we also suffer
[38:18] or whether we become we be comforted it
[38:21] is for your consolation and salvation
[38:25] amen see these apostles they're the ones
[38:29] suffering they're the ones but what
[38:30] happens because they're suffering
[38:32] because they're spreading the gospel we
[38:33] could have consolation we can have peace
[38:36] we can have comfort and we can rest
[38:38] assured that we are saved amen why
[38:40] because we heard that we heard preaching
[38:42] from st. Paul now you and I heard it
[38:45] from the Bible through a prophet named
[38:46] William Branham right but that's why we
[38:49] know we have salvation
[38:50] because we're hearing the same word Paul
[38:53] preached he was being he suffered
[38:55] brother Branham suffer - especially
[38:57] rejection at the end of his lifetime you
[38:59] know as this is not the real age of
[39:01] Christian persecution
[39:02] let's see as he was rejected and he was
[39:05] he was just given a bad name yet we are
[39:10] cut we are consoled by that and we are
[39:12] having salvation anyway amen that's
[39:15] exactly right but see you have this idea
[39:17] all throughout the scripture that the
[39:19] Apostle is the one who brought the word
[39:21] there are ones that suffer but yet we
[39:23] have salvation we have comfort we have
[39:26] hope we have strength we have all these
[39:27] things because we know God is with us
[39:29] amen we know God is with Christianity
[39:32] hey man I go to flip Ian's one now I'm
[39:35] sorry let's go to this one that's right
[39:36] we are I'm sorry we already passed let's
[39:38] go to first Corinthians 12:26 he's just
[39:40] a couple of turns of the page
[39:42] sorry you should have put that in order
[39:44] first contains 12 six this is what I
[39:48] mentioned earlier yeah this is when when
[39:50] one member suffers we all suffer and
[39:52] whether one member suffer all the
[39:54] members suffer with it for one member be
[39:55] honored and all the members rejoice with
[39:58] it Amen see there's a part of us that
[40:02] suffers with them but Paul still tells
[40:04] them you're still gonna be consolation
[40:06] you're still going to be saved because
[40:08] we're all believing the same word now
[40:11] Philippians 1 verse 12
[40:14] Philippians 1 verse 12 we see this all
[40:17] throughout Paul's writings
[40:20] Christian persecution
[40:23] brings us all these benefits
[40:26] consolation makes yes we suffer we're
[40:29] sad but also strengthens our faith in
[40:31] the gospel of Jesus Christ
[40:33] blippi ins 1 12 13 and 14
[40:40] brethren I'm sorry but I would ye should
[40:43] understand brethren that the things
[40:44] which happen unto me have fallen out
[40:47] rather unto the furtherance of the
[40:49] gospel
[40:50] so that my bonds in Christ are manifest
[40:53] in all the palace and in all other
[40:56] places and many of the Brethren in the
[40:58] Lord waxing confident by my bonds and
[41:02] are much more bold to speak the word
[41:05] without fear look what this produced
[41:08] Paul got locked in jail and what did it
[41:10] produce it made the Saints more bold to
[41:13] witness when people get persecuted what
[41:17] does it cause it caused you a godly love
[41:18] and it makes you want to stand up for
[41:20] Jesus right if someone's hurt as a
[41:24] Christian or or someone gets persecuted
[41:25] you just can't stand it you just want to
[41:27] be more bold for Jesus Christ this is
[41:30] what Paul's saying so any Christian
[41:32] persecution is for our glory amen can
[41:35] you say amen to that it will benefit you
[41:38] it'll benefit us somehow it'll benefit
[41:40] the body of Christ although it's
[41:42] difficult to see them suffer we suffer
[41:44] in a way but it also she makes us
[41:47] stronger in the faith and should make us
[41:49] more bold for Jesus amen just like when
[41:53] somebody picks on your little brother's
[41:54] sister what do you do do you pick on
[41:56] your little brother no you stand up for
[41:58] him that's if you got love in your heart
[42:00] and you weren't a rascal yet you know it
[42:03] makes you want to fight if you're
[42:04] fighting my brother I'm gonna fight you
[42:05] right you're not gonna pick on my that's
[42:08] how this was Christ you're not gonna
[42:09] pick on Christ he's the head we're the
[42:12] body
[42:13] and when you see somebody persecuting
[42:15] Christians you want to rise up and help
[42:17] them that's exactly right and our
[42:19] biggest battle we can do is on our knees
[42:21] that's the best thing we can do we can
[42:23] send money I've done that before you
[42:24] send money to people Christian that are
[42:25] struggling you know they have your
[42:26] churches you can send them we sent a
[42:28] couple years ago member when the
[42:29] remember that typhoon hit the
[42:31] Philippines a couple years ago we were
[42:33] at the other church on Waterloo that
[42:35] little hole-in-the-wall
[42:37] remember I think we were gathered
[42:39] together some money I think we sent a
[42:40] couple hundred or a thousand over there
[42:42] I can't remember how much it was
[42:45] but look here we're a real tiny Church
[42:48] but it breaks our hearts to see all
[42:50] those churches destroyed all those homes
[42:53] in water and then when it went away and
[42:55] the season the Saints there gathered
[42:57] around those pictures they don't have
[42:58] any clothes and they've lost everything
[42:59] what does it make you do you want to do
[43:02] something for Jesus because you know
[43:04] what if that was you you'd want somebody
[43:06] to help you out and you know they're
[43:08] standing for the same message you and I
[43:09] are so see
[43:12] persecution is for our glory it helps us
[43:16] to glorify Christ more helps us to be
[43:19] more bold helps us to be the Christians
[43:21] we ought to be
[43:22] amen I don't know about you and every
[43:26] whenever I get in a spiritual battle it
[43:27] really brings out the real fighter in me
[43:29] the real the real it brings out your
[43:32] zeal doesn't it somebody comes against
[43:33] water baptism or somebody comes against
[43:35] the serpent seed oh you're gonna see a
[43:37] fight then you're gonna see the sort
[43:39] you're gonna pull out the sword of the
[43:40] Spirit you're gonna start cutting
[43:42] through all those lies and all that
[43:44] that's why I love the comments on
[43:45] YouTube because it's just something I
[43:46] can do I see a lie right there I just
[43:48] take out the sword and cut that up like
[43:50] that or somebody emails Mira calls me I
[43:52] sure like that I get to pray about it I
[43:54] get to get that sword out and I get to
[43:56] fight for the truth of God because the
[43:58] Bible said we're fighting the good fight
[44:00] of faith it's going to be a fight
[44:03] hallelujah yes now then he says for this
[44:08] cause and going back to the chapter
[44:09] three
[44:13] we looked at that was chapter chapter
[44:14] 313 so see in verse 13 wherefore I
[44:18] desire that you faint not at my
[44:19] tribulation for you which is your glory
[44:21] so you're gonna be you're gonna enjoy
[44:24] the glory this you're gonna enjoy the
[44:25] benefit of Paul being persecuted and for
[44:28] this cause
[44:30] Paul bowed his knee so in other words he
[44:33] got down in prayer to worship Jesus in
[44:35] other words because the Saints would
[44:38] benefit by his persecution it took him
[44:40] to his knees
[44:42] alright so for this cause the cause of
[44:45] the Saints being strengthened with might
[44:47] by his spear and the inner man for this
[44:51] cause the Saints being strengthened Paul
[44:54] bowed his knees or he bowed down to the
[44:58] Lord Jesus Christ
[45:00] isn't that how you'd feel if I knew
[45:02] brother amen was gonna walk out of here
[45:04] stronger than when he walked in wouldn't
[45:06] that make wouldn't that make me bow my
[45:08] knees and say hallelujah when that if I
[45:11] knew Jose and all the sisters if I knew
[45:13] you're gonna walk out of here or
[45:14] spiritual powerhouses and your glory
[45:16] glory of God would shine greater on you
[45:18] wouldn't it send a real Christian to
[45:20] their knees in praise to Almighty God
[45:22] they're not gonna be weaker when they
[45:25] leave here they're gonna be stronger
[45:26] that's what's Paul saying I'm in bonds
[45:29] I'm in prison but my persecution is
[45:31] gonna cause the Saints to be stronger
[45:34] amen they're gonna Black's more bold and
[45:36] it's gonna send me to my knees to give
[45:39] glory to the Lord Jesus Christ amen Oh
[45:43] glory
[45:45] now verse 15 of whom the whole family in
[45:48] heaven earth is named I love that
[45:49] scripture it shows the name of Lord
[45:51] Jesus Christ is the name above all names
[45:54] and it shows that you and I are mrs.
[45:56] Jesus Christ mrs. Lord Jesus Christ
[46:01] hallelujah
[46:03] the whole family heaven earth his name
[46:06] just as Adam and Eve share of the same
[46:07] name in Genesis 5 so Christ and the
[46:09] church share the same name amen now
[46:12] verse 16 that he would grant unto you
[46:15] according to the riches of his glory to
[46:18] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[46:22] in the inner man so see he knew his
[46:24] persecution would produce
[46:26] a glory in them and produce a spiritual
[46:30] encouragement and then it threw him to
[46:32] his knees they bowed his knees and said
[46:33] God strengthen them with inner strength
[46:37] in the inner man so in other words this
[46:39] persecution would throw him to his knees
[46:41] and say God strengthened the Saints even
[46:43] though I'm in prison strengthened all
[46:45] those Saints that we started the church
[46:47] there in Ephesus strengthened then that
[46:49] they'll have strength of the Holy Ghost
[46:51] in their lives how many love with the
[46:53] strength of the Lord how many can see
[46:55] the strength alone when it's not your
[46:56] strength but you can recognize someone's
[46:58] strengthen me someone's keeping me
[47:00] someone's helping me do this it's not my
[47:02] strength I didn't have straining to this
[47:04] before this is God's strength Amen
[47:06] that's what drove Paul to his knees to
[47:08] say God make them stronger let them see
[47:11] the strength of Christ in their lives
[47:12] and not their own strength and church
[47:14] you and I have no strength amen we're no
[47:17] match for the devil it takes the
[47:19] strength of God for us to cast down
[47:21] awesome tations amen now
[47:24] remember our strength has to be made new
[47:27] day by day we can't take the strength of
[47:32] Wednesday and hope well I hope it helps
[47:34] me on Friday don't get me wrong it might
[47:36] bless you well the RAM said the
[47:38] blessings of the future home lasted him
[47:40] two weeks he said all the revelations in
[47:43] the future home last them two whole
[47:45] weeks but what Paul sang here is we do
[47:48] not faint but though our outward man
[47:51] perish yet the inward man is renewed day
[47:53] by in other words you got to keep that
[47:55] fire going every single day in other
[47:58] words for like brother branham's the
[48:00] example I gave of him he would have had
[48:02] to go over those future home quotes
[48:04] every day and when he did and those
[48:07] scriptures every day it would just bring
[48:08] him more strength ma look at this every
[48:10] day and you know that word renewed means
[48:13] it means renovation
[48:15] think about that does anybody remember
[48:18] what this room looked like I use that
[48:19] illustration board remember what this
[48:20] room looked like before we moved in here
[48:21] does anybody remember I know the
[48:23] children do well what do we do we gave
[48:25] it a renovation well can you imagine
[48:26] renovating this room every day what if I
[48:29] what if we painted today and said okay
[48:31] let's get the paint out tomorrow give it
[48:32] a fresh coat
[48:34] let's rip out this carpet let's put some
[48:36] new carpet in here that's what it's like
[48:38] that's what the word rent of renew means
[48:40] to renovate it be like ripping it all
[48:42] out and started all again and that's
[48:44] what we need to do in our minds church
[48:46] in our minds you ever wake up with a bad
[48:49] thought in your mind yeah you ever had a
[48:51] bad dream and wake up with a bad thought
[48:52] in your mind you ever wake up cranky
[48:54] before
[48:55] you need to renew that mind every single
[48:59] day and the church said Paul is praying
[49:01] said God strengthened them with your
[49:03] strength in the inner man see we don't
[49:06] want to be strong so much on the outside
[49:07] we want to be strong on the inside that
[49:10] we can stand up to the devil and all his
[49:12] devices amen
[49:14] see if any man's in Christ he's a new
[49:17] creature old things are passed away
[49:19] behold all things are become new
[49:23] galatians 6:15 for in Christ Jesus
[49:26] neither circumcision
[49:27] availeth anything nor uncircumcision but
[49:31] a new creature the only thing that
[49:34] counts in Christianity is that you and I
[49:36] become brand new that's the only thing
[49:38] that counts people can be baptized but
[49:40] if they don't become a new person every
[49:42] single day if their life if the life of
[49:45] Christ isn't prevailing over their old
[49:47] man then they're not a new creature we
[49:49] must be new creatures and that's all
[49:51] Jesus once that's the whole end of the
[49:53] gospel so you'll be made more like
[49:54] Christ a new creature and not like
[49:57] you're all dirty self anymore amen glory
[50:00] that's the only thing that avails that's
[50:02] the only thing that means anything is
[50:03] that you are a new person amen glory
[50:09] now verse 17 is this a little bit tricky
[50:11] for denomination I hope you understand
[50:14] this here's I I mentioned this
[50:17] that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[50:20] faith that ye being rooted and grounded
[50:23] in love let's look at this first thought
[50:25] of Christ dwelling in your hearts by
[50:28] faith
[50:32] all right now all
[50:36] right now I want to make sure notes here
[50:38] make sure I'd say the right thing
[50:41] there's two E's two ways you can take
[50:44] this let me just say that there's two
[50:45] ways there's two ways you can take that
[50:47] Christ dwell in your hearts by faith
[50:50] there's two ways you can take it now
[50:52] most denominational churches take it
[50:54] like this when a sinner gets say they
[50:57] say they say oh do you want to repent of
[50:58] your sins yes do you want to invite
[51:01] Jesus into your heart and they say yes
[51:03] I'm gonna invite Jesus into my heart and
[51:05] they think that person's filled with the
[51:08] Holy Ghost when they're not even living
[51:09] a sanctified life
[51:11] right and so that's why that then this
[51:13] is the one scripture in the whole Bible
[51:15] that said Christ dwells in your hearts
[51:17] and this is where they get their prayer
[51:18] from oh invite Jesus in your heart and
[51:21] now you're filled with the Holy Spirit
[51:22] well not really not really you're not
[51:25] even sanctified because after that just
[51:27] watch their life the next day they still
[51:28] might cuss right Easter might watch
[51:30] dirty shows their old habits of the
[51:33] world are still there but yet they got a
[51:35] scripture where Christ dwells in my
[51:37] heart by faith well yes he tells in your
[51:40] mind
[51:41] anybody wants to dwell all the way down
[51:43] in your soul does ever understand that
[51:46] there's two ways you can take the
[51:47] scripture the denomination taken well he
[51:49] dwells in our hearts now we're all
[51:51] filled with the Holy Ghost but really it
[51:53] means that he dwells in their in their
[51:55] minds right it's just an anointing in
[51:57] their mind but he wants to get all the
[51:59] way down to that intimate part all the
[52:01] way down to the soul amen it's exactly
[52:05] right because look at this here now let
[52:07] me let me look at the scripture remember
[52:09] the Bible said the heart is deceitful
[52:11] above all things and desperately wicked
[52:13] who can know it I the LORD search the
[52:17] heart I try the reigns even to give
[52:19] every man according to his ways and
[52:21] according to the fruit of his doing
[52:23] to see most churches grossly
[52:26] misinterpret Christ dwelling in the
[52:27] heart their use of the heart cannot deal
[52:30] with the minor spirit it has to be the
[52:32] soul
[52:33] I'm sorry this use of the heart so we
[52:36] look at Christ dwells in your hearts by
[52:38] faith as Christ dwelling in the soul of
[52:40] man because the Holy Ghost dwells in
[52:43] your soul by faith and that's in Matthew
[52:47] 11:29 and Hebrews four nine so let's go
[52:51] to Matthew 11 twenty-nine let's read
[52:52] that again by the grace of Lord
[52:55] this is what makes us different from the
[52:58] churches right here this is the main
[53:00] thing the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[53:02] Matthew 11:29 they say oh I got it I
[53:05] invited Jesus in my heart when I was you
[53:07] know six or seven or and and then they
[53:10] still cuss and swear and they still
[53:12] practice immoral things they practice
[53:14] immoral a living unsanctified life and
[53:17] they misunderstood the scripture because
[53:19] they didn't have a prophet to tell them
[53:21] and that's not their fault it's their
[53:23] fault when we tell the truth and then
[53:25] they reject it
[53:27] okay Matthew 11:29 can somebody read
[53:29] that for me by God's grace Malachi thank
[53:30] you sir
[53:39] amen
[53:41] can you see all Jesus teaching here
[53:43] Jesus saying you've had the Holy Spirit
[53:45] on your flesh Jonah had on his flesh
[53:47] David had on his flesh but they didn't
[53:51] have it down in the soul and if you
[53:54] don't believe that go to go to Hebrews
[53:55] 10 read Hebrews 10 tonight that was my
[53:57] scripture I read that whole chapter this
[53:58] morning that was my scripture reading
[54:00] that my devotion time this morning oh my
[54:02] it's just beautiful the Bible said we're
[54:05] sanctified forever by one sacrifice
[54:08] praise God
[54:10] Jesus don't doesn't have to die every
[54:12] time we come to church he only died one
[54:13] time and we're forever sanctified by
[54:16] that one offering amen and it says then
[54:19] the blood of bulls and goats could never
[54:21] take away your sins nor could it purge
[54:23] your conscience but that means the blood
[54:25] of Jesus Christ takes away all your sin
[54:27] and the second fold it purges your
[54:30] conscience so you don't walk around
[54:32] saying I'm guilty I'm going to hell i'm
[54:33] going to hell aren't you glad church you
[54:35] have a conscience that's purged and you
[54:37] can know that your sins are forgiven and
[54:39] you can know that's you're on your way
[54:41] to heaven amen
[54:43] but not do that amen but the New
[54:46] Testament does that it takes away all
[54:48] your sin and it should clean out your
[54:51] conscience so you know I'm living right
[54:53] I'm doing right I'm forgiving I'm a son
[54:56] or daughter of God I'm on my way to
[54:58] heaven I'm shouting victory and I'll
[55:00] serve God and dwell in the house the
[55:02] Lord all the days of my life amen glory
[55:05] so Jesus saying I'm going to give rest
[55:08] of your soul your souls have never had
[55:10] rest because the blood of bulls and
[55:12] goats could never take away your sin it
[55:14] could never take away your unbelief but
[55:16] now in the New Testament he said I'm
[55:17] giving you rest for your souls amen this
[55:21] is Christ dwelling in the heart in other
[55:24] words the soul by faith it's not just
[55:27] that like we said it's not the
[55:28] denominational idea I'm by Jesus in my
[55:30] heart okay now let's go play video games
[55:32] let's go shoot somebody up on a video
[55:33] game I've seen that I've seen kids do
[55:36] that we've seen kids baptized a Bible
[55:38] club and they leave they come back
[55:39] you're talking about all kinds of evil
[55:40] video games that's not the love of
[55:42] Christ that's not the Spirit of Christ
[55:44] Christ really didn't come in the soul
[55:46] right although people tell them that we
[55:49] need to tell them you must be born again
[55:51] amen you got justified now you need to
[55:54] walk into st. if occasion you know walk
[55:56] in that wilderness and then you need to
[55:58] possess the promised land you need to
[55:59] walk through the River Jordan ain't ahem
[56:01] and get filled with the Holy Ghost I
[56:04] didn't hear ya that's exactly right
[56:06] Laurie now next in verse 17 jesus
[56:12] was preaching to the soul I want to
[56:15] dwell on your soul I'm gonna give you
[56:17] rest for your soul
[56:20] fusion's 3:17 that Christ may dwell in
[56:23] your hearts by faith that ye being
[56:25] rooted and grounded in love
[56:29] that's just a simple thought but I
[56:31] showed this picture last time I found
[56:32] this on the internet I thought this was
[56:33] really pretty we are rooted and grounded
[56:36] in love
[56:37] fusions 3:17 these are all these leaves
[56:40] I mean the fruits of the spirit come out
[56:42] of here but our roots you and I are
[56:45] called trees of righteousness how many
[56:46] remember that and if Psalms chapter one
[56:48] we are the tree where the sea that
[56:51] becomes a life right we're the seed of
[56:53] the tree that becomes a tree but our
[56:55] roots our life must be rooted in the
[57:01] love of God amen now the word rooted
[57:05] means to be stabilized to be grounded
[57:08] you and I must be stabilized in the love
[57:11] of God you and I must be grounded in the
[57:15] love of God
[57:16] see we are that growing seed a tree of
[57:19] God stable in the love of God do you
[57:22] feel that tonight do you feel that you
[57:24] are selling the love of God which means
[57:26] you are settled in the baptism of the
[57:28] Holy Ghost you're anchored in God your
[57:30] place in God you're abiding in God's
[57:33] love amen how many you're living in
[57:36] God's love amen Oh glory that's where
[57:39] I'm rooted that's where I'm Ankur that's
[57:41] where I stay that's where I live at in
[57:43] the love of God amen
[57:45] where's mo Jesse he's grounded in the
[57:48] love of God amen I live in Doylestown
[57:50] but I actually Lester not my real
[57:52] location my real location is I'm in
[57:54] Christ love
[57:55] that's where you'll find me all the time
[57:57] amen in the love of Christ because the
[58:01] Bible said were rooted and grounded and
[58:03] settled and anchored in the love of God
[58:06] amen now
[58:07] remember the next verse and I preached
[58:10] on this a few months ago may be able to
[58:13] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[58:16] breadth and the length and the depth and
[58:18] the height who was here when I preached
[58:19] on that he's ever remember that okay I'm
[58:21] gonna just go that quickly I don't know
[58:22] if sister Connie heard that or not
[58:26] now Paul said we must understand the
[58:29] love of Christ that we are rooted in and
[58:31] we must think this you and I must think
[58:34] this God's love has breadth to it God's
[58:37] love has length to it God's love has
[58:40] depth to it and God's love has height to
[58:43] it how many believe that Paul's that's
[58:45] why I says these are some of the richest
[58:47] scriptures in the New Testament some of
[58:50] these things some of these ideas he gets
[58:51] out and it had to come from God because
[58:53] we never would have thought of it
[58:55] and so remember we must review we must
[58:58] use our minds and remember the love of
[59:01] God and he said all saints should try to
[59:04] wrap your brain around this wrap your
[59:06] spirit around this that God's love have
[59:08] us for we'd say manifestations to it now
[59:12] remember I thought this was striking the
[59:14] the love has four parts or four
[59:16] manifestations and then the Holy Ghost
[59:18] has four powers I thought that was
[59:19] really striking as four manifestations
[59:22] as the lion the Ox the man thing I
[59:24] thought that's very striking don't you I
[59:26] think it's very striking now I already
[59:29] show this one so what is God's love
[59:32] God's love has breadth or width because
[59:34] as far as the East is from the west so
[59:38] far has room he removed our
[59:39] transgressions from us
[59:41] so breadth is with the crossed God's
[59:45] love separates our sin as far as the
[59:47] east is from the west amen that we must
[59:51] understand we must remember that God has
[59:54] separated me as far from my sins as I
[59:56] could possibly get from them amen Corie
[59:59] and remember he or she that is forgiven
[1:00:04] much love much so God if God took a lot
[1:00:08] of sins away from you and had to
[1:00:09] separate you from a lot of sins guess
[1:00:11] what you're the one that loves Jesus
[1:00:13] more
[1:00:14] hallelujah that's why I can say like
[1:00:16] this well I'm not gonna say like that
[1:00:19] I'm gonna move on I don't want to say
[1:00:20] the wrong thing I just kind of felt
[1:00:22] checked on that no no no let me not say
[1:00:24] that let me move on so God's love has
[1:00:26] breath it separates us for as far east
[1:00:28] from the West is God's love has length
[1:00:32] and this is measured in the length of
[1:00:34] days and the length of generations for
[1:00:37] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:00:39] me what all the days of my life and I'll
[1:00:43] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[1:00:46] amen now look here he says this I will
[1:00:48] make known that faithfulness to all
[1:00:51] generations so God's love is so long it
[1:00:54] lasts to every generation
[1:00:56] hallelujah his truth endureth to all
[1:01:00] generations his love is so long it's so
[1:01:03] wide but it's also so long to every
[1:01:06] generation
[1:01:08] here in the Bible says he keeps his love
[1:01:10] to a thousand generations
[1:01:13] hallelujah amen so his love has width it
[1:01:17] separates us from our sins as far as we
[1:01:20] could possibly possibly could be it's so
[1:01:23] long it goes to a thousand generations
[1:01:24] and now his love has depth and depth
[1:01:29] always deals with the mind of God when
[1:01:31] you read the scripture the depth of God
[1:01:34] always refers to the mind of God the
[1:01:37] depth of riches of his mind who hath
[1:01:39] known the mind of the Lord
[1:01:42] okay so we must remember his love has
[1:01:46] depth of his mind great thoughts that he
[1:01:49] had the Bible said he's rich in mercy
[1:01:51] his great love we're and he loved us
[1:01:54] even when we were dead in sins he's
[1:01:57] quickened us together with Christ by
[1:01:59] grace you're saved and has raised us up
[1:02:01] together and made us sit together in
[1:02:03] heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen
[1:02:07] Romans 5 says for when we were yet
[1:02:09] without strength in due time Christ died
[1:02:12] for the ungodly but God commendeth his
[1:02:14] love towards us in that while we were
[1:02:16] yet sinners Christ died for us much more
[1:02:20] then being now justified by his blood we
[1:02:22] shall be saved from wrath through him
[1:02:24] can I get a Amen tonight these are old
[1:02:28] time gospel scriptures about the love of
[1:02:30] God amen now here's the depth of his
[1:02:33] mind according as he hath chosen us in
[1:02:36] him before the foundation of the world
[1:02:39] and he has made us accepted in the
[1:02:44] beloved praise God so that's the depth
[1:02:47] of God it's so deep it the God's love is
[1:02:50] so deep it was so deep in his mind that
[1:02:53] he was thinking about it before the
[1:02:54] foundation of the world
[1:02:56] hallelujah let me skip past that I got a
[1:02:59] lot of that and his love has height
[1:03:02] because the Bible said his mercy reaches
[1:03:05] into the heavens praise the Lord don't
[1:03:09] you love that it's deep in his mind it
[1:03:11] was deep way in his mind before the
[1:03:12] foundation world and now his love is so
[1:03:14] high it reaches to the heavens
[1:03:17] hallelujah for as heaven is high above
[1:03:21] the earth so great is his mercy toward
[1:03:24] them that fear him how many scared of
[1:03:26] heights it makes me twinge every time I
[1:03:29] see something on Facebook when someone
[1:03:30] jumps off a high building because I
[1:03:32] don't like Heights
[1:03:33] see we don't like that but God likes
[1:03:36] that God like cuz he's showing us how
[1:03:39] high his love is above us his love is so
[1:03:42] great extends way high above all of us
[1:03:46] so we must not to get over my fear I
[1:03:49] guess but the fact is his love it
[1:03:52] reminds us how high is mercy is to us
[1:03:56] his mercy is great above the heavens
[1:03:58] it's even up above the heavens amen and
[1:04:02] the truth reaches unto the clouds amen
[1:04:06] and remember Church our hope is so high
[1:04:09] it's past outer space it's past the
[1:04:12] universe the Bible said our hope is so
[1:04:14] high it enters into the veil in heaven
[1:04:17] where the forerunner entered even Jesus
[1:04:21] and our hope is anchored at the very
[1:04:23] throne of God at the very mercy seat of
[1:04:26] God that's how high God's love is for us
[1:04:28] amen our Lovins focus on Jesus Christ
[1:04:32] amen glory amen
[1:04:36] now here's the thought I want to get to
[1:04:38] have the most slides on this because I'm
[1:04:39] gonna read some quotes I'm gonna read

[1:06:33] others in John 10 and John 16 I remember
[1:06:36] these ëthey coming not but for to steal
[1:06:38] to kill and destroy but I'm come that

[1:06:48] you what the abundant life is and they
[1:06:50] Rolls Royces and lifestyles of the rich
[1:06:52] and greedy
[1:06:54] rich and famous if that's not the
[1:06:57] abundant life I know that's what pre TV
[1:06:59] preachers say but that's not the
[1:07:01] abundant life and in that day you show
[1:07:04] ask me nothing barely verily I say unto
[1:07:06] you whatsoever you ask the Father my
[1:07:09] name he'll give it to you the speaking

[1:07:12] you asked nothing in my name ask and ye
[1:07:15] shall receive that your joy may be full
[1:07:18] God wants us to have fullness of joy so
[1:07:21] he says in order to get the joy you got
[1:07:23] to ask and then when you ask him believe
[1:07:25] then God will fill your joy
[1:07:28] hallelujah
[1:07:31] keep hanging on just don't doubt just
[1:07:33] keep hanging on to the promise of God
[1:07:34] God will fulfill your joy remember I
[1:07:36] told you that Testament forget this
[1:07:37] testimony his name is brother herb up in
[1:07:40] Sheffield so where we at which direction
[1:07:42] are we pointing here
[1:07:44] and I think where's the parking lot okay
[1:07:46] there's a parking lot right okay so
[1:07:47] north to Sheffield Sheffield's up there
[1:07:50] brother herb is 83 years old I just saw
[1:07:52] him at brother James's funeral he was in
[1:07:55] the message back in the 90s when I came
[1:07:58] in the message in 2001 he's one of the
[1:08:00] first people I met up at Sheffield at
[1:08:01] that time in 2001 none of his children
[1:08:05] were serving God
[1:08:06] 2001 he kept hanging on he cups coming
[1:08:09] to every service he keeps praising God
[1:08:12] he keeps he's an old man now he's got
[1:08:13] gray he's all gray he's got he's an old
[1:08:15] man he's 83 I just seen him a couple
[1:08:17] months ago and I said how you doing he
[1:08:19] said God has brought my two children
[1:08:22] into the message
[1:08:23] now when I met in 16 years ago that
[1:08:26] wasn't the case they were out in the
[1:08:28] world but I walked in there and I got to
[1:08:30] meet his son and his daughter
[1:08:31] they're both now going to the church in
[1:08:34] Sheffield
[1:08:35] his daughter got his hair grunting hair
[1:08:37] she's got long hair now she wear dresses
[1:08:39] now doesn't paint herself up like a like
[1:08:41] a barn door anymore anything like that
[1:08:43] she looks like a godly woman God healed
[1:08:45] her of cancer because of that she's now
[1:08:47] accepted the message of the hour
[1:08:49] but 16 years ago we would not have seen
[1:08:52] that
[1:08:53] you see so we've got to ask him to leave
[1:08:56] and say God give me fullness of joy and
[1:08:59] help me to believe in amen the only
[1:09:02] thing that really brings us joy that
[1:09:03] brother man said is winning souls
[1:09:05] that's the only thing that really gives
[1:09:07] us joy is seeing people come to Christ
[1:09:10] Jesus so see we got to ask and keep
[1:09:12] hanging on who wouldn't new within 16
[1:09:15] years God would have saved those two
[1:09:16] adults and they're in their 50s I'm not
[1:09:19] mistaken fifties or sixties and they're
[1:09:22] grown children now both Baptist and he
[1:09:24] got the seat now his wife died a couple
[1:09:25] years ago before they got saved so he
[1:09:27] had to stay say in faith even though his
[1:09:29] wife passed away and keep believing
[1:09:32] God's gonna fulfill my joy and because
[1:09:35] he was faithful he saw both his children
[1:09:37] baptized in water right in front of his
[1:09:39] face amen that's the joy of the Lord
[1:09:42] amen
[1:09:43] so Seeley must be faithful we must ask
[1:09:46] him believe that our Joy's we made full
[1:09:48] amen now what does abundant mean I
[1:09:51] thought you never asked so here it is
[1:09:54] here's what abundant means in the
[1:09:55] Strong's Concordance
[1:09:57] it means a super abundance it means
[1:10:01] superior in quality
[1:10:04] and I want to make sure I say that it's
[1:10:07] the quality of life that you and I live
[1:10:09] Jesus said I'd give them life that they
[1:10:12] haven't might have it more abundantly
[1:10:15] so you and I live a quality of life
[1:10:18] that's so much higher than a sinner can
[1:10:22] you say amen to that
[1:10:23] sinners got to deal with lie and they
[1:10:25] got to cover up their lies all day
[1:10:26] they're haunted by their lies they're
[1:10:29] haunted by their past they always think
[1:10:32] all is gonna catch up to me and it is
[1:10:33] gonna catch up to them it's the Holy
[1:10:36] Spirit trying to convict them but you
[1:10:38] and I can have such a quality of life
[1:10:40] what do you mean real jest you can go to
[1:10:42] sleep in peace and know that I've
[1:10:44] confessed everything it's under the
[1:10:47] blood of Jesus
[1:10:48] your quality of life is so much greater
[1:10:52] than theirs when
[1:10:53] it comes to Christmas they got to worry
[1:10:56] about a binary big enough president to
[1:10:58] make somebody happy
[1:10:59] yeah they got impressed their boss so
[1:11:01] they got to do this and they're just
[1:11:03] overwhelming stress all these things
[1:11:04] like that but you and I don't when we
[1:11:06] can get people presents but it's all
[1:11:08] based upon love it's not based upon
[1:11:10] competition or worried about our
[1:11:13] wonderful men's are gonna get me
[1:11:14] something for Christmas how can I afford
[1:11:17] to get amen and Adam something you know
[1:11:19] that's just one example of how the
[1:11:21] quality of our life is ought to be
[1:11:23] better we ought to have so much peace we
[1:11:26] have so much joy we ought to have so
[1:11:28] much forgiveness because the quality of
[1:11:30] our life is abundant compared to a
[1:11:32] sinner it's exactly right amen we know
[1:11:36] what the real meaning of Christmas is
[1:11:38] it's not necessarily the coming of the
[1:11:40] son it's the coming of the son in your
[1:11:42] hearts amen that's the real meaning of
[1:11:44] Christmas that Christ will be born in
[1:11:46] the dirty stable of your heart amen and
[1:11:49] if he does so clean it out real fast
[1:11:53] what does it mean Church ask that you're
[1:11:56] giving you life that you have more
[1:11:58] abundantly you have life that has
[1:12:00] advantages to it
[1:12:02] your life as a Christian has advantages
[1:12:05] over the center that they can't even
[1:12:06] imagine
[1:12:08] amen
[1:12:09] think of all the advantages you have
[1:12:11] your attitude
[1:12:13] I've seen it recently in over the last
[1:12:15] few years when there's trouble strikes
[1:12:17] people come to work at school and
[1:12:19] they're so nervous oh what's gonna
[1:12:20] happen violence and all these things in
[1:12:22] nuclear war they're so nervous now
[1:12:24] whether it happens or not that's up to
[1:12:25] God but you and I can have such an
[1:12:27] advantage over them we don't let those
[1:12:29] things bother us there's a certain
[1:12:32] worker you know I'm friends with them
[1:12:34] and they worry about this all the time
[1:12:36] there's like a worrywart and I'll just
[1:12:37] walk in the room and say excuse me can
[1:12:39] help you and those just would say whoa
[1:12:40] they'll just jump there nerves are on
[1:12:42] end all the time but people walk in my
[1:12:44] room I'm like who cares just let them
[1:12:46] walk in I'm a servant of the Lord I'm
[1:12:48] all right everything's gonna be all
[1:12:49] right you I don't live under those
[1:12:51] stresses we don't live under that we
[1:12:53] don't walk on pins and needles we have
[1:12:55] peace with God a man you and I have
[1:12:58] advantages you and I have a quality of
[1:13:00] life that we ought to experience and
[1:13:02] enjoy and know that our life is a much
[1:13:05] better life than a sinners life amen
[1:13:08] it's the quality abundant life is
[1:13:11] quality of life its advantages
[1:13:14] spiritually that we have
[1:13:16] but let me give you an example because
[1:13:18] listen we have Christian advantages but
[1:13:21] when people are living in sin they have
[1:13:22] sinful disadvantages because look at the
[1:13:25] scripture less saying should get at what
[1:13:28] an advantage over us
[1:13:30] see we Jesus promised life abundantly
[1:13:34] life with advantages but if we don't
[1:13:36] serve Jesus then we Satan has advantage
[1:13:38] over us
[1:13:39] see now we're disadvantaged with Christ
[1:13:44] so somebody's gonna have advantage of
[1:13:46] your life who are you giving advantage
[1:13:48] in your life I'm giving Christ advantage
[1:13:50] how do you know because I'm I have the
[1:13:53] quality of God in my life right I know
[1:13:55] how to treat other people I know how if
[1:13:57] I made things right if I make a mistake
[1:13:58] this is what it means advantage means to
[1:14:01] defraud or make a gain we don't want
[1:14:03] Christ that or we don't want Satan to
[1:14:05] get a gain in our life we don't want
[1:14:06] Satan to get a gain on us we want Christ
[1:14:08] to have the victory in our lives
[1:14:11] because the Bible says that they may
[1:14:13] recover themselves out of the snare of
[1:14:15] the devil who are taken captive by him
[1:14:17] at his will so see when Satan has an
[1:14:21] advantage over someone he's taken them
[1:14:23] prisoner they're a prisoner to lust
[1:14:25] their prisoner to greed they're a
[1:14:28] prisoner to fear their prisoner to anger
[1:14:30] that's when Satan has advantages aren't
[1:14:33] you glad for the advantage of Jesus
[1:14:35] setting you free
[1:14:36] I'm so glad Jesus set me free singing
[1:14:39] glory hallelujah Jesus lifted me amen
[1:14:42] that's the advantage that's the abundant
[1:14:45] life that we so desire preachers on TV
[1:14:47] make it out like it's money that just
[1:14:48] brings you more problems and the church
[1:14:51] said
[1:14:52] more money brings you more problems
[1:14:55] right brings you more problems more
[1:14:57] responsibilities more stress if you're
[1:14:59] not ready to handle like Solomon or
[1:15:00] someone who who God could trust with
[1:15:02] that kind of money
[1:15:04] but see this is the advantage of the
[1:15:06] life the abundant life Jesus was talking
[1:15:08] about
[1:15:09] this is the advantage it's not being a
[1:15:12] slave not being captive to Satan but
[1:15:15] actually ruling over Satan amen ruling
[1:15:18] over spiritual darkness huh me love the
[1:15:20] Lord now let me give you one clear
[1:15:23] example and I didn't have time like I
[1:15:25] said I went through all that I had spent
[1:15:26] a lot of time today on this sermon a lot
[1:15:28] of time I spend all my free moments on
[1:15:29] this sermon today but I didn't have as
[1:15:32] much time as I wanted I wanted to find
[1:15:33] more examples where God did more than
[1:15:35] what they asked for I only could come up
[1:15:38] with one so forgive me I I was thinking
[1:15:41] of times where you could see a specific
[1:15:42] prayer and where God did exceedingly
[1:15:45] abundantly more than ask who think I
[1:15:47] just thought another one Jesus with the
[1:15:49] twelve loaves I'm sorry Jesus with the
[1:15:51] loaves and the fish right he gave
[1:15:54] exceedingly abundantly above all they
[1:15:56] could ask or think
[1:15:57] hallelujah there it is that seven
[1:16:00] baskets extra he did Jesus did exceed it
[1:16:03] Jesus prayed and God gave him
[1:16:05] exceedingly abundantly above all he
[1:16:07] could ask your thing there it is right
[1:16:10] there there's two examples okay now
[1:16:11] there's one here's the second the second
[1:16:13] one's Hannah I've been preaching on
[1:16:14] Hannah
[1:16:15] I've been preaching on Hannah well
[1:16:17] Brandon said Hannah was a barren woman
[1:16:19] in the Bible she wanted a son and she
[1:16:21] got the fasting for him
[1:16:22] she fasted and prayed until she even the
[1:16:25] priest at the temple thought she was
[1:16:26] drunk she
[1:16:28] was in such desperation with the rest of
[1:16:31] the women watching what kind of bun it
[1:16:32] the other one had wore you know how it
[1:16:34] goes other ones seeing what kind of
[1:16:36] clothes they had on and talking about
[1:16:37] the things going on in the farm but not
[1:16:39] Hannah she stepped right through the
[1:16:41] whole crowd and went to the altar she
[1:16:43] had been fasting she wanted her reproach
[1:16:45] taken away what a difference it is today
[1:16:48] it's almost her approach to have a child
[1:16:50] then it was it was a reproach not to
[1:16:53] have one and
[1:16:54] she got her knees and she never noticed
[1:16:58] the dignity of the people she never
[1:16:59] noticed the dignified priest as he
[1:17:01] walked out she was in such distressed so
[1:17:03] the tears was rolling down her cheeks
[1:17:05] and she was crying and desperation Oh
[1:17:07] Lord God give me a son give me a son
[1:17:11] what she asked for a son what did God
[1:17:15] give her a prophet
[1:17:18] okay man and I was a studying today this
[1:17:21] thought felt like it'd come down from
[1:17:23] heaven to me I just remember this quote
[1:17:25] this quote where brother Graham said
[1:17:27] this he gave her a extra blessing so God
[1:17:30] gave Hannah
[1:17:31] exceedingly abundantly above all she
[1:17:35] could ask her
[1:17:37] that shows there's a difference between
[1:17:39] just a man and a prophet glory a prophet
[1:17:43] is one that God will speak with lip to
[1:17:45] ear hallelujah and notice she wasn't
[1:17:48] selfish when she prayed when God heard
[1:17:51] her and answered her prayer and gave her
[1:17:53] a son she gave him back to God and
[1:17:56] because that she was willing not to be
[1:17:59] selfish after God had answered her
[1:18:01] prayer he gave her a prophet oh that was
[1:18:04] an extra blessing oh he's just full of
[1:18:08] them those little extra blessings that
[1:18:11] he gives
[1:18:12] she asks for a son and God said I'm
[1:18:14] doing more than that I'm giving you a
[1:18:16] prophet I don't know yeah I love that so
[1:18:20] that's what the Holy Spirit brought to
[1:18:21] me as I studied this
[1:18:23] exceedingly abundantly when did God do
[1:18:25] this when I got two examples I got Jesus
[1:18:27] with the the loaves and the fish and now
[1:18:29] I've got Hannah Hannah asked for a son
[1:18:31] God gave her more God gave her profit
[1:18:34] not only son but a profit and there had
[1:18:36] been no open vision for many many years
[1:18:38] in Israel Samuel the first prophet for
[1:18:40] many many years because a mother got
[1:18:42] desperate
[1:18:44] that she could have no churn she was
[1:18:47] past the age of barren probably 67 years
[1:18:49] old and she prayed with desperation she
[1:18:50] must have this child what was it God had
[1:18:53] spoke to her no doubt you can't be
[1:18:56] desperate so God speaks co-chair rise
[1:18:58] and shake yourself pinch your conscience
[1:19:00] wake yourself up in the hour we must be
[1:19:03] desperate or perish there's coming for
[1:19:04] something from the Lord I know it as
[1:19:06] thus saith the Lord there's coming for
[1:19:09] something and we better get desperate
[1:19:10] it's between life and death it'll pass
[1:19:12] through us and we won't see it because
[1:19:14] that she wasn't selfish she was given a
[1:19:17] prophet I mean love the Lord I
[1:19:21] thought that was beautiful
[1:19:24] unto it's able to do exceedingly
[1:19:27] abundantly above all that we ask or
[1:19:29] think according to the power that
[1:19:32] worketh in us
[1:19:34] hallelujah
[1:19:36] amen I'll try to think of another one
[1:19:38] there but enough to move on now I want
[1:19:40] to bring this up and after I thought it
[1:19:42] actually before I thought of this
[1:19:43] thought about Hannah when the Holy
[1:19:45] Spirit brought that to me I was actually
[1:19:47] thinking of a quote I heard brother
[1:19:48] Branham say about the trip that he made
[1:19:51] to South Africa in 1951 he made a trip
[1:19:54] there and this this takes the other side
[1:19:58] of exceedingly abundantly so I showed
[1:20:00] you the good side of exceeding
[1:20:02] abundantly now I'm going to show you the
[1:20:03] opposite side of missing the exceedingly
[1:20:07] abundantly
[1:20:08] because this you will never receive
[1:20:11] exceedingly abundantly in the permissive
[1:20:13] will of God help me understand what I'm
[1:20:15] saying you can't expect God to bless you
[1:20:18] abundantly over and over and over if
[1:20:20] you're disobeying things in the Word of
[1:20:22] God if we keep the Word of God like
[1:20:25] Jesus did God bless the food the fish
[1:20:27] the loaves and you keep it like Hannah
[1:20:29] did God give you more he'll give you a
[1:20:31] profit
[1:20:32] but if we break the Word of God we
[1:20:35] cannot expect to receive the exceeding
[1:20:37] abundantly the higher quality of life or
[1:20:40] our super spiritual advantages right
[1:20:44] quality and advantages we can't expect a
[1:20:47] higher quality of life or spiritual
[1:20:49] Vantage's if we're breaking the Word of
[1:20:51] God
[1:20:52] now here's the context of this quote it
[1:20:55] was either 1951 or 1952 brother Graham
[1:20:57] went on a South Africa trip brother
[1:20:59] branham disobeyed the angel Lord and
[1:21:00] almost died of amoebas I don't remember
[1:21:03] this story didn't remember this story
[1:21:04] okay
[1:21:06] they started off I think in Johannesburg
[1:21:08] I don't remember exactly which one it
[1:21:10] was but brother Branham the angel Lord
[1:21:12] said stay in Johannesburg but the man
[1:21:15] that he was working with had a certain
[1:21:17] itinerary and
[1:21:19] they were only going to go to the
[1:21:21] pastor's churches that they liked
[1:21:23] instead of instead of preaching to the
[1:21:25] masses that the thousands of thousands
[1:21:28] they were gonna go to real tiny small
[1:21:29] little churches
[1:21:31] where this gift of God was meant to go
[1:21:33] to the masses it was meant to go to the
[1:21:36] big groups
[1:21:39] brother Bosworth came to brother
[1:21:40] brandman and said this now they were
[1:21:42] starting to get an argument by the band
[1:21:43] was saying no we're supposed to say in
[1:21:45] Johannesburg and they're saying no we
[1:21:46] got to take you south but brother
[1:21:48] Bosworth came up with some brother
[1:21:49] branham I think you're wrong he said I
[1:21:51] believe if you'll go down that way
[1:21:52] around Cape Town you'll see exceedingly
[1:21:54] the abundantly the best you've ever seen
[1:21:58] in all your life and their sense brother
[1:21:59] Bosworth as a witness so brother Branham
[1:22:01] is telling this story in July of 1952
[1:22:04] and brother Bosworth is sitting in the
[1:22:05] congregation so you know he's telling
[1:22:07] the truth I said brother Bosworth as
[1:22:10] long as I've been with you and you seen
[1:22:11] those visions and seeing how they come
[1:22:13] to pass I tell you now in the name of
[1:22:15] Lord that is not God's will for us to do
[1:22:18] that where to go to Durban not down to
[1:22:20] Cape Town and you mean to tell me and
[1:22:23] brother Bosworth said well he said I
[1:22:25] wonder if it could have been a false
[1:22:26] vision you had brother Branham and how
[1:22:28] many those prophets don't get false
[1:22:29] visions they don't get balls missions I
[1:22:32] said well brother Bosworth there's
[1:22:35] nearly my second daddy the man I love so
[1:22:38] he's right there in the service very
[1:22:40] bosom friend of mine I looked and I said
[1:22:41] oh god have mercy
[1:22:43] 15,000 miles away from home and there my
[1:22:45] manager and brother backs were brother
[1:22:47] Baxter brother Bosworth and everybody
[1:22:49] and I said God what can I do I walked
[1:22:51] back in there and I said brother I'm
[1:22:52] trapped but not in God I tell you the
[1:22:54] name of Lord I shall not take that way
[1:22:56] there and
[1:22:57] they said it is or is it well somebody
[1:23:01] thought up and said could it end me the
[1:23:02] permissive will of God
[1:23:03] well then something was named about the
[1:23:06] permissive and I said pray with me Billy
[1:23:08] we knelt down in the course he got tired
[1:23:10] you don't know much about it so he went
[1:23:12] to bed I stayed there along towards 3
[1:23:14] o'clock in the morning I raised up I
[1:23:16] felt I just like a man sitting there he
[1:23:19] moved around this side so I'm not the
[1:23:20] angel the Lord and I said my lord what
[1:23:23] are these men telling me out there so
[1:23:25] let me just tell a little bit more of
[1:23:27] the story
[1:23:29] brother Branham eventually decides to
[1:23:31] listen to these men he was going to side
[1:23:34] with them his son Billy Paul was saying
[1:23:36] no just do what the Lord said do what
[1:23:38] the Lord said and his managers saying no
[1:23:39] you got to follow all these all these
[1:23:42] preachers stay with the preachers and
[1:23:44] now that after all these days of
[1:23:47] battling back and forth the angel Lord
[1:23:48] comes and tells brother Branham he's
[1:23:50] going to you to go in the permissive
[1:23:52] will of God because brother branham
[1:23:53] wouldn't obey the angel the Lord at
[1:23:56] first he wouldn't obey the the vision he
[1:23:59] wouldn't obey it so the angel says fine
[1:24:00] then have the permissive will of God but
[1:24:02] you're gonna suffer for it now Church
[1:24:04] think about times we've suffered our
[1:24:06] lives because we obeyed the Word of God
[1:24:08] I'm sorry disobey the Word of God if we
[1:24:11] break the Word of God then we can expect
[1:24:13] what suffering
[1:24:15] so the angel Lord said go with them go
[1:24:18] on but you'll pay for it said you're
[1:24:21] trapped but you'll pay for go on with
[1:24:23] them I'll give you permission to go but
[1:24:25] remember you'll pay for and he said for
[1:24:27] that go wake up your boy he honored
[1:24:29] Billy Paul cos Billy Paul said obey the
[1:24:31] vision
[1:24:32] he said go wake up your boy because
[1:24:35] Billy Paul had the truth and he said
[1:24:37] come go wake up your boy and tell him in
[1:24:38] the morning it's going to be a pretty
[1:24:39] day the storm and things will clear away
[1:24:41] in the morning it'll be a pretty day and
[1:24:43] they'll want you to pray for the sick at
[1:24:44] Sunday school I will bless it he said
[1:24:46] and Billy is going to come out for you
[1:24:48] and a man a young fella in the little
[1:24:49] black car that's gonna pick you up
[1:24:51] another boy on the road and on the road
[1:24:54] back there's going to be a native a
[1:24:55] colored man we we call it they're
[1:24:57] standing by you know eucalyptus tree
[1:24:59] near a bridge fixing to strike another
[1:25:01] one he has got a white safari suit on
[1:25:04] fixing to strike another one with the
[1:25:06] stick tell your boy that and tell those
[1:25:08] men that they'll know that it's thus
[1:25:10] saith the Lord
[1:25:12] now everything happened according to the
[1:25:14] vision but as soon as they left and as
[1:25:17] soon as they went to the Cape Town
[1:25:18] brother branham says this and brother
[1:25:20] Bosworth you're a witness of God the
[1:25:22] very next meeting hell broke loose see
[1:25:26] when you when we get in the permissive
[1:25:28] will of God that's when trouble happens
[1:25:30] because we have to reap what we've
[1:25:33] planted right whatever sees we plant if
[1:25:36] we if we compromise and break the Word
[1:25:39] of God then we're gonna so we're gonna
[1:25:41] so reap what we sow we're gonna have to
[1:25:43] bear the consequences of breaking the
[1:25:45] Word of God
[1:25:47] he said trouble set in it was the way it
[1:25:51] was that way till we plumb got to Durban
[1:25:53] and there in Durban we're nearly a
[1:25:55] hundred thousand people gathered for the
[1:25:56] meeting so forth there's where the
[1:25:58] thirty thousand conference was in one
[1:26:00] day on the road around I got a great
[1:26:02] brother Baxter got sick first he got
[1:26:05] sick Billy got sick all of them got sick
[1:26:07] all of my bunch Billy and I and brother
[1:26:09] Baxter then I got sick I got really sick
[1:26:11] I mean I was so sick I couldn't even get
[1:26:13] to the Pope at Harley I just stand so
[1:26:16] weak so sick my and come to find out I
[1:26:18] caught African amoeba
[1:26:20] the Brethren told me I could have in my
[1:26:22] church and oh now I'm skipping ahead
[1:26:26] so see these preachers were saying oh we
[1:26:28] can have in our church you need to bring
[1:26:29] broadband to our church and poor oh
[1:26:32] brother Bosworth he said I never seen
[1:26:33] him out of humor in his life he come
[1:26:35] back up to the house and said let's take
[1:26:36] a walk we went walking said brother
[1:26:38] branham did you ever hear of such it's
[1:26:40] ridiculous so now brother Bosworth gets
[1:26:42] upset with all the preachers wanting
[1:26:44] their itinerary and what does brother
[1:26:45] Branham say he said of course brother
[1:26:47] Bosworth that's the seating Lee
[1:26:49] abundantly
[1:26:50] so see he's kind of mocking him and
[1:26:52] joking around in other words you're the
[1:26:54] one who wanted this exceedingly
[1:26:55] abundantly and this is what we're
[1:26:57] reaping because you compromise on the
[1:27:00] vision of the Lord beseech a joke see I
[1:27:04] thought this was all this exceedingly
[1:27:05] abundantly all this trouble all this
[1:27:07] arguing with ministers all this
[1:27:08] political mess with ministers see we're
[1:27:10] reaping what we so what we planted back
[1:27:13] there because we disobeyed the Word of
[1:27:14] God
[1:27:15] then brother Branham said I suffered for
[1:27:18] and I'm gonna skip past this he went
[1:27:21] back to the United States sick he didn't
[1:27:23] get better he got worse and he got so
[1:27:26] worse he had actually missed preaching
[1:27:28] appointments for eight months can you
[1:27:30] imagine me being out from today what is
[1:27:32] it it's almost December December January
[1:27:34] February March April May June July he
[1:27:36] imagined me not being in church till
[1:27:37] July next year be like where's the
[1:27:40] pastor I don't know who would anybody
[1:27:42] come if I wasn't here would we have
[1:27:44] anybody here to lead songs we would have
[1:27:46] here lead songs we would be here to
[1:27:47] preach imagine me being out eight months
[1:27:49] brother band was out of preaching eight
[1:27:51] months he laid in a bed all because he
[1:27:54] disobeyed the vision of the Lord
[1:27:56] and brother Bosworth he said here's
[1:27:59] another thing I speak this name of Lord
[1:28:00] before he went to Africa he was in
[1:28:03] Shreveport and he spoke and Naima Lord
[1:28:05] and said Satan has a trap set for me so
[1:28:07] God told him there's a trap but he
[1:28:09] missed the trap
[1:28:10] he said in Africa there's something you
[1:28:13] all pray for me little did I know it was
[1:28:15] among my brother those are the worst
[1:28:18] kinds aren't they church
[1:28:19] those are the worst kinds of traps when
[1:28:22] they happen right in the church
[1:28:24] it's a lot easier when it's people
[1:28:26] outside the church it's a lot easier
[1:28:29] right because you can just brought you
[1:28:31] can just recognize oh this is the devil
[1:28:33] but Satan's more sly when he uses people
[1:28:36] right and Bride of Christ fellowship to
[1:28:39] try to get you to compromise oh you
[1:28:40] don't do that brother Jesse just
[1:28:42] preaches too hard on that you know you
[1:28:43] could even compromise on that a little
[1:28:45] bit
[1:28:46] how other people the church do it to
[1:28:49] you understand it's more deceptive when
[1:28:53] Satan uses somebody amongst the church
[1:28:56] David said the same thing he said if a
[1:28:58] sinner would have spoke bad about me he
[1:29:00] said I could have born but it was one
[1:29:02] that I ate with it was one who I had
[1:29:04] great fellowship with and that hurt more
[1:29:06] than anything isn't that true the pains
[1:29:08] that her hardest are those that you
[1:29:10] receive in the house of your friends
[1:29:14] brother Ram said he went to pray he
[1:29:16] knelt down before and he said it seemed
[1:29:18] like God said next time you'll listen so
[1:29:22] brother man eventually he prayed and
[1:29:23] fasted he said three in the morning the
[1:29:24] angel came to the Lord angel or came to
[1:29:26] him eight months later angel Lord came
[1:29:29] and said he said is this ameba gonna be
[1:29:31] gone and he said I'll never bother you
[1:29:32] again he said he woke up the next day
[1:29:34] and ran to the doctor and said test me
[1:29:36] said I just tested yesterday he said
[1:29:38] test me I had a vision it's the state
[1:29:39] the Lord
[1:29:40] dr. Derek tested him and didn't have any
[1:29:42] more amoebas supernatural miracle but I
[1:29:45] wanted you to see both sides of
[1:29:48] exceedingly abundantly blessed like
[1:29:50] Hannah like Jesus with the food or
[1:29:53] missing the exceeding abundantly because
[1:29:56] we compromised on the word
[1:29:58] we can not expect an advantage over
[1:30:01] temptation if we compromise on the
[1:30:05] following if we let unconfessed sins go
[1:30:07] if we rob god of tithes and offerings
[1:30:10] with our finances how can we expect
[1:30:11] exceedingly abundantly if we skip the
[1:30:13] worship or don't hear all the preaching
[1:30:15] of the word how can we expect to get
[1:30:16] hungry for the word if we're skipping
[1:30:18] the word if we skip our devotions if we
[1:30:21] don't read and pray in the morning how
[1:30:22] are we gonna get renewed every day how
[1:30:24] are we gonna get a fresh painting how we
[1:30:26] gonna get fresh carpet how's our life
[1:30:27] gonna feel fresh if we don't get
[1:30:29] renovated every morning and how are we
[1:30:32] gonna get exceeding abundant if we're
[1:30:33] not feeding on the if we're feeding on
[1:30:35] the world instead of the word if we're
[1:30:37] spending more time on our phones or more
[1:30:39] time on social media or more time on the
[1:30:42] magazines then we are in the Word of God
[1:30:44] how are we gonna get exceedingly
[1:30:46] abundantly above all we asked her think
[1:30:48] we're not because we won't have the
[1:30:51] power inside of us we got to have the
[1:30:53] power in our lives amen we got to have
[1:30:57] power these things keep the power from
[1:30:59] us we have to have power in us
[1:31:02] then we'll see exceedingly abundantly
[1:31:05] above all we ask or think
[1:31:07] that's close let's try to finish out
[1:31:09] this chapter well I've been if you like
[1:31:11] I've been in this chapter forever
[1:31:12] chapter 3 see Frank it's been alone
[1:31:14] because it's a really deep chapter so
[1:31:17] really thick just think of the glory of
[1:31:20] God I'll say thick like honey in the
[1:31:22] rock cave and thick like honey
[1:31:25] been a real deep chapter on to him be
[1:31:29] glory in the church by Jesus Christ
[1:31:30] throughout all ages world without end
[1:31:33] amen I stand on our feet I just want to
[1:31:35] show you a few things I
[1:31:36] just want to point out just a couple
[1:31:39] things I want to rehearse a few things
[1:31:40] with you
[1:31:44] unto him that can do exceedingly
[1:31:46] abundantly
[1:31:48] give us major advantages give us such
[1:31:51] high quality of life how many 1 a high
[1:31:53] quality life
[1:31:54] he can give us such a higher quality
[1:31:57] he'd give us such a higher advantage
[1:31:58] over Satan that's what I want Church as
[1:32:01] advantages over Satan advantages over
[1:32:03] temptation how do we get that by letting
[1:32:05] the power of God flow through us
[1:32:07] remembering the how much love God for
[1:32:09] has for us right and then if we have
[1:32:11] this then the Bible said unto Him be
[1:32:14] glue working throughout all the ages God
[1:32:16] has got glory in every Church age right
[1:32:18] now we're on this church age but he's
[1:32:20] gonna get glory in a lukewarm
[1:32:23] sin loving church age he's gonna get
[1:32:25] glory out of some word loving saints
[1:32:28] amen some hot on fire Saints he's gonna
[1:32:31] get love right he's gonna let our love
[1:32:34] like the scripture said he's gonna get
[1:32:36] glory because of our love for him in
[1:32:38] this age God's gonna find someone who
[1:32:41] loves him and member he said as many as
[1:32:43] I love I rebuke them and chasing them so
[1:32:48] if you love Christ expect to get rebuked
[1:32:50] expect to get chasing but then after
[1:32:53] that he'll love you even more
[1:32:54] now I'm closing with this after right
[1:32:58] now this is the possible order of
[1:32:59] endtime events I don't think sister
[1:33:01] Connie has ever seen this but this is
[1:33:02] the order brother Branham taught us
[1:33:03] brother Branham said right now we are at
[1:33:05] the binding of the tares never know that
[1:33:10] next comes the rapture of course after
[1:33:12] we believe a squeeze is gonna happen how
[1:33:13] many believe the squeeze is gonna happen
[1:33:14] with all my heart I believe that but the
[1:33:16] Bramson is scriptural the temptation
[1:33:19] that comes upon the whole world so the
[1:33:21] binding of the tares they're uniting in
[1:33:23] their ecumenical council they're gonna
[1:33:24] bring pressure from the government's put
[1:33:26] pressure on the church it's gonna bring
[1:33:28] a squeeze during that squeeze time
[1:33:30] cheese is gonna rapture his bride off
[1:33:31] the earth
[1:33:32] after that we enjoy I'm sorry during
[1:33:35] that that's called the first
[1:33:36] resurrection during that time when we're
[1:33:39] up at the marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:33:41] they're going through tribulation we
[1:33:44] come back as the army of God at the
[1:33:46] Battle of Armageddon emember Christ is
[1:33:49] gonna get glory through all these ages
[1:33:52] he's gonna get glory in the tribulation
[1:33:54] by what pouring his wrath out and he
[1:33:57] gets glory as we feast with him at the
[1:33:59] marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:34:01] he gets glory throughout all ages world
[1:34:04] without end and
[1:34:07] then he gets glory in the Battle of
[1:34:09] Armageddon
[1:34:10] right when he comes back now at that
[1:34:12] point member of the earth is burned with
[1:34:14] fire because we have to walk out into
[1:34:16] the millennium on the ashes of the
[1:34:18] wicked
[1:34:19] so before we can step foot on the earth
[1:34:21] before Christ was step foot on the earth
[1:34:23] after that great battle he has to burn
[1:34:25] it all over then we step down for the
[1:34:27] honeymoon
[1:34:28] and he's gonna get glory in the
[1:34:29] honeymoon how many looking forward to
[1:34:30] that honeymoon oh I can't wait to give
[1:34:32] him glory all throughout the thousand
[1:34:34] years amen before I speak before I think
[1:34:36] it he'll already answer me
[1:34:39] that's what Isaiah said before I ask it
[1:34:43] he'll answer already well that's love
[1:34:45] right there
[1:34:47] next in this age then Satan's loosed for
[1:34:50] a little season that's the Battle of Gog
[1:34:52] and Magog that Satan's demise after that
[1:34:54] he's tossing the lake of fire and next
[1:34:57] is the white throne judgment that's
[1:34:58] another age of time there another span
[1:35:01] of time the white throne judgment all
[1:35:03] men women must stand before the judgment
[1:35:05] seat of Christ
[1:35:07] that's the second resurrection I'm sorry
[1:35:09] I got cut off that's the second
[1:35:10] resurrection so the rapture is the first
[1:35:12] resurrection all the dead in Christ rise
[1:35:14] first we'll see them we'll meet them
[1:35:16] together in the clouds the second
[1:35:17] resurrection is where everybody else all
[1:35:20] these ashes of all these dead people all
[1:35:23] those ashes will be brought back those
[1:35:25] souls will be brought back those bodies
[1:35:26] will be brought back but we brought back
[1:35:28] to the white throne judgment and then we
[1:35:30] know after that after that all the
[1:35:32] sinners are put in the lake of fire and
[1:35:34] then we enter into the final age the new
[1:35:37] heavens and the new earth
[1:35:39] this earth now let's guys got a fire
[1:35:42] baptism now the capstone comes down and
