[0:00] the 101 lays the foundation so I just
[0:02] want to go back to the foundations of a
[0:03] home church so let's go to 1
[0:06] Timothy
[0:08] 3 and then we'll go to Hebrews 10 very
[0:10] familiar scriptures here but I just want
[0:13] to take it here tonight by God's grace
[0:14] brother the Patrick God bless you sir
[0:16] how you doing good real good thank you
[0:18] sir good to see you tonight 1 Timothy 3
[0:22] and I might even shorten the the reading
[0:23] here just to reserve time it's already 7
[0:25] o'clock
[0:28] here first Timothy three I wanted to do
[0:31] one through seven but I imagine we'll
[0:32] just read it
[0:35] um uh later on but let's just go to four
[0:38] and five let's go to verses four and
[0:41] five you know as a pastor I don't always
[0:43] like preaching on my duties or
[0:45] responsibilities but I'm going to do
[0:46] that tonight I don't do a lot of it um I
[0:49] just haven't had to after 18 years of
[0:50] Pastor and you know most people
[0:52] understand or have heard of the
[0:53] scriptures but uh we'll go over this
[0:55] here tonight by God's grace uh because
[0:57] of all the circumstances and I'll Trust
[1:00] be a blessing to you by God's grace
[1:02] verse four one that ruleth well his own
[1:05] house having his children in subjection
[1:07] with all gravity for if a man know not
[1:11] how to rule his own house how shall he
[1:14] take care of the Church of God so notice
[1:17] there's one man who takes care of the
[1:19] Church of God the local church and the
[1:22] way we know he can do it is because how
[1:24] he handles his house his own house the
[1:27] pre the prerequisite for being a pastor
[1:29] is having a Godly house in order
[1:32] Hallelujah that's the that's the
[1:33] prerequisite okay so Hebrews 10:24 and
[1:36] 25 and here where we're seeing where
[1:37] we're supposed to gather more as we see
[1:39] that day approaching praise God Hebrews
[1:41] 10 24 and 25 we can all read
[1:55] this Hebrews 10:24 and 25 very familiar
[1:59] uh scripture we'll read these here but
[2:01] God bless brother
[2:02] Mercy let's read this on three ready one
[2:04] two three and let us consider one
[2:07] another to provoke unto love and to Good
[2:11] Works not forsaking the assembling of
[2:14] ourselves together as the manner of some
[2:17] is but exhorting one another and so much
[2:21] the more as ye see that day approaching
[2:25] may God add his Blessing to the reading
[2:26] of the word you can be seated
[2:30] I do have some uh quotes here and
[2:31] scriptures so have your Bible handy I'm
[2:33] going to start with the the the 101 or
[2:36] the scriptural foundation for a home
[2:37] church and uh then by God's grace we'll
[2:41] I got numerous quotes from uh the
[2:42] prophet here that picture might look
[2:44] familiar if you've been here a long time
[2:46] that I used that in 2015 when I when we
[2:48] had the Pennsylvania Saints moving and
[2:50] we were over in that other Sanctuary
[2:51] over there I did a series on the home
[2:53] church so I'm just recycling that from
[2:55] 10 years ago hard to believe it's been
[2:56] 10 years we've been in this facility
[2:58] here by God's grace um but we did we
[3:00] read our text here tonight and I'd like
[3:02] to just do a Bible teaching on the home
[3:03] church and try to lay this out here um
[3:06] to give us an understanding here uh how
[3:09] the home church has
[3:11] operated and I think it'll help us give
[3:13] more clarity on uh uh current situations
[3:16] here so uh to start with you know
[3:18] where's a pastor found the Bible it's
[3:20] Ephesians 4:11 so You' got your Bibles
[3:22] we'll go to that here and like I said
[3:23] we'll just try to be quickly through
[3:25] here I spent most of my time on quotes
[3:27] today because I that's where I needed to
[3:28] spend most of my time digging through
[3:30] and finding quotes uh by God's grace so
[3:33] I didn't get time to put all the
[3:34] scriptures on here but most of you are
[3:36] are pretty familiar if I started reading
[3:38] it you might be able to finish it uh the
[3:40] verse verse 11 uh and he gave some
[3:43] Apostles and some prophets and some
[3:46] evangelists and some pastors and
[3:48] teachers now the word pastor means
[3:50] Shepherd and the shepherd has to be just
[3:52] like all the others has to be different
[3:54] from all others that's why it's
[3:56] differentiated uh you have the Apostle
[3:58] Apostle means one cent so Pastor is not
[4:00] sent a pastor stays an apostle is sent
[4:04] out to start new churches right uh the
[4:07] prophet is not the pastor the prophet is
[4:09] the one who speaks in the name of the
[4:11] Lord foretells things interprets the
[4:13] word of God hallelujah and he's not one
[4:16] who stays uh the teacher is not one who
[4:19] stays he's not the shepherd he's the one
[4:20] that gives very deep instruction in the
[4:23] things of God hallelujah and the
[4:25] Evangelist doesn't say the Evangelist
[4:27] goes like in a circuit we saw it with
[4:28] Samuel in the Old Testament he he was a
[4:30] prophet but he he demonstrated that and
[4:31] then we see in the book of Acts Paul and
[4:33] Barnabas said let us go unto the
[4:35] churches that we've already started
[4:36] let's see how they do and we see Philip
[4:38] the Evangelist in Acts chapter 8 going
[4:40] to Samaria he does signs wonders and
[4:42] miracles stir up the faith of the people
[4:45] uh so we see different Ministries so uh
[4:48] with regarding the home Church a
[4:49] Shepherd Faithfully ministers to the
[4:51] Sheep stays there with the Sheep uh we
[4:54] know all Christians can't travel along
[4:56] with the Apostle right not all of us can
[4:59] afford to get on the planes and go on
[5:00] all every trip with the Apostle can we
[5:02] or the Evangelist nor do us some of us
[5:04] have the energy right and brother Jesse
[5:06] said amen hallelujah sister Kristen said
[5:09] amen we all said amen so uh if God's
[5:13] called you to a Ministry he'll back up
[5:15] he'll back up your ministry and then
[5:17] he'll open doors for your ministry the
[5:19] Bible said in Proverbs a man's gift
[5:21] makes room for
[5:22] himself so my gift to Pastor made its
[5:25] way uh I never thought I'd be a pastor
[5:27] but what happened to Tim Myers who
[5:28] started this this Fellowship he moved
[5:30] down to North Carolina there's only one
[5:32] person left who's a preacher that was me
[5:34] I didn't have to push my way into this I
[5:36] didn't have to do politics to become a
[5:38] pastor I was the only one on the ballot
[5:40] to be Pastor I never I never had to push
[5:42] myself into this and neither will anyone
[5:44] who's really called of God God will open
[5:46] it up to them you know even in the old
[5:48] Bible days no one even voted in the
[5:50] Bible days voting wasn't even in the
[5:52] Bible it was just God's leadership of
[5:55] men who were filled with the Holy Ghost
[5:57] right but as we passed along in time you
[5:59] know uh it's just been uh it's been one
[6:01] thing the church has adopted I think
[6:03] it's a good thing brother Bram said it's
[6:04] a good thing brother Bram said the vote
[6:06] of the church is the will of the Holy
[6:08] Ghost so brother said the the Holy Ghost
[6:10] now speaks through
[6:13] voting and so our church doesn't vote
[6:15] every year uh it's up to the discretion
[6:17] of the pastor we really only have a
[6:19] couple uh a couple offices really and I
[6:23] feel most of them by God's grace but
[6:25] that's because nobody else want to do
[6:26] other ones or they're not uh they're not
[6:27] fit to do them right you have to meet
[6:29] the quality ifications and so by God's
[6:32] grace that falls on me but every church
[6:33] is unique and and brother Bram did that
[6:35] when he first started his church he said
[6:36] he was everything he was song leader
[6:38] Deacon Pastor trustee he said you name
[6:40] it Pastor he was everything and so God
[6:44] has all kinds of varieties Hallelujah so
[6:47] uh you we see the pastor is different
[6:48] from all others uh you know Hebrews
[6:50] 10:24 says we gather more well where do
[6:52] we where do sheep gather if we're if
[6:54] we're the flock of God remember Peter
[6:55] said feed the flock of God right uh it's
[6:59] also said in Acts chapter 20 feed the
[7:01] flock of God Paul told Paul told the
[7:03] Ephesians well where do where do the
[7:04] where do the Flock go they go to a
[7:06] Shepherd right they stay with the
[7:08] shepherd so we can see if we're going to
[7:10] gather more and it's going to be one of
[7:12] these gifts uh where are the people
[7:13] going to gather they're going to go to
[7:14] the pastor to Shepherd them and also you
[7:17] know we read this on Sunday but uh in
[7:19] Matthew 18 Jesus said if there's a sin
[7:21] tell it to the church now he didn't mean
[7:23] the whole church worldwide uh Paul would
[7:25] had been Paul and I think about that
[7:27] every Pastor would had been sending
[7:28] letters to every every church every
[7:30] Christian Church in the whole world
[7:31] telling people sins so that that's
[7:34] impossible right and that's that's not
[7:36] what it was meant to do uh Jesus gave us
[7:38] instruction how the local church handles
[7:40] sin tell it to the local church right
[7:44] Paul wasn't saying you know the entire
[7:46] world the entire wild worldwide of
[7:48] Believers needs to know every sin and
[7:50] every uh disagreement or transgression
[7:52] in the in in the whole world it was just
[7:55] to the local church so if you put these
[7:57] things in context uh they they're very
[7:59] well understood uh by the grace of God
[8:02] now I just thought this too I found this
[8:03] and I'm going to just read this here uh
[8:06] by God's grace I I I knew this but I
[8:08] went and looked it up you know when when
[8:11] uh I looked at last week remember we
[8:12] looked at how um Babylon came in and
[8:14] dispersed uh the is is Israelis right
[8:17] destroyed the temple a lot of those Jews
[8:20] were taken to Babylon and they didn't
[8:22] want to lose their Fai so what did they
[8:23] do they started weekly meetings on the
[8:26] Sabbath which was for them Sundown
[8:28] Friday night to sundown uh Saturday
[8:31] night right because that's when the new
[8:32] day started at sundown so so for Jews it
[8:35] would already be Thursday for the Jews
[8:36] right now it already to be there
[8:38] Thursday right because the day ends When
[8:39] the Sun Goes Down start the new day
[8:42] starts uh but this started there in
[8:45] Babylon so they focused on prayer uh
[8:48] scripture reading and teaching in
[8:50] Babylon or wherever they were scattered
[8:51] Assyria I mean the Bible said all
[8:53] nations God said I'll scatter you to All
[8:55] Nations and so he
[8:57] did um and then during the time of the
[8:59] second temple zal's temple synagogues
[9:02] were established so once all the Jews or
[9:04] not all the Jews but once the Jews
[9:05] started coming back they started putting
[9:07] synagogues all over Israel and
[9:10] synagogues were just like little
[9:11] churches little centers of worship study
[9:14] and uh they were to supplement because
[9:16] that's what they had to do in Babylon
[9:17] they just met at synagogues they
[9:18] couldn't do animal sacrifices so once
[9:21] they got back well now they can do
[9:22] animal sacrifices but they like the
[9:23] weekly Gatherings and that was under the
[9:26] blood of bulls and
[9:27] goats what about under the Holy Ghost
[9:30] hallelujah how much more we appreciate
[9:32] weekly Gatherings Hallelujah that's
[9:35] right and so they uh after they returned
[9:39] they started doing the synagogues they
[9:40] just built different synagogues and if
[9:42] you know your Bible right we looked at a
[9:43] few weeks ago uh Luke 4:16 said Jesus
[9:46] his custom was always to go to the
[9:48] synagogue on the Sabbath so Jesus and
[9:51] all his Apostles right all his Apostles
[9:53] would have echoed him right or mimicked
[9:55] him imitated him and so they all would
[9:58] have went to the synagogue and every
[9:59] Saturday so Jesus Christ gives us this
[10:01] Foundation of what we call a home Church
[10:04] it started out of necessity now think
[10:06] about that I'm so glad I live in the New
[10:08] Testament I'm so glad I don't live in
[10:10] the Old Testament in the Old Testament
[10:11] you only appeared before God three
[10:13] times right that's far as
[10:16] required right you had to make a big
[10:18] sacrifice if you live far away Northern
[10:20] Israel or Southern you had to make a big
[10:22] sacrifice to go there but God required
[10:23] it if you're a Jew you got to go three
[10:25] times a year at the main three festivals
[10:27] right we've been through that the the
[10:29] seven feasts but a lot of them are kind
[10:30] of tied together close together right
[10:33] and so those are the three times and and
[10:34] so if you live far away you'd only go to
[10:36] church three three times out of the year
[10:38] as far now you might stay seven days to
[10:39] do all the feast days and you might be
[10:41] there for a week or more beyond that but
[10:44] you didn't get much fellowships think
[10:46] about that all that time you spend the
[10:47] rest of the year away from church I'm
[10:49] glad we can come here and worship God we
[10:51] can see one another multiple times a
[10:53] week hallelujah what a joy Hallelujah so
[10:57] no doubt the New Testament is so much a
[10:58] better Covenant Hallelujah with better
[11:01] promises amen but see they would spend
[11:04] months away from each other it been
[11:05] months since I saw brother Mercy months
[11:07] since I saw Austin and Lena and finally
[11:09] they get back together and bring their
[11:10] animals along and and they make all the
[11:12] conveniences and all the sacrifices and
[11:15] it would be so long and no doubt we can
[11:17] see how easily they'd fall away with
[11:19] their idol worship they they couldn't
[11:22] afford to go to church they didn't have
[11:23] time they didn't have the luxury like
[11:24] Vehicles we got they didn't have the
[11:26] luxury to go to up to the temple once a
[11:28] week yeah so see if they miss one you
[11:31] know if they if they don't confess their
[11:33] sin you know what might happen well the
[11:35] if you don't confess your sin what
[11:36] happens the sin gets greater and greater
[11:37] and
[11:38] greater and so then and then you know
[11:40] Paul and and isaah not Paul Isaiah and
[11:43] Jeremiah rebuke them and God says you
[11:45] you bring those sacrifices now three
[11:47] times a year but it's a stench in my
[11:48] nose he said I hate your burnt offerings
[11:52] because for all the other months they
[11:53] would reject God and worship idols and
[11:55] they try to come and keep their religion
[11:57] on the feast days and God said said I
[11:59] don't accept that what I accept is a
[12:01] broken and contrite spirit Hallelujah
[12:04] that's the sacrifices of God that God
[12:06] wants to see when we're Broken
[12:08] Hallelujah now and so this uh especially
[12:11] happened again of course from the second
[12:12] temple zable which about uh
[12:15] 55 uh BC and all the way down to the
[12:18] time of the Lord Jesus 500 years there
[12:20] and now it's been going on ever since by
[12:22] the grace of God this weekly Gathering
[12:24] Hallelujah now if you got your Bible 1
[12:26] Timothy 3 now we I read through this
[12:28] earlier uh the bishop here means
[12:31] overseer so I'll look at this again 1
[12:34] Timothy now this has to mean remember
[12:37] this this word Bishop has to mean the
[12:40] Pastor because Paul never mentioned
[12:42] Bishop in Ephesians 4:11 there's only
[12:44] five preaching gifts B Bishop is not a
[12:46] six there's only
[12:48] five right there there can only be one I
[12:51] mean there got to be one of those it's
[12:53] not it's not listed so the bishop the
[12:55] overseer has to be the pastor because
[12:57] which one of those gifts are overseeing
[12:58] of flock
[13:00] of people it has to be the pastor so
[13:02] that that's why you if you study your
[13:03] Bible you'll know the word Pastor bishop
[13:06] and Elder can all mean the same thing
[13:08] brother man lays it out in the church
[13:09] age book but most people haven't read
[13:10] the church age book but you need to you
[13:12] read you need to read the church age
[13:13] book hallelujah it's such a blessing
[13:16] Hallelujah now verse one this is a true
[13:17] saying if a man desire the office of a
[13:19] bishop he desireth the good work now
[13:21] brother R says a man always run from the
[13:22] call but here it says at some point the
[13:24] man has to want the
[13:26] call right people run from God but
[13:29] eventually they got to want to do it so
[13:31] see you got to balance all these things
[13:33] out verse two a bishop then must be
[13:35] blameless the husband of one wife he
[13:37] can't be married twice three times
[13:39] Vigilant sober of good behavior given to
[13:42] hospitality he has to be able to teach
[13:44] so I know if I'm a pastor I must be able
[13:46] to teach and I Do by God's grace now
[13:49] verse three not given to Wine nor
[13:51] Striker nor greedy a filthy ler and I
[13:53] have a video that goes through every one
[13:54] of these definitions I want to get to
[13:56] the main quotes tonight okay so you I've
[13:58] already preached out before years ago I
[14:00] got on video so I'm not going to go
[14:01] through all these uh but you can look it
[14:03] up here and maybe I will maybe Sunday
[14:05] we'll see but patient must be patient
[14:08] not a brawler not
[14:10] Covetous right one that ruleth his own
[14:13] house well having his children in
[14:15] subjection with all gravity for if a man
[14:18] know not how to rule his own house how
[14:19] shall he take care of the Church of God
[14:21] In fact the first thing brother Brook
[14:22] said uh when I told him I might Pastor
[14:24] he said I've always known you'd be a
[14:26] pastor because of how you treat your
[14:27] wife and your kids that's what brother
[14:29] Brooks told me and of course he ordained
[14:31] me to be Pastor here in
[14:33] akan not a novice now I started
[14:35] pastoring in 2006 so I was only saved
[14:38] about six years but brother Brooks saw
[14:40] the maturity in my life I was already
[14:41] mature enough I wasn't easily deceived
[14:43] or swooned over or I didn't have any of
[14:45] these uh uh sinful characteristics in my
[14:49] life so he's recognized me and church I
[14:51] believe my testimony has stood the test
[14:52] of time but it's only because Christ is
[14:55] in me hallelujah it's not my goodness
[14:57] I'm not preaching on me I'm preaching
[14:58] about what the the Bible says a
[14:59] Christian should have and a Christian
[15:01] can only have it because of Christ in us
[15:03] the hope of Glory Hallelujah because
[15:05] Christ gave me and each one of us a
[15:07] portion of his attributes of his
[15:10] character
[15:11] Hallelujah that's right not a novice or
[15:14] a young believer lest being lifted up
[15:16] with pride he shall fall into the
[15:17] condemnation of the devil moreover he
[15:20] must have a good report of them that are
[15:21] without so my job lest he fall into
[15:24] reproach and snare of the
[15:26] devil all right now then it goes into
[15:28] deep I'm also a deacon so these could be
[15:30] some of my all my requirements as well
[15:33] Hallelujah okay so you can see it it's
[15:35] one man he rules the house of God okay
[15:38] now the pastor rules his church like his
[15:41] home and this what I'm get I'm want to
[15:42] get to eventually I don't let my
[15:44] children disrespect me in my home so
[15:47] that's why I'm not going to let anybody
[15:48] disrespect me in this church
[15:51] Hallelujah you can't you can't let it
[15:53] happen if I let it happen in my home
[15:55] things bad things are going to happen in
[15:56] my
[15:57] home brother BR says there's a quote
[15:59] I'll get to brother BR says if you're he
[16:01] said if you're in the church you ought
[16:02] to be 100% with your
[16:04] pastor if not go somewhere else go find
[16:07] a someone you can support 100% we don't
[16:10] need more people we need more character
[16:12] that's it right there I didn't plan to
[16:13] say that but that was good amen because
[16:14] it goes along with brother R's quote
[16:16] amen it's not the amount of the people
[16:18] not the quality it's not the quantity
[16:20] it's the quality
[16:22] Hallelujah that's right and I've never
[16:24] begged anybody to come to this church
[16:26] Hallelujah you just come because you're
[16:27] led by the Holy Ghost
[16:29] Hallelujah that's just way it should
[16:31] always be now Titus
[16:34] 1:5 here uh again now he says uh Bishop
[16:38] uh
[16:40] and Elder now here it's an
[16:45] elder which means a bishop or overseer
[16:47] so which which of those five is
[16:49] overseeing a flock of Believers it have
[16:51] to be the pastor and then if you compare
[16:54] a lot of these requirements are repeated
[16:56] what where we just read in 1 Timothy
[16:58] chapter 3 so look at verse 5 for this
[17:00] cause left I Thee in cre that thou
[17:02] should us set in order the things that
[17:03] are wanting and ordain Elders in every
[17:05] city as I appointed thee now so see here
[17:07] it looks like Paul's telling Titus
[17:08] you've got the Holy Ghost you you pray
[17:10] and fast just like they did in the book
[17:12] of Acts remember before they sent forth
[17:13] Paul and Barnabas they prayed and fasted
[17:15] with prophets and teachers and then the
[17:17] Holy Ghost told them who to go with the
[17:19] Holy Ghost sent them out so in the in
[17:22] these Bible days the book of Acts they
[17:24] would just pray and God would vindicate
[17:25] that one as the pastor that one the
[17:26] pastor that City that one God would just
[17:28] Vindicated by the leadership of those
[17:30] who had the Holy Ghost but not today of
[17:32] course we vote but we believe your holy
[17:34] ghost in you is voting through you
[17:38] Hallelujah if any be blameless the
[17:40] husband of one wife having faithful
[17:42] children not accused of Riot or unruly
[17:44] for a bishop must be blameless so see
[17:46] Elder and Bishop is the same thing
[17:48] Bishop means overseer and a Shepherd
[17:50] oversees
[17:52] sheep as the steward of God not
[17:56] self-willed not soon angry not given to
[17:59] Wine no Striker not given to Filthy luer
[18:02] but a lover of hospitality a lover of
[18:04] Good Men sober just holy temperate
[18:07] holding fast the faithful word as he
[18:09] hath been taught so I was taught by
[18:10] Brother Brooks by Brother Craig uh Boer
[18:13] that he may be able to by sound Doctrine
[18:15] both to exhort and convince the gains
[18:18] Sailors for there are many unruly and
[18:20] vain talkers and deceivers especially
[18:21] they of the circumcision in that day
[18:24] Hallelujah the church said amen all
[18:26] right Hebrews 13:7 and8 you know we
[18:28] always say brother Rams you know his his
[18:30] motto was Hebrews 138 yes it was Jesus
[18:32] Christ the same yesterday today and
[18:34] forever but what verse is before that I
[18:36] pray I I pray somebody tell me what what
[18:39] is the context of that verse the context
[18:42] is men ruling the church who are filled
[18:45] with the Holy
[18:46] Ghost verse seven remember them which
[18:49] have the what someone's got to
[18:52] rule God said could chose one man to
[18:55] rule the local church
[18:59] who have spoken unto you the word of God
[19:02] whose Faith follow considering the end
[19:05] of their
[19:06] conversation so I should be an example
[19:08] you should look at my faith how does my
[19:10] faith work out in my life and you should
[19:12] try to follow that don't follow my
[19:14] mistakes but follow me like Paul said
[19:16] follow me as I follow Christ Hallelujah
[19:19] because everyone has mistakes but follow
[19:21] their overall faith that they have the
[19:24] faith in the word hallelujah and how do
[19:26] you know their faith by their works
[19:29] amen okay and then okay and then now we
[19:32] go to verse eight Jesus Christ is the
[19:35] same yesterday today and forever we
[19:37] don't have time but remember in numbers
[19:39] 27 I'm not mistaken I don't I don't have
[19:41] the verse but Moses is dying and God
[19:43] told Moses go get Joshua and ordain him
[19:46] as a man for the people to see that
[19:49] he'll go before the people lead the
[19:51] people take them out and bring them in
[19:54] God never said a dead man can be the
[19:56] pastor God set up a living man as the
[19:59] pastor and Bram Tabernacle should have
[20:01] said
[20:04] amen now verse 17 same same
[20:08] chapter this is Jesus Christ the same
[20:11] yesterday today and forever he always
[20:13] had one man ruling as far as the local
[20:15] church of course there was always one
[20:17] major prophet right like Moses or Joshua
[20:19] right we know that down through the age
[20:21] verse 17 obey them that have the rule
[20:23] again rule someone has to give the
[20:26] rules and but it's not their rules by
[20:29] their own ideas it's their Rules by the
[20:31] word of
[20:33] God and submit yourselves the trouble is
[20:36] the trouble happens when people won't
[20:37] submit to the rule of the word that's
[20:39] when trouble
[20:40] happens I got a text Sunday about you
[20:42] know uh things as a mess in the church I
[20:45] don't say it's a mess but if there's a
[20:46] mess it's the Bible said it's always
[20:48] caused by Pride that's right right uh
[20:52] the Bible said wherever pride is there's
[20:55] contention so any mess would be someone
[20:58] who's not not giving in uh to the
[21:00] submission of the word and it could be
[21:02] the pastor it could be uh a deacon it
[21:04] could be any anybody but in each case
[21:06] you got to go back and say who's not
[21:08] submitting to the rule of the
[21:10] word that's how you know Hallelujah for
[21:14] what do they do now those that preach
[21:16] verse 17 for they watch over your soul
[21:19] as they that must give an account one
[21:20] day I'll give an account of the souls
[21:22] that were in
[21:23] Aron that they may do it with joy and
[21:25] not with grief so it's one or the other
[21:27] you live such a life that the pastor is
[21:29] joyful about your testimony or you live
[21:31] such a life that it Grieves the
[21:34] pastor is that right is that the word of
[21:38] God and notice the same word rule as in
[21:41] 1 Timothy 3 if he rules his house well
[21:44] then he'll rule the church
[21:46] well
[21:48] Hallelujah for that is unprofitable for
[21:51] you so see there's a lot of people that
[21:52] are going to lose profit on the day of
[21:54] judgment because of how they're
[21:55] misbehaved in the local church to The
[21:57] Men Who rule or the man who ruled in the
[22:00] local church that's what the Bible says
[22:02] it won't it won't be profitable for them
[22:05] if the pastor has Joy about their
[22:06] testimony or grief if Joy they get
[22:08] rewards if grief there's no profit there
[22:11] lose out on
[22:12] rewards right that's the word of God
[22:15] hallelujah this is the laying the
[22:17] groundwork right this is 101 this is the
[22:19] very beginning of of having a home
[22:21] church right this is this is Bible home
[22:24] Church 101 right the very simple things
[22:27] here now remember uh first timoth let's
[22:30] go back to 1 Timothy 5 we read this on
[22:32] Sunday verse
[22:33] 17 let the elders that rule well be
[22:36] counted worthy of double
[22:38] honor not just honor double honor now I
[22:43] know some people go way too far I don't
[22:44] want worship no Pastor no real genuine
[22:47] pastor wants worship but there there's
[22:49] something where where where we can show
[22:51] double honor if you honor somebody but
[22:54] then with with the the the pastors that
[22:55] rule well or the preachers you must give
[22:57] them double honor
[22:59] if they rule well right if they don't
[23:01] rule well bring bring correction to them
[23:03] right talk to them bring correction
[23:06] right like brother man said if I make a
[23:07] mistake he said whether you're a janitor
[23:08] whether you're a deacon he said meet me
[23:10] privately we'll talk about it that's
[23:14] right especially those who labor in the
[23:16] word and in Doctrine so instruction and
[23:19] the Declaration of the word of God so
[23:21] preaching and teaching really that's
[23:22] what that is preaching and teaching
[23:24] preaching is just declaring God's A
[23:25] Healer God hears your prayers God's
[23:26] faithful now but doctrine's different
[23:28] Doctrine tells you how to pray right how
[23:30] to fast how how to do all these things
[23:32] how to understand this right preaching
[23:34] is the seals are open the the seventh
[23:36] Angels come the Bible says what and then
[23:38] the teaching says what do the seals mean
[23:41] right young Brothers we going going
[23:42] through that last Sunday that's what
[23:44] teaching us it tells you what it means
[23:46] Hallelujah gives you
[23:48] instruction Verse 18 for the scripture
[23:50] sayith Thou shalt not muzzle the ax that
[23:53] treadeth out the corn and the laborer is
[23:55] worthy of his reward
[23:58] okay now that's also used in 1
[24:00] Corinthians 9 with uh preachers
[24:02] accepting ties that's that's the that's
[24:04] the scripture so if an ax was uh if Ox
[24:08] was was grinding corn he could he could
[24:09] every now and then stop down and eat
[24:11] some of that corn and God said that's
[24:13] natural he's doing the work he should
[24:14] get a little bit of that he's got to eat
[24:16] right he's got to he's got to do that
[24:18] verse 19 against an elder so the
[24:20] overseer the bishop the pastor receive
[24:23] not an accusation but before two or
[24:26] three Witnesses now brother takes it
[24:28] even further when they came against
[24:30] brother Neville I'll show you the quote
[24:31] in
[24:32] 1957 he said you have to swear by it
[24:35] with an oath swear to God you saw that
[24:39] Pastor do that
[24:41] sin he said I he said I he said you have
[24:43] to say I swear I saw brother Neville
[24:45] drunk now brother was just giving an
[24:46] example brother Neville never got drunk
[24:48] he's saying You must swear he did it and
[24:50] then have proof that he did it just like
[24:52] at the court you can take anybody to
[24:54] court but you ain't going to win unless
[24:55] you got substantial proof real proof
[25:00] right two or three Witnesses now and my
[25:04] wife sent me a good verses we can you
[25:05] know we were talking you know uh God has
[25:07] to put so much Authority and and uh to
[25:10] the pastor and so much protection
[25:12] because the Bible said they're going to
[25:13] endure
[25:14] hardness like Paul says if you're a
[25:16] preacher you have to endure the hardness
[25:19] of the job it's not an easy job and I'm
[25:23] not asking for no one's asking for pity
[25:24] right neither is being a mom an easy job
[25:27] right it's not an easy job nor dad or
[25:29] whatever you know but we all got
[25:31] different responsibilities but God had
[25:33] to give such protection to the pastor
[25:35] because it would be such a difficult
[25:37] thing imagine a a Shepherd taking care
[25:39] of all these sheep and all uh and all
[25:41] the dangers and all the villains he's
[25:43] got to protect right imagine all the
[25:46] real real enemies out there it's not an
[25:48] easy job it's a hard job so he's got to
[25:51] have these protections built in so he
[25:54] does verse 20 them that sin rebuke
[25:58] before all that others may also fear so
[26:01] see sometimes we get common to each
[26:04] other we we lose some of the honor for
[26:06] one another I'm just not talking pastors
[26:08] but one another and so sometimes sins
[26:11] have to be preached publicly to bring us
[26:13] back to Godly fear so we don't become
[26:15] common to each other so remember that
[26:17] Christ is in each one of us and how we
[26:20] treat our brother sister is how we would
[26:22] treat our lord Jesus if he was here
[26:25] brother R says however you're acting now
[26:27] to the pastor or the Ministry is exactly
[26:29] how you would have acted to Noah or
[26:31] Jeremiah or Isaiah or even the Lord
[26:33] Jesus Christ
[26:36] Hallelujah like brother man use that
[26:38] that that quote he'll say well if Jesus
[26:40] was here i' i' I'd do better I'd do this
[26:42] and that brother man said no you
[26:43] wouldn't you do exactly what you're
[26:44] doing right
[26:45] now Jesus said it's better that the Holy
[26:48] Ghost is here that's what Jesus said
[26:51] because then he can be in more than one
[26:53] place at one time
[26:54] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God
[27:00] all right verse 21 I charge thee before
[27:02] God so I got a pastor has a charge a
[27:05] duty before God and the Lord Jesus
[27:07] Christ and the elect Angels even the
[27:09] angels are watching
[27:11] us right because remember we'll judge
[27:13] the fallen angels that are trying to
[27:14] discourage us or tempt us we'll judge
[27:17] them see we have a charge before the and
[27:20] then of course the elector the saved
[27:21] angels that thou observe these things
[27:23] without part preferring one another so I
[27:25] can't say well because I like this
[27:27] sister I'm not going toing out the sin
[27:28] or I like that brother I'm not going to
[27:30] bring out the sin the Bible said do
[27:31] nothing with
[27:33] partiality right without preferring one
[27:36] before another doing nothing by
[27:40] partiality
[27:42] Hallelujah this is home Church 101
[27:45] welcome to
[27:48] class half the class is over I went do
[27:51] the history of this now I I don't I
[27:54] didn't have time to get these quotes but
[27:55] in 1964 they asked brother brandom you
[27:56] know is it okay to miss church to go
[27:58] hunting and brother man said no he said
[27:59] if you act if you possibly have a chance
[28:02] he said get in church and brother man
[28:04] said somebody told me I don't want to be
[28:05] illegalist brother BR said you ought to
[28:07] be a legalist at least at the beginning
[28:08] to come to church now everybody does a
[28:10] great job here by God's grace but I I
[28:13] can pull the quote if you want to look
[28:14] up legalist in 1963 or 64 you'll find it
[28:16] it's either in questions answers on the
[28:17] seal 63 or the four-part questions
[28:19] answers 1964 and two quotes uh people
[28:22] told Brother R brother ROM I I'm just as
[28:24] good of a Christian if I stay at home
[28:25] brother R says twice you cannot be as
[28:27] good of a Christian if you don't come to
[28:29] church he said because this is the table
[28:32] where God's food is fed to us hallelujah
[28:35] it's the shoe bread it's the the bread
[28:36] of God's face
[28:39] Hallelujah so if you miss God's table
[28:41] you miss God's food you won't get have
[28:43] God's spiritual vitamins and
[28:45] nutrition I know about your house but I
[28:47] don't want to miss one meal of my wife
[28:49] boy she can really Cook Brothers if you
[28:51] got a good wife cook you're blessed
[28:54] Hallelujah Glory I know all the sisters
[28:56] cook real good here so Hallelujah you're
[28:58] blessed but think about if you didn't
[29:00] have that meal how'd you feel I'd feel
[29:02] hungry I'd feel starving I'd feel angry
[29:05] right hry there it is see and so we got
[29:08] to stay in the presence of God that's
[29:09] where you get the food of God the
[29:11] strength of God hallelujah the life of
[29:13] God hallelujah I got the quotes if you
[29:15] want them text me I'll be happy to get
[29:16] them I just have time because I want to
[29:18] spend at least I'm already half my I'm
[29:20] right at half my time
[29:22] okay Saints there's 130 quotes where
[29:24] brother BR says post of Duty that means
[29:27] stay at your home Church go to your home
[29:30] church it's more it's almost almost
[29:33] three times as much as third pole quotes
[29:35] but I tell you like this if you if
[29:36] you're a part of the home church if you
[29:38] honor these quotes then you'll
[29:39] experience the third poll quotes
[29:41] speaking the word that's right
[29:43] hallelujah look at this in 1958 in 58
[29:47] brother BR says tomorrow Lord willing if
[29:49] if it falls my lot to speak tomorrow
[29:51] afternoon so he's on a Saturday he says
[29:53] tomorrow afternoon a Sunday afternoon
[29:55] that is not on the healing service but
[29:56] an Evangelistic service and if you and
[29:58] your pastor your congregation can see to
[30:00] come we'd be happy to have you now look
[30:03] at this Sunday we do not ask people to
[30:06] leave their post of Duty unless the
[30:08] church has fully cooperated and you have
[30:10] no services at your church so brother
[30:12] Ram's in Iowa and he says you're going
[30:14] to have church tomorrow on Sunday he
[30:16] said we're not going to have our special
[30:18] meetings in the morning because we don't
[30:19] want to take anybody from their home
[30:23] church right so he would have a service
[30:25] right there in the middle between
[30:26] morning service and evening service when
[30:29] churches used to have evening service
[30:30] and the church said now we're getting
[30:33] back to our Sunday now I told you
[30:35] mothers if you if you're tired you just
[30:36] take a nap and St at home all right you
[30:38] can stream it God knows I've never
[30:40] carried a baby I'm never
[30:42] gonna but I know as you get as you get
[30:45] more experience I'll say like that as
[30:46] you get more experience uh it becomes
[30:47] harder
[30:48] so try to say the right words
[30:51] you by God's grace but look what brother
[30:54] man says we're here as a visitor we
[30:56] don't want to pull anyone from their
[30:58] poster Duty that's why I never tell
[31:00] anybody oh you leave your home Church
[31:01] come to our church I never pull anybody
[31:02] from their post of Duty we're trying to
[31:05] help that church grow and we want every
[31:08] member at his own church now I didn't
[31:10] have the quote here but brother R says I
[31:12] don't even I don't even want your tithes
[31:13] and offerings he said give that to your
[31:15] home Church brother said that I got the
[31:17] quotes he said don't give it to the
[31:19] widow woman give it to your he said give
[31:21] your offerings to the widow woman give
[31:22] your tithe to your brother bam loved the
[31:24] home Church why CU he was a pastor for
[31:26] 17 years in a homech Church Hallelujah
[31:29] all by basically all by himself for many
[31:31] of those
[31:32] years that's why he loved the home
[31:33] church because he was a bible-based
[31:37] prophet and then if you have sickness
[31:39] and you want to be prayed for tomorrow
[31:41] night get permission from your
[31:44] pastor this is called double respect
[31:47] double honor you don't have to ask me
[31:49] permission to anything but if you had
[31:51] double honor you might I'll just leave
[31:54] it at that and some people I never hear
[31:56] from them for months or weeks or what
[31:58] what maybe I maybe it was too long since
[32:01] I preached a 101 so forgive me if that's
[32:03] that' be my
[32:04] fault my fault
[32:06] Lord tell them what you want to do if
[32:08] it's the only night you can get here
[32:10] we'd be glad to have you but first is
[32:12] your duty at your church and tomorrow
[32:15] afternoon everybody I guess has no
[32:16] Services tomorrow afternoon so if you
[32:18] can come out I want to preach tomorrow
[32:20] Lord willing a perverted life and about
[32:21] an hour of your time I suppose I suppose
[32:24] at 2:30 look at that 2:30 2:30 was in
[32:26] between the morning and in the
[32:31] evening now for everything uh everything
[32:35] outside the Bible for everything outside
[32:37] the Bible the church has to have
[32:39] bylaws which are just rules I got the
[32:42] copy if you want a copy I'll print you
[32:43] off a copy if you want a copy it' be
[32:45] easier to send you a PDF but I could
[32:47] I'll print it off too save a little
[32:48] paper but um for every other area that's
[32:52] not specifically in the Bible you have
[32:53] to have bylaws okay brother Ram said and
[32:56] every so often according to the by of
[32:58] our church every year the deacons and
[32:59] trustees automatically fill their time
[33:01] or they they they did one year uh
[33:04] oneyear term so the Deacon was a was a
[33:06] deacon for a whole year and then he had
[33:08] the choice at the end of the year
[33:09] whether he wanted to continue the next
[33:10] year or not okay now uh ours is ours is
[33:13] a little unique but I'm just reading
[33:15] what brother Ram said here now every
[33:16] year the deacons or trustees
[33:17] automatically fill their time if they
[33:19] want to come back all right if they do
[33:21] not want to come back then they can
[33:22] place some in their places and this
[33:24] board has resigned brother Braham said
[33:26] it's the sovereignty of the law of the
[33:28] church by the word of God the bylaws
[33:32] right and the word of God you have your
[33:34] church bylaws that's why we wrote them
[33:35] now we wrote them in 2015 because that's
[33:37] when homosexuality was legalized and it
[33:40] was told to us by lawyers you better put
[33:43] you better get some bylaws and says that
[33:44] you don't have to marry homosexuals or
[33:47] else they can sue you but if you got a
[33:49] bylaw saying you don't have to then
[33:51] you're you're
[33:52] protected and then also put in there I'm
[33:54] glad I put it in there I said I will not
[33:56] marry anybody unless they go through
[33:58] seven rounds of counseling so I've had
[34:01] people come and ask me will you uh will
[34:04] you marry me and then if I say no this
[34:06] then they won't even invite me to the
[34:07] wedding that shows how much they don't
[34:09] even care about me they just want a
[34:11] preacher to marry them a little old
[34:14] nobody preacher no
[34:16] thanks I don't know how your life is
[34:17] going to turn out if I don't counsel
[34:19] with you I don't know what your I don't
[34:20] want my my name attached to that wedding
[34:23] I don't unless I know they got Godly
[34:25] character so thank God we put that in
[34:27] there I'm so glad my
[34:32] goodness he says therefore they just
[34:34] can't say well I think this man would be
[34:35] the right man for this or this or that
[34:37] brother Neville thinks this man would be
[34:38] the right man or the truste board thinks
[34:40] this no it has to be done by the church
[34:42] no one does anything within himself here
[34:43] it's the vote of the church it's a
[34:45] sovereign church now every church is
[34:47] different as we'll see the old set of
[34:49] bylaws was destroyed in the 1937 flood
[34:52] we've recopied those and will'll be hung
[34:53] on the wall over here soon the duties of
[34:55] the trustees deacons treasurers and so
[34:58] forth Pastor Associates and so
[35:00] forth so that's the sovereignty of the
[35:03] local church brother says now I'm
[35:04] getting this this is a very long quote
[35:06] if you want to listen to this and get a
[35:07] good understanding of the church home
[35:08] Church 101 listen to this
[35:11] sermon I believe in the supreme
[35:13] authority of the local assembly Let each
[35:15] church have its own choose its own
[35:17] pastors its deacons whatever it is and
[35:19] that way the man in there has no Bishop
[35:20] over him like denominations right so in
[35:23] denominations if you're a Lutheran
[35:24] Pastor you're at let's say you're in a
[35:26] little town There's a bishop over you
[35:28] that has authority over you but there's
[35:30] nobody authority over me except the Holy
[35:32] Ghost right that's the beauty of the
[35:35] local church and the real Holy Ghost F
[35:37] Church man can't come in here and say I
[35:39] don't like Jesse I'm gonna get rid of
[35:40] him well you got a you got a like to you
[35:42] have a lot to dislike about me I agree
[35:44] but you can't remove me only the church
[35:46] can remove me and that's done by
[35:48] two-thirds vote that's in the
[35:52] bylaws yes he says the Holy Spirit want
[35:56] if the Holy Spirit wants to speak speak
[35:57] some to the church they don't have to
[35:59] ask anybody about whether they could do
[36:00] this or that it's the individual in
[36:02] contact with the Holy Spirit show me by
[36:04] the Bible what's greater than the Bible
[36:06] than a local Elder to a local church I
[36:08] just took you through the Bible who has
[36:10] more Authority in the church than
[36:12] anybody it's the pastor and brother Bram
[36:14] says that show me somebody greater that
[36:16] has more rule more
[36:18] Authority in the local church there's
[36:22] nobody he says that's right yes sir the
[36:24] sovereignty of local church each Church
[36:26] in itself he'll say it again in another
[36:28] way whoops by the way uh yes while I'm
[36:31] speaking somebody around this country is
[36:33] guilty of riding some cards to move
[36:34] brother Neville out of this pit you're
[36:35] going to have to settle that with me he
[36:38] says people speaking against his his
[36:41] Pastor right he said uhhuh uhuh yes
[36:44] indeed now I want you something said
[36:46] something about the Deacon board the
[36:47] Deacon board has not one thing to do
[36:48] with that the pastor no sir the
[36:49] congregation in full has all the
[36:52] authority a deacon board is just a
[36:54] policeman here in the church just to
[36:55] keep order and so forth when it comes to
[36:57] the rules the whole church has the say
[36:59] so and our say so is in the bylaws
[37:02] that's what everybody voted in here back
[37:03] in 2015 and it has not been amended yet
[37:07] right the church is built upon the
[37:09] sovereignty of the local church
[37:10] therefore I have nothing to say in
[37:12] moving this pastor or poting putting one
[37:14] in even brother brandham couldn't remove
[37:15] brother brother Neville from brandham
[37:17] Tabernacle it's named after him why
[37:20] because of the bylaws the way the Holy
[37:23] Ghost LED them to set up the church
[37:25] structure a prophet cannot remove a
[37:27] Pastor the church has to remove the
[37:31] pastor I own the property brother said
[37:33] it's given to the church you all are the
[37:35] church you people are the one who
[37:36] control you're the church yourself and
[37:37] the church the Holy Church of God is the
[37:39] sovereignty of the holy spirit in that
[37:41] church and the only thing I do is own
[37:43] the property give it over to the church
[37:44] give it for a church it's a taxfree see
[37:46] he got he wrote off his taxes right he's
[37:48] giving on his taxes and the church
[37:50] elects their own pastors I've have
[37:51] nothing to do with it the only way this
[37:53] pastor could ever leave would be the
[37:54] pastor decide himself to go or the
[37:56] majority of the votes of the church
[37:57] would have to say change the pastor
[37:58] that's the only way so you're stuck with
[38:00] me but guess what I'm stuck with you
[38:03] too now I say that in a joke okay I'm
[38:05] glad I'm stuck with you Hallelujah no
[38:08] Deacon board can do it the Deacon board
[38:10] only keeps order and things in the
[38:12] church and I'm pastor and I'm Deacon
[38:15] board because we don't have brothers
[38:17] that meet the qualifications right but
[38:19] if there's any complaint against any
[38:20] member if that member has a complaint
[38:22] against one another or something wrong
[38:24] you're supposed to go to that brother
[38:25] yourself and talk to him you and him
[38:26] alone
[38:28] now remember suay I asked you to do
[38:30] something for me I hope somebody's done
[38:31] it by God's
[38:33] grace if they won't receive it then the
[38:35] next thing takes place you take one of
[38:36] the deacons or somebody go with you to
[38:38] that brother then if he won't receive
[38:39] you then you come tell it to the church
[38:42] then if the church then if he won't
[38:43] receive the church then the Bible said
[38:45] let them be as a heathen a Publican
[38:46] that's right and any person that knows a
[38:49] guilty person and you don't go and talk
[38:51] to them then you're part I'm sorry and
[38:54] then you're the part of the church is
[38:55] going to answer for that sin that's
[38:59] right if you see somebody in sin and you
[39:02] don't go to that person you're guilty
[39:03] for
[39:06] that
[39:08] right that's what that's what is you're
[39:10] you're we're a
[39:11] body if you had if you had a disease uh
[39:14] if you had an infection what kind of
[39:16] person would you be uh if you wouldn't
[39:18] take your right hand and and put that
[39:19] ointment on that infection what kind of
[39:21] person would you be you'd be an insane
[39:22] person you'd be hurting yourself you'd
[39:25] be ignoring your own body your own
[39:26] health that's what happens here if we
[39:28] don't take care of sin in our church we
[39:30] become an infected church so do do the
[39:34] part of the body help out your body
[39:35] Hallelujah right keep sin out of the
[39:38] church you must do it remember the
[39:41] pastor is going to either say Joy with
[39:42] this person or grief with this
[39:45] person persons right he says person any
[39:47] persons
[39:49] anybody and if anybody has to complain
[39:52] against a deacon or against a deacon or
[39:53] some of the church it takes three people
[39:56] he said come tell the past if there's a
[39:57] grievance against a deacon if there's a
[39:59] grievance against a deacon the Deacon
[40:00] isn't a just man a perfect man he must
[40:02] hold that office office
[40:04] blameless okay uh and then he talks
[40:07] about voting a deacon out now I'm going
[40:08] to move on therefore no one person has
[40:10] nothing to do with this it's the
[40:12] majority of the people yes sir if 20
[40:14] votes for him and 21 votes against him
[40:15] he goes or vice versa now that's
[40:17] determined by the the bylaws ours is
[40:19] more than
[40:21] 51% it's 66% 2third because we had a
[40:24] small Church
[40:27] see that's the sovereignty of the local
[40:28] church then each one of the members has
[40:30] to say so anything goes wrong then they
[40:32] can come right around the only thing
[40:34] that they have to do is to be before God
[40:36] that there absolutely see that nothing
[40:38] hinders the moving of the
[40:40] church and if if someone is sitting in
[40:42] the church and it's hurting the
[40:44] atmosphere then it's your and my
[40:46] responsibility to make sure that that
[40:47] doesn't hinder us
[40:51] anymore but now but the full everybody
[40:54] say full and say complete ready complete
[40:57] authority of the church is
[41:00] the pastor because that's what the
[41:03] bishop is that's what the Elder
[41:06] is read that in the Bible see if we just
[41:08] read it see if that's not Bible
[41:10] order that's exactly right there's no
[41:12] one above the Elder I have nothing to do
[41:14] with brother Neville does here in 1957
[41:16] he has nothing the prophet has nothing
[41:18] to do with the local
[41:20] Pastor that's up to you and brother
[41:22] Neville if brother Neville wanted to
[41:23] preach Jehovah Witness Doctrine that's
[41:24] up to you and him see if he wanted to
[41:26] preach anything he wanted to that's
[41:27] between you and him that's all if the
[41:30] congregation votes for him in there to
[41:31] preach that that's all right that's up
[41:32] to
[41:33] him the only thing I do is just owning
[41:36] the property and if something another
[41:37] comes by it's like the moving the pastor
[41:39] they try to move the pastor out and they
[41:41] went to take a vote on that you couldn't
[41:42] ask a deacon to do that you come to me
[41:44] to ask that it come down and say if you
[41:46] want to move the pastor tell me why what
[41:48] has he done yes we called him drunk now
[41:50] here's what I was talking about earlier
[41:51] or we call him doing this or that have
[41:52] you got three Witnesses of it yes we
[41:55] have then Witnesses must first be
[41:58] tried so get all the details and make
[42:00] sure their story lines up with the other
[42:02] person try them ask them questions go to
[42:06] every detail if it's against a
[42:08] pastor or Deacon he says Deacon don't
[42:12] receive an accusation against an elder
[42:15] lest it by two or three witness and let
[42:17] them first be proved against an elder
[42:19] then you have to swear to you have to
[42:20] swear to God and church we don't want to
[42:23] lie to the Holy
[42:25] Ghost and prove it that you s
[42:29] it
[42:31] Hallelujah and then if you did then that
[42:33] sin is rebuked openly and it's wrong
[42:35] then say congregation do you want to
[42:36] change your
[42:38] pastor and if the congregation votes
[42:40] forgive him let's let let him go on yet
[42:42] that's the way it has to stand see that
[42:43] isn't that fair enough the way to run a
[42:45] church he say isn't that
[42:46] fair see that's what the Bible said we
[42:48] have no Bishops and overseers and Boards
[42:50] he's talking about denominational
[42:51] Bishops and overseers that moves this
[42:54] pastor in that that's what we see in
[42:55] denominations my wife and I they just
[42:57] move pastors all over wherever they want
[42:59] whatever the bishop says but that's not
[43:01] the Holy Ghost way to do
[43:04] it there's nobody got Authority here but
[43:06] the Holy Ghost that's right he does the
[43:08] moveing we take him as the majority of
[43:09] the people the way the people
[43:11] go and then if one side wants to do this
[43:14] the other wants to do that the then and
[43:16] the side wins now look at this the
[43:18] losing
[43:21] side what do they do about it they
[43:24] should join right in with the rest of
[43:26] them and say we were wrong then we'll go
[43:28] right on because the Holy Ghost has made
[43:30] the choice that's right now that's a
[43:32] real that would be a real Humble Church
[43:34] that would do that but most people can't
[43:36] give up their
[43:39] opinion right I shouldn't say most I'm
[43:41] sorry some people I'll would say most
[43:43] denominational churches I should say
[43:44] that they can't give up their own
[43:46] personal opinions and and
[43:48] ideas right because they got their own
[43:50] convictions but brother said if you were
[43:52] really right with God you'd go there
[43:54] because it's the Holy Ghost with the
[43:56] majority of the people in the
[43:57] Church
[44:01] Hallelujah he said like Democrats and
[44:03] Republicans oh boy as long as we stand
[44:05] as a democracy As Americans we're not a
[44:06] democracy we're Republic if the
[44:08] Democrats is in the Republicans should
[44:10] push right on with them Republicans in
[44:11] the Democrat push on see that's just
[44:13] exactly what makes us a nation whatever
[44:15] we break that we break our democracy
[44:16] that's right de Democrats say I ain't
[44:18] got nothing to do nothing Republicans
[44:19] was in then we fall I'm a Kentucky
[44:21] together we stand divided we fall now if
[44:24] there's anything wrong in the church
[44:25] that you ever know of some individual or
[44:27] some person or anything you are Duty
[44:29] bound and will answer before God if you
[44:31] don't clear that thing out you the
[44:34] church that's why I told you on Sunday
[44:37] you need to reach
[44:38] out everybody know what I'm talking
[44:41] about if not you're guilty of
[44:45] it
[44:49] Hallelujah you got to clear it out I've
[44:52] got to clear it
[44:53] out now remember it's not on my
[44:55] shoulders it's on yours it couldn't
[44:57] could be on it couldn't even be on a
[44:58] prophet's
[44:59] shoulders it had to be on the local
[45:01] Church's
[45:03] shoulders and anything wrong in the
[45:05] church God will make you answer for it
[45:08] that's right that's the way he runs his
[45:10] church that's the way it is in the Bible
[45:11] That's the order of the Bible remember
[45:12] he gives the example of Joshua the
[45:14] hidden sins right caus people to die
[45:17] brother says for us it'll be people
[45:18] won't get their prayers answered they
[45:20] won't get healed right they won't get
[45:22] blessings from God because there's sin
[45:23] that's discouraging the the church
[45:25] there's there's leaven amongst us
[45:28] and it hinders our faith and God can't
[45:30] move the way he wants to
[45:32] move he said that's the order of the
[45:34] Bible That's the sovereignty of the
[45:35] local church and the pastors ahead
[45:37] that's right amen well I can say Amen to
[45:39] that too
[45:40] Hallelujah now remember our bylaws were
[45:42] approved 10 years ago they never been
[45:44] updated because we never really had
[45:47] to by the grace of God and I'm like I
[45:50] said I'm very glad they're there I'm
[45:51] very glad we did
[45:52] that uh it's kind of protected me and
[45:55] protected us of course as a church
[45:57] now I just want to uh this is I'm going
[45:59] to give you quotes from our bylaws now
[46:01] look at Even in our bylaws we base these
[46:03] upon brandom Tabernacle any director now
[46:06] a director is a the pastor of the
[46:09] president is is for the legal the legal
[46:11] uh legal definitions the pastor is the
[46:13] president deacons
[46:16] trustees any director so any Deacon
[46:18] trustee can be removed by the president
[46:21] the pastor this is in our bylaws if his
[46:23] judgment would see it to the be the best
[46:25] interest and benefit of the corporation
[46:27] so in other words I can remove any other
[46:29] officer anytime I
[46:31] want because I'm the
[46:34] pastor right anything for any reason I
[46:36] want because I'm supposed to be led by
[46:38] the Holy
[46:40] Ghost only the church can remove me
[46:43] right by which is okay it's okay both
[46:45] ways it's okay we agree to it it's okay
[46:47] both ways right so the pastor has that
[46:51] Authority right just just like it should
[46:53] be just like in my home I should remove
[46:55] anyone trying to if if anybody tries to
[46:57] squat in my home I should be able to
[46:59] leave remove them right out of my house
[47:01] and get the trash out of my
[47:03] house CU it's my
[47:05] house I rule that house and so we so as
[47:09] the pastor rules the Church of
[47:11] God
[47:12] hallelujah I wouldn't let any other man
[47:14] come in and start eating from my
[47:16] fridge sleeping in my bed drive my car
[47:20] say no
[47:21] sir I guess what time to lay it throw it
[47:24] down now by God's grace my first fight
[47:28] and now look this is the only time now
[47:30] for our church this is more appropriate
[47:32] to our church but the the live streamers
[47:34] might get a a a help out of this for
[47:36] song for song leaders Sunday school
[47:38] teachers custodians and musicians
[47:41] they're not voted on they're assigned by
[47:43] the
[47:44] pastor now one time I did a voting when
[47:46] we had Brother Andy raber here John
[47:48] Graham brother amen myself because I
[47:49] wanted to see who the people thought was
[47:51] the most anointed or got them in the
[47:53] spirit right remember Brother Andy won
[47:55] that vote with no no no no wonder he's
[47:59] gifted but in our church the pastor
[48:03] assigns all these and they got to meet
[48:05] all the other requirements like pay ties
[48:08] like attend church Faithfully be
[48:09] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:11] Christ married one
[48:13] time right now for our for our situation
[48:17] there's nothing in the bylaws about song
[48:20] service
[48:21] nothing the only thing is that I
[48:24] assigned the song the song leading
[48:26] that's my responsibility and I've got
[48:28] the full Authority in the
[48:30] congregation hallelujah it's not voted
[48:33] on by nope it's assigned by the pastor
[48:35] that's how we agreed on it and that's
[48:37] how it's going to stay as long as I'm
[48:38] here
[48:40] hallelujah Glory why because if not the
[48:43] devil can get
[48:44] in that's why we wrote it like that all
[48:47] those 10 years
[48:49] ago so and I like I said I'll give you a
[48:52] copy you can get it electronically and
[48:53] then do a word search search song and
[48:55] singing there's only one time it's in
[48:57] the entire
[48:58] bylaws song leaders I assign them the
[49:02] pastor assigns them
[49:05] Hallelujah now where do we get our our
[49:08] our song leader order it was from
[49:09] Brother bram's tapes remember he talked
[49:12] about Joshua chapter 6 when Israel
[49:14] marched around
[49:15] Jericho right you had H uh the word the
[49:18] word was last right and you had singing
[49:20] before that so brother said singing goes
[49:22] first then the word so we've just based
[49:25] it upon that right but that's not even
[49:27] in our our bylaws that's not even in it
[49:30] and you don't see that in the New
[49:32] Testament right now we see in the Old
[49:35] Testament we see enter into his gates
[49:37] with praise and thanksgiving right so we
[49:39] can see how you bring praise first but
[49:42] there's no other details right right and
[49:46] I'm open I'm open somebody show me any
[49:49] other song service requirements in the
[49:51] New Testament there's none so this is an
[49:55] area of Liberty written
[49:57] in the bylaws that it's up to the
[49:59] leadership of the Holy Ghost in the
[50:01] pastor Hallelujah everybody see
[50:05] that I'm open to correction but I
[50:07] already know I've searched the Bible
[50:08] read the Bible many times I should say
[50:10] many read enough times to know it's
[50:12] there's no song leading and song uh
[50:15] service requirements in the New
[50:18] Testament and now just remember this too
[50:21] a member is terminated from the assembly
[50:24] if they shall continually cause issue
[50:26] this is this was written 10 years ago
[50:28] within the assembly deemed intentionally
[50:29] if it's intentionally
[50:32] done by the president the pastor and the
[50:34] Deacon which I'm
[50:36] both reason for dismissal is fully
[50:38] documented in 1 Corinthians 5 and the
[50:40] appropriate actions uh Matthew 18:15
[50:42] through
[50:43] 17 misconduct includes fornication
[50:46] idolatry railing that's evil words
[50:48] against people false accusations against
[50:50] people extortion unruly not keeping the
[50:54] rule of the
[50:55] church being Covetous sexually immoral
[50:58] false Doctrine and dividing people
[51:01] against
[51:02] others that's grounds to be terminated
[51:05] from the
[51:06] church right but you follow Matthew 18
[51:08] which which we we've done this dismissal
[51:11] shall be in accordance to Matthew 18
[51:14] okay it goes through all the the the
[51:15] four steps
[51:17] Y and if if repentance is refused there
[51:21] no longer seem to be a member of the
[51:23] assembly after that fourth and final
[51:25] step no longer and they can be
[51:27] terminated from the church Gathering
[51:29] that's the bylaws that's the rules that
[51:31] we wrote up by the Holy Ghost 10 years
[51:33] ago how many think we should follow the
[51:36] rules Hallelujah that's why we wrote
[51:38] them you got to have
[51:40] rules right and somebody's got a rule by
[51:43] the leadership of the Holy
[51:45] Ghost
[51:48] Hallelujah now brother Jose shared with
[51:51] he was he and I were talking one time
[51:52] recently he said brother Jesse said you
[51:54] know I've always he said I've always
[51:56] liked how you lead songs at the end he
[51:57] said because that's how brother brandom
[51:59] did it and I was like that's
[52:03] right I forgot about
[52:06] that when brother Brandon was at his
[52:08] home Church there's 34 quotes where
[52:11] brother brandom is at the end he's done
[52:13] singing he's preached he sings all the
[52:15] songs he says something like this he's
[52:16] singing till we meet till we meet till
[52:20] we meet at Jesus feet God be with you
[52:23] till we meet again finally got the key
[52:25] there now said dad you're off the key I
[52:27] know I know I got a headache
[52:30] tonight but says let's bow our heads now
[52:33] while brother nephl Neville dismisses us
[52:35] in a word of prayer this happened many
[52:38] times probably 30 probably 30 of those
[52:41] 34 maybe maybe more when brother R's at
[52:44] the home church he preaches he sings all
[52:46] the songs and he says Pastor come on up
[52:48] and close us in a word of prayer the
[52:51] prophet and that and everybody was okay
[52:53] with that because it's the sovereignty
[52:55] the everybody can every church has its
[52:57] own Sovereign
[52:59] desires how they want to lead song
[53:02] service but I want you to see that
[53:03] brother Jose brother Jose said maybe
[53:06] some people aren't listening to the
[53:07] tapes so they wouldn't catch that and I
[53:09] said that's good brother they don't
[53:10] listen to brother brandham so they don't
[53:12] know brother BR ends the services at his
[53:13] home Church by being the song leader
[53:17] too and the church
[53:20] said been too long since some of us
[53:22] listened to brother bradam at his home
[53:24] church now at his home Church
[53:27] so again this shows the sovereignty of
[53:29] the
[53:30] church now in most message churches yes
[53:33] after the pastor's done he gets his
[53:34] Bible goes off and then the song leader
[53:36] comes up that's fine they're allowed to
[53:37] do that that's the liberty of your local
[53:39] church do whatever you feel led to
[53:41] do right and be happy with it just thank
[53:44] God for it but the main thing is to file
[53:48] the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[53:50] Hallelujah and that's what I believe
[53:52] I've done by the grace of God for 18
[53:55] years I keep reminding that because it
[53:56] gives me reminder about the years boy
[53:59] they go so fast man it's almost it's
[54:01] almost uh spring break time already it's
[54:03] almost summer time coming up
[54:07] here now here's what I also want to say
[54:09] too if someone is distracting US during
[54:12] a
[54:14] service then the Deacon has to remove
[54:17] that person from a service if someone's
[54:19] distracting in an evil manner then that
[54:22] person needs to be removed
[54:26] now this is when brother Ram got a trap
[54:28] I'm not going to read all this but
[54:28] remember he was trapped uh the holy
[54:30] spirit said Satan set a trap for you he
[54:32] said this this 25-year-old couple came
[54:34] in and the man while he's preaching they
[54:35] sit on the front row the man would just
[54:37] just reach over on his girlfriend and
[54:39] start kissing her brother R's like
[54:40] please don't do that please don't do
[54:41] that please don't do that and finally
[54:44] the holy spirit said say whatever you
[54:46] want he said I forgive you for that I
[54:48] don't know what happened after that
[54:49] because but the quote ends he doesn't
[54:51] say if like did the deacons take him out
[54:53] he said the deacons wouldn't take him
[54:54] out but it was God allowing him to be
[54:56] tested to see what he would do with his
[54:58] spoken word and he passed the test he
[55:01] said father forgive them see and I said
[55:04] young man don't do that you're you're
[55:06] attracting the attention while I'm
[55:07] preaching now preachers aren't selfish
[55:09] wanting the attention but we're trying
[55:11] to get your attention on the word of God
[55:13] because the word of God will set you
[55:14] free Hallelujah the word of God Will
[55:16] Supply your need for the for the current
[55:18] season you're in hallelujah amen so
[55:21] anything that distracts attention from
[55:23] the preaching or songs needs to be
[55:25] removed
[55:28] and he just laugh right out out at me
[55:30] look at the disrespect where's the
[55:31] double
[55:32] honor oh oh there it is there's the Trap
[55:35] right there I said don't do that sir no
[55:37] please don't do that while I'm
[55:41] preaching now here same one yeah he said
[55:43] I forgive your act I'm not going to read
[55:44] all that because it's too small I it's
[55:46] not necessary I just want you to see if
[55:48] something's distracting brother B will
[55:49] look down he'll stop the service and say
[55:50] stop doing that that's distracting
[55:52] please he'll say it a number of times
[55:55] and then brother BR said deacons need to
[55:57] lead out disorderly people from a
[56:00] service now that' be me if someone's
[56:03] disorderly openly disorderly and
[56:05] dishonoring and disrespectful the
[56:07] deacons got to remove that person from
[56:08] the
[56:10] service one time we had it when I first
[56:12] was a pastor and I failed it I remember
[56:14] I failed
[56:15] that remember that I'll just tell it
[56:17] brother Joe Adams was preaching over at
[56:19] the first church and Mr Bell's dad was
[56:23] there and brother ad brother Joe was
[56:25] preaching and Mr Bell
[56:26] uh shouted something and I was so afraid
[56:29] remember that hun and I was the Deacon
[56:31] and I didn't remove him and eventually
[56:32] the man calmed down but that's one time
[56:34] I did fail I was too afraid of
[56:36] Confrontation but not anymore by the
[56:38] grace of God I learned my lesson I
[56:40] failed enough I've had enough
[56:41] experiences where now now we can deal
[56:44] with it now the man cooled down and you
[56:45] know Joe ended up preaching a wonderful
[56:47] message but it's one time I feel like I
[56:48] wasn't quite prepared for it that devil
[56:50] to manifest right there during the
[56:52] service that was on uh I don't remember
[56:54] mow Drive
[56:58] if any unbeliever would happen to be
[57:00] here be disorderly now unbeliever or
[57:02] believer or
[57:05] believer a kindhearted person would go
[57:07] to them such as an usher or Deacon and
[57:10] would ask them that they would ask to be
[57:12] kept reverent or be reverent while the
[57:14] service is in
[57:15] order then if he keeps going on brother
[57:17] B says then the person should would
[57:19] should be led out to one side to one of
[57:21] the back rooms somewhere and be talked
[57:24] to and dealt with kindly he's talking
[57:25] about when gifts are operating people
[57:26] speaking in tongues prophesying waiting
[57:29] on the Lord Prayer if anybody's
[57:31] distracting from any of these things of
[57:33] course preaching as well that person
[57:35] needs to be escorted out
[57:38] Hallelujah and that's what the our our
[57:41] our bylaws say that too deacons have to
[57:43] remove anyone who's irreverent or
[57:45] disorderly and purposely causing
[57:47] confusion or disorder in the service
[57:48] they'll be removed I've never had to do
[57:51] it I should have did it once I missed it
[57:52] but if it happens again I'll do it by
[57:54] God's grace because now I'm studying on
[57:55] it preaching on it by the grace of
[57:58] God brother man said the Deacon's word
[58:00] is Law and Order to tell someone to
[58:02] leave now in 1963 the deacons were kind
[58:05] of fed up at Brenham Tabernacle because
[58:07] they were losing control people W people
[58:09] weren't respecting them they said is
[58:11] there any better way to keep ordering
[58:12] the church that to remind people with a
[58:14] repeat from the deacons now
[58:17] occasionally he says now I think the
[58:19] pastor he said or play this tape let
[58:20] this stand for witness deacons are
[58:22] policemen and their word is Law and
[58:25] Order so if I as a deacon ask someone to
[58:28] leave if they don't they're
[58:29] disrespecting the Deacon and I'm G to
[58:31] have to use physical Force now church
[58:33] just an hour and a half up the road a
[58:36] few years ago there was a church problem
[58:39] and one of the guys wrote out a
[58:41] pamphlet and he said the Pastor I'm not
[58:44] going to name the pastor I'll tell you
[58:45] after service if you want to know and he
[58:47] stood uh first he was in the church
[58:49] passing out pamphlets that this pastor
[58:50] is a false Pro false Pastor the deacons
[58:53] had to physically move him out and then
[58:56] he stopped coming but then one day he
[58:57] showed up right outside right outside
[58:59] the front door passing out the tracks
[59:00] again and they the deacons had to stand
[59:02] there and keep him from getting in he
[59:04] would yell there this is just an hour
[59:05] and a half up the road message message
[59:07] church so I say like this we've had it
[59:09] easy compared to some
[59:11] churches we're just coming through our
[59:13] training Seasons I think here by God's
[59:16] grace but preachers have to do all the
[59:18] time people will get such an evil spirit
[59:21] on them they'll start just publicly
[59:22] trying to disrespect the the service
[59:26] or stand outside and pass out things and
[59:28] well now I'd be passing out text or
[59:29] something like
[59:31] that right but people have to do that
[59:35] there's one there was even a messaged
[59:36] man not long ago was stalking a messaged
[59:39] girl and this pastor had to call the
[59:42] cops to get a restraining order on them
[59:44] and they prayed they fasted they did all
[59:46] these things sometimes the law has to
[59:53] intervene he says the the deacons have
[59:57] the authority from the church and even
[59:58] from the laws of the nation to make that
[1:00:00] house of God the right place so if I had
[1:00:02] to call the cops on somebody being
[1:00:04] disrespectful i' do it but first I'd use
[1:00:07] phys physical Force that's what I do
[1:00:09] first because there any anyone
[1:00:11] disrespectful or
[1:00:12] dishonorable publicly doing it to
[1:00:15] dishonor and show disrespect they need
[1:00:17] to be removed from the service because
[1:00:18] it's hindering the service we're not
[1:00:20] here for disrespect we're here to honor
[1:00:22] the Lord Jesus
[1:00:23] Christ we're not here to disagree all
[1:00:26] those meetings go out there Jesus said
[1:00:28] go one go alone then take two or three
[1:00:30] if they don't tell it to the church and
[1:00:32] then the church goes to tell the person
[1:00:33] all those arguments go out there there's
[1:00:36] my hour I got it
[1:00:39] closer and anyone contrary to a deacon
[1:00:41] like that is subject to now he talks
[1:00:43] about there might be federal crimes I
[1:00:44] don't know I didn't look that up I
[1:00:45] should call the police
[1:00:47] officers if you tell them and they don't
[1:00:49] do it or something like that somebody
[1:00:50] with disorderly conduct he just don't
[1:00:52] know what he's getting into he's he's
[1:00:53] subjecting himself allotting himself to
[1:00:55] all kinds of findes in anything okay
[1:00:58] well that's perfect I think yep that's
[1:00:59] my let's stand to our feet and I got a
[1:01:00] couple more things to say God bless the
[1:01:02] live streamers here hallelujah
