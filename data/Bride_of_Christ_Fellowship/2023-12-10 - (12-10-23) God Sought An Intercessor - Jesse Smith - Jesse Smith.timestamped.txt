[0:00] just thought on my heart for a few weeks
[0:02] here it's kind of like I thought on
[0:04] prayer I thought I studying last night
[0:08] this morning yesterday I was kind of
[0:11] drawn to this thought so I like to at
[0:13] Ezekiel 22:30 I mentioned the scripture
[0:15] a few times you know I'd like to preach
[0:18] on God saw an intercessor God was
[0:21] seeking an intercessor God was seeking
[0:23] someone to
[0:25] pray so I can of be to preach on prayer
[0:28] this morning by God's Gra how many feel
[0:30] led to pray this morning praise God this
[0:32] is the House of Prayer Hallelujah you
[0:35] know we're Kings and Priests unto God
[0:37] labored on that lot believe that's God's
[0:40] desire for
[0:43] us eel
[0:58] 22
[1:01] can let's read that ready one two three
[1:05] and i s for a man among them that should
[1:08] make up the Hedge and stand in the gap
[1:12] before me for the land that I should not
[1:15] destroy it but I found amen that's have
[1:18] a word of prayer if you have need on
[1:20] your heart make it know to God here
[1:21] today Father God we come into your
[1:23] presence again we thank you Lord God for
[1:25] this moment of worship for this moment
[1:27] Lord God that's all we have is this
[1:29] moment right now Lord we're not
[1:30] guaranteed tomorrow all we have is the
[1:33] present and it has a a two-fold meeting
[1:36] lord it's also a gift this present time
[1:38] is a gift Lord God may we make the most
[1:41] of it Lord God may we draw nigh to you
[1:43] Lord God as you are certainly drawing
[1:45] nigh unto us Lord you are seeking
[1:47] someone you're seeking a people a bride
[1:49] a group of Believers that will do your
[1:52] will Lord God and we're convinced of
[1:53] that Lord by the scripture Lord I've
[1:55] just felt strangely to go this way so I
[1:57] just pray God that you'll Guide Me Lord
[1:59] may just yield to your Holy Spirit and
[2:01] father God May the needs of your people
[2:03] be met here Lord God lord we've lifted
[2:05] up many requests to you for healing for
[2:08] uh for for deliverance Lord God and I
[2:10] pray you'll minister to each and every
[2:12] need Lord God those near those far Lord
[2:14] God those close to the church those
[2:16] outside the church around the world Lord
[2:18] God I pray you Minister Lord and you
[2:21] will meet the needs of your people God I
[2:22] ask it and Lord help me your humble
[2:24] servant help us here all to receive from
[2:26] your word today in Jesus Christ's name
[2:29] Saint said amen amen God bless you as
[2:31] you're being
[2:38] seated you know Sunday or Wednesday
[2:41] rather we looked at U the book of Acts
[2:43] and we ended with uh stepen and I was
[2:46] just impressed again you know by the
[2:48] Holy Spirit I felt at the life of
[2:52] stepen especially that last statement he
[2:55] made before he died he said lay it not
[2:58] to their charge and I just thought it
[3:00] was so uh fitting you know that in his
[3:03] last breath he's praying for God to have
[3:06] mercy on his
[3:08] persecutors and what a what a testimony
[3:11] of the spirit of Christ in someone he's
[3:13] not asking for Revenge he's not asking
[3:15] for his enemies to be destroyed he's
[3:18] asking for his enemies to be forgiven
[3:21] and that's the true Spirit of Christ and
[3:23] so I just based upon that I kind of felt
[3:25] led to go this way I've had numerous
[3:27] thoughts try to bring some uh scriptures
[3:30] here on prayer today uh we're in the
[3:34] we'd say the most deceptive time there
[3:36] ever was brother random said you know
[3:37] the fourth Church age was the darkest
[3:39] time uh this is certainly a dark time uh
[3:43] as we said with Ohio you know Ohio is
[3:45] now going to allow you know these up to
[3:47] birth abortions and these uh gender
[3:49] change surgeries such wickedness such
[3:51] mutilation and uh such murder but in the
[3:55] midst of that we're to be the people
[3:57] that are
[3:58] righteous Moses God could only find one
[4:01] man I'm sorry Noah God could only find
[4:02] one man who was a preacher of
[4:04] righteousness and that him him and his
[4:07] church were the only ones that were
[4:08] saved now we know there's more than that
[4:09] in this day but brother uh he Likens
[4:12] that unto our day where Jesus said There
[4:14] Will Be Few that find it right very few
[4:17] that'll be hot and on fire for Christ
[4:19] how many want to be on fire for Christ
[4:21] amen that's what gets the fire going is
[4:23] prayer I was just going through many
[4:25] quotes this week about brother Brandon
[4:27] and he just kept saying you know get
[4:29] alone with God God spend time with God
[4:31] In Prayer be refreshed in God's presence
[4:33] and I think that's why we're here right
[4:35] I think that's why we come here to be
[4:37] with God Amen to shut out things from
[4:39] the world and to spend time talking it
[4:42] over with God speaking to God this is
[4:45] the house of prayer and so I've just
[4:47] felt compelled to go this way um so we
[4:50] look at this here like I said God sought
[4:52] out an intercessor I I've referenced
[4:55] this numerous times but I as I was
[4:57] studying I found different quotes from
[4:58] brother brandom and different
[5:00] uh uh comments from these uh preachers
[5:03] and we'll we'll kind of go through these
[5:04] here by God's grace I think I'll start
[5:06] with a few uh familiar scriptures John
[5:09] 4:23 uh but the hour cometh Jesus says
[5:11] and now is when the true worshippers
[5:14] shall worship the father in spirit and
[5:16] in truth amen for the father seeketh
[5:19] such to worship him so God is uh God is
[5:23] today he's seeking true worshippers
[5:26] think about that his spirit is going
[5:27] over all these churches all these mega
[5:29] churches is and he's looking for true
[5:31] worshippers but Jesus said few will find
[5:33] that narrow road it's a it's a very
[5:36] narrow path not many people walk on it
[5:39] that's why we have hard time
[5:40] fellowshipping with even people that
[5:41] call themselves Christians because we're
[5:43] some of us uh we're not walking the same
[5:46] path I'm talking about some of your
[5:47] friends you walk a more narrow life than
[5:51] they do your life is more focused than
[5:54] theirs they can walk all these broad
[5:56] paths and they can do all these broad
[5:57] things and worldly things but the the
[6:00] the Bible says plainly very few will
[6:02] walk on this narrow road and I'm glad to
[6:05] be one of those that walk on the narrow
[6:07] road Hallelujah I want to stay on the
[6:08] narrow road by God's grace I want to
[6:10] just look at my life for 2024 I I want
[6:13] to look back for 2023 make sure were all
[6:16] my paths ordained of the Lord did I walk
[6:18] on all the right paths praise God and I
[6:21] want to fix them if there's anything
[6:22] wrong I want to get off the wrong path I
[6:24] want to get on the right path praise God
[6:27] I want to walk the narrow road heading
[6:29] into the the next year by God's grace
[6:31] and I'll be preaching some sermons I was
[6:32] Shar with brother amen yesterday Lord
[6:34] willing the next few weeks I'll be
[6:35] preaching just some uh sermons how
[6:38] brother Brandon would approach a new
[6:39] year and how he he said I had hundreds
[6:42] of invitations imagine that for us it'
[6:44] be hundreds of texts we have hundreds of
[6:47] texts come here come visit us come
[6:48] preach us how in the world uh could you
[6:52] could he meet all those some would say
[6:54] come for a week come for two weeks come
[6:55] for a month it's there's not enough days
[6:57] in the
[6:58] year so that's the thought I want to
[7:00] kind of labor on how do you deal with
[7:02] the overloaded to-do
[7:05] list right in other words brother R had
[7:07] overload loaded to do this he could
[7:09] never accomplish that so how did he deal
[7:12] with that so I want to show you later on
[7:14] by God's grace because it's just been a
[7:16] help to
[7:17] me but God today is he's looking for
[7:19] people in our church that will be true
[7:23] worshippers that will worship in the
[7:25] spirit and in truth praise God and then
[7:28] uh Second Chronicles 169 I love this
[7:30] this kind of gives us the uh the analogy
[7:33] or the
[7:34] metaphor uh God's eyes and I believe you
[7:36] know uh the holy spirit is here I
[7:39] believe you know the holy spirit is also
[7:40] here by the angels that are here amen
[7:43] the Bible says the eyes of the Lord run
[7:46] to and fro throughout the whole earth to
[7:48] show himself strong in behalf of those
[7:52] whose heart is perfect toward him praise
[7:55] God so God's eyes are here God's God's
[7:58] peing in here and who's truly worshiping
[8:00] who can I use for my glory who who is
[8:02] set apart and set aside so I can use
[8:05] them today amen I just think that's
[8:08] beautiful God was God's eyes came into
[8:10] your your home this morning and he's
[8:12] looking for true worshippers Hallelujah
[8:14] God came peeking in the church today
[8:16] he's looking for real worshippers amen
[8:18] hallelujah praise God Amen I'm glad he
[8:20] can find them here hallelujah amen if
[8:22] you need somebody to pray or need
[8:23] somebody to give or need somebody to
[8:25] intercede or whatever he may need of
[8:28] he's his eyes are here and he's watching
[8:30] and we just want to be yielded vessels
[8:31] that he can use today praise God Amen as
[8:34] we said on Wednesday not someone that
[8:36] will resist the Holy Spirit but someone
[8:38] that will yield and obey the Holy Spirit
[8:41] we don't want to resist uh you know
[8:44] giving into God's way we want to open up
[8:46] ourselves and we want to be obedient to
[8:48] God's way Hallelujah so we get this
[8:51] illustration that God's eyes are
[8:53] constantly watching us right Hallelujah
[8:57] and so uh we have this Foundation here
[8:59] now getting back to Ezekiel
[9:02] 22:30 I got a couple notes I want to
[9:04] make sure I put up
[9:06] here I want to start with this what
[9:08] scoffield said so if you put up Ezekiel
[9:11] 22:30 there
[9:13] hun thank you before I read this again
[9:17] you know uh here's what scoffield said
[9:18] about Ezekiel just to kind of give you
[9:20] some uh context Ezekiel was carried away
[9:23] to Babylon between the first and final
[9:25] deportation of Judah remember uh
[9:28] Nebuchadnezzar are ordered for all the
[9:30] Jews to be taken out except the very
[9:32] poorest because he said we got to have
[9:33] some people there that will you know
[9:35] tend to the crops and the The Vines and
[9:37] The Vineyards and everything like that
[9:39] uh so he left the porse of the people
[9:41] there and then he set somebody in charge
[9:43] but other than that he took out everyone
[9:45] everyone was taken out of the land
[9:46] because they mistreated the land instead
[9:48] of filling the land with righteousness
[9:50] they corrupted the land with
[9:52] idolatry so God said if you do that I'm
[9:55] taking you out of land because God
[9:57] doesn't play around right but God God
[9:59] was merciful God gave them so much time
[10:02] God gave them Prophet after Prophet God
[10:04] gave them sermon after sermon Hallelujah
[10:07] God gave them year after year king after
[10:09] King Hallelujah to try to bring them to
[10:12] repentance praise God and God was
[10:15] longsuffering but uh Ezekiel was like
[10:18] Daniel and the Apostle John he
[10:20] prophesied out of the
[10:22] land and his prophecy like theirs
[10:24] follows the method of symbols and
[10:28] visions unlike the pre-exilic prophets
[10:32] whose Ministry was primarily to either
[10:34] Judah or the 10 tribe Kingdom Ezekiel is
[10:36] the voice of Jehovah to the whole house
[10:39] of
[10:40] Israel so ezekiel's letters would be
[10:42] taken to and Scattered they'd be copied
[10:44] and they'd be scattered to all and sent
[10:46] to all the Israelites who were scattered
[10:48] and departed oh my and although there's
[10:51] judgment in there there's also Promises
[10:53] of God's mercy in there amen hallelujah
[10:55] praise God there's also promises where
[10:57] God said although I scattered you I'll
[10:59] bring you back to your land Hallelujah
[11:01] am I love it in the midst of God's
[11:03] correction in in the midst when God will
[11:05] might rebuke us he always offers hope in
[11:07] the midst of it Hallelujah he always
[11:09] offers uh opportunity for restoration
[11:12] Hallelujah because God loves his
[11:14] children Hallelujah
[11:16] am the purpose of ezekiel's ministry was
[11:19] to keep the generation born in
[11:22] Exile uh the national sins which had
[11:26] brought Israel so low so ezekiel's
[11:29] Ministry was to remind them here's your
[11:30] sins the this is what you've done and
[11:33] you need to repent of these sins
[11:36] Hallelujah he was also meant to sustain
[11:39] the faith of the
[11:41] Exiles uh by promising National
[11:44] restoration hallelujah we're still
[11:46] seeing it today we're still seeing God
[11:48] bringing back all these Jews back to
[11:50] their Homeland praise God that's exactly
[11:53] right God's word is is is sure God's
[11:56] word cannot fail Hallelujah
[12:00] amen and he promised them this National
[12:02] Glory
[12:04] restored one of the main uh phrases from
[12:07] this book is the hand of the Lord was
[12:09] upon meist church just remember you know
[12:14] whenever you're trying your best to obey
[12:16] the word of God God's spirit is on you
[12:19] amen right because the devil uh won't
[12:22] move you the devil won't try to anoint
[12:24] us or deceive us uh into
[12:27] obedience and as long as we're resisting
[12:30] sin that's God anointing us to resist
[12:33] sin amen hallelujah we may not feel it
[12:36] may not feel like maybe last Sunday
[12:37] morning or Wednesday night as far as
[12:39] like such a powerful presence but God is
[12:41] anointing you and leading you when
[12:43] you're trying to overcome your your sin
[12:45] your sin test right amen as you battle
[12:47] throughout the week that's God's
[12:48] anointing on you and here Ezekiel is the
[12:51] voice of God to them reminding them of
[12:54] their sins but promising them I'll bring
[12:55] you back hallelujah amen and so God's
[12:58] hand hand was upon him and church you
[13:01] know I'll just say like this too God's
[13:04] hand was on Ezekiel to tell them their
[13:06] sins God's hand is on you when you're
[13:08] telling other people their sins yeah so
[13:12] when you're sharing the gospel with
[13:14] people God's hand is upon you yesterday
[13:17] I I met with a young man he's 23 almost
[13:20] 24 I just felt compelled to this man and
[13:24] uh the girls were there and we had a
[13:26] good
[13:27] time uh
[13:29] but I was just telling I was I was
[13:30] telling him you know I wish when I was
[13:32] 23 somebody would have sat down and told
[13:34] me these things I I said I want to sit
[13:36] down and tell you these things I telling
[13:37] him about he's not married yet but all
[13:38] these scriptures about marriage he's
[13:40] like I believe you brother I believe you
[13:42] Mr calls me Mr Smith you don't call me
[13:44] brother I used to be his teacher many
[13:46] years
[13:47] ago but uh he was so thankful you know
[13:50] he's like wow these are the words of God
[13:51] he said I want to serve God and just an
[13:54] encouragement there was another stranger
[13:55] that was there and he looked at the
[13:57] children nature and virtue needed all
[13:58] the little children there he looked at
[14:00] all of them he said he said wow they are
[14:01] such well behaved children I said that's
[14:03] because they hear the word of God I said
[14:05] can I offer you a card you want my books
[14:07] he said I'll think about it so I got to
[14:09] give out three cards this week to people
[14:11] so I was really encouraged about that by
[14:13] God's grace you never know where your
[14:15] your your testimony is going to end up
[14:17] brother Raam said SE as many seeds he
[14:19] said as you can and he said on that day
[14:21] on the day of judgment we'll see where
[14:23] all of our efforts have gone to
[14:26] amen but you know when was warning him I
[14:29] was warning him in some places don't go
[14:31] this route go this
[14:33] route and so see CH that's how I know
[14:35] the spirit of God is upon me right
[14:37] that's how I know God's hand is on you
[14:39] when you're trying to point people to
[14:41] obedience to come out of the sins or uh
[14:44] to not make this mistake that's God's
[14:47] love that was God's love on Ezekiel for
[14:50] Israel come out of your sin don't go
[14:52] that route go this route praise God
[14:54] trust in God Amen so God's spirit is
[14:57] upon us we may not not feel it all the
[14:59] time like God's hand is on us for
[15:01] miracles and or maybe raising the dead
[15:03] or something but if we're trying to get
[15:05] people to obey the word of God if we're
[15:07] trying to teach people in righteousness
[15:09] then surely God's hand is upon us that's
[15:12] what it was for
[15:15] Ezekiel Hallelujah so that's a little
[15:17] background on Ezekiel I remember Simon
[15:19] years ago preached on uh the open book
[15:21] and that's what Ezekiel had Ezekiel had
[15:23] the saw the Revelation the early
[15:25] chapters of Ezekiel of the book that was
[15:27] open I want to look at a few thoughts
[15:30] here this is from John Gil I was uh
[15:32] reading this man he's a preacher from
[15:33] the 1800s of
[15:35] course and he said the Bible says I
[15:38] sought A man among them and uh the
[15:40] scripture or I'm sorry the history says
[15:43] God was seeking A man among the princes
[15:45] and the priests and the prophets and the
[15:47] people of the land who acted the part as
[15:50] as uh the faithful he said otherwise no
[15:54] doubt there were good people in the land
[15:55] as Jeremiah baroo and others but not
[15:58] among these so he gives a point there
[16:01] when Ezekiel wrote this there were good
[16:03] people in the Land There was Jeremiah
[16:06] there was baroo remember baroo he's the
[16:07] one that wrote out Jeremiah's letters he
[16:09] gave to the king the king threw him away
[16:11] Jeremiah said write them again
[16:12] hallelujah amen the word of God will not
[16:15] return boy
[16:17] hallelujah amen so they were good people
[16:20] there and God wasn't saying there was
[16:22] not anybody there but God wanted other
[16:24] people that were there God wanted not
[16:27] just the prophet Jeremiah or baroo the
[16:30] faithful scribe God wanted other people
[16:32] so outside of the righteous God was
[16:34] looking is there anybody
[16:35] else that will intercede for me is there
[16:38] anyone else that will will will pray for
[16:41] those who are are in sin Hallelujah he
[16:45] said is there anyone that would make up
[16:46] the
[16:48] Hedge now hedge of course means kind of
[16:51] to put up a wall again so so uh this
[16:55] this wall this hedge had been broken
[16:57] down by the transgress RS of the people
[17:00] so there was no more law there was no
[17:02] more Justice doesn't that sound like
[17:03] America cities like de Democratic cities
[17:05] there's no more law and Justice a lot of
[17:08] them you know in New York and different
[17:09] uh Chicago uh San Francisco different
[17:12] places they can do some awful crimes
[17:14] usually they be locked up but they just
[17:16] let them they just book them and they
[17:17] let them back out those places will be
[17:19] under the wrath of God because that's
[17:22] what happened in the
[17:24] Bible he said where's a man that will
[17:26] make up the Hedge where's a man that
[17:29] will restrain people from sinning that
[17:31] will reform them or set a good example
[17:34] where's a man whose works are good
[17:38] works where's a man that will stand in
[17:41] the gap before me for the land that I
[17:44] should not destroy
[17:46] it where's a man who that will repair
[17:49] the breach restore good pth Hallelujah
[17:53] who will intercede like Abraham
[17:55] interceded for
[17:57] Sodom right and we'll get some examples
[17:59] of some intercors intercessors rather
[18:03] today and I thought you know that
[18:04] scripture came to me Hebrews 13:8 Jesus
[18:06] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[18:08] forever amen if God was seeking a man
[18:12] then who would uh men in women I'll say
[18:15] that that would pray for the people to
[18:17] overcome their sins if God was seeking
[18:19] in that day then God seeking that today
[18:21] hallelujah amen God seeking people
[18:26] today now I want to go through some
[18:28] script
[18:28] uh if you she set that okay thank no
[18:31] problem if you got your bible Jeremiah
[18:33] 5:1 this is a repeated
[18:35] story uh a repeated uh
[18:40] problem in the days of Ezekiel and
[18:42] Jeremiah there was less and less people
[18:45] that wanted the government and the
[18:48] people to live holy and God was find
[18:51] having trouble finding people that would
[18:54] pray for the sins of the the
[18:57] community that's why I've always
[18:59] encourage you to do
[19:01] that Jeremiah 5 verse1 run ye to and fro
[19:05] through the streets of Jerusalem and see
[19:07] now and know now notice he doesn't say
[19:09] walk he says run what does run mean
[19:12] urgency amen because we don't know when
[19:14] it's our last day on
[19:17] Earth right so he says run run to and
[19:21] fro on the streets of Jerusalem and and
[19:23] know and seek and seek in the broad
[19:25] places thereof if you can find them if
[19:27] there be any that execute judgment and
[19:30] seeks the truth and will pardon I wonder
[19:33] this morning how many people read their
[19:35] Bible one of my children said how come
[19:37] there's nobody on the road today and I
[19:39] thought it's a shame there they should
[19:40] be going to
[19:41] church right but I wonder how many
[19:44] people read their Bible this morning
[19:45] who's seeking
[19:47] truth who read their Bible last night
[19:50] you know who who's seeking who wants
[19:52] more truth
[19:53] amen that that's that's the situation
[19:56] that that Jeremiah and Ezekiel uh they
[19:58] they found Israel they've got the word
[20:01] of God they've got a house built for for
[20:03] Jehovah but who's actually seeking more
[20:05] of Jehovah right God told Jeremiah run
[20:09] run through the
[20:10] city go to the broad places try to find
[20:14] somebody that's seeking truth and I'll
[20:17] pardon them I'll forgive them hallelujah
[20:19] oh what a what a blessing amen amen what
[20:21] a blessing for us we know if we're
[20:23] seeking God God will pardon us
[20:25] hallelujah amen in other words whatever
[20:28] you seeking life that's what you'll get
[20:30] that's why we keep seeking the Holy
[20:31] Spirit we keep seeking forgiveness we
[20:33] keep seeking Miracles cuz God said if
[20:35] you seek me you shall find me hallelujah
[20:38] amen what a blessing
[20:40] amen now look at verse uh now look this
[20:43] is the kind of people they met just like
[20:45] today Jeremiah 5:2 and though they say
[20:48] the Lord lives surely they swear
[20:50] falsely how many people say well I love
[20:53] Jesus I'm a Christian but they're lying
[20:54] right through their teeth right same
[20:56] thing
[20:57] today
[21:00] verse three oh Lord are not Thine Eyes
[21:02] Upon the truth and church what is the
[21:05] message the message is the true Bible
[21:07] restoration the message a message church
[21:09] is a church that TR preaches the truth
[21:12] about the
[21:13] Bible Hallelujah right so we are so
[21:17] God's eyes are on us
[21:20] amen thou Hast stricken them but they
[21:23] have not grieved thou has consumed them
[21:25] but they have refused to receive
[21:26] correction they have made the their face
[21:28] is harder than a rock they refused to
[21:31] return now again let's let's do the
[21:33] opposite of that let's always return to
[21:35] God when we make mistakes amen let's
[21:38] make our our faces lovely toward the
[21:41] lord as I've told you you know I
[21:43] preached to people over the years they
[21:44] can you can tell they're mad at me you
[21:47] know what whatever I'm preaching
[21:48] whatever offended them but let's have a
[21:51] let's have a countenance you know Cain
[21:52] the Bible said Cain left the presence of
[21:54] God with an angry countenance let's not
[21:56] have an angry countenance let's have a
[21:57] count full of mercy and love
[22:00] amen so Israel didn't have that in in
[22:03] this time and they couldn't receive
[22:06] correction the sermons didn't change
[22:09] anything no matter what the preacher
[22:10] preached on it wouldn't change their
[22:12] lives God help us to have lives that are
[22:14] lined up to the word of God hallelujah
[22:16] amen accept correction right if God
[22:18] brings it if God CHS you to do something
[22:20] let's do it praise God said let's be up
[22:23] and at it one of those quotes I'm going
[22:25] to read is brother Brandon was talking
[22:26] about this young man he said he was a
[22:29] nice man a handsome man but he just
[22:31] wandered from church to church from I
[22:33] think it was down in Alabama he just
[22:35] went from place to place and brother R
[22:37] would ask him you know what what are you
[22:38] doing he said nothing where you plan to
[22:41] go next nowhere and brother R said what
[22:43] a shame he's just wandering you know
[22:45] their life is wandering there's no
[22:47] Direction brother Ram said be up and at
[22:50] it he said find a goal for Christ do
[22:53] something for Christ hallelujah amen
[22:55] have a goal in life and there's that
[22:56] quote brother says I just found this
[22:58] week he said the Christian ought to be
[22:59] the most ambitious person in the whole
[23:02] world Amen am ambitious means you're
[23:05] eager to do something amen like if I
[23:08] said uh who's ambitious to go get some
[23:10] pizza after service well there'd be a
[23:11] lot of ambitious people right I'd be one
[23:13] of
[23:14] them right you or if you're really
[23:17] hungry and I'll say who's ambitious
[23:19] getting line for some pizza get lined
[23:20] for some Chipotle well we e all night
[23:23] right up right cuz we're hungry well
[23:24] that's what brother says spiritually we
[23:27] should be ambitious to win
[23:30] souls so that's what I feel like a a
[23:32] refreshing here uh like a rededication
[23:35] for this 2024 like I want to give out my
[23:38] cards I want to invite more people to
[23:39] church I want to help people along the
[23:41] way I want to meet up with people and
[23:43] try to tell them and warn them about the
[23:45] word of God I I want to be more focused
[23:47] on other people praise God and not
[23:50] myself
[23:53] hallelujah
[23:56] amen
[23:58] so we can see the condition here this
[24:01] was already being built up God said God
[24:03] told Jeremiah you go run try to find
[24:05] someone who's believe in the
[24:06] truth and then we know by Ezekiel that
[24:10] God could not find any outside of
[24:12] Jeremiah and baroo outside of the
[24:14] regular Believers that were living
[24:17] righteously so he's seeking that today
[24:20] you've heard me say this before but if
[24:22] if if if if you put all of Ohio in
[24:25] darkness right but you just put a light
[24:27] from heaven on the on the churches that
[24:29] really preach the truth how many lights
[24:31] would there be over Ohio right there
[24:34] would imagine there wouldn't be too many
[24:36] but we'd have a little light shining in
[24:37] acon Praise Goden because we're against
[24:40] murder right we're against uh adulteries
[24:42] and fornications and and homosexuality
[24:45] we're against what God is against in
[24:48] other words we're for what God is for
[24:50] hallelujah amen and God's light is
[24:52] shining on us and so so the emphasis
[24:55] should be for us is to to intercede for
[24:59] others to try to get more people to walk
[25:02] upon this narrow way hallelujah amen
[25:05] amen he said I'm seeking I'm seeking for
[25:08] a man that will stand in the Gap
[25:11] Hallelujah in other words there's people
[25:13] think about this m mercy so sad there's
[25:17] people that God's over here and they're
[25:19] way over there if they're far from God
[25:21] and God wants somebody to come and stand
[25:23] and say let's come together here now
[25:26] think about that in your families right
[25:27] we have some family members that are
[25:28] this far that far away and then there's
[25:32] and God wants somebody to stand in
[25:33] between and let's come together let's
[25:35] try to bring healing to the
[25:37] situation
[25:39] right so think of this the world you
[25:41] know your friends our family members our
[25:43] co-workers our neighbors there's a gap
[25:45] between them and God and God wants
[25:47] somebody to stand in the Gap and try to
[25:49] bring them close to God hallelujah amen
[25:53] amen I'll tell you like this I just want
[25:55] to be open to doing whatever God wants
[25:56] me to do if that means going across the
[25:59] street to my neighbors who voted yes for
[26:01] this awful abortion and maybe giving
[26:03] them some Christmas cookies then I want
[26:05] to do that you see what I mean I haven't
[26:07] planned that but I'm just thinking of it
[26:08] now how can I stand in the gap between a
[26:12] person who's far from God how can I do
[26:15] it God has to leave me praise God but I
[26:18] got to be willing to go Hallelujah like
[26:20] Jeremiah I gotta be willing to run and
[26:22] find is there anyone that wants a doe
[26:24] truth is there anyone that wants to
[26:26] serve the Lord hallelujah amen
[26:29] amen
[26:30] amen like I said I gave out three of my
[26:33] cards you know this week I only got
[26:34] turned down one time that's pretty good
[26:36] I got 75% success rate praise
[26:39] God I went to Giant eag and the first
[26:41] guy I saw he said I don't want that okay
[26:43] God bless you sir but then when I
[26:45] checked out this lady she oh I like that
[26:47] I'll pass that on to somebody else I was
[26:48] thinking well why don't you read
[26:50] it but at least she took it by God's
[26:53] grace but I want to be more intentional
[26:56] because you never know when you might be
[26:58] that person like a Ben Gandy praise God
[27:01] like a Benjamin Gandy you might never
[27:02] never know when you might be that person
[27:03] Hallelujah to tell somebody about the
[27:06] message hallelujah
[27:08] amen glory you never know so we want to
[27:12] be uh we want to be focus on the Lord we
[27:16] want to have uh we want to always have
[27:18] the Lord set before us praise God we
[27:20] want to pray without ceasing God use
[27:23] these next few moments Lord use my
[27:25] afternoon use this service for your
[27:27] Glory
[27:28] hallelujah
[27:30] amen now so God s just like God God was
[27:35] telling Jeremiah go find someone but
[27:37] there's other verses here God told
[27:39] Ezekiel I'm looking for a man and he
[27:42] couldn't find any think of that he
[27:43] couldn't find anybody who was praying
[27:45] about the transgender situation think
[27:48] about that for our day he couldn't find
[27:50] anybody that was praying to end
[27:53] abortion you couldn't find anybody
[27:55] praying for the wars to end
[27:58] for God to have mercy on Israel thank
[28:00] God he can find it here praise God he
[28:03] couldn't find
[28:04] that and so that grieved God's
[28:07] heart now I want to look at some of the
[28:10] men and women who stood in the Gap so go
[28:13] to numbers 25 you're probably familiar
[28:15] with this but just kind of a
[28:17] rehearsal I just found there's such
[28:19] strength in rehearsing things that I
[28:21] forgotten
[28:23] about like I shared that brother Samuel
[28:25] shared a quote with me after service and
[28:27] here reminded me that brother brandom
[28:28] had a 9-day sinus
[28:30] infection anybody ever had a nay sinus
[28:33] infection his he had a fever all nine
[28:35] days and brother R couldn't preach the
[28:37] meetings he got so
[28:39] discouraged he went to his wife and said
[28:41] am I even called to preach you know what
[28:44] mea
[28:45] said brother R said she kind of rebuked
[28:48] me she said you need to keep quiet don't
[28:50] say things like that said I appreciate a
[28:53] woman a wife like
[28:55] that and so I put that on YouTube you
[28:57] and got over a th views in one week
[29:00] brother Ram's wife rebuked him don't
[29:02] talk like that of course you're called
[29:03] of God
[29:05] hallelujah now sisters I'm not telling
[29:07] you go home to rebuke your husbands or
[29:09] vice versa hubbies don't rebuke your
[29:11] wife unless you be a l of the
[29:14] Lord right but that was just I forgotten
[29:17] about that I was like oh that's right
[29:19] and then you know God brother man went
[29:20] and prayed about it Jesus showed him a
[29:22] vision well you haven't accepted the
[29:23] third poll and then as soon as he got a
[29:25] vision he was instantly healed the sign
[29:27] of infection n Day science
[29:30] infection and of course of course we're
[29:33] called of God but with such an
[29:34] encouragement in our moments of sickness
[29:36] and our moments of Doubt God's going to
[29:38] put somebody there to to straighten us
[29:39] out praise God Amen to encourage us of
[29:42] course you're called of God of course
[29:44] you're a Christian
[29:46] Hallelujah you're just walking through
[29:48] the valley of the shadow of death but
[29:49] I'm with you hallelujah amen and I'm
[29:52] walking through it praise God Amen I'll
[29:54] get through this eventually praise God
[29:56] Amen but that was such an encouragement
[29:58] to me I thought wow I forgot about that
[30:01] even a man like brother Brandon we've
[30:02] seen thousands of millions of people
[30:03] saved and healed even he doubt it am I
[30:05] even called to preach because of a
[30:09] failure of one
[30:10] meeting
[30:12] Hallelujah we know God doesn't fail
[30:14] hallelujah amen amen uh numbers
[30:19] 257 now those of you know this this is
[30:22] of course um this is the Bale
[30:25] poror and S this is when balum invited
[30:29] all these Israelites over and there was
[30:31] uh fornication he taught them how to
[30:33] commit fornication so not get married
[30:35] but have sexual sin God killed 24,000 of
[30:39] them now this types out to the third the
[30:42] third out of the four steps of the four
[30:44] horse riders I preached a few weeks ago
[30:46] the doctrine of
[30:48] balum so balam's Doctrine was we're all
[30:50] the same we can all worship together I
[30:53] think we all know there's a difference
[30:54] between a message service and a Baptist
[30:56] service right amen CU we've been to a
[30:59] couple this year haven't we thank God
[31:02] for it right thank God there's something
[31:04] being done but we can all see the
[31:05] difference praise God right where you
[31:08] know in the Baptist Church you can't
[31:09] really step on people's toes well by
[31:11] God's grace uh God can step on any of
[31:13] our toes Hallelujah if there's something
[31:16] wrong with my life clean me out Lord God
[31:18] hallelujah correct me I'm your child I
[31:21] want to be correct I don't want to be
[31:22] wrong
[31:24] Hallelujah there's a difference amen
[31:27] of course there's a difference but
[31:29] fineas he sees these these these men
[31:32] these Jewish men taking the moabit women
[31:34] and laying with them they're not even
[31:36] married and the Bible said in verse
[31:45] seven okay I'm actually reading verse
[31:49] six yeah Moses said verse five MOS said
[31:51] slay every one of them that were joined
[31:52] to
[31:56] Bor
[31:58] all right and then they're weeping yeah
[32:00] verse six they're weeping about what's
[32:01] happened here verse 7 and when Phineas
[32:03] the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the
[32:04] priest saw it rose up from among the
[32:07] congregation he took a javelin in his
[32:08] hand and went after the man of Israel
[32:10] into the tent and thrust both of them
[32:12] through the man of Israel and the woman
[32:14] threw her belly so the plague was
[32:15] stained from the children of Israel and
[32:17] those that died in the plague were 20
[32:19] and 4,000 and the Lord spake unto Moses
[32:22] saying Phineas now here's what God's
[32:24] opinion is of Phineas who did this very
[32:27] violent act with the spear now we don't
[32:29] do that naturally but that's what we
[32:30] should do spiritually amen I'll say that
[32:33] again amen any sin that we have in our
[32:36] lives we should get a spiritual spear
[32:38] it's called the word of God
[32:40] hallelujah and try to end that sin as
[32:42] soon as we cared in our lives
[32:46] Hallelujah that's what God wants us to
[32:47] do not let it lay not get into
[32:51] addictions and habits for weeks and
[32:53] months and then years and then decades
[32:55] not go that route but stop the plague
[32:58] stop the sin hallelujah
[33:01] amen so what does God do God said Finas
[33:04] in verse 11 the son of Aaron the priest
[33:06] had turned my wrath away from the
[33:08] children of Israel while he was zealous
[33:09] for my sake among them that I consumed
[33:12] not the children of Israel in my
[33:14] jealousy wherefore say behold I give
[33:16] unto him my Covenant of Peace REM
[33:18] reminds me of that song whose side are
[33:20] you standing on standing on the Lord's
[33:23] Side that's another verse we'll get to
[33:25] later by God's grace
[33:27] but look at verse
[33:31] 13 He says and he shall have it and his
[33:34] seed after him even the Covenant of an
[33:35] everlasting priesthood because he was
[33:37] zealous for his God and made an
[33:38] atonement for the children of
[33:41] Israel so here's a man standing in the
[33:44] Gap right all these people are sinning
[33:47] and this this sin is spreading like a
[33:49] disease it's just spreading well and
[33:51] remember this Israelite man he was a
[33:53] prince he was a high he was a popular uh
[33:55] message believer
[33:57] and if he could do this sin well then
[33:59] everybody could do this sin and Phineas
[34:01] raised up and said no it's got to stop
[34:04] it's got to stop here and I'm just the
[34:05] one to stop it praise God Amen so he
[34:09] took the spear thrust them both through
[34:11] and God said I'm making this man a
[34:13] priest forever praise God amen amen amen
[34:17] because he stood in the Gap he stopped
[34:19] the sin he stopped the influence amen he
[34:23] knew that we should be living right and
[34:24] so he made an effort to do it right
[34:26] Hallelujah
[34:27] amen
[34:29] amen remember God in ezekiel's time he
[34:32] couldn't find a man that would do that
[34:35] right so it just goes to show very few
[34:37] people will stand up and tell the
[34:39] truth God help us to always tell the
[34:41] truth
[34:44] amen I like what brother Samuel said he
[34:46] said brother Justin got a lot of energy
[34:47] he's got a lot of zeal I said may God
[34:50] help me to always have that I don't want
[34:52] my I know sometimes my Zeal is up my
[34:55] wisdom but I want to I want to I want to
[34:57] be on the side where I'm zealous for you
[34:59] know why that because of this you know
[35:01] why I want people to call me zealous
[35:03] because of that praise
[35:05] God I don't mind being the strict Church
[35:07] I'd rather be the strict Church than the
[35:09] loose
[35:10] Church hallelujah amen
[35:15] glory let them drive past our church I
[35:17] just keep waving you keep going there
[35:19] Hallelujah you just go where you're led
[35:21] by the Holy Spirit but for me and my
[35:23] house we'll serve the Lord hallelujah we
[35:26] won't let them make up in we won't let
[35:27] the high heels in we won't let the tight
[35:29] dresses in or brothers we won't let the
[35:31] shorts
[35:32] in
[35:34] Hallelujah go wherever you want to go
[35:36] Hallelujah but let's have Zeal for the
[35:39] ways of God Amen Moses in uh Exodus 3210
[35:43] if you go
[35:45] there Exodus
[35:50] 32:10 I just had a thought there Exodus
[35:55] 32:10
[36:00] Exodus
[36:02] 32:10 I'm looking up a quote here get to
[36:07] there it is okay got it thank you now of
[36:10] course you know the story this is right
[36:11] after the uh the Ten Commandments were
[36:13] revealed Moses went back up I'm sorry
[36:16] Moses went up he received the Ten
[36:18] Commandments written on Stone and he
[36:20] comes down and God said God told him the
[36:23] people have already turned aside I think
[36:25] he was up there 40 days right and the
[36:27] people had already turned back to
[36:30] idolatry and he and Aaron and Joshua
[36:32] were coming down and joshu was like I
[36:34] hear the noise of war and Moses said
[36:36] it's actually the singing of the people
[36:39] yeah and the Bible said uh they sat down
[36:42] to eat and Rose up to play now that play
[36:44] is the flirting word because it's the
[36:47] same word that Isaac played with Rebecca
[36:49] he was flirting with her although
[36:50] they're already married see brother
[36:52] sometimes it's okay to flirt with your
[36:53] wife there
[36:54] so other words just be romantic that's
[36:56] what I mean but when Moses come down
[37:00] here they were being flirtatious and
[37:02] they weren't married and they had I had
[37:04] a golden calf set up and they're dancing
[37:07] and singing to to the wrong
[37:10] music right right and then later because
[37:13] this Aaron he strips some of their
[37:15] clothes and he breaks that calf right
[37:18] grounds the calf into pieces makes him
[37:20] drink it and then dumps it in the the
[37:22] water MH right and then Aaron puts the
[37:25] blame on them but was to blame right he
[37:28] should not let it happen MH right and to
[37:31] me as I was reading this you know let's
[37:33] read uh verse
[37:35] 10 it reminded me of that Vision brother
[37:38] brand sorry brother brandom had of the
[37:40] rock and roll in America so this is the
[37:43] closest Bible story I can find to the
[37:45] vision brother random had of America
[37:47] dancing the rock and
[37:50] roll Exodus 32 sorry I wasn't in the
[37:54] wrong
[37:55] chapter verse
[38:00] 10 let's go to verse uh yeah verse
[38:05] 10 he says now therefore let me alone
[38:08] that my wrath May Wax Hot against them
[38:11] and that I may consume them and I'll
[38:12] make of thee a great nation look at that
[38:14] God says I'll destroy all them but I'll
[38:16] start with you
[38:18] Moses what an offer right what an offer
[38:21] kind to remind you of Abraham right
[38:22] that's what God did with
[38:24] Abraham so I'll consume all idolators
[38:27] but I'll start a brand new church with
[38:29] you Moses and Moses besought the Lord
[38:31] his God and said Lord why do thy wrath
[38:34] Wax Hot against thy people which thou
[38:36] has brought forth out of the land of
[38:37] Egypt with great power and with a mighty
[38:39] hand wherefore should the Egyptians
[38:41] speak and say for Mischief did he bring
[38:43] them out to slay them in the mountains
[38:44] and to consume them from the face of the
[38:46] Earth turn from thy Fierce wrath and
[38:49] repent of this evil against thy people
[38:51] now of course God was not doing evil
[38:54] right he's saying repent of this uh
[38:57] wrath that you're going to I'm sorry
[38:58] change your mind on this wrath that
[39:00] you're going to do right God never has
[39:02] to repent God never has to say I'm sorry
[39:04] God never say I made a mistake but this
[39:06] word repent just means to turn and go a
[39:08] different direction right God is never
[39:11] sorry for anything he does the church
[39:13] said
[39:14] amen and as we know what brother talks
[39:17] about this I'll mention that just a
[39:18] moment remember Abraham Isaac and Israel
[39:20] thy servants to whom thou swearest by th
[39:22] own self and sest unto them I'll
[39:24] multiply your seed as the stars of
[39:25] Heaven and all this land that I spoken
[39:27] of will I give unto your seed and they
[39:29] shall inherit it forever and the Lord
[39:31] repented of the evil which he thought to
[39:33] do unto his people and then he pours out
[39:36] the discipline after that verses 15 uh
[39:38] down to 28 and you probably know the
[39:41] story but here brother Ram you know
[39:43] tells us he said for for many years I
[39:47] wondered how could Moses have a better
[39:49] idea than God it looked like God
[39:51] corrected Moses because God I'm sorry it
[39:53] looked like Moses corrected God because
[39:55] God said destroy them but Moses said no
[39:57] no no don't and then God repented of it
[40:01] but brother said I found out later this
[40:03] was Moses acting like Christ amen Moses
[40:08] asked God to forgive all the Israelites
[40:10] that's what Christ did amen Christ stood
[40:13] and asked for mercy upon all of us
[40:15] hallelujah other words we're here
[40:17] because Christ interceded for us just
[40:19] like they were there because Moses stood
[40:21] in the Gap hallelujah amen amen
[40:23] hallelujah well I used to think God in
[40:25] the Old Testament was mad at me but
[40:27] Jesus loved me he said I found out
[40:29] they're one the same
[40:31] person praise God Amen this looks like
[40:34] God's Wrath but God is just showing this
[40:36] is my this is how I have to act towards
[40:38] everybody because all have sinned and
[40:40] fallen short of the glory of God and
[40:42] I've got to have mercy upon everyone
[40:44] hallelujah amen and I'll do it by one
[40:47] man and of course for us that's Jesus
[40:49] Christ hallelujah amen amen
[40:53] amen now friends as I said this is the
[40:55] closest story I can find in the Bible
[40:58] that connects to brother R's vision of
[40:59] America let me read it from 1964
[41:02] recognizing your day and its message
[41:04] brother saw said I saw a preview of a
[41:06] lovely little bride in a vision a voice
[41:09] by the side of me said here's the
[41:10] preview of the of the Bride she came by
[41:13] she was very lovely pretty and young she
[41:15] was walking just the step as she could
[41:17] not a March just a stride of a woman how
[41:20] they walk gracefully ladylike that's the
[41:22] way she was walking coming to my left of
[41:24] the side and she went out of my side
[41:27] then he turned to me the right side and
[41:29] he showed me each Church age as theyve
[41:31] I'm sorry each church as they come out
[41:33] of the ages and I said oh how vulgar and
[41:36] the last one was this last day Church
[41:38] age which was led by a
[41:41] witch some people try to like find who's
[41:43] the witch of America well there's a
[41:44] whole bunch of them right Beyonce Oprah
[41:49] there's a whole bunch of them why you
[41:50] start naming any famous women like that
[41:52] they're
[41:52] witches they are yeah because they do uh
[41:55] demon they do demon sacrifice he said
[41:58] and they were so immorally dressed so
[42:00] filthy looking and they were marching to
[42:02] the time of twist and rock and roll now
[42:04] that's why we've been preaching on
[42:06] music because this church saw them
[42:08] dancing to rock and
[42:10] roll he said they were th these women
[42:13] were just throwing themselves with
[42:14] twists and holding this just gray
[42:18] paper he says it's a deceiving color
[42:21] holding in front of them with lace likee
[42:23] hula skirts around them in the front and
[42:25] completely Ned from the waist up and
[42:28] they're marching carrying that carrying
[42:30] on with that music and the voice said
[42:32] that is the church and when it passed by
[42:35] my heart liked to faint I thought is
[42:38] this what it's trying to be presented to
[42:40] Christ as a bride of all the efforts and
[42:42] thing that a man has put forth to try to
[42:44] bring forth the bride for Christ and a
[42:46] vulgar dirty looking prostitute like
[42:48] that to be the bride of Christ it made
[42:50] me sick at my heart I think about that
[42:54] church all the years he preached all the
[42:56] prayer lives all the traveling and he
[42:59] thought is this what my Ministry has
[43:01] produced now that ought to be
[43:02] encouraging church when when someone
[43:04] compliments your children or someone
[43:06] compliments you you ought to be
[43:07] encouraged that you're doing the right
[43:08] thing praise
[43:10] God right because it's because you're
[43:12] following the ways of the Lord so I take
[43:14] the opposite of that if if people are
[43:15] encouraged by your testimony then thank
[43:18] God you're walking the ways of God
[43:19] hallelujah amen
[43:25] amen he saysi not responsible for these
[43:27] things I can only say what I seen and
[43:29] God is my judge that was a church from
[43:31] the USA and as she passed by the whole
[43:34] back part had no covering at all so she
[43:36] was almost naked on the
[43:38] back he said I felt faint and sickly and
[43:42] then he said the bride will come into
[43:44] preview again and here the bride came
[43:47] behind her the very same looking bride
[43:49] that passed by at the beginning then my
[43:51] heart jumped for joy to know that there
[43:53] will be a bride and she'll be made of
[43:55] the the same thing and Clos with the
[43:57] same thing that was the one at was at
[44:00] the beginning she is to be called and I
[44:03] know that this is the truth if that
[44:05] isn't true then every Vision I've ever
[44:07] had in the back has been wrong and
[44:09] anyone knows not one thing he's ever
[44:11] told us was the truth hallelujah and the
[44:14] church said amen hallelujah isn't that
[44:16] beautiful brother saw the original book
[44:18] of Acts church and then the American
[44:20] Church came by he said but then the
[44:21] original Church came again and she was
[44:24] just like the book of Acts that why I
[44:26] feel led to preach on the supernatural
[44:28] book of Acts church we are continuation
[44:31] of that we are part of that praise God
[44:33] amen amen I listed 14 things I can
[44:36] probably show you 20 or 30 things where
[44:38] we are just the same as the book of Acts
[44:40] church not something different just more
[44:42] of the same hallelujah amen amen but
[44:45] look at the connection you have a a
[44:47] naked woman dancing the rock and roll
[44:50] and there in Moses presence you have
[44:52] them with music and nakedness and
[44:54] dancing to idolatry yeah
[44:57] remember Brother Sam preach which we've
[44:59] been preaching to is that music creates
[45:01] a powerful atmosphere right Hallelujah
[45:05] so we heard all these songs today to
[45:07] prepare us for this word today amen amen
[45:10] then we'll hear songs at the end to
[45:12] prepare us to act upon what we heard
[45:14] let's not just be hearers let's be doers
[45:17] of the word of God amen amen
[45:21] glory doers of the word of God so we
[45:23] seen vine stand the Gap Moses stood the
[45:26] Gap I remember Samuel send the Gap
[45:27] brother Jim preached it very well the
[45:29] hither to God
[45:32] hallelujah remember the children of
[45:34] Israel I I'll just read 1st Samuel
[45:36] 7:8 and the children of Israel said to
[45:38] Samuel cease not to cry unto the Lord
[45:42] Our God for us that he will save us out
[45:45] of the hand of the Philistines so God
[45:48] God expects the leaders to pray right
[45:52] but God also expects everyone else to
[45:54] pray as well amen amen Hallelujah so St
[45:57] Samuel stood in the gap for the
[46:00] people and he constantly prayed for the
[46:02] people and asked God to help them so
[46:04] Samuel stood in the gap for them even
[46:06] when they were wrong and wanted a king
[46:08] the love of God anointed Samuel to say
[46:10] listen he's going to take your daughters
[46:12] he's going to take your sons he's going
[46:13] to take your land but they said we want
[46:15] a king anyway but Samuel was there to
[46:17] tell them the truth when you tell
[46:19] someone the truth it's you standing in
[46:21] the gap for themen Hallelujah before
[46:24] they make the good decision before they
[46:25] make bad decision whatever decision they
[46:27] make when you stand there and tell the
[46:28] truth you are God's intercessor
[46:30] hallelujah
[46:33] amen that's
[46:35] right
[46:37] Hallelujah
[46:40] me now um if you would go to Psalms 106
[46:44] ver 23 just a few verses
[46:47] here this one is again about Moses here
[46:50] what Moses
[46:54] did one more note I want look
[46:57] at Hallelujah Psalm 10623 therefore he
[47:01] said that he would destroy them had not
[47:04] Moses his chosen stood before him in the
[47:06] breach to turn away his wrath lest he
[47:09] should destroy
[47:11] them yay they despised the pleasant land
[47:14] they believe not his word but murmured
[47:17] in their tents and hearkened not unto
[47:18] the voice of the
[47:20] Lord hallelujah now remember the Bible
[47:22] said God would not let them in the land
[47:24] because 10 times they complain before
[47:27] the Lord 10 times 10's the number of the
[47:29] law right so the law I'll give you 10
[47:31] chances and they missed it they complain
[47:33] too
[47:34] much okay but see something we got to
[47:37] learn here we got to learn to always say
[47:39] good things about people amen don't let
[47:42] gossip come into your home because here
[47:44] murmur murmuring came into their
[47:47] tents right and this led them to
[47:50] complain hallelujah amen and God didn't
[47:53] like it right right God was to be
[47:56] thankful I think we heard that last we
[47:57] and everything give be Hallelujah am
[48:00] don't look you can you can look either
[48:02] the negative or the positive let's look
[48:04] at the positive praise God Amen let's
[48:06] see what Good's going to come out of
[48:07] this hallelujah amen amen not to murmur
[48:10] and complain my dad used to call belly
[48:12] ache he said don't belly ache Jesse he
[48:14] used to tell me he said you laugh at
[48:16] pain that's what he told
[48:18] me joking around and tell my children
[48:20] that the other day you know little ones
[48:22] they fall and get hurt I said laugh at
[48:24] pain it's just a joke but in other words
[48:28] you you can't let all the pain get you
[48:30] down you got to have hope praise God
[48:34] Amen there's you know complaining about
[48:37] it is not going to help anything right
[48:39] you know my wife and I recently had an
[48:40] interesting financial situation I made a
[48:42] Big
[48:44] Blooper uh with my insurance at work I
[48:46] forgot to turn in this form and so we're
[48:49] going to see how it works out just
[48:50] hopefully I can tell a testimony on
[48:52] Wednesday but I forgot to turn this form
[48:53] in that meant my insurance was going to
[48:55] go go up
[48:58] $3,500 just because I forgot to turn one
[49:00] I got there was four things to turn in I
[49:02] did three of them I forgot one of them
[49:04] and on the day I saw that email my heart
[49:06] sunk I felt like my heart went down to
[49:09] my stomach I was like how many Financial
[49:12] mistakes can I make I broke my car I
[49:14] broke the lawn mower this year I said
[49:16] how many more can I
[49:18] make what's wrong with me somebody SLA
[49:21] me I was just I I put in the scanner and
[49:24] I sent it going to send it off and then
[49:26] some life happened I got distracted and
[49:29] my wife said as soon as she got that she
[49:30] would she said okay that's why God led
[49:32] me to fast today my wife was fasting for
[49:35] me I didn't even know
[49:37] it and so then I emailed the gentleman a
[49:40] few days later he said well looks like
[49:41] things are going to turn out okay I
[49:42] think they're going to uh they said uh
[49:44] we haven't had many people get Mercy in
[49:46] this situation but we feel like you
[49:47] might get Mercy in this situation so I'm
[49:50] asking God for
[49:51] Mercy but look you know God had my wife
[49:54] anointed to f F and pray and she's
[49:56] wonder why am I fasting why am I praying
[49:58] and then the answer came so God knows
[50:01] what we have need of praise
[50:03] God and we're going to make mistakes but
[50:06] there's no reason for me to complain
[50:07] about it right right now now my mind
[50:10] just goes to oh why am I such a failure
[50:13] why do I do this why it's not going to
[50:15] help the situation right what's going to
[50:18] help is say crying out to God and get
[50:20] God have mercy on me amen hallelujah so
[50:24] hopefully they have mercy on if not
[50:26] better not complain
[50:30] Hallelujah but
[50:33] see here God says Moses stood in the Gap
[50:37] and because Moses interceded God's Wrath
[50:39] went away because somebody s the Gap now
[50:43] go to Jeremiah 11 honey if you pull up
[50:45] Jeremiah
[50:48] 11:11 here's a uh here's an item that uh
[50:52] one of the commentators had Jameson fet
[50:54] and brown has three men that wrote A
[50:55] Commentary around used their commentary
[50:57] a couple
[50:59] times and the Bible said I found none
[51:02] but Jeremiah 11:1 says therefore thus
[51:04] sayith the Lord behold I'll bring evil
[51:06] upon them Israel which they shall not be
[51:08] able to escape and though they shall cry
[51:09] to me I will not hearken to them verse
[51:11] 12 then shall the cities of Judah and
[51:13] the habitants of Jerusalem go and cry
[51:15] unto their the gods unto whom they offer
[51:17] incense but they shall not save them at
[51:20] all in the time of their
[51:22] trouble verse 13 for according to the
[51:24] number of thy cities were thy Gods oh
[51:26] Jud now think about that every city that
[51:28] that was in Jerusalem every city that
[51:30] was in Israel had their own separate God
[51:33] that's how much that's how much idolatry
[51:36] was in that
[51:37] land I mean just totally filed now
[51:40] that's what we got today right there's
[51:41] gods of of riches there's gods of
[51:44] abortion you know murdering the children
[51:46] uh of of Financial Freedom there's gods
[51:49] of of immorality name it you name it any
[51:52] sin any sin that people love it's just
[51:54] an i in their lives and the land was
[51:57] filled with
[52:00] it now look at verse 14 here's what I
[52:02] want to get to because I thought this
[52:03] was striking when I saw this I instantly
[52:05] I was kind of like shocked and I then
[52:07] thought this quote from brother Brandon
[52:09] therefore pray not thou for this people
[52:14] neither lift up a cry or prayer for them
[52:18] did you catch
[52:19] that God's telling the prophet don't
[52:22] pray for this
[52:24] people now that reminds us there is a
[52:27] sin we don't pray for that's when
[52:28] someone blasphemes the Holy Ghost you
[52:30] don't pray for that right the Bible
[52:33] tells us but here Israel got to such a
[52:36] spot where there's Idols it just it's
[52:38] all
[52:40] idolatry thank God church you can walk
[52:42] into your home and it don't have to be
[52:43] Idols there amen thank God you can walk
[52:45] in this church and there's not idolatry
[52:47] here hallelujah praise God
[52:51] Amen pray not for this people for I will
[52:54] not hear them in the time that they cry
[52:56] to me for their trouble now that stuck
[52:59] out to me wow God told the prophet not
[53:02] to pray but then God with Ezekiel a few
[53:04] years later was saying I'm looking for
[53:06] somebody to pray amen so did God change
[53:09] his mind
[53:10] no God had Jeremiah not to pray because
[53:14] he was already a righteous man and
[53:17] because God was determined to pour out
[53:18] the Judgment but before God would allow
[53:21] that to be poured out God wanted to see
[53:23] is there anybody else that that's
[53:25] seeking after God is there anyone that
[53:27] will prolong my Mercy amen is there
[53:29] anyone else that will keep crying out
[53:30] for Longs suffering before I pour out
[53:33] the Wrath is there anybody else that
[53:34] will stand the Gap Hallelujah is there
[53:37] any other phases out there is there any
[53:39] Moses out there hallelujah amen amen
[53:42] amen God told Jeremiah you're done but I
[53:45] look for other people that will pray is
[53:47] there anybody else that will intercede
[53:50] and cry out to God hallelujah amen
[53:54] amen in 1965 trying to do God of service
[53:57] brother B said America God Bless America
[54:00] it's a nation it's a Christian country
[54:02] he said it's a million miles from being
[54:04] a Christian
[54:05] country right when Biden flies the
[54:08] homosexual Flag by the White House it's
[54:10] a me well Obama did the same thing it's
[54:13] a million miles from being a Christian
[54:15] country brother R says I don't even pray
[54:19] for it how can I pray for it and it
[54:21] won't repent under the mighty powers of
[54:24] God demonstr before
[54:26] it and denying and closing the doors to
[54:29] it and walking away he said I committed
[54:32] to God I thought wow what a perfect
[54:35] parallel Jeremiah and brother Brenham
[54:38] refused to pray for the country but God
[54:41] still gives us more time amen amen God's
[54:44] had long suffering it's been 58 years
[54:48] since brother man went off the scene and
[54:51] God is still looking today God's still
[54:53] looking for somebody that will sigh and
[54:55] cry for the Abominations done in this
[54:57] city praise God Amen I thought it was
[55:00] astounding God told B prophets don't
[55:03] pray for the nation but God's looking
[55:04] for other people today that aren't
[55:06] prophets and the church said amen that
[55:09] means you that means me God's looking
[55:11] for all of us to intercede and say God
[55:14] have mercy on this land help me to do
[55:16] righteously help me to do something
[55:17] about it praise God
[55:19] Amen that's what brother R says Don't
[55:22] Drift in your life uh just don't Drift
[55:24] from place to place have a direction
[55:26] where you're going brother R said do
[55:28] something about this condition I'll
[55:30] preach those quotes maybe Wednesday or
[55:32] next Sunday said just don't sit and be
[55:35] tossed and drift around your life do
[55:37] something about the the evil amen and if
[55:40] it's even in one's person life make a
[55:43] difference in one person's life praise
[55:47] God I've been inspired by that this week
[55:50] Hallelujah so God told Jeremiah don't
[55:52] pray for it brother Ram said I don't
[55:54] even pray for it but that doesn't mean
[55:55] we stop praying for it because God's
[55:57] still looking for a witness in this time
[56:00] amen
[56:02] hallelujah remember I read this to you
[56:04] not long ago Souls that are in prisoned
[56:06] now brother said how do you know you
[56:08] might he said uh how do you know it
[56:11] might be your righteous life that's
[56:12] holding the wrath of God from the world
[56:16] today and he's using Abraham as the
[56:18] example it was Abraham's prayer for lot
[56:21] that held back lot from being destroyed
[56:24] right amen because God remembered
[56:28] Abraham and God remember Abraham's seed
[56:32] right God will remember your prayers
[56:34] brother Amen brother Jose God will
[56:37] remember your prayers amen because God
[56:39] remembered Abraham's prayers that's
[56:41] Genesis 19 I'm going to read that
[56:43] Genesis
[56:48] 1929 he said the world won't believe it
[56:51] you women that's called holy rooll you
[56:52] little man that hardly don't know
[56:53] anything but you cry to God d and night
[56:55] for the sins of the country you might be
[56:57] the one that's holding off the wrath of
[56:59] God Amen he said if I can find 10 if I
[57:02] can find 30 he said as it was in the
[57:04] days of Sodom so shall it be in the days
[57:06] of the son of man see what I mean
[57:10] Hallelujah so church this just an
[57:12] admonition to keep praying this is an
[57:14] admonition for me like I said I'm I'm
[57:16] trying to see I'm trying to let the Lord
[57:17] teach me how I can have an impact on
[57:19] more people how I can serve other people
[57:22] instead of
[57:23] myself
[57:25] Genesis 19:29 and it came to pass when
[57:27] God destroyed the cities of the plain
[57:29] that God remembered Abraham and sent lot
[57:31] out of the midst of the overthrow when
[57:32] he overthrew the cities in the which lot
[57:36] dwelt
[57:38] Hallelujah I believe it is our prayers
[57:40] that's holding back the back the wrath
[57:42] of God don't
[57:43] you
[57:45] Hallelujah I've had different people
[57:46] tell me you know how they appreciate my
[57:48] family or me and I I always say give the
[57:50] credit to my mother's
[57:52] prayers give the credit to my grand
[57:54] grandparents prayers amen because it
[57:57] wasn't praying for me while I was
[57:58] dabbling in sin it wasn't me praying it
[58:00] was my mama praying right amen
[58:03] hallelujah who is praying for you well
[58:05] we know for our church our little girls
[58:07] were praying for Austin for five
[58:10] years Hallelujah so are
[58:12] you see somebody was praying for you and
[58:16] God remembered them well now it's our
[58:18] turn we got to pray so God can remember
[58:20] our prayers hallelujah amen amen
[58:26] like I said the testimony of
[58:28] Stephen he said Lord lay not this sin to
[58:31] their
[58:33] charge he interceded for Saul standing
[58:36] right there in the midst of him and
[58:38] church he was so humble he even kneeled
[58:40] down and prayed that's why sometimes
[58:41] we'll sing about bowing down when do we
[58:44] ever bow down though that's why
[58:45] sometimes I'll bow down when are we that
[58:47] sincere to know some of you do it every
[58:48] servant which is good I'm talking about
[58:51] each one of us like how can we be as
[58:53] sincere as possible praise God God
[58:55] that's what we want to do we want to be
[58:57] sincere and so Stephen in his think
[59:00] about that his last moments on Earth he
[59:01] gets out on his knees and doesn't ask
[59:03] for him he asking for other people
[59:05] hallelujah that's the real Spirit of
[59:08] Christ amen that's a real man God was
[59:11] seeking after a man who would stand the
[59:13] Gap and intercede for Saul who was going
[59:16] to turn into St Paul
[59:20] Hallelujah getting on his knees and
[59:22] praying that God would forgive others
[59:24] that's what we need
[59:26] today
[59:29] Hallelujah now go to uh Ezekiel
[59:34] n I've mentioned this over and over
[59:37] again and preach it over and over again
[59:38] it's important for us to do that Ezekiel
[59:53] 9:4
[59:57] all
[1:00:03] right and the Lord said unto him go
[1:00:05] through the midst of the city go through
[1:00:06] the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark
[1:00:07] upon the foreheads of the men that sigh
[1:00:09] and cry for all the Abominations that be
[1:00:11] done the midst and to the others he said
[1:00:13] in mine hearing go after ye him through
[1:00:16] the city and smite let not your eyes
[1:00:17] spare neither have you pity slay utterly
[1:00:20] young and old both maids and little
[1:00:22] children and women but come not near any
[1:00:24] man upon whom is the mark and begin at
[1:00:27] My Sanctuary they which began at the
[1:00:29] ancient men I'm sorry then they began at
[1:00:32] the ancient men which were before the
[1:00:34] house so here God is pouring out wrath
[1:00:38] upon Jerusalem this is what God was
[1:00:39] going to do right when Nebuchadnezzar
[1:00:42] came in he was going to kill everything
[1:00:44] right scatter take away everything was
[1:00:46] going to be destroyed but God said
[1:00:48] started the church in other words the
[1:00:51] people that know the most have the most
[1:00:53] responsibility amen
[1:00:55] you and I we know the most about the
[1:00:56] Bible we have the most responsibility
[1:00:58] then you obey the Bible praise God Amen
[1:01:01] Hallelujah now that should remind you of
[1:01:03] uh 1 Peter 4:17 right this is a verse I
[1:01:05] shared with my friend yesterday 1 Peter
[1:01:12] 4:17 for the time has come that judgment
[1:01:15] must begin at the house of God and if it
[1:01:17] first begin at us what shall the end of
[1:01:19] them that obey not the gospel if the
[1:01:22] righteous scarcely be saved where shall
[1:01:24] the ungodly and The Sinner appear so see
[1:01:26] we get the same idea God judges first at
[1:01:30] the church in both the Old Testament and
[1:01:32] the New Testament amen that ought to
[1:01:34] make us thankful praise God amen amen
[1:01:37] hallelujah but also makes us be
[1:01:40] responsible right the more we hear the
[1:01:42] more responsible that that we have the
[1:01:45] more faithful we should be with what
[1:01:47] we've had amen God make us faithful
[1:01:49] today Hallelujah cuz God's going to
[1:01:51] start right here God's going to start
[1:01:53] the church where we hear the the word of
[1:01:54] God and what we've heard we must obey we
[1:01:57] must believe hallelujah amen the
[1:02:01] righteous scarc course that's speaking
[1:02:02] of the foolish version like lot if the
[1:02:04] righteous scares to be
[1:02:06] saved where should the Sinner and the
[1:02:08] ungodly appear remember lot was the one
[1:02:10] who just he called homosexuality uh
[1:02:13] wickedness he had enough Grace to say
[1:02:15] that and God said he was scarcely saved
[1:02:18] he wasn't like Abraham who was way
[1:02:20] separated from it God help us to live
[1:02:22] totally separated from Sodom Hallelujah
[1:02:24] amen amen where does judgment begin
[1:02:28] right at the house of God I'll answer
[1:02:30] for what I preached but Raam said I'll
[1:02:32] Stand before God and I'll answer for the
[1:02:34] Bible that I preach amen thank God
[1:02:36] hallelujah thank God for Amazing Grace
[1:02:38] hallelujah amen there's my
[1:02:45] hour now back to
[1:02:49] Ezekiel see God wants us to sign cry and
[1:02:52] brother said that there there's a writer
[1:02:54] ink horn in other words a man had an ink
[1:02:55] pen and that ink pen represent the Holy
[1:02:58] Spirit writing upon the Believers who
[1:03:00] sighed and cried for the Abominations
[1:03:02] that were down the
[1:03:04] seity if abortion doesn't make us cry
[1:03:07] something's wrong with
[1:03:08] us right if homosexuality doesn't make
[1:03:11] us cry and weep something's wrong with
[1:03:13] us in the church say if mutilation of
[1:03:16] children don't make us cry something's
[1:03:18] wrong with us
[1:03:21] hallelujah amen is that what the Bible
[1:03:23] says something's wrong see that's why I
[1:03:26] don't I just I don't want to drip
[1:03:27] through life I want to have God's heart
[1:03:30] I want to hear God's heartbeat amen like
[1:03:31] that song I want to lay up next to his
[1:03:33] heart I want hear what is God heart what
[1:03:34] is his heart
[1:03:35] saying his heart is saying I'm looking
[1:03:37] for somebody that'll stand the Gap I'm
[1:03:40] looking for somebody that will live
[1:03:41] righteously I'm looking for somebody
[1:03:43] that will sigh and cry for the
[1:03:44] Abominations that will keep praying that
[1:03:46] will keep trying to win souls amen amen
[1:03:49] praise God
[1:03:53] hallelujah now remember this was all
[1:03:55] result of what had happened in the
[1:03:57] previous
[1:04:00] chapter so I want to
[1:04:02] uh show something if I can find it here
[1:04:05] real quick yeah case you go and switch
[1:04:07] over here I just had just a
[1:04:12] simple remember I showed this one here
[1:04:14] not long ago I preached on uh yeah the
[1:04:17] Deeds of nickus remember that one
[1:04:18] remember remember that service it was it
[1:04:19] Wednesday night yeah Wednesday night
[1:04:22] little while
[1:04:23] ago remember there's four steps to the
[1:04:25] the process of the Antichrist religion
[1:04:27] so basically uh devil religion right
[1:04:30] it's Jezebel religion like the Roman
[1:04:32] Catholic church today is the modern
[1:04:33] example but also it was foreshadowed by
[1:04:36] those the the insects out of Joel
[1:04:38] chapter 1 and chapter
[1:04:40] 2 and I forgot about this but
[1:04:44] um I added another column for today
[1:04:48] because the Reason God said start of the
[1:04:50] sanctuary was because in chapter 8 of
[1:04:53] Ezekiel
[1:04:54] God showed Ezekiel there was four levels
[1:04:57] of wickedness in the in the
[1:04:59] Tabernacle the first step was at the
[1:05:02] anry of the church was an image of
[1:05:06] jealousy right that's in uh Ezekiel
[1:05:08] chapter
[1:05:10] 8 so God is a jealous God and Israel put
[1:05:13] up some image so right when you walk in
[1:05:15] the door you're already breaking the
[1:05:17] word of God in idolatry isn't that what
[1:05:20] they got a lot today they got a lot of
[1:05:21] big mega churches and signs and they'll
[1:05:23] call themselves like my goodness Lord
[1:05:26] have mercy I know the pastor of the
[1:05:29] church that has that homosexual flag
[1:05:31] right outside right outside the Church
[1:05:32] of Christ I know the pastor I just saw
[1:05:34] him this
[1:05:35] week that's an image of
[1:05:37] jealousy right you put up an idol right
[1:05:40] out there that's an idol of
[1:05:42] sin and this is why God was going to
[1:05:45] send forth all the Slayers in the city
[1:05:47] but he's starting at the church because
[1:05:49] they know the Bible
[1:05:52] right next was God took Ezekiel further
[1:05:55] in and on all the walls was abomination
[1:05:57] of Beast walls are salvation right walls
[1:06:01] are separation so the Abominations were
[1:06:04] all over the walls meaning there was no
[1:06:06] separation between them and Abominations
[1:06:09] oh God keep us clean amen I a man youa
[1:06:12] me this week he said can you preach a
[1:06:13] sermon on sanctification I'm like I do
[1:06:15] that every service
[1:06:16] amen huah but maybe I'll do that tonight
[1:06:19] or something with the young ones so I
[1:06:21] can make a recording for this guy but
[1:06:23] just emphasize ING with a a new heart
[1:06:26] new spirit God's spirit amen the new
[1:06:30] spirit is where you have walls of
[1:06:32] Salvation I'm separated uh from Pride
[1:06:35] I'm separated from lust I'm separated
[1:06:37] from anger and fear and riches and I'm
[1:06:41] separated from all that I got walls of
[1:06:43] Salvation hallelujah amen I'm protected
[1:06:46] by God I'm delivered Hallelujah and
[1:06:48] there's Holiness in this house
[1:06:51] hallelujah thank God Hallelujah now the
[1:06:54] third one was interesting I to look it
[1:06:56] up that's one I was looking up here
[1:06:57] tamuz the women were crying for
[1:07:01] tamuz tamuz was uh an an uh it was an
[1:07:06] idol it was a false
[1:07:08] god and he was kind of like the promised
[1:07:10] son so it's like an imitation of of
[1:07:13] Jesus right Satan's imitation of
[1:07:15] Jesus and so these women these women
[1:07:19] every time uh the fall equinox or the
[1:07:21] winter equinox would happen
[1:07:24] they would cry because it's going to
[1:07:26] it's winter time's going to come and so
[1:07:29] that's why these women were crying
[1:07:30] winter time was coming and it was a it
[1:07:32] was a festival it was a holiday it's
[1:07:34] kind of like Halloween or something like
[1:07:35] that or Santa
[1:07:37] Claus the women were participating in
[1:07:40] that and the further you got into the
[1:07:42] presence of God the more idolatry they
[1:07:44] were and and the Bible says they were
[1:07:46] weeping over winter and this Festival
[1:07:49] rather than weeping for all the sins
[1:07:51] that were in the
[1:07:52] city see Church some people say I don't
[1:07:55] have emotions for God that's a
[1:07:57] lie you can watch a video on YouTube and
[1:08:00] you'll
[1:08:01] cry yeah I watched one this morning and
[1:08:03] I cried this man went uh he's a he's a
[1:08:06] talk show host guy he's a Christian guy
[1:08:08] he talks about posi he went to the the
[1:08:10] the poorest city in Alabama and set up a
[1:08:13] a a free Christmas gift place and they
[1:08:17] gave this little boy one of those uh uh
[1:08:20] police cars that you drive around what
[1:08:21] are they call the Tonka cars what do
[1:08:23] they call it your boy's got one James
[1:08:25] got one what do they call those electric
[1:08:28] cars power Power Wheels that's it power
[1:08:31] they got the battery they gave him one a
[1:08:34] police car cuz his dad was a police
[1:08:36] officer and he got murdered there in the
[1:08:38] city and this this YouTuber he bought he
[1:08:42] bought all these kids in the whole town
[1:08:44] whatever Christmas toy they wanted I
[1:08:45] just started weeping and crying like
[1:08:47] what an act of
[1:08:48] kindness right but I'll cry over that in
[1:08:52] the
[1:08:52] church in other words we're so easily
[1:08:55] give our emotions to things but we also
[1:08:57] we must give our best emotions to God
[1:09:01] hallelujah and if we're if we're getting
[1:09:03] hardened toward God we got to get say
[1:09:05] God soften my heart like that song says
[1:09:08] break my heart for what breaks yours
[1:09:10] amen hosan I
[1:09:13] think break my heart for what breaks
[1:09:15] yours
[1:09:17] Hallelujah and God's rebuking them he's
[1:09:19] showing Ezekiel look they got images
[1:09:21] they've got Abominations they're crying
[1:09:24] over a false idol rather than crying for
[1:09:26] the sins that are done in the midst of
[1:09:28] the people the last thing he shows them
[1:09:30] remember he shows them the elders all
[1:09:32] the elders they had their backs turned
[1:09:34] from the Ark of the Covenant and they're
[1:09:35] all worshiping the son the the just the
[1:09:38] very uh the very epitome of abomination
[1:09:42] worshiping the creation rather than the
[1:09:44] Creator
[1:09:46] amen this is why God said and this is
[1:09:49] happening where in the house of
[1:09:51] God and this is why God said said I'm
[1:09:53] going to pour out my wrath upon this
[1:09:56] place but God said I'm still looking for
[1:09:58] somebody that'll sigh and cry for the
[1:10:00] Abominations church we don't know how
[1:10:01] long we're going to be here I'm going to
[1:10:02] take that
[1:10:04] off like I said we've been here 58 years
[1:10:07] since brother R
[1:10:10] passed the generation that knew brother
[1:10:12] brandom is dying out swiftly 202 24 will
[1:10:16] be 59 years since brother R died 2024
[1:10:20] will also be the 118th year of the lean
[1:10:23] Church age
[1:10:24] making it longer than the Ephesian
[1:10:26] Church age so officially brother bang
[1:10:29] our church age is not the shortest
[1:10:31] anymore everybody thought it was
[1:10:34] everybody thought this would be the
[1:10:35] shortest Church age well here we go com
[1:10:37] a couple weeks now all these people that
[1:10:39] predicted things look see that's why we
[1:10:41] don't want to make predictions right
[1:10:42] right it's okay to make our opinions
[1:10:44] about things but let's not stuff let's
[1:10:46] not be a stuff shirt like I know
[1:10:48] everything about it let's be humble
[1:10:51] hallelujah we're coming up on 59 years
[1:10:53] and then 118
[1:10:56] years of the lean Church
[1:10:59] age and if if God does it the same way
[1:11:02] here in America as God did in Israel
[1:11:06] then God is going to wait till there's
[1:11:07] no more people signing and crying for
[1:11:09] the
[1:11:10] Abominations right other than Jeremiah
[1:11:12] baroo the real Godly Christians but then
[1:11:14] God told Jeremiah don't pray for it
[1:11:18] anymore see he's the same yesterday
[1:11:21] today and forever
[1:11:26] Lord willing Wednesday I'll read another
[1:11:27] quote brother ra said the greatest
[1:11:29] thrill of my
[1:11:33] life he said is serving others living
[1:11:37] for
[1:11:37] others the greatest thrill of my
[1:11:40] life it's living for other
[1:11:43] people and I want to say this not the
[1:11:45] people that it's easy to live for it's
[1:11:47] the people that's hard to
[1:11:49] live actually I'll read it right now
[1:11:52] brother talking he talking with his
[1:11:56] doctor he said for all these years 31
[1:11:58] years of ministry now I've only got 19
[1:12:00] in I preach been preaching
[1:12:02] 19 you got 31 he said I kept my heart
[1:12:06] prepared for the hour when he Jesus
[1:12:08] comes so it doesn't matter to me when he
[1:12:10] comes how many can say Amen to that it
[1:12:11] don't matter when he comes I'll be
[1:12:13] serving him right
[1:12:14] here the doctor said that's true I said
[1:12:17] the greatest thrill I have is living for
[1:12:22] others
[1:12:26] and brother said that's what life is it
[1:12:29] makes life real ever feel like you feel
[1:12:32] numb and life is just ever meaningless
[1:12:34] anybody besides me ever feel
[1:12:37] that you get into the routine of life
[1:12:40] well it's Monday morning again here I go
[1:12:42] it's Thursday morning
[1:12:44] here and life sometimes doesn't feel
[1:12:46] real is this really
[1:12:51] happening Brother Ram said that that's
[1:12:53] what makes life real is when you're
[1:12:56] living for other
[1:13:00] people not what you can do or accomplish
[1:13:03] for yourself but what you can do for
[1:13:07] others and I see I'm tying this in with
[1:13:10] prayer right praying for the people
[1:13:12] interceding try to make a the Bible said
[1:13:14] try to make a difference in one person's
[1:13:16] life praise
[1:13:17] God who can I make a difference in their
[1:13:21] life that they can say thank God brother
[1:13:23] amen did that for her thank god sister
[1:13:25] Zer did that for thank god sister n was
[1:13:27] able to do that I'm talking about
[1:13:29] outside the church I mean you want to
[1:13:30] help people in the church but I'm just
[1:13:31] saying like who can we make a difference
[1:13:33] for in their
[1:13:36] life see that's when you're really
[1:13:40] living Hallelujah and if there happens
[1:13:42] to be someone Among Us who's never did

[1:16:06] be thought of is when you do for someone
[1:16:08] else to make life's burdens which he
[1:16:12] says life in itself is a burden and the
[1:16:14] church

[1:17:18] caught up in Heavenly places Stephen
[1:17:19] said lay it not to their charge he's
[1:17:21] living for somebody else pray for
[1:17:23] somebody else with his last words he
[1:17:24] wasn't praying God prepare me God he's
[1:17:26] saying God forgive them I know I'm
[1:17:28] forgiven he was so close to Christ that
[1:17:30] he saw Christ right before his death yes
[1:17:33] and he spent his last words sister
[1:17:35] beatric his last words were praying for
[1:17:37] other people praise God oh my what a
[1:17:41] Christian they not to their charge
[1:17:44] God remember Paul said the same thing in
[1:17:46] second Timothy chapter
[1:17:48] 4 he said at my first answer no man
[1:17:51] stood with me but all men forsook me me
[1:17:53] I pray God that it may not be laid to
[1:17:56] their charge I think one or two chapters
[1:17:58] later he says the end is now for me I
[1:18:00] fought a good fight I finished the
[1:18:02] course in his last words he's saying God
[1:18:06] be merciful to those that have forsaken
[1:18:09] me praying for mercy upon other
[1:18:12] people the Bible says pray without
[1:18:15] ceasing the Bible says 1 Timothy 2 vers1
[1:18:18] I exhort therefore first of all
[1:18:21] supplications prayers intercession
[1:18:23] that's the intercession that's my title
[1:18:25] God saw an
[1:18:27] intercessor intercessions and giving of
[1:18:29] thanks be made for all
[1:18:31] men for kings and all that are in
[1:18:34] Authority that we may lead a quiet and
[1:18:36] PE peaceful life in all godliness and
[1:18:38] honesty for this is good and acceptable
[1:18:40] in the sight of God our savior verse
[1:18:42] eight I will therefore that men pray
[1:18:44] everywhere lifting up holy
[1:18:47] hands without wrath and doubting amen
[1:18:50] praise
[1:18:51] God you know why this means you know why
[1:18:54] intercession means so much to us because
[1:18:56] of what Jesus
[1:18:58] does like Moses did Moses in the gap for
[1:19:01] the entire nation Jesus in the gap for
[1:19:03] the entire human race
[1:19:06] Hallelujah the entire billions upon
[1:19:09] billions upon trillions of people Jesus
[1:19:12] Christ stood in the Gap took our sin
[1:19:14] upon him and now he ever lives to make
[1:19:18] intercession for us he now appears in
[1:19:20] the presence of God for us so that
[1:19:23] encourages us who can we stand in the
[1:19:25] presence of God for today amen we got
[1:19:29] some good requests like sage in Jordan

[1:19:34] presence of God I we know they're not

[1:19:38] hallelujah we're the ones that will
[1:19:40] stand in the presence of God for them
