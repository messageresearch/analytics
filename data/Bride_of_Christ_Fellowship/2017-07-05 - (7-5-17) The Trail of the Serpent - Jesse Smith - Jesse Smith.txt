stand on Jesus inside that [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] I like to open up to Larry to portion scriptures let's go to Matthew 7:1 preach on familiar thought tonight but take it a little different angle I never preached this thought before but if you listen to my friend and you've heard him say it I like to preach on the trail of the serpent tonight by God's grace I've never preached on that thought I've studied it out a lot of this will be a review but I just want to bring the whole thought through and numerous indications of that this this week and even today so what's with you guys the freaks you try to see witnesses you know when you see two or three witnesses you know then you kind of feel that's led of the ward so I believe this we let them lure this night by God's grace so Matthew chapter 13 or 713 Matthew 7:13 on the trail of the server enter ye in at the strait gate but why is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat because Strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find that beware a false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves you shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles so at every and even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast in the fire whereby by their fruits you shall know them I'm gonna Mathew 24:24 very firm in Scripture but this one lay this in here grace of the Lord as it's a mayor one but it's a very crucial scripture it's going to be so close and as we get down to the end as we keep going on the time goes on it's going to be it's going to take more discernment of the Holy Spirit to be able to show which is the true church which is the foster because that's what Jesus said it's gonna be so close we receive the river like if it were possible but we know it's not possible I'd be 2424 let's read this one together one two three four there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect a man let's have word prayer if you just buy your head if you have a need on your hearts and they could go into God somehow God is the great provider is the great discerner of the thoughts of tens of the heart Heavenly Father we come to you tonight reverently lord san your songs we're standing on your side of the praying on your side we're waving on your side we're jumping on your side we are on your side and your side is the side with the word the sharp sword so Lord let your word come forth Lord tonight in power demonstration Jesus Lord as we labor in order to present the truth Lord God and father I just pray God that your people will be blessed may you meet every need God speak to us here tonight train us and righteousness the Lord God and we'll give you all the glory honor and praise in Jesus Christ the church say Amen god bless she's being seen I don't have many slides I I spent most of my time today you know finishing the third video so I just have a few slides to show so now Kevin ready buddy I don't have many to show and I might people tell me keep doing that brother blessing that's what we're like that so I want to do that and I believe it just it's building up training for newcomers by God's grace to me it's kind of like this cycle ship create those videos visiting a source so I can point people to I can even point myself I was gonna teach you to someone who's never heard it before this is what I would say and so we spent hours and hours you know working on those like today they'll be used for the kingdom of God more and more God's grace so I wanted to stop the trail of the serpent I'd like to start just by reviewing a few things and we set my timer here just got a reminder my timer I want to go too long so we remember you cannot remember brother Adam said Satan hates two books more than any other books of the Bible Genesis to Revelation Genesis shows how he started revelation shows how he ends up so those are the two books he hates more than anything they expose him and Satan hates to be exposed so church we know if we're hiding anything in our hearts and we're afraid to confess something are afraid to go talk to somebody or afraid we know that's the enemy that's the enemy got into our minds and he's built up a stronghold or we'd say our root of bitterness I don't been studying on that my freetime that student by God's grace very similar to a complex you know people build up a complex and they get a certain feeling or certain attitudes toward a certain individual or church or group of people as we said on Sunday the people Satan's probably going to get you to bow the most are people right of the church right you know you'll have enemies outside the church but Satan loves to come in he loves the spoil the fellowship the godly fellowship amongst a believer so we want to be we want to be right the post of duty program still above all else he's an honor God in this house that he said above all else love one another so we want to love one another by God's grace and we're doing that tonight by God's grace by gathering in the house of the Lord so he hates Satan hates the expose of his plans to steal kill and destroy he has those plans to steal from believers to kill believers and destroy their lives you know as I was reading through these quotes there's I found six quotes on the trail of the serpent they all go from October of 65 to December of 65 I remember brother Graham died on New Year's or Christmas Eve 1965 we have six quotes so this is a thought he had developing for about three months October November and December and said when he got back to Jeffersonville he was going to preach a four-hour sermon on the trail of the serpent he's going to call it the Beast at the beginning and the beast at the end and so I want to read through a few of these clothes but I the stock came to me one time now guy had a book out of the Malka I will cry have to help in just a minute but there was three types of trails that certain that snakes left one was a straight trail a Malachi said the bigger the snake is the straighter the trail is the second one was was about a side minding okay the side line and that's that's a poisonous snake like wider rattlesnake okay so that's up so if you see a trail that and the sand like that that's usually a poisonous snake what was the other one well this is snake side when he's kind of lifting the body over sand one of them lives in one of them so they're side to side but no one just goes straight forward so it's interesting there's three main tracks and Satan steal kills and destroys and there's three levels of temptation right the lust of the eyes the pride of life and lust the flesh and that's strike it well what is it they're all they're all the same dirty snakes now most people have a phobia of snakes right because I've never said because it's a figure of Satan and because that's where sin came in in the beginning so that's just something you want to see there the snake has three different types of trails and there's three avenues that Satan works in right as we just saw less than the eyes less the flesh and the pride of life all temptation comes through those channels so I think it's very it's very a good teaching a very good type of Satan and his works and let me read these quotes out this one hit the highlights here this isn't power transformation October 31st Halloween night for then now he says don't forget this little flag the church in the last days is going to be twins so close it'll be the see the very left in Mathew 24:24 the church is going it's a Pentecostal move it's so much like the real thing so would this seems a very lectern if it were possible and a little later on if I get a chance I would explain that how that election comes it's going to deceive them because it's almost like the same thing see just two fathers good he says that's all say mother st. charts movement same thing the betting drives is the same where the word falls one of them but one of them like here is perverted so do you see that there's one betting ground but there's two fathers that remind you of Jesus Matthew 13 remember the parable the parable of the field and the wheat and the tares there's one field two different sewers Jesus said that was like it unto the world the Sun man was the good seller and the man in black was Satan and they're sewing their seeds in one field right and that field is the world right so we have believers and unbelievers two fathers in one field jesus said the good seat of the Turner of the kingdom and he will see the tares are the bad seed or the children of destruction we know that and also the type of the Garden of Eden where you had one field Eve and you had two different so where's the serpent and you had Adam that's right now that's what the Prophet says now he said it's going to be a Pentecostal move now did you ever think of that church it's going to be so close what's the prophecy for our day the prophecy is that the bride asked to look just like what Pentecost right now state the Lord the pharmacist of Pentecost must be in the bride so she's got to have the power she's got to have the doctor she's got to have the word the holiness all these things but Satan's gonna copy that and they're gonna have some type of anointing right the Bible said to have live signs and wonders right now some type of with Nike and here the Bible said false Christ's right the word Christ means The Anointed One but Jesus added the S on the end to Christ and now we have Christ's plural which is also anointed ones their anointed with the true sphere from times but then they're going to it the false spirit but the true believer is going to be anointed with the true spirit all the time and then we'll have a few mistakes here and there and some things will trip up and fall but the true believer is going to have the true anointing all the time being there but the false the make believers can have a shrewd electing some time and then the posture no - and it's for deception once for murder so we're going to expect the false church to come out of I'm sorry we're going to expect the falsey to come out of the church there there there field there a woman so both churches are going to are both people will see they're going to be in churches that's what the Prophet tells us but one has the word and the other one has a perverted word he says now and I go home this time I've preached on the subject the trail the serpent the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end the trail and trail him right through the Bible and show how he heads up so what's heads up me show how he looks at the end so my man's design was a show Safet in the beasts at the beginning and then to show him at the end praise God he said just watch how cunning that fellow is well they're like the Judas and Jesus they're both brothers in their tribe like Esau and Jacob and the crow in the Dove sitting in the same roof everything is a twin in this great warfare that we're sin again amens did you realize that I'm too big your true believer tonight well guess what you've got a twin thanks God someone's trying to mimic your life if you're a true believer you're walking in faith walking by the word Satan's trying to limit your life and you've got a twin somewhere oh my Jesus had a twin ah headaches when Moses had a twin every all the true believers have a twin but the one difference will be those who stay with the Word of God you know that amen but perhaps on the enemy uses deception and we don't want to have any deception I don't I'm not scared to preach any doctrine or brother brand on the left I don't want there to be any questions that's why I hand out those sheets if you've got a question bring it to me there should be no deception in our church you should know exactly what we believe exactly where we find the Bible because it should be all the Spirit of Truth thing that we've got major doctrines that we cannot prove it or something that you know we don't know it just set it on the shelf and perhaps gobbler revealing it is all the time that's right Loretta said in the second quote this isn't trying to go to service he talks about it again another for our sermon he said don't join up with those organizations one day I'm telling you don't the market the beach just remember it is the mark the lease from the beginning he was the beast the garden eating is a beast at the end to show that he's a religious person and the denomination and come right through this rail of it and proved you by the scriptures than it is I didn't know that - the Holy Spirit gave me the other day of their day men so the Holy Spirit showed brother branham that the Antichrist beast or spirit here is religious which we know and he'll come through a denomination it's exactly right now just skip the third quote as it just says the trail the serpent the fourth thing of the fourth quarter of a percent modern events make them our prophecy nothing against the people in the church but if the systems of the thing that's wrong with a preach of the trailer serpent listen to him you take the tapes now notice they missing the confirmation of the prophecies of God's Word being fulfilled so what does that mean the falsies will miss the prophecies that are for our day praise the Lord the prophecies about the fullness of Pentecost the prophecies about the move is on the rise now saith the Lord they're going to miss those prophecies and they're only going to want to get the anointing and power and church membership the ramps that are fighting for their churches they're not fighting for Christ praise God they're fighting for their churches they're more interested in their big buildings and big memberships and money than they really are about living the Word of God amen the 5th quote says this about the same thing I never received said I never want to have nothing to do with the organization he said if that ain't a Pharisee I never seen one Loretta tells the story he was going to pray for a sick person in the hospital a Nana they had curtains up you probably seen curtains up where they have curtains behind the you know in front of the sick people he was asking a family member can I go in and pray for your family member and the woman said he said remember she's had to pull that curtain the band was trying to get there he said quiet curtain and he sounded just like to offer prayer and she said we're Methodists we don't believe in divine healing he said at Curtin and that's what brother Graham said that's a Pharisee if I ever saw one seem more interested in their church than they are actually for the Word of God to be fulfilled like one of our precious brothers recently his family said if you don't come to our church we're cutting you off right what is that what kind of spirit is that rather than rejoicing and somebody will praise God there to church that's what we do right don't we do that praise God our families in the church let me start the church those that are in a church right it's better than a bar it's better than being drunk on the streets better than a prostitution house I've never gone but see that spirit of organization Senate it's either my church of the highway but we know different we know gonca right who all gather around the carcass of the word the endtime work but we also know God's got a foolish virgin as well we know it's a sea we know we don't hold people to our church it's not attracting us to us but all those Eagles that are hungry for the word will gather around the word Amen that's exactly right church provider I said that's the spirit behind the Antichrist oh you're not a Methodist don't pray for we don't believe in that you don't belong to our church stay out of that now I'm not saying that family home at that spirit but it sure looks like it if I would say if you don't come to my church you're going to hell that's wrong that's awful that's awful we don't want the spirit of the Pharisee because there are more in love with their churches their interpretation rather than God's interpretation we know that romance awaits you here the trailer surfer nothing now think now that their denomination is the only one that registers was with God that's what they think their church is the only London registers with God God no hearing unless you're Methodists or Baptists or Trinity or oneness or something like that but man said that's wrong last quote was from leadership 19 I'm sorry December 7th 1965 and so actually the last full sermon he preached the last recorded part was communion at Peregrine's Church he spoke for 34 minutes on communion but this is actual a sermon preached he says no he said it's coming to church and state again right on you you see your go right in there and you'll take the mark of the beast not knowing it if you ever bought one of my tapes get this when I get it when I get home the trail of a serpent and you'll see where it's at see where this ends of that all right separate like those quotes by God's grace but the man just laid out a few things that we're already familiar with like I said some of this will be familiar but I want to go through and I want to see through the bible quotes or scriptures about the beast and how he operates let's go to Genesis 3 we'll start right there by the grace of the Lord now this is all I - this has been all my - I've been studying the beast and the serpent and everything the last few months rather sorry Genesis chapter 3 now before me December program says serpent seed will not save anybody there we believe that you can still be saved even if you don't believe in the Serpent's seed but brother I said what does it do yeah actually actually said two things he said to the serpent see that's the killer right there that's the killer doctor where they can come to church for a while but would you stop preaching on the Serpent's eat manna that's the kill now to kill there or desire to come many times oh but my back said what does it do it doesn't save you but it shines more like upon what we're all trying to see what are we trying to see we're trying to see the truth of the atonement of crying then that's why Christ had to come by verge of birth because sin entered through a sexual act so God had to bypass that and bring Redemption through a virtual earth amen and then God was starting a new race the beginning of the creation of God the firstborn among many brethren I'm glad I was one of those many brethren and egg to be born again of God other than the gonna have the power of the Spirit in our lives they dead we ought to be thankful for that treatment how do you remember the serpent in verse 1 Genesis 3:1 the serpent was more subtle than all the beasts of the field the Lord our God had made sorry I got my pages stuck together now subtle means sly or crafty the serpent was the most crafty animal of all now what does he do Church he starts attacking the word oh yes God said you'll surely die so this is the Beast the beginning what's he doing he's misinterpreting the word to Eve I remember he was a standing upright man a man-like creature but madam said he was somewhere between the chimpanzee and a man right somewhere between there and the building and reasoning ability to talk and what happened when Graham said the fruit that even serpent partook of was the fruit of adultery that was the fruit they partook of and the doctors act and then program said that they had that act and then at one at some point later she went and took that fruit the knowledge of that act that sexual ation took it to Adam and they partook together what was Adam's sin the sin that wasn't necessarily the act the sin was that Adam hearkened unto his life praise God it's the same thing Abraham did that brought about Ishmael God chasin Adam because you and Abraham because you've hearkened unto the voice of that life now romantic ptosis at some point God would have told Adam had they stayed in sin or stayed in purity not sin rather he would have allowed her a lot of him to go into her but it wasn't the time in season so you see how God's got a time in season for everything hey he's got a time in season but Satan got in there first and injected his seed in there now I want to show this I don't know brother Adams uh pristineness we have an article from July 1994 from the Journal of forensic sciences that proves a woman can have relations with two different men after never cease and bring twins from two different seats so it's all in the video I put on our video today some on the video today but it says right there but female has intercourse with two males at short intervals within the same ovulatory period Superfund acacia make her so that's a fancy word for for that whatever that is the results show that each twin to come from a different father so this is clearly backed up by by science and remember I think I'm preaching out low to go that scientists found DNA and snakes remember that that they had DNA to build arms the legs at one point that pollution says I'll see them they evolved but by the way there's no ok God Kirsten God took the arms and legs away chief of Medicine changed every bone in the body and put him on his belly it's exactly right amen praise the Lord now remember the beast was cursed the serpent was cursed but God never curse Adam and Eve why cuz God doesn't curse his children for he's God the Bible said the ground was cursed for Adam sing right did they have punishments yes they had punishments but they were punished Eve was punished in her reproductive parts and she was punished and reproduction of seed why because with God the punishment fits the crime an eye for an eye tooth for tooth right a foot for a foot leg for a leg right David remember David David put the sword in your Icehouse and God said because you had this sword in your Icehouse the sword will not depart from your house all the days of your life because you slept with your eyes wife secretly someone will sleep with your eyes publicly and that's what his son Absalom did so see the punishment fits the crime are you with me so her punishment was in her private parts her loins because that's what that's what that's the mistakes she made she took the wrong seed so in bringing for seed there was always going to be a pain and remind her of what she did did everybody see that by God's grace amen hope you can see that by the grace of the Lord amen now revelation 12:7 let's whatever you got your Bible revelation 12:7 I'm actually going to go out of order is this is the actual this is the trailer this actually the Serpent's first action revelation 12:7 says is first actually I just thought I start in Genesis everybody feeling good tonight by God's grace if I feel good we love the Lord tonight in any lorry relation 12 7 and there was a war in heaven Michael his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out of the earth and his angels were cast out with him so here is actually the first recording of that least write of Satan he starts to award heaven he splits the church he wants to exalt his stars above the stars of God so go to Isaiah 14 I don't know if my children I've ever read these scripts yourself if it's not for you the adults then hope for the children by God's grace because they need to know these scriptures they met Isaiah 14 verse 12 verse 12 Hartnell fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didn't weaken the nations for the I said in my heart I will ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars with God I will also sit up on the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north so what does he want to do he wants to be above God he wants to worship Him he wants to go where he wants the honor but the way to be honor with God is to humble yourself but he wants to keep exalting himself more attention and more adoration but the get it is to humble yourself I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the Most High yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit they--this see these linearity look upon me and considerably saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms that made the world as a wilderness and destroy the cities there up and open not the house of the prisoners look at this I hope we can have that thought tonight compared to Christ's sake it is just a little man that weakened the nation's for medicine he's got no power except what you've given right so that's gonna get us ain't any powder let's not give Satan any evil thoughts let's not give Satan any confession of well I'm sick or or this will never happen let's give God all the glory let's give God all the power because they're all good-looking centers that's the man now we know program say you're no match for me so let's not make fun of sickness not do those types of things but let's remember greater is the Holy Ghost in me than he that's in the world today the head the Holy Ghost inside of us should not fear the enemy we should resist him and then Satan will flee from us amen on the new young oh there we go that's resisting tonight amen let's cast out any thought is exhausted so against the words of God amen I'm a child of God we come to God's able to feed on God's Word I come to worship God will cast out anything that distracts us from worshiping God Amen under there yeah that's exactly right amen all right next let's go back to Genesis 4 let's go back to Genesis forward Cain and Abel the next step of the circuit the next trail we see him with blood on his hands Genesis 4 now we're premiere with this Kane offers a sacrifice it's not free it's not accepted by God and we saw him Sunday I brought up those quotes from victory day but the random said Cain should have went like this instead of getting angry a table for the RAM said he should have stood there and said wonderful brother Abel you found the right buddy to worship now we could all be accepted hallelujah but instead he got upset what do you mean that's my brother I hate you he got upset instead of saying praise God we found the way amen see instead of being happy for somebody it's blessed he got jealous and brother Graham said that's what starts every more jealousy you saw that on Victory Day on Sunday we preached on Independence Day and looked at the American Revolution I love you but that was a good message to me how about every officer doing that because I got independence in Christ amen I'm gonna be independent from all churches I'm in the better football creeds and I'm solely dependent upon Christ amen but see jealousy is what starts and when we see somebody get blessed and set up being disturbed we should say praise God I believe I might be next my miracle might be next amen oh yeah that's right good but see Cain he got upset and his countenance set up so before he was happy and now all the time he said so be careful how we look then we come to house of God be careful what our face looks like when we see one another right out of it or come as Joyce remain happy joyful positive right thankful if I was going to be thankful in all things we all get discouraged but let's take encouragement amen let's let's make sure our countenance is the right comments now notice in verse 7 God said if you do well Cain know modes if you obey like Abel won't you be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lies at the door so see sins gonna be waiting outside your dwelling place oh you're not gonna be able to stay get your sin you're gonna be a slave to sin and I'm to these shall be his desire not shout rule over in so notice again God tries to correct Cain Cain doesn't take direction so if you see how important it is that you can be corrected at church Cain will not he won't be corrected by the Holy Spirit right so sin is going to remain there he's going to keep having around countenance he's going to be up Rauf he's going to be upset and what does it lead to Church to sin lieth at the door or to lead to he took that st. it might and killed his brother because it was laying right there his door see if we don't cast it down it's going to remain in our lives we got to live up here - man you gotta have minds that are pure from roots of bitterness see how this bitterness took a root in his life right how we need the Holy Spirit every hour amen so God says this is the way to do it if you do it you'll rule over your brother because he's the firstborn of the twins but he turned down he turned down ruling because he didn't want to Humble himself and obey what would that look like today that looked like today somebody that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and somebody saying well I don't have to act like that or I don't have to live like that why do I live like that why can I enjoy whatever I'm not gonna get rid of all that I want to enjoy my worldly life and God will leave with them sermon after sermon after sermon given up but when they all in a row that seed of iniquity will grow into something evil pretty soon you'll find the haughty evil in their life brother cam had a man that went to a church went to his church for a while got baptized obeyed after a few years he found something didn't like and church it was in the news we got all the news pretty soon he fell in love with a girl and then we'll need a message she pulled him away and later she framed him for child abuse and house servant almost 20-some years in prison and broke both came inside and reached out and said see you shouldn't have we told you not to go with this girl this but it started off with doubting and disbelieving parts of the message and then got pulled away into an ungodly relationship how can two walk together except they be agreed first of our so see we we can see that and who thought this is one of the nicest brothers when I go into church he had the biggest smile he was hugging me sending out the message all these things like that but what pulled him away unbelief unbelief not willing to obey all the Word of God Church he must be willing to keep every word amen when the Holy Spirit speak to us let's obey grace God it'll lead to something like that all over the news out there in Toledo frayed and that's what he said framed for child abuse but see what happens when you don't honor God oh my now remember Kane and verse 9 says I don't know where able this Eli's in the face of God so see there's another there's another attribute of the serpent see they lie to God's face right they don't obey they lie and then what they happened murder murder happened next we know that all right let's keep pilin Timmy go to first Peter 3:20 go to first Peter 3:20 we keep following that serpent we know he goes through the Giants in the days of Noah but we'll get to nap first Peter 3:20 he's got three different trails lust of the eyes less than a flash and pride of life man he's got three different trails can always tell what one looks like mercy first Peter 3:21 you look like here in the days of Noah now remember Jesus went to preach through the spirits that were in prison verse 20 which sometimes were disobedient when once this long-suffering of God waited the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water you see the serpent there what'd he do he caused them to be disobedient to know his message right and then Jesus because he was waiting just waiting well anybody else get the ark but anybody else get the art I want him to get the art I'll have to act like you holding rollers I have to get the ark away from all my worldly treasures why you talking about it's never even flood before this is lift I guarded but we're upset the art today is Christ we got to get into Christ in heaven you got to get into Christ of the scale all things of the road you got to be shut in with Christ as the holy some holidays amen yes exactly right oh you're too much about isolationist well we got to we got to get in the Christ you've got to be isolated from sin I've got to be present not equal Jesus you say that actually rival one seat disobedient so the serpent got them just disobedient to entering into disobedient and what the Bible say the days of Noah they were eating drinking Mary give it at marriage right Mary see married relationships are more important than getting in the ark right bill you know building the right kind of we'd say house you know Billy right kind of business building or whatever all these things were more important than putting God's house first amen get in the house of God that's right disobedience so Satan allows this group did this be deceived to disobey Noah here's what you're not liking I think you like this go to Genesis 28 I'm sorry Genesis 27 forget let me show you a real burden of a mother I was going to I think I might reach us on Mother's Day I don't know now this year this job's in Lima on Mother's Day I don't feel like Reese's I might have been last year this is the scripture always come as my heart when I think about Mother's Day Genesis 27 let's go to Jacob and Esau Genesis 27 verse 46 27:46 I hope this is good for both your mothers and fathers the parents this is a good scripture for everybody know this is Rebecca and Isaac young the children taking a nice tall look what Rebecca says the Isaac I am weary of my life because of the daughters of hath so she feels like she's gonna die so I'm losing her strength if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of half which were heathens such as these which are the daughters of the land what good shall my life do me look at this uh Rebecca says if my son Jacob takes the heathen life what was the purpose of me living because his wife will influence him away from the message of the our church you see that and it works he's away oh good godly woman could marry and I'm godly man hey not yours either way but look at the heart of a real mother don't so that the hardware hey my life means nothing if my tutor don't serve god that's how he should feel if my family doesn't get to say look good that's my life man if I can't win some souls bucket is my life and we want to see people serve God we should have a burden for amen Levin said you should have a desperation that's what we should have a desperation mother do you know and a desperation prevention is motivated by love so if you're not desperate for so more love of God amen amen gotta give us more of us a lot of amen so want to get more souls to the house of God now in the nick of the next chapter verse 8 28 verse 8 this is why the Bible said God hated Esau now Jacob had already stole the blessing right you know he stole the blessing the birthright blessing and then the other blessing he stole two blessings the number blessing the diverse eight says so when Esau lost his birthright and lost all the physical blessings from his family that followed the message of the hour look what he does next he knows that his mother once Jacob to marry a godly woman not a even but a real believer and Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan please not Isaac his father what he did then when Esau unto Ishmael and took unto the wives which he had how laugh the daughter of ishmael abraham's son the sister of need a job to be his wife you see that when Esau lost any physical blessing any monetary inheritance he'd say when he once he lost the bless of money to his family that he purposely went to spite them that's called malice George that's called balance which is the ill-will does every understand he reacts in malice I'm no longer getting the blessing the money for my family because Jacob took it from me so I'm gonna do something just to make them mad and I'm gonna go take a he's and wife and it's already recorded that his mother said if Jacob got married a believer what good is my life so see on the cerfancy tax there if I was said God Hannity so why do hate you saw well first right here because he we saw right here because he did despite them his parents he did an honor his mother and father aren't you glad you honored your mother father praise God I am to whatever degree I could I'm glad I hired my mother and father what was the other thing he sold out the birthright for food right you sort out her birthright just like Judith sells it out he didn't think he had no confidence that God could just help him to get over his hunger so he sold out his connection in the Messiah his connection to the next trip to be the next generation leader let me say this he sought out the Ministry of the Holy Spirit for a meal ticket praise God let me tell you this for a denominational meal to you can I say like that he could have been connected to the message the our leading the family but he saw the same thing his King right could have led the ferry could be the leader but turned down the spiritual leadership or natural blessing that's Judas right there and through through selling out the truth for money that's myself rather gather with a bunch of holy rollers tonight even if there's only a handful of them that be in some big denominational Church with big money all things like that why cuz we're just like we're just like Jacob Amen we want the birthright we wouldn't be connected to Christ me believe he's coming where his people they don't hate men we're the people of the Messiah we're his children hallelujah we're the ones who are part of the kingdom of God amen it's not my money it's not buy these things it's my prayer and obedience to the Word of God how to do you we've never seen this we don't have time but in Hebrews 12 verse we're met her me Hebrews 12:16 Esau was also a fornicator which means the sexual sit before marriage and then he also had multiple wives now I know at this time Abraham had already had him but he took he started getting more and more lives so there's danger with that now I'm told some of their danger taking multiple wives so see what he did he had some sexual sins right and he also in malice and it will tortoise parents and purposely married offside the faith and we see that with many message people right they grow up in the message kids and now purposely because they're against the Word of God they'll go marry outside the faith despite the Word of God now I hope there I hope there's some salvation for those people yet hope they repent get right with God but that's a Esau act to disregard the training you've been raised up in is an act of Esau not have mercy on Seoul to do that now the next one was most how many Moses had a couple twins he had a couple twins yeah Balaam and Cora we know what Balaam Balaam was pretty throw money right middle of that little head repeatedly Cora though remember Claire stop chorus thought was that we're all holy we can all be priests that was his thought you're not the leader Moses God doesn't have a one-man message a one prophet message and a priesthood we all can be priests and God so hated that thought that he swallowed them up in the earth praise the Lord and I'm time to put that one up but it's in the Book of Numbers God the swaddle of Korah because he said we're all holy and he said Moses you did this up your own thinking so he accused Moses I'm starting to church himself with his own with his own thoughts and Moses the Bible said most in it didn't blast him Moses fell on his face Moses started interceding Moses said have mercy is that how we feel Church where people speak against us we should plead for mercy we should go right to our knees in there so see he had his twins as well Balaam saw visions how these supernatural events and all these things like that but he sold out God for money chloro as well God God can use anybody God can use any of us and he was fighting against the real priesthood so be careful let's not fight against brother branham grace god we don't know he's a human we all know he made mistakes but he never made a mistake with us save the lord and identify and that's the spirit we see live today is worshiping mother granny so let's not worship brother Branham well we can't do without it because he's one of them he's the star he's the star for our day we can't do without it all right now let's play let's try to go quickly here I got about 20 minutes okay that's plenty time all right never to see this round the serpent so far hope this isn't too much of review but I just want to bridge this I felt inspired I saw a couple of witnesses hope it's okay by God's grace trust your being will that seen it now Matthew 3 verse 7 let's read that Matthew 3% I'm going to skip the Old Testament I had a few more by kya and it has prophets and Jess about but I kind of been preaching on those lately with the Jezebel and the Turk ages and Thyatira I kind of preach on that recently let's go to matthew 3:7 matthew 3:7 never like to read that for me okay when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism he said to them o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come they've had because of a bunch of snakes Graham said what kind of preachers manners is that right and we all want to pass through so or preachers so gentle and so kind but look at the spirit of lines in the spirit Elijah didn't pull any punches it's exactly right he called you generation of vipers he said bring forth fruits worthy of repentance in the next verse and the Bible said they wouldn't be baptized in John's baptism so they would come and watch the services in the message church and see the people repent get baptized but they themselves wouldn't enter in they would never leave their denomination to come all the way up god help us and sell lock stock and barrel amen he's helped us to do that praise God to sell out any connection and be fully committed a message of the hour praise God but these generation of vipers didn't do that they just came to watch and see huh that's interesting the sisters wear their hair like dad two brothers they wear clothes like that that's interesting but we just can't be a part of it Oh yellow-bellied Oh you generation of I four right Oh like the Bible said bring forth fruits worthy of repentance praise God while there's time seek God why he may be found amen he said the axe is laid to the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire his preaching just come right down didn't come right the helmet show them exactly where they were amen now Jesus and Judas mother have said this in 1962 Sardis church change which I was listen to this this week brother Randy said Judas was the son of Satan notice if you believe that the Bible said he was the son of perdition remember that is John 17 12 he was the son of perdition perdition means destruction so destruction had a son it was pinion mother have said it was Satan incarnate in Judas right and northern a they're both twins they're brother branham said judas killed jesus at the altar just like cain killed abel at the altar look Sam I'm Graham said both of them killed the other one right there and both of course had the spirit of murder on them because Satan fully possessed Judas and filled him just like Satan possessed Cain Cain was actually the genetic seed of the serpent but also of course have the wrong annoyed key because his County has changed the evil spirit came upon him and his countenance changed towards the Word of God that's right now these are some ones you might not been as familiar with but let's just hit a few more here by the grace of Lord in acts 13 a let's go there acts 13 8 look at this beast slithering through the Bible say me what's the oyster tact he's always talking God's Word he's always talking to God his ministry he's always acting God's people he always won't line up with the four Word of God ah he's that make believer deceiver acts 13 8 now Paul this is Paul speaking to a Unitas the sorcerer let's go to verse 10 and said O full of all subtlety in all Bishop not Chadha the devil now enemy of all righteousness will now not search cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord now what was he doing he was just trying to get the coppersmith was it or the deputy I'm sorry he was just trying to get the deputy not to hear the preaching applause see that so now we see the Satan the Antichrist spirit just tries to keep people from hearing plain preaching the preaching of the message the hour that could be called the spirit of Satan don't go to that church don't go that stay away from brother Jesse I've had people tell me that I mean literally tell me that the churches have said stay away from him oh and I just laugh cuz under some burden you know buddy but it also shows I'm one of them one of those real believers right stay away from that church do evil things all they'll tell lies on you they'll do all these things like that but what do we preacher we're preaching the word of righteousness and holiness godliness and we're not just our thoughts as we've been saying we've got stuff saith Jesus Christ amen thus saith the Lord Jesus Christ is Lord that's something we're making up or a trap promoter own church or something like that we're promoting the kingdom of God amen so I'm glad to be one of them praise God but anybody that will keep you for me just hearing the word of God the prophet of the hour Paul says was a child of the devil and he had blindness first season right Paul also battled a few more let's go to Philippians 3 for the flippy industry here's another way looking is 3 okay when I say flipping the three I think I've said 19 I didn't say that department here the penis 3:19 this one kind of came to my heart as I was preparing flipping it's 3:19 I'm sorry but I didn't look I thought well I'm sure he'll be there forgive me but forgive me I feel bad that's up let's put verse 17 flip means 3:17 I'm sorry but rather be followers together me and mark them which walk so as you had us for an example so really marked oh brother really walked the gospel make sure they live the gospel verse 18 where many block of whom I opposed often and not tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ see if people are not the preachers are not walking just like Paul walk something's wrong with them well because Paul says they're walking but they're actually our enemies they look like they're walking for Christ verse 9 tells us whose end is destruction just like Judas he's set up destruction so preachers going to try to us into walking after Christ their end is destruction verse 19 whose God is their belly so what are they ultimately worship money right money to get the things you want to feed yourself that's who they're real goddess prince authority that's their God who's their God themselves they become their own God because that's what sickens idea is to make himself God so he makes death their own God so see pardon walk that way he wasn't his own God Paulo through hardships Paul sacrifice for the people praise God a human you know since he wasn't worshiping his own belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things so these false preachers had more concern about the earthly things than heavenly like we said popularity big churches big money oh mercy the love of money is the root of all evil they love money more than anything else God mercy both the givers 24-hour conversation is in heaven we're thinking about going to have been thinking about treasures in heaven alright that's a good one you like that one I thought that no you can see a preacher see that's why with these TV preachers always be careful I don't know I don't even listen to him because I know the money behind it right you just be very care they might have marital things like that i buy most of our blinds at the blind foul the blind now next one okay second Timothy to this withers okay 70 to 79 Lou this I just want to bring this thought out the trail of the circuit look out there look just like a needy saw they sold it out for what their belly see that they sold it out Judas everybody just sold out for money watch that money no that's where the money goes they met watch where the money goes second Timothy 2:17 now I preached on this last year cankering verse 17 and there what word will eat as Duff a canker of whom is hymenaeus and philetus who concerning the truth have erred say that the resurrection has passed already and overthrow the faith of son these creatures were we'd say only saying that the resurrections already happened the raptures are connected and we're the Millennium right that's what some people believe today some people the message and some Catholics believe that that's what they believe they're not looking for the second coming of Christ I think you like they're already they're there because their kingdoms already on the earth but see but what the Bible said this kind of preaching eats like a canker the disease that will eat you all up one false doctrine will eat somebody all up see how we got to have true true time study yourself approved right the Bible said approve them to who God so when I preach something it should be such the Word of God that I know gobbling back it up amen I just animal saying that or sister bow a brother or sister do it that's not what I'm not trying to get all of you to agree with I hope you will but I want God to agree with amen I've got two or three witnesses I've got this to back me up because that's how you rightly divide the word amen three witnesses every word to be established and then these eleven years I by God's grace have appreciated foolish doctrine have I if I have meeting after service and let me know as far as I know never let anybody into sin never purposely told them to go to sin we tried to keep it right with the Word of God right now let's look at this one here there's a couple more okay second Peter 2 Peter 2 verse 19 actually let's go to 18 second Peter 2 18 all right I got that eight minutes that's plenty time I think I'll kill you I'm swinging the highlights I may finish this next week or maybe not I think everybody can see the idea can't you all see the end of Satan you can just track him all the way through the Bible it's a lot of the same characteristics and how does this apply to us we don't want to act like that we don't want to fall in those three Trados those three temptations we want to live above that and a man because there's greater power to us it's the Holy Ghost but it's all for my been wanting to spend four hours I'm just gonna preach 1 hour on it I could easily preach hours and hours on this if you went and read every scripture easily and there's something I left out like Zechariah you know Satan standing there right by Josh for the hikers remember that in Zechariah but God silences Satan and said Joshua's confess his sin give him new clothes amen and put on the garments of right God's forgiven him and they're saving time so he said who stands there tries to resist God's cleansing agents although we receive God's funding we receive God's forgiveness we received the white robes amen and righteousness forgiveness amen only gonna say men forgiveness of sins hallelujah amen look at verse 18 I preached on this one time maybe some people are here verse 18 for when they speak great swelling words of vanity see their preaching his soul is so swelling it's so great but they actually a lure through the lusts of the flesh so they preach such amazing words they say such amazing words but it's actually trying to lure you or attract to buy it lusts of the flesh so you can give your flesh when it wants like what does that mean it means like you can marry two or three or four times or you can buy that Mercedes Benz choice 1 right so you give it to the poor or you can do all this they preach says Oh God love you so much as the prosperity gospel right God loves you so much he wants you to have the best you want you to have the best spiritual riches amen how many spiritual riches is what he wants right because that's later see if you're rich and increased with Goods and you think you have me - nothing but you're blind rich I'm sorry you're blind wretched and poor and naked all these things and no one cannot see you so very be very careful now how do they allure through much one time that's that's laziness see that's not being diligent about keeping the word they don't put any effort oh just relax there's no need to sacrifice more for God you can just be one time just built your spiritual life slide a little bit after these great swelling words do see those that were clean escaped from them who live in error so see a clean person will escape that how the preacher my livers 19th is what I want to get to while they promise them Liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption so the very preachers who are saying God's giving you promises down getting your promises they're the same ones that are slaves to sin they cannot overcome sin they keep living in sin I'm glad to say over and I know you're glad you ever comes in that's one mark of a real Christian Church we're not slaves to sin and we don't promise things and not reach them we promise God's Word and if you've got faith you'll reach it how do they go like a trailer you wait 25 years you don't reach it eventually see them Abraham just keep hanging on the God's Word amen don't give up but see if they will never reach it they'll still be servants to their sins and the lusts of their flesh I hope you can see that church hope you can see that alright I got five minutes okay next slide let me this is my last slide now I know this is a lot of words I haven't time to really go through a ten but I want to focus on this right here then it's a satan's path the last 2,000 years we've already preached up to here so this so ah they weren't familiar with most of this so here you have the seven churches here's the seven turn chase down here you have the length and the messengers on here is this pretty familiar I would think it's pretty okay and here's the annoying things of the Holy Ghost a line anointing versus the white horse rider the accent I think and look there overlap programs that they overlap by a few years right the church ages and at certain years but but the anointings overlap Oxendine Kings sacrificed so you have lion baldness power of the Apostles and you have the Ox anointing sacrifice and you have the man jointing the intellectual and wisdom of the Holy Spirit to know right from wrong and now we got the Eagle 19 fly above all denominations and all Creed's well look now Satan work he started off with deeds it wasn't a teaching it was just such a tradition everybody did that was the beast in the beginning of the church ages then he had the synagogue of Satan then he had his own churches remember that he literally moved to a church became a church then they United church and state this is Constantine oh I'm sorry I mean hit the help TV like that sorry he married Church and stay in that he do it Balaam did he tried to unite the church with sinners and he did that and then the doctrine of the Nicolaitans they conquered the lazy by making all the priests the holy men but you're just as holy has any preachers don't let anybody tell you they're not unless you're not bored together you're bored again you're just as holy as any holy ghost of region eight and you've got just as much right to operate in your gift administering the Holy Spirit as a preacher done don't anybody conquer you because the Holy Ghost wants to use you and the Holy Ghost wants to conquer safe today how do we get raised up I'm not the only one that's anointed if you're born again you're fully anointed a need to operate our ministries in I want to say conquer this church I can't let that happen none of us other than happen and then for almost a thousand years 914 years Jezebel had a stranglehold upon most of the church now a woman who calls herself a prophetess right teaching Sue's My servants to commit fornication to worship idols so she should be came to a real powerful church and then they were living in the name of deficit the a just where we're getting to next Lord really I still feel let me go in back days a Martin Luther the true church was trying to hang on they had a name they're trying to be Christians but they weren't living the life so just a game a church membership right Church strikers and now this one I don't not polish up on that I don't remember that one so I don't match you might know if he's ready he might know that prepared me it's gonna last as I read nightmare but I'm still in this chapter I go to church in foot and we all know lukewarm we all know that right you're not hot for Jesus not cold but you're lukewarm and you feel like I don't have nothing anymore of God God loves me I'm all forgiving he does love you you can be forgiven but we must recognize you need more of God we need him every hour as the enemy comes in like a flood we need to stand there that's higher than him and the way we do it is draw nigh to God he draws nigh unto you there's only one way to go to God for us right so this is Satan this is Satan slithering not just a slippery there Satan slithering but the real believer has the anointing and a flying above it today we'll fly the bug and the trail of the serpent today love the Lord just not enough time Church and I'm gonna wear you out I know them I appreciate you sitting through this a lot of things you maybe heard before I just want to bring these this felt burn to preach this here tonight let me just go a few more here now what I have on here is AI from Jude Jude Jude calls out all the false preachers and then I got the whole book of Revelation the Beast of Revelation the woman tried to the beast right oh my and then you have the old serpent the see we see that serpent at the end in Revelation chapter 12 what she what's he trying to do he's trying to kill the Jews because the bride is already gone she was gonna the Beast was gonna hop on the bride right but Christ rescued his bride he sees her he snatched her out and the moment the other die snatched her early before Satan again could pounce on the bride so we had what does he do he goes after the next group the Jews and the fight will call him that old serpent Satan that deceives the whole world and then I was going to go brother mandersohn how does he head out over that quote how does he head up he heads up in the enter Christ and Sunday night he would just finish it in Daniel chapter 12 we saw all those other scriptures about the Antichrist he his policy his government would cause craft to prosper remember that he magnify himself by peace he destroyed many is what this is what this beast was gonna do at the end he's going to overspread the Roman abomination in the Jewish temple he's going to cut off the daily sacrifice in the Jewish temple he's a vile person he takes the kingdom by flatteries or lies right making you feel good when he's lying to you he speaks against the holy God the Bible said he enters the holy land he scatters the power of the holy people by the break of their covenant and that's what Satan does at the end that's how he heads up but I'm so glad he's locked away during the Millennium he gets out one more time but I'm so glad God here said his fired off in heaven and destroys him and his and his armies or his armies are the nation's during the Millennium he gathers all the nations that are outside them the temple and brings them in against the camp of God and God sets fire right there down around Jerusalem burns up Satan and that's where the beasts necks aren't you glad and God takes a flea castle in the lake of fire right there right before the white from judgment you love the Lord tonight and I understand our feet by God's grace I couldn't get to everything but I just I just want to finish tonight that's okay can I finish that thought sure truly we can recognize the trail of the serpent truly we can see that now let me say this as you follow the close of this as you follow the path of the circuit once you see shedding blood shedding blood killing killing selfishness selfish but what do you see the truth where do you see the of the true believer you see the true believer shedding the blood as a sacrifice giving of themselves as a sacrifice surrendering to all the Word of God obeying the Word of God being attacked and not fighting back right so if you follow the trail the serpent you'll see his characteristics but if you follow the bloody footprints of Christ you'll see a life that's lived and sacrificed for any man it's not a selfish life it's a life of continual sacrifice for the glory of God on the ground and said this is the sardian Church sermon he said that the Catholic Church shed the blood of all the saints and that's the scripture brother Branham said someday I'll give my life for that he said because this nation was coming down against anyone who fights against the churches and Catholics he said someday he'd give his life for it now he didn't live to see that of a church what if we're the generation program said be willing to stand up against that spirit be willing to stand up against that beast and he said if you have to mingle your blood like in the prophets of old because that spirit wants to destroying Hill believers but the real believer gives our life as it offered a fast that last thing Graham said he saw a vision that starter Jake well Graham saw he said he saw a vision of the Pentecostal church he said it was a cat have you heard that sermon and he makes it something that makes it something as the RAM walked over and he saw a cat and the vision and there's a sign behind the cabinets and Pentecostal churches Lorenzen why he said oh this is a cute kitty and he said he said he's stroking the kitty stroking the kitty and he said the boy said now go the other way stroke him the other way and he said watch when he turns into mother Graham said the whole time he was fed him the way with his fur goes brother Graham said this was a vision of evangelist visions never failed Clemente took his hand and Stroke the opposite way he said that capture him so huge monster he said it's green eyes bulged on atoms and was going to try to kill him and brother Ram said that's what happened when you tell somebody they're Trinity doctrines of the devil that's one way to know if somebody has the wrong spirit on them and they're actually going to fight you instead of being happy for you you tell them something that's wrong you tell them this wrong you talk you said you tell your baptism is wrong and this he said if they reared up and fight you then they got the wrong spirit in church one day it may come down that for us it may not be male 11 our Paterno raised up and all these things like that will go down to the grave but at some point it's gonna happen to somebody that was a vision I have to say that that's what I want to say that this is the beast we're gonna see in the end it was the it was the churches it was a Pentecostal Church that seemed to have an anointing on them right it's gonna be so close good to see they're very elected if it were possible how many willing to stand on the truth of God no matter who hates em no matter who loves him/her today in the ground said you're gonna have to given a lot of you may have to give your love for that he thought he would have to give his life for that he didn't have to but that's how you'll see the spirit behind someone telling this is the absolute truth I believe this to be the state the Lord and watch their reaction aren't you glad that when someone told you that you could say Amen to it or you could say well let me go let me have a Bible again the true church will discern the two spirits within the framework of the church praise God we'll see the trailer circuit but we'll also see the bloody footprints of our Lord Jesus Christ and we'll follow him praise God
