[2:10] Lord Jesus, thank you so much for your
[2:12] mercies, Lord, and your grace. And uh we
[2:14] we sure need it, Lord. Every day, every
[2:16] hour, Lord, we need thee. As the song
[2:18] says, I need thee. Oh, I need thee,
[2:20] Lord. Lord, no matter where we go, Lord,
[2:22] when we're in the house, we need you,
[2:24] Lord. When we when we go to Walmart, we
[2:26] need you, Lord. There's so much evil
[2:28] around that no matter where you go, you
[2:30] just run into evil here and evil there
[2:32] and just wickedness, Lord. And we thank
[2:35] you for bringing us out of wickedness,
[2:37] Father, out of sin. And Lord, we pray
[2:39] that you continue to be gracious to us.
[2:41] And may your presence be about us, guard
[2:43] our hearts, Lord, always. And and may we
[2:45] be fully clothed with the armor of light
[2:48] upon us, Father. And taking the sword of
[2:50] the spirit, the word, and the shield of
[2:52] faith that we can quench all the fiery
[2:54] darts of the wicked. Amen. We thank you,
[2:56] Lord. And we ask now that you'd
[2:58] encourage us, build us up in your
[2:59] scripture, Lord, in your word, and teach
[3:01] us. May everything fall exactly into
[3:03] place, Lord, how your spirit intends.
[3:05] May you have full work and full uh
[3:07] authority here this evening, Father, or
[3:09] this afternoon. Uh just desiring that
[3:12] your name to be glorified, Father, and
[3:15] uh that we would leave here better and
[3:17] closer to the Lord and and uh with more
[3:19] fervor to serve you than ever before,
[3:21] Lord God. We just pray you'd renew us in
[3:23] our spirit, Lord. And uh and give us
[3:25] grace. Help us to be gracious, Lord. For

[3:46] uh we just desire to serve you better.
[3:48] We ask you to help us in Jesus Christ's
[3:50] name. Amen.
[3:52] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. Amen. We'll be reading
[3:54] from uh Isaiah 55 and starting at verse
[3:57] nine here.
[3:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We sure appreciate the word of the
[4:01] Lord.
[4:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:04] Uh verse nine, for as the heavens are
[4:07] higher than the earth, so are my ways
[4:10] higher than your ways, and my thoughts
[4:13] than your thoughts.
[4:15] For as the rain cometh down, and the
[4:18] snow from heaven, and returnneeth not
[4:20] thither, but waterth the earth, and
[4:23] maketh it bring forth fruit, or bringeth
[4:26] bring forth and bud, that it may give
[4:29] seed to the sewer, and bread to the
[4:30] eater. So shall my word be that goeth
[4:34] forth out of my mouth. It shall not
[4:36] return unto me void, but it shall
[4:38] accomplish that which I please, and it
[4:41] shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[4:43] send it. Amen. May the Lord bless his
[4:45] word. You can be seated.
[4:49] Amen. We I I always enjoy reading this
[4:53] scripture because it it gives us courage
[4:56] and faith in the word of the Lord that
[4:58] everything the Lord has spoken. Amen.
[5:01] and uh purposed. It's for a reason. It's
[5:03] to accomplish something. Amen. Just the
[5:06] the same way that he he created the rain
[5:09] and the dew um and and the the
[5:12] precipitation, you know, to water the
[5:13] earth, you know, the Lord put in place
[5:16] uh systems and and uh seasons and times
[5:20] and everything in the earth. Um but he
[5:23] also established heavenly seasons and
[5:26] spiritual you know times and um events
[5:30] that would unfold in their seasons and
[5:32] and he sent his word always to to
[5:34] accomplish something. Amen. Always he
[5:37] revealed his word to somebody on the
[5:39] earth um as a witness and it was always
[5:42] to prepare for something or or to to
[5:45] share something with God's people. Amen.
[5:48] &gt;&gt; So he says so shall my word be. Just
[5:50] like the like he sends the rain upon the
[5:52] earth uh in its season to bring forth
[5:54] the seeds that have been laying there.
[5:56] Uh so he sends forth his word. Amen. To
[5:59] to to us to bring forth uh his fruit in
[6:02] his people. Amen.
[6:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:04] &gt;&gt; So praise the Lord. Um he he always has
[6:06] a a set time in his mind uh for his word
[6:09] to be fulfilled, revealed. And that's
[6:11] our our our title again is the time for
[6:13] revelation. The Lord always has a time
[6:16] um that that it's always in the right
[6:19] time. Amen. to reveal his word, to send
[6:21] his word to his people
[6:23] &gt;&gt; upon the earth. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[6:25] Um, but he always speaks in order for
[6:27] something to be accomplished. Amen. And,
[6:29] uh, I want to read Luke chapter 18 here
[6:33] and, uh, starting at the 31st verse,
[6:38] it says, "Then he took unto him the 12."
[6:41] Jesus did took unto him the 12 and said
[6:44] unto them, "Behold, uh, we go up to
[6:48] Jerusalem, and all things that are
[6:50] written by the prophets concerning the
[6:52] son of man shall be accomplished."
[6:54] And he he's telling them very
[6:56] specifically um what they are preparing
[6:58] to do and what is about to happen
[7:02] that all things that were written by the
[7:03] prophets that remember they spake and
[7:05] and wrote by the inspiration of the Holy
[7:07] Ghost as they were moved by the Holy
[7:08] Ghost
[7:10] for he verse 32 he shall be delivered
[7:14] unto the Gentiles.
[7:16] He shall be mocked and spitefully
[7:18] entreated and spitted on and he and they
[7:22] shall scourge him and put him to death.
[7:25] He he he used very plain language here.
[7:27] Amen. And the third day he shall rise
[7:30] again.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; So he told them in detail the things
[7:34] that were to be. Amen. The things that
[7:36] were coming. But look what we find in
[7:38] the 34th verse here. They understood
[7:42] none of these things. And this saying
[7:44] was hid from them. Neither knew they the
[7:48] things which were spoken. Amen. So even
[7:51] though Jesus was plainly telling them,
[7:53] I'm going to be crucified. I'm going to
[7:55] be killed. I'm going to be delivered up
[7:56] to the Gentiles. And according to the
[7:58] scriptures, they're going to put the Son
[8:00] of Man to death.
[8:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And maybe they, you know, of
[8:05] course, it was hid from them. So maybe
[8:07] they just thought that he was speaking
[8:09] in parables or or something or um they
[8:13] just couldn't
[8:15] grasp um what exactly he was saying that
[8:18] he was going to die. But he also tells
[8:21] them that he on the third day he's going
[8:23] to rise again. He also tells them I'm
[8:25] I'm going to raise again. Amen.
[8:28] &gt;&gt; And uh and they had heard him say before
[8:30] destroy this temple and in three days
[8:32] I'll raise it up again. Amen.
[8:34] and but they just they didn't understand
[8:36] it because it wasn't yet time for them
[8:37] to receive it. Amen. But it was for a
[8:40] purpose. Uh it may be that if they would
[8:42] have all understood it was going to
[8:43] happen, maybe they would have tried to
[8:46] uh do something on their own to to
[8:48] change it to to prevent him from dying
[8:50] or something and the Lord couldn't allow
[8:51] that because it had to happen. We you
[8:53] know, we don't know. But it was hid from
[8:56] them. That's what we do know. They they
[8:57] just couldn't. They understood none of
[8:59] these things. the scripture says.
[9:01] &gt;&gt; And then uh let's go to Luke chapter 24
[9:04] here
[9:11] and we'll start in the first verse.
[9:16] Praise the Lord. This is the the
[9:17] resurrection here.
[9:20] Now upon the first day of the week, very
[9:23] early in the morning, they came unto the
[9:25] sephiler, bringing the spices which they
[9:28] had prepared, and certain others with
[9:30] them. And they found the stone rolled
[9:33] away from the sephiler.
[9:36] And they entered in, and found not the
[9:38] body of the Lord Jesus. And it came to
[9:40] pass, as they were much perplexed, Amen.
[9:44] thereabout, behold, two men stood by
[9:46] them in shining garments. So they came
[9:50] being the first day of the week, this
[9:51] was the the third day since he had been
[9:54] crucified. Uh they came and didn't find
[9:58] him and were perplexed. But remember, if
[10:00] the if it wasn't hid from them what
[10:02] Jesus had said, then they would have
[10:04] known when they went there. We shouldn't
[10:06] find him in there because he said he
[10:08] would raise again the third day.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it surprised them. It
[10:11] perplexed them. They didn't understand.
[10:13] It was still hid from them. Amen.
[10:17] And then uh verse five. Uh so then there
[10:20] was angels that appeared to them, two
[10:22] two men in shining garments. And as they
[10:24] were afraid and bowed down their faces
[10:26] to the earth, they said unto them, "Why
[10:29] seek ye the living among the dead?"
[10:31] Amen.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; He is not here, but is risen. Amen.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; Remember how he spake unto you when he
[10:37] was yet in Galilee, saying, "The son of
[10:41] man must be delivered into the hands of
[10:43] sinful men and be crucified and the
[10:45] third day rise again." And they
[10:48] remembered his words. Amen. So the the
[10:50] angels had to come and bring to
[10:51] remembrance the things that Jesus has
[10:53] said. Amen. His words.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. How he told them he's I'm going to
[10:57] be put to death according to the
[10:59] scripture and and on the third day I'll
[11:01] raise again according to the scripture.
[11:02] Amen.
[11:04] So uh and and they returned verse 9 from
[11:07] the sephiler and told all these things
[11:10] unto the 11 and to all the rest.
[11:14] It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and
[11:16] Mary the mother of James and other women
[11:18] that were with them which told these
[11:21] things unto the apostles and their words
[11:23] seemed to to them as idol tales and they
[11:27] believed them not.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. is that's amazing that they
[11:33] knowing what Jesus had already said and
[11:36] and seeing the fulfillment of it, they
[11:38] still couldn't believe that that it had
[11:41] happened because we know it was hid from
[11:43] them. Amen. Their their their eyes were
[11:44] holding. Amen.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; But if it wouldn't have been, then then
[11:48] they would have seen right away. Ah yes,
[11:50] that that that must be because that's
[11:52] exactly what he said would happen. Amen.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But it but it was hid
[11:56] from them. Amen. And it's hard for us to
[11:57] understand, but until the Lord allows
[11:59] something to be revealed, then it'll be
[12:01] revealed. Amen.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; So then arose Peter and ran to the
[12:07] sephiler and stooping down, he beheld
[12:09] the linen clothes laid by themselves and
[12:11] departed wondering in himself at that
[12:14] which was come to pass. Amen. So he was
[12:16] still he was still wondering about all
[12:17] this. He didn't understand any of these
[12:19] things. And behold, two of them uh went
[12:23] that same day to a village called Emmas,
[12:26] which was from Jerusalem about three
[12:28] score furlongs.
[12:30] And they talked together of all these
[12:32] things which had happened. And it came
[12:34] to pass that while they communed
[12:36] together in reason, Jesus himself drew
[12:39] near and went with him. Amen. There's uh
[12:42] this is one of my favorite stories, I
[12:43] think, in the New Testament. And and
[12:44] there's so much to glean just from the
[12:46] from the road to Emmas here. And there
[12:48] there's so much. We'll try to try to
[12:51] just stay on track here, but you could
[12:52] probably get a a hundred different
[12:54] sermons out of just this passage,
[12:55] brother. You know, and um there's a lot
[12:57] there. But praise the Lord. Um and it
[13:00] came to pass. Yes. Uh Jesus himself drew
[13:03] near and went with them. Amen. I love
[13:06] that. Jesus himself, he he came to where
[13:08] they were communing about him.
[13:11] &gt;&gt; But their eyes were holden that they
[13:13] should not know him. So to them, it was
[13:16] a stranger. They didn't they didn't
[13:17] recognize him because their eyes were
[13:19] actually holding.
[13:22] And he said unto them, "What manner of
[13:24] communications are these that you have
[13:26] one to another as you walk and are sad?"
[13:30] And the one of them whose name was
[13:32] Cleopus uh answering said unto him, "Art
[13:34] thou only a stranger in Jerusalem? Hast
[13:37] thou not known the things which are come
[13:38] to pass in these days?"
[13:42] Amen. If anybody knew, this stranger
[13:44] knew. Amen.
[13:46] He said, "But you don't know what's
[13:48] happened." And he said unto them, "What
[13:51] things?"
[13:52] And they said unto him, "Concerning
[13:55] Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet,
[13:57] mighty indeed and word before God and
[13:59] all the people." See, they they still
[14:02] there's still something in their heart,
[14:03] still believed on him, even though they
[14:05] didn't understand it, right?
[14:07] &gt;&gt; But something in there, they still knew
[14:09] he was a prophet. And this was still
[14:11] their testimony about Jesus. Amen. That
[14:13] they didn't understand. Um but they knew
[14:16] he was a prophet mighty in deed and word
[14:18] before God and all the people and how
[14:20] the chief priests and el and our rulers
[14:23] delivered him to be condemned to death
[14:25] and have crucified him. But we trusted
[14:28] that it had been he which should have
[14:30] redeemed Israel. And beside all this,
[14:33] today is the third day since these
[14:35] things were done. Amen. They they kn
[14:37] they knew it was the third day, but they
[14:39] they had forgotten what Jesus said would
[14:42] happen on the third day.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus told them plainly what
[14:45] would happen.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. But yay uh and and certain women
[14:49] also of our company made us astonished
[14:52] which were early at the sephiler. And
[14:54] when they found not his body uh they
[14:56] came saying that they had also seen a
[14:59] vision of angels
[15:02] which said that he was alive. Amen. And
[15:05] certain of them which were with us went
[15:07] to the sephiler and found it even as the
[15:09] women had said. But him they saw not.
[15:13] Praise the Lord. Is it's again it's hard
[15:14] for us to understand that like why are
[15:16] they so surprised? Why are they
[15:17] astonished? Why do they doubt? Why do
[15:19] they wonder,
[15:20] &gt;&gt; you know, but but you got to remember it
[15:22] was hid from them. There was you could
[15:24] put it this way, there was a veil over
[15:26] their eyes until the time uh that Jesus
[15:29] wanted to be revealed.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; Um but then he said unto them, verse 25,
[15:34] "Oh fools." Amen. I I didn't realize
[15:36] this until just in the office this
[15:38] morning. We heard God call somebody a
[15:40] fool. remember because because he laid
[15:42] up his treasures on earth and not in
[15:43] heaven. And um I didn't even realize
[15:46] that until just a little bit ago. And
[15:48] but Jesus calls them fools because he
[15:51] says and slow of heart to believe all
[15:53] that the prophets have spoken.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; So remember, not only did Jesus uh
[15:58] blatantly expound what was going to
[16:00] happen, but also all the law and the
[16:03] prophets foretold of it as well. Amen.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; In types and shadows. Um but but it was
[16:10] all speaking of him.
[16:14] Ought not Christ to have suffered these
[16:16] things and to enter into his glory? And
[16:20] beginning at Moses and all the prophets,
[16:22] he expounded unto them all the
[16:23] scriptures, the things concerning
[16:25] himself. Amen. That's that's my desire
[16:27] when we come to church. Amen. That that
[16:29] he'll expound to us all the scriptures
[16:31] concerning himself. Amen.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; That's what that's what we want, Lord.
[16:34] Amen. Grant it. And and when and they
[16:37] drew nigh unto the village uh thither
[16:40] they went and he made as though he would
[16:42] have gone further.
[16:47] Amen. But they constrained him, saying,
[16:50] "Abide with us, for it is toward
[16:52] evening, and the day is far spent." And
[16:55] he went in to tarry with them.
[16:58] And it came to pass as he sat at meat
[17:00] with them, he took bread and blessed it,
[17:03] and broke it and gave it to them. Amen.
[17:05] And their eyes were open and they knew
[17:07] him and he vanished out of their sight.
[17:10] Amen. Don't you you just want Jesus to
[17:12] terry with you and and stay with you
[17:13] until you understand. Amen. Just just be
[17:16] patient with us, Lord, until our eyes
[17:17] are opened. Amen.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us. He He understands. He
[17:21] knoweth our frame. Amen. He He remembers
[17:23] that we are but dust. Amen.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just just t with us,
[17:27] Lord, and open our eyes. Amen.
[17:31] And they said one to another, "Didn't
[17:33] not our heart burn within us while he
[17:35] talked with us by the way? And when he
[17:37] opened us the scriptures?" Amen. I I
[17:39] love that. And they rose up the same
[17:41] hour and returned to Jerusalem and found
[17:44] the 11 gathered there gathered together
[17:47] and them that were with them, saying,
[17:49] "The Lord is risen indeed and hath
[17:51] appeared to Simon." And they told what
[17:54] things were done in the way, and how he
[17:56] was known of them in breaking of bread.
[18:00] And as they thus spake, Jesus himself
[18:03] stood in the midst of them and say saith
[18:05] unto them, peace be unto you. Amen. But
[18:09] they were terrified and afrighted and
[18:12] supposed that they had seen a spirit.
[18:14] They they just they thought they were
[18:15] seeing things. I mean after hearing uh
[18:18] the women had come back telling them
[18:19] that the seelicore was empty and then
[18:21] angels told him he was risen and then
[18:22] the two disciples um had just told them
[18:26] he is risen indeed. Amen. and appeared
[18:29] to Simon and Cleopus and then um not
[18:32] only so what the Lord Jesus himself had
[18:34] told them it would happen. Amen. But but
[18:36] now they were terrified and afrighted
[18:38] and and didn't believe what they were
[18:40] seeing. Amen.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, just open our eyes. Amen.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; Only believe. Lord, help our unbelief.
[18:47] Amen.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; And he he said unto them. Verse 38, why
[18:51] are you troubled? And why do thoughts
[18:54] arise in your hearts? Amen. Why do we
[18:56] get so troubled, brothers and sisters,
[18:58] seeing the the things that are happening
[18:59] in the world. Amen. Seeing the the
[19:02] manifestation of prophecies and uh from
[19:05] the things that have been told from the
[19:06] beginning that we we we ought to be
[19:08] expecting. But when we see things in the
[19:10] in the news and and politics and and and
[19:13] government and world events and they
[19:15] they scare people, you know, even even
[19:17] message believers, it it scares them
[19:19] sometimes. It sometimes it almost
[19:21] baffles me how they how worked up people
[19:23] get. believers get get worked up over
[19:25] things that are happening like like we
[19:27] didn't know it was going to come. Amen.
[19:30] But but he said, "Why are you troubled?
[19:32] And why do thoughts arise in your
[19:34] hearts?" Amen. Thoughts come up and and
[19:36] and they they make people anxious and
[19:39] troubled and and they they begin to
[19:41] worry and fear.
[19:43] Amen. Uh with with things happening all
[19:45] over the world and people don't know
[19:46] what's happening. They don't know what
[19:47] to believe. They don't know what's going
[19:49] to happen next. You know, people are
[19:51] lying to them in the media and and all
[19:53] over and they they just thoughts arise
[19:56] in their hearts. Amen. Even believers.
[19:59] Amen. But they but they need to they
[20:01] need to get reggrounded. Amen.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; In the word and and and and realize in
[20:05] whom they have believed. Amen.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But but remember um the
[20:11] things we see happening and and and um a
[20:14] lot of people are stumbling because of
[20:17] how they see people falling away from
[20:18] the message. But remember the scripture
[20:21] says that they shall not come except
[20:23] there be a falling away first. Amen. So
[20:26] Jesus also tells us through the
[20:27] scripture, you know, through his
[20:29] servants that these things are to be.
[20:31] Amen. They will happen. Amen.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; And don't let it surprise us. Amen. Let
[20:36] let not your heart be troubled. Amen.
[20:38] Don't let don't let thoughts arise in
[20:40] your heart,
[20:41] &gt;&gt; you know, doubtful thoughts. Amen.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But in this day, amen,
[20:46] the the the revelation of Jesus Christ
[20:49] is unveiled. Amen. This is the the the
[20:52] time for revelation. Amen.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is the day when the son of man
[20:58] is revealed. Praise the Lord. We saw it
[21:00] through through the message he gave to
[21:02] brother Brandham. Amen. For us, the
[21:04] revelation of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[21:06] Through the through the church ages and
[21:08] through the seals. Amen. The the mystery
[21:10] of God should be finished.
[21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. That is the that
[21:15] is the revealing of the son of man.
[21:17] Amen. Praise God.
[21:20] So uh and and
[21:22] again a lot of people I I talk to and
[21:25] and um people we all know I'm sure and
[21:29] and probably have struggled with
[21:30] ourselves seeing people fall away um
[21:34] that have they were in the message you
[21:35] know 10 years 20 years 30 years 50 years
[21:38] even and and more
[21:40] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden they just drop away
[21:44] and it really hurts a lot of people.
[21:46] It's it's it's hard to see, you know,
[21:50] and I'm I'm sure all of us know people
[21:53] dear to us and or know of people that
[21:56] that um we never would have thought
[21:58] would have fallen away from the message.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; Um and
[22:02] and and they do. Amen. And and it's a
[22:05] hard thing, but remember, it was told
[22:07] that it would happen that way.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; Good.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; The day cannot come except the there be
[22:12] a falling away first. Amen. And that man
[22:15] of sin be revealed. Amen. Which we know
[22:17] to be the the Antichrist, but that's a
[22:18] whole another message. And I I'll leave
[22:20] that one to brother Jesse. Praise the
[22:21] Lord. He's he's good at getting into all
[22:24] the deep things. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[22:26] But don't let your heart be troubled.
[22:28] Amen. All the the thoughts that when you
[22:30] when you see on the news something
[22:31] happening, you think what's going to h
[22:33] you know what's going to happen?
[22:34] Thoughts arise in your heart. Don't let
[22:36] that happen. You know, cast down the
[22:38] imaginations. Amen.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; Just think the thoughts of God. Amen.
[22:43] Amen.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; We know these things must happen,
[22:47] brothers and sisters. But but we know
[22:49] there's going to be a resurrection, too.
[22:50] Amen.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord sent a prophet and told
[22:54] us the things that are to be. Amen. He
[22:56] he he told us, "Don't be surprised when
[22:58] things when these things happen. The
[23:00] world will be totally insane, you know,
[23:02] and uh and and and told us how it would
[23:04] be." And it's exactly the way the Lord
[23:07] told him it would be. That's exactly how
[23:09] it is. Amen.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; It's exactly the truth. Amen.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; So, continuing on verse 39,
[23:18] excuse me.
[23:23] Jesus said, um, "Behold my hands and my
[23:26] feet, that it is I myself.
[23:29] Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not
[23:32] flesh and bones as you see me have." And
[23:35] when he had thus spoken, he showed them
[23:38] his hands and his feet. And while they
[23:41] yet believed not for joy and wondered oh
[23:44] now they believed not for joy. Amen. It
[23:46] just they were just so
[23:48] so it was it seemed too good to be true.
[23:51] Amen.
[23:53] And wondered. He said unto them, "Have
[23:54] you hear any meat?" And he and they gave
[23:57] him a piece of broiled fish and of an
[23:59] honeycomb. And he took it and did eat
[24:01] before them. And just to to prove he
[24:03] said, "Does a does a spirit eat meat and
[24:05] drink?" you know, um,
[24:07] &gt;&gt; but he was just to to prove to them.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; And see, he he bears with us sometimes
[24:12] in our in our
[24:14] &gt;&gt; lack of understanding, you know.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. He's he's a he's a our
[24:18] teacher. Amen.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Sometimes I'm sure
[24:21] Brother Jesse knows. I hear from my
[24:22] sister Shai. She's a teacher there at
[24:24] the at the at a school there. And and um
[24:28] you got to be patient.
[24:30] From what I've heard, I'm not I have
[24:32] never taught in a school, but but
[24:33] according to what I hear, sometimes you
[24:35] got to be really patient until they
[24:37] catch on to a concept.
[24:39] Now, she teaches, I think, uh,
[24:41] kindergarteners and preschoolers and um,
[24:44] and so you got to be really patient and
[24:46] and and let them catch on. You have to
[24:49] let something be revealed to them. Is
[24:51] that right? Amen. Be patient with them,
[24:53] Lord. Be patient with us, Lord. Just
[24:55] sir,
[24:55] &gt;&gt; and and and help us to be help us to be
[24:57] ready to receive it. Amen. Amen.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; Always learning. Amen. Here a little and
[25:01] there a little
[25:02] &gt;&gt; from glory to glory. Praise God.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; Um and he said unto them, "These are the
[25:07] words which I spake unto you while I was
[25:09] yet with you, that all things must be
[25:12] fulfilled, which were written in the law
[25:14] of Moses and in the prophets and in the
[25:16] psalms concerning me."
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Now, see, this was the time for that to
[25:21] be revealed. Amen. This was the time for
[25:23] that revelation.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God. The the time of fulfillment.
[25:26] Remember when Jesus was reading from uh
[25:29] Isaiah the prophet in the in the temple
[25:31] and um he he told them this day this
[25:34] scripture is fulfilled in your ears and
[25:37] they they didn't appreciate that being
[25:38] being told in their in their temple
[25:40] because they didn't realize who was in
[25:42] front of them but he told them plainly.
[25:44] Amen.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; But it was hid from them. Amen. They
[25:46] were blinded.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um then verse 45. Then he opened
[25:53] their understanding. Praise the Lord.
[25:55] That's what we want. Amen.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; That they might understand the
[25:58] scriptures. Amen.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; There. And and said unto them, thus it
[26:03] is written and thus it behooved Christ
[26:05] to suffer and to rise from the dead the
[26:07] third day and that repentance and
[26:09] remission of sins should be preached in
[26:11] his name among all nations beginning at
[26:13] Jerusalem.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I thank the Lord for the word
[26:16] that we have and for for hearing it
[26:18] through a prophet that he gave it
[26:20] directly to him. But I I wonder
[26:22] sometimes like it would have been so
[26:24] neat to hear Jesus himself on the earth,
[26:26] you know, in the flesh preaching this
[26:28] straight from the scriptures because he
[26:29] wrote them. You know, you know, we know
[26:31] it is Jesus himself in the Holy Ghost
[26:33] that reveals that to his prophets and to
[26:35] to his ministers. Amen.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; But it just would have been, you know
[26:38] what I'm what I'm saying. It just would
[26:39] have been something to hear Jesus uh you
[26:42] know in in in the flesh there just
[26:45] opening these things going from Moses
[26:47] and the law and the prophets. you know,
[26:48] he he was he's the expert on the on the
[26:50] subject. Amen.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; It would have been wonderful to just to
[26:53] just hear and and glean all of that.
[26:55] Amen.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And rise from the dead
[27:00] the third day. And then verse 47, and
[27:02] that repentance and remission of sins
[27:05] should be preached in his name among all
[27:06] nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And ye
[27:09] are witnesses of these things. And
[27:12] behold, I send the promise of my father
[27:14] upon you. Amen. We know that's the Holy
[27:16] Ghost. Uh, but ter ye in the city of
[27:18] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[27:21] from on high. And he led them out as far
[27:23] as Bethany and lifted up his hands and
[27:25] blessed them. And it came to pass while
[27:28] he blessed them, he was parted from them
[27:29] and carried up into heaven. Amen. And
[27:32] they worshiped him and returned to
[27:33] Jerusalem with great joy and were
[27:36] continually in the temple praising and
[27:38] blessing God. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[27:40] Hallelujah.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; That would have been the most wonderful
[27:45] experience of their lives. Amen. One of
[27:48] them, you know,
[27:49] &gt;&gt; just just to to witness this, to be
[27:51] there and and um but now he's made us
[27:54] witnesses of the power of his
[27:55] resurrection in us. That's that's
[27:57] glorious, too. Amen. What a glorious
[27:59] time we live in to to see the full
[28:01] revelation of the son of man. Amen. The
[28:03] revelation of Jesus Christ. Amen. And um
[28:07] I I I wanted to notice some things about
[28:10] this this whole um uh passage we just
[28:13] read here that remember uh from the time
[28:17] they went to the sephilic that these
[28:19] were God's chosen people. These were his
[28:21] group. I just I have some bullet points
[28:23] here that I I was I was thinking as I
[28:25] was reading over these things. Um they
[28:27] were God's chosen people. The ones he
[28:28] had called out his chosen his true
[28:31] church, right?
[28:32] uh even though they hadn't received the
[28:33] Holy Ghost yet, but they were his his
[28:35] church. Amen. And they found themselves
[28:38] seeking the living amongst the dead.
[28:40] Amen. And uh you'll never find the the
[28:43] life the power of the living God. Amen.
[28:45] In in a in a the place of the dead.
[28:47] Amen. And the in the tombs and burial
[28:50] grounds of of dead creeds and
[28:52] denominations and dogmas and and and
[28:55] man-made letter. Amen.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. But they but God's
[29:00] people were were
[29:02] uh seeking the living among the dead.
[29:04] And then the angels, the messengers um
[29:08] that met them brought to their
[29:09] remembrance the words of Jesus and then
[29:11] preached to them that Jesus was still
[29:13] alive. Amen.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; And then the angel's message reminded
[29:17] them of what Jesus promised he would do.
[29:19] But then remember Jesus came himself and
[29:22] proved it. Amen.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. He and he vindicated it by his
[29:28] presence. Is that right? and showed up
[29:30] himself. Amen. Is this starting to sound
[29:33] familiar? Amen. Praise God.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus revealed himself in the
[29:37] scriptures. Uh and then right after he
[29:39] revealed himself, he led his little
[29:42] chosen group um out of the religious
[29:44] city and and and then he led them to a
[29:47] certain place and then a rapture took
[29:48] place. Amen.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; And then uh this is this is a a bonus
[29:53] one I had here. Amen. That they returned
[29:56] to Jerusalem and were continually in the
[29:58] temple. Amen. and praising and blessing
[30:00] God. Amen.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; That after the rapture had taken place.
[30:03] Praise the Lord. But if you think about
[30:06] that in in in our day, Amen. God always
[30:10] uh reveals himself through the
[30:12] scripture. You know, scripture has to
[30:13] interpret scripture. Is that right?
[30:15] Amen.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; But but God has a program. These things
[30:18] happen. Um God is the same. He likes to
[30:21] do things his way. Amen. His way is a
[30:24] perfect way. And he he hides them from
[30:26] the wise and prudent and reveals them
[30:28] unto babes such as we'll learn. Amen.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Hiding himself in simplicity and then
[30:32] revealing himself in the same. Amen.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; But if you think about in in in our time
[30:38] that um God's chosen people, Amen. the
[30:40] church, they were they began to to seek
[30:44] the living amongst the dead. you know,
[30:46] they were scattered in in different
[30:47] denominations and and systems and and um
[30:52] then it took an angel messenger, amen,
[30:55] to bring to remembrance the the words of
[30:58] Jesus and to preach that Jesus Christ
[31:00] was still alive, the same yesterday,
[31:01] today and forever. Amen. And then uh and
[31:06] then Jesus came himself when he was
[31:08] preaching uh and and vindicated by his
[31:11] presence. Amen.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know in our day the Lord
[31:14] vindicated it by his visible presence in
[31:16] the pillar of fire. Amen.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; And and he proved that he himself was
[31:22] doing the revealing. Amen. It was the
[31:24] work of the Lord Jesus Christ on our
[31:26] brother. Amen.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And uh and Jesus revealed
[31:30] himself in the scripture, right? The
[31:32] revelation, remember the the seals, the
[31:35] the church ages, it wasn't anything
[31:37] outside of the scripture.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; It had to be something in that was
[31:40] already hidden in the scripture. just
[31:43] magnified. Amen. Made known.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But it couldn't come
[31:47] that remember the mystery of God
[31:48] couldn't be finished until the appointed
[31:50] time.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a time for revelation.
[31:54] Praise God. That's our our title by
[31:55] God's grace.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Um the time for revelation and and and
[32:00] our day was the time. It wasn't to be
[32:02] revealed until the time of the end.
[32:04] Amen.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[32:07] But that's God's program. Is that right?
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh and then after the
[32:12] revelation of Jesus Christ, Amen. Um
[32:15] when God calls out his chosen group
[32:18] around himself. Amen.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; And then a rapture takes place. Praise
[32:23] the Lord.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So that's what we're looking
[32:26] for. Amen. The the program of God. I
[32:28] just thought that was some really neat
[32:30] things in there as I was reading that. I
[32:31] was like, "Praise the Lord." That's
[32:33] exactly the way God likes to work. Amen.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; Is evident in the scripture. Praise God.
[32:40] So often often if history repeats
[32:42] itself, often it's the Lord's program uh
[32:45] being revealed. Amen.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So uh Romans 16 uh and
[32:51] verses 25- 27 here.
[33:00] Praise the Lord.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord for revelation. Amen.
[33:05] Amen.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; It's it's we can't we can never give
[33:08] ourselves revelation. Is that right?
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can never um be hol make
[33:14] ourselves holy enough to have all
[33:15] revelation, you know.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can never you can't buy
[33:20] revelation. You can't acquire revelation
[33:22] by by um by laboring with your hands.
[33:25] You know, we we labor to enter into rest
[33:27] and then the Lord reveals things to us.
[33:29] But we can't we can't work um you know
[33:34] enough to just gain revelation. It's not
[33:36] something you can seek and uh and uh
[33:39] physically like u you it's not a u you
[33:45] know you don't have to take a grand
[33:46] journey through all the mountains and
[33:47] the and you don't have to climb to the
[33:49] top of Mount Everest to gain the the the
[33:51] enlightenment of you know what I'm
[33:53] saying but but it's has to be the Lord
[33:56] uh taking taking uh opening your eyes to
[34:00] it. Amen. Because remember, he had told
[34:02] them plainly what was going to happen,
[34:04] but it was still hid from them
[34:06] &gt;&gt; until he opened it to them in the
[34:08] scriptures and revealed himself to them.
[34:10] Amen. In the time that he wanted it to
[34:12] be done,
[34:13] &gt;&gt; then it was going to be hid until the
[34:15] time of revelation. Amen.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; So, revelation is is is
[34:20] only the grace of God. That's how that's
[34:22] what brings revelation. Amen.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Faith. Amen.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[34:28] So in Romans 16 verse 25, now to him
[34:31] that is of power to establish you
[34:33] according to my gospel and the preaching
[34:36] of Jesus Christ according to the
[34:38] revelation of the mystery which was kept
[34:41] secret since the world began. Amen. And
[34:44] now just a a note here. or me and
[34:46] brother Jesse were just talking about
[34:48] people there there's people out there
[34:50] that believe Paul was a liar that
[34:53] believe that his uh epistles were false
[34:56] that he was he was not a real um
[34:59] follower of Christ and uh they discount
[35:01] his teaching but uh that's we know
[35:04] that's the furthest thing from the
[35:05] truth. Amen.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh like like me and
[35:08] brother Jesse were talking that uh he
[35:10] said if any man preaches another gospel
[35:12] even an angel from heaven let him be a
[35:14] cursed. Amen. Praise the Lord. We we and
[35:17] we're resting on that. Why? Because
[35:19] brother uh Brandham preached the same
[35:21] gospel that was delivered to Paul. Amen.
[35:23] The faith that was once delivered to the
[35:24] saints, he preached the same thing and
[35:26] we're resting on that. Amen.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[35:31] So, um and and you know, Peter also
[35:34] another thing we had mentioned earlier
[35:36] was that Peter said that um some of the
[35:39] things that Paul wrote are hard to be
[35:41] understood, but he said, "But those that
[35:42] wrestle with them are unlearned." Amen.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; So if you if you can't take what Paul
[35:47] said, then you can't take what Peter
[35:49] said either. So then what do you have?
[35:51] You know, praise the Lord.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, uh, continuing on, but
[35:58] now, verse 26, but now is made manifest.
[36:02] Amen. But now is made manifest. and by
[36:05] the scriptures of the prophets according
[36:07] to the commandment of the everlasting
[36:09] God made known to all nations for the
[36:12] obedience of faith.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh to God only wise be glory
[36:17] through Jesus Christ forever. Amen. I
[36:19] say amen. To God be all the glory. Amen.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; This mystery he's talking about here um
[36:25] which was was then made manifest. Amen.
[36:28] It was the time then for that revelation
[36:30] um by the scriptures and the prophets.
[36:32] He says, um, made known to all nations
[36:35] for the obedience of faith.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; It was for the obedience of faith. The
[36:39] the mystery here, the the whole mystery
[36:41] of God wasn't finished yet, but this
[36:44] mystery was Christ in you, the hope of
[36:46] glory. Amen. The mystery of the gospel.
[36:49] Amen. Praise the Lord. So, uh, but this
[36:52] was the time for that to be made
[36:54] manifest. Praise God.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; The mystery of the gospel. And then um
[36:59] we find he he talks a little bit more
[37:01] about this here in Colossians the first
[37:03] chapter and starting at verse 23 he says
[37:06] if you continue in the faith grounded
[37:09] and settled and not and be not moved
[37:12] away from the hope of the gospel which
[37:14] you have heard and which was preached to
[37:16] every creature which is under heaven
[37:18] whereof I Paul made a minister and then
[37:21] and it wasn't by his own making himself
[37:23] a minister by his what he made himself
[37:26] was a Pharisee. Is that right?
[37:28] &gt;&gt; But God made him a minister of the
[37:30] gospel. Amen.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God. If he would have stayed what
[37:33] he made himself, he would have still
[37:34] been a Pharisee. Amen.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise God. Anyway, uh
[37:39] um who now rejoice in my sufferings for
[37:41] you and fill up that which is behind of
[37:44] the afflictions of Christ uh in my flesh
[37:47] for his body's sake, which is the
[37:48] church.
[37:53] Whereof I am made a minister according
[37:55] to the dispensation of God, which is
[37:58] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[38:00] of God. Amen.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it was through
[38:04] through every age, to every messenger.
[38:06] Amen. to every apostle, the dispensation
[38:08] of God given to them for you, for God's
[38:12] people, God's elect. Amen. Praise the
[38:15] Lord, to fulfill the word of God. That's
[38:17] what it's all for. Praise God.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Even the mystery. And now he's talking
[38:23] about the mystery here. The mystery
[38:24] which hath been hid from ages and from
[38:26] generations, but now is made manifest to
[38:28] his saints. To whom God would make known
[38:32] what is the riches of the glory of this
[38:34] mystery. Amen. the real riches like we
[38:36] heard this morning. Amen. Praise God.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Of the glory of this mystery among the
[38:40] Gentiles which is Christ in you, the
[38:43] hope of glory.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. That is the the
[38:46] mystery Paul is talking about here that
[38:48] remember the whole mystery of God hadn't
[38:51] been finished yet. That wasn't to come
[38:53] until this last day. Amen. But the the
[38:56] mystery that was then was in part the
[38:58] revelation of Jesus Christ because it
[39:01] was Christ in you, the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[39:03] The hope of glory. Amen. The the down
[39:05] payment for the resurrection, the
[39:06] earnest.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; But this was this was the time for that
[39:12] revelation. Amen. God always has a time
[39:15] and a season. He knew exactly when it
[39:17] would be.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and he coordinated it. No one
[39:20] has to help the Lord. I mean, we're his
[39:22] servants. He uses us to fulfill his
[39:24] word. Amen. He uses his prophets to
[39:26] bring his word and and and his servants
[39:28] to fulfill it. Amen.
[39:30] But God doesn't need anyone to remind
[39:33] him and to help him fulfill his word.
[39:35] Amen.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; As soon as it leaves the lips of God,
[39:38] it's as good as as done as fulfilled.
[39:41] Amen.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; But sometimes it won't be fulfilled
[39:44] until its season. Amen.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, uh and and that at that
[39:50] time, remember, uh this was the the time
[39:53] that it was fulfilled that the people
[39:54] who walked in darkness have seen a great
[39:56] light. Amen. The Gentiles. Praise God.
[39:58] That's us. Praise the Lord. Like
[40:00] Cornelius, we heard this morning God
[40:01] made away that and and and they were the
[40:04] Jews were astonished. They were or they
[40:05] marveled rather that that he it was also
[40:08] sent to the Gentiles. Amen.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; That the gospel was preached to them and
[40:12] they believed it. Not only it was
[40:13] preached to them, but that they believed
[40:14] it and received it and they also
[40:16] received the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[40:18] They said and and remember and they
[40:20] spoke with tongues as well as we. Amen.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God. The same Holy Ghost, not not
[40:25] a different one for Jews and Gentiles.
[40:27] Amen. because now there's neither Jew
[40:28] nor Greek, you know, um nor bond nor
[40:31] free, but we're all baptized by one
[40:33] spirit into one body. Amen. Praise God.
[40:36] I'm so grateful he made a way for us to
[40:38] be in it, too. Amen.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; The people who walked in darkness had
[40:42] seen a great light.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was fulfilled in its season.
[40:45] Amen. When the great light was come.
[40:47] Amen.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; When when Jesus came. Amen. Praise God.
[40:52] And uh then we find here uh we're going
[40:56] to read a little bit from Luke chapter 1
[40:58] here. We find this right before the
[40:59] birth of John the Baptist. Um this is
[41:02] when an angel had appeared to
[41:03] Zachcharias uh in the temple here. And
[41:06] um he and and Elizabeth, it says they
[41:08] were devout. They they walked in the
[41:10] commandments of God blameless. Um and so
[41:13] this angel is appearing to Zacharias.
[41:15] They had been they had prayed unto the
[41:17] Lord. Um because Elizabeth, his wife,
[41:19] was barren. and she had never had
[41:21] children. And um that was a very hard
[41:23] thing for the the women back then. It
[41:24] was it was looked down on in society
[41:26] when someone was barren. And um
[41:30] &gt;&gt; they thought about it just very
[41:31] differently back then. And so they had
[41:34] no doubt probably prayed countless times
[41:37] for the Lord to open her womb.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; But now there's a an angel that appears
[41:41] to Zachcharias as he's fulfilling his
[41:43] priestly duty here. And uh verse 13 of
[41:47] Luke 1 says, "But the angel said unto
[41:49] him, fear not, Zachcharias, for thy
[41:51] prayer is heard." Hallelujah.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful your prayer is
[41:56] heard? Amen.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; And thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a
[42:01] son, and call his name John, and thou
[42:04] shalt have joy and gladness, and many
[42:06] shall rejoice at his birth, for he shall
[42:09] be great in the sight of the Lord, and
[42:11] shall drink neither wine nor strong
[42:13] drink. and he shall be filled with the
[42:15] Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb.
[42:17] Amen. In other words, don't drink or
[42:19] smoke or defile your body in any way.
[42:20] Amen. That's a that's another uh another
[42:22] message. Praise the Lord. Another
[42:25] another sermon for another day. Praise
[42:26] the Lord. But
[42:28] &gt;&gt; yes, sir.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; But and many of the children of Israel
[42:30] shall he turn to the Lord their God.
[42:32] Hallelujah. And um and he shall go
[42:35] before him in the spirit and power of
[42:37] Elias. Amen. That's what it is. Amen. to
[42:39] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[42:41] children, and the disobedient to the
[42:43] wisdom of the just, to make ready a
[42:45] people prepared for the Lord. And
[42:47] Zachchariah said unto the angel,
[42:49] "Whereby shall I know this? For I am
[42:51] old, an old man, and my wife
[42:53] wellstricken in years." Amen. This this
[42:57] thing he had prayed for uh you know, he
[43:00] and Elizabeth probably probably
[43:02] sincerely prayed before God always.
[43:04] Well, we know they did because God heard
[43:05] their prayer and uh now it was to be
[43:07] answered. And now that he heard it, and
[43:09] then he uh he had a hard time believing
[43:11] it. He said, "But my wife is old." And
[43:14] and and the way brother Brandham talks
[43:15] about it is the difference between him
[43:17] and Mary. Um because remember, she said,
[43:19] "How can these things be um no one no
[43:23] virgin had ever conceived before?" And
[43:25] so she was curious what she was supposed
[43:27] to do, you know, and um and how the word
[43:30] of the Lord would be fulfilled. But in
[43:32] this case, um especially being a priest
[43:34] here, um Zecharias had the example of of
[43:36] Abraham. Amen. and Sarah
[43:38] &gt;&gt; how he had opened her womb and and
[43:40] Hannah he had opened her womb and um and
[43:43] he still he had a hard time believing it
[43:46] and um it's kind of amazes me his
[43:48] question here um he said how shall I
[43:51] know this um as if an angel didn't just
[43:54] come and tell him that it was going to
[43:56] be amen
[43:57] &gt;&gt; but sometimes our our human minds are
[43:59] just foolish that way you know
[44:01] &gt;&gt; sometimes we're we're slow to believe uh
[44:04] all the things that have been spoken
[44:06] &gt;&gt; but thank the Lord He's gracious with
[44:07] us. Amen.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; And and bears with us a little in our in
[44:10] our folly. Amen.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But look what the angel
[44:14] tells him. And he says, "And the angel
[44:16] answered answering said unto him, I am
[44:19] Gabriel that stand in the presence of
[44:21] God and am sent to speak unto thee and
[44:23] to show thee these glad tidings.
[44:26] And behold, thou shalt be dumb and not
[44:28] able to speak until the day that these
[44:30] things shall be performed because thou
[44:32] believest not my words, which shall be
[44:34] fulfilled in their season." Amen. So
[44:37] this he he told them what was to come to
[44:39] pass and then he tells them um that
[44:42] they'll be fulfilled in their season.
[44:43] There was a time that had to come in
[44:45] order for them to be fulfilled.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um every prophecy has has its
[44:50] season to be fulfilled. Amen.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; To everything there's a season. Amen.
[44:54] And um and like we like we said when we
[44:57] open here from Isaiah, the Lord sends
[44:59] his word to accomplish whatsoever he
[45:01] pleases, what he what he desires it to
[45:04] perform. Amen. To accomplish. He like he
[45:06] sends the rain in its season and the and
[45:09] fall comes in its season. Um winter
[45:11] comes in season, spring and summer. Just
[45:14] like he's established those seasons, so
[45:16] has he established spiritual seasons at
[45:18] times for his word to come to pass.
[45:20] Amen. And unfold exactly as he wanted it
[45:22] to. Amen.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Don't you believe he he
[45:25] preserves his own word? Amen.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But John couldn't come and
[45:30] be born um until the season, right?
[45:32] Until right before Jesus had come.
[45:36] uh because he was appointed to be a
[45:39] forerunner. Amen. The forerunner of
[45:41] Jesus. So he had to come right at the
[45:44] right time. Amen. The the he was not
[45:46] that light, but he he came to bear
[45:49] witness of the light. Amen.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; And so they so they had to come just at
[45:53] the right time. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. In in due time. Praise God.
[45:59] And um
[46:02] in Habach here, I want to read Habach uh
[46:05] chapter 2 starting at verse two.
[46:10] And uh you know, John couldn't come in
[46:11] Abraham's day. He he couldn't come in in
[46:14] Noah's day, you know. Um but he had to
[46:18] come in John's day. Is that right? The
[46:20] the the appointed time for that
[46:22] scripture to be fulfilled. Praise the
[46:24] Lord. Amen. Everything in in the season
[46:26] and timing of the Lord. Amen. Now,
[46:28] Habach chapter 2 and verse two. Um, and
[46:32] the Lord answered me and said, "Write
[46:35] the vision and make it plain upon tables
[46:37] that he may run that readeth it." Now,
[46:39] the the vision he saw uh I believe was
[46:41] of the Babylonian invasion there in um
[46:45] verse three says, "For the vision is yet
[46:47] for an appointed time." So, it hadn't
[46:50] happened yet, but the Lord showed him
[46:52] the things that were going to come to
[46:53] pass. Amen. That's what what visions
[46:55] are. Amen. And it's it's this it's the
[46:57] prophecy, the spirit of prophecy. It's
[46:59] the testimony of Jesus Christ. Is that
[47:01] right? Amen.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; So the the vision is yet for an
[47:05] appointed time. Amen. But at the end it
[47:08] shall speak and not lie, though it tar.
[47:11] Wait for it because it will surely come
[47:13] and not tarry. In other words, it won't
[47:15] be delayed. Amen.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; It'll be right on time. Praise God.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it is yet for an appointed
[47:21] time. And notice he said, "At the end it
[47:24] shall speak." Amen. There's there's
[47:26] always a voice behind the vision and and
[47:29] a voice behind the sign. Is that right?
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's it's it's the voice of God
[47:34] that that speaks to his prophets
[47:36] revealing things. Amen.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; But they can only come to pass in their
[47:40] season. Amen.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; I think you understand what I'm what I'm
[47:43] saying here.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[47:46] Amen.
[47:49] But and also remember um in the time of
[47:51] Daniel, Amen. that uh he had seen the
[47:54] the vision there and the angel told him
[47:57] to shut up the words and and to seal the
[47:59] book even to the time of the end.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; So the the book that Daniel was to seal
[48:05] until the time of the end was was a
[48:07] sealed book, right? And that's exactly
[48:10] what it was until the time of the end.
[48:12] Then the things uh which he he saw were
[48:15] to be hidden until then. Until that
[48:16] time. Amen. when the when we know the
[48:19] lamb would take the book at the
[48:21] appointed time and loose the seals on it
[48:23] and open it. Praise God. And reveal the
[48:25] whole plan of redemption that had been
[48:27] from the beginning. Amen. The the whole
[48:29] revelation of himself, Jesus Christ, the
[48:31] righteous. Amen.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And um it it wasn't to it
[48:36] was not to happen before. It was not to
[48:39] happen after. It was exactly in the time
[48:41] God wanted it to be. Amen.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Praise God. God is never late. and and
[48:47] and he's never in the wrong time. He's
[48:50] always in the right time. Is that right?
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And of course, we we hear this
[48:55] scripture often uh in Revelation 10:7.
[49:01] But in the days of the voice of the
[49:03] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[49:06] sound, the mystery of God should be
[49:08] finished, as he hath declared to his
[49:11] servants, the prophets. Amen. the this
[49:14] the book that that uh we saw Daniel was
[49:17] to to seal until the time of the end um
[49:20] it had to be sealed until this time.
[49:21] Amen. Until it was time for the mystery
[49:23] to be finished and unveiled. Amen.
[49:26] Praise the Lord. That which was hid from
[49:29] the beginning. Praise God. Amen. And
[49:31] this is that's the time we're living in
[49:33] now. Amen. The the days of the voice of
[49:34] the seventh angel. The voice the shout
[49:36] has gone forth. Amen. The voice is has
[49:38] gone forth. Praise the Lord.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And but remember, it's
[49:44] not just because, you know, it's it's
[49:46] not just for no reason, but it's to
[49:49] somebody.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; It's to accomplish something.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. It's it's to a a
[49:54] an elected Amen. to to Christ's bride.
[49:58] Amen. To pull her out
[50:00] &gt;&gt; and and and to make her ready. Praise
[50:03] the Lord.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen, sir.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; To make ready a people for the Lord.
[50:06] Amen.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And revelation can only come
[50:09] to you personally if you are prepared to
[50:11] receive it. Is that right? Amen. You've
[50:13] got to be ready to receive it. Amen. You
[50:15] you you uh I'd say like this. You can't
[50:18] catch nothing if you ain't fishing.
[50:19] Amen. Praise God. You can only you can
[50:21] only catch if you're casting for it.
[50:23] Amen. You're not going to catch anything
[50:25] by sitting and staring at the water.
[50:26] Amen. Praise God. But it can only come
[50:29] in in the Lord's season. Amen.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; We just want to be ready for it. Like
[50:33] Jesus said uh in in the parable here of
[50:36] the seed uh in Luke 8
[50:40] and uh verses 5-15 here uh Jesus says in
[50:45] this parable that a sewer went out to
[50:47] sew his seed and as he sowed some fell
[50:50] by the wayside and it was trotten down
[50:52] and the fowls of the air devoured it and
[50:55] some fell upon a rock and as soon as it
[50:57] was sprung up it withered away because
[50:59] it lacked moisture and some fell among
[51:02] thorns And the thorns sprang up uh with
[51:05] it and choked it and other fell on good
[51:08] ground and sprang up and bare fruit and
[51:10] hundfold. And when he had said these
[51:12] things, watch this is kind of a a
[51:14] strange
[51:15] seems to be a strange place for this,
[51:18] but when he had said these things, he
[51:20] cried, "He that hath ears to hear, let
[51:23] him hear." Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Does that sound familiar? Praise the
[51:27] Lord. It was the same the same Lord
[51:29] Jesus in in Revelation that said, "He
[51:31] that hath an ear to hear, let him hear."
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And um and his
[51:37] disciples asked him, saying, "What might
[51:40] this parable be?" And he said, "Unto you
[51:43] it is given to know the mysteries of the
[51:45] kingdom of God,
[51:47] but to others in parables, seeing uh
[51:51] that seeing they might see and hearing
[51:53] they might not understand." Now, the
[51:55] parable is this. Thank the Lord. He he
[51:58] opens his word to us. Amen. He gives a
[52:00] parable. He gives a a a teaching. He
[52:02] hides something in simplicity, but then
[52:04] he reveals it in the same. Amen.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Thank the Lord. He He said,
[52:08] "The parable is this. This is what it
[52:10] means." Praise God. I'm going to I'm
[52:12] going to share my secret with you. Amen.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. You're
[52:16] grateful for that. Amen.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; The parable is this. The seed is the
[52:21] word of God. See, it's it's that simple.
[52:23] Sometimes it it takes the the almighty
[52:25] God to reveal something so simple. Amen.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; The seed is the word of God. Those by
[52:31] the wayside are they that hear. Then
[52:34] cometh the devil and taketh away the
[52:36] word out of their hearts, lest they
[52:37] should believe and be saved. They on the
[52:40] rock are they which when they hear
[52:42] receive the word with joy, and these
[52:44] have no root uh which for a while
[52:46] believe, and in the time of temptation
[52:48] fall away.
[52:52] And that which fell among thorns are
[52:54] they which when they have heard go forth
[52:57] and are choked with cares and riches and
[53:00] pleasures of this life. Amen. And and
[53:03] bring no fruit to perfection.
[53:06] But that on the good ground are they
[53:08] which is which in an honest and good
[53:11] heart having heard the word keep it and
[53:14] bring forth fruit with patience. Amen.
[53:17] Praise God. Lord, help us to have an
[53:18] honest and good heart. Amen. uh tilled
[53:21] up, you know, the the hard ground broken
[53:23] up, tender before the Lord. Amen.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God. With with good nutrients.
[53:28] Praise the Lord.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Of a of a good honest and good
[53:31] heart.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes it's got to be tilled
[53:35] up, you know, before it can receive it.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. But but it has to be that way in
[53:40] order to receive the the seed of the
[53:42] word. Amen. Praise the Lord. That word
[53:44] have I hid in my heart that I might not
[53:45] sin against thee. Praise God.
[53:48] Amen. and let us keep the seed of the
[53:50] word in there. Praise the Lord. Don't
[53:52] let any anything take it away. Amen. And
[53:55] uh in the book of Acts here in chapter 8
[53:57] and verse 26, um we read here a a story
[54:03] with Philip here.
[54:05] And I think this is a really amazing
[54:08] story. It just amazes me when I read it.
[54:10] It's just it's amazing. Praise the Lord.
[54:13] And the angel of the Lord spake unto
[54:14] Philillip, saying, Arise, and go toward
[54:18] the south unto the way that goeth down
[54:20] from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is
[54:22] desert.
[54:24] And he arose and went, and behold, a man
[54:26] of Ethiopia and unic of great authority
[54:29] under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians,
[54:32] uh, who had the charge of of all her
[54:34] treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for
[54:36] to worship,
[54:38] was returning, and sitting in his
[54:40] chariot, uh, read Isaas the prophet or
[54:44] Isaiah the prophet.
[54:46] Then the spirit said unto Philillip, "Go
[54:48] near and join thyself to this chariot."
[54:51] Notice this is one thing I find so
[54:53] amazing about this is that the Lord put
[54:56] it on Philip's heart spoke to him
[54:58] clearly and the spirit told him to go
[55:01] join to this chariot just for this one
[55:04] man this one brother who was reading the
[55:06] scripture. Amen.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; For one person the Lord sent Philillip
[55:10] there. Amen.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[55:13] And the spirit said unto Philip, "Go
[55:15] near, join thyself to this chariot." And
[55:17] Philip ran thither to him and heard him
[55:20] read the prophet uh Isaiah and said,
[55:22] "Understandest thou what thou readest?"
[55:25] Amen. And he said, "How can I except
[55:28] some man should guide me?" Amen. How can
[55:31] how can we understand all these things
[55:32] except someone should guide us? Amen.
[55:34] That's what prophets are for, brothers
[55:35] and sisters. The word of the Lord comes
[55:37] to the prophets. Amen. Surely I'll do
[55:39] nothing except I declare it to my
[55:41] servants the prophets.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right?
[55:43] &gt;&gt; And uh so he said, "How can I accept
[55:46] someone should guide me?" Amen. Thank
[55:48] the Lord we have the Holy Spirit to
[55:49] guide us through the scriptures. Amen.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And he desired Philip that
[55:54] he should come up and sit with him. And
[55:57] uh notice his attitude here, the Unix
[56:00] attitude. He uh when Philip asked him,
[56:02] "Do you understand what you're reading?"
[56:03] He didn't say, "What do you mean do I
[56:05] understand?" Of course, I understand.
[56:07] You know, or that's not any of your
[56:08] business, you know. He said he said,
[56:11] "No, how can I?" He was honest. He said,
[56:13] "How can I except someone should guide
[56:15] me?" And then he wanted him to come up
[56:16] there with him. He said, "Well, maybe
[56:18] you can explain it to me." Amen.
[56:22] And the place of the scripture which he
[56:24] read was this. He was led as a sheep to
[56:27] the slaughter. And like a lamb done
[56:29] before his sheer, so he opened he not
[56:31] his mouth. And his humiliation, his
[56:34] judgment was taken away. And who shall
[56:36] declare his generation? for his life is
[56:38] taken from the earth.
[56:43] And the unic answered Philillip and
[56:45] said, I pray thee, uh, of whom speaketh
[56:48] the prophet this, of himself or of some
[56:51] other man? Amen. He he he didn't yet
[56:53] understand what the scripture was
[56:55] saying, but that's why the Lord sent a
[56:57] man. Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; A God- sent man, a man sent from God to
[57:01] open the scripture. Is that right?
[57:03] Praise the Lord. Then I love this. This
[57:06] is I love this verse here. Amen. I love
[57:09] all of it, but you know what I mean.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Then 35. Then Philip opened his mouth
[57:14] and began at the same scripture and
[57:16] preached unto him Jesus. Amen.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; That's what that's what it's all for.
[57:20] Amen. To to preach unto you Jesus. Amen.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; That's that's what I'm trying to do by
[57:24] the help of the Lord. Preach unto you
[57:25] Jesus. Amen.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. That's the main
[57:29] thing. Like we're here this morning.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Don't miss the main thing.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. preached unto him Jesus.
[57:35] Hallelujah. And um that's what the Lord
[57:38] sent him to do just to one man. Amen.
[57:41] And as they went their way, they came
[57:43] under certain water. And the unic said,
[57:45] "See, here is water. What do hinder me
[57:47] to be baptized?" And Philip said, "If
[57:49] thou believest with all thine heart,
[57:51] thou mayaest?" And he answered and said,
[57:53] "I believe that Jesus Christ is the son
[57:56] of God." Amen. What a glorious
[57:58] confession. Praise the Lord. What a what
[58:00] a glorious decision thou has made. Amen.
[58:03] Praise the Lord. And you know, I was
[58:06] thinking that that, you know, we don't
[58:07] have to only confess it when we're
[58:09] saved. Amen. We can confess it all the
[58:11] time. I still believe it.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; I I still believe Jesus Christ is the
[58:14] son of God. Amen.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. What a what a
[58:19] glorious confession that is.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he commanded the chariot to
[58:24] stand still and they went down both into
[58:26] the water, both Philip and the unic. And
[58:28] he baptized him. And when they were come
[58:31] up out of the water, the spirit of the
[58:33] Lord caught away Philillip that the unic
[58:34] saw him no more. And he went on his way
[58:37] rejoicing.
[58:41] Hallelujah.
[58:43] So the Lord sent Philillip specifically
[58:46] to this brother to preach to him Jesus.
[58:49] Amen. But notice the condition when
[58:52] Philip found him, he was he was already
[58:55] in the scripture. Amen. He already had
[58:57] the book open before him searching the
[58:59] scriptures. Amen. And and and he was
[59:02] found reading. Amen. Found searching.
[59:04] Praise the Lord. And in the right
[59:06] attitude. Amen. Saying, "I don't
[59:08] understand, but how can I understand
[59:10] except someone teach me?"
[59:12] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Come, come up in my
[59:13] chariot. Maybe you can show me. Maybe
[59:14] you can teach me. What does this mean?"
[59:16] Hallelujah. He was He wanted to learn.
[59:19] Amen.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; God re That's That's who God reveals
[59:21] himself unto. Babe, such as we'll learn.
[59:24] Praise the Lord. He didn't say, "No, he
[59:26] said uh it's none of your business." You
[59:28] know, I of course I understand what I'm
[59:29] reading. You know,
[59:31] praise the Lord. But he was he he
[59:33] desired to know. He wanted to know.
[59:35] Amen. And uh that's how revelation comes
[59:38] to people who are who are seeking for it
[59:40] and who are already in the scripture.
[59:42] Amen. How can the Lord reveal you
[59:44] something reveal to you something in the
[59:46] scripture if you're not in the
[59:47] scripture? Amen.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I I I I pray he helps
[59:52] me get more into the scripture and and
[59:53] open my understanding more. How can I
[59:56] understand except he reveal it to me.
[59:57] Amen.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Except he opens my eyes.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; But sometimes, you know, sometimes he
[1:00:04] waits to show us things, you know, and
[1:00:07] and um we might have something on the
[1:00:09] shelf for years and years or months or
[1:00:12] um and you know, it's just something
[1:00:15] maybe that's been a question and we
[1:00:16] don't understand. Said, "Lord, I believe
[1:00:17] this. I just I don't fully understand
[1:00:19] maybe." And and uh I know I have. You
[1:00:22] know, I I've had things I didn't
[1:00:24] understand and just put it on the shelf,
[1:00:26] you know. Um but sometimes the Lord
[1:00:29] waits until a certain time in your life
[1:00:32] where it will help you the most
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; for the kingdom of God's sake and then
[1:00:36] he reveals it to you. Amen. And often
[1:00:39] often at least in in my experience,
[1:00:41] brother, maybe maybe yours as well,
[1:00:43] usually it'll come with more revelation
[1:00:44] with other revelations. Amen. One thing
[1:00:47] will open more things. Amen.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. at least in my life things I I
[1:00:53] didn't quite understand. Um, and then
[1:00:55] when the Lord showed me and and and
[1:00:58] opened my understanding, then it it it
[1:01:00] was like a domino effect. Well, now I
[1:01:02] understand this and and that makes sense
[1:01:04] because of this, you know, and then you
[1:01:05] see it through the scripture and you see
[1:01:07] it. You see the Lord confirm it. Amen.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; But sometimes he waits until just the
[1:01:11] appointed time when you need it the
[1:01:13] most, not realizing it. You don't know
[1:01:15] that, but he knows it. Amen.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's it's it's the time for
[1:01:19] revelation. the the revelation in its
[1:01:21] due season.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. We uh if we
[1:01:27] wait on the Lord, he'll give us that
[1:01:28] spiritual food. It's spiritual food in
[1:01:30] due season. Amen.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:33] Amen. Always at the right time. Thank
[1:01:35] the Lord. Um and in Psalm 145 and uh
[1:01:40] verses 15-19
[1:01:45] it says the eyes of all wait upon thee
[1:01:48] and thou givest them their meat in due
[1:01:50] season. Hallelujah. Uh all creation
[1:01:53] waits on the Lord uh including us. We
[1:01:55] wait on him. Uh he feeds the birds of
[1:01:57] the air, you know, the beasts of the
[1:01:59] field. He he provides them meat, food,
[1:02:02] you know, and um and and so do we. We we
[1:02:05] rely on the Lord to to give us our daily
[1:02:08] bread and to give us spiritual bread.
[1:02:10] Amen.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And he he gives them
[1:02:12] their meat in due season. Praise the
[1:02:14] Lord. Thou openest thine hand and
[1:02:16] satisfies the desire of every living
[1:02:18] thing. Hallelujah. The Lord is righteous
[1:02:21] in all his ways, and holy in all his
[1:02:24] works. Amen.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; The Lord is nigh unto all them that call
[1:02:27] upon him, to all that call upon him in
[1:02:30] truth. He will fulfill the desire of
[1:02:32] them that fear him. He also will hear
[1:02:35] their cry and will save them. Amen. What
[1:02:38] did Jesus say? Blessed are they that
[1:02:39] hunger and thirst after righteousness,
[1:02:41] for they shall be filled. Amen.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You're you're blessed
[1:02:45] just for hungering and thirst for
[1:02:47] thirsting for righteousness.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. We're we're
[1:02:52] going to wind this down here if you'd
[1:02:53] stand to your feet. Praise God.

[1:03:00] a a time in our lives and and and and
[1:03:04] throughout history, you know, in our
[1:03:06] day, in our age, and in our personal
[1:03:08] life, times and seasons that he he
[1:03:10] reveals things exactly when they need to
[1:03:13] be revealed.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. In order that his purpose might be
[1:03:16] accomplished and and that his people
[1:03:18] might be helped and edified, Amen. And
[1:03:21] that his plan will be revealed. Amen. To
[1:03:24] those that he loves. Amen.
[1:03:26] Praise the Lord. He He desires to to

[1:03:41] season? Spiritual food in due season.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knows all things. He's He knew
[1:03:46] the end from the beginning. Amen. It was
[1:03:48] all all according to his fornowledge. He
[1:03:51] predestined these things and and and
[1:03:53] appointed times and seasons. Praise the
[1:03:55] Lord for his word. So shall my word be.
[1:03:58] He said that goeth forth out of my mouth
[1:04:00] and shall accomplish that whereto I send
[1:04:03] it.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And you know if if faith
[1:04:08] comes by hearing the word, Amen. then
[1:04:11] then uh rapturing faith must also come
[1:04:13] from the word. Amen. And remember
[1:04:16] brothers and sisters like uh like we
[1:04:17] were saying, remember the unic? He was
[1:04:19] already in the word. Amen. Already
[1:04:21] searching the scriptures and the Lord,
[1:04:23] that's why the Lord could send him a man
[1:04:25] with with a a message that could teach
[1:04:27] him the scripture because he was in the
[1:04:28] scripture.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; How are we going to catch a revelation
[1:04:31] of of a rapture if we're not in the
[1:04:32] word, brothers and sisters? It's a word
[1:04:34] revelation. Amen.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; It's feasting on the word to make a word
[1:04:38] body.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; So, the the rapturing faith also comes
[1:04:44] by the word. Amen. But it's going to be
[1:04:45] at an appointed time. Amen. and it'll be
[1:04:48] it'll be made manifest unto us.

[1:04:52] brothers and sisters.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll we'll we'll wind it down
[1:04:55] right there. And there's a I know
[1:04:57] there's a much more we could we could
[1:04:59] say on this here, but I I trust the Lord
[1:05:02] has helped get the uh the point across
[1:05:04] here that that there's a time for
[1:05:07] revelation, a time for things to come to
[1:05:09] pass. And remember, we are we are in a
[1:05:12] time of there's turmoil, there's
[1:05:15] insanity,
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; there's um There's unknown things, you
[1:05:19] know, just crazy things, you know, and
[1:05:21] unsuities and men's hearts failing them
[1:05:23] for fear and and and and all these
[1:05:26] things and in diverse places and you
[1:05:29] know, you don't know what's the truth in
[1:05:30] the in the news anyway. We know what the
[1:05:31] truth is, but you never know who's
[1:05:33] telling you the truth, you know, on the
[1:05:35] global scheme of things. But what Jesus
[1:05:37] say, why are you troubled? Why do
[1:05:39] thoughts arise in your heart? Amen. Uh
[1:05:42] and like we heard this morning, don't
[1:05:43] you know your heavenly father knows what
[1:05:45] you have need of? Amen. Yes.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Don't you think that he that chose you
[1:05:48] will take care of you? Amen.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; He didn't he didn't bring us this far
[1:05:52] like the song says to leave us.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; He didn't teach us to swim to let us
[1:05:56] drown. Amen.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; He didn't build his home in us in us in
[1:06:00] us just to move away. Amen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He didn't pick us up to let
[1:06:04] us down.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad? He
[1:06:07] He's got a a purpose for us. He He
[1:06:09] already knows.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he sent his word for us. It

[1:11:44] own interpreter,
[1:11:46] Lord. And you interpret your word by

[1:11:52] these things that that happen all around
[1:11:54] the world, just wickedness and evil.
[1:11:58] Lord, just complete evil and insanity.

[1:12:02] grounded in all faith, believing, oh
[1:12:05] God. Built up into Christ.

[1:12:15] your hand. Lord, uphold us by the
[1:12:17] strength of your right hand. Lord,

[1:12:22] gracious to us. Lord, I pray you're
[1:12:24] you're so faithful and wonderful to us.

[1:12:27] Lord? We commit these people to you,
[1:12:30] Father. All this the word that you've
[1:12:34] given us, we thank you for it. And now
[1:12:35] we want to let you let it be watered
[1:12:38] with praise and with worship. And we
[1:12:40] receive it and give thanks for the word,
[1:12:42] Lord. And may you receive all the glory.
