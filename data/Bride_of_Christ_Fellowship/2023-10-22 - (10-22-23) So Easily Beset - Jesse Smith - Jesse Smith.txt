our faith Is Risen Lord God our faith is in the promises of God so bless us here in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise God let's stand and take our Bibles here we'll go to Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 I don't remember when it was but I just U was reading this and those three three words in Hebrews 12:1 really stood out to me I just want to preach on those three words so easily beset I just want to preach on those three words here today it's kind of like the it's kind of like the uh the part where we are our Humanity right so we just want to focus on that part about the humanity and of course you know encourage you at the end uh with the spirit of God that lives inside you but I just want to emphasize those three words I thought it was inspired here Hebrews 12:1 so look forward to uh this evening we'll do a a service I'm going to just do some teaching on uh youth scriptures because we were at brother cams last Sunday and he really preached a I called it a masterpiece now that doesn't mean it was perfect but he really preached a wonderful message um on youth you know and how um how God you know wants the youth to be examed you know and it was really a fantastic it was fully truly anointed service you know and going into the service cam had asked me about preaching and and he's he's and I said well I said just go with how you feel led he said I feel led to preach I said well that's good then you go ahead and preach you know and he he certainly I told him I said you really had the leading of the Lord it was really a a tremendous message I listened to part of it yesterday I'll I encourage everybody to listen to it I'll maybe I'll send the link out but I was really inspired by that message last week and so Lord willing tonight will do some teaching on that Hebrews 12 vers1 let's read uh verse one together and we'll have you be seated here trying to watch the time here by God's grace one two 3 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that was set before us amen may God has blessing to re his word you may be seated praise God there's a few other things I'd like to share eventually maybe I'll share them tonight by God's grace when we're not in the live service but I do want to share a few more things about you know the recent events of this week uh I'll be sharing those Lord willing then tonight uh by God's grace but I just want to look at this thought here so easily beset and as I said this is the human side of the Christian um you know many times uh you know when uh we go through battles we go through trials that's when we see some of our shortcomings um and so I just want to just focus on that for a little bit uh you know there's times you know I just want to encourage you you know and and uh I I want to I want to do that as often as we need it you know by the Holy Spirit um and I'll definitely encourage you as well in this sermon but I just thought it'd be just appropriate as I was looking at some of these things and some of the things I heard preach at brother cams and as I've heard you know even listening myself uh I thought I would bring these out and look at you know just this idea of you know so easily beset you know sometimes we uh we we we fight the devil so hard you know sometimes we give everything we got you know to to fight the enemy and the Bible says we should the Bible says uh that we fight the good fight of faith our fight is not a fight in vain it's a good fight praise God God wants us to fight with everything that we have Hallelujah we want to give all of our strength Hallelujah uh to winning this fight amen and you know God gave us great weapons to fight praise God God gave us you know six uh six uh attributes here and let me turn to as I Ephesians chapter 6 there's six attributes in uh to overcoming Satan the Bible says we do not wrestle against flesh and blood and I'm just kind of uh feeling led to go read dead again he said take the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in that evil day and having done all stand and so you know God gives us all the equipment that we need to overcome the Bible says stand with your loins gir about with the truth and having on the breastplate of of righteousness so we need truth if we're going to overcome the enemy praise God hallelujah we need we need the righteousness of Christ Hallelujah then the Bible says feet shod with the preparation the gospel of peace Hallelujah so we have to have the gospel of peace Hallelujah and we need the shield of faith that will quench every fiery Dart of the wicked Hallelujah we need to hold this Shield of Faith Hallelujah that's right and then we need the helmet of salvation Hallelujah knowing that we're saved right we need the protection of our minds that we're saved and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God hallelujah we've been given the greatest armor brother R said you know if if America wouldn't send our troops with the best weapons that they had how much more will God give us the best weapons that we need hallelujah praise God thank God and he sure he he surely does he certainly does but then there's times church when I'll say like this sometimes we don't seek God like we ought to and sometimes uh you know and it's greatly expressed in some of these Lamplighter books we've got you know uh you know and uh sometimes the Warriors are they're tempted by the enemy to lay down their sword right uh what's that favorite one that I I like not the Giant Killer sir nameless the one that cist was in yeah Ser of The Splendid way it's probably my favorite Lamplighter there but all throughout the entire Journey he's constantly tempted the and the enem is saying oh the armor is too heavy take off your armor oh set your shield down this is a time of rejoicing and there are and there are times of rejoicing right but but it's a temptation of the enemy to put put down the shield and and to not fight against him right but a Christian uh they're aware that the Bible said Satan's like a roaring lion seeking who whom he may devour and we just read there that there there's evil days that come upon us right there's some days of great peace there are some days of great Victory Hallelujah like we looked at King ASA 10 years of Peace Hallelujah and as I told you I feel like we're in a season of Peace where we've had five years at least five years of Peace Hallelujah and it's been a joy but we got to be careful not to be tempted to lay down our armor and not fight like God has called us to fight praise God uh but you know these these words uh just really stuck out to me so easily beset now the word beset in the Greek just means surrounded and so that word maybe uh maybe needs to maybe have a different meaning for this context because the Bible says we're so easily beset the sin which so easily besets us we'd say so easily surrounds us and so we get this idea if you look at a he Webster's Dictionary the word beset in our current language the current meaning means trouble or harassed we are so easily troubled we feel so easily harassed by sin sometimes don't we right and uh that's kind of what I bring out here you know with our human side I just want to just preach one message on this you know there so so many times when we fall into sin you know it it wasn't that difficult of a battle right it wasn't some elaborate you know the Bible says when we sin sometimes we're it's called a snare we're caught in a trap you know this week I caught another mouse at our house you know it wasn't a very elaborate trap I just put peanut butter and set it on the Trap and then I taped it down to the ground and just like clockwork every time I got him you know it wasn't very elaborate it wasn't you know all these tunnels he had to walk through or mirrors or smoke or fire it was just peanut butter just laid out and I didn't hide in the corner I didn't I just laid it right out in the middle of the floor and it was so easily he was so easily trapped or maybe it was a her I don't know but the point I'm making is that church sometimes the enemy sets out sets out bait for us and we're so easily trapped into it we don't fight it like we ought to now what I find find interesting is in the previous chapter Paul gives us the Hall of Fame of Faith praise God hallelujah and he gives us all these the Bible called them cloud of witnesses he gives us all these cloud of witnesses each and every each and every testimony that's up there praise God you know you look out in the sky yesterday uh uh we had some beautiful weather there you know it kind of off and on partly cloudy but the other day must have been Friday where it was such a beautiful day and I thought look at all these clouds and I was just sitting there and seeing them them by and that's what the Bible calls all the testimonies of all the saints there's these clouds all around us all we got to do is look up and see the the testimony of the Saints who've gone before us praise God Amen they're just covering you know many many times they're just covering the sky and that's how that's the imagery that Paul gives us and just just look listen to some of these names Abel we have Abel's testimony up there right even though my brother doesn't Worship in spirit and Truth I'll Worship in spirit and Truth amen even if I lose my life I'm willing to stand upon the word of God I'm willing to worship with the Revelation I was taught by by God almighty praise God Enoch he was translated that he wouldn't taste death he he his name means dedicated he was so dedicated that he pleased God that God took him off the Earth Hallelujah that's one of those clouds that's one of those testimonies up there that we can look up to and we can be encouraged by Enoch Hallelujah now we'll get some other ones where you know may maybe uh we see more of their failures Noah the Bible said he found Grace in the sight of the Lord and probably for 120 years he hammered away I like that song we used to sing Noah hammered away praise God he didn't give into what the people said praise God he caught the Revelation the Bible said he built 120 years to save his house in other words he wasn't just doing this for himself he was doing it for his family and church that's what we should do we should serve God give everything we got for other people to serve others praise God Amen Hallelujah but remember here's what I want to bring out but then afterwards he was so easily beset by by alcohol here's a man of God he just saw God provide and and protect his family he saved eight souls he saw the rest of the world die but then he was so easily beset by getting drunk so easily beset it wasn't some elaborate it wasn't some elaborate deception but it was just getting too comfortable I we we're not given the whole uh we're not giv the whole details of the situation but think about that drink then he had to start feeling a little intoxicated right but then he had another and another and another and it actually led to one of his relatives being cursed right Canaan because he walked into Saul his father's nakedness now there's a couple different interpretations on that but look it was it was he's a hero of the faith but there was times he's easily beset as well easily troubled now maybe going through all that all the destruction maybe that caused him to drink a little extra we're not really given the the situation but what I'm saying is that in one way we can see them as Heroes but we also can see how they can easily fall remind remind you of anybody that you know that you might have looked and saw in the mirror this morning who could be a hero of Faith but also so easily beset and Paul doesn't say well just the food foolish virgins are so easy beset did he did he say that no he doesn't say that yet he taught there's the four kinds of vessels he taught that we can see that plainly taught in the scripture but he says let us so he's speaking of the whole body of Christ Hallelujah he says let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us so just so easily beset it wasn't it wasn't a maybe a difficult mind battle or or something and and in Noah's case you know and we'll get to Abraham and Sarah maybe maybe some of these weren't the most elaborate uh tricks that Satan tried to pull and like we'll see later some of these were not even life and death like Noah's you know getting drunk it wasn't even a life or death situation it was just do I have another drink or do I stop right there wasn't he wasn't being threatened by an enemy well if you don't drink this we're going to take the sword and we're going to end your life it wasn't that it was caught up in just the the cares of Life how many battle the cares of life sometimes let me read this again I found this you again this morning I was praying and I just in the closet and I just went to that I thought I look that up remember brother R said each age has its pressures he said the B the great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches so whenever you feel this pressure I've got to be rich or I need to be rich that's a battle you got to overcome the second one he says he says is soft living I find that to be the I was thinking this morning I find that one to be the hardest one I got to battle soft living in other words you're not really uh pressing with all you got you know you you lose the urgency of the Holy Spirit right to cease to be I'm saying to see people saved or how about this to see people healed we lose the urgency to really live on on fire as best as we possibly can I hope I'm communicating that the right way it's easier just to relax and you know know uh just try to relax and get ready for the next day right you know you want to be strong for the next day so we find that second one the third one nervous tensions you ever had that where you you have difficulty sleeping just worried about this this I had that on Friday night but my wife reminded me I drink too much coffee that's probably why I was up nervous but my mind was racing uh I think I fell finally fell asleep around 4:30 on on on Saturday morning just mind and I I went wrote down some thoughts in fact this is the some of the sermon thoughts I was going to preach I'm like well if I'm up I might as well do some notes might as well make some notes for the sermon but these are real demonic attacks of nervous tensions it's a demonic attack right soft living live softer live a more relaxed life and then you got to get rich you got to get rich right these are all demonic attacks for this age but we can overcome them praise God Amen Hallelujah the next one in this Hall of Fame this next cloud of witness was Abraham and Sarah we all we s i they have some of the most powerful testimonies 99 years old 100 years old and 70 and 90 having a child at 90 years old Hallelujah my Abraham having faith that even though I'm 125 I don't see it yet I'm going to have descendants like the numbers of the stars and the numbers of the sand of the sea that's our father of Faith praise God but then also so easily beset so easily falling into cowardice now brothers that's especially true for us right because we're supposed to be strong all the time and we're supposed to protect everybody all the time right Brothers but it but the reality of it is we're going to battle to be real strong and heroic right we got a Satan's attacking us trying to make us cowards like Abraham was made a coward is that true so he but see he was so easily beset now his battles were his battles were over the fear of life and death right with pharaoh and then aimc he was afraid they would kill him but he never actually had to go through that he said let's lie let's tell a half truth right man let's tell a half truth or let's lie because I think you see he was crossing Bridges before he got there amen he never actually you know had had the sword held right to him and said you know is she your wife or not he never never really had that but to avoid that to avoid the sword for us to avoid the gun or to avoid the bull bullet he lied and was cowardly in advance he was so easily beset and the sword wasn't even in front of him so he planned ahead to lie planned ahead to be a coward that's what brother Braham said right but we've all been there right we've all we've all fallen short of God's glory so we're not hammering Abraham but just bringing out this idea he was so easily beset but yet he in the Hall of Fame Hallelujah yet there was times where he showed great faith Hallelujah in the midst of great adversity and I love it again I'm going to rehearse it because God helped him to believe he couldn't believe on his own faith was a gift from God and faith will be a gift from God to you hallelujah amen God's going to help you believe Hallelujah if he helped the father you know he's going to help the children Hallelujah but so easily beset church so are we we're so easily beset on the pressure to be rich the pressure to live a soft life the pressure to be nervous about things all the time and we've got to overcome that by God's grace we're so easily beset at times and that means trouble we're so easily troubled so easily harassed so easily surrounded by the difficulties in our life think about David you know and basba he was so easy easily beset right by by the Temptation Of basba so easy nobody forced him to take her he actually called for her by name so easily it was so easy just to skip going out to war to skip the battle talk about soft living right so easily that's one I had there on my notes there too but then we see Moses you know a murder of course before his burning bush experience but even after the burning bush tremendous Miracles I mean i' we'd put his miracles up there with with anybody right other than Jesus right because nobody did more miracles than Jesus and even Mo Jesus would be a prophet like unto Moses parting the Red Sea I mean amazing things calling for plagues and uh calling for for Li and calling for all these things but there was times he was so easily beset remember when he smoked that rock the Bible said he let the people provoke him right remember in cases God never forces anybody to fall so it was it was partly Moses's fault but it was partly the people's fault right so both of them were at fault Moses should not have let the people persuade him he should have had courage well if you're going to be negative I'm going to be positive Hallelujah I'm not going to let your unbelief impact me I'm still going to love you even though you're not being very lovable right now and the church said right family members they're not being real lovable but you should still love them I should still love them praise God and I shouldn't let their unbelief hinder my faith and most of times we don't but there are times when we're so easily troubled and that's the point of this message I kind of want to bring those out so easily beset Moses was so easily beset at times but the Bible said by faith Moses by faith brother amen can I put you in there I'll put the brothers by faith Austin Hallelujah by faith Jose by faith bang next time I'll do sisters on the next service okay put your name in there by faith Malachi Zion and James and Andy all the men we'll put them in there by faith but we still have that we're still children of Faith but we're often so easily beset and brother B tells us well the Bible tells us to it too many times we fall when everything's going good right the Bible said when Israel was Idol right when they didn't have a battle to fight when they weren't praying and crying out for food when they had plenty of food when they had plenty of water when they had all these things that's when they were easily beset so we got to look at that's and that's that's what you know I believe each service has a purpose so we got to look at our our purpose today look at our condition today at the end of the service here and see what kind of condition are we in and let's make sure we're not easily beset I would say for me things are going pretty good I had a weekend off last weekend that was nice I guess I got one coming up here by God's grace so thank you very very very kind of you I appreciate that um but you know all all the bills are paid thank God hallelujah thank God food's on the table children don't lack any clothes or anything so I would say this is timely for me because I want to be seeking God I just heard heard A good sermon you know from Brother cam a fantastic message and I want to preach another message that'll bless your hearts too amen but that's where we kind of find ourselves you know in this spot where uh we have all that we have as far as I know everybody in the church has everything that they have need of and if not please let me know as a pastor that's my job I don't I don't know what I'm doing here forgive me you know and even brother brandham you know we talked about brother brandom uh many times but just let's review what did he battle with the most which Spirit did he battle with the most the critical spirit right he said those are the three he battled the most and brother said out of the three that usually get preachers women money popularity he said the one that he struggled with the most was the money he said that's why he tried to give it just all away you know as much as possible right so that gives us a good lesson whatever thing we struggle with the most let's put the most effort in to make sure we don't give into it praise God but according to him the one he said the one I struggle the most is the critical spirit so you know looking at others I'll say that you know just looking at others and being more judgmental than we should does in the Bible say uh let your words be seasoned with Grace that's why you know I've got to I want to say that too about you know the Brandon family like I said you know I want to be uh you know my my wife helped me I was talking to her about it and she kind of just brought that Grace and I was like thank you for the reminder thank you for the reminder because we have to season our words with Grace I find it very similar I think that's a i i battle that as well a critical spirit sometimes and I feel like as as message Believers we can't help but battle that because we we know more about the word of God right we we know more but that also that makes us uh uh gives us more opportunity but it also makes us more responsible right and it also makes us more accountable to God remember the teachers the preachers will be judged the harshest right and then and then as as I preach and as our preachers preach brother Brian and all the saints it makes us more accountable so I thought it'd be helpful to share this thought here uh by the grace of God and then after Moses you know goes into Joshua and Israel and Joshua was a very wonderful type of Christ uh and remember we only have a couple times where Joshua was ever recorded as falling short and the one time Joshua fell short is the one time he didn't go ask God about it right so it encouraged us let's pray about each and every decision let's pray about every decision let's lay it before the Lord and that's what I kind of felt L after hearing cam sermon I told my children I said I want to pray for all the youth tonight so after the Bible study I want each youth person to come up and let's just pray God's blessing on them especially for the older ones getting older here because they got big decisions coming up and I want to pray now before the the evil days come well let's hope there's no big evil days as far as you know I'm talking about really awful trials or difficult trials I want to pray for them now by God's grace I want to make more time for prayer now while I can and so uh and then you know the Bible goes into other Heroes of the Faith Like Rahab now of course she got converted we don't know of any mistakes she made afterwards where she was so easily beset but here we got Gideon and Sams of Hebrews 11 Gideon and Samson Gideon was was Mighty after a great Victory he took too many wives he set up that uh he set up something and become an idol to the people forget what it was now slip in my mind book of life I just Tex texted Z about that this morning amen every person that really believes their names at least in The Book of Life but God's other section it's called the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah the people that were truly washed in the blood their entire lives completely scriptural but we see even Samson and we went through his mistakes a few weeks ago when we preached once more Lord but even he was placed in the Hall of Fame of faith yet he was so easily beset by women right how about by anger when he went and killed all those Philistines together set them on fire you know he was really angry anybody ever battle temper you don't have to raise your hand anybody battle anybody ever battle temper and sometimes you know we're so easy beset you know I was I I love I love though the seasons where you look back and you C you kind of like wake up from the Victory and you're like wow God has given me Grace I've overcome that all week i' I haven't struggled with that for a few weeks or my I haven't struggled with that for a year amen is't that beautiful and that's ought to be an encouragement God has given me strength in other words I've been putting on the armor of God hallelujah I've been holding the shield I've been uh uh the Bible says uh taking every fiery Dart hallelujah amen quenching there it is that's the word I was looking for quenching every fiery Dart every every trial that's come that's come I've been able to quench it by the shield of Faith hallelujah amen amen and that's what I like to do church I like to look at my life and say wow thank God you to reflect on that and say thank you Jesus so easily and you're think I just danced at church now that would be for me or whoever likes to dance I just danced at church or I just wept at the altar I just prayed for that or we just had a testimony and then we can be so easily beset not long after I just want you to know that's the normal Christian experience amen don't let the devil tell you you're not a part of Christ we are a part of Christ amen but this flesh won't be until it gets swallowed up amen hallelujah and it's going to be this body will be swallowed up in life Hallelujah this body is filled with death right now but one day this body will be filled with eternal life amen hallelujah this is the normal Christian experience overcoming Faith uh quenching the fiery darts but then we so easily get beset so easily troubled and this is not you know just for certain people this is for all Christians we can especially see it you know brother R's life because he told us right and so and can especially so see it in our lives and maybe in one another's lives but we don't want to focus on the negative so much but we just want to recognize this is part of the Christian experience Hallelujah and so you know the book of Hebrews 11 ends that way and these men you know they were they had such a testimony the Bible said the world was not worthy of them I gave that example of you know Andy and Eileen and you know Drive in two hours to bring us a truckload of frozen food when we had I think it was Caris and a whole I mean the whole back of the truck was filled with frozen food and we just had enough room in the freezer you know and and I thought well to me to me that was a great sacrifice and I started crying and I and we had all that room in the freezer we we must have just got the freezer but I think of that of whom the world was not worthy Christians uh you know we are the salt of the earth the whole world all the Sinners have no salt they have no taste they have no real experience of Love or no real experience of of any type of of Christian character but you and I have it praise God and the world's not worthy of it praise God it's not the Bible said they subdued kingdoms they wrought righteousness they obtained promises amen they stopped the mouths of lions they quenched the violence of fire they escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong vax I'm sorry waxed Valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might attain a better Resurrection others had Trials of cruel mockings and scourgings uh bonds and imprisonment some went to jail some were stoned some were under tempted slain with the sword they wandered around and sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and mountains and dens and caves of the earth and after and these all having obtained a good report through faith Reed not the promise because not perfect the entire body without us as well praise God now listen they didn't live in Lea we do we can look to this spiritually and we can see we've got to overcome all the spiritual obstacles that we Face praise God hallelujah we've got to overcome that we're the age where where Paul users a wax word worse and worse so we're in an age it's the living see where we're where we're at by God's grace and then overcome with the word of God hallelujah amen and remember God steps to strength we looked at it in uh in Joshua 1 Step One is repent and be humble number two is and number three is keep all the commands constantly speaking and meditating upon them and that's that's where the Joshua Army the Joshua church will stay strong by doing those three things praise God I think it's interesting brother R list three trials in leoa but then we in Joshua we can see three steps to be strong praise God I think it's interesting don't you Hallelujah you know I uh I want to read a couple things here also Lord I wrote down numerous uh thoughts I want to let's go to Hebrews 12 now I just want to go into a few of these make sure I preach these I kind of felt inspired here verse one Hebrews 12 1 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us I just want to bring out a simple illustration okay every some of you remember when Malachi and Austin and I were racing out there you remember that it's a day I wish I could forget but you know we got out there on the line right we stretched out and then we started running we were running pretty fast at any time did you ever see one of us you know stop and and pick up a big rock or something and try to run with that did anybody ever see us do that no we I might even took off my jacket you know I I might have even got on some different shoes you know in other words you just lay everything aside so you can try to win the race and so I just thought you know I was praying up here I thought now what if I would have went down there and I would I said okay brothers let's run this race now on your mark get set I I don't have much room here go and I try to run with that what kind of Runner do you think I'd be you think I'd win nature no I didn't even win the first time how am I going to run with this this this great weight and church this is spiritually what's going on we're seeing other people run the RAC now sometimes we're running it the right way we're going good we're we're tearing it up you know we're we're making some good splits you know we we're sweating we're having a good race but there's sometimes where we pick up a burden that we shouldn't have to carry God didn't call us to carry that burden so imagine just picture your mind out there imagine me trying to race come on malkey I mean I wouldn't be looking back I'd be looking forth come on wait up Malachi right we'd be trying to run a race with this big huge burden the Bible said don't try to run with the burdens the Bible said lay aside the burdens lay aside picture that uh you know we've all been to races you ever see a racer get on his backpack and well let's race now with this backpack on well now they basically strip them down right you know basically have them wear short shorts and tank tops they try to get as much weight off as possible that's a natural thing but it's it's showing us a spiritual truth the Bible says lay it all aside and run the race with perseverance how many want to how many want to win the race by God's grace well then it's clear we've got to lay aside not some weights but every weight praise God Amen Hallelujah lay aside every weight every year when I go in for my uh my annual checkup at the doctor over there in green I go see the dror saers in green I always want to know my real weight so I'll make sure I take off you know my shoes and my I got a jacket on a sweatshirt and I'll even empty out my pockets now think about that I'll take out my pen my I'll take off my watch I'll take off my phone I want to know the exact way I want to I want the I want the precise way have I lived a healthy year or not you know that's kind of what I want to know where am I at compared to last year and I I'll I'll lay aside every I'll take everything out I'll take my shoes off I don't want any extra weight I want to know the exact weight now that should be a great lesson for us spiritually as well praise God I don't want any extra weight holding me down I want to know exactly where I stand praise God that's what we see here and it's and that's the illustration we see all these Cloud man there is the illustration is we're running and we can look up and we can be encouraged we can look at Samson's testimony by faith he he fulfilled God's promise for his life in his very last breaths even though he had to wait till the very end of his life God still helped him to fulfill every promise for his life amen despite times of failure despite times of embarrassment despite times of being so easily beset he became a cloud Hallelujah he became a witness that we can all look to and say God's not finished with me yet praise God Hallelujah despite any fears despite any trials he's not done with me God's word will be fulfilled praise God Amen and so the Bible tells us to run but keep looking up look at all those testimonies oh if they did it I can do it too praise God am and lay aside any weight that easily besets us so for brother bam he had to lay aside the critical spirit he said one time he said I'm coming to the pulpit with a critical spirit pray for me that I'll lay it in other words pray for me that I'll lay it aside my goodness Hallelujah pray for me that I'll lay aside now I'll say like this you know with these these families and the message of the lost people they probably got to lay aside some confusion and pain you imagine they lost their mother she's 44 or they lost their their father he was 88 and the enemy is going to try to say take up this get bitter towards God and they're they're saying why did you take my mom why imagine they were tempted to run with the weight and God's saying don't please don't take up that weight it's hard I'm not saying it's easy I'm saying even in a situation like that with death the enemy is tempting he's trying to easily beset people well God owes me something or God should not have done that that's a Temptation that's a trap that's a snare to try to get somebody to run inhibited we want to run a race without any inhibitions praise God we want to run free Hallelujah we want to be free and clear Hallelujah the deodorant laundry picked that up free and clear well that's how a Christian is amen we always my wife always tells me well I used to tell me buy the Free and Clear Laundry I said that's what I am that's what I'm a Christian I'm free in the Holy Spirit and my account is clear amen hallelujah all my sins been washed away praise God hallelujah I'm free the son has made me free indeed Hallelujah so I just thought I'd demonstrate that you could see that this is what God wants us to do he doesn't want us to run with burdens and I'm talking about sinful burdens I'm not talking about I've got a burden to see my dad saved you know we got burden to see our dad's and you know our mother saved that's that's all good those are all good burdens that that's not what it's talking about it's about a sin that easily entraps you so brother Ram told us he was easily uh trapped or easily entrapped with critical spirit right Samson easily trapped by L right and each person you know uh Abraham easily entrapped by being afraid fearful coward that was just something he easily fell into right but God was faithful through it all I love this you know God would always make a way out of their mistakes Hallelujah now they'd have to live with their mistakes like David that was was one of the most awful ones because once murder and things there's you know the sword would never leave his house in other words that was a really awful mistake right there but even in that David said I know blessed is a man whom God will not impute sin Hallelujah and God gives the remedy for that go to Psalm 32:5 therea Psalm 32:5 God gives the remedy I'm sorry that's me I don't moving this wire so Psalm 32:5 see we have to acknowledge the times we've so easily given into sin we just have to acknowledge it and then lay it aside right people you know I I've had to do this I've had to lay aside you know hatred for my dad I told you that in the past I've just got to lay it aside I can't I can't hang on to that right and whatever we may battle you know lay aside disappointments or like I said with Samson lay aside lust L lay aside uh doubts or anger like we said earlier somebody really angry they just they're tempted to be angry those just have to be laid aside and I'm not going to hang on to this anger because we got a choice church I'm not going to hang on to this I'm going to lay it aside I'm going to run for Jesus I acknowledge my sin unto thee I acknowledge that I carried this burden this burden of sin I acknowledg I had a critical spirit Lord and my iniquity have I not hid I told the Lord all about my sin I said I will confess my transgression unto the Lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin saah amen say hallelujah praise God so it's very simple I acknowledge it it was my I knew better I should not have done it it was iniquity but God forgave me hallelujah amen hallelujah that's the grace of our God and that was under the blood of bulls and goats amen what about the blood of Jesus Hallelujah for this shall for this shall everyone that's Godly how many Godly in here you should all have your hands up Godly to be like God you're like God you believe the word you love the word everyone that's Godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found this is still the time to pray Hallelujah God can be found right now surely in the floods of Great Waters they shall not come nigh unto him see God will keep us from some of these great awful tests awful trials I love verse seven Thou Art my Hiding Place when I need to escape the troubles when I need to escape these weights God is my Escape God is where I find peace when I want to silence all these voices when I want to overcome all the Mind battles I got one place I hide that's in Jesus hallelujah hallelujah I know where to run Hallelujah to get away from all these voices I know where to go when all these fiery darts are are are are being fired at me I know where to go I hide in Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's right Thou shalt preserve me from trouble now remember some of the troubles we pick up ourselves the the sin that so so do easily trouble us see some of them we choose to pick up I like what Cam said about the cell phone just reminded me of you know sometimes we pick up and we sin with things on our phones of course we all go we all do that at times I like what Cam said you know Cam said last week he said I'm preaching so long he said uh but I'm not going to apologize he said because if you're watching your favorite show on YouTube you wouldn't be sleeping that's a good one brother I like that I'm going to use that at church right if you're watching your for me if I was watching my favorite political guy you know kind of share the news events I wouldn't be sleeping I wouldn't be yawning I wouldn't be biting my nails you know I'd be watching oh what happened today what happened today Thou Art my Hiding Place Thou shalt Compass me about with songs of Deliverance like like so many times God has brother amen sing songs of Deliverance yes he did so yes he can Hallelujah God's you know I'm gonna I'm going to struggle I'm going to fight but God's going to bring songs of Deliverance I'm going to be surrounded by those praise God hallelujah that's what's going to encourage me is songs of Deliverance he set me free yes he set me free glory to God he set me free Hallelujah that's what we need I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which Thou shalt go this is speaking of God is going to direct your life like you might not know which way to go today you might not know which decision to make but God said if you confess your sins if if I'm your hiding place I'll tell you which way to go Hallelujah I'll tell you I'll teach you I'll show you I'll instruct you this is the way you go but I've got to be your Hiding Place hallelujah thank God I will guide thee with mine eye I think I preached on that the eye of God last year if I'm not mistaken one of the most complex I think there was what 100 million light sensors in the eye picking up all the light giving us the the and brother Brian preach on Focus didn't he preach on focus is that right I thought I that's right I heard that amen if anybody knows how to focus it's God hallelujah God will instruct us verse n be not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding whose mouth must be held in with bit and Bridal lest they come near unto thee so the Bible says with when you have understanding you don't have to be beaten around by God God don't have to push you around right God don't have to force you to do something God has taught you how to do it and you as a a Believer with understanding you can choose okay I don't want to go into sin I don't want to run the race with with with burdens I want to run it without burdens and now I know which way to run because I'm not a mule I'm not a a human horse right I have understanding verse 10 many sorrow shall be to the wicked did see Church you know that that's what we're so thankful for God has kept us from so many Sorrows so many Sorrows but he that trusts in the Lord Mercy shall Compass my so not only do I have songs of Deliverance compassing me I've got God's mercy around me too amen because I trust in God hallelujah verse 11 be glad in the Lord and rejoice ye righteous and Shout for Joy all you that are upright in heart praise God so see even when we're so easily beset or troubled by sins we have the way out acknowledge my sin right make Christ my Hiding Place receive his instruction with understanding praise God and then be glad and rejoice in the Lord amen amen be glad he's forgiven you all your sins Hallelujah heyen ah it's beautiful just to see it laid out there plainly in scripture now brother cam brought out the Deeds of nickan going to a few of those uh scriptures out here go to Romans Revelation Chapter 2 Revelation Chapter 2 now it's in verse six is where I want to look at there Revelation 2 verse6 this is the message to the Ephesian Church age and I just want to bring this out there was a four-step uh you remember the four step process through the first four Church ages but I thought it was applicable for us it says but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I also hate now remember the word nicolan means to conquer the leoty so Jesus hates when the Ley are taken out of the anointing of the Holy Spirit and all the anointings just in the preacher that's the main that's the main emphasis brother R puts on that scripture right the preachers are the only ones with gifts the preachers are the only one with power oh that's the biggest bunch of nonsense praise God everybody's got power here amen everybody's got faith here hallelujah God's done uh miracles in everybody's life Hallelujah we still got Jose's testimony record and brother bang you know for the podcast by God's grace we just finished my wife's this week here and so we and Z yeah we all want to yeah maybe be at too if she wants to I go she's m you're welcome to but it's it's this uh it's everybody has a part in the ministry of God hallelujah everybody everyone uh should be led by the Holy Spirit to do something for God like I feel led to preach I feel led to Pastor feel led to pray for the sick I I feel led to do those things each one of us should feel led to do something praise God don't matter what it is it just matters that you're led to do it praise God and then you do it the best that you possibly can for God's glory okay but uh some of the examples uh and you know or let me just go through the remember there's four steps in the first four Church ages these things that Jesus hates starts out as Deeds which means they're not doctrines yet they're just sayings brother Ram says he says they move away from the Holy Ghost leadership and they take man's leadership okay so anything that was a deed okay now brother Ram gave a few examples he gave it from early church history when the Jewish Christians were kicked out of Rome in the first century I think they were gone 14 years when they came back the Gentile Roman Church was totally different when they got back they were they were baptizing babies they had the Eucharist already the history says that when they got back they had images of some of the Apostles set up now know where's the in between now H how did you go from you know communion was just a symbol to now this is actually the body of the Lord this is actually this cup is actually the blood of the Lord see it started off as just as saying well there there's there's more power in this bread there's more power in this wine than what you think but it slowly over time goes from a saying and it turns into a Doctrine now the reason this is important is because these things start creeping up Among Us right for example here's some common ones people say say oh if you believe brother's a prophet you've got the holy ghost that started off as a saying but now it's a it's a Doctrine a lot of churches right that's one of them okay the other one is uh we talked about uh Prosperity Gospel God always wants to heal and God wants everybody Rich that's not in the Bible it starts it starts off as a say and that's a saying now amongst a lot of message people and and even with these recent deaths it ought to be obvious to them that God doesn't always heal you got to find the will of God hallelujah but if they're not careful it's become a Doctrine and look at where look at where that's got Benny hin it's a Doctrine for Kenneth copelan you know it's a Doctrine for them now but it starts off as a deed just a saying and so we got to be very mindful that we watch these things and we don't let them come to the church because it just easily besets people it's just easier to say if you believe brother ad's a prophet you've got the Holy Ghost it's easier than saying let's come up to the Altar and let's really pray about it it's a lot easier oh you got the Holy Ghost you're born in the message family uh you love brother Ram God loves you it's way easier than somebody searching out their life and say do I really believe this do I have Christ in my heart am I really manifesting Jesus do I believe all this with all my heart and God like brother said beat me and let me rot out so you can fill me with the Holy Ghost amen it's a lot easier just have a deed or just a saying Well everybody's already got the Holy Ghost it's a lot easier it's easy religion and that conquers the lady it takes them it takes the hunger for the Holy Ghost the seeking the Holy Ghost it takes it out of the people and it so easily besets churches oh just push play and Obey that's so easy now the preacher don't got to study you don't got to pray you don't got to study the word of God it but it so easily besets people if they're not careful I'm glad don't beset me praise God and I'm glad you all like to say Amen to my preaching because that encourages me everybody was falling asleep and not saying amen I might consider pressing play I'm just kidding I'm just kidding but you understand you know these they start off as sayings now I this is what I told Brother cam I now the the first step is Deeds then it becomes Doctrine in the second Church age then it become the doctrine of balum in the Third Church age then it became Jezebel religion in the fourth Church age which was the depths of Satan Okay so I believe this a real child of God can only be tempted into the Deeds he'll never make it a Doctrine she'll never make it a Doctrine and that's because of God's grace in their lives in other words he won't let a holy ghost filled Saint have false Doctrine because it's like leaven right and the clearest example was Peter when he wouldn't eat with the Gentiles that's the clearest example we don't have any Scripture where he wrote he never wrote it in his letters right uh Jews shall not eat with Gentiles he it never became a Doctrine it just became a saying well they're not as clean as us what let's just after church let's just go over eat out here and we'll let the Gentiles go eat over there but was that sin did God hate that yes God hated so much he sent Paul in there he said you're to be blamed Hallelujah you're separating yourself it became a deed so so it's clear Holy Ghost filled Believers can get the wrong Deeds they can get the wrong habits the wrong traditions and the church said so we're not immune to that we're not we're not immune to battling the Antichrist Spirit we'll always battle the Antichrist spirit and there are many Antichrist if there were many Antichrist in Paul's days how many antichrists are there today but thank God there's a Christ here hallelujah oh there might be many of them but as long as we got Christ that's all that matters praise God we're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus Hallelujah but it's just something to be mindful because that's what we've seen these Deeds quickly become doctrines right just push play and as though that they said a onean Ministry in other words we don't need preachers how quickly that went from a deed to now it's a Doctrine now what's next Church the doctrine of balam we all the same remember Israel was all the same with the moabites well that's the next step if they don't get their Doctrine their false Doctrine cleaned up then they're just going to be the same as Catholics the same as Luther and Methodist all that the last step Jezebel killed the uh the the how many four 400 prophets did how many prophets did Jezebel kill lots of them she killed many prophets and so see that's the progression and I'm trying to just apply that to show that that all of us will sometimes lay down the armor and will be easily so easily think about that I I just was emphasizing that word not just easily beset but so easily like that little illustration of catching the mouth it was so easy it took me what two minutes Kristen already got the peanut butter for me I just put it on there tape it down go to sleep open the door there's the mouse it's happened like that four or five times in a row and church we're if we're so if we're so easily tempted just by something like this just pick it up and sin we got to we got to search Our Lives praise God if we're so easily ens snared we really got to search Our Lives whether it's a phone or whether it's a certain relationship whatever it is a spirit we got to be so concerned if we're so easily deceived or so willingly disobedient into sin and the church said so easily beset those three words really just jumped out to me at on the when I was studying there Hallelujah sorry about that brother Ram said Satan is a genius at his job I put that video out a couple weeks ago about the dumb devil statement which I don't agree with that's not a smart thing to do call the devil dumb even the angels of God wouldn't do that but Satan is a genius and yet sometimes the Trap is so obvious we just give into it because we're tired we're frustrated we just want some pleasure right the Bible said sin is pleasurable for season we just want some pleasure we've forgotten the joy of the Lord the pleasure of the Lord cam cam brought out that scripture I think it was Psalm chapter 1 his Delight is in the law of the Lord yes yeah Psalm 1 vers2 it's a beautiful scripture but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and his light do he meditate day and night God help us amen God help us to make our greatest Delight is thinking about the word thinking about the Mysteries God had brother Brandon finished amen hallelujah thinking about the gifts of the Holy Spirit the power of God we will see Miracles amen thinking about all these promisees of God the child of God who's planted by rivers of water is very fruitful because his Delight is in the word of God hallelujah amen let's make the word of God our greatest Delight Hallelujah but there are times like we said easily be beset and brother R made this quote in the Rapture Sermon Just a couple weeks before he passed he said I don't try to get up here to the pulpit and say something I think would please the people I've never been guilty of that so brother uses that word please in a negative way now I want you to be pleased with the sermon in that you know it's scriptural and it helps you but brother I'm saying don't try to please the people with a sinful thing don't just preach what they want to hear preach them the truth that's why I've got to preach against sin because I know I'm battling sin I'm sure you're battling sin how many battling sin out there right you still need all your armor pieces everybody need the armor of God still the devil hasn't stopped attacking you you you went through a whole week and there's no trials no tests no tempt no we still need the armor of God hallelujah he said I've never been guilty of that trying to please the people I want to get up here and say something as I feel led to say it that I think would be a help to you something that would further your experience with God if you are a Christian amen that's what I want I want you to have a a further experience with God and the experience I want you and I to have is that tomorrow we will not be so easily beset by sin in other words we'll stay stronger in our faith and we won't give into sin like we may have yesterday or last week right we're more determined not to be easily troubled by things I'll just be honest you know I uh I it seems like I I always battle you know is this the time of the Rapture is this the squeeze I always battle fear of that you know and so that that's an area where I've got to see more victory in my life and I believe I am by God's grace about ready to pick that my mic up you know that's that's something personally in my life where I want to see a victory in my life I want to not be so easily beset I want to hear the news and say that's fine Jesus is coming back anyway praise God I'm G to make myself ready the bride makes herself ready praise God so brother man wants to further your experience with God when he preached he says and if you're not a Christian make you so ashamed of yourself that you'll become a Christian he said that's the purpose I've always tried to line up with my thoughts as the Lord would lead me so I want to give the Believers a further experience but I want to make the sinner so ashamed of his sin that he'll become a Christian praise God now say like this I'm sure you're aware too you know as Christians sometimes we come to church and we haven't confessed sin so if that's the case if we've got sin in our lives if we're trying to run with these heavy weights I want to preach so it makes us ashamed of ourselves we'll confess our sins and we'll lay aside these weights that easily beset us right because we all come to church like I said I come to church tired sick maybe I don't feel like coming all the time I'm battling in my mind or my I'm battling in my body but the Bible said lay those things aside and run for Jesus Hallelujah all right now let's go back to Hebrews uh chapter 12 I just want to hit a few things in here I got most of these thoughts I want to do sometimes we are so easily burdened when we should be running the race with more freedom more victory yeah Hebrews chapter 12 not sure what I did here oh yeah where's that it's a volume adjustment is it at the very top or no see that all right so far so good yeah all right thank you brother I appreciate that there's a guy there's a guy knows what he's doing I don't know what I'm doing thank you sir I'm just screaming and preaching and shouting thank you sir appreciate that Hebrews chapter 12 let me just emphasize a few more of these I'm about at an hour here um now go to verse three for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest you be wearied and faint in your mind so this scripture is showing how Jesus endured such Temptations and he says if we remember how Jesus endured test yet never sinned that will make us refreshed right because sometimes we get weary and faint now don't you don't have to say Amen or raise your hand so much but I know it's true we all get weary and we feel faint sometimes we're faint like it's hard to pray it's hard to witness we're weary it's hard to want to go to church we're weary it's hard to want to do good we're tired so the Bible said when you're like this look to Jesus look how he endured everything just so he wouldn't be easily beset by sin Hallelujah verse four for ye have not resisted under blood striving against sin like I've told numerous people that have overcome you know pornography I said when was the last time you tried to resist your phone or when was the last time you actually tried to resist most times the PE the the men didn't they just go right into it they don't even even try can you just stop it and just try to kneel down and pray one time can you just resist it one time yes and then see how much Victory you'll get by God's grace amen and they said it helps them praise God to remind it You' got to make an attempt to resist Hallelujah and Jesus and and yeah Paul says we haven't even resisted under blood like I said you know with the with the sword being pointed at Abraham he wasn't even resisting on the blood yet and yet he'd already given into the sin and that's why I love the three Hebrew children they resisted to blood they resisted unto fire right the three Hebrew children they said well I don't know if God's going to save us or not but one thing's for sure we won't worship the devil amen we won't worship the World Council of churches we won't bow down to the Roman Catholic church amen and did you see that this week the pope would not condemn those attacks that Hamed on Israel the pope wouldn't condemn it I thought thought what in the world and then that scripture came to me in in uh Revelation 18 the mother Harlot was guilty of all the murders of the earth so just some some I thought I'd share that a fresh news uh news article there the pope is not condemning those attacks why because that's the spere behind it right they're controlling the wars in her was found the blood of the Saints right my I forgot my thought now that's all right Hebrews yes he strived against it yeah the three Hebrew children they were able they were willing to go get burned up rather than compromis on God's word let's take encouragement from that praise God I'll do everything in my power not to give in the enemy not to be so easily deceived so easily and snared like Samson so easy like brother dicks pre brother dicks preaching Samson so easy he just lay there right three times in a row she asked him what's your secret I'll give in he was just so easily just easily tempted into it and church we can't let sin we like the Bible say we can't let sin lie at the door can't like he just laid right there in the Sin just lay it there we can't let it do that we got to have a clean life Hallelujah clean thought life a clean actions our whole life must be clean praise God Amen now verse five and ye have forgotten exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chasing of the Lord nor fate when thou rebuked of him I've always remember this this is my brother Paul this is was the scripture for his testimony he got in a numerous car accidents in high school and he said all these car accidents all these trials led him to serve the Lord the chastening of the Lord in other words he was saying I wasn't serving God so God had to let me get in some really serious car accidents so I would serve God and I and I see my trials and my car accidents I see that now is God trying to correct me but how many know God is merciful am but those are some pretty severe tests for whom the Lord loveth he chastenest and scourges every son whom he receiveth there's going to be times where God is going to severely rebuke us for things that we know we shouldn't do sins that easily beset us we're trying to serve God but we're letting sin hang around our life we can't do that we got to lay it aside Hallelujah now I'm going to skip down here look at verse 12 so the Bible says I love it wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees so see when you're carrying things right when you're carrying a burden when you're carrying sin you can't lift up your hands and praise God so I guess God wants us to run like this praising God hallelujah thank you Jesus glory to God God wants us to run the race with hands raised praise God hallelujah being thankful that we can run the race praise God Amen we won't be left behind the tribulation we're running Hallelujah and we'll rise in the Rapture praise God Amen but we got to run giving God the praise hands free not holding on to sin that easily troubles us got to lay it aside that's the imagery remember we're seeing the clouds we're running Hallelujah and I love to run that's my testimony running the race for Christ that's that's the imagery I use too but running being encouraged looking up looking at all the testimonies hands free hands up giving God G giving God the praise giving Jesus praise amen Oh Glory verse 13 and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way and let it rather be healed Hallelujah so see walk a run a straight path towards heaven don't be turned aside on the wrong path and let your life be healed Hallelujah verse 14 follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord so now we can see uh what's the opposite of Peace Wars wars amongst churches Wars against Believers those are sins that easily beset the believer and that's those are kind of like the Deeds of the nicadan so in other what I'm saying is any sin that we hold on to is becoming a deed in our lives and we can't let we can't let it become something greater because it can easily become something greater Hallelujah so everybody must be deep thinking I didn't get a whole lot of amens on that so must be deep thinking maybe I'm I'm wearing you out today forgive me if I am ver uh verse 15 now we also get some more imagery looking diligently lest any man fail the grace of God I love this we can fail Grace but Grace will never fail us amen and who's this speaking of Esau so this is not speaking of a Believer a Believer will never fail the grace of God an unbeliever is the only one that can do that so don't don't don't let the devil get in your mind well I'm going to fail God's grace you're never going to fail God's grace God's grace is never going to fail you either Amen in other words you're always going to trust trust in God's grace Hallelujah remember Esau had the birth right he had the promise he had all these blessings coming to him but he said I'd rather sell it out for a little temporal pleasure so the lesson is don't give in temporal pleasure keep the promises of God hallelujah amen believe the promises of God don't sell out God's word believe God's word hallelujah hang on to it don't sell it out nothing is more valuable than Christ Hallelujah he is the treasure he is the answer I choose the Jesus way amen I like that lyric amen hallelujah he is the treasure praise God that's what we see plainly from the scripture I think I preached so hard I blew the page over there so I'm on the wrong page now see look in other words looking unto these clouds of witnesses while you're running praising God looking up looking diligently lest you fail the grace of God and what's the sin Esau got the root of bitterness he became bitter against Jacob well he's well yeah he shouldn't get he shouldn't going get bitter though he's the one that's willingly sold it out Esau didn't have to give in selling out we don't have to give in so he had a root of bitterness remember he's bitter against his parents the parents said marry believer he said I'm going to marry an unbeliever and then he took two wives just to spite his parents so see we don't want to now that's that's that's a besetting sin right we call these bitterness is a besetting sin lust and fear critical spirit right that's Pride really that's all critical spirit is is pride it's pride and it easily besets us but the Bible said lay that aside and run the race so that that's why this chapter was important it gives us imagery of running the race laying aside sins and then it gives us some examples of these sins verse 16 lest there be any fornicators there's a sexual sin or profane person as Esau now how many people have sold out for sexual sins in the world I mean almost everybody almost everybody you know these mega churches that are not in the message they're letting homosexuals in and and uh I watched a video last week and the reason is because they're just so sorry for them they don't want them to be alone the rest of their lives so they're giving in saying oh it's okay you can live a homosexual life and come to our church because you don't want to be alone but the Bible said you got to lay that aside and live a life of Holiness you have to live those people they have to live with the con consequences of their actions and that will prove their sincerity before God hallelujah but Church even if they're alone you're not alone praise God even if you feel physically alone you're not alone because Christ is with you you see that that's the that's the mindset that there well we got to give in because we feel so bad they're going to be alone the rest of lives they're not alone they got to be like you know remember some of the brothers uh remember Mike derle he's that guy who was homosexual he heard the message he left it but what you do Church on a couple occasions he moved in with some other brothers just for some encouragement right and you know that's what people should do you know if if they have a desire they don't want to be alone will pray and say God s Send Me Somebody I I can I can be with you know God he owns a cattle on a thousand hills not just natural things but even spiritual needs praise God he's Mighty to Sav the Bible says hallelujah his ear is open to the cries of the righteous again how how many times have we resisted how many times have we cried out to God how many times have we tried to lay these things aside let's let's do what the Bible says okay so we see it we see bitterness we see fornication we see we see profaneness as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold out his Birthright so meat is like food and finances right sell out the gospel just for a few extra bucks like Judas a scar for you know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears so we see that now in verse 18 it says we have not come to Mount Si what was Mount Si it was where they got the Ten Commandments and anyone who touched the mountain were smoked dead instantly in other words law the Bible's the Bible's encouraged us run so it's like we're running to the mountain amen we're running to Jesus Hallelujah it was so terrible in verse 21 the Bible says but verse 22 is where it tells us where we're running but ye are come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem to an innumerable company of angels praise God so remember I I don't have that picture ready but we had the picture when I preached on the Mount Zion series one mountain is is is condemnation it's instant death the other mountain is Jesus's Mountain hallelujah it's a holy city and there's in numerable Angels there praise God Hallelujah to the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to the god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the metor of the New Covenant to the blood of the sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel praise God hallelujah so we're running the race heading toward Mount Zion where there's Mercy where the blood of Jesus Christ speaks forgiveness don't want me anymore no God loves you he loved you so much he sent his son to die for you praise God hallelujah if he could have done anything else lay aside every rate rate wait and run the race with patience the Bible says so there we get that now we get impatient with God we're not willing to wait longer right I got to have this pleasure or I got to have this this feeling like I can have I got to feel like I've got the upper hand in the in the relationship or I'm going to hold this against them I've got to have this pleasure like Esau the fornicator the Bible says they feel like they can hold on this refuse him Hallelujah the Bible said he's speaking from Heaven I like verse 28 wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably and godly fear for our God is the consuming fire so one more time let me give you the picture here we're trying to run a race with our hands up looking under Jesus running it with patience God is a consuming fire the Bible said there's fire in his eyes amen hallelujah that's why the Bible said do everything with prayer and Thanksgiving of heart praise God Amen it's the will of God in Christ Jesus that's always God's will verse 28 wherefor wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and fear in other words God's kingdom the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost so God's Kingdom om cannot be moved and that's why the new birth is so important praise God when someone gets born again their soul his head was spitting anybody ever feel like your head's spinning it's it's it's interesting we go off for a vacation and everything slows down and then we we come back Monday morning and then my head's swimming already on Monday it's only 8:30 A.M on Monday my head's already swimming it was like wow I wish I could go back just 24 hours ago enjoy that time when my head wasn't swimming right all the requests all the deadlines all the due dates all everything like like that all the bills to pay but this is this is the scriptural uh truth that we have received a kingdom which cannot be moved Hallelujah in other words Satan cannot move that Holy Ghost out of our lives he I said like this the anchor he cannot move that anchor and and and and move you from where you stand with God hallelujah because the Bible said our anchor reaches up unto Heaven Hallelujah the Bible said our anchor reaches behind the veil in other words we've got a spiritual connection my soul is sealed but my soul is connected to the one who gave me that seal Hallelujah my soul's connected to him I cannot be moved praise God I'm going to run until I see Jesus hallelujah amen last verses here so what's the Bible say go back to earlier in the chapter I purposely skipped over these I want to save them to the end verse one I'm finishing verse one and let us run with patience the race that is set before us so let's pray for that here as we get ready to close service let's pray for patience that we won't be impatient and invite some sin into our life so easily give into sin so easily and what I mean sometimes we just choose a Sin and there's not even a Temptation no no one's even trying to persuade us to do it we ourselves just give into it so easily and what do we got to do we got to lay aside the sin and look unto Jesus there's the illustration not only do we have all the clouds but we got the sun we got Jesus he's the light of the world he's the light of the church he's the light of Our Lives Hallelujah lay it aside be patient look to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of God H let's stand to our feet by God's grace musicians can come Hallelujah you know I could have went through other examples you know think about Adam and Eve they were so easily beset so easily all zeve did was just have a few conversations well are you sure God say that is that what God means surely God didn't say that so easily beset but then what did God do in his Mercy he come down he slayed the lamb and he clothed them in the sacrifice and he gave them another chance praise God that's our God he's the god God who's rich in Mercy let's bow our heads as we pray let's ask God to give us patience and church if we're hanging on anything if we're trying to run a race holding some burden let's lay it aside and let's run away from that praise God the Bible said lay it aside and if we do that and if we run the race with our hands up praise God then we will run away from these sins that easily surround us easily troubled us reminds me song we don't have to sing it but reminds me of that song the eyes on the sparrow I think the the lyrics are why should I be discouraged why should the Shadows Fall why should my heart be lonely longing for heaven and home when Jesus is my portion amen hallelujah Conant friend is he Hallelujah maybe we'll sing that later by God's grace it's starting to come to me now his eyes on this pharaoh and I know he's watching over me praise God Z where's Zion Zion loves that Sparrow song he's always Sparrow I think that's God's reminder to us to remember that Jesus if he knows every sparrow that falls surely he knows you and I surely he's interested in helping us surely he wants us to run the race with no with nothing hanging on us praise God let's bow our heads for a word of prayer father God we thank you for today Lord God lord I just pray you'll take this uh jumbled bunch of thoughts here Lord I kind of feel a little jumbled in my thoughts Lord I just pray God that you will reveal to your people Lord what you want them to know dear God Lord you you know

brandham St Paul who said I have good and evil laid before me and I'll choose the evil the thing that I hate that's what I do Lord we can see the Bible truth behind this Peter would have the Keys of
