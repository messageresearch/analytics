[1:00] of trouble he shall hide me in his
[1:02] Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
[1:06] shall he hide me he shall set me up upon
[1:09] a rock let's have one more word of
[1:11] prayer uh if you have a need on your
[1:12] heart you can make it known unto God
[1:14] father we love you today Lord God we're

[1:18] we don't want our will we want thy will
[1:20] Lord God so have your way today Lord God
[1:22] just let your spirit move each person
[1:24] Lord God to receive your word Lord God
[1:26] to bless your Holy Name Lord God uh just

[1:30] Lord God we're mindful of your presence
[1:32] God we know you said you'd be wherever
[1:34] two or three are gathered Lord you'd be
[1:36] right there in the midst Lord God and

[1:40] shall have it Lord according to thy will
[1:42] so God we're thankful for your promises
[1:45] and Lord we love you Lord God thank you
[1:46] you're the strength of our soul and your
[1:48] love has defended us all the days of our
[1:50] life and will defend us Lord God in the
[1:52] future so we thank you for each day that
[1:54] we have Lord God we're thankful for all
[1:56] your provision Lord uh bless this
[1:58] preaching of Thy word in Jesus Christ's
[2:00] name and the Saints said amen God bless
[2:03] you as you're seated there praise
[2:06] God
[2:10] hallelujah so last time we looked at
[2:12] scoffers as brother Ram was looking at
[2:13] the scoffers uh in second Peter and then
[2:16] we looked at uh brother Ram talked about
[2:18] the Revelation it's so important brother
[2:20] Ram said the bride is waiting for the
[2:22] revelation of the Rapture how many still
[2:24] waiting praise God we must be patient
[2:26] for the revelation of the Rapture
[2:28] Hallelujah so at this moment here in the
[2:31] sermon brother Ram picks it up and now
[2:33] he begins on Election remember you can
[2:35] put it up there honey according to
[2:36] Romans 8:29 and3 there's five steps God
[2:39] gives us to his predestination the first
[2:42] is for knowledge whom he did for know he
[2:45] did also predestinate to be conformed to
[2:47] the image of his son that he might be
[2:49] the firstborn among many Brethren so
[2:52] first God forn knows our choices knows
[2:55] the free will uh free moral agency of
[2:57] every heart and then because of that he
[2:59] can pred destinate a vessel of Honor or
[3:01] a vessel Of Dishonor and of course he
[3:03] knew it before the foundation of the
[3:05] world and then the third step is uh whom
[3:07] he did predestinate them he also called
[3:10] the word called is the same word as
[3:12] elected God has elected us or called us
[3:15] so this is the main election I'm worried
[3:17] about today Hallelujah there's a big
[3:19] election coming on Tuesday but the main
[3:21] election I want to have is that I'm
[3:23] elected to Salvation through Jesus
[3:25] Christ hallelujah thank God for his
[3:27] grace and mercy and then whom he called
[3:29] called them he also Justified declared
[3:32] righteous and whom he justified them he
[3:35] also glorified brother R said that
[3:37] glorified then uh he said your raptured
[3:39] body is right there your glorified body
[3:42] he says the raptures already in you
[3:44] Hallelujah so we thank God for the
[3:47] election uh brother Bram begins uh here
[3:50] he takes a little break from Revelation
[3:51] and he says election he said you were in
[3:54] your father years before you were even
[3:57] born and we see that in Hebrews 7 9 and
[4:00] 10 if you want to put up there hun and I
[4:02] may as I may so say Levi also who
[4:05] received tithes paid tithes in Abraham
[4:09] for he was yet in the loins of his
[4:11] father when MDC met him so we can say
[4:16] assuredly by the word of God that God
[4:19] foresaw our service to him uh at least
[4:23] uh three generations before we came
[4:26] because Abraham had Isaac Isaac had
[4:28] Jacob Jacob birth Levi and the Bible
[4:31] said Levi paid tithes in Abraham so
[4:34] three generations before you got here
[4:37] God fora you that you would serve God
[4:40] way before you even got here hallelujah
[4:43] and brother Braham said see you were in
[4:44] your father before you were even born so
[4:47] as we looked at last week even the so
[4:49] somewhere in the DNA of your father you
[4:52] were in there by God's grace Hallelujah
[4:54] I can't explain that yet but I'm sure
[4:56] science one day will find it out
[4:57] Hallelujah no doubt about that they L
[4:59] find out more things that God has
[5:01] already written in his word so God
[5:03] foresaw Levi's tithe paying in his uh
[5:08] great grandfather Abraham Hallelujah and
[5:11] brother Ram said my son Billy Paul was
[5:13] in me when I was
[5:14] 16 and now he said my son is in my uh uh
[5:18] when is in my own image and he said
[5:20] Billy Paul came at just the right time
[5:22] and church don't you know you came to
[5:24] this world at just the right time
[5:26] Hallelujah he said because we're
[5:28] attributes of God brother R said he knew
[5:30] the age you were coming in he he knew
[5:33] you wouldn't come in Ephesus or samna or
[5:35] pergamos or thy or Philadelphia or
[5:38] Sardis he knew you would come in the
[5:40] leoan church age and brother bam said he
[5:42] did that because he's longing for your
[5:44] fellowship so let's make sure today you
[5:46] give God some fellowship Hallelujah tell
[5:49] him how much you love Him worship Him
[5:51] Praise Him receive his word hallelujah
[5:53] Give Him Glory Hallelujah he's Longing
[5:55] To Be
[5:56] worshiped he's he's uh his angels
[5:59] brother R says are going uh along the
[6:01] roads taking down prayer requests
[6:03] Hallelujah and taking those prayer
[6:05] requests up to heaven and then putting
[6:07] them in vials and God writes down all
[6:09] your prayers in other words and puts
[6:10] them and collects them and they're all
[6:12] going to be poured out somehow way or
[6:14] another God will answer all our prayers
[6:16] Hallelujah now Church you know this
[6:18] we'll find out which prayer requests of
[6:19] ours were the perfect will of God and
[6:21] we'll find out which prayers of ours
[6:22] were our own desires Hallelujah but
[6:25] God's will will be accomplished amen 2
[6:28] chronicles 16 9 says for the L the eyes
[6:31] of the Lord run to and thr fro sorry
[6:34] throughout the whole earth to show
[6:36] himself
[6:38] strong in the behalf of them whose heart
[6:41] is perfect toward him so God wants to
[6:44] show himself strong in the lives of the
[6:46] Believers most people they are sinners
[6:49] and they have they're weak in faith but
[6:51] we're to be Christians we're to be holy
[6:53] ghost filled and God is looking for
[6:55] someone he can show strong faith in we
[6:59] want to be like Abraham we want to call
[7:01] those things not as though they are
[7:03] Hallelujah that's what God is looking
[7:05] for today his spirit is going all over
[7:07] the Earth trying to find someone he can
[7:10] show himself strong in let's be somebody
[7:12] that God can show his strength in today
[7:14] Hallelujah brother Ram said though
[7:16] although we're predestinated he said
[7:18] there's millions and billions he said
[7:21] mimicking Christianity and he goes to a
[7:24] quite a a graphic illustration he goes
[7:28] to cattle breeding and he goes to the
[7:31] discharge of a bull so I know that's
[7:34] quite descriptive there but he goes to
[7:36] that and he says uh his friend de
[7:38] mikarin uh raised bulls and he he showed
[7:41] brother brandom uh how they would uh uh
[7:44] how they would H breed the Bulls and so
[7:46] forth like that and he says uh in the
[7:49] discharge of a bull he said uh there's
[7:51] millions of germs in there he said but
[7:54] only one was ordained to life and
[7:57] brother man said he saw it in the in the
[7:58] microscope he saw a germ crawl over
[8:02] other germs to fertilize an egg that was
[8:05] waiting and brother R said it said that
[8:07] germ was predestinated by God that germ
[8:11] had to push its way because God ordained
[8:13] that particular one because it had
[8:15] certain traits about it in the DNA
[8:17] certain things that that God had
[8:19] ordained that that bull would Express
[8:21] and it had to bypass everything else to
[8:24] get to the egg in order to express the
[8:27] predestinated plan of God and brother
[8:29] Ram said that's more mysterious to us
[8:31] than the Virgin birth cuz the Virgin
[8:34] birth was God giving one germ one egg
[8:37] and just one and one came together to
[8:39] form the body of our Lord Jesus Christ
[8:41] but he said uh it's different with
[8:43] animal life and of course human life he
[8:46] said there's millions of of options but
[8:48] there's one that presses through the
[8:50] crowd amen this reminded me of the woman
[8:52] with the blood issue the Bible said when
[8:54] she heard of Jesus she came in the press
[8:57] behind and touched his garments there
[8:59] there was all kinds of people standing
[9:00] around Jesus but she pressed her way it
[9:03] was predestinated amen it was revealed
[9:06] to her that she was going to get her
[9:08] healing so just like that germ she
[9:10] pressed Beyond everybody in order to
[9:12] touch Jesus and as soon as she touched
[9:14] Jesus life occurred hallelujah amen
[9:17] hallelujah so just like you church just
[9:19] that's a that's a lesson for us today
[9:21] we've got to press through all the
[9:23] trials we've got to get past all the
[9:24] discouragement get past all the all the
[9:27] Mind battles we got to press through
[9:29] that and get to Jesus
[9:31] Hallelujah and receive from God what
[9:33] he'd have for us today
[9:36] Hallelujah think about that there was so
[9:38] many other traits uh just at at when you
[9:41] were conceived there were so many other
[9:42] traits options there but it was
[9:44] something about you God fornew you God
[9:47] predestinated you there's a purpose
[9:49] you're here God wants to help you God
[9:51] wants to strengthen you God wants to be
[9:53] strong in your life
[9:55] hallelujah
[9:56] hallelujah and then brother R says
[9:58] Ephesians 1 five sorry Ephesians 1 4-6
[10:02] you were in God in the mind of Christ
[10:04] before the foundation of the world he
[10:07] said that life you were in the life of
[10:09] God you were a part of the life of God
[10:12] that thought remember you went from
[10:13] thought uh uh to flesh right from
[10:17] thought or attribute to flesh Hallelujah
[10:20] then he says you'll go to theophany and
[10:22] then you'll go to glorified body
[10:24] Hallelujah that's the uh the regular
[10:26] line brother brandom calls it and who is
[10:27] this mzc he he said that life was always
[10:30] in you you were always in the mind of
[10:32] God he said then he goes into his Eagle
[10:35] in the chicken yard story Hallelujah he
[10:37] said that little Eagle would eat up all
[10:39] the chicken food it didn't taste good to
[10:41] him but he didn't have nothing else to
[10:42] do or or eat he just filed the chickens
[10:45] but brother B said he wasn't a chicken
[10:47] to begin with he said the mother
[10:49] screamed one day the mother ego said oh
[10:52] I know I had two eggs there's only one
[10:53] here I'm missing an egg you know the
[10:55] farmer had taking the
[10:56] egg and she said I must go looking for
[10:59] my
[10:59] uh my son and so she goes flying over
[11:02] the chicken yard she let out a scream
[11:04] and as soon as that little Eagle heard
[11:05] the scream it looked up and said brother
[11:08] said that scream fits me Hallelujah when
[11:12] I heard this message it fit me
[11:14] Hallelujah because I was raised in
[11:16] Pentecostal where they had to say you
[11:18] got to speak in tongues that didn't fit
[11:20] me tongues are the evidence that didn't
[11:21] fit me I'll say I'll say like this it
[11:23] suffocated me and that didn't fit me so
[11:27] I I couldn't I couldn't go along with
[11:28] that group but then I heard a prophet of
[11:30] God I heard an eagle scream and that fit
[11:33] me and it said the evidence is all the
[11:35] word of God being in the word all the
[11:37] way Hallelujah that fit me Hallelujah
[11:40] the father son Holy Ghost sprinkling or
[11:42] whatever it was that didn't fit me uh
[11:45] but the word of God from acts 238 and
[11:47] acts 8 and acts 10 and Acts 19 all the
[11:50] baptisms that fit me perfectly
[11:52] hallelujah amen I heard that voice and I
[11:55] believe that voice and I follow that
[11:57] Voice Hallelujah it's a thing that fits
[12:01] this message fits us hallelujah because
[12:04] it's the real interpretation of the word
[12:06] of God and it's Vindicated in our lives
[12:10] hallelujah how many times do we ask God
[12:12] for Vindication he gives us a
[12:13] Vindication Lord let me know I'm on the
[12:15] right path God lets us know we're on the
[12:17] right path hallelujah amen we've asked
[12:20] God God show me if there's sin in Me God
[12:22] will show us some sin and then it gets
[12:23] cleaned out
[12:25] Hallelujah that's God vindicating his
[12:27] word to us you know over the years I've
[12:29] asked Lord just show me the difference
[12:30] between you know the message and
[12:31] Pentecostals and message and
[12:33] evangelicals and every time God gives me
[12:35] a great Vindication and he shows us that
[12:38] he's in this message Hallelujah why
[12:40] church because all the other ones
[12:41] compromise and love the world they only
[12:43] have a partial fear of God but we must
[12:45] have a true fear of God brother Bram
[12:48] said see God is adding word upon word he
[12:51] said it's genuine adding word to word
[12:54] the bride will have to be all the word
[12:58] brother said Luther had part of the word
[13:00] Wesley had more of the word Pentecost he
[13:03] said and all the rest of the word goes
[13:06] with it he said it's life on top of life
[13:09] to bring out the full stature of the
[13:12] Bride Hallelujah think about that church
[13:15] in the days of Martin Luther they only
[13:17] had a partial uh portion of the word
[13:20] they didn't have the full word of God
[13:22] like the statue of a perfect man and all
[13:24] the revelations that we have today they
[13:26] don't so they weren't the full mature
[13:28] bride only in this day can God have a
[13:31] full mature bride that believes all the
[13:33] word of God hallelujah because it's word
[13:37] on top of word hallelujah man he
[13:41] says how do we get into that bride now
[13:43] he now he changes a a corner here he
[13:46] says how do we get in that bride that's
[13:47] the question he said some say You must
[13:50] speak in tongues others say You must
[13:51] dance and shout and brother raham said
[13:54] that's all right but it's also all
[13:57] wrong why is that wrong because you make
[14:00] one experience the evidence of it why is
[14:03] all why is it all right because when the
[14:05] Holy Ghost comes something has to happen
[14:08] amen so shouting or tongue or dancing
[14:11] something crying weeping rejoicing
[14:14] something has to happen he says it's all
[14:16] right but it's all wrong Hallelujah
[14:18] because we must have a word based
[14:21] experience and then brother Ram says how
[14:22] can a born again person deny the word of
[14:26] God he says you can't if you're a real
[14:29] born again so he said it must be Christ
[14:32] in you and the verse brother Ram uses to
[14:34] show us how to get into Christ is 1
[14:36] Corinthians
[14:38] 1213 I'm going to read the context I'm
[14:40] going to read uh 1212 uh qua for as the
[14:43] body is one and hath many members and
[14:46] all the members of that one body being
[14:48] many are one body so also is Christ so
[14:51] let's remember this today there are
[14:53] people that are baptized with the Holy
[14:54] Ghost and they might be a
[14:56] pinky in the plan of God they might be a
[14:58] e here now which which body part gets
[15:01] all the glory maybe the face gets all
[15:03] the glory right everybody wants to do a
[15:05] selfie and put it on you or maybe the
[15:07] big muscles there's a body there's a
[15:10] there might might be a bride member
[15:11] that's the
[15:12] bicep or the or the thighs or the
[15:15] hamstrings or the the knees or the
[15:16] ankles but there there is a body part
[15:19] that's just the little
[15:20] toe hallelujah or the appendix something
[15:23] you can live without right well at least
[15:25] one of
[15:26] them and so Paul's giving
[15:29] uh this picture of the body of Christ in
[15:32] other words God help me to be in your
[15:34] body whatever you want me to be in your
[15:36] body help me not to try to mimic
[15:38] something try to be like somebody else
[15:40] help me to be what you call me to
[15:44] be for by one Spirit we're all baptized
[15:47] into one body whether we be Jews or
[15:49] Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and
[15:51] have been all made to drink into one
[15:54] spirit for the body is not one member
[15:57] but many so how do we get in this body
[16:00] baptized by the Holy Ghost your soul is
[16:03] filled your soul is quickened by the
[16:05] word of God by the spirit of God by the
[16:08] life of God
[16:09] hallelujah and then that controls your
[16:11] whole nature if you're born again your
[16:13] soul that will bring your mind into
[16:15] subjection and you won't do certain
[16:17] things Hallelujah and then when you got
[16:19] your mind anointed that will bring your
[16:21] body into subjection you won't do
[16:23] certain things Hallelujah because you're
[16:25] born again you have a power you have a
[16:27] nature uh that that that guards you that
[16:30] protects you it governs you it controls
[16:32] you
[16:33] Hallelujah that's right verse 15 and if
[16:36] the foot shall say because I'm not the
[16:38] hand I'm not the body is it therefore
[16:40] not the body of course it is the body
[16:42] right so some of us you know we're
[16:44] different parts of the
[16:46] body now we know as as sisters and maybe
[16:49] children uh you know who probably gets
[16:51] the most honor in the body well probably
[16:52] preachers or something like that you
[16:53] know we would think because they speak
[16:55] the word of God publicly right the the
[16:57] mouthpiece we we' say the spirit and the
[16:59] bride say come the preachers the
[17:01] fivefold ministry brings us to maturity
[17:03] but Paul's trying to say whatever part
[17:05] you are you're just as important as
[17:07] every other
[17:08] part who would want to willingly give up
[17:11] your foot today who would want to
[17:12] willingly uh give up your hand today no
[17:15] one would want to do that you want all
[17:17] the all the body together we want all
[17:19] the bride ready for the Rapture
[17:21] hallelujah amen so we get into one body
[17:26] by one Spirit baptized by the holy ghost
[17:29] Hallelujah remember baptize means to
[17:31] immerse uh to uh yeah to to to go to go
[17:35] completely under immerse means to go
[17:37] completely under the water Hallelujah so
[17:39] think of that your soul is completely
[17:41] immersed in the word of God that's why
[17:43] we think about it all day that's why we
[17:45] sing to Jesus all day that's why we
[17:47] can't get enough of God's word because
[17:49] our soul is is immersed with the Holy
[17:51] Ghost
[17:52] Hallelujah glory to
[17:55] God so that's the context how do we get
[17:58] into this rapture how do we get into the
[18:00] Rapture you must be baptized with the
[18:02] Holy Ghost we're all baptized into that
[18:05] one body glory to
[18:08] God and then brother R goes into another
[18:11] illustration of the Rapture I'm sorry
[18:12] with election he says he uh he was out
[18:15] there in the in California and he went
[18:17] to a farmer's uh kind of like a Orchard
[18:19] and he saw a orange tree that had eight
[18:21] or nine different kinds of fruit on it
[18:24] and you probably remember the story uh
[18:26] brother Bram said you know each branch
[18:27] that was a different life other than the
[18:29] orange Branch produce its own fruit like
[18:31] a apple or a pear or something like that
[18:34] brother said oh so then next season
[18:36] they'll all bring forth oranges brother
[18:38] brother said no whatever Branch uh
[18:41] whatever the branch is from the original
[18:43] tree it was that's the fruit is going to
[18:44] bring forth and brother R said see
[18:47] that's a Methodist will always bring
[18:49] forth a Methodist Hallelujah he said a
[18:52] Pentecostal will always bring forth the
[18:53] Pentecostal but a true member of the
[18:55] Bride of Jesus Christ will always bring
[18:57] forth the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen
[19:00] hallelujah glory to
[19:02] God he says and Jesus wants fruit for
[19:06] himself he wants bride children word
[19:10] children is what the word of God
[19:13] produces will produce a life of the word
[19:15] of God if we've got the right seed the
[19:17] seed of God will produce the life of God
[19:20] hallelujah amen but he said the nominal
[19:23] Church shall go back to the love of the
[19:26] world the Church of the Living God will
[19:29] be fully the word of
[19:33] God then brother Bram breaks back he
[19:35] keeps breaking back into Luther Wesley
[19:37] and and zuza he said Luther had to live
[19:40] above brother said the strange thing
[19:41] about Luther is that he had to live
[19:43] above all the fanaticism that surround
[19:45] His message remember church I don't know
[19:47] if you remember uh Luther said I hope
[19:49] 10% of the people we baptized are still
[19:52] saved and I saw a quote I said it on my
[19:55] phone Luther said by the end of his life
[19:57] he said he there's some of us that don't
[19:58] even look like we're even utterly
[20:01] Christian that that's how much people
[20:03] decline Church let's strive with all of
[20:05] our hearts not to decline in the faith
[20:07] let's strive to remain loyal let's
[20:09] strive to keep our fires burning amen
[20:11] it's lamp trimming time
[20:13] hallelujah it's time to trim our lamps
[20:15] to keep sin out of our lives in fact
[20:17] this is the message brother ram calls it
[20:18] lamp trimming time he said it's lamp
[20:20] trimming time it's Malachi 4 time he
[20:22] almost says it's Luke 17:30 time
[20:25] Hallelujah that's right he said there's
[20:27] so much imitation he talks about Amy
[20:29] simple mcferson and and he said but the
[20:31] word will bring forth of its own kind in
[20:35] its season Hallelujah so the word of of
[20:38] this season is to produce a Rapture a
[20:41] bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah it's
[20:44] not going to produce uh something that
[20:45] looks like Pentecostal or or or or
[20:48] Methodist or Luther it's going to
[20:50] produce something that looks like the
[20:51] word of God the question is does your
[20:53] life look like the word of
[20:55] God that's the question for me does my
[20:58] life look like the word of God
[21:00] hallelujah now at this point brother BR
[21:02] at 50 minute Mark brother breaks into a
[21:04] new thought he gets done with election
[21:06] he preached on that for eight minutes
[21:07] and then he gets into types of the
[21:10] Rapture well Ram said uh now we get into
[21:12] the Rapture Enoch now he gets into Enoch
[21:14] Enoch was the seventh from Noah now
[21:18] don't say
[21:19] Amen okay don't say amen I told you last
[21:23] week brother Ram says the wrong name he
[21:24] meant to say Adam he says it twice he
[21:27] said that en en was the seventh from
[21:30] Noah and then two paragraphs later he
[21:32] says now we find here that Enoch was a
[21:34] seventh from Noah any Bible reader knows
[21:38] uh Enoch was the seventh from Adam Adam
[21:40] Seth Enos Canaan melel Jared and
[21:45] Enoch Hallelujah and then after Enoch
[21:48] Enoch begat
[21:50] Methuselah lamech and then Noah so Noah
[21:53] was the great grandson of
[21:55] Enoch but in the quote brother Ram says
[21:58] Enoch was a seventh from Adam so any
[22:00] mature Christian knows brother Bram just
[22:02] made a human mistake to say that brother
[22:05] brandham every word he said was thus say
[22:07] the Lord is evidence you're filled with
[22:09] a lying idolatrous spirit thank God we
[22:12] got enough truth in here that we can
[22:14] recognize when brother Ram's a man and
[22:15] brother bram's being a prophet with thus
[22:17] sayith the Lord hallelujah Enoch was the
[22:20] seventh from Adam and that brother Bram
[22:22] said makes him a type of the church ages
[22:25] he said Enoch was translated or raptured
[22:28] which which shows the seventh Church age
[22:30] takes the Rapture he says there's no
[22:33] doubt we're in the seventh Church age
[22:36] Hallelujah Enoch I'm sorry Noah was born
[22:38] approximately 70 years 69 70 after Enoch
[22:42] was raptured Hallelujah so uh Noah never
[22:45] of course never even met Enoch because
[22:47] he'd already been
[22:49] raptured but some people just don't have
[22:51] enough Common Sense uh to recognize
[22:53] these things Hallelujah but that's the
[22:56] battle we're facing today it's it's
[22:58] idolatry in the church remember John
[23:00] said and Paul said uh my brothers
[23:02] sisters flee from
[23:05] idolatry free from putting anything else
[23:07] that would would take the love of Jesus
[23:09] Christ or the admiration of Jesus Christ
[23:11] don't let anything get worshiped that
[23:13] belongs only to Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[23:16] church this Spirit of idolatry makes
[23:19] people
[23:20] lazy because they don't have to prove
[23:22] all
[23:23] things Hallelujah they don't have to
[23:25] fight off lies they just take whatever
[23:28] whatever uh their their brandom
[23:30] Tabernacle says they can just believe
[23:32] all things from one man and that man is
[23:34] not Jesus so that's
[23:36] idolatry their God is brother brandham
[23:39] they're insane to say that Enoch was a
[23:42] descendant from
[23:44] Noah right because Noah is a descendant
[23:46] of Enoch
[23:48] Hallelujah and brother says now Rapture
[23:51] without death was typ by Enoch for he
[23:53] was the seventh from Adam and is a type
[23:56] of the seventh Church age now now
[23:58] brother man says let's dig in now real
[24:01] deep guess where he goes Revelation
[24:04] 10:7 what we preach on last Sunday night
[24:07] Revelation 10:7 how many know Revelation
[24:10] 10 is deep that's what brother Ram says
[24:13] he said Revelation 107 the great mystery
[24:16] was to be unfolded by the seventh
[24:18] Angel's message angel means
[24:22] messenger when he begins to sound his
[24:24] ministry he says Jesus was rejected once
[24:28] he started preaching everybody loved
[24:30] Jesus when he was only doing
[24:32] Miracles but when he started bringing he
[24:34] said the Revelation and he he brought
[24:37] out the woes under the Pharisees and the
[24:39] woes under the Sadducees and brother
[24:41] said when he started saying You must
[24:43] drink my blood and eat my body he said
[24:46] that started the message actually
[24:48] started separating the True Believers
[24:50] from the
[24:51] unbelievers Hallelujah Jesus said I and
[24:54] my father are one and that separated the
[24:58] TR True Believer from the make believer
[25:00] Hallelujah but how many know Jesus was
[25:02] one with the father not a second person
[25:05] not a third person he was uh the express
[25:08] image of God's one person brother said
[25:11] Jesus didn't have to explain it he when
[25:14] he said eat flesh and drink blood he
[25:16] said we don't have to understand
[25:17] everything that God said we just have to
[25:19] believe
[25:20] it now remember Church there's a
[25:22] difference between brother brandham and
[25:24] Jesus if brother Bram said something in
[25:26] the name of the Lord then yes we have to
[25:29] believe it even though we don't
[25:31] understand it but if it's just something
[25:32] brother said without thus sayith the
[25:34] Lord we don't have to believe
[25:36] that but it's different with Jesus
[25:39] Everything Jesus said was thus saith God
[25:41] because he was God
[25:43] hallelujah that's the great difference
[25:45] but see tape worshippers can't accept
[25:48] that so that's the great difference that
[25:51] we have to see and we're digging in real
[25:53] deep now now this week I went and
[25:54] studied uh more on the Revelation 107
[25:58] and the cloud from 1963 I only found one
[26:01] more quote I thought there'd be more but
[26:02] I probably need to keep looking but I at
[26:04] least now have three quotes where
[26:05] brother Ram connects the cloud uh from
[26:09] February 28 63 with his ministry of
[26:12] finishing the mystery of God I showed
[26:14] you from Shalom and what is the
[26:16] attraction on the mountain Hallelujah 64
[26:18] and 1965 now I got one from 1963 this is
[26:22] a couple weeks after he preached the
[26:23] Seven
[26:24] Seals brother bam said said brother bam
[26:27] said said
[26:28] it might the Rapture might already be
[26:31] one of these mornings and you wouldn't
[26:32] know it why how I hope you can read I
[26:35] hope you can got a spirit of Christ
[26:37] enough to know what I'm talking about
[26:39] the Holy Spirit reveal it to you these
[26:41] are taped and they go around the world
[26:43] see but you realize now how many know
[26:46] brother manam said these tapes go out
[26:47] into the tape world how many know you're
[26:49] living in tape World ah hallah I hope
[26:52] you are by God's grace we're living in
[26:54] the tape world right this is the world
[26:56] where tapes are here we feed upon the
[26:57] word of of God it directs us back to the
[26:59] scripture and we rejoice in the word of
[27:01] God hallelujah I'm living in tape World
[27:04] brother Austin
[27:05] Hallelujah that's right I listen to the
[27:07] tapes the tapes point me to the word of
[27:09] God I'm strengthened I get to hear the
[27:11] voice of a genuine prophet of God how
[27:13] many people are privilege to have that
[27:15] very few we're a blessed people in this
[27:17] day
[27:18] Hallelujah H he said just a few days ago
[27:22] this is the world's falling apart in
[27:23] Albuquerque New Mexico April 12th 63 he
[27:28] said just a few days ago when them Seven
[27:30] Angels Came Down in that
[27:32] Vision many of you knowing it said go to
[27:35] Tucson and wait there for a while you'll
[27:37] hear a great blast go off remember
[27:39] brother told this vision of the blast
[27:42] going off and meeting the seven angels
[27:43] he told it in December of 62 and then he
[27:47] goes out to Tucson and actually
[27:49] experiences it probably in early March
[27:51] of 1963 so it was a vision for telling
[27:54] that he meet seven angels to tell him to
[27:57] go back to jeffon to preach the
[27:59] revelation of the Seven Seals and he
[28:01] said I tell it to you in the name of the
[28:03] Lord amen and it came to pass
[28:07] Hallelujah he says and when it goes
[28:10] blast return back and the Seven Seals
[28:13] were opened at the Tabernacle the other
[28:15] day everybody say open ready open he
[28:17] said the Seven Seals were already open
[28:18] in Revelation
[28:20] form when I seen people coming from
[28:23] standing there 3:00 in the in the
[28:25] morning to get a place to get in the
[28:26] auditorium and so forth forth think
[28:28] about that church when was the last time
[28:30] you came that early to church 3: in the
[28:32] morning I've never I've never instead of
[28:35] that I just stay overnight like if I'm
[28:36] going somewhere I'll just stay over the
[28:37] night rather than sitting outside the
[28:39] church at 3:00 a.m. so brother I said
[28:41] for the Seven Seals people were outside
[28:44] at 3:00 a.m. in the morning let's say
[28:45] they open the doors at 9: they waited
[28:47] there six hours in the cold just to hear
[28:50] a prophet of God give thus say the Lord
[28:52] now to me that proves it was a thunder
[28:54] each seal was a thunder it was the voice
[28:56] of God it wasn't the voice of a man it
[28:58] was the voice of a lion thundering out
[29:00] because God surely got do nothing except
[29:02] he reveals a secret to his servants the
[29:05] prophets Hallelujah as brother Ram said
[29:07] amen
[29:11] glory he says 3 o'clock in the morning
[29:14] they were setting to get a place to get
[29:15] into the auditorium and so forth seeing
[29:18] the hungry Hearts coming from everywhere
[29:20] I thought oh God we're bound to be at
[29:22] the end time remember the sounding of
[29:24] the seventh angel the mysteries of God
[29:27] was finished and there come an angel
[29:29] from heaven and swore and raised his
[29:31] hands from Heaven Revelation 10 1-7 that
[29:35] time would be no more exactly right the
[29:39] hour so brother showing look the vision
[29:41] was fulfilled we're in the hour of its
[29:43] almost time shall be no more Hallelujah
[29:47] of course that would mean the Rapture
[29:48] time no more before the Rapture God's
[29:50] done with the Gentiles goes to the Jews
[29:53] Hallelujah so that was pretty deep
[29:56] brother manam said that was digging real
[29:58] deep how many like the Deep things of
[30:00] God the spirit searches the Deep things
[30:02] of God yay the Deep things of God we'll
[30:05] get to that
[30:06] soon the prophet said the seventh angel
[30:09] reveals Mysteries of the Seven Seals
[30:11] Luther did not live long enough to
[30:14] reveal the
[30:15] seals brother said he would have if he
[30:18] lived long enough so it shows how God
[30:20] ordains ages God knows the next age the
[30:23] next anointing the next messenger god
[30:25] knows the next person the fivefold
[30:27] ministry he's going to use
[30:29] he said the Reformation was New Life
[30:32] coming forth after the death of the Dark
[30:36] Ages and he says the sunrise this
[30:38] morning foreshadowed
[30:41] that so the the the the Third Church age
[30:44] was like death I'm sorry no the fourth
[30:46] Church age thyro was was the darkest age
[30:48] brother Ram said and the Bible says that
[30:51] so that represent the sun going down so
[30:53] Martin Luther was the sunrise that you
[30:56] all saw this morning how many appreciate
[30:57] the Sunrise that represented Martin
[31:00] Luther
[31:02] Hallelujah he says the Reformation was
[31:04] new life like a sunrise coming forth out
[31:07] of a dark night he says the life came
[31:11] out of Luther it went into
[31:14] westly and life comes out of Pentecost
[31:17] church I thought about this today have
[31:19] you realized how the persecution has uh
[31:21] uh or the the trials for the Christian
[31:23] has been different as time went on I'm
[31:25] going to read it in just a moment but
[31:27] Martin Luther had had to stand there in
[31:28] front of the Pope and Cardinals and
[31:31] stand for his message of his hour and
[31:34] death was on the
[31:36] line now did did John Wesley have to do
[31:39] that no but what did John Wesley have to
[31:41] deal with churches that kicked him out
[31:43] they would throw stones at him right
[31:44] kicked him out different kind of
[31:48] persecution ausa Street my brother man
[31:50] said some of them even got shot at in
[31:52] their
[31:52] auditoriums so very similar to John
[31:54] Wesley there now we're living in a day
[31:57] and brother Ram said now he lived in
[31:59] America so remember uh brother Bram said
[32:01] the hardest thing he's ever gone through
[32:02] is being rejected out there in Arizona
[32:04] by all the preachers remember that he
[32:06] said that was the hardest thing he'd
[32:07] ever gone through out there he said he
[32:09] said I'm out here in a desert he said
[32:10] it's a desert spiritually all these
[32:12] preachers divided by their own they just
[32:14] want to grow their big kingdoms brother
[32:15] said this has been the hardest thing of
[32:16] my life that's what he said but look how
[32:19] look how the persecution physically has
[32:22] kind of gone down but we're still facing
[32:25] persecution we're still p uh still
[32:28] facing Trials of life don't you know the
[32:30] devil's trying to get us to recant our
[32:33] faith the devil will use your family
[32:36] he'll use friends he'll use work and job
[32:38] situations uh he he'll try anything to
[32:40] try to get you to recant your faith but
[32:42] God is telling you to stand on the word
[32:45] of
[32:47] God most of the day most of the time
[32:49] here in America the spirit in America is
[32:51] entertainment and so it's the devil
[32:52] trying to use entertainment to get
[32:54] people to deny their faith in the
[32:56] message of the hour
[32:58] pleasures of this life and remember
[33:01] they're just pleasurable for a
[33:03] season the the pleasures will only last
[33:05] for a few moments that's why it's better
[33:08] to enjoy the pleasures of God hallelujah
[33:10] because they're Eternal
[33:13] Hallelujah but the RAM said the life
[33:15] just like a stock a wheat grain the the
[33:18] life sprouted up and you saw the Sprout
[33:20] which was Luther and then he says uh you
[33:23] see Wesley the stalk and then you see
[33:26] the chaff Pentecost but then it comes to
[33:28] the full grain how many want to be a
[33:30] full grain
[33:31] believer you want to be the full seed
[33:34] the full power of God oh there's power
[33:36] in the seed look at you you're all
[33:38] examples there's power in the seed
[33:40] hallelujah oh
[33:43] my so let's go back I thought of this
[33:45] today who remembers uh Mo Martin
[33:48] Luther's most famous words anybody
[33:50] remember he said here I
[33:53] stand
[33:55] 15:21 Martin Luther stood in defense of
[33:58] his doctrine of justification at the
[34:00] diet of worms it looks like worms but
[34:02] it's not worms it's
[34:04] worms uh April 18th 1521 he was standing
[34:09] before the pope and all the Cardinals
[34:12] and it was a life or death situation now
[34:14] think about what the squeeze might come
[34:15] down to that's why I'm saying this
[34:17] brother BR said that that same power in
[34:18] the Roman Church is eventually going to
[34:20] come to America because she's the beast
[34:23] out of the
[34:24] land and then remember I love how Jesus
[34:26] said Jesus said don't don't take thought
[34:28] what you'd say when you're brought
[34:29] before the council he says my father
[34:32] will give you what to say in that hour
[34:35] Hallelujah so here's Jesus backing up
[34:38] his word giving Martin Luther the words
[34:40] to say and he didn't have anything he
[34:42] was in he was in chains before the
[34:44] council he didn't have any notes he
[34:46] could go to now as a preacher I really
[34:47] like to have notes but if I don't I know
[34:49] God will give me the word I sure
[34:51] appreciate notes but Luther standing
[34:54] there and they they give him one more
[34:56] chance will you recant
[34:58] and live or will you go die now remember
[35:00] he got rescued after that he got rescued
[35:02] by people that dressed up like the
[35:03] Pope's guards and they took him off in
[35:06] hiding and dressed him up like a soldier
[35:08] so then during the day or the night time
[35:10] he could translate the Bible into
[35:13] German here's what the Holy Ghost gave
[35:15] Martin Luther now think about would you
[35:17] have the courage to say this if somebody
[35:20] asked you to recant of Jesus
[35:22] Christ he said unless I am convicted by
[35:26] scripture and plain
[35:31] reason I do not accept the authority of
[35:35] popes and councils in other words
[35:37] there's nothing in the Bible that says
[35:39] popes and councils will rule over the
[35:41] church and there's no reasoning to put
[35:44] that into the word of God I don't see
[35:46] scripture and I don't see any
[35:48] reasoning right the popes were trying to
[35:50] keep the word of God why would they want
[35:52] to keep the word of God out the hands of
[35:53] the people because the word has life
[35:56] it's the only thing thank God that
[35:58] you've got life
[36:00] Hallelujah so he has no notes all he can
[36:03] say it's what the Holy Ghost tells him
[36:04] to say unless I'm convicted by scripture
[36:07] this is a prophet of God now brother
[36:09] said he was a prophet one place another
[36:10] place he says he's not but one things
[36:12] for sure he's a he's a messenger of God
[36:14] he's a star in the hand of
[36:17] God unless the scripture convicts me or
[36:20] plain reason I do not accept the
[36:22] authority of popes and councils that's
[36:24] why I don't accept the authority of any
[36:26] uh uh of any brandom Tabernacle or any
[36:29] other Church there's only one Authority
[36:31] that's
[36:33] Christ for they have contradicted each
[36:35] other so let me stop stop right there
[36:38] why doesn't he accept the pope because
[36:40] they contradict
[36:41] themselves why don't we accept brandom
[36:43] Tabernacle other churches because they
[36:45] contradict themselves they they they lie
[36:47] they say one thing and then they say the
[36:49] other thing the Bible said we should all
[36:51] say the same thing
[36:53] Hallelujah so what the Holy Ghost give
[36:55] the church age Messenger right before he
[36:58] could possibly be be killed what the
[37:00] Holy Ghost give him I cannot go against
[37:02] my conviction of the scripture because
[37:05] alls I see is I see you compromising and
[37:07] I see you contradicting yourself Church
[37:10] don't follow any
[37:12] lie if you see somebody contradict
[37:14] themselves go ask them about it you can
[37:16] do it in a nice way right you can say
[37:18] please help me understand you said this
[37:20] here you said that there did you mean to
[37:23] say that did you make a mistake I'm
[37:25] waiting for that there's certain people
[37:26] that have prophesied a certain preacher
[37:27] is going to be healed in the name of
[37:30] Jesus Christ from stage four cancer and
[37:32] I'm watching that now if this man dies
[37:35] I'm going to reach out to them and say
[37:36] I'm not going to straight accuse them of
[37:38] prophesying a lie I'm going to say did
[37:39] God reveal something else to you that
[37:41] changes prophecy you know why because I
[37:43] want to be
[37:45] respectful Hallelujah but if anybody
[37:47] says something in the name of the Lord
[37:49] they better make sure it's from the
[37:54] Lord he says for that you have
[37:57] contradicted each other my conscience is
[38:00] captive to the word of
[38:02] God my conscience only takes uh uh
[38:06] inspiration from the word of God not
[38:08] counsels not men not Authority I only am
[38:11] captured I I only think what the Bible
[38:14] says for me to
[38:16] think he says I cannot and will not
[38:20] recant
[38:22] anything for to go against conscience is
[38:25] neither right nor safe so what does it
[38:28] boil down to he has to stand upon his
[38:32] convictions he doesn't have a miracle he
[38:34] doesn't break out one of his gifts of
[38:36] the Spirit right and start doing
[38:37] Miracles he just speaks what the father
[38:40] gives him in that hour he's just willing
[38:42] to die for the truth he's willing to
[38:45] stand on the conviction that God placed
[38:48] in our heart church we ought to be
[38:49] thankful when God gives us a conviction
[38:51] that we can stand upon
[38:58] I cannot and real and will not recant
[39:00] anything for to go against my conscience
[39:02] neither right nor safe here I
[39:05] stand I cannot do otherwise God help me
[39:10] amen so he's facing death in the face
[39:14] from this uh religious government and he
[39:16] says I'm not going to follow people that
[39:19] contradict
[39:21] themselves I only take I only take
[39:24] confidence in the word of God because
[39:26] the Bible doesn't contradict itself God
[39:28] cannot lie God always tells the truth
[39:31] God's word can never fail God's word is
[39:33] eternal God's word is harmonious
[39:36] Hallelujah and here I stand I stand upon
[39:39] the word of
[39:41] God I cannot do otherwise God help me
[39:46] amen God help us to stand on the word of
[39:49] God no matter who leaves you no matter
[39:52] who forsakes you no matter who mocks you
[39:55] makes fun of you tries to persecute you
[39:57] stand on the word of God that's all
[39:59] God's asking you to
[40:02] do brother Braham sat now listen listen
[40:05] but said that life came out of Luther
[40:07] into Wesley so what did Wesley do he
[40:09] stood in front of those crowds and he
[40:11] let a few Stones hit him right he had to
[40:13] dodge we watched a we watched a Wesley
[40:15] video this week didn't we
[40:16] Caris the guys knocked him down and they
[40:19] picked him up again then he started
[40:20] preaching to him and it brought
[40:21] conviction to these guys that were going
[40:22] to beat him up and kill him his just his
[40:24] humility he kep he kept calling them
[40:26] good sir good good sir and these these
[40:28] angry mobs got mad like we're not good
[40:30] what do you mean he kept saying good sir
[40:32] he kept uh being humble and then
[40:34] eventually these leaders repented God
[40:36] spared his
[40:37] life now church that life is in
[40:40] you did everybody hear me the life that
[40:44] was in Luther to stand there and say I
[40:46] won't go against the word I'm not going
[40:48] to compromise that life went into John
[40:51] Wesley that life went into William
[40:54] Seymour that life went into William
[40:56] brandom and now that life is in you
[40:58] Hallelujah same life it's not a
[41:01] different life it's the same life
[41:03] Hallelujah Romans 9 uh Romans 5:9 and 10
[41:07] tell us this much more then being now
[41:09] justified by his blood we shall be saved
[41:11] from wrath through
[41:13] him for if when we were enemies we were
[41:16] reconciled to God by the death of his
[41:18] son much more being reconciled we shall
[41:21] be saved by what his
[41:24] life see that life that was in Luther to
[41:27] stand there against an angry councel
[41:30] that would murder you like a trial a
[41:32] death sense that same life that was in
[41:34] Luther is in
[41:37] you and church that's how we know
[41:39] preachers even Bram Tabernacle any ones
[41:41] that contradict themselves we cannot
[41:43] follow what they say Bram Tabernacle
[41:46] will say uh every word is thus sayith
[41:48] the Lord and and it's infallible brother
[41:50] br will say I'm not infallible now who's
[41:52] who's
[41:53] right brother br will say there's mixups
[41:56] on the tapes Bram tab Tabernacle will
[41:57] say every word on tape is thus sayith
[41:59] the
[41:59] Lord so see there's
[42:02] contradictions and so we must use what
[42:04] God gave us God gave us a human Spirit
[42:07] we must use this in order to discern
[42:09] good from Evil thank God there's The
[42:11] Spar of discernment in the church today
[42:13] it can judge if that spirit is from the
[42:15] devil or that spirit is from God
[42:17] hallelujah said the bride comes out of
[42:20] each
[42:21] age the denominational shut dies so each
[42:24] one dies the life is coming up right to
[42:26] the seed so that other part gets ready
[42:28] to die and the life keeps going on he
[42:30] said life flows right out of the shuck
[42:32] into the wheat you can't beat nature
[42:35] that's how God does these things so I
[42:38] hope somebody's encouraged today if the
[42:40] life that was in Martin Luther Flo into
[42:43] Wesley and then William Seymour and then
[42:45] brother brandham remember brother Bram
[42:47] said he would be in meetings overseas I
[42:48] think it was Germany if I'm not mistaken
[42:49] maybe Finland and he said they had to
[42:51] have armed guards protecting him because
[42:53] there was snipers out there going to
[42:54] shoot him so there was time he was in
[42:57] very dangerous situations now what
[42:59] caused him to do that the same life that
[43:01] was in Luther was in William brandom
[43:03] Hallelujah willing to put his life on
[43:06] the line in order to stand for the truth
[43:09] and so we have that same life we must be
[43:12] willing to put our lives on the line to
[43:14] stand for the truth of God that goes
[43:16] with our conscience that goes with the
[43:18] word of
[43:24] God you cannot beat nature that's how
[43:28] God does things and remember this I'm
[43:30] going to preach a little bit maybe on
[43:31] the election here tonight but remember
[43:32] this Jesus said the tears will be bound
[43:35] first before the weat is
[43:37] Harvest so brother R said brother Ram
[43:39] says in the church book this is
[43:41] happening now the tears are being bound
[43:43] together in an economical
[43:46] movement now right now Church of course
[43:48] we see this in the Democratic party but
[43:50] like I showed you a few months ago this
[43:51] is also in the Republican
[43:54] party right uh the Christians are
[43:56] uniting with Hind hus and siks and Janes
[43:59] uh and and Jews and and they're all
[44:01] uniting what it seems like to be for a
[44:03] good cause but if but if they contradict
[44:07] God's word and say that the god of the
[44:09] seeks is the god of Christianity now
[44:11] they're lying now that's
[44:14] Antichrist right that's why we don't
[44:16] Unite with parties right because we're
[44:19] already United to Christ it's time for
[44:21] Christ and the bride to unite
[44:28] you can't beat nature Luke 17:30 as it
[44:31] was in the days of Sodom he said when
[44:33] the Son of Man reveals himself the word
[44:36] made known for the day he said the Holy
[44:39] Spirit making that word live amongst us
[44:42] now that's what we should pray for
[44:44] that's what we should strive for Lord
[44:46] let your spirit live amongst
[44:49] us
[44:51] hallelujah Glory that's what uh brother
[44:55] says
[44:57] no now I'm going to say this he says he
[44:59] said' let the Holy Spirit make the word
[45:00] live among us he said but I said we can
[45:03] still listen and hear the son of man on
[45:07] tape right we can still hear the voice
[45:09] of the Holy Spirit speaking through
[45:11] brother
[45:12] brandham Hallelujah Discerning the
[45:15] thoughts and intents of the heart now
[45:16] I'm going to pull up a a quote I sent to
[45:18] Troy suy this week he and I were texting
[45:20] you shouldn't take me just a second man
[45:21] it's amazing how many texts you get in a
[45:23] week in 1959 did you know the Holy Ghost
[45:26] took over brother Ram's voice while he
[45:27] was doing a discernment line did you
[45:29] ever hear this
[45:30] quote brother Ram said is he pulsating
[45:34] you so who's giving you life is it
[45:36] Christ or is it your own human life now
[45:39] look brother man he instantly goes to
[45:41] this he says I'm the Lord that raised up
[45:44] Christ from the grave brother R's
[45:45] talking he's saying I'm the Lord that
[45:46] raised up Christ from the dead I'm the
[45:49] one that sent the Holy
[45:51] Ghost brother is quoting this I'm the
[45:53] one that give the promise brother
[45:55] brandham has nothing to do in
[45:58] this and the church
[46:00] said now he had to yield himself but
[46:03] we're talking about the power who has
[46:04] power to raise Jesus from the grave
[46:06] brother random no only God could do that
[46:09] that's what he's saying other words God
[46:11] has orchestrated that I'm sending my
[46:13] seven Church age messenger I'm sending
[46:15] the seventh angel to finish the mystery
[46:17] of God to show the son of man sign to
[46:20] the Gentiles because the Gentiles never
[46:22] saw the Messiah side only the Jews and
[46:24] Samaritans but thank God the Gentiles
[46:27] get to see it
[46:28] Hallelujah you know one of the greatest
[46:29] compliments I ever got was was from
[46:31] Sister FL Florence Humes down there in
[46:34] North Carolina she was the one healed
[46:35] when brother Bram prayed for her over
[46:37] tuberculosis in 1956 after the sermon
[46:40] she shook my hand she said You Preach
[46:41] just like brother brandham and I said
[46:44] thank you sister that's probably the one
[46:45] of the greatest compliments I could ever
[46:47] get to try to preach just like the
[46:49] prophet of God not trying to in purpose
[46:52] on purpose to mimic him but to preach
[46:54] the same word that he preached
[46:56] Hallelujah that the life of brother
[46:58] randam which was really the life of
[46:59] Martin Luther and John Wesley could now
[47:02] flow from the the church age messenger
[47:04] into the fivefold ministry
[47:09] Hallelujah he said brother brandom has
[47:11] nothing to do in this he's only
[47:14] surrendered his life to
[47:16] me I'm using his Spirit I'm talking
[47:19] through his lips that's me I'm the
[47:23] Lord this is and preachers have used
[47:25] this over the years that's how yielded
[47:27] brother randam was to the Holy Ghost
[47:30] remember he'd say I'm kind of stalling
[47:31] now he would tell stories about
[47:33] discernment you know the woman at the
[47:34] well he then he say oh he's here
[47:37] now and that's when the Holy Ghost would
[47:40] take over he'd say I take every Spirit
[47:42] under my control for the glory of Jesus
[47:45] Christ Hallelujah that same son of man
[47:48] Ministry that was in Jesus Hall that
[47:51] Jesus was Hallelujah and he was so
[47:53] yielded he could say it's has nothing to
[47:55] do with brother randam it's God I'm
[47:57] using his lips and God help us that God
[48:00] could speak through our lips
[48:02] Hallelujah that we could talk the same
[48:04] thing the spirit would say because the
[48:06] spirit and the bride say come to the
[48:08] marriage supper of the Lamb
[48:13] hallelujah what a
[48:15] blessing bam said then God Discerning
[48:19] like Luke 17:30 turned his back to Sarah
[48:21] in the tent and Sarah laughed but it was
[48:24] God Discerning her heart just like was
[48:27] God Discerning the hearts of the people
[48:29] in brother bram's
[48:30] Ministry he says uh but that God was
[48:34] Elohim and that Elohim was Jesus so it
[48:36] was Jesus in the days of Abraham and
[48:38] Sarah it was the spirit of God not the
[48:40] body of Christ formed in the Virgin Mary
[48:43] but it was the spirit of Jesus the
[48:46] logos and brother manam said the Bible
[48:48] predicts it will return again in the
[48:50] last
[48:51] days he says and when it does he says
[48:54] this happens he said today it is Sodom
[48:58] if there ever was a Sodom think about
[49:00] that statement from
[49:02] 1965 couldn't we say the same today if
[49:05] there ever was a Sodom it's a Sodom
[49:07] today he said their minds are so
[49:09] perverted he said the people are on the
[49:12] Rampage of in indecency men are hanging
[49:16] on to their tradition he said they're
[49:18] blind to the word of God now we come to
[49:21] near nearly the hour mark of this sermon
[49:23] and brother B says we better hurry I
[49:26] think that lady wants us to leave I see
[49:28] her motioning her hand we better
[49:31] hurry and then he preaches for 42
[49:33] minutes that's kind of like me I'll say
[49:34] I'm going to close but it's going to be
[49:35] 42 minutes later okay but that's that's
[49:38] how brother did it if you listen to it
[49:40] there's still 42 minutes left and then
[49:42] he takes eight more minutes on more
[49:44] types of the Rapture after going deep
[49:47] into Revelation 10 and the life of God
[49:50] in the
[49:51] church he says we are now living in the
[49:53] seven Church Age The Mysteries would be
[49:55] revealed by the son a man confirming his
[49:59] message the set now now he he breaks
[50:02] into an interesting thought I don't know
[50:03] if you ever heard this
[50:04] lately he said Enoch comes in the
[50:07] seventh watch now I think he meant to
[50:09] say Church age because then he goes into
[50:12] how the night was divided into four
[50:13] watches how many know it was divided
[50:15] into four four
[50:16] watches from 6:00 p.m. to 900 P p.m. was
[50:19] the first watch of the night right
[50:22] because Jews started the day at sundown
[50:24] they started the next day at sundown we
[50:25] started uh at in the middle of the night
[50:27] really the second watch was 9 to
[50:31] midnight I was up last night with Zion
[50:33] coffin at midnight the second watch I
[50:34] was up going to the Third Watch so was
[50:36] Mal Lydia the Third Watch was 12 a.m. to
[50:40] 3:00
[50:41] a.m. and the Fourth Watch was 3:00 a.m.
[50:44] to 6:00 a.m. brother R somehow breaks
[50:47] into this thought here and I don't have
[50:49] quite this understood but I just want to
[50:50] let you know about
[50:52] it brother said now the seventh watch
[50:55] Enoch
[50:56] he says ' the night wasn't divided in
[50:58] hours there's three watches of the night
[51:01] but actually then he says uh oh okay
[51:05] yeah he says three watches but there's
[51:06] actually four the Bible says there's
[51:07] four
[51:09] watches now and brother R said now I
[51:11] believe the Rapture will take place some
[51:14] morning between 6: and 9 a.m. and then
[51:18] he quotes the hymn The Trumpet of the
[51:21] Lord shall sound on that bright and
[51:23] cloudless morning when the dead in
[51:25] Christ shall rise and and the glory of
[51:27] his resurrection share how many know
[51:29] there's people that they believe the
[51:30] Rapture is going to happen between 6:00
[51:32] and 9:00 a.m. there's songs about it
[51:34] there's a message song uh we used to
[51:36] sing it at Sheffield uh some early
[51:39] morning between s now they say 7 and 9
[51:41] something's going to happen on this
[51:42] Earth it's going to happen all around
[51:44] the earth it kind of starts off with
[51:45] between seven and nine but here brother
[51:47] Ram says six and
[51:49] nine but if you go to Acts chapter 2 I
[51:52] think there is some some little evidence
[51:55] we can get here or maybe like a clue
[51:57] perhaps it's not but
[52:00] uh the Bible says it was yet not the
[52:03] third hour of the
[52:06] day uh acts 2:15 for these are not
[52:10] drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but
[52:12] the third hour of the day when did the
[52:14] Holy Ghost fall to start the church the
[52:17] third hour day that would have been 9:00
[52:19] a. so the Holy Ghost fell before 9:00
[52:22] a.m. cuz first they had to receive it
[52:25] they had to worship and then they had to
[52:26] go out in the streets and declare all
[52:28] the wonderful works of God
[52:31] hallelujah so uh is it thus sayith the
[52:34] Lord the Rapture is going to happen
[52:35] between 6:00 and 9:00 a.m. no but we do
[52:38] have at least one Bible witness if the
[52:40] if the church ages started between six
[52:42] and N perhaps they'll finish between six
[52:45] and nine so the thing to be do or the
[52:48] thing to do church is be
[52:50] ready but if you want to know that's
[52:52] where we get this idea some people say
[52:54] oh the Rapture is going to be between
[52:55] six and N9 we get get it from this
[52:56] sermon the Rapture
[52:59] 1965
[53:02] Hallelujah then brother R says the word
[53:04] rapture is not even in the Bible at all
[53:06] the Bible uses the term caught up
[53:10] harpazo and then uh brother random reads
[53:13] he breaks right into his scripture he
[53:14] knows he doesn't have much time left the
[53:15] woman says you got to get out of this
[53:17] hotel he goes right to quoting first
[53:19] Thessalonians 41
[53:22] 13-16 and he misquotes the book he says
[53:26] let's go to Second
[53:29] Thessalonians okay so can everybody see
[53:31] that like I told you last week there's
[53:33] two obvious statements in this sermon
[53:35] that are clearly not thus sayith the
[53:37] Lord there is no shout voice and Trump
[53:40] in 2
[53:42] Thessalonians okay but what would it
[53:45] take somebody to say there is it is I
[53:48] believe it is thus sayith the Lord what
[53:50] would it take for somebody to believe
[53:51] that a lying
[53:53] Spirit Hallelujah
[53:56] let's have the spirit of Truth amongst
[53:58] us
[54:00] hallelujah glory to
[54:05] God he says there's three things that
[54:07] has to happen before the Lord appears a
[54:09] shout a voice and a trumpet this is at
[54:12] the hour and three minute Mark he says
[54:15] first comes a shout he said Jesus does
[54:18] all three of them when he's descending
[54:22] he says it's a shout what is a shout
[54:24] it's a message going forth first the
[54:26] living bread of life bringing forth the
[54:32] bride all right now some people call
[54:35] themselves The Midnight Cry now let me I
[54:37] just thought about that verse let me
[54:39] pull that one
[54:41] up there was a cry made now the word cry
[54:44] means a outcry or a
[54:47] clamor there was a Midnight Cry behold
[54:49] the bridegroom comes go out to meet them
[54:52] Hallelujah and the word trim your lamps
[54:54] means to set in order
[54:56] to make ready to prepare to
[55:00] ornament uh to embellish with honor to
[55:05] gain honor so the trim your lamps means
[55:08] to set your life in order ornament your
[55:10] life with the blood of Jesus Christ
[55:13] Hallelujah I'll say it like that in
[55:14] other words wash your garments white in
[55:16] the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah now
[55:20] see so brother Ram sets this up and
[55:21] church that's why you know as we talked
[55:23] last week you know this is how I believe
[55:25] the shop voice Trump I believe the shout
[55:27] started with brother random in 1963 now
[55:30] I could be wrong but I got a quote for
[55:32] it Hallelujah and the way he brings it
[55:35] out is that it has to make it ready he
[55:39] has uh he says it it's the Living Word
[55:42] bringing forth the bride how many know
[55:44] there are still people realizing their
[55:46] bride Church you just got to jump in
[55:48] your car right now you could be there in
[55:51] two hours and 40 minutes drive straight
[55:54] South let's see which way South here
[55:56] where am I at here North is that South
[56:00] that's
[56:02] North that's South I lost my bearings
[56:05] here yeah that's North I think right yep
[56:07] that's North so South so you got to
[56:09] drive that way two and a half hours
[56:11] drive that way and you'll run into a
[56:14] city uh called Junction City and you'll
[56:17] find some former Amish people that have
[56:19] just realize they're the bride
[56:22] Hallelujah the shout the Midnight Cry
[56:25] has gone out to them
[56:27] uh behold the bridegroom comes make
[56:29] yourself ready
[56:31] hallelujah oh my like brother iring gave
[56:33] us his testimony last month for was it
[56:36] 50 some years 56 years he didn't even
[56:38] know there was a Rapture but God was
[56:41] gracious and God sent him the Midnight
[56:42] Cry and now he's making himself ready
[56:45] Hallelujah I hope you're making yourself
[56:48] ready
[56:49] today don't fall into the sleep don't go
[56:52] back to sleep
[56:53] Hallelujah right that's what the parable
[56:55] says some people will fall asleep in
[56:57] their spiritual life let's stay
[56:59] awake Hallelujah keep your lamp trimmed
[57:02] keep your life in order to trim your
[57:05] lamp means to set it in order to arrange
[57:07] your life in a way that would please God
[57:09] and be ready for the
[57:12] Rapture he says Jesus does all of these
[57:14] while he's
[57:17] descending brother Ram says God never
[57:19] changes his
[57:20] policy Amos 37 he quotes Amos 37 surely
[57:25] the Lord God will do nothing but he
[57:26] Reveals His Secrets unto his servants
[57:28] the
[57:29] prophets God will do nothing until he
[57:31] reveals it to his servants the prophets
[57:33] and then he quotes Malachi 45 and 6
[57:35] behold I send you Elijah the prophet he
[57:38] shall turn the hearts of the children to
[57:41] the
[57:42] fathers
[57:44] Hallelujah he says Malachi 4 has
[57:47] returned again a prophet is in the
[57:50] land god uses that Elijah Spirit five
[57:53] times five is the number of great
[57:57] brother says remember the message is
[57:59] Promised the the rise and trim your lamp
[58:02] message of the Rapture and when all
[58:04] these Mi Mysteries has been all bundled
[58:06] up by a bunch of Ecclesiastes it will
[58:08] take a direct Prophet from God to reveal
[58:11] it and that's exactly what he promised
[58:13] to do he said the prophet is the
[58:16] reflector of God's word and then he even
[58:19] uses balam he said balum couldn't he
[58:22] could only say what God put in his mouth
[58:26] and then brother Ram says' whatever you
[58:27] were like a prophet a prophet is born
[58:29] that way whatever you are you were born
[58:32] that way you can't make yourself
[58:33] something that you're
[58:36] not and then he breaks into this thought
[58:38] like I said last week brother manam said
[58:40] nobody stood before the prophet to judge
[58:42] him and that's true I just want to say
[58:44] that one more time now the the most
[58:47] message churches are are misinterpreting
[58:49] this they're saying brother Ram says you
[58:52] know when there's a minor prophet in the
[58:53] church and they would say thus sayith
[58:55] the Lord tomorrow is going to happen two
[58:56] or three people need to pray about that
[58:58] and judge that is that from God or not
[59:00] before it's accepted by the church
[59:02] that's a gift of
[59:03] Prophecy and church even dreams uh even
[59:07] dreams that we have amongst ourselves
[59:09] they should be judged now we don't do
[59:11] that because what do we because none of
[59:13] us ever announced well I had a dream
[59:14] it's thus sayith the Lord who's ever
[59:15] done that here right we don't go around
[59:18] well I had a dream it's thus say the now
[59:20] if somebody said that then it's time to
[59:21] get some judges on that right somebody
[59:24] would say I had a dream is thus say the
[59:25] Lord okay now let's pray and judge it
[59:26] let's get who's got the sermon let's
[59:28] judge the
[59:29] dream but brother man said nobody stood
[59:31] before like prophet Isaiah or Prophet
[59:33] Moses to judge
[59:35] him and that's true nobody did but
[59:39] Church what did God do God gave Joshua
[59:42] Joshua was a prophet God gave Joshua
[59:44] vindications so the people knew he was a
[59:48] prophet so what I'm saying is nobody
[59:50] stands before a prophet but you still
[59:52] have to prove what the prophet says
[59:54] prove all things the Bible says amen
[59:57] does ever understand that amen
[59:59] hallelujah that's that's critical to
[1:00:00] understand because the the message
[1:00:02] churches are using this nobody nobody
[1:00:04] can correct a Prophet by basically
[1:00:06] saying nobody can disagree with the
[1:00:08] quotes that I
[1:00:09] like but there's other quotes on that
[1:00:11] same topic you have to consider
[1:00:16] Hallelujah so it's very important to
[1:00:18] recognize that quote yes nobody stood
[1:00:20] before Moses uh to to correct him or
[1:00:23] judge him but they still had to stand
[1:00:25] there and Pro prove all things to make
[1:00:26] sure it came to
[1:00:28] pass
[1:00:30] Hallelujah that's right so this nobody
[1:00:33] stands before a prophet to judge him
[1:00:35] that's only referring to the thus sayith
[1:00:37] the Lord From The
[1:00:39] Prophet it must apply to Isaiah when he
[1:00:41] said a vergin shall
[1:00:43] conceive and Prophets only wrote down
[1:00:46] what what God told them to write down
[1:00:49] they just have a gift to say what only
[1:00:51] God says right that's what a prophet has
[1:00:54] you and I would wonder and say I don't
[1:00:56] know if this is God or not but a prophet
[1:00:57] is not like that they know when God
[1:00:59] saying thus sayith the
[1:01:00] Lord that's that's just how they're
[1:01:03] built
[1:01:04] Hallelujah
[1:01:07] now he says there's such a thing as a
[1:01:10] gift of Prophecy he said but a prophet
[1:01:12] is ordained for the
[1:01:14] hour he said every Revival died when
[1:01:18] they organized like Pentecost of 1906
[1:01:20] I'm talking I'm I'm not talking about
[1:01:21] Pentecost of Acts chapter 2 that Revival
[1:01:24] is still going on Amen like we said last
[1:01:26] week how many have it still burning in
[1:01:28] your heart it's burning now within my
[1:01:31] heart Oh Glory to his name
[1:01:33] Hallelujah I'm one of them I'm so glad I
[1:01:36] can say I'm one of them
[1:01:39] Hallelujah he said every Revival did the
[1:01:42] same thing he said you Assemblies of God
[1:01:45] you turn like a dog to its vomit he said
[1:01:47] you shut up your vows of
[1:01:49] compassion and now you have to have
[1:01:51] almost a fellowship card to even
[1:01:53] associate harle
[1:01:56] so bam says see they went into
[1:01:58] organization you got to have some type
[1:02:00] of aard to even fellowship with
[1:02:03] somebody that's an organization and
[1:02:05] that's what I was telling my children
[1:02:06] you know they were asking about the
[1:02:07] fourth horse rider I no maybe it was
[1:02:09] brother Claude or brother Patrick last
[1:02:11] week after church it was Cloud am thank
[1:02:13] good memory sir good memory that fourth
[1:02:16] horse rider is writing now his name is
[1:02:18] death and brother Braham said see now
[1:02:21] brother Braham said God I don't know if
[1:02:23] you know this brother Braham said God
[1:02:24] accepted seminaries and organ
[1:02:25] organizations till this end
[1:02:28] time because now the horse rider riding
[1:02:30] and those organizations are dead think
[1:02:33] about that church did you know Martin
[1:02:34] Luther went to a seminary do you know
[1:02:36] John Wesley was taught vigorously in the
[1:02:38] word of God Charles Spurgeon went to
[1:02:41] Seminary something brother calls them
[1:02:42] the greatest preachers that preach the
[1:02:44] greatest sermons with the greatest
[1:02:45] writing and they went to Seminary
[1:02:47] brother raham said God had a season to
[1:02:49] use it but now that season's over
[1:02:51] because death is riding spiritual death
[1:02:54] has struck the denominations church we
[1:02:56] should have life here we should have the
[1:02:57] same life of Martin Luther in this
[1:02:59] church amen if we are the true bride of
[1:03:02] Christ Hallelujah which I believe amen I
[1:03:04] believe I'm a part of it praise God well
[1:03:07] then let's Express The Life of Christ
[1:03:10] let's show the love of Jesus Christ
[1:03:11] let's pray for the power of God to move
[1:03:14] let's have the same Life of Christ
[1:03:19] Hallelujah then he now he rebukes
[1:03:21] Assemblies of God then he rebukes the
[1:03:23] Oneness which is closer to us
[1:03:26] you Oneness he said instead of just
[1:03:28] going ahead and keeping humble with your
[1:03:31] Revelation that God's one person you
[1:03:33] organize your group and where you at now
[1:03:36] he said the same bucket of
[1:03:38] slops right and I have numerous oness
[1:03:41] friends of we've brother Jose is that is
[1:03:44] that AC church is that a Oneness or is
[1:03:46] that a trinitarian
[1:03:47] church do do you know it's okay if you
[1:03:49] don't
[1:03:52] know Unitarian one one one one God okay
[1:03:56] so they're are Oneness yeah so they
[1:03:58] might be a part of the UPC United
[1:04:00] Pentecostal
[1:04:03] Church okay right and they used to not
[1:04:07] so they're slowly compromising like when
[1:04:09] I like uh even in the early 2000s when I
[1:04:12] went to the West Church's ey they
[1:04:14] actually didn't wear high heels and they
[1:04:15] didn't let women preach but now they let
[1:04:17] women preach and now they wear high
[1:04:18] heels so just within 20 years the
[1:04:21] majority of them has compromised see
[1:04:23] that's what happens when you compromise
[1:04:25] on the word of God death sets in oh
[1:04:28] Church we've got to earnestly contend
[1:04:30] for the faith that was once delivered
[1:04:31] for the saints that will keep us in the
[1:04:34] life of God that will keep us in the
[1:04:37] love of God we can make no compromises
[1:04:39] we must live based upon our conscience
[1:04:42] of what the word of God says here we
[1:04:44] stand on God's word
[1:04:46] hallelujah oh glory to God thank you
[1:04:50] Jesus he said it's God's spirit moving
[1:04:53] on
[1:04:56] brother Ram said God's spirit will keep
[1:04:57] moving on uh let me look up a verse real
[1:05:00] quick ACAA I forgot to look this this
[1:05:02] one up
[1:05:04] plant
[1:05:10] water there's a scripture brother B
[1:05:12] quotes where I he said I the Lord God
[1:05:15] have planted it and I will water it day
[1:05:17] and
[1:05:19] night anybody know what verse I'm
[1:05:21] talking about I can't find it you water
[1:05:25] it plant anth in water day and night
[1:05:27] I'll look it up Lord wining for the
[1:05:28] second
[1:05:30] service thank you for your patience
[1:05:33] here I the Lord have planted it and I
[1:05:35] will water it day and
[1:05:38] night so brother raham is basically
[1:05:40] showing if a church won't take the water
[1:05:42] of the word of God God will send water
[1:05:45] to the fresh Revival amen he'll bring a
[1:05:47] church out of a church Hallelujah that's
[1:05:49] right glory to God Amen I'm coming down
[1:05:52] on my clothes here by God's grace
[1:05:55] Hallelujah
[1:05:56] now after that break he gets back to the
[1:05:58] shout voice and Trump after he looked at
[1:06:01] uh the idea on
[1:06:03] prophets
[1:06:05] Hallelujah he says now the first thing
[1:06:07] comes when he starts descending from
[1:06:09] Heaven there's a shout now here's where
[1:06:11] people disagree and which they're
[1:06:13] allowed
[1:06:14] to brother Braham said while Jesus is
[1:06:16] descending the shout Goes Forth that's
[1:06:20] where some people and you know I
[1:06:21] understand it too it's hard to
[1:06:22] understand how is he descending and then
[1:06:25] how is the Rapture already started right
[1:06:28] that's hard to understand I said that we
[1:06:29] were talking about that last week but
[1:06:31] there's a quote on it that's what
[1:06:32] brother says there's a shout what is it
[1:06:34] it's a message to get the people
[1:06:36] together a message comes forth now lamp
[1:06:38] trimming time so he says it twice in the
[1:06:40] sermon rise and trim your lamps watch or
[1:06:44] what watch was that the seventh or not
[1:06:46] the sixth I think he's talking about the
[1:06:47] church age what church age was that the
[1:06:50] seventh behold the bridegroom cometh
[1:06:52] rise and trim your lamps and they did
[1:06:54] some of them found they didn't have any
[1:06:55] oil in their lamp see but it's lamp
[1:06:58] trimming time so church it's lamp
[1:07:00] trimming time set your lives in order he
[1:07:02] said it's Malachai 4 time our hearts
[1:07:05] getting turned back to the apostolic
[1:07:07] father he said it's Luke 17 time amen
[1:07:11] the son of man Discerning the thoughts
[1:07:13] and intents of our hearts Hallelujah all
[1:07:16] these prophecy that can fit perfectly
[1:07:17] set in order for this day in the
[1:07:19] scripture we see it living right here so
[1:07:22] brother could say I see all these verses
[1:07:25] living right now amongst us I see John
[1:07:28] 1613 living right here God is guiding us
[1:07:31] into all truth
[1:07:32] hallelujah I see Ephesians 4 living
[1:07:35] amongst us the Holy Ghost through the
[1:07:37] five-fold ministry is bringing us into
[1:07:39] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:07:41] it's uniting our faith Hallelujah faith
[1:07:44] in the word of God
[1:07:46] hallelujah amen see that's what the true
[1:07:49] bride of Christ does they focus on what
[1:07:51] unifies them not what divides them
[1:07:53] Hallelujah and that's what God is doing
[1:07:55] with our church God Is uniting Us with
[1:07:57] all the churches that are born again
[1:07:58] God's uniting us under the true
[1:08:00] doctrines the true Revelations the
[1:08:02] Mysteries that's been finished
[1:08:04] Hallelujah God's uniting our hearts with
[1:08:06] them that's right it's uniting time
[1:08:11] Hallelujah now look at this statement
[1:08:13] brother Ram says he quotes uh lamp
[1:08:16] trimming time Malachi four time Luke
[1:08:18] 17:30 son of man Ministry time and then
[1:08:20] he says I see these things happen my
[1:08:22] dear brother when God in heaven knows I
[1:08:25] could die on this platform right now
[1:08:27] that that's quite a statement brother R
[1:08:30] says these are coming to pass and
[1:08:31] they're coming to pass I could die on
[1:08:33] this platform now if I'm not telling the
[1:08:35] truth and what was the last time you
[1:08:36] heard a preacher say that see brother M
[1:08:39] was trying to get the people to see God
[1:08:41] is fulfilling these
[1:08:43] scriptures
[1:08:45] Hallelujah you just ought to walk around
[1:08:48] a little he said it's tremendous when
[1:08:50] you see God come down from heaven stand
[1:08:52] before groups of men and stand there
[1:08:53] declare himself just as he ever did
[1:08:55] that's the truth this Bible
[1:08:58] open and the denominational system is
[1:09:00] dead it's gone it'll never rise again
[1:09:03] it'll be burned that's what you do with
[1:09:05] the husk on the field look he goes back
[1:09:07] to
[1:09:07] Nature flee from it get into Christ and
[1:09:11] how do you get into Christ by one Spirit
[1:09:12] we're all baptized into that
[1:09:15] body
[1:09:18] Hallelujah don't say I belong to
[1:09:20] Methodist I belong to baptist I belong
[1:09:23] to Pentecostal I belong to bride of
[1:09:25] Christ
[1:09:26] Fellowship you get into Christ we don't
[1:09:29] belong to anybody but
[1:09:31] Jesus Hallelujah now brother br will
[1:09:34] present us as a bride to Christ but we
[1:09:36] don't even belong to brother brandham we
[1:09:37] belong to Jesus hallelujah we're the
[1:09:40] bride of Christ not the Bride of a
[1:09:41] prophet or a bride of a messenger we're
[1:09:43] the Bride of Jesus
[1:09:48] Christ and if you're in Christ there's
[1:09:51] not a word written in here but what you
[1:09:54] believe and he didn't raise up his
[1:09:56] church age book or anything like that
[1:09:57] now the church age book is a good book
[1:09:59] but he raised up the
[1:10:01] Bible I don't care what anybody else
[1:10:03] said and then God makes that thing
[1:10:05] manifested because you when he pours the
[1:10:07] spirit upon the word what happens it's
[1:10:10] just like putting water on any seed
[1:10:12] it'll live and it'll bring forth of its
[1:10:15] own
[1:10:16] kind so see Church anyone that walks in
[1:10:18] here I've i' I've preached too long not
[1:10:20] to understand it if I'm preaching under
[1:10:22] the anointing of the Holy Spirit and the
[1:10:24] and they accept it if they let that
[1:10:26] water fall in there and there's a seed
[1:10:28] in there it will bring forth Hallelujah
[1:10:31] nothing is going to stop it because it's
[1:10:33] the word of God
[1:10:35] hallelujah we just planted some echonous
[1:10:38] seeds you know at school and the W the
[1:10:40] the teacher said just puts just put it
[1:10:42] there by the window put some water on it
[1:10:43] it'll sprout right and my wife said yeah
[1:10:45] you could do that just throw it outside
[1:10:47] it'll Sprout on its own you don't got to
[1:10:48] put it by the window and I just poured a
[1:10:50] few waters in it pretty soon after a few
[1:10:52] days they start sprouting up and the
[1:10:53] kids come right up and say it's sprouted
[1:10:55] it's sprouted that's what happens here
[1:10:57] when we preach the word of God if water
[1:10:59] falls on it and it's a genuine seed of
[1:11:01] God people will believe the word they'll
[1:11:03] love the Bible
[1:11:04] Hallelujah because the seed that's in
[1:11:06] them wrote the Bible
[1:11:08] Hallelujah so we have nothing to worry
[1:11:10] about praise God all that's
[1:11:12] predestinated will come to God
[1:11:14] hallelujah because it's a seed it's the
[1:11:16] life it's the power of the seed working
[1:11:19] in The Believer it's a seed of God
[1:11:21] working in me
[1:11:23] Hallelujah glory to God
[1:11:26] the seed must bring forth of its own
[1:11:32] kind now brother BR breaks into a real
[1:11:35] he calls it Stinger later or earlier he
[1:11:37] calls it a real
[1:11:40] Stinger you Pentecostals say I got the
[1:11:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost brother BR
[1:11:45] said that don't mean that you're saved
[1:11:46] not by long ways a church I I told you
[1:11:50] this story I don't I don't know if you
[1:11:51] remember it was probably uh 2008 or 2009
[1:11:55] I I was in a Minister's meeting with
[1:11:56] brother cam brother Brooks there in Lima
[1:11:59] Ohio and a brother was there and at the
[1:12:01] end of the The Minister's meeting he
[1:12:03] read that quote and he said what does
[1:12:04] this mean how can you have the Holy
[1:12:06] Ghost uh and not be saved and he went on
[1:12:09] he said is it this is it that and I was
[1:12:11] just a young Pastor I didn't know well
[1:12:13] when I got home I thought well I'm Just
[1:12:14] a Fool I'll just go read what brother
[1:12:16] Ram say I read it and then right after
[1:12:18] it look at the next word so I was
[1:12:20] puzzled this Minister puzzled uh puzzled
[1:12:23] all of us right
[1:12:26] and then what when I went home and read
[1:12:27] it I just read the next sentence the
[1:12:30] next two sentences brother R says'
[1:12:31] lookie here you're a Triune being so
[1:12:35] what's he getting into the three parts
[1:12:36] of man brother R says Pentecostals
[1:12:39] they'll all say it right they'll say it
[1:12:41] at at the AC Church they said it at at
[1:12:44] my church growing up they say I've got
[1:12:45] the baptism I've spoken tongues and
[1:12:47] brother man said you can have that
[1:12:49] baptism and you're not even saved
[1:12:51] sometimes because you're a Triune
[1:12:53] being right so look look how simple look
[1:12:56] how simple this this this question is
[1:12:59] answered if we just keep reading in the
[1:13:01] quote now the reason I bring this up is
[1:13:03] because I eventually had that preacher
[1:13:05] come preach for us out of kindness we
[1:13:06] had some good Fellowship but then within
[1:13:08] 10 years he left the message uh and he
[1:13:11] denied brother R was a prophet he said
[1:13:12] brother R was a racist um I think he was
[1:13:15] upset because he didn't get a pastor
[1:13:17] position he was trying to get and so a
[1:13:19] lot of people when they get hurt by
[1:13:21] message churches or message people
[1:13:23] they'll turn on them and just go and
[1:13:25] find all these things that make it look
[1:13:27] like there's something wrong with the
[1:13:29] message and then I even have a
[1:13:30] screenshot still this day he uh he went
[1:13:33] to this denom and he was playing rock
[1:13:35] and roll he was he was the bass guitar
[1:13:36] for the rock and roll Christian band and
[1:13:39] he posted it on Facebook when I used to
[1:13:40] be on Facebook and he said what a
[1:13:42] blankety blank sermon today pastor and
[1:13:44] he used cuss words he said what a
[1:13:46] blankety blank sermon that was I mean
[1:13:50] cursing about a sermon a man who used to
[1:13:53] say he had the Holy Ghost
[1:13:55] a man that used to dress modestly but
[1:13:58] now doesn't dress modestly his wife used
[1:14:00] to have long hair now she cuts her hair
[1:14:01] and wears pants and wears
[1:14:03] makeup see these little things these
[1:14:06] little things that people don't sit down
[1:14:08] long enough brother says they don't get
[1:14:09] in the spirit of Revelation may God help
[1:14:11] us to get in the spirit of Revelation
[1:14:12] Hallelujah may we dig deeper May the
[1:14:15] Holy Ghost take us deeper in the word of
[1:14:16] God so we're not fooled by these things
[1:14:18] so we can't be offended out of the
[1:14:20] message but we go deeper into the
[1:14:21] message of God's word
[1:14:23] hallelujah oh my so what did I do when
[1:14:27] when I'm when I'm faced with that
[1:14:28] question what I do I go back to the
[1:14:30] quote and read the quote again and then
[1:14:31] take that back to the
[1:14:33] scripture this guy just goes on U
[1:14:36] doesn't read the rest of it doesn't go
[1:14:38] back to the scripture doesn't ask
[1:14:39] questions gets offended and then now
[1:14:41] turns on the message each of us have a
[1:14:43] choice what are you going to do with
[1:14:44] this Jesus called
[1:14:47] Christ what are you going to do
[1:14:50] Hallelujah time is the greatest tester
[1:14:53] of all things give it some time let's
[1:14:56] see I remember a a brother that used to
[1:14:59] be in the
[1:15:00] message he he gave a good word uh this
[1:15:03] I'll just say brother Tim Myers you know
[1:15:05] when I preached down there U remember in
[1:15:06] 2017 you you were just a little guy I
[1:15:10] preached down there and God fully
[1:15:11] Vindicated that that that message on the
[1:15:13] Waters of Separation after that brother
[1:15:15] Tim Myers reached out to George Smith
[1:15:17] Brother Ram son-in-law and brother Tim
[1:15:19] told me this he said brother Jesse's uh
[1:15:21] gifted by God and and you know what
[1:15:23] brother George said brother law he said
[1:15:26] let's just give him some time and let's
[1:15:27] see what comes out of his life before we
[1:15:30] get too excited about brother Jesse's
[1:15:31] Ministry let's give him some time I
[1:15:34] thought that's a real wise man right
[1:15:35] there now I've never talked to him uh
[1:15:37] Jose emails him and calls him right
[1:15:40] brother so look here we are uh three
[1:15:43] seven years later almost eight years
[1:15:44] later given brother Jesse some time have
[1:15:47] I stayed with the message or have I gone
[1:15:49] against it I've stayed with it I Believe
[1:15:50] by the grace of God I've only tried to
[1:15:53] defend it more growing more revelation
[1:15:55] of it Hallelujah uh understand it more
[1:15:58] preach it amen and more than that live
[1:16:00] the life before the people
[1:16:02] hallelujah that's what we must do we
[1:16:04] must live the life in front of the
[1:16:06] people because ultimately it's a life
[1:16:09] hallelujah look at here brother said
[1:16:11] you're a trium being inside this little
[1:16:13] fellow here is the soul the next is the
[1:16:16] spirit and the next is the body now you
[1:16:18] got five senses in this body to contact
[1:16:20] your Earthly home they don't contact the
[1:16:22] rest of it you got five senses of the
[1:16:24] spirit here love and conscience and so
[1:16:26] forth of that but in here is where you
[1:16:29] live that's where you are didn't Jesus
[1:16:32] say the rain falls and the just and the
[1:16:34] unjust so see Church let's take a moment
[1:16:36] in your soul there's a nature that's who
[1:16:38] you really are
[1:16:41] Hallelujah that's who you really are is
[1:16:43] your is your human nature is it
[1:16:45] quickened by the Holy Ghost so you can
[1:16:47] say Amen to every word of God and you
[1:16:50] can believe every word of God that's
[1:16:52] what brother BR brings us down to with
[1:16:53] Pentecostals they got tongues shouting
[1:16:56] uh jumping blood out of their hands he
[1:16:58] says a and said he had blood out of his
[1:17:00] hands all this uh unscriptural things he
[1:17:03] said it boils down to you do you have
[1:17:05] the nature of God that's born in your
[1:17:07] soul that will produce Christ in your
[1:17:09] life that's the test do you have the
[1:17:11] life of the seed
[1:17:13] Hallelujah and if you're not born again
[1:17:16] do you have the seed there but it's
[1:17:17] there but it's waiting to be
[1:17:20] quickened do you have a seed that can be
[1:17:22] quickened to the word of God hallelujah
[1:17:27] so the rain falls on the just and the
[1:17:30] unjust brother quotes Matthew 242 24 he
[1:17:33] said there be many false prophets and
[1:17:35] false christs he said they're not
[1:17:37] anointed to the word they're just
[1:17:39] anointed to their
[1:17:41] gifts church you can see it some people
[1:17:43] have tremendous gifts like I told you
[1:17:44] Joe OST he has all these testimonies on
[1:17:46] there on his website last time I checked
[1:17:48] people healed of cancer and uh all these
[1:17:51] things well no doubt I mean it's
[1:17:53] possible if he gets gets in the channel
[1:17:55] and speaks you know life and God's A
[1:17:57] Healer of your body and God has given
[1:17:59] that gift it's going to
[1:18:00] manifest Hallelujah any gift that's in
[1:18:03] your life if you can just get under the
[1:18:05] anointing and get that gift consecrated
[1:18:07] to God it's going to produce Hallelujah
[1:18:10] but brother and makes the
[1:18:10] distinguishment your gifts are anointed
[1:18:13] but is your life anointed is the soul
[1:18:15] anointed and quickened by the word of
[1:18:17] God are you quickened by the word in
[1:18:20] your soul Hallelujah because remember
[1:18:22] your gifts are in your human spirit
[1:18:24] right the gifts are in your human spirit
[1:18:27] because you can have that anointed and
[1:18:28] like balam or Judas still not have this
[1:18:31] Anointed The
[1:18:35] Soul he said they're false anointed ones
[1:18:39] he said it's just like the genuine
[1:18:40] anointing the genuine anointing fell on
[1:18:42] Caiaphas and he said one man must die
[1:18:45] for the nation and it was thus say the
[1:18:47] Lord Jesus died for the whole nation of
[1:18:49] Israel and then balam prophesied a star
[1:18:52] will rise out of Jacob and that's what
[1:18:54] happened Hallelujah
[1:18:56] brother Ram said so don't he says any of
[1:18:58] them Sensations and so forth forget it
[1:19:01] so here brother Ram brings down the
[1:19:02] evidence of the Holy Ghost listen what
[1:19:03] he says he said what's the evidence it's
[1:19:06] your heart in that word and that's
[1:19:11] Christ he's trying to get the people
[1:19:13] don't look the sensations or shouting or
[1:19:15] jumping or Screaming or tongues those
[1:19:18] are all good things but he said it's
[1:19:21] your heart in that word and the word
[1:19:24] word is
[1:19:26] Christ I just love it brother brother
[1:19:29] says it in so many different ways out
[1:19:30] the evidence of the Holy Ghost he says
[1:19:31] it he says sometimes it's the fruit
[1:19:33] sometimes it's believing in the word in
[1:19:35] the word all the way uh and here he says
[1:19:38] it it's your heart in that word and that
[1:19:41] word is Christ bring it in there and
[1:19:45] watch it make itself known just as it
[1:19:48] opens up like any other seed and
[1:19:51] declares itself for the age it's living
[1:19:54] in
[1:19:57] Hallelujah he said Luther could bring
[1:19:59] nothing but
[1:20:01] sprig these others could bring other
[1:20:04] things we're in the wheat age now
[1:20:07] Luther's genuine Luthers had to bring
[1:20:09] forth genuine Luther genuine Pentecost
[1:20:12] had to bring forth genuine Pentecost
[1:20:14] that's all but we're past that age and
[1:20:17] we're going on and then he says because
[1:20:20] the spirit of death is here if the
[1:20:22] Catholic Church started as the
[1:20:23] Pentecostal
[1:20:25] he said look at the Catholic church now
[1:20:27] look at the Catholic church now all the
[1:20:29] prayer beads right all the all all the
[1:20:32] relics and so forth you know people are
[1:20:34] attracted to it because it looks so holy
[1:20:36] but it's not holy looks can be
[1:20:39] deceiving what's the life of that
[1:20:41] Catholic person right watch their words
[1:20:45] watch uh What uh watch what they think
[1:20:47] is holy or Unholy watch their life and
[1:20:49] we got good Catholic friends right we
[1:20:51] got but watch their life look what kind
[1:20:54] of life they're living the life they
[1:20:56] live shows which seed is on the
[1:20:59] inside and church with some of them we
[1:21:01] just got to we just got to trust there's
[1:21:02] a seed in there that's not yet quickened
[1:21:05] and that would be foolish virgin right
[1:21:08] but if we are the true seed of God our
[1:21:10] seed should be quickened and we should
[1:21:12] be putting forth the life that everybody
[1:21:14] can see here's a real Christian
[1:21:17] Life Hallelujah brother makes a
[1:21:20] statement he
[1:21:21] says if the Catholic church was the
[1:21:23] former Pentecostal he said if 2,000
[1:21:26] years pass the Pentecostal would be
[1:21:28] worse than the
[1:21:30] Catholic think about that I was raised
[1:21:32] the Pentecostal church that's why it
[1:21:34] seems shocking to me it would be worse
[1:21:37] if you gave the current Pentecostals all
[1:21:39] their tongues and all their crazy
[1:21:40] charismatic things they do now if you
[1:21:43] gave them 2,000 years it'd be worse than
[1:21:45] the Catholic church is right
[1:21:48] now I'm closing with this he says
[1:21:53] brother BR breaks back into his ministry
[1:21:55] when I went forth into the meetings with
[1:21:56] you praying for the sick it was fine but
[1:21:59] when I come with a message if any
[1:22:02] message Goes Forth and it's a true
[1:22:04] message if it's a true genuine miracles
[1:22:07] of god but if it hangs in that
[1:22:09] organization you know it's not
[1:22:12] God because that thing is already
[1:22:15] declared
[1:22:17] dead Okay so let's look at Jesus Jesus
[1:22:19] had all the Miracles did he stay with
[1:22:21] the Pharisees Sadducees no he came out
[1:22:23] of there any genuine move of God Luther
[1:22:26] did he stay in the Catholic Church no he
[1:22:27] come out of it condemned it so so with
[1:22:31] brother brandom because he brought a
[1:22:32] true Revelation a true word of God he
[1:22:35] couldn't stay a part of those
[1:22:36] organizations he had to come out and
[1:22:39] start a new he says organism hallelujah
[1:22:42] amen and we are a living organism of the
[1:22:46] mystical body of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:22:50] we're organized by the word of God not
[1:22:53] by man's Creed because we have the Life
[1:22:55] of Christ that unites us with all the
[1:22:58] bride around the world Amen
[1:23:03] Hallelujah you know it's not God if it
[1:23:05] hangs right there in the organization
[1:23:07] because it's already been declared dead
[1:23:10] Jesus went forth and healed the sick in
[1:23:11] order to catch their eyes the people and
[1:23:15] then his message came that's right it
[1:23:18] has to have something that God is going
[1:23:19] to introduce Divine Healing his miracles
[1:23:23] like that to just catch the eyes of the
[1:23:25] people the main heart of it is the
[1:23:29] message so let me pause right there you
[1:23:31] know I feel led maybe if if God terries
[1:23:34] in 2025 or whatever happens if we are
[1:23:36] still allowed to have church whatever
[1:23:37] happens hopefully we have many more
[1:23:38] years but we'll see but I like to take
[1:23:40] the young people through the life of
[1:23:42] brother brandham and just show all these
[1:23:44] amazing Miracles when he got saved and
[1:23:46] the polls and his ups and downs I like
[1:23:48] to just put it on uh and and go through
[1:23:50] all these
[1:23:51] stories uh so because I've tried myself
[1:23:55] I've tried to do this I've tried to get
[1:23:57] you the main thing the main thing is the
[1:23:59] bible message the scriptures Hallelujah
[1:24:02] that's what brother said that's the main
[1:24:03] heart of it is the message now all the
[1:24:05] stories that will raise your faith
[1:24:07] Hallelujah right and that's why I tell
[1:24:09] some of those stories uh like the armor
[1:24:12] company I told that a few weeks ago you
[1:24:13] know keep washing those dishes Saints
[1:24:15] right Jesus is coming back for a bride
[1:24:18] amen he promised he's coming back
[1:24:20] Hallelujah just stay at your posted Duty
[1:24:23] Hallelujah be the bride but there's many
[1:24:26] stories out there that that might
[1:24:28] encourage uh the faith of our children
[1:24:30] they've encouraged me over the years and
[1:24:32] I like to put them down I like to go
[1:24:34] through them kind of slowly so you can
[1:24:35] see some of these
[1:24:37] highlights but Church uh you know
[1:24:39] brother R says even in his Divine
[1:24:40] Healing and his miracles the main heart
[1:24:43] of it is the
[1:24:45] message that's what it is he says it
[1:24:48] what comes from in here he's trying to
[1:24:51] get favor of the people so they'll set
[1:24:54] and listen to him see for there's some
[1:24:57] in there that's ordained to life
[1:25:02] Hallelujah some of the grain the wheat
[1:25:04] fell on ground the birds picked it up
[1:25:07] and others fell amongst thorns and some
[1:25:09] was went on prepared ground pre-prepared
[1:25:12] ground and brought
[1:25:14] forth Hallelujah so I want you to see
[1:25:17] that brother Ram's Divine Healing and
[1:25:19] his miracles and his discernments that's
[1:25:21] all powerful that's part of it but
[1:25:23] brother Ram said God gave him all those
[1:25:25] gifts and discernment to catch the eyes
[1:25:27] of the people so that they would see who
[1:25:29] the mother Harlot is and they could come
[1:25:31] out of death and come into life
[1:25:34] Hallelujah and have the real life of
[1:25:37] Jesus Christ that's the message
[1:25:40] Hallelujah let's stand our feet
[1:25:41] musicians can come here by God's grace
[1:25:55] would youa put up uh Mark 4:
[1:26:01] 26 I didn't really realize it till
[1:26:03] yesterday and I have a whole section on
[1:26:05] this in my
[1:26:06] book The Three works of Grace are seen
[1:26:09] through this here this idea of the wheat
[1:26:11] the life in the seed and he said so is
[1:26:14] the kingdom of God as if a man should
[1:26:16] cast seed into the ground verse 27 and
[1:26:19] should sleep and Rise not I'm sorry and
[1:26:22] Rise night and day and the seed should
[1:26:24] spring and grow up he knoweth not
[1:26:27] how that's like each one of us we don't
[1:26:30] understand really how we grow as
[1:26:31] Believers right we repent we yield we do
[1:26:33] our best to obey and worship but somehow
[1:26:35] God causes us to grow Hallelujah I can't
[1:26:38] explain it but Jesse how could you grow
[1:26:41] and how could you leave the chapel and
[1:26:43] leave uh somebody's of God how could you
[1:26:44] leave your mom's church I don't know
[1:26:46] somehow somehow the life of God was in
[1:26:48] me and it just grew in me Hallelujah I
[1:26:50] can't explain it but I know it's
[1:26:52] happened Hallelujah I'm just Dr drawn to
[1:26:54] it because the spiritual seed of God has
[1:26:57] to produce
[1:26:58] itself this is the kingdom of God for
[1:27:02] the Earth bringeth forth fruit of
[1:27:03] herself first the blade then the ear
[1:27:08] after that the full corn in the ear so
[1:27:11] you have Luther Wesley and then brother
[1:27:13] Brandon of course there's not a four
[1:27:15] step some some of them have four some of
[1:27:16] them have
[1:27:17] three verse 29 but when the fruit is
[1:27:20] brought forth immediately he putteth in
[1:27:22] the sickle because because the Harvest
[1:27:25] has come so see he only harvest the
[1:27:28] grain he only harvest the seven Church
[1:27:30] age aren't we glad that we know that by
[1:27:32] the grace of God let's bow our heads for
[1:27:34] a word of prayer
[1:27:37] here father God we're thankful for the
[1:27:39] ministry of the seventh angel Lord God
[1:27:42] I've surely been joying Lord these
[1:27:44] reviews and Lord some new things fresh
[1:27:46] things Lord God from this message Lord
[1:27:51] God we thank you for the inspiration of
[1:27:54] the Holy Spirit Lord
[1:27:55] God God we're thankful there's a seed of
[1:27:58] God in us as the parable says Lord
[1:28:01] God and God alls we want Lord is to keep
[1:28:04] laying in the presence of the sun Lord
[1:28:06] and letting the Waters of the Holy
[1:28:07] Spirit refresh our lives dear
[1:28:10] God that we could grow up into Christ in
[1:28:13] all things as the scripture tells us
[1:28:15] Lord
[1:28:18] God lord May each person today Lord take
[1:28:22] it uh an examination at their lamps is
[1:28:25] their lamp trimmed is their life in
[1:28:27] order oh God help us to get it in order
[1:28:30] Lord
[1:28:32] God has their heart been turned back by
[1:28:34] Malachi 4 5 and
[1:28:37] 6 do their hearts look like the
[1:28:41] apostolic fathers we see there in the
[1:28:42] book of Acts God let me look at my heart
[1:28:45] as well Lord God
[1:28:47] hallelujah you're doing this Lord as
[1:28:49] you're descending you're getting a
[1:28:50] people ready with the bread of life
[1:28:55] the bridegroom has come go you out to
[1:28:57] meet
