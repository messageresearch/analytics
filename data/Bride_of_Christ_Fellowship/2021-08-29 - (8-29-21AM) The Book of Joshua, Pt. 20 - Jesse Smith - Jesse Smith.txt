finish joshua 14 and move into joshua 15 this morning it's good to be with the saints praise god good to see the saints and the lord richly bless each one of you we're living just in a tremendous time are we not where things are just so crazy politically and around the world and i was reminded this week how paul said they'll be all saying peace and safety peace and safety but then sudden destruction so it seems like we're really building into that right as far as our lives i don't know about brother william but as far as in my young life uh this is the most chaotic it's ever been as far as i know i don't know about our brother you know they live under different countries live under different circumstances same praise god but around the world they're saying peace and safety peace and safety but at that moment jesus comes that we are not appointed unto wrath but we're appointed to obtain salvation through jesus christ because we are not children of the darkness we are children of the light amen amen praise god joshua chapter 14 we're so thankful let's do verse 11. we'll just look a little more at caleb here and then we'll go to chapter 15 by god's grace thanks for the testimony brother bang that's beautiful praise the lord hallelujah thank you brother i love when we get testimonies in praise god i'd like to hear when god is answering prayers i try to share mine all during the sermons i got an easy platform i can do that anytime i want but i love hearing from each one of you and thank god for the testimonies today joshua 14 verse 11. this is part 20. i like to just call it possessing the enemy's gay 11 out of 15k let's finish the chicken there that was pretty good we got that gotta go after that here that's down through one two three let's then even so is my shirt now for war ball to go out and come in now therefore give me this mountain of the lord's sake in that day the lord will be with me then i shall be able to the inheritance caleb justin to this day because then hold on thank you god yeah we look forward to seeing your faith lord we know to do that lord fight that little spirit as we read the scripture lord lord caleb said us to god we know we'll drive out all the enemies in our lives by your grace by your mercy let us strengthen this day has never been spiritual lord god and lord [Music] everybody's uh of the endings praise god it was interesting last night i went to that baptist church and the preachers i was gonna use praise the lord head to the last week's summer over the spring the title was about uh fighting you know being strong and fighting and being ready to fight forgotten i thought that was fitting nowhere and we're not sure what i'm talking about i just want you to notice and start back with caleb last we looked at his ideas too [Music] so we gotta was them [Music] was in the ways of god and they will keep my commandments they will honor the word they're being let me know you're being trained by praise god and you're overcoming see the word is always here to tell you we just have to receive it repent and unbelief and use the word of god use the sword that god give us she use the helmet use the disposal and you'll be more than [Music] the rapture is for me i believe thus saith the lord i've given my whole life to this message amen it's what my whole desire is is to see jesus and if we keep confessing god rewards us amen but he said any of these evil men that spoke evil against the promised land the baptism of the holy ghost they will not inherit the promises save caleb oh that one in a million that's what i was telling i think i was telling cam and randy that i can say to each one of you you are one in a million brother bang but stephen you're one in a million all you saints here you are one in a million because we've seen hundreds now we've seen hundreds we've seen hundreds right that can't receive all the truth or maybe don't know about it so we're trying to share it with them you can see millions on tv can see millions we know the population's billions almost 8 billion now you are one in a million for sure save caleb he'll see it and to him when i give the land that he's already tried upon to his children because he hath wholly followed the lord this is this is caleb's nickname the man who holy followed the lord talk about a nickname so 427 years later caleb stands in hebron and he says this day this scripture from abraham is fulfilled amen hallelujah because god told abraham i will bless you verse 17. in genesis 27 the angel the lord swore to him your seed will be as the stars of heaven as the sand upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy's church we're only you know 50 some years 57 years from brother branham let's take courage amen he had to wait 400 years to inherit some of these promises some of these promises may just be 10 years away maybe 20 years away maybe 30 years away maybe 40 years away we don't know but let's have faith let's know that every word of god spoken with us saith the lord it's got to come to pass it will not return void and let's believe it until it does come to pass 427 years later i'm fulfilling what abraham prophesied about me oh church with lord willing we're going to say i'm fulfilling what paul prophesied about me amen 2 000 years ago right with rapture we're talking rapture i'm going to fulfill what brother branham prophesied of 50 or 60 years ago see but we've got to stay true to the word and we've got to holy follow the lord in all that we do remember hebron was going to be important in the future god had to conquer right then because uh let me let me see second samuel two i'll give you the exact number of years if it means anything to you second samuel two because so many years later oh wow so oh wow almost 400 years later because this was a 1042 bc over 400 more years later david becomes king and the first city he's king over is hebron like the bible said that time david was king in hebron over the house of judah was seven years and six months oh so look at what's going to come out of caleb see lion the g amen oh my what a what a family lineage amen this family is filled with overcomers amen how many want your family to be filled with overcomers hallelujah my grandpa overcame death right when my grandma died my mom overcame cancer when she had cancer hallelujah god's healed me god's helped me god's done great things for me god's doing great things for you church we're leaving a godly legacy for these young ones to see amen if it doesn't come in our days we said perhaps it'll come in their day but our desire is to live so dedicated to god that god can use us and the next generation can know exactly what they must do with the word the word is not meant to be denominated the word is meant to be taken out and lived amen how did it we've seen what denominations do with it praise god it does but with the believer it lives but it has to live every day of our lives amen glory so this this uh caleb's victory was a foreshadow of the future king that's coming right caleb was in other words god was saying there caleb's a mighty man but there's coming a greater one about 400 years down the road and then after david he said he could have said there's coming a greater one not solomon a thousand years the seed of david the messiah amen
