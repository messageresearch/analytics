[22:21] tonight by God's grace you like to go to
[22:24] Revelation chapter 13 I'd like to
[22:26] continue on Revelation chapter 13
[22:28] tonight by God's grace I'm sorry my
[22:36] throat
[22:37] in pain this week I think I preached too
[22:39] hard over the weekend Wednesday
[22:42] friday-sunday
[22:44] so I'm trying not to stress it too hard
[22:46] if I can help it but let's go to the
[22:49] Word of God here and know God will
[22:53] certainly help us tonight by God's grace
[22:55] Revelation chapter 13 now we basically
[22:58] preached last time on verses 1 and 2 and
[23:02] I believe last time we preached was
[23:03] brother Aaron's dad was here by God's
[23:05] grace so it's nice to have him here
[23:06] tonight let's give him a round for
[23:08] blessing said amen praise God
[23:14] jesus said wherever two or three gather
[23:16] he's right there so we're so thankful I
[23:18] have Jesus Christ with us here tonight
[23:19] and so thankful makes it a tremendous
[23:22] blessing to gather every time in the
[23:24] name of the Lord Jesus so we made it
[23:30] just through verses 1 & 2 so I like to
[23:32] pick up here and verse 3 and the
[23:39] revelation 13:3 we're working our way
[23:44] through the book of Revelation I believe
[23:45] this is part 92 if I'm not mistaken so
[23:48] let's look at verse 3 verse 3 says and I
[23:55] saw one of his heads as it were wounded
[23:56] to death and his deadly wound was healed
[23:59] and all the world wondered after the
[24:03] Beast and they worshipped the Dragon
[24:07] which gave power unto the Beast and they
[24:09] worshipped the Beast saying who is like
[24:11] unto the Beast who's able to make war
[24:14] with the Vatican I read that right no
[24:21] but that's what it's talking about who's
[24:24] ever made war with the Vatican no one
[24:28] verse if
[24:30] reverse five and there was given unto
[24:32] him a mouth speaking great things and
[24:33] blasphemies now look at verse five it
[24:36] skips ahead to the Tribulation Period
[24:39] because it speaks of three and a half
[24:41] years see God hides his wisdom from the
[24:45] wise and the prudent is that right and
[24:47] reveals it unto babes and there was
[24:51] given on in verse five a mouth speaking
[24:53] great things and blasphemies and power
[24:55] was given unto him to continue forty and
[24:57] two months and he opened his mouth and
[24:59] blasphemy against God to blaspheme his
[25:02] name and his tabernacle and then the
[25:05] dwell in heaven and it was given on him
[25:08] to make war with the Saints and to
[25:10] overcome them and power was given him
[25:12] over all Kindred's and tongues and
[25:15] nations and all that dwell upon the
[25:18] earth shall worship Him whose names are
[25:19] not written in the book of the life of
[25:21] the lamb slain from the foundation of
[25:23] the world If any man have an ear let him
[25:26] hear let's read verse 10 together ready
[25:29] one two three he that leadeth into
[25:32] captivity shall go into captivity he
[25:36] that killeth with the sword must be
[25:37] killed with the sword
[25:39] here is the patience and the faith of
[25:41] the saints it's had one more word of
[25:43] Prayer
[25:43] if you ever need on your heart just
[25:44] making known unto God here as we bow our
[25:47] heads here Heavenly Father we love you
[25:49] we thank you for your mercy we thank you
[25:50] for your amazing grace father so good to
[25:52] sing these songs Lord there's no guilt
[25:54] in life there's no fear and death
[25:56] because the power of Christ has come
[25:58] upon us Lord we repented we were
[26:00] baptized were justified were sanctified
[26:02] and Lord filled with the Holy Ghost for
[26:05] those who are Lord if we are that if we
[26:07] truly are born again then we have the
[26:09] power of Christ in us Lord God and Lord
[26:12] there's now no condemnation to them that
[26:15] are in Christ Jesus who walk in the
[26:17] spirit and not in the flesh father take
[26:20] this word here tonight break it to your
[26:21] saints Lord God give me Grace and
[26:23] strength Lord each person give them a
[26:25] special portion of your anointing here
[26:27] today and we'll give you all the glory
[26:29] in Jesus Christ's name and the church
[26:31] said amen god bless you to be in seated
[26:33] praise the Lord
[26:45] so let's look at revelation 13 here
[26:48] we'll go back just briefly and look at
[26:51] verse 1 & 2 now remember in verse 1 and
[26:54] 2 the Bible said and I stood up upon the
[26:56] sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up
[26:58] out of the sea having seven heads ten
[27:00] horns and upon his horns ten crowns and
[27:03] upon his heads the name of blasphemy so
[27:07] we know this is a beast rising up out of
[27:10] the sea sea represents people's
[27:12] multitudes tongues and nations so this
[27:15] is the fourth Kingdom the fourth Gentile
[27:18] Kingdom that would rise and verse 2
[27:21] tells us it's the Roman Kingdom but it
[27:25] has all the combined powers of Babylon
[27:27] Medes and Persians and the ancient
[27:30] Greeks Alexander the Great all those
[27:33] same demon powers are now in the Roman
[27:35] Catholic Church because the Bible said
[27:37] the Beast I saw I'm sorry in the Beast
[27:39] which I saw was like on the leopard and
[27:41] his feet were as the feet of a bear and
[27:43] his mouth as a mouth of a lion and the
[27:46] dragon gave him his power and his sea
[27:48] and his great Authority
[27:49] so it's Satan himself who now fills this
[27:54] Roman power this spirit of Rome and
[27:57] that's where we stopped we ended last
[27:59] time we looked at this looking at the
[28:02] the feet the feet there of this the
[28:06] statue and if you just can bear with me
[28:09] for a minute I'd like to go back there
[28:10] and just reference that I was studying
[28:13] on that again this week so let's go I
[28:17] want to go back there I'm going to keep
[28:18] my spot there in Revelation 13 and let's
[28:20] head I'm gonna head back to Daniel 243
[28:24] that's just briefly I strike that and
[28:32] that was a great revelation to me Church
[28:34] it and what I mean was revelations are
[28:38] unveiling and so it unveiled the power
[28:41] and the importance of living a godly
[28:43] life at home because you and I know just
[28:46] as well as anything anybody can come to
[28:48] church and just act a little reverent
[28:50] during church time right around message
[28:53] churches anybody can come to church and
[28:54] just as long
[28:55] they don't you know interrupt the
[28:57] service speaking in tongues and as long
[28:58] as I just sit there and be quiet
[28:59] everybody thinks they're a good person
[29:00] and the church said right is that you've
[29:05] know we've all known people like that
[29:06] that can sit in a church and and you
[29:08] watch them in church they look fine
[29:10] doesn't look like anything's wrong with
[29:12] their life but you get to know them a
[29:13] little closer you find out some things
[29:15] are wrong with their life and if that's
[29:18] wrong with their life then something's
[29:20] wrong in the home so it was revealed to
[29:22] me through the Holy Spirit that the home
[29:24] is the most important part of our
[29:26] Christian walk how you live at home
[29:29] tells how you live everywhere else so if
[29:34] you're in your home if you're
[29:36] undisciplined if you're you're
[29:38] compromising in your home then you will
[29:41] compromise on your job in the family in
[29:44] the school in the church as well but
[29:47] your home is the most important place
[29:49] because that is Satan's greatest desire
[29:52] is to conquer you in your personal life
[29:55] right amen
[29:57] Daniel 243 but remember we looked at
[30:04] this and we saw your home life really
[30:06] proves what you are no matter how much
[30:09] people shout and scream in a church
[30:11] service no matter how many revival
[30:14] services people go to or you and I go to
[30:16] no matter how many special meetings we
[30:19] have no matter how much we can get
[30:21] emotional matter how much we can say wow
[30:24] what a wonderful service that was if we
[30:26] don't have that same power of God in our
[30:28] home that it's meaningless and alls it
[30:32] was was a emotional experience but you
[30:35] know you've had more than an emotional
[30:37] experience which when the Holy Ghost
[30:39] comes upon you brother BAM said you're
[30:40] gonna have emotion but when the Holy
[30:42] Ghost comes upon you and you can defy
[30:45] Satan in your home and live a sanctified
[30:48] Holy Spirit filled life in your home now
[30:52] you've got power praise God
[30:55] because you and I I get emotional I
[30:57] cried on Sunday I cry Friday night you
[30:59] know I cry every time the presence of
[31:01] God is here I usually weep and cry or
[31:03] shout or something but if I don't have
[31:05] that same devotion in my home that I
[31:07] missed it
[31:08] then I've only
[31:09] god anoint me in my spirit realm and not
[31:12] my soul realm you and I both know David
[31:16] had a good anointing on his flesh his
[31:17] cup ran over the Holy Ghost came upon it
[31:20] he slew Goliath he prophesied right
[31:24] he wrote the Bible he prophesied my bone
[31:27] stare at me my God my God why I forsake
[31:29] of me but when it came down that lust
[31:31] devil he became a murderer and he became
[31:34] an adulterer and God said the sword will
[31:37] never depart from your house why because
[31:39] the Holy Ghost was not yet given in the
[31:41] soul so you and I she'll be able to slay
[31:43] not so much natural Giants but Devils
[31:46] right lust Giants right fear Giants
[31:50] Pride Giants that's the devil's you and
[31:53] I got a destroy by God's grace when you
[31:56] really got that power now you know you
[31:58] got something special and you know
[32:01] you've been the Prince of somebody
[32:02] greater right than a preacher greater
[32:06] than just a church member when you've
[32:08] got power to the five Satan and slay
[32:10] those spiritual Giants it proves you've
[32:12] been the presence of God Almighty when
[32:14] you can live it in your home and every
[32:16] demon that comes against your home you
[32:18] can cast down overcome live a real
[32:21] Christian life now you've got the real
[32:23] power of the Holy Spirit amen hallelujah
[32:28] now Daniel 2 now verse 40 speaks of iron
[32:33] so Rome is an iron power and it breaks
[32:38] and subdues all things the Bible says it
[32:40] crushes it breaks see Satan wants to
[32:43] break your communion with God he wants
[32:46] to crush your fellowship with God now
[32:49] verse 41 where as I saw as the feet in
[32:52] the toes part of potters clay which is
[32:54] Protestantism and part iron brother man
[32:57] tells in the church age book the kingdom
[32:59] shall be divided but there shall be in
[33:02] it the strength of the iron and for as
[33:04] much as thou sawest the iron mixed with
[33:06] miry clay so in the feet the catholicism
[33:11] and protestantism was mixed together and
[33:13] as the toes of the feet were part of
[33:15] iron and part of clay so the kingdom
[33:17] shall be partly strong and partly broken
[33:21] and whereas our sauce iron mixed with
[33:23] miry clay they shall he says mingle
[33:28] themselves with the seed of men but they
[33:30] shall not cleave one to another even as
[33:32] iron is not mixed with clay now I was
[33:35] doing some study and I was reading on
[33:36] the Vatican's website this week and I'll
[33:40] be honest I don't spend a whole lot of
[33:41] time there because there's no life there
[33:43] but I reason I'm there is to spy out
[33:46] what they really believe right as like a
[33:50] spies went into God used spies and so
[33:54] when I went in there I found clearly on
[33:58] their website and let me just find the
[34:00] exact words they actually make yeah they
[34:08] actually make every Catholic vow they
[34:10] say Catholics can never marry non
[34:12] Catholics unless one condition the one
[34:16] condition is that a Catholic who marries
[34:18] a non Catholic this is called the
[34:20] Catholic code of canon law this is right
[34:22] on their website they can only marry
[34:25] someone who's not a Catholic if they
[34:28] promised to remove dangers of defecting
[34:30] from their faith while promising to do
[34:34] all in your power so that your offspring
[34:37] are baptized and brought up in the
[34:40] Catholic Church so see this is the
[34:43] fulfillment of Daniel 243 how many can
[34:45] say amen to that
[34:47] that's their fulfillment there their
[34:50] power has to mingle their seeds with the
[34:54] seeds of the world so Catholics are led
[34:57] by the enemy to marry outside just
[35:00] marrying anybody if they want and as
[35:03] long as they promise we're gonna be true
[35:06] to the Roman Spirit and we're gonna I'll
[35:09] marry you as long as you can promise I
[35:11] can raise my children Catholic in other
[35:14] words bring them under the bondage of
[35:16] that Roman spirit amen
[35:19] and that's how this has been fulfilled
[35:22] praise God and so see how do they mingle
[35:26] their seed they marry and then they
[35:28] raise the next generation the by jesus
[35:31] said their twofold children of hell than
[35:33] the first generation is that right
[35:36] so how does Satan conquer he conquers by
[35:39] destroying people's home life the family
[35:42] altars taken away there's no more
[35:45] sincerity people just go through the
[35:47] motions they read the Bible but it
[35:49] doesn't have any impact on them right
[35:51] and church that's what we got to be
[35:54] careful of in the message that we just
[35:56] don't read more other brands books or
[35:57] read the Bible and it doesn't bring
[35:59] reality it's got to bring a reality that
[36:02] means if someone sins in your family you
[36:04] got to go talk to them about it
[36:05] praise God if somebody hurts your
[36:08] feelings and sins against you yeah you
[36:10] got to forgive him but you need to go
[36:11] tell him about it
[36:12] if not a sinful cancer grows in the home
[36:18] praise God and that was revealed to me
[36:21] what did Satan do what did Satan do at
[36:24] the beginning he attacked the home the
[36:25] husband and wife see what a saint like
[36:28] to do he likes to go in there and divide
[36:31] husband against wife is that right
[36:33] Church that's a Satan's tactic and you
[36:36] can trace it all down through the Bible
[36:38] what was he trying to do he's trying to
[36:40] get them to compromise in their homes
[36:41] because if he knew a key key key he can
[36:44] conquer them then then the next
[36:45] generation will be further and further
[36:47] away from God remember judges - let's go
[36:51] to judges - I believe it's judges - ten
[36:54] Joshua judges Ruth and Samuel the
[36:59] Scriptures come into my heart here hope
[37:04] it's judges - 10 if not I'm gonna have
[37:06] to look in the concordance here no it's
[37:10] four to ten glory judges - ten Thank You
[37:13] Lord judges - ten and also all that
[37:19] generation were gathered on their
[37:20] fathers and there arose another
[37:22] generation after them which knew not the
[37:24] Lord nor yet the works which he had done
[37:26] for Israel what a sad condition this is
[37:30] why you had judges that were women right
[37:34] this is why you had Samson a man that
[37:37] will had power he gave his body to God
[37:40] but not his heart to God and we've got
[37:43] to be careful that to give God our
[37:45] strength our body but also give him our
[37:47] heart
[37:49] and see your how you live at your home
[37:51] proves who has your heart
[37:54] praise God but see when Satan or when
[37:59] Satan takes your heart when you don't
[38:01] set your when we don't make our home
[38:03] life we don't give God the time we need
[38:06] he needs at home to be number one
[38:08] then Satan robs us of our home and a den
[38:11] Ende generation rise up but doesn't know
[38:13] Christ like we are like they ought to
[38:14] and that's how Satan conquers but how
[38:19] does God conquer God conquers by
[38:21] Christians parents that really love God
[38:23] that really serve the Lord they obey God
[38:26] in the home and the home is just an
[38:28] extension of the church praise God amen
[38:31] so however the parents live at church
[38:33] they live the same way at home praise
[38:36] God that's exactly right
[38:38] thank the Lord see we won a generation
[38:43] we want our children here to know the
[38:45] power of God to know what God's done
[38:47] Amen hallelujah they've got to know that
[38:51] if they don't know that then we failed
[38:53] as parents now God can have Grace on us
[38:56] you know mercy and forgive us course
[38:58] right God does that many times but our
[39:01] responsibility is to live so close to
[39:03] God that these children know that
[39:05] there's a Living God
[39:06] and he's the same yesterday today and
[39:07] forever that's right now
[39:13] liddie you can switch over I do have
[39:15] some quotes I just want to lay that
[39:16] foundation there I want to just
[39:27] back to that that was so striking how
[39:29] did a confess income in his home right
[39:34] and sixteen innocent people soldiers for
[39:38] the for the message right the Israel
[39:40] message sixteen innocent men died
[39:42] because Satan defeated him in his house
[39:44] he was hiding sin in his house and
[39:47] Church that's where you and I are
[39:49] probably gonna hide it like most people
[39:51] aren't gonna you know most women won't
[39:53] come here like if they're struggling and
[39:54] you know cut their hair off and come to
[39:56] church yeah right most men won't come in
[39:59] here with tattoos all over them oh I
[40:01] know really I know brother Jesse's
[40:02] really struggling he got a brand new
[40:04] tattoo on his neck like you know it's
[40:07] not gonna be like that it's gonna be
[40:09] some somebody that who loves God which
[40:12] was part love you know with but then
[40:16] they let a sin hide in their life and
[40:19] they caught they keep coming to church
[40:21] but something's hiding in there in their
[40:23] life at home and they haven't made it
[40:25] right how did Ananias and Sapphira both
[40:29] die before Peter they agreed to lie in
[40:32] their home right it's always the home
[40:37] life god help our homes to not be filled
[40:39] with Babylonian garments with stolen
[40:42] gold but let our home as proverbs said
[40:45] be filled with treasures amen treasures
[40:48] like oil treasures like wine Laurie
[40:51] that's what we're talkin about
[40:53] see it goes back to that Satan knows how
[40:56] to conquer he mingles his his seed with
[41:00] the seed of men he conquers in the home
[41:02] with the most important place you can
[41:04] serve God is in your home then if you're
[41:07] if you're fired up for God in your home
[41:09] then you're gonna be fired up a church
[41:11] right no preachers got to pump you up we
[41:14] don't have a special man just just to
[41:16] get you pumped up we don't they have
[41:18] brother Amen or somebody sing a special
[41:19] just to get you pumped up you're already
[41:21] pumped up with the power of God in your
[41:23] house because you've been casting out
[41:25] Satan all all week at your house
[41:27] victorious in your house and when you
[41:29] come to church you bring that victory
[41:31] with you to church amen
[41:32] see that's that's God's pattern praise
[41:35] God it's not to be a Aiken and hide
[41:38] things and then try to come to church
[41:40] and
[41:41] the church the prayers don't work at
[41:42] church oh I hope hope nobody ever here
[41:46] would bring an unrepentant heart to
[41:49] church and then when we pray for the
[41:50] sick they're not made well I hope that
[41:52] doesn't happen to our church that's
[41:54] that's not be a defeated Church let's be
[41:58] a victorious Church praise God
[42:05] now verse 1 & 2 was Imperial pagan Rome
[42:09] now verse 3 to 10 is the Beast out of
[42:12] the sea we began looking at this briefly
[42:16] now verse 3 to 10 was what we read for
[42:19] our text I'm gonna head back there to
[42:21] revelation 13 now in here you have the
[42:28] current papal Rome the hold I'm sorry
[42:31] the unholy Roman Empire the unholy Roman
[42:37] Empire now I like to read this here
[42:43] again now brother Branham said this took
[42:45] place during the third church age except
[42:48] verse 5 speaks of the of the Great
[42:54] Tribulation Period cuz it speaks of 42
[42:56] months and did you notice Church that he
[42:59] even got he even made war with the
[43:01] Saints and overcame them right for 42
[43:06] months so that's not speaking of Holy
[43:08] Ghost Saints that's either speaking of
[43:10] foolish virgin or the Jews right either
[43:14] the foolish virgin or the 144,000 so see
[43:20] you gotta really be careful because God
[43:22] just lays it in there and we need the
[43:23] Holy Spirit to come rightly divide it
[43:25] for us praise God
[43:29] now you all see this picture I think I
[43:32] showed it last time see we're down here
[43:35] now okay but what happened here is that
[43:38] the Roman Empire turned into the
[43:40] Catholicism okay so that's what's
[43:43] happening here
[43:44] in the scripture verse 3 to 10 is
[43:46] Imperial pagan Rome wounded to death
[43:50] okay
[43:51] wounded to death
[43:53] it was healed in papal Rome now notice
[43:59] again as we said last time the beast has
[44:00] the same number of heads this beasts in
[44:02] Revelation 13 has the same number of
[44:05] heads and horns as the Scarlet beast
[44:07] that the woman rides in revelation 17 so
[44:11] see the Roman Catholic Church rides the
[44:14] demonic power of ancient Rome okay she
[44:18] rides the Beast the woman sits upon the
[44:21] Beast now listen you're either gonna be
[44:23] you're either gonna have one of two
[44:24] mothers either your mother is gonna be
[44:26] the mother harlot or your mother is
[44:28] gonna be the New Jerusalem oh yeah thank
[44:32] God you want to see that in Scripture
[44:33] Galatians 4 let's go there I just seen
[44:36] that this morning fresh so this book of
[44:41] revelations about two women which woman
[44:44] is going to be your mother that's what
[44:45] it comes down to we're happy to say
[44:48] tonight our mother is the New Jerusalem
[44:51] hallelujah
[44:52] Galatians 4 I believe it was 26 yeah
[44:55] that's right
[44:56] so in this they're talking about two
[44:58] covenants either the new covenant the
[45:01] covenant of grace or the Covenant of the
[45:03] law it's a verse 24 or if you go to
[45:07] verse 26 but Jerusalem which is above is
[45:09] free which is the mother of us ah now if
[45:13] you look that word up mother it means
[45:15] motherland so the New Jerusalem is the
[45:19] mother land of us all amen brother Aaron
[45:25] where did you wear it where's your real
[45:27] where's your real land of origin is it
[45:30] Marian or is it married or is it heaven
[45:35] heaven sister Connie is it Florida or is
[45:39] it heaven or Maryland is it Maryland or
[45:44] heaven that's right see the Bible saying
[45:49] that the New Jerusalem is your
[45:50] motherland
[45:51] it's your native land jesus said I go to
[45:54] prepare a place for you that where I am
[45:57] there you may be also so the New
[46:00] Jerusalem represents your home and
[46:03] you're to be made by somebody and
[46:07] person was Jesus Christ because the
[46:09] Bible said you were chosen in him before
[46:12] the foundation of the world amen
[46:15] to see that's why this this whole book
[46:19] is about two women right - two women the
[46:22] the mother harlot the Roman
[46:25] Catholic Church or this New Jerusalem
[46:28] the mother of us all and she's the home
[46:31] for the bride of Jesus Christ amen
[46:34] praise God
[46:36] thank the Lord so she is the mother of
[46:41] us all Galatians 4 26 the New Jerusalem
[46:44] so you got a mother yes my mother is a
[46:47] New Jerusalem
[46:47] of course the crater of that is God
[46:50] Almighty amen that's my mother land
[46:53] hallelujah is heaven going back there
[46:56] thank the Lord so it's the same beast so
[46:59] the woman rides the same spirit of Rome
[47:04] all right now in verse well before I get
[47:11] to that I just want to say a few more
[47:13] things here let me pick that up let me
[47:15] go back to Revelation 13 yeah the the
[47:21] wound that was healed
[47:24] let me pull up this quote real quick
[47:26] here bless you all right here it is now
[47:35] history literally says this history
[47:40] literally says that I think I mentioned
[47:43] this on Sunday or Friday history
[47:48] literally says that when Constantine was
[47:50] Emperor around was around 300 AD he
[47:55] changed the capital of Rome he changed
[47:59] it from Rome to Constantinople and when
[48:02] he did that their kingdom the Roman
[48:04] kingdom was starting to fall and history
[48:06] says that was when the power shifted
[48:11] from peg pagan Rome to papal Rome he
[48:15] switched it because remember what did he
[48:17] do he had a false conversion and then he
[48:21] United paganism with Christianity right
[48:26] remember the 3rd church age means
[48:27] married how many remember that Pergamos
[48:30] means married constantine married church
[48:33] and state and so around 500 AD the Roman
[48:37] Empire felt was invaded you know they
[48:39] weren't paying their soldiers they were
[48:42] so bankrupt that they weren't paying
[48:44] their show soldiers they you know they
[48:46] come to collect their checks where's my
[48:48] payment Oh government's out of money now
[48:50] they couldn't print money like we can
[48:53] like we can do again just print it all
[48:55] out and you know put ourselves 20
[48:58] million dollar 20 trillion dollars in
[48:59] debt now right there's about 20 trillion
[49:01] but it's almost like the same thing the
[49:04] money's gonna run out one of these days
[49:06] right we know that it's gonna be so far
[49:08] in debt so they couldn't pay their
[49:11] soldiers so their soldiers stopped doing
[49:12] their jobs and they did other jobs to
[49:14] make money and history says they got so
[49:17] weak they expected so far and try to
[49:20] control so much that they lost control
[49:22] of it they they didn't have enough money
[49:25] for it and then they had so much
[49:26] bickering in the government that they
[49:28] couldn't get anything established there
[49:30] and so because of that they got weak and
[49:32] they spread themselves too thin they
[49:34] were a superpower that got to super and
[49:37] could even couldn't even handle all that
[49:40] all their requirements and so because of
[49:42] that around 500 all this armies came in
[49:46] and destroyed it and the kingdom
[49:48] phal well see it look like the pagan
[49:51] rome fell but the bible said in verse 2
[49:54] that the deadly wound was healed and all
[49:57] the world wondered after the Beast
[50:00] so that spirit of Rome is somewhere
[50:02] today we know where it is amen right the
[50:06] mind that has wisdom knows who that
[50:08] woman is that's right she sits on seven
[50:11] hills hallelujah so the world wonders
[50:15] after the Beast and the power that was
[50:17] in ancient Rome pagan Rome now goes in
[50:20] papal Rome that's right so anybody can
[50:24] see that now let's look at the scripture
[50:28] here now I don't know if you knew this
[50:30] but let's look at verse where was it I'd
[50:34] like to see it
[50:35] Oh verse 6 brother Branham teaches this
[50:37] in the I think it's the fourth seal I
[50:39] don't have the quote right in front of
[50:41] me but in Revelation 13 I'm sorry
[50:43] revelation 13:6 and he opened his mouth
[50:45] and blasphemy against God to blaspheme
[50:47] his name and his tabernacle and then
[50:52] that dwell in heaven so brother Branham
[50:53] calls this triple blasphemy I think I've
[50:56] covered this a couple times but I want
[50:57] to do it again so the Roman spirit blast
[51:02] seems the name of God and how does it do
[51:05] that it changes the name of the Lord
[51:07] Jesus Christ and it swaps it for the
[51:09] Holy Trinity right how many been to a
[51:12] Catholic wedding what do they bless the
[51:14] Catholic wedding in in the name of the
[51:15] Father Son and Holy Ghost whatever this
[51:17] this I'm not even sure what they're
[51:18] doing they're like a cross they are not
[51:22] blessed them they're not blessing the
[51:24] marriage in the name of Jesus Christ
[51:26] they're blessing in another name and
[51:27] that's blasphemy because it's changing
[51:30] God's name the Bible said in Colossians
[51:32] 3:17 whatever you do in word or deed
[51:34] belong the name of Jesus Christ every
[51:38] marriage should be done the name of
[51:39] Jesus Christ every baptism should be
[51:41] done the name of Jesus Christ every
[51:43] prayer in your home every prayer we have
[51:45] for healing this sick should be
[51:47] done in the name of Jesus Christ and
[51:49] they take that holy water right and they
[51:52] say oh now you're annoying you with the
[51:54] holy water of the Father Son Holy Ghost
[51:56] that's blasphemy right that's speaking
[52:00] evil of a good thing
[52:02] right speaking evil about the name of
[52:05] Jesus Christ saying that's not
[52:06] sufficient we need to replace it with a
[52:08] three God right a three person name so
[52:12] the Bible's right see the Bible's right
[52:14] they blaspheme the name of God look at
[52:17] the second one when they blaspheme next
[52:18] they blaspheme his name second they
[52:20] blasting the tabernacle you can look it
[52:23] up look it up in any encyclopedia Rome
[52:25] is called the Eternal City it's called
[52:28] that way because the Vatican is decked
[52:30] with priceless artwork gold and precious
[52:33] valuables that you cannot calculate it's
[52:37] incalculable how much value there is in
[52:40] their eye other macula Michelangelo
[52:42] artwork and all the jewels and
[52:44] everything all the gold it's invaluable
[52:46] and because she exalts herself and calls
[52:50] herself the Eternal City
[52:52] she's blaspheming our mother the Eternal
[52:55] City right the Eternal City which is the
[52:59] New Jerusalem see
[53:01] so she blasphemes heaven the Bible said
[53:06] no that's right yeah verse six she
[53:09] blasts seems his tabernacle that's the
[53:11] tabernacle of God right the New
[53:12] Jerusalem by calling herself the Eternal
[53:16] City eternal Rome is not eternal because
[53:19] the Bible said her plagues come in one
[53:21] day can you imagine one day just like
[53:23] last week sister County sent me that
[53:25] link of that that church that Merton
[53:27] down in a matter of hours right it stood
[53:30] for 18 hour for 800 years at stood but
[53:33] all's it took was a few hours of fire
[53:35] and it burnt down what a pre figure to
[53:38] the tribulation amen
[53:40] when that not just one church but the
[53:43] entire Vatican is going to be destroyed
[53:45] in one hour the Bible says what a pre
[53:48] figure that's what as soon as I saw that
[53:50] from Connie I thought oh what a what a
[53:51] foreshadowing of what's to come no
[53:54] matter how long it looks like Rome's
[53:55] gonna stand or these churches false
[53:57] churches are gonna stand with the mother
[53:59] harlots because they repented not of
[54:01] their sins they're gonna be burned with
[54:03] fire may God help us to repent of all of
[54:06] our sins that the fire of the Holy Ghost
[54:09] will burn out any sin in our lives
[54:10] that's what we need now we don't need
[54:13] the natural fire we need the consuming
[54:16] fire of the Holy Ghost to burn out any
[54:18] desire for sin in our lives right now so
[54:21] that our lives will stand on that day
[54:23] will go raptured up to heaven while
[54:25] God's fire comes down to destroy she'll
[54:29] be judged in one hour her plagues come
[54:31] in one day because strong is the Lord
[54:34] God who judges her Amen hallelujah
[54:38] now that you're the third blasphemy is
[54:42] then that dwell in heaven you probably
[54:46] know it but the doctrine Rome has is
[54:48] communion of saints they literally say
[54:52] in their catechism that they make
[54:55] spiritual exchanges with Saints so when
[54:58] they pray they pray to st. James or they
[55:01] pray to us you know mother Mary they're
[55:03] making spiritual exchanges and we know
[55:06] brother Branham calls that spiritualism
[55:08] in other words it's witchcraft see
[55:11] everytime they pray to st. Andrew or
[55:13] they pray to Saint Peter they're making
[55:15] exchanges with Devils right and they say
[55:19] and I just have some of my friends I
[55:21] haven't felt led to rebuke him yet on
[55:24] Facebook but some of my friends say oh
[55:25] oh look my prayer to st. Andrew was
[55:28] answered this and this and this happened
[55:29] I thought my those Devils are slick
[55:31] aren't they they can try to line things
[55:33] up where Lemire where it looks like that
[55:35] prayers were answered
[55:36] but listen only God answers prayer when
[55:41] they say that happens it's either one or
[55:43] two things either God had mercy on their
[55:45] ignorance or the devil's aligned things
[55:47] up and made it look like the prayers
[55:48] were answered oh I sold my house because
[55:50] I prayed in the name of Saint so and so
[55:53] that has nothing to do with it amen that
[55:55] Saint didn't hear the prayer there's one
[55:58] mediator between God and man the man
[55:59] Christ Jesus so see that blasphemes them
[56:03] in heaven can everybody see that well
[56:07] Graham says that's triple blasphemy now
[56:10] as I told you let's go down to verse 11
[56:12] now here we see the next beast so now
[56:15] you know there's two beasts in
[56:17] Revelation 13 there's a beast out of the
[56:20] sea but the RAM calls that Imperial
[56:22] pagan Rome in the church age book and
[56:24] now there's the beast out of the earth
[56:28] which we
[56:29] this is the United States so now it is
[56:32] that demon power of the spirit of Rome
[56:35] moving the United States
[56:37] right because gee because mother ham
[56:40] said thus saith the Lord according to
[56:42] Matthew for Satan controls every
[56:44] government in the world
[56:46] right every government the world so you
[56:49] don't you have to wonder like who's
[56:51] who's the spirit behind you know that
[56:54] the government of india which spear is
[56:56] behind india what spirits behind russia
[56:58] the Iron Curtain the bamboo curtain what
[57:01] spirit is behind China
[57:03] what spears behind United States you
[57:05] never have to wonder the spear behind it
[57:07] is Satan himself remember Jesus never
[57:10] argued when Satan said well I I could
[57:12] give you all these powers I could give
[57:14] you all these kingdoms Jesus never
[57:16] argued Satan got that power because he
[57:19] tricked Adam right or in a tricked Eve
[57:21] and then Adam willingly gave up his
[57:23] rights in the Garden of Eden right the
[57:26] Bible said whom a man is overcome the
[57:29] same he's come into bondage of right so
[57:33] when Adam forfeit his rights and took
[57:35] part took of that that that sex act we
[57:38] know with Eve he he forfeited his power
[57:41] he forfeit his rights and now Satan has
[57:44] these rights as god of this world but
[57:47] thank god there's a God of the universe
[57:48] that's higher than Satan and that's our
[57:52] God amen now the Beast
[57:58] out of the earth now let's look at a few
[57:59] scriptures here so the beast out of the
[58:01] earth is the power of the holy roman
[58:04] unholy roman empire so I keep saying
[58:06] holy it's unholy Roman Empire in the
[58:09] United States so verse 11 through 18 is
[58:13] important for you and I people ask me
[58:15] all the time
[58:16] questions all the time people asked me
[58:18] it was the United States in the Bible
[58:19] and I said yes it's in Revelation 13
[58:21] verses 11 to 18 right thank God that we
[58:25] know that now brother man tells us this
[58:29] here that beast represents power
[58:36] scarlet represents royal he says and
[58:38] means scarlet means red and beast means
[58:41] power now I want you to know something
[58:46] here brother BAM I'm quoting from 1958
[58:48] we are not denomination he said when you
[58:51] see that beast coming up out of the sea
[58:52] it meant that this power was raising up
[58:54] among the people but in Revelation 13
[58:57] when this lamb came up he came up out of
[58:59] the earth
[59:00] no people united states now a member
[59:04] church when when the pilgrims came here
[59:06] there was Native Americans here I read a
[59:09] quote that said there was about a
[59:10] hundred million Native Americans already
[59:12] here but compare that hundred million
[59:15] with all the people in Africa right
[59:18] Europe China right because in imperial
[59:23] pagan rome was huge rome controlled
[59:26] almost all of europe right it did
[59:28] control all of europe and most of africa
[59:30] and when those when those little
[59:32] pilgrims those separative you know made
[59:34] it through the storms and got over here
[59:36] it was a much smaller population right
[59:39] and that represents the land this beast
[59:43] rose up out of North America it wasn't
[59:46] like Imperial pagan Rome that rose up
[59:48] right out of where Alexander had had
[59:51] exited it was a much smaller number of
[59:56] people and so Bodrum tells us this beast
[59:59] out of the land is the United States and
[1:00:02] then after he had two little horns civil
[1:00:06] and ecclesiastical powers and then he
[1:00:09] received power and spake like the dragon
[1:00:11] did before him so you just got to mark
[1:00:14] it down now here here's a the state the
[1:00:16] Lord
[1:00:17] he said we the United States we are
[1:00:21] coming in to religious persecution with
[1:00:23] the same things they did in pagan Rome
[1:00:26] many years ago for its thus saith the
[1:00:28] Lord so America is going to have a
[1:00:32] religious persecution and it's not maybe
[1:00:36] it's thus saith the Lord
[1:00:38] that's what revelation 13 11 through 18
[1:00:41] is all about brother Ram said it's thus
[1:00:44] saith the Lord it's going to happen
[1:00:45] doesn't look like it now but it's going
[1:00:48] to build up into it
[1:00:49] that's right now look away to Jesus
[1:00:52] brother man reads this and he says
[1:00:54] there's coming a time in this nation to
[1:00:56] where this nation is going to exercise
[1:00:58] all the power that the Beast had before
[1:01:02] it which was pagan Rome when it became
[1:01:04] papal Rome see that this nation would do
[1:01:07] that see because it's the same Beast the
[1:01:10] Beast that rose up by the sea is now the
[1:01:13] same Beast rising up out of the land in
[1:01:15] the United States if you can see that
[1:01:19] can you say Amen everybody see that all
[1:01:21] right let me get to my spot here I'd
[1:01:26] like to get to you okay
[1:01:30] he says revelation 13 plainly explains
[1:01:33] it the lamb come up out of the earth the
[1:01:35] other beasts come up out of water
[1:01:36] thickness and multitudes of people this
[1:01:38] lamb come up where there were no people
[1:01:40] a lamb represents religion the Lamb of
[1:01:42] God remember it spoke like a lamb it was
[1:01:44] a lamb and after a while it be received
[1:01:48] power and spoke like a dragon and
[1:01:50] exercised all the power the dragon had
[1:01:53] before him and the dragon is Rome always
[1:01:55] see don't you see Roman denomination a
[1:01:58] mark Protestant denomination an image
[1:02:01] under the Beast so Protestants are the
[1:02:03] image under the beast but Rome is the
[1:02:07] Beast can risky that Rome is the Beast
[1:02:10] that the woman rides but the image of
[1:02:12] the beast since that this beast is
[1:02:13] invisible right this beast power is
[1:02:16] invisible
[1:02:17] so the Beast power needs an image and
[1:02:19] that visible image is the World Council
[1:02:22] churches does you know right now they
[1:02:25] literally says on their website I could
[1:02:27] show it to you if you like afterwards it
[1:02:29] literally says one of their goals is to
[1:02:31] be an image of Christian unity
[1:02:34] it's one of their it's right there they
[1:02:37] seek to be an image for Christian unity
[1:02:40] and the Bible says they're the image
[1:02:42] under the Beast and they represent over
[1:02:46] 500 million Protestants right now they
[1:02:49] represent they're not United with
[1:02:50] Catholics the World Council of Churches
[1:02:53] represents over 500 million Christians
[1:02:56] Protestant Christians so see it's it's
[1:02:59] exactly what the Prophet said
[1:03:03] he said they'll make a power that'll
[1:03:04] force all Protestants like a union
[1:03:06] you'll have to be in this council
[1:03:08] churches or you won't be able to have
[1:03:10] fellowship all right now let me just
[1:03:15] show you these I want to real briefly
[1:03:18] say this the United States is the
[1:03:20] modern-day Rome both Rome and the United
[1:03:23] States had the largest economies in the
[1:03:25] world
[1:03:25] they had their strongest militaries they
[1:03:29] had the most influential politics all
[1:03:32] the other little countries in the time
[1:03:34] of Rome wanted to be like Rome because
[1:03:36] they had a republic right they had the
[1:03:39] most advanced technologies like United
[1:03:41] States they had the most freedom and
[1:03:45] variety and cultural expressions
[1:03:46] Constantine made sure of that
[1:03:48] he started protecting Christians when
[1:03:50] before Christians could very easily be
[1:03:52] martyred but he started protecting them
[1:03:54] so now Rome had a freedom of religion
[1:03:58] and the most religious tolerance and
[1:04:01] that's what we have in America right now
[1:04:03] even Muslims are now in the the House of
[1:04:06] Representatives right in the Senate you
[1:04:07] know what it what a sad thing that is
[1:04:09] because of their hate crimes while that
[1:04:13] they stand for but see it was the most
[1:04:16] it so the modern Rome I'm sorry ancient
[1:04:19] Rome matches modern Rome which is the
[1:04:21] United States of America that's just
[1:04:24] perfectly and see it's like a lamb which
[1:04:28] means a bison or Buffalo on 13 2016 then
[1:04:33] President Barack Obama made the bison
[1:04:35] the official national mammal of I'd say
[1:04:38] of America there's only two animals I
[1:04:40] represent in the United States right huh
[1:04:42] eagle and that was wrong symbol right
[1:04:45] now okay never eagle in the book and now
[1:04:49] a bison by God is good amen God has
[1:04:54] showed us these symbols praise church we
[1:04:56] can't miss it the only way you'll miss
[1:04:58] it is if you're not listening to Holy
[1:04:59] Spirit but if you're listening the Holy
[1:05:01] Spirit blessed it are your ears for they
[1:05:03] hear we cannot miss it there are no
[1:05:06] excuses in this message God has sent us
[1:05:09] a prophet to tell us exactly what this
[1:05:11] book means praise God and when we have
[1:05:14] the power of this book then we have the
[1:05:15] power of Revelation to overcome all of
[1:05:17] Satan's tactics amen it's exactly right
[1:05:23] now I said this is he said thickness and
[1:05:26] multitudes of people's water then this
[1:05:28] is where there's no people United States
[1:05:29] he said two horns like a lamb not a lamb
[1:05:32] see it's like a lamb not a lamb what is
[1:05:36] it it's our American Buffalo and has two
[1:05:38] horns
[1:05:39] Ram says he had freedom of religion
[1:05:42] first he acted like a lamb he spoke like
[1:05:44] a lamb but remember he never did become
[1:05:47] an old Ram he was a lamb this country is
[1:05:50] only 150 years old you know just a lamb
[1:05:53] how many know that Rome lasted over 500
[1:05:56] years Rome lasted over 500 years right
[1:06:00] we're just little over 200 right now
[1:06:03] right
[1:06:04] 1776 1896 I'm sorry 18 1876 1976 right
[1:06:11] so we're not even we're about half of
[1:06:13] what Rome actually did so considered a
[1:06:15] young country now I want to look at this
[1:06:19] here again and I want to just show a
[1:06:23] little bit of history I was researching
[1:06:24] this week so Catholicism United States
[1:06:31] let me know this guy here now brother
[1:06:34] Graham said he might have been a nice
[1:06:36] guy he said but it was that spirit
[1:06:38] behind him that will cause all the
[1:06:40] trouble now
[1:06:42] how many know about his personal life he
[1:06:45] had an awful awful personal life this
[1:06:47] guy JFK let me know that and now it's
[1:06:52] starting to come out now there was
[1:06:54] rumors before but these last 10 years
[1:06:57] all that's come out it's awful now I
[1:07:01] want to read you this first one oh look
[1:07:08] at this now before I get too
[1:07:10] FK remember this this nation this beast
[1:07:14] speaks like a dragon how does America
[1:07:18] speak like a dragon every president
[1:07:22] brags on how great we are right not just
[1:07:26] Donald Trump he's just the next one
[1:07:28] they've all bragged on it but the the
[1:07:30] clearest bragging I could find was last
[1:07:33] year Donald Trump before the United
[1:07:34] Nations he stood there in front of
[1:07:36] United Nations and he said this he said
[1:07:39] America's military will assume be more
[1:07:42] powerful than it has ever been before so
[1:07:45] look at him look he stands her but like
[1:07:47] every president of that Obama Bush they
[1:07:50] all did it you know they all stand there
[1:07:52] for nine nations say were the greatest
[1:07:54] power there is what did what did they do
[1:07:55] in church they're fulfilling the
[1:07:57] scripture that says they speak like a
[1:07:58] dragon
[1:07:59] hey remember Trump Trump threatened them
[1:08:03] he said we're gonna cut off some of our
[1:08:04] funny he said you guys need to provide
[1:08:06] some of this funding to what is he doing
[1:08:08] he's bossing around the rest of the
[1:08:10] countries because he's got power to do
[1:08:12] it right he said he said you got it too
[1:08:17] easy under Obama they let you you know
[1:08:19] bomb would've just paid everything and
[1:08:20] let you guys just do it everyone he said
[1:08:22] you need to you need to do your fair
[1:08:24] share right he stand there talking like
[1:08:28] a dragon because it's it's the likes
[1:08:32] brother like brother BAM said thus saith
[1:08:33] the Lord it's Satan's the power behind
[1:08:35] all these government's right that was
[1:08:41] September 2018 and did you know
[1:08:44] President Trump said he said he said our
[1:08:48] government or he said our are our
[1:08:53] cabinet
[1:08:53] yeah our administration in the first two
[1:08:56] years he says has accomplished more than
[1:08:58] almost any administration in the history
[1:09:01] of America did you know he said that and
[1:09:03] United Nations are laughing and Trump
[1:09:07] County got upset he said you shouldn't
[1:09:08] be laughing at that
[1:09:09] he said we have the lowest and
[1:09:10] unemployment rate and he named off all
[1:09:12] these all these things about our country
[1:09:14] but what am I trying to show you I'm
[1:09:16] trying to show you that America's
[1:09:18] speaking like a dragon
[1:09:20] just like the Bible said
[1:09:25] saw presidents like Ronald Reagan he
[1:09:27] threatened the Soviet Union I said you
[1:09:29] better break it up and what happened a
[1:09:31] few years later they broke it up
[1:09:33] remember the wall came down when I was a
[1:09:35] child I remember that I'm ever watching
[1:09:37] on TV when the for the Cold War you know
[1:09:41] the cold cold war ended apparently
[1:09:44] because what what happens one of these
[1:09:47] great leaders of the Dragons stands up
[1:09:49] and they speak against it what did
[1:09:52] George H Bush do he spoke against a
[1:09:55] Saudi Arabian what happened Desert Storm
[1:09:58] now I think I was 1988 I think guys or
[1:10:00] eight 1989 I remember when that happened
[1:10:02] I remember being after church I remember
[1:10:04] being in a grocery store and I heard an
[1:10:06] ounce of the grocery store that that
[1:10:08] they had their first attack there on
[1:10:09] Saudi Arabian desert storm see they
[1:10:13] speak it and it happens george w bush
[1:10:16] thought they had weapons right thought
[1:10:18] saddam hussein had weapons so what they
[1:10:21] do they go in there and they don't find
[1:10:22] any weapons but they start in this big
[1:10:24] war i don't remember that what are they
[1:10:26] doing they're speaking like a dragon
[1:10:29] they've got power and they make
[1:10:32] phenomenal claims like a dragon and they
[1:10:34] give warnings they breathe out warnings
[1:10:35] like a dragon oh my now if satan's got
[1:10:39] that power how much more power
[1:10:41] brother/sister do we have when we speak
[1:10:43] with the word of god amen it came out of
[1:10:47] jesus it comes out of Jesus in
[1:10:49] Revelation 19 and it comes out like a
[1:10:51] sword and fire burns them all up what
[1:10:54] about when we speak the Word of God
[1:10:55] church that is our that is our greatest
[1:10:58] power to be like Jesus and say it is
[1:11:00] written Satan it is written and when you
[1:11:03] speak the Word of God like that it's
[1:11:05] spiritual fire that goes out and if you
[1:11:07] keep resisting Satan he's gotta flee
[1:11:10] from you praise God remember that quote
[1:11:14] I just read it let me uh I just read it
[1:11:17] when I preached on the number 40 let me
[1:11:21] read this again brother Graham said
[1:11:22] remember Jesus showed her how it's done
[1:11:25] showed the bride forty days of
[1:11:28] temptation he was tempted above any man
[1:11:30] that ever could be tempted in the
[1:11:32] temptation of Jesus Christ glory you and
[1:11:36] I will never have a harder temptation
[1:11:38] than Christ right
[1:11:39] and what weatherman showed us he said
[1:11:42] Jesus showed us how to overcome that you
[1:11:44] speak the Word of God and say thus saith
[1:11:47] the Lord or thus saith the Word of God
[1:11:49] Satan the Word says this and you've got
[1:11:52] to back away praise God he didn't do a
[1:11:58] miracle he didn't even ask God for a
[1:12:00] miracle
[1:12:01] he just said though this is the word
[1:12:02] this is the word this is what the word
[1:12:05] says
[1:12:05] and pretty soon Satan just gets fed up
[1:12:07] with it he can't make Jesus move so he
[1:12:10] just says fine I'll try again later I'll
[1:12:11] study him I'll come back again and then
[1:12:13] the angels come to Jesus and strengthen
[1:12:15] him and alls he had to do was speak the
[1:12:18] fire of the Word of God and it got too
[1:12:21] hot for Satan amen glory in church
[1:12:25] listen any special meeting you go to I
[1:12:28] don't care which special meeting you can
[1:12:30] go to the specialist meeting in the
[1:12:32] message you can go to Jeffersonville you
[1:12:35] can go to Louisiana you can go to Happy
[1:12:38] Valley you see you can go around any
[1:12:41] church in the world and let me tell you
[1:12:42] this you will hear the same thing the
[1:12:45] same word that will set you free at
[1:12:46] those that conventions is the same we're
[1:12:49] saying here tonight speak the word to
[1:12:52] Satan is that right obey God's Word draw
[1:12:55] nigh to God resist the devil and he will
[1:12:58] flee from you I take courage that has a
[1:13:03] pastor I can't go to these big
[1:13:04] conventions but I found out through
[1:13:06] revelation of the Holy Spirit that Jesus
[1:13:09] overcame the greatest attack by speaking
[1:13:12] the Word of God and when people go to
[1:13:14] these meetings which is great it's fine
[1:13:16] when they go to the meetings they're
[1:13:17] never gonna hear anything greater to
[1:13:19] overcome their current trials than what
[1:13:21] we hear tonight speak the word and go
[1:13:24] forward fight Satan with the Word of God
[1:13:27] do not sin do not give in the lusts do
[1:13:31] not give in to temptation speak the Word
[1:13:33] of God resist Satan and Satan has to
[1:13:36] flee amen
[1:13:37] and so that was that mean brother Aaron
[1:13:40] that means every service can be a
[1:13:42] revival convention service
[1:13:45] it doesn't take big numbers brother man
[1:13:48] said his greatest meetings were with big
[1:13:50] numbers or with small little groups what
[1:13:51] do you say small little groups but we
[1:13:54] think somehow we think well the more
[1:13:57] people the better now now it's true you
[1:13:58] have more licks of fire but Church with
[1:14:01] more people you have more unbelief with
[1:14:06] lesser people you have lesser unbelief
[1:14:09] but Jesus said if there's two or three
[1:14:11] I'm right there amen
[1:14:13] and so every survey that's the power of
[1:14:16] a faithful pastoral ministry because at
[1:14:20] conventions they can't preach any higher
[1:14:21] than anyone any pastor can preach
[1:14:23] because it's the same keys to your
[1:14:26] victory every time obey the Word of God
[1:14:28] repent get your life cleaned up speak
[1:14:32] the Word of God speak thus saith the
[1:14:33] Lord and Satan has to leave your life
[1:14:36] amen so don't feel bad if you can't make
[1:14:40] it a Jeffersonville or don't feel bad if
[1:14:42] you can't make it to Louisiana or New
[1:14:44] York or special meetings really Church
[1:14:46] God didn't God never said you have to
[1:14:49] have a message Mecca right you have to
[1:14:53] go to a certain message convention to
[1:14:55] get the Holy Ghost you can get it right
[1:14:57] here you have to go to a special place
[1:15:00] to get a healing you don't have to go to
[1:15:02] Jeffersonville to get a healing you
[1:15:04] don't have to have a prayer cloth from
[1:15:05] brother Branham brother Branham said
[1:15:07] that doesn't heal you anyway it just
[1:15:09] raises your faith it's supposed to just
[1:15:11] raise your faith and show you that God's
[1:15:12] there that's all that's what any gift
[1:15:15] can do no gift can heal you it's faith
[1:15:17] that heals you and so we don't have to
[1:15:21] feel bad if there's fewer people we
[1:15:23] should be encouraged because we get
[1:15:24] there's fewer less unbelief and if we
[1:15:27] can just get that cast out and look
[1:15:29] beyond the veil and just see that Jesus
[1:15:31] Christ is here we can speak the word in
[1:15:34] all of our lives and have great victory
[1:15:36] tonight I'm gonna preach another sermon
[1:15:39] on that Lord willing in the future I'm
[1:15:41] just gonna blast that that idea that we
[1:15:43] have to have a message Mecca or we have
[1:15:45] to go to Jeffersonville just to be
[1:15:47] healed now don't get me wrong if God's
[1:15:49] leading you to go to a certain place and
[1:15:51] you just then yes you obey that leading
[1:15:53] but I'm trying to get the attitude err
[1:15:56] that that that bad that
[1:15:58] that feeling that we get we're all I
[1:16:00] can't go to special places and I I'll
[1:16:03] never get it because I can't go there
[1:16:05] that's the whole purpose of the Holy
[1:16:07] Ghost thing is that you don't have to go
[1:16:11] to a certain place or a certain person
[1:16:13] you've got to go to Christ and Christ is
[1:16:16] everywhere amen
[1:16:17] he said wherever you're gathered in my
[1:16:19] name I am there that's what makes this
[1:16:22] Testament so great the Holy Ghost New
[1:16:25] Testament is because the Holy Ghost can
[1:16:26] be everywhere at once amen
[1:16:28] I'll try not to raise my voice amen
[1:16:31] thank the Lord but that's the great
[1:16:33] burden I feel right now Church you have
[1:16:35] to feel bad if you can't go to Tennessee
[1:16:37] you have to feel bad if you can't go to
[1:16:39] Canada at a tea mystical Church or or so
[1:16:42] your brother Donny Reagan's Church or
[1:16:43] you know an Arizona Church you'd have to
[1:16:46] feel bad because the same Holy Ghost
[1:16:47] since there's here and the same way to
[1:16:50] overcome is the same way to overcome
[1:16:52] there as it is here confess your sin
[1:16:55] believe the word do not sin speak the
[1:16:58] word and all those demons have to leave
[1:17:00] you and then you can enjoy peace then
[1:17:04] you can enjoy a season of rest so that's
[1:17:09] what I did I went listen and there's
[1:17:11] wonderful youth meetings Louisiana last
[1:17:14] weekend they have it every year for
[1:17:15] Easter
[1:17:15] I've always felt bad that I can't go
[1:17:17] well I just went we listened to the last
[1:17:18] two sermons and that's all it was about
[1:17:20] get the baptism Holy Ghost so you can
[1:17:23] fight Satan and be an overcomer in your
[1:17:25] home and speak the Word of God against
[1:17:27] Satan that's all that was preached and I
[1:17:28] don't mean that in a derogatory way well
[1:17:30] what I mean that is that you and I that
[1:17:33] is so simple we don't need some some
[1:17:35] special message we just need to do what
[1:17:38] the Bible said the same thing Jesus did
[1:17:40] to Satan that's all we have to do just
[1:17:43] say it is written devil I'm not gonna
[1:17:47] try to produce something I'm not gonna
[1:17:48] let you trick me I'm gonna obey God's
[1:17:50] Word I'm gonna speak the word and I'll
[1:17:52] be an overcomer just like Christ then
[1:17:54] you'll be a happy Christian right then
[1:17:58] you'll be a victorious Christian see I
[1:18:02] knew that was in my heart because I've
[1:18:03] just been struck you know I've been
[1:18:04] meditating on that all week or so
[1:18:08] thankful listen those messages oh that's
[1:18:10] great for the youth and that they
[1:18:12] the end the meetings by saying you know
[1:18:14] all the anointing you felt here it's
[1:18:16] eventually going to fade from your human
[1:18:19] spirit and so you've got to have the
[1:18:21] baptism Holy Ghost so when you go home
[1:18:23] or you go to school they're talking all
[1:18:25] these teenagers that you can rebuke
[1:18:27] Satan and get the victory that's all
[1:18:29] that's all that it was it wasn't some
[1:18:31] new revelation you never heard before
[1:18:32] you're not missing out Church you're
[1:18:34] being fed real good here by the Holy
[1:18:36] Spirit not me by the Holy Spirit and the
[1:18:39] same way you overcome all you know and
[1:18:42] then he can't mean the same way is the
[1:18:44] same way it does here just get the
[1:18:46] anointing here draw nigh to God and God
[1:18:48] will draw nigh to you so you kick Satan
[1:18:51] out of your home
[1:18:52] kick Satan out off your phone or kick
[1:18:55] Satan off what are you ever listening to
[1:18:56] kick Satan out of there and watch God
[1:18:58] come on the scene thank you Lord what
[1:19:04] does he do he speaks like a dragon
[1:19:10] now let me look at this guy real quick
[1:19:13] here now lord have mercy on him I don't
[1:19:15] know where I don't know where he's going
[1:19:18] now here's some exact quotes from
[1:19:22] history JFK was elected president in
[1:19:25] 1960 when brother Branham saw that huh
[1:19:28] me know what he said he said the Holy
[1:19:30] Spirit said you need to write this down
[1:19:32] and warn the people so they know which
[1:19:34] hour were living in when he got elected
[1:19:36] the Holy Spirit told brother Branham you
[1:19:39] need to go preach on the Seven Church
[1:19:41] Ages and tell the people where they're
[1:19:43] at
[1:19:44] praise God that was important and then
[1:19:51] God came and vindicated that seven
[1:19:53] Church ages with that moon remember that
[1:19:55] moon picture be coming and vindicated
[1:19:59] and the Holy Spirit showed the the seven
[1:20:01] church age is his moons right and
[1:20:03] showing how much light there was in each
[1:20:04] age so this was really important for
[1:20:07] history because this is when the Roman
[1:20:10] Catholic Church finally got we'd say
[1:20:12] come accepted right you know if you
[1:20:18] don't know I'll let you know the Pilgrim
[1:20:19] Fathers left Europe because they were
[1:20:22] being persecuted by the Church of
[1:20:24] England which was
[1:20:26] just a offshoot of the Roman Catholic
[1:20:27] Church and we know that they are being
[1:20:33] persecuted so they they ran around for
[1:20:35] years they finally got a charter they
[1:20:37] finally paid this company helped him
[1:20:38] sail over the first year was awful and
[1:20:40] we know the second year the Native
[1:20:41] Americans helped him to add Thanksgiving
[1:20:44] and all that good stuff but the reason
[1:20:47] they came was to get away from the
[1:20:48] mother harlot but in 1960 John Kennedy
[1:20:52] said or the history says John Kennedy
[1:20:56] had to fight against the widespread
[1:20:57] conviction that rollno Roman Catholic
[1:21:00] candidate could ever be elected
[1:21:01] president and he narrowly won the
[1:21:04] presidency he didn't win it by lot and
[1:21:06] there's still a lot of history that
[1:21:08] thinks they cheated the voting system
[1:21:09] which brother Graham said they did he
[1:21:13] should not have beat
[1:21:14] Nixon mother ham said he saw an article
[1:21:16] that said every vote for Nixon was
[1:21:17] turned over to JFK in some places and
[1:21:22] there's that I even read that today in
[1:21:23] the Britannica they still think that
[1:21:25] that these voting machines are were
[1:21:28] corrupted somebody cheated the system
[1:21:31] and then that history said Kennedy rose
[1:21:35] above the religious taboo against Roman
[1:21:37] Catholics I've seen I've seen propaganda
[1:21:44] from United States newspapers against
[1:21:47] the Roman Catholic so in our country
[1:21:49] started in 1776
[1:21:50] so newspapers would put out articles
[1:21:52] about the dangers of Roman Catholicism
[1:21:55] and slowly over the years of their okay
[1:22:00] oh they're okay and pretty soon in 1960
[1:22:04] they elect a Roman Catholic the very
[1:22:07] thing they left to try to get a get
[1:22:10] religious freedom is the very thing they
[1:22:12] left back in did you know in 1960 in
[1:22:17] Houston Texas mine I just struck me
[1:22:20] Kennedy before he got elected had to go
[1:22:22] and preach to a bunch of Protestant
[1:22:24] ministers and promise them this is
[1:22:26] history I could show to you and promised
[1:22:28] them he would not combine church and
[1:22:30] state he would keep them separate and
[1:22:31] they voted for him because he was here's
[1:22:34] when history says he had style he was
[1:22:37] handsome he
[1:22:38] glamour he was witty he was really
[1:22:42] sharpened and funny that's why people
[1:22:44] voted for him now here's two articles if
[1:22:51] you want him I can share with you
[1:22:53] JFK was the first president to wear
[1:22:56] makeup it's history I can show you the
[1:23:00] article because he wore at the first
[1:23:03] televised presidential debate against
[1:23:05] Nixon Nixon came in there he just got
[1:23:08] done history says he just got done
[1:23:11] giving a camp a campaign speech to labor
[1:23:13] unions he was worn out and he was
[1:23:15] getting a five o'clock shadow so they
[1:23:16] just rubbed some stuff he didn't want to
[1:23:18] shave he's all tired so when they go on
[1:23:21] TV
[1:23:22] Kennedy's this big fan sees that make up
[1:23:24] all over he's smart and handsome and
[1:23:26] witty and Nixon's like when can we get
[1:23:29] this over with he's just tired and you
[1:23:32] look history says he looks like death
[1:23:34] and there Kennedy looks like life and he
[1:23:38] appealed to the women because he was so
[1:23:40] handsome in church that's not all he did
[1:23:42] with women these two articles right here
[1:23:45] say he had at least six women in the
[1:23:48] White House he'd sleep with at least and
[1:23:50] that's outside of his wife and one of
[1:23:54] them said she had a commit abortion of
[1:23:56] one of his children they have love
[1:23:59] letters that are auctioned off for I
[1:24:02] think one was auctioned off for $30,000
[1:24:04] a couple years ago it's his love letter
[1:24:06] begging one of these women to come and
[1:24:08] spend time near Washington DC so he
[1:24:10] could they can do things together and he
[1:24:13] signs it Jay he decides it with Jay for
[1:24:15] John
[1:24:16] they notes his handwriting they can
[1:24:17] prove it's his handwriting and one of
[1:24:22] them is
[1:24:23] was murdered shortly after he was shot
[1:24:26] in Dallas Texas and died in 1963 and
[1:24:30] it's still unsolved these are the
[1:24:31] articles right here you can look it up I
[1:24:33] can show it to you
[1:24:34] and so those White House interns the 18
[1:24:38] year olds they hire right out of high
[1:24:39] school he would sleep with them he would
[1:24:42] his workers would try to see who would
[1:24:44] like to do it and they'd bring him in
[1:24:46] there and he would just take one after
[1:24:47] another and this is what the gut this is
[1:24:52] what the people elected and brother the
[1:24:54] Baron warned him about didn't he a
[1:24:56] prophet of God tried to warn him now
[1:24:58] look in 1950 the pillar of fire was in
[1:25:01] Houston Texas ah showing God's profit
[1:25:06] ten years later the president came to
[1:25:09] Houston Texas and they'd already so
[1:25:11] forgotten about the pillar fire that
[1:25:13] they believed a Catholic president and
[1:25:14] elected him in there as president and
[1:25:16] then that same Holy Spirit came in
[1:25:18] Brenham Tabernacle that same year and
[1:25:20] said I'm warning the people you're
[1:25:22] warning that it's only been 10 years
[1:25:23] since the pillar of fire picture was
[1:25:25] taken get back to the pillar of fire Oh
[1:25:28] No thank God you and I can get back to
[1:25:30] the pillar of fire we're not swayed with
[1:25:34] all this handsomeness and Hollywood and
[1:25:36] and put on and you know what his wife
[1:25:39] said you know what Jacqueline Kennedy
[1:25:40] said the reason she never got upset with
[1:25:42] all these I mean she got upset but the
[1:25:44] reason she never did about all the
[1:25:47] adulteries was because each night he
[1:25:50] would get down and she said like a
[1:25:51] little child and he would say his
[1:25:52] Catholic prayers before he went to bed
[1:25:54] no he didn't you know he wasn't with
[1:25:56] Marilyn Monroe Affairs the mayor and she
[1:26:00] knew all about it
[1:26:00] history her own autobiography talks
[1:26:03] about it this was not something that was
[1:26:05] like hidden you know from her she knew
[1:26:09] about it but see what was it it was a
[1:26:14] man who was so possessed with demons
[1:26:17] that he was just committing adultery
[1:26:19] often all the time if Mary Magdalene had
[1:26:23] seven demons because she was a how
[1:26:25] many demons of this guy have and he
[1:26:28] would try to repent and each night by
[1:26:31] his wife so I try to say sorry God
[1:26:32] forgive me and keep doing it not
[1:26:36] and this is what America elects Oh God
[1:26:39] give us some George Washington give us
[1:26:42] some Abraham Lincoln's right the brother
[1:26:44] hand said they'll never get a revival
[1:26:45] anyway right now I want to bring that to
[1:26:49] you so you understand this is what it
[1:26:51] produced this is what a Catholic
[1:26:57] president produced now fire from heaven
[1:27:04] now revelation 13 verse 13 yeah 1313
[1:27:09] said he doeth great wonders so that he
[1:27:11] maketh Fire come down from heaven on
[1:27:13] earth in the sight of men and brother
[1:27:15] Ram says what is that what beast makes
[1:27:18] fire come down from heaven
[1:27:19] well Ram said that's the atomic bomb
[1:27:22] which America dropped on Hiroshima and
[1:27:25] Nagasaki in August of 1945 you can we
[1:27:29] see the pictures it they detonated it
[1:27:32] how far above the city male Qaeda member
[1:27:34] how many feet it was like 500 meters or
[1:27:37] something like they're 150 meters and it
[1:27:39] detonated and a light fire went off and
[1:27:44] 70,000 people instantly died when they
[1:27:47] when they when they lit that off it was
[1:27:49] fire that came down from heaven and this
[1:27:53] is the dragon that rises up out of land
[1:27:55] it's the Roman Catholic Church right
[1:27:57] it's the spirit of Rome trying to divide
[1:28:00] and conquer
[1:28:01] the man I'm saying that it's that
[1:28:03] hydrogen bomb
[1:28:08] all the scripture lines up can you say
[1:28:10] men all the history lines up
[1:28:12] revelation 13 11 through 18 is the
[1:28:15] spirit of Rome in the United States now
[1:28:22] the image of the Beast the BAMF says is
[1:28:24] the World Council of Churches I don't
[1:28:27] have to go over that most of you know
[1:28:31] that
[1:28:39] all right the mark in the right hand of
[1:28:42] forehead I mentioned this but Graham
[1:28:43] said the mark in the right hand is doing
[1:28:45] what the council wants you to do so
[1:28:47] doing the works okay so we won't preach
[1:28:50] on this or will do this doing whatever
[1:28:52] they want but Graham said the mark in
[1:28:54] the forehead is the doctrines taking the
[1:28:56] doctrines of the beasts which are
[1:28:58] trinitarianism universalism we're all
[1:29:00] saved we're all family we're all part of
[1:29:02] the all children of God no we're not
[1:29:04] Jesus said some of you are from above he
[1:29:07] said my children from above and he said
[1:29:09] some of you are from below right amen we
[1:29:13] already said that we know where we're
[1:29:14] from we came from the mind of Christ how
[1:29:17] do you know because you love the word of
[1:29:18] Christ what's the number of the man the
[1:29:23] carries filleted a which means Vicar of
[1:29:25] gods and that number in Roman numerals
[1:29:29] adds up to 666 it's got to be a number
[1:29:32] of a man remember it has to match all
[1:29:36] the other some people say well although
[1:29:37] Mystery Babylon is Istanbul Turkey or
[1:29:41] it's two Muslims or it's Jerusalem it
[1:29:44] can't be it has 11 descriptions Church
[1:29:47] Mystery Babylon has 11 descriptions and
[1:29:49] every one is Rome praise God every one
[1:29:54] is Rome and you can prove it and the
[1:29:56] only man that has a connection to Rome
[1:29:59] that will rule over the world that's
[1:30:01] called a vicar someone who's in the
[1:30:03] place of Jesus Christ is the Pope of
[1:30:05] Rome and there it is I showed you the
[1:30:09] screenshot so if you go to Google
[1:30:10] Translate you type in vicars for the day
[1:30:13] it's Vicar of gods so he is in the stead
[1:30:17] of God they call him and on the website
[1:30:22] and their catechism they say because
[1:30:23] they call the Vicar of Christ so he's in
[1:30:26] the stead of Christ now let me close
[1:30:30] with this I want to just remind us of
[1:30:32] this about the squeeze look at verse 16
[1:30:35] brother branham said the squeeze and is
[1:30:37] in revelation 13:16 this is the squeeze
[1:30:43] now of course the squeeze happens right
[1:30:46] before this but let's read revelation 13
[1:30:48] and he causes all both small and great
[1:30:50] rich and poor
[1:30:51] free and bond to receive a mark in their
[1:30:52] right hand or in their foreheads
[1:30:57] now here's an exact quote from spoken
[1:31:01] word original seed 1962 brother Graham
[1:31:04] said the Holy Spirit said pick up your
[1:31:05] pen and write and he said I believe
[1:31:08] according to revelation 13:16
[1:31:09] that the bride will have to stop
[1:31:12] preaching for the Beast is demanding the
[1:31:14] mark in the right and the hand or
[1:31:17] forehead of permission to preach be
[1:31:19] granted a church I just had this thought
[1:31:24] the Antichrist spirit is gonna force me
[1:31:27] to stop preaching if I live long enough
[1:31:30] if I live long enough but who's trying
[1:31:35] to stop preachers from preaching right
[1:31:37] now are you with me some spirit in
[1:31:43] jeffersonville right I'm not saying it's
[1:31:46] on all the people but what spirit is
[1:31:48] trying to stop live preachers from
[1:31:51] preaching right now and it's trying to
[1:31:53] exalt an image of a holy man to the
[1:31:56] people to bow down and worship Him what
[1:31:58] spirit is that my god help us to have
[1:32:04] our eyes open Church see it's it's that
[1:32:10] spirit is already working in a immature
[1:32:13] way if right before the rapture I have
[1:32:17] to stop preaching if I live long enough
[1:32:18] and if I'm a bride member which I trust
[1:32:20] and hope I am they're gonna force me to
[1:32:23] stop preaching but there's some movement
[1:32:25] in the message that's already trying to
[1:32:27] force preachers to stop preaching and
[1:32:29] just play takes to me it looks like the
[1:32:34] same spirit so we just watch that
[1:32:39] I read that the Holy Spirit quicken that
[1:32:40] to me like oh that's already happening
[1:32:42] in a small way now it's not happening on
[1:32:45] this this level where like you know
[1:32:48] where someone's coming in here and
[1:32:51] making sure I don't preach like the
[1:32:52] government or something like that like a
[1:32:53] police officer it's not happening on
[1:32:55] that level but brother Graham said when
[1:32:57] the Holy Spirit told him pick up his pen
[1:32:59] and write we will have to stop preaching
[1:33:03] now what's beautiful about this is we
[1:33:08] don't have we won't in other words if
[1:33:09] the rapture takes place and we can't
[1:33:11] have the preaching then our lives will
[1:33:13] be have to be preaching Amen Oh glory I
[1:33:17] hope I said that right if we can't have
[1:33:19] live preaching and if they stop us from
[1:33:21] preaching may we have to go out to our
[1:33:22] houses and preach in the woods or
[1:33:24] something like that I don't know what's
[1:33:25] going to happen but if we can't have
[1:33:27] preaching then we better have lives that
[1:33:29] preach the gospel of Christ praise God
[1:33:32] because brother Ram said they're gonna
[1:33:34] silence the Brydon for the true bride
[1:33:35] from preaching oh my god help us and
[1:33:41] there's groups now that are trying to
[1:33:42] silence the preachers oh just listen and
[1:33:45] say oh just listen to tapes which is
[1:33:48] finally these tapes have a great
[1:33:49] ministry in your home right they have a
[1:33:52] great ministry too as a witnessing tool
[1:33:56] give those tapes out give those books
[1:33:58] out but you know church your life and
[1:34:03] your prayers and your love will speak
[1:34:05] louder than that I had a friend from
[1:34:07] college contact me this this yesterday
[1:34:09] he said brother Jesse he said I'm not
[1:34:11] back in church yet he said but your
[1:34:13] prayers have done wonders for me and I
[1:34:14] don't even know this he said you prayed
[1:34:17] for me for my business he's a barber
[1:34:19] he said you pray for my business and he
[1:34:20] said business is booming since you
[1:34:22] prayed for me I said well thank you Lord
[1:34:26] God heard my prayer and so I said can I
[1:34:28] send you one of my books he said
[1:34:29] absolutely so it's out in the mail I put
[1:34:31] out their mail today so if God honored
[1:34:34] my prayer for him there I trust God will
[1:34:36] honor my prayer God opened the eyes of
[1:34:38] my friend Deonte amen granite Lord bless
[1:34:43] him not just naturally bless him
[1:34:45] spiritually hallelujah see they're going
[1:34:50] try to stop the bride from preaching but
[1:34:51] it's already started a little bit out of
[1:34:52] that move out of Jeffersonville not
[1:34:54] everybody but it's already started to a
[1:34:59] little degree it's starting to build its
[1:35:00] way up I would have never thought that
[1:35:02] people from brother branham's own family
[1:35:05] or a church would tell me not to preach
[1:35:08] what brother Brahim is preaching like
[1:35:10] that I never come at wrap my mind around
[1:35:12] that but what I have to understand I
[1:35:14] have to understand that this is the
[1:35:16] spirit that's coming around the world
[1:35:18] it's gonna slowly increase to this point
[1:35:22] where right before the rapture the true
[1:35:24] bride will be forced to stop preaching
[1:35:27] Sabri understand I'm not saying anything
[1:35:31] I'm not calling anybody bad things
[1:35:32] really like that I'm just saying I can
[1:35:33] see that spirit already starting to work
[1:35:35] and God of course is still calling out
[1:35:38] his people out of her so how does the
[1:35:43] Beast conquer attacks you're home on
[1:35:45] already I just put this at the end I I
[1:35:47] preached this at the beginning but I
[1:35:48] just put at the end the same thing it at
[1:35:51] the beginning all right I stand to our
[1:35:53] feet here
[1:35:53] let's read proverbs 15 6 yeah it's the
[1:35:59] last Scripture let's read this together
[1:36:01] can y'all read this with me that's read
[1:36:03] on three one two three in the house of
[1:36:05] the righteous is much treasure but in
[1:36:08] the revenues of the wicked is trouble so
[1:36:10] C we see opposites I love the the Old
[1:36:12] Testament it always works with opposites
[1:36:14] right talks about the blessed and the
[1:36:16] curse well here it is so the opposite of
[1:36:18] treasure is trouble how many want the
[1:36:21] peace of God in their homes
[1:36:22] you just want peace you just want
[1:36:24] everyone to love each other get along
[1:36:25] don't sin against each other that's the
[1:36:28] treasure of the righteous Christian if
[1:36:32] there's trouble in your home there's
[1:36:33] something you can do about it you can go
[1:36:35] to the policeman Jesus and he'll take
[1:36:37] care of it
[1:36:38] i'li he'll enforce that law but you got
[1:36:42] to obey that law you've got to respect
[1:36:45] that law you've got if you've sinned you
[1:36:47] got to confess your sin you got to come
[1:36:48] clean right and then the trouble will
[1:36:52] leave
[1:36:53] speak the word to Satan obey the word of
[1:36:55] God speak the word against Satan Satan
[1:36:58] has to flee and now your house is filled
