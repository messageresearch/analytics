[0:02] amen God bless you all
[0:08] amen thank God for that song for all the
[0:12] songs amen but that song that last song
[0:16] bless into my
[0:18] heart amen thank God for bringing us
[0:21] here safely today
[0:24] amen left South Carolina it was
[0:28] 23° and I get here and you guys are a
[0:30] little lower than
[0:33] us so uh so me and brother Jesse
[0:37] yesterday we were running from the
[0:39] building to the
[0:42] car and uh this is the first time that I
[0:46] can remember cuz before leaving home you
[0:49] know I try to take inventory okay I got
[0:51] this this this I got socks I got
[0:55] belt so I did that two or three times
[0:58] I'm shooting out the door cuz I'm going
[1:00] to an airport I never used
[1:02] before and I'm riding down the road and
[1:05] I'm running it back through my mind okay
[1:06] I got this this this suit
[1:10] jacket I left my suit jacket hanging up
[1:15] so praise the
[1:18] lord it's okay though that don't stop
[1:21] the program of God amen amen I don't
[1:24] want to keep you standing long it's good
[1:26] to be here I'm grateful that the Lord is
[1:29] saw it
[1:30] to allow our paths to cross again I know
[1:33] brother Jesse isn't here but wherever he
[1:36] is I know the Lord is going to bless him
[1:38] and use him as in my heart I feel he
[1:41] always
[1:42] does um I don't believe he realizes the
[1:45] impact that he has uh not just locally
[1:49] but just through his efforts you know
[1:51] for what he sends out um cuz I got
[1:54] friends and whatever a
[1:56] brother that lives near the airport I
[1:58] was coming from he said make sure you
[2:00] greet brother Jesse for me brother I was
[2:02] like I will you know he said I watch his
[2:04] I watch I watch his YouTube
[2:06] videos you know so uh we never know how
[2:11] how we affect other people but God does
[2:15] and whomever is intended to reach or to
[2:17] touch or to change is going to achieve
[2:20] that when it comes from God so God bless
[2:24] each one of you let's get right into the
[2:26] word it's good to see everyone again
[2:30] amen uh my my xrp
[2:35] brother my
[2:38] xrp I know he's keeping in tune with
[2:41] everything and I'm not going to make no
[2:42] more comments about
[2:45] that it's time for the word so but it's
[2:48] good to see you all all right Joshua
[2:51] chapter 7 and starting at verse
[2:58] one
[3:01] Joshua 7
[3:04] verse1 and as as I believe the intention
[3:07] is for all of the word of God
[3:13] um what's upon my heart is is to to just
[3:17] help right put my shoulder together with
[3:20] the rest of the ministry and of course
[3:22] under the leadership of God to help to
[3:24] unlock all the full potentials of each
[3:28] one of us because it's going home
[3:30] time and um and we need one another yes
[3:35] more than maybe what we
[3:37] realize or rather I'm going say more
[3:39] than what we're mindful
[3:41] of so in Joshua 7 starting at verse one
[3:45] it says but the children of Israel
[3:48] committed a
[3:49] trespass it says in the accursed thing
[3:52] for aing the son of Ki uh the son of
[3:58] zabdi the son of of Zarah of the tribe
[4:01] of Judah took of the accursed thing and
[4:04] the anger of the Lord was kindled
[4:07] against the children of Israel let us
[4:10] pray Heavenly Father Lord we pray that
[4:13] you would help us this morning we're
[4:15] grateful for what you've done so far uh
[4:18] throughout all of our Lives Lord each
[4:20] one of us Lord have things that we can
[4:23] just give you Thanksgiving for father
[4:26] even for just being here Lord you
[4:28] brought us to this Place Lord you
[4:30] brought us to this phase of our lives
[4:33] but Lord there's yet more to be
[4:35] accomplished father there's more that
[4:37] you want to do within our lives and
[4:39] father that's why we're here Lord you
[4:41] gave us the desire to even be in church
[4:44] this morning Lord that's not a like
[4:46] thing many times we don't really see the
[4:49] power of what's really working within
[4:51] our lives Lord because it just happens
[4:53] in such a natural way but yet it's the
[4:56] supernatural moving of your spirit you
[4:59] brought us all us here safely father God
[5:01] we thank you for that Lord there are
[5:03] many that got into accidents today there
[5:05] are many that died today Lord God but
[5:08] you saw fit that we might be here Lord
[5:11] evidently it's for a purpose there's
[5:12] something that you want to achieve
[5:14] within each one of our Lives Lord help
[5:16] us to draw closer to you and may you
[5:19] just be able to have your way more than
[5:21] what you have before father that's your
[5:24] desire and that should be our desire to
[5:26] give you that first place forgive us of
[5:29] our sins
[5:30] forgive us of our iniquities Heavenly
[5:32] Father Lord we don't want to hurt you
[5:35] father we want to be able to Lord be
[5:37] pleasing in your sight and it's not that
[5:38] we're not Lord because you love us Lord
[5:42] with a love that can't be touched but
[5:44] Lord you have a desire for us Lord there
[5:47] is a place you want us to come to and so
[5:50] you gave us you provided all the tools
[5:53] the necessary tools for us Lord God to
[5:55] come into those places we thank you for
[5:58] the precious gift of your your Holy
[6:00] Spirit father it's been moving in all of
[6:02] our Lives Lord and may it move in a
[6:04] greater way in the mighty name of our
[6:06] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ may you
[6:08] bless your word to the hearts of your
[6:10] children in Jesus name we ask it amen
[6:13] amen God bless you Sint you may be
[6:20] seated for those that don't know me um
[6:23] brother Dennis
[6:24] McBride um Columbia South
[6:28] Carolina uh
[6:30] five kids my
[6:32] wife my everybody is getting bigger and
[6:36] older amen rightfully so right that's
[6:39] what life does you know that's the
[6:42] intent my oldest is 26 my youngest is 16
[6:46] that's my my baby girl four boys and a
[6:49] girl uh my son Benjamin he got
[6:52] married so uh kind of embarking on new
[6:56] territories there for
[6:58] me right but God's grace he's doing well
[7:01] amen so we just thank God for not only
[7:04] what he's doing in my life but I know
[7:06] each one of you can see his hand in your
[7:08] lives as well so I'm just grateful for
[7:10] what he's doing amongst the
[7:13] body
[7:14] um
[7:16] okay this particular message here
[7:24] um it really did something to
[7:28] me it really um it really did something
[7:32] to
[7:33] me in a good way
[7:38] um you know God always he has his ways
[7:41] of encouraging
[7:43] us you know he has his ways of dealing
[7:46] with us to help us to um to become
[7:50] better positioned so that we can be
[7:53] better used by him yes right amen and
[7:57] for the theme of what we're going to
[7:58] talk about this morning morning so that
[8:00] we can be a better benefit to one
[8:03] another amen right cuz we're a body yes
[8:10] amen what's what's one common thing
[8:13] about the body that you living in right
[8:16] now for for every part of your body
[8:19] what's what's one common
[8:24] thing they're all
[8:28] connected
[8:30] your whole body is connected one part is
[8:33] connected to the other and that helps
[8:35] with the functioning of the whole body
[8:38] and you need for every part of your body
[8:40] to work in the intended manner that's
[8:44] right isn't that
[8:46] right your thumb is a very little
[8:49] compared to your forearm and your bicep
[8:51] your thumb is kind of small in respect
[8:53] to your thighs and your feet right but
[8:57] if it don't
[8:58] work how would that make you
[9:01] feel would that affect you yes what if
[9:05] your
[9:06] fingernail somehow came
[9:09] off it serves a purpose that's right
[9:13] right uh what if all your fingernails
[9:15] came off you couldn't
[9:19] scratch right so if mosquito or whatever
[9:22] get on you couldn't right so it'll
[9:26] affect you if it's not able to do what
[9:27] it was intended to do if it's not there
[9:31] right that's how we affect one
[9:37] another so in our opening scripture here
[9:40] I chose this and this is kind of going
[9:41] to reach out and reach deep into
[9:44] different areas but I chose this portion
[9:47] uh just because of how it's
[9:50] worded right our bodies are connected
[9:54] the head connected to the neck so on and
[9:56] so forth right uh and
[10:01] here it's it's not a glorious thing to
[10:04] highlight but yet I believe it's a
[10:06] needful
[10:09] thing God gave Israel a
[10:12] promise um and and he he had intended on
[10:16] giving them everything that he said that
[10:18] he would right uh his word Can't Fail
[10:22] his promise Can't Fail amen right so God
[10:26] made this promise so it's as good as
[10:28] done
[10:29] that's right as soon as he declares it
[10:31] it's done so God told him I've already
[10:34] given you the land that's right amen it
[10:38] was already their he said just go and
[10:40] take
[10:41] it right so now he's leading them into
[10:45] this these battles or whatever to obtain
[10:48] the promised land that he said he had
[10:50] already given them so it didn't matter
[10:53] who is in the land the bottom line was
[10:55] the land was
[10:56] theirs and I want to encourage you
[10:59] because it doesn't matter what you have
[11:00] going on in your life you're going to
[11:03] come into the place that God promised
[11:04] he's going to bring you
[11:06] into sometimes our battles get hard they
[11:09] get heavy and they can be a bit
[11:10] discouraging at times amen but don't
[11:13] don't let the Giants in that land the
[11:16] demons that show themselves to be strong
[11:18] be a discouragement to you because your
[11:20] God is
[11:22] greater can we say praise the Lord today
[11:24] praise the Lord amen I know there are
[11:26] heavy burdens I know there are obstacles
[11:29] there are things that we're all really
[11:30] going through right because especially
[11:33] once you make that decision to live for
[11:35] God your battles are going to intensify
[11:38] they're going to
[11:39] multiply that's right you know and then
[11:42] you know because we have this sometimes
[11:44] thought of how Christianity should be
[11:46] you know man Lord I'm making a decision
[11:48] for you so now I know I'm going be shed
[11:50] with all kind of blessings and benefit
[11:53] and that's all true but the way in which
[11:56] he does that we don't we don't all we're
[11:58] not ready for that
[11:59] because God allows you to experience the
[12:02] bitter moments all of that is a part of
[12:04] giving you the promised
[12:06] land because there are things that he's
[12:08] establishing there is a relationship
[12:11] amen
[12:16] right there's a relationship that he
[12:18] wants to
[12:20] have a meaningful relationship amen not
[12:25] just coming to church and then going
[12:27] home and getting used to a religious
[12:30] program but no matter if you in the
[12:33] church or whether you at your in your at
[12:35] your job or whatever act an actual
[12:39] relationship to where he comes and moves
[12:42] on your heart and he talks to you and
[12:43] you can come to recognize that voice and
[12:46] then you can begin to talk back to him
[12:48] and you see him coming in and in a in a
[12:51] very intimate way moving in your
[12:54] life that's where it's at
[12:57] amen blessings thank you Lord you know
[13:00] all the things you do for me thank you
[13:02] Lord but that
[13:04] relationship that's his heart's desire
[13:06] amen he do all of that just to show you
[13:09] I'm
[13:10] real amen I'm on your side I'm here to
[13:13] take care of you I'm your God I'm your
[13:15] father I'm your husband I'm going
[13:17] provide everything I said I'm going
[13:18] provide for you but I want you to love
[13:20] me too amen amen yes I don't want to be
[13:24] the only one just giving my whole heart
[13:27] and making sure you're taking care of
[13:29] and looking after all of your needs and
[13:31] being there for you what about you and
[13:33] what you give to
[13:35] me that's what I want amen amen amen so
[13:40] with that being said I have to bring it
[13:42] to this place because in the midst of
[13:44] our battles God is delivering us from
[13:47] ourselves yes
[13:50] amen you can't really blame the devil
[13:53] for
[13:55] nothing cuz who makes the
[13:57] decisions
[14:00] Satan can't make
[14:02] listen Satan can't make no one of us do
[14:05] anything
[14:07] right can we say praise the Lord to
[14:11] that Satan can't make no devil can make
[14:13] you do
[14:16] anything all the devil can do is suggest
[14:19] to your mind what it's trying to lure
[14:21] you
[14:22] into but you have the power of
[14:27] decision it can't move Satan could not
[14:31] overcome Eve until her mind first
[14:36] changed she had to make the decision to
[14:39] consider what Satan had presented to her
[14:42] and once she did that she gave him the
[14:45] open door to come inside of her then
[14:48] that's when you begin to see her views
[14:50] change it's because when she opened up
[14:52] her mind to consider what Satan was
[14:55] saying the Spirit came into her right
[14:57] then and that's what brought about the
[14:59] the further changing of her views she
[15:02] began to see the tree as being one that
[15:04] was good for food and to make one wise
[15:07] but that was because Satan now had come
[15:09] in and now his mind was taking over her
[15:12] mind and causing her to see
[15:15] his what he had as being good and that's
[15:19] the only way a person can sin is because
[15:21] Satan successfully sells to you his
[15:25] product and causes you to see some sort
[15:28] of a benefit or something that you can
[15:31] achieve by giving yourself over to this
[15:35] thing and that's where bondages
[15:40] occur that's that's where oppressions
[15:42] come in at meaning now this evil spirit
[15:45] is moving and it it and the more place
[15:48] you give to it the stronger it becomes
[15:51] into what the Bible calls a
[15:56] stronghold because you a child child of
[15:59] God you don't want to do these things
[16:01] but because of the areas of
[16:04] weaknesses you find yourself giving in
[16:09] Temptations mental cuz Spirits they
[16:12] speak to your
[16:14] spirit right those the a Spirits a
[16:17] demon's voice comes to you in a form of
[16:19] a
[16:21] thought just like God's voice is
[16:24] thoughts he'll put on your heart to go
[16:27] pray but you just find yourself thinking
[16:29] on it but it's actually God speaking to
[16:33] you he'll tell you to go read your Bible
[16:36] the devil ain't going to tell you to do
[16:37] that ain't that right right but that's
[16:41] how that communicate and it
[16:43] listen that communication is taking
[16:46] place right
[16:48] now angels are present the holy spirit
[16:51] is present but demons are present and
[16:54] they try to work to distract us from the
[16:56] things of God to help us not Not to
[16:59] cause us they want to cause us not to be
[17:00] able to tap in to that flow of the
[17:04] spirit of God to be able to hear his
[17:07] voice it happens God God moves in such a
[17:09] simple way Saints we won't even it's
[17:12] like if God don't help us to catch it
[17:14] we'll miss it cuz he's so
[17:17] simple and he moves within natural
[17:21] things in the day of the Judgment who's
[17:23] going to judge the
[17:25] world it's going to be the Saints yeah
[17:28] yes right natural people common people
[17:32] you and I with common simple voices that
[17:35] people come across all the time right
[17:38] but in that day of judgment they going
[17:39] to be surprised to see us standing with
[17:42] our
[17:43] Lord and they're going to be judged
[17:45] based off of how they responded to you
[17:48] and I you understand that
[17:51] yes but all that stage is being set
[17:54] right
[17:55] now every anointed sermon you understand
[17:58] what I'm saying every day that we go out
[18:00] into the world and the world crosses our
[18:03] paths there are things that God moves
[18:05] you to say and sometimes it's just your
[18:07] life being lived it's preaching it's
[18:10] saying something it's uttering forth the
[18:12] voice of God and in that day of judgment
[18:15] people are going to come up and they're
[18:17] going to be without excuse because they
[18:20] would have came in contact with God in a
[18:22] Veil
[18:23] form and you understand what I'm saying
[18:26] only by the grace of God can somebody
[18:28] see beyond that
[18:30] Veil many rejected Christ and the day
[18:33] that he was on the earth and he was
[18:34] fully God in flesh that's right many
[18:37] people bumped up against him in the
[18:39] marketplaces right and didn't even
[18:43] realize who he
[18:45] was and this is the bride coming of
[18:48] Christ he's here right
[18:51] now am
[18:55] veiled secret
[18:57] things
[18:58] David he had a desire he really wanted
[19:01] to live close to God but he he he he was
[19:03] a man he felt he knew his passions he
[19:06] knew his weaknesses you can see it all
[19:08] in the Psalms he's pouring his heart out
[19:11] amen and I love I mean but David was
[19:14] very real with
[19:17] himself right he had some blind moments
[19:20] like he did with bash Sheba right but
[19:22] that's when demons get upon people
[19:24] that'll blind a person's mind to make
[19:27] them not realize and see things in the
[19:29] right
[19:30] reality he just got caught up in a
[19:33] moment of passion that demon had taken
[19:35] control of him and he even had a man
[19:38] killed to try to hide his
[19:44] sin when you got to hide
[19:49] anything you ain't got to ask nobody if
[19:51] it's wrong that's
[19:54] right if you got to hide it that mean
[19:56] it's wrong that's right
[20:00] and we all the Lord brings us through
[20:02] all these places to navigate our lives
[20:05] and all the cuz you know he he's combing
[20:07] through our lives because we're going to
[20:09] be right where we need to be in the
[20:11] exact form that we need to be
[20:13] in God will not fail his word will come
[20:16] to pass so because we have a high
[20:18] calling like we do God can't let us get
[20:21] by with
[20:22] nothing absolutely
[20:25] nothing because of who we are we are
[20:27] part of him we are part we are his wife
[20:30] we are the very word
[20:33] itself you were born with that seed of
[20:35] God inside of you and God comes to meet
[20:38] that to activate that to release the
[20:40] life in that seed just like a normal g a
[20:44] gardening out in the
[20:45] field he lays the seed there and he
[20:48] comes and he takes care of the ground
[20:50] around it to create the atmosphere so
[20:53] that that life can be released amen
[20:56] that's what you and I have been
[20:57] experiencing
[20:58] MH but because of that see God is he's
[21:02] light and in him is no Darkness at all
[21:04] amen amen so even though we were born in
[21:07] sin shaped in iniquity right that seed
[21:10] once that life is released God begins to
[21:12] come to you and I and the Bible calls it
[21:14] the circumcision made without
[21:17] hands what does that mean he's
[21:19] circumcising he's cutting away those
[21:22] things that are not supposed to be there
[21:25] yes amen even when you begin your walk
[21:28] with God and you actually begin to show
[21:31] signs of life meaning you see that he's
[21:33] moving the Bible says when that tree
[21:35] begins to bear fruit now that Gardener
[21:37] will come in and he'll Purge it that it
[21:40] might bring forth more fruit because
[21:43] there are things that are still there
[21:45] that's hindering the full blooming the
[21:48] the the full ripening of that fruit
[21:50] that's in your life those those leaves
[21:52] and those branches that get into the way
[21:54] of the sunlight that's trying to shine
[21:56] down into our life to bring everything
[21:59] out to way to to the way that God
[22:01] intended for it to be then God will come
[22:04] in by the Holy Spirit and he'll begin to
[22:06] bring a word to cut away all those
[22:09] things that's blocking or hindering the
[22:11] full the full shining on of his light of
[22:14] his life right so in the process of that
[22:18] that purging it brings us to this
[22:20] because secret things Paul David said
[22:23] Lord cleanse me from Secret
[22:26] faults if you have anything Secret in
[22:29] your life right
[22:35] now you already
[22:38] know you already know what you need to
[22:43] do don't let it just go
[22:45] free don't let that devil have his
[22:49] way God did all that he
[22:51] did so that we can be free
[22:56] amen
[23:01] so be honest with yourself don't play
[23:04] don't play with
[23:06] it you understand what I'm
[23:09] saying cuz if if we're the bride of
[23:11] Christ this is where our heart
[23:14] is Lord I don't want nothing in my life
[23:17] I don't want no hindering we pray that
[23:20] prayer right Lord come and move in my
[23:22] life Lord I want you to feel my life
[23:25] that's right but then the devil can just
[23:26] bring these little Earthly carnal
[23:29] insignificant when you really look at it
[23:34] how none of it benefits
[23:38] us temporarily some kind of little
[23:40] fleshly appeasement or satisfaction or
[23:43] whatever but what has it done for you
[23:45] but hold you back Paul was speaking to
[23:48] the bride of Christ in his day and he
[23:50] told them let us lay aside every weight
[23:53] and the sin that so easily does what he
[23:56] said beset us
[23:58] that we might run more freely yes when
[24:02] you ain't got no weights on you man you
[24:03] can take off that's right you got those
[24:07] weighted vests you know I had a friend
[24:09] of mine man he tried to kill me but it
[24:12] was in a good way we were exercising
[24:14] together and he had that weighted vest
[24:16] and then he let me use we were going up
[24:18] a man I about hund and something
[24:22] stairs and we were up and down we you
[24:25] know I guess the number of stairs at the
[24:27] end of every everything man I I I I
[24:29] guess it was like 2000 and
[24:32] something it was
[24:34] tough but how much more freely and easy
[24:38] it would have been if I didn't have that
[24:39] vest
[24:40] on I probably could have did three 4,000
[24:43] could have doubled it but when you got
[24:45] that weight on you you can't move but so
[24:48] fast you feel it it begins to Bear you
[24:52] down so Paul is saying that's what sins
[24:55] and stuff do for us it weighs us
[24:59] down you know in some places it
[25:01] immobilizes you it paralyzes
[25:05] you so aen he was told by God he
[25:10] understood that's why he did it like he
[25:13] did people that have secret faults in
[25:16] their lives they know what they know
[25:17] it's wrong you can't do that and be a
[25:20] child of God and not feel that
[25:25] uneasiness I never gave you my title
[25:29] the title is
[25:30] coordination amen amen coordination and
[25:34] my subtopic is
[25:36] connected
[25:37] amen when you allow yourself to deal
[25:40] with secret sin in your life when you
[25:43] allow it to be there you're not just
[25:45] affecting
[25:48] yourself this is my main
[25:50] point you're not just affecting yourself
[25:53] it might feel the that devil will make
[25:55] you feel as though in that moment that
[25:57] you can just just you know for whatever
[25:59] it might be you know you can just give
[26:01] in to me and we can just have our time
[26:03] or whatever it'll just be you ain't hurt
[26:04] nobody else but you
[26:07] are in that moment in that secret moment
[26:10] when you're yielding yourself over to an
[26:12] evil spirit you're not you affecting
[26:16] yourself but you're not just affecting
[26:21] yourself aen did not realize that he was
[26:25] connected that's right yes to the whole
[26:28] group of
[26:30] Israel but notice how it says in verse
[26:32] one it says but the children of Israel
[26:35] committed a
[26:37] trespass but it was only
[26:40] aching but God accounted it to the whole
[26:46] group do we see
[26:49] that the children of Israel he said
[26:52] committed a trespass in the accursed
[26:54] thing then it says for aen the son of
[26:56] Camry took up the accursed thing and the
[26:59] anger of the Lord notice now was kindled
[27:02] against
[27:05] who now I want to I'm not going to read
[27:07] all of this verba but I want you to
[27:09] understand something there was a group
[27:11] called AI that they were supposed to go
[27:13] and fight against God had made them a
[27:15] promisees that no man will be able to
[27:17] stand before you all the days of your
[27:20] life Joshua knew that he believed God he
[27:23] knew that God was a god of his
[27:25] word so he went out to do exactly what
[27:28] God was said to do and he expected God
[27:30] to move in the way that God said he
[27:33] would move cuz he knew that God couldn't
[27:35] lie but now they're going out and now
[27:38] they're going to assess the situation
[27:40] Joshua say I need for a few men to go
[27:42] out and assess the situation for me and
[27:44] let me know what we need to do to be
[27:45] able to take this land they went out
[27:48] they looked over the land or whatever
[27:50] and the men said they came back and say
[27:51] you know we don't even need
[27:54] everybody we we will be able to take
[27:56] care of them with a few few men so they
[27:58] narrowed it down to a few
[28:03] thousand then they went up against them
[28:05] in their minds cuz listen they didn't
[28:07] know what aan had done in
[28:11] secret listen to the
[28:15] Saints aan knew that he wasn't supposed
[28:17] to have that garment that gold or that
[28:21] silver but in that moment when he was in
[28:25] a place maybe it was a lot of things
[28:27] going on everybody moving around or
[28:29] whatever and that devil just was able to
[28:31] catch his
[28:33] attention I say look aan look at that
[28:36] garment isn't that nice look at the
[28:38] material look at the colors you ain't
[28:41] seen nothing like that
[28:43] before you know he say look at the Gold
[28:45] you know how much you know how much
[28:46] money that's worth the value in that
[28:49] gold and that silver so in ain's mind
[28:51] all about
[28:54] himself just like right now each one of
[28:56] us have a mind mind and nobody knows
[28:58] what's going on in other in each other's
[29:00] mind but God
[29:01] does but this is what was going on now
[29:04] he begins to be sold this product of the
[29:07] devil he said why don't you just go I
[29:09] understand God said but look and now
[29:11] he's trying to make him not even think
[29:12] about God's word in the right way have
[29:14] no fear of the
[29:18] Lord the Bible says the fear of the Lord
[29:21] is the beginning of wisdom that's right
[29:23] it helps to guide you it helps to it
[29:26] helps to to kind of guide your
[29:28] day-to-day steps when you can be mindful
[29:31] of him but aan is having this mind
[29:33] battle
[29:34] now he he can't he can't be free with it
[29:37] cuz anything that's right you can just
[29:39] do it
[29:40] openly if there's an apple here you know
[29:44] and and it's for everybody you can go
[29:45] grab a apple and just start eating in
[29:47] front of everybody you ain't got to go
[29:48] in a corner and H unless it ain't your
[29:50] apples and then now you you took
[29:52] somebody else Apple then you go in the
[29:54] room and close the door and try to eat
[29:55] it and throw the little Coral away
[29:57] somewhere wrap it up in the when
[30:00] something ain't right you got to move
[30:02] like
[30:03] that cover your steps make sure nobody
[30:06] got no signs or no evidences of what
[30:08] you've
[30:14] done and those things exist amongst
[30:17] God's
[30:20] people and that's the kind of
[30:23] slavery that the enemy tries to cause us
[30:26] to
[30:28] to be caught up into you become a slave
[30:30] to these secret
[30:32] things so he was he was ushering aen
[30:36] into a
[30:37] slavery and he sold them on it and aen
[30:40] was like well nobody ain't
[30:43] looking gathered it up probably wrapped
[30:45] it up real good somehow then he went he
[30:48] he went to his
[30:50] tent you know kind of like tried to hold
[30:52] it in an unassuming way you know the
[30:55] devil tried to make you real slick with
[30:56] it right you know what I mean you cover
[30:59] all your steps you try you try to appear
[31:03] normal praise the
[31:06] Lord but on the inside is something else
[31:08] going on so he gets to his tent he takes
[31:12] it and he finds a spot and he goes and
[31:14] he hides
[31:17] it and every
[31:19] movement everything he just
[31:22] did it began to send a ripple
[31:25] effect through the whole
[31:29] Camp so now that was done he was
[31:33] satisfied because he took it he he he
[31:35] was satisfying his
[31:38] lust you see so now that was done so now
[31:41] he's going to go back out like normally
[31:43] like he going to go out and try to be
[31:45] amongst the group yeah let's go get him
[31:46] let's go get
[31:48] him so now they go out to fight and now
[31:51] all of a sudden they begin to be
[31:54] beat now the men of AI begin to drive
[31:57] back Israel and thousands of men
[32:02] died why did they die
[32:05] Saints Joshua said hold on hold on hold
[32:08] on something's wrong God what's
[32:10] happening here you said you gave us the
[32:13] victory you said you gave us the land
[32:15] you said no man will be able to stand
[32:17] before us so Joshua is confused and
[32:19] going through the anguish of what just
[32:21] happened
[32:23] why because of one person's secret sin
[32:26] amen
[32:32] right he called Everything to a hope he
[32:35] went out and he began to fast and pray
[32:38] Lord what's happening here why do we
[32:40] have men die Lord he he he got to deal
[32:44] with the
[32:45] families the wives the children that's
[32:47] left behind now because their daddy
[32:49] ain't there no more why did that
[32:51] happened
[32:52] Saints because of one man's secret
[32:56] sin
[32:57] watch
[32:59] this it says in verse 5 it says and the
[33:02] men of AI smot of them about 30 and six
[33:05] men I'm sorry 36 men it says for they
[33:07] chased them from before the gate even
[33:10] unto sharum and smok them in the in the
[33:13] going down wherefore the hearts of the
[33:15] people melted and became as water so it
[33:18] wasn't thousands it was 36 it says it
[33:20] says and Joshua rent his clothes and
[33:22] fell to the Earth upon his face before
[33:25] the Ark of the Lord until the even tide
[33:27] he and the Elders of Israel and put dust
[33:30] on their head and Joshua said alas oh
[33:33] Lord God wherefore hast thou at all
[33:35] brought brought this people now now now
[33:38] it's changing Joshua's mind God I know
[33:40] what you said but look at what just
[33:43] happened that's not according to your
[33:45] word but he didn't
[33:49] know Saint Saints this is going to go
[33:52] pretty deep
[33:55] here you you got 36 corpses out
[34:01] there you got a leader that's
[34:05] confused cuz he know that he's teaching
[34:07] them right he's being the best leader he
[34:09] can
[34:11] be but he didn't know it was somebody in
[34:13] his
[34:15] church that was giving themselves over
[34:17] to
[34:20] something that was causing spiritual
[34:25] death listen
[34:27] achen was still
[34:29] alive he's the one that
[34:32] sinned he was still
[34:35] alive 36 men went went from this life to
[34:39] the to the next
[34:40] life and the man that did it was still
[34:45] alive and he knew what he had done but
[34:49] he was holding
[34:52] it watch how God deals with their
[34:55] Saints
[34:57] and Joshua said alas oh Lord God
[34:59] wherefore has thou at all brought this
[35:01] people over Jordan to deliver us into
[35:03] the hand of the amorites to destroy us
[35:06] he's questioning
[35:08] God that secret sin of one man caused
[35:11] the leader to question
[35:13] God he says would to God we have been
[35:16] content and dwelt on the other side
[35:19] Jordan oh Lord what shall I say when
[35:22] Israel turn turneth their backs before
[35:24] their enemies because that was going to
[35:26] to affect every other
[35:28] battle they lost heart then they lost
[35:32] confidence they want they weren't on to
[35:34] winning streak no
[35:36] more so that was going to make it
[35:39] difficult for them to be able to face
[35:40] the enemy because now they wouldn't be
[35:41] able to have the same
[35:45] expectations Lord have
[35:49] mercy oh Lord what shall I say when when
[35:52] Israel turth their backs before their
[35:54] enemies for the Canaanites and all the
[35:56] inhabitants of of the land shall hear of
[35:58] it and shall invi and shall Environ us
[36:01] round and cut off our name before from
[36:04] the earth and what Willl thou do unto
[36:06] thy great name and watch how God
[36:08] responds he says and the Lord said unto
[36:10] Joshua get thee
[36:15] up wherefore liest thou he says thus
[36:18] upon thy face you know what I said you
[36:21] know the word I gave I specifically said
[36:24] don't you take of the accursed thing
[36:27] so you know I can't fail on my promise
[36:29] Joshua so it had to be a failure
[36:32] somewhere in the
[36:34] camp God knew it but listen now please
[36:39] don't lose sight that they were all
[36:42] connected every member of Israel was
[36:46] connected
[36:48] amen ain's
[36:51] failure it affected the whole group and
[36:54] God is holding the whole group
[36:56] accountable
[36:59] able you understand
[37:02] that God is holding a whole group
[37:05] accountable for one man's action and
[37:08] they didn't have nothing to do with it
[37:10] they didn't even know it took
[37:15] place and notice how God talks in verse
[37:18] 11 Israel have
[37:21] sinned you see
[37:23] it Israel have sinned
[37:29] oh
[37:34] my and they have also transgressed my
[37:37] Covenant who he said
[37:40] they you see
[37:43] that he says and transgressed my
[37:45] Covenant which I commanded them for they
[37:49] have even taken of the accursed thing
[37:52] and have also stolen and disassembled
[37:55] and all also Al so and they have put it
[37:58] even among he says
[38:05] there who wants to be responsible for
[38:07] somebody else's actions like
[38:12] that who wants to be held accountable
[38:14] for something that you can't even
[38:19] control but that's how God
[38:21] set that's how God set it up and I'm
[38:25] going to bring it to the present day
[38:26] because that that's how it's set up
[38:28] amongst you and I right
[38:34] now let me keep with
[38:38] this therefore the children of Israel
[38:41] could not stand before their enemies but
[38:43] but turn their backs before their
[38:44] enemies because they were a curse
[38:46] neither will I be with you
[38:50] anymore my anointing is not going to be
[38:52] there my helping hand is not going to be
[38:54] among you the whole group had the spirit
[38:58] of God withdrawn from
[39:01] them Lord have
[39:05] mercy
[39:06] why because of one man's
[39:12] lust was it worth
[39:15] it was the stealing of those few items
[39:18] the transgressing of God's word was it
[39:21] worth
[39:25] it he says will be he says neither will
[39:28] I be with you anymore except ye destroy
[39:31] the our curse from among
[39:35] you so then Joshua he says
[39:39] okay and now the spirit of God is there
[39:42] upon Joshua still because now the now
[39:45] discernment is beginning to
[39:47] move so Joshua had all the tribes to
[39:50] come and the spirit of the Lord had him
[39:53] narrow it down through a particular
[39:55] tribe and then then God had had him
[39:57] narrow it down to a particular
[39:59] family and then God had him narrow it
[40:02] down now now each person of the family
[40:04] begin to come by and then when it got to
[40:11] aen verse 20 says and aen I'm sorry
[40:15] verse 19 and Joshua I'm sorry let's go
[40:17] Verse 18 says and he brought his
[40:22] household let's go to verse
[40:24] 16 it says so Joshua rose up early in
[40:27] the morning and brought Israel by their
[40:29] tribe and the tribe uh and a tribe of
[40:32] Judah was taken and he brought the
[40:34] family of Judah and he took up the
[40:36] family of zah zarit of the zarit and and
[40:39] brought the family of the Zar heits Man
[40:42] by man and zabdi was taken now he's
[40:44] narrowing it down and the spirit of the
[40:46] Lord is moving very keenly now right
[40:50] verse 18 and he brought his household
[40:52] Man by man and aen the son of Camry the
[40:55] son of uh zabdi the son of Zara of the
[40:58] tribe of Judah was taken and Joshua then
[41:01] now now now now now he can't he can't
[41:03] hide if he wanted
[41:06] to Joshua you can imagine how ain's
[41:08] heart is feeling it's about to beat out
[41:10] of his
[41:11] chest cuz for one he was in that
[41:14] presence
[41:16] now just like in the New Testament you
[41:19] know with with with
[41:21] Peter and the husband and the
[41:23] wife once they came in and and into that
[41:27] presence something happened and they
[41:30] lost their lives cuz God was showing I
[41:33] ain't playing no
[41:34] games he was going to make sure that
[41:36] church started off right so when they
[41:39] had that secret sin amongst them and
[41:41] they didn't even have to do it but Satan
[41:44] sold them on the fact you can keep a
[41:46] little more money back you ain't got to
[41:48] give everything and it cost them their
[41:50] lives because of
[41:55] ties paying in their part amongst the
[41:58] church and the devil was able to trick
[42:01] them to make them think they were
[42:02] getting by and they lost their lives but
[42:05] but now aan is standing there and in
[42:07] verse 20 and um I'm sorry verse 19 and
[42:10] Joshua said unto aan my son give I pray
[42:12] thee glory to God uh glory to the god of
[42:15] Israel and make confession unto him and
[42:18] tell me now what thou has done hide it
[42:21] not from me and aan answered Joshua and
[42:24] said indeed I have sinned against the
[42:26] Lord God of Israel and thus and thus
[42:28] have I done when I saw among the spoils
[42:31] a goodly Babylonia garment and 200
[42:34] sheckles of silver and a wedge of gold
[42:36] of 50 shekel weight then I coveted them
[42:39] and took them it says and behold they
[42:42] are HID in the earth he buried it under
[42:44] the Earth in the ground he says in the
[42:46] midst of my tent and the silver under
[42:50] it so they go in they find these items
[42:54] they bring them out and in verse 20 2
[42:56] says and Joshua said why H has thou
[42:58] troubled
[43:01] Israel he says the Lord shall trouble
[43:04] thee this
[43:06] day and they stoned
[43:11] him it says here and all Israel stoned
[43:14] him with stones and burned them with
[43:18] fire he wasn't the only one that
[43:23] died he calls other people that what the
[43:26] partaker of his sin and didn't even know
[43:28] nothing about it not only the 36 men but
[43:31] there was others that was there with him
[43:33] that died as a result of what he
[43:36] did isn't that
[43:41] something so you and I we're
[43:47] connected we're connected in a very
[43:50] close manner more than what you realize
[43:53] the decisions you make it don't just
[43:55] affect you
[43:56] good or bad you can make good decisions
[43:59] you can choose to serve the Lord give
[44:01] your life to God uh uh fight against him
[44:04] you know the Bible say withstand the
[44:05] enemy and he'll flee from you right you
[44:08] can fight that good fight of Faith you
[44:09] can labor you can you can pray through
[44:12] you can fast you can you can fight and
[44:14] God will give you Victory and that in
[44:16] turn actually CA
[44:19] blessings and and and and and and just
[44:21] things that that's that's necessary and
[44:23] needed amongst those that are connected
[44:25] to you that you'll become an a a conduit
[44:29] you'll become an open Avenue for the
[44:30] blessings of God to flow through to your
[44:32] family to your loved ones by you being
[44:36] in your position somebody might have a
[44:38] need to be prayed for and now God can
[44:40] use you work through you to lay your
[44:42] hands on somebody and they be
[44:45] healed they they they they they begin to
[44:47] reap the benefits of your close walk
[44:49] with God isn't that what happened on
[44:52] Pentecost right they they gave
[44:54] themselves to God and they were filled
[44:56] with the spirit of God and look how many
[44:58] people benefited amen from the people
[45:01] giving themselves over to the right
[45:06] things Peter didn't know that that man
[45:08] that was laying at that gate was
[45:11] connected to him glory to God huh amen
[45:17] and and as he gave himself to God now
[45:19] that man was able to receive his healing
[45:22] that was already ordained of God to
[45:24] happen but had Peter not been in his
[45:27] position had he been elsewhere in his
[45:29] spirit and in his mind that man would
[45:31] have still been crippled but because of
[45:34] the obedience and the humility that
[45:36] Peter entered into through the baptism
[45:38] of the Holy Ghost he was able to be a
[45:40] blessing and not only that the Bible
[45:43] says that as Peter walked by people laid
[45:46] in Peter's
[45:47] Shadow and were
[45:50] healed he was connected to every one of
[45:52] those lives God already knew who would
[45:54] be healed by Peter
[45:56] Shadow you understand what I'm saying so
[45:59] it works both ways so now coordination
[46:02] that's my title coordination means the
[46:05] process of organizing people or groups
[46:08] so that they can work together properly
[46:10] and
[46:11] well it says the harmonious functioning
[46:14] of parts for Effective
[46:19] results God didn't put us here for no
[46:22] reason there's an eternal purpose that's
[46:25] within each one of Our Lives amen and
[46:28] God God wants that individual purpose in
[46:30] each one of our Lives to come to its
[46:32] full potential and be
[46:35] effective Amen to serve the purpose that
[46:38] God put it here for to be able to be a
[46:41] blessing to the entire body so that the
[46:43] body can be well and be whole and be
[46:46] able to move forward according to what
[46:48] God had in his
[46:50] mind every one of us have a daily part
[46:53] to play Within that
[46:56] right now every one of us in our
[46:58] decision making we play a part in the
[47:01] functioning and the moving forward of
[47:02] the body of
[47:04] God the holy spirit is here
[47:07] coordinating all of us come from
[47:09] different walks of life different
[47:11] backgrounds we're each dealing with
[47:13] different things in different areas of
[47:14] our lives and the Mighty God is amongst
[47:17] all of us working Among Us healing us
[47:20] delivering us bringing us to our
[47:22] rightful positions that he ordained for
[47:24] us and the closer that we each get to
[47:27] him we begin to see an enhancing of the
[47:30] atmospheres and
[47:32] everything it's a different atmosphere
[47:35] in your
[47:37] home the more we humble ourselves
[47:40] husbands and wives praying giving
[47:43] ourselves to God you can't tell me you
[47:45] don't feel the sweetness of that
[47:48] atmosphere glory to God you can't tell
[47:50] me you don't feel the power of that
[47:52] Spirit it moves across your heart
[47:57] sometimes it just brings you to
[48:00] tears here recently I just been in a
[48:02] whole different place man I wake up and
[48:05] I want to
[48:06] pray and I I ain't I'm not I'm I'm I'm
[48:10] not trying to put myself on the pedestal
[48:12] because I'm not by far I'm just saying
[48:14] I'm just I'm just kind of sharing with
[48:16] you
[48:17] amen I have a death sentence in my life
[48:22] all I want to do is die
[48:24] amen
[48:27] I want to die for
[48:30] you
[48:32] amen but Le Brandon said living He said
[48:35] eternal life is living your life for
[48:37] others
[48:42] amen I'm talking about coordination and
[48:46] connection living your life for others I
[48:48] ain't talking about doing good
[48:51] deeds I give you a ride brother on your
[48:54] tire flat I come change your tire
[48:57] out what's the point of me coming to
[48:59] help you change your tire out and then
[49:01] go and do a secret
[49:02] sin
[49:04] amen I'm not living for you I did a good
[49:07] deed I can feel I help the brother out
[49:09] today I helped the sister out sister you
[49:11] need some money for
[49:12] grocery I give you some money for
[49:15] grocery and man I said oh praise God
[49:18] brother you didn't know I needed we have
[49:20] no
[49:22] food but then you go and do a secret s
[49:26] mhm you tell me what what benefit was
[49:30] the giving of a grocery now that might
[49:32] have satisfied a natural need but you're
[49:35] hurting that sister
[49:38] more you ain't living for I'm living for
[49:41] brother look I was there for when she
[49:43] needed me Lord let me be the one to be
[49:45] used but yet at the same time
[49:47] spiritually speaking you're doing things
[49:49] that's hindering her in some way form of
[49:54] fashion Paul said do I give my body to
[49:57] be
[49:58] burned do I got faith to move
[50:01] mountains do I got all wisdom I got
[50:04] Revelation you know I I I feed the poor
[50:07] and all he said though I do all of that
[50:09] but if I have not
[50:10] charity he said it don't profit me
[50:13] nothing charity is love charity is God
[50:17] himself the holy ghost tabernacling in
[50:20] your body having me
[50:22] preeminence you understand what I'm
[50:24] saying the love of God living inside of
[50:26] you causing you to become the Living
[50:31] Word character
[50:34] Behavior righteousness not your own
[50:38] righteousness but the righteousness that
[50:40] exceeds that of the
[50:41] phes not by our willpower but by the
[50:44] power of the Holy Ghost Christ in you
[50:47] living his life through you amen you
[50:51] understand what I'm saying and it's so
[50:54] simple that's why people are missing the
[50:56] third pull everything is so simple it's
[50:59] just Christ having a preeminence inside
[51:02] of an ordained
[51:03] soul and when he chooses to show
[51:06] himself he has a vessel that's died and
[51:10] has loves him enough to where he can
[51:12] just move through at any given
[51:15] time that's the life of Christ amen you
[51:20] understand and the Bible says he's the
[51:22] first born among many
[51:24] brethren
[51:27] oh
[51:28] man this thing goes so far Saints pray
[51:32] for brother MCB what time is it I'm
[51:35] not I'm probably have to pick this up at
[51:38] the latter service I didn't know how it
[51:40] was going to
[51:42] go all
[51:44] right so let's touch on this part
[51:48] here cuz that was the Old Testament
[51:51] right but let me share with you
[51:53] something here uh
[51:56] just to kind of connect it along with
[51:59] that the message of
[52:02] adoption
[52:04] 1960 this is May the
[52:08] 15th and it's adoption number one notice
[52:12] what the prophet says here this is the
[52:14] New Testament now meaning after
[52:17] Calvary right the Holy Ghost given and
[52:19] all of that just to show you that God is
[52:21] the
[52:23] same he says here there's where the
[52:26] church is failing today he says on that
[52:29] walk do you know that even your own
[52:32] behavior listen now can knock somebody
[52:35] else out of getting
[52:38] healed
[52:41] amen I got a few examples here that just
[52:46] really to be honest it brought me to
[52:49] tears just to even consider the fact
[52:52] that Lord I can actually be used to
[52:54] hinder somebody
[52:56] from being
[52:58] healed notice how he said that your
[53:00] behavior your
[53:05] thoughts can knock somebody else out of
[53:07] getting healed your misbehavior of
[53:09] unconfessed Sins Of You
[53:12] Believers not Sinners but
[53:15] Believers he's bringing the bride body
[53:17] to a Perfection he's bringing us up to
[53:20] that Capstone Saints he says your your
[53:23] unconfessed sins if you believe can
[53:25] cause listen now remember he told Israel
[53:28] all Israel had Israel
[53:31] sinned I'm not going to be amongst
[53:33] Israel no more right watch how he says
[53:37] this he says you your misbehavior of
[53:40] unconf of you Believers can cause this
[53:43] church to bitterly
[53:47] fail one man's actions one woman's
[53:50] actions secret
[53:52] sin and the church itself you you're not
[53:55] seeing it move forward you you the
[53:57] atmosphere is not quite
[54:01] right and one individual could be the
[54:04] cause of that entire
[54:08] thing we actually have a
[54:11] responsibility to one
[54:16] another more than what we
[54:23] realized and the day of judgment he says
[54:26] you'll be responsible for every bit of
[54:29] it oh you say now wait a minute brother
[54:32] brandham well that's the truth think of
[54:34] it he says and they said and they slayed
[54:36] the amorites and the Hittites but there
[54:39] wasn't one herd among any of them until
[54:41] sin come in the camp and when achen took
[54:44] that Babylonian garment and that gold
[54:47] wedge and hid it under under his Camp he
[54:49] says then the next day they lost 16 we
[54:53] know it was 36 it says Joshua was say
[54:55] stop stop wait a minute there's
[54:57] something wrong something's something
[54:59] something's wrong here we're we're we're
[55:01] going to call seven days of fast God
[55:04] made us a promise there would be nothing
[55:06] hurt us our enemies will fall at our
[55:08] feet and there's something wrong here
[55:11] something went wrong somewhere cuz we
[55:13] got 16 dead many uh uh men laying here
[55:17] their Israelite brothers and they're
[55:19] dead why did they die innocent men
[55:23] because one man stepped out of line you
[55:25] see the reason this needs to be taught
[55:27] the church lining up listen the church
[55:30] lining up with the word of God lining up
[55:33] with God and lining up with each
[55:40] other lining up with each
[55:43] other I never considered this in this
[55:46] way until the Lord dealt with my heart
[55:47] on
[55:49] this so I have a responsibility to you
[55:53] when you talk about living your life for
[55:54] other brothers that's me not allowing
[55:57] the Devil to have any room in my
[55:59] life right because I know it can affect
[56:03] you in a great
[56:05] way the ministry brother Jesse all of us
[56:08] we have that
[56:10] responsibility right but now we're
[56:12] seeing it's not just us but it's
[56:15] everybody you actually contribute to the
[56:18] success of the
[56:22] church pay your ties all of that that's
[56:26] fine but the biggest contribution is you
[56:29] can give your life amen yes amen watch
[56:33] it's a scripture I'mma go over I'm I'mma
[56:34] come down to a close here all right
[56:37] because I'm not even nowhere near
[56:40] it he says the church lining up lining
[56:43] up with the word of God lining up with
[56:45] God and lining up with each other
[56:47] walking perfectly upright soberly before
[56:50] all men he says fearing God because one
[56:53] man stole a gar G and done something
[56:56] that he should not have done took the
[56:58] life of 16 men he say I think it was 16
[57:01] maybe more he says I believe it was 16
[57:03] men that was dead Joshua said there's
[57:06] something wrong God made the promise and
[57:08] something's wrong when we bring the
[57:10] listen to the Saints he says when we
[57:13] bring the sick up before us and they
[57:16] fail to be
[57:18] healed he says we need to call a solemn
[57:22] fast call an assembly something's WR
[57:24] wrong somewhere God made the promise
[57:27] God's got to stick to that promise and
[57:30] he will do
[57:32] it now I know there are other things
[57:34] that factor into that so and I just want
[57:37] to say this for conscience sake there
[57:39] are times in which God is working
[57:41] something out in in an individual's life
[57:45] and if the prayer is not answered is not
[57:47] always due to a secret sin lying amongst
[57:50] the people it's just that what God
[57:52] intended to achieve in that person's
[57:54] life life through this Affliction it
[57:56] hadn't been achieved yet a good example
[58:00] is
[58:00] Paul he had an issue with his eyes he
[58:04] prayed to God three times isn't that
[58:06] right yes and God did not come and heal
[58:09] him but God G gave him he told him why
[58:12] he says through this Affliction you have
[58:14] it's causing you to actually be to be
[58:17] used in the way that you're being used
[58:19] for the kingdom of
[58:21] God huh and when God revealed him that
[58:25] it was a reason why that had to be there
[58:27] then he said I glory and my infirmities
[58:29] then because when I'm weak then am I
[58:32] strong he said the power of Christ now
[58:34] can rest on
[58:36] me and because he was solely dependent
[58:38] on God because he was receiving so much
[58:40] Revelation until he could have easily
[58:42] gotten puffed up and gotten the big
[58:45] head you know so God said now to keep
[58:48] you from getting the big head I'm going
[58:49] let this messenger of Satan Buffet you
[58:51] in your eyes and keep you low
[58:55] right so that that mixture is there too
[58:57] but I just want us to be aware of this
[59:00] part right so that we can check up so
[59:04] that we can understand the
[59:05] responsibility that we have to one
[59:07] another amen can we say praise the Lord
[59:12] Saints he says here my oh
[59:15] my I'm I'mma start with this one right
[59:18] here and then we'll pick up from this on
[59:19] the second
[59:21] Service
[59:23] Coordination working together God taking
[59:27] a group of people that didn't have no
[59:29] connection meaning they don't we didn't
[59:31] know one another right then God brings
[59:33] us together under the under the umbrella
[59:35] of his word and his Spirit right amen so
[59:38] now he begins to work with us in our
[59:39] individual lives to bring us to that
[59:42] place to where we can be
[59:45] useful in the body of Christ right and
[59:48] that work is still in progress we're all
[59:50] still a work in progress but it's moving
[59:53] right now I know it is
[59:55] right we're not a bunch of sinners in
[59:56] here and what have you but we are people
[59:58] right and we have things that we're
[1:00:00] still
[1:00:00] overcoming right even after Israel came
[1:00:04] into the promised land and had possessed
[1:00:05] a lot of land Joshua came up at a
[1:00:07] certain point he said there's still very
[1:00:09] much land to be possessed we ain't done
[1:00:11] yet right we ain't done yet Saints God
[1:00:14] is still moving there are still things
[1:00:16] in our lives need to be
[1:00:18] uprooted amen right so that the clear
[1:00:20] flowing of the spirit of God can come in
[1:00:22] and feel those void amen and we can
[1:00:24] become full of the Holy
[1:00:26] Ghost and now man it's I mean it's
[1:00:28] unlimited what God will do Among Us you
[1:00:31] understand the need for
[1:00:33] this when we understand our
[1:00:35] responsibility and our accountability to
[1:00:37] one another and then we all we all in
[1:00:39] unison together as they did in in the
[1:00:41] upper room they were up there and they
[1:00:44] they they they all came to that same
[1:00:45] Focus their focus became on God Amen and
[1:00:49] they they were they were ready to lay it
[1:00:50] all out and then it came down that
[1:00:53] promise came down in the room was filled
[1:00:55] and they all became filled with the Holy
[1:00:56] Ghost and look what happened after that
[1:00:58] point there's more that God want to do
[1:01:01] Among Us
[1:01:02] Saints watch this now
[1:01:05] now outside of the the Dome of our own
[1:01:08] lives there's a bigger picture there's a
[1:01:12] church world that's being moved by evil
[1:01:14] spirits 200,000,000 Horsemen that was
[1:01:17] loosed at the river
[1:01:18] Euphrates they're moving brother Brandon
[1:01:20] said in the ecclesiastical realm there's
[1:01:23] going to be a c Coalition there's going
[1:01:25] to be a a un a false Unity of those
[1:01:28] churches and they're going to be a
[1:01:29] boycott and they're going to try to
[1:01:31] clamp down on the people of God and we
[1:01:33] are that people you understand what I'm
[1:01:35] saying so there's going to have we going
[1:01:37] to have to be in a real place with God
[1:01:39] because we won't be able to gather like
[1:01:41] this for long that's been said for years
[1:01:43] and we're closer to that now than what
[1:01:45] we ever were before you understand so
[1:01:47] the holy spirit is moving to bring all
[1:01:49] of us to our positions within the army
[1:01:52] of God Amen watch this now I'mma bring
[1:01:56] it down to this point right here this
[1:01:57] message is called humble
[1:02:00] thyself brother brandom says I was
[1:02:02] thinking and that's very serious that's
[1:02:04] not to make you afraid that's just the
[1:02:06] reality he said you watch when that
[1:02:08] squeeze comes upon the bride he says
[1:02:11] watch the third pull then now this is
[1:02:14] this is pertaining to that third pull
[1:02:16] watch what he says now what's going to
[1:02:17] bring the third pool into a full
[1:02:23] manifestation
[1:02:25] you ready for it yes
[1:02:27] amen he says I was thinking here one of
[1:02:31] uh I was thinking here of one of one
[1:02:33] little
[1:02:35] illustration to back up what we what he
[1:02:38] said he says now we look at this
[1:02:41] watch he says and find out what time it
[1:02:44] is he says unless that every instrument
[1:02:48] in that watch he says is
[1:02:52] coordinating everybody say coordinating
[1:02:56] one with the other we'll never know the
[1:02:59] correct time he says is that right he
[1:03:03] says and that takes all of
[1:03:06] us he says all together if we want to
[1:03:10] see the third pool really do something
[1:03:13] for God he says it's
[1:03:18] coordination what does coordination mean
[1:03:21] again just a refresher the process of
[1:03:24] organizing people or groups so that they
[1:03:27] work together well properly and well the
[1:03:30] the harmonious functioning of parts for
[1:03:33] Effective
[1:03:34] results so brother brandom is saying
[1:03:37] here that in order for this third pull
[1:03:40] to actually
[1:03:42] come into being watch he says if we want
[1:03:46] to see the third pole really do
[1:03:48] something for God its coordination with
[1:03:51] every one of us together to Humble our
[1:03:54] ourselves before God and confess our
[1:03:57] wrong and pray and believe God for these
[1:04:02] things it's going to take coordination
[1:04:05] he
[1:04:06] says each one of us understanding the
[1:04:09] responsibility and accountability that
[1:04:11] we have to one another amen how we can
[1:04:14] affect one
[1:04:16] another being my that's enough I don't
[1:04:19] want to hurt my
[1:04:20] brother I don't want to hurt my sister I
[1:04:23] don't want to the cause of somebody else
[1:04:25] not receiving their healing I don't want
[1:04:28] to be the cause of a church not being
[1:04:30] able to progress forward because of what
[1:04:32] I'm doing in my life I'm dampering the
[1:04:34] atmosphere of the whole
[1:04:37] church that's not my opinion I just gave
[1:04:40] you the facts of it you can go back and
[1:04:42] study
[1:04:43] it that third pull he said is hinged
[1:04:46] upon the coordination of the
[1:04:50] church that's why God is bringing us all
[1:04:53] into that place he's dealing with us
[1:04:56] he's dealing with me like I said I got a
[1:04:58] death sentence in my heart all I want to
[1:05:01] do is
[1:05:02] die I see the needs I see needs I see my
[1:05:06] own needs but I see needs I see needs
[1:05:08] among my family right I'm like Lord if
[1:05:11] my dying can cause my family to
[1:05:15] live can cause them to be delivered then
[1:05:18] Lord let me die yes let me live my life
[1:05:22] for somebody else
[1:05:26] can I give you one more scripture yes
[1:05:29] amen we
[1:05:32] okay I got to I want to share this with
[1:05:35] you
[1:05:39] man praise the
[1:05:44] Lord
[1:05:45] okay it says this is my
[1:05:49] commandment that you love one
[1:05:52] another amen
[1:05:55] glory to God he says as I have loved you
[1:05:59] amen how did he love us Saints he died
[1:06:01] for us he died listen now he said
[1:06:05] it he says oh
