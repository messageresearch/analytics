TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all their sins. They have peace with with as much as possible with every, you know, of course, we all have enemies if we're believers, you know, but with all possible, we've kept peace with everybody. We keep the love of God ruling our hearts. And so, I just felt that with brother Dale, just like I do with brother Rod and, you know, of course, Sister Beatatric and all these faithful saints, you know, that God's allowed us, Brother Jose, uh, have served God so so faithfully all these decades. And one day, if the Lord carries, I want to be one of them. Praise God. I want to be full of the love of God. Hallelujah. Now and always. Whenever whatever trials God allows to come my way, I want to overcome them by the love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Peter 1 vers12. That's a lot of read. And maybe we can get all that in sync by God's grace. Could we all be in harmony here by the Holy Spirit to read that? Let's read that on three. 1 2 3. unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, which things the angels desire to look into. If you have a need of prayer, let's make let's have one more word of prayer. If you have a need on your heart, just make it known to God. Father God, you see the needs, Lord. Lord, and you tell us in your word, the angels are sent to bring us deliverance, Lord, to minister to the needs of the heirs of salvation. I'm looking at when my eyes are open, I'm looking at your bride, your children. Lord, these are the heirs of salvation. Lord, send your angel tonight if there's a need for it. Lord, I pray you'd bless your people in Jesus Christ's name. The saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you as you're being seated. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Well, this might be my shortest sermon in a long time. This could be 30 minutes here, saints. Hallelujah. We'll see how it goes. I you know I was I told brother Chris I was planning on preaching you know going back to the God hiding himself series but uh as I sat down and studied a little more this thought just came to me so I thought I just preach on this and uh I felt inspired I never thought about that the desires of angels. Hallelujah. So let's look at this here today. Um I think everything should be familiar here uh Lord willing. Um 1 Peter chapter 1. Let's go back up to verse 10 if you got your Bible. Uh 1 Peter 1 verse 10. You know, Peter's book is often called, church, the fir the book of first Peter is often called the book about suffering. How to overcome suffering and trials and manifold temptations. And um so Peter understood what it was like to be tempted uh many times uh to measure, right? He was tempted as as hard as you could be tempted. You know, Satan himself sometimes tempted Peter. We know that Satan made him say the wrong thing to the Lord Jesus. uh but uh he went through also physical uh suffering and was crucified upside down at least according to history. Now I'm not saying that's thus sayith the Lord. Some people say he wasn't but uh it doesn't matter uh as far as in one way we know he died a martyr though all the all the accounts uh have him as a martyr. He gave his life for Jesus Christ. Amen. Sealing his faith. Now verse 10 says of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently. So Peter says all the Old Testament prophets, they sought to understand real salvation. Now think about that church, they spent their whole lives, now imagine, we don't do that, but think about that. They spent their whole lives watching animals be killed and bled all every Sabbath there, every time they gathered just animal blood, animal carcass, animals squealing, and all the blood blood. And they just wondered, "What does this mean?" They they just wondered for 4,000 years what is the purpose of all you know you read in Solomon how many thousands of cattle he offered you know they would just give thousands and it would be all day just a we'd say a blood fast just blood all day long for their feast periods as well so seven days eight days you know they'd have these feasts and so the prophets you know were wondering what is this all about all this bloodshed what is the purpose of all this and theible Ible said that they they they they diligently sought about it and then the prophets remember the prophets would catch some revelation. I think it was Micah that said God you don't delight in the blood of lambs. He said you delight in a broken and contrite heart. &gt;&gt; Right? I mean he's just even David caught that revelation that all this bloodshed it could be given animals can be given but the the worshipper could not be purged. &gt;&gt; Right? The animals could die. You could go through all the emotions but nothing would change. And church we don't want that to happen to us. We don't want to come to church and nothing changes about our lives. &gt;&gt; We should we should constantly appreciate the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and consider what he suffered and consider the power that he now gives us to overcome sin. &gt;&gt; In other words, this sacrifice did not die in vain. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many Old Testament Jews did it constantly, right? Every cycle of revival, the animals died in vain. It was vain. It was vain. Meant nothing. Changed not their lives. But let this sacrifice forever change our lives. &gt;&gt; They saw it diligently. What is this? The the salvation uh what is this? What does this mean? And then they even prophesied of the grace. Remember said grace grace unto it. The capstone comes down with grace. Even uh Nehemiah said God has given us a little space of grace to get back to Israel, right? And and finish building the wall to protect God's people. It was a little space of grace. And let me say this, you have more than a little space of grace. You, the Bible said, God has given us much grace. Hallelujah. God is rich in grace. God is rich in mercy. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has given us so much mercy. So much grace. And let's live like we're thankful for it. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how I want to live my life. Hallelujah. But they uh the the the prophets diligently sought. Lord, what does this mean? How how how does this relate to salvation? And verse 11, the Bible says they even were searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify. So even they would search when is this going to happen? When is salvation going to change? When are we going to have more power? When are we going to have the power to to walk away from the sacrifice change? Because remember the Bible said the animal blood could never purge their conscience. &gt;&gt; Think about that. If you lied or something, if you stole, the animal would die, you'd feel bad, but you'd still have that guilty conscience. Now, church, it ought to be encouraging. We ought to be able to know when we come here, we confess our sins, we can leave with a clean conscience. &gt;&gt; That is a great difference. That should make us rejoice &gt;&gt; that we have a better covenant with better promises that we know God totally forgives the sins. Not just cover them over like the animal sacrifice, but he totally annihilates them or remits them, sends them away. Hallelujah. And the Bible said God forgets them. Amen. Hallelujah. How can a divine being forget sins? I don't know. But if anybody can do it, it's God. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory. See, they wonder when when would the spirit of Christ uh testify in them? When would it testify before the suffering of Christ and the glory that should follow? We know even the Garden of Eden, the first prophecy was about uh Jesus bruising the head of the serpent, right? But the serpent would bruise his heel. Hallelujah. Speaking of Calvary, think about think about that. That prophecy was 4,000 years. They were waiting. When is the seed of this woman going to finally defeat this serpent? They're just waiting and they diligently search. Is this the time? Is this the time that that the Messiah? Is this the Is Moses the Messiah? Is Joshua uh is John the Baptist the Messiah? &gt;&gt; I mean they diligently sought when is this suffering servant going to come and give us real salvation? Hallelujah. And then of course Paul says or Peter says here that it was revealed to him and the other apostles who wrote the scripture and who preached the gospel. Hallelujah. Verse 12, unto whom it was revealed that not unto unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things. So when they got these revelations how Jesus is the lamb of God. Amen. Jesus is the Passover lamb. Hallelujah. By his blood, if you apply his blood to your life, the death angel cannot strike your house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right. And your sins can be totally free and you can have an exodus out of your past life. They got an exodus out of Egypt. But we can live our we can live our and leave behind our entire past life. We can leave it behind and it'll be drowned in the sea of Jesus's blood. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. All of our addictions, brother Chris, can be drowned in the sea of the blood of Jesus Christ. All of our task masters. Amen. Hallelujah. It can all be drowned by the grace of God if we believe in the power of God's token lamb. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. My So it doesn't it just wasn't for the preachers. This this salvation and holy ghost just wasn't for the preachers the apostles. It Paul said Peter says it's unto us all of us. They minister the these things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into. And now notice it's present tense. The angels desire to look into these scriptures and these promises about salvation and the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Think about that, brother Austin. For 4,000 years, the angels, they would protect Moses. They would they would protect Noah. They would protect all these believers, but then he they would watch them turn right over and give into sin so easily. &gt;&gt; Imagine me, the angel. You were standing there and and you gave that rock power. When David sent that power, the angel supercharged that rock. Amen. It hit Goliath and it fell down. And you saw that as an angel, you were pleased. But then years later, you watch him give in to Basheba's situation. And then Uriah situation. The angels are like now. They've never sinned, right? They don't they don't even know what sin is, but they see the good and they see the bad. And the Bible says they care about us because they desire to know more about salvation. Think about that. They watch all those animals die. They watch over the believers not understand it. Even they'll even the angels are wondering what is this about? &gt;&gt; When is there going to be a change? When will there be power? When when can they have a clear conscience? When can we have a stable brother? When can we have a stable sister? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who lives under the power of the Holy Ghost and faithfully serves God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And even even when they have mountain top victories and they come down to the valleys, when will there be believers who will still overcome sin down in the valley? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They saw everybody rejoice on the mountain tops cuz the angels helped them get there. But they were wondering when are we going to have some believers? I desire to understand when is salvation going to change? When are these believers really going to have the Holy Ghost? And Peter says they're looking into it now. They want to see it now. They want to see us overcome. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They want to see us have real salvation. They want to see us have real Holy Ghost power. Can I say it like this? They want to see us have real Holy Ghost Christlike character that's like Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible said they desired now. They currently desire to look into these things. Look into the scriptures. Look at all these verses that talk about the life of the believer. Remember Ezekiel prophesied of it. You get a new heart. Then you get a new spirit. Then you get my spirit. &gt;&gt; That's what the angels desire to look into. Wow. What is brother Austin gonna look like with a new heart. A new spirit. And then God's spirit. &gt;&gt; What is brother Jesse going to look like with a new heart? The angels desire. What does that look like? Church. Let's live a life so they can understand what the salvation is, what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is. Let's live a life so the angels can understand the power of God in our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They see the power of God in God's creation, right? And God orders them around, but they want to see the power of God in your life and my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the desire of the angels. And remember, church, everybody has a guardian angel. &gt;&gt; So, your guardian angel wants to watch you overcome, wants you to see do spiritual warfare on the job, right? Preaching to my son here. And he wants to see me do spiritual warfare more on my job. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what the angels are watching, Brother Chris. They desire to see us live the full salvation life and then a Holy Ghostfilled life. &gt;&gt; That struck me as inspired. Imagine the angels watching in in Matthew 16. Imagine the angel watching Peter. Jesus asked Peter, "Who do you say that I am?" Well, some say you're Messiah. Some Jeremiah Isaiah. No, he said, "But who do you say I am?" Why? Think about that angel Peter standing right there. Peter says, "You're the Christ, the son of the living God." The angel's like, "That's right." Amen. Hallelujah. But the angel within within a matter of a few moments or hours, that angel has to watch Satan come on and anoint Peter. And Peter grabs hold of Jesus and say, "You will not go to the cross." And Jesus says, "Get behind me, Satan." Imagine the angel I imagine I wonder if you want to do some spiritual wrestling, right? Because that's what they like to do. Hallelujah. They like to wrestle for 21 day matches. Hallelujah. But he just stood there and watch it. Look at this is Peter and this is the man who wrote this. Hallelujah. He watches him on he watches him under the power of God and then he can so easily get deceived. Now this was before the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He gets so easil easily deceived to let Satan speak right through him. But Jesus overcame by the word of God. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. And that's what we overcome by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So angels have a deep interest in the mystery of salvation and the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and how you and I are able to receive that salvation which means deliverance from our sins and also the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the power of Christ and the witness of Christ in our lives. Amen. Hallelujah. Now, here church, this is a beautiful verse. Uh some people look at this verse in certain ways. Luke 15:10, if you got your Bible, likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of angels of God over one sinner that repents. Now, most people think that when someone gets saved, the angels rejoice. Okay? Brother Ham talks about that, too. A lot of preachers talk about that. That's very possible. So that's the way I'm going to use this today. So imagine the angel, your guardian angel, watching over you all the time, protecting you from car accidents or protecting you from drowning. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was safe from drowning at seven years old or eight years old. The angel made sure I was I didn't drown. Hallelujah. Amen. But imagine the angels, they watch as a child, they watch you give in to evil sins like cussing or swearing or blasphemy uh or or lust or something like this or stealing thieves. And they watch all these years. They go through year after year watching you. And finally, and now church, look, they're watching you. And all these years, you got these demons you're letting lead you. And these holy angels already beat them up in the war in heaven. And they're like, "Just give me a chance, God. Just give me a chance. I'll I'll take care of these demons." Right? Hallelujah. And so for all these years they wait some I almost waited two decades brother Chris in my life. Amen. I got saved at 19. I was almost 20. And for almost two decades they watched me just give into the demons. And the angel's like my angel's like I know he can overcome. I I can defeat this this devil. I've defeated him before. Hallelujah. Just give me the chance God. I'm waiting on you. Hallelujah. And then finally at that great service I I see the the football player lift his hands and I start crying. I said I'm ashamed of myself. I want to be a believer. I need to serve God. And church, right in that ceremony, there was angels there saying, "Praise God. Oh, now you've got to leave. Now I'm going to cast you out. Now you're overcome." And this boy is saved. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the angels rejoice. Hallelujah. Yes. Now he's going to be led by us. Now he'll obey my voice. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. is the angels of God rejoicing when you repented and you got saved. &gt;&gt; I imagine they also rejoice at your baptism. See, being baptized is a special moment. That's a time to rejoice &gt;&gt; because Jesus said, "Whosoever believeth and is baptized shall be saved." &gt;&gt; You go through the act of publicly declaring, "I'm dead. I'm crucified with with Christ." Amen. Therefore, I no longer live, but Jesus Christ lives in me. The life I live now, I live by the faith of the son of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Now, remember Daniel 9:21-22, the man Gabriel came to Daniel in a vision and informed it and said, "Daniel, I've come forth to give you skill and understanding." So, see how angels desire, they desire to help you out. Anybody need any spiritual skill here tonight? &gt;&gt; Anybody need any understanding about what God's going to do next in your life? Well, you come to the right place. Amen. &gt;&gt; God's desires. God's angels, brother Chris, desire, brother Austin, they desire to give us that, but we got to pray and seek God for it, too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what Daniel was doing. He shut himself away to pray. Now, we might not have the luxury of doing that, but we can do it every morning. Praise God. What I'm saying, you can't I can't take a month off, right? and a month away from helping out my family and paying the bills, but I can seek God every day. He said, "If I seek him daily, I'll find him." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that verse in Proverbs says, "If you seek me in the morning, you shall find me." I don't have it right in front of me, but that is a promise in the book of Proverbs. Those that seek me early shall find me. &gt;&gt; Let me see if I can pull that up real quick because it's uh it's uh wisdom personified. Yeah, there it is. Proverbs 8:17. Church, I wrote this up on my uh in my prayer closet. I got it on a post-it note. This is something I can pray for every day. And church, listen, you have a promise. This is a promise of God. If you seek God, not late. If you seek God early, it is thus sayeth the Lord. You got a promise. You'll find God for that day. &gt;&gt; Now, it might come might not come right away, but sometime in that day, the Bible says you'll find God. What do he wants you to do that day? What's God's agenda for that day? Maybe somebody's sick and God wants you to heal. Maybe someone needs a financial help. You can help them out. But the Bible says, "If you seek me early, you'll find me." Is that right, Brother Rod? Amen. Three decades in the prison. Did you find him? Amen. We He told us about it. Praise God. And I told him he might give us some more. Praise God. Hallelujah. Especially with supernatural testimonies maybe in Brother Angley's ministry. And then speaking maybe maybe we'll talk about that maybe to the just to the men as well. But see angels are interested in that. They want to bring you skill. They want to bring you some understanding so you understand the ways of God. Last night Malach and I talked to this young man, good man, Brennan. And he's just struggling on uh Calvinism versus Armenianism. Finally said it right. Glory. But you know that that that's that that uh causes people confusion, right? When they don't understand something, it caused them confusion and frustration. Well, what does the Bible say? The Bible said God comes to give you skill. God sends his angel so you'll understand the situation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Austin. Calvinism is God does it all. In other words, God's going to God's basically going to make it's already programmed. God's going to make you get saved. Armenianism is you got something to do in it. But they they they go to huge hyper extremes. The truth is always right down the middle. In other words, you're predestined, but God still gives you free more agency. And remember, I preached a sermon. Good question. I preached a sermon uh last year, and I showed by the Bible, your flesh has its own will. Your mind has its own will, and your soul has its own will. You got to you got to decide who's going to have uh whose will is going to be done. Every day, church, every day in all three eras, you got to decide who's going to get what what they want. Now, make sure your flesh don't win many days. Make sure and don't don't make sure your mind don't get the wrong thing at once and make sure it gets the word of God. &gt;&gt; And if your soul is saved, hallelujah, you're that's sealed to the day of your redemption. Praise God. &gt;&gt; It's actually your soul that brings the other two into subjection. Hallelujah. Yes. Now, uh let's look here. Uh Revelation 16 56 and 7. Revelation 16 56 and 7. Look at these holy angels. How we doing on time? Oh my. See, they're interested. Angels now angels watch church for four for 6,000 years. They've watched all these Christian martyrs die. They've watched these evil leaders seem like they succeed. Now, of course, we know they won't. But they watch all these injustices. And church, when God finally pours out the I'm sorry, the trumpets, the vials, the woes, the plagues, and then pours out his wrath on Babylon, watch what these angels say. And I heard the angel of the waters say, "Now, that might be another angel." That be that might be the ninth type of angel that I found. Okay, I haven't preached a sermon on that. Thou are righteous, O Lord, which art and was and shall be because thou hast judged us. So the angels can't wait till God judges this world. They've seen now look, they've seen all these fallen demons come down here and pervert this world, and they want to see God clean it up. That's their desire. That's our desire, too. Praise God. Now, still we pray for, you know, our enemies. We pray for them. We don't have judgment on them. But the angels want to see the judgments. They have a desire to see everything wrong made right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why? Verse six, for they have shed the blood of the saints and the prophets, and thou has given them blood to drink, for they're worthy. And I heard another an another out of the altar say, even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments. Angels desire judgment. Angels desire uh we'd say a fair trial. Hallelujah. Angels desire a fair punishment, right? Revelation 19:1 and2. And after these things, I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, "Hallelujah, salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God. For true and righteous are his judgments, for he hath judged the great which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and avenged the blood of his servants at her hand." This is a mo much people in heaven. So this could be angels or it could be the souls under the altar as Revelation 6, the fifth seal talks about. But what are they rejoicing in? They're rejoicing that justice has been done. And church, the same is true in in a minor way for us. Brother Ram said, "Every single thing we do wrong, we'll get punished for it." God's not going to let us get by with just with with sinning. We're going to have to suffer and pay for our sins in a minor way. But remember, God always gives us mercy less than what we actually deserve. &gt;&gt; But the angels rejoice when all the punishments are poured out because they've watched all these demons possess people, deceive people for 6,000 years. And the Bible said they'll rejoice and give God glory that all wrongs will be made right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. 1 Corinthians 4:9. Now, in my Corinthians series, I I paused right at chapter 12. I'm right in the middle of chapter 12. Maybe I'll pick it up Sunday. We'll see. But I already preached this verse slightly. For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death. So he So Paul was saying we were uh appointed last after all the Old Testament here. We're last because we're appointed to die. Remember Paul thought they all thought the Lord would come in their day, right? They all thought it. For we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men. What a amazing statement this is. The word spectacle is where we get the word theater from. We are made a theater or show or a public display to men and angels. So God has a stage set out and the sinners, all the sinners and all the angels are watching you and I on stage. Did you know that church? You're in a play. God wrote this play before the foundation of the world and we know the end. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We just got to know our parts. Brother Jesse, what's my part? It's right here. That's in I'm sorry. I left my Bible in the back. Let me get your Bible, buddy. Yeah, we know our part. It's the part where we praise God. Where we live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. What do I say? I forgot my part. The Bible said the Holy Ghost will bring all things to your remembrance. Hallelujah. You'll remember your part. Just stay in tune with the word of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now church, look at that. And this this is fits perfectly with brother Ram's story about the three Hebrew children, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo. They were being they were chained up. They were being taken to the fiery furnace. And brother Ram dramatized in heaven. And Ga said, Gabriel came up and said, "Lord, I'll go down there." He said, "No, Gabriel, step back." Michael came up and said, "Lord, I'll go." "No, no, Michael, step back." All the angels came back and God stopped and said, "No, no, Michael. Gabriel, my children, I know they're in trouble. This is a God-sized job." &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm going to go down. And the Bible said God came down on the wings of cherubam. Angels. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Again, because angels always bring deliverance to the people. Hallelujah. And remember Nebuchadnezzar, as we heard on Sunday, I put I thought I put in three. He said there's four in there. And there's one likened to the son of God. God came down. He stood by his people that believed in prayer. And God will stand by everyone who doesn't want to be an idoltor. Yeah, brother Chris. &gt;&gt; Which one? Daniel. &gt;&gt; That's about uh 500 years before maybe 600 or 700 years before Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. One likened the son of God. Yes. Yes. Yeah, that's a great point, brother. Yeah, one liken of the son of God. So, there must have been some type of truth made known. I mean, of course, there was uh Davidic prophecies about God having a son, right? A virgin shall conceive. He'll be a son. He'll be a mighty God. Uh wonderful counselor, prince of peace. Remember Isaiah, I think it's Isaiah 7 and Isaiah chapter 9. Good question. Give to class, brother. Good question. Yeah. So, they knew and even even Solomon asked that question. He said, "Lord, what's your name? And what is your son's name?" Hallelujah. So, there was a revelation. I think that's in Proverbs 30 if I'm not mistaken or 31. They knew God. There was God and God was going to have a son. They knew that, brother. So, it's one like the son of God. Hallelujah. Amen. And that was God's theophony there. Hallelujah. I hear it calling me tonight. Praise God. Amen. So, notice, church, the angels are watching. The angels are waiting there to step off on the stage and help you, brother Austin. Angels are waiting there. They're all just waiting. When is it my Lord? Is it my turn to go on stage? Can I go help brother Jesse? Can I go help Malachi on the job? The angels are waiting. They're just waiting on God for orders. Oh, church, you ought to be thankful tonight. Praise God. God puts you on the stage. Everyone's watching you. Everyone's watching the bride. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't forget that, church. God's watching the bride and Israel. &gt;&gt; Remember we went over the ceiling angel in Revelation 7. The angels are holding back the winds, right, of the great tribulation. The angels are holding them back until what? God seals them. The a the sealing angels seal them with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So, Israel's on the stage and God's bride is on the stage. Hallelujah. And God's angels are placed and at the right moment, God will send them onto the scene and he'll cause he'll cause I'll say like this. He'll cause angels to rejoice. Hallelujah. The holy angels. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When people get saved and people get the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Church, angels are watching your life. Hallelujah. This is a cosmic drama or a cosmic play. See, demons are watching. When when can I uh tempt Brother Rod? When can I tempt Brother Jesse? When can I tempt Brother Jose? The demons are watching, too. &gt;&gt; And remember, they got to get permission from God as well. &gt;&gt; So, they're all watching. When can I get my place? When can I get when when can I do this? When can I do that? Church, we've got to trust God. We got to know that if God allows a trial, then he'll provide a solution. He'll provide an antidote. He'll provide a way out. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because he allowed the test to come. And remember, church, all of this is teaching the angels. Brother Chris, they want to understand what is real salvation. What I wonder wonder what it must feel like to be truly forgiven, to truly have a conscience free from sin, where the devil can't bring up your past life on you anymore. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "In other words, you don't have a conscience of your sins anymore because you're so forgiven. You're so in love with Jesus, you don't have a conscience of your past life." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. The angels want to learn. They want to look into that. Well, what is that prophecy? What what is the Holy Ghost really doing in a believer's life? What is it really like to be saved? That's why we sing that song. That's why I chose that song. And then the angels all will listen. For they cannot join the song of the redeemed. They've never been lost. So they they can't sing along. Church, have you noticed all that they do is praise God. God, you've judged God. And God, you're the great one. That's all they do. They'll never be able to join your song. Not only does God judge, not only is God great, but God saved me from my life of sin. God saved me from hell. Hallelujah. God made me a real believer. God empowered me with the Holy Ghost to overcome demon powers. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; I didn't have to live as a slave to sin my whole life. I could be a overcomer by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; You shook hands with a bunch of overcomers last Wednesday night. Remember that? God bless you, overcomer. Remember? Hallelujah. I'm almost done. So the angels rejoice. They when you get saved, they long to understand your salvation. They long to understand what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost like. And I think I'll just close because I only got a couple minutes here. Mark 13:32 and 33. Mark 13:32 and 33. Did you guys read that chapter last was it last Monday night or the night the Monday before? Mark 13:32. But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. Take ye heed, watch and pray, for you know not when the time is. Now we believe according to God's prophet, Brother Brandham, putting the scriptures together, prophets come to reveal the word of God, right? They make known hidden things. So, we believe God's prophet showed us the rapture is pre-tribulation. Because the word caught away means to snatch away quickly. Why would God need to snatch away quickly his bride? Because the Bible said sudden destruction comes after that. &gt;&gt; He's got to quickly get them out of there because then he's going to pour his wrath upon the unbelievers. And God always rescues his people. Hallelujah. Before he pours out his wrath, his wrath. God will not allow uh the righteous to suffer the wrath with the wicked. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's thus sayith the Lord. Hallelujah. That's God's word. Hallelujah. Not me. That's the L. It's the word of the Lord. Hallelujah. But notice, church, as we approach the rapture, we are going through birth pains. We saw it with CO. Now we're seeing with AI technology. Rod sent me another article there where they're trying to get AI. Now, we've seen them for years, but it's closer than it's ever been before. Europe's trying to get you to do a digital one on your phone. Well, pretty soon it's going to get in, you know, pretty soon it's going to be inside or whatever it may be. But church, we know with each time, each test, it's a harder birth pain. It's a harder birth pain. And the angels are holding back those trumpets. So imagine, church, the earth right now, angels are holding back on all sides. They're holding back the wrath of God. This nation has killed over 70 million babies and abortions. That's just what they counted. &gt;&gt; The wrath of God is on this nation. Now, what am I praying for? I told you I'm just praying for a generational revival in certain pockets of the world. This nation will never have a national revival. It's too far gone. It's all right. Brother Ram said, "Thus sayith the Lord." She had her last chance in 1956 because it was 50 years after the Zuza Street revival. 50 is the number of Jubilee. She turned down her Jubilee. And that was the year Elvis got big. &gt;&gt; They chose rock and roll over God, over Christ. They chose the wrong king, the king of rock and roll over Jesus Christ, the King of Kings. And church, just to throw throw this in there, I heard a good preacher say this that no kings protest &gt;&gt; on last Saturday, whatever it was that was saying, "We don't want Jesus's king because they dress up like LGBTQ and all this nonsense." Whatever it is, they were all dressed up like that. It was saying, "We don't want even Jesus to be our king." But I'm here to say Jesus is the king and he's our king. Hallelujah. And he will reign over me. Praise God. His kingdom will also reign in me. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is within you. Jesus said, "Hallelujah. That's my king. King Jesus." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's holy forever. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But imagine all the angels take their position. Now, church, the rapture comes when the last bride member is sealed by the Holy Ghost. That's when the rapture happens because the Bible said Jesus has to shorten the time so that somebody's saved. Now, church, picture this. Every time somebody gets the Holy Ghost when you got it there in Akan sister an angel ceiling angel came down touched you filled you with the Holy Ghost and then went back to heaven. So think about that in the spiritual realm the angels hold back then there's other angels coming down hallelujah to to South America right to Canada filling people with the Holy Ghost. There's sealing angels all around the world but one day it's going to be the last sealing angel &gt;&gt; and the angels will be up there in heaven. &gt;&gt; Is this the end? And one of those archangels is like, "Is it going to be me?" Because the shouts are he's gone forth, but they still see Jesus over there on the throne. He's seated on the throne. Archangel is getting a little nervous. Going to be you. I hope it's me. Is it going to be you? Did he tell you anything? No. No. God didn't. You didn't tell me nothing. I'm waiting just like you are. I don't know the day or the hour. You know the scripture. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. At some glorious moment as all the archangels stand there, they're going to watch our Lord Jesus stand up. And now mercy is finished for the Gentiles. And he'll say, "Archangel, maybe it's Michael, right? He's only named one. There's princes or archangels. Michael, come here, sir." Michael's like, "Oh, I knew it was me. A you lucky guy. They because they desire they desire to be the one to do this. Michael, come here. Yes, my lord. Preparing for reporting for service. Michael, it is your time. Cry out your voice to the dead in Christ. Now, church, look at this. He's going to call out to the dead in Christ. Sound your voice. He's going to say, "Rise, dead in Christ." But all those dead in Christ, their theophanes are up here in heaven. So he's going to call and he's going to say, "Let the dead in Christ rise." And all those millions, maybe billion Christians, theophanes are going to go swoop down to the earth, find all those chemicals, and they're going to combine with their glorified bodies. And they'll be walking around. We'll see Brother Brent, it's Brother Bram, it's Brother Angley, it's St. Paul. Oh, it's almost time for the rapture, church. Imagine. Hallelujah. What it's going to be like. We'll see the dead in Christ and we know, "Oh, it's going home time. Let's get ready to go see Jesus." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And finally, Jesus will say, "Prumpet angel, prepare your trumpet." He'll be like, "Yes, I knew that was me. Glory to God. I'm ready, my Lord. Get ready to blow. My bride is ready. Every redeemed bride member is filled with the Holy Ghost and her body is ready to be swallowed up in life. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Get ready to sound. It's time. And when you sound, I go down this time. Hallelujah. All the theophanes are emptied out of heaven. But there's Jesus in the form. Hallelujah. He said, now I'm going down to get my bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He says, "Sound angel." And Jesus flies down on the wings of a cherub, meets us in the air. The angel sounds and we're swallowed up like a lick of fire. And then we rise to meet our Lord in the air. There's Martin Luther, John Wesley. Hallelujah. Brother Brandham, all the saints, and then we finally see Jesus. And Jesus says, "Well done. Let us go to the marriage supper of the lamb. Come with me, my bride." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we all go up. Be seated, bride. It's time for communion. Hallelujah. And all the angels around about the throne. Oh yes, I knew he'd make it. Yes, I knew she'd make it. She was faithful on earth. She confessed Jesus before men. Jesus will confess her before me. &gt;&gt; I was a witness of the power of God. &gt;&gt; Let the church stand. Hallelujah. Praise God. musicians can come. The angels desire to know the time of the rapture as well, but they've got to wait just like we've got to wait. All heaven can't wait for that moment, including the angels, just like all the believers on earth can't wait for the voice of the archangel. Dead in Christ, rise. Trumpet sounding angel, blow the trumpet. It's time to meet my bride in the air. How many want to be ready when that comes? Praise God. May our desires match the desire of Christ and of the angels. The angels desire to look into church the joy, the victory, the strength that you have, church. They desire to know what is salvation like. What is it like to be totally forgiven? What is it like to have God live inside you? To be sealed with the Holy Ghost. What is that like? Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't know, but we know. Praise God. And church, if if there's a chance, I'm going to make sure I go shake my guardian angel's hand, Brother Rod, and say, "Thank you for saving me from drowning. I really appreciate that. Hallelujah. That was a great That was a great wonderful work. Thank you for obeying God, saving my life. Thank you." Say, "Yes, sir. It was my joy to serve my Lord Jesus." Thank you. Hallelujah. I would not have met Brother Rod. I would not have met Austin if it wasn't that for that angel saving me. Praise God. God is good, church. Let's bow our heads. Father God, we thank you for tonight, Lord. The desires of the angels, Lord God. Lord, they're waiting just like we're waiting, Lord God. One of those archangels is going to be so blessed to be the angel to call forth the dead in Christ. One of those trumpet angels will blow that final gentile trumpet and we which are alive and remain will be changed in a moment and a twinkle of an eye and meet the saints in the air. Lord God, what a privilege, what a blessing. So our desire, Lord God, is to live true to you. Our desire, Lord God, is to enjoy our salvation and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. For the angels wish they could understand it. They look into it. They want to know what it's like. Oh, God. Strengthen us, Lord God, to live the way we ought to live, Lord Jesus. But we're so blessed to know the things we know, Lord God. Just make it more real, Lord, as time goes on. May the Bible become more real to us, Lord God. May the sermons of Brother Brandham become more real to us. May the sermons here at Bride of Christ Fellowship become more real to us. God, open our eyes. I pray that we could see into that unseen realm, Lord God. That these angels desire to fight for us. They rejoice at our salvation. They rejoice at our deliverance because they see us set free from the villains of the past, their enemies of the past. They've already defeated and they know we'll finally be defeated and sent to hell which was made for the devil and his angels. &gt;&gt; Oh God, strengthen us here tonight. Lord, if there's anyone in need of prayer, deliverance, I pray you'd send your delivering angel tonight, Lord God. Hallelujah for the glory of God. I I trust and pray this message was a strength to your people. Take this word now. May they meditate on it tonight, tomorrow, Lord, or some other thought from the Holy Ghost. And may they be strengthened Thursday, Friday, Saturday, till we meet again on Sunday, should the Lord, Terry, help us to watch and pray. For no man knows the day or the hour, not the sun. No, not the angels. But they're waiting just like we're waiting, Lord God, for the Son of God to stand. Come down, Lord, and meet us in the air. Snatch us away from the earth. [Music] Bless us God tonight as we worship in Jesus Christ's name.
