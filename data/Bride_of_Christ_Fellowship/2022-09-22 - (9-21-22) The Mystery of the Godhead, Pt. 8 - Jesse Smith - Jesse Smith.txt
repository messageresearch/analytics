========================================

your Bibles here hold my verse here let's go let's start with Ephesians 3 verse 9. we'll just start there the grace of God you see the Saints and how's the Lord tonight you know just having a few extra people here on Wednesday night makes it feel like it's pretty bad you know so we're thankful for all the saints coming out to the house of the Lord tonight praise God it's good to seeing those old-time songs ain't no brother William pretty good buddy huh takes me back 20 years too Hallelujah thank you Jesus that sounds kind of funny started out traveling many years ago like I was traveling many years ago 20 years many years so let's look here Ephesians 3 verse Nina you know as as I'm preaching through this chapter here coming down to the end of it and I kind of close this chapter with the rewards for receiving the Revelation and then also the consequences for rejecting the revelation I kind of end every chapter that way and that's true you know the mystery of God is available to all it's available to everyone but those who receive it get a special reward those who turn it down they have to suffer the consequence because all the mysteries of God are finished how many believe that Mr God had to be finished and then it had to be taken around the world right like Revelation chapter 10 says so if it's available then there have to be rewards for those who accept it but there's also has to be consequences to them who reject it and remember like I was telling uh I think I was telling maokai that this week you know we have this confidence all that the father has given me will come to me Jesus Christ promised Satan cannot snatch one out of the father's hand all those that are predestinated for known they will be saved in other words we have confidence we can't make anybody lost praise God and we can't save anybody we can preach in water and we can plant the seed but God gives the increase praise God that's up to him so may God help us to spread these Revelations more and more by God's grace Ephesians 3 verse 9. here is the first reward of knowing the godhead it's fellowship with Christ that's the first reward we looked at it on Wednesday remember it was last Wednesday it was communion well the ram said in John 17 what did Jesus want more than anything else he wanted your fellowship he wanted your prayers he wants you to pour out your heart to him he wanted your Praises he wanted you wanted your thanksgivings he wanted to know the secrets of your heart praise God he wants our fellowship this is a great this is a great mystery the Bible says let's read this again on three one two three and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ now keep your Bible there let's go to Colossians chapter 2 verse 2. Colossians 2 verse 2. Fellowship there means intimacy so those who receive Paul's Revelation had a fellowship had an intimacy of the mystery there's an intimacy of knowing god when you receive a mystery the veil is on the veil is taken off and now you see it plainly praise God that's the whole point of a mystery it's hiding something but then when the veil is removed now what's what's behind the veil is exposed in this case it's our Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah hiding behind the veil of Flesh thank God it was God hiding behind there the whole time Hallelujah Colossians 2 verse two this scripture of course says this this acknowledges the mystery of the notice the father and of Christ don't say the mystery of the Holy Ghost that's that's Christ in you the hope of glory that's another mystery this is the mystery of the father and the son I'll read this myself that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all Riches of the full Assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God and of the father and let's have one more word of prayer ask God to anoint us here preach his work to give us understanding how many want to grow in Revelation here tonight grow in understanding grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord knowledge we know the world even knows knowledge is power knowledge is understanding understanding that we're free understanding that doors can be open to us understanding that there's an intimacy there's a fellowship we can have with Christ Heavenly Father Lord we just lift our hearts to you father God I pray you speak to every heart anoint me God anoint your people we're happy to be in this place here tonight father God we want to know you and we want to make you known dear God so father use us God For Your Glory dear God I pray you strengthen every heart God ministered everyone if someone's not saved me they get saved someone's not Sanctified may they get Sanctified someone's not filled with the Holy Ghost man they get filled with the Holy Ghost if someone's discouraged may they be encouraged Hallelujah if someone's depressed may they be set free from that Lord God may they be joyful again in the Lord we ask for your mercies and Grace in this service in Jesus Christ's name and the saint said amen God bless you with your BNC to praise God Hallelujah so let's look at this uh be part eight of the godhead mystery like I said I'm preaching right through the uh the chapter that the Lord had me uh write you know I was looking at a someone sent me a card a few months ago in the mail a woman uh I'll just say her name first name is Laura and uh she's been so blessed by that uh 12 mystery book she said all my life I just wondered how she said how could how could I understand the ministry of brother Branham and she said when I read your book it gave me a framework and a foundation to understand brother branham's Ministry in the Bible so she said now I'm going through it a second time she said now I feel like I can understand all the scriptures that the message point of this team I thought that was beautiful to see that you know uh and that right there is the revelation God gave to me you know that this is how when I come to the message I come by the Bible you know and everybody can come a different way you know but I came I just sat at the at the Bible study I just listened and Jesus Christ became real to me praise God through the scripture and then I asked when I heard these Revelations I asked where did you get that and they said from a prophet named William Brandt praise God and so my framework to know this message was the Bible First other people might have known it uh uh brother random first and that can be okay too which either side you come in you got to have the right balance by God's grace you have to be balanced and we have to find our balance in the scriptures praise God so I'm thankful uh tonight by God's grace so this chapter ends with three rewards we have for receiving the revelation of the godhead we get three rewards that at least I can find a scripture no doubt there's more but as I was studying and looking at all these scriptures on the godhead three came to me most clearly the first is that we know God intimately because God wants to be known the Bible said he's near to every one of us how many believe that he's near he is within distance of touching him how do you believe that spiritually spiritually you can touch you can contact the Holy Spirit today a lot of people don't know that and God is so far away no it's only your sins that have grieved him far away but really he's not that far if you just repent and change your ways the Bible said he'll turn back to you praise God I'm reading through Jeremiah now and he just says that over and over again thus saith the Lord Return To Me O Israel and I'll return to you over and over again thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord return to me praise God and I'll return to you Hallelujah it's a great promise that God has you know uh you know even some of us who can serve God for decades right we get through difficult times we feel like God's so far away but actually it's the opposite is true God is very close to us praise God if we're sitting and yes we just got to repent and then the Holy Spirit Fellowship comes back but sometimes you know we're just going through a dark place we're just being tested sometimes and but God wants us to remember that he's with us in the valley just like he's with us on the Mountaintop praise God he wants us to know him he wants us to experience a loss sometimes and discouragement and difficult times so in those times we'll understand Christ better we'll learn to lean upon him we'll learn to talk to him in the hard times just like we can rejoice and praise him in the good times amen coming to know him and and being intimate with him in every season of our life praise God this is the first benefit of knowing there's one person that God had not three persons in the godhead Hallelujah so you church we I'll say like this you're hearing the message when we were really born again we're the only group in the world that has True Fellowship with God I know that's a a difficult statement sometimes for some people to believe but it's the truth in fact the closest group I know uh to our Revelation is the Oneness Pentecostals now years ago my wife remembered this we John Graham and I we fellowship with this man named Paul do you remember that one is preacher Paul and his wife remember his wife's name I can't remember her name either they dress just like us they talk just like us they had Bible studies they sang Just Like Us they come to our service a couple times Paul and Elizabeth there it is but one that had a few things off you know she had high heels on they're kind of high heels you know and they didn't and they didn't they they what was it they trim their hair that's right hung hair but trim the very ends of it what was it oh it was short too yeah some of them had short hair too but they believe in one person one person the godhead but we could you know when we talked John and I you know it was always boiled down to these few points we just couldn't agree on and and uh and when it came to brother round they just said flatly no he's not a prophet but that but they had no TVs they had no TVs they didn't go to movies they were they were just living holy their favorite part of the week was church just like ours uh they love to Shout Scream they dance they spoke in tongues they had all these blessings Miracles like we have praise God but we couldn't agree they couldn't go as far as we could in the word of God they couldn't accept in other words they couldn't accept Revelation 10 7. ah it's the verse the scripture they couldn't accept praise God they couldn't see they couldn't accept Malachi four five and six they couldn't accept Luke 17 30. but you and I can receive it praise God Hallelujah and that brings us a greater knowing these things in brother matters Ministry and and these other Bible teachings it gives us a greater intimacy with God it does it has to because there's effects to not obeying all the word of God Hallelujah and it's just like Jesus when he was uh on Earth here uh he was amongst Hebrews and they were strict monotheists right so much so that he told the woman at the well the Samaritan woman he said we are Jews and we know what we worship in other words the Jews were not guessing is he two persons is he three persons they knew who they were worshiping amen and that's how we are that's what that's what makes us so different than trinitarian churches we know who we're worshiping amen it's one God manifested in three ways praise God and there's only one remaining mysterious part it's the plural pronouns of we and us with Jesus and the father that's the only remaining mystery but that speaks of multiple manifestations and how Jesus body is a different manifestation than life it's a different manifestation than a rock in the wilderness that body is a different manifestation than all the other manifestations praise God so it needs a separate pronoun but it doesn't mean it's two persons it means one person who has a special mask on Amen he's got a special Veil it's the Mighty God unavailable for us now praise God we see the Mighty God behind the body of Jesus Christ praise God we don't see a second person but we see a mighty God unveiled behind the body of Jesus Christ if the body of Jesus Christ is a once in a once in a lifetime or once in a a creation manifestation there's never been a body like his and there'll never be a body like his how do you believe that so that's the last remaining mystery is how there can be plural pronouns so the Jews were not guessing and church we're not guessing God is one person and we know him intimately through his word you know my wife and I were talking and remember brother Adam said he said I may not know the book very well but I know the author real well if you look at the context though he's talking about doctors of divinity but now church let me ask you who knew the Bible more a doctor of divinity or brother random think about that before you say anything brother man was being humble brother I was saying I don't know the Greek or the Hebrew he said but he's got the revelation of the written word hallelujah amen so let me say that is brother Ram knew the author real well because he knew the word real well Hallelujah that's what the Bible says it says Paul says all scripture is given to us for profitable for Doctrine and godliness and Holiness that the man of God and women of God may be thoroughly refurbished unto every good work praise God swerve people that we're not we're not educated by denomination We're Not educated by doctor degrees but we know God his character we know this we know the author real well and by this time 57 years after Brothers been off the scene we ought to know the Bible real well amen Hallelujah that's right church we ought to know both really well and I'm contending brother Brown was being humble when he was saying that but he really knew the Bible well then more than they did too he's making the point I don't have a doctorate degree but I know Jesus Christ but I'll take brother random sermons any day over a doctorate degree Hallelujah remember Jesus said the father is seeking true worshipers in other words intimate worshipers not flirters the church said many people that go to church are just flirting with Jesus they're not giving him all their love all their worship all their time all their emotion they just serve God for what the blessings but when it comes down to sin they really love sin more than they love the things of God because they keep doing sin instead of crucifying sin Hallelujah that's right so God is looking for true worshipers and you can see this you know plainly against trinitarians you know they sprinkle instead of fully immersed in water and there's not one verse in the Bible that says sprinkle there's not one not even one they call God upon titles fathers and Holy Ghost rather than his name and they bless themselves with a sign of a cross and holy water I'm talking about Roman Catholic stuff or yeah but as you worship God's one person you're like Abel bringing the correct acceptable sacrifices and the trinitarians or the uh even I'll say the Oneness that have worldly things they're bringing sacrifices on their own choosing like Cain now some of them can be saved I'm not putting them all lost but Jesus said very few there be that find it oh we ought to be thankful that we're one of those few Hallelujah that found the true worship that our true worshipers that do not add to the word of God but just read the word of God accept it believe it and live by it praise God that's the first the first benefit is you get intimacy with God he gives you true communion as we said last week you don't have to set your timer well let me pray 10 minutes to the father now pray 10 minutes to the Sun and then I'll I'll pray 10 minutes of the Holy Spirit you don't got to do that church you have to worry about that because the the Bible makes it plain pull up first John 1 3. pull up first John 1 3. you'd have to wonder who you're fellowshipping with the Bible says truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ amen hallelujah Jesus said when you see me you've seen the father praise God Hallelujah pull up uh Matthew 11 27. When You Believe on Jesus Christ he reveals the father Jesus is the image of the invisible God hallelujah and of course when you know the father you know the holy spirit because the holy spirit is the father praise God well let Matthew 11 27 all things are delivered unto me and my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him so when we come to know Jesus as the high priest when we pray to Jesus in heaven we're actually contacting the father but we've got to go through the high priest Glory just like in the the holy the holiest of holies you got to go through the high priest had to go through he was the one interceding unto God praise God and that's how Jesus says we go through Jesus to the invisible Immortal spirit of God can everybody see that by God's grace in other words when you pray to Jesus you're really praying to the father praise God but in your prayers you might be speaking to the high priest side of Jesus but then there are times there might be times you're speaking to the god side the invisible side of Jesus in other words the god side doesn't the the spirit side the god side can't feel the infirmities are you with me now the god side the invisible side wasn't crucified you can't crucify a spirit but the man's side the The Human Side the Jesus side the high free side that's the sign that can be touched by the feeling of orange he's praise God you understand you have a human Human Side now it's divinely human now it's is glorified human side but you got the other side that the invisible spirit that side was not crucified that side uh never died it can never die praise God but when we pray the Bible tells us to come to Father through the son that's why we call on Jesus because Jesus knows what it's like to battle you can say like this Jesus knows what it's like to be tempted and the Bible said then he wants to secure you he wants to help you in your hour of Temptation amen because he can feel it he understands that he knows what it's like to be tempted the man's eye Jesus is that right Hallelujah go to Ephesians 2 18. this is a benefit that we have it's not two separate persons but it's crying out to the one person of God and when you cry to that one person you have access both to the human side and the Divine side Glory look at this for through him we have both access by one Spirit unto the father oh Hallelujah we have access we have a channel to the father through Jesus amen Hallelujah that's why we'll pray heavenly father will pray Lord Jesus we can pray right to the Lord Jesus we can say great High priests and the guests guess who's praying on the inside of us the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit the Bible says by the spirit we're praying the spirit of God is moving us and it's moving us to pray to Jesus and then and then as as we as we break into the revelation of prayer then we start speaking we have access to that eternal spirit praise God in that something you got the eternal spirit in you and then you're praying to the eternal spirit ah it's a great mystery amen that's like Jesus he was in The Garden of Gethsemane the spirit of God was in him but yet he's praying to the spirit of God is that right but it's a great Revelation it's a great mystery and this can only be done through the great high priest so let's go to Hebrews 4 14. this might encourage you here tonight this is the intimacy 4 14. seeing then that we have this great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession verse 15. for we have not in a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities this is what I was saying earlier the Eternal and miserable Spirit has no infirmities it can't God's spirit cannot feel that but Jesus's body did but Jesus was in all points tempted like we as we are yet without sin next verse 16. let us therefore how should we pray then come boldly in your prayers before the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need that's why church we can pray like Lord Jesus Lord I'm really struggling right now I know you I know you can understand what it's like to struggle and to face Temptation I know you can feel it Lord help me and then you'll then sometimes you'll feel the spirit of God come back upon you and strengthen you and give you Victory what happened you went to God through the high priest and the high priest made an intercession to God for you praise God and the spirit of God comes back and answers your prayer and you get the power of the spirit of God you become stronger because you went through the right channel amen you went through the one who could understand your feelings understand your struggles and then the Bible said then you had access to the father oh my so we go through the son to the father and the church said that's why you must that's why sometimes we can pray Heavenly Father Like Jesus we go right to the father but sometimes uh we pray to the high priest the Lord Jesus Christ what did Stephen pray to when he was getting stoned he said Lord Jesus receive my spirit he went right to the high priest right he could understand right Jesus could understand about being martyred it's even right there he said Lord Jesus receive my spirit lay this not to their charge and it and Jesus could feel that because Jesus said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing praise God so see Church we've got to pray as we're LED and we've got to pray not feeling condemned well I pray to that one or that one the Bible tells us we have access to the father through the Holy Spirit and we must come boldly to the high priest amen oh my it's beautiful this is intimacy that we have thank you Lord now think about that church think about Catholics I went to uh Brother Ray I went to a a Catholic funeral about a month or two ago they did just as much talking to Mary as it did Jesus see because their intimacy is perverted they have intimacy with Mary they've intimacy with uh Saint James and different James saints that they go to look at their loving their intercessing through all these different channels but we got one channel praise God we've got we've only got intimacy with one person that's the Lord Jesus praise God there's one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus amen not a woman praise God not another man not another Saint no man was worthy only Christ was worthy praise God that's why we go to Christ through prayer Glory see since we have great access to the father how many glad for that access sometimes church I've seen this I've said such humble I'd say weak prayers and yet God has answered some of them anybody can say Amen to that with me in here I didn't maybe pray as long as I should have I was too tired to praise but yet God still heard my prayer why because Jesus knows what it's like to be tired right and he can be touched by your tired prayer but see the thing he loves is your prayer amen the thing he loves is your fellowship praise God the thing he loved is that at least you're trying at least you're reaching out to him you're not going to the the bottle of alcohol you're not going to the cigarette pack you're going to heaven praise God Amen in your dark hour and your our Temptation where do you go you don't go to the world you go to Christ Jesus you go to the high priest because he ever lives to help you he ever lives to make intercession for you that's why he lives amen and because he lives we can face tomorrow right Hallelujah that first reward is intimacy that the trinitarians and even the Oneness don't know about because when we saw them when we saw them cut their hair what did that that shamed their husbands and then that shames Christ so they cannot have the same intimacy that we have and we're not bragging but we're just looking at what the scripture says because the Bible says if we brag or boasts what uh we know Pride goes before the fall right we start bragging we're the greatest of all time watch that watch people that do that Pride goes before the fall some some fall will come no that's the first reward second reward Is possessing God's power now this ought to be a reality for us praise God and I know it is some of us might be going through difficult times now but think back when the you knew the power of God was moving in your life like right now brother amen just got a fresh touch right sister they were testifying that on Sunday right a fresh move of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives praise God Jesus Promised with the Revelation that he was the Messiah the gates of hell would not Prevail against this revelation praise God and let me ask you was Jesus promised to Peter true or not how did everything it could to bring down Peter it brought swords right abroad Roman soldiers on the night of Jesus arrest right it brought a mob against him it brought Satan brought fear against Peter it brought a little woman and and he had to he had to stand there and deny that evil he said I promise I give an oath I don't even know the man I swear I don't even know him I swear by Jehovah you don't know Jehovah look at that the greatest thing we can swear by is by God right we shouldn't swear the Bible says but he swears he gives the oath I don't know him did hell Prevail against him though no hell didn't Prevail against him he didn't give up he didn't sell out Christ now I love the part of this when he heard that Crow the third time he went away and wept praise God we don't find Judas doing that Judas didn't go away and sleep or I'm sorry we'd rather but Peter was humble right he knew he remembered all the experiences with God and he would not forsake Jesus all the way yes he forsook him in that moment but he wasn't totally defeated praise God Amen Jesus knew in three short days I'm going to encourage you I'm going to lift you up church that we can just wait a few more days amen if we can just learn to wait another week wait another month wait another year keep waiting on God the gates of hell can never Prevail against you amen Hallelujah no matter what Satan brings the councils of hell no matter what he brings you know a band of soldiers in Peter's case the fear of death and arrest whatever Satan could bring against him it could not Prevail against him he might have lost a few battles but he didn't lose the war praise God see that's the power so Judas he had access to this power but he turned it down he forsook this power said his name was on the Lamb's Book of Life but then Brothers said your name can never be removed off the Lamb's Book of Life That's the recent video I made but in other words brother and I said Judas had real faith but then he forsook it by transgression and his name was removed from The Book of Life and if you want quotes on that let me know I'd be happy to share those with you my brother I was growing in his revelation he eventually realized what judas's name couldn't be on the last book of life because the names on the Lamb's Book of Life were written before the foundation of the world and they will not worship the Beast hallelujah amen in other words your name was on the Lamb's Book of Life praise God because God knew you wouldn't worship that Roman Catholic that denominational system that sin loving system that b system and said you would love the the godhead amen you would love Jesus Christ you would love the true kingdom of God hallelujah not the false church not the false Kingdom but the true kingdom of God built by Jesus Christ and Upon This Rock and upon this Revelation that Jesus is Messiah and like brother Adam said the greatest scripture on the godhead brother Adam said is Acts 2 37 the same God has made Jesus both Lord and Christ Amen brother said if you can't see God that Jesus and God in that scripture then you are blinded you can't see anything because Peter says he's both Lord and Messiah he's both God and Messiah he's both he's God and man Hallelujah you can't see Jesus of God in that scripture he says you have no hope because God has made Jesus both Lord of all and Christ Hallelujah see Church hell's councils will not Prevail against you even in your greatest failures because you've got the greatest revelation the revelation of Jesus Christ now don't raise your hands here but how many ever had a failure where you felt ashamed of yourself let's be honest all of our hands would figuratively be up right we've all felt like we failed God but have we failed like Peter have we publicly denied Christ three times no I'm not putting him down I'm not putting us above him I'm just saying think about the the difficulty think about the supposed failure that he had but yet God never gave up on it God's not going to give up on you Church you believe honey baby was the Messiah but who is the Messiah to be was he to be a second person or did Isaiah 9 6 say he was to be the Mighty God Amen the Prince of Peace Hallelujah the Everlasting father the Messiah was to be the Everlasting father one person Jesus Christ was both Lord and Christ amen see see the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against you when you have this revelation in other words idolatry will never take you that's why people that worship brother Branham or worship the tapes they cannot be born again because you're an idolater and idolatry has taken them over they're a slave they're chained to idolatry everywhere on the table is thus say the Lord and there's no mistakes prophets never make mistakes that's what thus saith the Lord that's not what
