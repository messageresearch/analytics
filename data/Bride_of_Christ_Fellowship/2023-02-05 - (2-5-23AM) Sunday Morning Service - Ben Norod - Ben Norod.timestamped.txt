[0:00] a place you plan on going to amen
[0:04] oh I I love it I love it the older I get
[0:08] the weepier I get I didn't used to cry
[0:10] so much through songs but I don't know I
[0:13] just seem to really feel in my heart
[0:15] that we are very very close to that
[0:17] great Homeland don't you think so
[0:19] amen
[0:21] Matthew chapter 5 verse 38 and 39 if you
[0:24] got your Bible
[0:29] sure yeah I think the brother's
[0:31] arranging it yeah
[0:36] yeah I know I thought it was just me but
[0:38] I'm usually doing that mess right there
[0:40] anyways so I'm a poor judge of what's
[0:42] hot in anyone hunt
[0:46] amen Matthew chapter 5 verse 38.
[0:52] I want to speak to the Lord willing upon
[0:55] persecuted Church
[0:58] A persecuted Church
[1:00] Jesus says now you have heard that have
[1:03] been said an eye for an eye and a tooth
[1:05] for a tooth
[1:06] but I say unto you that you resist not
[1:09] evil whosoever shall smite thee on thy
[1:12] right cheek turn to him the other also
[1:16] now drop down to verse 44.
[1:20] but I say unto you
[1:22] love your enemies
[1:28] let's go and let that one sing for a
[1:29] minute
[1:31] we're going to need some real material
[1:32] to make this one live Ain't we
[1:34] bless them
[1:36] that curse you
[1:38] wow
[1:40] do good to them that hate you
[1:43] pray for them which despitefully use you
[1:46] and persecute you
[1:47] that you may be the children of your
[1:49] father which is in heaven
[1:51] for he may get the son his son to rise
[1:54] on the evil and on the good and sendeth
[1:57] Reign on the just and
[2:00] the unjust
[2:02] we're talking about having some real
[2:04] bride material now to make this happen
[2:06] right here
[2:07] it's going to take some real genuine
[2:09] god-given material because listen to me
[2:11] very carefully this kind of preaching
[2:13] what we're getting ready to do right
[2:14] here this is not the kind of stuff you
[2:16] can get from Jake's and Osteen and Peggy
[2:19] and these guys most of these guys that
[2:20] will preach to you about a persecution
[2:22] they take it a whole lot different
[2:24] direction here they are in the spotlight
[2:28] on the television and Internet and
[2:30] everything everywhere you go they're big
[2:32] worldwide known figures and people like
[2:35] that I'm sure will take criticism from
[2:37] the media they'll take criticism from
[2:39] you know from other uh what's World
[2:41] calls haters These Days and things of
[2:43] that nature and I'm sure there'll be a
[2:45] population of those people that you know
[2:47] will just fall into the uh the sights of
[2:51] somebody that's going to be evil to them
[2:52] based on their personality and how
[2:55] visible they are but this little group
[2:57] that Jesus is talking about isn't people
[2:59] that are being persecuted because they
[3:01] got their face splashed all over
[3:02] television and the internet this is the
[3:05] little despised group of a little God's
[3:08] bride that's despised and rejected even
[3:11] amongst her own Brethren and her own
[3:13] churches amongst her own people and this
[3:15] persecution we're talking about isn't
[3:17] talking about things going viral because
[3:19] somebody didn't like you or found a
[3:21] video or a post or some kind of thing
[3:23] we're not talking about somebody getting
[3:24] on social media and ripping you to
[3:26] shreds because of something you said
[3:28] publicly we're talking about the people
[3:30] that simply hate like our sisters down
[3:33] going down through Walmart long dresses
[3:35] long hair and walking like a sister on a
[3:37] walk and so forth like that and
[3:39] despising them for their stand before
[3:41] the Lord amen let's let's pray together
[3:44] for the word before we get any deeper
[3:45] father thank you for the reading of the
[3:47] scripture we thank you for the truth
[3:49] we're so grateful Lord Jesus for your
[3:51] mercy for your love we cannot begin to
[3:55] express to you how we feel when we feel
[3:57] your presence coming into this place we
[3:59] know Thou Art the same yesterday today
[4:01] and forever and we are so grateful to
[4:03] you my Lord for all that you've done for
[4:06] us as your children we we are looking to
[4:08] you today for the great outpouring of
[4:11] the Holy Ghost that will take his word
[4:12] speak to us fathers were yielding
[4:15] ourself to you today we thank you Lord
[4:17] Jesus for brother Jesse and his church
[4:19] body and for allowing to be able to come
[4:21] back another time to be able to minister
[4:22] this little group we thank you for that
[4:24] Lord and our soul appreciative of the
[4:26] workers and the laborers here and the
[4:28] saints that are gathered May the Holy
[4:30] Ghost take us now into your hands like
[4:31] clay and speak to us as we commit
[4:34] ourselves to you in the name of Jesus
[4:36] Christ we pray and the Saints said amen
[4:39] and amen you may be seated may the Lord
[4:41] bless you really good
[4:43] sure thank the Lord for all of the great
[4:45] things he's done and I guarantee you
[4:47] that if we spent some time you know
[4:51] perhaps even just sharing testimonies
[4:54] and making the testimony say something
[4:57] to the effect of start at the beginning
[4:59] when you got saved and just go through
[5:02] all of it I mean really honestly a month
[5:05] wouldn't handle just what's in this room
[5:08] right here so many things that if you
[5:10] begin writing it down and making marks
[5:12] on papers and maybe get your laptop out
[5:14] of your tablet or something start making
[5:16] notes the things that God has done for
[5:18] you has been immeasurable and you will
[5:20] run out of time to start saying the
[5:22] things that God's done and how good he's
[5:23] been and imagine that's just what we
[5:26] know that's not counting what we don't
[5:27] know all of the things that he's
[5:29] protected us from and watched out for us
[5:31] and kept his hand to Mercy On Us in
[5:34] times that we didn't even know that
[5:36] there was a car coming our direction or
[5:37] we didn't know that that little cell was
[5:39] going to turn into cancer or we didn't
[5:41] know you know some little thing thing
[5:43] was going to happen this way or that way
[5:45] amen just like the children of Israel
[5:47] didn't know when God took them up to
[5:49] that death trap up there called the Red
[5:51] Sea that the reason he was doing and as
[5:54] the Bible records was to keep him
[5:56] encouraged because the fighting that was
[5:57] over on the North side was way worse
[6:00] than what they were going to see there
[6:01] and it goes to prove that the Lord knows
[6:03] exactly how to lead us every step of the
[6:06] way I trust him and I believe him to be
[6:09] the one that knows my pathway in this
[6:12] life and I've learned if I follow him
[6:14] and I trust him and I allow him to be
[6:16] the boss of my life great things take
[6:19] place whenever the holy spirit is in
[6:21] charge of what we do and you know when
[6:24] the Lord leads us in many directions
[6:26] often friends I know that what I'm
[6:29] getting ready to say sounds very strange
[6:30] compared to the regular trend of what we
[6:32] hear and cares charismatic churches and
[6:35] and the light but you know really when
[6:38] God leads us he don't always lead us
[6:40] from one's success to another and from
[6:43] one great Mountaintop to another but
[6:45] many times the Christian Life is full of
[6:48] failures full of distresses full of
[6:50] regrets full of broken pieces and broken
[6:53] Pathways and all of those little mean
[6:56] spirited things we got to put up with
[6:58] and let you see in whatever age you
[7:00] lived in amen it looked like the Holy
[7:02] Spirit would lead you in a way of
[7:05] nothing but prosperity and always on the
[7:07] mountain and everything going well but
[7:09] remember true character of God as Peter
[7:12] tells us in his book is not formed it's
[7:14] not shaped it's not made when everything
[7:16] is going well but true character of God
[7:19] is formed in the fires of persecution
[7:21] tribulation trouble and all of the bad
[7:24] stuff that happens and if I was to sum
[7:26] it up and make it really quiet really
[7:28] quick and just make the Run remark and
[7:30] we could go home and amen go find a
[7:32] place to eat chicken somewhere amen I'm
[7:34] going to say a Christian Life is full of
[7:35] trouble amen God bless you Church take
[7:38] the name of Jesus with you amen that's
[7:39] about all you need to know amen but one
[7:42] thing that we do understand stand is
[7:44] that yes the Christian Life is full of
[7:46] joy yes the Christian Life is full of
[7:48] prosperity and and great things of God
[7:50] yes that does come to a Christian but
[7:53] remember those are not the things that
[7:55] shape who you are they're not what makes
[7:57] you what you are if God blesses you with
[7:59] money or with health or some other kind
[8:02] of thing in a prosperous manner he does
[8:04] so because he can trust you when he
[8:06] hands those things over to you he does
[8:09] it because it's maybe for you to give to
[8:11] somebody else or to bless somebody else
[8:13] you know some people are so prosperous
[8:16] with happiness it looks like nothing
[8:18] ever gets them down amen but instead of
[8:21] us patting ourself on the back people
[8:23] saying boy you're the happiest fellow I
[8:24] ever met how do you stay so happy amen
[8:27] God give me a full bank account of
[8:29] Happiness so I could turn around and
[8:31] become infectious so I could spread it
[8:33] to you and to you and to you amen and
[8:36] help you feel a little bit about what I
[8:38] feel amen and this is what we've got to
[8:40] understand that the Bride of Jesus
[8:42] Christ has always been a persecuted
[8:45] group are you with me say Amen under
[8:47] those circumstances has the bride ever
[8:50] not been persecuted amen every step she
[8:52] takes every place she puts her foot the
[8:55] devil's right there to work against her
[8:57] because she is a part of the plan of God
[9:01] Amen walking in the will of God is an
[9:04] antithesis a contrary to everything the
[9:06] devil is
[9:07] and if you think when you woke up this
[9:09] morning that you were going to make a
[9:10] deal with the devil he leave you alone
[9:12] you leave him alone amen just always
[9:14] watch behind his back he keeps his
[9:16] fingers crossed when he makes deals
[9:18] right Satan has no intention of leaving
[9:21] us alone
[9:22] and you say amen he has no intention of
[9:25] not fooling with us amen I believe that
[9:27] when it comes brother Jesse the long
[9:30] time Christians amen Christians that
[9:32] have been in the service of the Lord for
[9:33] many years I believe they reach a spot
[9:36] you know where little things don't seem
[9:39] to bother him like they used to amen
[9:41] little mess up is along the way little
[9:43] stupid things that we do as humans
[9:44] things that enter our mind or what more
[9:46] we just repent and go on and don't worry
[9:48] about it amen I don't believe the devil
[9:50] puts a lot of effort into Christians
[9:52] like that to figure out how to trap you
[9:54] in little tiny things like that but I do
[9:56] believe that Satan will work for months
[9:59] and months and even years at a time for
[10:01] a Christian like that to set one trap
[10:03] just one that will be the thing that may
[10:06] take you down completely amen this is
[10:08] why we should always be on our guard
[10:10] amen no matter if it seems like a calm
[10:13] time a Peaceable time well the devil
[10:16] don't seem to be bothering me you better
[10:17] be worried amen you better be concerned
[10:20] amen you better be watching because you
[10:22] don't know what slang out Amen in front
[10:24] of you Satan may be working a scheme
[10:27] that he thinks will be the ultimate
[10:28] scheme to take you out of here amen and
[10:31] to destroy your walk with God little
[10:33] things sometimes when you come to a
[10:35] place of maturity don't bother you like
[10:36] they used to
[10:38] I remember when I first got saved uh you
[10:41] know June of 91 when I first received
[10:43] the Holy Ghost
[10:44] I I was uh I was a very sensitive person
[10:48] anyways and I was raised with the kind
[10:50] of nature of really sensitive about a
[10:52] lot of things it was tough but I was
[10:54] sensitive at the same time
[10:56] and you know I I could get deeply deeply
[10:58] hurt by people and they'd say things to
[11:01] me and hurt me just cut me right to the
[11:02] quick but yet put on a tough exterior
[11:05] nobody would ever know what bothered me
[11:06] and that's dangerous in a lot of ways
[11:08] because that's what builds up resentment
[11:10] and anger in people and as I told you my
[11:13] testimony many times that's what brought
[11:15] me to the spot I believe to where I had
[11:16] such hatred and anger built up in my
[11:19] heart amen that that I believe I could
[11:21] have been on the verge of being a
[11:22] violent person or something like that
[11:24] listen you don't have to be strong and
[11:26] look like Arnold Schwarzenegger to be
[11:28] full of demon power
[11:30] amen women sometimes little frail things
[11:33] the prophet talked about that girl that
[11:35] was insane from menopause that time he
[11:38] said had not been for the grace of God
[11:39] Amen he said I was able to get my foot
[11:41] on her chest and push away like that he
[11:43] said with all that demon power raging in
[11:45] her she could have tore me to pieces
[11:48] amen this is why in our hearts we have
[11:52] to be under we have to understand that
[11:53] that that God builds us in a certain way
[11:57] he makes us with a certain ability to
[11:59] serve him and to live for him and you
[12:02] know that said again me being a
[12:03] sensitive type person when I first
[12:06] received the Holy Ghost the nature that
[12:08] I had I was bothered by things that
[12:10] people didn't seem to care about
[12:12] I used to wonder about that man you big
[12:15] why don't you hey man grow up a
[12:17] little bit put your big boy britches on
[12:18] the kids tell me
[12:20] and I said well
[12:22] I don't know about that I feel a certain
[12:24] way about things that I can't overcome
[12:25] it you know one day I was reading the
[12:27] message of the hour where brother Mann
[12:29] was out there squirrel hunting like that
[12:31] it's every time he tried to hit the
[12:33] squirrel's eye he'd miss that eye he
[12:34] wanted that perfect bullseye on that
[12:36] animal he said he got so upset about it
[12:38] he couldn't decide by a tree and just
[12:40] cried his eyes out
[12:42] you know modern-day men would have said
[12:43] brother man was nothing but a back
[12:46] in his boxing days you better smile when
[12:47] you say that the Bible is a tough old
[12:50] boy don't kid yourself he was tough
[12:53] you know and here brother man was
[12:55] sitting there thinking that over and the
[12:56] Holy Spirit spoke to him he said yes
[12:59] you've got that kind of nature about you
[13:00] but think of it when it comes to the
[13:02] word how you are
[13:03] he said you're always wanting to hit the
[13:05] bullseye exactly every single time
[13:08] so being a sensitive type person when I
[13:11] first got saved least little things
[13:13] sometimes would make me fall into a
[13:15] place of repentance and in my mind I'd
[13:17] be apologizing to God about everything
[13:19] afraid maybe I moved a certain way in
[13:22] prayer we're going to finger the wrong
[13:24] direction in prayer got distracted too
[13:26] easily and maybe would he give didn't
[13:28] give the Lord my full attention
[13:30] and there was parts of me that struggled
[13:32] for a long time because of that kind of
[13:35] regimen
[13:36] and that lifestyle that thinking that
[13:38] thought life that I had it tormented me
[13:40] many of the days that I lived as a
[13:42] Christian
[13:43] and now I
[13:45] get a little bit older now and I'm
[13:46] serving the lord many years
[13:48] and it's not that I ignore sin or ignore
[13:52] the things that are wrong
[13:54] but those little old tiny sensitive
[13:56] things like that I come to find out God
[13:59] isn't as interested in it as I thought
[14:00] he was
[14:02] some of those little things that were
[14:04] habits to me or patterns to me they
[14:07] really didn't hold as much weight with
[14:09] God as I thought they did
[14:11] and you know the devil saw that nature
[14:13] in me as well
[14:14] so the least little things sometime he'd
[14:17] be on a straddle of my back brother
[14:18] Jesse wearing me out in one church
[14:20] service you can imagine being a preacher
[14:22] what that's like
[14:23] you didn't say it this way you didn't
[14:25] turn that direction at the right moment
[14:26] you didn't you know Crescendo your
[14:28] message just right
[14:31] every little thing
[14:32] seemed to bother me and torment me
[14:35] Satan knew that about my nature so he
[14:38] honed it and focused upon that part of
[14:40] me
[14:41] until I was able to get victory in my
[14:43] life and realize
[14:44] that you know if a man is standing there
[14:46] in prayer
[14:47] and let's say you have your hands up
[14:49] like this and say your eye goes to
[14:51] itching
[14:52] you know for me it was a I I had to
[14:56] stand there and try to fight that off
[14:57] until finally I had to answer my crazy
[14:59] eyeball
[15:00] why humanly I couldn't avoid it was
[15:03] bothering me but at the same time I
[15:05] didn't want to feel like I was offending
[15:06] the Lord
[15:07] oh it's a hard thing to do but yet that
[15:10] kind of nature to me made me serious
[15:12] about truth
[15:13] that kind of thing about me made me
[15:15] serious about the gospel and I observed
[15:18] and picked up on things to help people
[15:20] that other brothers would ignore
[15:22] that's one reason the Lord's given me 20
[15:24] years of full-time evangelism around the
[15:26] world Amen and people said with covet
[15:29] they said well you're probably gonna
[15:30] have to go get some work I said get some
[15:32] work I've been busier than I've ever
[15:33] been
[15:35] they said how could that be possible I
[15:37] said because I wasn't sitting around
[15:38] waiting on the phone for the big
[15:40] machines to call me I hit all them
[15:42] little churches that were already social
[15:44] distance before social distancing was a
[15:46] thing
[15:48] preaching the gospel is brother Jesse's
[15:50] got it back there in the pastor study
[15:51] it's a service to God
[15:54] this isn't about retirement this isn't
[15:56] about building up seniority this is
[15:59] about your service to God
[16:03] and for me you know there was a lot of
[16:05] moments in my life that I wondered have
[16:07] I gone crazy
[16:08] but I lost my mind
[16:11] but no what I realized now
[16:13] some 30 years now I realized that the
[16:16] Holy Spirit was training me for real
[16:20] fire
[16:21] because you see when the devil attacks
[16:23] you he doesn't always come at you
[16:26] with you know as we say in the Hollywood
[16:29] version of it with a pitchfork and horns
[16:31] and a red tail
[16:33] but he comes to you in subtleties
[16:35] sometimes
[16:36] little tiny things that you don't
[16:38] observe Jesus revealed to us that the
[16:41] way Satan moves is by little foxes
[16:44] you know the little fox the way it would
[16:46] kill a vine it would reach down because
[16:48] it wasn't tall enough to get the berries
[16:50] and things it would get down and chew on
[16:52] the very root of the thing and till it
[16:53] at the root a little fox a baby fox was
[16:56] actually more deadly and dangerous to a
[16:58] vine out there to a Vineyard than a big
[17:00] one was
[17:01] Hallelujah
[17:03] Satan knows how to approach
[17:06] the people that he's fighting against
[17:10] many of you I'm sure could testify that
[17:12] there were moments of your life to where
[17:14] there was such a seriousness
[17:16] when you first started serving God
[17:19] every little thing seemed like it was
[17:21] sin
[17:22] brother I'm called that like with Ruth
[17:24] he said she worked herself through her
[17:26] stage of legalism
[17:28] that's what we do we work ourselves
[17:30] through these stages of finding what is
[17:33] pleasing to God what is it pleasing to
[17:35] God
[17:36] until finally we reach a point to where
[17:38] we realize okay this is not as big a
[17:40] deal as I think it is and when a
[17:42] Christian reaches maturity and they
[17:44] start growing up in Christ the devil
[17:46] says we can't move the same way that we
[17:49] did before
[17:51] because you see the devil doesn't have
[17:53] an automatic updater like we do on our
[17:55] computers
[17:56] you don't know something needs updated
[17:58] and you're in the middle of a project or
[18:00] teaching school or whatever you're doing
[18:01] and all of a sudden Windows says and
[18:03] we're automatically updating
[18:07] the guy invented that little button
[18:08] better not meet me at the Pearly gate
[18:10] I'm gonna give him some trouble him
[18:14] I lost count of the times be in the
[18:16] middle of a class all of a sudden here
[18:17] come that automatic update guy
[18:20] Satan don't need that he watches human
[18:22] nature and before you even realize
[18:25] you've advanced he's already advancing
[18:28] his tactics studying you
[18:29] to see how you fight how you handle
[18:32] things which way you're going to go what
[18:33] directions you're going to handle things
[18:34] in
[18:36] Satan knows how to adjust himself
[18:38] to meet the challenge of what it is that
[18:41] you are presenting by your Christian
[18:43] life before Christ
[18:46] therefore the tactic that he fights with
[18:49] and how that he brings persecution
[18:51] against you
[18:53] will be in such a concentrated and
[18:56] strategic manner that you don't even
[18:58] realize you're in the middle of a fight
[19:00] when he launches it
[19:02] how many times has Satan come
[19:05] moved on people moved on Folks at work
[19:07] moved on people in stores
[19:10] that even come up under the extending
[19:13] the hand of friendship
[19:15] give that some time
[19:16] you find out sometimes in friendships
[19:19] will lead to ruination because they had
[19:20] bad motives in the beginning
[19:23] I told people at the church some some
[19:25] months ago that I think where we've made
[19:27] some of our biggest mistakes is
[19:29] Christianity is we've tried to have
[19:31] friendships with the world
[19:33] I have many Associates that aren't
[19:35] Christians but I can't call them true
[19:37] friends until they do the will of God
[19:40] getting too deep into friendships like
[19:42] that has always been the cause of many
[19:45] of the problems that people face in this
[19:47] world
[19:49] sure
[19:50] for example being a father or a mother
[19:52] you can be a friend of your child that's
[19:54] true I hear preachers say don't be a
[19:56] friend to them yes be a friend to them
[19:58] but don't forget you're also an
[20:00] administrator
[20:01] and it's your job to call the boss so to
[20:04] speak and to tell them how that life
[20:05] works and how things operate and as men
[20:08] our job as Leaders is to set the tone of
[20:11] that family and how things are going to
[20:13] operate
[20:15] Satan also knows the nature of how
[20:19] things fit together
[20:21] meaning that if you're a person that has
[20:22] always wanted a friend like brother
[20:24] Branham
[20:25] watch how that worked on that Prophet
[20:27] for many many years even after the
[20:29] opening of the seals he would fall into
[20:31] such deep depression thinking nobody
[20:34] liked him and he had no friends
[20:36] Satan would work on his mind
[20:39] and one of the way that he chose to
[20:41] combat it which I think is one of the to
[20:44] me it's the most interesting and simple
[20:46] and yet profound way is to handle
[20:48] something he'd just go through the
[20:49] parking lot and start looking at the
[20:50] license plates to see who all showed up
[20:52] to hear him preach that morning
[20:55] it goes to prove there's all kinds of
[20:57] material to fight with you he's got to
[20:58] be looking for it amen
[21:00] Hallelujah
[21:02] not realize that when Satan then comes
[21:05] at you as an enemy
[21:07] the reason that Jesus is advising us now
[21:11] to not resist evil he's not referring to
[21:15] us being just pushovers
[21:19] he's not trying to tell us that to be a
[21:21] real Christian means you don't have a
[21:23] stand for anything
[21:25] or that you don't have any kind of
[21:27] principle to fight for
[21:29] but what Jesus is referring to when it
[21:31] says here don't resist evil and turn
[21:34] your cheek if they Smite you on the one
[21:36] it's more a symbol if you will of the
[21:39] attitude we're supposed to have
[21:42] when we realize that some people get in
[21:44] the way of the devil's plan
[21:47] you heard of the middleman I'm sure
[21:50] some people become a middle man in
[21:53] Satan's scheme and don't even know it
[21:55] you know some people can get anointed of
[21:56] the devil quickly and not even know
[21:58] they're anointed of the devil
[22:00] as a preacher be going through something
[22:02] dealing with some kind of problem or
[22:04] some kind of circumstance and thinking
[22:05] to myself uh you know a great burden
[22:08] falling on me about the thing and
[22:09] thinking to myself how in the world am I
[22:10] going to fix this thing or solve this
[22:12] thing or whatever it may be and go
[22:15] visit a church somewhere I'd be
[22:17] preaching and sit down and have supper
[22:19] or sit down and have dinner or some kind
[22:21] of thing and somebody walk up and say
[22:23] something to me it's almost word
[22:25] verbatim or the thing I said in
[22:26] automobile
[22:28] they don't realize they're being
[22:29] anointed of the devil sometimes
[22:31] but they become middle men they get
[22:33] caught in the middle of Satan's scheme
[22:36] so Jesus is advising us to recognize
[22:40] who the Real Enemy was now listen close
[22:42] don't fail this
[22:44] the real enemy is not the one that did
[22:46] the smiting the dispute despising or the
[22:49] hating or the one that would do the
[22:53] cursing
[22:54] that's not the real enemy
[22:57] remember it is always just a spirit on
[22:59] your brother it's never your brother
[23:02] amen if they're truly children of God
[23:06] in their heart they don't want to do the
[23:08] wrong thing if they're true children of
[23:10] God
[23:12] I feel it getting tight because you've
[23:15] done picked up on where I'm heading and
[23:16] you know what I'm getting ready to do
[23:18] I'm getting ready to throw the door of
[23:19] your spirit wide open and is that scary
[23:22] that's all right you don't open it I'm
[23:24] gonna kick it in so you might as well
[23:25] get ready
[23:28] I know how you're feeling because I
[23:31] myself contain scars hold possess scars
[23:35] Within Myself
[23:37] friendships that turned sour people that
[23:40] said and did things betrayals
[23:42] two-faced type stuff
[23:45] things that people said one thing didn't
[23:46] exact I understand how that feels
[23:49] to be lied to
[23:52] to be told and held up in such regard
[23:54] and then behind my back be told what a
[23:57] scum of the earth I was sure those
[23:59] things hurt you
[24:01] a family member somebody was raised with
[24:03] that might be narcissistic
[24:06] selfish and self-absorbed all they cared
[24:09] about was you and they spent their time
[24:11] gaslighting you from one moment to the
[24:13] next making you feel like a complete and
[24:15] total worthless human being and yet at
[24:17] the very same time them getting deep
[24:19] satisfaction over making your life
[24:21] miserable
[24:23] as long as you bowed at their feet they
[24:25] didn't care what the result of it was
[24:27] sure
[24:29] people have been the product of abusive
[24:31] relationships
[24:33] husbands of abusing wives wives abusing
[24:36] husbands it does happen
[24:39] it doesn't always have to be physicality
[24:41] words are powerful
[24:43] men are made to be amateur creators they
[24:46] can create an atmosphere in that home of
[24:48] such tension
[24:50] oh you said that ain't right hold on now
[24:52] brother Adam is talking to a woman that
[24:54] has this dream
[24:55] and in this dream there's an eagle
[24:57] flying down she's standing in white sand
[24:59] and there's certain little events in
[25:00] symbolic form that happen and because
[25:03] there was a prophet on the earth to
[25:04] interpret them they brought their dream
[25:06] to brother random now when brother I'm
[25:08] told these dreams he didn't tell these
[25:10] dreams in the way that he thought it
[25:11] might be he had to see the dream itself
[25:14] and vision and then look for all the
[25:16] missing parts that they left out in
[25:18] order to tell them what the vision is
[25:20] amen unless a person could see a dream
[25:22] that way don't go by your impression or
[25:24] your feeling when somebody tells you a
[25:26] dream I think it feels like it might be
[25:28] you better stay away from that until you
[25:30] see the dream itself and how it actually
[25:32] operated you can't interpret it properly
[25:36] brother Adam said that God would speak
[25:38] without a prophet in a direct message
[25:40] like he did Joseph rather than symbols
[25:43] but because there was a prophet on the
[25:45] earth now watch how this fits together
[25:46] this poor lady brother Adam said was
[25:49] going around talking talking talking
[25:50] talking he said sister according to the
[25:53] dream you were in white sand everything
[25:55] is all right he said stop thinking about
[25:58] it you're making your whole family
[26:00] nervous
[26:02] because of this dream
[26:06] even a Christian can succumb
[26:09] to certain things of a spiritual nature
[26:12] and get so worked up about it and so
[26:14] excited about it they drive everybody
[26:16] around them crazy you might as well say
[26:17] a man it's the truth anyhow
[26:20] right
[26:21] and yet we got to realize that all of
[26:23] these things is the way that the devil
[26:25] uses
[26:27] tactics
[26:28] to catch us at a place
[26:32] where we're vulnerable
[26:33] and defenseless
[26:36] well say something that I want you to
[26:38] listen to carefully
[26:40] if I as a Believer ever let my guard
[26:44] down even once
[26:47] it may take years to get there
[26:49] but that's the very opening Satan's
[26:51] looking for
[26:52] and the moment he does it
[26:54] you're in trouble but for the grace of
[26:56] God things will not be good for you
[27:01] all would you say brother Ben that
[27:03] sounds exhausting being on my guard well
[27:06] this is the beauty of being able to
[27:08] surrender yourself to the Lord every day
[27:10] so you don't have to go around 24 hours
[27:12] a day and wake up in the middle of the
[27:13] night wondering okay am I all right am I
[27:15] right no no see that's that's where
[27:16] you're getting on the other side of
[27:18] things
[27:18] you're opening yourself up to all kinds
[27:20] of nervousness and all kinds of things
[27:22] like that what God wants you to do is
[27:24] just simply commit yourself and the
[27:26] final outworking of everything to his
[27:28] hands and let him be the one to take
[27:30] care of the business instead of you
[27:32] worrying about it day and night
[27:35] praise the Lord
[27:38] would you say that sounds hard right for
[27:40] you but there's anything too hard for
[27:42] God
[27:43] even do all things
[27:46] by him all things are possible with man
[27:48] maybe not
[27:50] some guy have a strong enough mind
[27:52] enough positive thinking he'd do all
[27:54] right for a little while but let the
[27:55] right circumstance come along all that
[27:57] positive turns to negative just as quick
[27:59] as it was positive right that's why mind
[28:01] over matter will never work we can never
[28:03] take a positive thought and expect that
[28:05] to bring birth to us amen we must take
[28:08] the word amen and place the word in our
[28:10] mind and let the word bring forth and
[28:12] power what is called and ordained to do
[28:17] right
[28:19] and yet at the very same time
[28:22] here Jesus says love them
[28:27] that are your enemies
[28:30] how am I supposed to love somebody
[28:32] that's hurt me so deeply
[28:36] how am I supposed to have genuine love
[28:39] for someone that was abusive or or
[28:43] just I put like a little blank like a
[28:46] little new season of how them filling
[28:47] the blank words go like that I was put a
[28:49] little blanket you just stick what you
[28:50] want in there
[28:52] you fill in your experience
[28:55] how can I love someone
[28:58] who's been so vile
[29:00] corrupt
[29:01] cruel
[29:03] the secret in loving a person like that
[29:06] is to recognize what motivated the
[29:09] person
[29:10] oh listen to me
[29:11] we're coming to this persecuted bunch in
[29:13] a moment but I'm going to get you down
[29:14] the runway on this before we get flying
[29:17] if I can understand that the motivation
[29:20] of much of the cruelty in this world
[29:23] comes from the devil and plans that he's
[29:25] executed against people who have been
[29:27] too weak to fight him
[29:30] then I can see them in a different light
[29:32] Ergo I can show love to them in a way
[29:35] that I'm not able to do if I see it in
[29:37] the light I put them in
[29:40] you see there's a lot of people that sit
[29:42] in church
[29:43] and fight the preaching of the word in
[29:45] their minds and their spirit because in
[29:47] their mind they're not really fighting
[29:48] God they're fighting their daddy
[29:51] there's a lot of people in church that
[29:53] can't get Victory become the pre with
[29:56] the from the preaching of the word
[29:58] because they're sitting there fighting
[30:00] mama
[30:02] when they see God they don't see God the
[30:04] Eternal the one that loves us the one
[30:06] that died for us the one that Rose for
[30:08] us the one that has given us everything
[30:10] we've got they see somebody
[30:13] 's face on him
[30:17] and this is where we've got to be
[30:18] careful not to blend together our
[30:21] experiences
[30:22] and put them back upon God because you
[30:24] see here's where the devil fights
[30:26] sometimes
[30:27] God is all-knowing and God is
[30:29] all-powerful and God can do anything he
[30:31] wants so what's the next words out of
[30:33] their mouth why didn't God take me out
[30:34] of it
[30:37] you know we used to have an expression
[30:39] down south I learned it as a kid Beggars
[30:41] can't be choosers
[30:44] when you've been placed on this Earth
[30:46] by the hand of a creator
[30:49] and he has laid out the plan of not just
[30:51] you but billions of people right now in
[30:54] this world seven billion people exist in
[30:57] this on this planet in the 21st century
[30:59] go back two thousand four thousand six
[31:02] thousand years now
[31:04] how many billions trillions quadrillions
[31:07] on and on you could go of people has God
[31:10] set plans for in their life down to the
[31:12] very minute
[31:15] what do you say a jot in the Tittle
[31:16] right down to the very shot and Tittle
[31:18] of their lives
[31:21] God has set the scope and the tone of
[31:23] who they are
[31:25] trillions
[31:27] just in the last two thousand years
[31:29] alone think of how many how many Souls
[31:32] that looks like
[31:34] and yet we say oh God the powerful God
[31:38] should make an exception for me
[31:41] see when we look at in the wrong light
[31:42] we become very selfish thank you we're
[31:45] very righteous
[31:47] we become very selfish thinking we're
[31:50] very justified in our way because as
[31:52] human nature as we've been raised in a
[31:54] society to believe that you know I'm
[31:55] important I know that's what they tell
[31:57] you when therapists try to get you past
[32:00] all of the problems of Mommy and Daddy
[32:01] and PTSD and try to get you over all of
[32:04] that uh you know trauma bonding and all
[32:06] the little things that come along with
[32:08] all of this psychological stuff that
[32:10] says step one know your importance I say
[32:12] they're Liars
[32:14] I say the best thing to do is realize
[32:17] without the grace of God I would be
[32:19] nothing amen don't try to make yourself
[32:22] something make yourself clay in the
[32:24] hands of the one that can do something
[32:26] for you
[32:28] right always remember the Way Up Is Down
[32:31] on the way down is up
[32:34] psychologists and smart people will tell
[32:37] you you've got to start seeing your
[32:39] worth well
[32:41] in one way I get what they're saying if
[32:43] God listen to me listen my exact words
[32:46] if God has placed something in me it's
[32:48] of value if the Lord has done something
[32:50] for me it's a value but other than that
[32:53] the Bible said my righteousness is
[32:55] filthy rags all that's good amounts to
[32:57] nothing
[33:01] people run under psychologists and my
[33:03] mommy did this and my daddy did that my
[33:06] uncle broke me and my cousin did this
[33:07] and that
[33:09] and after so many of those the
[33:10] psychologists have got to go visit
[33:12] another psychologist who's visiting
[33:14] another psychologist to solve his
[33:15] problems too
[33:17] or hers
[33:21] the great Warfare that is going on right
[33:23] now in an age where Jesus said love
[33:26] would disappear
[33:30] the very time when love would turn to
[33:33] hatred
[33:35] these words that he said two thousand
[33:37] years ago still ring true
[33:40] I said you love your enemies
[33:43] bless them that curse you
[33:45] do good to them that's despitefully use
[33:47] you and hate you
[33:49] and say all manner of evil against you
[33:51] why why would Jesus put us in such a
[33:54] precarious spot
[33:56] because he wants us to recognize the
[33:58] revelation of why it is happening
[34:03] it's not happening because
[34:06] you know some people got that attitude
[34:08] well if it won't happen to anybody it's
[34:09] going to happen to me
[34:11] you hear people saying it all the time
[34:13] anybody going to get picked on I'm the
[34:15] one that's going to get picked on
[34:17] listen Bobby you're not the only one on
[34:19] the planet that feels that way
[34:21] hello somebody
[34:27] for every one of you there's ten
[34:28] thousand saying the same thing in a
[34:30] foreign language just like you
[34:32] all right brother right
[34:34] Society man humankind whatever you want
[34:37] to say every single one of them have an
[34:39] attitude woe is me and Y is me
[34:43] and yet God doesn't want us to look at
[34:46] ourselves in that manner
[34:48] if I am to Love My Enemy the reason I Am
[34:51] To Love My Enemy is because God plays
[34:54] something within me listen that the
[34:57] enemy don't like
[35:00] Hallelujah he plays something of value
[35:03] within me that Satan puts a Target on
[35:08] and he comes after
[35:13] go read some of the self-help books
[35:15] these days
[35:16] this is what they said
[35:18] a lot of the ones that teach you to have
[35:20] a good mental health they call it
[35:22] every single one of them the way they
[35:24] say things
[35:25] see your value see your worth see that
[35:28] your opinion matters
[35:30] all right let's put that against the
[35:32] Apostle Paul and see if she checks
[35:35] Paul said everything I ever learned and
[35:38] everything I ever knew
[35:40] I considered it like dung
[35:42] save Jesus Christ and him crucified
[35:48] comes out of me he said it came because
[35:50] God separated me from my mother's womb
[35:53] and chose me to declare his glory in me
[35:59] but I'm afraid that we've got ourselves
[36:00] into a plot twist
[36:03] we've read so many of the good books out
[36:05] there
[36:06] that we've forgotten Satan's scheme
[36:09] is to get man thinking
[36:12] he's better
[36:13] than what
[36:15] he is
[36:18] the moment you go to believing
[36:21] that you got the World by the tail
[36:24] the moment you go to saying I'm not a
[36:27] bad guy after all watch out be careful
[36:31] now I don't mean you walk around and
[36:32] call yourself scum and villainy all the
[36:34] time and treat yourself like you have no
[36:36] Worth or value to God
[36:38] oh I'm terrible I'm this I'm of that no
[36:40] we just say them things because deep
[36:42] down what we're really wanting somebody
[36:43] to say to us is that you're not that way
[36:46] either side of it we're making excuses
[36:48] and we'll never find Deliverance in that
[36:50] come on preach to me now
[36:51] you'll never find Deliverance on either
[36:53] side of it
[36:54] the only way you can find Deliverance is
[36:56] to say God I am your creation you are my
[37:00] Creator and anything I'll ever be comes
[37:02] from your hand and your hand alone
[37:04] take me into your hands like clay and
[37:06] mold me
[37:08] when we can learn to surrender these
[37:10] elements to God then we can render the
[37:13] enemies powerless
[37:14] which is what Jesus was saying here
[37:17] by loving my enemy
[37:19] I render his plan of attack powerless
[37:24] because the whole purpose of an enemy to
[37:25] do something to me is for retaliation's
[37:27] sake
[37:28] but if I love him there's no retaliation
[37:31] come on oh that that should have clicked
[37:33] with somebody
[37:35] right if I bless them the purpose of the
[37:37] cursing was to put me in a spot to where
[37:40] I retaliate with a curse but Jesus said
[37:43] amen don't clear some bless them
[37:46] you're derailing their whole plan
[37:50] I'll give you a small example you ever
[37:52] had anybody come in work or something
[37:53] like that
[37:54] and they are in a foul mood
[37:57] miserable
[38:00] they see you in the corner smiling and
[38:02] happy
[38:03] singing a song
[38:05] airpods in or some kind of thing listen
[38:07] to gospel music and you're going on or
[38:09] whatever and they see you like it and
[38:11] they do their best to make you miserable
[38:14] do you know that when they leave and
[38:16] you're still smiling their plan failed
[38:23] amen
[38:24] and yet at the very same time we must
[38:26] realize how significant it is to
[38:30] recognize it wasn't that person it was
[38:33] the devil that moved on that person
[38:36] how did he move maybe not at that exact
[38:38] moment maybe this is training or a
[38:40] background or years of a plan Satan's
[38:43] executed against a family
[38:46] sometimes people don't even realize the
[38:48] devil's behind a lot of the reasons why
[38:49] they do some of the stuff they do
[38:52] some families have little sayings and
[38:54] cliches among the family you know I'll
[38:57] just give you a simple one it's going to
[38:58] happen to anybody it's going to happen
[38:59] to the neurons
[39:03] but do you understand this is the reason
[39:04] Paul advised Timothy and give him
[39:07] counsel to say put away on wives tales
[39:10] and fables of a man like that
[39:12] and genealogies
[39:16] or the southern people y'all just better
[39:18] you better ban this this next part from
[39:21] the south they're going to kill me if I
[39:22] get up across that Mason Dixon and
[39:24] that's one problem we got down in the
[39:25] South so much that loyalty to family
[39:28] loyalty to family family loyalty uh-huh
[39:32] you know what that's done for a lot of
[39:33] them southern people down there I live
[39:34] with and was raised with it's made
[39:36] nothing but a bunch of arrogant buffoons
[39:38] out of them
[39:39] because they will they will strain a
[39:41] night and swallow a camel when it comes
[39:43] to sin because it's one of their family
[39:44] members amen but Jesus said amen if a
[39:48] man puts his hand to the plow and turns
[39:50] around for even one member of his family
[39:51] to me hell is not fitting for a person
[39:54] like that
[39:56] right it's too good for them
[39:59] God give you your Founders I tell my
[40:01] girls all the time you are my gifts and
[40:03] he is my Giver
[40:04] when they're grabbing my britches leg
[40:06] and they're screaming at me please and
[40:07] crying tears in their eyes please don't
[40:09] go please don't go
[40:10] I love Omen as much as humanly possible
[40:12] that I can love on them I tell them how
[40:14] much I they mean to me and how much I I
[40:16] think of them
[40:18] but I always remind them you are my
[40:20] gifts and I'm going to serve my Giver
[40:26] genealogies
[40:28] well that ain't the way my mama believed
[40:31] it
[40:33] they don't realize Satan the enemy has
[40:35] executed a very well-laid plan
[40:39] he laid that little seed bed about 40
[40:41] Generations ago
[40:42] and they've kept it going to this very
[40:44] day and they won't let go of it to
[40:46] believe the word of God because it come
[40:48] from family
[40:51] just like that little story you hear
[40:53] sometimes it's kind of a little joke I
[40:55] guess
[40:56] and I don't mean it as a joke but just
[40:58] using an example about that lady that
[41:00] when she went to go do a Christmas ham
[41:02] she tried her big butcher knife and she
[41:04] cut the ends of it off and stuck it in
[41:05] that pan and cooked it up
[41:07] they were sitting down to eat and mom
[41:09] was there grandma was there and great
[41:11] grandma was there
[41:12] they're all having Thanksgiving supper
[41:15] or whatever they was having and and the
[41:18] youngest one spoke up and said Mama
[41:20] how do we cut the ends off this crazy
[41:22] hand
[41:23] I don't know ask your grandma
[41:26] she reaches across the table and takes
[41:28] her by the hands of Grandma why don't we
[41:30] cut the ends off his hands she said you
[41:31] know I'm not sure either honey
[41:33] great grandma's over here in the corner
[41:35] Let's go ask her they all gathered
[41:37] around she's sitting in a Barcalounger
[41:38] with a shawl up on her and then a
[41:40] blanket over her legs
[41:42] figure out how come we cut the ends of
[41:44] the ham off what does it mean what's the
[41:46] significance to it does it mean anything
[41:48] what's the purpose behind what kind of
[41:50] mystery does it hold
[41:53] in her Elder years she looked down upon
[41:55] all of them and said we were too poor to
[41:57] have a pan big enough to fit the ham we
[42:00] started cutting the ends off it so it
[42:02] fit in the pan
[42:03] and nobody ever told you all different
[42:09] how many Traditions family traditions
[42:13] have been handed down to us things that
[42:16] we do things that we believe things that
[42:18] we hold on to
[42:19] as gospel
[42:21] that ain't got to Speck of Bible or
[42:23] message behind them
[42:25] and yet we hold on to them
[42:27] not knowing our enemy
[42:29] has dispatched a well-laid plan
[42:33] because you see a thousand years to the
[42:35] devil means nothing
[42:38] Satan don't sleep you don't need a nap
[42:40] he don't need a vacation
[42:43] I'm hoping to God he has to take
[42:44] headache medicine when I get done with
[42:46] him but anyways
[42:48] Satan don't have to worry about time and
[42:51] the way we do is not created in such a
[42:53] manner
[42:54] so for him
[42:55] a thousand years is a blink of an eye
[42:57] nearly
[42:58] imagine watching all of the generations
[43:00] that made you
[43:02] knowing how you tick so to speak
[43:05] knowing the inner workings of your
[43:08] psyche your your watch if you will
[43:12] and laid that plan and they're knowing
[43:13] that it would catch generations of
[43:15] people well then here's the question as
[43:18] Believers with the baptism of the Holy
[43:20] Ghost at what point are we going to
[43:22] start doing what Jesus said then and
[43:23] that's cut the branches of this family
[43:25] tree all
[43:27] stop it right in its tracks and not
[43:29] allowed to proceed into our Natures into
[43:32] our speech into our thought patterns our
[43:34] thought life or any other spiritual part
[43:36] of us are natural
[43:40] you know for people that hate serpent
[43:41] seed and say there's no Bible to serpent
[43:43] seed and
[43:44] man wasn't no tree and the serpent
[43:46] wasn't no tree and yet they will pay a
[43:49] hundred and some dollars a month
[43:51] to get onto the internet
[43:53] to search out their family to read
[43:58] seems strange to me
[44:00] truth is always hiding in plain sight
[44:04] amen Jesus said so he'd hide it from the
[44:07] eyes otherwise and prude him
[44:09] and reveal it to babes such as would
[44:10] learn
[44:12] you are the fruit of your mother right
[44:14] and the seed of discrepancy brother said
[44:16] he sprayed his poison
[44:18] on them seeds back there in the Garden
[44:20] of Eden he said that's a reason why
[44:21] things are perverted today
[44:24] in a message we used to call it years
[44:25] ago hybrid religion but it's been
[44:27] renamed spoken words Original Seed
[44:29] as vocal Roots Original Seed brother
[44:31] Brands talks about the power of
[44:32] hybriding and what it meant to hybrid
[44:34] something together and how that Satan
[44:36] would take so much of this so much of
[44:37] that and hybrid until he forms his own
[44:39] church
[44:40] you imagine these people that and I feel
[44:43] sorry for these folks
[44:45] they go to the house of God and they
[44:46] shout and they'll run and they'll dance
[44:48] and they'll cry when they hear songs and
[44:50] they'll read the Bible and the joy will
[44:52] fill their heart and is lost and
[44:54] deceived as they can be
[44:57] not knowing that Satan was the one that
[45:01] orchestrated such a plan
[45:04] and when people fall into the realm of
[45:06] religion they've got to stop and think
[45:09] who is the enemy here
[45:11] and who is the hero
[45:14] in every story there is a hero
[45:17] and there's the anti-hero or the enemy
[45:21] God's story
[45:23] he is the hero of Life he's the hero of
[45:25] the Bride he's the hero of the Believers
[45:26] and Satan is the enemy that works
[45:28] against us our minds and everything we
[45:31] are our bodies
[45:34] you imagine the reason why we suffer
[45:36] things that we suffer in this body today
[45:38] is because Satan began working on the
[45:40] food system from the very beginning
[45:43] until he's got so much hybrid mess every
[45:45] which way you couldn't even eat organic
[45:47] food and not and it have the same effect
[45:49] that it would have 4 000 years ago
[45:52] people say glory to God I'll grow it out
[45:54] of the ground that ground you're growing
[45:55] it out of is just as perverted as the
[45:57] stuff you're getting at McDonald's
[45:59] all you say it's healthier it might be
[46:01] but it ain't going to stop you from
[46:02] dying and you better get that through
[46:04] your head before you get too overwhelmed
[46:05] with the things of this world
[46:07] bodily exercise profits a little we're
[46:10] looking for the gospel to take effect in
[46:12] our souls
[46:14] the body will change one day
[46:17] there's not enough multivitamins in this
[46:19] world to change what Satan's done
[46:21] there's not enough amen ice therapies or
[46:24] heat therapies or right you get the best
[46:26] exercises all of the peas the Seas the
[46:29] C's and the D's and put all the 40s and
[46:31] 30s next to him you want
[46:35] amen right out there and put any old
[46:37] kind of tag on what you want to do
[46:40] I'm not talking against health because
[46:42] I'm fat
[46:45] I'm saying that it's good but people too
[46:48] much put too much stock in things like
[46:50] that because they don't realize working
[46:53] in their mortal body is a bigger plan
[46:55] than they'll ever be able to solve
[46:58] the focus of our health and God help me
[47:00] when I say this big men like me
[47:02] shouldn't preach on these things it's
[47:03] almost hypocritical
[47:06] but the focus of our health should be
[47:08] Lord that I can give you the best
[47:09] quality years that I can give you
[47:13] truth of the matter is if God restored
[47:15] my health back the way I was when I was
[47:17] 18 I'd turn around and ruin it again for
[47:19] the gospel like I've done
[47:21] 20 years now beat my body up and down
[47:23] this country around these roads 60 70 80
[47:26] 000 miles a year that's just an
[47:28] automobile
[47:30] if I had good health I'd probably turn
[47:32] around and ruin it again
[47:34] all for the sake of the gospel and
[47:36] getting truth out
[47:39] but working in my members right now are
[47:42] things that I'll never be able to stop
[47:45] no
[47:47] just like I couldn't be stopped being
[47:49] born with that little English NORAD
[47:50] Viking nose
[47:53] just like you couldn't have stopped
[47:55] being born amen with all the
[47:57] characteristics and the features that
[47:59] come from your parents
[48:01] before you took the Breath of Life there
[48:03] was a plan a scheme laid out for humans
[48:06] just like you
[48:08] friends I hope the Digger the the the
[48:10] the deeper I dig down in this hole and
[48:12] the more helpless I make you feel that
[48:14] something raises up inside of you to
[48:16] recognize that's right brother man
[48:18] that's why we need the grace of God Amen
[48:20] and to surrender fully to the Lord in
[48:23] order to make it out of this world as
[48:25] Overcomers in the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[48:27] it's the only hope we've got
[48:30] doing it on our own will never get us
[48:33] out of the spot that we've been placed
[48:35] in
[48:36] this is the principle Jesus is sharing
[48:38] with us love your enemies
[48:42] take your vitamins and do your health
[48:45] and get your smoothies and your shakes
[48:46] and do your px40s and all that other
[48:48] stuff fine
[48:50] but keep your focus upon
[48:52] I only do these things so that I can be
[48:54] a blessing to the people of God and I
[48:56] can have good health for my family or
[48:58] something like that never get in your
[49:00] mind
[49:01] that there's anything we can do to fix
[49:03] ourselves that's in the natural what
[49:05] about emotional
[49:06] some people maybe even sitting in this
[49:08] room I don't know maybe listen online
[49:11] you can read a stack of these emotional
[49:13] self-help books like that right there
[49:15] you're never going to solve
[49:18] your problems by reading them books
[49:22] you might understand yourself better you
[49:24] might understand maybe the plan that's
[49:26] been set for you
[49:28] but once you see what's wrong with you
[49:31] and what's broken about you
[49:34] the only hope you've got after that is
[49:37] to take all of that Brokenness up and
[49:39] put it in the hands of almighty God
[49:42] it's a well-laid plan brother Jesse this
[49:45] is why I Must Love My Enemy turn my
[49:47] cheek to those that smack me and those
[49:50] that despitefully use me pray for him
[49:52] this is what Jesus is saying in other
[49:54] words you're powerless
[49:57] to fight on that side of it
[50:00] there's a quotation here they asked
[50:02] brother Brennan how to overcome a
[50:04] stubborn spirit and things like that and
[50:05] I've read this as Church thousand times
[50:06] I I I I don't mean to sound like a
[50:09] broken record but for whatever reason
[50:11] when I come back to Akron the Holy Ghost
[50:12] puts it right back in my nose somehow
[50:16] but in this very quotation he said I've
[50:18] met thousands that had that Spirit on
[50:20] the platform by discernment he said go
[50:22] back and find a father a grandmother
[50:23] grandmother somebody that had that kind
[50:25] of spirit you inherit it
[50:28] he said the only way to overcome it
[50:32] is take the opposite
[50:35] they asked brother rettenham you know
[50:37] how what do I do if I'm not one little
[50:39] selfish brat
[50:41] that wants their way all the time he
[50:43] said turn around do the opposite
[50:47] foreign
[50:50] yourself now
[50:54] he said if you want to hold everything
[50:55] you got turn on and give it back the
[50:57] other way
[50:58] what's he trying to show us not that we
[51:00] should be if you had a multitude of
[51:02] riches in your bank account doesn't mean
[51:04] start selling your cars and your stocks
[51:06] and your bonds and giving out every poor
[51:08] man you see on the street and taking the
[51:10] shirt off your back and living like a
[51:11] popper no no no
[51:13] we had a man like that many years ago at
[51:15] the church he just got started in the
[51:17] message and and um
[51:19] he was doing really pretty good and he'd
[51:21] trying to serve the Lord and be a real
[51:23] Christian and he hit a spot where he
[51:25] told he got all the brothers together
[51:26] and he said I want to tell you he said I
[51:29] just want everything out of my life
[51:31] that's not like the Lord
[51:34] and before counseling with anybody he
[51:36] said he was a very wealthy man
[51:38] he's a car dealer and things like that
[51:40] he made a lot of money selling cars
[51:41] businesses all over the state of
[51:43] Tennessee and things
[51:46] this individual absolutely stood there
[51:49] and told us Brethren I'm selling
[51:51] everything I've got half of it's already
[51:53] gone
[51:54] and before the years out I'll be a total
[51:56] popper in an effort to serve the Lord
[51:58] that's foolish
[52:00] thank God my pastor at the time brother
[52:01] Carol told him so he said that you don't
[52:03] have to do those things to be spiritual
[52:05] that's right
[52:06] if you're that one selfish little brat
[52:08] about giving away the thing of it is is
[52:10] not turn around and become a pauper
[52:12] yourself
[52:13] but it's the attitude that you would
[52:15] have about what you've got now listen
[52:17] carefully that
[52:18] talk about physical money to use it as
[52:20] an example of other things let's say
[52:22] you're a musician like me or a singer or
[52:25] a player or you've got other skills and
[52:27] things that you can do Jesse's a a
[52:29] god-called teacher on top of being a
[52:31] pastor and a minister of the Gospel
[52:33] you take his boy back there his talent
[52:36] is growing every time I hear this kid
[52:37] he's got something new that he's put
[52:39] into his music and I like it
[52:42] but you take these kind of gifts and you
[52:44] take these things that God vests in US
[52:48] eventually the
[52:50] seed line starts working on a man or
[52:52] woman
[52:54] arrogance and pride or some other kind
[52:56] of thing even the opposite of it being
[52:58] real downcast and real sad and
[53:00] that put on humility
[53:03] somebody compliments your watches I'm
[53:06] rotten no good I'm a spare tire quit
[53:08] lying you know you like what you're here
[53:09] and act like it say thank you be
[53:12] gracious move on
[53:16] oh hi hi I'm just not yeah I'm sure
[53:22] you can't call the comment folks
[53:26] and the point being is that if we're not
[53:29] careful we'll start holding on
[53:32] because of some
[53:34] thing in US
[53:37] I know many many gifted preachers
[53:41] that refused to get out of their barca
[53:43] lounger and put their sweet tea or their
[53:46] Cola down
[53:47] and go get themselves on a plane and go
[53:50] preach in a foreign country because
[53:52] they're not willing
[53:54] to go into that kind of environment
[53:56] good preachers
[53:58] and I've sat around the table and listen
[53:59] and say oh you ain't gonna get me on a
[54:01] plane like that why
[54:04] is it because you're the one selfish
[54:06] little brat that wants your way
[54:09] or maybe you said something to say Lord
[54:11] maybe I should surround and give
[54:12] everything I got go get on a plane and
[54:15] go preach to some people in the forecast
[54:19] there's many ways to look at this folks
[54:20] and you mind you at the time would
[54:22] expire before I'd even have a chance to
[54:23] even scratch it not even scratch it
[54:27] but again I'll just put that little
[54:28] blank in there and you can fill it in
[54:29] the way you see it
[54:32] Satan can use those very things against
[54:34] you and listen to quotation brother I
[54:36] said take some sister
[54:38] she gets saved she grows her hair out
[54:40] she looks in the mirror and all of a
[54:42] sudden she says man my hair I look I
[54:44] look beautiful
[54:45] he said then Satan jump on the other
[54:47] side and try to put Pride on her
[54:49] I said that's right you do don't you
[54:53] see what I'm trying to say to you is
[54:55] that the very persecuted elect
[54:58] her persecution don't always come with
[55:01] tanks running down the street and
[55:03] mushroom clouds all over the place I
[55:04] know people got this in their mind that
[55:06] the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to
[55:08] see such things as that those in the
[55:10] tribulation will experience some of the
[55:12] worst Horrors that Hollywood could never
[55:14] even put it on a screen there's not
[55:16] enough CGI power to demonstrate what's
[55:18] going to hit this Earth when the bride
[55:20] is taken out of here but you listen to
[55:21] me right now amen no man that loves his
[55:24] wife will put her through hell on Earth
[55:25] to try to prove her when he's already
[55:27] proven who she is
[55:29] the bride does not go through the
[55:31] tribulation period amen they'll never
[55:33] shut up God will take her out of here
[55:35] amen run out of here in the Rapture like
[55:38] Romeo and Juliet he'll take her in the
[55:40] middle of the nines
[55:43] people in the message building bomb
[55:44] shelters and stocking up on K rations
[55:46] and water and every time Walmart has a
[55:49] sale they go out with you know out of
[55:51] Sam's Club with carts of it getting
[55:52] ready for the tribulation period
[55:54] squeeze is coming they'll say
[55:56] well good for them I'm not planning to
[55:58] prepare them for a squeeze I'm planning
[56:00] on being popped out of here
[56:03] squeeze all right like when you're
[56:04] holding onto the soap to tight in the
[56:06] shower and it goes right out of your
[56:08] hand amen squeeze all right
[56:11] I'm preparing to get out of here well
[56:12] brother Ben don't you think we'll see
[56:13] any of the Crossovers so we might see
[56:15] some of the beginning influence of it
[56:17] but the bride does not go through
[56:18] tribulation and persecution of that sort
[56:22] she never will and it's not in God's
[56:24] plan for her too
[56:27] listen let me read that to you in the
[56:28] Feast of the trumpets remember said you
[56:30] said the church has to go through the
[56:31] persecution for the Perfection of it
[56:35] he said the blood of Jesus Christ
[56:36] perfects the bride
[56:39] he said see a man
[56:41] has found favor with his wife he don't
[56:43] puts her through a lot he put her
[56:44] through a lot of punishment he's already
[56:45] found Grace a mother
[56:48] and she found Grace with him
[56:50] right he said but notice oh I like this
[56:54] he said notice he said the persecution
[56:56] that struck those Jews during the
[56:58] opening of that Sixth Seal
[57:01] it came from the literal standpoint he
[57:03] said but to the Bride of the last state
[57:05] of come in the ecclesiastical standpoint
[57:09] all of those two hundred thousand
[57:11] thousand Horsemen that come out of the
[57:12] river Euphrates being led by their
[57:14] leaders Eichmann Stalin Mussolini and
[57:17] Hitler
[57:18] those four Angels loosed
[57:20] out of Euphrates River
[57:22] those same four spirits that attack the
[57:25] elect of God same for enemies
[57:29] remember even the church is led by four
[57:31] spirits
[57:32] the lamb the lion the ox and the Flying
[57:35] Eagle don't ever put that eagle on the
[57:36] ground he's a flying boy
[57:39] at a a good pastor friend of mine many
[57:43] many years ago brother Frank Prater was
[57:45] asking the church I was sitting on the
[57:46] front row
[57:47] and you see when you when you when you
[57:49] study a lot and I know you know a lot
[57:51] these guys like to catch you and things
[57:53] that they think you don't know he said
[57:55] what kind of Eagle was it and I said he
[57:57] was an eagle
[57:58] no brother Ben I'm ashamed of you
[58:01] I said what do you mean
[58:03] he said it was a flying eagle he wasn't
[58:05] EarthBound
[58:07] those same four living Spirits as living
[58:09] creatures lead the Bride of Jesus Christ
[58:11] Matthew Mark Luke and John leader
[58:13] straight to the book of Acts
[58:16] the salmon awnings was given to combat
[58:18] the four evil spirits and watch those
[58:20] four anointings headed themselves up in
[58:23] these evil men
[58:24] look at what they've done to them Jews
[58:26] during that second World War
[58:29] unimaginable things that people don't
[58:31] even like to talk about to this day
[58:35] and that same anointing
[58:37] has now moved again in the last day
[58:41] but on the bride it comes through the
[58:43] ecclesiastical standpoint now what does
[58:45] that mean let's hit that before we go
[58:47] home
[58:49] or go to supper I should say or go to
[58:51] dinner anyway
[58:53] in the South it's dinner time it ain't
[58:55] summer time it's dinner time
[58:57] will you say to lunch because I'm from
[58:58] Ohio it's at lunch
[59:00] but I was raised by Southern people I'll
[59:03] never tell a good Southerner that you
[59:04] get to have lunch I don't know what
[59:05] you're talking about
[59:11] but the ecclesiastical part is this
[59:15] it is the approach
[59:18] of man's Wisdom mixed with God's word
[59:24] sometimes that's conscious sometimes
[59:26] that's unconscious
[59:29] take some of these great preachers in
[59:31] the day
[59:32] I mentioned a few of them Jakes and
[59:33] Hagee and Osteen and you know I I like
[59:35] these guys I
[59:37] got no problem with them I'm not
[59:38] throwing off
[59:41] but they all have an agenda and they're
[59:42] all very visible and they all say very
[59:44] you know positive things you know
[59:47] this is my hour of power Jakes will say
[59:51] Osteen will hold up his Bible I am you
[59:54] know this is my Bible I am what it says
[59:56] I am that's true
[59:59] a lot of these things are good
[1:00:00] psychologically speaking they hit the
[1:00:03] mark for people that are hungry for
[1:00:06] answers
[1:00:07] right now
[1:00:09] you listen to me careful little bride of
[1:00:11] Jesus Christ if you claim to be the
[1:00:13] bride indeed you are if you are God's
[1:00:15] child
[1:00:17] the bride doesn't seek for quick rapid
[1:00:19] answers in line
[1:00:22] She lays in the fire for a long time
[1:00:25] answerless sometimes
[1:00:28] waiting on God's revelation
[1:00:30] of why they went through it in the first
[1:00:32] place
[1:00:35] we'll say this before we quit the world
[1:00:38] is looking for an explanation to things
[1:00:42] and it hurts them so bad when they
[1:00:44] really meet the Creator I mean really
[1:00:46] meeting
[1:00:47] and he basically tells them it ain't
[1:00:49] none of your concern right now
[1:00:51] I'll let you know when I want to let you
[1:00:53] know
[1:00:55] are my people passing from this life you
[1:00:57] know my my daddy I lost daddy be five
[1:00:59] years this August I didn't lose him I
[1:01:02] know right reside
[1:01:04] but when they go from you it hurts so
[1:01:07] badly
[1:01:08] and you think to yourself man I I wish
[1:01:11] this and I wish that and I think of ten
[1:01:13] thousand things that I wished I'd have
[1:01:15] done even better
[1:01:16] when my dad was living
[1:01:18] you know he died at 83 had a list of
[1:01:21] health problems like that the man liked
[1:01:23] to die 25 times through all the time
[1:01:25] running up here to Ohio come to see him
[1:01:27] because he wound up in the hospital
[1:01:28] again another dementia case another UTI
[1:01:31] another they found him out walking in
[1:01:33] the neighborhood didn't know what planet
[1:01:34] he was on and carried him over to the
[1:01:36] hospital and stuff like that
[1:01:38] but you know the Lord give me a
[1:01:40] consolation
[1:01:41] I got to thinking you know Lord when you
[1:01:43] took this man you didn't send me an
[1:01:45] email
[1:01:46] or a fax or a text
[1:01:48] you didn't sit down and carrier pigeon
[1:01:50] with a little note tied to his leg hey
[1:01:52] is it okay with you if I make this move
[1:01:54] in life
[1:01:56] God don't always tell us everything
[1:01:58] remember what he said even with Joseph
[1:02:00] down there in Egypt mind you here's
[1:02:03] Jacob this prophet of God we're talking
[1:02:05] about one of the prophets that God built
[1:02:06] the entire foundation of the Old
[1:02:08] Testament upon
[1:02:09] read the Masterpiece he's one of the
[1:02:11] corners of the great statue that God
[1:02:14] would build up he said the Four Corners
[1:02:15] that little block you know they set that
[1:02:17] statue on top he said you got Joseph and
[1:02:19] Jacob and these ones here's Jacob
[1:02:21] holding onto that coat for many many
[1:02:22] years thinking his boy was dead
[1:02:25] and brother Adam said see God don't tell
[1:02:27] us prophets everything
[1:02:29] he don't tell us everything
[1:02:33] now listen to this carefully please
[1:02:35] don't fail what I'm getting ready to say
[1:02:37] but let's say for example some of you in
[1:02:39] here are seeking for the Holy Ghost I
[1:02:41] don't know I'm just feeling led to say
[1:02:43] thanks so I'm going to save them I hope
[1:02:46] they land correctly and if they don't
[1:02:47] then God help me say them will they'll
[1:02:49] land that way
[1:02:50] but for those of you seeking the baptism
[1:02:52] of the Holy Ghost for seeking that real
[1:02:54] genuine experience from God
[1:02:56] your trigger point the thing that's
[1:02:58] going to lose you and give you the
[1:02:59] freedom you need to get there you're
[1:03:01] going to have to stop holding on to this
[1:03:03] God I need an explanation before I can
[1:03:05] give myself to you
[1:03:07] God don't have to explain to you why
[1:03:09] life has been bad God is not obligated
[1:03:12] to tell us why hell is broke around us
[1:03:15] and why people were mean to us and why
[1:03:17] life has been one Misery after another
[1:03:18] or why you never had a leg up or why you
[1:03:21] couldn't have been God don't ask an
[1:03:23] explanation
[1:03:25] he's not obligated to tell us why
[1:03:28] but on the other side of that
[1:03:31] this is where real humility comes in
[1:03:33] where we should get on our face before
[1:03:34] God and say God I don't know why but you
[1:03:38] are the reason that I even have a mind
[1:03:41] to even think it or consider it you are
[1:03:43] the reason why I am what I am and I give
[1:03:46] myself to you I don't need an answer
[1:03:50] I just need your grace
[1:03:52] Hallelujah
[1:03:54] I just need you
[1:03:56] to take the reins
[1:03:59] and overcome for me
[1:04:02] you listen to me I'm preaching to myself
[1:04:04] right here too
[1:04:06] sometimes as a minister
[1:04:09] especially with the message is readily
[1:04:10] available especially with the
[1:04:12] concordances and the books and the
[1:04:13] electronic and you can get on and and
[1:04:16] you know Google's a smart fella did you
[1:04:19] know that he's a pretty smart guy
[1:04:21] Google is a scientist Google is a doctor
[1:04:24] Mr Google is a husband a wife a cousin
[1:04:27] Mr Google is a physicist Mr Google knows
[1:04:30] how to shoot
[1:04:32] guns he knows how to do all kinds of
[1:04:34] things very smart fella
[1:04:35] got a lot of phds next to his name
[1:04:39] but you know my biggest problem with him
[1:04:42] a lot of the information he yields up
[1:04:44] ain't surrendered to the Lord
[1:04:47] he just throws everything in the bucket
[1:04:49] and leaves it for you to sort it out
[1:04:50] that reminds me the way the devil does
[1:04:52] us
[1:04:54] throws everything in our way and tries
[1:04:56] to get us to sort it out again
[1:04:58] and I say it in the name of the Lord
[1:05:00] It's a well-laid plan for you
[1:05:02] that Satan would put it in your pathway
[1:05:05] that you've got to figure things out
[1:05:07] before you can become surrendered
[1:05:09] hogwash foolishness nonsense and ain't
[1:05:11] nothing but a trap of the devil and I
[1:05:13] believe the Holy Ghost has exposed it
[1:05:14] this morning you should throw it in the
[1:05:16] trash can get rid of that over a
[1:05:18] ridiculous rotten thank you and start
[1:05:19] surrendering yourself on a daily basis
[1:05:21] and you watch and see if I speak in the
[1:05:23] name of the Lord your life will prosper
[1:05:25] over the one but once you do what I'm
[1:05:26] saying
[1:05:29] I'll speak it to you in the name of the
[1:05:30] Lord
[1:05:32] sure
[1:05:34] but the analytical mind wants to know
[1:05:38] yeah inquiring inquire the magazine
[1:05:41] Inquirer had that same idea inquiring
[1:05:43] minds want to know
[1:05:45] isn't that amazing
[1:05:47] as a preacher I need to know things
[1:05:49] sometimes sure
[1:05:51] I was telling the brother the other day
[1:05:53] that I got a friend of mine and
[1:05:56] this fella I love him God knows I love
[1:05:59] his God
[1:06:00] but he does this kind of stuff to me
[1:06:03] so-and-so had an affair with so-and-so
[1:06:05] and shot so and so and so-and-so robbed
[1:06:07] a bank but I ain't going to tell you no
[1:06:08] names I don't want to get any
[1:06:13] and I told this other friend of mine
[1:06:15] he's a mutual acquaintances of the
[1:06:16] brother we were talking about this thing
[1:06:18] and I said yeah it drives me crazy too
[1:06:20] I said to me if you're going to go that
[1:06:22] much into detail you better give me a
[1:06:23] name because now I'm wondering which
[1:06:25] person you're talking about I got 40
[1:06:27] just like them I know could be potential
[1:06:29] suspects of what you just said
[1:06:32] tell me your name or don't tell me at
[1:06:34] all
[1:06:35] but you know that's okay as a minister
[1:06:38] sometimes you need to know those that
[1:06:39] labor among you you need to know what
[1:06:41] they're all about pastors have to be
[1:06:43] nosy sometimes people I know you don't
[1:06:44] like it but they got to be
[1:06:48] and when you see a pastor Like Jesse you
[1:06:50] see Jesse asking questions or digging
[1:06:52] into your life quit sitting there
[1:06:53] getting insulted at him be thankful
[1:06:56] that your Shepherd cares enough about
[1:06:58] you
[1:06:59] to try to figure out a plan because you
[1:07:00] see a real Pastor takes information
[1:07:03] and he goes to God with it and say lord
[1:07:05] it's a puzzle for me
[1:07:06] and I don't have a picture on the box I
[1:07:08] don't know how to put these pieces
[1:07:09] together but I've done my best to try to
[1:07:11] do my homework to find out what I can
[1:07:13] about this person so that I know how to
[1:07:15] approach their problems
[1:07:17] now that happens sometimes you got to
[1:07:19] make inquiries and ask people questions
[1:07:22] oh God Almighty people get so mad at you
[1:07:27] but if they care about you
[1:07:30] sometimes they need to ask a question
[1:07:33] sometimes they got to know
[1:07:35] but then as you know brother Smith there
[1:07:37] are times that his ministry
[1:07:40] that you avoid asking the questions
[1:07:45] because sometimes people will lie right
[1:07:46] to your face you know what I do
[1:07:48] sometimes
[1:07:48] I go to alone I go to a very lonely
[1:07:51] place or a quiet place I'm trying to say
[1:07:52] not lonely but quiet and alone place
[1:07:55] with God and I start talking to the Lord
[1:07:56] about that person
[1:07:58] and God will show me something about
[1:07:59] them something they said a word they
[1:08:01] said nobody would have ever picked up
[1:08:03] including me on that word meaning what
[1:08:06] it meant but God will take that one
[1:08:07] thing and show me 40 things about their
[1:08:09] life
[1:08:11] and I know how to approach them I know
[1:08:12] how to deal with them
[1:08:15] and other things they're saying not to
[1:08:17] say I've had people say to me through
[1:08:19] the years and I don't mean this an
[1:08:20] exalted way but I'm just being truthful
[1:08:22] and saying that it's like it is
[1:08:24] I've had people say to me I can't
[1:08:26] believe you dealt with so and so how did
[1:08:28] you know because I'd spent a lot of time
[1:08:29] in prayer about them
[1:08:31] I didn't just willy-nilly go talk to
[1:08:33] them I spent a lot of time talking to
[1:08:34] the Lord about him
[1:08:36] and God show me approaches and how to
[1:08:37] say things now they're always that way
[1:08:39] God I wish it was
[1:08:43] a lot of times I'd save myself a lot of
[1:08:45] trouble if I would have just you know
[1:08:48] and waited on the Lord about it
[1:08:52] but sometimes as a preacher you got to
[1:08:54] know but then there's been times
[1:08:56] or I'll go to the Lord and ask about a
[1:08:58] situation and God will just look at me
[1:09:03] you know what I've learned to do
[1:09:08] if it's not for me to know
[1:09:10] then I'll let you do your job
[1:09:13] because I figure big as he is smart as
[1:09:15] he is intelligent as he is good as he is
[1:09:18] I figured there's something I need to
[1:09:19] know he'll probably tell me
[1:09:21] and I probably don't even have to ask
[1:09:23] him
[1:09:24] they just tell me when it's time
[1:09:27] analytical thinkers you linear people in
[1:09:30] this room I'm eyeballing you wherever
[1:09:33] you may be
[1:09:35] don't get so hung up in that that when
[1:09:37] it comes to God you have to get 42
[1:09:39] questions solved
[1:09:41] before the Lord can move for you all you
[1:09:43] do is assassinate your faith that's all
[1:09:45] you do
[1:09:46] this Faith don't come by what you see or
[1:09:48] hear faith comes by faith hearing the
[1:09:50] word of God believing things that you
[1:09:52] don't see things that you don't hear
[1:09:54] things that you don't understand
[1:09:56] one of the first tests that I believe
[1:09:58] God put on me when I was a young
[1:09:59] Christian I just come out of the water
[1:10:01] being baptized I was still sitting on
[1:10:03] the blankets of the towels I want more
[1:10:04] that come out of the water who's riding
[1:10:07] home
[1:10:07] and the Holy Spirit my mom and dad was
[1:10:09] in the front car and the Holy Spirit had
[1:10:11] spoke to me my Bible was laying over at
[1:10:13] the sidelight and uh and I had stuck it
[1:10:15] Over Yonder you don't want to sit in the
[1:10:17] car and the Lord supported me told me
[1:10:19] get my Bible and I grabbed it and pulled
[1:10:20] it over and as I held up my hand the
[1:10:22] Lord said open and I opened it up and
[1:10:24] felt Isaiah 34. come near you Nations
[1:10:27] here in Harkin for the ignination of the
[1:10:30] Lord is upon his armies and the fury
[1:10:32] upon the Nations and it went on just a
[1:10:35] little bit and the Lord said now stop
[1:10:37] tell me what you think it means
[1:10:40] and I I said to the Lord as purely and
[1:10:42] as innocently as
[1:10:44] sweetly as I could say the only thing I
[1:10:46] knew to say to him but Lord
[1:10:49] said even if you get it figured out you
[1:10:51] still might be wrong
[1:10:53] I don't know what I would say to you
[1:10:54] about it Lord It's Your word you know
[1:10:56] what's truth I don't
[1:10:59] you know for 25 years that thing
[1:11:01] bothered me
[1:11:02] I wondered why did he ask me that way
[1:11:04] what was it about I asked many different
[1:11:06] preachers about the scripture itself
[1:11:07] tried to look it up in the message
[1:11:10] run around never even read from that
[1:11:11] chapter
[1:11:13] I wandered and wanted and wanted until
[1:11:15] one day I was preaching
[1:11:16] and I was preaching about this very
[1:11:18] thing that sometimes God just wants to
[1:11:20] see if you're willing
[1:11:22] to not put your own thoughts in your own
[1:11:24] mind but just surrender and let him have
[1:11:26] his way
[1:11:28] and while I was preaching that the Lord
[1:11:29] put that story back in my heart and I
[1:11:31] shared it with the people and it come
[1:11:33] open to me just as clear as a bell
[1:11:35] he was testing me at the very beginning
[1:11:36] because he knew he was going to call me
[1:11:38] just about a week or so later to call me
[1:11:39] to preach
[1:11:40] I mean I'm talking I'm still wet with
[1:11:42] river water and he's calling me to
[1:11:44] preach
[1:11:45] but he wanted to see
[1:11:47] when it comes to the word am I going to
