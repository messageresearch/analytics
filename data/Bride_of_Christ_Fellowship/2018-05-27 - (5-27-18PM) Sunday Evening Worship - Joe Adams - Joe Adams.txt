of righteousness Lord an oracle of God this evening you as speak with power more you would speak with authority this people boy and you would anoint the ears of the listener to hear what the spirit would say in the way that it would be say father we just want to give our time to you this evening want to give you the praise and honor Lord that you've allowed us to come back together once again we pray Lord you had the preeminence not only in this service but in each and every life each and every heart or at each and every situation that we wouldn't do or may you had the preeminence father may we not lean to our own understanding Lord may we lean upon thee O God O Father we thank you now we just commit to time to you commit this service down to your care for we ask it in Jesus name Amen if you have your Bibles as I said this morning we spoke on faith to speak in this evening I want to speak on your time to speak so hopefully this morning we elevated your face something was said that would elevate your faith to speak the words of God to have the authority and the confidence that which you ask God is able to do it so I want to give you more ammunition for the devil for when he comes to tell you that you're just a little nobody you're never going to amount to anything but God's giving you the jurisdiction in this hour to speak on his behalf and I just want to say it was a wonderful time at a wonderful time this morning in the service I felt the Liberty to speak I didn't feel any restraints or anything and you know when you travel to different churches and you preach sometimes there's that ice breaking service where you kind of have to crack the people open or they crack you open or somebody's getting crack nevertheless you know and ice is broken and we can just enter it into a warm fellowship you know I want to say as a testimony to brother Jesse into the church here that it's an easy place to come in after many years I'm not being here many new faces and just stepping up and being able to preach and have that Liberty and just feeling that just that easiness to be able to just lay the things out and not only that but have there were people to receive and pull from the gift of God if you just think you don't get that in a lot of places I also want to thank brother Bob Zimmerman for coming back bringing this family back and we welcome you here and trusted you can find a solace in a time of refuge a place that you can you and your family can attend service I know you're going through a situation we're praying with you on behalf of that we got something good for us lined up with the Lord always has something good for us if you come expecting I believe God has something special in John 14 we're gonna read a bunch of scriptures then I'll have you be seated but John 14 and verse 12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me were going back to the principles we spoke about this morning and the works that I do shall he do also and the greater works than these shall he do because I go into my father and whatsoever ye sow asking my name that I will do that the father may be glorified in son if you ask anything in my name I will do it first John 3 and verse 22 and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight John 15 and verse 16 you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name he will give it to you John 16 and verse 23 and in that day you shall ask me nothing but verily verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name he will give it to you hitherto have you asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full john 16 and verse 26 and that day you shall ask in my name and i say not unto you that I will pray unto the father John first John 5 and verse 14 and this is a confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us so anything that you ask I want you to know this even that he heareth us you can be seated this evening you may ask yourself oh brother Joe these are a lot of good scriptures a lot of good things that you mentioned here but you know Who am I to ask God who come out to come before God and ask God you know these things John 15 and verse 7 tells us that if you abide in me and my words abide in you then you shall ask what you will and it should be done unto you so if you abide I mean that the abiding there is not getting up every morning in a certain time and you got to read your Bible for several hours are you praying so much this way and you're abiding in Christ you're listening to the tapes but this word abiding there means it means for us to be filled with the Holy Ghost so you're abiding and may your body my spirit and my spirit is abiding in you so we find out when Jesus was here that Jesus did many many things because he had faith in his position he knew who he was and brother manna makes a statement and I said he knew who he was therefore he had faith faith could produce when it knowed who he was and if we abide it goes in if you abide in me and my word in you then you know who you are ask what you will and it will be given so we find that faith will produce again in this day if we can only recognize who we are if that makes a me says now wouldn't that be wonderful tonight if everybody come in a prayer line and say I'm a Christian wouldn't that be nice everybody just come to church and say I'm a Christian lissa prayer line that come to church excited about the things of God we're looking back over their life they see what they used to be you know and what the things they used to do and they realize that you know they don't desire to do the things that they used to do anymore because why because God got ahold of that heart God changed that life God change their nature and they no longer desire the things that they used to do but here they come into the church says they wanna thank God I'm a Christian I was telling brother Jesse last night I do a lot of work with the young people back home and you know until the young people say there's never been a day since I gave my heart to the Lord well before I became a mrs. believer I said there's never been a day that I ever woke up and say you know what I want to go back to them what I was doing I want to go back to that lifestyle you know I've never had that desire and I said when God really gets ahold of your heart God will completely change your desires gotta change that nature you're no longer desire the things of the world you know I'm gonna draw to puff down a cigarette or drugs or whatever it may be but no God changes your dessert and he puts your desire for this word that's abiding in Christ when you put when those kazars have been changed and you hunger for the word of God that's when your body Christ in that words of binding in you cuz they keeps you from the cares of the world but wouldn't it be nice if a Christian came in that prayer and I say I'm a Christian I have no condemnation I know that my heart condemn me not and something tells me that tonight is the end of my supper or wouldn't that be nice tonight church it's coming to the house of God's eye you may not know why you came but you're back anyway it something's telling stuff something's do remind me this is my night I'm gonna walk out of here different I'm gonna get my need met tonight something's telling me that tonight he goes old then you're gonna do it he says you'll go away here with something no matter how much it coming in emotion or how much you do it you will work until perfect faith have manifests in itself and identified itself in you as a substance so you can come tonight believing that you're gonna walk out of here different believing that the case has been settled believe that the situation has been under control and God's going to make sure that when you walked out you had the faith to mess that word and you'll walk out a different person he goes on and when there he goes and when it's there there's nothing gonna shake you from it when what's there when that faith is there there's nothing gonna shake you from it all the head the hell's the hell's on your 12 but I'm gonna tell you when when the enemy comes in like a flood Johnson are raised up a standard against it I'll raise up a word against it I'll raise your faith up to believe later than what you can see he said now if you had cancer and the doctors told you yesterday you're gonna be dead before Monday morning all your heart all your respirations go the cancer is eat you up your blood streets completely cancer whatever it is and something come with the substance of genuine faith perfect faith was made son to see he goes your laugh in the doctors face you know what I didn't finish telling you this morning about sister Orlando no let's let's just in our church that had that cancer when she went to the doctor and and they did that pest and it was completely clear the doctor says look we never had this happen before he didn't know what to do so he sent her to Houston to MD Anderson to a specialist clinic because they wanted to find out what happened how did this they've never had somebody coming to only for treatments oh when I got down the MD Anderson they were Saturday like well we don't know what to do we've never only done four treatments and one of the patients get completely delivered but all below us she can laughing Devil's face the devil was telling you gonna die you're gonna go into a grave you're gonna leave your husband a widower you'll eat a cheese box let me tell you God is able to change the devil's plans it's either God they will rewrite your situation and rewrite the script and come by our way and we see God move we seen God change the scenario and now she can laugh in the devil's face Oh Church that's what it's about having the faith to believe in to hold on to it no matter how you feel she was weary and body torn down didn't have enough Street but nevertheless there was at service before she went to the doctor she jumped up out of her puke and ran around the church two times as a victory lap some got ahold of her what was it faith come down no it's already done I've already heels you hearties deliverance you you're not gonna go through this anymore here - a fake can rise up tonight it's telling you the same thing this situation already settled you had to go through it anymore take me of my word Church hallelujah just take God at His Word well Who am I brother Malachi give me a little bit more volume if you can push it up if it's not too loud on the people say brother Who am I to ask things from God I'm just a nobody now let me just be honest you've ever said that are the devil's ever told you there it's okay we're friends if not we'll be friends for the service is over with well Joe I'm just nobody that was telling you his he told you that probably so some of you that today didn't know something that this week you know first of all you're not just a nobody you're the Queen of Heaven you're the apple of God's eye you're the sole reason of Jesus going to a cross every prophet every preacher every message that ever been preached and this earth has been for you in this hour the part of God will say they that you are the mist of Christ revealed and he said everything every mess ever came was to make sure that he would get that bride and so that bride that's who you are tonight you're the very mystery that very cost of everything that God's ever done he's done it with you in mind you're not just a nobody that's the devil talking to you you're somebody you're the bride of Jesus Christ you're the word of God made flesh in this hour that's what the devil wants you to believe he doesn't want you to recognize your position he doesn't want you to recognize the power and the authority that you have over him did y'all hear that I said he does I want you to recognize the power and the authority that you have over him as a son and daughter of God well good no matter how you feel go to first John 3 and verse 2 first John 3 and verse 2 well I don't feel like a son well you know what there's days I don't feel like a son there's days I don't feel like preaching Thursdays I don't feel like this but I ain't going based on my feelings but the Bible says beloved how many other beloved this evening come on in every hand at least every adult hand beloved now we are the sons of God come on that's the were written about you tonight now we are the sons of God you do not yet appear what we shall be but I know who we know that when he shall appear we're gonna be just like him Oh Cory to God tonight church that was telling you you got this failure and you got this boat and you don't feel like this it ain't based on how you feel and then based on your mistake it's based on the word now we're sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know I said I know tonight when I shall see I'm gonna be changed to me just like he'll I've never lied on the whole human ability I'm not relying on my genetic makeup how well I told us saith the Lord I'm relied on his word what His Word says about me seeing a son of God as a son of God you have more and authority over the devil in the messages kinsman-redeemer paragraph 168 now sons and daughters who has the most power before God what is an angel an angel is a servant that's right they're his servants what are you his son and daughter who has the most power in heaven than a sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing by his right side the sinner that's been saved by grace has more authority in heaven than the archangel they stood by his side without seeing because he's a son and a son has more authority than the servant of course come on church do you recognize who you are you're an adopted son of God what do you mean by adopted look it's not like you go the adoption process in the Bible's not talking about you go take somebody else's kid from some other family and bringing it to your family and adopted but no it's a man he would take his own son when his son got to a certain age a certain responsibility he would adopt that son into the family and now the Nate that saw his name on the tape book was just as due to the father's name now he took care of the situation just like the father I'm gonna tell you tonight you've been adopted his sons and daughters of God and your name on the tank book is just as good Papa God's your name on the tape of The Devil's telling you air you can't even write your name you can't even spell your name you need to know how to say your name let me tell you tell that devil where to go back to the sinner that's been saved by grace has more power and more authority than the Archangel bengay bro then Michael they were moving you got more authority then they do who's never seen you tonight Church then recognize I possess that kind of power I'll possess that kind of authority oh there are you afraid to speak the Word of God why are you afraid to speak what you have neither when God's granted you the power and authority to use his name he says now we forget who we are or we forget what we are we forget many times what made us what we are after we become what we are then we forget how we got here oh let me tell you don't ever forget who you are Church let me encourage you tonight no matter how you feel no matter how insignificant you may think you're never forget that you are the bride of Jesus Christ let never may tell you you've got this failure you may got you have this fall but that doesn't matter how many failures you got how many phones you got the Rose Garden occurred you missed Jesus Christ it stayed to your Phoenix yes I am the Lord God God I am miss Jesus but I am the embodiment of the word in this hour don't forget who you are and don't forget who's you are let me just say you're not anyone just anyone not just anyone can receive the distinction of being the bride it's only for predestinated predetermined people you can't make yourself bride you can't make yourself not bride if God foreknew you in the back part of his mind and no matter how many Devils or he'll wage war against you you're gonna become manifest and God's gonna hold that door Grace open into that last shot that last order God comes in there because there'll be he's not gonna lose one you and I may lose what we may leave one behind I would say God I never left one behind he has enough Laura for his children that he's gonna leave the ninety-nine sheep and go after that lost sheep what about you tonight what about your knees tonight talking about a loving God cares so much about you that he's told you miss Jesus Christ who says now this may choke you to death but didn't you know that men that are sons of God are a mature God's you know the message today sometimes I may choke some of us and even in the message haha my god I don't feel like a god well you need to quit living below your god-given privileges you need to start recognizing who you are today if we're amateur gods and we have a domain we have a kingdom the rule of and I'm not asking you to go over it to Egypt or Egypt England and dethrone the little Queen over there and we got the little touches that just got married and all this stuff we don't we're not talking about that kind of royalty in that kind of Kingdom but no you got a domain some of us in your home how can you go expect your rule over there when you can't hear all in your own home it's kind of we be able to create the right atmosphere in our own home we pick the right environment in our own home because you know either they would love to come in let's specially on Sunday morning when you got three plus kids bro Jesse can testify you got three or more kids there's coming a little bit of confusion on Sunday morning this one's gonna be at that one and that was gonna be a mama momma's gonna be a pop and it's gonna be a whole cycle come on somebody some of you got kids where you brother bang you and be there for too long she's just a baby right now wait till it gets a little bit older and you gotta know when another woo is coming Oh but yeah the devil was to get here and get here but you we as the spiritual leader in the home have to change the atmosphere and we have the power given to us we have the authority given to it to say the right words at the right time to create the right atmosphere that's the Dominion that you're over tonight Church ain't gotta go --speed squirrels and doing says but speak that storm in your house swing it out of there you've got a need a gun to combine the healer speak to that thing oh my god come by and bring a healing cut he said in mark 11 whatsoever you shall say or whosoever then who whatsoever you shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things shall come to pass then he shall have whatsoever he saith he shall have whatsoever he saith I'm gonna say that one more time he shall have whatsoever he saying what do you saying brother I'm

mountain there many times we think oh it's a great big proverbial phrase something that's very hard to endure something great to get over but let me tell you God put this in there because he knew somebody wasn't gonna overcome the mountains in their life God's gonna somebody's going to take this word it's gonna be a reality no mouth is going to stand before them and just thrown it straightness in its beauty in its magnificence and it's so hard to get over you know I go up to a mountain I look at my game no way I ledgers no way I can't walk a million days and I'll never get over this mountain it's too treacherous it's got snow in the very top it's got rugged cliffs and they said no but you know what I can go get to an airport and I can get on a plane and also roll that mountain what do you say for though you get color of that anointing one time you get caught up and got a lift you up on eagle's wings Oh thus saith the Lord and you'll fly right over your Mountain that's not sick there's no way for you to get over me there's no way you get around me I don't know when you get to me I said oh yes sir is I made an eagle I've got an American Eagle out there and Delta Airlines and United and we're go for your turkey no bath you can stand before you if you recognize your sonship and your position and the son and daughter of God see if we'll speak the word in the faith then that word will have to materialize I hope I'm not shouting too much then I'll scare one baby out of here she hungry see if we speak the word in faith then that word will have to materialize because the descriptions already said whatsoever he shall say then he shall have whatsoever he's saying we've fought here in the scriptures there was a man one day was in a need he was in need of God he was a need a little bit more light Joshua we're concerned here in Joshua 10 I want to go through this force this evening my brother said I could take my time so y'all you always got to bear and grinning

kings of the MRI see that drilling the mountains are gathered together against us so Joshua's ended from Gilgal he and all the people of war with him I hope I got people to war with me this morning or the senior and all the mighty men of valor not cowards this evening but mighty men about me that are ready to take God at His Word in the Lord said unto Joshua fear them not color somebody the Lord

condition is tonight but it doesn't matter God's already giving you a word of assurance I've already bestowed upon you the power that you need look here in just 14 and verse now Joshua there 14 unto them suddenly and he went up from Gilgal all night and the Lord ISKCON fitted them before Israel and slew them with a great slaughter it give me if God would do that for Joshua what would he do for the bride come on church wake up and smell the coffee I'm telling you God is in control tonight and he chased them all along the way and they go other to Beth home and he smoked in to Ezekiel in Makena let me tell you God is here to fight your battles you have to worry about the condition you don't have to worry about the situation Saad is here tonight to fight o battle brother go I need to know that the Bible says in Psalms 24 verse 7 lift up your heads o ye gates and be ye lifted up at the everlasting doors and the King of glory shall come in who is this King of glory the Lord strong and mighty the Lord mighty in battle I'll tell you Chuck he's the Lord tonight anybody about he never called the hey look how packing a victory he's the Lord mighty in battle there's no situation

tonight he's never been defeated and he's a panel of fun tonight Church so ask whatever you will and my God will finish the fight you don't have to figure out how God's gonna do it it ain't up to you to figure that out you don't have to figure out when he's gonna do it only thing that you need to know is that God has never lost a battle and he can't loosen up I said he's never lost about he's not gonna lose tonight in verse 11 and it came to pass as they fled from here before Israel and they were going down to Beth Horn that the Lord casts down great stones from heaven upon them in Ezekiel and they died and they were and there were more which died with hailstones than the who that chosen Israel slew with the sword see the devil he may think he can outrun your sword let me tell you he may be able outrun your sword but he can't outrun your God no gods here tonight I ride that horse don't anybody think they get out of your control get out of your reach we serve a living God and there be more slew and also then David died by the soul this God that we serve as a man of war the Bible says in Exodus 15 and verse 3 the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name oh well we don't like to talk about fine I told my young people in my church I said I you know what I was a lover and a fighter I love to fight but now by for the right thing now he'll fight for the gospel now fight for soul now fight for the real thing God's given me a purpose to fight boy let me tell you can just recognize huh God is he controlling your situation God's got an old thing that you may not be able to see in the end but God's already seen it and he's already seen you victorious he's already seen you as an overcomer he's already seen you on the other side oh go Fred Church don't worry about the situation vomits here he's the man of war I said he's a man of war tonight then Joshua verse 12 then spake Joshua to the Lord this all right tonight this make Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up to him a rights before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel some knows he didn't do this in a closet no sir he did this for all our visual to see but there in fact is a God in heaven let me tell you the message that we received was not a message put him in the back part of a corner but Noah still went around the world seven times until his two regions of foreign lost lands of Japan where there never was a message Church but yet God is beginning to do it work overseas I'm saying God is not a God to sit by and be idle be and I put it out there for everybody he died had to worry about ever fallen he don't ever have to worry about losing he knows he's going to be big hard and so he doesn't for a public display and I've got almighty in the anointed Joshua and Joshua speak to the Lord and they will the Lord delivereth dam arise for the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel Sun stand still upon Gibeon and thou moon in the valley of a July and the Sun Stood Still and the moon sailing to the people had a beast himself upon their enemies no church if the son can obey the voice of a man what about your condition what about your situation if the Sun the moon can stop what about that depression excellent Tina not obey the voice of a man Oh hallelujah I tell you what I feel that anointing right now oh I believe right now wherever you ask God God is able tonight so the sun's just still in the midst of heaven and haisa not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like the day before it her after that the Lord hearkened to the voice of a man for the Lord fault for Israel if he felt for the natural bride only fight for this spiritual bride ah brother bana makes a statement here and I've heard but now I see Joshua was in an hour of crisis when the armies was routed the Sun was going down Joshua was a prophet and he knew that if those armies ever got a chance to reunite again and come against him that he will lose more man so in the hour of crisis when something had been done he says there was only one thing if he could keep them running he had robbed him and every one of them down he said but there was enough light to do it Joshua stood there raised his hands up and he said son stand still and mood hang on til I get through with the battle and the Sun Stood Still they heard Joshua speak and then they seeing God they seen God in action let me say a church if you raise your hands tonight it could put us on everything that's against you and know that God is on your side and you speak for your need when you raise your hands and speak much and it puts God in action hey dad look like the thing drew see the spoken word of God he'll turn his back so that they can win the battle in the spoken word of God today will hold your enemies back hey did you win the battle it's time that we speak well I need to preach them do they know you know you need to recognize your position and when you do it puts God in action perhaps Joshua perhaps he never had tried to figure it out that's our problem we live in a day of reason social media internet we Google everything or Snopes it or whatever you want to call it we want to find out if it's real or not found people going out to find out if God's real or not you never go on Google God and get a real answer you never go smoke God out and get a real answer you got to know this guy by personal vindication he got nothing by personal experience see Josh I never tried to figure it out here was going to do it know how God was going to do it the only thing he said well son stand still he said it perhaps not knowing what he was saying because he was God they give it to him and it worked did you hear what I said and it worked and if they can work for Joshua in the day that he had a need and you got a need tonight and you're a son of God you've been adopted position replaced in the body let me tell you Church don't be afraid to speak to her let me tell you God's here to back it up and he works we've seen sister Lana we see system arrived for it we've seen the hands of God we've seen the testimonies and it works tonight well Bev says that when you live right and do right and act right and have faith in God Satan will tremble when you speak because he knows something is about to happen I said he knows that something is about to happen his hole that he's had on you can't hold you any longer no he trembles when you begin to speak because you're not speaking of your own evidence you're speaking by faith in a Living God manifested for you in this hour to minister to your needs and when you begin to speak that all he'll begin to tremble because they know that there's nothing that they can do to stand between or before then or the daughter or son of God before them and they're gone and get their petition man because God's gonna respond but probably God said he'll bankrupt heaven to keep his word - you see you gotta believe now with all your heart he said just your faith in Him your faith that says to the mountain that's before you be thou moving casts out of my way cancer you leave blindness you leave crippling yulie be cast into the sea for I am moving on with the Lord Jesus he goes in when you speak that word something will happen well brother I don't have crippled us I don't have blindness have cancer but that doesn't matter what about your situation it's the same principle you speak two words something will happen because God's obligated to keep his word and when you stand out there by faith putting your faith in God's Word it's speaking God's Word then God's obligated to make sure something happens Rob em says now I don't care what it is if you say to the mountain be moved and maybe if you got to go over the mountain for a purpose he goes maybe you got to go over that mountain for a purpose now he says somebody said well I'm a great man of faith I'll move to that mountain he said it'll never move hope of it is there's something over that mountain edge you just got to get to over there do the will of God and you can't get over you can't get on it you can't get around it yet something in your heart is telling you to go you just speak the word to this mountain last two before our sister lana was a great big mountain nobody's ever been delivered or been healed of this stage 4 cancer that she had completely consumed her old lobe in her lung but yeah we still spoke to word of god we cursed that thing in the name of the Lord Jesus and when a god dude God came up and backed up his word and that demon that had her bowed had to leave and now she's gained 15 pounds she was down to like 86 pounds and now as she's finally getting her weight back let me say God is still a god that's here today he's still the same today he still moves today he still responds to the needs of the people today God responds to your faith if you just let your faith loose one time all it takes is one time to let that faith look and you'll see God move and your see God respond and you want to speak again and you want to speak again and there'll be no hindrance to your faith see Joshua was anointed to take the land because God already told him as I was with Moses so shall I be with you now going in there Joshua and drive out the Malachi's drive out the Philistines are about to the hivite drive out the Paradise drive them all out I'll given you the land and that's exactly what God is telling you as the believer today I've already given you every promise in this book but you got to drive every devil offer telling you they for you he said telling you you're not good enough he's telling you I'm gonna call you I'm gonna destroy you but God already no need you to try about every hindrance every demonic depression everything that would come against you guys already giving you that power I was at a church one town I was speaking on Joshua here driving out the the enemies out of the land and you know as I was preaching that said parasites versus parasites I said parasites and we had a sister unbeknownst to me there's a sister in a church she had a parasite in her and she couldn't she was lactose intolerant and it just completely Kizuna he just crippled her when she drank milk and she loved milk she loved ice cream but when I spoke that she reached up and grabbed hold to it she said that's my promise I seem like I misspoke and mispronounced the word God said it exactly how she needed here and she left that service went right to the baskin-robbins or somewhere and got her an ice cream and she's not having one problem with lactose intolerance in because he's still a living God his words spoken are mortal this guitar signal can't die about diseases parasite and hereby and Felicity know whatever in this end oh my god is able tonight who's the voice not the spoken word see the Sun was going down and Joshua needed just a little bit more light he did have an all-night prayer meeting brother Jesse okay we got a Catholic Church together we got a need no he just commanded he knew his place in the body he knew he was given a commission to lead the children of Israel over into that land and he knew that the land belonged to him what about you you've been anointed to take the land the land belongs to you the book belongs to you take the book eat the book consume the book prophesy again you got to speak or hear what I'm telling you got to speak to your storms you got to speak to your situations you got to speak to your Mountain you got to speak to the Sun that's going down and setting on your knee you got to speak are these little enemies are gonna route together brother em says now rock cross speak he said the son obeyed him no crying out he spoke to the son and said you stand still son hang there moon you stay where you're in he didn't cry out Lord now what can I do he said give me some more light some more sunlight he had a need of sunlight so he committed and a son obeyed him oh my he commanded us understand still and if the Sun obeyed the voice of a man what about your situation what about that desires you have for revival for refilling and refreshing of the Holy Ghost if the son can obey the voice of a man there won't God and respond to yours Lord I want to arrive aha I want to disagree reassuring or refilling of the Holy Ghost God I want you to go after my loved ones God I want this fear to leave home off this anxiety to leave oh let me tell you it will obey the voice of a man and a daughter of God that know their position in the body he's the same God today church and he responds the same way I think about God he'd never changes you can access God the same way they did but you got to look through it through the eyes of faith and not through the eyes of circumstance Aza oh my condition you know what your condition god's faced it before no matter what you're here for tonight whatever your situation is God has been there before and he's able more than able to make sure you come out victorious let's look at another servant of God now we go a little bit longer tonight not too much longer we're Americans familiar with the story of David and Goliath right all the kids loved David and Goliath right they're not paying attention to me I don't blame I wouldn't either that's are their children and so this is in 1st Samuel 17 and verse 2 we're going to see how another son of God who knew his position how he handled the situation I believe that we can take a lot from this tonight install in the men of Israel were gathered together and they pitched by the Valley of Elah and they set the battle in array against the Philistines and the Philistines stood on a mountain on one side and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them and they went out of champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of Gath whose height was six cubits of span and they had a helmet of brass upon his head notice his attire had a helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with the coat of mail in the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass he had Greaves upon the breath Greaves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders and the staff of the spear was like a Weaver's beam and the spears head weight 600 shekels of iron and one bang a shield went before him and he stood a knee crowded to the armies of Israel and they said unto them why are you come out to set the battle on the right am I not a Philistine and you servants of thought saw choose you a man for you and let him come down to me and if he be able to fight with me in to kill me then we will be your service but if I prevail against him and kill him then you should be our service and serve us and the Philistines said I defied the armies of Israel this day give me a man that will that may fight together and shawl and ears will heard those words of the Philistine and they were dismayed and greatly afraid now there should have been if there was anybody that should have had the courage to go out to fight it should have been saw but mama says he was head and shoulders above the rest of Israel he should have been the ward he was already handpicked by God but because he refused to obey the complete Word of God God removed his blessing and placed it on another let me tell you here he was they refined the foolish season of Felicis were meaner war they were trained in a young age and Goliath came out for forty days making a boat the same way your Goliath comes to you every day every morning when you put your foot off that man he's in a strike fear into your heart but I want you to know tonight there's got to be somebody to rise up oh here he was galosh come running down the mouth and they said brother Tim and brother Timothy there they just went to Israel about two weeks ago and they were in this very same spot the battle or the Valley of Elah and they said that Goliath here he was he would run down the mountain 40 times a day and run back up to mountain with all his gear this moment all this may alone and these trees and everything with this shield he would run 40 times a day just to show the people of Israel all his shear strength and his sheer power and that's exactly what the devil does he he comes and he torments you with this and he hits you with that and he comes and he does it over and over and over but somebody's got out and tired of hearing the boat I'm sick and tired of falling down I'm sick and tired of this lukewarm condition if anybody should us July they should have been solved but souls in a backslidden condition and the reason why we don't get victory over our glass is because we're in a backslidden condition well bro Joe what happened to you building our faith I'm not done yet oh no what we find here see the army of Israel they had the very same body that David had they served the same God that David had they were under the same Abraham covenant that David was under the only difference is David took God in His Word and they didn't you know probably God said if you want to attract the attention of God take God at His Word if you want to believe God you won't got to combine your way and minister to your knees didn't you take God in his word that God will do what His Word says he would do and if you hang your soul on that word God will bankrupt heaven to make sure he does exactly what his word declares that he will do and he'll do it for you and your do it through you and your due time and time again because why cuz you're not relying on your own effort you're not relying on efforts of a man but you're relying on dust saith the Lord and you can't fall when you're entitled thus saith the Lord we find here in 1st Samuel 17 in verse 32 and David said to Saul let no man's heart fear or let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight the Philistine now we all know that David was a young man at this time 1314 maybe years old today he was just a young man here he says you know I'll go fight him don't worry that only money's heart nobody's heart Spillman you know Saul came to David he says you know you just to use he's a man of war but the book of Timothy Paul tells Timothy let no man despise IU's God can use the youth so of us close minded parent to get out of the way come on help my pastor who started pastoring when he was like 15 years old there's a young man on the field today brother Andrew Glover is 21 years old he preaches like he's been preaching for 40 years a man is amazing and he's a young man started preaching when he was 13 years old let no man despise thy youth if God has done something in your heart and there's no fear to face any devil out there and I say come on and come in cuz you're more like whipped in some of the old people that sit there and they watch this and they would then I got lukewarm and dilatory and they don't want to fight any longer I'll tell you we need some young people rise up then I take this message to the coming of the Lord tell me blow fire for God and they see God Lou he no longer got a history but he's a now God he's a very present help he's the God that responds to the needs of the people so I said what you're just using he's a man of war from his youth David said unto Saul you know what can't say quite like that they didn't use the word you know what back in that day I'm putting that in Louisiana terminology y'all like that don't a little bit of southern this to it you know what I'm sorry brother Jesse yeah baby another eight years will you get back here buddy oh I feel I feel free tonight just a print David sending us all thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came alive and a bear and he took a lamb out of the flock and I went after him notice he wasn't fear and trembling shaking and was afraid to do anything no he goes I went after him and I smote him and I delivered it out of his mouth and when he rose up against me I called him by the beard and I smote him and slew a little fourteen-year-old kid maybe he wasn't afraid though because God's already showed him that he was real he was in aa servant that servants slew the the line and the bear and this uncircumcised Felisa notice what he was speaking now what was going to happen to this uncircumcised philistine he says now this uncircumcised Philistine he shall be as one of them seeing that he has defied the armies of the Living God and David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the pole of the line and out of the polar bear he will deliver me out of the hand of the prison only happened he was having a positive testimony he was speaking though he couldn't see it though he didn't know what was gonna happen he trusted in on seeing God and God thought he delivered him from a bear and God delivered him from a life and if God could do that surely Dokken delivery from July it is God's enemy from spoken hate Rican hate cussin and woman eyes and a life will cease surely he can heal your six body surely you come on your situation surely God can move tonight surely he's the same today as he was yesterday see David begins to recite his testimony you know God put David through the little bear trial then he had my little Jenny had him on line trial because I was the king of the jungle you know so he faced the bear hindi war and he faced the line anyone in the same God he allows you to go through the different trials and every time the trial gets a little bit bigger because God knows one day you're gonna face you're gonna lie but he don't want you to have fear he don't want you to be trembling he wants you to know the same God delivered you from the door is the same guy the living you from the love and he's the same God tonight that to the deliver you from this garage situation actually God's is an uncircumcised philistine he died the coming of the rock that means you've got the power you've got the authority you've got the jurisdiction over here but the thing is that you need to never forget never forget your testimony no matter how small the victory was never forget the many victories that God has wrought in your life because there's going to be times you're gonna have to pull from those testimonies say God you deliver me here you brought me through this can you know recall the way I came to the Lord and I don't mind this is not in my notes but I'm just going to share this to that bill it lay Liberty to say it right now way I came to the Lord because I was dating a girl brother for the Jessie I was dating the girl I was in the world I don't know nothing about the message didn't know really know a lot about God but I knew God sort of dealing with my heart and I started tending the Baptist Church here and there and you know we were doing things we shouldn't have been doing you know young young couple I can't we were close to getting married I thought I was gonna marry and all this kind of crazy stuff and you know kind of find out she started dating a coach at her school hate tore me up so I went to a manic-depressive I take tylenol PMS three or four or five of them by five in the morning get up at 7:00 and go to college and try to get my degree and my grades went from all A's they dropped my junior year to all C's and I was like man I mean I I was at the point brother Jesse I was that close to committing suicide I was like man I have no reason to live no desire to live I mean I hit rock bottom I there have been times you know if you ever had depression there's times that you can't sleep there's times you sleep all the time and so I was in this state there would be times all my friends would go out and I stay on the couch it in one of their house and you just sleep the whole time they come back in and when the wee hours of the morning and I feel still be asleep then it switches and I'll be up all night trying to go to school trying to get some sleep and I can't sleep but I reached that point but it was at that point tonight that I wanted to commit suicide and ain't I Hank I contemplated pulling my car off into a ditch at 120 miles per hour and the Lord something came down and spoke in my car and said turn your car around and go home I didn't know anything about God I didn't know what I was doing all I know is I heard something and I'm turning my car around so I turned the car around I was headed to my mom's house she lived somewhere up in Memphis Tennessee and I was headed to go see her because you know what what great a place to go to mom cause mom loves you and I'm like I had a FAFSA my dad was a tow boat captain he wasn't there I live by myself so I mean I needed to have somebody around because I knew I was about to do something very daily and very dangerous but I drove that car turned it around and I drove 120 miles an hour back through town and I was you know I was dead said I don't care what I hit I don't care if I go in the ditch it doesn't matter but when I got home I knelt beside that bed and I begin to cry out to God God I don't know what's going on I know I don't have a desire to live anymore I'm so depressed I got to get through this God if you'll come down and do something in my life tonight I'll make sure I'll serve you for the rest of my days you know when it was just a simple prayer and I've been drinking now I'm not gonna find that but I've been drinking and you think well you just did that because you was wrong let me tell you I had a foul mouth every other word was an F word of this word of that word but when I got up the next morning my language completely changed I knew that I had met God and not only did I meet God God met me and from that little point right there on the side of my bed at two o'clock in the morning God begin to change my desires y'all begin to change my life he brought me from a state of depression to a man of God preaching the gospel Oh far with the passion to know that no matter what trial you faced what situation you think if you trust God my God is bigger my god is greater my god is able he'll bring you through the storm he'll bring you through depression he'll bring you through the picture and you'll be a son and daughter of God and you can look I always thinking why am I going through this why wasn't I do to deserve this oh but now I can look back and I could say God thank you for every bit of it because it was through that trial I came to know the Lord he was through that trial that I left my hometown and packed up a mood to wear message Church was there he said that church where I met my future wife he said that Church well now I have a wife and I got four beautiful children I looked at it I said oh god why'd you got me here but dogs at all you can't see the other side home okay I got something there in store for you I sat you a faithful wife I got you a real daughter of God I got you four beautiful kids that waiting for hos me other side go to the store I'll bring you through her so when I get down sometimes I will call that incident to God you probably through that surely you'll bring me to more trials oh here's Goliath he's there making his boast he's there letting it be known that he's mighty Rover come strolling into the camp one day or the little fourteen-year-old boy he even had a testimony he made God not only didn't meet God he met a prophet of God Oh hallelujah he coming there in July ladies both but that Ghost fell on the wrong gears I did let me I hope that they're both today it's falling the wrong gear at sons and daughters of God recognize who they are they recognize their position and they recognize that every devil every power is beneath them because I've given you power over all the enemy Church oh yeah David had met a prophet here he comes he calls all Jesse's kids bring them boys on out here we gods looking for another king God's here and he sent me to another king so he went through all the big statutes no God don't want him God don't want him God don't want him God don't want him same as I hate you he got another one I know I went to your whole tribe Jesse you ain't got no boy cuz yeah I got a little he's out there 14 year old little GQ boy you cute you know he's all goodly to look on and he's out there tending to the sheep I'm like let him go to Balor he's too yo well just we ain't gonna sit down until you get off or they sent out they got little David come walking back you know he smelled like sheep that's what a shepherd should smell like to smell like his flock no he gets all scarred up with him and get to all in there with him you know the Bible talks about a sheep gate and when the Sheep what a shepherd would do is a shepherd at night he'd bring all the Sheep into a little Corral there was no gate in that Corral but the Shepherd became the gate he became the Sheep gate he lived with the Sheep he knew the Sheep he knew how they thought he knew how they acted and that's why you be so thankful that God's giving you a god-given pastor because he knows about the cares and the deeds of the Sheep and why am I here this evening because God had it on your Shepherd's heart to bring you a man of God all the way from Louisiana to do it to minister to your knees because he recognizes the need in the Sheep and he brings somebody maybe he can't reach the sheep that way but he sent somebody up here through the anointing of the Holy Spirit that'll move in such a way in through such a channel that it is speak to the sheep in the begin to change things and elevate their faith that they too can believe but I can do this hallelujah but here he was Samuel comes up here comes David and the Lord said this is he he took that all he opened that horn and began to pour that all all over David him pour down a run all over from his head to his feet and the property of God says just like the baptism of the holy goat he don't pour it out on your sparingly no sir he and grow see you always from your head to your feet baby girl clean his Holy Ghost field you've got nothing to worry about truck David knew that he just been anointed to be king hey so he goes to take food to his brothers and he hears this boastful cry haha something rose up brother Jesse had wrought your signal a ship he defined the armies of the Living God they've said I'll go fight him and we found here first single seventeen he took his staff in his hand and he chose five smooth Stones out of the brook you know dad Goliath looking over there he's like look at me just a kid he still playing with rocks Oh Church what do you say brother I'm saying let your devil think that's what you're doing look at them they just play in church old devil what you don't know is we're getting some ammunition it may look like we're picking up rocks and we are we're picking up revelation after revelation at the revelation church one rock captain the other rock at the old rock we got revelation upon revelation what is it for because you know just on the other side there's like a lie oh you got a revelation in your little strip bag he picked up five smooth stones what do you do brother he beginning to put one in his sling I mean a winding it up that's the problem with so many missions believers they still wanting their sling all they're doing is just sling look at me I got my sleeve I got my rock ho it tell you that rock and that sling won't do you a bit of good until you got fake to release it that revelation that you get in touch won't do you any good until you speak it and put it in action and when you release your faith and every day David had that sitting there and the Bible said he hastened here and took a me and when he ran Tomica he released that sling oh so he had faked enough to let go of to do that the same God they diluted him from the bear and directed the bark of the bear is the same one to drag it on the line he's a saved God today that a director mark 11 July and a prophet of God said when he released it the hand of God called holy let's stop o go home rest oh and here he comes who I am Goliath teetering the Bible says he fell face forward she feels the work of a man he would have failed backwards but the Bible says every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess let me tell you that devil had to fall prostrate before guy same way by George devil told me he's got the ball tail but it's easier for you to conquer it but you gotta release that rock you got a really sad revelation IMO son of a god I have a daughter of God I release in my faith and I made a martyr Darla's directed to it's more he noticed here in verse 45 listen how the devil speaks to you or verse 43 and the Philistine said to David hey my dog without comes to me with staves and the Philistine cursed David by his gods and if listening said to David come come to me and I will give your flesh into the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field that's what he tells you I'm gonna destroy here there's no way for you to get victory look verse 45 and this is how you talk to the devil then David said to their dens David yeah then said David to the felicity's thou comes to me with a sword and with a spear and with the shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom thou the finest notice David didn't have a sword he didn't have a spear till I told him my sword is greater than your spear my sword is greater than this he's got superior weapons but David wasn't looking at his weapons David was looking at one thing I got a testimony I've already seen God move I seen the supernatural there's no way for a man to defeat a bear or a lion but my God's done it and it may seem that the enemy's weapons are more superior to your little semen imitator if you release that sling in the name of the Lord God of hosts ain't a devil he'll just stand before you and we find we find that he knocked Goliath down otherwise God called hold of that stone and not Goliath but David already said what was going to happen so he had already spoke I'll go take your head off so the words spoken had to be coming in action David couldn't just lay him there let him stay there no he had already spoke the word what was gonna be and so he had to be anointed in which he was to finish he didn't have a spear for the Jews he didn't have a sword one day the Bible says he went over and he stood on the full listing I said he stood on top of living teacher it's time to to stand on top of your felicity I'd ever come to you with it you take that strong hand of faith and your call that sword out have a sword that's all right your problem was given a sword oh sunset now when he was giving that's also where you take that sword by faith and begin to act on that devil and finally he reached down in internet hell up all of Israel shows the head of July what happened Roseau got courage if David could do that we can - hallelujah and David can get the picture began to make they've been overcome depression we can turn holy it just sparked a fire and all the visual come running off that mountain they pursued after their enemy until all love or defeated see David had already spoke what are you saying brother I'm saying you must speak so he was an Onan he knew his position brother bamse every David sitting here everyday was sitting here tonight your positionally in Christ God's confirmed it election callin anointing placing he elected you and called you he elected you and called you then he anointed you with the Holy Spirit and now he's placed you in the body of Christ each one of these David's wears took a life who's a glass brother branham that cancer that's eating you up that tumor that's hanging on you then cataracts on your eyes that crippled arm everything looks like it says they can't be done the devil says you might as well quit believing you might

till they saved you from a life of drunkenness from Raleigh from seeing that that was ready if God can do that for you he can save you from TV he can save you from cancer he's a girl I don't take his boat stand in the name of the Lord Jesus and challenge him to a show that you're personally in Christ and if the believer know his position he would have I'm trying to get you in your position if you know your position then you would have what you asked for or what you're in need of tonight hallelujah let me bring this on to hell Oh hallelujah Romans 10 and verse 6 will bring us on down to a cloth but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not in a heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring Christ up again from the dead but what saith it the word is what come on church stay with me just a few moment as the word is what the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in the heart that is the Word of Faith which we preach but that makes a statement here and here you him he said there be a power put in the church and now it's coming now it's coming in that the Holy Spirit was so anointed people - they'll speak to and they will create itself right there we haven't seen powers like that just coming into the church now I know it for a fact say it to this mountain be moved and not doubt in your heart but believe that what you said shall come to pass then you shall have whatsoever you said the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church then the critics mouth will be shut that was 1960 were sixty-eight years passed if there was a power coming into the church in 1960 what power is in this church today that was abroad in infant form we're no longer in an infancy church were a bride Church we're mature we're a church that knows how to respond knows how to speak know the Bible says she knows what he wants done with his word or she stays still so each of you right now that's received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you've been adopted into the family of God and each of you right now lays the power and the authority to speak to your mouth and and your Mountain must obey your voice you just need to recognize your position as a son and as a daughter of God in the messages patmans vision boom and says now man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent did not he say in mark 11 verse 22 whatsoever things you say and not doubt in your heart it'll come to pass he goes you'll have what you have said he goes what happens when to omnipotence meet when God and man comes together to Unlimited's something's got to shake o church I hope you can shake a mountain tonight to recognize I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of God I've been blood ball I've been washed by the blood of Jesus Christ I mean I've received the token the badge of my Holy Ghost and went to omnipotence come in contact with one another something's gonna shake all hell's gonna shake because it ain't gonna have it told on me any longer because I'm recognizing myself as a son of God he says whatsoever you say with the creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he promised it that he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things the past things that is and makes it as though they are because to omnipotence have met he says now then if we have Zoe God's life in us we become sons of God amateur creators he said now what so ever you say believe with all your heart and you shall have whatever you ask for see a lot of times real them says now a lot of times I say things that I I couldn't even hardly think myself but I'll say it anyhow he says and they come to find out it happened just the way it was said I say things I didn't hardly didn't mean for it to happen that way but it didn't help because why cuz I said it he goes in when you believe it and you speak it then the creative word goes out it's a part of God see it's create it and we'll end with this quote right here the Pergamus church so in a spirit born spirit filled man in faith takes the Word of God in his heart and place it upon his lips while that's the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man when you speak to that mountain has to go Satan Kingstown before you well because it's the same as deity speaking and that word dear to me Supreme Being and when you take the Word of God on your and he comes into your heart and you speak it upon your mouth it's the same as god almighty speaking because all hell's going to be backing up because all heavens coming down on your behalf and the devil's got to leave that mountains got to move that depression has to vanish so fears got to go everything that will come against you has to leave in the name of Jesus for cousin ain't you speaking but it's that super anointing the supreme being the Holy Ghost speaking through you and every temple has to bow before that voice and now we're sons of God part of God deity itself lives in every believer every man that's born of the Spirit of God is a part of God so I encourage you speak to your Mountain let the musicians come back or one musician tonight speak to the sickness that's in your life speak to that storm that's troubled you God will bring a call gotta bring a peace God will settle it for you tonight you don't have to wonder what's gonna happen tomorrow God can sell it right now for you tonight

to exercise our faith God I got a need I got a mountain in my way I'm gonna speak to it tonight what you don't see Church he's on the back side of that mountain one little the Holy Ghost begins to blow on the back side of that mouth and one little grain of sand picks up let me get us a world that catches that stream close you're right off that mountain Holy Ghost comes Magaddino close on that
