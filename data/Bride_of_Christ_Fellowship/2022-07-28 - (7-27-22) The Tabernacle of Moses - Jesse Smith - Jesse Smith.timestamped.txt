[15:22] [Applause]
[15:34] i told you last week i'd like to
[15:36] teach on the tabernacle because also you
[15:38] are new to this i looked it up it's been
[15:41] since 2007 since i preached it i
[15:43] preached in 2009 in iowa
[15:46] it's been quite a number of years ago so
[15:47] i thought
[15:49] be good to refresh that
[15:51] god's grace exodus chapter 25. trust me
[15:54] a blessing to you this is just a
[15:56] tremendous study
[15:58] so many beautiful types shadows
[16:00] imagine williams heard a number of
[16:02] sermons on this topic over the years
[16:05] i imagine that's probably how
[16:13] just one verse we'll have you be seated
[16:15] after we read and pray here exodus 25
[16:17] verse 8 exodus 25 verse
[16:33] i got some pictures i'll get to
[16:34] eventually you know where it's really
[16:36] it's good visual learning experience
[16:38] it gives you a
[16:40] nice structure to think about the old
[16:41] testament and then of course the new
[16:43] testament
[16:44] three works of grace and also your three
[16:46] parts to your being it's just a
[16:48] beautiful
[16:49] lesson
[16:50] you know brother branham got some of
[16:52] these thoughts from clarence larkin as
[16:53] i've seen in this book a lot of good
[16:55] thoughts from larkin on this with the
[16:57] three parts to man's being so i know
[17:00] he'd be blessed tonight praise god and
[17:01] just trust the lord here to speak his
[17:03] word as we saw you know sunday night
[17:06] i thought it would be a really easy
[17:07] sermon to preach but i couldn't get
[17:08] through it so people must have been
[17:09] pulling somehow so keep pulling by god's
[17:11] grace and you'll have whatever you
[17:13] desire praise god exodus 25 verse
[17:18] a very simple scripture let's read this
[17:19] on three if we can ready one two three
[17:22] and let them make me a sanctuary that i
[17:25] may dwell
[17:26] amen as blessings word may be seated
[17:30] i do have some slides to show here so
[17:34] we will preach here we'll try to go an
[17:36] hour now i've been going an hour and a
[17:37] half so we'll just be
[17:39] open to whatever time we can get here
[17:41] so i think cam showed this picture about
[17:43] austin when he was here if i'm not
[17:44] mistaken remember this picture brother
[17:47] okay so this was the tabernacle of moses
[17:49] remember two million people came out of
[17:51] uh egypt maybe two and a half million i
[17:53] heard some historians say today
[17:55] so these are all tents of you know of
[17:57] course all the all the israelites here
[17:59] and then this is the tabernacle
[18:01] so
[18:03] this was when it was all finished so at
[18:04] the end of exodus when the holy ghost
[18:06] came down uh and filled the place so
[18:09] this would have been exodus chapter 40.
[18:11] but god started teaching them about this
[18:13] in exodus chapter 25.
[18:15] so i like to look at the tabernacle of
[18:17] moses here tonight and i said it's been
[18:19] many many years well since i've
[18:20] appreciated this so
[18:22] but as i said a few weeks ago we
[18:24] preached on the waters of separation
[18:26] recently so over the last five years or
[18:28] so so
[18:29] it was a little fresh on my heart
[18:32] i want to look at the purpose and the
[18:33] the pattern of the tabernacle here i
[18:35] have lots of scriptures
[18:37] i got a lot of time today to study so i
[18:39] was able to get them a lot on here so
[18:41] hopefully i won't have to want to turn
[18:42] too much so you can maybe have your
[18:43] bible handy there
[18:46] but our text says let them make me a
[18:48] sanctuary that i may dwell among them so
[18:50] god requests a place
[18:53] with his people where he can dwell with
[18:56] them praise god amen now of course we
[18:58] know god is omnipresent god god by
[19:00] foreknowledge is here praise god amen
[19:03] and if we're worshiping god then we know
[19:04] god's presence also comes down
[19:07] so he's here in another way other than
[19:09] by omniscience he would be here
[19:11] anointing our bodies right so we can
[19:12] raise our hands when we're tired we
[19:14] worked all wednesday right we might be
[19:16] tired but the holy ghost will lord our
[19:18] bodies to raise our hands praise god and
[19:20] give god glory and clap and
[19:22] shout amen and maybe stomp a few times
[19:24] if we sing praise god in the sanctuary
[19:26] amen you might want to happen get out
[19:28] the tambourine you know but god's spirit
[19:30] comes upon our flesh
[19:32] and then it comes upon uh our minds and
[19:34] our soul as well by the grace of god but
[19:37] here in the old testament god wants to
[19:39] dwell among them so they can physically
[19:41] seek god god was always one who was
[19:44] revealing himself we know that's the
[19:45] name of what jehovah and elohim means
[19:48] the self-existent one who's always
[19:50] revealing himself that's right he's he's
[19:52] so great he's so he's so eternal he's so
[19:55] unlimited that we'll never be able to
[19:57] fully understand unless we have eternal
[19:59] life amen in this life we'll never be
[20:01] able to even scratch the surface of his
[20:03] greatness
[20:04] that's why he's constantly revealing
[20:06] himself through the prophets through the
[20:07] church ages and here at the end of the
[20:10] church ages amen he's revealed himself
[20:12] right as the son of man son of god son
[20:15] of david he's reviewing himself as god
[20:17] in christ supreme deity in jesus christ
[20:20] amen that's how he's revealed himself
[20:22] today hallelujah thank god amen and we
[20:24] know him as jesus christ hallelujah now
[20:27] verse 9 says according to all that i
[20:29] show thee
[20:30] after the pattern of the tabernacle and
[20:33] the pattern of all the instruments
[20:34] thereof even so shall you make it so god
[20:37] said i'm going to dwell among you
[20:39] you're going to build me a house a
[20:41] temporary tent a tabernacle or sanctuary
[20:44] drum and i'm going to tell you how to
[20:45] build it and i'm going to tell you all
[20:47] the instruments you need praise god
[20:48] that's right in other words if you want
[20:50] me to dwell with you and i want to drug
[20:52] you you got to come according to my
[20:53] pattern amen amen that's how it is the
[20:55] new testament as well praise god if you
[20:57] come according to god's pattern god's
[20:59] going to bless you on a wednesday night
[21:00] praise god just like a sunday night just
[21:02] like a sunday morning amen if you come
[21:04] according to god's pattern god is going
[21:06] to answer your requests amen as he
[21:08] constantly does praise god
[21:10] now see once it's well and then
[21:12] it was going to be set up so this was
[21:14] going to be set up like it was in heaven
[21:16] praise god
[21:18] moses's tabernacle was going to be a uh
[21:20] imitation of the heavenly tabernacle god
[21:23] bless you brother good to see you
[21:24] tonight sir
[21:25] and then god said there i will meet with
[21:28] you
[21:29] and i will commune with you above the
[21:31] mercy seat so before the people of god
[21:34] you know they would only see god in his
[21:36] supernatural like maybe on mount sinai
[21:38] and they were afraid and then they
[21:39] begged god they said god we don't want
[21:41] to see the thunder lightning would just
[21:43] speak through the prophet right but then
[21:45] god was so merciful god said i want to
[21:47] dwell among you praise god amen i want
[21:49] more than just the prophet to see me i
[21:52] want all my people to see me praise god
[21:54] that's how she'll be tonight amen more
[21:56] than just a preacher more than just a
[21:57] song leader or more than just a piano
[22:00] player or something or deacon or trustee
[22:02] everybody should want to see god amen
[22:04] amen everybody should want a special
[22:06] communion with god hallelujah amen
[22:10] that's what it is church probably tells
[22:11] us he says pray every day read your
[22:13] bible every day he said before you make
[22:16] any decision ask god about the decision
[22:19] and be neutral and he said in some way
[22:21] or another god will talk to you praise
[22:23] god amen
[22:24] we don't have to hear a voice all the
[22:26] time we don't have to have a dream every
[22:27] time or we don't have to have some type
[22:29] of a feeling or a tickle down our spine
[22:32] or goosebumps which we appreciate that
[22:33] praise god but it doesn't have to be
[22:35] that god speaks to his children in many
[22:37] ways he wants to meet with us he wants
[22:40] to commune with us he wants us to enjoy
[22:42] his presence and talk with him and god
[22:44] wants to have fellowship with you praise
[22:46] god amen
[22:47] glory amen but he said i'll meet with
[22:49] you above the mercy seat from between
[22:51] the two cherubs which are upon the ark
[22:53] of the testimony of all the things which
[22:56] i will give thee in commandment under
[22:58] the children of israel so god wanted to
[23:00] meet and then speak to israel praise god
[23:02] that's right
[23:04] now hebrews 8 lays it out for us kind of
[23:06] plainly and he says
[23:08] who serve unto the example and shadows
[23:10] of heavenly things as moses was
[23:12] admonished to god when he was about to
[23:14] make the tabernacle foresee saith he
[23:17] god said that thou make all things
[23:19] according to the pattern showed thee in
[23:21] the mount so god went up and he climbed
[23:24] up the mountain all by him well with
[23:26] some of the elders but then he went a
[23:27] little bit further beyond and moses was
[23:29] in the prince of god for 40 days that's
[23:31] right and while he was up there he got
[23:33] the tables of stone but he also got the
[23:36] vision of how to build the tabernacle
[23:38] amen amen so god in a secret meeting
[23:40] place up up on top of a mountain praise
[23:42] god god met with this prophet up on top
[23:45] of a mountain hallelujah that's right
[23:47] sounds like when he met peter james and
[23:49] john about transfiguration praise god
[23:51] sounds like what he met brother branham
[23:52] on the mountain amen
[23:55] god meets with his believers on top of
[23:57] mountains sometimes and he gave him the
[24:00] pattern of the heavenly tabernacle
[24:02] praise god and he said you make
[24:04] something like this sort of like this
[24:06] much less grandeur right but you make
[24:08] this upon the earth and moses said i
[24:11] will praise god
[24:13] now remember church there is many of
[24:16] these instruments in heaven revelation 8
[24:18] 3 says an angel come and takes a golden
[24:21] censer
[24:22] which is like a container that holds
[24:23] incense right and we'll have a picture
[24:25] of it later and they put incense into
[24:28] that and he would offer with the prayers
[24:30] of saints upon the golden altar which is
[24:33] before the throne so heaven has an altar
[24:36] praise god heaven has an altar of
[24:38] incense heaven has a mercy seat amen
[24:42] heaven has
[24:43] many instruments praise god and many of
[24:45] these pieces of furniture and moses saw
[24:48] what it was like and god said you make
[24:49] this like the pattern i'm going to show
[24:51] you be obedient and if you do that i'll
[24:54] come in fellowship with you amen glory
[24:57] i'm not going to try to preach my voice
[24:58] out like i did sunday night i gotta be
[25:00] careful now in exodus 19 he said you've
[25:03] seen what i've done to the egyptians and
[25:05] i bear you on ego wings and brought you
[25:06] into myself isn't that how god brought
[25:08] you out of the world
[25:09] don't you feel like god just picked you
[25:10] up out of your desperate condition
[25:12] it's like papa eagles just come flying
[25:14] along
[25:15] i'm going to rescue them and that's what
[25:16] remember austin gave his testimony he
[25:18] just prayed that that bitter prayer
[25:20] right that sincere prayer church that's
[25:22] how it was for you when you were sincere
[25:24] when you really cried out to god that's
[25:25] when papa eagle come around and brought
[25:27] you out of the world and brought you to
[25:29] himself amen
[25:31] that's what he said i bore you on
[25:33] eagle's wings
[25:35] now if you there's another if see the
[25:37] condition it's always conditional
[25:39] if you
[25:40] obey my voice indeed and keep my
[25:42] covenant you shall be a peculiar
[25:44] treasure unto me above all people for
[25:47] all the earth is mine now you know i'm
[25:50] sorry you new testament readers know the
[25:52] beauty of this scripture
[25:53] right
[25:54] because peter tells us you are peculiar
[25:57] people now that's right so let's not
[25:59] just leave it all to israel thank god
[26:01] that they were procured people they are
[26:03] still god's people but you are now god's
[26:06] people right now your eyes are not
[26:08] blinded your eyes are wide open you're
[26:10] tuned another day you're not blinded by
[26:12] the night you are god's people when you
[26:14] believe and keep his word if you love me
[26:16] keep my commands amen amen
[26:19] glory amen
[26:21] you'll be above all the people of the
[26:23] earth for the earth is mine
[26:25] amen praise god
[26:28] church spiritually that's how we are we
[26:30] are above all the sinners of the world
[26:33] because we're up in the mind of christ
[26:35] we're up in heavenly places the bible
[26:37] plainly says it yes the bible plainly
[26:39] says you're already accepted in the
[26:42] beloved amen
[26:44] i tell you paul's departure say you're
[26:46] going to be paul said you are you're
[26:48] already accepted in the presence of
[26:50] jesus christ amen hallelujah amen thank
[26:53] god thank god it here's my prayers amen
[26:55] amen
[26:56] glory amen
[26:58] and he told israel you will be a kingdom
[27:00] of priests and a holy nation and these
[27:02] are the words that thou shalt speak
[27:04] under the church of israel so god
[27:05] himself
[27:07] brings this people to himself so when
[27:09] god brought when god sent moses it was
[27:12] really eagle wings bringing them out
[27:14] moses and aaron the bible said were the
[27:15] eagles bringing them out praise god
[27:18] you brought them out by a mighty hand
[27:19] amen
[27:21] swiftly praise god
[27:23] and now they become separated from egypt
[27:26] and now they are a kingdom of
[27:28] intercessors that's right amen see
[27:30] church when we give up on our prayer
[27:31] life or we're not painful like we ought
[27:33] to we're we're not fulfilling the role
[27:34] that we should
[27:36] because that's what you are you're a
[27:37] priest that's right you've got to pray
[27:39] for one another right and the more we
[27:41] pray the more blessings we get praise
[27:43] god that's right that song is true when
[27:45] the prayers goes up the blessings come
[27:47] down that song is true true because
[27:49] jesus says you have not because you
[27:50] asked that james said it to you praise
[27:52] god that's right see we are a kingdom of
[27:55] prayer warriors amen amen hallelujah
[27:57] because the world is not praying they're
[27:59] only asking god for blessings right
[28:01] they're not really interceding
[28:03] they're not being priests but we're the
[28:05] ones who are supposed to intercede and
[28:06] pray for us you can pray until the walls
[28:09] come down amen
[28:11] so keep praying praise god don't give up
[28:13] keep uh interceding before the throne of
[28:15] god god will do the right thing in the
[28:17] right time we must only be patient and
[28:19] patience possess your soul
[28:22] glory yes amen now church this was a
[28:25] progression of god's dwelling place
[28:29] so we had moses in the wilderness
[28:33] this was a temporary sanctuary
[28:36] right in the wilderness it was not in
[28:38] the promised land but david through
[28:40] joshua david eventually he conquers
[28:44] mount zion as he lifted that that's a
[28:45] beautiful type there right there type of
[28:46] rapture amen
[28:48] beautiful amen
[28:49] uh and
[28:51] then david uh puts a a temporary tap
[28:55] attempt on mount zion in the promised
[28:58] land so first he had a one out in the
[29:00] wilderness that wasn't the right
[29:01] location
[29:02] now he's got the right location but it's
[29:04] still temporary
[29:06] it's not made of stone right it's more
[29:08] temporary but then solomon comes praise
[29:11] god and solomon builds a permanent
[29:14] structure a structure of stones gathered
[29:16] from all around the world praise god oh
[29:18] my hallelujah
[29:21] a dwelling place for god almighty praise
[29:23] god
[29:24] and he makes it a permanent place which
[29:25] is a type of the millennium praise god
[29:28] amen now for those historians out there
[29:31] uh psalmist temple lasted uh a while i
[29:33] don't remember the exactly i think it
[29:34] was around five
[29:36] around 500 bc when the the psalmist
[29:39] temple was tore down in 445 bc the issue
[29:42] was declared to rebuild the house of god
[29:45] and that's when it's removable uh and
[29:47] ezra them rebuilt the tabernacle uh just
[29:49] a small one it was a it was a it was a
[29:52] smaller house praise god it wasn't a big
[29:54] house but it was a smaller house but
[29:56] still the bible said when the capstone
[29:58] was coming down there were shoutings
[30:00] crying grace grace unto it amen and the
[30:03] bible said don't despise the day of
[30:05] small things amen amen
[30:07] amen and then that one got tore down and
[30:10] then king herod built the one that jesus
[30:13] was worshiping him that's right and then
[30:15] that got torn out in 1870 and there's
[30:17] not been another one since but church
[30:19] i'm telling you pretty soon there's
[30:20] going to be another one here
[30:23] another jewish temple according to thus
[30:26] saith revelation chapter 11 amen
[30:28] hallelujah israel will again rebuild the
[30:30] temple we don't know if it's before the
[30:32] rapture or after the rapture but church
[30:34] can you imagine if we see that temple
[30:36] started being built before the rapture
[30:38] we will be in revival mode amen that'll
[30:41] be the latter time
[30:43] even if we don't see it we'll be in a
[30:45] latter rain time amen because it's not
[30:47] safe to worry amen the former latter
[30:49] reign must come in the first book as it
[30:52] did at the beginning in other words this
[30:53] bride must return to being the price he
[30:56] was at pentecost amen glory praise god
[30:59] hallelujah
[31:00] not believing it praise god amen because
[31:02] i see jesus working in my life praise
[31:04] god like the book of acts amen
[31:06] hallelujah thank god
[31:08] oh it's a great blessing and then that
[31:10] was of course a type of the millennium
[31:12] but then there's coming the greater one
[31:14] the last one amen as far as we know we
[31:18] might go on other worlds brother william
[31:19] and we might do some other things on
[31:20] other who knows
[31:22] there's trillions and trillions of
[31:23] galaxies out there who knows what we're
[31:25] doing the entire uh future home you know
[31:28] who knows
[31:29] but i like larkin's drawing here it's so
[31:30] beautiful i love this is one of my
[31:32] favorite drawings of all time i think
[31:35] but here god jesus sets up the permanent
[31:38] home praise god this is this is what
[31:41] this is what he wanted all along but
[31:43] throughout the old testament he was
[31:44] teaching us a lesson like a school
[31:46] teacher
[31:47] amen
[31:48] i like school teachers amen i don't know
[31:50] about you
[31:52] and he was teaching us through moses and
[31:54] then david and then solomon and then
[31:56] jerubal and then through herod right and
[31:59] then through the book of acts church
[32:01] he's teaching us i want to dwell with my
[32:03] people glory i'm getting closer and
[32:06] closer and closer to my people so much
[32:09] so one day i'll be so close the bible
[32:11] says they'll never leave my side amen
[32:14] hallelujah and i'll wipe away every tear
[32:17] from their eye praise god amen
[32:19] amen
[32:21] amen so just look on hallelujah akron
[32:24] avenue that's where i live in there
[32:26] how hallelujah or praise the lord avenue
[32:29] something like that now here's what it's
[32:31] going to look like from heaven praise
[32:32] god all those angels get to see this
[32:34] come down
[32:37] i don't know where it will be when this
[32:38] comes out
[32:39] but the final permanent dwelling place
[32:43] our home is going to come down heaven
[32:46] unites with earth amen praise god
[32:49] lord
[32:50] the rapture is like heaven and earth
[32:51] will kiss
[32:52] and be united like husband and wife amen
[32:55] hallelujah glory and that's church where
[32:57] we get to live hallelujah
[32:59] hallelujah bob said there'll be no more
[33:01] seats i'm not sure about that picture
[33:02] but maybe those are just big legs i
[33:03] don't know but we'll find out one day no
[33:06] doubt that's a minor let's make sure we
[33:08] get there first praise god that's right
[33:10] loretta says the greatest invitation you
[33:11] can ever have in your life is to go to
[33:13] the marriage supper of the lamb praise
[33:14] god
[33:16] and then if you go there surely you'll
[33:18] live there with christ amen
[33:20] you got we have the greatest invitation
[33:22] there ever was
[33:24] to go to jesus's wedding and be married
[33:26] to him amen
[33:28] now church i told you this there's at
[33:30] least five applications to the
[33:32] tabernacle of moses
[33:34] israel's approach to meet with god
[33:36] during the old testament
[33:38] it represents jesus body like brother
[33:40] can preach that was a beautiful thought
[33:42] uh
[33:43] i'm gonna have a few signs on that
[33:46] the third is it represents jesus's work
[33:48] as the heavenly high priest
[33:50] fourth that represents new testament
[33:52] believers being god's tabernacle
[33:54] so you're the tabernacle
[33:56] and then it represents how you and i
[33:58] approach to meet god right now amen and
[34:02] that's where the water separation was so
[34:03] powerful for me and all the churches
[34:05] that god sent me to to preach that
[34:06] message
[34:09] now let's look at the first one israel's
[34:11] approach to meet with god i already
[34:12] showed you god wanted them to be a
[34:13] kingdom of priests right and there are
[34:14] so many details i'm not going to get
[34:16] into most of the details but but church
[34:18] just say you know in when this
[34:19] tabernacle was set up daily sacrifices
[34:23] allowed them to commune with god so
[34:24] let's read that you've got your bible
[34:25] just go to exodus 29 this one's
[34:27] important so i want to read it
[34:30] and you can clearly see the tidy
[34:37] exodus 29 38
[34:43] now this is that which thou shalt offer
[34:45] upon the altar two lambs of the first
[34:47] year day by day continually
[34:49] so two lambs had to die every single day
[34:53] if these people wanted to
[34:55] fellowship with god
[35:00] the one lamb thou shall offer in the
[35:01] morning and the other landmass should
[35:03] operate evening
[35:04] and one with i'm sorry and with the one
[35:06] lamb attention flower mingle with the
[35:08] fourth part of a hint of beaten oil
[35:11] and a fourth part of a hint of wine for
[35:13] drink offering so look you got you got
[35:15] flour oil wine
[35:18] right and you have all the types of the
[35:19] holy spirit in there right
[35:21] flower's the word you know oils the
[35:22] baptism holy ghost and of course wine is
[35:24] a stimulation of revelation right
[35:27] lord this was every day praise god oh i
[35:29] love it amen
[35:31] every day a lamb died in the morning
[35:33] lambda lamb night at night and you all
[35:36] said uh oil wine
[35:38] and flower all throughout the day praise
[35:40] that every day praise god now church
[35:42] can't you see how you need to seek god
[35:44] every morning sure
[35:46] can't you see you gotta you gotta talk
[35:47] to god before you go to bed sure this
[35:50] was old testament what about the new
[35:51] praise god
[35:52] these are the old testament priests that
[35:54] didn't have as good as promises as we
[35:56] have
[35:57] see why it's so important you have
[35:59] morning prayer time and evening prayer
[36:01] time amen
[36:02] he said god stir my spirit god make me
[36:04] strong amen stimulate me somehow today
[36:07] praise god amen let the preacher preach
[36:09] a good message to stimulate me praise
[36:11] god
[36:12] and let me paul in the word of god to
[36:14] help him
[36:16] hallelujah let's tell one another praise
[36:18] god
[36:19] verse 41 and the other lamb shall offer
[36:21] evening and thou shalt do according to
[36:24] the meat offering of the morning in the
[36:25] orbit of drink off in there for a sweet
[36:27] savor an offering made by fire unto the
[36:29] lord
[36:31] this should be a continual burnt
[36:32] offering throughout your generations at
[36:34] the door of the tabernacle the
[36:35] congregation before the lord where i
[36:37] will meet you to speak unto thee now
[36:40] church you know burnt offering if you
[36:42] don't just listen burnt offering the
[36:44] entire animal was sacrificed to god
[36:47] man didn't get nothing right
[36:49] right with some of the other animal
[36:51] sacrifices like the thank offering of
[36:52] different ones uh the sin offering
[36:55] god would get apart and man will get a
[36:57] part yeah but not with the burnt
[36:58] offering right
[37:00] you can take it back to noah you can
[37:01] take it back to abraham when they really
[37:03] wanted to show devotion to god it was a
[37:05] burnt offering don't worry and that
[37:07] represents god i am sacrificing all of
[37:10] me to you praise god
[37:13] hallelujah i'm giving you everything i
[37:15] have lord i'm laying over to all of
[37:17] myself i'm giving you all my thoughts
[37:19] all my time all my praise amen amen
[37:22] i'm surrendering and i'm gonna lose i'm
[37:25] gonna sacrifice so that i can worship
[37:28] you amen hallelujah what a joy to
[37:30] worship god tonight praise god
[37:33] what am i saying you can give a burnt
[37:34] offering tonight yes that's right give
[37:36] yourself holy to this service ain't
[37:38] nothing
[37:38] right
[37:40] like the preacher's not preachers have
[37:41] to do it like we'll sweat you know we'll
[37:42] give ourselves my voice will be sore the
[37:44] next three days like it was sunday night
[37:45] i'm trying to give a bird offering to
[37:47] you
[37:48] all right take it to god rather for your
[37:49] benefit praise god i've got to give my
[37:51] offering but so to you
[37:54] everyone's got to give their offering
[37:55] praise god and no notice this was every
[37:57] day the priests had to make sacrifices
[38:00] morning
[38:01] evening
[38:02] in order for god to meet with you church
[38:04] if we want god to be with us we got to
[38:06] make time to meet with him praise god
[38:08] amen amen
[38:09] oh glory amen verse 43 and there i'll
[38:12] meet with the children of israel and the
[38:14] tabernacle shall be sanctified by my
[38:16] glory so see when we want to see god's
[38:18] glory when we want to see people blessed
[38:20] or we want to weep or we want to have
[38:21] joy or we want to have the blessings of
[38:24] god the fruits of the spirit we've got
[38:25] to make the sacrifices amen and when we
[38:28] make the sacrifices god will bless our
[38:30] sacrifice we'll feel his presence we'll
[38:32] enjoy his glory we'll be happy to be a
[38:35] christian
[38:37] thank you jesus amen and i was
[38:39] sanctifying the tabernacle of the
[38:40] congregation in the altar i was thanked
[38:42] by also both aaron and the sons to
[38:43] minister to me in the priest's office
[38:45] and i will dwell among the children of
[38:47] israel and will be their god and they
[38:49] should know that i am the lord their god
[38:50] that brought them forth out of the land
[38:51] of egypt that i may dwell among them i
[38:54] am the lord your god so in church when
[38:56] we make dedicated sacrifices to god
[38:58] every single day will know god
[39:01] sure man praise god amen that's what god
[39:04] said in second corinthians chapter six
[39:05] and paul paul said
[39:07] separate yourself don't
[39:10] mix yourself uh unequally yoke with
[39:12] unbelievers come out from among them and
[39:15] i'll receive you saith the lord amen
[39:18] see god was separation that was a total
[39:20] sacrifice praise god
[39:22] like i just you know i get reminded of
[39:24] it every day almost every day i get an
[39:25] email or text some video or some sermon
[39:27] i preached was a blessing to somebody so
[39:28] today i got one from a man who uh
[39:31] married interracial marriage and he said
[39:33] i just want to encourage you for the
[39:34] courage you had to preach that with that
[39:36] video out he said that blessed me i was
[39:38] set free by that amen amen
[39:41] see every day you get the glory of god
[39:43] the glory of god comes back amen
[39:45] hallelujah you're faithful to god you
[39:47] love god you're devoted to god then the
[39:49] blessings will come back to you
[39:50] cast your bread on the waters make the
[39:52] sacrifice in the morning make the
[39:54] sacrifice in the evening and the glory
[39:56] of god will be with you amen amen
[39:58] hallelujah
[39:59] isn't that what life's about church
[40:01] helping others
[40:02] isn't that what it's about
[40:04] it's not about helping ourselves
[40:07] eternal life is about living for others
[40:09] what can we do today
[40:11] that will help somebody tomorrow
[40:14] that's what god's interested in that
[40:16] kind of living sacrifice a burnt
[40:18] offering
[40:19] we can give ourselves holy unto the lord
[40:21] now church you and i you know i know
[40:24] what we can give up and give a burnt
[40:25] offering unto god amen
[40:27] right
[40:28] and some of us get online and we do it
[40:30] well i like to shop i like the price and
[40:32] i like to get the right price sometimes
[40:34] we spend a little too much time price
[40:36] shopping praise god and we could be a
[40:38] little more devoted give a little bit

[41:08] other words
[41:09] but we all know there's areas right
[41:11] there's errors at times if we can make
[41:13] this total sacrifice unto god that we
[41:15] know we'd have a closer walk with god we
[41:17] see his glory more god
[41:20] amen amen

[41:32] even want to come up but if i call you
[41:34] up i appreciate you coming up praise god
[41:36] because i know there's power and prayer

[41:50] hallelujah amen
[41:52] it's a total sacrifice it's a burnt
[41:54] offering unto god
[41:56] amen
[41:57] morning
[41:58] evening
[42:01] and there's if you do that church you've
[42:02] got some oil in there
[42:04] got some wine in there thank god i'm
[42:06] bored again i'm gonna say that one
[42:07] tonight
[42:08] more morning
[42:11] get some oil in there praise god
[42:13] get some stimulation oh i haven't heard
[42:15] that's a beautiful thought i never heard
[42:16] that revelation before
[42:18] hallelujah and the bread of god's word
[42:20] amen amen daily bread give us this day
[42:23] our daily bread
[42:24] now
[42:26] before we start look at these individual
[42:28] furniture pieces remember this is what i
[42:30] preached years ago uh 2017-18
[42:33] no one whether jew or gentile could
[42:35] enter the tabernacle you couldn't even
[42:36] come in the gate
[42:38] until your sprinkle with the waters of
[42:40] separation
[42:41] whether you're brand new proselyte a
[42:43] gentile or a seasoned jew
[42:46] you are not getting in there if you are
[42:48] unclean
[42:50] praise god
[42:51] that's what numbers 19 is all about
[42:54] now in order to get in a red heifer had
[42:57] to die had to be totally red
[43:00] there could be one white hair on it amen
[43:02] right they only come around every every
[43:04] so many generations
[43:06] i read one place where the jews kept the
[43:08] water separation for 300 years
[43:10] can you imagine keeping a bowl of water
[43:13] without spilling it for 300 years
[43:15] now that's dedication right there
[43:17] we can have a cup in our house on the
[43:19] table spill i mean it'll spill within
[43:21] five minutes
[43:22] every cup
[43:24] yeah
[43:26] but
[43:27] the water's the separation
[43:29] 300 years they kept they would burn it
[43:32] they'd take the ashes apply water to it
[43:34] keep it in a container and if you got if
[43:37] you were by a dead body or if you
[43:39] contacted contacting anything dead they
[43:41] had to sprinkle you with that and then
[43:43] seven days later you could come back to
[43:44] the house of god
[43:45] but you were not coming to the house of
[43:47] god without being sprinkled that's right
[43:49] church
[43:50] that's why we shouldn't come to church
[43:52] with bad attitudes
[43:54] that's why we shouldn't come to church
[43:55] with bitterness between each other all
[43:57] right
[43:58] right
[43:58] we shouldn't come to church with with
[44:01] with sins in our lives in other words we
[44:03] should be sprinkled before we come even
[44:05] in the dark amen
[44:06] we should be clean we should be accepted
[44:09] in the sight of god and
[44:10] we shouldn't come here we should know
[44:12] better glory we got to grow up and
[44:13] mature praise god before i come in those
[44:16] doors everything's right between my
[44:18] savior and i praise god amen amen
[44:22] that's what that last one is about the
[44:23] fifth application
[44:25] will ramp said from one side to the
[44:27] other typing everything even the water
[44:28] separation the red heifer couldn't be a
[44:30] brown one
[44:34] they made the waters of separation to
[44:35] sprinkle the people after they'd sinned
[44:37] and gone outside the camp now they
[44:38] hissed up the cedar wood all mixed
[44:40] together how the wood and the tabernacle
[44:41] all the bracing altar the labor the shoe
[44:43] red everything pointed to christ and in
[44:45] him we are complete in jesus christ
[44:48] everything in the tabernacle points to
[44:50] jesus christ here it does
[44:53] the bible said jesus was without spot or
[44:55] blemish just like the red heifer
[44:57] there never came a yoke on the red
[45:00] heifer brother rabbit says jesus was
[45:02] never in the yolk of a denomination
[45:04] praise god and the bible said the red
[45:06] heifer had to be killed outside of the
[45:08] camp that's right and the bible said
[45:11] jesus died outside the city that's right
[45:13] outside the canyon that's right
[45:16] see christ was not yoked with any
[45:17] organization
[45:19] he didn't fool with them he wasn't yoked
[45:21] up with all this nothing he says
[45:23] now here's a picture and our arse idea
[45:25] of the red heifer look how far away it
[45:27] was outside the camp that's that's the
[45:29] solomon's time look at that big
[45:30] solomon's temple there
[45:32] this is how far the red heifer had to be
[45:35] because this was going to become sin
[45:38] right this had to die as a sacrifice
[45:40] this couldn't be inside the camp it had
[45:42] to be outside the camp church
[45:45] it had to die outside the camp it had to
[45:47] be cursed so they could be class amen
[45:50] jesus had to be cursed with our sins
[45:52] that we could be washed amen amen
[45:55] praise god
[45:56] and then before they sprinkled anybody
[45:58] they had to take that blood of the
[46:00] heifer and sprinkle it seven times at
[46:02] the door of the tabernacle standing for
[46:05] seven church ages praise god
[46:08] hallelujah right and the bible said
[46:10] jesus is one red heifer sacrifice was
[46:13] once and for all praise god in church i
[46:15] was happy to say there was blood for
[46:17] ephesus submyrna pergamos thyrotira
[46:20] sardis philadelphia and thank god
[46:22] there's blood for laodicea today
[46:25] thank god there's blood for you and i am
[46:28] amen the same love that forgave martin
[46:31] luther the same blood that forgave paul
[46:33] the same blood that forgave brother
[46:35] branham is the same blood that forgives
[46:37] you and i praise god amen hallelujah
[46:40] amen
[46:41] the red heifer was the one that died
[46:43] praise god that was the perfect
[46:45] sacrifice amen and all of us sinners
[46:48] benefit from it
[46:51] thank god amen thank you jesus for the
[46:53] blood of light amen
[46:54] now there's a picture of taking the
[46:56] ashes and you know putting the water in
[46:58] there and then here's a picture of the
[46:59] hyssop they would take the hyster before
[47:01] they came in and they had to sprinkle
[47:02] the people that were unclean maybe they
[47:04] touched a dead body of an animal or
[47:05] maybe maybe someone died in their home
[47:09] and they saw they walked in on us they
[47:10] had to be sprinkled
[47:14] and there's a picture of hyssop i mean
[47:15] it's just there's some that are purple
[47:17] and some that are not so i don't know if
[47:18] they lose their purpleness at the end of
[47:20] the season i don't know
[47:22] but david said purge me with hyssop and
[47:24] i shall be clean wash me i'll be
[47:26] watering snow this is after he committed
[47:28] the adulterous act and murder all right
[47:30] he says lord let that hyster be taken
[47:33] let that priest bring that hyssop over
[47:35] to me and let it be sprinkled i want to
[47:37] come back to the house of god i want to
[47:39] be right again create in me a clean
[47:42] heart oh god amen
[47:45] renew a steadfast spirit in me they
[47:47] don't compromise with lust or murder or
[47:50] anger created me a heart like yours
[47:54] what's he going to use his son common
[47:56] brother says just common it's all around
[47:59] history you can find it anywhere common
[48:00] faith
[48:03] the blood of jesus christ applies the
[48:05] spirit of god just applied just commonly
[48:07] in other words like a common prayer lord
[48:09] forgive me i am so
[48:11] i confess that i did this i should not
[48:13] have done it i knew better i've done
[48:15] this before forgive me just get
[48:16] sprinkled with a common sprinkle that's
[48:18] right
[48:23] every single person imagine if someone
[48:25] died or dog died or animal diet you've
[48:27] got to get sprinkled this was a common
[48:29] everyday occurrence you go down there if
[48:31] you imagine if you took it if i just
[48:32] took it and just sprinkled you right in
[48:33] the face you know you you close your
[48:35] eyes and
[48:36] you know you just you'd accept it but
[48:38] that was god's way if you even want to
[48:40] get in this tabernacle first you got to
[48:42] accept the sprinkling and peter said we
[48:45] should be sprinkled with the blood of
[48:46] jesus christ
[48:48] in other words we should receive an
[48:50] anointing a small anointing of god's
[48:52] spirit to repent of our sins amen
[48:55] amen i was clean but then i got dirty by
[48:58] watching this or by saying that or
[49:00] thinking that or planning this or lying
[49:03] about that yeah that's right i got dirty
[49:06] i knew better the lord now cleanse me
[49:08] and the bible said you were cleansed
[49:11] it was very simple praise god very
[49:13] simple
[49:14] jesus
[49:15] i want to cleanse you with common issue
[49:18] praise god common faith right common
[49:20] confession
[49:21] if any man says he doesn't have sins
[49:23] that man's a liar
[49:25] ah but thank god there's plenty of
[49:28] on the road to the tabernacle right now
[49:30] just grab the heads up or the priest
[49:32] priest grab the history sprinkle me wash
[49:34] me because i want to be a worshiper amen
[49:37] hallelujah praise god
[49:39] don't leave me out of the tabernacle i
[49:42] want to worship i want to be in god's
[49:44] presence amen
[49:45] hallelujah
[49:49] now this other idea
[49:52] all the males had to appear at least
[49:53] three times a year before the
[49:56] uh before the lord at the tabernacle
[49:59] and that was at the season the third
[50:00] month
[50:01] uh would have been the fifth month and
[50:03] the seventh month okay for the seven
[50:04] feasts but
[50:06] some of the feasts are together right we
[50:07] know that there's three feasts in the
[50:09] third month there's one feast in the
[50:10] fifth month that's the feast of weeks
[50:11] and there's three months or three feasts
[50:13] in the seventh month okay so in other
[50:15] words disappear three times and you'll
[50:16] hit all the seven festivals
[50:18] praise god
[50:20] and now notice the bible says when you
[50:21] come i want to see this i want you to
[50:23] see this church
[50:24] those men shall not ever say not
[50:27] appear before the lord empty don't come
[50:29] to church with your hands empty
[50:33] i'm only asking you to come three times
[50:35] a year
[50:36] right
[50:37] guys like when you come bring a
[50:39] sacrifice
[50:41] bring something praise god because as
[50:44] every man as he's able
[50:46] what are we able to bring god i'm not
[50:47] asking for money i'm asking for you to
[50:50] bring god a song or bring god a worship
[50:53] or bring god yourself make yourself a
[50:55] priest unto god let god use you tonight
[50:58] even get in the spirit and god will give
[51:00] you a word of wisdom or a word of
[51:01] knowledge or a tone or interpretation
[51:04] don't come empty come full say god use
[51:06] me i'm giving myself as a sacrifice
[51:11] how many times have we had that
[51:13] like remember when sister naomi helped
[51:15] out sister lydia
[51:16] i don't know if you remember that i
[51:18] prayed for lydia it wasn't helping
[51:21] but our sister dealt with her and she
[51:23] said as soon as she gave that testimony
[51:25] uh lydia said just like the holy spirit
[51:27] just gave her a clear perfect
[51:29] all all the pressure all the pain all
[51:32] the all the depression just left right
[51:34] there
[51:38] you never know how it's going to be
[51:39] so you got to be sensitive to the holy
[51:41] spirit praise god praise the lord that's
[51:43] right you never know
[51:45] sure someone needs some something in the
[51:47] prayer line you say the preacher will
[51:48] say just the right thing you need to
[51:50] hear and god will answer the prayer amen
[51:53] you never know
[51:54] but don't come empty come and give to
[51:57] god as you're able
[51:59] give base upon the conditions that god
[52:02] bless
[52:06] that's my church i don't mind coming to
[52:07] church and looking like a fool because i
[52:09] come here to give god praise because
[52:11] he's blessed me so much amen amen
[52:14] how can i not give you grace i cannot
[52:16] put on that crazy silly jesus hat that
[52:18] looks like looks like a gangster hat
[52:20] because god healed my mama cancer i'll
[52:22] do anything to tell people that jesus
[52:24] loves him he's alive he still heals
[52:27] because he's been so good to me he's
[52:28] blessed me i'll do anything for him
[52:30] praise god i don't want to come empty
[52:33] i'm going to come full and give god a
[52:35] real sacrifice
[52:36] [Music]
[52:37] amen notice the men not sisters are not
[52:40] excused but
[52:41] he puts the emphasis on those leaders
[52:44] praise god
[52:46] hallelujah
[52:51] now there was so many ways to sacrifice
[52:54] if you couldn't make so if you could you
[52:56] just came those three times well there
[52:58] were still times if you were a leper and
[53:00] you got healed you still had to go
[53:03] you had to go as soon as you were healed
[53:04] and offer a sacrifice that's right when
[53:06] a woman had a baby
[53:09] male or female she had to go right away
[53:11] and after she was healed up she'd go
[53:12] right away and make a sacrifice
[53:14] even church even when your beasts had
[53:17] babies that's right
[53:19] the church said yeah right
[53:21] even when your animals had babies you
[53:24] got to go sacrifice for the firstborn
[53:26] some other animal had to die because you
[53:28] had first-born bulls yeah
[53:31] or first-born cows or whatever it may be
[53:33] you had to sacrifice other animals
[53:36] for those
[53:37] imagine how often you'd be in the house
[53:39] of god probably like this right
[53:41] right like us amen
[53:43] constant
[53:45] sacrifices
[53:46] but this is god and god was showing the
[53:49] world this is my people
[53:51] these are my kingdom of priests these
[53:54] are people that know me better than
[53:55] anybody else this is the nation that
[53:57] knows me i'll exalt them i'll use them
[53:59] this was the nation that god carved
[54:02] mighty men out of this nation amen
[54:05] not the other nations this nation a
[54:07] nation of kingdom of priests who
[54:10] sacrifice who believe god's word
[54:13] amen
[54:15] church
[54:17] one day during the year the bible says
[54:19] there was one day when god
[54:21] forgave everything for the whole year
[54:24] this year it's october 4th and 5th it's
[54:26] called yom kippur yeah
[54:29] it starts on the sundown of october 4th
[54:32] and ends on the sundown of october 5th
[54:35] that's the day of atonement that's the
[54:36] day where god says i'm going to forgive
[54:38] everybody's sins at this day
[54:42] and only the high priest could go
[54:45] once a year the bible said but not
[54:46] without blood
[54:48] amen
[54:49] if we're going to be forgiven we need
[54:51] blood
[54:52] amen that's why we have to trust in the
[54:55] blood of jesus christ pray about the
[54:57] blood of jesus christ
[54:58] think about the blood of jesus christ
[55:00] amen amen
[55:02] focus on the blood of jesus christ
[55:05] need amen
[55:06] because we're saved without works amen
[55:08] amen that blood took our place nothing
[55:11] we did everything he did praise god amen
[55:14] that's the lord god almighty
[55:17] so leviticus 16 if you want to read it
[55:19] at home this entire chapter details the
[55:21] day of atonement there's like
[55:23] my goodness i looked up the website
[55:25] there's about 20 or 30 40 things to do
[55:27] on this day it was a day filled with all
[55:29] these types and shadows the high priest
[55:31] had to do things the people had to do
[55:32] things there's just so much
[55:35] it was an annual year-long
[55:37] atonement
[55:38] foreshadowing jesus once for all
[55:40] atonement with his own blood
[55:42] praise god
[55:44] so see it was once in the year
[55:46] once in the year everybody had a clean
[55:48] state that's kind of how a perversion of
[55:51] january 1st in america oh everybody gets
[55:54] a new start everybody's going to go on a
[55:56] diet how long does that last
[55:59] once a year we got a fresh start church
[56:01] again i'm a fresh start every single day
[56:02] praise god and i thought there's more
[56:04] power than that just having a fresh
[56:05] start every day today's a new day
[56:08] right
[56:10] i didn't do good yesterday i'm gonna
[56:11] start a new day today praise god i'm
[56:12] gonna get on a roll by god's grace
[56:14] with everything spiritually and
[56:15] naturally
[56:18] but the bible said in hebrews 10 10 once
[56:20] and for all jesus gave a sacrifice one
[56:23] sacrifice for all sins amen praise god
[56:27] lamb of god now here's here's a visual
[56:29] for you now
[56:31] here's the tabernacle remember you
[56:33] before you could even get in the gate
[56:36] you've got to be sprinkled if you were
[56:37] unclean
[56:39] right
[56:40] now if you were not unclean you could
[56:42] just walk right in there without your
[56:43] time the first thing you would see is a
[56:45] brace and altar that's where the animal
[56:46] died we'll get to that the laver was a a
[56:49] pool of water
[56:51] where the the priests washed their hands
[56:54] after the killing of the animal
[56:56] and then here's the holy place now this
[56:57] is actually two rooms austelina uh
[57:00] the holy place is the small uh the
[57:03] yeah the bigger room and the small room
[57:04] is the holiest of holiness right
[57:08] okay so we'll go through this
[57:11] and this is a great lesson
[57:13] i've used this in my life i use it all
[57:15] the time
[57:16] sure all the time yeah
[57:18] this is how i picture myself in every
[57:19] service
[57:23] now if you could zoom out here is what
[57:27] here's what god saw
