[0:03] Daniel chapter 4. I want to preach on
[0:06] watchers and destroying angels tonight.
[0:08] I think this is part five in the series,
[0:10] but I'm not really putting numbers on it
[0:12] uh on the YouTube.
[0:16] So, Daniel chapter 4, this is the
[0:18] chapter of the king's proclamation,
[0:20] Nebuchadnezzar's proclamation, and the
[0:22] tree vision of Nebuchadnezzar.
[0:24] And the tree vision is interpreted
[0:27] and then fulfilled where Nebuchadnezzar
[0:29] is out of his uh kingdom for seven
[0:32] years. We all remember the Daniel uh
[0:34] play by sight and sound. That was
[0:35] phenomenal.
[0:38] So we learn in this chapter of a new
[0:41] kind of an angel which I never I mean I
[0:43] read the Bible numerous times but I
[0:45] never quite caught that this was a
[0:46] different kind of angel as far as I
[0:48] understand now. But let's just read uh
[0:50] verse 13. Daniel 4:13.
[0:54] And there could be some overlap. Again,
[0:56] this is a minor topic. This not a major
[0:58] topic. So, if I'm wrong on something,
[0:59] you just forgive me and pray that God
[1:01] will reveal it to to me or or or talk to
[1:03] me after service and tell me how maybe
[1:06] something a little deeper in the word of
[1:07] God that I could understand. But, uh,
[1:09] this is just a beautiful topic. I love
[1:11] the topic of angels. Praise God. Reminds
[1:13] us of his presence, how how close he is,
[1:15] how near he is to us.
[1:18] Amen.
[1:20] So Daniel 4:13, let's look at watchers
[1:22] and destroying angels tonight.
[1:26] If you're there, say amen.
[1:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; Let's just read uh verse 13. Then we'll
[1:30] have a short word of prayer here
[1:31] tonight. Daniel 4:13. Let's hear your
[1:34] voices. Let's read that on three. 1 2 3.
[1:36] I saw in the visions of my head upon my
[1:40] bed, and behold, a watcher and an holy
[1:44] one came down from heaven. If you have a
[1:46] need on your heart, let's make a known
[1:48] to God. God, let's have one more word of
[1:49] prayer. Father God, we're thankful for
[1:51] tonight. Lord, we just ask, God, that
[1:52] your Holy Spirit would anoint the word
[1:54] of God. Help me to get out of your way,
[1:55] Lord God. I've done this many times, but
[1:57] every time I still need your your help,
[1:59] Lord, greatly. I greatly need your help
[2:01] because I'm a man and I battle. I need
[2:04] your grace, and I want to surrender. I
[2:05] want to be a true servant, Lord, just
[2:06] like all the servants down through the
[2:08] age, Lord God, that you'd help me
[2:10] rightly divide the word of truth and
[2:11] you'd anoint me, God, for this time and
[2:13] season of the lives of the saints here
[2:14] in Akran, Ohio. So, Father, we'll give
[2:17] you thanks and praise, Lord God. Let
[2:18] your will be done here and speak your
[2:20] truth through me and hear through them
[2:22] and through me as well. Lord, I want to
[2:23] hear their truth and I want to have a
[2:26] revelation of this. So, bless your
[2:27] people. Hallelujah. And bless the
[2:29] birthday saints for this month. Lord,
[2:31] and bless the guest minister, Brother
[2:33] Dale, as he comes here on Sunday. We
[2:34] look forward to meeting him and his
[2:35] wife. Lord, may this be the start of
[2:37] another wonderful friendship. We ask all
[2:39] these blessings in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:41] And the saints said, "Amen."
[2:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you're being
[2:44] seated. Praise God.
[2:50] Amen. So, we want to look at this here
[2:52] uh with this watchers here and uh trust
[2:55] it be a blessing to you in a little bit.
[2:57] I'll have a a visual in just a little
[2:59] bit and I want to show a visual here uh
[3:01] by the grace of the Lord. Now, we're in
[3:04] Daniel chapter 4. Again, uh familiar
[3:07] book for most of us here. Daniel is very
[3:08] prophetic uh just like John and Ezekiel.
[3:11] And brother Brandham gave us revelations
[3:13] in both of these books. tremendous
[3:15] revelations especially regarding the
[3:16] book of revelation. Uh but let's just
[3:19] read here uh on the watchers again here.
[3:22] Uh I got a couple notes I want to
[3:23] reference here. Now again watchers could
[3:26] be a separate type of an angel or they
[3:28] could be perhaps a cherubam or something
[3:30] like that. Now we know they're
[3:32] definitely not seraraphims because
[3:34] they're never talked about in this
[3:35] chapter about bringing any fire down
[3:37] from God. And remember last time I
[3:39] looked at this, you know, the seraraphim
[3:41] could also be ceiling angels as well.
[3:43] They could be, but I don't know for
[3:44] sure. So, at this time, I think I got
[3:46] seven or eight different eight different
[3:48] angels uh that could possibly be or
[3:52] there could be less. But we know as far
[3:54] as the number there's there's
[3:55] innumerable number of angels.
[3:58] Hallelujah. So, let's look at again
[4:00] verseh 13. I saw in the visions of my
[4:04] head upon my bed, and behold, a watcher
[4:08] and an holy one came down from heaven.
[4:10] That's what Jesus taught us. They ascend
[4:12] and descend. Right? Verse 14.
[4:15] And he cried aloud and said, "Thus, hew
[4:17] down the tree and cut off his branches.
[4:19] Shake off his leaves and scatter his
[4:21] fruit. Let the beast get away from under
[4:24] and the fowls from his branches." So
[4:26] this is speaking of a tree, but we know
[4:28] it's actually King Nebuchadnezzar
[4:31] because men are likened under trees,
[4:34] right? And this is from uh becoming
[4:36] familiar to me again. Remember Joseph's
[4:38] dream of the baker and the butler?
[4:39] Weren't they trees? I could be wrong on
[4:41] that. I could be wrong on that, but if
[4:43] they were then maybe remember the birds
[4:45] came upon their heads, brother Chris.
[4:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I Yeah, that was part of his
[4:51] uh the dream of Pharaoh. But there was a
[4:53] one of the dreams of the butler and
[4:54] baker as well. So that that's uh that's
[4:57] that's more dreams in Genesis, which is
[4:59] good. Yeah, that's okay, brother. That's
[5:02] totally fine, brother. So I was I just
[5:04] thought of that now about men as trees.
[5:08] So anyways, let's go to verse 15.
[5:09] Nevertheless, leave the stump of his
[5:11] roots in the earth, even with a band of
[5:13] iron and brass in the tender grass of
[5:15] the field, and let it be wet with the
[5:16] dew of heaven, and let his portion be
[5:17] with the beast in the grass of the
[5:19] earth. Verse 16, let his heart be
[5:22] changed from man's, and let a beast
[5:24] heart be given unto him, and let seven
[5:27] times pass over. This is an amazing
[5:29] story. God takes the human spirit out of
[5:32] Nebuchadnezzar and gives him a beast
[5:34] spirit
[5:35] for seven times. Times are years, right?
[5:38] So seven times is seven years. Verse 17,
[5:41] this matter is by the decree of the
[5:43] watchers.
[5:44] Notice they're watchers, right? So
[5:46] there's more than one watcher. So
[5:48] there's a certain type of angel that's
[5:49] called a watcher. Or again, it could be
[5:51] a cherubam. Uh not not certain. And the
[5:54] demand by the word of the holy ones.
[5:56] Again, holy ones would be angels. to the
[5:59] intent that the living may know that the
[6:01] Most High ruleth in the kingdom of
[6:03] heaven and giveth it to whomsoever he
[6:05] will and setth it up over I'm sorry
[6:08] setth up over it the beast of men.
[6:11] Hallelujah. So this was all done to show
[6:14] Nebuchadnezzar that God places the
[6:17] leaders on the earth. Right? So who
[6:21] placed Joe Biden as president? It was
[6:23] God. Who placed Donald Trump and Barack
[6:26] Obama? each one. God allowed them to be
[6:28] there,
[6:30] &gt;&gt; right? Either for good or for evil,
[6:32] right? It's God. God does this. But then
[6:36] God sends down decrees from heaven
[6:38] through watchers. And he makes decrees.
[6:41] Okay? Now, I'm going to go down uh uh
[6:43] further. Let's go down to verse 20.
[6:45] Let's go down to 22 and 23. It is thou,
[6:47] king, thou art grown and become strong.
[6:49] This is Daniel giving the
[6:50] interpretation. For thy greatness has
[6:52] grown and reachth unto heaven and thy
[6:53] dominion to the end of the earth. And
[6:54] whereas the king saw a watcher and a
[6:57] holy one come down from heaven and
[6:59] saying, "Huewe down the tree, I'm sorry,
[7:02] he the tree down and destroy it, yet
[7:03] leave the stump of the roots thereof in
[7:05] the earth, even with a band of iron and
[7:07] brass in the tender grass of the field,
[7:09] and let it be wet with the dew of
[7:10] heaven, and let his portion be with the
[7:12] beast of the field, till seven times
[7:14] pass over him." Okay, so those are the
[7:18] three times church. As far as I can
[7:19] find, there's only three times the word
[7:21] watcher appears as angel and it's all in
[7:24] this chapter. So they're from heaven.
[7:26] They're called watchers. They're called
[7:27] holy ones. And they execute God's decree
[7:30] on earth in bringing humility to
[7:34] Nebuchadnezzar.
[7:35] &gt;&gt; So remember, God's the same yesterday,
[7:37] today, and forever. So if God was going
[7:39] to humble a leader on earth or
[7:40] something, he might use a watcher. They
[7:42] might see an angel. They would see an
[7:44] angel, right? and it would they would
[7:46] have some decree or some dream and that
[7:49] would bring a temporary judgment on them
[7:51] for a humility purpose.
[7:54] &gt;&gt; Okay? Because remember he's the same
[7:55] yesterday, today and forever. That's why
[7:57] we said with saraphims if one seraphim
[7:59] came to Isaiah, well then it's likely
[8:01] seraraphim could go to another believer
[8:03] and the Holy Ghost fire could clean out
[8:06] their mouth, right? They could get an
[8:08] anointing from an angel and now they
[8:11] could speak for God because their mouth
[8:12] has been cleaned out. And the church
[8:14] said,
[8:15] &gt;&gt; "So, because he's the same yesterday,
[8:16] today, and forever. There's not just one
[8:18] saraphim. There's saraphims. There's not
[8:20] just one watcher. There's watchers.
[8:22] There's not just one cherub. There's
[8:24] cherubims." Hallelujah. There's not one
[8:26] archangel, there's uh princes. Right?
[8:29] The other word is princes. Right?
[8:31] Archangels could be princes as well. So,
[8:34] we see there's more than one of each of
[8:35] these. Hallelujah. Okay. So, we see the
[8:39] watcher there. Now that's all I have for
[8:42] watchers because that's just the three
[8:43] scriptures on watchers. Hallelujah. So
[8:46] let's go to destroying angel here. Now
[8:48] this would be the uh the eighth and
[8:50] final type of angel and we want to read
[8:53] a couple examples here uh by God's
[8:56] grace. So let's go if we could uh to
[8:59] let's go to 2 Samuel 24:16. And you can
[9:03] pull it up there when you're ready, but
[9:04] everybody can turn there. 2 Samuel
[9:07] 24:16.
[9:11] Now remember this was from uh David's
[9:13] time. Now remember I preached on David a
[9:14] couple times this year uh and one of
[9:17] those wonderful to me it was a small
[9:19] revelation but it was a revelation that
[9:21] Satan moved David to number the people
[9:24] and God allowed it in order to punish
[9:26] the people.
[9:28] So both both groups were guilty. David
[9:31] was guilty of sin pride right and then
[9:34] the 70,000 were guilty of something as
[9:36] well. We don't know what. But God had to
[9:38] bring a punishment on both of them. A
[9:41] temporary chastisement.
[9:44] So God allowed Satan to tempt David to
[9:46] number the people. He did. And then when
[9:49] he did,
[9:51] uh, the Bible said a destroying angel
[9:53] came down. Now, think about that,
[9:54] church. There's angels that are sent to
[9:56] destroy, but thank God, there's angels
[9:58] that are sent to save. Hallelujah. Amen.
[10:02] Hallelujah. So, see, the angels have
[10:03] different priorities and jobs, right?
[10:05] Some just destroy men. Others seal men
[10:09] until the day of their redemption.
[10:11] Hallelujah.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the angels, they're just, they
[10:14] don't have a choice, right? God just
[10:16] assigns them. You're destroying, you're
[10:17] sealing. You're watcher. You're a
[10:20] ministering spirit angel. God just gives
[10:21] them all their assignments. And thank
[10:23] God, they carry everything out the right
[10:25] way.
[10:26] &gt;&gt; They're faithful servants. Hallelujah.
[10:28] They're holy. They've never sinned
[10:30] before. Praise God. And they will do the
[10:32] will of God. they will be a messenger
[10:34] for God Almighty. But this angel comes
[10:37] out and he stretches out his hand upon
[10:39] Jerusalem to destroy him. And then the
[10:41] Lord repents him of the evil and said to
[10:43] the angel that destroyed the people,
[10:45] "It's enough. Stay thou stay thou thine
[10:47] hand." Now notice he just stretches out
[10:50] his hand and he was going to destroy the
[10:52] entire city just with his hand.
[10:55] So church, we see all these X-Men
[10:57] movies, right? And they got things
[10:58] coming out of their hands. What is that?
[11:00] That's a perversion, right? Because God
[11:02] has literal angels that can stretch out
[11:04] their hand and destroy entire cities.
[11:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this is the power of God
[11:10] on display that we see here by God's
[11:13] grace. He said, "Stay now thine hand."
[11:15] And the angel Lord was by the threshing
[11:17] place of Aruna, the Jebusite. Now, let's
[11:20] look at a parallel passage. 1 Chronicles
[11:23] 21:15. Hun
[11:25] 1st Chronicles 21:15. Here's a parallel
[11:27] passage.
[11:29] And God sent an angel into Jerusalem to
[11:31] destroy it. And as he was destroying,
[11:32] the Lord beheld. He he repented him of
[11:34] the evil and said to the angel that
[11:35] destroyed it, it is enough. Stay thou in
[11:37] hand. And the angel stood by the
[11:39] threshing for of Ornan the Jebusite.
[11:42] Hallelujah. So we see a parallel
[11:44] passage.
[11:46] Now also in the passage, I don't have it
[11:47] in front of me, but the Bible said the
[11:49] angel was above the city. So the angel's
[11:51] just hovering over the city. He
[11:52] stretches out a hand and people start
[11:55] dying. The record was 70,000 from
[11:58] previous uh verses. 70,000 men die from
[12:02] one angel.
[12:04] Hallelujah. Now, that's not the most
[12:05] recorded in scripture. The most was in
[12:07] the days of Hezekiah, which I mentioned,
[12:09] I think, a couple weeks ago, but let's
[12:11] read that. 2 Kings 19:35.
[12:15] As far as I'm aware, the largest number
[12:17] of men killed by one angel was almost
[12:20] 200,000.
[12:22] Right? It's 185,000 here. And it came to
[12:25] pass that night that the angel Lord went
[12:27] out and smoke in the camp of the
[12:29] Assyrians 104 score and 5,000. And when
[12:33] they arose early in the morning, behold,
[12:35] they were all dead corpses. That's more
[12:37] than the population of Akran, Ohio.
[12:40] Brother Chris,
[12:45] &gt;&gt; um
[12:46] I don't remember, brother. I don't I
[12:48] don't think so. I think that this was a
[12:50] separate destroying angel. I'd have to
[12:52] read the entire context. I'm not sure,
[12:54] brother. That's a good question. It's a
[12:55] great question. I recorded it as a
[12:57] destroying angel. So, but I didn't
[12:59] record all the details fully. So, good
[13:01] great question, brother. Great question.
[13:03] I don't know. Now, look at that. 185,000
[13:07] in one spot. You got 70,000 in another
[13:09] spot. So, would it be would it be hard
[13:11] at all for God uh to destroy people? Uh
[13:14] we'd say at the battle of Armageddon,
[13:16] would it be hard at all for God to burn
[13:18] the earth over and start it again? No.
[13:21] It's so simple, right? God's so
[13:22] powerful. He gives that angel that much
[13:24] power. He just stretches out his hand.
[13:27] 70,000 die. Another one, uh, he just
[13:30] stretches out his hand over the army.
[13:32] Almost 200,000 die. God. In other words,
[13:34] God is not afraid of any of our enemies.
[13:37] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then again, church, if
[13:40] anything bad would happen to us, you
[13:42] have to trust God that God allowed it.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; Right. But we also have to know if we're
[13:47] in distress, cry out to God. Because if
[13:49] God can take care of 185,000, God can
[13:52] take care of our enemies as well.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; Whether they physical or spiritual, God
[13:57] can deliver us from whatever the problem
[13:59] is. It just gives us such a confidence
[14:01] in God that God can do anything. God can
[14:04] do whatever he wants. Hallelujah.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; It's so it's so wonderful. It's such a
[14:08] blessing to know that he with one angel,
[14:10] he can just knock off almost 200,000.
[14:13] Probably more than that he could if he
[14:15] wanted to. So, now we've been through
[14:17] eight angels, church. Eight angels, at
[14:19] least by different titles in the King
[14:22] James version. Hallelujah. Now, here's
[14:25] what I want to finish with. Uh, because
[14:27] I'm already talking about finishing. I
[14:28] got a half hour to finish here. By God's
[14:29] grace, actually made a really good time
[14:31] today.
[14:33] So, if you can switch over, hun, I'm
[14:35] going to pull up uh this. I want to go
[14:36] through this visual and then we'll go
[14:38] through uh I want to review this here
[14:40] because I want to go through the angels
[14:42] uh the the most important angel
[14:45] movements in the book of Revelation.
[14:47] Okay. Now, it's been a while. Uh I don't
[14:50] remember the last time I showed this. Um
[14:52] but I I think I made this last January.
[14:55] I I did I spent some time I did an
[14:57] updated version of this
[15:00] and this is one I was criticized for
[15:02] online because I believe the
[15:03] tribulation's seven years. Now, let me
[15:05] just say it plainly. I understand why
[15:07] they criticize me because if you listen
[15:10] after the seals, Brother Ram just says
[15:12] three and a half all the time. Okay? So,
[15:16] just make that clear. I understand why
[15:18] people criticize me. And I understand
[15:19] why. If you look after the seals, it's
[15:22] always three and a half. But if you look
[15:24] from Daniel 70 weeks, it was four times.
[15:26] He said it was seven years.
[15:28] Now, and the reason why I stay with the
[15:30] seven years is because when I do the
[15:32] calculations of Daniel 70 weeks, it
[15:34] looks like there's still seven years
[15:36] left. And since I got quotes on it, and
[15:39] since the math lines up for me, I go
[15:41] with those quotes.
[15:43] But I know the majority quotes say three
[15:45] and a half years, I understand that. But
[15:47] also, there's that quote. Brother Random
[15:48] says, "The math was perfect in Daniel uh
[15:52] Daniel 70 weeks, 1961."
[15:54] So, he said, "The math is perfect.
[15:56] There's seven years left for Israel.
[15:59] So, so I'm on the side of less quotes,
[16:03] but I believe I'm also on the side of
[16:05] the correct math. But church, what would
[16:07] Brother Ram say? Brother Ram would say,
[16:09] "It doesn't matter. It wouldn't hurt
[16:10] because it's on the other side of the
[16:12] rapture."
[16:13] &gt;&gt; Because I just showed you that quote.
[16:15] Hallelujah. He said, "Most of these
[16:17] questions are after the rapture." So, he
[16:19] says, "It doesn't matter anyway. It
[16:20] wouldn't hurt if we disagree anyway."
[16:23] But again, I agree with Brother Brandham
[16:25] from that sermon 1961. I know he changed
[16:28] his mind, but I agree with that sermon.
[16:30] Okay? So, just so you know, I sometimes
[16:32] I do I do accept criticism. I I I
[16:35] understand why people would criticize
[16:36] me. I understand that, right? So, I
[16:40] accept that. That's fine. And I don't
[16:41] want to be mean to them. I just want to
[16:42] be loving by God's grace. So, uh the
[16:45] first event is the rapture of the bride.
[16:48] Okay? We have the scriptures on them.
[16:50] Once the bride goes up, God cuts off the
[16:53] gentile branch and he grafts in Israel.
[16:56] Hallelujah. There uh Israel is grafted
[16:59] back into the holy tree. Okay. Next uh
[17:02] and then this and then this time period
[17:04] is called Jacob's trouble or the sixth
[17:06] seal.
[17:09] All right. Now, the first half of the
[17:11] 70th week is basically the torment
[17:14] ministry of Moses and Elijah. Now, the
[17:17] reason I use torment is because the
[17:18] Bible uses that word
[17:20] &gt;&gt; in Revelation chapter 11. I'm trying to
[17:22] use Bible words as much as possible.
[17:25] Okay.
[17:28] And that's three and a half years. The
[17:29] Bible tells us the exact number of days,
[17:31] 1,260.
[17:33] And there's no rain in at least in at
[17:35] least in Jerusalem during that time or
[17:37] Israel as far as that time. I don't know
[17:39] how far it extends. But the Bible said
[17:41] they cause it not to rain during the
[17:42] days of their prophecy. So, it's going
[17:45] to get really dry again, right? And then
[17:48] they're able to turn the water to blood
[17:50] like Moses. So, no rain like Elijah,
[17:52] water to blood like Moses. So, it's
[17:54] probably the two prophets are Moses and
[17:56] Elijah. Now, Brother Ram says in 1961,
[17:59] it's either those two men or men with
[18:01] their spirits. Okay? But we don't know
[18:04] for sure. We don't have thus sayith the
[18:06] Lord. So, we don't know if it's those
[18:07] men or not. They asked Brother Ram in
[18:10] 1964. They said they said, "Are those
[18:12] men on the earth right now?" Brother Ram
[18:13] said, "Definitely not." So, I don't know
[18:15] what I don't know what he he knew to say
[18:18] that. It wasn't thus sayith the Lord,
[18:20] but it's just a striking statement.
[18:22] Okay. Now, right after the rapture, the
[18:24] Pope makes a seven-year covenant with
[18:27] Israel. Now, they just made peace now,
[18:29] but church, I don't know if that's going
[18:30] to last. I doubt that's going to last,
[18:32] right? Trump tried to make some peace
[18:34] with Israel and uh Hamas this week. Who
[18:37] knows?
[18:38] I don't know. Alls we know is the Bible
[18:40] said all the nations are going to come
[18:41] up against Israel at the end of the
[18:42] tribulation period
[18:44] &gt;&gt; and Jesus is going to send out of heaven
[18:45] and destroy them with the sword of his
[18:47] mouth. Okay, that's all we know. Now,
[18:50] uh, third, the temple's going to be
[18:52] rebuilt and there's going to be animal
[18:54] sacrifices. Now, I came across a good
[18:57] scripture. Let me look it up real quick.
[18:58] I think I I think I shared this with
[19:00] everyone. Um, you know, I've always
[19:02] thought we have to have the temple in
[19:05] order to uh sacrifice animals, but
[19:08] that's not true. If you got your Bible,
[19:10] get Ezra 3:6. If you have your Bible, go
[19:12] to Ezra 36.
[19:15] And I just want you to read this here.
[19:17] Ezra 3:6. This this verse I just read it
[19:20] a few months ago. In fact, it was uh
[19:23] July 30th. I got the email. I sent I
[19:24] always send emails to myself when I have
[19:26] good ideas or fresh ideas.
[19:29] Ezra 3:6, from the first day of the
[19:31] seventh month began they to offer burnt
[19:33] offerings unto the Lord. But the
[19:36] foundation of the temple was not uh
[19:38] sorry, temple of the Lord was not yet
[19:39] laid. So what do we learn from this? We
[19:41] learn from this God let Israel kill
[19:44] animals before they had the temple even
[19:46] built.
[19:48] So if he's the same yesterday, today,
[19:49] and forever, he can allow that again
[19:52] here at the end time. So church, if we
[19:55] hear that Israel sacrifice animals,
[19:57] praise the Lord.
[19:59] That's not the sign of the rapture. We
[20:00] don't we don't know if the rapture is
[20:02] going to uh I don't know if the rapture
[20:04] is going to be before they sacrifice
[20:05] animals, before they build the temple,
[20:06] or after. We don't know,
[20:09] right? We don't know for sure. But we do
[20:11] know that God accepted them in Ezra 3:6.
[20:14] Even when they didn't have a temple,
[20:16] they were still sacrificing animals.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; Okay? Now, I remember who it was. There
[20:21] was a woman in the message who told me
[20:23] they can't sacrifice animals without the
[20:24] temple. She's wrong according to this
[20:26] verse. She's a sweet woman. She's
[20:29] visited this church before. But I'd have
[20:31] to disagree.
[20:33] She's not from this state. Okay. All
[20:35] right. Now, number four.
[20:39] Now, I believe shortly after this, once
[20:40] they get their animal sacrifices going
[20:42] again in the temple, then Jesus will
[20:44] reveal himself and he'll seal the
[20:46] 144,000 Jews.
[20:48] Now, the reason I place this theory, I
[20:50] used to think it was later. The reason I
[20:52] place it there is because uh if the mark
[20:55] of the beast is laid down before that,
[20:57] then the Jews would have to take the
[20:58] mark of the beast because you either
[21:00] take it or you die. So, that's why I
[21:03] believe the 144,000 got to be sealed
[21:06] before the mark is laid down.
[21:08] Okay.
[21:10] Uh number five, then the trumpets 1
[21:12] through six sound and the first woe.
[21:15] That's what I believe. Because once once
[21:17] they're sealed, once the Jews are
[21:19] sealed, then God, remember as we'll
[21:21] read, then God can pour out the vials.
[21:24] I'm sorry, the I'm sorry, the trumpets.
[21:25] I'm sorry, the trumpets. I'm sorry.
[21:27] Let's read that. Let's go to Revelation
[21:28] 7. You got your Bible? Revelation 7 1,
[21:30] two, and three.
[21:32] Revelation 7 1, two, and three.
[21:36] And after these things, I saw four what?
[21:38] Angels
[21:40] standing on the four corners of the
[21:41] earth, holding the four winds of the
[21:43] earth, that the wind should not blow on
[21:45] the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any
[21:47] trees. Think about that. God places
[21:49] angels uh at the corners of the earth in
[21:52] order to keep the winds of strife and
[21:55] winds of war from blowing on the earth.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; Angels are holding back the judgments of
[22:00] God. How gracious God is to this earth.
[22:03] Hallelujah.
[22:05] Verse two, and I saw another angel
[22:06] ascending from the east having the seal
[22:08] of the living God. So here, is this a
[22:09] seraraphim or is this a sealing angel? I
[22:11] don't know, but it's so wonderful. God
[22:14] sends angels with a portion of the Holy
[22:17] Ghost for the Jews to get born again.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; He sends angels. Hallelujah. And he
[22:23] cried with a loud voice to the four
[22:24] angels to whom it was given to hurt the
[22:26] earth and the sea, saying, "Hurt not the
[22:29] earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till
[22:30] we have sealed the servants of our God
[22:32] in their foreheads." So, these are
[22:34] hurting angels. These four angels placed
[22:36] around the earth, they're hurting,
[22:38] pardon me, they're hurting angels or
[22:40] destroying angels.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; And they can't hurt the earth until the
[22:46] Jews have the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, that's why I placed it
[22:50] right there. They have to be born again.
[22:53] Then, once they're born again, I believe
[22:55] God will protect them. Remember, because
[22:57] the Bible said, remember the Bible said
[22:58] Revelation 12, that's right. She goes
[23:00] out in the wilderness and she's hidden
[23:01] from the beast, right, for three and a
[23:03] half years. Amen. Hallelujah. So there
[23:05] it is. I I just caught that. Now I
[23:07] hadn't caught that before.
[23:09] Okay, now you got that. Now, uh, now
[23:11] here's what I believe. Once those
[23:13] trumpets sound, I believe that's the
[23:15] sudden destruction after the peace and
[23:17] safety cry from 1 Thessalonians 5:3.
[23:20] There's the sudden destruction, right?
[23:23] Because it looks like, well, there's
[23:24] there's no rain. all the uh their ant
[23:26] the Jews have the temple but all of a
[23:28] sudden sudden destruction that first
[23:29] trumpet is blown and the destruction
[23:32] starts coming
[23:34] okay that's what I believe now I could
[23:35] be wrong again I'm just reviewing this
[23:37] to you uh I'm sorry for you and for me
[23:41] now that would be the first three and a
[23:43] half years the major events not all
[23:45] events but the major ones that I know of
[23:47] the second half of the 70th week uh
[23:49] would be the seven vials and Armageddon
[23:52] and of course you have a couple more uh
[23:54] you have the seventh trumpet as well.
[23:56] The seventh trumpet is the very last
[23:57] thing right out here. We'll see. So now
[24:00] for the second half of the week, the
[24:02] first event is the death and rapture of
[24:04] Moses and Elijah or two men with their
[24:06] spirits, which also is the second woe.
[24:09] That earthquake in Jerusalem is the
[24:11] second woe.
[24:13] Okay?
[24:15] Uh and then the pope will break the
[24:17] covenant with Israel, right? Breaks the
[24:19] covenant after three and a half years.
[24:22] And then the abomination of desolation
[24:24] is set up 30 days later. So 30 days
[24:27] after the pope breaks the covenant, he's
[24:29] going to go into the Jewish synagogue
[24:31] and sit in the temple of God claiming
[24:33] that he is God. I wonder if he'll even
[24:35] sit on the mercy seat. I wonder, right?
[24:37] Because he's sitting on some throne.
[24:39] What's the throne of God? The mercy
[24:40] seat.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; So I don't know if he'll literally sit
[24:43] on there or not, but the Bible said
[24:45] he'll sit in the temple of God claiming
[24:46] that he is God. He exalt himself above
[24:49] anything that's called God or worshiped.
[24:52] So, he's going to be like uh God uh
[24:54] Satan on earth, but he's going to try to
[24:55] be God on earth, but he's really Satan
[24:57] on earth.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, uh number nine, the mark then
[25:00] the mark of the beast is laid down. So,
[25:02] that's the way I believe it works out.
[25:03] Now, I could be wrong, but once he's
[25:05] seen that temple, then I believe he can
[25:07] lay his mark down
[25:08] &gt;&gt; and start trying to kill everybody that
[25:11] disagrees with him.
[25:13] Okay? And then the vows one through five
[25:15] will be poured out.
[25:17] And then the six vows poured out. It
[25:19] dries up Euphrates. So the kings of the
[25:22] earth can come to Jerusalem.
[25:24] And I and someone shared, it might have
[25:25] been Austin or Chris, someone shared
[25:27] that, maybe it was Lydia, somebody
[25:28] shared an article that the Euphrates is
[25:30] already drying up. The water level is
[25:33] seriously going down already. It's a
[25:35] prefigure getting ready for the
[25:36] tribulation.
[25:38] But here in the tribulation, it
[25:40] completely dries out. And and again,
[25:43] remember uh uh the prophets are going to
[25:46] have the power to make it rain, not for
[25:48] three and a half years. So I don't know
[25:50] how much that will affect the river
[25:52] Euphrates.
[25:54] Now the 12th event would be the great
[25:55] horse judged by the seventh vial by
[25:58] Russia. Brother Ram says, "Thus say the
[26:00] Lord, Russia will drop atomic bomb on
[26:02] the Vatican and destroy it." And the
[26:05] Bible said her destruction comes in one
[26:06] hour, right? So we know it couldn't be
[26:08] oldfashioned horses and chariots and all
[26:10] these things. It's got to happen in one
[26:12] hour, right? One hour.
[26:15] Now this is what I believe. I believe
[26:17] Los Angeles sinks by this mighty
[26:19] earthquake during that time as well
[26:22] because there's a there's a mighty
[26:23] earthquake when the seventh vial hits
[26:26] and I believe that's the mighty
[26:27] earthquake that will break off uh
[26:30] California off the the the continental
[26:32] USA. Now I could be wrong but that's
[26:34] just my thought. I'm just trying to
[26:36] place all these pieces together. All
[26:38] right.
[26:39] And then, oh yeah, and the same time,
[26:41] this same time, the USA would be bombed
[26:43] as part of the se brother man's seventh
[26:45] major vision according to Revelation
[26:46] 16:20 and Revelation 18:8.
[26:50] And I'm not going to go over those
[26:51] tonight, but I just want to review this
[26:52] because it ties in with the angels.
[26:54] We're going to hit the highlights of
[26:55] what the angels do.
[26:58] And then finally, this 13th event would
[27:00] be the battle of Armageddon. All nations
[27:02] to battle at Jerusalem. The kings of the
[27:04] north, which are probably Russia, south,
[27:07] uh probably Egypt. East would be China.
[27:10] They're all defeated by Jesus. Okay? And
[27:13] got the scriptures on there. If you want
[27:14] a copy of this, let me know if you want
[27:16] to study it. I hope somebody studied
[27:17] something from Sunday by God's grace.
[27:19] Hallelujah. Amen. Hope somebody was
[27:21] studying something I preached or maybe
[27:22] something else the Lord put on your
[27:24] heart. Now, the 14th event would be
[27:27] fervent heat that burns heaven and
[27:29] earth, preparing ashes of the wicked for
[27:32] the believers to walk on into the
[27:34] millennium. Hallelujah.
[27:37] 15th. Then this Yeah. The seventh
[27:38] trumpet is that final one. The kingdoms
[27:41] of the world become the kingdoms of our
[27:42] God. Revelation 11:15-19.
[27:46] And then the last thing would be the
[27:48] millennium. Brother Ram says, "Do
[27:50] whatever you can. Don't miss the
[27:51] millennium." Hallelujah. He said, "We're
[27:53] just getting an idea of all these
[27:55] blessings that exist for us in the
[27:57] millennium." Hallelujah.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I'm gonna leave that up there
[28:02] and uh let's get your Bibles ready. If
[28:03] you got your Bibles, go to Revelation.
[28:05] Uh we're going to just hit some
[28:06] highlights here. I got about 15 minutes.
[28:08] Good. Plenty of time. I just want to hit
[28:10] some highlights on angels
[28:13] in the book of Revelation. So now I got
[28:15] to use this other device. So I'm going
[28:16] to scroll down here.
[28:21] Now the first angel we see is the angel
[28:23] in Revelation 1 verse one.
[28:26] I remember that one.
[28:34] Thank you for your patience here.
[28:37] There we go. All right. Now, find it.
[28:39] Now, in Revelation 1 vers1, Jesus sends
[28:42] an angel to John for the revelation of
[28:44] Jesus Christ. Now, isn't that something,
[28:46] church? God sends him an angel, but then
[28:49] Jesus will appear himself time and time
[28:51] again to John throughout the vision.
[28:54] Hallelujah. So, this shows even God
[28:56] sends uh you know more than just
[28:58] himself. God will send an angel to a
[29:00] prophet as well. So, we see an angel was
[29:02] sent to John and then Jesus makes
[29:04] special appearances. as he appears to
[29:06] John numerous times throughout this
[29:08] vision. Hallelujah. Now, in Revelation
[29:11] 1:20, we see seven angels, which we know
[29:13] are seven men. In Revelation 3:5, this
[29:16] is a beautiful verse. Let me read this
[29:18] one. Revelation 3:5.
[29:21] Hallelujah.
[29:22] I like this verse. Here's one I'm going
[29:24] to read. This is the Sardis church age.
[29:26] But look at the promise. He that
[29:27] overcomemeth, the same shall be clothed
[29:29] in white raignment. And I will not blot
[29:31] out his name out of the book of life.
[29:34] But I will confess his name before my
[29:36] father and before his angels. My church,
[29:40] if you can overcome,
[29:43] God will confess your name. Hallelujah.
[29:46] G I'm sorry. Jesus will confess your
[29:47] name before God and the angels.
[29:50] Hallelujah. In other words, all the
[29:52] angels witness say, "Brother Chris,
[29:54] brother Malachi, all the brothers, all
[29:56] the sisters, this was a true overcomer."
[29:59] Praise God. Amen. How we ought to
[30:01] overcome. Hallelujah. If we overcome
[30:04] now, then the father and the angels in
[30:06] Jesus will all be witnesses that we
[30:08] overcome. Church, don't you know angels
[30:10] are watching us here tonight?
[30:11] Hallelujah.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; The angels kept track, brother Claude
[30:14] and Patrick, that you two came to church
[30:16] even though it was a school night. God
[30:18] bless you, brothers. The angels keeping
[30:20] track. Hallelujah. Right? The Bible said
[30:23] we are we are a spectacle. Remember
[30:25] Romans, we're a spectacle unto men and
[30:28] angels and demons.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; In other words, we are on a stage,
[30:33] brother Chris, it's like we're on a
[30:34] stage living out our lives and demons
[30:36] and angels are watching our every move.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if we overcome on this
[30:42] stage, Amen. If we can be the
[30:44] overcomers, then the angel will stand
[30:46] there and agree. Yes, brother Chris
[30:48] overcame. Yes, Sister Acacia. Yes,
[30:50] Sister uh Zur overcame. Yes, Sister
[30:53] Christian. And and yes, Sister
[30:55] Beatatrice overcame. The angels will nod
[30:58] and say, "They overcame. I was a
[31:00] witness."
[31:02] Amen. Praise God. So, help us to be
[31:04] faithful. God, strengthen us. Send your
[31:06] angels to help us not to give up, not to
[31:09] be discouraged, because the angels will
[31:10] strengthen us and then they'll stand
[31:12] there and witness. Yes. Yes, they did
[31:14] overcome.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; I love that verse. Amen. The holy angels
[31:19] stand there and say, "Yes, he overcame.
[31:21] Yes, she overcame." And remember,
[31:24] church, there's rejoicing in the
[31:25] presence of angels when one sinner
[31:27] repents. Yeah, brother Chris,
[31:30] uh, Revelation 3 verse 5, brother, I
[31:33] love that verse. I was scrolling through
[31:34] there. I'm like, "That's right. Jesus
[31:36] will confess, sister nature overcame."
[31:38] And all the angels will say, "Amen.
[31:42] Hallelujah." They'll all agree.
[31:44] Hallelujah.
[31:46] They all Yes. They overcame Leodysia. I
[31:48] saw it. I was there. I protected them. I
[31:50] strengthened them at times. Hallelujah.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they were the heirs of
[31:54] salvation. Hallelujah.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; That was God's bride. That was God's
[31:58] child. Hallelujah.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; And the angels protected them.
[32:01] Hallelujah. Now, I'm just going to go
[32:03] kind of quick through here because I got
[32:04] about uh 10 minutes.
[32:07] Now, the next angels are Revelation 5:2.
[32:10] A strong angel proclaims who is worthy
[32:14] to take the book and open the seals.
[32:16] Hallelujah. So, some strong angel. Now,
[32:19] what does that mean, church? There's
[32:20] weaker angels and there's stronger
[32:22] angels.
[32:24] Remember remember that angel that
[32:25] wrestled uh with the prince of Persia?
[32:27] He took him 21 days and he still didn't
[32:29] win the wrestling match. So, he needed
[32:31] what? A stronger angel. Michael.
[32:34] Some angels are stronger than others.
[32:36] And church, let me say it like this.
[32:37] Some Christians are stronger than other
[32:38] Christians.
[32:40] But they're still Christians.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Brother Ram said, "The
[32:45] weakest Christian uh has so much
[32:48] strength if he just gets on his knees
[32:50] and prays." In other words, the weakest
[32:52] Christian is their strongest when
[32:53] they're on their knees praying to God.
[32:55] Hallelujah.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:58] Hallelujah. And brother said, "Don't
[33:00] never say you're weak as a Christian."
[33:02] Brother Bam said,
[33:04] &gt;&gt; because the devils will hear that and
[33:05] they'll say, "Oh, uh, Brother Jesse said
[33:07] he's weak." Well, I'm going to come. I'm
[33:08] going to bring this temptation. I know
[33:10] he fell. I'm going to make a real uh
[33:12] tempting temptation for him this time
[33:13] because he said he's weak. Church,
[33:14] always say, "I'm strong. I'm strong. I'm
[33:16] strong.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; I've got the word of God. I'm an
[33:19] overcomer." Amen. Angels are around me.
[33:21] Jesus is for me. If Jesus for me, who
[33:24] could be against me?
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Now, in
[33:28] Revelation 5 11 and 12, this is a
[33:31] beautiful verse. John hears the voice of
[33:33] many angels.
[33:36] It's actually a hundred million angels
[33:38] and then thousands of thousands
[33:42] saying loudly, "Worthy is the lamb that
[33:45] was slain." Now, church, he must have
[33:47] had brand new eard drums.
[33:50] Right? He heard over a hundred million
[33:54] angels say worthy. I'm going to read
[33:56] that. 5 11 and 12.
[33:59] over 100 million angels.
[34:04] I'm in the wrong chapter. It's 511. I'm
[34:07] in 611. And I beheld and I heard the
[34:10] voice of many angels round about the
[34:12] throne and the beasts and the elders and
[34:13] the number of them was 10,000 times
[34:15] 10,000. That's 100 million. And said and
[34:18] thousands of thousands. In other words,
[34:21] just the idea you can't number them more
[34:23] than 100 million. Church, we're on the
[34:26] winning team. Let me remind you,
[34:28] &gt;&gt; sometimes you focus the devil. so awful.
[34:29] He is. The demons are so awful. But
[34:32] there's more with us than with that is
[34:34] with them. Hallelujah.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; We win by the grace of God. We win.
[34:38] We've got more power. We've got more
[34:40] angels. We've got God himself. We got
[34:42] Jesus. And we got the blood of Jesus
[34:44] Christ. Hallelujah.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; We've got watchers. We got seraraphims.
[34:48] We got cherubams. Hallelujah. We have
[34:50] all these angels. We have guardian
[34:51] angels. Amen. We have all these angels
[34:53] to help us. We've got ceiling angels.
[34:56] Amen. We have so much help. We are. We
[34:58] can't miss it. We're gonna make it.
[35:00] Hallelujah.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; All these angels are with us.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; And then they all shout this verse 12
[35:08] with a loud voice. 100. What would the
[35:10] song of a 100 million angels sound like?
[35:13] Worthy is the lamb that was slain to
[35:16] receive power and riches and wisdom and
[35:18] strength and honor and glory and
[35:20] blessing. In other words, we haven't
[35:22] bragged on Jesus enough. We need to brag
[35:25] more on Jesus. Amen. If a hundred
[35:28] million angels are bragging on his power
[35:30] and glory, what should we do? Praise
[35:32] God.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; And we sometimes, church, sometimes we
[35:35] act like God is so weak in our lives.
[35:36] It's the opposite. We're the weak ones.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Because these 100 million angels are
[35:41] shouting, "He's powerful. He's strong.
[35:43] He's worthy. He's honorable. He's great.
[35:46] He's mighty. Let's join their shout
[35:48] tonight." Hallelujah.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of all of our praise.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. 100 million. My goodness gracious.
[35:56] Hallelujah. And church, what is it going
[35:58] to be when we get there? Amen. What are
[36:00] you gonna say when you see those hundred
[36:02] million angels for the first time?
[36:05] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna say, "Oh, I love you, Jesus."
[36:08] I already know what I'm going to say,
[36:09] brother Patrick. Hallelujah. I love you,
[36:11] Jesus. Now, next one. The next angels
[36:15] are in Revelation 7 1 and 2. We already
[36:16] read those. Um, but let's go to
[36:19] Revelation 7:11.
[36:22] Now, I got a video on this. I listened
[36:24] to it on the drive home.
[36:27] This great multitude is either the bride
[36:30] or foolish virgin. Six times, brother
[36:33] Brandham says it's the bride. One time
[36:35] he says the foolish virgin. Now the
[36:37] reason most people think it's foolish
[36:39] virgin is because he said that during
[36:40] the time of the seven seals, but as I
[36:42] showed you, not every word in the seals
[36:43] is thus sayith the Lord. The revelations
[36:45] are thus sayith the Lord, but not every
[36:47] word in the sermons is thus sayith the
[36:49] Lord. So for me and and I I I watched
[36:53] the video. I think I had six or seven
[36:55] pieces of evidence that this is the
[36:56] bride of Jesus Christ. Okay, now I could
[36:59] be wrong, but look, let's read verse
[37:00] nine. And after this, I beheld, lo, a
[37:02] great multitude which no man could
[37:03] number of all nations. So, it's got to
[37:05] be Gentiles. And kindreds and people and
[37:07] tongues stood before the throne and
[37:08] before the lamb clothed with white robes
[37:10] and palms in their hands. So, right
[37:12] white robes shows it must be the bride.
[37:15] Is that right?
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Verse 10. and cried with a loud voice,
[37:21] saying, "Salvation to our God, which
[37:24] siteth upon the throne, and unto the
[37:26] Lamb." And all the angels stood round
[37:30] about the throne, and about the elders,
[37:32] and the four beasts, and fell before the
[37:34] throne on their faces, and worshiped
[37:36] God. And what do they say? Blessing or
[37:39] Amen. Blessing and glory, and wisdom,
[37:41] and thanksgiving and honor and power and
[37:43] might be unto our God forever and ever.
[37:45] Amen. Sounds like the repeat the same
[37:46] song of the angels all the time, right?
[37:48] God's worthy. He's powerful. He's might.
[37:50] All strength belongs to God. Give God
[37:52] all the praise. God is faithful. God
[37:54] deserve your worship. Hallelujah.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:01] God deserves our worship, church.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; And you can worship him right now by
[38:05] getting your minds on the Lord right now
[38:07] &gt;&gt; and the angels because the angels are
[38:09] here.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Don't get distracted. We're almost done.
[38:11] Don't get distracted.
[38:13] The angels are here. Hallelujah. and
[38:14] they can help us out tonight by God's
[38:16] grace
[38:17] &gt;&gt; if you're in need of it. Hallelujah. And
[38:19] who isn't? Hallelujah.
[38:23] Now, uh I'll try to get going here.
[38:26] Revelation 8. Now, this is the chapter
[38:28] where the trumpets start sounding. In
[38:30] Revelation 8, seven angels are given
[38:32] seven trumpets and they prepare to
[38:33] sound. In Revelation 8 3 and 5, another
[38:37] angel with a golden sensor offers
[38:40] prayers of the saints on the golden
[38:41] altar and then casts these prayers down
[38:44] to the earth and there's thunderings and
[38:45] lightnings and all these. In other
[38:47] words, the judgments of God are being
[38:48] poured out by these angels. So, here we
[38:51] have destroying angels or judgment
[38:53] angels. We'd say it could be a ninth
[38:55] type of angel.
[38:57] Okay.
[38:59] Now, Revelation 8 7, the first trumpet
[39:02] sounds by an angel. Hallelujah.
[39:06] In Revelation 8:8, the second trumpet
[39:08] sounded by an angel. In Revelation 8:10,
[39:11] the third angel sounds a trumpet. In
[39:13] Revelation uh 8:12, the fourth angel
[39:16] sounds his trumpet. So, right now, I've
[39:17] covered these trumpets right here during
[39:19] the first part. So, so angels are
[39:22] directly connected to earth. Fifth
[39:24] angel, fifth angel sounds his trumpet.
[39:27] In Revelation 9 11-12, Satan is the
[39:30] angel king. He's called the king of
[39:32] angels. Did you know that he was the
[39:35] anointed cherub that coverth? He's
[39:37] called the king of angels. Let's read
[39:38] Revelation 9 11 and 12 so you can see
[39:40] it. Revelation 9 11 and 12. And they had
[39:44] a king over them. Satan's a king. Yes.
[39:46] Of demons, but not of you and I. Jesus
[39:49] is our king.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Which is the angel of the bottomless pit
[39:53] whose name in the Hebrew tongue is
[39:55] Abadon.
[39:56] But it is the but in the Greek tongue
[39:58] hath his name Apaleon. One woes pass and
[40:02] behold there come two woes more
[40:04] hereafter. So maybe that doesn't
[40:06] surprise anybody. Maybe it does. But
[40:07] Satan is an angel, a king angel
[40:11] over the fallen angels. But Jesus is the
[40:14] holy angel. He's the mighty angel.
[40:16] Hallelujah. And he's king over all the
[40:18] good angels. Hallelujah.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:22] Oh, it's beautiful.
[40:25] Now, Revelation
[40:27] uh 9:16, 200 million demons are loosed
[40:30] under that sixth trumpet. 200 million
[40:34] demons are loosed, right? And that's to
[40:37] torment the unbelievers. Uh that was
[40:40] what during the sixth trumpet. Yeah,
[40:41] sixth trumpet. So during this time,
[40:43] trumpets 1 through six are during that
[40:45] first half time. Now, for closing sake,
[40:48] I'm going to go ahead and close. Um
[40:51] let's go to Revelation 21. I'm going to
[40:52] close with this because I'm down to my
[40:53] last few minutes. Go to Revelation 21.
[40:55] Who knows Revelation 21? What comes down
[40:57] from heaven?
[41:00] New Jerusalem. Yes, sir. The holy city,
[41:02] New Jerusalem.
[41:06] Beautiful chapter. Revelation 21:22.
[41:08] Very similar, but 21 is where the city
[41:10] comes down like a bride adorned for its
[41:13] husband. Hallelujah.
[41:18] Revelation 21. Now, I'm going to skip
[41:19] ahead a little bit, but um let's go to
[41:22] verse 9. Revelation 21:9. And there came
[41:24] unto me one of the seven angels, which
[41:26] had the seven vows full of the seven
[41:28] last plagues, and talked with me,
[41:29] saying, "Come hither, I will show thee
[41:31] the bride, the lamb's wife. And he
[41:34] carried me away in the spirit to a great
[41:35] and high mountain, and showed me that
[41:37] great city, the holy Jerusalem,
[41:39] descending out of heaven from God,
[41:43] having the glory of God. and her light
[41:46] was like unto a stone most precious,
[41:49] even like a jasper stone, clear as
[41:52] crystal.
[41:55] Here's what I want you to see here.
[41:58] Verse 12, and had a wall great and high,
[42:01] and had 12 gates, and at the gates were
[42:04] what? 12 angels,
[42:08] and names written thereon, which are the
[42:10] names of the 12 tribes of the children
[42:12] of Israel. and it goes through those
[42:13] names and there's uh three gates on each
[42:17] side of the holy city.
[42:20] But I want you to see this here uh by
[42:21] God's grace. Now go down to verse 21.
[42:24] And the 12 gates were 12 pearls. Each
[42:27] several gate was one pearl. And the
[42:30] street of the city was pure gold as it
[42:32] were transparent glass. So think of
[42:36] glass windows. That's what the go that's
[42:37] what the gold is like there. It's like
[42:39] transparent glass, but it's gold.
[42:42] See-through gold.
[42:44] Hallelujah. Amen.
[42:47] 23. And the city had no need of the sun,
[42:49] neither of the moon to shine in it. Now,
[42:52] that doesn't mean there wasn't them
[42:53] anymore. They just didn't need it
[42:54] anymore. For the glory of God did light
[42:56] in it, and the lamb is the light
[42:58] thereof. Ain't that wonderful, church?
[43:00] In that place, you won't need light
[43:02] bulbs. You won't need candles. Jesus is
[43:05] your light.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You won't need electricity.
[43:09] Jesus is your light. Hallelujah. Amen.
[43:13] And the nations of them that which are
[43:15] saved shall walk in the light of it, and
[43:17] the kings of the earth who bring their
[43:19] glory and honor into it, and the gates
[43:21] of it shall not be shut at all by day,
[43:23] for there shall be no night there. So
[43:25] the gates are always open. God's
[43:28] pyramid, God's home is always open. Yes,
[43:30] brother Chris.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; It's possible. Yes, that's possible.
[43:36] Yep. Very good, brother. Very good. Give
[43:38] him two claps. That's good, brother.
[43:39] Hallelujah. Yep. Very good. Just like
[43:40] the Bible said there's no uh the Bible
[43:42] said uh we don't need the moon and the
[43:44] sun, but it'll still probably be there.
[43:47] Okay.
[43:49] Verse uh 26. And they shall bring the
[43:51] glory and honor of the nations into it.
[43:54] And there shall be no wise enter into
[43:56] anything that defileth, neither
[43:57] whatsoever workketh abominations. See no
[43:59] homosexual there, right? No
[44:02] crossdressing there,
[44:04] no pride there, right? Pride. look as
[44:06] abomination to the Lord,
[44:08] &gt;&gt; right? No beastiality there, no
[44:10] adulteries there. None of that will be
[44:11] there. Thank God. It'll be a clean city,
[44:14] a Christlike city. Hallelujah. That's
[44:15] the city I want to live in. Praise God.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Or maketh a lie. There'll be no
[44:20] lies in that city. But they which are
[44:22] written in the Lamb's book of life.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Now go back up to verse 12. Here's my
[44:27] closing thought again,
[44:30] church. At every gate, there's three
[44:32] gates on each side. Every gate is in a
[44:34] pearl shape. Why? Because Jesus is the
[44:37] pearl of great price. You have to sell
[44:40] out everything you desire in life,
[44:41] children. You got to sell any little
[44:43] pearl you have in order to gain the one
[44:46] great pearl.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; I'll sell out everything. Popularity,
[44:49] friends, money, my future desires. I'll
[44:51] sell all that out just so I can have the
[44:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; That is the one pearl of great price.
[44:58] And brother Patrick and brother Claude,
[45:00] every time you walk in the gate, there's
[45:01] going to be an angel standing there.
[45:04] Did you catch it?
[45:06] &gt;&gt; The angels guard the throne of God
[45:09] again.
[45:11] Amen. Hallelujah. 12 angels, three on
[45:14] each side. Because now this holy city is
[45:17] the throne of God. So what has to guard
[45:19] the throne of God? God has to have
[45:21] angels.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; And he's got 12 angels because the
[45:25] throne of God has come down from heaven.
[45:28] Now heaven and earth is united. And
[45:30] wherever God's throne is, he's gonna
[45:32] have guards there.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; And so God places angels, each one at
[45:37] the gate. And remember, you they'll
[45:40] probably greet us and say, "Well done,
[45:41] overcomer, brother Jesse. Well done.
[45:43] Enter into the city." I'll say,
[45:44] "Hallelujah." Amen. That's where I want
[45:46] to be. That's if I go out. I'm hoping I
[45:49] was I hope I live in the city. I trust
[45:51] I'm the bride of Jesus Christ. Don't you
[45:53] trust the same for your life, too?
[45:54] &gt;&gt; I trust I'm that same one. But if I got
[45:57] to leave and come back in, they'll greet
[45:58] me and say, "Yes, he's an overcomer.
[46:00] Enter into the joys of the Lord prepared
[46:03] for you from the foundation of the
[46:05] world." Hallelujah.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; And again, we'll have guards guarding
[46:10] the throne of Jesus Christ just like
[46:12] they do today. Just like an angel is
[46:15] guarding over your life right now.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. God bless you.
[46:19] Musicians can come. Aren't you glad you
[46:22] have an angel guarding your heart
[46:23] tonight?
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. in church. Was that a good review
[46:26] on the end time events?
[46:28] &gt;&gt; It was for me. I forget. I like I told
[46:30] you, I forget more than I remember.
[46:31] Hallelujah. I preach so long. I just
[46:33] forget so much.
[46:36] In Revelation 22, Jesus says three times
[46:40] he sent his angel to John to confirm the
[46:44] testimony that he's giving to John.
[46:47] Hallelujah. So this this record this
[46:50] this record of the book of Revelation,
[46:52] it is a sure record. An angel made sure
[46:56] it was perfectly written down so we
[46:58] would know the truth. Hallelujah. Amen.
[47:01] An angel said that he will stand there
[47:04] confess or he'll stand there as Jesus
[47:05] confesses overcomer. Overcomer
[47:08] overcomer. Overcomer. Overcomer. And the
[47:11] angels will say yes Lord. Yes Lord. Yes
[47:14] Lord. How many want to be an overcomer
[47:16] tonight?
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Let's bow our hearts
[47:19] for a word of prayer.
[47:23] Sing that little song there. I need
[47:25] thee. Oh, I need thee. Every hour I need
[47:27] thee. I need thee.
[47:30] Church, if you want to be an overcomer,
[47:32] the angels of God are here to help you
[47:33] out. Hallelujah.
[47:36] [Music]
[47:38] That verse was the one that touched my
[47:40] heart the most. That if I overcome,
[47:42] Jesus will tell the angels. Angels,
[47:44] look, here's brother Jesse. He's an
[47:46] overcomer. Father, he's an overcomer.
[47:51] He overcame all the temptations that
[47:53] were presented to him through these
[47:55] fallen demons.
[47:58] Yet he overcame,
[48:02] friends. And then the Lord Jesus will
[48:03] look at us and say, "Well done, my good
[48:05] and faithful servant."
[48:07] You've been faithful with a little. Now
[48:10] I'm going to make you ruler over much.
[48:13] Hallelujah. Oh, church, let's be
[48:15] faithful, can we? Hallelujah. Let's be
[48:18] zealous to be more faithful with what
[48:22] God has given to us.
[48:27] How many would raise your hands and say,
[48:28] "Brother Jesse, let's pray for me that
[48:30] I'll be faithful, that I'll be an
[48:31] overcomer." God bless those hands. I'm
[48:34] not even looking. May God
[48:36] hear your request tonight. You pray for
[48:38] somebody else, I'll pray for everybody
[48:40] as well. You pray for me. Pray for all
[48:42] the saints.
[48:44] Father God, we thank you for tonight,
[48:46] Lord. Thank you for these promises,
[48:47] Lord.
[48:49] A 100 million more angels saying worthy,
[48:54] holy, strength, honor to Jesus Christ.
[48:58] Hallelujah. Oh God, and our eard drums
[49:01] don't even burst, Lord. Because we have
[49:03] new bodies,
[49:05] theophony bodies.
[49:09] Oh Lord, how we want to join the angels
[49:10] tonight. Say, Jesus, you're worthy.
[49:12] You're holy. All glory, all wisdom, all
[49:15] might, all strength, all dominion to God
[49:18] almighty. Jesus, be glorified in this
[49:20] humble little church. Lord, you saw the
[49:22] hands. Lord, I pray you'd make us all
[49:23] overcomers. Bless all the saints. Worked
[49:26] all day. Some of them babysat. Some of
[49:28] them worked. Some of them did school all
[49:30] day. Lord, yet they came out to the
[49:33] house of God. Strengthen them tonight by
[49:35] the holy angels. I pray if they need a
[49:39] touch, may they reach out and touch the
[49:40] Lord.
[49:42] Lord, as you pass by, you maybe pass by
[49:45] in your angel form, dear God.
[49:47] Hallelujah.
[49:49] Lord, they want to be overcomers.
[49:52] They want to hear their name confessed
[49:54] before the angels that protected them
[49:57] and before Father God. Oh Lord, our
[50:01] great faithful father.
[50:04] Lord, we want our names confessed before
[50:06] you, oh father, because you gave us
[50:08] life. You sent us in the Leoian church
[50:10] age. You sent us to Akran. Of all places
[50:12] we could have went, all the places we
[50:14] could have been born, Akran, Ohio, USA.
[50:19] Lord, we didn't ask to be here. You sent
[50:21] us here, Lord God, for this time and
[50:23] purpose. Give us grace and strength
[50:25] tonight. Strengthen each and every
[50:26] individual whose hand was up. Lord God,
[50:28] see their need tonight. May the angel of
[50:30] God just give them that touch. Maybe
[50:32] they'll cry. Maybe they'll raise their
[50:33] hands. Maybe they'll shout. Maybe
[50:34] they'll scream. Maybe they'll fall down
[50:36] on their knees and worship, Lord God.
[50:39] Maybe they'll sing with tears in their
[50:40] eyes, say, "Oh God, thank you for
[50:42] strengthening me tonight. I need to
[50:44] overcome.
[50:46] I'll do it by the blood of the lamb,
[50:48] Jesus Christ, and the word of my
[50:51] testimony."
[50:55] Let me say it like this, Lord, so the
[50:57] people can see another connection. Lord,
[51:00] guard the throne of our hearts tonight.
[51:03] Let your angels take their place to
[51:05] guard our hearts if if temptation comes,
[51:08] if trial comes, whatever it may be. I
[51:11] pray, Lord, guard us here tonight, Lord.
[51:13] Protect us by the grace of God. I ask
[51:16] it. You see our hearts, God. We want to
[51:19] be pure before you. We love you, Lord
[51:21] God. We worship you tonight. We want to
[51:24] sing that same song with a 100 million
[51:26] angels, oh God. Hallelujah.
[51:29] worthy.
[51:31] We need you, Lord, every hour. So bless
[51:34] your people here tonight, we pray as we
[51:35] sing and worship in Jesus Christ's name.
[51:39] And the saints said,
[51:41] "Let's sing this little song here.
[51:45] [Music]
