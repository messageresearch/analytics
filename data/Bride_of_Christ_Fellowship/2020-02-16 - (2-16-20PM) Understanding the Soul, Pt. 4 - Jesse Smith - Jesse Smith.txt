look at understanding the soul part for like to get back into this little study here the Lord would help us to do that let's go - let me get a scripture here we can start with it we look at a few thoughts what is the soil a little bit further on that and some terminology for the Holy Ghost baptism and then we'll look at Old Testament examples of people being filled with the spirit yes let's go to Psalms 42 verse 2 Psalms 42 verse 2 thank you appreciate dedication thanks for taking the speed down Genevieve there I'll be still napping in the van okay okay let me set a 1/2 hour timer and then we'll see how far we get in half an hour because we want to be mindful here for my wife so let's look at understanding the soul part for Psalms 42 verse 2 let's read out lets me just read that together we can all read that on three one two three my soul thirsts for God for the Living God when shall I come and appear before God that's how weird a prayer for him you know in your heart let's make an order to the Lord here having a father we love you Lord God we ask you to bless our service here teach us through your word Lord and this father Lord as I've felt I've really grown in this area this soul help us to be able to relate it through the scripture and bless your people father as we wait upon you and look to your word in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god bless you didn't see the praise God [Music] okay so Lord willing tonight let's take a few minutes here and let's look at what is the soul and I can't quite remember what we went over here so I guess I'll just go as much go as far here as I can and then I'll probably ask you for a little feedback here I know we looked a little bit at the soul I wanted to find it though real quick I don't really have any slides so sorry about that don't have any slides so I look into the scripture here the soul define is your nature your will or your desire and it's the will of the human spirit so each one of us is a spear being but the nature of that or the will of that human spirit is the soul it's closely connected of course to the human spirit but it's separate from it it is like the inside core of the human spirit we'd say now from birth all the way to the time a person makes either a decision for Christ or we'd say goes past the line of mercy and judgment everyone has a thirst for God it's a holy thirst for God as we just saw David said my soul thirsts for God the Living God and God designed this on purpose because God wants to have fellowship with you well praise the lord god bless you brother thank you good to see you sir we just prayed for James and you buddy praise the Lord so God designed this because he wants to have fellowship with you now he looked at it on Wednesday a little bit or I'm sorry - Wednesday's ago you and I live in the human spirit we're kind of like in the middle zone right we have the flesh on this side and we got we got the flesh call out feed me I'm thirsty feed me but we're in here in the human spirit in the mind but then we got the soul cried out feed me I need time with the Lord right I need God's anointing I need I need I need more of God I want to talk with the Lord and so what we're here in the mind and we gotta learn to meet new the needs of both thirst but God designed you that way he designed us so we would have a thirst for him and it's a great sin to hush that holy thirst - it's the it's awful sin it's the sin of turning down God we call it the reprobate mind like Romans 1 talks about the Bible said they knew the knowledge of God but they failed to give glory to God right in Romans chapter 1 let's just read that here since we're there Romans 1 let me pull it up I know it's at the end of the chapter and that's this course is the beautiful chapter I mentioned it I feel like I mentioned it more than ever because it says without excuse in fact a holiness woman called me on Monday and I talked to her about an hour and a half and she was just blown away by our doctrine she's like that makes sense about the three works of grace and she never heard that before and I talked about this scripture here how all men are without excuse in Romans chapter one and she had she had a hard time believing anybody could be lost but I tried to show her by the scripture that God doesn't want anybody with anybody to be lost but Jesus said few there be that find it so it's a great it's a great thing God wants people to be saved but few people actually want to be saved you a few people actually listen to that soul thirst brother man said they hush it by giving it you know like music or sexual relationships or sports or or money or lands or houses or you know things like that they try to hush that holy thirst by searching for other things but Romans 1 it's 18 to 21 for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness so see they know the truth they just don't do it have you ever watched those Ray Comfort videos he'll be he'll be taking people through like the the Ten Commandments it'll say like do you have any idea what God did for sinners that they might be saved and would you imagine how many would you imagine what you think most people would know or to think few people would know it's kind of that's kind of a half way I'm surprised a lot of people know they think Oh God they know God sent his son like it seems like half the people know and not even going to church it's like it's just they know they've been around they hear churches you know they watch the tea they watch the TV they listen the Internet they know there's something inside of people to this holy thirst that they want to know what what good God do for sinners to save them so see the Bible says they have the truth but they hold it in unrighteousness they don't treat it the right way verse 19 because that which may be known of God is manifest in them for God has showed it unto them so God shows himself in each person's body they have to admit Wow I must have US I must have a creator because my heart beats autonomously my mind thinks I must have a creator it's inside of me God showed his power inside of my body verse 24 the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and Godhead so that they are without excuse that's right so see there they are there they are without excuse now let me yeah where it is verse 28 now if you would go to verse 28 and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient do believe there was a scripture in there that said they were haters of God yeah verse 30 backbiters and haters of God keep a genetic God shows them his power in creation God shows them his power in their human body and yet they don't want to keep God's knowledge so they end up hating God oh it's an awful thing Church isn't an awful thing to think of at the very one that created the very one who wants to fellowship with them they turn him down oh man my it's heartbreaking mercy so God gives them over if they don't want to fellowship God said fine he said you couldn't have a reprobate mind I'll let you I'll give you I'll give you the lie you want to believe others there's no such thing as God it's all evolution and they'll be damned by it the Bible says how sad see the soul has the natural holy thirst for God just like the body has the natural thirst for water if the body's denied water have the souls denied the eternal spirit it it it dies it'll be separated from God eventually praise the Lord now I want you to note this that brother man talks about this he said everything every person longs to worship something right so in every person in every culture no matter how primitive or wealthy or poor urban or rural mankind loves to worship men have to worship something right they have to worship something but the Bible says those that realize there's a creator God will accept so let's go to acts 10:34 X 1034 proves this he's uh he's a respecter I'm sorry he's not a respecter of any person then Peter opened his mouth and said Oh of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons glory but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him does that make you feel good sister Wendy like even in Hong Kong God does not respect Americans more than Hong Kong right bang Laos God and for me mine was Mexico or Spain each one of us we can trace back our lineage God does not respect one nation above any other he is just as real and Laos as he is here in America just as real in Africa and Asia and any land he's not a respecter of persons he shows himself real in each person and he makes himself known through nature the things that we can see that's right but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him that's why I tried to tell that woman I said I said there's going to be surprised on the day of judgment they're going to be surprised they're gonna say when did I do you any good they're not even gonna know that they did Jesus good but it's because they feared God and they knew if someone's hurting if someone's sick if someone doesn't have clothes I know I just want to help them there's something about me something wholly about me that I feel like I need to help them out and Jesus says when you've done it to them you've done it to me praise God amen now in the soul is free more agency this is your autonomous choice it's up to you it's a gift from God life on Earth is a gift but salvation unto eternal life is even greater gift right and it's yours to gain or lose jesus said in mark 8:36 for what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul see God does not force any soul to follow him or repent from their sins but he graciously offers mercy and warnings to all I want you to see this is beautiful if you could sister Wendy Pope James 5:20 this is just beautiful beautiful here I love how the Bible just states things it just kind of gives us a clearer picture in James 5:20 soul directs your way so think about where you've walked can you just may be back let's just rewind 10 years 2010 the 2010 where were you brother back I I just moved to Doyle's down in 2010 that's why that's why I said that cuz I knew where I was just because that day stands out for me that year rather he's probably running a marathon something for the children came along but your way since just just 10 years your way has been directed by your soul because the Bible says your soul directs your way look at this let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sin so our way the way we've chose in the last 10 years we'll say 20 for me at the end of 2001 so basically 2002 so the last 18 years my way has been directed by my soul and that's why brother Ram says you know people that wondered I have the Holy Ghost he says look what you were and look what you are now what is he saying look at the way you walked right look at the steps you've walked in what path are you following are you following a wise path or a foolish path or a sinful path we all want to be able to say we're walking in a wise path amen redeeming the time because the days are evil praise God now with three more agency each person either accepts faith for the soul or unbelief they have the choice if faith has chosen god directs them to heaven it's faith is direct directed unbelief is their default state and Satan then directs Satan and his demons direct them to hell remember the Bible said in Timothy Paul said their sinners are taken snare by the devil at his own will right so when they submit to Satan's will they get caught up in Satan's will that's the kind of a fresh thought there I hadn't really thought about that lately because ezekiel 18:4 says the soul that sinneth it shall die so to reject faith is to make the ultimate final sin because it determines your eternal destiny sinning is missing the mark in the hebrew it's wandering from the way in other words so the soul that wanders from the way or sins or misses the mark it shall die that's what the Word of God teaches therefore it's your soul that chooses every action the soul does either good which is faith or evil unbelief okay sister Wendy keep hope romans 2 9 and 10 romans 2 9 and 10 now I just had a little thought here I want to look up that scripture where the Bible said the eyes run to and fro you see if I can find that I thought I put it in this study where the Bible said he would search for Souls okay I can't find it he must not be in this one I'm sorry okay so let's go back here I want to find that though because the Bible said God is searching I thought I put that in the study maybe it's in another chapter anyways Romans 2:9 tribulation and anguish anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil so see it's the soul that does the evil it's the nature right it's the nature in the soul why did I do that why did I do that see that doeth evil the soul does the evil that nature of the Jew first and also the Gentile but glory honor and peace to every man that worketh good to the Jew first and also to the Gentile here's a clear example brother Branham gives he said a man that's not born again if he sees a immorally dress women if he doesn't have the born-again experience in the soul he said it'll start making plans on how to contact her to get her phone number right that's because he's gonna do something about it she has this lust he has this evil thought and he said brother I said if he's not born again he'll start making plans about doing something about it okay so that's that's what the Scriptures saying every soul of man that doeth evil of the Jew first and also the Gentile but glory honor and peace to every man that worketh good to the Jew first and then to then to the Gentile okay so I just wanted to prove that by the the scripture that it's the soul that ultimately directs that now look it up right now the eyes of the Lord run to and fro I do believe that that is a scripture cuz it just came to my mind here I want to see if I can find that yeah they're just you okay Zecharia for 10 if you could please pull that up sister Wendy Zechariah for 10 who had this spies the day of small things they can read this a few weeks ago didn't we looked at the Bible study of Ezra Nehemiah who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zoomable with those 7 they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth amen so here brother man talks about this in the church age book talks about the eyes the Lord he talks about seers or prophets so one way this can represent prophets and how God sends prophets throughout the whole world there's another one let me see if I can pull this one up here real quick I just kind of come into my mind I didn't have this one God searches the earth here for a believer oh yeah there to say yeah there it is earnest glory second chronicles 16:9 thank the Lord here sorry I thought I had these in there I do apologize I really thought I had these in my notes but I don't must be a different study yes yes there it is right here glory now this is so encouraging so whether you live in Laos where they live in Mexico or Spain wherever you live God's I like the song says God's eyes on the sparrow praise God but here the Bible said the Lord searches them out for the eyes Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong where in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him memory is not a respecter person's anyone's heart in any country whether China right whether Germany Russian and we think all these communist countries have no believers no they do they do God is looking he's searching the earth for someone whose heart is right someone whose soul who's hungry for God and he'll show himself to them hey man here now it's done foolishly therefore from henceforth thou shalt have Wars you write that down 2nd chronicles 16:9 I can't believe I don't have that in here then Zechariah 4:10 so I want to make that point Church this is this is a blessing this is such a wonderful promise of God God loves every soul he tries to save every soul and he sends his eyes he sends preachers out and then he sends his holy spirit out anyone who's hungry anyone has a good heart God will show himself to them amen what a consolation praise God hallelujah how God loves the Soul he loves the sinner soul praise God thank you Jesus hallelujah see every soul worship someone or something the souls of faith rejecters choose to disbelieve God but their souls still worship Satan according to their own wills and if you could sister pull up Colossians 2:23 look at this here this is beautiful this proves the will of God is in the soul yeah that's right right here let's go real slow on this which things have indeed a shoe of wisdom in right here it is will worship right there it is well I was really blessed somebody preach that reason I was like that's right or maybe I was listening online or Facebook or something like that some preacher and they used will worship and I thought there it is well it's from the Wills the soul and humility and neglecting of the body not in honor in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh now church have you read from verse 16 up when I could do it right now they're talking about worshipping angels Paul said there was people worshipping angels and he said that's will worship you wanted to do it it's worship anyone that's worshipping Devils or angels they're doing it from their own Souls their will is wrong instead of worshipping God they're worse than than the Creator they're worshiping the creation snow were so different than worshipping a stone Idol right or a wood Idol whether you worship an angel or demon whatever it is because it's will worship so or it's either will worship or you could say worshipping and self will this is the default mode of soul worship for anyone who rejects God's requirements for true worship right because true worship is done in what spirit and truth but if you turn down the spirit worship and the true worship of the God of heaven who's going around all the earth searching for somebody whose heart is right amen then the only thing left is will worship ah because he'll let you worship according to your will if you want to my God is so merciful to save a wretch like me praise God thank you Jesus John 4:24 God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth Cain is the first human will worship example in the Bible in Genesis 4 1 2 7 did you know this brother Ram said Kane should have been happy when God sent fire on Abel's sacrifice do you know her have said that oh man I have to find the quote but I know he said it because I saved it I got it somewhere brother Ram said case you know went back and said praise the Lord Abel God vindicated your sacrifice now we know how to worship God but instead of getting happy that his brother got the Holy Ghost and he did it he got jealous and God even said if you worship like your brother you'll lead you'll be the pastor of the church cuz just say like that or you you'll be the head of the family whatever you want to say you'll be the leader but Cain chose will worship he's I'm in a worship or I'm gonna worship with my vegetables and my fruits it's my will I want to give that and so he got angry he got very wroth the Bible said against God eventually murdering Abel and then Abel's blood cried from the ground I thought about that Jia recently New York was in New York they found a bunch of the I hate to say this but they found I have a bunch of leftovers from the abortion clinics married in church now think about that then they were put there in a spot they're not supposed to be think about the voice of the blood calling from the ground brother BAM said and the Bible said they go up to heaven remember all the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah the Bible said the Christ came up before God and he just found some more this week how awful was that my goodness those souls crying out for revenge right that's like the faithful Jews Lord avenge our blood God will thank goodness because the will worship the evil of will worship said of accepting God's worship true worship my goodness Jesus says God's one way to salvation is him I am the way the truth and the life but remember the that we must correct people from the error of their way the air of their way and remember up if you could since both Isaiah 35 8 this way is so simple of fool will not air they're in the way of holiness and a highway shall there be in a way that should be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it should be for those the wayfaring men though fools should not err therein see even fools unto me this is like speaking of foolish virgin look they they can't even arenít even though they're fools they can still find because remember their their version to the word right their version they have a form of holiness which is genuine holiness they just didn't go all the way see there be a highway there be a way I am the way the truth and the life the word is the way praise God Amen now I got a couple most at 30 minutes so let me find let's close with this examples here I just kind of felt led to go over this I don't think I've ever gone over this I want to go over just some Old Testament examples let's read John 7 though first John 7 39 real quick let's read this since we're on the soul I want to look at how the soul of the Old Testament Saints could not be born again I just want to give some clear examples this was really fresh to me when I wrote on it a couple maybe a couple of weeks or months ago now here Jesus Troy preached on this one and I actually I was even riding on that in my book a couple weeks before he preached this I wrote I wrote almost exactly what he preached on a couple weeks before he preached it was it was really inspired but this spake he of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified okay so that means the baptism the Holy Ghost could not be given until Jesus died raised ascended to heaven the father accepted the sacrifice and then Jesus gets a glorified body and he comes down and he and then you know then he sent then he goes away and then he sends the Holy Ghost of the day of Pentecost their souls could not be born again now I want to look at some clear examples here so everybody can see this grace of the Lord sorry that's me I just got some static here tonight so let's look at some of the examples here there's quite a few and then let me set a timer here yeah I may just mention some of these here so I'll try to go 45 minutes so more willing I try to go finish in 15 minutes maybe less now here's how I do in the book I do a I show how man has three parts body spirit and soul and then I do a uh what do they call it I forget what I called it there I can't remember anyways I just show how the Holy Ghost can't be in the body I've sought the seal the Holy Ghost rather the seal can't be in the mind so it's got to be in the soul okay process of elimination that's the word I'm looking for that's the phrase I'm looking for the process of elimination it can't be in the body because Paul said in my flesh dwelleth inge well then the seal of God can't be in your in your body and then the Bible says renew your mind daily it must be transformed daily so the seal of God can't be in the mind right but then the Bible says you're sealed to the day of redemption so that lasts from the time you're sealed till the time you get a new body well that can't be the mind because the mind needs renewed every day it has there's all in one place left process of elimination it's got to be the soul if people can't see that well they're just not trying to see it it should be so plain right now let's go through some examples and I think this will be a blessing to you and I'm gonna go right in order I think yeah I think I go in order in the book maybe you've heard these before maybe you forgot but this is encouraging to see did you know the Bible said Joseph was it looked like Joseph was filled with the Holy Spirit in the Bible Genesis 41 38 pharaoh said can we find such a one as this a man in whom the Spirit of God is he was such a godly man Joseph so it looks like Joseph was filled with the Holy Spirit now we could say his mind was anointed with the Holy Spirit many many times almost all the time because he kept it kept renewing his mind Exodus 28 3 says there were wise hearted Jews were filled with the spirit of wisdom in order to make Aaron's priestly garments filled with the spirit of wisdom see a lot of people will say Oh see I've heard different preachers I would say some very well-respected preachers and I respect in denominations or non denominations they say the Holy Ghost is the same in the Old Testament as a new what we know different than that Jesus just said that but these are the scriptures they point to it and they have a very Ballack like to them it's very valid right it looks like they are filled right never I see that word filled you know it just says they're filled so the the common preacher thinks okay well then they have to have the same Holy Spirit but you have to read more of the New Testament to understand this and that's why it's called a mystery to the bachelors only ghost is called a mystery in Colossians chapter 1 we'll close with that one a little bit it's called a mystery a lot of people miss that baaz allele was filled with the Spirit of God according to Exodus 31 to Exodus 31 - he was filled with the Spirit of God in all manner of workmanship let's try the verse 3 yeah there it is and I filled him with the Spirit of God can't you imagine bezu leo he said God says I'm filled with the Spirit of God well yeah God says you got to do animal sacrifices you got to get under the law now you got obey the law and he just get the skirt you know as they had to in the law the law can never bring perfection right the law can never give him the baptism holy ghost yeah he could say well God said I'm filled with holy spirit I am in my mind my human spirit is filled with wisdom understanding knowledge all manner of workmanship see so when we start looking at these it's easy to see how people could be confused it took a prophet to finish the mystery of God so we understand all this amen now look even though the Bible says he was filled with God's Spirit Hebrews 10:4 could you pull that sister Hebrews 10:4 says it's impossible for the blood of bulls and goats which he was living under to take away his sins amen look at that church it's impossible yet he's filled with the Spirit of God only here not here why can you imagine that he would say I'm anointed with God's with God's Spirit but yet brother man when he would go to sacrifice the Bible said this and sister Wendy I'm sure you noticed bang-ups you know - the Bible said when they would leave the sacrifice their hearts remain unchanged yeah you could say I'm filled with God's Spirit my my mind is just on fire for things of God but yet when he left the sacrifice Bible said he a still had a conscience for sin he knew that blood could never take away his sins that's why God had to send a perfect lamb right to take away the sin and the guilt amen hallelujah to send it away praise God what's it for all not just for the next year like the day of atonement not just for the next year but for all time all years amen thank the Lord Alleluia Jesus numbers 14 24 Caleb I love this Caleb that Gentile dog hallelujah had another spirit with him which caused him to follow God fully in the days of Joshua so while the rest of the country failed right they couldn't take all the promised land Caleb was one of those he went all the way he possessed all of God's promises amen most them did it but Caleb was he was filled with God's Spirit in his human spirit he had another spirit praise God look at numbers 27 18 27 18 Joshua had God's Spirit for the Lord told Moses take the Joshua the son of nun a man in whom this is the spirit and lay vine hand upon him praise God remember Joshua and Caleb had a different spirit Moses said that they had different spirits than everybody else hallelujah Micah let's pull this up Micah 3:8 this is beautiful Micah the prophet Micah knew Micah knew he had the Holy Ghost in his mind look at this but truly I am a third I'm full of the power by the Spirit of the Lord and yet Jesus stands there and said the Holy Ghost not yet given to LOM glorified look at that see it's a mystery any member tells like with water baptism anytime there's a contradiction it's a mystery behind that amen I'm full of the power I'm full of judgment I might like he said not by might not by power but by my spirit there's the spirit of might is the holy spirit to declare to Jacob his transgression and Israel has sinned let me tell you church I mean look at this it takes you to be anointed with the Holy Spirit to tell somebody their sins how many believe that sometimes I have trouble brother bank telling people their sins other times I don't you know why because I got to be anointed with the spirit cuz you know you and I know we could we don't want to be judgmental and prideful pointing out somebody else's sins what about ours but see when the Holy Spirit's on us what what's happened this will happen we've already confessed our sin and then we can be an honest vessel to bring correction to somebody else that's beautiful right there Church see he had to have the power of the Holy Spirit to tell somebody you're in sin you're wrong you shouldn't be doing that like that middle school girl I think I shared last week what a sweet girl she was in my class when she was in first grade but she walks up ssin she's she's almost as tall as me and she's like jumping like that she said mr. Smith mr. Smith I said yeah honey how you doing she said mr. Smith is homosexuality is sin and I just got done preaching to those children and the power this beard and I looked at her I could tell she wanted me to say yeah it's okay but I looked at her I said Sophia no homosexuality is a sin it's so wrong God condemns it all through the Bible said have your parents email me if you have any questions about it and I just it's like she melted it's like she wilted like a flower at nighttime and it broke my heart but I was so annoyed too brother bang I wasn't gonna compromise see because it takes the Holy Spirit to declare to tell them that it's wrong that's beautiful right there that's beautiful that's Micah 3:8 now you yeah yeah you remember numbers 11 we don't to go there sister but numbers 11 25 to 29 God put a portion of his spirit that was already on Moses on the 70 elders and it caused him to prophesy without ceasing I got five minutes here so let me finish up here in the rest of this chapter I look at three Old Testament Saints who proven that the spirits anointing was only temporary Samson saw and David most of these were real very familiar with all right why don't when I skip down here they got five minutes yeah since I got five minutes let's go to John the Baptist okay and let's go to Zacharias and Elizabeth his parents huh me know that they were actually living under the Old Testament I know that although their names are in the New Testament the New Testament didn't start until Jesus said those three words what were they it is finished once he said those words Malachi that was the end of the Old Testament the veil was torn and now they can get into the holiest of Holies praise God amen see although the New Testament starts with Matthew 1:1 it actually doesn't start until Jesus Christ says it is finished remember Jesus even said John was the he was great right he was one of the greatest among men but he's least in the kingdom because he's actually not a part of the kingdom of God because the kingdom of God started in the New Testament it is finished and now the blood of Jesus Christ is shed for our sins Luke 1 let's close with Luke 1 and then we'll look at uh yeah Luke 1:15 yeah thank you sister for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb Church I don't mean to be critical and I'm not being critical but I've heard wonderful highly esteemed message believer preachers evangelist use this to show that John got the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul I've heard him say that now it's impossible and I just say that with all due respect I've put my hands like I'm praying you know I just say that with all due respect I just disagree there's no way he could have had the baptism Holy Ghost because Jesus wasn't glorified yet the sins weren't even paid for by the blood of Christ yet what it means is that his mind was already anointed with the Holy Spirit even a child's mind right even a child's mind right the Bible any Bible oh you could say it could be his body as flesh was anointed to because he starts kicking you know in the womb Luke 141 verse 41 yeah the babe leaps here yeah the Bible said the babe leaped in her womb so the Holy Ghost got so much on him that he leaped and he started praising Lord I that makes me feel good Oh a little raise god I like that and Elizabeth was fair with the Holy Ghost but not the soul see you be surprised and that preacher even said see it's in the New Testament you know well exactly by words in the New Testament by the words and the chapter but not according to the actual shedding of blood because there is no Testament until the the death of the testator right that's hebrews chapter 10 you don't even have a testament until the testator has died then the Testament starts that's why Jesus said I give up the ghost no man takes it from me I give it up it's finished and he gave up his spirit under the father praise God and then Luke 167 says Zacharias and his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied that's what people do today thank God I appreciate it you know somebody's have God people like I was raised with and thank God they prophesy because their spirit gets so anointed right but it's not to the soul in this case it can't be to the soul because Christ had not paid for the sins of the world all of our sins were not yet put upon him like Isaiah 53 was gonna say he was not yet glorified so this is the baptism in the human spirit this is a mind that's like bezel eels it's full of the wisdom of God it's full of the prophecy of God but the soul is still not sealed all right let's say into our feet I better stop right there there's a whole lot more I got there I hope that was a good start like I said I'm so excited about this book I was telling brother John Graham John grandma I talk once a month on Friday nights you know we kind of keep up on each other I said I said but one thing I can see I'm growing myself and I'm growing in patience because I'm very patient with this book I'm not gonna rush it the other one I rushed out I really did and when our family and I read it we found 16 mistakes like typos and things like that that man and you'd be surprised numerous preachers read that and nobody caught all those mistakes it I had four or five preachers read that nobody got it even the editor I guess we were all in a big hurry you know but I know it's helped a lot of people and now all those mistakes are fixed in the next versions of if anybody orders one I can order one for you they're all fixed now but see that's one thing I've learned just be patient do your best work God will be with you if God's in it he'll finish the work that he started but this is gonna be I believe is gonna be so important for so many people that they can see if they'll just humble themselves and read God's Word that's written in the book to understand these things because it's a mystery Colossians chapter one I'll just read that real briefly some of you could probably finish it hopefully my heart.i leaves Colossians 125 this is what I was mentioning earlier this morning how people say there's the brother the precious pastor said there's no church age but that's not true there is a church age boy sure has take me a long time to find this okay here we go verse 25 wherefore I made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the Word of God a church I told you this morning I believe it's Scripture there's only one dispensation that's the Gentile dispensation that's there's only four times the word dispensation is used in the Bible it's all by Paul did you know what dispensation means by the way I'll get to this next week maybe ain't stewardship did you know that it doesn't even mean time period it means stewardship Paul was given a dispensation of the gospel a stewardship Paul is to be overseer of which part of the gospel to the who Gentiles Gentiles that doesn't mean a period of time that means a stewardship I didn't know that so this week that's why it's good to dig in the word now people will use this position in other ways but the Acts to a Greek word is this a stewardship and it's the same word where Jesus says give an account of your stewardship in that parable it's it's a it's an overseeing it's a managing and overseeing Paul was given a overseeing of God for the Gentiles which is given to me for you to fulfill the Word of God verse 26 even the Mitch mystery wretch which hath been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his Saints can you imagine that bezel II oh my he could have built Heat brother bang he built the ark and he overlaid it with gold and then brother bang he saw the fire fall but you know what sister Wendy after offering the sacrifice and guess what he still felt like I don't feel forgiven can you imagine that he saw God he saw God fill the temple so not even Moses and Aaron couldn't sacrifice right after he they couldn't even enter in the holy place at one point I think was after the dedication of the of the tabernacle and yet later when the blood would be shed he would go to church and feel like last don't feel like I feel like I'm really forgiven because it was impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sin but it's impossible for the blood of Christ not to take away sins they ahead to those who believe praise God to those who accept the pardoning blood of Jesus Christ he has to take away sin praise God because he paid for them hallelujah thank you Lord and there's the way a beautiful word right there Agis oh there he can't there's no ages in the Bible I'll come on man you're too late for that too late and then there's other scriptures there's numerous ones and Asian's two ages and from generations I'll see you ages longer right a generation is shorter it's like my generation might and then Malachi is the next generation right now Lydia next generation James and Lily the next generation we have our generation but age is longer and ages longer time period but now is made manifest to his Saints verse 27 to whom god would make know what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory not goodness whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man at all wisdom that we may present every man perfect to Christ so the Jews would leave after every service same I know that was great I felt anointing I don't feel forgiven and the Bible said it was a teacher it was to teach them a schoolmaster to point them to Christ and now we because they turned down Christ we get to go to church and we can actually feel forgiven hey man thank you Lord because it's possible for the blood of Christ to take away our sins let's just close with that let's bow our heads here how many are thankful for the possibility of Christ taking away all sin I'm something I'm more thankful for that than anything I know and then new you Jesus Lord we covered a lot of ground to know our soul we see how Jesus you are the will be filled with the Holy Spirit in our souls and our it was but now it's the Bible [Music] [Music]
