========================================

will need for animal blood right something to fish that and jesus announced it on calvary it is finished amen three words hallelujah fulfilled all these animal sacrifices all these seemingly unending sacrifices the blood of jesus christ finish it once and for all so church you can know for sure your sins are finished as well praise god amen therefore let the devil tell you they're not they are finished you've confessed them they're underneath the blood of the cross of calvary glory now look at verse 18 here we did the loaves in verse 17 leviticus 23 18 if you have your bibles you shall offer with the bread seven lambs remember that the bread was an offering you being waived you are waived your life church is an offering to the lord hallelujah that's why whenever god allows you just say praise the lord or you might be baptized you have trouble no i confess all my sins i'm not backside my life is an offering unto the lord hallelujah see seven lambs without blemish in the first year and one young bullock and two rams they shall be for a burnt offering unto the lord with their meat offering and their drink offerings even an offering made by fire of sweet savor unto the lord then shall you sacrifice one kid of the goats for sin offering and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings and the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the lord with the two lambs and they shall be holy to the lord for the priest praise god so along with these loaves of bread you had numerous animal sacrifices and uh just as i preached back in the winter time in the philippians series i showed the five there's five sacrifices in the old testament right notice all five are present burnt meat drink sin and peace offering all are present on the day of pentecost in other words all offerings were to be already represented see the burnt offering represents total devotion to god because christians give them to god's work praise god remember remember paul told timothy give yourself holy unto your preaching gift not partially god god doesn't want a partial sacrifice god don't want a partial offer give god all you have see offer a burnt offering this is the time to do it it's the feast of weeks praise god this is the time to give all of yourself praise god to the baptism of the holy ghost amen and then meat and drink offerings symbolize bread and wine do they not they symbolize the communion the constant communion that we have praise god in other words we are to keep these sacrifices until the lord comes show his death until he comes it's a sacrifice and i think we'll have communion this sunday because victoria's been asking me right so i want if i announce it then i got to do it and then i can't forget if i announce it let's have the lord's supper this sunday night by the gods grace and i'll try to watch my time just remember somebody remind me on sunday i try to watch my time in the morning so don't wear everybody out but we want to have the the lord's supper you know when someone gets baptized new we want to get them a chance to have the lord supper praise god so see now that's three offerings the fourth the sin offering represents our constant need for jesus's forgiveness of sins through his heavenly role as high priest mediator right according to hebrews hebrews teaches that that jesus is our high priest he ever lives to make intercession unto god for us aren't you glad he's there today for you when you need help he's there praise god he doesn't take a break he doesn't take time off you don't take a two-week vacation he don't take any time off he's always there he lives with eternal life to make intercession to help out you when you need it so that's what the sin offering represents you church you and i always have a sin offering amen we always have a blood that lays at the altar of god for us to forgive our sins to pardon our iniquity he knows how to take away our sin so he always during this feast of weeks he always has a sin offering there praise god remember the sin offering really took place there uh at the passover right but here it's shown again we still have a sin offering there's still an offering god will accept our offerings amen and god has an offering for us as well praise god amen now i noticed this uh i just want to share this thought you know lydia and i i think my wife and i were talking how uh you know there's a there was a teacher that taught you know husbands are prophet priests and kings and uh one of the authors uh said that you know that you know husband's one of those they're they're either a prophet priest or king well that's wrong we're all three we're a pr we're prophets because we prophesy through the holy spirit right we prophesied of your dad's healing you did i did i prophesied of it right i was speaking it before it happened see so we as that's why i want to share that with lydia i don't think a chance to talk about it but just came to my heart the bible already says we are kings and priests unto god if you're born again you already are both a king or queen and a priest praise god you have dominion like we saw last week went into that you have dominion over sin that proves you are a king that proves you're of royalty of heaven praise god because you rule over your former sins former addictions and your former life you rule over that as a king and a queen with authority and your authority is the name of jesus and then you're a priest your prayers make intercession praise god your god uses you to pray for people and god hears their prayers like we pray for johnny god healed him remember naomi and beatrice prayed for my wife with zion and god heard it god answered it the very next day and all was well praise god see because each one of us are interceding unto god your prayers mean so much praise god and we gotta battle discouragement when it seemed like god answered we gotta overcome that and say i'm a priest anyway i know i've offered it unto god and god's going to take care of it praise god because i'm a priest my my sacrifice and my service wasn't in vain there's nothing that's done in vain in the lord praise god and then as a prophet as we said your life prophesies your words prophesy of victories to come hallelujah they prophesy of blessings to come and victories that we're going to see and people that are going to be saved praise god and all these things that we're speaking by by faith or by hope it's prophetic praise god it's prophetic that god is going to do something god is going to do it so church we're all three prophet priests and king just like christ amen he's all three now the last one was peace offering now remember peace offering another word for that is a thank offering so it's not like we think peace but it actually means a thank offering in the hebrew if you actually look at it in other words we have we must give voluntary expressions of thanksgiving and we give it through our praises hebrews 13 15 says by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name church we already offered some peace offerings tonight praise god thank you jesus for the blood of light amen see we've already see we we sometimes we just forget how often we're giving sacrifices our whole life is a sacrifice praise god every time we read our bible or pray for somebody or try to witness or sing a song or put on the worship it's a sacrifice pleasing unto god amen because that's our life our life is priestly work our life is prophetic work our our life is royal authority work praise god we're doing god's will by his word amen so see all these sacrifices were present at the feast of weeks and so we see them present today praise god in our lives now go to deuteronomy 16 verse 10. here's a little more uh revelation about the feast of weeks god gives it to moses i'm sorry moses rather repeats it right before he goes off the scene in deuteronomy remember deuteronomy means second law and so moses was rehearsing the law a second time before he died that's what deuteronomy is it's a it's a repeat right before he dies and remember he charges joshua all those good words only be strong only be courageous god is with you praise god any any he instructs them to be overcomers now look at verse 10 10 11 12 and thou shalt keep the feast of weeks under the lord thy god with a tribute of a free will offering of thine hand which thou shalt give unto the lord thy god according as the lord thy god has blessed him we looked at that see god just in this species of weeks god just wants you to give it from your heart we're not legalists praise god we're not denominational people right we are we are uh christians with hearts that love to worship god it's not a grievous thing it's not a hard thing to praise god right it's an easy thing it's a glorious thing to praise god hallelujah yeah we'll battle minds and we'll battle for a little bit but overall our lives it's an e it's a joy to serve god it's a blessing and we freely choose to do that we surrender or give our free will to god's will see it's a free will so god wants in other words god wants spontaneous worship in this time like i said at your home put on the song in your car god wants spontaneous praising of the lord hallelujah just worshiping he said just give me a free will offering bring me whatever you want based upon how much i blessed you see this is this is all for the gentiles right the jews and gentiles the one church this is a revelation for us bring it from a free will heart a voluntary heart oh my verse 11 and now look here what's the attitude during this feast of weeks and thou shalt rejoice before the lord thy god thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manservant thy maidservant levi that is within thy gate and the stranger and the fathers and the widow and that are among you in the place which the lord thy god hath chosen to place his name there and thou shalt remember that thou was a bond man in egypt and thou shalt observe and do these statutes now church god jesus said blessed are those who mourn for they shall be comforted but the bible also says there's a time to mourn and then there's a time to rejoice now we look at churches and we want to look at our church too if we're mourning too much something's wrong with us because this is a feast of rejoicing praise god amen see when we pray up when we come to the house of god when we sing from our hearts it ought to change us out of mourning into rejoicing praise god because this is the feast of rejoicing remember god's good man good to your sons god's been good to your daughters god's been good to the stranger he's been good to the mother the father the children god's been so good let's rejoice let's give him a blessing and honor based upon what he's blessed us with praise god this is a harvest time this is a harvest of wheat time praise god this is a time to rejoice look what god has blessed us with it is our joy to give voluntary free will offerings unto the lord hallelujah that's how i was telling mj after service we were talking out there i said brother i've served god long enough i beserve god in the message now let's see it was 2001 so almost 20 years now almost 20 years so i've been serving god now 22 years and i said the longer i go it becomes more of a joy it becomes more automatic can i say like that it becomes more routine it just becomes more of a joy because he's you know he's young and he's struggling with praying at home and you know i'm sure he wouldn't mind you know he's he's a real wonderful brother he's real open real open but i said that's my testimony that it's not a hard thing to study the word it's not a hard thing to sing praises unto god it's not a hard thing to come to church it's a joy to worship god it's an honor to praise the lord because i see what god's brought me from he brought me out of egypt and can i say like this he's kept me from going back praise god he's taken me out of egypt he took me out of the miry clay and he gave me a place in his promised land amen hallelujah praise god thank god for his mercy and his grace there's a beautiful song we were listening to uh where i'm standing now you guys remember that song i love that song we have to see that sometime look where i'm standing now out of the out of out of the wilderness into the promised land look where i'm standing now all by god's mighty hand i mean look where i let's take a moment church let's look where we are we're not back here we're not in the cold civil years you know we're not over here we are in the time of harvest we're in this long wonderful time of rejoicing we're gathering wheat now i know we're gleaning but every now and then we get a little wheat over here we god has just been got to saved so many souls through the church ages it's been a wonderful harvest and here we are at the end thank god for the gleaning that we can do in this hour it's a joy it's almost done it's almost time to go the next season praise god it's almost time for the mayor to suffer the lamb we ought to rejoice in what god's done amen we're right at the end praise god we're gleaning the mind we can we can almost see the seasons turning praise god oh my god we can see the uh the israel you know how israel is almost ready to receive two prophets right they're almost ready in the persecution stage and people still gathering back together we can see they're being they're gonna be called together they're gonna be called together right for a feast of trumpets the trumpets are going to soon sound and call them all together to receive jesus christ but we receive him right now don't forget that we've received christ right now amen hallelujah now look church rejoicing so this is exactly fulfilled on the day of pentecost the bible said they look like they were drunk and full of new wine and then god said rejoice under this worship rejoice in this feast and the bible said they they declared the wonderful works of god look what the lord has done god has done so many wonderful works he brought his son to die for our sins his son raised from the dead he forgave us he justified us and now he's filling us with power look what the lord has done amen they were just so rejoicing in what god has done and we should rejoice in what god has put in our hearts amen hallelujah because the kingdom of god romans 14 17 is not in meat and drink but righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost that's the kingdom of god the real kingdom of god is righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost in fact i'm right you know i took a little break but i was writing on my next book was on family i got about one i mean one chapter and i just had to take a stop to finish up this other one but that's how i kind of frame it you know i frame it with that scripture your home you want your home to be like a kingdom where in it dwells righteousness peace and joy if you can establish your home with those three things the kingdom of god is going to be there right if you can make right make sure everything's done righteously right if you can keep peace amongst each other and if you can have joy then you have the kingdom of god in your home that's how i'm forming it there because the kingdom of god must be within you and if it's within you it goes to your home and it's not in the meat and the drink so much it's in the righteousness peace and joy of the holy ghost so if you need like you know people like list right people like checklists so here's a checklist for your house just make sure you got righteousness peace and joy you're good you got you got the holy ghost flown through there praise god right joy the lord and right everybody's living righteously before the lord everybody's honest sincere all the sins repented of taken care of and you've got peace with god and peace with each other now now i want to um i want to just take a moment here my uh my my understanding of the day of pentecost has changed okay i used to think that the 120 were all speaking galilean so i've i've i've changed my thought on that because let's go to acts 2 4. i've changed my thought i still believe they were of course galilean but i actually believe they were now speaking in other languages so there was a coptic language you know there was a greek language there's all these 17 different languages i actually believe now that they actually were speaking in unknown tongues to them you know they're unknown to them but all the hears we're hearing them because of acts 2 4 and so i have to be uh honest and say i was wrong for all those years that because of acts 2 verse 4 because it says other languages now there are quotes on both sides just so you know so i'm not you know i'm not making this a big deal i'm not going to major on a minor to me this is a minor but it does free some people who have act uh who have spoken in unknown tongues when they got the holy ghost right because before i thought well they were just speaking galilean and so maybe they would have heard it and they would have been a little confused so i've i've just changed it because of what acts 2 4 and then isaiah 28 says so acts 2 4 and they were all filled with the holy ghost that began to speak with other languages or other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and then there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now this was noise abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that they heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and marveled saying one another behold are not all these which speak galileans it's actually for example like peter i believe peter was probably praising god but it was coming out as greek because there were there were greek people there right and before i thought it was he was just saying galilean i just feel like i was wrong okay now let's go to isaiah 28. i feel like i'm learning here you know my wife helped me with that one and another guy on youtube said you know brother jesse i appreciate you but you got to check this out and i was like okay so i had two witnesses on it i went and studied it i'm like yeah you know that that does make more sense than that look at verse 11 28 11 for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people okay so so on the day of pentecost peter was he was filled with the holy ghost and then he started shouting they must have been shouting because it got noised abroad right and people just walking by here's a greek man he walks by and he hears people shouting and screaming in greek jesus christ is risen from the dead the holy ghost is here the power of god's here and he's like what and then he and then he just stands around for a little bit they go share it around i just heard greek up there these guys are hebrews i mean what is that upper room going on up there and then pretty soon they gather around and those guys by the way so they jumped out of windows they ran down the stairs into the streets praising god amen and then they said these are drunk men and peter stands up somehow and this might have been the miracle peter might have been preaching in galilean here this was the galilean peter was preaching in galilean and they all heard it in their languages so that's the best way i could understand it now i'm still willing to grow and understanding if i got it wrong but that's what it seems like because isaiah 28 11 stammering lips and another tongue another language will i speak to this people now look at this to whom he said this is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest this is the refreshing yet they would not hear okay so the refreshing came on the day of pentecost the rest for your soul came on the day of pentecost aren't you glad you can rest you're not warring you're not trying to earn salvation you're not trying to fight to be saved you already are saved your soul is resting that jesus finishes jesus lives inside of you he put his spirit in you so you would rest in your salvation you would rest in your place with god that god has peace with you as well hallelujah and now all the works we do are by appreciation i don't do works to be saved i'm already saved i'm already filled with the holy ghost there's a totally different spirit inside of me than before it was a worldly spirit a sinful lustful selfish spirit inside of me before but now i've got the spirit of christ amen i meant it all i can do is think about him all the time all i can do is meditate about and even when i try to get away for a little bit it always comes right back to jesus i'm a prisoner praise god we're prisoners of christ jesus amen now i'm going to leave that subject i just want to brief you with that one uh because you probably hear me preaching about it more in the future but so now i believe just you know i believe they were speaking in unknown tongues to them but then when peter got up there then he spoke in galilean and then the miracle hearing took place there okay so that's how i understand it now now i just want you to know scripture speaks about three different harvests there's a harvest here for barley a harvest here for wheat and then a harvest here for fruits okay so there's three harvests going on so christ was the first fruits and each man is harvested in their own order praise god so christ was like the barley we are the believers the jew the new testament church is like the wheat and then the 144 thousand are first fruits fruits unto god okay so just so you know it's exodus uh 34 22. i'll just read it it says the first fruits of the wheat harvest and then ruth 2 verse 23 says so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and a wheat harvest and dwelt with her mother-in-law so there's a barley harvest here in march there early april and then there's a wheat harvest there in may all the way to august september so just so you know that is scriptural okay now i just want you to notice this too church now let's look at prophetically now if you take 2021 our year minus the year jesus died 30 a.d you have 1991 years we are the gentiles are almost at 2 000 years but i want to tell you we've actually had more time god has had more long suffering on us than the jews because moses got the law in 1491 and it ended in 30 a.d the old covenant was passing away and god was bringing a new one moses and and his covenant lasted 1521 years so now the gentiles have had almost here 400 extra years in the jews you know why because god is long-suffering god is rich in mercy praise god hallelujah that's why that's why people in the next nine years brother william they'll be guessing the rapture comes in nine years nine years right semi-2030 i've already heard people talk about that i've already heard different people put numbers together and talk about 2023 and 2030 you know no man knows the day of the hour no man knows the dare hour let's just be ready for his coming i want you to show that this is the long this is a longer period right this is 1991 years god has offered salvation the baptism of the holy ghost to the gentiles what a time this is a long this is the longest of the harvest right the longest time now i already preached on the former and latter rain the very first sermon remember of this series this is part 10. so part one i started with the former and latter rain now just let's just review it just briefly every harvest season needed a latter rain to mature the crop so before the first fruit harvest there had to be a latter rain and a former rain so the former rain was at the beginning of the planting season the latter rain came right before the first fruits or the harvest that's when the harvest started right because that was the first ones brought to maturity right so there had to be a latter rain before any harvest there has to be a lot of rain because that brings it to maturity and the mature ones are harvested first so uh so with the feast of weeks there had to be a former rain now these were these were wheat crops they were probably planted after the barley crops so they had become a former reign for the wheat and then a ladder rain but prophetically god kind of breaks this cycle right and god says in the book of james he says be patient under the coming of the lord he said the lord hath long patience until he received the early and latter rain establish your hearts from for the coming of the lord draws nigh so james shows us we're in a spiritual season here where before the coming of the lord we need a former and later rain praise god so see god breaks this last age down and he says you need a former and latter rave be patient because the harvest is coming the lord is patient let us be patient as well but there will come a former and later rain to harvest the crop before the i'm sorry to mature the crop before the harvest okay so what i'm saying is there's a spiritual former latter reign before the rapture that's what i'm saying because the bible talks about it in james it also talks about it church in amos yeah it also talks about the spiritual famine and amos a famine in the last days not a famine for bread or water but the hearing of the words of the lord right people these denominational churches they're not really hearing the word of the lord they're just hearing god loves you god's gonna bless you god's gonna make you rich that's all they're hearing the real word of the lord is repent and be baptized forsake your sins hate your sin and let the kingdom of god come into your soul praise god but they leave all that repetitive stuff out you know they leave most of that out they'll mention it one time in the sermon and see they're not really preaching the full message the full word of god that the bible gives us that we should preach aren't you glad for the full word of god hallelujah see there's a famine in this day people are really people that are spiritual are really hungry for the word of god hallelujah the bible says they'll fly around the world the bible says they'll go from sea to sea seeking the word of the lord and shall not find it oh my look at that they can't find it but you did amen they weren't looking all around the world sisterhood for this word they couldn't find it but you did amen hallelujah we you know uh they're trying so hard they're putting money in millions in the building churches thinking they got the word lord but they don't but we've got it it's thus saith the lord it's just like it was in the days of the apostles we have a prophet with us saith the lord and now we've got to take that thus saith the lord and prophesy again oh it's beautiful church it's beautiful what what a great story remember the word former means teacher so that's why brother man's ministry he tells us in the church age book was a teaching ministry right but later reign of course uh is the final he calls it rapturing faith right so we have to be first taught the word of god uh by an anointing of the holy spirit right a reign of the holy spirit right and then receive another reign for rapturing faith right so in other words we don't have to worry about working up rapturing faith rapturing faith is going to come down on us amen just like the teaching reign fell down on you and taught you to love god taught you to repent taught you be baptized with the holy ghost just like that fell on you the rapturing faith is going to fall on you as well oh my let it rain let the windows of heaven open and let it rain praise god hallelujah now there's a key scripture i'm going to bring out and we must really wait for the holy ghost for this one zechariah 10 1. this is one i forgot you need to put this one in the vision sermon i talked about it you know we got to grow together grow individually right we talked about that grow the world but also church zechariah 10 verse 1 says ascii of the lord reign in the time of the latter rain so the lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to every one grass in the field listen church there's going to come a real spiritual time someday hopefully soon brother william where the preachers are going to start getting in one accord it's time to pray for the latter rain and ain't going to be like let's just pray for it and it's a cold prayer meeting like we're going to pray and the anointing's going to fall down and people are going to get filled with the holy ghost i'm talking about right before the rapture because the bible says pray for it pray when it's the time of the latter so we have to know is this a time of latter rain can we sense the season can we see all the signs that that the lord is going to come soon there's going to be another you
