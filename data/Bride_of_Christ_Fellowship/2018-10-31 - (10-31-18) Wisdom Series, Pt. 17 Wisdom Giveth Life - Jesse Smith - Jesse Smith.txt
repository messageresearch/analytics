this series on Ecclesiastes I want to finish these series boy I really got a lot of series and I really want to finish him I kind of feel led which ones I want to next I want to do a series on purpose God's purpose in your life we've been hearing a lot about that and one do a series on Jesus's earthly ministry so basically I want to preach Matthew Mark Luke and John by God's grace so if I can preach 80 sermons on you know the church ages I know I can preach more on that than Jesus's life because the Bible said there's he did so many things there's not enough books in the world where you could write about the life of Jesus Christ so let's look at this please ask you chapter 7 verses 11 and 12 I like to preach on a wisdom giveth life tonight wisdom gives life wisdom giveth life please yeah see 7 11 through 12 Cleese se 7 11 and 12 appreciate the Saints pressing the route to the house of God tonight there's nowhere else I'd rather be on a Wednesday night and then the house of the Lord sings these songs to Jesus and vilas presence say Lord draw me into your presence I want to be closed for drawn amen I can't do it I've got to have your invitation I've got to have your acceptance you've got to accept me just draw me closer to you praise God please ac7 verse 11 wisdom is good with an inheritance and by it there is profit to them that see the son let's read verse 12 together one two three four wisdom is a defence and money is a defense but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom giveth life to them that habit so what's more important money or wisdom we you have to say wisdom and remember wisdom is life and the Bible said God is life God is light God is love so wisdom is the Holy Ghost that's just bow our heads for word of Prayer I want to labor on that just for a few minutes before I get in the message you have a need on your heart just make to God here tonight Heavenly Father Lord my hands are raised Lord I trust others are we have needs Lord tonight we were coming off a wonderful weekend of us great services on Sunday and father we need you more tonight Lord God we know the days are getting darker so we need you to raise up a standard in our lives to your God help us to draw into your presence Lord and draw us by your Holy Spirit we feel you drawing us and now may we Lord receive your word for tonight Lord God receive the the feasting of the word father God we've had our communion two Sundays ago Lord we were in communion with you Lord we we've heard the word this weekend about not retreating and defending our position Lord now help us Lord - he received this tonight that wisdom will give us life here and father we surely need you every hour lord so bless us with that divine presence meet every need tonight Loren minister at every heart I pray Lord I'm at my post of duty Lord here I stand Lord anoint me anoint your people in Jesus Christ name and the church said Amen God best use me and see their praise God I want to take about five minutes just to kind of review a few things here and then I want to get to the rest of this by God's grace I'm gonna set my timer here so I'd keep my body healthy alright so I want to look at this thought here and recall or help everybody recall here that wisdom is the Holy Ghost when we read the book of Ecclesiastes or proverbs we are reading about God's Spirit giving us skill to live our lives you know in any profession you want to be skilful whether you're a security guard right so you want to be a skilful security guard what if you were an unskilful security guard but what if I was an unskilful teacher what would they do they would they would they would go through all the all the all the mandates I miss and they would try to correct me and if that was still unskillful they would have rights to fire me and we know every job requires skill I can't really think of any job that it doesn't require skill if you work at McDonald's or Burger King you've got to cook that Burger with skill every every every job requires some level of skill and so for us we know skill a skillful life is living in such a way where we we live to please God where we do what God has called us to do the word wisdom of course means skill so it's the it's making the right choice by the leadership of the Holy Spirit now I want to read a few things here remember proverbs chapter 8 if you have your Bibles and liddy you can put it up here proverbs 8 22 recall that wisdom is the Holy Ghost it's just another name for it's a it's another synonymous term for wisdom is the Holy Ghost so proverbs 8:20 to the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old I was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the earth was so before the world was there was wisdom so it has to be God because the only thing before God or before the earth had to been the creator of the earth wisdom verse 24 when there was no depth I was brought forth when there was no Fountains abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was I brought forth well as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields or the highest part of the dust of the world when he prepared the heavens I was there when he said a compass upon the face of the earth when he established the clouds above when he strengthened the Fountains of the deep when he gave to the sea his decree that the water should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth then I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his delight rejoicing always before him amen now let's look at go down a little bit here to skip a few verses here verse 33 here instruction and be wise it refused it not blessed is the man that heareth me watching daily at my gates waiting at the posts of my doors whoso findeth me fines wears that word life amen and shouting in faith sinneth against me wisdom wrong with his own soul all they that hate me love death so we either love death tonight or we love life I know you love life that's why you're here that's why I'm here when you find the wisdom of God you found life because wisdom is the Holy Ghost and God is life God his light God is love God is all these things praise God now I want to remind you to if you forgot brother random says the greatest of all gifts is love he also says wisdom that's okay he says both I was gonna I was gonna show how wisdom in love and wisdom is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is love I was gonna show how they're the same aim ahead because brother man says both he says the greatest gift of all is love and then he says the greatest gift of all is wisdom and if you go back to the scripture wisdom was here before the earth was so wisdom has to be the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit has to be loved so there there's there one the same just like Holy Spirit and God the Father they can't be two separate they have to be one amen and so wisdom of course is just the expression of God's mind the expression of God's heart and that expression has to be the Holy Spirit the anointing of the Holy Spirit so program tells us that and here you him 1956 he says the greatest of all gifts is wisdom the second is knowledge he says if you haven't got wisdom how can you control your knowledge what good is your knowledge going to do see what I mean seek the first things first so see wisdom is the greatest gift because it is God's love it is God's skill to know what to do now program said that he said that's the reason God cannot trust too many spiritual gifts with people they don't know how to control them that's the matter today the reason we don't have more than we do so God looks down at church members and he sees well I can't trust this one so I can't give them a gift I can't trust that one so I can't give them a gift because I know they don't know how to control it and who knows how to control the gift of God the only way to control gift of God is through prayer and self-sacrifice right because if we walk in the flesh God can't trust us with a gift but if we walk in the spirit now God can trust us with a gift amen that's the only way so if we were God to be able to trust us with a gift we've got to be more self sacrificial we've got to get more of our time more of our thoughts of the word we've got to be more prayer for prayerful we got to crucify the flesh you walk in the spirit it's really very simple that's our program tells us the reason there's not more gifts is because you can't trust people with them they won't keep it control for example if someone has a gift of will just say gift of knowledge they if they get upset with somebody else in the church they might say well the Holy Spirit tells me this about your life and or well let's say discernment well the Holy Spirit gave me you know they're just mad at somebody the church and they'll say well the Holy Spirit discerning that you're lying about this and you're lying about that and they may accuse somebody falsely saying it's a gift of God doing it and so see God couldn't trust somebody like that with to get to discernment God would rather have somebody wait upon the Lord pray and and seek his face and wait until they're sure they've got a word from the Lord and then they can take it to that person amen so God cannot trust he says many people with gifts that's why there's not as many gifts in churches today who do you know or which searches you know that are so loyal to prayer so loyal to faithful being faithful to God that they have all nine gifts of the Holy Spirit now I know we got quite a few at our church whether you believe it or not I know we've got quite a few I know we got wisdom healing I know we got tongues sister know we speaks in tongues right I've prayed for people we pray for people this last two months that we've seen healings praise God amen hallelujah you know we we have many of these gifts in here and if God's given us a gift that we just got to be more diligent we got to be more faithful with it amen well I want to see all nine operate praise God don't you we want to see all nine operate so we got to be more loyal we got to be more under the control of the Holy Spirit he said says if we're expecting Christ to pull out all nine gifts of the Spirit he said how can he do it when he can't even trust you with church membership so people would jump from church to church how is God gonna pour out all the night gifts when he can't even trust you to be faithful to one church so see if you've been faithful to one church then God can trust you with a gift that's the beauty of that one so we got if brother Rams you know rebuking people for not being papal to church and they don't get gifts then with we're faithful to church then God can trust us with a gift Amen it's the compare and contrast if you know if programs contrasting well God can't throw us people because they're not purchase if we're faithful to church then God should be able to trust us with the gift amen hallelujah so I want to make sure we go over those that the wisdom has to be the Holy Spirit a church what separates the wise version from the foolish version what's the only thing that separates them the oil and what is the oil the Holy Ghost and what makes the wise virgin holy ghost feel they're wise so see wisdom wisdom has to be the Holy Ghost because that's the very name of the people with the oil the wise virgins so the Holy Ghost is wisdom praise God the foolish virgins are version they're just like the the wise but the only thing they're lacking is the Holy Ghost so I hope you can see it tonight that the Holy Ghost is wisdom can you see it tonight by God's grace all right so I hope I proved that to your Thoroughly wisdom was with God before the world was even founded wisdom is the Holy Ghost now remember the scriptures I'm not going to read them but remember proverbs says wisdom is the principal thing he the Bible says withal and get wisdom so with all of our efforts that's why we came to church tonight lord give me more wisdom give me more skill and living my life that I can live more in the spirit and not in the flesh I trust that's why you came to church tonight praise God that is the principal thing and remember the Bible said nothing on earth can be compared to the value of wisdom amen nothing so you know we take a little Tex tonight we read out of ecclesiastes some people might say now I know not and I know not you but some people I say we're just reading out of the Old Testament and yet they would be so foolish that would be so foolish because they don't they they forget that the wisdom of God is contained in this book of ecclesiastes they men the wisdom of God is contained in the book of Proverbs and that wisdom is the principal thing it's the most valuable thing we can do is learn on how to live the right way in other words prayut or writers prioritize our lives so that Christ gets first place in our life that's what real skill is is putting Christ first place in our lives amen yes that's exactly right nothing is more valuable than wisdom choosing that will put God's way God's will God's will above everything else that's wisdom hallelujah now let's go to 2nd Timothy 3 here just briefly well we're almost done reviewing here what was your going there 2nd Timothy chapter 3 liddie you can skip ahead to 12 second Timothy 3:12 remember why your turn there though the very climax of the book of Proverbs is a wise woman at the end of the book after 30 after 30 chapters the Holy Spirit inspired Solomon to but that 31st chapter as a wise woman the very climax what does wisdom produce it produces a very valuable faithful obedient woman that's what Jesus wants to marry a man is a very valuable faithful diligent hard-working woman and that's what we've got to be as the bride of Jesus Christ amen the very highlight of Proverbs is a wise woman and that's what Jesus is exalting today now we're not supposed to exert ourselves we're supposed to let Jesus exalt ourselves amen we're supposed to that Jesus say in other words let Jesus brag on us not us bragging on ourselves not say we're the bride look how great we are but live such a holy life til people look at your life and say if the I ever saw a Christian if ever saw a wise virgin it was that person Amen that's the lesson that's the praise of God when other people praise you for being a Christian that's how you know you're getting closer to God amen that's exactly right we don't brag and beat ourselves on the back and say look at me look how holy I am but we let God praise us through the words of other people so people can see the glory of God in our lives right verse 12 now remember in this context church this was Paul's last letter before he was martyred before his head was cut off in Rome this is Paul's last letter and in context this chapters about the last days remember in the last days perilous times shall come if you read verse one we're not going to read it lover the men will be lovers of themselves lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God covetous trucebreakers false accusers incontinent despisers of those who love the message amen now look at verse 12 yea and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou in the things which thou has learned it has been assured of knowing of whom thou learned them and that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be thoroughly or may be perfect rather thoroughly furnished unto all good works so the last of Paul's written words now we don't have one more chapter he talks about fighting the good fight of faith but some of his last words are encouraging all the believers to remember the Holy Scriptures amen all scripture let's can we all spell the word all real quick Hey ll-let smelled again a ll all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for your earthly life on this side the Bible said it's profitable for doctrine and remember we preach on that how you cannot even get say without doctrine we preach on that a few weeks ago doctrine is instruction teaching or learning reproof so this is what we can get from the book of Ecclesiastes we get doctrine we can learn tonight we can get reproof which is conviction or evidence God can convict our hearts and say oh I was wrong here or I was wrong there we can get correction which is straightening up or Reformation and we can get instruction in righteousness that we may be perfect or complete we can be thoroughly furnished or fully equipped unto all good works amen just by reading the Old Testament and so that's where we like to do now we like to go back to Cleese ask these five so let's go back to Cleese Assis Chapter five I know we started in Chapter seven but I want to build up to chapter seven by God's grace now with that in mind let's see if the Holy Spirit doesn't give us doctrine tonight reproof correction or instruction and righteousness fully a quick equipping us unto all good works let's see if you don't do it I believe he will by God's grace now we've read through all chapters one two three and four and now we're starting chapter five I'm gonna start reading verses one to seven and that won't stop and make some comments here keep thy foot when thou goes to the house of God and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools for they consider not that they do evil all right so what must we do when we go to church we must be ready to listen and not go to church like a fool a fool just wants to give a sacrifice but a wise Christian goes to church ready to hear and listen consider you have to consider that I may have sinned this week right if we come in here thinking well I haven't done I've lived better than most of the people I know or I'm pretty good about being piling the message you know then we the Bible says we come to church as a fool we've got to remember we came to church to worship we came to here we came to here brother man says you come to church to hear about your short places amen verse to be not rash with thy mouth and let not thine heart be hasty to any I'm sorry to utter anything before God for God is in heaven and now upon the earth therefore let thy words be few so let's not make let's not try to make God a promise that we aren't sure we're going to keep like we'll get to a little bit let's be careful what we say with our mouth verse three for a dream coming through the multitude of business and a fools voice is known by multitude of words now how many remember that I remember that the reason you have so many dreams is because you're so busy I don't remember that I've been having crazy dreams lately it seems like when I go to sleep I'm just dreaming the whole time and that's because I'm really busy with all the work demands all these deadlines I got to meet with with you know great guards and and all these things that I have to take care of but a fool is known because of their multitude of words there's a spewing out stuff just speaking too much too much saying too much look at verse 4 when thou foul us the vow unto God defer not to pay it make sure you pay your vow to God for he hath no pleasure in fools pay that which thou hast vow'd recently well a couple years ago I was told I told my person they said I promise I'll be there on Wednesday I promise I'll lead songs for you and the person maybe came to church once or twice she's just making foolish promises and I never asked the person lead songs they they just said they would do it I never asked them I just kinda nod my head and said okay you know ho-ho see about that and of course that shows their foolish right when you make a promise you better keep your promise God says it's foolish to not keep your promise verse 5 better is it that thou shouldest not vow then that that should have ow and not pay suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin neither say thou before the angel that it was an air that wherefore should God be angry voice and destroy the work of thine hands see we don't want to get God angry at us for making promises that we can't keep amen so we see here we must be careful what we say verse 7 for the multitude of dreams and many words there are also diverse vanities but fear thou God so if we really fear God if we really want to hate sin if we really want to keep ourselves pure we'll be careful how many words we say amen it's not the person who's talks the most that's the most spiritual it's the person who says the wisest things that's the most spiritual and usually it's a person who says the least amount of words watch it watch it amongst these church members here on Sunday you know watch watch who's saying the least amount of things not the person who can spew off and make everybody laugh the most that's good it's good to make people laugh it's good to laugh the pressure it's good to have nice times but really watch the people who are most careful with their words those that are really aware that God is keeping track of what you're saying amen you won't hear that preached in very many churches but it's the truth it's the truth the most spiritual people are the ones who Troy's trying to create that atmosphere Amen not just in church but everywhere they go praise God they want to create a godly atmosphere wherever they are amen verse eight well I'll just say like this out I'll just give a little testimony I was uh I was at work yesterday we were at we were not in school we're actually out of training and I was just keeping quiet because all these all these teachers are rounding off all these sins and evil things like that and that and they after about an hour and a half they say well what's what's wrong why are you so quiet and they didn't even realize that the reason I'm being quiet so I don't sin against God a fool will utter things and they just keep talking talking talking but a wise Christian is careful they don't want to join in and they don't want those frolicking spirits to jump on them so they keep their mouths closed and they only say that which pleases God amen it's exactly right that's just how I can see this apply to my life at the church and it's and at work we were the ones that should say very few were the ones that should say only what God would have us to say amen because the Bible says if you do that you fear God hey men Liz Leah verse 8 if thou see us the oppression of the poor and the violent perverting of judgment and justice and a Providence Marvel not the matter for he that is higher than the highest regardeth and there be higher than they so this is why we can be confident when we hear things on the news like the you know the Jews getting shot you know there are last week so it's so awful in Pittsburgh some of these awful things if we're not careful we can let that discourage us so much that we lose the joy of the Lord and don't get me wrong the Bible said we should more with those who mourn but here solomon gives us this wisdom we have to be confident that God will work for the people who are oppressed amen we can't let ourselves get overly discouraged and feel like oh there's no reason for me to even go on or I'm giving up hope or where was God when these people got shot God was there where was God when Jesus was crucified he was right there right here we know he had to turn his back on and yet the Bible says it pleased God to bruise him so see we have to we have to have more fear for God we have to have more understanding that God's divine love is different than our human compassion amen and Solomon tells us we cannot get overly sad about oppressions and persecutions and people being mistreated now of course if we can help them out let's help them out many times we can't because they live so far away but the one thing we can do is we can pray for them and then we can say God I'm gonna trust you I'm confident that you will work on their behalf amen God will bring these sin the judgment how we know that weather on this side or on the on the next side God will bring them to judgment somehow amen verse nine moreover the prophet of the earth is for all the king himself is served by the field to see the profit of the earth is for everybody the Solomon just lays this in here that God blesses everybody with the labors of all the workers of the earth look at verse 10 he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver does that help people Laodicea it ought to write if you love money you're never going to be satisfied with money he that loveth abundance with increase this is also vanity so in other words if you really love money you'll never have enough money in your savings account if you love money it'll never be enough what does the Bible say godliness with contentment is great gain that's the spiritual bank account hallelujah if you could you can no iton tonight where do I love money more to write to have more trust in God because if you love money more you never have enough money you never have enough but if you love God more then you've got all that you need tonight Amen amen not that it's a bad idea to save it's a good idea to save but the the sin of this is this insatiable greed this insatiable lust for money right it's the it's the pride of life or it's the love of it's the lust of the eyes lust of the flesh if our confidence is in those things that were actually in love with the wrong thing we got to be in love with Jesus Christ praise God that's riches so see but let me say this if you love Jesus you'll be satisfied with Jesus amen if you love silver you won't be satisfied with silver but if you love Jesus you will be satisfied with Jesus take that right here yeah that's right verse 11 when goods increase they are increased and eat them right so when you got lots of stuff well now you got to help more people and what good is there to the owners there of saving the beholding of them with their eyes the sleep of a laboring man is sweet whether he even little or much but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep how many could have a good night's rest because you know you worked hard at work you worked hard serving your family all day the kids got fed the kids got a bath the kids got their faces washed you did a good job working amen you can sleep at night saying thank you lord I've done all the work I've had to do today that's right there's a sore evil verse 13 which I have seen under the sun namely riches kept for their owners thereof to their hurt but those riches perished by evil travail and he began at the Sun and there's nothing in his hand as he come forth of his mother's womb naked shall he return to go as he came and shall take nothing of his labor which he may carry away in his hand and this also is a sore evil that in all points as he came so shall he go and what prophet hath he that laboured for the wind not all his days also he eateth in darkness and he hath much sorrow and wrath with the sickness behold that which I've seen it is good and calmly for one to eat and drink now here it is here's the good part about working right here and to enjoy the good of all his labor that he taketh Under the Sun all the days of his life which God give it to him for it is his portion how many had supper tonight with your family I know my family did you know having Supper having something to eat and drink the Bible said God gave you that supper tonight that's a gift from God I know I had supper at the table last night with my family that was a gift of God those are very fleeting and they're very precious moments are they not be with your dad twice a week right like you said those are precious moments cuz one day if God dairies dad won't be there right this is the gift of God and so we've got the sosamma saying we've got to learn to enjoy what's really most important the time that we have with our loved ones amen not seeing how much money and trying to be satisfied with with earning enough money but being satisfied with the loved ones that he gives us this is Solomon's wisdom huh me know it would help America if America you could use this wisdom today huh me know it helped the bride of Jesus Christ you amen that's true verse 19 every man also doomed God have given riches and wealth and have given him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labor this is the gift of God how many know that God gave you Holy Ghost power to go to work today or was it yesterday God gave me Holy Ghost power God gave me the strength and the power to go be a Christian at work today Amen that according to God is a gift of God that we have strength the Bible said it's strike power to eat thereof God gave me that ability God anointed me to go be a Christian today amen and that is the gift or the blessing of God upon my life hallelujah verse 24 he shall not remember I'm sure he shall not much remember the days of his life because God anthers him in the joy of his heart praise God it is far better to get by in life with less but be able to enjoy life the little things and the moments that God gives us with our family and friends that is the gift of God you're gonna forget can you remember what you did last week at work I can't can you remember exactly what you did on this certain day at work you won't remember that but you want to remember that God has given you the gift to be with your family the gift to be with their friends and I'll say like this the gift to be with this church it's a gift from God because remember what the Bible say the Bible says that we should have treasures are our chambers in our home should be filled with treasures and that's not money and that's not Cocoa Krispies and that's not ribs and steak what that is that's the love of God amen amen when your house and churches fill with the love of God now you know you've got treasures of God amen ha ha nore and what is it these all these preachers come in lately and what do they tell me they tell me all your people are so loving your people are so easy to talk to your people are so easy to preach you what do we got here we got the treasures of God in our midst we get our eyes off that like our brother sounds Sunday we'll start sinking down we forget to look at Jesus and there's treasures that he gives us the fellowship that we have with one another just the sweetness of our fellowship the sweetness of how we love and treat one another that's a treasure from God amen that's exactly right even this like even the fellowship that we have I've had people tell me their pastor what won't even shake their hand or their pastor doesn't even spend time with them their pastor can't even sit down and talk with them or can't answer it too busy answer any of their questions but yet I've got enough time I can shake your hand I can chat with you you have a question let me know I mean how many times I stay after church and I love to answer people's questions that's that's a gift of God brother Aaron bringing food on a Wednesday night for all those wednesdays in a row just to have people fellowship and love people that's a gift from God amen you don't have that in many churches that love and the fellowship that we have for one another oh my this is a gift of God this is God's power here this is God's love and we are experiencing it and we have to admit it's a treasure that he's given to us Oh hallelujah I feel like it is at least I know I think you do too this is a treasure it's the little things that God gives us the treasures remember church this is a man who had limitless money limitless women or his sexual desires were limitless as far as that's concerned power he could do anything he could do anything in the whole nation he could order anybody to do anything that he wanted them to do and he says these small things are the gifts of God amen that's why I put that Facebook post last night thank God for my children they're all healthy they all love the Lord many of them most of them been baptized most of them smile at me most of them give me a good night's kiss you know the little ones begged me to sleep with him every night when I can't hardly do that you know because there's not enough room into bed for five people but that's a gift of God after remember that is a power to have a new feed the children to have time to spend time with them to hear them sing and new specials and playing the piano it and work here at the church that's God's gift to us we must enjoy God's gifts amen that's the end of chapter 5 chapter 6 now chapter 6 rather short now verses 1 & 2 have a subject verses 3 & 8 verses 9 to 12 so let's start with 1 & 2 chapter 6 there's an evil which I've seen under the Sun and it is common among men a man whom God has given riches wealth and honor so that he wanted nothing for so loved all that he desireth yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof but a stranger eateth it this is vanity and it is an evil disease so here see this is Salman says this is something common he's seen the evil of having blessings but not having the chance to enjoy them this is what saw people that have blessings but can never enjoy them amen now we're got to make sure that we don't make ourselves too busy where we can't enjoy time with our family we can't even take a Saturday we can't take a Friday night and go spend time with our family right that's why I have to that's why I built in a date night with my wife so I make sure I always enjoy that time with her and I we've got to keep our marriage strong I can't let myself get too busy that I don't take the time to tell my wife how much I love her take her out for a coffee you know when it's warm I can go hold her hand and go for a little walk at the park you know I've got to take time to enjoy our our loved ones because Solomon said I see this all the time people that are so busy we're working getting rich doing it you're doing all they can and they don't even enjoy the little things in life and that's why I preached on Christmas last week what good is it to work my tail off work hard as I can and not give my children a nice gift in it just to remember Jesus to see them get happy and open up a book and say oh I love this book open up a toy and say oh I've always run this toy right or oh this is a beautiful new dresser oh this is a nice tires Malc I might say or whatever he likes you know what good is it to work my tail off and mate run myself down and wear myself out if I don't enjoy the blessings of God what good is it and Solomon says this is a common thing I see people that work work work and they never enjoy life at all they never try to make life better for somebody oh my what good is that he says verse three now verse three to eight is a is a another scripture about enjoying blessings of God if a man beget a hundred children and live many years well I've got seven so I'm on that way glory and live many years so that the days of his years be many and his soul be not filled with good but also that he had no burial I say that an untimely birth is better than he so you can have a hundred children but your soul is not filled with good you don't even enjoy God don't even enjoy your life and then you don't even have a funeral or burial what good is that you don't have a timer people can can all cry let's age let's say this is the casket you know people are they can't even cry Chirk ask and say oh oh I remember brother so-and-so what a wonderful brother thank God for the life that he lived and we're gonna miss him so much what good is it to have all the money in a big family and all these things that people aren't even there to appreciate you if they're not even there if you don't even live and make your soul happy serving God what good is it he says it's no good look at verse 4 for he cometh in with vanity and he parted and darkness and his name shall be covered with darkness moreover he hath not seen the Sun nor known anything this hath more rest than the other yea though he live a thousand years twice old yet I see no good do not all go to one place see we want good things in our lives we want to see good things and there's nothing good there's nothing more good than to see Jesus in your life and to see Jesus in your family amen remember Hattie Wright brother Ram said you can ask for money you're poor you can ask for the healing of your parents you can ask for the healing of your sister but brother Ram said no she asked for something that was eternal amen she asked for the salvation of her two boys praise God and she saw good in her days on this life amen and because she asked for something eternal I believe she's enjoying the turtle benefits of it right now amen she saw good in her lifetime she was poor she only made $20 a year can you imagine that $20 a year she said but I said she farmed on her Hill she would plant crops on her Hill and then go sell them and brother Branham said she gave $20 in the offering all the money she made from there and he was on his way he said to give that money back to her and then when he see when he was at her house that's when she said that she's the third pole operated and brother Ram said whatever you say you'll have it he was he had the $20 in his pocket to give back to the woman but God didn't let him give it back and said God gave her what she really desired to see her boy say amen glory so what's more valuable having 20 men dollars or having two boys that are saved amen what's more valuable having $7000 or having seven children saved amen it's trying to get them saved that's what's more valuable that's the gift of God we all go to one place we want to see good during our life and there's nothing good but God amen look at that verse seven all the labor of man is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not filled see we should do more work than just to feed our bellies there's more to work than just feeding our bellies we're to be at work to be a light for Jesus verse 8 for what hath the wise more than the fool what hath the poor that knoweth to walk before the living amen to see we have to have more to work than just to feed our bellies we got to work for Jesus amen now verses 9 to 12 we'll finish chapter 6 here briefly 6:9 chapter 6 verse 9 better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire this is also vanity and vexation of spirit now this means be certain that your desires do not wander away from the best things amen make sure that we don't look at things that that change our desires well first I want to do this and now I want to do that like I was thinking on Sunday you know I was gonna go up for prayer for some things but I was thinking like what's more valuable to pray for you know we should we pray for material blessings or should we pray to read our Bibles more or pray to pray to pray more or pray to help more people on our job or to help more people in our neighborhood what's most important what's most important is living for other people praise God amen so don't let your eyes wander away from what's really most valuable living for other people like verse 9 says this is also vanity and vexation of spirit so you don't let your desires wonder well I does the desire to God more but but now I think I'll do this oh my verse then that which has been nay that hath been is named already and is known that it is man neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he seeing that there be many things that increase vanity what is man the better right there's so many things that just make us go after vain things right oh we don't want to we don't to go up there vain things we don't want to spend our time on vain things we want to spend our time on what's most important amen verse 12 for who knoweth what is good for a man in this life all the days of his vain life which he spent it as a shadow who can tell a man what shall be after him Under the Sun praise God none of us can predict the future so we must do things that are lasting we must not do vain things or fleeting things we must do things that will impact eternity amen we must in other words we must store up treasures in heaven amen hallelujah remember Jesus said great is your reward in heaven when you live for the kingdom of God amen great is your treasure in heaven how many won great treasures in heaven amen that we must live for the things of God praise the Lord alright Chapter seven I want to just finish chapter 7 if I can finish chapter 7 I'll feel good about tonight by God's grace because I studied and prayed on these and I prepared things I want to make sure I get this done here I want to finish the series by the grace of the Lord how many love the wisdom of God it's life amen it's life I trust so far you've received something that's life to you amen that's a reminder to live this life do do what the Holy Spirit has you to do praise God please ask these seven verse one we'll start with verses 1 to 4 a good better than precious ointment and the day of death then the day of one's birth hey man look at verse two it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heart sorrow is better than laughter and for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth there's a lot in those verses right there you know that's that's exactly right the day of your death is better than the day of your birth doesn't the Bible say that precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints it's precious the day a man or woman dies the Bible said in the eyes of God it's precious oh my did anybody remember what happened on the day Stephen died on the day Stephen died the Bible said Jesus Christ was standing ready to receive Stephen on the day that he was in my heart hey amen the Bible said the day of your death is better than the day of your birth aim ahead Oh amen on the day of your birth your mom receives you but on the day of your death the Holy Spirit Jesus receives you amen what's better well I think the Holy Spirit don't you don't you think Jesus receiving you is a little bit better than mama although we love mama we want mama to be saved we want mama to feel the Holy Ghost but we know we can't have that without Jesus Christ amen that's exactly right the Bible said if you go to the house of mourning like a funeral it's better than going to a party because you'll lay mortality to heart can you remember the last funeral you're at that was better according the Bible that was more beneficial to you than the last party you went to the last celebration because at a funeral you have to examine your life right you have to think mine what are these days that's that may be me if the rapture don't come and the Bible sets better to be mourning or sad than it is to be celebrate celebratory I'm just talking like like a birthday party or something like that yeah well we're thank God for another birthday we thank God for another day right another year but the Bible said you're more benefited by thinking about your mortality than you are about just being frivolous right happy and and and frolicking and things like that remember the Bible said where David David said Lord teach me to number my days that I apply my heart to wisdom amen teach me to number my days help me to remember I don't have forever to live at some point I've got to give up the ghost if God doesn't come back if Jesus doesn't split the skies during my lifetime I've got to go to the grave so it's better to go to a house of mourning than it is to a house of laughter there's my 45 minutes so let me try to find a place to close here how many one a better heart how much your heart to be in better condition amen it's good to think about death it's good to think about people passing away it's good to remember grandma or pass away or grandpa or great grandma or grandpa it's good to think at their pictures and say mine were they ready when they went Lord helped me to be ready praise God verse six or five I'm sorry it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise then for a man to hear the song of fools for as the crackling of thorns under a pot so is the laughter of the fool this is also vanity what would you rather hear a joke a smart out joke or somebody rebuking you for doing something wrong the Bible said you should enjoy rebukes more than silly nonsense and jokes and stuff like that it's better to do that amen look at verse 7 then surely oppression make of the wise man mad and a gift destroys the heart that's a bribery bribery destroys the heart better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof and the patient and spear is better than the proud and spirit praise God be not hasty a nice spirit to be angry for anger resteth in the bosom of fools so slow yourself down if you feel yourself getting angry slow yourself down and try not to get angry too fast because you can do a lot of hastiness with anger verse 10 say not now what is the cause that the former days were better than these for thou does not inquire wisely concerning to this okay so we should have looked at our lives as a mine my life was so much better five years ago boy last year was so much better than this year church we never want to complain because we got to remember before anything can happen to our life God had to approve it just like with Joe before that could happen God had to say okay and if God says it's okay that you and I should be thankful in all things amen it's an evil thing it's a wrong thing to say boy I wish this I wish it I wish we are living through last year more than that then this year why is this your such a hard year that's not a wise thing to say according to the scripture that's what the scripture says there verse 11 wisdom is good with an inheritance here's where our text books and buy it there's profit to them that see the Sun see we got to have money and there's profit to having money but look at verse 12 for wisdom is a defense so if wisdom protects you you don't do foolish things it protects you and but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom giveth life to them that have it amen help me know that wisdom gives life praise God wisdom gives life think about all times where people in the Bible were spared because wisdom operated amen think about that little baby remember Solomon with the two mothers think about the baby the baby was going to be cut in half but what gave it life wisdom gave it life wisdom found out who the true mother is who really cares about the life of this child because of wisdom life was spared amen hallelujah think of the two spies in the days of Rahab the Rhea have had to hide them right in the bushes on the roof what saved their life wisdom so Rahab lie normally lying is an evil thing right but God gave her wisdom in order to hide them right now that's the Old Testament right we're we're we have more power in the New Testament our Amen but wisdom gave her of the ability to save their lives and because she did that she told the devil where she told them well they went out this way and she lied but it's a there to life and they said because you saved our lives if you put up a token your life will be saved amen in other words because she hidden the Word of God she had life amen and that's what you and I do if we hide the Word of God in our hearts will not sin against God amen I don't know your wisdom give it life so wisdom is high Word of God in your heart that you don't sin against God yeah that's what that's that's what that Rahab type is she hid the Word of God in her heart and Satan couldn't get into her heart hey man hey man I don't know yeah how many hiding God's word in your heart tonight don't let say don't let don't tell the devil your secret member of our hams are likes I like Samson don't tell the devil your secret but the man said your secret is your prayer life amen that's about I've said about Samson Samson gave his secret to Delilah he told her where the power rested and RAM said the church has told say in their secrets the prayer meetings the praying with God Almighty that's your power I hope somebody's hearing me tonight amen your power is in your prayer time amen that's why I keep inviting the church come pray before service or pray in your house before service if you can't get here you better come pray because your secret to keeping the power of God in your life amen well I hope somebody can say amen to that hallelujah that's your secret no let your secret get cut off Samson don't let it get cut off that's your secret is your prayer life it's exactly right wisdom gives life its life to us praise God think about Daniel how did Daniel get life even though he's cast into the den of lions he wisdom gave him life wisdom told them it's better to pray to God than not pray to God it's better to pray to God than for 30 days and I have a prayer life I hope I hope that's not our church I hope our church says well I'll give up a month of Prayer cuz I'm so busy I hope we don't give up prayer time I hope we pray no matter what it costs us no matter how tired we get no matter to the trials we go through I trust the church will continue to get on its knees in prayer amen don't let Satan take your life but because he had wisdom to know I must always pray because he had wisdom to know that God spared his life amen just like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego wisdom gave them life wisdom told them I'll never bow to a prophet or an image of a prophet and worship a prophet amen and neither will we will never bow and worship a man what the wisdom tells us that and no matter how much money you would make us or how popular we'd be or how much the church would grow will never bow down to any sin and that wisdom will give us life amen hallelujah that's beautiful wisdom gives life praise God it is wisdom that gives us life how many thankful for God's wisdom oh thank you Jesus per wisdom to have life to serve the Lord can I read something real quick to you how many enjoyed the services on Sunday let me read some to you know that you said Amen and I say Amen - Amen ice truly enjoyed him I was shouting rejoiced and happy - how many woke up sometime this week or how many had a time this week where you didn't even feel like you were saved and the church said this is why we got to go back to this that wisdom gives you life I found these quotes brother have said listen brother you never saved by a sign you're never saved by a sensation you're saved when you meet God's condition of his word and nothing else are you saved by that's right God's Word has made a way you're not saved because you feel like you're saying I'll be honest we haven't got a great time Sunday but I was worn out on Monday and Tuesday there's times I didn't feel real good spiritually brother Adam said you are not saved because you feel like it he said you're saved because you met God's requirement in other words you kept the Word of God you repented you were baptized in Jesus Christ then you were filled with the Holy Ghost that proves you're saved not based on how you feel on Monday or Tuesday or even Wednesday night but it's what God's Word said did you meet God's requirements yes or no if you did you can say thank God I'm saved look what he says brother Branham says I'm not saved because I feel like I'm safe because a lot of times I don't feel that way glory amen hallelujah brother Branham said I don't feel like I'm saved many times and yet how many times does he see the angel Lord you can call him how many times did he see Jesus Christ twice a man that seen Jesus Christ by vision a man that had so many miracles he said a lot of times I don't feel that I'm saved that's why we got keep coming to church that's why you got it while the words being preached you got to say Amen and you need to smile and you need to be happy because wisdom gives life if you're receiving wisdom you should be receiving life tonight Larry that's why I like brother Aaron says you know he notices when I worship I just get a big smile on my face well I'll be honest by there when I come to church many times they don't feel like that I feel more nervous like help me Laura I got all this to do but once I started singing once I started thinking about Jesus once I start thinking about how he died to save a wretch like me I can't help but feel happy in his presence because the wisdom of God gives me life hallelujah and because I feel so good tonight I'll feel even better tomorrow by God's grace that's exactly right your prophet said a lot of times I don't even feel like I'm saved Oh God he was a burning fireball star a burning fire ball of gas in the hand of Jesus he was a real star of God how many believe that oh I believe with all my heart brother Aaron said but I'm saved because God gave the promised glory Lydia's save tonight Malachi saved tonight Haven is saved tonight because God gave the promise not how they feel but because God gave the promise God said repent be baptized and you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost he gave the promise you're saved hallelujah buh-bam said I met God's conditions he says now listen and upon God's holy word I can defeat Satan seven days a week is night because it's God's Word amen you can beat Satan seven days a week because you've got God's Word you've got God's promise how many got God's promise tonight how many got the strong hand of faith holding God's promise tonight you can defeat state in seven days a week with God's promise oh I love that amen hallelujah thank you Jesus let me let me close here we need money we have to have food and shelter but it's not money that gives life it's wisdom that gives life where we at verse 12 write verse 13 consider the work of God for who can make that straight which he hath made crooked if something went really awful in your life who can straighten that out nobody can straighten it out you only have to learn how to live with it right if something went crooked and my this was an awful decision there's no one that can straighten it out except God God is the only one so why worry about it why fuss and stew about why should we worry about it when we can we instead of choosing death we should choose the wisdom of God choose life try to see God you allow this this crooked path you allow this wrong decision you allowed me to walk in the permissive will that I might learn from it and now walk in the perfect will of God wisdom gives life look at verse 14 in the day of prosperity be joyful but in the day of adversity consider God also has set the one against the other to the end that man should find nothing after him praise God so consider church that God orders our paths God allows us to go through prosperous times everything's going good boy everything's going good everything's wonderful everything in the church is fantastic everything at home is good the job is going good health is going good everything's going good with the bottles that remember the same guy that made good times also made the bad times like Jose sang on Sunday but the guy the mountains he still got in the valleys praise God that's where we get this stuff from the Word of God all things fifteen have I seen in the days of my vanity there's a just man that perishes in his righteousness and there's a wicked man that prolonged with his life in his wickedness so Solomon had seen both Solomon's had seen a godly man die early and he see a unjust man lived to a very long life see because none of us really can understand everything that happens in our life we all have to understand that God orders our steps in our past praise God hallelujah God sets the good ones in order against the bad ones God ordains the seasons and times of our life remember life is fleeting proverbs are not guarantees but proverbs are possibilities they're likely they're probabilities this will probably happen if you do this look at verse 16 be not righteous over much neither make thyself over wise why should us thou destroy thyself oh my the Bible in other words don't be overzealous and destroy yourself do not destroy yourself because if you're foolish you could die early like it says yeah let's keep going there verse verse seventeen be not over much wicked neither be thou foolish why should us now die before thy time verse eighteen it is good that thou should us take hold of this yeh also from this withdraw not thine hand for he that fear with God shall come forth of them all amen see don't work yourself to death or done you know just don't don't harm yourself don't don't work yourself to death at all these things find a balance in your life but the main thing as he says at the very end of the book the main thing is to fear God keep his commands and hate evil praise God that's the main thing we see here look at verse 19 here it is right here I hope you're leaving church tonight stronger than you were when you came in wisdom strengthens the wise more than 10 mighty men which are in the city for there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not verse 21 also take no heed unto all the words that are spoken lest thou hear thy servant curse thee for oftentimes also that own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise has cursed others in that striking so you'll be stronger tonight by hearing the word of wisdom more than ten people who are working out at Planet Fitness tonight right anybody ever have them gym membership before I said when I first got out of college I used to go back to the College to work out and I tried to get all strong and try to stay strong I could never get it strong again because I didn't work out very hard but the Bible said you tonight are getting stronger by the wisdom of God then all those people at Planet Fitness who are working out sweating tonight over there wiping their faces lifting heavy weights lifted all this you should be stronger by the wisdom of God hey man that's exactly right right maokai they had a black belt practice tonight you had a chance to be stronger at the practice tonight physically or you could have got stronger spiritually well daddy chose it for you but I know when you're older you'll choose the same be stronger spiritually don't worry so much about physical if you got a chance try to be stronger spiritually amen lay these things to heart lay the late a heart that immortal I'm gonna die I've got it I've got to put the first things first if I don't have tomorrow what would I do tonight I'd be at the house of God amen brother Anderson if I knew the rapture was coming this week he said I'd be in the church preaching today because this is my post of duty this is what God called me to do this is my position on earth this is what I was born for amen I would do exactly what I was doing all the time because I always put God first I always give God first place God is always my highest priority I always do which the father pleases amen ha amen the man said I would not be on the street trying to warm people to get to heaven I'd be preaching if I knew the rapture was going to come tomorrow because that's what God has called me to do amen Church do we know what God has called us to do we want to know what God has called us to do hallelujah hey man thank you lord amen I knew he's coming tomorrow be right here preaching tonight that's that right because I know I know all that the father has given me will come to me and the Bible said forsake not the assembling of yourselves together for these meetings are what edify the body of Christ that's exactly right I better stop right there let's see verse 23 all this have I proved by wisdom I said I will be wise but it was far from me that which is far off an exceeding deep who can find it out let's stand our feet here now we're standing Lydia bring up Hebrews chapter 10 verse 20 verse 22 let's do Hebrews 10:22 Hebrews 10:22 actions go to verse 19 let's go to verse 99 now how many believe it's so important that you were here in church tonight how did he was more important to be here tonight than at Planet Fitness or at home you know sweep in like I need to go sweep at home sometimes there's places I want to sweep and clean you know there's some things I like I like to clean off the garage I need to do that I got a lot of things I liked it you know I could do but I know church on you knows well it's more beneficial that we're here than doing other things that are just vanity things because look at verse 19 now that you come to the piano having therefore brethren boldness to enter in the hoist by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh having a high priest over the house of God who's over this church tonight Jesus we're supposed to have boldness to come to the high priest tonight verse 22 let us draw near let us to see we do it together let Christians draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water so is that how your heart feels tonight is your heart feel sprinkled with I know I got a clean conscious Lord I've tried to confess every wrong I've done how many have a clear conscience amen we're supposed to draw near to God as a body we're supposed to draw near with bonus and in the high priest with a clear conscience nothing sin during my walk with God I've tried that I've tried to repent of everything I know that's wrong I've tried to worship and love God all week and I've drawn into God's presence here tonight verse 23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised amen we had such a good time on Sunday but we can't wave or we can't we can't lose that shrink that we had on Sunday we've got to keep strong together amen we can't waver and say well I don't know if I can do this any longer I don't know if God's gonna work this out I don't know if I can keep this up we've got a we cannot retreat we got to refuse from giving up praise God yes why because God is faithful if God promised you something God's gonna give it to you if he promised it amen and we know his word is a promise let's keep going verse 24 and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works now provoke means it stir up the Bible said we should consider each one to provoke unto love and to do good works so our our thought tonight is what can I do to stir up brother Aaron and the sisters what can I do to make them love Jesus more that should be what that's what the Bible says we're considering to provoke stir them up unto love and good works what can I say tonight that was my prayer tonight when I was praying here before service how can i stir the Saints up to do good works unto God I think this doesn't this book of Ecclesiastes help us want to do good works right it makes us want to enjoy our family time it makes us want to enjoy the little things and not get caught not get trying to satisfy with riches but to be satisfied with Jesus right let us consider one other and you should have thought how can i stir up brother Jesse to love God more how can I provoke brother Jesse to do more good things for God that's what the Bible says let us consider one another so we should come to ready to say my god bless you brother how you doing and try to say something to stir somebody up glory and now look at verse 25 here's the scripture we know that commands us humming over command to go to church this is the YouTube video I'm working on right now I'm about halfway done not forsaking so we still we provoke each other not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is so some people will just abandon each other and they won't they won't try to stir each other up but we're supposed to gather get her to stir each other up but exhorting that means strengthening one another and so much the more as you see that Day approaching so we're supposed to gather more to stir each other up as we see the rapture approaching praise the Lord amen we're supposed to go before the high priest we're supposed to have boldness before before Jesus Christ and we're supposed to come here and say lord help me to consider how can i stir up my brother and sister in the Lord how can I help them love God more how can I help them do more good works for God amen oh that's beautiful isn't it good to go through the scriptures kind of slow sometimes we just read through those so fast you don't even realize what we're reading and so much the more as you see that day approaching praise God now how many how many gonna be ready to do this at the carrying on Sunday every time that we have a carryin it's a wonderful time and this is what we're supposed to do we're supposed to provoke others to love each other more and to do good works praise God amen like I can feel the love of sister Beatrice when she picks up that broom in there it makes me want to pick up a broom it makes me wanna do something you know it does when I see Naomi wipe the table or something like that when I see brother Aaron bring that in the food in there it makes me you want to do something for God because it serves me up it makes my how can I be a blessing to somebody as well amen that's what the curse that's what Christians do we gather together more and we try to provoke people to love God more praise God I want to provoke people to do good more good works unto Jesus Christ so much the more as you see that Day approaching how many are thankful that wisdom gives you life tonight amen wisdom gave all those men the Bible we to men and women we talked about wisdom gave them life hide the word like Rahab hide the word of God in your heart don't let the devil take your seeker don't let the devil rob you of God's Word hey then you hide the Word of God in your heart praise the Lord Amen we'll stop right there by the grace of the Lord next time we'll pick up Lord winning maybe Sunday Ecclesiastes chapter 7 we'll pick that up by God's grace let's uh as we pray here at the end let's think about ways we can love each other more and ways we can stir each other up what what good thing can we do when we gather this is what the Bible says we're supposed to gather more and provoke each other to love and good works how can I do that how can I show the church more love how can i stir them up to want to serve God more that's quite a question amen by it all centers around love it all centers around love the greatest gift love the greatest gift wisdom which is the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit's love God give me wisdom God give me love in order to provoke your children to love you more and to do more works for the kingdom of God amen let's just bow our heads here how many would say brother Jesse pray for me that I can love people more and I can do more good works I'll pray for you Church pray for me I really want that by the grace of the Lord Heavenly Father Lord what a powerful text to close this with Lord God we should consider one another when we come to church we should think about oh my brother's gonna be there my sister's gonna be there how could I provoke them to love and to good works Lord it's the great desire of our life help our desires we heard tonight not to go wayward but help our desire to always be doing that pleasure doing the will of God Lord teach us to number our days help us to remember it's better to think about our mortality than it is to have celebrations help us to be more ready to hear when we come to church than to give a sacrifice of fools just come to church and say I did my time I paid my tithes and offerings I don't need to listen I'm I'm good enough as a Christian help us to come to church ready to hear amen for
