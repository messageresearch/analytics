three one two three fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mine let each

here heavenly father lord we've sung your songs we've prayed unto you we've lord we burn incense to you spiritually the way you intended it to be lord not as the catholic church and as they do it today with the natural incense but it's prayers from a burning heart lord god a heart that burns with love a heart that burns with zeal we've lifted up these prayers unto you in jesus christ's name lord please minister to these requests and we've we've made them known to you ultimately let thy will be done as we want to pray like jesus pray lord let thy will be done above all tonight lord god and lord thank you for these songs we can sing we want to go deeper in the love of jesus we want to say amen to all the word of god so bless us here tonight lord in the short little time that we have together lord bless us for your glory speak to us so god help us tonight show us how much you love us and how much lord god we have so much to look forward to in the future lord as we know that the best is yet to come we know that's true through the scripture the glory of the latter will be greater than the glory of the former so we thank you god and we give you praise in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as being seated praise god i have some slides here let's chill by god's grace all right so lord willing we'll try to finish this series off here by god's grace and lord willing by saturday you know i should have the next audio chapter done i'm working on chapter 8 on the kingdom of heaven right now i'm 91 percent done so hopefully i can have that done by saturday and hopefully that'll be a blessing and i had a couple people reach out this week thank me for doing that i had a brother from norway thanking me for uh this just this morning got email from him and he said thanks for doing those videos about branham tabernacles i said yes sir i said happy to do those and he said but a lot that's swaying a lot of people in norway and he said well i said brother i said i can't come and preach i said you go preach it you got to preach it you know you you do the best you can and so he seemed encouraged and uh the word of god will always set the believer free you know we understand this it's got to be so close it would deceive the very elected if it were possible so what closer could it be right then have the you know the son of the prophet say certain things uh but the prophet pointed us to the word of god that will always be our absolute that'll always be our first love is jesus's words praise god so let's look here tonight we'll try to be uh we'll try to be on time i guess lord willing so we read our text here now i want to just take the first few moments of this sermon and i want to look at these two thoughts that when david instituted these two realities in zion it was foreshadowing the millennium and the future home there are certain truths about the millennium and future home that we see foreshadowed through david's life right and we looked at it on sunday how he put on the ephod you know he saw himself as a pre-figure of the messiah he saw himself i'm a i'm a pre-figure of the kingdom that's to come praise god so he put on an ephod and he was acting like a priest and he could minister right before the ark of god what a what a privilege he wasn't even of the seat of aaron but yet god allowed him as a pre-figure of christ to minister before uh the very arc in church isn't it something we get to minister right in the presence of the holy spirit here today amen praise god there's no one keeping you and i away from the holy spirit right except the enemy when we fall short right so we just got to say sorry and then we're right back in the presence of the lord praise god the bible says that the bible does say that we're as soon as we confess we're right back in the light well what light is that that's the shekinah light amen that's the shekinah light praise god but david when he became king his city of david became the seat of government and authority god's seat for it on earth so you could search the whole earth over and god only had one place where he was going to dwell that was in zion praise god that was in jerusalem that was in the city of david amen and then it also became we ended with this one i didn't spend a whole lot of time on this but it also became the earthly sea of spiritual worship in other words david when he became king he set up the tabernacle and he started ordaining uh musicians to play music to god day and night they didn't have they didn't have i mean some of them would they would go in shifts right uh they'd go in shifts where they would have uh it was it was a priesthood one per month the bible said solomon set it up later where they had one per month so there's one family that would spend a whole month in the temple of god keeping everything going right all the sacrifices all the music well that was inspired by david david said up this family's got january this now they have different names of months thank god because our names and months are named after uh gods right it's so sad greek gods and so forth what a joke but they had their names and they had they had they had one family for each month and so this family the singers would sing and praise god and play instruments 24 hours a day seven days a week praise god and where did david get that inspiration he got that from heaven praise god because the bible said those four creatures they cease not day and night crying holy holy holy is the lord god almighty which was and is and is to come may we join heaven right now by saying holy holy holy is the lord god almighty amen praise god whenever we do that we start joining heaven and then heaven starts coming down to earth amen amen as we praise god as we love god as we give god worship then the spirit of god comes down and we start submitting to the will of god for our lives in other words the more music you play in your home the more sermons you listen to in your home the more heavens will for your life will come down in your home god's will will be done in your home and so it is in the church as well we sing our songs we worship god we join heaven and then heaven's will becomes made known to the church and then we can say amen to it praise god amen but this is what david did he set up god's government on earth and he also set up constant worship on earth now here's my reference he's a pentecostal preacher i don't know if he's alive or not anymore but i used a lot of his thoughts a good thought good good thoughts so let's look at some scriptures that teach this and i just have them up here so uh we don't really have to turn too much in our bibles here this morning this evening sorry so uh here's a scripture we this is our opening scripture god sets his king upon zion he says yet i have set my king upon my holy hill of zion i will declare the decree the lord has said to me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee praise god and we know jesus did that on mount transfiguration right the holy spirit spoke this over jesus on a mountain praise god a mount transfiguration which is i think by the map it was just a little northwest of the actual mount moriah it was just a little bit northwest of that the mount transfiguration in fact all the scholars got question marks where was this mountain amen so it's a little bit interesting about where this mountain was but god it must have been close to zion right because it's connected with zion it must have been very close and god said this day have i begotten thee have i brought thee forth now see church that's how it is with our lives when you have a new birth a new life has brought forth in you when you're born again you don't live the old life it's like a brand new life praise god right it's just like when i remember we watched the video when zion when the kids first saw zion remember watch that i don't know if all of you did we watched the video when they first came down there well a few hours before that zion wasn't there we didn't see him but then after he was born then he was brought forth everybody knew they're all shocked it was a brand new life praise god a life that you never saw before now you saw and that's how it is when you're born again now you live with power now you live with love now you live with mercy now you live with god's grace it's a new life nobody saw before you're born again amen you're begotten hallelujah the actual acts of the word means brought forth amen god has brought forth your true life on this earth amen you never lived it before but after you got the holy ghost now you live it amen it's brought forth and so this was of course fulfilled in jesus day but church we know this is also future for the millennium amen and the future home we'll try to end with that one tonight by god's grace hallelujah so where's god's authority god said it's going to be on zion he'll probably hear his name about 500 times tonight next zion is the city of the king priest the lord said to my lord sit down on my right hand shall i make thine enemies thy footstill the lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of zion so the strength comes out of zion comes out of jerusalem rule thou in the midst of thine enemies amen isn't that just like we know uh even governments and businesses they they influence from the top down right however the ceo behaves that's how the rest of the company behaves right that's the direction they're going same thing for a church that's why i like how you live in holy all you saints living holy that proves i'm living holy amen if you live holy that proves i'm living holy because the influence goes from the top down praise god remember i'm not so so so top at all i'm still a sinner saved by grace in other words we don't we don't i'm just a minor shepherd i'm a little pebble shepherd on the beach but jesus christ is the one great stone amen hallelujah he's a great stone we're all looking towards praise god amen so that's how it is today uh that's how it is you know in the spiritual right uh the word the strength flows out of heaven amen it flows down to earth praise god like when brother cam was here when brother randy was here i don't know about you but brother diggs is here i feel strengthened i feel like i leave out of here stronger than when i came now what happened was there anything different about the room did we change the paint and now everything looks a little better matches the seats we didn't change that but god's strength came down from zion amen god's word descended down from the spiritual zion and strength flowed out of god's throne amen and we leave here feeling stronger praise god because that's what the bible ordains but one day sister brother that's going to be physical it's going to flow right out of jesus christ's mouth amen this can you imagine him sitting there he sit there in the millennium he'll give a decree and they'll put that iron rod down and everybody will listen and the influence will go around the world amen for a thousand years hallelujah amen it's gonna flow out of zion the strength of god hallelujah amen so as you meet with our lives right people should feel the strength of god flowing out of us amen as long as we're in touch with that kingdom from zion like the bible says refuse him not the bible says zion is the city where the king forever dwells so we got to wonder what wonder what god's address is going to be after a few million years we don't have to wonder church god tells us he said the lord shall reign forever even thy god o zion unto all generations praise ye the lord so god's dwelling place will be there that will be his earthly home praise god his his heavenly hope will come down to earth and god will dwell there forever now next let's move to this next thought now all these verses deal with the constant worship that comes out of zion after this i should hear some amens and some praises i should hear some shouts i should hear some lovely laughter i should hear some joy after some of these hallelujah because that's where joy comes from that's where praise flows it flows out of zion amen strength comes from it praise comes from it all that we are comes from zion amen because that's god's dwelling place hallelujah so the first one is zion is the place of the lord dwells sing praises to the lord which dwelleth in zion now right now it's in heaven right because it's the spiritual side declare among the people his doings so we're told to praise him and we're told to declare uh amongst the people is doing so like after school today i picked up the milk from the uh from our friend's house right and their daughter their grandparents but their daughter's having a baby soon and i said don't be discouraged i said something like that i said don't fear i said god will take care of that i said no matter when it comes god will take care of it i got to tell the testimony of when zion came and uh how you know we knew we knew he was coming and my wife called the midwife and she couldn't come or she couldn't make it on time so my wife was able to deliver the baby all by herself and then she handed it to me and then the uh then the the lady got there later the the what they call it the midwife there's that word midwife that's what happens when i'm tired i'll forget words i'll say things backwards but anyways i just told that testimony and i told her i told them how god will take care of it i said you can plan everything fine but it ain't always going to work to your plans unless god told you in advance right so you got to be ready and you just got to trust god that god will take care of it amen and i said god even gave us the name of zion before he was born because my wife had the dream she in the dream she had the baby herself hand the baby to me and said here's your son zion jesse that's exactly what happened because god always foretells the future right if we're humble enough to hear now we don't hear it all the time i'd like to hear more praise god that's one time we can clearly see because my wife had the baby hand it to me so then she could you know move on and we could start the clean cleanup process uh but that's what i was trying i'm just trying to witness and this is what god does god prepares you god provides for you god wants to take care of you praise god he dwells from zion he wants to hear your praises amen he wants to hear you testify praise god he wants to hear you be thankful for what's flowed out of zion hallelujah that's where he dwells that's his house next it's the place of salvation where did you get saved brother it wasn't ghana it was zion where'd i get saved it wasn't actually columbus it was actually zion amen spiritual zion because the bible said oh that salvation of israel will come out of zion when the lord brings back the captivity of his people jacob shall rejoice and israel shall be glad amen let me go back to that picture where did you get saved church let's see i'm on slide 10. let me go way back to the beginning that's going to be seem crazy but hopefully i can find it you were saved at one of these mountains there it is look at how i found it so fast which mount were you saying that we say that the law where you're just everything was a fearful or were you saved at the place of grace amen we saved at the place where you looked up and you saw you saw the lamb of god taking away your sin praise god and you wept and you cried that's where i was saved on mosiah amen not mount sinai where there's law and death but i was saved on zion where there's life amen hallelujah praise god where there's mercy where there's grace where there's deliverance praise god where there's power amen hallelujah that's where i was saying praise god that israel is blinded right that's why this scripture is prophetic they're blinded their salvation is going to come to mount zion literally but we've inherited a spiritual zion amen we've come to a mountain that cannot be moved amen hallelujah this one cannot be moved praise god this is the better mountain with better promises glory praise god that's where i was born i don't know about you that's why i was saved i know i know i shouldn't say that i know you that i know you know that sorry sometimes i sometimes get that visiting preacher mode you know i don't know about you guys but i know about our church praise god we're saints hallelujah by the grace of god only by god's grace hallelujah so that's the place of salvation god brings us out of captivity and then we rejoice and we're glad hallelujah so we realize we're saved and then we rejoice we're happy we praise the lord we can't let this world discourage us we can't be discouraged by things that don't seem like they're going our way we can't just let those things get us down we must remember where our salvation came it came from heaven praise god and that ruler there he doesn't lose a term he can't be voted out praise god amen he can't be complained against he can't be he can't be wrong amen he can't die hallelujah he's only going to live and he's going to declare that you're more than a conqueror in his name amen nobody can get rid of him praise god he's not up for a vote hallelujah that's where i got my salvation you did too isaiah 59 20 and the redeemer shall come to zion and unto them that turn from transgression and jacob saint the lord we know that's in revelation as well jesus is coming to israel to bring to unblind or to make the put the eye salve on the 144 blind jews and they're going to recognize we crucified our messiah but then there's going to be the bible said a fountain opened in the house of david amen a fountain of forgiveness and cleansing and the holy spirit washing praise god next zion is the place of strength again we already read it one time right the lord hear thee in the day of trouble the name of the god of jacob defend thee send thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee out of zion in other words like the bible says my help comes from the lord praise god when you need help it's got to come from somewhere it can't come from me or anybody else it's got to come from god amen our help comes from the lord you shall lift your eyes to heaven or lift your hands to heaven say jesus i need your strength now it's going to come the bible says that's where it comes it comes out of spiritual zion amen god will send help from heaven if we call on his name hallelujah because it's not the physical zion right now it's our spiritual heavenly we'd say headquarters praise god that we're hearing the voice speak from heaven tonight it's speaking from heaven through the word as it does amen all the time that's where we receive strength from the word of god hallelujah let that be your strength like i was telling chrisette you know uh this this week's memory verse i memorized in fifth grade i still remember when i memorized it fifth grade that verse has been a blessing to me trust in the lord with all your heart lean not to your own understandings amen in all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your past straight praise god in my hardest times in life many times that scripture has come to me right it's come to me and it's just been a strength in me like i can't lean upon my understanding i don't know everything i don't know what's going to happen in the future but i know somebody that does amen hallelujah and i can choose either to trust in myself or trust in the almighty god and let's choose to trust in god hallelujah thank god we read this earlier in part one zion is the place of joy of the whole earth oh my goodness hallelujah church where did the holy ghost first fall in jerusalem praise god that's for the joy that's for the simulation the bible said they got they must be drunk they weren't drunk they were just happy amen they were just rejoicing and praising the lord they've been forgiven they've been empowered they were given new lives amen before they were like uh you know they're fearful cowards running from them but now they're running rejoicing in the streets praising god this is the place of the joy of the whole earth in other words the happiest place you'll ever be is worshiping god hallelujah giving god praise amen be the real christian praise god this is where the bible says beautiful for elevation the joy of the whole earth is mount zion on the sides of the north the city of the great king the king city amen i'm on my way to the king city how many on the way to the king city praise god the most beautiful place like i said if i don't get to jerusalem in this life i know i'm going to get to the next one praise god i won't need a plane ticket then praise god i won't need three thousand dollars for a round right ticket then i have a one-way ticket hallelujah i'm a one-way ticket to my home amen the most beautiful the most joyful place in the world where jesus christ lives hallelujah that's our home amen that's our joy praise god the city of the great king thank god amen the joy of the entire world is jerusalem it's also the place of god's beauty the mighty god even the lord has spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof out of zion the perfection of beauty god has shined there's something about this place it's the perfection of beauty in the eyes of god you have two raised up mountains you have valleys down there and it's just land locked right in between uh between egypt and the middle east whereas it's only water sources are those springs that spring up they've got to depend on god to send the rain they've got to have real relationship with god they've got to live in the blessings of god amen it's just placed beautifully the bible said i don't even understand it all but i know what the bible says about it it's the perfection of beauty where god has shined upon that land amen this place where god is praised that's why i like when brother cam comes or and the brothers they say you guys got really good worship going on that's a blessing to my heart praise god that should it should be with us because we should be in touch with the spiritual zion because the bible says praise waits for you in zion amen in other words god uh you're gonna when we gather together you're gonna be praised lord you're really going to be worshiped we're really going to tell you we love you in our song service amen hallelujah it waits for you in zion right in this kingdom in the city where god is worshipped in other words praise waits for you and bride of christ's fellowship amen why because we're a part of the kingdom of god the baptism of the holy ghost that's where god's praise waits for him in the bride glory praise god and unto thee shall the vow be performed in other words god will keep his word to us oh thou that hears prayer unto thee shall all flesh come now speaking of the millennium right and the new jerusalem all flesh is going to come to jerusalem right praise god right there at the uh right before the battle of armageddon they're all going to come against it right and jesus is going to destroy him for coming against jerusalem but once we get in the millennium where there's a thousand years of peace all flesh will come unto him and we'll get to that here soon zion is the place god loved and chose look at this moreover now look at this church he refused the tabernacle of joseph and chose not the tribe of ephraim now how many know joseph's a pretty holy man in the bible he's a he's almost a perfect type of christ almost and we're going to get to that maybe next week i'll study on that today only judah and joseph have the same amount of blessings amongst the 12 boys they have just amazing blessings it's like all blessings because they love god so well but the scripture says i would not even put my tabernacle in joseph i won't put my tabernacle and his son ephraim but i chose the tribe of judah mount zion which he loved hallelujah and he built a sanctuary like high palaces like the earth which he hath established forever he chose david also his servant and took him from the sheepfolds in other words god looked at all the other places said this is nice this is pretty good this is pretty good but i like this one this is the place i really love praise god amen how many know god did that as well with you praise god he looked at all the people down through time and said who's going to love me who's really going to love me oh they're going to love me i'm going to wake away i can make myself known to them i'm going to bless them i'm going to keep them my face is going to shine upon them amen hallelujah that's what the bible said dearly beloved praise god the bible said but god rich in mercy where in his great love he hath loved us oh god's love is so great church many times we can't even understand it may god help us to know the length the breadth the width and the height of god's love amen four dimensions of this love maybe seven i never thought about that till now all the places he could have chose he could have chose akron we said he could have chose jeffersonville he could have chose all these you could could have chosen ephraim but he chose jerusalem in judah which means praise his home is in praise there it is praise god may god find praise in this home right here may we be a house of judah a house of praise where he can dwell amen it's the place he loved more than any other place see that's why i was remember we preached that a few years ago god does have favorites right but it's based upon those who keep his commandments right god loves everybody but he has to have a favor it's like a husband has his wife that's his favorite right just like your children your children are your favorite my children aren't your favorite your children are your favorite right that's just how it is god gives us we call them special relationships and god loves this place more than any other places amen his foundations is in the holy mountains the lord loveth the gates of zion more than all the dwellings of jacob all the other 11 sons he said i like judah's location i like zion i like jerusalem better than all of them i like salem peace amen i like peace more than all of them i like peace amongst the believers didn't the bible say that how good impression is for brethren to dwell in unity how many years brother have you seen where there's been disunity amongst believers how many years how many years have staying on my mind right my mind where i've seen brothers be in disunity rather than unity it just brings reproach right but if the people cry out to god what happens strength flows out of zion if people really repent and people really want the blessings of god if they really want to praise god and serve god they'll cry out to god and the strength of god will flow from spiritual zion down into the churches and churches will have renewed fellowship amen that's right because remember you don't only conserve one or two masters either love one and hate the one or love the one and hate the other we gotta love if we love jesus christ we'll love his people that's right now look at this brother i'm sure you've seen this before but it's been a while since i've looked at it i was surprised zion is the place of births births this has to be the millennium right the bible said a child may die a hundred years old in the millennium and of zion it shall be said this and that man was born in her and the highest himself shall establish her that's jesus christ right the highest jesus christ the lord shall count when he writeth up the people that this man was born there sila brother brahm uses this scripture the church age book to say there's one more roll call in the new jerusalem there's gonna be one more time where god writes down names and he says it's a fresh list of the names of all the people that live in the holy city amen praise god how do you how many believe your names on that list amen hallelujah and like brother william and i were saying on sunday if you're if you have any doubt just talk about jesus more because the bible says the more you talk about jesus the angels write it down in a book of remembrance and god has rewards for you waiting in heaven praise god hallelujah that's right that's book of malachi says that god is going to write the names of all the dwellers in the new jerusalem mount zion this man was born here this one was born here this one was born here zion is the place where the lord reigns the lord reigneth now remember i told you church there's 156 times the word zion is used in the old testament so i can only scratch the surface 156 and that's not even the jerusalem words which would probably be uh hundreds more let the people tremble he sits between the cherubims let the earth be moved the lord is great in zion and he is high above all the people everybody say oh oh he's higher than brother branham he's higher than martin luther he's higher than john wesley praise god he's higher than paul he's higher than peter he's the highest one he's the only great one in that city praise god there are 24 thrones right but there's one throne that's higher than all of them amen those 24 thrones answer to one throne that's the king's throne the great king jesus christ let them praise thy great and terrible name for it is holy let's all say praise the lord ready praise the lord the bible said praise that great and terrible that powerful name hallelujah thank you jesus praise god just speak that holy name amen it's a great powerful name hallelujah heaven responds to it amen strength will come out of zion if you speak that holy name praise god zion is the place where the lord appears in glory now brother i'm really looking forward to this one brother hallelujah i've gone my whole life i've never seen the pillar of fire but one day church the pillar of fire is going to be seen all day amen and all night amen and all throughout hundreds and thousands and millions and ages and years and decades and epochs whatever they call epochs whatever they call it the glory of god will be visible amen we don't have to feel bad we didn't see the pillar of fire with moses we don't have to feel bad we didn't see the purifier with brother ram we got to be thankful that we'll live in eternity by the pillar of fire [Music] the hallelujah says thou shalt arise and have mercy upon zion for the time to favor her yay the set time it's come right now israel's not really favored right all the world is against her but there's coming a time when god's gonna start favoring her when the lord shall build up zion see right now the man their men are trying to build it up but there's coming a time when the lord will build up zion and he'll appear in his glory it's the place where the lord's name is declared and praised to declare the name of the lord in zion and praise and i'm sorry and his praise in jerusalem so it's the name where you feel there's a place where you feel the name the authority the power of jesus christ's name as a place where you praise him that's what zion is in other words it's all about jesus and it's all praising jesus all the time sounds like a good church service i don't know it sounds like our lives should be like that as well amen it's the place of blessing how we want to be blessed the lord shall bless thee where out of zion and thou shalt see the good of jerusalem all the day every day i'm going to see god's blessings upon my life amen as long as i listen to the directions the voice amen the voice coming out of sight god will bless me every day praise god hallelujah yeah i'll have struggles i have trials but i'll find blessings in it if we just wait on the lord because as we honor zion his name is spoken his power flows out his blessings flow out all the days not some all the days of your life that's where the place of blessing is in zion praise god all these years brother i've been living inside i didn't even know it i didn't even realize it i'm living in a spiritual place heavenly places amen hallelujah this whole time no wonder god's blessed my life all right you can say the same thing again it's a place of blessing there's numerous scriptures that say this the lord that made heaven earth bless thee out of zion out blessed be the lord out of zion which dwelt at jerusalem praise ye the lord see we got these different signs right we got an earthly one we got a heavenly one praise god we just got to recognize what it's talking about i like this it is the place of god's rest and dwelling forever for the lord hath chosen zion he hath desired it for his habitation this is my rest forever here will i dwell for i have desired it god's desire and as we know god's going to get whatever he desires nobody can tell god no now if you've got your bibles go to isaiah 2 and i'll need some readers here maokai lydia can you read for me isaiah 2. one to five here we see the word of the lord is taught now here where we're looking at the millennium because all these heathens are going to have to know the word of god and guess where the word is going to flow out from where are they going to learn from church where all these heathens we know whether there's people getting a second chance or whether it's people getting their first chance where are they going to learn from god's habitation lydia can you read one two three please maokai four five six i'm sorry four five hey man maokai 4-5 please and the church said this is the millennium right here all these nations are going to be out there they're not going to know the word of god but they've got to come to the house of the lord it's going to be built in jerusalem and they've got to learn the word of god there and jesus is going to settle all the disputes oh that's going to be beautiful praise god and nation is not going to rise against nation not going to bomb other nations they're not going to destroy them do suicide bombings or anything like that or package bombs or anything like that there's going to be no wars because the fear of god is going to be there god's word is going to be going forth there's going to be a true leader there a godly leader there it's going to be god in flesh amen hallelujah thank god and they're going to say hey let's go up come come let's go up to the house of god amen

commit adultery or commit fornication there's no devil there to do any of that they're always going to say let's go up to the house of god let's learn the ways of god hallelujah so where is the word of god taught it's coming out of zion it's also the place of complaining depression and fear no oh did i read that wrong i didn't read that wrong didn't i tried to get a laugh out of you isaiah 51 11 therefore the redeemed the lord shall return and come with singing remember the other psalm says israel was out there in babylon and they hung up their harps on the trees and they couldn't sing the songs of what zion amen that means the songs of zion are victorious songs and you can't sing them out in captivity you only sing the songs of zion with the blessing of god with the strength of god with the word of god amen that's why some churches don't sing victoria's songs because they're not getting victory praise god but god with victory should be singing victorious songs and everlasting joy shall be upon their head i can't wait till some of these message believers brother william finally crack a smile in the house of god they finally cry and shout and praise the lord i can't wait to see some of these people yeah they come to uh different churches yeah they never smile they never praise they never lift their hands i can't wait if they're really born again then surely at this place where strength is flowed out where the prince of god lives finally those people will give god praise amen i've got reason to wonder if they'll even be there but that's another story they shall obtain gladness and joy and sorrow and mourning bye no more sadness see later bad days sorrow fear destruction uh anger death bye bye won't see you there anymore there's only life there's only peace there's only hope amen there's only strength there's only love there's only victory amen flowing out of god's house again sing unto the lord for he had done excellent things this is known in all the earth cry out and shout thou inhabitant of zion oh that's what we need today praise god i think we need some inhabitants of zion saying praise the lord amen hallelujah for great is the holy one of israel in the midst of thee praise god we don't know what he's going to do we we don't want to get in his way but we know this he said where two or three are gathered there i am in the midst of thee praise god so he's here tonight church hallelujah we need to cry out and shout and praise the lord because he's great hallelujah he may not do what you want but he'll do exactly what you need praise god zion is the name of the people of god jerusalem and i put my words in thy mouth and i've covered thee in the shadow of my hand that i may plant the heavens and lay the foundation of the earth and say unto the zion thou art my people zion is my people the bride is my bride amen the church is my wife amen zion is the place that publishes good tidings how many see good things in your future that's what zion does zion sees good proclaims all the good things for your life oh zion that bring us good tidings get thee up into the high mountain o jerusalem that bringeth good tidings lift up thy voice with strength lift it up be not afraid say unto your cities judah behold your god church i'm bringing good tidings to you tonight there's it's a joy to be a christian god is going to bless your life going forward the more you honor zion the more strength god's going to give you praise god i'm here to bring in good tidings when you're sick god will heal you praise god hallelujah when you're discouraged god will encourage you praise god when you need phys physical needs god will supply those needs amen good tidings praise god when you're wrong god will correct you that's one of the best ones amen we don't shout a lot about that one but that's the truth when the blessings are best things are that god will correct you when you're wrong and you won't be prideful and be deceived and think you're right when you're not right amen in other words he'll correct you and make sure you're right and you keep your humility zion is the city of great solemnities which is sacred gatherings look upon zion the city of our sacred gatherings thine eye shall see jerusalem a quiet oh it's going to be quiet church same a tabernacle that shall not be taken down not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken hallelujah god is going to place that permanently that tabernacle is never going to be moved amen it's going to be there that house that beautiful new jerusalem it can never be shaken it can never be moved no devil can ever get rid of it praise god you'll never you always have a place that you can call home praise god the devil can't take away that home amen because he'll be burned up and done away with praise god he can't touch your future god has blessed your future amen your future is in christ jesus amen he can't touch it that's why he hates you so much that's why he tests you all the time and tries to frustrate you all the time because he sees what's going forward but you will be protected it's the city where the foundation stone is laid remember we read this one we sang this one with brother amen on community tonight i lay in zion for a foundation a stone a tried stone a precious cornerstone a sure foundation foundation melaka asked me about this a while ago he that believeth shall not make haste that means to urge on to flee or be afraid in other words he that believeth will not run from that foundation stone they'll they'll watch god build upon that foundation stone in other words they'll stay at mount zion they'll not make haste and flee from it that's what the pharisees did right they left jesus that's what those 70 preachers did do right the 70 remember when they left jesus jesus said you want to go to peter no where else are we going to go see it was they they made haste they said that's too hard i can't understand that but they should have saw the holy life amen they should have saw the holy spirit they should have saw the supernatural power they should have seen the love of god amen but they made haste they left from it they left that foundation stone here's the one i was going to get to church i was a little bit early on this one and the lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount zion now remember this church every dwelling place of mount zion you mean there's going to be lots of dwelling places in zion yeah that's the new jerusalem i'm sure i'll be right down the street from maokai and lydia in case i'll be right down the street you can always come see your dad there's a new city my wife and i hopefully have a place there's dwelling places in mount zion and upon her assemblies look at this what's upon these dwellings a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night and upon all the glory shall be a defense god's glory is going to hover over us during the daytime hover during the night time it's going to be a shield god's going to be a fire all around you amen his presence is going to be around everybody that's what we've longed for that's what we live for our whole lives but there we'll experience the reality of it the never endingness right the eternity of the blessing of god visible upon our lives amen hallelujah so if i don't see it here brother i know i'll see it there and jesus said blessed are those who haven't seen yet have believed amen and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime for the heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain i'm not sure about that but that's what the bible says i believe it let me close with this this zion is a mountain out of the mountain hallelujah i preached this back in 2017. the earth will have to push up a mountain to receive this city it's so big the new city which is the holy mountain will sit on this mountain brother braham said it in the earth's time of purifying by its fire and baptism there will be a volcanic such as the earth exploding and will push up a pyramid-like mountain did you hear that there's going to be a volcanic explosion in jerusalem brother and it's gonna be so big imagine the lava and the ash flowing up and uh it's gonna spew all this magma out it's gonna or lava it's gonna turn to magma right when it gets outside the earth and it's gonna build up it's gonna keep spewing until it builds up this huge mountain and that's just the bottom of the mountain that's coming praise god i didn't hear you praise god because then heaven's mountain comes down and rests on that mountain amen hallelujah the earth bringing forth all this lava to make a platform for god's home for his bride that's where i'm going to live that's my eternal address praise god plenty of room to do it the whole thing will be changed the whole surface will be changing got it it'll push up like a pyramid mountain this would be exactly with the word if it does which it will remember isaiah 65 25 they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain saith the lord now i don't have time for that one okay so this is what happens there's all these uh there's all these volcanic volcanic explosions and god raises up those previous mountains that are there right zion and all these uh and moriah and mount olives he gushes up remember church they had a earthquake there when jesus rose from the dead so there must be some fault there right there must be some fall where they can uh the plates can slide in and out and there's lava waiting right under there praise god amen and when the time is right the plates will slide and all this volcanic ash will come up and all this lava and it will build up this platform and then the city of god will come down out of heaven as a bride prepared for its bridegroom amen it's a wedding amen it's a wedding of heaven and earth amen hallelujah this is how god marries the earth to heaven hallelujah glory the new city is a mountain on top of a mountain sounds familiar like word on top of word on top of word from glory on top of glory on top of glory from faith on top of faith on top of faith praise god amen brother they said it's brother adam explain isaiah 2 verse 2 yes i did the house of the lord shall be established in the top of the mountains and all nations shall flow into it this is what we just read earlier it shall come to pass in verse 2 the last days that the mount in the lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and all nations shall flow into it and that's where god will teach us his ways and we will walk in his past aren't you glad church you'll never make a step out of god's will there glory we do it here often don't we we'll take a misstep here i knew i should not have done that lord forgive me why did i do that but there no no everything's going to be perfect god jesus christ will rule he'll send forth his word and we'll obey it praise god there'll be nothing there to stop us from obeying it praise god we'll carry out every command amen without a flaw we'll walk in the ways of god in the light of the word amen hallelujah there's no devil there to stop us there's no devil to tempt us to leave the past of god then the bible says there's a light at the top of this mountain it's typed by mount sinai mount transfiguration the bible says the city had no need of the sun neither the moon to shine in it for the glory of the lord did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof but said notice mount sinai was where god depended descended on top of it he spoke to israel a pillar of fire he descended on top of a mountain mount zion on mount transfiguration when he declared this is my beloved son here he him he descended a pillar of light and shining brightness upon the top of the mountain both peter before peter james and john and in there he was represented with both moses and elijah and translated the dead raised glory the light is from the top of the throne at the top of the mountain the lamb is the light thereof and he showed me a pure river of uh of water of life clear as crystal remember we're talking about that foreign proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb now picture this a throne but water flows from the throne what kind of throne is that a throne and water clear water throws flows out of the throne oh i can't wait to see it i can only imagine hallelujah that's the lamb's throne so i got my generic picture right that's jesus on the throne right he'll be there he'll be shining the light of god light will flow out of them not just light supposed to be lights my it's my first grade uh illustration for you right all the light now we're gonna live in this city and jesus is gonna be at the top shining out his light the newer city and the new earth the new creation this is mount zion the city of the hill with the throne in the top of it the throne up here on top the dwellers all up and down on this mountain on the throne on top of it 1500 miles high imagine that 1500 miles high the whole world will see the light of the world jesus sitting on top of the throne of the world top of the church top of mount zion amen the whole world will see jesus sitting at the top of this mountain what a mountain praise god and no matter where you are on the earth i'm not sure how that works but you're going to be able to look and see there's jesus aren't you glad wherever you go in your life brother you always see that there's jesus praise god no matter where you travel there's jesus no matter where you go you'll always be able to see jesus thank god that's how we can live today too praise god i see jesus in my service i see jesus on the drive home i see jesus at the park i see jesus in my house i see jesus in my family let's see jesus everywhere amen this is the a reality of the christians who are born again and love the lord picture of something like this jesus on the throne and all the lights coming out of him and he got the pillar of fire there too the man said on top of mount zion will set the lamb and the city will need no light for the lamb is the light thereof you have to say sister beatrice can you turn on the light real quick you want to say that brother can you light the oil lamp real quick you won't need that darling can you turn the light don't need that the lamb is the light thereof amen what a light i imagine brother just goes through the walls i imagine it's something like that it just shines through every wall it's just such a powerful light amen and above the lamb above the lamb will be the father which is the logos god the great light the great eternal light that will shine just above the throne and jesus will not be on the father's throne he'll be on his throne glory and the father will hover over the sun which the father and son will be one where is this taking place in zion where the father and son are one this is the time once we get there this is the time the kingdom is committed back to the father from the son and while they're yet speaking i'll answer before they can think i'll think for them that's right jesus will commit a perfect age to a perfect living god that he has redeemed and give over to the father is that right we'll turn to god the father which is spirit not a man a spirit all nature of goodness gathered together that's god so somehow jesus is going to be on that throne and he's going to commit he's maybe say something like this i commit this kingdom my kingdom back to my father the bible says he does that when all enemies are under his feet what a mystery right praise god isn't that the mystery of the godhead it's not so much sun and holy ghost or father and holy ghost it's more father and son the mystery of a son completely yielded to the father's spirit and he yields any he rules in such a way for those thousand years and after the white throne judgment that he can say i now put every enemy under me now i'm giving it back to the father hallelujah describe it impossible long for it every day praise god it's impossible to describe it but it's still reality the city with the throne and top revelation 21 23 and they need no light for the lamb and the lord god is the light thereof see the lord god is the pillar of fire that father the children of israel through the wilderness and he is ascended up on the throne in that perfect kingdom when the kingdom that jesus is surrendered to the father that god might be all and in all let's read in your bible i got your bible uh yeah i can put up here sorry first corinthians 15. been a while since i preached that let me preach it out there first corinthians 15. you ever wonder about that this i learned about the scripture for a long time then i heard a future home of the heavenly bridegroom i'm going to find it here write that one down there it is yeah go to verse 25 i'm sorry go to verse 24 then come at the end what is the end the end is where jesus gives the kingdom back to the father then come at the end when he shall deliver up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall put down all rule and all authority and power so that's right after the white throne judgment right death and hell are cast in lake of fire all the all the sinners are cast alive lake of fire after that after the future home comes then god then christ can commit it back to the father for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death for hath put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him it is manifest that he is expected which did put all things under him it is evident and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all so god only becomes all in all once jesus has put every enemy under his feet and saying father here i give the kingdom back to you now god is in all and is all praise god is that a mystery absolutely but the scripture says it's true amen jesus must rule until this moment and then he hands the kingdom back over to the father what's going to happen after that i don't know but i know it's going to be glorious that's all i know it's going to be pure joy pure peace pure love just the beauty pure beauty it's going to be just glorious yeah i had the scripture right there i didn't even need i didn't know that i forgot about that all right i'm just finished this is what's going to look like from outer space church brother william you could put this on a real estate page and that's going to be our home someday but it ain't for sale it's a free gift amen praise god that's our home praise god coming right out of zion right this is the new zion the heavenly zion come down to earth 1500 miles in the air and jesus will be at the top of course they don't have jesus right there that's a shame but maybe let's wait until the later part of his later part from the coming rain that's the new mount zion coming down from heaven one thousand five hundred miles is from maine to florida that's how wide this city is going to be one thousand five hundred it's the same it's the same height width and and depth it's one thousand five hundred miles all directions right so it's it's almost 1600 miles from the capital maine to florida it's a and this city is one thousand five hundred miles length that's a new city so that's about how big it will be on the on the that's like it's uh kind of like it's a ratio it's gonna be that big and guess what it's gonna cover over egypt brother all those idols and those devils there amen praise god hallelujah it's going to be no more praise god amen such a mighty city praise god the holy city praise god god shall not be mocked you and i live on one of those apartments in that city we got one of those apartments there i know mine is like right it's right by the edge because i'm just a little creature i'm just a nobody but thank god i'll be inside the walls amen thank god amen they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain oh god let me have an address there praise god lord make sure lord please remember me when you come into that kingdom praise god give me a home in that city praise god let's stand to our feet i better stop right there i could go a little bit more but i think i'll stop right there now church i told you my wife kind of joked with me to write a lyric to that song what i did
