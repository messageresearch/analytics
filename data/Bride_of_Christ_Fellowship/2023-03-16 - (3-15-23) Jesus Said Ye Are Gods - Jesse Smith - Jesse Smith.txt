TRANSCRIPT
========================================
10 34. and we'll read 35 as well there Keisha thank you we live then hunt Okay thank you God bless our live streamers there's only a few but God bless you most of them will be watching on the archive but praise the Lord maybe Vang or Jose or some other ones or live streaming here tonight by God's grace John 10 34 and 35. now of course Jesus is being accused of blasphemy by making himself God of course we know the scripture here but verse 34 says Jesus answer them is it not written in your law I said ye are gods if he called them Gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken say of him whom the father has Sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemeth here's why because I said I am the son of God so the context of this scripture is that someone is calling themselves the son of God okay so look at the context Jesus is saying I am the son of God now let's go to Romans 8 19 and I'd like to also preach on this here by God's grace it was titled ye are Gods by a subtopic I like to look at the manifestation of the sons of God Romans 8 19. you might as well read verse 18. that's a beautiful verse there too I think it'll encourage us here tonight by the grace of God as I was preaching on Sunday and if you've heard it before if you ever need an encouraging chapter Romans 8 is the chapter to read praise God starts off with there's no condemnation It Ends by saying nothing could say separate you from God's love Hallelujah I could just read that and we could all go home right we'd all be happy I don't have any condemnation nobody can take Jesus the love away from me right you could all leave and be happy but we'll preach a little more by God's grace Romans 8 9 18. for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time think of your sufferings that we go through are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US now let's read verse 19. one two three for the earnest expectation of the creature wadeth for the manifestation of the sons of God okay so we're speaking of a time when the glory will be revealed in us a future time all right if you have any need on your heart here let's raise it unto God let's have one more word of prayer for us third time we pray father God I Want to Thank You Lord we never pray enough Lord teachers we come to the portion of the word of God lord I've read your word I pray you just anoint me and father anoint your people to receive it and God we thank you for all your blessings we know we were we were born for such a time as this as Esther said Lord God here in 2023 Lord God we see the world and tumultuous conditions chaos all around but Lord yet we have stability in Christ Hallelujah we are loved nothing accelerate separate us from your love dear God we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ we want to thank you for that and Lord yet we come to you Lord with these needs father I pray God you ministered each of the needs in Jesus Christ's name and the saint said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God let's have a few slides I didn't get maybe all the slides done I like to do this you know when I started studying it this morning I thought well this would be a shorter subject maybe easier to study through but then I as I studied I I was I was surprised there was a little bit more than I thought so we'll get as far as we can here by God's grace so I want to start with this thought on ye are Gods here out of uh John chapter 10. so if you have your Bible let's head back there to John chapter 10. and I think the maybe the controversy with this is that you know some people will will actually declare we are gods and if someone's never heard that before they would initially think these people are deifying themselves right if you I mean how many people do you know that walk around and say well I'm a little God I'm I'm one of the Gods I mean I would think I would probably say you're crazy if somebody said that you belong in the insane institution and I'll go check you in uh but you know uh I was as I was studying this I was a I was very surprised that there's a couple of scriptures in the Old Testament that do call God's people gods there's actually a couple places um so we got to understand it and what we'll understand is that the word lowercase Gods now this should be a lowercase D so I do apologize I didn't think about that I was just thinking of titles you know you capitalize I actually taught that lesson today at school you have to capitalize the title so maybe that's why either way I think the kids got it but either way it's lowercase gods and the point is that this word God is the Hebrew word is Elohim right of course it means the Creator God the Eternal God but there are some definitions of that word uh that just mean judge or representative or Godlike it also can mean Angel I'll show there's lots of definitions for the word Elohim okay so uh so for us when Jesus would say you know ye are Gods whom the word of God would come to Jesus saying uh ye are Judges or you are representatives of God because the word of God comes to you the best word in the New Testament is the word ambassador so let's turn there while it's on my mind here so I don't forget I want to make sure I lay this in here second Corinthians five if you've got your Bibles here second Corinthians 5. let's lay this in here you are an ambassador for Jesus Christ that means you stand in the place of him you are bringing his message second Corinthians 5. and your message is reconciliation so we should look for opportunities Church in our lives to find people that would like to be reconciled to God most people were going to come in contact with are not reconciled to God they're distant from God their lives speak nothing of Holiness their lives speak nothing of Victory their lives don't speak of the Holy Ghost they speak of the Unholy spirit right the spirit of the world or the Antichrist Spirit even and so we have to look for opportunities and pray for opportunities God send us someone who is hungry for the word of God send us someone who wants to have peace with you praise God send someone who wants to be reconciled to God hallelujah so verse 17 just a very familiar scripture here on you know of course we love this verse therefore If any man be in Christ he's a new creature how many new creatures we have here tonight I'm a yeah I'm a brand new person because of Christ Hallelujah old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ so God thought what tool can I use to get Austin reconciled to me what what can I use to get Jesse reconciled to me he's a sinner he's he's dead in sins and he says I'll use my son Jesus Hallelujah so Jesus God becoming flesh a sacrifice God giving us a holy sacrifice the death of that sacrifice reconciled me back to God Hallelujah that sacrifice God thought what what could what could I do to to bring peace between a sinner and me what could I what could I do to bring unity and Reconciliation I'll use a sacrifice and so that's what God did God sent his son Jesus Christ and through our faith through the faith God gives us in Christ we're reconciled to God we're no longer fighting against God hallelujah we're fighting for God and God's fighting for us amen Hallelujah it may not be like it at times church but God is fighting for you the Bible says if God before us who can be against us praise God hallelujah God is fighting on your side amen God is fighting on your behalf praise God oh it's a great lesson it's a great reminder that we need and finishing Verse 18 has given to us the ministry of reconciliation so that's what we should do we should look to our friends and look for opportunities to reconcile them to God praise the Lord you know as I was preaching on Sunday I started preaching on cigarettes and and uh being married two or three times and then after the second service these two guys walk up to me and that's exactly what they were struggling with I didn't even know it and I had to I instruct them I said here's how I overcame to tobacco here's how I overcame these things what was I trying to do I'm trying to reconcile them to God I tell the brother you know don't marry again you've already been married once you've been living with another woman don't marry another woman don't do that now if they do they can still come to church like Billy Paul Branham right but there's no guarantees they're going to the rapture they're actually taking a big risk not to go in the rapture because the Bible said adulterers will not inherit the kingdom of God now of course we know they can be forgiven if they repent but it's very touchy situation it's a it's a very uh it's just not a very it's just it's a it's just an uncertain thing to do to purposely go against God's word right and break God's commands and then just hope for mercy that's a very dangerous thing to do we would just I would just say it's not a wise thing to do right right but that was that was the ministry even after service I like that even after preaching I still got to preach I still got to minister even after the church that's how it should be you know even after we Minister here we might Minister out there we got to be ready at all times so remember that our ministry is reconciling others to God how can I help my brother get reconciled to God how can I help my sister feel peace with God what can I do what can I say to bring peace with God the main thing is get rid of the sin question praise God because that's what we all battle you know I saved did God even loved me is God fighting against me and we can very easily solve that by pointing you to the word of God hallelujah Romans chapter 8 as I said amen and Romans 5 1 now we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah we just must repent of our sins and then the greatest battle ever fought has been won temporarily but the battle is going to come back amen but how many are ready to keep fighting praise God that's how Satan went you know Satan uh discourages people it's through the test of time right we'll go through some heavy battles we'll go through seasons of hard battles tough mind battles and then we'll get and then we'll get Victory and then it seems like just a few days later right then we got to start over mind battles again and then our backs kind of hunch like this again I gotta renew my mind again and we got we gotta say God give me some strength to raise those shoulders back praise God brother Brandon said that's what faith does faith throws his shoulders back and says I've got big must I've got big muscles of Faith praise God Hallelujah so we have to have an attitude of okay I know I'm going to go through Cycles I got to be willing to fight this again I can't get lazy come on church I can't get plate complacent on God I got to be willing to have a renewed mind I got to be willing to fight some more praise God Hallelujah I've got to get my mind right I got to get my mind back in fighting mode praise God not a pushover mode right and same thing for me I'm preaching to myself Amen brother Jesse or I should say Amen holy spirit because I'm no preacher that's about you Cam said great preacher I said brother Cameron I said you know there's no preacher but Jesus if anybody if anybody was blessed it was because Jesus was preaching praise God hallelujah ah so we see the ministry of reconciliation now now here's how he did verse 19 to win that is that means that is that is God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them how many can say praise the Lord God's not going to impute your trespasses to you because Christ already paid for them that ought to make somebody happy tonight praise God somebody I'll leave here happy it's going to be me I know that's for sure join me Hallelujah let the word of God make us happy not imputing their trespasses unto them in other words we won't get punished for what we've done Hallelujah and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation so that's what we should say Lord give me a word so somebody can be reconciled to God we know fewer and fewer will find it as time goes on uh Jesus said the the days have to be shortened so that some people are saved right if it went on nobody would even be saved so the days have to be short just to make sure people are saved now verse 20. now then we are ambassadors for Christ now that's the word their ambassadors okay we are standing in the place of Christ now we don't compare anything to him because we have no strength but his Spirit does anoint us amen we say through temporary times in our soul if we're born again it permanently anoints us but we're constantly fighting the battle of the Mind and we have to be humble and say you know uh like Jesus he did so many miracles you couldn't fill this room with books about him now your life my life you could probably build this could probably feel fill a Shelf with your testimonies right mine too right I could tell the stories and try to remember as many details I fit in a book yeah maybe two books depends how long the book is but you know we realize we are not the fullness of God Christ was a fullness of God he had the Holy Ghost without measure we've got it with measure but let's use all the measure that we got praise God Amen that's our prayer tonight God anointing the measure tonight so something can be accomplished tonight praise God whether it's strength or whether it's encouragement or repentance or Victory or healing Whatever It Is God anoint my measure tonight praise God use my measure tonight so God God can be glorified so somebody can be reconciled to God Amen they feel estranged from God they could be reconciled to God like that one sister after service you know we're just talking and she said brother Jesse I want to really appreciate you for that sermon she's like you are inside of my head and your whole sermon was like everything I've been thinking over the last few battles I said well I wasn't in your head I didn't think about you all week it was God that thought about you all week I haven't thought about you for a long time actually how did I get inside her head it wasn't me it was Jesus praise God because he's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart she was one weeping during the service and just praising God and thanking the lord for the encouragement that's brought so that's what we're to do we're supposed to use to reconcile people back to God Hallelujah now ambassador now actually I didn't look that up here recently let me just look it up real quick it should take like five seconds here so five four three two one okay here it is all right so Ambassador in the Greek means to be a senior that is a representative an ambassador so a representative right I'm a representative of Copley Fairlawn schools right our our children there are the school children our representatives of Coventry elementary school right Hallelujah your representatives of Smith Academy is that what they call you know wherever you work you're representative of your work and so we are representatives of Heaven praise God hallelujah we're Representatives because Jesus said pray let thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven praise God let it be done on Earth just like God's will like God wants it in heaven God sent us here in our church we always don't always do a great job of it but there are times people can see we're from Heaven praise God Amen there are times people can see there's a difference about you something's different about you God use you and God used you for reconciliation thank God amen hallelujah thank God for those opportunities we're sent to represent Jesus Christ we're set to represent the god of Heaven praise God I'm thankful for it amen I don't want to represent hell ought to represent Heaven Hallelujah that there's hope in heaven there's victory in heaven there's peace in heaven there's joy in heaven there's eternal life in heaven amen and I'm a representative of that thank God thank you Jesus verse 21 there's one of the best verses you ever want to memorize for he God has made Christ to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him we get Jesus's righteousness and he took our unrighteousness what a beautiful Divine exchange as we've said hallelujah what a great scripture so now just so you know this is my understanding if someone would say well you know brother so-and-so or sister and so but Jesus said you're Gods I would say yes but I don't like to use that word very much and you know why I don't like them give a good reason I'm going to give you a real good reason here because in the New Testament Paul never calls us gods right and Paul said we'll be judged by his gospel okay and again the more someone walks around saying they're a God if they don't show me some God in them I'm not going to believe them I'm going to think they're crazy I better be seeing you doing Supernatural things right casting out Devils Healing The Sick speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying I've ever seen a lot of that you walk around calling yourself a god so to me out of respect and humility I don't like to use the word God's that's why you never heard me preach a sermon on God's before Rachel have you ever heard me preach a sermon on gods I'll be really shocked if my hand goes up because I don't remember ever preaching a sermon on God's because I never have because I've never been I've never been comfortable with that type of language because you don't I just don't see in the New Testament very often now I know what the Bible says I'm going to show you what the Bible says and so I can go with it you know where the Bible says it but I don't want to Major on that and call myself a God because you hang around alone you're going to find out I'm really human as you know I'm really human right I don't so resemble so much of God and whatever reason whatever reason the King James version translators translated that as gods because it either means a judge or like God now Church in one way you are like God because you're in the image of God amen right you have a mind you can speak you can build right you can do things you can create things now create really you don't really create it right you you don't really create anything right we say create an atmosphere but really not the really one creating it like it's the holy spirit that does it right like we just yield to the Holy Spirit to create an atmosphere so my reasoning behind this that not using the gods so much is because I want to remain humble right and I don't see Paul you know saying well call yourself Gods uh he doesn't write a letter you know peace from God our Father to all the gods that are at laodicea like we don't we just we don't read that in the Bible you know oh to all the gods that are in the city of Corinth or the in colossae like you don't see Paul using that he calls them saints amen hallelujah that's what I believe I got here tonight there's Saints here tonight there's ones that are separated for God's purpose your ambassadors your God's Representatives you're trying to reconcile people to God Amen okay so I hope that's kind of like my introduction there and nobody can say well brother Jesse preached a sermon he already preached before I've never preached this here before so I know you never say that but people online or whatever they I've never preached on this before now here's here's our text here Jesus says uh you know they're getting they're upset with them saying Oh you blasphemed he said doesn't even your law your law say you are gods and now why do they call them Gods because the word of God came to them right and then when Jesus interprets this he says I'm the son of God this is his interpretation now I don't know if he knew this but Jesus was actually quoting psalm 82. so you don't have to have your Bibles there like I said I'm not sure how long this is going to be I forgot to set my timer so let me do 30 minutes because I've already got 15 minutes in now uh Psalm 82 1-2 a Psalm of asaph God standing in the congregation of the mighty he judgeth among the gods and this is Old Testament hallelujah how long will you judge unjustly now look he calls him unjust judges and except the persons of the wicked say Lao which means meditate on that and that's something no if you just go not skip verses three through five go to verse six I have said ye are gods and all of you are children look at this of the most high so do we have scripture where All God's Children Are Gods yes we have scripture on that but not a lot of them just a couple okay now look he calls him Gods but then he says but ye shall die like men so of course Israel must be in some type of state of rebellion here and fall like one of the princes he said your Gods but you're going to fall like princes arise oh God now here's the real God right that's the real God right there arise oh God judge the Earth for Thou shalt inherit All Nations what's that speaking of the millennium okay so see all the children of God are called gods okay in a few places but again I don't recommend you walk around saying I'm hey I'm a God I'm a God Jesus said I'm a God I want to walk around saying that that's uh Jesus did you know we don't see Paul telling us to do that you know because pride gets in there let me share this here I've listened to a lot of message preachers I love most they're preaching but they're really majoring on these quotes where brother Braham says she is him there's actual quote where brother man said the bride is Christ she is him in church that's getting close to idolatry like you know they're making they're making us equal to Christ now in one way we have the spirit of Christ but we don't make ourselves completely equal because we don't have the fullness of the godhead bodily and they major and these are the same people again that are calling themselves the greatest of all time I know you've sat through it heard me preach many sermons on doctrines of devils and I appreciate your love and your compassion I do appreciate that I hope you I know you enjoyed them I know nature enjoyed them she said they were the best sermons you ever heard that might have changed since then but that really encouraged me but the point is the same people that are calling themselves the greatest are now they're just quick quick to say you're the we're the message they're saying and we are him we are him well you're representatives of him you're anointed by him but not always now the trouble is they act like they're always anointed when they're not let me give you two simple examples let me remind you of two we're coming up on the one year anniversary of a famous message preacher who has tremendous Miracles tremendous testimonies but he said we're just hours away from the Rapture because of the war in Ukraine we're coming up on a year that's a lot of hours in 365 days and then the week later he said we're just days away from the Rapture now here we are now look here we are a year later is anyone holding him accountable no they're just still loving him and no one's no one's trying to correct him so see when you get to that spot I'm the greatest of all time you're not afraid to just say whatever you want and then nobody checks up on you because they got the same Spirit you got Pride it's a prideful spirit right but doesn't the Bible say prove all things as they prove some things or prove all things prove all things so see you just you got to watch it and Churchill if you got the Holy Spirit you'll start Discerning these things too right you'll start watching like I remember when sister Naomi told us about how uh people gifted a pastor like a Mercedes-Benz or whatever car it was now Church people ought to know something's wrong with that that would have fly up red flags amen right when the nation's full of poor people or whatever that ought to float float some red flags and that doesn't seem very humble doesn't seem like Christ was Christ riding around in a Mercedes-Benz or for that day would have been a horse and buggy or like a gold horse and buggy like Solomon did no Christ was humble and nobody was better than Christ but see you just you start watching and here's the more red flags you see the more you okay watch these people just like with that Pastor that left at uh a Lima a number of years ago Jeff Jenkins well he let them cut their hair the whole time you let them wear makeup the whole time uh he taught wrong on the baptism of the Holy Ghost I mean he made fun of brother Brooks for the way he worshiped and uh and they were too emotional he said they're too emotional I had I had like seven or eight things doctrines he was wrong on so it was no surprise when he left a message right but you got to watch him the Bible said Mark them that caused divisions praise God contrary to the doctrine that you've heard I don't know how I got to all know that but anyways I guess God knows anyways we don't want to walk around saying I'm God and I am him you're an ambassador for him if you're an ambassador for the White House you don't go around saying well I'm Joe Biden no you no you say I'm a representative of the White House right right that's what a representative do represent representative doesn't steal somebody's personality that's what these message people are doing trying to but then they don't even act like Jesus they're not humble like Jesus right and then they pronounce people are going to be healed and then they die that's not what Jesus did see they get so prideful and lifted up well I'm a God and I'm gonna they are these sermons I'm anointed I'm a messiah I'm a crater well sometimes you are but not all the time and I'm not trying to discourage us from having faith I want you to have faith but if God's in it God's going to move praise God and church and if we say something don't come to pass we just got to apologize praise God and my and make it right you are God's okay now here's the here's what I was talking about the word Gods is Elohim and of course that's the word for God this is the word for Lord now see some of the the only definition that makes sense here in in the children of God you are Gods is your rulers or judges that's the only one now you can say Divine ones as far as uh the anointings in your mind you know you have the Divine Holy Spirit in your mind or now in the New Testament now it's in your soul you can make a you can make a case for that but you can't make a case in the New Testament for people walk around saying I'm God I'm one of the Gods you just can't make that you can't make that where Paul says I'm in prayers often I'm fasting often I'm hungry often I'm in beatings often well where if he was such a God why wasn't he just knocking down the prison walls or whatever breaking the chains well I'm a God I'll just walk right out of here you know no he can only do that when the angel was there so we don't want to get this Spirit of pride and arrogance that comes with false teaching that's why I haven't preached it for 17 years I've been Pastor actually 19 years I've been preaching I haven't reaching her in 19 years until tonight almost 20 years of reaching I've never I just never touched a subject because I knew what went along with it now here's a different concordance I don't know I guess there must be two strong concordance I'd like to look at that one out in the brother Stephen gave us out there I never looked at that one but anyways this is a really good one here's what it says Elohim it can be plural right can be plural God's in an ordinary sense so like false gods now here's where it is occasionally this word is applied by the way of deference to magistrates or judges or rulers again so someone with a lot of authority they would call him a Elohim right but we would pray o Elohim we worship you remember all those names I can't remember all of them I've reached a long time ago Elohim all the seven compound Redemptive names of Christ amen but Elohim is occasionally now this word Elohim has used over 2600 times and only a few are applied to men or children of God men are women okay so just so you know so this word sometimes and look it's used for angels too as we said it's used for Angels judges Mighty people right Mighty Men got mighty men and women out there praise God Paul said the the gospel Works in me mightily praise God that's what he said the gospel worked in Paul mightily Hallelujah now here's another one you remember this one Saul's last second last day on Earth he went to the witch of Endor and he said can you call them up and he called him up she called him up the king senator be not afraid for what saw us down the woman said I saw I saw God's ascending up out of the Earth in other words rulers magistrates Prophets not only did Samuel come up somebody else came up out of there I wonder who it was he only called for Samuel but more than one came up I can't explain that other than the blood of Jesus Christ wasn't shed yet like brother Brown said and they had access somehow that that witch had access to souls because there was no blood to cover them over they had animal blood that's all I can say I know I get a good question on that on Sunday I'm sure Sunday night I'll get a real good question about that so the off study up this week okay probably gonna come from Haven or nature one of those smart people out there you are smart very yeah Simon and cam were really impressed by all the questions children yeah we're really impressed like Barbara Jess you got some hard questions I know tell me about it most ready to ask for a vacation and here's another one you'd be familiar with and the Lord said unto Moses see I have made thee a God to pharaoh he didn't make him a co-equal person that'd be good for the trinitarians he made him a ruler or judge to pharaoh or he made him one like God in other words God gives you the word right and the word is backed up like anything God says God's Gonna back up so Moses became God he got the word he gave it to Aaron and Aaron gave it to pharaoh in other words he had thus saith the Lord he had power in his word so he was Godlike doesn't mean Moses was perfect right because not long after this he struck the rock said you bunch of rebels look at me and God said you met you glorified yourself now based upon this here's here's what I'm trying to say Jesus use this verse to say I am the Son of God so we can use that verse to say I'm a Son of God or or I'm a daughter of God and the church said it's okay to say that it's okay I'm a daughter of God God's my father I'm a son of God but I'm not saying I'm the son of God that's blasphemy right but if I just said I am a Son of God and not brother also and not in the future I'm going to be a Son of God I already am a son of God because John said behold what manner of love look at this what manner of love has God bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knows us not because it knew him now that's why nobody wants that's why the Sinners don't like talking to you they don't like being around you they don't even know who you are they can't even begin to understand who you are and sometimes I like being alone of the world so I don't mind being involved by myself out in the world because I don't want to be bothered with their wickedness beloved now so I'll tell them like brother Austin there right now Austin you are now a son of God but amen now you are a son of God I'll call all the men out tonight Malachi's almost a man Malachi now you're the son of God and it does not appear what we shall be like we can't see the the glorified body but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is amen as soon as we'll see him we'll have a body just like him amen now I'm a son of God am I perfect no but I know my father's still proud of me amen praise God because I've got peace with God Amen he's forgiving me right he can't love me any less yes he has to spank me I said chasing me has to correct me yes rebuke me but that doesn't mean he doesn't love me praise God that actually proves he does love me Hallelujah so see the very best we can say if someone said well brother Jess or brother amen Jesus said you're Gods I would say well I would say I'm a son of God I'm not going to walk around and said I'm one of the Gods now you're getting the video game kind of movie kind of stuff you know the war of the Gods that's I personally I just you know for me I'd rather refrain from using that word I'd rather use Ambassador or I'm a server I'd rather I say that I'm a servant of God I'm a Son of God I'm one of his sons one of the many sons and I'm the least of the least but I'm one of them praise God I know Brian kept saying that he's like brother he's I'm just the Lisa Lisa I said well you're wrong on that I am you're wrong I'll have to tell them that tonight he kept saying that I'm Elisa Lisa I said no sir you're wrong I I call that first now here's the only time that a believer's call to God in the New Testament look it up I challenge you look it up I looked up today you remember the story Pawn uh Barnabas do this amazing Miracle right the people saw what they done they lift up their voices and they said the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men your Mercury and Zeus or Hercules or whatever they say you know the different ones which when they heard it did they say yes I am one of the Gods is that what they said no they said I'm a man with passions just like you I'm no different than you God just used me God just spoke through me God just said his virtue through me praise God right virtue he just sent the pot the healing power he sent it through me but I'm not I'm nothing special I'm no God I'm not now he went Paul had scripture I came out of the mind of Christ he had scripture he could have said well no I am a God I came out of the mind of Christ I was chosen in Christ before the foundation world he could have used that but he didn't why because they wanted to worship them and no real Christian will take worship from anybody right they may be tempted but they'll overcome how do you do these things we're men we're just men we got passions like you've got to turn from your vanities to the Living God that's the one time Christians were called gods in the New Testament if I'm not I'm saying like this with love with all the love in my heart check me church just check me honestly check me that's what I told the Saints and Napoleon if you're struggling getting further away from God then you got to have something you study every day you got to find a topic to study you got to keep your mind on the word of God it's like for me uh what was I studying the other day oh the seventh seal so I gave all my mornings I just studied the seven seal Seven Seals I got some good sermons coming up on that too I'm just kidding I mean I couldn't reach out you probably heard most of it before but you just got to do that you got to keep your mind on the word if not you're gonna get distracted if you're not studying God's word what are you gonna you're gonna study something right and studying cookbooks is okay studying for your Taekwondo test is okay right milk I mean you got it we're living on this Earth we've got to do things like that but I'm saying overall you got to make sure your attitude is I'm hungry for more of God's word by a journal I'll give you one like I buy the kids those notepads I'll give you a two dollar notepad praise God you go home and you just study every day just write down just study the topic keep your mind on God's word that's how you keep it fresh remember the Bible says they that meditate on God it's a the Bible said it's a tree of life to them I say I just preached that fear of the Lord's sermon so it's fresh in my mind if you meditate on God it's a tree of life to you because you're fearing God you're keeping the Commandments you're taking notes on God's word it's life to you it's like a stream the Bible said the fear Lord like a stream and then it feeds the the tree and the tree puts forth wisdom praise God hallelujah amen oh and this is a nice testimony one of the families uh one of the families out there is Derek's family um so Derek's mother-in-law is 82 years old and they were praying that uh they said they've been praying her for her for 20 years to accept Christ and finally she accepted Christ I think she moved from California or something all the way to Napoleon just to receive Christ and she said she come up the first thing she said she said I love your YouTube videos she said I watched all your videos on the Book of Revelation that's 22 videos and and her her daughter's like yes after the first one she's like I could actually understand that that was so simple I could understand it and she said I want another and they got done with the first one second one she said I want to watch another and so she spent the next two days watching all my videos on the Book of Revelation and she's going to be baptized on April 1st by God's grace so you never know where your influence is going to go right brother says like that rock drop it in the pond your food's just going to go out right so just love Jesus testify do good to other people give alms fast pray and your influence is going to spread out now uh we have this principle you know when people call themselves Gods we must remember I don't really don't agree with that you know I mean I could agree with some of the verses but I don't think it's a good process to go around or good practice to go around calling yourself a god because the principle is there's only one God and God Alone gets the glory okay and so that's very very simple Deuteronomy 32 39 see now that I even I am he and there's no God with me so see well you say I'm one of the Gods well God said there's no other gods with me you see it's not something God people are trying to make themselves out to be like I'm all-powerful and I've got so much power I've got so much Authority only the authority God gives you right I kill I make alive I wound I heal neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand Isaiah 42 8 I am the Lord that is my name and my glory will I not give to another neither my praise to graven images okay praise God all right so we can plainly see that now that's why I've always been careful on this topic I think that's the best word to say now let's look at a few of these quotes now in in these quotes you'll see brother Raymond I've known the I've heard these quotes oh many times over the years brother random brings out the fact that Jesus is talking about prophets the word of God comes to Prophets okay and that's what Jesus was talking about uh like with with Moses was a God to Pharaoh okay because the word of God came to Moses All right but also at the same time we got to keep in mind that these verses brother Ram uses about the Holy Spirit anointing people are legitimate right and God does want to anoint us sometimes to do great things but the trouble is people that read brother random sermons many of them are not born again and they'll take a they'll take a a quote he makes and they'll make it a false Doctrine like she is him I mean that's true in one sense but not the sense they're saying I'm the greatest of all time well you just you just Twisted the quote the wrong way that's not what brother Brandon was talking about now but God especially upon Adam breathe the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with God he had power like God he was an amateur God now I forgot the word amateur I looked that up earlier uh it was actually kind of a funny definition an amateur gods let me look it up here real quick you should only take 10 seconds amateur okay so amateur means uh one who engages as a Pastime but not as a profession so someone who's not a professional at something as someone who lacks experience and competence well if he's an amateur God then he he lacks experience as God he's not as competent as God as God as competent as God that's a mouthful he was God of the earth not God Of Heaven now God of the earth and someday the sons of God will again become Gods now I believe that because the Bible says that there's going to come a time when we are way better than the condition now that we are right now by God's grace Glory church I'm coming to a condition where I'm not going to sin again amen oh God hastens the day Hallelujah I won't get old I won't get tired I can walk through walls I can't right now because I'll bump up into the wall but you're going to get a glorified body that can walk right through walls praise God it can vanish it can appear to another place think of that a thousand years we'll have bodies that can just vanish from the North American area I don't know there won't be Seas I'm not sure how that works we can go to another place look at that for a thousand years brother what are we going to do brother for a thousand years what are we gonna do taking care of these heathens around here what are we going to do with glorified bodies someday we will be as those Gods because we'll never sin again we'll be judges we'll be judges we'll be rulers over the whole Earth that's what the Bible says that's the promise for the overcomer Jesus said so it's not written in your law your gods that if you can call them whom he called God who God visited how can you condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God see now we're getting into something deep now watch this when we drive it down now another quote he's talking about again about Adam he talks about how the real seed of God absorbs the spirit like a seed needs water absorbed right all the nominations took out of it all in belief is out and when the Holy Spirit comes to that German life is laying there it produces another seed just exactly another Son of God is born amen another amateur God a son of God oh yeah here's the word I was looking for uh the word amateur means a dabbler see I I dabble with trying to fix things at my house I'm no professional I've tried to fix the sink numerous times I think I might only fix it one time I'm just dabbling under there how do I get I was just lucky to change the tire we had a flat tire the other day I was just lucky to change the tire I was like thank you Lord actually change the tire I could not have done without maokai hold the flashlight I'm just a dabbler I'm just an amateur I'm not a professional but you come to first grade there I'm a professional people pay me for that I take a lot of classes to become a good teacher I'm a professional I can do that better than most people unless you've been paid to do it right you've learned how to do it right that's just how it is like amen's professional I couldn't do his job without all the training but here we're just dabbling Ah that's what the Bible says the Bible said we see through a glass Darkly oh brother just had this real spiritual experience you're still just seeing through a glass Darkly yeah because give it a week and let's see if you're still on mountaintop here let's see Hallelujah let's see let's give it a couple weeks and let's see how you're doing spiritually that's what I found look we danced we had all those great Services now look what's happening we're going through some trials now God allows them to keep us humble and to teach us to keep praising God in the midst of the storm right see we can't remain on the mount you can't live on the Mountaintop I wish we could I really do manifested the works manifested the same same by US versus the same word now if you want to do the works of Christ do the same thing he's he done he that believeth on me shall have my Works what is it believeth what that he's the Original Seed germ that come Christ is the seed of God that come right he's a true Son of God the son of God here's another one to talk about Adam as long as Adam made from the Tree of Life he had eternal life in the blue and we'd again notice Adam he inherit the earth he was like an amateur God over the Earth the Earth was his everything was given unto his hand he could do whatever he wanted with it he named it now look at that he named it he called it the animals and done whatever he wanted he was truly a son of God okay now then what it attitude he forfeited it and now Satan becomes a lowercase God of this world now that's what the rest of that's about Adam had the keys right Adam had the power of the authority well he was overcome and whoever overcomes you takes your keys that's what happened now Satan is a God of this world the ruler the judge I remember maybe not not in a spiritual sense but he just has control over the governments right he's a ruler of the governments Jesus said so Jesus didn't rebuke him when he said that see man was made to be a God to be a god did you know that he's in the image of God he's the son of God he's like him in other words God made us to be god-like okay he was given a domain Genesis 1 26 dominion over the whole earth that's right he Ruled the Earth he ruled the animal kingdom and all the other kingdoms all the kingdom all but the kingdom of God above he was God he was an amateur God he was made the image of God made like God and had hands and feet like God of course God's invisible so that's he must have met theophany he was in the image of God what happened because he disbelieved God's word I sent him right back out to shift for himself now God's trying to get him back when you have faith in accepting my brother just let that little light begin to grow out taking all the roots of doubt and bitterness yielding yourself to the spirit then you'll be begin to become a Son of God a daughter of God begin to grow in the grace of God the Holy Spirit begins to build his kingdom within you praise God oh thank God Amen thank God we don't have to go anywhere to join the kingdom Jesus sends the Kingdom right into you praise God hallelujah thank God Jehovah Jireh 61. now again it goes over Genesis 1 26 where Adam would speak he'd say Be Still he'd speak to the uh the winds and everything and in the garden and all the world's groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God waiting for the church to get back in its right place sons of God to be made manifest waiting for that hour hope that don't hurt but I just had to say it the church is so far away from its place it needs me back to be sons and of God again now here's where he says look rulers governors of the Earth under the spiritual Reign it will be someday when the chief one comes Jesus Christ the great Millennium Nature's groaning for that day now go take your Bible go back to Romans 8. this is the right interpretation I believe of this verse Romans when I say 8 19. and I think I mentioned this in the Bible study about three weeks ago usually it's rare I'm out two Sundays in a row how many how many think that's pretty rare that's super rare I'm hardly ever out two in a row but the way it worked out I felt like it was a love of the Lord no to me this is the right interpretation of the manifestation of the sons of God now the reason I have to preach this is because some people will take some of these quotes from Brother random and say uh we'll see when right before the Rapture we're going to become these manifested sons of God and all the Earth just wants us to to speak whatever we need before the rapture like I'll speak somebody's arm to grow back or I'll I'll speak just amazing things well that could be but in this context that's not what it's about this context is about the millennium and here's the proof listen to me if the manifested sons of God is what the Earth is groaning for well then the Earth is going to be sorely disappointed because right after Rapture the Earth is going to get destroyed and the church said to the Earth so the Earth is just groaning for you know whatever time of the latter rain and then it's going to get destroyed it's not groaning for that it's groaning for a brand new creation amen it's growing where the whole sin every all the wickedness gets burned up and we get a fresh start again praise God it's a new heavens and the new Earth praise God that's what it's groaning for it's not groaning for a third of the men to spill their blood on the earth that's not what the Earth is groaning for is that groaning for a third of the oceans that turn to blood and see how the animals wash up on shore because they're dead for drinking in the blood or whatever how that however that happens passes through their bodies that's not what the Earth is groaning for the Earth is guarding for a brand new start praise God the Earth is groaning for a ruler over the Earth who rules with the rod of iron and his name is Jesus Hallelujah that's what it's groaning for amen a holy ruler now verse 20 Romans 8 20. for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God now look Nature has to be delivered out of corruption but the Earth is going to be corrupted and ruined in the tribulation period so the manifestation of the sons of God is when the earth gets a new start we get a new body there's no more destruction and it's all Victory praise God Amen the millennium see context is always King they say context is key verse 22 for we know that the whole creation groaned and travailed in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the verse words of the spirit even ourselves grow what are we groaning for our church waiting for what the adoption to it the Redemption of our body this is speaking of either the Rapture right well speaking definitely the rapture that's what we're groaning for creation's groaning for a time when there's no more Wars no more destruction we're groaning for a new body and the older you get the more you groan enjoy it Malachi and Lydia enjoy that enjoy the teen years they sure don't last long true though they don't last long what are we groaning for a brand new body so this is speaking of the rapture okay okay I think I'll stop right there yeah we'll stop right there okay so the context is the millennium we get a new body the Earth has no more suffering the the creation will not groan anymore all right and I'm about an hour here so let me try to close here let's see here uh let me see I got one let me X out of this real quick so many quotes I got I don't know if I should quote you to life or not here let's see okay see sometimes I just don't know how to uh let me let me close it this here I'm going to close here okay so this is the reasons why you've never heard me say come on Church we're gods or something like that I just that's not my that's not my understanding I don't hear Brother I am saying that a lot right where you see it is all this uh they call it the new Apostolic Reformation it's like the Kenneth Copeland's Of The World the Benny hens uh Even Rick Joyner they call it the NR or any Nar or something like that um who's the Bethel guy again Bill Johnson okay all these famous preachers right they call them I mean they'll just take the liberty and say we're gods and you know the one guy says we've got the one guy from Bethel said we all have the mantle of William Branham now think of that well when are you going to start Discerning all the thoughts when are you going to start a prayer line that's why I told Joseph Joseph when are you going to start a prayer line brother Graham said Joseph's going to get double times double of everything that I got I said well I'm still waiting for that first prayer line double times double means times four so Joseph has to do four times the prayer lines that brother Bram did you better get started you're 1665. you better get started pretty soon see you can't make every quote thus saith the Lord that's just a father's desire I want to see my son and have more than my I mean that's what I want I want malachite to do a better job preaching than I do but he might not be a preacher right but in my own human desires uh well I hope Zion is a better preacher than I am God help him there's no thou saith Lord behind it then we're just we're just expressing our human thoughts we're not creating anything there it is brother brother Brown couldn't create Joseph doing four times the amount of prayer prayer lines as he did see because we don't we can't create whatever we want all we can do is be positive and hope for the best we have to wait for the Holy Spirit to come amen now look I prayed I said God give me a son in my own image and look God gave me one that's one time God did hear me people tell me that all the time your son looks just like you I said that's so sad for him I should not have prayed that why did I curse my son I'm just kidding buddy I love you that's one time God did hear my prayer so these are the reasons why I've never I've never majored on this I don't see Paul you or Peter or James or anyone Jude saying oh you're a bunch of gods I just don't that's not the language that you they say your servants were Sons were Saints okay so that's why I never major on that scripture John 10 34. I believe it I believe it there's times God calls us gods but he doesn't mean I'm we're co-equal now there's even let me just share this now there's even a false Doctrine going around the message church is that in the bride will be the fullness of the godhead bodily think of that I've heard prominent message preachers think of that just think for a moment here brother bear says think real deep on these things that's what he says I have a quote on that think real deep the fullness of the godhead bodily will be in the bride at the Rapture I've heard prominent preachers say that doesn't Jesus have the fullness of the godhead bodily in him what's he gonna do take it out of his body and put it in all the bride members he'd have to do that what about the fullness of God in all the saints that have already died what he's going to do take the Holy Ghost off them and put it on us you see how it makes no sense it makes no sense and the people will amen and they'll get 4 000 views and I don't care about the views I'm just saying like this is what people swallow they don't even they don't even think about it just because a preacher says who has great testimonies and I appreciate testimonies I love thank God God did it thank God but they won't even they won't even think about these things they'll say the fullness of the God in it will be in The Bride of the rapture not true it's not true we're going to have a great anointing of the Holy Ghost we're going to have a Reign the Bible says let's use let's use the Bible words amen Hallelujah for me Bible Believers let's believe the Bible let's quote the Bible praise God Hallelujah I'm just that I just laugh because I'm joyful praise God because I know where I'm standing I prayed enough I've studied enough I've laid before God enough I've wept enough I've sought God enough where I know where I'm standing praise God that's what I want you to do too I want you to seek God enough where you know where you're standing Jesus said make sure that no man can deceive you that's what Jesus said so you better study yourself approved praise God all right second reason you know we could use gods for both prophets and all the children of God according to Psalm 82 but let's remain humble and I don't want to cause people to stumble because if I say I'm a god brother Austin and then somebody watching me do something good or somebody gets saved or someone gets healed or someone gets blessed or something and then they watch me sin now that looks really awful because I just exalted myself and then I fell short of what I was confessing now yes I want a positive confession yes I want I want to speak God's word I want to be creative I mean I want to believe God's word but I don't want to stumble people like that well Jesse did that so what is Christianity even mean anything he said he's a god that's why I'd rather say I'm just a humble like brother I'm a humble servant saved by grace I am a sinner Say by grace yes I'm a son of God but I'm going to remain humble because Pride goes before the fall Pride goes before the fall and I'm a man just like you a woman or whatever you're like you're subject to the passions of this world right sometimes we give into passions we shouldn't give into right and also this uh the manifestation of the sons of God um there's some quotes I didn't get to but um some of them have been preached by preachers without a clear context of what brother Brown's talking about like Joel there's a scripture in Joel where the Bible says the army of God will leap over a wall and I don't know if that applies to the Jews or the Gentiles now Church think about the book of Acts Church we're going back to the book of Acts did they ever jump over a wall can anybody find me a verse in the book of Acts where they jumped over a wall I don't think so they turn the word upside down though they turn the walls upside down spiritually it's a seed though and they'll make these claims and then they'll make claims like in the squeeze we're going to jump over buildings and see they got a verse that they think they can use but how do you know that applies that way so see I want to be very careful I don't want to promise you something that I don't know is going to come to pass praise God that's why I there's quotes brother Branham says oh yeah he says I and they're good quotes I mean I feel he said I feel so encouraged I feel like I could run through a troop and jump over a wall I mean that's he's quoting the scripture I'm I'm thankful he would felt he felt inspired like that but we better be careful how we apply that to our lives Hallelujah and so so sometimes quotes or sometimes they're they're just or sometimes scripture is just vaguely applied to the latter rain or vaguely applied to the Rapture without a clear interpretation of it so again I believe some of these things are possible but we're not certain right people that ask me that all the time what's going to happen at the Rapture what's going to happen with the squeeze I don't know I don't know all the details I just know what the Bible says praise God so I just want to be careful and again the the groaning part remember the groaning part the creation's groaning not I don't believe for the Rapture I believe creation is groaning for the millennium because then there will be no more suffering in nature okay how many sons and daughters of God we got out there all right let's stand to our feet I'm gonna stop right there praise God preach over about an hour and a half musicians can come hour and 15. so that's a good start maybe I'll pick up on that on Sunday by God's grace how many enjoyed that message tonight now it's just a start in terms that's the thing I like we have these needs in our church we have sick people you know we have I don't want to discourage your faith but I don't also don't want you to have fake faith now the course I didn't get to is brother Adam says see Jesus said you're a God and he said speak to the mountain it'll move now I believe that I've spoken to a couple different situations and God moved but I did it one time and it did it or twice and it didn't move because it was just my emotion I said I'm sorry I said Lord I'm sorry because Church what are we doing we're looking through a glass Darkly we're just doing the best we can now you can stop the live stream
