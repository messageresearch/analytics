[0:46] meeting him for quite a few years and
[0:49] always enjoyed to see him
[0:51] work well or had car trouble this
[0:53] morning
[0:54] and weren't able to be with us it's sure
[0:56] good to see you tonight
[0:59] god would allow us to meet up again real
[1:01] soon
[1:03] chosen time hebrews chapter 12.
[1:06] amen i want to begin with the 25th verse
[1:12] you may have it say amen amen amen
[1:14] amen we read this it says see
[1:17] that ye refuse not him that speaketh
[1:20] for if they escape not who refused him
[1:23] to speak that's fake on earth
[1:25] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[1:28] away from him that speaketh from heaven
[1:30] whose voice then shook the earth
[1:33] but now he has promised saying yet once
[1:35] more i shake not the earth only but also
[1:38] heaven
[1:39] and this word
[1:41] amen this word yet once more signifies
[1:44] the removing of those things that are
[1:46] shaken
[1:47] that as the as of the things that are
[1:50] made that those things which cannot be
[1:52] shaken may remain what what's the what
[1:54] does the removing of the shakeable
[1:56] things the word of all might amen the
[1:58] word of almighty god wherefore we
[2:00] receive a kingdom there's our word again
[2:02] that's not to leave we receive a kingdom
[2:05] which cannot be moved let us have grace
[2:08] whereby we may serve god acceptably with
[2:10] reverence and godly fear for our god
[2:14] our god is
[2:15] a consuming
[2:17] amen
[2:19] amen hallelujah
[2:22] amen
[2:23] i just want to read one more spot and
[2:24] then just kind of
[2:26] debate on whether to put this scripture
[2:28] in here but the lord just needs me to
[2:30] put it in here right now matthew 7
[2:32] chapter verse 24
[2:34] matthew 7 24
[2:37] whosoever heareth these sayings of mine
[2:39] and do with them
[2:40] i will liken him unto a wise man which
[2:43] build his house upon a rock
[2:45] we know the prophet god teaches that
[2:46] rock is a type of revelation
[3:00] hallelujah
[3:03] [Music]
[3:04] amen
[3:06] and everyone that heareth these sayings
[3:07] almighty doeth them not shall be likened
[3:09] unto a foolish man which built his house
[3:11] upon the sand
[3:13] and the rains descended the floods came
[3:15] and the wind blew and beat upon that
[3:17] house and it fell
[3:19] and great
[3:20] was the fall of it yes and then the
[3:22] house fell because it was built upon the
[3:25] wrong revelation that's right and then
[3:27] the house fell because someone heard the
[3:28] word and didn't heed the word amen he
[3:32] said
[3:32] this is them that speaketh we've heard
[3:35] one speak from heaven in our day and
[3:36] then let's not refuse them to have
[3:38] spoken hallelujah heavenly father once
[3:41] again we approach you this evening where
[3:43] god asks that you would just take
[3:44] complete control father move me out of
[3:46] the way lord amen once again guard my

[3:57] amen just speak through other words that
[3:59] would encourage this little portion of
[4:01] the body of christ as we see the day
[4:03] approaching the day that we're living
[4:04] that's jesus there's so many people

[5:44] it trying to creep its way back into the
[5:46] believers in the message of the hour
[5:48] yeah and it it alarming to me and i saw
[5:51] some things that i didn't like and i
[5:53] just felt led to lead i felt led to
[5:55] preach this thought in our whole church
[5:57] and uh i just believe it was received
[5:59] well and i pray that it's received well
[6:01] tonight amen we find out over in the in
[6:04] the bible amen that a lot of people
[6:07] we've heard a voice spoke from heaven
[6:09] today how many believe we've heard a
[6:10] voice speak from heaven today amen amen
[6:12] a lot of people don't believe that that
[6:14] was the voice of god that spoke from
[6:15] heaven
[6:16] he said whose voice then shook the earth
[6:18] but once more he signifies the shaking
[6:20] that's taking place a voice that's
[6:22] spoken in our day
[6:24] amen let's not refuse that voice that
[6:26] we've heard speak from heaven in our day
[6:28] how many believes that the prophet of
[6:29] god come the voice of god
[6:31] spoke to us that man right from heaven
[6:33] right from heaven's gate god spoke
[6:35] through that man's lips amen amen and
[6:37] spoke truth to us in this day so so many
[6:40] people say well our our church is we
[6:43] don't believe quite the way you do
[6:45] our church doesn't quite think you have
[6:47] to do these things and our church thinks
[6:48] it's okay if you do those things but
[6:50] we've been delivered from all that once
[6:52] let's not get let's not let that world
[6:54] pull us back into those things that god
[6:56] has delivered hallelujah
[6:58] amen since you know we find out amen
[7:00] that they these people in the message
[7:03] even some people in the message circle
[7:05] starting to lean back to the things that
[7:07] god has delivered us from right god has
[7:09] taken us out of them but yet we see amen
[7:11] the dress start to slip in our women
[7:15] we see the things that people start to
[7:17] do start to creep back in that the
[7:19] prophet of god has delivered us the word
[7:21] of god through the prominent god has
[7:22] delivered us from yes we see those
[7:24] things start to and when you when you
[7:26] bring that up
[7:28] and then you become unpopular that's
[7:29] right you bring that up people say well
[7:31] you know why they didn't because they
[7:33] wanted like we said this point they're
[7:34] wanting to satisfy this old flesh man
[7:36] right that's right to satisfy this old
[7:38] guy because it makes me feel good to do
[7:40] those things or go to those places or or
[7:42] to you or to have people think that i
[7:44] look a certain way i look good like this
[7:46] and then like our sisters you know so
[7:48] many times the sister's been delivered i
[7:50] thank god but i see holy ghost-filled
[7:52] sisters here yes you know you go to some
[7:54] circles there are messy circles and you
[7:56] see that that that straining at the bit
[7:59] you see that pulling back to those
[8:00] things of the world those sins that
[8:02] we've been delivered from right the
[8:04] prophet of god has told us it's spoken
[8:07] our day how to be delivered from these
[8:09] things man we see it trying to creep its
[8:10] way back in among us
[8:12] yes we see it not just in the women or
[8:14] not just that when we see it it may
[8:16] start to uh to accept things or go to
[8:19] places that they shouldn't be going to
[8:20] amen
[8:21] we find it made people doing things that
[8:23] the prophet of god said if you do those
[8:25] things they're going to love those
[8:26] things the world the love of god is not
[8:28] even in you that's right
[8:30] but we find those little pet things that
[8:32] we used to enjoy so much when before we
[8:34] heard the word of god that god that
[8:36] shook all those things out of us amen
[8:38] yes
[8:41] [Applause]
[8:45] [Music]
[8:48] [Applause]
[8:52] amen but you know that people will say
[8:55] well our church doesn't quite teach it
[8:57] that way or archer that if it's not your
[8:59] churches what does the word of god say
[9:01] amen amen
[9:02] what did the prophet say in disney well
[9:04] i know but i think he said i think it's
[9:06] not what we think is what he said right
[9:09] yes
[9:12] over the book of kings we find out that
[9:14] there was an elijah in that day too and
[9:16] he was he was going through the same
[9:18] problems that we were going through in
[9:19] this day
[9:20] people begin to think that well
[9:22] uh our our thoughts are just as good as
[9:25] your thoughts or our thoughts are just
[9:26] as good as your thoughts what makes you
[9:28] the authority just because you've got
[9:30] this prophet elijah amen
[9:33] over the book of first kings we find out
[9:35] elijah came to the people and he asked
[9:37] this question he said how long halt you
[9:39] between two opinions
[9:42] how long are you going to halt between
[9:43] two opinions if the lord be god follow
[9:46] him yes he said but if they'll be god
[9:48] then follow him and the people didn't
[9:50] have an answer they didn't have an
[9:51] answer for the word they didn't have an
[9:53] answer but here's the prophet of god
[9:54] saying hey look either either this is
[9:56] truth or it isn't truth which way are
[9:58] you going to which way are you going to
[9:59] go
[10:00] yes
[10:01] then elijah said other people i
[10:04] even i only remain a prophet unto the
[10:07] lord
[10:09] that's a pretty bold statement in a day
[10:11] and age we're living in but i would be
[10:13] so far i would go so far as to say that
[10:15] the elijah of our day could say the very
[10:17] same thing i even i only if i've left
[10:20] i'm a prophet unto the lord yes right
[10:23] there's 1200 some different
[10:24] denominations right but there's one
[10:27] message
[10:28] that's true unto the word of
[10:31] they all god right right well we don't
[10:33] think you have to do that all you
[10:34] sisters don't have to dress like all
[10:36] your brothers can do this
[10:37] we think it's all my pastor says it's
[10:39] okay hey man
[10:42] well how you going to know
[10:44] yes i want to follow the god that's
[10:46] vindicated by fire
[10:49] notice what elijah told him he said
[10:51] therefore
[10:52] give me two bullets and let them choose
[10:54] one bullet for themselves
[10:58] he says prophets alvaro's prophets are
[11:01] 450 men i say well there's more than 450
[11:04] false prophets out there
[11:06] right
[11:08] so
[11:08] let's have a showdown to find out just
[11:10] exactly who is god and who is it god he
[11:14] said let them therefore give us two
[11:16] bullets and let them choose one bullet
[11:17] for themselves cut it in pieces lay it
[11:19] on the wood and put no fire under it and
[11:21] i will dress the other book and land on
[11:23] the wood and i'll put no fire on it
[11:25] and it said that the one
[11:27] and you call on the name of your god and
[11:28] i will call upon the name of my lord and
[11:31] of the lord and the god that answers by
[11:35] fire let him be god amen is that fair
[11:38] enough yes let the golden eggs
[11:46] and i said if we would ask that today
[11:48] what god what lord has spoken or been
[11:51] vindicated in our day by fire other than
[11:53] the prophet of god for our day that's
[11:55] right the pillar of fire come down had a
[11:57] pitcher took it right over him and the
[11:58] pillar of fire raced down and then
[12:01] decided when he was ministering the word
[12:02] of god he was vindicated by fire amen
[12:04] that's right amen
[12:06] let's not let's not let's not
[12:09] turn away from our ears from the hearing
[12:10] of that word that he told us how to be
[12:12] delivered from all these things yes
[12:15] hallelujah
[12:18] let the one that makes himself known by
[12:20] fire let him be god
[12:22] and you know what began to you know what
[12:24] they begin to do all right our god's
[12:25] just as good as your god
[12:27] our god says you can have homosexual
[12:29] preachers our god says you can do this
[12:30] our god's going to do that our god said
[12:32] he gonna do that and he says well let
[12:34] the god that answers by fire my god says
[12:36] those things are sinful and you get them
[12:38] out of the church that's right
[12:40] we talked about this morning hold me
[12:42] back from those things lord
[12:44] amen
[12:46] but then we see them try to creep their
[12:48] way back into their church i mean i hear
[12:50] i'm here to say let's have a showdown
[12:51] that god did answer it by far amen and
[12:54] you know what they're doing they're
[12:55] doing all kinds of stuff in the world
[12:57] today i mean
[12:58] as they begin he said he let them go
[13:00] first
[13:01] yeah
[13:02] go ahead and show me
[13:04] and they begin to do this and they begin
[13:06] to shout they begin to rule they begin
[13:08] to holler and they begin to they begin
[13:10] to worship god call on bail they begin
[13:12] to do all these things you know we see
[13:14] at the churches today but we had a great
[13:16] meeting they shouted they ran they
[13:18] jumped and they hollered they glorified
[13:19] god but where was the fire amen that's
[13:21] right amen amen wherever the holy ghost
[13:24] did at all amen hallelujah where would
[13:26] that consuming fire consume all that
[13:29] amen yeah amen
[13:32] glory i'm not against all that stuff
[13:33] that stuff's good but let let when you
[13:35] hit the ground let's make sure we're
[13:37] walking according to the world
[13:40] hey man hallelujah
[13:44] man when they got done
[13:46] keep beginning to mock him in the middle
[13:47] of you know the whole story i'm not
[13:48] going to go into all that
[13:50] but church
[13:52] they're making a mockery of what god's
[13:54] word really says amen
[13:56] yes
[13:57] and probably god stood on his word he
[13:59] said no this is the word of god let the
[14:01] god that answers by fire our god is a
[14:03] consuming fire amen amen
[14:06] he said let him come down and consume
[14:09] the sacrifice
[14:10] how many know the word of god says i
[14:12] beseech you therefore brother present
[14:14] your bodies a living sacrifice holy
[14:16] acceptance let it be consumed that
[14:18] sacrifice need to be consumed and all
[14:20] the sin that was there needs to be
[14:22] consumed hallelujah
[14:24] glory as we said today amen it means to
[14:27] me it needs to be mortified or put to
[14:29] death yes hallelujah
[14:33] and they couldn't
[14:34] god didn't answer god didn't answer god
[14:36] and elijah got tired of it after a while
[14:38] he said okay
[14:40] he said i'll let the god that answered
[14:41] by far to let him be god amen the bible
[14:44] says over in the 36th verse that first
[14:46] kings 18 it said that it came to pass
[14:49] at the time of the evening sacrifice
[14:52] notice where it was it was in the
[14:53] evening

[14:58] of god was made manifest in there church
[15:00] i believe we're there this is the
[15:01] evening time yeah a whole lot later than
[15:03] we think amen

[15:07] time of the evening sacrifice that

[15:55] whose hearts have been turned back

[51:25] and i remember that day that beth come
[51:26] crying for
[51:28] her
[51:30] yes
[51:32] and i got to meet her sister
[51:35] that's right
[51:36] hallelujah amen but over in ezekiel the
[51:38] ninth chapter when we were using that
[51:41] scripture to preach out that uh there
[51:43] was a man who was
[51:45] the angel told a guard he was a white
[51:48] or whether he had a white vest or
[51:50] something to go with an acorn to mark
[51:52] all those decide and cry for the
[51:53] abomination
[51:56] amen
[51:58] he told the destroying no matter
[52:00] how much members there was
[52:03] how many things that they had done
[52:06] he said put a mark on that with the ink
[52:08] horn hey man
[52:10] let me get this right so i make sure i
[52:12] get it right he said he still he's he
[52:14] told the ceiling angel indeed till nine
[52:16] he said
[52:17] take and go through the city set a mark
[52:19] upon those who sigh and cry for the
[52:21] abomination of city he said the rest of
[52:23] them he said let the destroying angel
[52:26] destroy that's right
[52:28] let the destroying angel destroy them
[52:32] what was that ezekiel it was those that
[52:34] hated that sin that was going on and see
[52:36] if they were sighing and crying they
[52:38] hated that thing about everything else
[52:40] oh god why do you let that thing there

[52:45] want to see that sin there yes
[52:46] hallelujah they didn't want to see that
[52:48] there i mean that's the way a true
[52:50] believer they don't want to see that sin
[52:51] in their life
[52:54] and that's the mark of the holy ghost
[52:58] letting everyone be destroyed amen
[53:01] hallelujah yes lord god hallelujah that
[53:04] represents the holy spirit brother
[53:05] branham says amen when you have that
[53:07] kind of
[53:08] feeling in you he says
[53:10] he come down and put a mark on those
[53:12] that had that spirit in there but the
[53:14] rest he said utterly slay
[53:16] destroy children women babies kill them
[53:19] all little children yes say man
[53:21] that's pretty harsh
[53:24] that's what it does
[53:25] when you don't hate sin it causes death
[53:27] doesn't matter who the
[53:29] ones that
[53:30] everybody does
[53:32] yes everyone's destroyed that's what sin
[53:34] does it shows no mercy amen that's why
[53:36] we can't show any mercy we have to make
[53:38] sure every one of them is put to death
