TRANSCRIPT
========================================
poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profit me nothing let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto God today Heavenly Father Lord you see our hearts you see our hands Lord God we just want to take up our cross today and follow you Jesus we know you're the way the truth and the life and no one comes into the father except through you Lord God so we thank you God lord for who you are you're the Creator the Eternal one the matchless one the infinite one but you're also love so we thank you God for being love uh for being the ultimate source of everything good Lord in this universe Lord God so thank you dear father heavenly father father of Love uh bless us here today in your divine presence Lord God just anoint me to preach anoint your people to hear and father God may you minister to all the needs here today you saw the hands Lord God you're faithful I know you'll do it Lord because you're merciful you're gracious you're the merciful and faithful high priest Lord I pray you minister to all the needs Lord and feed your people the word of God as you promised Lord you said I'd water my people day and night every moment you'll guard us you'll keep us thank you for guarding us thank you for keeping us now Feed Us Lord water us with thy Spirit we pray in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said am amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so Cas I have some slides here today by God's grace so I've had this thought I've told you a few times over the last few months I'd like to preach on this thought of uh the understand all Mysteries um because we're a people that understand the mysteries of God as far as all that is uh known to us uh in the scripture by God's grace uh so we want to look at that here today uh by the help of the Lord and afterwards I might sing a good old song Jose always sings me a battle himym of the Republic he always sings that song there I love those verses brother Ram sing some special verses there by God's grace so I just thought I'd see if that will come up there PC in it's okay if it doesn't come up is that all connected here no okay all right no problem all is well so uh Scofield gave us a little uh copy or a little outline and we're I'm skipping ahead the first part is the introduction the believer standing in Grace and we are preaching on the carnal state of the Corinthians uh how they were extremely carnal but also extremely gifted they had a lot of Charisma you know the Greek word gift comes from uh I'm sorry the English word gif comes from the Greek word Charisma that's where we get uh Caris you know Caris is part of that it's a it's a gift of Grace the word grace in the Greek is Caris um but when you're gifted with a gift it's Charisma so these these uh Corinthians were extremely gifted uh many gifts uh but uh they they were lacking in some areas so I love how God uh corrects all those that he loves Hallelujah if he loves you he'll correct you amen so we see that God does this here uh with the Corinthians now I want to get the context here U uh second I'm sorry 1 Corinthians 12:28 and God hath set some in the the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healing helps governments diversities of tongues so the context of chapter 13 is God has set each person right where he wants them brother Ram said the best thing we can do is be ourselves and not try to be like somebody else Hallelujah so all we can do is draw close to God and and uh as God leads us by the Holy Spirit to manifest the love of God to other people and to be used by the holy spirit in the gifts God has given to us hallelujah because God set you as we'd say a pastor for my sake or God set brother Brandon as a prophet uh god Set each one of us maybe with the gift of faith or Divine Healing right or uh wisdom remember above all the gifts the nine gifts wisdom rule rules over all of them praise God so brother BR reminds us to uh to to remember that wisdom is above all else no no wonder the Bible said uh the main thing the principal theme of man is wisdom with all you're getting get wisdom so we use the gifts to honor God in a way that edifies the majority the biggest number of people the church Hallelujah for for example as Paul said tongues only edifies one person unless it's interpreted but a gift of wisdom could bless everybody brother B said a prophecy or the Bible said the prophecy can bless the entire church Hallelujah so seek to edify the entire church so the the context is God sets us in the gifts that we have verse 29 all are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of Miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret of course these are all no answers but covet earnestly the best gifts so God has set you with a gift right God has set our brothers and sisters with a gift uh and we're to covet the best gifts we're to pray God give us gifts that edify the whole church Hallelujah and then but yet now Paul makes a turn he's turning a corner and he says yet I'll show you a more excellent way and so chapter 13 is the excellent way you've been heard it called that of course before I'm sure if you've been around churches any very long the more excellent way in the Greek more excellent means Superior so Paul says I'm going to show you a superior way right so there's a there there's something Superior than to just Desiring gifts right Desiring gifts is good and finding your place is good but Superior above that is manifesting the love of Christ another word is Excellence so it's the excellent way it's the preeminence way Hallelujah so charity is the way of preeminence giving God preeminence uh by love it's he's going to show you uh the way beyond measure the exceedingly way the preeminently way and the beyond all measure way I'm going to show you a more excellent way uh Hallelujah a superior way a way that's above all other ways the ways of Love Hallelujah the word way of course if you ever studied history that's what Christianity was first called before it was called Christianity it was called the way the early Believers after Pentecost it was just called the way because everybody else was a Jew or everybody else was a heathen or a Greek or whatever they were in the certain areas and Roman but Christianity was called the way so Paul says I'm going to show you the the more excellent way there's a super ior way to live than just Desiring gifts of God there's something greater than gifts Hallelujah now the word way means a course of conduct it's a manner of thinking feeling or deciding and I like I like how it places it it places this more excellent way in the human mind right because we spend most of our time in our mind Hallelujah right about how how do I respond to this how do I how do I address this and uh what should I think about that and how should I think about that how long should I think about this we spend a lot of time in our minds contemplating things and so Paul said I'm going to show you a superior way of thinking feeling or making decisions in your life and that Superior way is the love of God see Paul knew this group this this Corinthian group they needed a more excellent they need a superior way of thinking in order to exist together because they were already divided on who is the best preacher and who baptized them uh they already had sexual immorality among them and they weren't they weren't upset about it the Bible said they were puffed up in other words they're like well it's okay everybody has mistakes it's okay if this man's sleeping with his stepmother I mean aren we all who are you to judge us we all got problems well that's true in one way but it's not true in another way Hallelujah if we claim to be Christ he that nameth the name of Christ let that man or woman depart from iniquity Hallelujah we can't claim to know Christ and then no continue to live in sin it's contrary one to the other Hallelujah they were also planning to sue each other uh and Paul said you need a more excellent way than than just seeking gifts and seeking for Supernatural in the church services there's a greater way than that Hallelujah and then he said they got drunk at the Lord's table and the rich people looked down upon the poor people in the church and these things should not be in a Christian Church Hallelujah he said they needed a more excellent way because uh their gifts were out of order and too many tongues and too many interpretations Paul said at the most three and but they would just let it go on and go on and on and on he said they lacked even generosity to St Paul Paul had to get uh uh uh his his his daily needs met by other churches because the Corinthian Church failed to give Paul just basic food and shelter and clothing and things and then he also said that they suffered false teachers because the false teachers were so eloquent and they were just uh so precise and no doubt they were rich as well uh he said they allowed the false teachers to influence them and Paul's saying you need a more excellent way you need a superior way to live your lives as a church Hallelujah well Satan is going to rip the church apart Hallelujah now uh 1 Corinthians 14 now now so after 13 let's look at the context so before it's I you know you should seek these gifts these gifts are great uh we don't remember we don't want to bury our talent in the ground that's the worst thing we can do remember out of the parable of talents the worst thing you could have done is bury your talent in your ground say I'm not going to do anything for Jesus I'm too afraid to do anything for Jesus I'm gonna fail that's the worst attitude you can have how can I fail if Jesus is on my side amen how could I fail amen if he give me money if he give me Talent if he give me ability it's impossible for me to fail I just got to take him at his word and believe his promises amen invest my life into the things of God into the ways of God and surely I'll be a Victor I'll be a hero right as Henry wodsworth wodsworth Longfellow said Hallelujah be a hero Hallelujah but now right after he gets into love and we'll of course Circle back to love there in First Corinthians 14:1 he says follow after charity so after he gives us the description of Charity which we'll get to he said follow after it and desire spiritual gifts so I love this he sets up the gifts and then he says well here's the most excellent way and then after that now he says now here's how here's the order follow charity make sure you're you're constantly following after the love of God and then after that then desire the gifts of the Spirit so make F make make sure you're seeking first the love of God and his righteousness Hallelujah and then desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy he said because uh in verse five he says that the church may receive edifying Hallelujah so Paul understood all gifts are important all gifts are are are from God but he said pray for the ones that will bless the most people hallelujah so we want we want to look at our lives like that we want to we want to be able to uh Express the love of God and we want to be a blessing to as many people as we possibly can Hallelujah now I want to read what scoffield said I want to now get to 1 Corinthians 13 and Paul scoffield notes he says gifts are good but only only if ministered in love Hallelujah so gifts are gifts are no good uh unless they're ministered by the love of God hallelujah and then then he says benevolence so giving to the poor giving your body to be burned and giving clothes to the poor uh he said that's good but it's only good when it's done with love not not not just feeling well I I'm compelled I better give because I should be a cheerful Giver it's because I am a cheerful Giver because God has given so much to me I want to be able to be a blessing to other people hallelujah and then you know we get later in the chapter love is described and then love charity is better than our present incomplete knowledge and then Charities greater than even Faith and Hope hallelujah we're saved by grace through faith right and faith is the first attribute on the statute of perfect man we're saved by grace through faith Hallelujah but love is greater than that Hallelujah love is greater than Faith even Hallelujah and hope oh it's a blessing now uh 1 Corinthians 13:2 if there's ever a verse for message people this is the verse and though I have to gift of Prophecy brother Rah had the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains now that's speaking of the third poll so so here though I understand all Mysteries there's revelation 10:7 can everybody see that the Bible said the mysteries of God are finished so there's Revelation 10:7 have all knowledge that kind of ties in with that and though I have all Fai that I can remove mountains uh what is the third F speaking of the word so we have revelation 10:7 we have I believe it's Mark uh 13 if I'm not mistaken if you say to this mountain and don't doubt in your heart it will move Hallelujah so we have revelation 10:7 we have the spoken word Hall there is the Original Seed amen we have the third pole if ever there's a verse for us this is the verse for us hallelujah he says though I can do all that though I have all that with if I don't have charity if I don't have the love of God I'm nothing in other words my life is a failure my life was in vain so let let's just break it down again so even though I understand all the Mysteries if I don't have love it does it didn't help me at all in my walk with God if I spoke to Every Mountain and God moved every mountain and every obstacle in my life and made my life so much easier and gave me every blessing that I desired if that if even that happened it didn't help me because love was not a part of it right because if love's not a part of it well then what's it about it's selfishness right because love is God's love for other people right so we must have the the understanding of the mystery and have love and want to share with other people we must we must have faith to speak to mountains and and obstacles in our life but it must be based upon God's love God's will so we can clearly see if there was ever a verse for bride of Christ Fellowship it's 1 Corinthians 13 verse2 I would say also for the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah know you hear different people talk about uh you know the time before the squeeze and people might speak that into existence and speak that into existence Church it would only do anybody any good if it's if it's done by love right if anything's to be spoken brother Ram said there may come a time when missing limbs will grow back well that God would only do that that would only profit the bride if it made us love God more not to magnify a certain personality or a certain church or something like that it would only benefit if it was the love of God God's love grew back a limb Hallelujah God's love did a miracle that was uh very much needed it would have to be the love of God and the people would all all rejoice and God would get all the glory because God does not share his glory with anyone hallelujah hallelujah now I believe we understand all the Bible defined Mysteries just for a brief moment I'm going to rehearse there's 12 uh the Bible says mystery 27 times in the New Testament 12 of them are doctrines like the Kingdom of Heaven there's one body of of Jew and Gentile the Rapture mystery the church as the Bride of Jesus Christ Israel's blindness the will of God the Seven Stars and the Seven golden candlesticks the mystery of iniquity mystery of Babylon mystery of godliness mystery of the godhead and Christ in you the hope of Glory Hallelujah and brother Ram says he says these Mysteries uh from the unveiling of God he says uh the shikina glory talking about living in the holiest of holies he said the shikina glory the Pres of God and the holiest of holies it ripens the shoe bread that we Feast on and drive across the country for so brother baham is basically saying his ministry is preaching the living bread of God and the people the Mysteries that he's preach are causing people to be so fulfilled amen the Mysteries are such wonderful shoe bread he calls it that people are willing to drive across the country Hallelujah my wife and I were willing to drive with Lydia three hours one way six hours every Sunday for a year and a half we were willing to drive across the state for the Sho bread of the word of God hallelujah for a year and a half we did that that was a it seemed like I I can't remember doing it seems like so long ago and I I know my wife's probably different on that but but brother said this shoe bread that we're feasting on he said you're driving across the country for it he said it's the believer's food it's only for a Believer we're talking about the Mysteries here here remember the Sho bread was for the believer only the shoe bread seed what does it do that that shakina of Glory over the shoe bread it kept it from spoiling so brother says he's preaching the word of God that doesn't spoil it's the mysteries of God that's been finished this might be deep so maybe that's okay if I don't hear a lot of amens he said what's this sh kind of Glory today to break Beyond the Veil to see who God Is Standing before you to see who God is standing here before us the pillar of fire he's veiled in human flesh but what does the shikina what did it do he said the shikina seed the word that we're to live on in this day by these promises the shikina glory ripens that shoe bread brings it to pass makes it bread to the believer he said that laid in the pages of your Bible year after year the word for this age amen hallelujah how many believe that by God's grace so brother said you drive across the country for the bread it laid in seed form in the Bible but it could only be eaten it could only be fresh in this day when God's spirit is quickening that seed and bringing that bread to life and you and I can eat the bread it's fresh bread brother said but what's it to be done in the last days what is to reveal to bring forth what's Malachi 4 to do to turn back the people from that that stumbling block to break down the traditions and to reveal the bread with the shikina glory watch it ripen and produce just exactly what it said it would do oh my the shoe bread for this age Hallelujah so see that's what the message did for me it broke down the Traditions I had at the Assemblies of God the tradition was we all got to speak in tongues that was the tradition and if you don't speak in tongues you don't got all of it brother or sister but see the message broke that down because we just read it Paul says not everybody speaks with tongues well see that breaks down the whole the whole goal of every service is for somebody to speak in tongues or God to do America of a tongu interpretation that's the whole height of it right uh and and so the the message came to me the seed came to me and it broke down that tradition and now you see the whole goal of the service is to magnify Christ that Christ would be in us the hope of Glory Hallelujah that we would manifest Jesus Christ for this age Hallelujah and that our hearts would be turned back to the apostolic fathers so we would have faith can I just say like that so we would have faith like Peter James and John and Paul Hallelujah he says brother man goes on to say but now as Revelation 10 has promised all the mysteries of God that's been hidden in the pages down through them years would be ripened bring forth in the age of the seventh Angel's message is that right Hallelujah so brother Ram ties in Revelation 10 with with the the shoe bread in the Holy place that we come and we feed on that fresh bread he said it's finished and that that that seed bread has ripened into shoe bread and we partake of that and when do they partake on it on the Lord's Day Hallelujah and this is the Lord's Day Hallelujah brother Bram said but until you come in behind that Badger skin I wish I we probably need to get up a picture of the the the three the three courts of Moses's Tabernacle he said but until you come behind that Badger skin speaking of the Holy place until you get out of your old skin your old thoughts your old Creeds and come into the presence of God then the word becomes a living reality to you then you're awakened to the shakina of Glory then the Bible becomes a new book so see anyone that doesn't love their Bible they've not be they've not come into this sh kind of Glory anyone that doesn't love the fresh word of God you've not come into the sh kind of Glory Hallelujah what it's the same Bible right that's it's laate here year after year but in brother Ram's day it became ripe the Holy Spirit quickened the the the prophecy on the pages it became a new book people were willing to drive across the country to hear the Revelation the finished mystery of God it's our food it's what we live on it's what we Feast on and if we eat the new book we become a new creature amen he said then the Bible becomes a new book then Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you're living is his in his presence eating the shoe bread that's only provided that day for believers for priests only and he said we are priests royal priesthood a holy nation peculiar people giving spiritual sacrifices to God but you must come in everybody say must come in ready must coming you must come in to behind that Veil to see the veiled God and God is unveiled that's his word made manifest so Church we're not seeing God through a veil we'd say necessarily today like a Assemblies of God Veil or a presbyterian Veil or a Baptist Veil we're not seeing God through a veil we're seeing God as if we're priests in the Holy place and then we can actually go into the Hol of holies we can go into the presence of God and experience the glory of God in 1961 brother Ram said and the God had explained no matter how much you're right here's one thing we fail and Miss Brothers No matter how right I am and how scriptural I am and how much I know about God's Bible if I haven't got the spirit of God of love in my heart for the whole human race and all than I'm wrong to begin with so we need to have love for the human race if we don't love everyone right every country every language every skin color right every tongue if we don't love every Kindred tribe and tongue then we're wrong to begin with our purpose is wrong thank God we got a very diverse church here today Hallelujah the devil can't say you don't have a diverse church we have a very diverse church and we're thankful for that we love the whole human race Hallelujah he said Paul said in first Corinthians 13 though I I have all knowledge and understand all the Mysteries and have not charity I'm nothing he says uh so if I know all the mysteries of God and can unroll them and make them all hit together and I don't have love what good does it do Jesus said this will all men know that you are my disciples when you have love for another Hallelujah and brother look brother Ram says in 1961 and of course I know it's before the indictment of 63 where brother R indicted all the denominations he says when the assemblies have love for the Oneness and the Oneness has love for the assemblies see Church you want to have love for each and every person I think some of our some some of our relatives might even be Catholic still is that right some is your mom a Catholic brother I've been telling people that your dad okay that's I was telling somebody somebody was asking about you who was it somebody was asking me they said is that brother still coming that new brother with his siblings somebody was asking me about you yesterday buddy I said he's doing great by God's grace I thought of the how there's some Catholic connection Jose do you have family still in the Catholic church I like his sense of humor 9 yeah Nicaragua yeah absolutely so as message Believers we the message churches should love Catholics and I'm not talking about Sin we never love sin we love the Sinners right this will all men know that we're God's disciples jesus' disciples when we have love one for another Jose's probably sent prayer claw to Catholics I'd imagine i' imagine hallelujah amen that's what I thought but I didn't know couldn't remember he says but when you have love one for another be right or wrong is as long as the objective is wrong the motive is wrong rather then you're wrong to begin with isn't that right he says though I speak with tongue of men and angels have not chared on nothing yet because God is love we know that do you know that God is love today in this next quote brother bam says Revelation 10:7 is equal to Malachi 45 and 6 this is from the uniting time in sign July 18th is that Casa's birthday amen Hallelujah he says what a day what a time that we're living this great mystery of God being finished bringing the godhead showing what it is how these little isms went off and somebody made him this and somebody made him this and somebody made him that but the angel of the Lord come down and brought up all their isms and pulled out that truth out of it and presented it and there it is just as perfect as it can be no other way you could go I could say Amen to that I can't preach any other way to go than the godhead is one person there it is that's what he is see serpent seed all these different things that's been so mysteriously amongst the people what is it this is the sign to unite then he says in the next paragraph what did he say in Malachi 4 would restore restore back the original Pentecostal Faith back to the people with the same Pentecostal message the same Pentecostal sign the same Pentecostal evidence the same God the same power the same teaching everything exactly with the Vindication of the same Pillar of Fire that struck Paul down on the road down to Damascus amongst us today doing the same things he did in that day uniting Hallelujah okay so there he he puts all the Mysteries being finished he even puts serpent seed in there with the godhead now I put serpent seed in the mystery of iniquity because that's how iniquity came in the world through lust the Bible says where was the first lust Genesis chapter 3 right she lusted uh after the fruit right now the next quote qu brother says marriage and divorce needs explained and because this is the hour of Revelation 10:7 so brother Ram even places marriage and divorce as part of Revelation 10:7 I agree I believe marriage and divorce is a part of the revelation of the church as the bride because it's marriage and divorce it's our marriage with Christ Christ won't divorce US amen he's only he only divorced Israel but then he's going to bring her back Hallelujah he's going to let her back into the Covenant amen Third Exodus brother Ram says he said before I leave Lord willing I like to take the scripture and don't tape it now look what he says this this is almost two years before he preach it don't tape it if they do don't sell the tape don't let it out I want to explain the real truth of marriage and divorce it's a question and this is the last hours that when all the mysteries of God should be finished and yesterday coming up across the mountains about daylight the Holy Spirit seem to say to me take that and lay it away I don't know why but the real truth of marriage and divorce see what the Lord said about this marriage and divorce it's more sacred than people think it is and it'll blend right in with the serpent seed Hallelujah does just the same thing just moving right on then that's the Mysteries remember in the days of the seventh angel all the mystery of God should be finished those unknown things that the Lord would wind up Hallelujah so it's like church at the fourth Church age it's like uh there was all these Springs in here right uh and they just they J all kind of sprung out and all the Springs BR broke forth but brother R said his ministry was to take all these Springs and place them back in here tie them back together make everything on God's clock tick just perfectly Hallelujah that's what God is doing he's winding it back up he's putting everything back together so it all fits so there's no confusion God is not the author of confusion Hallelujah he's helping us understand the word in the next quote brother man says all the Mysteries are supposed to be finished including marriage and divorce this is a man running from the presence of God and about that marriage and divorce I wanted to speak on it ever since the time of those Seven Seals you know all the Mysteries was supposed to be made known in them opening them Seven Seals All The Mysteries of the Bible Hallelujah he said and I thought I'd better at least put it on tape whether if something would happen to me then the church might wonder wonder what we had on his mind what would he say aren't you glad the Lord allowed him to do that Hallelujah and all those subject that seems to be so hard he said I think by the Lord's help I'm going to try to bring them to you and then if something happens and if I happen to go before he comes you'll have it on record then in the next quote brother said finishing the mysteries of God is the father's business how many remember the father's business scripture Jesus was 12 years old in the synagogue and Mary and Joseph are like where is this where's this boy he he close to a man by that point where is this boy and they found him uh in the temple correcting the the elders and the priest and he said uh you know why aren't you with your father and he says he said I must be about my father's business so Jesus in the temple bringing the word bringing truth that was the father's business and brother said Revelation 10:7 is the father's business he said then why he said what is it now we must be about the father's business the wheat would cry back the grain yes sir what must it do vindicate Malachi 4 vindicate Luke 17:30 vindicate Hebrews 138 vindicate St John 14:12 The Works that I do shall you do also vindicate all of his words so he names those four and then he says all the word vindicate he said vindicate Revelations the 10th chapter of the opening of The Seven Seals and the mysteries of God even to the serpent seed and all would be manifested marriage and divorce and all these other Mysteries that's been hid under the pillars for all these years from the theologians and so forth but now it's the hour that's the father's business Church don't you know there's so many churches around the world today and it's like it's like this they don't understand marriage and divorce they don't un they don't understand serpent SE that's why they let them marry two three times but Church we're so blessed God has come and taking the veil off Hallelujah and now we see the truth hallelujah and now we know what God wants us to do Hallelujah the book's a new book imagine this is what you thought of the book beforehand this is what you saw about the book you didn't see it but now that the God has sent a prophet to finish the mysteries of God now you see the book Hallelujah no wonder it's a brand new book Hallelujah before that you just believe whatever the pastor whatever the Theologian whatever the Evangelist said whatever the doctor had said before that we just believed all that but now God is let us go behind the veil Hallelujah and now we're feeding on the word of God hallelujah he says but that's the father's business so Revelation 10:7 is the father's business think they would receive it they want to be dignified and say our denomination don't teach us that but the Bible does that's right Hallelujah in the next quote brother says marriage and divorce and every hidden Mystery will be revealed and he says this in marriage and divorce Revelation the 10th chapter Jesus Promised it that all of these hidden mysteries on marriage and divorce all these other Hidden Mysteries that's been would be revealed in the end time and you remember the voice said go to Tucson remember the Mystic light in the sky speaking of uh the cloud from Arizona February 28th 1963 the seventh angel standing there come back and the opening of The Seven Seals watch what's taking place that is true next quote the TR the true mystery revealed with thus sayith the Lord Easter seal 1965 and that's what I'm in Arizona for now there's many people sitting here stood here right here in Phoenix and heard me tell you from this platform thus sayith the Lord how many remembers it now go something is fixing to happen I shared that quote with you a few weeks ago brother r at the beginning of 1963 said I come here in the name of the Lord anybody remember that quote he said I'm here in the name of the Lord to fulfill a vision that I had brother R said I saw seven angels come didn't life magaz packet as the fog of it floated across here 27 mil high and 30 Mi across and then he names brothers that were there those Brothers stood right there when them seven angels appeared right there on the hill it shook the hills for miles around like that there stood seven angels and throwed a sword in your hand and said go home and open these Seven Seals that are given and here they are the true mystery of marriage and divorce and the serpent seed and all these things that's been fussed about it's thus saith the Lord what a blessing we've received church sometimes I wish we would just pinch ourselves in real life realize we've got thus sayi the Lord we're not an regular Church we're not we're not part of the Harlot system we've got the word of the Lord th we have thus saith the Lord hallelujah I've been listening to Ezekiel I think I'm in chapter 16 yeah I never I was I didn't get to finish chapter 16 yesterday and it's amazing God tells Ezekiel do this thus sayith the Lord go tell them thus sayith the Lord the word the Lord came to thus sayith the lord it's thus sayith the Lord constantly and that's exactly how God dealt with brother random gave him thus sayith the Lord so we have thus sayith the Lord the Seven Seals are open marriage and divorce is part of that a serpent seed in other words all the mysteries of God should be finished Hallelujah and then he goes on to saying Easter now here's the thing I like I remember preaching this at uh brother Jim shemakes church back in Pennsylvania and this was such a help to me what is it he's talking about Revelation 10:7 serpent seed marriage and divorce Seven Seals what is it now I hope somebody can say Amen to this what is it it's the quickening power coming to the church making her ready this hour that we're approaching quickening power what is the Seven Seals What is marriage and divorce what is serpent seed it's quickening power to get us ready for the Rapture Hallelujah think about that marriage and divorce if people are adulterers if they stay in adultery they're not going in the Rapture so they need the quickening power of marriage and divorce to get their marriage system all lined up to make sure it pleases God they're in the perfect will of God then they've got quickening power to go in the Rapture Hallelujah is that right the first seal the white horse rider that's quickening power right we can't let uh deceptive Spirits like a white horse rider we can't let Satan get in and deceive us with Deeds of the nians traditions of men right a church like that won't go in the Rapture she's got to be washed in in the blood of the Lamb she must be in the word all the way she must be guided into all truth hallelujah I love that quote Oh God help us to receive it brother Brandon says help us to believe it see I believe in the quickening power of Revelation 10:7 so much that I'll I'll preach marriage and divorce the right way without compromising on it Hallelujah I've had numerous people ask me could you marry me about this and I find out later no I won't marry on that I'm not going to make any compromises Hallelujah not going to do it because it's quickening power if you live in the truth the truth will set you free Hallelujah the truth will Empower you hallelujah it's God's spirit will always anoint God's word hallelujah see it just depends on what attitude you take towards it that's what we need today a good attitude towards the word of God right instead of uh fearful attitudes instead of critical attitudes right instead of negative attitudes we need a positive attit ude towards God's word it's quickening power to us the mysteries of God are finished it's our shoe bread it's giving us Grace for the Rapture hallelujah amen hallelujah quickening power coming to the church making her ready for the Rapture and what other churches preaching Revelation 10:7 is quickening power for the Rapture I guess there's one I think it was uh was it the Seventh Day Adventist they actually believe uh their Charles they believe Charles T's Russell was Revelation 10:7 but now they don't now they have a they have a new Prophet all the time they keep making all these false prophecies Hallelujah last quote before I get back to the scripture I know you've been enjoying these quotes Hallelujah in this quote it's from the rising of the sun brother R's uh morning sermon on Easter the last year of his life and so there God spoke to me and said those Seven Seals will be opened the seven Mysteries Sevenfold mystery of the Bible That's closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed and we yet a humble little group compared with all the world we've enjoyed these blessings hearing those Mysteries marriage divorce serpent seed all these different questions has been completely revealed to us everybody say completely complely do we have any questions about marriage and divorce no sir I don't do you have any questions about the serpent seed well there's a few small details but I don't any questions about as far as is it right or wrong it's right the Seven Seals I don't have any questions about the Seven Seals Hallelujah as far as uh the any of the the revelations the symbols brother Ram gave us I don't have any questions about that because brother Ram says we have completely got them revealed to us not by man he said but by God himself that's open those seven mysteries of what the church was how it was in Christ at the beginning and how it would be revealed in this day Hallelujah yeah I tell you this this this uh series is really helping me it's reminding me we are not on the the we're not on the level the Corinthian Church we're able to live higher because we've got quickening power hallelujah amen of all those sins I listed of that uh that are in the Corinthian Church which one do we have think about that well we don't have uh we don't have anybody seing anybody we don't got sexual immorality as far as I know unless somebody wants to confess it today at this altar right and think about these things we don't have these things why we've got quickening power the word is power Hallelujah the Bible said the word is nigh to you even in your mouth Hallelujah so if we want power we got to speak the word of God believe the word of God receive the word of God and it gives us quickening power to make us ready for the Rapture then he quotes Life Magazine again he said they're completely revealed to us not by man but by God hallelujah how am I doing on time oh really good on time Hallelujah now let's go back to the scripture here 1 Corinthians 13:4 can you try one more time uh Casa oh yeah maybe I plugged it in the wrong side here can you try one more time to put this up here I just thought of that there's a keyboard attachment and maybe I think the keyboard only supports charging it doesn't to support other devices well there we go hallelujah praise the Lord so you want to go back and see all those quotes I got lots of quotes from Brother B quickening power now let's go back and now let's see here let's examine our lives do we have the love of God in our midst Hallelujah what's the most valuable thing brother Jesse is it is it Miracles is it moving Every Mountain is it understanding your book The 12 new test Mysteries no no that that's not even the most important thing the most important thing is Charity charity suffereth long so charity doesn't lose heart oh wo is me my life is so hard I got it I got it bad I don't even know if God loves me does God care for me the love of God doesn't let you do that too long we're all human but charity is able to suffer a long time it's able to keep the heart keep the heart encouraged a long time see bravely charity is brave in enduring misfortunes and troubles well if this is happening that's fine I'm going to be brave amongst this I'm going to get through this God will bring me through it you've heard the saying if God brought me to it God will bring me through it Hallelujah that's a love of God hallelujah everybody see that this is this is the superior way this is superior than all the gifts thank God for all the gifts thank God for all the Miracles that we've seen thank God for healing Robbie Davis and Carolyn out there and and and uh nine pages of of the brother from Illinois brother Phil Carlson thank God for nine pages of symptoms vanished in a prayer in a moment hallelujah thank God for that but love Superior Hallelujah so this is this takes a greater expression of God's love here a greater expression of God's spirit to be patient so so love is patient and bearing the offenses and injuries of others to be mild and slow to punish Hallelujah is that right charity suffers a long time now your definition of long is not the same as God's a week and a half might seem like a long time to you a month might seem like a long time to you a year might seem like a long time to you but God determines how long it is love will be brave and endure the misfortunes in my life and the troubles that I go through and love is also kind which means mild not harsh mild now remember now Church remember you got to balance this all out was Jesus uh harsh or mild when he took the rope and scourged out the money chamber was he was he Meek or he was very harsh right but what did he do he he gave them many mild warnings did he not he preached to them he told them you know the Pharisees that they love the greetings in the marketplace don't be like them you know he gave them many mild warnings but there comes a time for the Church of God the house of God to be purged so we got to balance this this means for the M most of the time charity is kind it's mild it doesn't Envy it doesn't boil up with Envy wasn't it Nate no it was Eden that one of the the bible study on Envy right yeah we did that was it what's the another name for it jealousy yeah that's right jealousy so charity doesn't get jealous boil up with Envy that's not the love of God the love of God rejoices with those who Rejoice Hallelujah charity doesn't vaunteth itself up it's not puffed up I got got to go to the next slide vaunteth means to boast on oneself it doesn't display itself in other words it displays Christ it doesn't make embellishments and extol ones excessively so the love of God is going to deflect attention off of you you and I must deflect the attention off of us and we must put all the attention on Christ is that the love of God that's the love of God God's love will always push the attention onto Christ love of God doesn't extol magn magnify oneself the love of God is Not puffed up it does not inflate or blow up in other words Pride to be proud to Bear oneself lofly to cause to swell up like when I was growing up uh they would say oh you got a you got a swollen head what they meant was you thought oh you're so smart you know you're you're the you're greater than everybody else right that's an expression that's what the Bible says not puffed up the love of God doesn't make us proud the love of God makes us humble does not behave itself unseemly which is improper not fittingly so the love of God makes you fit in it doesn't do something that's out of the cater selfish or sinful it makes you fit in to the body of Christ the love love of God the charity seeketh not her own it doesn't demand its way it doesn't doesn't crave its own way the love of God wants God's way Hallelujah God's love is not easily provoked in other words you don't get irritated very quickly it takes a lot to irritate you we're digging really down deep into your soul today Hallelujah the love of God is not easily provoked to anger the love of God doesn't do burn with anger right with provoked anger with with selfish anger and I love this the love of God doesn't think any evil and it doesn't assume the worst about someone it assumes the best about people that's the love of God remember all this church remember all this is greater than if somebody stood here and said thus sayith the Lord tomorrow at 3 p p.m there's going to come a fire and burn this person's house in the church tell them to get out by at least 2 2 p.m. thus sayi the lord it's going to come to pass and how we would Rejoice if that happened but even greater than that is if we can have love one for another not exalt ourselves not be envious not be jealous but Express the love of God to each one of us hallelujah this is the more excellent way this is the superior way to live our lives Hallelujah God's love does not rejoice in iniquity that means Injustice or unrighteousness you I thought it was funny you know uh the the Democrat Party was they called themselves the campaign of joy and remember outside of their uh convention they had they had a van set up to do abortions and they called it the campaign of Joy it was the campaign of iniquity Injustice ending babies lives before they can can even speak but they but they rejoice in that right that's just one example and I know the Republicans got just as many right you can find just as many but just an example God's love does not rejoice in Injustice or any unrighteousness so friends let's remember how many know that sometimes you you sin every day now notice I said sometimes can't preach on that again there and I said possible there it's possible you could have a day I felt like I've had a couple days right in sin by God's grace but see we we want to rejoice in the truth we don't rejoice in iniquity we rejoice in the truth hallelujah we don't get happy about our sins if we're so anytime we we've sinned throughout the day and we haven't confessed it we have to know God's love does not rejoice in that God's love is trying to lead us to repent of our sins Hallelujah here we go verse seven charity Bears all things so the love of God can cover over any sin the love of God can keep Silence about any sin the love of God can hide or conceal any sin done to us that's the love of God it Bears all things it can bear it think about that Jesus bore the cross right now the whole time he was bearing the cross was he saying oh you Roman Soldier shame on you look what you made me go through was he doing that so we shouldn't either we should say father what father forgive them they don't know what they're doing if anybody ever bore everything it was Christ bore all of our sins all of our iniquities he bore them all so Paul says love should help us to Bear the iniquities of others now don't you think church when they read this at at the Corinthian Church don't you think that burned the height of those guys that were suing each other because they were going to the judge saying he stole this you know he promised me to pay back $10,000 I I want my $10,000 back he swindled me in this deal and I never got it back and I wonder what those guys faces were no they probably they probably the best seats they were all probably sitting right up front the Bible said right with their their gold on and and their jewels and I wonder if if uh uh if Christmas didn't look over and say it Bears all things and won't sue your brother or sister I wonder if he just wouldn't make eye contact with him Bears all things won't take people to court God's love bears all things you know what every every uh week I drive past a house there in doown privac we're coming up a hill and this guy bless his heart I'm not crit I'm not trying to criticize he's got two signs in his yard and this I'll just say John Doe owes me $684 he drive a little further and he says John Doe owes me $ 6,840 some he just put it out there for everybody to see he really wants his money back he's will to get out his paintbrush and paint that and put it put it in there but see the love of God would hide hide that the love of God would pay I'm sorry would pray about that Hallelujah God's love believes all things now of course that's the word right doesn't believe lies it believes all the word Hallelujah and that's where hope so see now we can see hope believing all things is is Faith right I'm sorry hope it's not Faith Hope believing all things is having faith so now we can see having faith is part of the love of God but the love of God is all encompassing the love of God is the greatest attribute of God hallelujah faith is part of love right here because because love believes all the word of God Amen and love even hopes all things it hopes in the love of God it hopes in the plan of God it hopes in the the the purpose of God it hopes in in the direction of God the future God has for us God's love hopes in that Hallelujah we can be hopeful this morning praise God hallelujah because the love of God is in our hearts Hallelujah and God's love can endure all things Hallelujah so no matter what trials no matter what Temptations come you know just yesterday I got my haircut and I every every time I go in there now I I I don't know if I told Mal I go in there I reach out my hand I sit in my car I pray said you know sometimes they they tell dirty jokes I said in the name of Jesus Christ I'm coming in there with the love of God and I'm not going to I'm not going to be tempted by their dirty jokes and somebody said a customer right in front of me I just put my head down I try to keep the conversation on God they didn't say anything you know he's come up to my face a couple times that that other Barber and he's tried to say things to me I just stare at him but as I'm leaving for the first time uh the the owner said God bless you uh brother Jesse called me brother he said God I said God bless you too brother Phil I like that Hallelujah just try just wanting I I just want to express the love of God I don't want to fall down I don't want to be uh brought down by Sinners I want to try to raise them up by the love of God hallelujah just just m just having faith and and asking God God help me to manifest the love of God help me to be different than other people hallelujah amen because I told him the Miracles of my mom I told him the Miracles we've seen in our church I told him these Miracles he just goes on cutting hair right so Miracles isn't enough to move right sometimes a miracle can cause somebody to believe but we know the real thing is the love of God hallelujah God's love the gospel the goodness of God leads people to repent Hallelujah that's right God's love hopes all things God love God's love can endure all things I'm about ready to close I'm probably not going to go too long much longer I love this quote I found this quote this morning Satan can copy any kind of gift so Satan has a false wisdom right Satan has a false knowledge he has a false Faith false Divine Healing right false tongues false discernment false prophecy false interpretation of tongues I'm always forgetting one I can get eight of them which one did I miss L you're my second brain which one did I miss I think I said discernment but it doesn't matter I'm to to je I can always remember eight but not nine Satan has a he can copycat that now notice Satan can't have that everybody understand that Satan doesn't have the gifts of God but he can try to impersonate it there's a quote where brother R says Satan can give out those gifts but you understand what brother R is saying Satan can't give out gifts God gave you the gifts what Satan is doing he's impersonating gifts right that's what he's doing Satan can impersonate every one of those gifts Hallelujah he can try to prophesy he can try to predict that try to speak that try to we i' I've seen people uh pretend to speak in tongues my whole life growing up because some of them weren't genuine you can tell they're not genuine other ones may might have been genuine because God comes along and backs it up whether it's right or wrong Hallelujah see but he can't love God is love that's right see Satan can't love it's impossible he's the Fallen Angel right he he's the wicked one he's that old dragon that old serpent the devil he cannot love he looks at 1 Corinthians 3 and he says I know nothing about that God help us to know something about 1 Corinthians 13 amen if anybody should know something about First Corinthians 13 it should be a real blood bought Blood Washed Holy Ghost filled Church of the Living God hallelujah amen Satan cannot express these attributes of God's love Hallelujah so Satan cannot suffer long Satan runs out of suffering Hallelujah everybody with me he runs out because I can't suffer no more I've got to do this I've got to say that I've got to go do that I got to get my revenge right and Satan certainly isn't kind right he slandered Jesus he Slanders all the uh prophets he slandered he's he's he's accuser of the Brethren so Satan's main his main title there in in Revelation is dragon serpent that old devil and he's called the accuser of the Brethren he's not kind and Satan will cause you to Envy Satan envies he wants to be Lord he said I I'll be like the most high I'll make myself greater than God I'll send to the heights of the heaven he eny God I'll be like God I'll receive worship God said no you won't that's selfish that's not vot motivated by the love that I offered you God originally created him to express the love of God and we don't know how many thousands or millions or billions of years Satan was faithful in his position as the the anointed cherub in heaven but at some point he got this uh Envy in his heart he's lifted up because of his Beauty lifted up because of his pride and then from that moment on Satan could no longer love Satan will always vaunt others up and make themselves prideful I'm right I know more I know all about it they need to come to me I they need to ask me I'm the one that's got knows it all right Satan will do that but love doesn't do that Hallelujah Satan will always puff people up to make themselves great greater than what they really are Satan will always do something that is unseemly it's not the right time not the right season it's not received by the body of Christ Hallelujah and Satan is always seeking his own his own interest to steal kill and destroy he can't love he can't put his interest on the back burner he always does what he wants didn't Jesus say uh Satan uh doesn't he doesn't crave the things of God I'm saying the wrong word but he told that with Peter Jesus told that with Peter Hallelujah he wants his own way and and of course Satan thinks all evil and Satan tries to inject our thoughts with evil thoughts about others that's Satan's job but again friends the love of God does none of this Hallelujah amen if anybody needs that it's us hallelujah we're we're we're people that believe the mystery of God the mystery of God is finished hallelujah we're people some of us some of us have spoken to mountains and they've moved Hallelujah and if not get ready if it's your gift it's going to happen Hallelujah you just stay consecrated that's right some of us have had all Faith some of us have given to the poor more than what maybe we should have but God sees all it Hallelujah as long it's done in love God will bless that Hallelujah but Satan's trying to impersonate that and then he does the opposite Satan will not rejo I'm sorry Satan will rejoice in iniquity to try to make people feel liberated when they sin well I've got the I've got the right I've got the Liberty to do this that's Satan if it goes against God's word Satan does not rejoice in the truth s fights the truth with all that he has he will try to fight the truth of God's word hallelujah he wants to deceive people with lies he's the father of lies and Satan will cannot Bear all things right kind kind of goes along with that first one he can't suffer long he can't bear it he can't cover over he's got to make everybody's faults known right he's accused of the Brethren think about that he's doing that in heaven that's what cam was mentioning don't you know that uh cam was hitting that I don't know if we ever got to it but the heavens in one way are spiritually dirty the Bible says that because demons are allowed to go in the in in heaven but the Bible said God is going to purge all of it when all those demons are cussed in Lake of Fire God creates a new Heaven and a new Earth Hallelujah that's right that's what the book of Hebrews says cam mentioned it there I uh and I stepped out a couple times maybe he did preach it but even the heavens in one way are defiled because there's demon powers coming up to accuse you and I thank God we have a high priest thank God we have an advocate who ever lives to make intercession Hallelujah glory to God so Satan won't allow people to believe all things oh just God will never forgive me God will never provide for me uh God will never uh God will never save my loved ones right but God but it's got to be God's will right we got to seek God for his will Satan won't believe all things he won't hope for all things oh my life is just my life is worthless no it's not God has he promised you if he promised Israel hope for a future and an expected end and good things if God provided that for Israel doesn't he provide the same for the Bride of Jesus Christ Satan won't hope for all things he won't let people hope for all things Satan will not let people endure all things he'll try to get them to blaspheme but try to get them to give up and then Satan won't let people have love that never fails again that goes very similar with can endure all things Satan's lives will fail people hallelujah but God's love never fails God's love cannot fail Satan cannot love Hallelujah charity never faileth aren't you glad God's love is still strong for you aren't you glad something is holding you Hallelujah God's love is holding me it never fails Hallelujah but whether there be prophecies they shall fail now that doesn't mean like they're going to fail as far as like true prophecies it just means they'll be fulfilled and then they're no longer right we won't need prophecies at some point whether there be tongues they shall cease we won't have to speak in tongues in heaven because we already have the tongues we need Hallelujah there there will be a universal Heavenly language Hallelujah whether there be knowledge it shall pass away well the Bible tells us to grow in knowledge grow in grace of God hallelujah but you know some at some point you know we won't need more knowledge on this Earth because we won't need to know all things God will make known all things to us now I like what Paul says here for we know in part right now Paul says we know imp part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away with notice he says the perfect hasn't come yet right that we're waiting on the perfect to come Hallelujah but then that when it's come then then that which is in part the human element the time element is done away with when that which is complete comes Hallelujah are you looking forward to the coming of the Lord when he I'll say like that when he which is perfect shall come that which is in part shall be done away with Hallelujah verse 11 when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things Hallelujah and again like that example speaking in tongues is the evidence that's a childish thing I had to move away from that and put that away Hallelujah all these traditions of man from your former churches they got to be put away that's childish real maturity is manifesting the love of God it's it's believing all things it's hoping all things it's enduring all things it's suffering long it's being faithful it's trusting in God it's having God's love anchor your soul to God's word hallelujah I've always told this to Malachi is our manto man talks but when I became a child I'm sorry when when I became a man I put away video games right I put him away don't do that anymore right put away all these sports and entertainment put that away that's all childish things those are uh foolish things I became a man and I put on the maturity of the Holy Spirit endeavoring to express the love of God to every individual but says to the whole world the whole human race Glory the love of God puts away childish things in other words God God's love won't let us be babies he won't let us be immature brother R calls them hotbed plants he said you always got to pet a hot beded plant right he said uh he calls it the hybrid it doesn't have the real genetic makeup like like an original seed hasn't brother said you got to pet that and baby that brother says would you come to church he said you don't got to Baby people to come to church right you got to put away childish things and remember what was the Corinthian childish thing they were arguing about who's the best preacher who baptized me right who uh who's going to pay me back you know uh they're arguing about these little things they were letting the wrong preachers come in right they're hearing the wrong word of God they're totally off the word of God we need to stay focus on the word of God put away childish things let's read that I feel like I should read that just to give you um and there's actually two places yeah let's go to 1 Corinthians 3 verse one I'll just read that I don't have that in my notes but I the second one was just reminded to me 1 Corinthians 3:1 and I Brethren could not speak un you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as babes in Christ I fed you with milk and not with meat for hither to ye were not able to Bear it neither yet now are ye able now brother R will bring this in he'll say look he can't preach predestination to them he can't preach before the foundation of the world to them he can't preach the seals to them Hallelujah verse three for ye are not yet I'm sorry for ye are yet carnal for where and there is among you envy strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men so Paul says we're not supposed to be regular men we're not supposed to act like the people at your work or at the school just regular Sinners we're supposed to walk like Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah we should have a spiritual maturity where we're different and notice what's the verse in there it was Envy the love of God doesn't Envy right see that they're envying the Bible said charity envieth not and divisions so Satan was dividing uh the the church the church didn't have love they didn't have the same love one for another and Paul's saying if Satan's dividing you from doing these things you're still a babe you got to grow up in Christ God help us to put away childish things Hallelujah think about that they were arguing well Isaiah Brooks baptized me is that okay don't beat me up later okay but now push me he say Jesse Smith baptized me Jessie that's right I did baptize you but see that that this is the this is the the devil well I I had brother Brandon baptizing me or brother Brandon makes my he mentions my name on tape what does that have to do with anything anything to do he mentioned a lot of people that turn out to be real scallywag people real Wicked people but that's what they were arguing about that didn't unite them people thought they were better than the others but the love of God makes you humble than others not greater than others it's Satan who makes them babes see dividing verse four so for while one saith I'm a Paul another saith I am Apollos are you not carnal Hallelujah who then is Paul and who is Apollo but ministers by whom you believed even as the lord gave to every man I've always believed that if there's any message believer around the world if they really hunger after God God will send them a preacher right look at God God fornew there be Believers in Aran what' God do send us a preacher God sent me here I didn't ask to come here God sent me here right God sent brother Brooks out to Iowa because there was Believers out there Hallelujah God will give it to every man if somebody really wants to serve God I believe God will raise it up or God allow you to get to some church that has a faithful Pastor God's required to do that would God let a sheep wander around there with a bunch of wolves do you think God would do that as a great Shepherd I don't believe so I think God is faithful to his word and now with Internet it's even better right but I have planted Apollo water but God gave the increase now let's look at verse S now I'm going to get into my message here coming up soon so the then neither is he that planteth anything Nei neither he that WTH but God gave the increase so I'm going to preach on this later but like last week I hope church I hope this is my sincere desire I hope brother cam preached something and if you never heard it before and you received it it was God putting a seed in your heart I also hope if brother cam preached something that I've already preached then brother cam watered what I preached but I know I'm just going to use sister N I know there's last year sister Nomi told me a few things few sermons that blessed her a lot I know the fear of God and some other ones the dancing services and sister Nomi personally told me these were these were important sermons for her so we got to apply that here I hope for everybody there's God has used me to plant some truth in your soul or at least if you already knew it but you grew in it God allowed me to water it but the only way it got gave life was if God gave the increase hallelujah hallelujah that's why God sends the preachers they'll plant a seed in your soul another brother come around and water that but it'll only bring forth when God gives the increase only God can do that does that make sense by God's grace and this is maturity so maturity is receiving the word from a preacher it's God's word it's not the the preacher seed is God's seed and another preacher will water that see that's true that's true here it is more on it more Revelation and then God will cause that to grow in your life Hallelujah here let's look at another uh scripture about the babies in the church uh Hebrews 5 now of course this only applies to teachers Saints it doesn't apply if you're not a preacher this don't apply to you now everyone's required to witness and especially uh I say like this the moms are required to be uh uh the gospel to their children they're required to know the scriptures verse 11 Hebrews 5:11 of whom we have many things to say and hard to be understood seeing you are dull of hearing for when for the time ye ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are be as become having such need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteous for he's a babe so when preachers don't go deeper in the things of God the people remain babies spiritual babies and that will cause divisions in the church whether it's suing or sexual sin or something like like those lists that we have here it's going to be one of those let me pull that up there I'm on slide 58 can I find that one yeah it's going to be one of these the babies babies will be divided they won't have love love one for another babies will have sexual morality they'll be suing each other getting drunk and using substance abuse and pride about their superiority Pride with their gifts or Pride uh not generous and they'll love false teachers that's baby Christianity but God said put away childish things and be mature in Christ Jesus Hallelujah but strong meat belongeth to them who are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil Hallelujah the good and the evil praise God God help us all right where was I at yeah put away childish things so God's love as we mature we put away childish lust childish uh Temptations and sins like this we must put it away by the grace of God verse 12 for now we see through a glass Darkly that's a Looking Glass in the old days they looking glasses they weren't as nice as we have now so it's like he said now we're looking through a glass but then face to face so right now we don't see God face to face he said but one day we will see Jesus face to face right now I know in part I have a partial understanding but then shall I know even as God knows me how many believe that God knows the very depths of your soul God knows if you let him he'll search the very depth of your soul he'll bring out things that need to be fixed and he'll he'll reward you for the things you've done right but he wants to search every heart today Hallelujah God knows us intimately Hallelujah and now abideth faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity see having all faith is a good thing Hallelujah we need more of that Hallelujah having all faith is a good thing we need more of that but greater than all these is to have the love of Jesus Christ charity in our souls I'm going to try to close this I'm almost to my time there I thought I'd close a little sooner there's at least six reasons love is greater than Faith and Hope love fulfills the whole law Faith doesn't fulfill the whole law hope doesn't fulfill the whole law love does owe no man anything but to love one another I owe you brother Mercy right sister Haven I owe you what do you what Daddy what do you owe me God's love that's what I owe you Hallelujah we should look at that I owe my brother I owe my sister I owe them something I owe them love I need to pay them their God's love that I love that beautifully spoken by the word of God here for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law remember the bad thing about the law the bad thing about the law was that you're curse if you didn't keep all of it the law is good it tells us right from wrong the law is Holy but the curse of the law is that if you break one you're guilty the whole but Jesus became the curse the curse was put on Jesus that the blessing might come upon us verse 10 love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law when you just want to be good to your neighbor you ever done that before just mowed a little bit of your neighbor's yard or ra a little bit of your neighbor neighbor leaves just to be good to them or picked up some of their trash ever done that that's love love only wants good for your neighbor I'm talking about the Neighbors in your seats too love is the Fulfillment of God's law love if you have love it fulfills everything you know you passed the test God's giv you Grace to overcome Hallelujah the second reason love is eternal see there's going to come a time we won't need Faith anymore Faith is a revelation right we won't need it's a revelation of the will of God we at one point we won't need a revelation that we'll know God's will to live eternally and we'll have to hope am I going to make it am I going to live forever like we'll we'll we'll we'll know it by God's grace Hallelujah we'll have eternal life Hallelujah but one thing that's Eternal is the love of God see when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away all these things that are temporary based on temporary things they will eventually end but love has no end because love had no beginning God is love third love is the greatest expression of God's character beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is God is love and if you're born of God you will love your brother and sister with all those 16 attributes 16 attributes now what is 16 here's my numerology I think it's a double portion because Elijah did eight Miracles and God said Elijah said I want a double portion he did 16 Miracles so that's just one that's just one I could be wrong that's that's my only guess right now 16 is a double portion that's my guess so see love is the greatest expression of God's character because that is God's essence he is love so see when when someone says I know God or I know the message you'll see it by their actions do they love their enemies do they love the unlovable number four love is also the greatest commandment Master which is the great commandment in the law Jesus saith unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is lik UN to it that Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself number five love is what is the root of faith and works and even hope right the Bible says faith which works by love so the whole the whole beginning if you ever had Faith to be saved the whole beginning is God gave you some of his love this holy spirit's in you that's the love of God it's an attribute of the love of God I love God because he first loved me and purchased my salvation on calvary's tree Hallelujah is that right amen I love God because he first loved me and then if you have love love will motivate your faith and faith will get to work Hallelujah theam says faith is Works expressed Hallelujah I'm sorry works is Faith expressed sorry got out works are Faith expressed and that all comes from love love Faith Works finally Love In Action is the greatest Victory there is there's three men in this Parable I actually preached this par par very briefly on Wednesday night the oil and the wine the man asked him you know what's the greatest commandment Jesus says uh to love God with all your heart soul mind strength he said unto him uh I'm sorry the man answered that he said thou Hast answered right Jesus said this do and thou shalt live but he willing to justify himself said unto Jesus who is my name neighbor now I think it's interesting I'm not saying this is exactly thus sayi the Lord but there's three people that passed by this wounded man there's three we know this we know the Good Samaritan has to be love because the question is about love Hallelujah the question is on well who's my neighbor how do I love my neighbor how do I express the love of God and first a priest comes by if anybody knows how to get this guy clean it's the priest he knows what sacrifices need made he's he's got faith in I I I just type him as Faith he knows what God wants done with his word but Faith sees it and it goes to the other side of the street I'm not touching that with a 50-foot Pole right so Faith wasn't enough he had Faith to offer the sacrifices Faith to pray the next man the levite comes the levite was they had the sacred utensils they cleaned the utensils they kept Everything clean they scrubbed it they put water on it uh they got the loaves the bread ready we t talked about they open and shut the gates so these are the men that would say I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God than dwell in the tents of the wicked preach that on Wednesday right Hallelujah better is one day in his courts than a thousand elsewhere Hallelujah they would also sing all the sacred hins of the temple and they would do many other things so these I I type these out to hope they were right next to the priest and they had hope that God heard all the prayers they sang the songs they opened the doors but this man also goes to the other side of the street but then comes we say Jesus then comes the Good Samaritan the Jews always look down on the Samaritans right so here's a guy who really doesn't he's not a good guy we call him the Good Samaritan but to the Jews he was an awful guy and he comes on him and he says here's what's wrong and I can fix it Hallelujah that's what the love of God does here's a broken individual this person's almost dead I'll do whatever it takes to bring them back to life Hallelujah it'd be much easier to forget about it bypass on the other side of the road it'd be much easier to follow the religious Realms like that but the love of God had to be expressed Hallelujah and God's love filled the Samaritan's heart and he says I'll pour in oil I'll give you what you need right now and then I'll give you what you have need for the future Amen brother Braham said it's God giving him two pence he Tak him to the inkeeper that's the spirit and truth and he says if I owe you anything I'll give it to you when I come back oh when Jesus comes back he'll have rewards for you if you ever did something for Jesus he'll reward you at the rasher the meeting in the air Hallelujah let's stand to our feet Hallelujah musicians can come you you'll be guaranteed that if you ever did anything for Jesus he'll reward you when he comes back to get you I'm going to read this quote and then I'll be done you might remember this adoption 1960 that's what bothers me to preach to you people don't remain on in the same condition you've been going in change now so let's bow our heads here what condition have we been going in church I hope you're on that upward Arc like I preached on a few weeks ago is your life going upward closer to God with more love and yes you should have Faith and Hope too but love should be the greatest motivator with our heads bowed are we on the in the right condition we should be in he says hear me say it thus sayith the Lord I've never called myself this I'm not but you call me your Prophet or a prophet the world believes that the world around millions of millions of people I've spoken directly indirectly to 10 or 12 million people or more directly speaking I've seen tens of thousands of visions and signs and wonders not one of them ever failed he's for told me things that's never that's never happened I'm sorry it's never failed to happen just exactly I'll bring any man to trial for that that's right I don't claim to be a prophet but you listen to me thus sayith the Lord it'll take you what church perfect what perfect love to put you in that place he's talking about beyond the curtain of time brother calls it the sixth Dimension you might call it uh Paradise for that's all there was there no matter what money how much religious demonstrations how many Good Deeds you've done or whatever You' done that won't count nothing on that day it'll take perfect love so whatever you do you lay aside it anything else until you're just so filled with the love of God so you can love those who hate you doesn't love bear all things doesn't love believe all things let's pray Heavenly Father Lord you see the conditions of our hearts today Lord the Bible says our hearts are like open before you they're naked before you Lord you see our Our Lives Dear God God lord I've been wanting to preach this sermon here for few months Lord God and I just trust it was a blessing to someone Lord God it was a blessing to me to remind me about the love of God thank you God for sharing your love with us we know Satan can't love even one of those 16 attributes he can't do one of them help us Lord to love one another because that's how the Disciples of Christ are known by love [Music] Lord if anyone needs 1 Corinthians 13 is the Bride of Jesus Christ we've seen spoken word power I've seen mountains move I believe the mysteries of God are finished Lord God as brother random said completely finished completely revealed [Music] Lord what I need what everyone in our church needs is the love of God and it will take God to do it so Lord Jesus help us today Father God help us to look at the condition that we're in Lord if we're in need of love in our souls Lord God we know what to do we know Jesus liking us to a house and if we if someone has bound up our faith faith if our faith is dormant if we're not in the right condition we have to expose the enemy we have to repent of our sins call upon the name of the Lord for deliverance and when we do that Lord the love of God and we really mean it to repent of our sins our iniquities when we really mean it the love of God comes into our soul and it casts out fear perfect love casts out fear cast out any sin whether it's puffed up whether it's Envy whether it's childish things Lord God divisions lust of the flesh lust of the eyes the love of God will cast out the sin thank you Lord God for the truth of your word Lord God [Music] hallelujah so God help us to look at the condition of our lives today may we leave here in a better condition than when we came Lord God this preaching was not in vain our songs were not in vain the song specials were not in vain but it's producing a Christlike character [Music] hallelujah it's producing Lord this Bread of Heaven it's producing the quickening power hallelujah thank you Lord God quickening power to overcome the Ws of Satan thank you Lord God making us ready for your coming Lord God we thank you for your love and your mercy thank you for showing us it takes the love of God to accomplish anything Lord let each of those 16 attributes abide in our soul lord God oh God let our condition be pleasing to you in Jesus Christ
