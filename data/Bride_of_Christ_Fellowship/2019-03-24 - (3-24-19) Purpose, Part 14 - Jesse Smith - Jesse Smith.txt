three I just turned us on Lydia so hopefully that's okay is that Alright okay thank you thank you for all your prayers you know we've had three weeks of sickness and my wife has basically nursed everybody back to health she just got a little sick and I got a little bit more sick I think the worst might have been one of the little ones but we had to cancel Wednesday so very sorry about that but we're glad to be back and just want to thank God for anointing my wife was such a powerful anointing to minister to eight other sick people other than ourselves so that's where you know you really see the strength and love of motherhood and that's why God has called women to be such wonderful and faithful servants praise God they're just so strong and they're just so faithful like that and we thank God for all the mother's praise God that raised us and helped us and strengthen us and such a support for us Ecclesiastes chapter like to read the first few verses Lord willing uh we'll get through maybe verses 1 2 & 3 this morning please I'm sorry cleese chapter 3 verse 1 let's read verse 1 together then i'll read verses 2 & 3 verse 1 ready 1 2 3 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven now read verse 2 a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up amen let's just have a word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart just making known unto God here as we bow our heads and ask the Holy Spirit to minister to us Heavenly Father we were grateful Lord to be in your house Lord this is your house father come and dwell thank you Lord that your spirits here Lord we certainly feel it Lord God and that same spirit that was in Christ dwells in us you know quicken us Laura at the first resurrection and that's the resurrection Lord we want to be a part of for everyone we'll be a part of the second but Lord there'll be a small group that's a part of the first and Oh God may the Holy Spirit dwell in us today Lord God in such a powerful way as a seal Lord that will be raised at the first resurrection raised or changed Lord bodies that will be swallowed up in life dear God that's our prayer help us to recognize the time and season that we're living in Lord God and father we pray Lord God that your

diligent faithful soldiers Lord until you come so anoint us with that sweet spirit today afresh in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god bless you be in see the praise God so like to look at this thought here god bless you brother Vann good to see you sir let's look at times and seasons I'm sorry let's look at just purpose again I do have just a few scriptures or quotes rather and scriptures that go through about times and seasons but I don't think the whole sermon will be on times and seasons that's why I didn't really give it that title but that doesn't matter so I like to start with a few quotes on times and seasons and then we'll get to this please the essays chapter 3 I want to start going through these 14 times in seasons we preach recently how in the 14 seasons there's there opposite seasons but there are also complementary seasons so in other words there's natural applications but there's also spiritual applications I think we'll be able to start those this morning if the Lord will help us here how many happy be in the house of Lord this morning nowhere else I'd rather be praise God than be in God's house so we're happy to be here so we read our text here now we actually did verses 1 2 3 but I want to go back to these times and seasons for a moment and get through a few more quotes as I said quotes from God's prophet so brother Branham is preaching a prophet of God and he's teaching about how the two different vines bring forth their fruit in different seasons so if you have your Bible let's go to you thirteen so you know that when brother branham was preaching on this he was preaching from the bible so jesus preached this in matthew 13 so let's go there and let's look at the interpretation of the two vines or the two seeds so Jesus says in the last days there's gonna be two different seeds there's gonna be a weekly and a tare seat all right and both live off the same anointing so these seeds these vines have to be both proposed claiming to be Christian churches right because the Muslim has no part with the Holy Spirit right they don't they don't want Jesus's anointing they want allows anointing and all Allah is no God right because the Muslim faith is the second largest in the world I mean oh there's 1.8 Muslims in the world but there's over 2 billion Christians and the Catholic Church makes up 1.3 billion of those and then the Protestants are not even a billion so if you were eat it in the scripture here this is referring to the true church as the wheat and the false church as tears but both live off the same anointing so let's go if you would to verse 36 because here's the interpretation 13:36 then Jesus sent the multitude away went to the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare nos the parable of the tares of the field the answer said to them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed of the children of the kingdom but the tares the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is into the world and the Reapers are the Angels as therefore the tares are gathered and burned the fire so shall it be in the end of this world the Son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and then which do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there should be wailing and gnashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the Sun in the kingdom of their father who hath ears to hear let him hear now that's the interpretation of us let's go back now I kind of show it wanted you to see the symbols or the the the interpretation of the symbols now let's go read the parable so it's in verse 24 Matthew 13:24 another parable put he forth him saying the kingdom of heaven is like in a man which sowed good seed in his field but while he slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way now let's stop right there everybody knows I hope you know that a tear is a weed but it looks exactly like the wheat seed it looks exactly the same and they both look the same until harvest time and at harvest time will bow but the tear will just stand straight up and it won't bow to the Sun and that you know of course we don't Paul said we bow our knees to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ of whom all heaven and earth is named praise God so the true children of God bow to the commands of the Lord Jesus Christ whereas the false church that air will not bow they won't obey all the commands of the Bible and yet they'll still claim to be wheat they'll so claim to be the true church they'll even look like the church so they'll go to a Christian Church they'll sing Christian songs but their lives will not bow and obey the Word of God and so see there's two there's two seeds here that there's two different vines we're talking about and Jesus said they'll go all the way to the end time he said angels don't don't pull them up now because you might pull up a good one when you pull up the bad one because it's hard for the angels that - no he said let them both grow together until the harvest time and then the angels will gather they'll gather the tear burn them and then the wheat will be gathered in heaven for the marriage supper of the Lamb praise God but we see from the parable now we go to verse 26 but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also so the servants of the householder came and said him Sir didst not thou sow good seed in thy field for whence then hath the tares and he said an enemy have done this the servants said unto Him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tares you rude up also the wheat with them let both grow together into the harvest and the time of the harvest I'll say to the Reapers gather you together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn amen a church this is why we were we're happy with being a small Church because as a small Church we're not part of any denomination because we know all denominations once they write their bylaws and they say this is how God this is how God works right there the Holy Spirit leaves them because they've limited God they put God in a box but God will not be contained in a man-made box praise the Lord he's not gonna be contained he's the Holy One of Israel he's the one who won't be limited he's the unlimited God and so God has left every denomination he left the Catholic first then he left the Lutheran then he left the Methodist and then he left the Presbyterian and the Nazarene and then he left the Pentecostal and so where is God today he's not a denomination but he's in a small group of people called his bride and with what we are claiming to be a part of a bride but all the other ones who claim to who stay in denomination and they live in dead churches that's what we believe those dead churches are this false mind and God is calling them in love God is saying come out of that system come out don't be a terror praise God if you're a real weak you won't be in terror you'll act like a wheat you'll act like I'm sorry won't act like a terror act like a real wheat seed amen you'll bow you'll love the word you obey the Bible you'll live the Bible amen if you're a real wheat seed of God hallelujah and so that's what brother Branham is talking about here he said the true vine of the false vine both had the same anointing so see even in false churches they can have good anointings people can get healed people can have spiritual dreams and things like that he said the water fell on both of them no wonder he warned us it would to see the very elected if it was possible notice they look they're saying they're anointed the same he said by their fruit how do you how'd you know it oranges in the orange because it's berry a grapefruit the vine is alright it's living in the tree but it's burying a grapefruit it isn't like the first one if the church says they believe Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but denies power and denies works and denies word the church that believes in Jesus Christ will do the works of Jesus Christ hallelujah it'll have the life of Jesus Christ and if it isn't no matter if the life is pouring into it if it isn't predestinated from the roots it will bear great fruit every time or something different but if it's the predestinated life in the roots it'll bear Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if it's the word coming up through the route which he is the route the beginning of time notice it's it's what they produce that tells the difference so you'd have to look at our lives you have to if you didn't know which church was the right church you have to watch you have to watch amens life or bang's life you have to watch Aaron's life or my life or my wife you have to watch what is our life produce does it produce the same life of Jesus Christ or not amen then you have to take like a denominational Church and look at their life this their life produce a life that looks like Jesus Christ and that's the only way to know because jesus said by their fruit or by their actions you shall know them that's right he says man does not gather grapes of a thistle even though that this will be right in the grapevine that could be possible but the fruit will tell it what is fruit the word for the fruit season that's what it is they're teaching the teaching of what the teaching of the season what time it is men's doctrine denomination doctrine or or God's word for the season amen hallelujah now if you got your Bibles let's just go to 2nd Timothy 2 all right second Timothy 3 here let me show you what exactly what the Bible says the false churches will be preaching I'll just put it up here because I I didn't put it I didn't put it on my slides so here all these descriptions and how many words I think I've preached it on a sermon lately wasn't there 16 of these lovers at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 okay 19 19 that's right yeah I preached up to 19 I think no I stopped at 17 I can't remember I'm sorry anyways there's 19 19 that repeats there now look at here here's what the Bible says this is what the teachings from false churches will be false churches will allow these sins can embrace amen because Paul said no this also in the last times last days perilous troublesome times shall come for men should be lovers of their own selves that's the first thing that false churches will have they will love themselves more than they love God they'll be covetous they'll want the things of other people more than they want God there'll be boasters they'll brag about themselves rather than bragging on Jesus let me tell you churches there's anything good about you right it's only because of Jesus Christ I'm not taking credit for the book oh you're not taking credit for the healing you know anything good that ever happened this church none of us are taking any credit it's all Jesus amen we're just thanking God for what God's done amongst us amen proud so that means they went their own way remember pride pride is the opposite of humility humility is taking God's weight humbling yourself pride is doing your own thing how many churches allow people to do whatever they want and don't tell me what the word says they'll blaspheme which is speak evil of real churches they'll blaspheme God's name they'll blasting true churches true believers they'll blasting them speak evil against their name they'll be disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers they'll break their promises especially marriages right they'll get divorced from this one divorce from that one and let them remarry that's evil that's adultery a minute truce breakers they can't keep their word false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good so they'll speak they'll speak good of evil churches but they'll speak bad of good churches traitors they'll betray you heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God they'll watch March Madness more than they'll watch God's Word amen Church or Super Bowl or World Series or video games or whatever you want to say right or movies well that way they'll love that more than they'll love God God should be our first love amen and if we love God the love of the world should pass away hallelujah when I was a child I did those things but when I became a man I put away those things amen spiritually see they have a form of godliness they go to church they might even sing about Jesus but they denied the cleansing power of the gospel they men so see that's that's exactly what the Word of God said for this surah they which creep into houses and lead captives silly women letter laden with sins and led away with diverse lusts see they go into people's houses these false churches and they let the people have whatever they want as long as they come to church you can keep living in sin you can keep loving sin as long as you come to church they ever learned but are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth and what is the truth jesus said thy Word is truth alright now let me show you the Antichrist in 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 I was just talking with a friend this week about this it just became fresh to me again so let's go let's go to 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 okay here just yeah second Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 10 if you have time read the whole chapter if it's if you're unfamiliar with it but this whole chapter is about the Antichrist so the Antichrist is going to be the head of the false churches and denominations but Christ is going to be a head of the true church and he already is praise God aim ahead he already is the head of this church amen because his word rules amen now look what so Satan let me actually go to verse 9 even him whose coming is after the working of Satan that's the Antichrist the Antichrist has powers after Satan it's after his leadership with all power and signs and lying wonders so the false church will have power and lie but some of their signs and wonders will be lies there won't be real miracles but see that all the people all the nations will get caught up in that well they've got miracles they must be of God and we believe that we'll be led by the Roman Catholic Church and all the Protestant churches that will follow them now look here's how they deceive people Church they deceive them with unrighteousness in them that perish so they're gonna let them live unrighteous sinful lives see and that list that I just read you in 2nd Timothy 3 that's part of the list there to let them be prideful trucebreakers liars they let them just love the things of the world as long as you come to our church you're still saved that's the nothing but a bold-faced lie when you're saved the Bible said you died a sin praise God when you Jesus Christ really saves your soul then you're dead to all the things in the world and all you want to do is feast on God's Word all the time amen that's right but see this is how he deceives and through sinful things unrighteousness and then that perish why because they love not the truth so they didn't know really really what the Bible said they didn't really love what the Bible said that they might be saved because this God is going to send them a strong delusion God is going to send them a lying spirit the a lie don't let that stumble you God did that in the days of my kya and Ahab right God said who will go before who will go for me and who will be a deceiving lying spirit in in the mouth of Ahab in the prophets and a lying spirit said I'll do it before you God and God said go ahead that right God allowed a lying spirit to going to see they have and this it's the reason why because God knew he didn't want to believe the Prophet hey hey man glory the real man of God God knew Ahab wouldn't believe my kiya no matter how much preaching that prophet did and told him the truth God knew he wouldn't believe it so he said fine who are going to see they have because they have wants to be deceived anyway and a lying spirit said I'll go and God said go the same thing is repeating today who will hear God's prophet today amen who will hear the Word of God today you and I will hear the word of God and if we don't if you don't then you'll just receive a lying spirit because God this God if you do the same thing right here God will send that God sends them a lying spirit and they believe a lie that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness now that sounds pretty rough doesn't it but it depends how you look at it God has to be rough because God has already said John 3:16 for God so loved God's love was trying to send them listen to the Prophet listen to the word God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish God doesn't want people to perish and that's why sent prophets that's why I sent a prophet in our day amen here does it weren't the unit perish that they might have everlasting life praise God but because they won't receive it God has no other choice but to give them over to a lie but God tried God's live sent a man of God preaching the Word of God God always saves men and women by preaching men oh so I'm glad to be here today hallelujah because somebody can be saved today amen because that's what God's preaching does God anoints a man to save men and women hallelujah with the spirit that they might believe the truth that they might be saved amen hallelujah but we're bound to give thanks always to God for you brethren beloved of the Lord how many know God calls you his beloved God loves you Church you're his beloved beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth that reminds me real quick I just want to go over this honey remember when Daniel prayed three weeks I remember that he's like God hear our prayers he was confessing his sin he was confessing his dad said Daniel was confessing the nation said he was confessing everybody sins for three weeks and what's the first thing that you just said he said fear not he said because your but you're very much beloved in heaven ah oh ma and if Daniel was beloved in heaven under the blood of bulls and goats what about you and I under the blood of God's Son Jesus Christ amen hallelujah but see we got to seek God like Daniel sought God we got to be devoted to God like Daniel was devoted to God and that's how we become the beloved of God amen see because God has chosen you God chose to save you through sanctification of the Spirit that means cleaning you up through the Holy Spirit and believing the truth hallelujah thank the Lord so let me go back to this quote now here what is their fruit then it's their teaching it's not their miracles and their anointing that's not the real fruit the prophet said the fruit is the teaching that actually impacts their life right it's the teaching what do they teach the teaching of what he said it must be God's Word for the season that's right now I want to go to the next thought there's a couple more thoughts I want to get through here brother Graham said the rapture is the Firefall season let me know that now go to Revelation 8 here this is this is scriptural and I've had different preachers preaching here it's been a while now but the seven seals in Revelation chapter 8 which we believe is the day and hour of the rapture according to many many quotes by brother Branham now I think it's striking look at revelation 8 verse 1 and when he'd open the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space a half hour because that Lord and Savior is coming down to redeem his bride amen and he done left heaven hallelujah he's going down to meet his wife in the air for the wedding ceremony Lori and I saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them were given the seven trumpets verse three and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto Him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of the Saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers the Saints ascended up before god out of the angel's hands amen look how god's listening to your prayers church never get discouraged God hears your prayers verse five and the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the altar and cast it into the earth and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings an earthquake the seven trumpets which had them seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound now I want to read this quote and I got a video for you because I found at Yosemite National Park where the fire falls I think that's what brother Moran was talking about one time and a couple of his stories so I want to show it to you in just a little bit so let's read the quote from invisible Union where the prophet of God is talking about this now before closing one time I was up in Glacier National Park we heard all day long they had a fall a glacier fire that was going to fall at night so the people was busy all day long getting that thing ready because they was going to pour that fire out that night they put a liquid fireballs like a great glacier water but it looked like a rainbow almost when it comes out of the fire falling out of this glacier all around through the park wife and nine children walked around through the day we want to stay we want to stay to see that fire exhibition it was promised that we would see it and we witnessed it again they said they have it ever through the summer season so forth I said well will we be able to see it now the one I found he says Glacier National Park I looked it up I couldn't quite find which park that was so I have a video it may be the same thing it may be something different but it's the same thing in one way because fires falling I think you'll see what I'm saying in just a few minutes all right so just bear with me and so we promised it tonight we're promised that they were up there getting it ready now and after and after all had been made ready for the event that's what's taking place right now all has been med raid ready for the event a church being called pulled out for his namesake taking his bride out from amongst the world these denominations and all the world and the filth and things of the world so brother ham is typing of the rapture as them getting ready they're making ready all day for the fire to fall and brother man said that's what's happening now the church is being made ready for the fire to fall amen everybody the event was ready everybody was standing out they said now keep watching right up to the top of the mountain there that's the way I always come that's the way it's come this time that's the way it always comes not through denomination never did God use the denomination never so we're in a pretty good spot here our chances of receiving the fire from heaven our super increased because we're not in a denomination amen because God never did use a denomination he didn't use the Pharisee denomination the Sadducees the Herodian God didn't use any of those he uses a group of small called out humble little people that love his word amen the reformer goes forth he gets the word of the Lord and then when he dies they build a denomination out of it that's what the Pentecostals and all did and when the new issues everything that's just the way that's the way the thing come out a new word added and they build a church out of it made in denominations separate themselves it had to be that way now you can't beat nature nature falls in the same routine all the time stalk leave tassel so forth shucks then the wheat now notice all was ready everything had been kindled and made ready and everybody was saying I had my head sticking up my arm around my wife we was looking up and the children sitting there all of us looking up like that my was something because we was expecting it it was promised us so he's typing this to the rapture all day long they're gathered as a family and we're all excited that fire is going to fall we've been promised to receive the fire fall and he's saying that's how the church should be we should all be like a big family amen with our arms around one another say God promised it the fire is going to fall hey and we're all gathered together like a family we're not divided the body of Christ should be united amen amen the word promises this it shall come to pass before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come behold I'll send you elijah the prophet he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the father's it shall come to pass in the last days I'll pull out my spirit from on high the former and the latter rain shall come together in the last days so this fire represents the latter rain rapturing bathe amen all these promises through the Scriptures been given we're looking upward watch at the true bride across the nation this hour looking up church he is coming one of these days just as sure as he come the first time he's coming again get everything ready separate yourself from shucks lay before the Sun keep looking up be under expectation and all at once we heard something from the top of the hill a voice came down to the live loudspeakers saying all things already then this man standing right up there by the side of me said let the fire fall here it come pouring down across the mountain a glacier of fire and a blazes of licking he sent a sight to behold glory now bear with me here let me play his video here I got it saved under my photos I saved it a few weeks ago I was gonna preach it last week but as the Holy Spirit moved I never got to it well I've taken a lot of pictures since that and then haven't I that's all my student pictures I take a picture of the class and I give it out to the parents well where'd it go there is the fire phone alright here let me go back and read that I'm sorry it says a rare phenomenon known as a fire fall is back at Yosemite National Park in California the visual display happens when the light hits a waterfall which makes it appear as if fire is flowing down the rocks you get to be here and see whatever nature gives us I think one of the most exciting experiences I ever had in this in this particular spot is when the light finally showed and only showed the very top of the falls and the forest erupted with people applauding and cheering whistling you know it was a happy place to be alright and that's the end of that so what'd you think of that your semi National Park people waiting around and said and these workers say the most exciting thing is when the fire starts falling people don't know they're waiting around and all of a sudden it falls and you see the glory of God and that's what the rapture is gonna be the glory of God falling striking the church again amen glory he said brother let's get all things ready for one of these days the fire is going to fall we're going up now let's get ready for the fire falling time we're in the last days we all know that we're ready for the coming of the Lord the thing to do is separate yourself from all sin separate yourself from anything that pertains in the world don't love the world or the things of the world let no man by his kree deceive you you stay right straighten the promise of God the Word of God and that word if it's a word for this day God vincit Eights it so if he doesn't it's not the word for this day alright everybody understand that now Oh see when I saw a video I'm like Firefall brother branham said firefall it struck me and then the says it is well it's connected with the seventh seal amen loretta said get everything ready this is the last month before he passed away this is the November 65 at the invincible Union saying the fire is gonna fall get everything ready cuz one day the Holy Ghost is gonna fall in a great way hey man thank God and we read this notice the fire falls before the seven trumpets blow the seven trumpets blow in the tribulation but the fire falls before that and all right we already read that so I'm not gonna read that all right you can race amen to that they like that praise the Lord now this is the last season quoting then we'll get to the Ecclesiastes chapter three this is the season we're all looking forward to the season of a new body I just want to read these last quotes here he says but those who sometimes their soul is saved and this old body still belongs to Satan and he knows it'll take it at the end time he'll crush it and send it back to the bugs of the earth will crawl into it and eat it up but he'll never touch that soul for it's the precious treasure of God did you know that God considers your soul the treasure the Bible said we have treasures in earthen vessels praise the Lord that's why God can allow you no accidents you might lose a finger you might lose an arm you know we wondered well how could God do that because God looks at your soul and your soul is what he treasures most he wants your soul to be a repentant soul a saved soul praise God a soul that loves God that loves the word that's his treasure is a soul that has his own nature amen and through that life out of that leaf it returns back to God who will give it will come forth in the next season with the new body that Satan can never touch a man Olivia oh brother bang Satan can touch this body candy he can make this sick but he'll never touch that next body ain't I he has no right to touch that one hallelujah and thank God he can't touch my soul either hallelujah because the blood of Jesus Christ has sealed us all of the believer amen he'll never touch the new body he says that's the next season that we go in to praise God neither can our old age or anything else touch it it'll be a glorified body we're looking for that Lord bless thy people now we're so glad to know that this is just not bring the people together for something in vain that has been proven the greatest reality the world has ever known that the Son of God is not dead who made the promises but is alive among us forevermore and we're so happy this morning Lord above all things that we own the world and could be young I'm sure though we could own the world and could be young for hundreds of years to enjoy it but it would be only a season compared to what's the time that's laid up for those who love Him oh my so we're trying to point our brother and sister to this great hour that's approaching us and as we see that time coming Lord our hearts burn we want to make ready praise God all right now see I'm finished now with all those times and seasoned quotes I'm ready to move on to clean sea chapter three how many like that that's about four good services on just programs quotes on times in season and I hope you can see God's times and seasons today can you see it I can see it because the false churches are teaching people to sin there they're teaching shows what their fruit really is inside their lives and it's corrupt fruit now let's get to this in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 there's 14 different seasons I think tonight or this morning rather we'll have time to just do the first three here and that's okay because I think I'm only studied up to number for Easterns are all fresh so they take extra extra time to research and each you know research each one and make sure it's exactly right these are the real time-consuming ones but they're also rich ones too so remember there's 14 opposite seasons but they're also complementary in the spiritual there's a season to be born die plant pluck up kill and heal break down build up weep and laugh mourn dance cast gather stones embrace refrain from embracing get a time to lose time to keep a time to cast away a time to rent something and a time to show something a time to keep silent or speak a time for love or hate and a time for war and a time for peace alright so let's look at each one of these can we do that for a few minutes here by God's grace let me uh set a little timer here now I put those lines in here so you can see I'm just let's just look at born and die for a few minutes okay that's a good these here now of course it's easy to see how these are just opposite seasons being born and dying right because I just use brother Graham's dates you know he was born at night you know nine and he died in 1965 everybody can see how that's that makes sense that that's that's understandable right that's common we all know that but you know as you look at more scriptures God determines when you're born and God determines when you die right now there's times where God lets some people live a little longer than he wanted because he's merciful and there's times that God takes him a little early before that he wanted them to go right so God is flexible in that because he's trying to show mercy God has to God has to prove to people listen I was long-suffering I gave you a choice I extended mercy to you and if you enter the wrong thing I gave you what you wanted even though you didn't want the right thing I was merciful because no man or woman who ever to say and say God you are merciful you didn't have patience with me you weren't long-suffering God will be able to say I was long-suffering to all mankind amen in other words God's not gonna force anybody to do what he wants he's gonna give in an option he'll give you the choice but then he'll be merciful and long-suffering in the midst of it all right but now the spiritual which this is exciting because this may happen for some people today you never know when someone's gonna be willing to die that they might be booked again amen so see this is beautiful because this is so inspired by the Holy Spirit because there's natural opposite season with them their spiritual season closely tied together and and if not I think you understand about in this sermon here by the grace of God so let's look at the opposites again Paul says and God is made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and has determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation so God determined we'd live here in Akron in 2019 God determined the times the time you I was born you were born because job says who can bring a clean one of an unclean not one seeing his days are determined and the number of his months are with thee thou has appointed his bounds that he cannot pass so there's a certain boundary that we can't pass like with Hezekiah God said okay yeah I would have rather have you die now and come home to heaven he said I'll give you 15 more years but you're not going to pass that 15 more years they were understanding that he should have died 15 years earlier God wanted him to go home but because he cried out he lived a life of integrity God said fine I'll give you the permissive will of God but God said you're not going beyond 15 years and church he didn't go one day beyond 15 years right because you cannot go beyond the boundary that God has determined right Exodus 30 23 25 and ye shall serve the Lord your God he shall bless thy bread and thy water hey that's my prayer god bless my bread and water and I'll take sickness away from the midst of thee amen there's nothing cast there young nor be barren in thy land the number of thy days I will fulfill see God promises I will fulfill all your days so you ever write if you feel that of the Holy Spirit like Satan's trying to take your life early you have a right to claim this and say no Satan I'm still got years to fulfill all the years God promised me amen and you might not know the years but God does you understand God said you are going to fulfill all the years that I've determined and you've got to write to stand there as they say and move back in Jesus Christ's name God giving me more than this because you believe it you don't know the number but you believe God has more years for you now I believe this at the time when we're you know if we have to go through the grave of God Terry's 100 more years and I have to go to the grave I believe God will so if we pray and see God I believe God will show us he'll give us peace to know in a life-threatening disease he'll give us peace to know whether this is it's time to take us or whether it's it's time to heal us and then through that anointing we'll be able to speak God's Word and say no Satan it's not time for me to go or we'll be able to say Lord I see your hand in this it's my time to go let me set my house in order before I go praise the Lord hallelujah he said but the number of your days I will fulfil how many glad to be still be fulfilling your days I am I'm so glad the Lord gave us these days now David says so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts on new wisdom help us to remember Lord that we're mortal and if you tell me we're going to have to die so let me use wisdom to know that what I should do on this Sunday and what you should do is doing what you're doing here in God's Word that's wisdom it would have been foolish to skip the house of God or to miss the preaching of God's Word because the preaching of God words is what builds you up in words of faith amen and so wisdom is what brought you here to the house of God this morning and not just some other silly event now let's switch over now now let's switch over to this spiritual I mean oh Jesus said you must be born again so he says you must don't marvel at this you must be born again and member Jesus said God said there's a time to die and there's a time to be born so if Jesus said there's a time to be born spiritually then there must also be a time to die spiritually amen hallelujah because there's a season to be born there's got to be a season to die and Romans tells us this god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein on that beautiful church now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him amen now this is why foolish version is called foolish by the Bible in Jesus is because she refuses to die for her love for the world praise God even if it's just one little sin like the rich young ruler he didn't love anything else except money and that kept him from being a part of the missionary fivefold ministry of Jesus Christ can I just say like that so he kind of relates to today he didn't want to sell out office riches give to the poor and follow Jesus Christ so Jesus said okay you're not gonna be born again right he wouldn't die out for the things of the world so Jesus says you must be born again and Paul said the only way that you're alive with Christ as if you died with Christ praise God does that help by God's grace like we know like a regular C to C must rot and once that seeds Lots in the ground then it springs forth life it's got a rock it's gotta have like a dying point and then it's got to have like all of a sudden a change where that little root breaks up and one goes up and one goes down and it just starts that like that growth praise God amen so see if there's a burner the spiritual birth there's got to be a spiritual death first because every Christian that's born again is dead to sin now I love this this struck me like a ton of bricks I was listening to a preacher preaching he quoted scripture I was like I forgot about all this this whole time I forgot yeah I feel it here yeah just as a preacher I feel like I could put I wish I could preach every scripture every service you know so but I know it all comes in season because I'm in preaching on seasons look at this nevertheless the foundation of God standeth so what is God's foundation guy's foundation has a seal on it the Lord knows then that are his to see we have to worry oh is God gonna save the Aborigines in Australia is not going to save other people out in Hudson and all these people that don't they're not part of Western civilization can God save them Church God's church has the seal that God knows all them that are his Amon all that are meant to be saved all that he knows will receive salvation will be saved amen that's God's foundation hallelujah amen and but that I love this Isle I know yeah this is what I was trying to get to let everyone that name it the name of Jesus Christ depart from iniquity this is why I've treated certain people the way I've treated them with coming to our church or not and this is just not recently but in years past if people are not repent of iniquity and keep doing evil then we have a right to avoid them because this is the foundation of God in other words our church will have no foundation unless we all depart from the iniquity that we started with just because you started Nick when he doesn't give you an excuse to continuing it you've got to be sanctified you and I gotta live clean lives Amen that's right see a foolish Forge it refuses to die or depart from iniquity and this is why she sealed out from the rapture because the seal is you've left inequity amen the boxes of the Holy Ghost is in your heart and then it guides you into all truth and truth is the opposite of iniquity and so the seal the Holy Ghost leads you into a sinless life ain't ya you might fall short in minor sins but not major sins like the ones we read earlier in 2nd Timothy you say oh there's minor major sins yes there is Jesus said he that's unworthy of then he's rightfully beaten with many stripes he has to Sun a few things will be beat with fewer stripes and the church said there are major sins and there are minor sins the Bible cause the major sins abominations praise God which are detestable disgusting things the God like we all preach about all the time right trying to get people out of their abominations what are you trying to do rid of Jesse you're trying to run people on the church no I'm trying to establish the foundation of the church amen because the foundation is if you name the name of Jesus Christ depart from iniquity and the people go what can I do they got to go but all's I know is I don't want to crack foundation I want a foundation that's solid that everybody in the church has departed from iniquity amen so let them go if they if they don't want to live the Word of God they can do whatever they want but as for me and my house we will live a life free from iniquity never under said hallelujah because a foolish virgin still hangs on the things they love can't really die out don't really get born again can't get the victory can't live with a stable faithful continual on fire Christian life I don't want to be one of those I don't want to be a spew out of the mouth of Jesus because I'm lukewarm I want to be hot on fire for Christ amen that's right church I got some brother Aaron on the cult brother Madison Satan comes to pervert the church and he's all about Prevention's well you can still come to church and still sin and still love the things of the world and still commit these evil thing and you're still part of our church but innocence God doesn't build his church upon perversions he said God business church upon conversions the Lord's God doesn't make perverts God makes converts amen hallelujah this is why the reverse version is sealed out of the rapture because she's not standing on the foundational seal that all Christians got leave all their sins praise God has that been made clear now let let me get this here this is the Scriptures reference and let's read it Romans 16:17 yeah yeah that's what I was mentioned earlier here church Paul hands this letter there's beautiful letter Romans maybe one day we'll preach him series on that I still gotta finish Ephesians though mercy and I got a finished numerology I got a few more to finish up here revelation gotta finish up that ones you've got a few to finish he said now I beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them for they do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ but their own belly so what God are you serving are you serving the God of belly or you serving the God of heaven the Lord Jesus Christ when people continue to sin and do things contrary and offend God's people and God's Word when they continue to offend the Word of God it shows who their God is it's not Jesus Christ because if Jesus Christ was your God you do the righteous thing and by good words and fair speeches they deceive the hearts of the simple they still talk of real nice a talk and they still can say such sweet things but if their life is not free from iniquity they're not a part of the kingdom of God at that time can they be a part of it yes jesus said the violent take it by force so they got to get all violent in the spirit and whether they God do they got to kill their own well praise God they had to die to their own will that they might be born and it comes at the right season hallelujah what kind of people miss the season four for that the people that are lazy right lazy people sit when the season comes for them to work lazy people sit on the side they don't do nothing that's how it is spiritually some people are just so spiritually lazy they won't kill their own desires they won't just lay here at the altar they just won't lay at the back of the chair and just God just take it all out of me just rip it out of my heart Lord I'll never go back to it God give me strength and never cuss again or never go back to those dirty things again then take it all out I want to die they never do that and because they never do that they miss the time and sees it but you should be so happy if you caught God's leading to die and be born at the right season amen Laurie can you imagine people's God is their own belly you can see it especially a buffet lines when there's a big long line you can see whose God is the real God I'm so hungry get out of my way you cut in front of me what you see who their God is because they're fighting for their God it's right here their belly right churchy that's just the natural example right you see how they were they were there there I don't they to make themselves the idol that's what Satan told Eve oh you'll be a God see how the same thing that's what he saw did Oh give me pylons for my belly okay right there he was his own God right he exalted his will so prideful so selfish he invited himself above the will of God can everybody see that see we have a choice we have an opportunity to it we're the command to avoid people that won't live right when they've been taught the doctrine and they don't live right we have an opportunity or we have the command to avoid them rather all right let me see thanks for closing there just I can kind of have a good idea okay yeah I can know a few more here yeah now remember but the Bible said love not the world neither the things there in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him if we love the things of the world and love engaging in things that are sinful then God's love is not in us even a cuss word church even if there's one cuss word on a video or a video game or amongst your friends if there's even just one class word that grieves the Holy Spirit go to James chapter one it's in the Bible that's how you know if any man this verse 26 if any man among you seem to be religious and Ralph's not his tongue but to see with his own heart this man's religion is in vain if someone can't tame their tongue they their religion the power of Christianity has not taken effect on them and so if you love those things if you love the things of the world more do you love God than the love of God is not in you then you haven't died out all the ways everybody would ever say what I'm saying all the love must be for God's Word and then say God died help me to die out to not love the things of the world that you might live in me Lord I'm making my first love oh yes and pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world that's pure Christianity right there in a nutshell what serve others and serve God help others and be pure before God I mean right that's pretty self-explanatory all right now let's finish with a second one here give me I'll set my timer here for 50 more minutes and pluck up so in the in the in the natural this is what's happening right now we're planting some of you were planting in Springs anybody plant any seeds yet I know my wife's get ready has you have your planet oh yeah she's playing something already okay so that these are opposite seasons will plant in March or she'll plant I'm not saying me I'm not gonna play nothing but in what does it may be October you pluck everything up maybe September October and somewhere around there I'm not sure I'm not getting yes or no so anyway sometime after harvest that's natural but spiritual planting and plucking up is seen a few different ways it's seen how God planted Israel in the promised land but for us God's not interested so much in us finding like a country of our own in other words God's not trying to get us to a physical promised land God is trying to get us to a spiritual promised land the baptism Holy Ghost to possess this body to bring this wild body under subjection to the Holy Spirit amen this is the mountain God once Caleb in this hour to overcome is this mountain right here this mountain of flesh and sin and lustful desires this is the mountain that God wants pain in this hour and so ministers preaching will plant God's Word in your heart and will also pluck up if you let it now if you let the preacher do it it'll pluck up sins out of our lives and let me close with this it's a good way to end a sermon I think don't you so in the natural the Lord spoke of the Moses and the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho saying speak of the children of Israel and say them when you have passed for Jordan in the land of Canaan then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures all their pictures on your phone and destroy all their molten images and quite pluck down all their high places and ye shall dispossessed in happening to the land and rather and for I've given you the land to possess it and at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to bear out and to plant it so this is speaking of course Nehemiah's time jeremiah was speaking the future Nehemiah's time when god was going to plant them back in the promised land if it knew evil my sight that it obey not my voice then i will repent of the good where and i said i would benefit them again jeremiah says for i will set my eyes upon them for good and I'll bring them again to this land and I'll build them and not pull them down and I will plant them and not pluck them up so even when Joshua church remember I preached others last year or two years ago when Joshua drove out the inhabitants the Bible said he was plucking them up so when the when the walls of Jericho fell down in the spiritual the angels were plucking up Jericho and throwing it down throwing it out of the promised land so I'm gonna plant a holy seed here amen these groups have had plenty of time four hundred forty years to repent and they repented not and God said fire the season has passed a buck in Europe you haven't brought forth any fruit and I'm gonna plant the righteous seed in this land okay when they weren't obeying God and God had to plug that love to and God said okay this was a schoolmaster this was just a lesson to teach you what I want to do in the spiritual I'm not concerned about a natural land I'm concerned about a spiritual land amen people that will live God not just for a few years but live God for all eternity praise God I can plant my word in their hearts and not just plant them as a nation into a land but actually plant my word and write my word on the fleshy tables of their hearts don't you love God's teaching now let's go to the spiritual now this is what you and I can do today he said see I've now God's telling Jeremiah this is what I built you for I built you as a preacher to do this I ordained before you were born in your mother's womb I ordained you to root out sin and to pull down and destroy and to throw down and build and to plant can you imagine that this call in life he was supposed to walk in the pizza people's spiritual lives and pull out the weeds of their lives and you know how we'd like to hang on don't you church about poor my back every year and I put on a pot one of these oh just a small tree I'll try to pull this out my goodness I'm strong enough to bar this little tree and I go about pull out my back but the shovel I'm getting kind of old I guess but see old habits like to hang on but we need something strong to dig him out hallelujah and Jeremiah said that's why God tell them that's why you're born you're born to go in there with the sword of God's Word and go right to the root of it and dig it out and dig it all their lives if you got to preach it fifteen minutes free fifteen minutes if it takes 15 minutes and they got that root bridge 50 minutes if it takes half an hour preach half an hour if it takes an hour preach it over if it takes an hour and a half preaching out at half but I'll try not to do that here although I'm getting close but see however long you are called your ordained anointed of God to root it out and then plant the Word of God in their lives that's why you were born glory see there's a time and this happens at the same time right it's a season to root out the old ones and then plant good seed in there by the preaching of God's Word who then is Paul who's Apollo's but ministers by whom he believed even as the Lord gave to every man see God God gave everyone up to you a preacher I know I'm a very small one but God did gave you a preacher thank God God gave him a preacher in the point brother cam God gave a preacher to every man those people in Napoleon need to hear God's Word through brother cam I believe that don't you I believe that he said I have planted apollos have watered but God gave the increase so then neither is he that planteth anything see the preachers don't really nothing they're just planting God's seed God's seed is what has the power amen there's not power in a preacher there's power and God's word amen but preacher still gotta do their job that God that gives the increase now he that planteth and he that watereth or one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor for we are laborers together with God you are God's husbandry ye are God's building sea but what's his foundation that we depart from iniquity that's the foundation of God's building start by hating sin dying out to sin praise God and building your life upon righteousness and holiness in the fear of God that's right I love this then came his disciples and said to him notice the other though the Pharisees were offended after they heard you're saying but yes he don't you know that you heard them denominations feeling by preaching on them but he answered and said every plant with my father have not planted shall be rooted up let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind and if the blind fall the ditch both shall fall into the ditch see when we offend people church it depends did we do it with the Spirit of God or did we do it with a fleshly prideful spirit if I offend somebody in Pride I'm wrong I've got to repent but if I preach God's Word out of love to try to save people to get them to repent then they need to repent not me because I already repented praise God but ya can a preacher have a bad attitude yeah and preacher can say it the wrong way but hear Jesus saying when he preaches the word and it offends people that's not his fault and if they don't obey it we got to just let them go let the blind lead the blind Hebrews says follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man should see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled so some people will let roots of bitterness in the let sin take anchor and grow its roots in their heart and when the preacher comes they won't let that word root out that root of bitterness they'll remain bitter they'll remain angry and they'll let that go and with they let that go it defiles the ground of their heart is that right church that's why every church service is so important because in between church services who likes to throw evil seeds upon your heart Satan oh you know you and I know Oh Sunday's such a glorious day it is no I don't have many battles on Sunday thank God for the victory brother Haman gets that song playing we get to shout and praise You God clever not many battles on Sunday oh but bring Monday around on Tuesday or Thursday morning or Friday of a haunting or Saturday and that's the time Satan will trying to plant that root of bitterness in there and that's why we got to come to church and let it get wheat and while it's a real small problem that doesn't become this life defiling life altering life defining problem in our lives let's stand to our feet here this is I think the last one yep last one well praise the Lord and brothers have a music musicians if you want to come you can start playing something here so I'm ending this with repentance because that's what this is let me go back there one time before Reedus plant and pluck up planting and King up and Church this planning and plucking up this applies to everyone right you can't say well I've been in the message ten years I've almost been in the message almost twenty years almost I think I'm at eighteen no I can't say well I've been to the message eighteen years I'll never have a root of bitterness because I'm saved no we've all seen people have been the message a long time and they get roots of bitterness so see that's why this seasonal teaching by Solomon is so inspired for today there's a time for you to die to sin be born of God and there's a time to let the word of God be planted and a time to pluck up many roots of bitterness or sin how many can see that today you see how this is so inspired in it can anybody else see the inspiration behind in Solomon's writing by this is beautiful this is like a whole new world it's like a whole understanding mind I'm following in one of these fourteen seasons at this right now right now Church this may be a season of your life where you let things grow up roots of little bitterness or roots of disagreements have grown up but thankfully glory at the same time it was time to pluck up was also a time to plant God's Word there that grounds not going to remain just barren glory there's a seed hallelujah to planted in that old weeds place thank God for that amen but first the root of bitterness the root of any sin needs to be plucked up and then God's Word needs to be planted there and then it needs to be watered with praise during the worship circuit is a yeah thank the Lord amen it's so true look what the word says you said bringing forth therefore fruits meet for repentance and think not to say within yourselves we have brother Branham to be our father can I just put that in there he is a father of our message Paul said I was a father to you Jesus said call no man father but that meant like a worship but Paul said I have become a father to you because I appreciated the Word of God brother random is the father for this church age so don't say well I believe brother Adam was a prophet a lot of people are saying that God is able to raise up these Thrones children under brother Rams message right and now also the axe is laid to the root of the tree therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast in the fire what is repentance it's the stopping the sin repentance is uprooting the sin I am done with this I'm I'm
