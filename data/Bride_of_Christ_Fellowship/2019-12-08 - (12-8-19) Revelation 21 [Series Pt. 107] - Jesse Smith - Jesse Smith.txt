continue on the revelation series more willing I can finish it in the next week or so by God's grace relation chapter 21 verse 1 let's read verse one together and then I read verse two first one revelation 21 verse 1 let's begin on three one two three and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea I read verse two and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband amen let's have a word of Prayer here if everything on your heart just make a known answer to the Lord here how many father we love you Lord our hearts are up our hands are up Lord and we're thankful Lord but for your amazing grace lord grace grace god's grace lauren and we're thankful grace is greater than all of our sin you proved it Lord when the woman was caught in the very act of adultery and your grace told her to go and sin no more the stones were ready to be thrown dear God but Lord you the Bible said you were full of grace and truth Lord God thank you Lord for your amazing grace Lord each one of us no doubt we fall short of your glory but lord we thank you for amazing grace today Lord and as we look to your word Lord we'll give you praise and honor for grace as we look to these future things the scripture commands us to set our affections on things above the holy city above Lord you know we're often tempted to look too much at the city we live in or the Washington DC City or cities around the world but Lord we look now Lord to that great heavenly City father and we pray your Holy Spirit minister to us Lord I'm nothing I have no ability of my own use me for your glory anoint your people use them for your glory may we be in the atmosphere of faith and believing Lord that you might be honored and glorified for apart from you we can do nothing Lord so help us to be inline with your Holy Spirit to be obedient Lord that your works can be done this morning in Jesus Christ's name the church says Amen god bless yous being seated praise God so we'll look to the scripture I'm going to be using some of the notes I used a few years ago of course not all of them but a couple years ago Lord willing I think in 2015 I preached on the future home so this is where we are in the series Lord bless you sister Wendy good to see you by God's grace this is where we are in our series you know we got known on Wednesday night with Revelation chapter 20 about the Millennium and what a great thought that is my the enemies of I'm sorry not the enemies with the the nations of the world will beat their swords and make them into hoes and and rakes and after Jesus rebukes them right there in the Millennium what a powerful what a powerful thing and how many believe that if God rebukes you he loves you praise God that proves it he rebukes the nations and they immediately no more have any concern about anyone else fighting anyone else they immediately go to being fruitful and that's what we should do we should receive a rebuke from Christ and then go back to being more fruitful praise God turn our efforts off of fighting with others and just laboring and God's vineyard and working and becoming fruitful for the kingdom of God amen what a beautiful thought that was praise God what a wonderful time in the Lord and now we're happy for another time in the lower today praise God so let's a look to the scripture I like to just read this whole chapter here it's a it's not exactly that long it's only 27 verses long and you've already read two of them to get a little background here so we read verses 1 & 2 and we see the holy city coming down praise God verse 3 and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he shall dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes now this is in the New Jerusalem there must still be some remembrance right now no doubt what this is referring to I believe is the previous end the end of the previous chapter where we'll have to stand there sitting on Thrones right the Bible said our testimony judges the lives of not only humans but even angels such a godly testimony of Christians and then seeing and if we just capture that for a moment the Bible said in verse chapter 20 verse 11 that the Bible says earth and heaven will flee away at the face of Jesus Christ right the holiness and the brightness of the Lord they are at the white throne judgement causes earth and heaven just to flee from him by the beauty of it in the power of it and then the dead and gray all comes standing before God and books are open and they're judged the Bible said by their works and of course there's the book of life so they take the books here of their individual lives and that they're presented and then they're there that's they look to the other book of life to see if their name is in the book of life and the Bible said the sea gives up the dead and death and he'll delivered up the Dead which were in them and they're judged every man according to his works and God Jesus has called it simply good those that have done good praise God God keeps it very simple either your testimony is you do good or you do evil it's a very simple God he brings it down to just one of those two factors right one of those two descriptions you either do good with your life or you do evil with your life and good is living and helping others living for others that's good Jesus proved it in Matthew 25 so those that did good that stand before Christ I stand before his bride those that do good go forth into eternal life and those had done evil to the lake of fire what a thought mine and death and he'll were casting like a fire this is the second death and who suffers not power in the book of life was cast in the lake of fire imagine that's an interesting thought the Bible said the first shall be last and the last shall be first I imagine that Jesus Christ will call up first the layer see in church age those that died in the tribulation I imagine they'll be pulled up first to be judged and they'll stand there and not to stand before a holy God and understand and they're there live the book of their lives will tell all of them that they wanted the the cares of the world or that a one of the riches of the world they wanted their church buildings they wanted their money their bank accounts more than they wanted the glory and the holiness of Christ because the great temptation at the end the very last temptation was the mark of the beast that was the last temptation and thank God Jesus said he'll keep us from that our temptation amen where we got to choose the word or are the very just physical blessings of our life and they'll to stand there and then the the the the Laodicean saints will be sitting there maybe he'll just rotate us up you know for each age I imagine it'll just be a rotation or maybe it's just if it's like a oval shape of a throne who knows but the last will be first and they'll be judged and we'll have to sit there and be a witness against them Emmer but remember God can bring up somebody from a thousand years before to be a witness against it because the Queen of Sheba was from a thousand BC and Jesus said I'll use her to judge the Pharisees so he can poll anybody imagine he might even pull up lot because lot was the days of lot was like our day praise God and lot will be an overcomer he was able to overcome the temptations of sodom and gomorrah and he the bible said is for so is righteous man and so we'll stand there and maybe God will call it a lot and lot was able to call it wickedness some will say I wasn't able to call it wickedness because of the pressure here the pressure there and God will call Pilate and they'll say well I was able to call it wickedness even amidst an angry mob can you imagine that and this person will say I just had the pressure of my wife or or my uncle trying to pressure me to accept homosexuality but lot will say well I'd overcome an angry mob a man that will be used against them on that day Church let's stand on holiness praise God let's stay with the word Amen let's not be afraid if we hurt people's feelings because what do feelings matter it's God's feelings that matter praise God it's not human feelings that matter it's God's feelings that matter and want to stand there and those that are disobedient we'll watch some church I imagine I wonderful to be crying on the Thrones or not but the Bible said we'll be crying tears there and Jesus will have to come by and wipe away those tears people that we loved people that we knew one after another and jesus said few there be that find it few will find the road so church the majority of the people from our day coming up with a majority will be taken and thrown in that lake of fire I would be about crying now my thinking of that people that we loved people that we prayed for and tried to witness to it people that maybe gave us hard times or rejecting us and and mocked us and make fun of us and they want to stand there as a witness as an overcomer want to stand there as a judge and no doubt Church I imagine that will start crying a little bit see one after another but I imagine the glory of the Angels the angels cheering when a couple of those find their names on the book praise God that the Angels because they didn't have eternal life while on the earth but they'll get eternal life when their names found on the book of life amen imagine the innumerable number of angels worshipping and praising God saying glory to God he meant that a soul was able to be saved on Laodicea you know I'm back and forth you know sometimes I think a lot of people are gonna be saved sometimes a lot I think hardly anybody's gonna be saved because you see the wickedness sometimes you see people do good things but then they'll turn around and do wicked things they'll say nice things about God and they'll turn around and do evil things that we know is abominable in the sight of God but we ought to be trusting in we're trusting an amazing grace but my dad said at that throat there won't be grace it'll be works right and those are the works the testimony it had to be a work that was good that did good to God and Christ pride in Christ family Christ's body praise God mine now I'll say like this I kind of said it I want to add to that I do think it'll be grace there because it'll just be grace to be given eternal life but the fact of there won't be another one that I mean by there won't be grace you won't be able to repent there you already had to repent earlier praise God that's what it means because the Bible says you live once and then the judgment right so your decision you make before death is the decision that will stand that's right imagine each age and then we go back to the Philadelphia and then Sardis and Thyatira and Samara and Pergamos all the way back to Ephesus and then I wonder after that if they'll do the Old Testament Saints because the last will be first and the first will be last imagine those souls from the days of Noah Jesus already preached to them not but they got to come back up one more time and here I'm Stan see him standing there as judge and weigh their case it's got to be fair did you hear the message or not did you follow the prophet of God or not did you follow the vindicated preacher of righteousness or not amen and the very word they preach to them no will stand there he'll be raised up Enoch will be stood up he'd prophesied that the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his Saints amen after the last one let's say the last one is you know pain or something like that throw it in there I imagine we'll all be crying by then and the Bible says as we're weeping the Bible said a holy city starts coming down and I imagined before that city comes down by the hose a Jesus is gonna look over behind and say he's gonna say my children it is finished praise God amen praise God at the end of the first covenant he uttered out those words with his last breath it is finished the first covenant is finished amen and here I believe they'll turn around or something or a ruby there and I hope he repeats it again because they'll say the second covenant is now finished amen it is finished and now you can say like this now the Covenant is finished praise God he said time is finished death is finished amen it's all finished amen no more time it is all and now it's just the same conditions now we're back to the Garden of Eden amen oh praise God amen glory and we'll all be crying and then the city this holy city will come down like a bride adorned for a husband it'll be the last wedding ceremony brother Jose the last wedding ceremony whatever save raise God amen his heaven coming down to marry the earth amen hallelujah here comes the bride amen glory she'll descend down and offer transparent gold and glory it'll come down the earth we'll have all those say like this like a I don't even know the word just a shaking syndrome or something like that i shaking spell and then the Bible said the earth will raise up right the earth will raise up to make a mountain that this pyramid can sit on top of and brother branham compares this to Jesus's baptism and I just caught that this morning when I was praying just as the earth had to rise up to meet the heavenly City so did Jesus's body the earth had to rise up out of the water to meet the heavenly dove amen I don't have rays God so it fits perfectly praise God heaven and earth marring uniting one rising up to meet the other hallelujah praise God amen and that will be the finished work now the earth can say I'm purified Amen hallelujah because the earth had to be justified the days of Noah sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ pouring out all over the earth and now the earth is fired baptized and it's got in this back to its rightful condition it's back to a pure condition praise God amen I didn't expect to preach that right there but Jesus left verse 4 had to wipe away all the tears from their eyes we'll still have human emotion we'll still have emotion and and and be distraught see the church that's not someone who's really got the Holy Ghost they will sign cry for the abominations of sinners this proves our right they're the true bride of Christ we'll always can always burden them they'll cry though because their heart is so in love with God and their heart hates sin and it breaks their emotional state they can't they they just can't handle thinking the thought about loved ones being lost and and people that claim to be religious doing abomination than living in sin and that breaks their emotional state even to this point praise God now if it's right you can have a glorified body in Christ this is right I didn't think about that till now all tears so thinking about the multitude in Jesus somehow is going to wipe away all the tears from our eyes we don't have to worry there's no time there nobody's going to get tired oh how dare you praise God amen and there should be no more death see that remember remember brother have said there could be death in the Millennium it looks like there could be the Bible said a child will die a hundred years old there could be of course we know death also means a second death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away oh my praise the Lord and now verse five so now you must go back up to his seat because before he was wiping the tears away and now the Bible said that he that sat on the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful this is not a fairytale Church it's not something that I'm just trying to get you happy about this is something God's trying to get you to be prepared for amen he's trying to get you prepared for that wedding day of the heaven and earth praise God amen no no wonder a weddings are some of the happiest days on earth no wonder because they all prefigure your baptism of the Holy Ghost and this earth baptism and the Holy Ghost amen praise God no wonder because it represents all the past pains are going to be healed praise God it means the past life is over and just be encouraged our program say that if you got the wrong mate on this side you'll get the right one over there in the mundum it all gets fixed over there if you got the wrong one here everything wrong is going to be made right praise God hallelujah so we know this all things will be done away with anything with pain anything associated with sorrow will be put away these are true and faithful he said unto me it is done so see at some point there's gonna be that time where he turns around said it's finished it is dad praise God San and death has been put away with it's a thing of the past oh how we longed for that moment praise God it is done I'm alpha I don't know why I don't know why these aren't red letter words I am Alpha and Omega the beginning in the end I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of water of life freely praise God now look at that church even though we're in glorified bodies we can still cry up to that point at least and then we'll be thirsty for more of God oh I'm glad my thirst for Christ will never be quenched hey man I'm gonna need an eternity to spend with him because I'll still be thirsting for the waters of his life amen praise God see my boys have a thirst for more of God love church boy worship more of the truth we'll always have a thirst for that praise God people tell me they love God and got the Holy Ghost and no are thirsty for Church something's wrong with them brother over there something's wrong with them there they don't want to sing anymore they don't want to love the Lord or study their Bibles anymore something's wrong with you because the soul of a believer is constantly thirsting for more of God and it will for eternity oh you think are gonna get bored with Jesus some day nonsense nope he said he that the thirst come it's freely given he the overcometh shall inherit all things there's our promise and I'll be his God and he shall be my son so we deal we're dealing with family they're by God's grace all the family of God Oh toe to be a son and daughter praise God I like that song Val my true father and I a true son praise be thou my vision praise is that your vision church that you'll be a faithful son you'll be a faithful daughter and there you'll know him as father and you'll be like a child verse 8 but the fearful and the unbelieving and the abominable and the murderers and the whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all Liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death now see Church this I've just read on this this morning this has to be those who like Judas failed to repent because Abraham lied twice he lied to the king of Egypt and he lied Abimelech the Philistine King right Isaac lied to that one I think was the Egyptian king again the Bible said all Liars were burned so it doesn't mean Abraham and Isaac ax didn't I they did lie it doesn't mean by Ram didn't lie but they were trusting in the Lamb of God they were trusting in the Lamb of God just like the wipe away all their tears he wipe away all their sins to praise God he's able to wipe away all of our troubles that are our sins in our knit booties what about that whoremonger of the the woman at the well six men she went from one house to the second to the third to the fourth to the fifth and then the sixth one she's in that one and Jesus says none of those are your husband you've already had six alright she was a whoremonger but not once the blood of Jesus Christ when she received Christ as a messiah now when that happened she because God's grace was able to wash it all away praise God amen but these are those who don't repent of fear I'm scared to preach I'm scared to have a ministry the fearful I'm scared to stay in the message I'm scared to go to church I'm scared to witness the people you know I'm just giving examples the fearful those who won't repent of fear unbeliev they just don't believe I don't believe he was a prophet I don't believe I don't believe Jesus is the Son of God the environment of all homosexuality bestiality cross-dressing those that won't repent and the murderers right like Cain like Adolf Hitler sorcerers witchcraft and these are drug people because sorcery is always linked to drug so those people that that die of these overdoses and fail to repent and never admit they're wrong and they love the witchcraft more than they love the things of God idolaters now I believe in there will be people that worship brother random just like they worship all idolaters and they don't say they're sorry they don't repent they have their part in the lake of fire which burns with fire and brimstone this is the second death I hope you feel like God is helping you to be ready to go to that city praise God your prayer ought to be Lord take all the fear out of my life take all my unbelief out that's why I like that Jairus is prayer lord I believe help my unbelief I believe I got a little bit of unbelief fear hanging around help my unbelief help me to cast it down murdering whoremongers sorcerers are doubters Liars Lord forgive me for lying forgive me for my lustful thoughts because spiritual whoremonger you same as physical murdering us speaking evil about people God take my tongue forgive me for what I say I really want to try to be different I don't want to say anything evil about anybody I don't want to be separated from you I want to be with you but those that won't say they're sorry those that won't admit their sins he has to separate them and listen church he's not doing anything that they didn't want they didn't want to be with him and they proved it because they they rejected the holy spirit that would come to them service after service right I mean the Holy Spirit was so kind and gentle he was like it's like he was sending them flowers every week right when your love you send people gifts and you know show them your love well that's what God was God was trying to send his love one love letter after another He healed them he gave them life he gave them a health and strength and good money and jobs oh but they turned it down and they didn't want his presence there in their life snow so Jesus will say I'll give you what you want you don't want to be in my presence that's mercy that's love and it won't be for your eternity it'll be a just punishment right but he said love letter after love letter mercy after mercy and they turn it down and still in a repent of their evil deeds so Jesus says fine you can have what you want you didn't want my Holy Spirit to correct your fear or unbelief or abominations or murders or whoremongers or idolatry or lying then you can have that separation from my Holy Spirit verse nut and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and I'm in the rope no that's right yeah and talked with me saying come either I will show the the bride the Lambs wife no the one who had the seven vials is now introducing them to the bride so he went from judgment he's introducing judgment pouring out judgment now to introducing the bride what a job what a job he goes from judgment to to holiness praise God to beauty verse 10 and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great city the holy Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God having the glory of God and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a Jasper stone clear as crystal it had a wall great and high and had twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names written thereon which are the names of the 12 tribes of the turret of Israel on the east three gates on North three gates on the South three gates and on the west three gates and all and the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them names of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb and either talk with me had a golden Reed to measure the city and the gates thereof in the wall of their own and the city lieth Foursquare and the length is as large as a breath and he measured the City of the reed twelve thousand furlongs and the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal case you just switch over here I just want to show that picture again I of a couple years ago when I preached this here just such a beautiful picture so the the measurement of the city the twelve thousand cubits here is one thousand five hundred ninety seven miles from the capital to capital from Maine to Florida this is just the city itself remember the earth has to rise up to meet it where is he going to get all that earth he'll do it he'll do it I don't know how he's gonna do it but he'll do it maybe would be that volcanic that'll raise up and gush out and just raise up such a platform for this city to sit on it's a call to high mountain and he did talk with me yes okay now Foursquare verse seventeen and he measured the wall there have a hundred and forty and four cubits according to the measurements of a man that is of the angel in the city and the building of the wall that was Jasper and the city was pure gold like unto clear glass see all these companies that you know like Apple I was watching Apple they built a new building in New York and that they're not like the other companies where they just do concrete and drywall they make there's of all glass and aa at the perversion that's a cut that's an imitation because God city is just like that it's transparent glass see because a Christian is always transparent praise God right now there are some mistakes will hide which are hide things but really when you're annoyed for the Holy Spirit you've got nothing to hide raise god your life is open birth praise the Lord like I told that Willard guy on from New York he's liking about this brother that left the message he put this video I said I'll take any question you got about the message I said I'm totally transparent my life's an open book if I don't have the answer I'm gonna wait til I get it and I'll put it on the Shelf I won't put up there too long right I don't we put up there too long but I'll wait for God's time to take it off the shelf and bring it down and understand it by God's grace there's a lot of evil out there man there's a lot of mocking and making fun of God's profit from people that have left but you but I'll show my wife some of the pictures this week some of the people on Facebook that used to preach it now they marry people and the women is just showing her whole entire chest and one of them married a family member and they're exposing their midriff tanned in short shorts that's their wedding outfit short shorts and showing all kinds of cleavage that used to preach this message but see member in that city there'll be no nothing that works abomination praise God how did I hear ya so this is what this is what the fruits of leaving the Word of God because but it's not leaving brother Branham necessarily it's leaving the word that he preached because Motorama is not the message he preached the message which is God's Word so there always has to be fruits of leaving but church our lives are open book we're not scared of any question we might not be able to understand it but we've got to look at all the proof and we got to look at all the evidence that he was a prophet and Lord willing I'll be doing that in the next few weeks Lord winning once I get done with the revelation series I got a lot of thoughts about I want to go through I like I said I'm last Sunday although 17 right now Jose and I were working a little bit we've got 17 things rogram said that clearly weren't thus saith the Lord and even 1977 program says that completely says this is not the Lord this is me that's an exact quote now how people can stay in there and say everywhere it was us that the Lord when he says is not the Lord those people are delusional they've taken on the spirit of a lie because they won't accept the truth so because they won't accept the truth God's given them over to a lie and they've held it for decades the only hope is God's mercy that they'll open up their hearts and repent and say they're sorry for the sins of idolatry that's right and you know it's tied to money if you can't see any outward sins like sexual sins then you know money's behind it somewhere because the love of money is the root of worshiping brother Branham hello the love of money is behind all of it I got seventeen so if you know other times he said something let me know but RAM said you're 80% water and petroleum petroleum is crude oil that they it's a harvest and then they have to refine that to get gasoline are you eighty percent gasoline no but in my soul I've got gasoline I got fire you see so I want to go through those own show all right I'm gonna show you all the quotes under this banner of God's Spirit rightly divides the word of truth and we are a transparent people praise God and the bye wouldn't say prove some of the issues and some of the things you like to talk about but not the others the bargains they prove some things the Bible said prove all things some people like to stay away from their they don't want to touch it well most of us don't want to touch it but we know if the Bible says prove all things and we've got the Spirit of Truth the Spirit will direct us into the proof of all true things amen right now I brought down to brother Branham either me to either sin like when he lied to the IRS which we all do or he made an honest mistake with like 1977 that's just the honest mistake he just made a prediction it wasn't right or like a slip of the tongue Oh that'd be an honest mistake too I've got a few other ones but see this city is transparent see how I get off on that God loves transparency praise God amen and I don't own human ability we're trying to be more transparent Church I'm not saying we're perfect I'm not saying that we don't hide things like you know we don't want to go around telling people all of our sins all the time so we don't do that but once we know they're on that once we've set totem to Jesus once we've confessed them to Jesus then they are into the blood praise God they are forgiven and we all live in a transparent life praise God hey man that wasn't planning on appreciate that either verse 19 and the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones the first foundation was jasper the second sapphire the third chalcedony the fourth an emerald the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh christ so light the eighth beryl the ninth topaz the tenth a Christ so pricess and the eleventh a giant and twelfth an amethyst and the twelve gates were twelve pearls every several gate was of the one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass now remember we read it on his Wednesday night the Bible said the nations of the world will flow into this it's so high up there but yet they'll flow like water and so God will give them such strength our bodies will be so pure so the holy it's like when we will be going uphill but it's like we're running downhill praise God because it'll just be flipped if it's a different civilization praise God so it's going to have different laws amen you won't need to see any more praise God you'll flow upward praise the Lord amen see the laws of nature are now subject to the God in you amen right now we're subject to these laws unless God does America right speak to the storm or something like that speak to squirrels or speak something like that but then the Bible said the I've said before we'll call he'll already answer beautiful hmm where's 21 and the 12 gates were twelve pearls every several gate was of one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass and I saw no temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the temple of it and the city had no need of the Sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof oh my now I didn't have need of it it looks like it's still there the Sun may still be there no doubt the moon no doubt but the glory of God will be the light thereof I believe got to let that moon stay there forever as a reminder praise the Lord that that's what we are ready men we have no goodness of our own it is only when Christ is reflecting off us that we have any benefit at all praise God verse 24 and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into programs that's tithes and offerings and he said your tithes and offerings are eternal because for all eternity the nations are gonna be paying their tithes and offerings probably cuz they didn't pay him right the first time Amen Church maybe they said them to some headquarters instead of saying to their local ministry oh you don't think God cares about that God watches every single penny doesn't he if God watches every word you say and every idle word will be a count enough thank God for the blood for that one amen if God watches every hair of your head and knows that we have your head that God is watching over all your tithes and offerings go to so you can have nations for all eternity that he allows to be saved bring their tithes and offerings right here this right here bring their tithes and offerings in the house of the Lord they're gonna glorify God they're gonna give back to God what He has given graciously to them for all eternity what is your glory and honor well your praises your worship we know that but tithes and offerings of the representation of your honor unto the Lord Lord you've given me this paycheck you give me this job it is my honor to give you back just a tenth of this and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for there shall be no night there amen there's no there's gonna be no devil slip in their face amen no y'all worry about closing it for enemies cuz all the enemies are done away with Amen thank God and they shall bring the glory to honor the nation's into it and there shall no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither work if abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life oh thank you Lord Jesus now let's hit a few themes that I just want to hit a few highlights here I got about I just maybe go about half an hour more by God's grace yeah amen thank you sir praise God like I said some of this will be review but I feel like I got to I got to finish this this thought here yeah I've gone 107 sermons I gotta finish it up here brother Branham said he took a year and a half to preach the whole book of Revelation so I wanna do the same thing so we're all on the same understanding as close as possible to the revelation here by God's grace now here's how I organize that I went through the timing of this chapter is very chronological the New Jerusalem must first descend from heaven and then the gates will open allowing entrance in the holy city and all the glory and honour from every nation will flow into her with met with through her magnificent gates and her magnificent walls amen so it comes down and then after the the gates swing open and the kings of the earth have had now think about that they've had time to go farming out there they've had time to harvest raise God they that time and then they flow and then they bring in their glory and honor into this holy city so we see the the order of this event here praise God now there's three so there's two themes here there's the new heaven and the new earth and there's the new jerusalem in this chapter as we've seen the new heaven and earth fulfills 2nd Peter 3:7 so let's go there 2nd Peter 3:7 these will be a little bit of review here but I I just can't skip it because I know that I got children here and I got to get this attitude in my heart and mind I wonder just gonna solidify that I want to be happy about more happy about the people that stay than the people that go or the new people that come like Denis McBride told me I love that I want to be more happy that thank God some are still here praising the Lord what can I do to help out the faithful ones who stay with God's Word praise God that's why you see big smile on my face today you know and whatever people leave or whatever I always want to feel sad but I can't be sad I got to be thankful for those who have stayed praise God now I was thinking there's I think there's reasons God has shown me why this church has to be small I was thinking about I'm trying to place all the dots together for God's will for my life trying to play by this man maybe that that just trying to place it together praise God God knows I've tried to do as much as I can to be a blessing to people praise God help them out in times of need or visited them or try to do everything I can do to help people out 2nd Peter 3:7 what the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day remember that was from David David wrote that in Psalms 94 so this is Old Testament so Peters looking back Old Testament and he's bringing to his day and he feels were almost ready for the day of the Lord amen praise God the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance amen jokes let's not be discouraged each year that passes let's not be discouraged all the rapture didn't come let's not be discouraged let's remember it's more time to get our level and saved it's our chance to try to keep some from being rejected from the prints of God and be tossed off in the lake of fire oh my let's remember that this is God's mercy and God's long-suffering praise God because he's not willing that any should come to perish God wants everybody to say I'm sorry forgive me I'm changing my life through your power and he wants everyone to repent me baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ but not all will do it well thankful we can do it praise the Lord amen but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat and the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up now that just struck me I was talking to somebody this week about then how in the world can the rapture be after the tribulation if the tribulation happened first we would all expect the end of the world because we'd see seven plagues we'd see 7 trumpets blow and water turn to blood I mean anybody would know this the end of the world but the day that's not coming like a thief I think doesn't knock and say hey it's 9 o'clock p.m. but I'll be here at midnight get ready for me get your guns loaded so you can blow me away when I try to steal your Nintendo 64 whatever here oh your Apple computer how's that like that for me or your vehicle or your your Honda or your Nissan no it's not a thief of the night a thief he comes and you don't expect him and that's another proof that the rapture has to happen before God has to snatch his bride out of the way so that the judgments come quick and fast and they had a chance to repent but they repented not because the message had been preached to every nation then shall the end come hallelujah every nation gets a chance to hear the message of the hour that's beautiful man I never thought about like that there it is the fee for the night so even that the burning fire right before the Millenium right there where we're at walk upon the ashes of the wicked that is like it comes like a thief in the night the tribulation comes like a thief in the night that's another proof to it I guess that's what I need to use with that brother who mailed me about that seeing then that all these things will be dissolved a church think about that this building is gonna be dissolved some day your car out there which hopefully it's almost paid for thank God for that it's gonna dissolve someday so this gives us the ability to prioritize what is most important in life amen all these things and all these things are gonna beat us on what matter a person aren't you to be in all holy conversation and godliness because it's all going to dissolve except your soul is that right Church it's all going to dissolve except the soul of the believer and of course your body will be swallowed up right your physical body be swallowed up in the glorified body that won't dissolve but everything else will be dissolved by fire right atomic fire or volcanic fire everything else so what persons how should we live if we if we can look at everything and see it's all gonna be dissolved what should we place our attention on our conversation and our godliness we should be careful what we say praise God we should be careful to act just like God looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat there won't just be fire on the earth Church there'll be fire in the heavens we will be open the seventh dimension right before the Millennium but there'll be fire around the earth and they'll be fire some type of spiritual fire there in the heavens because they even heavens will melt the Bible says with fervent heat now look at verse this is my preaching abbien verse 14 wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent there it is there's that word diligence well Jim after I preached that on Sunday morning now he comes up he says look I just preached on diligence twice this month he showed me the copies of his sermon notes and I preached that here about being diligent praise God see being faithful being a dedicated that's a I appreciate brother Williams saying about that me said he said brother Jesse's a faithful man that made me feel good because I want to be faithful I don't want to be unfaithful I want to be diligent so I'm faithful to the things of God that really blessed my heart I appreciate that from that man of God he knew ghin that you may be found in him in peace without spot and blameless amen praise God so preaching on revelation 20:1 should get us thinking about living a holy life and being diligent for for God's kingdom because that kingdom won't dissolve that kingdom is coming this kingdom is dissolving praise God let me say this Wall Street's gonna dissolve praise to God the White House is gonna dissolve all those big oil rigs out there off the Gulf Coast in Mexico they're gonna be dissolved they're making big money now and natural gas tanks and everything like that but it's all going to be dissolved what matters is our conversation and our godliness and our diligence to live a life of peace and blamelessness before the Lord and before his people hallelujah now the Bible said there's a great noise there's gonna be a massive explosion fervent heat the earth and the works are burned up along with the heavens there's no more sea no more physical temple no need for the light of the Sun and no nighttime for all things are new and I thought about that church no see I thought well the first thing came to my mind was to see a forgetfulness so God gonna even undo or do away with the sea of forgetfulness where's your sins in the sea of forgetfulness but then the New Jerusalem there's no more sea praise God there's no more record there there's no way to even think about it it's so deep and far gone and so washed away it's completely cleanse it's all holiness praise God Amen even the sea where my sins were tossed won't be able to find it anymore praise God hallelujah amen just these look at these little symbols that he gives us what a blessing praise God what a privilege to serve Him remember John was previously invited to see the great in 17:1 the filthy woman but now he's invited to see the great holy city the bride the Lambs wife amen praise God what an invitation amen the angel shows him the immoral city the statues and think of all the abortions done and all the the bodies of those immoral men that are buried there under the catacombs right they keep praying over those bones of bones that I think there's power and touching those bones and kissing those bones and God said that sorcery and they're lying to their people by saying there's virtue there there's no virtue in that there's virtue in the Holy Spirit and John sees the evil one first and then God says now I'm going to show you the holy one praise now what a way to end this vision how did they raise God he starts off by seeing Jesus in the white robe he falls down as one that's dead in the middle of it he sees the seals and all these things then he sees the unholy woman but God ends this glorious vision on the Isle Patmos by seeing the Lambs wife the bride amen I don't know you what a way to end it amen honey that's the end of our life - that's the end of our vision is that we're a part of that bride that we live in that city that we have eternal life with Christ that's the end of all my dreams brother Jose praise God that's the end of all my visions I don't have visions but maybe had one maybe that's the end of all of it is to see the real true character I'm Jesus Christ God living in his people praise God that's what the scripture said he said I will be God he said I'll be their God I'll be with them for those say this is what God wanted the whole time that's what I'm writing that next chapter in my next book in the in in Genesis God wanted to walk with Adam and it was glorious their communion and the fullness of the day praise God the coolness of the evening and he come down and say praise the Lord Adam how you doing today Marty you say you praise the Lord they read walk and fellowship and how is he even doing and you know how are you doing today that such fellowship God was walking with them but God wasn't satisfied with that he said this is a pretty good Eden but their swarm is going to be greater I just don't want to walk with them I want to walk in them praise God hey man I want to be their very source of life that's the power of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the Old Testament that anointing would leave come and go come and go come and go David's leaves slays a lion but then he kills Uriah it just comes and go and God wasn't satisfied but it was a teacher to teach them that they needed more of God amen and so when the Holy Ghost fell they got a new birth and they Peter said this is that God is pouring out his spirit on sons and daughters and Paul picks it up and says I will be their God I will speak in them I will look in them and they will be my children they will be my people oh what a blessing today to be God's people praise God that he can live in us and talk through us oh you don't believe that's possible God can talk through you it is possible I showed you that quote that email I got this week where the woman read my book in two days and she said it's like Christ was talking to me hallelujah that's pretty good evidence Lydia that God likes to talk through living and living people praise God I wasn't right in that book it was Christ riding that book I got proof people's lives are changed they're the ones saying it was Christ talking to them amen and that's what God wanted from the beginning not just to be with him but to be in them praise God possessing the very bodies that his spoken word spoke and the dust that he pulled it from the earth and spoke life into it and now he's fully gonna possess them and he's gonna dwell them as long as they'll beat it and they yield to the Holy Spirit ha ha ha thank the Lord amen aren't you happy today Church Sankranthi at 6 I just kind of came to my heart here I've been dealing with this scripture now this is a of course a dating scripture art lessons a dating courtship pardon me a courtship scripture obviously verse 14 sikerly and 6:14 be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness so see Church when you you know if you're on a mission if God wants you to be among sinners he's sending you on a mission but he's never gonna send you amongst unbelievers where you're gonna fall because there's no temptation God will never give you a temptation too hard praise God he's never gonna give you a two-time taste ream hardly hard temptation where I can't overcome that I got a given into sin know there's times you know where we will be amongst unbelievers but if God has called us there he's called us there to shine the light of God's love to them but we are not to unequally yoked ourselves right because we have no fellowship when you realize that you're amongst people and you really have no fellowship it's best that you leave praise God if you finish your mission that God told you to do or God's called you to do it's time to move on because you can have no fellowship with the things of darkness praise God like look at Jonah Jonah is a good example he went in there to preach the word and went sat outside the gate because he didn't know are they gonna stuff that or not of course he didn't want them to accept it but they did accept it he went there he blasted the way at 40 days 40 days 40 days and all the kings and all the animals even fasted bye talk about a revival praise God even the air those aren't allowed to eat no one's allowed to eat because we want to show our sincerity to God is that right so see then he broke and made sure we had no fellowship that's what we see our lives should be to well Concord hath Christ with Belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel see there's not much you can fellowship around right with unbelievers what do you talk about can't talk about the Lord and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols for you're the temple the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people this is what it's all about this is what God didn't have in the first Eton he just walked with Adam but now in this last Eden now he's not walking with us he's walking in us he's giving us a portion of eternal life and it's a permanent deposit in our souls and then our glorified body praise God oh it's always an obedience to that eternal life that's within us praise God wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you so see the way God receives you as first he gives you his word and then you have to prove it you have to prove to God that you've received his word by not associating with sinful things and then God receives you that's kinda like God gives you a little test here's my word are you gonna obey it or not and he steps back he gives you the test am I gonna touch the unclean thing or not and he said I'll receive you if I give you my word and you don't touch it he said then I'll receive you praise God just like the tree of knowledge and good and evil amen hallelujah then I'll receive you and I'll be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty whoa in that beautiful church is that beautiful or what this is what God wanted he wanted to dwell inside them praise God that New Jerusalem the holy great city is described in all of its beauty and splendor it's likened to a bride adorned for her husband it has a glorious light it's clear as crystal a great high wall with 12 foundation in 12 gates showing God's faithful dedication to his covenant promises to the 12 tribes of Israel and the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ the measurements of his Foursquare City prove it must be the shape of a pyramid for a cube-shaped city would not allow for the light of the Lamb to reach every area in the city and the nations that are without the city right if it's a cube if it's a cube and the lights up here if the lights up here is any light gonna get down here right here there like it no no it's just gonna shine out here they'll be no light so it has to be a pyramid it's at the very top that's kind of hard to say huh kinda hard to do that if I don't have a pier in front of me but the pyramid the light goes all directions praise God it's able to go in every direction so Christ can be the light to everybody amen the kingdom Jesus waited for that Satan labor form it's now come how do you praise God amen beautiful Jesus they're gonna stand there and the New Jerusalem and I look around and said this day this scripture is fulfilled praise God Satan said try and take it now before the cross try to take it now and she said no I'm catching a vision then I'll receive it later on in the future home praise God hey man how did it yeah thank you Jesus and Church murmur if you overcome now your rule over cities and nations if you can over now don't take it now take it later praise God rule over your own small ministry your own small gifts rule over that faithfully now you should be so faithful with the gifts God has placed in your life just be faithful with them be dedicated to them and then if we're faithful with the little things the big thing will come later neither very all the things Satan showed him all the kingdoms of the world are all dissolved now the glory of Babylon of the glory of Rome and the glory of New York City it's all burnt down and dissolved the very temptation is gone the only Kingdom is the kingdom of God and Jesus is worthy and he's the proven rightful ruler of this city praise God now the revelations give me a few more minutes here I noticed five important revelations in here now of course there's more but when I wrote this script I think I wrote it two years ago and I'm still on chapter v 14 I think as far as my youtube videos I've done chapters 1 to 14 so I'm left off at 15 there cuz I want to lay in these other teaching videos first but I wrote this a couple years ago the first symbol is that a set of the New Jerusalem I said this earlier is coming down from God out of heaven and this is a beautiful picture of God coming to physically and eternally dwell with his people it was prefigured at Jesus baptism at the River Jordan when God the Father in the form of a dove descended to unite and dwell in the body of Jesus the Son of God uniting heaven and earth and this is the same spirit filling experienced by every born-again child of God today as the baptism of the Holy Ghost unites the Spirit of Christ from heaven into the earthly vessel of the new believer praise God amen if you are born again today Church you've already experienced in a prefigure the future home coming to the earth amen you've already experienced that as a prefigure you know it's like for heaven to touch earth praise God haha hi-yah that's a great symbol there that God gives us so it's like we're all gonna experience being born again again right if you're born again about the only ghost you've already done born again but now you get the experience being born again again praise God amen my the second revelation is over comers inherit all things as true sons of God they receive all the rewards of the previous seven Church ages having overcome all of Satan's temptations and sins which includes unbelief abomination murder sorcery idolatry lying and all those other defilements list in the chapter anyone guilty of not repenting will participate in the second death but see what's different the Bible said the overcomers made their calling and election sure they were so determined to prove to hate fruit prove to God to prove to Christ and the angels and other family members they were so determined to be an overcomer they proved it to everybody praise God that's one thing church and I hope you know what I'm talking about when you're all alone in your private life where you are in your home or your job you should always feel like someone's watching you because God is watching you the angels are watching to you and you should have the feeling I need to prove that I am what I say I am amen you should have like a spiritual desire to prove yourself because this is a tailless praise God whenever you're low whenever your own people it should be an opportunity where you got that's the Holy Spirit telling you that that's not you trying to work to your salvation that's the Holy Spirit telling you prove who you are manifest who you are yield to my spirit and prove that everybody proved in heaven through the earth that your son or daughter of God and you're worthy to not just enter in that city once in a while but to live in that city praise God Hey hmmm make your calling let's ensure God called me will prove it God called me to speak in tongues prove it God called you to preach prove it hello wee-wee that's not really the devil talking if it's God talking cuz God is saying prove it prove you got to get there he'll for the sake prove it believe the word yield to God be a vessel that's available to be a meat for the Masters use dedicated sanctified set aside set yourself aside of the things of God that you can prove to everybody that you're a tool of God is that right prove it that's not the devil say no this ain't saying make yourself a miracle yeah that's that's the devil but the Holy Spirit is telling you set your life aside how many how many can feel I'm saying that this morning I mean you feel anybody feel the Holy Spirit say improve it and he's saying he's telling you to encourage you prove it you to my spirit that it can be proven to everyone what's your gifts and calling in life are prove it Church we don't have to prove how tired we get you have to prove to any of you how tired I get you sometimes you can see it my
