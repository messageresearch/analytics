we know in love maybe Simon's preaching I don't know if he is speak through him and Lord pray you'll meet every need Lord we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen let's take our Bibles here tonight let's go to Acts chapter 2 verse 41 I'd like to uh continue that series on the supernatural book of Acts Church this be just part two real simple thought here I just thought this would be a series kind of like the I will pour out my spirit series just to kind of build our faith going into the special meetings next month we're just a couple weeks away we did get confirmation brother Jim schumake will be preaching Thursday and Friday and uh brother cam then will preach Saturday night and Sunday so we're looking forward to that and then we can talk about times you know I know I said it earlier but to the working moms you know children even working with just work in general we'll talk about what time we can start I was thinking maybe around 6 we have food here you know so if we get here 5:30 everybody can eat you know so we'll just talk about that see how that works out by God's grace forward to those meetings there acts 241 one the supernatural book of Acts Church part two I think as we preach on the book of Acts it just becomes more real to me it becomes more obvious that we are a continuation of the book of Acts just like brother brandom said we're not a different church we are the same church praise God Acts 2 verse 41 remember in the body of Christ there's members in particular every member uh plays a particular part every member might have a different sort of gift a different type of min there like the Bible says there are different kinds of healings there's not just one kind of healing there's numerous kinds of healings well that means there's numerous kinds of each and every gift and so we want to thank God for the gifts Hallelujah we want to be more dedicated for the gifts praise God that's why we're here that's why we come that's why we keep serving God all the time we want to learn to be more dedicated to Jesus Hallelujah acts 241 I just thought I would uh kind of start here and then we'll go into Acts chapter 3 here tonight I just want to hit some highlights here by God's grace acts 241 we'll read just 41 together okay and then I'll read uh 42 and 43 myself so let's read 41 one two three then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 Souls 3,000 baptisms or at least people saved that Day verse 42 I'll this myself and what they do once they got saved did they go crawl back to their uh Pharisee religion or sadducee religion no they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in Breaking of bread and in prayers that's when you know you had a real conversion you know when you leave your old religious system and you join the real group that has life so we see those that may fall away just proves you know either they had something genuine like that Third Kind of ground you know they had something I'm sorry the second kind of ground sprang up quickly but they had no real Roots right they had a what the Bible said a Stony heart they didn't really have it verse 43 and fear Came Upon every soul and Many Wonders and signs were done by the apostles let's have one more word of prayer here Heavenly Father we thank you again for tonight bless us as we look to your word just anoint me Lord let it be inspiration to me and your people I know these sermons have been a wonderful help a wonderful blessing so father just ministered by the Holy Spirit we need you Lord we need a real move of God H in our lives we need something real Lord God hallelujah we want re I want to write down real testimonies on Sunday night dear God I want to write I want to share real uh fresh testimonies Lord God with the Saints father so just let it be real here tonight we pray in Jesus Christ's name Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated I'm G to try to watch your time again I was telling sister Lena and AAA that I got another night tomorrow night so I'm going try to really watch the time and if you see me go out fast tonight it's not because I don't want to Fellowship it's I got a long day tomorrow and if I uh don't get good sleep then I'll get I probably get sick or something like that just using wisdom and I just got two more nights like that you know so I've only got two more so and then we'll be all set then I can hang around and fellowship a little more by God's grace so we're looking at the supernatural book of Acts church and remember brother bam said we are continuation of the book of Acts we're not something different we're a ation and uh I I've mentioned that before you know we went through that and and it's just wonderful it's a great reminder to see all the things we have in common with the book of Acts of course like brother randam says we preach what Paul preached right we preach the same water baptism we preach the same godhead we preach the the supernatural praise God uh we preach how there's the five-fold ministry we have the same book of Acts praise God it's a wonderful thing to see that we continuation you know when I first came to the message I could look back to the doin ination I could say wow the denomination I was raised in Assembly of God that was not a continuation of the book of Acts right the book of Acts didn't have sinful living like many of them had right they didn't have all the they didn't have cussing preachers in the book of Acts you know I'm sad to say that but that's what denominations have cussing preachers uh they didn't have all this unknown tongues with no interpretation right wherever there was tongues it was always understood right but I was raised in a church as somebody God that there was tongues there was hardly ever an interpretation right hardly ever and so we're thankful to be a continuation of the book of Acts and then brother Bram said the true church will always try to attain to what the book of Acts attained to so I love that you know when we read the book of Acts we should say that's what we need to do we need to do just what they did praise God not something different but the same Hallelujah brother Brooks one time in Guana preached a sermon called the same and and he he just used something very similar he said you know he had two cups he said here's one cup he he said here's another cup and they were totally different one was like plastic and one was foam you know one was metal he said' they're not the same and he went through all these examples then he said here's the denomination and here's the message they're not the same praise God hallelujah and the point is denominations and message churches they're different he said but then he put up the same one I don't have the same pens but then he put up the same cup with the same cup he said they're the same and he says that's what we should be our church is the same as the book of Acts Church praise God not a different church but the same church I guess I can do it like this here's the same song books right probably not crafted real well that was my fault it didn't last very long but this the point is they're the same same songs same size Hallelujah that's what we are same church Hallelujah same God same Holy Spirit same Doctrine same Fellowship praise God same communion hallelujah it's exactly the same and that's what the Bible said in verse 42 we have we have the same Doctrine same Fellowship breaking of bread prayers we have the same everything as the book of Acts praise God and what we desire of course is more wonders signs and miracles that's what we desire more of praise God hallelujah verse 44 they and all they that believe were together and had all things in common verse 45 and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men and to every man had had needs so all the needs of the church were met and of course as you read later this is speaking of some people didn't even have daily food so uh you know consider that consider if you know God did Miracles and people came in here had no food we say off the streets or something it's our duty to give them food shelter and clothing praise God if it's cold it's our duty to put a coat on their backs right that's the duty of the church okay and when that's been met then then we have all things in common as long as we all have food shelter and clothing we all have it in common because remember just a few chapters later you know people forget the book of Acts church one time they had trouble with the people that needed daily food remember that in the book of Acts I think it was chapter six if I'm not mistaken we'll get to that eventually yeah chapter six there was widows that were neglected so it was such a big church it sprang up so fast that some group of widows without husbands needed food but they were neglected imagine that a book of Acts church but the people were so on fire they forgot to feed they were so on fire for the the doctrine and everything the fellowship they forgot to feed the widows is any church perfect no there's only going to be one perfect Church really and that's when we all get glorified bodies but here the book of Acts Church they neglected to give people their daily food right and so what they have to do they say well we need people to watch over this we need special anointed men to watch over this give me seven deacons full of the Holy Ghost amen what does that prove a holy ghost filled person wants to see people fed he wants him to see him with coats right they want to see him with a shelter a holy ghost filled person wants the needs of the church met praise God Amen so that's what we must be uh book of Acts church I remember years ago there's this man and I later found out he was a drug addict but he would text me like I need the money now I need the money now and that was in my younger days and so I would just drive up i' leave my family I just drive up and give him food and pretty soon I figured out he was a drug addict and he was trying to just get everything for money well one night it was in the winter time his name was Mike I drove all the way up there from my house in no all the way up there uh right by the University of back right by the chapel there we I met him there and I bought him this tent he had no shelter I said well you can't stay at the church right you can't stay at our house I'm not letting a crazy a drug addict that live in my house I got to protect my children right I said but I'll get you a tent right I can't AF I couldn't afford a hotel I can't afford to put them up in a hotel and he wouldn't come to church he wouldn't do all these things I said but I'll get you a tent and so I bought him a tent but then later on I found out all the some of the things I bought him he went and sold it so he could get money for drugs so see Church you know as the book of Acts church we care about people we do all we can do right but it comes down to the individual they got to accept the word of God and they've got to overcome too praise God remember brother Ram let that brother Ram let this thought uh torment him for years he went to India he saw the Beggars and he's and he he got tormented like you know he would torment himself and feel like he had to he had meet every need and he used to tell the people he said neither rain or shine or anything if you need something I'll come pray for you he said but I learned I can't do that I run myself ragging and I almost killed myself he said so he said I had to learn I had to find the balance I have to do all I can do but I also got to take care of God's man Hallelujah that's the balance I've tried to find you know and I think you try to find too we want to help all the people we can help but we also have to find balance in our lives praise God right because even Jesus rested in the boat right right you know even Jesus went off to pray early in the morning praise God you know uh even Elijah had to go off in a cave and get some rest praise God so it's a we're a continuation and by God's grace church we'll always try to be like the book of Acts church and if you see us getting off into Nom denominationalism as AAA has been studying on that lately we've heard different sermons on it so it seems like the holy spirit's been dealing with her on that uh just a good a good reminder you know if we ever see it go in that direction we really got to pray Hallelujah really got to get back to the word of God and not live by Traditions but live by the word of God now remember this too all Traditions aren't bad there are some good Traditions okay let's turn there into scripture that just came to my mind let me look that up here real quick I believe it's uh Timothy but let let me let me look here oh yeah second second Thessalonians 2:15 let's go there if you got your Bible here know some people say well brother Jess we can't have any Traditions if we're in the book of Acts Church well I'm sorry you misunderstood the word you forgot there's uh there's also an era called Christian Liberties don't forget that church and the church said there's commands we got to keep those but then there's an area of Christian liberty before there's the area of sin Hallelujah so just because well you know our church has this tradition that doesn't mean it's wrong we just got to make sure we keep the sincerity inside of our tradition for example you know like I was telling brother amen if we have uh two or three Youth Services a year that's a tradition what's but what's wrong with that there's nothing wrong with that as long as our hearts are sincere now if I say at one of the youth service say well we're not going to pray for the Holy Ghost come up here and have this wafer and this wafer represents the holy ghost that would be Catholic then it' be denomination you know I never do that I'm just giving an obvious example when when a when a uh sin comes into the the tradition then the tradition's wrong but if the tradition has nothing against it it's an area of Liberty and we've got to keep that area clean from any unbelief just like a good example is communion there's nothing in the Bible says You must have communion every time you meet right so it's an area of Liberty and and that's why I you know when we were at Lima I just saw some people you know get away from the sincerity because we had it every month so when I when we started the church here and I became Pastor I said I'm not going to do it every month we'll do it every three months or whatever it is now now I want to try to do it every three months or something like that I just want to make sure our Traditions are sincere is that help therefore Brethren Stand Fast and hold your Traditions which you have been taught whether by word now look or by epistle epistle are written letters and the church said so you either got Traditions that are Bible you know our tradition to baptize is Lord Jesus Christ amen that's our tradition praise it'll always be our tradition Hallelujah but we also o might have some words that are passed down some traditions that are just passed down brother J I heard the church said this this is a good thing to do have you Services that's the most recent one we've done or have prayer and fasting or have uh have a annual Revival Services what's wrong with that there's nothing wrong with that as long as we keep our hearts pure and remember this is the book of Acts church the church in thessalonica that's a book of Acts church but remember Paul also told that church if those guys don't eat I'm sorry those guys don't work they don't eat so see we see the book of Acts you got to feed people that don't have food but now there's a balance to it unless they're lazy then they don't get any food and the church said so see I love it I love it this is a continuation the book of Acts we are a continuation of the book of Acts Church praise God Amen so we must always try brother you pray for your pastor Lord help brother Jesse always to try to attain to the book of Acts Church Hallelujah help me help my family help me or my husband or my wife help help help help our children help us always to attain to the book of Acts Church praise God hallelujah so see when they got the holy ghost or they got even saved we don't even know if these 3,000 got the holy ghost or they just got saved just Souls were added right that could be saved or filled with the Holy Ghost what they do they constantly Fellowship they wanted to be taught the doctrine they wanted to have communion they wanted to pray together they wanted to be together praise God Amen that's a book of Acts Church now I want to read a few quotes here brother BR said this where I think Pentecost failed 1955 now he said what a Time Paul had with these Corinthians now we're looking just briefly at the Corinthian Church as because they're a part of the book of Acts Church they were all seeking after different blessings and spiritual gifts and Paul had to speak to them as children but when he come to the Ephesian church he speaks to them in a different way the Church of Ephesus they are a solid gospel Church how many want to be a solid gospel church I don't want to be a flimsy jellyfish church I don't want that brother R said compromisers are like jellyfish churches right they'll compromise they'll let the women wear sexy clothes they let the men smoke and drink and cuss and carouse women that's a jellyfish church we want a solid church that's got a backbone praise God Amen they know where they stand they believe the word of God they stand behind the word and they believe all the Traditions whether by epistle or word of God hallelujah amen thank God Amen another quote 1957 brother said the Corinthians they could just believe anything but they didn't believe the right thing of course he was talking about how they let they let all these tongues and tongues go tongues go but Paul said just have three tongues interpretation in the church right see uh that's what I love about the Corinthians their book of Acts church and they really love spiritual gifts and let me say like this too Church they had a lot of spiritual gifts in other words we can't manufacture spiritual gifts we can only get in the channel and let God use the gifts that we've already got right and there could be a time and season when those gifts start moving right we'll we'll definitely see it if the children grow up and they get they get to stay at our church hopefully they get to stay at our church Hopey they don't move away too far you know but we'll especially see it in their lives and of course all of our Lives we start seeing it how oh God used that one for a testimony you know like we were talking about you know our individual gifts you know all these things that are happening in our lives the wonderful testimonies it's probably an indicator of gifts in our lives praise God but we can only be what God called us to be brother said you can't be something that you hate he used his old Kentucky English you can only be what God's called you to be praise God you stay consecrated to Jesus right and God will use you at the right time I like that brother Braham said Do you believe the Ephesian Church spoke in tongues brother Braham saidwhat certainly now Paul never wrote to them about tongues but he said certainly they did do you believe they had signs and wonders yes sir but they knowed how to place them their pastor know how to set them and put the church in order but the Corinthians didn't now so far by God's grace our church has been in order right so every time we've had an unknown tongue what have we done we prayed and got tried to get it interpretation right that's order and I've even told you this if you feel led to speak in tongues and you don't even know if there's an interpreter just speak in tongues we'll pray about it praise God I just want people to feel so free that they can be moved by the Holy Spirit and they can let God have his way praise God Amen I'm trying to yield to the Holy Spirit you're trying to yield to the Holy Spirit but we have to learn to yield to the Holy Spirit we don't want to quench the Holy Spirit right we want to yield to the Holy Spirit and let God's will be done hallelujah so it's a great thing Paul told them you've got great gifts I'm thankful for them but they didn't know how to use them he said that's the way it is in the church today it's went went on long enough till the Devils begin to slip in and give you some false signs of Wonders now remember church that's what happened at zza Street remember few months ago can everybody can everybody F uh I'm sorry rewind 10 months ago when I was preaching on zza Street remember that 1906 ever remember that April I forget which day in April 1906 the Holy Ghost fell but it was such a move of God Satan couldn't get past the gifts so he had to send witches in there to impersonate gifts right so what I'm trying to say is no matter how close we are to God no matter uh which side we're on whether lots of gifts or less gifts or big church or small Church we're going to be battled by Satan but we can overcome Satan hallelujah amen and and I've always and we always want to and you've always done it you've always been a wonderful church we never want to impersonate anything i' rather have less and have no impersonation than try to impersonate and miss it right so in other words just wait till something genuine praise God as I said a few weeks ago you'll know when it's genuine praise God like remember at Napoleon I'm talking about special services when the Holy Ghost Falls and it's very Supernatural it's very spiritual you'll know when it's God hallelujah you'll start acting differently like real differently praise God because it's God doing something it's God moving it's God manifesting something it's a visitation from Heaven praise God see now look he's always with us all the time he never leaves us or forsakes US but there sometimes he likes to visit us hallelujah in a special way that's exactly right amen there's sometimes where there's great visitations it's to give us signs Miracles or wonders now what do you think that aoon service was that was a wonder wow look what God can do when people get in one Accord look what God can do when parents and and and and spouses take work off or travel three hours across the state and show up and praise God for four services in a row that's a Wonder look what God can do amen now I'll say like this if any of those little girls got saved up there that was a uh that was a miracle because the greatest Miracle is what salvation I like that amen thank I was just going to say can I get amen good amen didn't have to ask but I just want to emphasize that's the real Miracle it's a soul saved praise God now how many of those little ones got the Holy Ghost we were guest around five yeah four five hallelujah amen glory that's an even greater miracle I mean it's a soul you're sealed to the day of your Redemption praise God hallelujah see we're just a continuation we're just keeping it going amen hallelujah we're just waving the banner Hallelujah this is the standard we're we're saying rally around the standard rally around the message of the hour rally Around Jesus Christ rally around the book of Acts that's where we gather we rally around the book of Acts Hallelujah we don't worship the Bible that's not what we're saying we're saying we're we're rallying around the the truth the Divine truth that is in the Bible praise God we never worship the Bible like I've seen people kiss the Bible you shouldn't do that that's worship almost the Bible said kiss the son lest he be angry huh the Bible never said kiss the Bible now we know the Jesus is the word of God right but this Bible itself is not Jesus's holy spirit it's a it's a bunch of paper and glue right and ink right so we have to make sure we don't worship the Bible now how you might have hugged it if it you know maybe gave you something real nice there might have slept on it if you fell asleep on your Bible but it's not to be worshiped praise God it's Jesus that gets all the worship he's the word and the Bible said he was the word he is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God Hallelujah the word is a person Hallelujah but to know the person you read his written word that's how you know him that's how he speaks to you all right now I want to read this quote before we get out of Acts chapter 2 this is a very uh famous quote if you haven't listened to the invisible Union of the bride of Christ you might want to do that I didn't listen to it I've just pulled this quote I listened to it uh earlier this year when I preached uh you never did in the first place remember that right before went to an appoint brother bam said you see she's pregnated with something he's talking about two women he's talking about the denominational church and the true church the bride of Christ because she's bringing forth members all the time see how these churches grown they're having members but what produced that what pregnancy did they get pregnated with spiritually was it God seed or was it the serpent seed only time will tell that's scriptural because the mother Harlot has children Hallelujah just kind of went from real easy to real deep real fast there brother manam said she is the denominations are bringing forth children all the time now this is as far as I'm going to go with bringing forth children but how how is she bringing forth children because she's pregnant she received the seed of serpent the LIE now can there be genuine people in they saved yes but we're talking about brother is talking about the false church and the true church amen he said but she don't want the false Church don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering blabber blabber acts 238 miserable creatures that she thinks they are amen I'm glad I'm a hollering screaming blabbering acts 238 miserable creature amen hallelujah I love being that I love being that amen I'd rather be that than anything else I could think of Amen thank God amen the denominations don't want that they want now they want somebody who's maybe shouting or blabbering but they want them to give them their all their money and get rich off them right they got a Prosperity Gospel that's usually who does it the charismatics not only are they charismatic they make up their gifts they make up their false prophecies not only do they do that but they want your money you know there's people there's preachers that pretend to be like brother brandom and they got their phone up there and they're searching Instagram about people that are at the meeting and they pretend to discern them and tell them the secrets of their heart and they're crying and all these things and they proved it they're just they're just surfing Instagram the people that are there or Facebook and telling them uh is your address so and so uh bunch of liars that's charismatic that that's what I'm talking about that's the woman who's bringing forth members all the time pretending God's spirit doesn't pretend God's spirit is a truth hallelujah amen hallelujah God won't lie God don't play around God don't tease God is truth he's always truth he always will be the truth praise God but Ram said it would certainly embarrass her in Acts 238 miserable creature would embarrass the Catholic church church you would embarrass say like I'm not sure how far I should go on that some say sometimes when we visit other churches I can tell some people are embarrassed because of our clapping and singing shouting not everybody I noticed I said not I said some of them some of them were like I see them I'm up at the front I can see people's faces but some of them are starting to get loose you know I'm like Glory come on let's be acts 238 young amen it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific Society Church that she belonged to here they would throw her out at the next Council she can't have it no she don't want to be pregnated with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth there's only one kind of Christian that's the Holy Ghost acts 238 screaming hollering blabbing acts 238 younging praise God that's the only kind the word can bring forth hallelujah amen I love that praise God because that's how I got the Holy Ghost screaming crying blabbering shaking hallelujah oh thank God Amen it's the only kind that the word can bring forth now let's go to those Devils lying in some of those message churches oh it's the Holy Ghost without sensation now what you do about that quote see they say there's there's no sensation what about this one brother said the only kind that ever comes forth are screaming holling blabbering good blabbering tonight Malachi sometimes I want to shake your hand say LD I really enjoyed that blabbering you did there Hallelujah wonderful screaming there sister who I appreciate that Hallelujah you're a real acts 238 person that's the only kind not every every service but when the Holy Ghost Falls like I said a couple weeks ago how can eternal life come in and life doesn't respond praise God you've that's all you've ever wanted is eternal life if eternal life ever comes in there you've got the desire of your soul you've got the desire of your heart something has to happen praise God you had no life or just a perverted life and now you've got eternal life something that body has to respond hallelujah amen glory oh we're ready for Revival Services amen couple weeks away here by God's grace trying to get you stirred up trying to get myself stirred up brother said now notice what the denomination loves watch her L her you want to see who she's in love with the word says this but she says no my church says this then who is she in love with who's her husband who is the husband of the Catholic Church Satan I'll say like this who's the husband of the US government Satan now not everybody's in there satanic like brother BR you know like brother Bram said we're not against the people in the denominations we're against the system the Demonic Source behind it right her own fruits prove what she is exactly right shows what she is he said that's a lover of the world she claims that she's born the second time to Christ but notice her lover she said but she loves the world right they love the selfies on Tik Tock and whatever showing off their bodies you know look at me they love that because they love the world and the Bible said if you love the world you don't even have God's love trying to make a few bucks why don't you go work at the grocery store or something like that or why don't you go work at Walmart or make a honest Buck praise God come work at my school I need some workers at the school PR anywhere just work somewhere get an honest dollar Hallelujah but see they love the world more than they love God brother man said another thing notice the kind of children that she's bearing the denominations that tells who her papa is whether it's the first Adam or the second Adam so brother man says the first Adam was denominational right Adam sinned so sin the second Adam is Christ amen he said if the church brings forth a child of the second Adam he acts like the second Adam's way of acting like they did on the day of Pentecost hallelujah what they do on the day of Pentecost they got baptized what did they do after that they said teach me the word of God teach me the doctrine and they said let's have communion Hallelujah is that right and then they said let's not stop after a few weeks let's continue this thing hallelujah amen let's not just do this for a little while let's be in this all the way praise God this is worth my life this is worth my energy this is worth everything to me because it's eternal life hallelujah amen and I'm bored not from the first Adam really I'm born from the second Adam Hallelujah right my mother the church birth me right the Church of the Liv the firstborn Hallelujah my father was the second Adam Christ Hallelujah I've been born again of the word of God The Incorruptible seed of God hallelujah he said that's really the true second Adam's children acting like they did on the day of Pentecost but her daughters are painted faed bobbed haed wear men's clothes trousers the Bible said for her not to do it she cuts her hair it's a shame for her to do that you say brother Ram shut up on that he said that's what the word says I'm only pointing out the nature that's what she does he said her sons the denominations they rely on education well Jesse you didn't go to Seminary I don't have to go to Seminary all they're going to do is pollute my mind right it's just going to turn into a cemetery right Seminary is a cemetery that's all it is it's where you go to die but said The more degrees you get the further you get from God in a seminary Hallelujah I got two natural degrees I got a a ma a bachelor's and a master's but I'd say this I'm closer to God than I ever was because I know more and I obey more the church said say it ought be the same for you so my natural degrees has nothing to do with my spiritual life because I'm not getting degrees about God I'm just getting degrees to try to make a few extra bucks for my family Hallelujah but it's it's how much can you grow spiritually praise God like the brother said I got a degree of neology I've been praying all my knees for decades now is that right how many want to graduate with that degree and a degree of Ney not an honorary degree but a real degree amen a real degree that I prayed on my knees amen I sought God I keep seeking God hallelujah that's what he said this woman relies on the denominational Church some Bible School so-called some great College that's supposed to be from a long time ago he said they're denominational Seekers religious like Cain but illegitimate to the word as Cain was God never did organize a denomination right he's always been against it his word is against it Hallelujah okay I'll stop all right there move on I got 20 minutes okay bl's PL time all right go to Acts chapter 3 now I wanted I wanted to finish that with Acts chapter 2 tonight I wanted you to remember that brother Ram had those quotes the true church can only bring forth children like Acts chapter 2 everybody has to have an Acts chapter 2 experience somehow somewhere right that's how the church is born and if you're ever born you'll act like they did on the day of Pentecost at some point in your life right at some point we don't know how much we have to act like that but we know this we want to be in the spirit as much as possible but clapping singing shouting and crying that's doesn't always mean the spirit right that can just be human emotion but we want to have we want to have one time where we know a birth happened life came in power came in a testimony came in Hallelujah an experience happened and you know you're different from that point on and then the rest of your life will prove that that was a genuine experience Hallelujah that then that's your and that's when the devil battles me and say well you're not born again that wasn't a real birth I said well devil look at my life look at these I said I got it in 2003 here I am 20 years later amen since I got the Holy Ghost I didn't even know that here I am look at my life does my life look like the book of Acts or not do I preach the book of Acts do I live the book of Acts do I try to do everything like the book of Acts that's exactly my that's my pattern praise that's my blueprint brother Ram said the blueprint is the Bible the blueprint is the book of Acts and I built my life I tried to build this church by preaching I tried to build this church upon the blueprint of the book of act act hallelujah amen amen and where do they say in the book of Acts they're the greatest of all time they didn't say that that's one proof I'm not building into domination remember the same people that said that are now saying now we're just seconds from the Rapture back at last year they said there were days and minutes from the Rapture and now they're saying we're seconds a church not to disagree with any godly man but to me that's just a lack of understanding because seconds passed how many seconds have passed since they said that last Sunday how many seconds have passed when and these are the same people that you know they falsely predict people are going to be healed and they die so I you know to me God's word will make somebody humble God's word will make somebody teachable and not try to move the people by fear but let's move the people by the word of God that the same people that said uh there's no more scriptures left to be fulfilled before the Rapture well then why hasn't the Rapture happened if all the scripture has been fulfilled how come the Rapture hasn't happened because there's scripture left to be fulfilled there's Souls left to be saved there's preaching left to be done right Jesus said in Luke 21 when the fullness of the Gentiles come in then God will return to the Jews well that means there's still scripture there's still we need missionaries praise God now how many want to line up and be a missionary don't raise your hand especially the brothers or sisters how many want to be married to a missionary and leave and go to a real destitute country where you might not have all the blessings of America you might not have Plumbing like brother digs just got back from Guyana where we used to go and once you leave the city there's no Plumbing there's no Plumbing you got to get water down from the river I stayed at the camp Cam and I stay at the camp there for what seven days or whatever five days there's no Plumbing you go in that restroom you go in that ous that's back to the ous it's hot in there there there's no air conditioning in there and that's all day every day and there's no flush you can't flush it's just a hole in the ground now how many want to be missionary wives now see how many want to be Miss how many preachers want to leave all the blessings of now go there or get eat up by mosquitoes like I did I don't want to do that I might have to if God calls me that but it's the reality of it what do we need we their scriptures will be fulfilled we need preachers we need missionaries Amen brother said we need more of them praise God yes brother Bram brother Bram I feel call to preach and I preach he said get out there and preach Hallelujah we need more preachers Hallelujah we need more people preaching the book of Acts Hallelujah baptizing in Jesus Christ's name amen praying for the sick and the sick shall recover hallelujah amen that's what we need more of how' I get on that praise God I don't know Acts chapter 3 ver1 but Peter and John went up together into the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour now there's a good example there's a tradition of man right there where does the bible say somebody show me where does the New Testament say you have to pray at the n9th hour which is three o'clock how many of you prayed at three o'clock today you stop what you're doing and pray anybody pray at three o'clock why because it's not in the Bible but it was a tradition that they had the Jews I think if I'm not mistaken they would pray at the sixth hour the 9th the 12 12 yeah the six 6th 9th and 12th 12th hour that's why Daniel Prayed three times a day now the Muslims pray five times a day and it's not shame on us because they're they're doing it out of a demon Spirit they're trying to impersonate real religion but they don't have real religion it's a false lying religion that likes to murder people that's a it's a shame on them but the Bible said also we're supposed to pray without ceasing so see you got to balance that out but here they're just following a Jewish tradition they're not under the law they're je they're they're Christians now verse two and a certain uh man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask arms of them that entered into the temple Now isn't that a great place how would you like it if there was a man begging out here every service before you came would you give to him every service will you start dividing your money well I usually give $10 for offering every week so I'll give if I know he's going to be there I'll give him five $5 on Wednesday and I'll get five on Sunday see how you start having these I I need to help out the poor traditions we have to serve God in our Traditions verse three who seeing Peter and John about to go in the temple asked on and alms and Peter now look at this look at this Faith fastening his eyes upon him with John I don't know this but it looks like he probably a vision because how could you say this without a vision and said look on us and he gave heed unto to them expecting to receive something of them then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk now that's power right there numerous times I've been asked to pray for people that couldn't walk and I pray with all my heart but God didn't move at that moment but I've had the faith to pray one time was in Trinidad I don't I think Ghana was other time oh the other one was over there in Pennsylvania that's right Pennsylvania last time I was out there last last year about this time and you just I just Tred to ask him have you confessed your sin I try to pray as much as I can as much Faith as I can but there's no doubt Peter knew he must had a vision he was a prophet he must have knew this man's going to rise he must have seen it praise God because we know later didn't he see cornelius's house right didn't he see the Visions rise kill and eat Angels gonna come take you to a man's house he was a prophet and notice here verse seven and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength look at that that immedate this is a miracle Hallelujah and the Miracle's done in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah oh it's beautiful a true Miracle he never even walked from his womb imagine it's like a baby elephant they can walk on the day that they're born they just they're born and as soon as they get their bounce they're walking that's what God did here amen he took something from the Animal Kingdom amen he never walked but now you're now you're healed now you can walk immediate strength in the in the in the joint I'm sorry in the joints in the bones think about that praise God immediately Powers going given into the the joints this is a level of Faith where this is no doubt a sign Miracle or wonder something was one of those or maybe all three Hallelujah now going on to verse 16 everybody gets moved by this oh don't forget he went uh dancing and leaping all around the church there praise God and Jesus said if you get if you get accused he said do the same thing leap and dance and praise the Lord hallelujah verse 16 Peter's testifying here he says and his name now this is I like what scoffield said this is the second sermon in the Bible in the book of Acts the first one was the day of Pentecost so here's his second sermon and his name through faith in his name Ha made this man strong what's made you strong it's been the name of Jesus Christ how'd you make it through this week how'd you become a Christian in the first place how'd you get the Holy Ghost it was the name of Jesus Christ strengthen you hallelujah amen that's see I'll say like this it's the only thing that'll strengthen you it's the only thing that'll strengthen me is the name of Jesus Christ the power of God the Holy Spirit we should sing that song I just speak the name of Jesus Hallelujah over my family over this church Hallelujah over our lost loved ones over our sicknesses over our confusion let's speak the name of Jesus there's power in the name of Jesus am hard did this man he's never walked how do he walk and get immediate strike his name through faith in his name and what is faith brother tells us it's a revelation so God gave the Revelation to Peter that this man was going to be healed here hallelujah I love that verse Faith through the name of Jesus Christ go on to verse 21 this is a great message verse this would be good for you know uh sister Lena and sister Zer here and the children if you haven't heard this one I use this one a lot in the book uh the 12 New Testament Ministries let's actually read verse 20 and he shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you whom the Heaven Must receive until so Heaven is going to hold Jesus's body until when the times of restitution of all things which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began okay so that's why we know this this new testament teaching must be restored and then Jesus can come because heaven receives him Heaven holds Jesus Jesus constrained there by God's plan right he's restrained there until all things are restored until every nation has heard the message amen heard the gospel to every name glory to every name that's on that beautiful L's book of life has been received the Holy Ghost on Earth amen oh and then after that then Jesus can come back because the church is has been restored it's not a different church it's the same church restored it's the same church continued praise God oh my amen thank God I love I love this praise God I'm just continuing the same thing that was in the book of Acts that's I'm just preaching the same thing they did in the book of Acts I love it I love I don't I don't have to go to school and get some new understanding about the book of Acts I can just read the book of Acts and say that's what I believe Hallelujah that's a restoration scripture there I don't know if that's new to you or not but that's where we get it and then go to Matthew 1711 here's another one you pull up there Cas it's probably faster than me turning there because we're short on time here and Jesus answered and said unto his the disciples Elijah truly shall first come and restore all things now brother Ram tells us plainly when Moses and Elijah come in the tribulation uh Elijah doesn't restore the law they're not trying to restore the law right because they're trying to get them to Christ they're trying to get them uh to weep and mourn from house to house right so this speaks of a different Elijah and this wasn't John the Baptist because John the Baptist didn't restore the Bible said uh John the Baptist declared the way of the Lord he made straight the paths of the Lord he's a voice in the wilderness crying right uh the day of the Lord is at hand I believe I mix that up a little bit but the voice of one crying in the wilderness praise God that was John so this has has to be another man who's got a prophetic Ministry just like Elijah and he restores all things oh hallelujah amen see I was in Pentecost and there was partially restored we had uh justification I guess we didn't have sanctification I guess they skipped sanctification um because they were already rotting right the denomination was rotting from the inside but at one point they had sanctification remember remember William Seymour had sanctification remember they believed that's how he got that's how they eventually got the Holy Ghost he believed in total sanctification of heart and life remember that that uh the black brother who just had sight in one eye remember he was he went to a wesleyian group and they taught him sanctification it's more than just being saved we got to live holy too we got to get some new thoughts about our lives and this is not about me my life's not about pleasure my life's not about me having fun my life's about serving God hallelujah amen and now I need the Holy Ghost praise God I want my soul on fire hallelujah amen okay now restoration now those are two scriptures on restoration and of course Joel to I restore sayith the Lord we don't have to read that I preach on that recently now let me say this too Jesus said more blessed are this are are they who believe in Christ's Resurrection but haven't seen it so we get a greater bless bling if we believe in Christ yet haven't seen the most outstanding Miracles I hope somebody can say Amen to that in other words it doesn't matter if we didn't see brother Ram's Ministry it doesn't matter if we saw eyes form in people's sockets like some of the the Saints did in brother Bram day it doesn't matter as long as we believe in it Hallelujah as long as we believe in the book of Acts Church Jesus said you're more blessed if you believe without seeing something but God is so gracious if you want to see something God will let you see something like I said before just hang around hang around pretty soon you're going to see something Hallelujah some Supernatural move of God something that is unexplainable amen had to be God hallelujah but then you'll see you'll see it like every just like Israel right Israel saw the Red Sea part of but what they forgot about it just a few days later and church don't you know if God does something great for you don't you know the enem is going to fight you you're probably going to forget about it a few days later right that that's why the the signs don't save us salvation saves us repentance water baptism getting a new heart instead of a Stony heart a heart of Flesh that's what saves us hallelujah a new heart but thank God for the signs wonders and miracles don't get me wrong thank God we need that praise God they cause some people to believe I'm just saying that's not what saves repentance and baptism and trust in Jesus Christ the love for the cross that's what saves Hallelujah the finished work of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and the church said amen I'm almost done here all this screaming and blabbering sorry I guess that's just how I was born that's true Hallelujah okay now I left my book there I Clos my Bible okay Acts chapter three so Peter preaches his second sermon bless you now Acts chapter 4 and this is what I ended with last time but let's read verse 1 2 3 and 4 and as they spake upon I'm sorry unto the people the the priest and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees Came Upon them being grieved that they taught the people and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead that's what people don't want you to preach that Jesus Christ is resurrected and if he's resurrected that means he's here hallelujah he's not in some school he's not some denomination he's here praise God because he said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age praise God they don't want to live in Christ they just want to have some denominational rules and live by that but we got to let Jesus into the church praise God now verse two or verse three and they laid hands on them and put them in hold unto the next day for was now even tied now many of us will say my I wish I could have seen a lame man walk but do you also want to get thrown in jail for a night would you do that and would you pray to God you know wherever you are in your most honest place would you be that willing to sacrifice to see the supernatural it's just something good to remember now in this chapter they only go to jail for the night they don't get beat up okay then in verse later on in the chapter it says they only get threatened let me find that verse thought I had it right there oh yeah 21 421 so they spend the night in jail all because they just preached and they saw a paralyzed man walk and dance and leap and Shout praise God they get hands L on Malachi can you stand up now if if I was going to arrest this guy he's bigger than me he could probably throw me down right but if I was goingon to arrest him how would I do it I'd have to get him like this right I say you come here I'm gonna throw you in the Patty wagon or have to you know grab him or something like this if I'm really going to arrest him well the the disciples got treated like like that now Church don't forget this before they could do this before they could do this now you can take a seat Satan had to go up to God and say well they only serve you because they got a big church 3,000 and God said you can touch them but save their life don't kill them yet and Satan went off and said all right I'm gonna get him now I'm gonna go get him I'm gonna throw him in jail and God must have said don't beat them all you can do is arrest them put them in jail for the night now how many want to be a real book of Acts Church see what I'm saying remember Church nothing can happen to you except God allowed it first God allowed them to push you into the prison God allowed you to maybe they didn't feed you all night think about that I'm not saying we'll ever go through that I don't even know we don't know when the no man knows the day or the hour I'm saying this is this is our continuation this is our church and brother R said thus sayith the Lord the same persecution that Rome put on the Christians Is Coming To America thus sayith the Lord we know it it's Romans I'm sorry it's Revelation chapter 13 the mark of the beast being laid down Satan said well they only serve you because you know they saw fire they saw a pillar of fire and they felt the rushan Mighty Wind that's the only reason they serve you he said fine go you can go test them but don't hurt them only lock them up in prison that's all you can do Satan said all right I'm gonna do that well guess what happened a few days later Satan went back he got more permission to beat them remember it can't happen unless God allowed it and Satan had to ask for it too the church said am then church don't forget later God in his Sovereign will said Satan go ahead and take James's life and then when and then God God let the enemy take James's life he was one of the what the second martyr and also the same thing God said go ahead and take Steven's life devil and think about that we would think oh these young lives they they were taken away but don't forget the honor that these men are going to get as well don't forget the martyr's crown right there's two kinds of crowns there's a Crown of Life and there's the crown for the martyrs remember I preached on that last earlier this summer and and don't think Stephen or James for one second would say oh it was awful you know or oh I wish it never would have happened the Bible said they were honored to to suffer for the name of Jesus Christ it was an honor and then think Peter you know Peter gets locked locked up in prison but but God or Jesus tells the devil you can arrest him but don't touch his life because he said I'm sending my angel I'm not telling you devil I'm sending my angels down there to go get him out of there praise God Amen because he needs to preach Hallelujah and then later Peter would mess up with the segregation right but then he'd get it right he'd repent and get things right he prayed for people with get the Holy Ghost all these wonderful things that's the book of Acts Church how many thankful would be a part of the book of Acts Church remember brother R said that I read this to you last time let me tell you if you want the devil stirred up just start preaching Divine Healing Peter preached on the day of Pentecost and 3,000 Souls were saved Satan never even moved right they didn't from the day of Pentecost till that day where the man was healed we don't hear of any persecution on them it only came so Satan didn't Satan didn't bother their Revival services Satan didn't bother their water baptism Services he only got upset when the supernatural Miracle started happen that would convince some people to believe that's when he got upset he said a couple days afterwards he healed a man at the gate called Beautiful who was lame and all hell turned loose on him but what was the hell that turned loose it was grabbing him like I grabbed Malachi grabbing him and pulling off the prison locking him up and not letting him out for a whole night and then threatening him don't you ever preach don't you ever teach in that name again you you can go now that was all hell breaking loose on the early church but did the church persevere did the church overcome did the church give
