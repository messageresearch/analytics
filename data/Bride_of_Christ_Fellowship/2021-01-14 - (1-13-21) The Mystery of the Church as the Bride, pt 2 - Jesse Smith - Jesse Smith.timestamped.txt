[32:45] church as
[32:46] bride ephesians 5
[32:49] [Music]
[32:54] 32.
[33:08] ephesians 5 32 thank you and i don't
[33:09] have any slides tonight case just so you
[33:11] can just
[33:11] focus on the scriptures honey thank you
[33:13] very much i appreciate that
[33:16] let's look at part two tonight of the
[33:18] church as bride
[33:21] again the fact that jesus has a bride is
[33:24] commonly understood
[33:26] but the mystery is which group is the
[33:28] bride that's the mystery
[33:30] and it's the bride who pleases the lord
[33:33] in all things praise god the bride that
[33:37] submissive
[33:38] to every command of jesus amen
[33:41] so let's read this ephesians 5 32. then
[33:44] we've got to read our memory verse
[33:45] got to get back to that habit uh
[33:49] in first samuel
[33:52] all right let's read our our text here
[33:54] tonight let's read this together on
[33:55] three
[33:56] one two three this is a great mystery
[34:00] but i speak concerning christ and the
[34:03] church
[34:04] first samuel 17 17-47
[34:20] praise god
[34:23] this is what we want to know praise god
[34:25] in every battle the lord will save us
[34:27] not by our strength but by his
[34:30] let's read this on three one two three
[34:33] and all this
[34:34] assembly shall know that the lord saveth
[34:37] not
[34:37] with sword and spear for the battle is
[34:40] the lord's
[34:41] and he will give you into our hands
[34:44] let's have one more word of prayer here
[34:46] heavenly father lord we just come
[34:48] reverently before your throne
[34:50] lord this is the time that where lord
[34:52] your word
[34:53] is to bring life it's to impart life to
[34:56] the hearers
[34:57] faith comes by hearing so lord increase
[35:00] our faith tonight lord god
[35:02] especially with this subject that we're
[35:03] the bride and lord give us assurance
[35:06] that we're the bride because we keep
[35:07] your commands
[35:08] by your grace as we said on sunday you
[35:11] keep giving us more grace and
[35:12] let us abound in the grace of obeying
[35:14] your word lord
[35:16] and uh let us abound in the grace of of
[35:18] generosity lord
[35:19] in faith in utterance the lord with this
[35:22] topic let us abound in
[35:24] faith of obedience to all your word lord
[35:27] wash us in your word tonight lord with
[35:29] your water your living waters
[35:31] wash us lord that we're clean that we're
[35:33] obeying all your commands
[35:35] in jesus christ's name and the saint
[35:36] said amen god bless you as you're being
[35:42] seated
[35:47] okay so we will look at this thought
[35:49] here i'll set my timer here give me
[35:50] let's
[35:50] do 45 minutes
[35:55] actually i'll do 40 because we're a
[35:56] little bit over as it is
[36:07] all right now we looked at part one on
[36:10] sunday
[36:12] and we focused on uh what the confusion
[36:15] was
[36:16] and then we looked at uh all the
[36:18] scriptures where jesus and the
[36:20] john the baptist speak of a bride and a
[36:22] bridegroom how many believe that's
[36:24] scriptural
[36:25] everybody see that in the scripture i
[36:26] know lydia milk i did a lot of reading
[36:28] for me so thank you
[36:30] uh but it's clearly scriptural it's not
[36:32] something we've started it's not
[36:34] something brother branham started
[36:35] it's something jesus christ and john the
[36:37] baptist started
[36:39] right and even before that god started
[36:41] it
[36:42] with with israel praise god because he
[36:44] loved the fathers of the faith
[36:46] like abraham isaac and jacob
[36:49] now
[36:53] now with this mystery church we see how
[36:55] not only does
[36:56] jesus have a rulership position but he
[36:59] has a feminine counterpart in lydia
[37:01] that's the good words he gave me
[37:03] a feminine counterpart to jesus's
[37:06] masculine role okay so there's a
[37:09] feminine role
[37:10] to jesus's masculine role okay because
[37:13] remember it takes both remember when god
[37:15] created adam and eve
[37:16] he created one or both of them in his
[37:18] image first he created one spirit
[37:20] and the spirit was both male and female
[37:23] but then he divided the spirits and put
[37:24] him in separate bodies
[37:26] and so god has a a part that's
[37:29] submissive about him and a part that's
[37:30] very dominant about him praise god
[37:34] now he he gives jesus christ in this
[37:36] case the dominant part as husband
[37:39] and he gives the bride the submissive
[37:40] part
[37:43] how many will learn to be more
[37:44] submissive to jesus praise god
[37:48] when it's uh hard and we want to do what
[37:50] we want to do
[37:51] may god help us to have a submissive
[37:53] attitude where we do what jesus wants us
[37:56] to do
[37:59] i know he'll help us if you really
[38:00] desire that church i know he'll he'll
[38:02] help you
[38:04] now i'd like to uh look at a few
[38:07] scriptures here
[38:12] uh that kind of show and i put this kind
[38:14] of in the introduction chapter of the
[38:15] book lord willing
[38:17] the bible is the ultimate love story
[38:21] right we know god's love is great the
[38:25] bible said for god
[38:26] so loved the world
[38:29] remember church keep in mind there the
[38:31] bible said god doesn't delight in the
[38:33] death of sinners right
[38:35] but yet jesus wouldn't pray for the
[38:37] world
[38:39] and yet he sends the disciples into all
[38:41] the world to preach the gospel
[38:42] to every creature so we see god uh
[38:46] god the father he so loves
[38:50] all his creation and he would he would
[38:52] desire all would be saved
[38:54] because god is the ultimate source of
[38:56] love the best word that we can describe
[38:58] god is love right god is love
[39:02] this love was so great that he planned
[39:05] for jesus to be slain
[39:07] before the foundation of the world so
[39:09] before the world was even
[39:11] settled god already had the idea in his
[39:13] mind i'm going to provide
[39:14] a sacrifice i'm going to send my son
[39:18] to die for my bride's sins
[39:21] praise god amen the ones that i love and
[39:23] the ones that love me
[39:25] i've already got it planned out i'll
[39:26] send us an aw sufficient sacrifice
[39:29] that will pay the price of my bride's
[39:31] sins
[39:32] amen he planned this way before you got
[39:35] here
[39:36] right he already had this all set up
[39:38] already knew all about it
[39:39] he was gonna he already had a plan to
[39:41] take care of your sins
[39:43] and so that you would know you're lovely
[39:45] in the sight of god
[39:46] amen
[39:49] we could never be lovely with our sins
[39:51] on us but he pre-planned a way that oh
[39:54] they can be lovely
[39:55] they can be clean by a substitutionary
[39:58] righteousness
[39:59] i'll share my righteousness with them
[40:01] i'll take their filthiness
[40:03] and i'll put it on my righteous son and
[40:05] we'll trade we'll trade
[40:07] his his righteousness for their
[40:09] unrighteousness
[40:11] by substitution praise god and then
[40:14] remember the bible said god love you so
[40:16] much he chose you
[40:17] in him before the foundation of the
[40:19] world
[40:20] remember he chose you by predestination
[40:22] he knew you'd want to serve
[40:24] him and that's how he could choose you
[40:27] and then he predestinated the events of
[40:29] your life so he would be close to you
[40:32] and that you could seek after and find
[40:34] him
[40:36] isn't that something you know god put us
[40:37] in america because he knew we'd love him
[40:40] right and he knew there would be
[40:42] believers close to us
[40:44] praise god notice he didn't put us in a
[40:47] sinful nation right like that
[40:49] hardly going to have anybody saved in it
[40:51] right
[40:52] the bible said he'd place us so he would
[40:55] be close
[40:55] to us and we could seek after and find
[40:59] him amen
[41:00] i like that praise god god wanted to
[41:02] give us a chance he knew we'd love him
[41:04] so he gave us a chance to seek after him
[41:07] and find him
[41:08] so let me say this to our young people
[41:09] you know this is a great opportunity
[41:11] in your free time before you get busy
[41:13] and you got to pay your house and
[41:15] and before you got to serve a husband or
[41:16] wife this is your time to seek god
[41:20] now mommy and i do right in our in our
[41:22] humble little ways
[41:24] but god ordained it so you have a time
[41:26] to seek after the lord
[41:28] and find him praise god when life
[41:31] doesn't have as much
[41:33] stress on it or responsibility and i'm
[41:35] glad i found god in college before the
[41:37] all the big events happened before we
[41:40] started having children i'm glad
[41:42] uh god found me and i found him before i
[41:44] was even married praise god
[41:46] so i had that time to dedicate to
[41:49] seeking god and that's what our children
[41:50] should do
[41:51] amen
[41:54] now god sets up our lives like a hide
[41:57] and seek romance
[42:00] and it's just like uh jesus describes
[42:03] in the bible jesus is the bridegroom
[42:06] christians are the earthly bride
[42:10] now jesus is the pro god is the primary
[42:12] seeker
[42:13] because he says you've not chosen me but
[42:16] i've chosen you
[42:17] of course this speaks of the earthly
[42:19] right because in heaven he had to
[42:21] predestinate
[42:22] knowing our choice so earthly
[42:26] no man is going to seem like he's sought
[42:29] or he's chosen god
[42:30] god's going to seek him out and find him
[42:34] because paul says there's none that
[42:35] seeketh god
[42:37] right so how can we get saved well god
[42:39] foreknew
[42:40] that we want to serve him so that he can
[42:42] seek and save
[42:43] that which was lost see god
[42:47] it's god who seeks and gives every good
[42:49] and perfect gift
[42:50] even our faith is a gift
[42:53] there'll be no man that can boast for
[42:54] working to gain the salvation of the
[42:57] lord
[42:59] god loves to be the seeker in this
[43:01] romance
[43:03] praise god scripture says god searches
[43:06] for all those who will worship him
[43:08] in spirit and in truth see there's
[43:12] something even about people that aren't
[43:13] in the message that we love why do we
[43:15] love them
[43:15] because they love truth right because
[43:18] that's what god's looking for
[43:20] if they won't take the spirit if they
[43:21] want to take the anointing the holy
[43:22] spirit
[43:23] at least they'll have some truth god
[43:26] loves that
[43:27] god's searching for and then he'll take
[43:28] the people that love the holy spirit
[43:30] anointing
[43:31] but don't have as much truth praise god
[43:33] but see we ought to have both praise god
[43:35] we have both the spirit
[43:37] and truth because that's what god
[43:41] is seeking he comes to seek and save
[43:44] that which was lost
[43:46] remember god wanted to hover over
[43:48] jerusalem and protect her like
[43:50] her brood right but israel turned
[43:54] him down you know the bible says that
[43:57] god
[43:58] sought for a man in the days of noah but
[43:59] he only found one
[44:01] let's read genesis 6. can you put
[44:02] genesis 6 8-9 up here
[44:07] see god is always searching around
[44:10] looking for somebody to use and children
[44:13] that's why you get up and read your
[44:14] bible that's why you get up and pray
[44:16] because
[44:16] god's seeking for you to do that he's
[44:19] seeking you he's seeking to use you
[44:21] praise god even now he wants to use this
[44:24] so he's always seeking
[44:25] goes around about through all the world
[44:27] seeking who he can use for a work
[44:32] now yep six eight and nine but the
[44:36] noah found grace in the eyes of the lord
[44:39] and these are the generations of noah
[44:41] noah was a just man and perfect in his
[44:42] generations
[44:44] and noah walked with god amen
[44:48] so the whole world god couldn't find too
[44:50] many but he found noah remember the
[44:52] bible said
[44:52] that god was long-suffering he wanted
[44:54] lots of people to get in the ark
[44:56] but they turned him down and so god had
[44:59] to flood
[45:00] the whole world so noah here and his two
[45:02] sons and their wives
[45:04] were the only ones that were seeking
[45:05] after god's righteousness
[45:07] i like that they kept hammering away
[45:09] right isn't that what we're doing
[45:11] tonight we're just
[45:11] hammering away praise god is our ark
[45:14] full of people
[45:15] no was noah's ark full of people no
[45:19] right but we keep hammering away praise
[45:20] god because like it was in the days of
[45:22] noah
[45:23] so shall be in the days of the coming of
[45:24] the son of man
[45:26] just keep hammering away just keep
[45:28] living the truth just keep living a
[45:30] righteous life
[45:31] and i like that he did it because he was
[45:33] saving his family the bible said
[45:35] amen that's why our husbands and our
[45:38] wives are here that's why our parents
[45:39] bring our children here we keep pounding
[45:41] away because we want our families to be
[45:44] saved he the bible said he did it for
[45:47] the saving of his house
[45:48] praise god in hebrews 11.
[45:52] so see that proves eternal life
[45:55] for our parents right the parents that
[45:58] are here that bring their children here
[46:00] on sundays of course it proves eternal
[46:03] life you're living for your children
[46:05] you're living for them to have another
[46:07] chance to hear the word of god amen
[46:10] that's right so god's love is constantly
[46:13] seeking
[46:15] and he found one in noah's day or three
[46:17] in noah's day three men and their wives
[46:19] and here he finds a small bride today
[46:24] now let's look at song of solomon just
[46:26] for a moment here
[46:32] uh let's go to song of solomon five
[46:34] people up song psalm in five
[46:36] verses six seven and eight
[46:44] now here's a beautiful picture uh
[46:46] remember solomon of course represents
[46:47] christ millennium son of david
[46:52] now here's a beautiful picture of how
[46:54] god likes to feel
[46:56] love as well right
[46:59] god likes to be sought as well now
[47:02] ultimately we know he's the main seeker
[47:04] he seeks after us
[47:05] but god likes the romantic drama as well
[47:08] he likes the suspense as well
[47:10] he likes when his children cry out to
[47:12] him right that's why brother ram said
[47:14] god made the babies with ability all
[47:15] they can do is cry
[47:17] so they cry out to their prayer and the
[47:19] parent hears their cry
[47:21] and so it is with god and his children
[47:23] god loves the earth children cry out and
[47:25] seek for his help
[47:26] and he loves to answer praise god i
[47:29] opened
[47:30] my beloved but my beloved had withdrawn
[47:32] himself
[47:33] and was gone my soul failed when he
[47:36] spake i sought him but i could not find
[47:38] him i called him but he gave me no
[47:40] answer
[47:41] the watchmen that went about the city
[47:43] found me they smote me they wounded me
[47:45] the keepers of the walls took
[47:47] away my veil for me i charge you
[47:48] daughters of jerusalem
[47:50] if you find my beloved that you tell him
[47:52] that i'm sick
[47:53] of his love so we get the picture of
[47:56] here that she didn't respond
[47:58] quick enough to the husband right but
[48:01] the husband of course
[48:02] he would be loving to his wife but she
[48:05] says make sure you tell him
[48:07] that i'm looking for him right and so
[48:10] that's how
[48:10] the bride is today the bride you know
[48:12] we're seeking after god we're calling on
[48:14] god
[48:15] god loves to be sought after god loves
[48:18] to be
[48:18] prayed to amen god loves to be
[48:20] worshipped amen
[48:22] and of course we know in the story that
[48:24] eventually he finds
[48:27] they find one another and then marriage
[48:29] bliss ensues right
[48:32] remember the bible said god is a god
[48:34] that hides himself
[48:37] the bible says it's the glory of god to
[48:39] conceal a thing
[48:40] but the honor of kings to search out a
[48:42] matter
[48:44] so see when uh when god kind of hides
[48:47] himself it gives us an
[48:49] opportunity to sow to show some godly
[48:51] character
[48:53] to show some royal blood right to show
[48:56] that we have royal spiritual blood
[48:57] inside of us amen
[48:59] because only king search out the truth
[49:01] praise god
[49:03] only queens seek out the truth
[49:06] right those who truly love god that's
[49:09] why god hides himself i emailed to a
[49:10] brother
[49:11] this week he was saying why does god
[49:13] make it so hard or why does god hide
[49:14] himself i said
[49:15] because it's going to just it's going to
[49:16] distinguish between the bride and the
[49:18] foolish right
[49:20] it's going to distinguish who really
[49:21] wants to know it praise god
[49:23] amen who really wants to know god who
[49:26] really wants to know his heart
[49:27] who's really after the heart of god amen
[49:31] praise god
[49:36] yes sometimes god will hide himself on
[49:39] purpose
[49:40] until we cry out in desperation
[49:43] that's found in uh go to proverbs 2
[49:46] okay 3 4 and 5. proverbs 2 3
[49:49] 4 5.
[49:54] so see god calls him his hiding he's
[49:56] hiding treasures
[49:59] so you know how the world likes that
[50:01] easter egg hunt you know
[50:03] that's really what god wants to do with
[50:04] us praise god
[50:06] except the treasures aren't eggs the
[50:08] treasures are seeds of the word
[50:09] praise god amen
[50:13] see this is the wisdom book right this
[50:14] is we preached on this a few years ago
[50:16] if thou christ after knowledge and lift
[50:18] up thy voice for understanding why
[50:20] doesn't god just give us
[50:21] just give us what we want right away
[50:24] see god likes to be sought after god
[50:26] likes to
[50:27] uh hear your prayers amen god likes to
[50:30] be in contact with us
[50:33] if you seek her as silver and searches
[50:36] for her as for hid treasures
[50:38] then thou shalt understand the fear of
[50:40] the lord and
[50:41] find the knowledge of god right
[50:45] and so if you're digging for gold or if
[50:46] you're digging for silver
[50:48] how many know that's a really in-depth
[50:50] process i should have pulled that up i
[50:51] didn't pull that up but
[50:53] you could pull it up easily how long is
[50:55] it pretty easy to find gold or silver
[50:57] no it's very difficult so god says this
[51:01] is the character of my bride
[51:02] the bride will dig until she strikes
[51:05] gold amen
[51:06] praise god the bride will dig until she
[51:09] strikes
[51:09] silver redemption right gold deity amen
[51:13] and this will separate the people that
[51:15] just want a
[51:16] a a superficial relationship with god
[51:20] they won't they won't dig very deep will
[51:22] they right they won't dig very deep
[51:24] but the ones that really love god
[51:25] they'll keep digging until they find
[51:28] uh the blessings of god the treasures of
[51:30] god because that's why they're out there
[51:32] they're out there to find
[51:33] treasure amen and god just doesn't put
[51:36] the treasure on the top
[51:37] god puts the treasure deep underneath
[51:40] and his bride
[51:41] will keep uh digging until she strikes
[51:43] treasure
[51:45] hallelujah then see after you search
[51:48] after you dig then you find the fear of
[51:51] the lord
[51:52] and the knowledge of god see so god
[51:56] hides himself
[51:57] because he loves to be sought and he
[51:59] loves to feel your love as well
[52:03] remember that's church that's what he
[52:04] died for that's what he died for
[52:08] he didn't die to make us robots he died
[52:10] for our free
[52:11] free moral agency love can i say it like
[52:14] that does that make sense
[52:15] that free choice where someone freely
[52:18] chooses to love him
[52:19] because of truth because of his spirit
[52:22] because of his character
[52:24] you freely choose it that's why he died
[52:26] on the cross
[52:27] to win your love the bible said for the
[52:29] joy that was set before him
[52:30] he endured the cross the joy of what the
[52:32] joy of your worship the joy of your love
[52:36] oh god that's beautiful praise god thank
[52:38] you jesus
[52:39] he loves to hear our prayers remember he
[52:41] said you have not because you don't ask
[52:45] he loves to feel the need there
[52:48] see god loves romantic success suspense
[52:51] and fulfillment
[52:52] so we place it in our lives both
[52:54] naturally and spiritually we're sought
[52:57] after praise god
[52:58] god seeks after us until we give in
[53:02] amen perhaps this is why everybody likes
[53:04] fairy tales right
[53:07] and heroic stories of strong men that
[53:10] save people save their wives
[53:14] save the the beautiful princesses right
[53:17] because it reminds us that god is heroic
[53:21] he's defeated all of our enemies to save
[53:23] us amen
[53:24] all of our sins all those demons jesus
[53:27] has cursed them jesus has overcome them
[53:29] he's delivered us from the power of
[53:31] darkness and brought us into the kingdom
[53:33] of light
[53:35] glory and he's made us a spotless
[53:38] glorious
[53:39] beloved wife
[53:44] all right now
[53:48] so that's kind of this idea here how we
[53:50] get the bride why is the bride so
[53:52] important
[53:53] uh because it's a special group of
[53:55] people that brought by their free more
[53:57] agency they want to please
[53:58] jesus their husband in everything
[54:02] praise god now here's how we'll identify
[54:07] the true bride group today of course we
[54:09] believe we're part of it
[54:10] but we can prove other groups are not
[54:12] part of it we'll eventually get to those
[54:14] we'll name each of these groups and show
[54:16] how they're not part of the bride
[54:18] because of obvious scriptures of paul
[54:20] that they turn down
[54:22] right because paul said if you change
[54:24] one thing you're blessed
[54:25] no you change one thing you're cursed
[54:29] so see some of them a lot of churches
[54:31] have short-term curses remember we
[54:33] talked about that
[54:33] permanent curses or short-term curses
[54:35] right
[54:37] we preach on that and so disobedience
[54:40] brings a short-term curse at least
[54:42] a punishment a chastisement
[54:46] but if totally rejected then it brings a
[54:48] eternal separation from god
[54:53] so we're going to see the attributes of
[54:54] the true church
[54:58] and she is identified by complete
[55:00] submission
[55:02] to the bible blueprint given to paul
[55:05] by christ amen
[55:08] now church here's what we can do the
[55:10] bible said we don't
[55:12] judge people's destinies we judge their
[55:15] fruits of their current lives
[55:17] right we're allowed to judge their
[55:19] current works
[55:21] we're not judging their destinies right
[55:22] we can say generally you know the
[55:24] the mother harlot church and the
[55:26] daughter churches
[55:27] they'll be lost but we don't know which
[55:29] persons will be in it
[55:32] but we are told to judge fruit
[55:36] praise god when you go to the grocery
[55:38] store you pick out some apples and
[55:39] oranges you just take any bag
[55:41] sometimes i felt like i've done that but
[55:43] i haven't meant to do that
[55:45] i want to choose the bag that's got good
[55:47] fruit in it praise god
[55:51] and that's what jesus says by their
[55:53] fruits you shall know them so all these
[55:55] groups saying their bride
[55:56] all these groups saying they're jesus's
[55:58] true people we are to judge their fruits
[56:01] because a tree is known by its fruit
[56:05] and we don't have to wonder if we're the
[56:07] true bride
[56:08] we just got to put jesus's eye salve on
[56:11] right and the bible says
[56:12] we can prove all things and hold fast
[56:15] that which is good
[56:17] if you have jesus spirit inside of you
[56:19] you'll discern the true spirit
[56:21] from the false because the bible said
[56:22] try the spirits whether they are of god
[56:26] amen and the holy spirit will guide us
[56:28] into all truth
[56:30] now on sunday we looked at the god
[56:33] search for a bride in israel but we
[56:34] didn't finish it
[56:35] so i want to finish it so let's go uh
[56:40] let's go to hosea 3 verses 3 4 and 5.
[56:44] hosea 3
[56:45] verses 3 4 and 5.
[56:49] now we brought it up to the spot in
[56:51] jeremiah
[56:53] where god called israel a backsliding
[56:56] woman
[56:57] he said i'm married to you but you've
[56:59] dealt treacherously with me
[57:01] but i'll heal your backslidings amen
[57:05] now hosea 3 verses 3 4 and 5.
[57:10] hosea i preached on this years ago was
[57:11] one of the first services where brother
[57:13] amen
[57:14] was there and we had a wonderful time i
[57:16] remember uh
[57:17] naomi and beatrice were there as well i
[57:18] remember that by god's grace
[57:20] over at that other tiny church there uh
[57:24] hoseo was used by god to
[57:27] show israel that he was a faithful
[57:29] husband and israel was an adulterous
[57:31] wife
[57:33] god told the prophet not to marry the
[57:36] virgin daughter of the of the
[57:37] other prophet right but to marry a
[57:42] gomer to show israel
[57:45] was unfaithful
[57:48] they have a few children but in hosea 3
[57:51] verses 3
[57:51] 4 and 5 hosea said unto her thou shalt
[57:55] abide for me many days thou shalt not
[57:57] play the harlot
[57:58] and thou shalt not be for another man so
[58:00] will i
[58:01] be for thee for the children of israel
[58:03] shall abide many days without a king and
[58:05] without a prince and without a sacrifice
[58:07] and without an image and without a ephod
[58:09] and without taraphim verse 5
[58:12] afterwards shall the children of israel
[58:13] return and seek the lord their god
[58:15] and david their king amen and shall fear
[58:18] the lord
[58:19] and his goodness in the latter days
[58:21] praise god
[58:22] so this is of course speaking
[58:23] prophetically right
[58:26] hosea said he was confident gomer was
[58:29] now going to be faithful because he had
[58:30] to buy her back out of slavery
[58:32] right and he's confident i know she's
[58:35] going to be faithful now
[58:37] because her backsliding is what caused
[58:40] her to be
[58:40] shown to slavery but god uses this to
[58:44] tell israel
[58:45] that i'm not done with you i'm going to
[58:47] bring you back in the latter days praise
[58:49] god
[58:49] amen this is the 144 thousand
[58:53] who accept jesus christ during the
[58:54] tribulation period
[58:57] and this fulfills isaiah 54 verse 5. so
[59:00] okay shall pull that up there
[59:02] isaiah 54 verse 5.
[59:08] remember he said you're going to be
[59:09] faithful and i'm going to be faithful to
[59:11] you
[59:11] what is he speaking of he's speaking of
[59:13] israel in the millennium
[59:14] isaiah 54 verse 5. this is a beautiful
[59:17] scripture for thy maker
[59:19] is thine husband praise god and that
[59:22] just doesn't apply to israel right that
[59:24] applies to all of us as well
[59:26] who made you the lord jesus right he's
[59:29] your husband
[59:30] the lord of hosts is his name and thy
[59:32] redeemer the holy one of israel the god
[59:34] of the whole earth shall he be called
[59:38] so god is our husband our creator
[59:41] is our husband it's comforting to know
[59:43] the very one who made these hands the
[59:45] very one
[59:46] who made these eyes and the very one who
[59:48] gave me this
[59:49] head of hair the very one who gave me
[59:51] that is the one who wants to be married
[59:52] to me praise god
[59:54] is the one who wants to take care of me
[59:56] as the one who wants to love me praise
[59:58] god
[59:59] what a comfort you know why because if
[1:00:01] he did this one this good where
[1:00:03] everything works you know everything and
[1:00:04] everything seems to be working okay
[1:00:07] if he did it this well and it makes it
[1:00:09] work what about eternity if this life
[1:00:12] if this world is is this good what about
[1:00:14] each eternal life praise god it'll be
[1:00:16] even better by god's grace
[1:00:18] now say in isaiah isaiah 62 verses 4 and
[1:00:22] 5.
[1:00:26] so not only is your maker your husband
[1:00:28] but the land you're going to is called
[1:00:31] married land buila land can i say it
[1:00:35] like that
[1:00:40] so remember church this america is not
[1:00:42] beulah land
[1:00:43] unless you want to be married to the
[1:00:45] world unless you're going to be married
[1:00:47] to the god of this world
[1:00:49] no no israel once this earth is purged
[1:00:52] over with fire
[1:00:53] israel is married land praise god
[1:00:57] that's what the scripture says thou
[1:00:59] shalt no more be term forsaken neither
[1:01:01] shall thy land any more be termed
[1:01:03] desolate
[1:01:03] but thou shalt be called hez or hef
[1:01:07] ziba and thy land beulah for the lord
[1:01:10] delighteth in thee
[1:01:12] and thy land shall be married now if he
[1:01:13] delights in israel
[1:01:15] then you know he delights in the bride
[1:01:18] for as a young man marrieth a virgin so
[1:01:20] shall thy sons marry thee
[1:01:22] and as the bridegroom rejoices over the
[1:01:24] bride so shall
[1:01:25] god rejoice over thee how does jesus
[1:01:27] feel about you tonight he rejoices over
[1:01:30] your love
[1:01:31] praise god don't be discouraged church
[1:01:33] if he rejoices over the jews
[1:01:35] who's still under pursue blinded under
[1:01:37] the blood of bulls and goats
[1:01:38] which can't even have blood right they
[1:01:40] can't even have blood on this earth
[1:01:41] then he's surely rejoicing over us who
[1:01:43] are rejoicing in his blood in his
[1:01:45] sacrifice
[1:01:46] and letting him wash us with the water
[1:01:48] of his word
[1:01:52] yes god is going to have a bride a
[1:01:55] beautiful
[1:01:56] jew and gentile bride and they're going
[1:01:59] to have a thousand year honeymoon
[1:02:03] remember jesus was god incarnate in in
[1:02:06] the search for a faithful mate
[1:02:08] he was sent to israel first but they
[1:02:11] demanded his blood to be shed
[1:02:12] and they wanted him killed so
[1:02:15] acts 15 14. can you pull that up there
[1:02:18] so god
[1:02:19] paul says fine i go to the gentiles
[1:02:23] israel rejected jesus and they rejected
[1:02:26] his name
[1:02:27] so god went to the gentiles to find a
[1:02:29] bride called by his name
[1:02:30] james declared this semen hath declared
[1:02:34] how god is the first to visit the
[1:02:36] gentiles to take out of them a people
[1:02:38] for his name we got anyone named mrs
[1:02:40] jesus christ tonight
[1:02:42] praise god he want a people for his name
[1:02:46] mrs lord jesus christ
[1:02:50] and the righteous still run into that
[1:02:52] name and they're still saved tonight
[1:02:57] now spiritually you have your name but
[1:03:00] you're going to be given a new name
[1:03:02] after the wedding which is the rapture
[1:03:06] and the reception the marriage supper
[1:03:07] and then the millennium the honeymoon
[1:03:10] and then in the new jerusalem you get a
[1:03:12] new name once you move into that new
[1:03:13] house
[1:03:15] so that's revelation 3 12. can you go
[1:03:17] there okay i'm sorry lydia
[1:03:27] so we have the spiritual name of the
[1:03:29] lord jesus him that overcometh will i
[1:03:31] make a pillar in the temple of my god
[1:03:32] and i'm going to go down well i'll read
[1:03:34] this
[1:03:34] and he shall go no more out see that's
[1:03:36] the that's the bride there she don't
[1:03:37] have to go out
[1:03:38] anymore okay now here we go uh which is
[1:03:41] new jerusalem the name of my city which
[1:03:43] cometh down
[1:03:44] out of heaven from my god and i'll write
[1:03:47] upon him
[1:03:48] my new name amen speaking of marriage
[1:03:50] right we're speaking of marriage
[1:03:52] the bride getting a new name in the new
[1:03:56] jerusalem
[1:03:59] and this will be a bride that doesn't
[1:04:01] fall right like eve fell israel fail
[1:04:04] or fail rather brother brahma even says
[1:04:06] the church the bride fell the gentile
[1:04:08] bride fell
[1:04:08] down through the church ages right they
[1:04:10] turned down some truth
[1:04:12] and there was very very few at times who
[1:04:15] were born again but god never left
[1:04:16] himself without a witness
[1:04:20] now tonight let's move on to this next
[1:04:22] section i'm looking at the apostolic
[1:04:24] blueprint for becoming a
[1:04:26] bride member now paul says
[1:04:29] in second corinthians 11 2 i am jealous
[1:04:31] over you with godly jealousy
[1:04:33] for i've espoused you to one husband
[1:04:35] then i may present you as a chaste
[1:04:37] virgin to christ
[1:04:41] now let's look and see how paul espoused
[1:04:44] the church so let's go to acts 18
[1:04:46] 1. let's see how paul espoused the
[1:04:49] church
[1:04:52] and if paul said that he he he uh what
[1:04:55] he engaged
[1:04:56] uh christ to the people let's see how he
[1:04:59] did it
[1:04:59] acts 18 1.
[1:05:04] after these things paul departed from
[1:05:06] athens and came to corinth and found a
[1:05:08] certain jew named aquila born in pontus
[1:05:11] lately come from italy with his wife
[1:05:12] priscilla
[1:05:14] because that claudius had commanded all
[1:05:17] jews to depart from rome and came unto
[1:05:18] them
[1:05:19] and because he was the same craft he
[1:05:21] bowed with them and wrought
[1:05:22] for they for by their occupation they
[1:05:25] were tempt makers
[1:05:28] and he reasoned the synagogue every
[1:05:30] sabbath and persuaded the jews and the
[1:05:34] greeks
[1:05:36] where did paul go fishing he went
[1:05:37] fishing in churches right
[1:05:40] where'd he go fishing for souls remember
[1:05:41] the bible said he that wins souls is
[1:05:43] wise oh my that's interesting
[1:05:47] he that wins souls is wise where did
[1:05:48] paul go to win souls
[1:05:51] the group that had the most recent
[1:05:52] revelation that hadn't heard their true
[1:05:54] revelation
[1:05:58] verse 5 and when silas and timotheus
[1:06:00] were come from macedonia paul was
[1:06:02] pressed in the spirit and testified to
[1:06:04] the jews
[1:06:05] that jesus was christ now look at that
[1:06:07] see god put such a press
[1:06:09] on his heart a church that's what we've
[1:06:10] got to be looking for when god put
[1:06:12] something on our heart we got to move
[1:06:14] upon it right
[1:06:15] we talked about that with the new riot
[1:06:17] the new wine right with elihu
[1:06:20] see god pressed that upon him that that
[1:06:22] that that wine was bubbling up right and
[1:06:24] he just had to say it praise god
[1:06:27] praise god and there was results when he
[1:06:30] said it
[1:06:30] god gave him results
[1:06:34] verse 6 and when they had opposed
[1:06:36] themselves and blasphemed
[1:06:39] he shook his raiments unto them your
[1:06:40] blood be upon your own heads i am clean
[1:06:42] from henceforth i will go into the
[1:06:44] gentiles and he borrowed a dents and
[1:06:46] entered into a certain man's house named
[1:06:48] justice
[1:06:48] one that worshipped god whose house
[1:06:50] joined hard to the synagogue
[1:06:52] and christmas the chief ruler of the
[1:06:54] synagogue believed on the lord with all
[1:06:55] of his house
[1:06:57] and many of the corinthians hearing
[1:06:59] believed
[1:07:00] and were baptized
[1:07:03] so can you imagine that a whole family
[1:07:05] comes in the message right
[1:07:07] paul goes there he preaches there in the
[1:07:09] jewish synagogue
[1:07:10] but one family receives it the whole
[1:07:13] house receives it perhaps there were
[1:07:15] servants in there right
[1:07:18] imagine that a whole heart a whole house
[1:07:20] automatically one night flips for christ
[1:07:26] amen
[1:07:28] and then he baptized every one of them
[1:07:30] in that house praise god
[1:07:32] oh what a what a time of rejoicing for
[1:07:34] that family they all passed from death
[1:07:36] unto life in one night praise god they
[1:07:39] all got baptized
[1:07:41] he that wins souls is wise
[1:07:45] verse 9 then spake the lord to paul in
[1:07:47] the night by vision be not afraid but
[1:07:49] speak and hold not thy peace
[1:07:51] for i am with thee and no man shall set
[1:07:54] on thee to hurt thee for i much people
[1:07:56] in this city
[1:07:57] and he continued there a year and six
[1:07:59] months teaching the word of god
[1:08:01] among them okay so
[1:08:04] paul said i espoused you i engaged you
[1:08:08] to jesus christ
[1:08:10] how did he do it he preached about
[1:08:12] christ and he baptized them praise god
[1:08:15] so the people that preached to you and
[1:08:17] you believed and got baptized those are
[1:08:19] the people that
[1:08:20] engage you to jesus praise god
[1:08:24] that's why i think so much of brother
[1:08:25] brooks right and brother craig and the
[1:08:27] ones that now craig
[1:08:28] spent a lot of time teaching me
[1:08:29] individually like verse 11
[1:08:31] says a year and six months so we thank
[1:08:35] god for those that we heard the message
[1:08:36] from
[1:08:37] simon shared the message with me and i
[1:08:39] got baptized
[1:08:42] so i was espoused to christ through the
[1:08:45] preaching of brother brooks and
[1:08:47] simon's witnessing and brother craig
[1:08:52] and paul said this is how believers
[1:08:55] become
[1:08:56] bride members they hear the word
[1:08:59] they believe they get baptized and they
[1:09:03] sit there and get taught for a long time
[1:09:06] because paul was there
[1:09:07] a year and six months so paul's just
[1:09:09] like eliezer right
[1:09:11] eliezer went to rebecca told rebecca the
[1:09:14] marriage term she said yes
[1:09:17] and she had to travel all that distance
[1:09:19] to get to isaac right
[1:09:21] same thing here with paul paul's like
[1:09:23] eliezer he preaches to rebecca the
[1:09:26] church at corinth they get saved
[1:09:27] and they got to go on a long journey
[1:09:29] till they see jesus amen
[1:09:31] praise god aren't you glad church you're
[1:09:34] on the journey to see jesus amen
[1:09:36] oh and i'm watering the camel tonight
[1:09:38] praise god amen
[1:09:40] i'm watering with my praise i praise you
[1:09:42] jesus i thank you jesus amen
[1:09:44] i'm warning the camel it's going to take
[1:09:45] me to my isaac
[1:09:51] now church remember it's important to
[1:09:52] say we're not physically married to
[1:09:54] christ right now because we're not with
[1:09:56] him
[1:09:57] and his physical body but the bible says
[1:10:00] we're engaged
[1:10:02] the bible says we should be married in
[1:10:04] romans 7 verse 4
[1:10:06] that you should be married to another
[1:10:08] even to him who's raised from the dead
[1:10:10] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[1:10:12] god
[1:10:14] so see we're spiritually married to
[1:10:16] jesus by the vow
[1:10:17] in our hearts but not physically that's
[1:10:20] where all those churches get off in the
[1:10:21] message they say oh see the cloud came
[1:10:23] down in 1963.
[1:10:25] so jesus is here the rapture already
[1:10:27] took place what a bunch of nonsense
[1:10:30] and then they live like devils right
[1:10:32] yeah they say they're married to christ
[1:10:33] right
[1:10:34] they say they're married to jesus now
[1:10:35] that jesus is on earth they don't need a
[1:10:37] fast anymore i've talked to brothers in
[1:10:39] arkansas all that believe that
[1:10:40] and they live like the world you're
[1:10:42] telling me you live like the world when
[1:10:44] your husband's with you
[1:10:45] you cheat with cheat on your husband and
[1:10:47] flirt with the world while your
[1:10:48] husband's right here
[1:10:49] no sir no sir hallelujah
[1:10:52] right we're engaged to christ and this
[1:10:55] is the proving time
[1:10:56] are we going to keep the word of our vow
[1:10:58] or not amen
[1:11:00] hallelujah that's what we're doing
[1:11:01] tonight we're making sure we're keeping
[1:11:03] the vile that we made to jesus amen
[1:11:06] so when he comes back we'll be ready to
[1:11:08] meet him praise god
[1:11:10] we'll have the engagement ring on we'll
[1:11:12] have our dress on we'll be waiting there
[1:11:14] all ready to go praise god
[1:11:17] hallelujah
[1:11:20] thank you jesus yeah the bible said
[1:11:23] when we see him face to face we're
[1:11:25] changed into the wife at that moment
[1:11:30] first corinthians 13 12
[1:11:34] then shall i know even as i'm sorry now
[1:11:37] we see
[1:11:37] through a glass darkly but then face to
[1:11:39] face now i know in part but then shall i
[1:11:42] know even
[1:11:43] also as i am known see we don't know
[1:11:46] jesus as well as we're going to know him
[1:11:49] once we get face to face
[1:11:51] then we're really going to know him
[1:11:52] better praise god we know
[1:11:54] now but it's dark it's it's dark it's
[1:11:56] it's a glass
[1:11:57] darkly it's a little bit cloudy we don't
[1:12:00] quite understand all things
[1:12:01] but when we see jesus we'll be changed
[1:12:04] and we'll know him
[1:12:05] as he knows us amen as husband and wife
[1:12:08] praise god
[1:12:10] thank the lord
[1:12:14] philippians 3 20-21 says he shall
[1:12:17] change our vile body you think jesus is
[1:12:20] going to marry a vile body
[1:12:22] no he's got to change it would you marry
[1:12:24] a vile body
[1:12:25] no you wouldn't change a dead vile body
[1:12:27] right
[1:12:28] you wouldn't marry a dead vile body he
[1:12:31] said we're going to change our vile body
[1:12:33] that we may be fashioned like unto his
[1:12:35] glorious body
[1:12:36] praise god that's the f that's the body
[1:12:39] change that's the marriage ceremony
[1:12:41] when you get the body changed totally
[1:12:43] pure he takes a bride who's pure
[1:12:45] not vile but she's holy she's just like
[1:12:48] he is praise god
[1:12:50] first john 3 2 says but when he shall
[1:12:53] appear
[1:12:54] we shall be like him for we shall see
[1:12:56] him
[1:12:57] as he is praise god amen
[1:13:00] so don't let anybody tell you that
[1:13:02] you're physically married to jesus
[1:13:03] already it's not true
[1:13:04] we're married but we're spout we're
[1:13:06] engaged in him by the vow
[1:13:07] we're spiritually married in our hearts
[1:13:09] right by the vow but we're not
[1:13:11] physically married yet
[1:13:13] that happens when we get the new body
[1:13:15] praise god
[1:13:16] now you know on the day of pentecost
[1:13:18] church 3 000 souls
[1:13:19] were espoused to christ so what they do
[1:13:23] they faithfully assembled they were
[1:13:25] hungry for true teaching
[1:13:26] and they were enthusiastic to help one
[1:13:28] another with their physical needs
[1:13:32] so see we have a right to question
[1:13:34] people if they're not concerned about
[1:13:35] other christians needs
[1:13:36] if they don't want to gather more with
[1:13:38] christians if they don't get excited
[1:13:39] about the word of god
[1:13:41] and teaching and praising god if they
[1:13:43] don't get excited about that we have a
[1:13:44] question to believe if they really got
[1:13:46] that
[1:13:46] that ring of engagement praise god
[1:13:49] right because the very first group that
[1:13:51] was ever engaged in jesus
[1:13:53] the bible said they continued
[1:13:54] steadfastly in the doctrine and
[1:13:56] fellowship
[1:13:57] breaking bread prayers and they had all
[1:14:00] things in common
[1:14:03] and i meant that on sunday when i said
[1:14:04] that on sunday let me know if anybody
[1:14:06] needs anything i mean that
[1:14:08] let me know if you need anything last
[1:14:11] year we had somebody
[1:14:12] take me up on that a couple times they
[1:14:13] needed some help so we helped him out by
[1:14:14] god's grace and i appreciate that that's
[1:14:16] why we're here
[1:14:17] and i love it god has provided for us
[1:14:19] again and again and again praise god we
[1:14:20] never ran out
[1:14:22] thank the lord they continued in one
[1:14:24] accord
[1:14:25] in the temple in the church see they
[1:14:28] went from house to house
[1:14:30] they were glad singleness of heart they
[1:14:32] praised god
[1:14:33] and the lord added as should be saved
[1:14:36] so anybody that wanted to be saved the
[1:14:38] lord would add them but they had no want
[1:14:40] to be saved
[1:14:42] right he's not going to force people
[1:14:43] into our church and we don't want people
[1:14:45] forced into our church
[1:14:46] we want people that want to be saved
[1:14:49] now every bride member church becomes a
[1:14:52] new creature in christ acts 26
[1:14:54] 18 to open their eyes and to turn them
[1:14:56] from the darkness to light
[1:14:58] and from the power of satan unto god
[1:15:01] that they may receive forgiveness of
[1:15:03] sins and inheritance
[1:15:05] among them which are sanctified by faith
[1:15:08] that is in me so see when you when
[1:15:11] someone really becomes a spouse to
[1:15:13] christ
[1:15:14] their eyes are open they turn from the
[1:15:17] darkness see they're not they're not in
[1:15:18] love with the world anymore
[1:15:20] they turn from darkness to light they're
[1:15:22] not under the power of satan anymore
[1:15:24] they're under the power of god
[1:15:26] they're the power of holiness they're
[1:15:28] under the power of forgiveness praise
[1:15:30] god amen
[1:15:31] none of the power of victory and
[1:15:33] deliverance amen
[1:15:34] that's the power they live under praise
[1:15:36] god
[1:15:38] paul compared his previous life to being
[1:15:40] engaged with christ to dung
[1:15:43] right now what a smell dung is right
[1:15:45] imagine the smell right
[1:15:47] but then remember paul says my previous
[1:15:48] life was like dung
[1:15:50] he said but my not my life now is a
[1:15:52] sweet savor unto the lord
[1:15:54] amen praise god what a difference
[1:15:57] done and then fine spices and incense
[1:16:02] oh my there's 40 minutes already mercy
[1:16:03] goodness stop it already this this
[1:16:06] watch must be broken oh it's almost 8
[1:16:09] o'clock my goodness
[1:16:11] ah okay well we'll have to close here
[1:16:14] let me see how much i got in this next
[1:16:15] section here okay i'll finish this
[1:16:17] section
[1:16:18] it's not too long now go to first
[1:16:21] timothy 1
[1:16:22] 13 first timothy 1 16. i'm sorry 113.
[1:16:28] now we're talking about how do you
[1:16:30] become a bride member
[1:16:31] you follow the pattern that god gave or
[1:16:35] christ gave to paul
[1:16:36] you believe the preaching you get
[1:16:38] baptized you stay in teaching
[1:16:40] you can be taught you love the word of
[1:16:42] god you love to praise god you love to
[1:16:43] worship praise god
[1:16:45] you love to take communion with the
[1:16:46] saints
[1:16:48] and you become espoused or engaged to
[1:16:52] jesus christ
[1:16:53] now paul says who was before a
[1:16:55] blasphemer so paul was a bride member
[1:16:57] but he used to blaspheme
[1:16:58] the bridegroom and the persecutor and
[1:17:01] injurious
[1:17:02] but i obtain mercy because i did it
[1:17:04] ignorantly in unbelief
[1:17:05] and the grace of our lord was exceeding
[1:17:07] abundant with faith and love which is in
[1:17:09] christ jesus
[1:17:10] this is a faithful sin and worthy of all
[1:17:13] exception
[1:17:14] that christ jesus came into the world to
[1:17:16] save sinners
[1:17:17] of whom i am chief
[1:17:20] how be it for this cause i obtain mercy
[1:17:23] that in me
[1:17:24] first jesus christ might show forth all
[1:17:27] longsuffering
[1:17:29] for a pattern to them which adhere after
[1:17:31] believe on me
[1:17:34] and life everlasting right to life
[1:17:36] everlasting
[1:17:38] did did you catch that church look at
[1:17:40] what paul said
[1:17:41] paul said i'm the chief of sinners
[1:17:45] he said i'm the least of the possible at
[1:17:47] least of the apostles
[1:17:49] and on the least of the saints praise
[1:17:50] god
[1:17:53] think about that least unto the saints
[1:17:57] right chief of sinners
[1:18:01] lisa the apostles so he considered
[1:18:04] himself the lowest
[1:18:05] of the low but because and this because
[1:18:08] of this
[1:18:09] because he considered himself so low god
[1:18:11] could exalt him so high
[1:18:13] praise god amen so let us never get
[1:18:16] exalted that's why we can't get the
[1:18:17] bride pride
[1:18:18] doctrine going on right or the lazy
[1:18:21] layer to seeing
[1:18:22] we can't just relax and do nothing paul
[1:18:24] didn't relax and do nothing
[1:18:26] paul got busy working for the lord
[1:18:27] because he realized i'm nothing
[1:18:29] i failed i've done so many sins i'm so
[1:18:31] awful i want god's grace to work
[1:18:33] mightily in me praise god
[1:18:36] and he said i'm a pattern to them which
[1:18:39] should believe
[1:18:40] hereafter to life everlasting so the
[1:18:42] pattern is
[1:18:43] think lit think low of yourself and that
[1:18:45] will cause you out of your love for
[1:18:47] being saved
[1:18:48] that will cause you to labor more for
[1:18:50] christ and other people
[1:18:56] now i'm going to write that down here
[1:18:57] because i forgot about that one he said
[1:18:58] he's the chief
[1:18:59] of sinners
[1:19:03] i i had this thought years ago i
[1:19:05] preached it i remember preaching at cams
[1:19:07] and
[1:19:07] they really liked it i just forgot about
[1:19:09] it and i
[1:19:10] just it just came back to me all tonight
[1:19:12] all three of those all four of those
[1:19:13] scriptures come back to me tonight
[1:19:15] praise god so what's your pattern your
[1:19:18] patterns like paul you were
[1:19:20] a blasphemer injurious persecutor
[1:19:23] you didn't love god chief of sinners but
[1:19:26] god had mercy on you
[1:19:28] amen and god gave you abundant faith
[1:19:32] and god gave you abundant love
[1:19:36] praise god that's his pattern that he
[1:19:38] uses to save
[1:19:39] all or to engage all of his bride
[1:19:41] members unto him
[1:19:45] praise god all right that's the pattern
[1:19:48] for all future bride members
[1:19:50] now next
[1:19:55] paul did the same thing paul did the
[1:19:57] same pattern in every bride church he
[1:19:59] went to
[1:20:01] first he'd win new converts and then he
[1:20:03] would spend significant time teaching
[1:20:05] them god's word
[1:20:06] and then he would before he left he
[1:20:08] would ordain faithful men
[1:20:10] as elders and leaders to oversee the
[1:20:13] converts
[1:20:16] okay and this is clearly seen in acts 14
[1:20:18] 21. so okay
[1:20:19] can you pull it up there acts 14 21.
[1:20:33] and when they had preached the gospel to
[1:20:34] that city and had taught many they
[1:20:36] returned again to lystra and iconium
[1:20:39] and antioch confirming the souls of the
[1:20:40] disciples and exhorting them to continue
[1:20:43] in the faith
[1:20:43] that we must through much tribulation
[1:20:45] enter into the kingdom of god
[1:20:47] and when they obtained them elders in
[1:20:48] every church and had prayed with fasting
[1:20:51] they commended them to the lord
[1:20:52] on whom they believed
[1:20:56] wow look at that before they determine
[1:20:59] who who
[1:21:00] are going to be the shepherds to feed
[1:21:01] these bride members
[1:21:03] they prayed and fasted right who's going
[1:21:06] to take care of jesus's bride
[1:21:08] we better pray and fast about that to
[1:21:09] make sure we got the right choice
[1:21:11] and i just heard if it's okay i hope
[1:21:13] johnny's okay with it johnny fasted
[1:21:14] about three or four days before he
[1:21:16] uh proposed to his wife i thought what a
[1:21:18] testimony
[1:21:20] what a good example i thought here look
[1:21:22] same thing here
[1:21:23] fasting before they leave jesus's bride
[1:21:26] behind right
[1:21:27] they're fasting god give us a faithful
[1:21:29] eleazar amen
[1:21:30] give us a faithful shepherd to feed
[1:21:33] jesus's bride amen
[1:21:35] they won't harm they won't hurt jesus's
[1:21:37] bride
[1:21:39] they pray and fast to make sure that
[1:21:41] jesus bride can be fed
[1:21:44] what an example
[1:21:49] so we can see this is how the saints
[1:21:52] always acted right
[1:21:53] they always acted this way get soul
[1:21:55] saved teach them the word of god
[1:21:57] before they leave praying fast get them
[1:21:59] faithful brothers to preach them god's
[1:22:01] word
[1:22:01] amen all right let's close here
[1:22:06] now you know this is true paul only had
[1:22:07] one pattern because he told titus
[1:22:10] and timothy the same requirements for
[1:22:12] pastors
[1:22:13] and deacons in titus 1 and 1st timothy
[1:22:16] chapter 3 there's this they're almost
[1:22:17] like parallel passages
[1:22:19] he tells titus the same thing this is
[1:22:21] what a pastor must be
[1:22:23] this is what a deacon must be and it's
[1:22:25] repeated
[1:22:26] to both timothy and titus
[1:22:30] god told or sorry paul told titus he
[1:22:33] said for this cause i left the increte
[1:22:35] that you should set order the things
[1:22:36] that are wanting and ordain elders in
[1:22:38] every city
[1:22:39] as i had appointed thee praise god
[1:22:42] hold up second timothy 2 on verse 1. ii
[1:22:45] timothy 2 1.
[1:22:52] ii timothy 2 1-2
[1:23:00] now there i'm sorry thou therefore my
[1:23:03] son be strong in the grace
[1:23:05] that is in christ jesus remember because
[1:23:07] grace is going to enable you remember
[1:23:08] you saw that on sunday
[1:23:09] grace is going to help you be a better
[1:23:11] giver grace is going to help you
[1:23:13] be have more faith right so he says be
[1:23:16] strong in the grace
[1:23:18] that the things that thou has heard of
[1:23:19] me among many witnesses
[1:23:21] the same commit thou to faithful men who
[1:23:24] shall be able to teach
[1:23:26] others also praise god so you see the
[1:23:29] same pattern
[1:23:32] jesus sends an eleazar to preach to the
[1:23:34] people
[1:23:36] souls get converted then he stays there
[1:23:38] teaches them for a little while
[1:23:39] before the eliezer leaves he sets more
[1:23:42] shepherds there
[1:23:43] to feed their souls and this is how the
[1:23:45] bride
[1:23:47] gets called this is how she gets uh
[1:23:50] espoused to jesus christ
[1:23:52] let's stand to our feet praise god
[1:23:55] very simple
[1:23:59] but oh so life-changing my
[1:24:05] so life-changing
[1:24:08] think about that how come when i went to
[1:24:10] now when i first got saved
[1:24:11] i went to good churches you can stop the
[1:24:14] livestream
[1:24:15] god bless the livestreamers here you
[1:24:17] know my first one say
[1:24:18] god say
