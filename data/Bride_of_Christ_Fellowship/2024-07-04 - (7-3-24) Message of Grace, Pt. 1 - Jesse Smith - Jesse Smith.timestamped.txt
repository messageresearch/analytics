[0:00] and we' like to look at the message of
[0:01] Grace uh brother BR preached this in
[0:05] 1961 and I imagine I'll have three or
[0:08] four maybe sermons on this and just as a
[0:11] review you know earlier this year I I
[0:13] felt led uh to preach some of these uh
[0:16] titles of brother am sermons that we
[0:17] sing in this
[0:18] song
[0:21] um just want to thank you Lord for
[0:23] letting me hear your word and so uh with
[0:26] this one I'll be a little I'll just
[0:27] reach over the halfway point uh there
[0:30] was eight songs uh I preached through
[0:33] recognizing your day and his message
[0:34] serpent seed perfect Faith the breach
[0:37] and this is the message of Grace so this
[0:39] is our our fifth out of eight by God's
[0:42] grace so with this one once we get this
[0:44] done we'll be past the halfway mark I
[0:46] really didn't know what I was getting
[0:47] into when I uh started preaching this
[0:50] this series here but as a pastor you
[0:53] always got to have new material by God's
[0:55] grace and so it works out gives me a
[0:57] kind of a direction where to go so
[0:59] you'll probably know where be going you
[1:00] know the message of Grace last verse has
[1:02] the coming of the lord The Rapture
[1:04] mystery right brother man preached on
[1:05] the Rapture in 1965 he preached the the
[1:08] sudden secret going away in
[1:10] 1958 uh listened to that last time I
[1:12] went down there to Junction City and
[1:14] then God in Simplicity that was preached
[1:16] right before the breach in March of 63
[1:18] and the spoken word Original Seed if you
[1:20] haven't listened to that it's over a
[1:21] six-hour sermon brother Brandon preached
[1:24] it was a long long sermon and that
[1:27] sermon is famous for having the portion
[1:29] where brother randam was told by the
[1:30] Holy Spirit pick up your pen and write
[1:32] he had a word for the bride and it was
[1:35] all about the bride and the word how uh
[1:38] she's taking in the word of God and
[1:39] she'll only receive the word of God is
[1:41] that your desire just to receive the
[1:43] word of God hallelujah we don't desire
[1:45] the Creeds of men the ideas of men we
[1:46] know we have to live with them right as
[1:48] far as a pastor or preachers none of us
[1:50] are perfect and you know we're going to
[1:51] have our our thoughts on some minor
[1:53] things but ultimately our faith is
[1:56] resting uh solely in the word of God our
[1:59] absolute praise God so I want to look at
[2:01] this here uh this this tape actually
[2:03] begins with a tongue and
[2:05] interpretation and uh in this tongue
[2:07] interpretation there's words like I will
[2:09] come and rescue you be warned of the
[2:11] Wrath to come thus saith my spirit uh so
[2:16] it seems like this was a message to the
[2:18] the Saints there in the church and it's
[2:20] talked about how God had sent his
[2:21] Prophet there brother brandham to
[2:23] minister to them and uh I'm sure we all
[2:26] can experience that where God has
[2:27] rescued us out of situations especially
[2:29] this year right we've gone through some
[2:31] uh some difficult trials this year and
[2:33] it looks like there'll be maybe some
[2:34] more trials to come of course with a
[2:36] presidential election you never know
[2:37] what's going to happen uh based upon
[2:39] what happened last time we don't know so
[2:41] we're just uh trusting in God and let's
[2:44] stay true to the holy spirit so he can
[2:46] rescue us praise God and right before
[2:48] preaching brother B talks a little bit
[2:50] and he says
[2:51] this he's praying and he says uh God we
[2:55] remember especially those who are
[2:57] unsaved and then he says before the
[2:59] meeting Clos today May there be
[3:01] something happen Lord that would bring
[3:02] your presence so close to the people
[3:05] that they would know that the same Jesus
[3:07] that walked in Galilee stands in the
[3:10] midst of his people
[3:12] today Hallelujah he said they may go
[3:16] away from here today with the same
[3:17] assurance that those who came from amus
[3:21] that time you know brother man many
[3:22] times mentions that scripture out of
[3:24] Luke 24 right Copus and his friend are
[3:27] walking on the road to emus and and how
[3:29] do they get Jesus to come on the scene
[3:31] or how does Jesus come on the scene they
[3:32] start talking about it and that's what
[3:35] we have to do church we have to just
[3:36] talk about the Lord in our homes in our
[3:38] cars and here at church we're talking
[3:40] about God and then we feel God's
[3:42] sweetness come right his Spirit comes
[3:44] Among Us praise God as we talk about him
[3:47] as we sing as we worship as we give him
[3:49] glory Hallelujah so that's the key here
[3:52] and then you know uh Jesus of course hid
[3:54] himself from them and then brother Ram
[3:56] takes that thought about how Jesus hid
[3:58] himself from them and he said
[4:00] oh God so many times we are like that
[4:03] you speak to us in the setting of the
[4:05] Sun in the singing of the birds in the
[4:08] rustling of the leaves in the blooming
[4:10] of the flowers God ever speak to you
[4:13] looking at a
[4:14] flower in the hymns of the
[4:18] church he says and we so little
[4:20] recognize that it's you in the sick
[4:23] rooms in the hospital many other places
[4:26] you speak to us and we so little realize
[4:30] that it's you so I like how brother R
[4:33] he's he's offering just this humble
[4:34] prayer God you know it's just like on
[4:36] the road to mayus you're trying to show
[4:39] yourself to us so many ways in other
[4:40] words Lord just open our eyes that we
[4:42] can see your presence in our lives
[4:44] Hallelujah and he says now Lord as we
[4:47] return to our homes this morning may we
[4:49] like they did recognize may you do
[4:51] something today in our midst just like
[4:53] you did back there I love that brother
[4:55] Ram he uses this scripture Lord help us
[4:58] to recognize your presence
[5:00] make yourself real in a way to us
[5:02] tonight how many Want Jesus to be real
[5:04] tonight Hallelujah all it takes is just
[5:06] meditating on him right focusing on him
[5:09] talking about him thinking about him and
[5:11] He makes himself known to
[5:13] us
[5:15] hallelujah he said uh when they went
[5:17] back in their place they were rejoicing
[5:19] praising God and they said did not our
[5:21] hearts burn with within us as he talked
[5:24] to us along the
[5:25] road and brother bam says Lord you've
[5:28] talked to us all week now appear in our
[5:31] midst and make yourself known to each
[5:33] needy heart we ask it in jesus' name for
[5:37] his sake amen hallelujah and friends you
[5:40] know if we're out with ourselves God has
[5:42] talked to us all week whether it was a
[5:44] prayer a song a conversation we had did
[5:47] you listen to a sermon amen uh God was
[5:50] trying to speak to us all week and it
[5:52] was it's our responsibility to open up
[5:54] our hearts and say Lord are you speaking
[5:55] to me Lord do you want to tell me
[5:57] something are you trying to tell me
[5:58] something Hallelujah
[6:00] and when we do do that God reveals
[6:02] himself to us and right after brother
[6:04] finishes this prayer a sister speaks in
[6:07] tongues set for the second time and a
[6:09] brother interprets
[6:11] it and I want to read the part where it
[6:14] speaks of uh the squeeze and I made a
[6:17] video about this last December uh this
[6:19] is a 1961 sermon so the Holy Spirit
[6:22] spoke to the Bram Tabernacle that if
[6:24] they stayed true to God God would be
[6:26] with them during the
[6:28] squeeze and so we know most of these
[6:30] people have died out right so the Lord
[6:32] would have had to known that people were
[6:34] going to listen to these tapes right cuz
[6:37] God doesn't lie right the the Holy
[6:40] Spirit doesn't tell false things and if
[6:42] brother random accepted this was a
[6:44] interpretation of a genuine tongue then
[6:46] it has to be for somebody praise God
[6:49] hallelujah and uh the the brother then
[6:52] interprets the tongue it says I am
[6:54] rejoicing with you in my spirit and I
[6:56] will lift you this morning by my strong
[6:58] right hand in the place where and then I
[7:01] can't understand the word Walk Beside Me
[7:03] in Heavenly places because my desire
[7:05] this morning is unto you that your
[7:07] hearts might be lifted up that you might
[7:09] Rejoice with me in spirit and gain this
[7:11] Mighty Revelation and the spiritual
[7:13] wisdom and the understanding that you're
[7:15] going to need when the time comes at the
[7:18] persecution that's going to come just
[7:20] before I Rapture my
[7:23] bride he says you will not endure my
[7:25] wrath my children but persecution will
[7:28] come upon on you on many a side now
[7:31] there's other quotes brother says the
[7:32] bride won't be
[7:34] persecuted right so we know the word uh
[7:36] we know the word doesn't contradict
[7:38] himself but words can actually have
[7:39] multiple meanings right so we look at we
[7:42] look at this as uh not a persecution
[7:44] that would be a the wrath of God but it
[7:46] would be stress or pressure because
[7:48] we're seeing the system and we're seeing
[7:50] the the time of the Gentiles coming down
[7:52] to the end right we're seeing the mark
[7:55] of the beast getting closer we're seeing
[7:57] the re revelation of the Antichrist
[7:59] coming and the church said did you
[8:01] remember I mentioned that to you last
[8:02] week how the pope for the first time
[8:04] went to the G7 Summit the first time
[8:06] ever the pope getting involved with the
[8:08] seven Great Nations that run the
[8:10] economies of the world I mean now the
[8:12] pope is getting involved in that right
[8:15] so you can see it it's it's coming
[8:17] together
[8:19] closer and then it goes to show and then
[8:22] he says uh you will not endure my wrath
[8:25] my children you will be tried right
[8:28] because everybody's got to be tried was
[8:29] Paul tried remember I preached about the
[8:31] book of Romans was he tried yes he was
[8:33] tried all the way to the chopping block
[8:35] the martyr's
[8:36] block right uh William Tindale um
[8:40] different Martyrs down through the age
[8:42] they were given chances before their
[8:43] burn of the stake do you want to recant
[8:46] you your life will be spared and each
[8:48] time they refuse to recant because
[8:50] Christ was so real to them amen May
[8:52] Christ be real to us amen that nothing
[8:55] that could happen in this life would
[8:56] ever uh tempt us to ever leave
[9:00] uh the truth that God has revealed to us
[9:02] amen amen and church you know we all go
[9:05] through shakings at time you know God
[9:06] allows us to go through tests and trials
[9:09] and we all go through them and each
[9:11] moment it's got to come back to brother
[9:12] man say it's got to come back to some
[9:14] absolute amen right your faith where's
[9:16] it anchored is it anchored in some
[9:18] experience I mean experience is okay but
[9:20] that experience has to be backed up by
[9:22] the word of God hallelujah and so we
[9:25] know there's coming a great shaking time
[9:26] the Bible speaks of it praise God the of
[9:29] the Gentile Church ages and so we've got
[9:32] to have a faith that understands that
[9:34] we're going to be tried and how many
[9:35] want perfect Faith by God's grace
[9:38] remember perfect Faith wasn't being a
[9:39] prophet perfect faith is just knowing
[9:41] God's will for the situation amen
[9:43] hallelujah because the Bible said are
[9:45] all prophets are all speakers in tongues
[9:47] do all interpret no do all have gifts of
[9:50] healing no so perfect Faith isn't that
[9:52] we all have to know everything by a
[9:55] prophecy or dream perfect faith is
[9:57] having a revelation of the will of God
[9:58] for your life amen amen
[10:02] hallelujah you'll be tried but I will
[10:05] lift you up I'm sorry but I will but I'm
[10:07] sorry you'll be tried but if you lift up
[10:09] your hands and raise your voices on my
[10:12] behalf and testify when the going is
[10:14] hard I will come down and witness to you
[10:16] reminds us of Stephen when times got
[10:18] tough what did he do he looked up to
[10:20] heaven and Jesus uh sheltered him from
[10:23] the the pain of the stones right he fell
[10:25] asleep isn't that a great Bible type
[10:28] there if you draw not to God if you
[10:29] praise God in the storm God will rescue
[10:32] you hallelujah amen
[10:34] amen he says uh the evil device of the
[10:37] wicked one will come but I've spoken to
[10:40] you by my spirit and if you listen to my
[10:42] voice this
[10:43] morning uh you will have no wrath of God
[10:47] thus saith my spirit now some of those
[10:49] words I couldn't work out but the
[10:51] congregation rejoices uh they're
[10:53] glorifying God them brother Ram said now
[10:55] the congregation shall pray and they
[10:57] pray uh they they pray the Lord's Prayer
[11:00] out of Matthew chapter 6 so you know we
[11:03] can't say that there's anything wrong
[11:04] with saying a congregational prayer
[11:06] there's nothing wrong with saying that
[11:07] brother R did it on numerous occasions
[11:10] amen
[11:12] hallelujah and then I just you know
[11:13] here's probably one of the most
[11:15] important parts of this sermon I believe
[11:17] one reason why there was tongues and
[11:21] interpretation and if you haven't
[11:22] listened to this message I'd encourage
[11:23] you to do it if you haven't even
[11:24] listened to other ones I would encourage
[11:25] you to go do that as well make sure
[11:27] listening to some type of message
[11:28] sometime amen listen to something keep
[11:31] uh keep the prophet of God an active
[11:33] part of your life praise God Amen
[11:35] Hallelujah and then brother Bram says
[11:37] these words right after the Lord's
[11:38] Prayer he says that if my pen should be
[11:41] a sculptor's tool and my paper should be
[11:46] flint and these words that I say now
[11:49] should be engraved upon this that it
[11:52] might go to All Peoples what a statement
[11:56] he's basically saying Lord I just wish
[11:58] my words uh could be engraved on a stone
[12:02] and it could be sent to every person
[12:05] right a stone would be a very lasting
[12:06] testimony a stone a stone message would
[12:08] last much longer than a paper message
[12:10] right so what brother ad is going to say
[12:13] next is very
[12:14] important and I think you understand
[12:16] what uh we mean in just a
[12:19] moment from from my best understanding
[12:22] brother random is repeating the words of
[12:24] job out of job 19 job 19:23 says oh that
[12:27] my words were now written oh that they
[12:29] were printed in a book that they were
[12:31] Graven with an iron pen and led in the
[12:34] rock forever sound familiar right for I
[12:37] know that my redeemer liveth amen and
[12:39] that he shall stand at the latter day
[12:41] upon the Earth and though after my skin
[12:43] warms destroy this body yet in my flesh
[12:46] shall I see God whom I shall see for
[12:49] myself and my eyes Shall Behold and not
[12:51] another though my Reigns may be consumed
[12:54] within me am so brother ad I believe is
[12:57] saying something uh important
[12:59] here and he's quoting job now brother R
[13:02] had done this before I'm sorry brother R
[13:04] would do this in the future if you
[13:06] remember question the answer 64 part one
[13:09] they asked brother Ram is it wrong to be
[13:11] part of a Workers Union how many got to
[13:13] be in the union I have to be in Union
[13:14] anyone have to be in a union here okay
[13:16] okay praise God so some of you have
[13:18] union rights amen it's a good thing for
[13:20] the most part there are some
[13:22] disadvantages to the union just a B I
[13:24] guess there's disadvantages without
[13:25] having a
[13:26] union but the union gives you rights and
[13:29] and uh uh uh rules to be protected by as
[13:32] you
[13:33] work and brother R says you know uh it's
[13:36] okay to work in a union if you can't
[13:37] work outside the union and brother says
[13:41] now you remember people remember what
[13:42] brother brandom saying and may My Words
[13:46] Be graved with an iron pen in a mountain
[13:48] of Steel he says thus sayith the Lord
[13:51] that same thing with unions will happen
[13:53] in
[13:54] religion so young people Malachi L you
[13:58] little ones
[14:00] the same thing that's happening on jobs
[14:02] where you have to be in a union to work
[14:03] there he says the same thing will happen
[14:05] in religion now this gives me a lot of
[14:08] comfort right because to join the union
[14:11] I'm sure if you join a union you got to
[14:12] do a lot of paperwork there's a lot of
[14:14] thought that goes into it it's not easy
[14:16] to join Union right you got to go
[14:18] through steps and processes at least in
[14:20] my profession it was and then I was then
[14:23] I got out of it by God's grace because
[14:25] they send all your money to the
[14:26] Democrats I don't want my Democrat I
[14:28] don't want my money going to Democrats
[14:30] or
[14:31] Republicans uh I want to go to God Amen
[14:34] but the point is said thus say the Lord
[14:37] it'll happen in religion you'll belong
[14:39] to a denomination of some sort or you
[14:41] cannot buy or sell right so be real
[14:44] careful brother let it just go to labor
[14:46] alone watch it it's a
[14:48] warning so 1964 there were brothers in
[14:51] Jeffersonville they're wondering should
[14:52] I join this work Union brother said go
[14:55] ahead it's okay but it's going to come
[14:56] down to religion one day
[14:59] and they're going to make you join a
[15:01] unionized
[15:02] religion now Church we're blessed cuz we
[15:04] know what's
[15:06] coming we know better than any
[15:08] Temptation well like uh you know the
[15:10] city of akan or the state of Ohio might
[15:12] send out a alert email to all the
[15:14] pastors you know you have to come to
[15:15] this conference and we like you to join
[15:17] this meeting well you know what I'm
[15:19] going to say no thank you amen right but
[15:24] then we know but there there's going to
[15:25] come pressure if you don't join just
[15:28] like the pressure with with some the
[15:30] pressure with Co and the shots was
[15:32] related to related to
[15:33] jobs right right but with religion it's
[15:36] going to be related to everything
[15:37] especially the
[15:38] churches because where judgment begins
[15:41] where judgment begins at the house of
[15:42] God amen amen hallelujah so you young
[15:46] people thus sayith the Lord remember
[15:48] that same pressure to join a union is
[15:50] going to come to
[15:51] religion and brother R said he quotes
[15:54] Joe okay now let's get back to the
[15:56] original quote that was 64 now I'm
[15:58] taking you back 61 the message of
[16:01] Grace so right after saying this may my
[16:04] words be engraved in stone and sent to
[16:06] All Nations brother BR says and look at
[16:08] this six we're 59 years after brother
[16:10] brandom and all these nations are still
[16:12] getting his
[16:13] tapes there's so many languages uh the
[16:16] voice of God Recordings has not
[16:18] translated the message into so there's
[16:21] many people so that haven't heard the
[16:22] message yeah right so brother Ram had
[16:26] quite a statement there now he goes to
[16:28] this story story now he's going to tell
[16:29] a story about an experience he had 7
[16:32] days ago from this sermon it would have
[16:35] been uh August 25th
[16:38] 1961 last year as all of you
[16:42] know he says there was spoken into
[16:45] existence Three
[16:48] Squirrels he says um and then brother BR
[16:51] said you know he said last week I had a
[16:52] strange feeling to go to that same place
[16:54] again where he was hunting MH and it was
[16:57] before daylight rain I didn't even know
[16:59] whether there' be a hunt or not because
[17:01] of the
[17:02] rain hunting means and he says hunting
[17:04] means to get alone to yourself and pray
[17:08] Hallelujah so see that's what you want
[17:10] you want your uh you want your hobbies
[17:12] to somehow connect you to God praise God
[17:16] like I went through our Hobbies on
[17:17] Sunday a little bit and I'm glad at the
[17:19] beginning of our Hobbies we got to hear
[17:20] a lot of good Jesus talk not so much
[17:22] anymore but we always pray before our
[17:24] Hobbies amen Malachi and I before we go
[17:26] into practice we always pray together in
[17:28] join hands and pray in the car God would
[17:30] protect our bodies and protect our
[17:34] minds brother said I stopped the car and
[17:36] walked across the road and went into the
[17:38] bush it was just before daylight it was
[17:41] kind of gray I had stopped now look so
[17:44] brother before he would hunt he'd stop
[17:46] and he said I offered a little word of
[17:48] prayer as usual telling
[17:50] father that just what I have need of to
[17:53] provide it I don't believe in wasting
[17:56] anything or
[17:57] destroying so so you know it's it's
[17:59] maybe 6:00 a.m. in the morning brother's
[18:01] going out to hunt and what does he
[18:02] always do he always stops to offer a
[18:04] little word of prayer can you see
[18:05] brother r with is hunting his cowboy hat
[18:07] on take off his hat and say father I I
[18:10] pray you just provide what I have need
[18:12] of this morning amen
[18:15] hallelujah and then as I turned so he
[18:17] puts his hat on as I turned I started
[18:19] doing along a little familiar little
[18:20] pathway by the side of the pasture over
[18:23] to an L shape in the woods and something
[18:26] strange took place all my experience is
[18:29] I've never had anything like that I
[18:31] looked at the top of the hill to my left
[18:32] from where I was standing now one of
[18:34] these days if you any of you guys are
[18:35] good at picture AI anybody ever make a
[18:38] picture with AI I've never done it all
[18:40] right I'm going to have to send you this
[18:41] quote and you can make a picture with it
[18:43] we'll put it up there on Sunday well not
[18:44] Sunday next
[18:46] Wednesday I thought Bo this brother I
[18:48] love brother always describes these
[18:49] things so well I like to just input that
[18:52] into the AI and see what it see what it
[18:53] pops out there so brother looks up the
[18:56] hill and he sees at the hill
[19:01] he says came three rainbows and they
[19:03] were running some 30 feet high so
[19:05] picture 30t High three
[19:08] rainbows first I look I seen the light
[19:10] and I just turned back because I thought
[19:12] it might be the sun raising upon the
[19:14] second thought it wasn't towards the sun
[19:16] it was towards the South another thing
[19:18] it was smooth cloudy rain raining all
[19:20] over that was August 25th last Friday
[19:22] morning and you know it was raining and
[19:25] I looked again and there it was growing
[19:27] taller and taller three rain
[19:30] I took off my hat I sat down my gun I
[19:33] love this brother is trying to do a
[19:35] hobby but he gets an experience with God
[19:37] I think that's a good lesson we should
[19:39] be able to experience God while doing
[19:40] our Hobbies
[19:45] Hallelujah he said I starting walking
[19:47] towards it with my hands up so he starts
[19:49] walking towards the hill with his hands
[19:51] up and something just seemed to tell me
[19:54] this is close enough I was going to sit
[19:56] down and take off my boots that I had on
[19:59] to see if I could walk a little closer
[20:00] but within a few yards of it I seen the
[20:02] color of it missing like a fog moving
[20:04] around I Stood Still for a few moments
[20:06] it was coming right out right out of the
[20:08] top of the little mountain and I watch
[20:09] as a
[20:10] three he says one to the right one to
[20:13] the left one in the center running down
[20:14] into one bowl like so all three will
[20:16] kind of come into like a bowl he
[20:19] says I like to see what AI thinks of
[20:21] that Hallelujah everyone it was was
[20:26] alive and it was moving and making its
[20:28] MO and I stood there just as it was
[20:30] graying down I turned and looked again
[20:32] and I screamed out oh God what would you
[20:34] have your servant to know hallelujah
[20:37] amen just then the spirit of the Lord
[20:39] come in and said Jesus of the New
[20:41] Testament is Jehovah of the old yeah he
[20:45] only chased his mask from Spirit to man
[20:49] Amen brother tells about the experience
[20:52] the rest of his life the rest of his
[20:55] life that was confirming of course my
[20:59] message of him what's the message of him
[21:01] that God is one person not three not
[21:04] three people let and I love this God's
[21:07] letting me know he assured that these 31
[21:10] years of ministry hasn't been in
[21:14] vain hallelujah praise God I'm really
[21:17] grateful that God encourage you
[21:19] encourages you on the way and lets you
[21:21] know your life has not been in vain amen
[21:24] remember brotherr wasn't getting more
[21:26] popular at this time he was getting less
[21:27] popular right right because he was
[21:30] taking a stand on serpent seat on the
[21:32] Oneness of God uh one person uh no women
[21:35] preachers the Lord Jesus Christ baptism
[21:38] he was getting less and less invitations
[21:40] less and less po popular so God comes
[21:43] and shows him a sign that he's still
[21:46] with him and it's confirming the godhead
[21:49] Ministry I love it three rainbows three
[21:51] manifestations going into one bowl amen
[21:54] one person
[21:56] hallelujah amen
[21:59] so the
[22:00] vision came to confirm his ministry
[22:04] wasn't in vain amen hallelujah and
[22:07] that's why you know we had I had that
[22:08] little experience where I I was uh
[22:10] praying about our church and I had the
[22:12] dream of brother bradam and then I had
[22:14] Brother Ray come and give me a
[22:15] confirmation I believe that's my own
[22:17] simple way where God gave me strength to
[22:20] continue in my Ministry to encourage me
[22:23] to show a confirmation to give me some
[22:26] assurance that God's with me hallelujah
[22:28] amen
[22:29] amen it's a vision of the godhead it's a
[22:32] vision of a covenant because a rainbow
[22:35] is a
[22:36] covenant
[22:37] glory and church this reminds us that
[22:40] your labor is not in
[22:42] vain God will give us experiences to
[22:45] encourage us that our labor is not in
[22:48] vain you'll see it in fruits in your
[22:51] life right the love the joy the peace
[22:54] the gentleness the faithfulness the
[22:56] temperance Temperance we preach on that
[22:57] on Sunday amen
[22:59] if you if you see yourself living a
[23:00] healthier life you can see the fruit of
[23:02] of of the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen
[23:06] that's just a simple connection to
[23:07] Sunday's
[23:08] messages see God's going to give you
[23:11] healings and testimonies like brother
[23:12] Phil like the The Nine Pages I'm going
[23:15] to take this down to Kentucky so they
[23:16] can see it too by God's grace I don't
[23:18] want to lose
[23:19] this so they can see that no matter how
[23:22] long the list of of of of threats
[23:25] against you is or or the list of
[23:27] symptoms God greater than symptoms amen
[23:31] hallelujah imagine imagine having nine
[23:33] pages of of of you know just fearful
[23:37] things nine these are all things you
[23:39] could die
[23:40] from you know nine pages of all these
[23:43] symptoms but they can be wiped away in
[23:45] just a matter of days praise God Amen
[23:47] because God is merciful because God is
[23:50] faithful
[23:51] Hallelujah and then our sister Melinda
[23:53] being healed of that static nerve
[23:55] trouble you know God and I write these
[23:58] down church I try to do my best to write
[23:59] down the testimonies that we have by
[24:01] God's grace cuz God's giving us
[24:04] assurance that he's with us praise God
[24:06] and God cannot fail his Covenant
[24:08] hallelujah amen God will not make a
[24:11] promise to you to save us with his love
[24:12] and then take it away it's impossible
[24:15] for God to lie right how's everybody
[24:17] feeling everybody feeling
[24:19] okay
[24:22] amen the word vain means
[24:24] empty or profitless
[24:29] right God was showing brother random
[24:30] your ministry is not empty right your
[24:33] ministry is not profitless in other
[24:36] words it's gained something it has
[24:39] profit to it there there there's fruits
[24:41] to it amen hallelujah there's a blessing
[24:44] to the ministry of the Bible the
[24:46] bible-based ministry of God's Prophet
[24:48] hallelujah amen
[24:50] amen and especially you know just on
[24:53] this topic of the Bible translations I'm
[24:55] not going to spend much time on it but
[24:57] you I can easily see now how Satan you
[25:00] know there's only two paths to a new
[25:01] Bible right or there's only two paths to
[25:03] a Bible either the King James path with
[25:05] those Scrolls or the other path and all
[25:08] the other Bibles are made from the other
[25:10] path right with incomplete uh scrolls
[25:13] with corrupted scrolls with uh sometimes
[25:17] 7 10 15 20% of the words of the King
[25:20] James missing and God said you're guilty
[25:23] if you take one word away not 10% or 20%
[25:28] but just one word away yeah and then to
[25:31] see how there're it's
[25:32] attacking the the the the true Bible
[25:35] doctrine that Jesus first gave to St
[25:37] Paul and then it was lost but it had to
[25:39] be restored by Luther Wesley brother
[25:41] brandom hallelujah amen now if you want
[25:43] to throw a see more in there you can do
[25:45] that too by God's grace because his
[25:47] ministry helped bring back the
[25:49] understanding of the gifts of the holy
[25:50] spirit
[25:53] amen but remember Church your labor of
[25:55] love is not in vain our worship is not
[25:58] in vain because we don't teach doctrines
[26:01] of men as Jesus said in Matthew 159 but
[26:04] in vain do they worship me teaching for
[26:07] doctrines the Commandments of men Paul
[26:10] says if you've uh got Grace then then
[26:14] Grace he says is bestowed on us and he
[26:17] Paul said about him it was not bestowed
[26:20] on me in vain but I labored more
[26:22] abundantly than they all yet not I but
[26:24] the grace of God which was with me amen
[26:26] so how do we know Grace is is
[26:28] accomplishing something because we
[26:30] continue to
[26:31] labor we continue to press on we refuse
[26:34] to give up Hallelujah no matter what
[26:37] friends or family or whatever media
[26:39] might say we don't give up we keep
[26:41] pressing on we keep laboring for the
[26:43] Gospel of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah
[26:47] that's how you know it's not in vain
[26:49] because you see grace working in your
[26:51] life what's causing you to do this grace
[26:53] is causing me to do this what's causing
[26:56] you to keep singing and keep worshiping
[26:57] and praying and reading your Bible and
[27:00] fasting what's causing you to do that
[27:01] God's grace is doing that
[27:05] Hallelujah now remember Church you know
[27:07] this is one thing the the churches Miss
[27:09] they miss that people can fail the grace
[27:11] of God
[27:13] right I believe that's Hebrews 12 let me
[27:16] uh type that in there real quick that's
[27:18] what I didn't have written down yeah
[27:20] Hebrews 12:15 we looked at that on Esau
[27:22] earlier this year remember looking
[27:23] diligently lest any man fail the grace
[27:26] of God
[27:30] fail there in the Greek it means uh to
[27:33] come behind to be destitute to fall to
[27:38] suffer
[27:39] need okay Les and now how how do they
[27:43] fail Grace by a root of bitterness
[27:45] springing up and trouble you and thereby
[27:48] many be
[27:49] defiled so see we got to be real careful
[27:51] to keep our hearts pure we can't let
[27:54] bitterness come into our lives amen the
[27:56] Bible said you can fail great if you
[27:58] become bitter right think about that
[28:01] think of how many friends you have
[28:02] they're bitter against their dad or
[28:03] their mom I mean some of us could have
[28:05] excuses to do that if we wanted to but
[28:08] we have to forgive amen as we've been
[28:11] forgiven we must extend forgiveness
[28:13] that's what brother Brooks preached amen
[28:14] remember that one
[28:17] Hallelujah and then Paul said you know
[28:19] people can receive God's grace in vain 2
[28:21] Corinthians 61 we then as workers
[28:24] together with him beseech you also that
[28:26] you receive not the grace of God in vain
[28:27] he he's begging them don't receive God's
[28:29] grace in vain in other words don't let
[28:31] it come into your life and then forget
[28:32] about it let Grace have an impact on you
[28:35] amen see you know I you know like I told
[28:38] you this many times but just as a
[28:39] refresher I could have Grace on my
[28:41] father because I I had accepted God's
[28:44] grace amen right so if youve received
[28:47] Grace and I I I know I've sinned against
[28:49] God way more than my dad sinned against
[28:51] me so if I if I know Jesus forgave me of
[28:54] that much surely I can forgive God or my
[28:57] dad or any person surely I can forgive
[29:00] them of the few things they've done
[29:01] against me amen hallelujah amen that's
[29:05] right so see grace must be effective we
[29:08] must we must let Grace work within us
[29:11] praise God remember Paul was Afra when
[29:14] the Galatians adopted circumcision back
[29:17] in Paul said I'm afraid of you lest I
[29:19] bestowed upon you labor in vain yeah see
[29:23] then that goes to say sometimes church
[29:25] we don't know who's saved and who's not
[29:27] we don't know who's got the Holy Ghost
[29:28] and who doesn't right because Paul says
[29:31] you are you've adopted circumcision
[29:33] you've adopted legalism I'm afraid that
[29:36] my my labor was in vain yeah God doesn't
[29:40] want us to adopt legalism God wants us
[29:42] to keep the commands of God hallelujah
[29:45] amen not a man-made righteousness not a
[29:49] righteousness which is made by you and I
[29:51] so we feel good or we feel holier than
[29:53] the other Church down the road right or
[29:55] the message Church in the next city you
[29:57] know whatever may be be we're not
[29:59] competing against man we're competing
[30:01] against the sin that's within us praise
[30:03] God Amen
[30:07] Hallelujah now here's another way Paul
[30:09] says you know your life isn't in vain
[30:11] Philippians 2:14 do all things without
[30:15] murmurings and disputings so see how we
[30:18] got we got uh bitterness murmuring which
[30:21] is complaining and
[30:23] disputing these three things are really
[30:26] the same thing right right mhm as far as
[30:29] it's just sin it's speaking the wrong
[30:31] thing it's holding things against people
[30:33] yeah and Paul's going to say in verse 15
[30:35] and 16 that ye may be blameless and
[30:37] harmless the sons of God without rebuke
[30:40] in the midst of a crooked and perverse
[30:42] Nation among whom ye shine as lights in
[30:45] the
[30:46] world you are the light of the world
[30:48] hallelujah amen well let's do it with
[30:51] blamelessness let's be harmless praise
[30:53] God verse 16 holding forth the word of
[30:56] life that I may rejoice in the day of
[30:58] Christ that I've not run in vain neither
[31:00] labored in vain so he says it again like
[31:03] Hebrews 12 and now Philippians 2 and
[31:06] then Galatians chapter
[31:08] 4 if people adopt bitterness they can
[31:11] fall away uh you know of course it would
[31:13] destroy their soul right that would mean
[31:14] they were never born again right
[31:16] murmurings
[31:17] disputings uh all these things could
[31:20] cause people uh to have labored in
[31:23] vain
[31:25] Hallelujah and church you know we we
[31:28] serve God because we love God hallelujah
[31:31] amen am and you know I would just say
[31:33] this too for myself like I want my life
[31:37] to show that brother Brooks and brother
[31:39] Craig and all the preachers that taught
[31:41] me brother Samuel that their labor was
[31:44] not in vain amen you understand amen
[31:47] when I was a young Christian people swed
[31:49] a lot into my
[31:50] life but I want to live a way where in
[31:53] such a way so much like Christ where
[31:54] people can say oh my labor with brother
[31:57] Jesse wasn't in vain amen amen cuz I
[31:59] still hold the gospel amen that's what I
[32:01] want look at your lives and see that
[32:03] that my labor as a pastor was fruitful
[32:06] hallelujah amen how many can say Amen to
[32:08] that
[32:12] Hallelujah Paul says it even with the
[32:14] the Thessalonians remember this was a
[32:16] church where they had a lot of lazy men
[32:18] that wouldn't work Paul had to dress it
[32:20] twice Paul said they had busybody women
[32:23] that walk around and just talk all day
[32:25] men that wouldn't work and he said if
[32:27] you don't work you don't eat see how
[32:30] there's different kinds of churches the
[32:31] Corinthian Church was a little more
[32:32] sensual but they had all these gifts the
[32:34] Ephesian church was this we always hear
[32:36] about the Ephesian Faith right this was
[32:38] this mature church but remember they
[32:39] fell away within 20 years of Paul's
[32:41] letter yeah they'd Fallen away or maybe
[32:43] they moved out or got killed I don't
[32:45] know all the details but the church was
[32:47] over within a matter of
[32:50] years but Paul tells the
[32:53] Thessalonians he told them in 1
[32:55] Thessalonians 3:4 that they should
[32:57] suffer pers or tribulation and then in
[33:00] verse 5 he says for this cause when I
[33:01] could no longer forbear i s to know your
[33:04] faith so Paul knew they were being
[33:06] persecuted and he sent somebody to see
[33:08] how are they
[33:10] doing ever notice somebody that's a
[33:12] little older than you that knew the
[33:13] message before you ever notice when they
[33:15] check up on you brother Brian Hawkins
[33:17] does that to me he checks up on me
[33:20] because he's been serving God a little
[33:21] longer than me right and then that's you
[33:23] know he also we've had it before too
[33:25] where when he checks up on me I was just
[33:26] going to text him to to come preach so
[33:29] we we've seen God do that numerous times
[33:31] just when he's thinking about me
[33:32] checking up on me I'm checking up on
[33:35] him but Paul says I want I sent to know
[33:38] your faith lest perhaps by some means
[33:40] the tempter have tempted you and our
[33:43] labor was in vain yeah so you see
[33:46] sometimes church we just wonder you know
[33:47] people we poured Our Lives into it's
[33:49] okay to check up on them and see how are
[33:51] they doing that's a normal thing to do
[33:53] and it might be the Holy Spirit
[33:55] prompting you to do that so you can
[33:57] encourage them amen amen even this week
[34:00] I put out numerous YouTube videos and
[34:01] people would said right away I was just
[34:03] asking that question I was just
[34:04] struggling with that and it came at the
[34:06] right time brother Jesse now if you
[34:07] would have asked me brother Jesse do you
[34:09] feel letter the Lord at this time to
[34:10] make this I would have said I I'm just
[34:12] working I'm I'm just inspired by this
[34:14] thought but then it's awesome to see how
[34:17] God can take that and send it whether
[34:18] it's across the nation or across the
[34:19] world and God can minister to somebody
[34:22] who needs it at that moment praise God
[34:24] Amen in fact one of the testimonies was
[34:26] his wonderful brother he's probably
[34:27] listening here but he does Prison
[34:29] Ministry mhm anyone here ever done any
[34:32] pron prison ministry that's quite a
[34:34] servant I told him you're a real servant
[34:35] of God when you can go into the prison
[34:37] like that risk your life he said you're
[34:39] a real servant like that that's you
[34:40] don't do for money and he said some days
[34:42] he's so tired and he's got you know
[34:44] physical problems he can can't even get
[34:45] out of bed but he'll try to get out of
[34:47] bed to go minister to these
[34:49] prisoners but he said uh he said brother
[34:52] Jesse your video you put out this week
[34:53] about endless genealogies I don't know
[34:55] if you saw that or uh avoiding vain
[34:57] babblings
[34:58] he said I needed that because there's
[35:00] these prisoners that just want to argue
[35:02] with me and I just asked God lord when
[35:04] do I stop answering all their endless
[35:05] questions and as soon as he prayed that
[35:08] God had me do that video I don't know I
[35:11] just know God's in I just know God's in
[35:13] control God's word will never return
[35:15] void
[35:16] Hallelujah so see Church you know Paul
[35:18] Paul was
[35:19] aware the tempter can come by and snatch
[35:23] the word out of people's hearts amen
[35:26] right now we know God can never or we
[35:28] know Satan will never snatch the word
[35:30] out of our
[35:31] souls but he can snatch it out of our
[35:34] minds sure how many ever had a real good
[35:35] thought then you lost
[35:38] it happens to me all the time that's why
[35:41] I always try to have a phone or
[35:42] somewhere nearby to write down you know
[35:44] as soon as it
[35:46] comes but you know what happens many
[35:49] times for us maybe we're just forgetful
[35:50] because of all the the dings and the
[35:52] notifications we're getting
[35:53] but the tempter takes it away when we
[35:57] give into the wrong thought we choose to
[36:00] think the wrong thought say the wrong
[36:02] word right that's when the tempter may
[36:05] come by he may snatch a freshly swed
[36:08] word out of our minds amen
[36:11] hallelujah but Paul said I wanted to
[36:13] know how your faith was lest the tempter
[36:17] had tempted you that's scripture Luke
[36:20] 8:12 says uh there the seed that was swn
[36:24] by the wayside and then cometh the devil
[36:27] taketh away the word out of their hearts
[36:29] remember that yeah MH so see Satan can
[36:34] snatch words out of people's heart and
[36:36] then Satan can also put lies in their
[36:39] minds like John 13:2 and supper being
[36:42] ended the devil having now put in the
[36:44] heart of judas's Scar Satan's son I'm
[36:46] sorry I'm sorry Simon's son to betray
[36:48] him so Satan snatched the word out of
[36:51] judas's heart and he put his lie to
[36:53] betray him in his heart yeah but Judas
[36:55] had to do it amen aren't you glad
[36:58] Satan's got to get permission for
[36:59] everything that he does amen and God
[37:02] won't give you something you can't
[37:03] handle hallelujah amen and I love what
[37:06] the Bible shows us out of that that um
[37:09] that King aimc if you got Integrity in
[37:12] your heart and if you don't want to sin
[37:13] against God God will keep you from
[37:15] sinning against him amen oh there it is
[37:18] right there amen hallelujah if you don't
[37:20] want to sin God will give you Grace to
[37:23] not sin hallelujah amen oh it's
[37:25] beautiful if you don't want that word
[37:27] getting stat out of your mind then God
[37:29] will protect that word hallelujah
[37:31] hallelujah
[37:33] amen
[37:37] glory remember also James 1:26 and I'll
[37:40] get back to this story from Brother
[37:41] brandham If any man seem to to be
[37:44] religious now religion is a good
[37:47] word unless it's a sinful religion or
[37:49] man-made religion religion just means
[37:51] Pious or devoted or
[37:54] disciplined If any man seem to be
[37:56] religious and brid not his tongue but
[37:58] deceives his own heart this man's
[38:01] religion is vain amen so I've told this
[38:03] to many people we Austin and I talked
[38:05] about it when he first come back if
[38:07] anybody and all of our friends too if
[38:09] any of our friends are cussing it shows
[38:11] their religion is not in vain they just
[38:12] don't have a if they tell dirty jokes
[38:14] their religion isn't real
[38:16] yet right that's what the Bible says
[38:19] their religion is fruitless there's no
[38:22] profit to going to church or singing the
[38:24] music or whatever they download whatever
[38:26] sermons or music download if they tell
[38:28] dirty jokes if they say cuss words if if
[38:30] they curse people the religion has not
[38:32] taken a hold on them amen hallelujah
[38:35] you'd be surprised how many people say
[38:37] they're Christians and say they're
[38:38] allowed to
[38:39] cuss it's
[38:41] impossible the Bible said they deceive
[38:43] their own Hearts but if you ask them
[38:44] they say oh I'm saved I'm saved and they
[38:47] they can be so convincing but the Bible
[38:49] says they're deceived I'm going to
[38:51] believe the Bible every time Hallelujah
[38:53] remember it's coming down it's so close
[38:55] it may deceive the very elect if it were
[38:57] possible amen
[39:02] hallelujah Glory now let's get back to
[39:06] this uh this experience brother Ram said
[39:10] I as I started to approach the three
[39:12] rainbows it began to go away and went
[39:14] down into this bow-like affair and then
[39:16] it disappeared is he got closer or just
[39:17] kind of went down into the bowl and then
[39:19] disappeared I walked up close I was
[39:21] afraid to go any closer because he had
[39:22] stopped me before I got there I turned
[39:24] and noticed that light the way it was
[39:25] shining for me was just exactly in line
[39:28] with the tree where I sat last year
[39:30] where the squirrels appeared somehow the
[39:32] light that was remaining directed him to
[39:34] the same tree he was standing by when he
[39:36] spoke squirrels into existence some 35
[39:39] or 40 minutes later I went down through
[39:41] the woods and over the creek bottoms and
[39:43] so forth till I got to this tree that
[39:46] separates the four directions north
[39:48] south east and west and I climbed into
[39:50] this prong and sat down where I was when
[39:53] he told me that scripture if you say to
[39:55] this mountain be moved how many remember
[39:58] that that's the perfect Faith
[40:00] scripture
[40:02] Hallelujah the perfect Faith scripture
[40:04] is Mark 11 I believe it's 23 and 24 if
[40:07] you say to this mountain and don't doubt
[40:10] in your heart you can have what you
[40:11] asked for amen
[40:15] hallelujah and I stood there a little
[40:18] bit not thinking yet of the rainbow it
[40:20] had left my mind so he already walked a
[40:22] little bit and forgotten about that I
[40:24] stood there and this has been a very bad
[40:27] year year for squirrel hunting
[40:28] everything is late no squirrels now you
[40:31] might be wondering what does squirrels
[40:32] have to do with

[40:52] got the church finished and what did God

[40:59] that right we can do it with any
[41:01] mountain in our way right talk about job
[41:03] situations you can speak to the job
[41:05] situation amen amen if God leads you to
[41:08] do it right
[41:10] Hallelujah I remember that one time may
[41:13] maybe you remember me telling you this
[41:14] my grandpa before he died he was in
[41:16] Toledo and my mom said you better come
[41:18] see him it was right before I was
[41:19] leaving on some trip I can't remember
[41:20] where and I was in our Kia Sadona that
[41:23] that kadona that that gold K kadona and
[41:25] I'm driving right through
[41:27] uh I drove right through Seville there
[41:30] right near doy toown and church this
[41:32] storm was one of the blackest grayest
[41:34] storms I'd ever seen and it was pouring
[41:38] down and I'm I'm I think there was a
[41:40] warning on my phone like a tornado
[41:42] warning and I just listen to brother Ram
[41:44] say speak to the storm I put my head out
[41:47] that window and it's it's rain I went
[41:48] all by myself so God's my witness I put
[41:51] my face out the window and rain's coming
[41:53] down my face I said I speak to this
[41:55] storm in the name of Jesus Christ I've
[41:56] got to get to my grandpa to see him
[41:58] before he
[42:00] dies and just within a matter of minutes
[42:02] it all calmed down and I got through it
[42:04] amen now I'm not you know I'm not saying
[42:08] I saw something I'm just saying I just
[42:09] spoke the word of
[42:11] God and you know God might have worked
[42:13] it out where I just drove through or it
[42:15] might have been something Supernatural
[42:16] now I believe it's something
[42:17] Supernatural amen but the point is when
[42:19] we see an obstacle if we're led by God
[42:22] we can speak to that mountain Hallelujah
[42:24] am and then I was telling brother cam
[42:26] you know we were talking Moses would
[42:28] speak Moses would get was permissioned
[42:30] by God speak and flies will come fleas
[42:34] right right Darkness amen speak he just
[42:37] said speak it and it came forth praise
[42:40] God so see we can speak to a mountain we
[42:43] can speak God's word we can speak I'll
[42:45] say like this may we speak God's grace
[42:47] to People Too
[42:49] Hallelujah
[42:52] Glory said you know I thought right here
[42:55] is where God gave me them squirrels last
[42:56] year to speak into existence because
[42:59] this is speak to your Mountain I took
[43:01] off my hat again and I said Lord God you
[43:03] are still the same Jesus you are still
[43:05] God
[43:07] Amen and something said to me how many
[43:10] do you need this time and I said just as
[43:12] I did the other time the limit the state
[43:15] limit and then I said I shall have this
[43:18] limit before 10:00 today so now he
[43:21] speaking the word
[43:25] hallelujah he said then he said a big
[43:27] mosquito came to bite him right in the
[43:28] eye and I said not one of them will
[43:30] bother me this day no repellent or
[43:32] anything with me and before I knew it I
[43:34] said the sun will shine within 30
[43:38] minutes and brother Bram goes on to say
[43:40] all three things he spoke came to
[43:43] pass he said exactly 30 minutes from
[43:45] that time the sun Shone round about and
[43:47] he said the mosquitoes Buzz all day
[43:50] long and I never got he said I never got
[43:53] stung by one of them
[43:57] Hallelujah brother man I want you to
[43:59] notice there was three rainbows there
[44:01] was three things I said Three Squirrels
[44:05] gotten right Three Squirrels by 10:00 no

[44:09] minutes and there was three witnesses to
[44:11] it brother Banks Woods my son Billy Paul
[44:14] and his son David gave witness to
[44:17] it so they must have saw the sun come
[44:19] out they must have saw some of the
[44:21] effects of what brother said they no
[44:22] doubt saw the
[44:25] squirrels he says and when I seen them
[44:27] rainbows about as white a cross as that
[44:29] Halo is that angel of the Lord but there
[44:32] were three of them running into one and
[44:33] how it helped my heart to know that God
[44:36] Jesus is not just a man as people think
[44:38] he is just a prophet as this modern idea
[44:41] today thinks that Jesus is just a
[44:43] prophet he's Jehovah of the Old
[44:45] Testament made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[44:47] and there that sure did comfort me
[44:51] am praise God hallelujah see Church you
[44:53] develop uh we we we develop
[44:58] you know persecution
[44:59] opposition sometimes we develop doubt
[45:02] and frustrations brother random called
[45:04] frustrations in life but we just stay
[45:06] with what God has showed us we stay with
[45:08] the word of God and God will give us a
[45:11] comfort at the right time amen
[45:15] amen
[45:18] hallelujah I remember you know when
[45:20] brother Mike chister he was here last
[45:21] week I remember when we went up to Maine

[45:26] somewhere around there

[45:29] up in Rhode Island no I'm sorry Maine

[45:32] Maine just a tiny Church a lot like this
[45:35] church maybe smaller by God's grace and
[45:38] I'm like why in the world would brother
[45:40] Mike feel led to bring me up here and we
[45:42] flew on one of those real small what
[45:44] they call the biplanes with the two
[45:45] little propellers on the front I thought
[45:47] I was going to die that night because it
[45:48] was raining and storming and lightning
[45:50] and everything we I was shaking like a
[45:52] leaf in that we were both shaking
[45:53] because there was all this turbulence
[45:55] flying out to Maine but I got there and
[45:57] I just preached a simple message and and
[46:00] the pastor's sister come up afterwards
[46:02] and with tears in her eyes she shook my
[46:03] hand her face is red she said brother
[46:05] Jesse thank you for preaching here I
[46:07] will never be the same amen and the last
[46:10] time I talked to his uh s sorry talked
[46:12] to her uh brother she's doing great in
[46:14] the message by God's grace
[46:17] amen you know just confirmations God you
[46:20] know Mike felt led to go there that's
[46:22] where he danced that Holy Ghost jig in
[46:23] the middle of the airport Boston's
[46:26] Airport at 12:30
[46:28] a.m. then we had to get up at 6:00 a.m.
[46:30] to make the flight so we probably got 3
[46:32] hours of sleep that night and he thought
[46:35] he lo you know we thought they lost his
[46:38] uh luggage and they said oh we found it
[46:41] I remember it come rolling right there
[46:42] she oh he's like there it
[46:44] is he
[46:47] see see him he's like hallelujah thank
[46:50] you Jesus he said oh praise God you know
[46:52] how he
[46:54] is and he just could praise God at 12
[46:56] :30 in the morning I'm just stand there
[46:58] laughing like Hallelujah this guy really
[46:59] loved
[47:02] Jesus I love it and so see God is trying
[47:05] to comfort Us by hearing our prayers and
[47:08] giving us experiences with the Lord
[47:10] hallelujah
[47:15] amen now brother Ram he looks at this
[47:17] Vision rainbows and now he brings in the
[47:19] Oneness and the
[47:21] trinitarians he says there's a group of
[47:23] people call themselves Oneness or Jesus
[47:25] only I don't agree with on their Theory
[47:27] so don't let anybody ever tell you
[47:28] you're a Oneness Pentecostal you're not
[47:31] right they do Jesus only baptism We Do
[47:33] Lord Jesus Christ amen they say God is
[47:36] one like your finger he's not right
[47:39] because Jesus the body of Jesus did not
[47:41] create itself the spirit had to create
[47:43] it right so that's a great difference
[47:46] there Jesus the body could not create
[47:48] itself it had to have a Creator right
[47:50] that's why Jesus said I go to my God and
[47:52] your God Jesus said I'm going to the
[47:54] creator that created this body I'm going
[47:55] back to the spirit that's in me but also
[47:57] there in heaven MH
[48:00] Hallelujah he says I don't agree with
[48:02] them on their Theory neither do I agree
[48:03] with the trinitarian group that says
[48:05] there are three different gods the
[48:06] extreme of the trinitarian see some
[48:08] trinitarians are really extreme on that
[48:10] some are not so extreme but either way
[48:13] they add to the word of God and plagues
[48:15] will be added to them if they don't
[48:16] repent right the people that made these
[48:19] doctrines and push these doctrines they
[48:20] know better I'm not talking about
[48:22] ignorant people God can forgive
[48:23] ignorance God can wink at ignorance but
[48:25] God doesn't wink at people that
[48:27] purposely add to the word of God Amen
[48:30] that's why the Bible said preachers will
[48:31] be judged more harshly than others I'll
[48:34] be judged more harshly these people that
[48:35] write these books and these doctorates
[48:37] and pH modern day Pharisees and
[48:38] everything they'll be judged more
[48:40] harshly because they knew more of the
[48:42] word of God they spent more time in the
[48:43] word of God hallelujah I'm glad to
[48:46] preach the Full Gospel by God's grac
[48:48] amen he says but I believe that the
[48:50] three father son Holy Ghost is one that
[48:53] they are three offices of one God God
[48:56] lived in the fatherhood in the pillar of
[48:58] fire he lived in the sunship in Jesus
[49:00] Christ and he now lives in the Holy
[49:02] Ghost in his church the same Lord Jesus
[49:04] that was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[49:06] is with us today Among Us in the form of
[49:09] the holy spirit amen
[49:13] hallelujah of all the experiences when I
[49:15] turned and first saw it thinking first
[49:17] it must be the sun peep through the
[49:18] cloud somewhere but it was before Sun
[49:20] time and then I seen it wasn't a light
[49:23] it was rainbows and I looked I became
[49:25] numb all over mhm just someone said to
[49:28] me did you feel like shouting they asked
[49:31] brother the BR did you feel like
[49:31] shouting when you saw those three
[49:33] rainbows no I didn't feel like
[49:37] shouting said those experiences never
[49:39] make you feel like shouting they just
[49:42] make you feel
[49:44] anchored amen hallelujah amen and
[49:47] brother man talks about this in other
[49:48] places he said there's anointing for for
[49:50] bubble dancing like we like to We Like
[49:52] to Dance For Joy right brother said
[49:55] that's that's the anointing of the Holy
[49:56] Ghost he said but then there's a fearful
[49:58] anointing where you feel like you might
[50:00] die in the presence of God both are
[50:03] anointings right we want to experience
[50:05] both of them right the reverence the
[50:08] severity of God this the power of God
[50:11] but we also want to have the joy of the
[50:12] Lord amen and brother Adam says you know
[50:15] this was not one of those times where I
[50:16] felt like shouting and he says bubble
[50:18] dancing this is the time I felt anchored
[50:21] like God loved me
[50:23] amen that God was with me that God came
[50:27] to comfort me God came to give me
[50:29] assurance that I'm his true servant amen
[50:31] am Glory what an anchor for the
[50:34] soul that's why God I think had to you
[50:37] know when I first started preaching God
[50:39] had to give me such an answer to prayer
[50:40] when I first started
[50:42] preaching I needed to be anchored that I
[50:45] was called to preach because look at the
[50:47] times we got to go through right

[50:51] to go through as a Christian look at the
[50:53] times we here her here are in 2024

[51:11] know my wife and I some of our our
[51:13] dearest friends Falling Away y but see
[51:17] God had to give me an anchor remember my
[51:18] testimony I was going to preach brother
[51:20] the brookses for the first time it was
[51:21] January 2004 20 years ago and I fasted
[51:26] one or two days before that and brother
[51:28] Brooks had me preach the p.m. service
[51:30] the 3 p.m. service not the 10:00 a.m.
[51:32] the 3 p.m. and I spent my whole time
[51:35] back there and I was shaking like a leaf
[51:37] before I went out I thought I was going
[51:39] to die cuz I was fasting that day my
[51:40] ribs were hurting and I was just shaking
[51:42] under the I felt the anointing of
[51:44] God I was just weeping and crying and as
[51:48] soon as I went out there to preach
[51:49] sister Karen Sanders gave a word and it
[51:52] was uh like a word of knowledge it kind
[51:53] of told what I was going to preach and
[51:55] as soon as that happened I was totally
[51:58] relaxed I preached at that church and
[52:00] maybe there was 70 people there I don't
[52:01] know 50 but after that sermon everybody
[52:04] came to the altar was weeping and
[52:05] repenting and I went around praying for
[52:07] every single person at the altar there I
[52:10] needed an experience to Anchor me

[52:29] except for a few people in the back you
[52:30] know they got kids up at the altar
[52:32] weeping and crying seeking God now some
[52:34] of them received something there that
[52:36] day some of them
[52:37] didn't half of them the church split
[52:40] right half sa the message half left and
[52:42] then the ones that left their Church
[52:44] split so the group that left the message
[52:47] their Church split one me went one
[52:49] Church went more worldly and one Church

[52:53] Holiness dress

[54:24] so with the rainbows the bow Jehovah the
[54:27] old is Jesus Christ the new he says
[54:28] those things are true I know we have
[54:31] things that's said and many times people
[54:32] say well I don't believe in such a stuff
[54:34] as that I can't voucher for that I don't
[54:36] know I can only voucher for what I know
[54:38] is to be truth and God Almighty who
[54:40] wrote this Bible and I'm his servant he
[54:42] knows that that is the truth amen think
[54:45] of it that the day that we're living in
[54:47] just before the coming of the Lord Jesus
[54:48] said there'll be signs in the skies in
[54:50] the earth great sides flying saucers
[54:53] missiles perplex of time distress
[54:55] between the Nations and fearful sights
[54:57] upon the Earth and we're living in that
[54:59] day to see those things y so brother
[55:02] says you know this experience was
[55:04] foretold in the Bible Jesus said in Luke
[55:07] 21:11 and great earthquakes shall be in
[55:09] diverse places places and famines and
[55:11] pestilences and fearful sights and Great
[55:14] Signs shall be there from the heaven
[55:16] hallelujah amen
[55:19] amen Great Signs God places in the
[55:21] heavens he gave some to brother random
[55:23] Hallelujah
[55:27] what a what an experience praise God so
[55:30] church I'm hoping you hoping you see in
[55:31] this message of Grace God shows him
[55:34] Grace God shows him the Covenant because
[55:37] a rainbow represents a covenant I'm with
[55:40] you and I'm giving you Assurance what
[55:42] you preached is right brother Austin
[55:44] it's a good feeling when I can say what
[55:46] I preached is Right In Here by God's
[55:48] grace it's a great feeling brother now
[55:50] it's a good feeling when I know when
[55:52] someone challenged me on something I can
[55:54] say it's right there in the Bible y you
[55:55] can say whatever you want but the word
[55:57] of God Is Right hallelujah amen it's
[56:00] easier for this world to pass away than
[56:02] for one of these words to pass away
[56:04] hallelujah amen it's forever settled in
[56:08] heaven Hallelujah there's some record of
[56:10] this in heaven where it's absolutely
[56:12] right every word of God is yay and amen
[56:15] God's word are purified seven times in
[56:17] the fire hallelujah amen
[56:24] Amen brother said it was my desire to
[56:26] tell you of these things he said many
[56:29] times things happen and I don't speak of
[56:31] it I don't say it but this was too
[56:33] outstanding for me to keep it from the
[56:35] church it must be told and before God
[56:37] who I stand it's the truth I know that
[56:39] there's a God and I know that Jesus
[56:41] Christ is the Son of God Emmanuel
[56:43] dwelling amongst his people today in the
[56:45] form of the Holy Spirit and I know that
[56:46] the coming Lord is drawing nigh when
[56:48] signs and wonders are
[56:51] appearing Hallelujah to think of it I
[56:54] was thinking of that Grace immediately
[56:55] after that that Friday morning just a
[56:58] break of the day up there in that field
[57:00] when I sat on a log later tears come
[57:02] down my eyes I said oh God Your Grace
[57:04] has stooped to save me amen so think he
[57:07] has this experience he doesn't go
[57:09] dancing up to the church he sits on a
[57:11] log and starts crying God has been so
[57:14] good to me amen glory see when God moves
[57:18] for us it shouldn't make us proud and
[57:20] should make us humble praise God Amen he
[57:23] gets to hear the voice of God he gets to
[57:25] see three
[57:28] rainbows and he sits down and says oh
[57:30] God Your Grace has stooped to save me
[57:32] why did you ever have such pity on a
[57:34] poor illiterate Wretch like Me amen
[57:39] right and all these preachers today call
[57:41] themselves such great the greatest of
[57:43] all time and the greatest Pastor in the
[57:44] world and all the and it just shows they
[57:48] haven't had enough experiences with God
[57:50] amen amen CU When you have experience
[57:52] with God it doesn't make you proud it
[57:54] makes you humble amen
[57:58] how did you ever come down to our little
[58:00] humble Tabernacle here I could say this
[58:02] same how did God ever come down to
[58:04] little akan
[58:05] Ohio in a small little church like
[58:09] ours where peace and people of low Walk
[58:12] of Life
[58:14] poor have nothing in this world and
[58:18] still your grace is spread abroad in our
[58:20] hearts amen got anybody poor here got
[58:23] anybody that's a low Walk of Life in
[58:25] here nothing of this world to brag
[58:28] about anybody got any mansions to brag
[58:30] about or Mercedes Benz or something like
[58:35] that any 20200 or 2024 Mustangs anybody
[58:39] got any that to brag
[58:40] about just poor poor humble loow lives
[58:44] we'd say like I've had numerous churches
[58:47] laugh at me when I go there and they
[58:48] hear I'm a first grade teacher the the
[58:49] sisters
[58:51] ago I like what Simon said one time when
[58:53] he preached it you know over there he
[58:56] said to think you know he said I've got
[58:59] eternal life and I'm trying to show
[59:01] these people the the the revelation of
[59:03] Jesus Christ and then my boss I can't
[59:05] even remember the the measurement he
[59:06] told me five minutes earlier I got it
[59:08] remember said that it made me cry I
[59:11] thought look how low of life I am look
[59:14] look what a low place in life I am you
[59:16] know not nothing great in this world and
[59:19] yet you and I I'm a carrier carrier of
[59:22] eternal
[59:23] life I you and I are ambassadors of
[59:25] Heaven
[59:27] Heaven amen Heaven amen Heaven has sent
[59:30] you to be an ambassador trying to bring
[59:32] reconciliation to someone and yet it's
[59:35] so
[59:35] humble it's it's it's so
[59:38] pitiful just a low Walk of Life
[59:42] poor now we got some we we're not
[59:45] illiterate all of you can read the Bible
[59:46] by God's grace right so we have some
[59:50] some blessings in our life for
[59:52] sure but brother ad says see I have
[59:55] nothing in this world and still your
[59:57] grace is spread Upon Our Hearts by the
[59:58] holy spirit that you heal our sicknesses
[1:00:01] and save us from our
[1:00:04] sins and you make us your people and
[1:00:07] deal with
[1:00:08] us why did you ever make me your people
[1:00:12] and deal with us that's what this
[1:00:15] experience has made brother Ram think
[1:00:17] the grace of God had appeared to him and
[1:00:20] it made him grateful
[1:00:23] Hallelujah and church I'm close with
[1:00:25] this this reminds us I lost track of
[1:00:27] time forgive
[1:00:29] me this reminds us here three rainbows
[1:00:33] reminds us of the rainbow in Revelation
[1:00:36] 10 right Jesus comes down as a mighty
[1:00:39] Angel brother Ram said this is history
[1:00:42] already the angel came down with a
[1:00:44] rainbow over his head and gave the open
[1:00:46] book to brother Brandon so we see a
[1:00:49] rainbow connected to brother Ram's
[1:00:51] Ministry and here he has three
[1:00:53] rainbows the godhead amen
[1:00:56] and then Jesus comes down with a rainbow
[1:00:59] over his head a covenant reminding him
[1:01:01] of the Covenant of the New Testament
[1:01:04] like our brother Paul preached here on
[1:01:05] the the new the New Covenant by God's
[1:01:07] grace y hallelujah
[1:01:11] amen so we see a connection and remember
[1:01:14] the mighty Angel come down what he under
[1:01:16] what what did he utter seven Thunders
[1:01:18] amen amen
[1:01:21] hallelujah and gave the open book to
[1:01:23] brother brandham but here we see God's
[1:01:26] Covenant was also with this seventh
[1:01:27] Church age
[1:01:30] messenger hallelujah amen how many know
[1:01:33] that the Bible said we're under the
[1:01:34] blood of a New Covenant right we just
[1:01:36] heard it preached by Brother Paul the
[1:01:39] Bible says in Hebrews 13 now the God of
[1:01:42] Peace that brought again from the dead
[1:01:44] our lord Jesus that great Shepherd of
[1:01:45] the sheep through the blood of the
[1:01:47] Everlasting Covenant make you perfect
[1:01:49] and every good work amen think about
[1:01:52] that what's going to make you perfect in
[1:01:53] the good works the blood of the Covenant
[1:01:55] amen am amen what well hasn't that blood
[1:01:58] already been shed yes that's the glory
[1:02:00] of it amen amen in other words the blood
[1:02:02] that's been shed is going to accomplish
[1:02:05] what God wants to accomplish in your
[1:02:07] life amen it's already
[1:02:09] purchased the the power for you to do
[1:02:12] the works that God has called for
[1:02:17] you oh hallelujah amen the blood of the
[1:02:20] Covenant will make you perfect in every
[1:02:22] good work to do his will amen working in
[1:02:25] you that that which is well pleasing in
[1:02:27] his sight through Jesus Christ to be
[1:02:30] glory forever and ever amen amen so see
[1:02:36] the blood connects you to the Covenant
[1:02:38] and that Covenant
[1:02:40] blood will confirm that you're doing the
[1:02:43] perfect will of God Amen in other words
[1:02:46] the holy spirit will help you see amen
[1:02:49] it will assure you it will comfort you
[1:02:53] it will give you Vindication that you're
[1:02:54] doing the will of God God hallelujah
[1:02:56] amen just like it did Brother Brenham it
[1:02:59] came to encourage him at a time where he
[1:03:01] wasn't more popular less
[1:03:04] popular all men were forsaking him right
[1:03:06] most men were forsaking him and God gave
[1:03:09] that experience to encourage him and the
[1:03:12] blood of the Covenant made brother Ram
[1:03:14] perfect in every good work to do the
[1:03:16] will of God hallelujah and God's grace
[1:03:20] was with him let's stand to our feet
