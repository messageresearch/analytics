the lord's supper let me know we could do the lord's supper i'll try to keep it short too you know kind of like we did christmas i don't know if we can do our service but maybe an hour and a half or two hours with with the lord's supper in there we could if you'd like to do that let me know i would love to do that with you and have the lord's supper together let's just remember stephen and elizabeth as their wedding approaches january 8th i did receive a text from stephen this week he said he's no longer going to be able to come to our church he got a job kind of on the other side of the state near where his wife lives so i don't know when the next time is we'll see him but i just want to announce that that uh he's moving on and uh but we are so glad for having these last two years or so and he was a real good brother i just loved how he opened up more and more to us you know and uh church there were so many times i was preaching and he'd be sitting there just like crying in his seat you know you wouldn't see it you know because you wouldn't notice that right because he wouldn't be like louder like one of you or i or something like that mainly me you know the big cry baby but he just had a real love for the lord and uh we were just so thankful for the time that we had with him and let's just pray that god will bless he and elizabeth as they enter into their marriage and we're so thankful for that also i did put on a new youtube video i think yesterday so uh it's going pretty good and i did have a testimony someone watched my uh video about joseph branham and got delivered out of that false system so we can thank the lord for that praise god amen that that means the world to us you know when we can have a little part in someone's deliverance from a false doctrine because we know those are doctrines of devils you know exalting every word our prophet said to infallibility we're thankful when god delivers people from that so i just that just delights my heart i just i couldn't be happier for that so um so let's have a word of prayer can we just bow our heads and thank you musicians let's just have one more word of prayer heavenly father

supper just guide us there lord to enjoy this communion with you and we'll give you all the glory in jesus christ's name the saint said amen let's take your bibles here tonight by the grace of the lord we want to go to joshua chapter 23 i'd like to continue on this and i think lord willing will finish this book this weekend by god's grace hard to believe we started that in february and here we are in december trying to bring a conclusion to this series here what a blessing part 36 here tonight by the grace of the lord i do have some slides here so whenever we do the text you can switch over so it's joshua 23 let's just read verses 1 2 and 3. joshua 23 1-3 you know i'm just praying and asking the lord to lead me to the next series i definitely wanted to preach colossians as i was working my way through paul's letters with the galatians ephesians philippians i'd like to move on to colossians and perhaps look at the life of the lord jesus that'd be a whole other series but i love to preach us through the gospels and look at the life of christ remember that's so important because brother brahma said the ministry of the bride must match the bridegroom before the coming of the lord in other words the bride's ministry will look just like christ real sweet real humble full of power full of victory here okay thank you i'm sorry joshua 23 1-3 i'm gonna read verses one and two myself and then let's all read verse three verse one says and it came to pass a long time after that the lord had given rest unto israel from all their enemies round about that joshua waxed old and stricken in age verse 2 and joshua called for all israel and their and for their elders and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and said to them i am old and stricken in age let's read verse three together can we one two three and ye have seen all that the lord your god hath done unto all these nations because of you for the lord your god is he that fought for you amen may god as blessings and reign of his word you may be seated praise god well we're kind of a real privilege to be here tonight and we're thankful for god's grace i want to thank austin and lena they're working on letters that we're going to send out this week to as many message churches as we know there's like there's about 90 of them just in the u.s and we're going to offer our books and our videos for free and last time i think we heard back from 2 out of 50. so hopefully we hear back for more but that's okay if not you know we're just trying to help people and and we know the impact that these teachings have had upon our lives right and so we know if people are hungry for more of god god will add the same blessing to their life as well so we're sending those to the pastors and then anyone who we gave a free book of the christian modesty book everyone i kept a record of all those on paypal i think it was like 70. we sent 70 books out for free all those 70 people are getting another letter they're friends of the ministry and see if they like the new book or there's any help we can do we want to give our lives as a service to others a christian's greatness is not measured in what they get a christian's greatness is measured in how much they give right i quoted that ver i quoted that minister on sunday and i misquoted it i forgot it's not john wesley who was it does anyone remember he said earn as much as you can save as much as you can give as much as you can it wasn't john wesley but as one of those uh men from the reformation and i just want to reiterate that give as much as you can praise god because you know you're loaning unto the lord and if you loan anything to god you can guarantee he's going to pay you back god won't forget about you praise god he may he'll test you he'll allow you to be tested but he will never forget about you know god doesn't forget praise god so we looked at our texts here tonight and um you know let's just look again we have a couple more chapters here in this joshua series and we're bringing it down to a close and so tonight we'll try to get through chapter 23 we'll just kind of go through this keep your bible handy we'll be preaching right through these verses it's a very short chapter just 16 verses and we'll be addressing these thoughts here so chapter 23 is a summons by joshua reminding of the blessings and cursings of the land and then chapter 24 is another summons and he urges
