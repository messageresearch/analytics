there are usual scriptures for baby dedications although they're read note numerous times they never lose their power nor their significance because the Word of God is unchanging it's forever settled in heaven praise God mark 10 13 to 16 pardon me the scripture says and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms and put his hands upon them and blessed them praise the Lord amen I'd like to dedicate Genevieve to the Lord here

for every child Lord in this church and in our family and all the families Lord God that your presence would guide this child let the purpose of God that was determined before the foundation of the world for Genovese life may it be accomplished for your glory may it be fulfilled by the hand of God Lord guide her steps Lord order her steps in your word Lord God may she fulfill every command Lord

let's give the Lord Rama pause for he died let's take a picture here I was like you take a picture of the family got their baby [Laughter] praise the Lord Amen praise God thank you sir thank you praise the Lord Amen so he's so wonderful you know my mother-in-law was able to come and she just wants to be at every dedication and I think that's outstanding amen that she can take the time to do that and travel and just make such a wonderful sacrifice to be with us so or bless you Tammy thank you and thanks for all your tremendous support you've been a tremendous blessing to us so thank you let's get into the Word of God here so Stan and take your Bibles here let's go to the book of Ecclesiastes I'd like to continue on this series on the wisdom of God are you grateful for God's wisdom amen praise God thankful that we can live the way God wants us to live for wisdom we know his skillful living choosing the best path choosing God's perfect will the book of Ecclesiastes chapter 7 please now I'd like to I was just heading on my heart a few days ago to ask sister Tonya if we could if we could do either Bible studies with her or however however we like to do we like her to introduce her to our foundational beliefs and and so I said well how about I just on Sunday morning how about I just preached for like 45 minutes on my topic for the whole church and then I can spend about half an hour going over some of our foundational beliefs by God's grace so she's on her way I know she's not here yet but I sent her a text and she said she's on her way so I like to plan to preach about a hour and a half this morning and hour and 15 minutes Lord willing sorry because we only have one service and I'll try not to wear myself out and try not to wear you out as well but I want to do that and I want to you know Tanya's been coming so faithfully the last what six months or so and I just I kind of just been too forgetful to you know invite her to do Bible studies and things like that to kind of show her are all of our Bible based beliefs because everything we believe is in here by God's grace so we want to do that and so I'll set a little timer and Lord winning will be able to when she gets here you know at the end of the message just go over some of our core beliefs so let's read Ackley's ask you chapter 7 our text I'm sorry chapter 9 verse 16 sorry we're going to start preaching in Ecclesiastes 7 and then we want to go to Ecclesiastes chapter 9 I want to finish preached chapter 7 8 9 this morning by the grace of God I [Music] believe church God has given me much revelation and understanding of the book of proverbs and Ecclesiastes through this series I want to say it tell the Lord thank you for that praise God for I could never understand some of these things before but it seems like the Holy Spirit just kind of keeps opening up things so we can understand the word of the Lord we're very grateful for that please ask these 9:16 let's read it together 1 2 3 then said I wisdom is better than strength nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not hurt amen let's have one more word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we've read your eternal Word and father we know that wisdom is better than strength dear God well we heard last week even with brother Joe ministering Lord and how Lord no matter what as we fight battles were outnumbered and all the Bible characters and all their stories were outnumbered Lord and and you always came upon the scene and and Lord it boiled down to wisdom was better than human strength dear God your your ways and your thoughts and your will is always better than physical strength or the amount of numbers of people so father we we know that we're assured of that quicken it to our hearts Lord God as we preach your word and Lord let the wisdom of the Holy Spirit our lives father but there'll be one virgin Lord God who's raptured and that's the wise one Lord God and we want to be that wise virgin according to Matthew 25 Lord the parable you told Lord God we want to have our lamps trimmed and clear we want to be burning bright with the light of the Holy Spirit Lord in this hour so we thank you for that bless every heart and soul that's gathered in thy divine presence and ministered every need in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless yous B&C the praise the Lord so we like to start there let's now if you got your Bibles let's go back to Ecclesiastes 7 iLike to just look at you know Wednesday we looked at verses 1 and we went all the way to about 24 so we we looked at we actually preached Ecclesiastes chapter 5 6 and almost all of 7 by the grace of the Lord so we're almost through the book by God's grace and if we can stay on track will almost be done maybe we can finish Wednesday night amen I like to I like to get things finished praise God I start my personalities so often to start things and and it takes me a while to finish but I want to finish it by God's grace so we see today that are opening scripture is that wisdom is better than physical strength remember two weeks ago we preached on Jehoshaphat in the book of 2nd chronicles chapter 20 and we saw how he was outnumbered the the armies of Moab and the armies of the ammonites were out numbering him he was totally surrounded and his kingdom was Judah so Judah was completely surrounded and he was outnumbered but in that case wisdom was better than strength the strength of the Moab Moabites and the ammonites was physically greater than Israel but Israel had a strength that they couldn't see and that strength was in worship amen they worshiped the one true God and as they worship and as they prayed the Holy Spirit put it on the Kings heart to call the prophet and the Prophet gave him thus saith the Lord let's say the Lord that you overcome army and then you'll overcome by by worshiping the Lord amen forgive me and that's how we overcome today by worshiping God no matter what the situation looks like no matter what the conditions are we still give a continual sacrifice of praise because we know God has ordered our steps we know God knows the beginning from the end and we know the plans that God has for us they're not plans of evil they're plans for good but you know the world thinks good only means millions of dollars and and popularity and all these things but the Christian knows that's not always what God's into many times God's not into that but we know good for us means God's will praise God that we keep the Word of God without sinning and so we know the will of God good for us means obedience to the Word of God and God's will that he's already laid before us amen so Jehoshaphat put the worship first and he had the wisdom to do that he had the wisdom to know when I'm in trouble I've got to pray to God when I'm in trouble I've got the worship God and let God fight for me amen so wisdom was better than strength so was it in the days of Elijah when he was against 450 BHEL prophets wisdom was better than strength praise God he had wisdom to let them cut themselves and dancing and do all their all their enchantments to try to call on the names that are gods he had wisdom just to wait and not get swayed by that can you imagine 450 verse 1 alright and then Elijah just stood there but but God had showed him a vision the Bible said and he saw he said he he saw the gods on the wait until they're all done and then rebuild that altar of worship and then God would send fire down from heaven and so Elijah stay with the word he had wisdom to know I've got to stay with what God showed me and so do we have wisdom to know we must stay with what God has showed us they men no matter how much we're outnumbered we've got to reestablish true worship the right water baptism the right ideas about the Godhead the right kind of clothes to wear the right way to use our money the right way to invest our time once we've got the reorder of the altar of worship and when we do that God will vindicate it with the pillar of fire amen amen by healing by saving by delivering amen by granting us his will remember Elijah and his Hayes's servant were outnumbered by the Sirians army but Elijah wasn't shaken at all he said Lord open his eyes that he can see that there's more with us than there are with them amen see wisdom let him know that that wisdom is always better than human strength amen and we know today were small in number were small in you know maybe finances or we're small even as a building but we know that doesn't matter to God because wisdom is better than having a megachurch where there's no spiritual truth being priests amen we know the wisdom of God is better than strength in numbers amen and the world only the world would be deceive a true Christian would not be deceived by judging well if there's more people there they must be more blessed by God or if there's if they have a bit bigger building then they must be closer to God but a true Christian knows that that that's not always the determining factor praise God in fact God's people were almost always outnumbered and that's the way it is Jesus even said in the last days Jesus said phew there will be that fine the narrow road it's not a great many people it's very few that will be saved and so those are the words of Jesus in Matthew 7:14 and so we must take those and we must say God make me one of those few praise God because the paul said evil men and seducers will wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but Jesus came that we might have truth the way that we might receive the truth and the truth would set us free amen go glory so wisdom is better than strength praise God now in your Bible and it please a c7 on Wednesday we preach how the value of a good name how it's so important that people call you say good things about your name it's better than precious ointment amen also the reality of mortality the Bible said it's better to be at a funeral than to be at a party and that's true right because the sad countenance makes our heart better when we're faced with the reality of death when we're faced with the reality that we have to stand before God it makes us live a better Christian life amen hallelujah and the Bible said the day of your death is better than the day of your life and that's true as well because on the day of your death you finally see Jesus amen hallelujah amen and that's better than the day that you're born although we thank God for the day that were that were born hallelujah and so we saw the wisdom of God that corruption is so pervasive according to Solomon even in his day and that the end of a thing was better than beginning but we saw then how wisdom gives life amen so we feel like ours were spiritually dead or if we feel like there's no hope and and all the hopes are dead that we know one thing for sure that if we can find God's mind if we can find the Word of God for our situation if we can find God's will for our lives we know that we'll bring life to us and we'll feel rejuvenated will feel strengthened we'll be transformed amen as many times church in American art our troubles not physical persecution it's mental depression right it's mental persecution it's it's spiritual wickedness in high places our persecution right now is more here in America where we've got to overcome being discouraged we've got to overcome being depressed we've got to overcome feeling hopeless and even celebrities take their lives all the time because they feel hopeless yet with millions of dollars in the bank because they reject the life that God offers them and that life is only in the Word of God amen hallelujah that's the only place where you find the life of God is and the wisdom of God amen it's in the Word of God and so we can have hope in the midst of darkness in the midst of a nation that's backsliding from its from its original foundations that's totally backs it and churches are backslide in the midst of this wicked and darker age we can stand on the life of God because God's Word remains unchanged amen glory now in let's go to Ecclesiastes 723 we'll pick up there all this have I proved by wisdom I said I will be wise but it was far from me that which is far off an exceeding deep who can find out so remember let's just remember where Solomon's at at this time Solomon is at the end of his life he started off on fire for God but he back slid horribly so much so by the end of his life the Bible said that the Lord was angry with Solomon God can you imagine having God upset with you we don't want to walk like that church amen we don't know that we weren't a God to be pleased with us amen but Solomon had sold he had so read despised the Word of God the Bible said because his heart was turned from the Lord which had repaired to him twice God physically appeared by a vision to Solomon twice and yet Solomon still went against the commands of God and married all those women the Bible said that the women the muhabba said the King Solomon loved many strange women and the Bible said 700 wives princesses and 300 concubines and the Bible said that there's wives when he was old turned his heart away after other gods oh there's nothing more shameful than to see somebody start off on fire for Jesus but then slowly see them start loving the world more than they look Jesus nothing's more shameful than that to see them prayer and read their Bible and love God raise their hands at work of shout and cry and praise the Lord but then at some point they just sit there stiff and starchy and pretty soon they stop coming to church and pretty soon their life spiritual life is all dried up there's nothing more awful than that and it was so true in Solomon's life that God stopped being happy with him and God got angry with him amen because Solomon loved the women God was angry with him it was his responsibility and he lived contrary to the way God had called him to live amen the Bible said he built a high place so he built an altar for every false God and the Bible said he built them on the hill before Jerusalem did you catch that before you got to Jerusalem and so what is it showing Satan took preeminence over over God's temple so before you got to God's temple you had to see all these false idols and what was it it was Satan taking the preeminence Satan's altars were seen first our youth me and so that's how it was in his life the travelers that were the worshipers that came in before they could even get to the Lord they had to be exposed to all this false religion and I had Dollar Tree oh my but they should have been torn down amen when he was living right with God all these idols were torn down well the same thing that happens to our life but we just you know we start off strong and there's no idols but then we'll bill let things build up and instead of us getting fully focused on the Lord and and God just having preeminence in our in our lives we set up idols that come before the house of God nothing should be come before the house of God but we should let God have first place in our lives amen at the beginning of Simon's reign you never would have saw idols on the way to church right you your own you would not have passed those things but as he got already started backsliding and compromising well this is okay just one just want to do this and pretty soon he was so far back stirred that you could even recognize that this is your 'some because it's filled with idolatry Omaha so look Church and now he's at this spot where he says he says I want to be wise but it's far from me now that isn't a statement about of exciting experience I don't know what is he was filled with so much wisdom at the beginning that he wrote the whole book of Proverbs and the Bible said he had three thousand proverbs he was at the beginning of his work he was so filled with wisdom and now he's at the end he's so far from God so far back slidden that he said wisdom is so far from me yet he's the one that wrote the book of Proverbs can you imagine that you used to feel so close to God but now you feel so far and you want to get back right with God but you can't get back to where you were because of your sins oh thank God today though that God still restores he said I will restore saith the Lord amen if you feel far from God don't be discouraged repent of your sins break down the idols because that's what Hezekiah did a few hundred years after Solomon he broke down every Idol the Bible said he smashed them to sand and pieces and then he took all the pieces of those idols and threw him in the Jordan amen hallelujah and that's the only way to get back to God is to destroy all your idols and start all over clean it out and then God's presence will return amen that's right he's so far from God now go to John if you got actually let he just put up John 327 I was gonna read one scripture thank you darlin he's wondering where's God's wisdom he's so far back slid he said these things are exceedingly far off they're so deep who can find it out look what John 327 says John answered and said a man can receive nothing except to be given him from heaven ha ha ha ha Solomon III need how can anybody know anything deep how can anybody ever figure out the wisdom of God wisdom seems so far from me see Solomon had stopped reaching out to heaven for four things instead he was reaching out to his wives for physical play sure and of course the the the fathers of their lives for money and political gain he was reaching out to those things instead of reaching out to heaven but when he was reaching out to heaven God said I'll bless you I'll answer your requests and I'll give you things you didn't even ask for amen Oh church we've got to look up to heaven if you receive anything good it's not for me it's not from anybody here it's from God Almighty amen hey man God send us something good today praise God that we can leave here and say I've heard from heaven I received something from heaven God spoke to me it was God's Word it was God's direction and I've received it from heaven not from a man not from a woman but God spoke to me God met my need and I've heard from heaven and Oh hallelujah the Solomons channel was cut off because of all the idols in his life didn't have time to pray like he used to didn't have time to focus on the wisdom like he used to and so the blessings of heaven are cut off who could know these deep things my the word is so deep I just can't understand these things see heaven was cut off because he was so attached to the things of the world that's why we need a fresh circumcision praise God if you need one you can get a fresh circumcision like Joshua he brought the people back in and he had a freshly circumcised the new generation as a symbol to cut off the things of the world be separated from the things of the world and be committed only to God amen now the reason church I preached all that is to get to the end of the chapter look at the end of the chapter verse 25 so he's searching for deep things he can't get through to God and this is an often too misunderstood scripture here it seems as though Solomon's blaming women like like it's the woman's fault that he's back slidden it's not will woman's fault it's his fault it's easy for her it's easy to blame other people for your problems isn't a church but really whose fault is it it's ours it's your fault it's my fault when I said it's not someone else's fault it's not even the devil's fault it's my fault exactly look at verse 25 I applied my heart to know in the search and to seek out wisdom and reason of things and to know the wickedness of folly even the foolishness and madness and look what he found and I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets and her hands as bands who so pleased with God shall escape from her but the sinner shall be taken by her isn't that interesting he's talking about a sinner being taken by women and he was taken by a thousand and that's striking he can see everybody else's mistakes but what about you that's how we all right oh we can see oh this sermon would be good for somebody else but what about the sermons good for us when are we gonna get a sermon for us so it's like well this one should go to him that really helped her that really helped her but how about you when is God talking to you God ought to be talking to us every service amen amen he ought to be talking to each one of us we oughta just not be assigning the word to other people we all let the word be assigned to us amen how can I serve God better what can I do more better for the kingdom of God where's my short places where's my weaknesses that they might become strengths amen Oh hallelujah so he says I want to know about wickedness and I found more bitter than death the woman who to traps me and sin putting the blame on the woman that's what Adam did right remember in the Garden of Eden who dad-blame he said Adam why you've done this he said the woman that you gave me did this or brother branham said his yeast packet he's passing the buck always passing the responsibility onto somebody else no we need to take responsibility for ourselves now there are sins of course that could have been done to you as a child or that even as an adult that you didn't have control over don't fret God will bring those people in a judgment for that and still in the midst of that pain we should still as Christ a God be merciful bring that person to repentance but many times shirts you know those aren't the things that get Christians many times that things are things that we've done that Satan tries to to deceive us and make us blame other people rather than taking responsibility for ourselves the spirit we're gonna battle hardest church is the religious sphere of the Pharisees and Sadducees who outwardly look good but inward were full of dead men's bones oh and I come to church I don't want to be dead on the inside I want to be alive on the outside I've got a stain on my jacket I'm not gonna let that hinder me from coming to church I'm not gonna worry about that I don't one of these seat stains on my life amen I don't want any sin stains in my heart I want to be allowed to the word I want to love the word I want wisdom to bring me life amen so when I go home my children will see the life of Christ in me that my wife will see the life of Jesus lived through me so that the hundreds of children that I ministered to every week will see the life of God in me praise God and it won't be me it'll be Christ in me the hope of glory if they don't see that they're gonna see some some sinner who needs God's great well we all need God's grace but we want to be reflecting we want to be obedient children and we will be manifesting the life of Jesus Christ to this generation hallelujah now let's look at the next verse so he blames those women verse 27 behold this have I found say the preacher counting one by one to find out the accounts he counted every one of these women behold this I found saved the props art verse twenty-eight yet which my yet my soul seeketh but I find not one man among a thousand have I found but a woman among all those have I not found lo this only have I found that God hath made man upright but they have sought out many inventions now this scripture is true for churches it's hard to find one good woman one good church out of a thousand churches is that right that's exactly right amen this scripture applies to churches and brother Branham applies this of course to the authority of church age and he applies it to the Jezebel spirit from the book of Revelation chapter 2 the Thyer to you in church aid program says a dominating female is the greatest curse in the world the wisest man the world ever saw Solomon said that and we just read that so brother baron applies this to the Jezebel church system which we know as hard as is to say we know the Jezebel church is the Roman Catholic Church because of and I have three videos on my youtube channel with 14 proofs Kandam 10:14 there's 14 proofs that proved that Jezebel Church or the mother church which they call themselves a mother church - is the Roman Catholic Church but don't forget that mother had daughters the Bible says so every denominational Church that came out after the Roman Catholic Church when they denominated and failed to move on with the Holy Spirit they denominated they limited God and then they started dying themselves that's right now let's look at Solomon again so Solomon looks and eke out a thousand women he can't find one good women out of the thousand now church this is the same man that wrote proverbs 31 are you with me this man earlier in his life he ended the book of Proverbs by salting the godly woman higher than rubies Amen and we found out that was over five million dollars in the value of rubies beginning of Solomon's life he exalted the godly woman she's worth more than five million dollars Amen hallelujah the Bible said a woman that fears the Lord Solomon said she shall be praised amen so the same man that was before in his godly position he was seeing women as godly the godly women as a wonderful thing but now in his back sitting condition also you can see his women that are lowdown and dirty just like him are you with me and I wonder which a thousand women he was counting around him probably as heathen wives and of course out of a thousand heathen wives you're not gonna find one good one if they don't work Jehovah are you with me church but this scripture does not show that let me say this plenty this scripture does not show that women are worse than men spiritually it doesn't show that so brothers if you got that idea you've got the wrong idea amen praise God because the Bible says in Galatians chapter 3 the Bible says that you're all children of God by faith in Christ Jesus the Bible said there's neither Jew nor Greek neither male nor female you are all one in Christ Jesus amen so men are not greater as far as salvation the eyes of God they're not greater than women but see some men will take description they'll say say yeah say there's hardly any good women out there well let me say like this there's hardly good men out there I don't see many real good men standing on the Word of God amen that are leading their families according to the Bible that they're praying and seeking God fasting and not eating and trying to get closer to God and put God above everything I find very few men that do that in fact in our church we find a lot more women that do that in our church because we just have outnumbered and we have more women than men so see you if someone takes an idea they're just a plain old woman basher and shame on them for bashing God's women the Bible doesn't tell us either one which is easier to find but in Solomon's day he's counting a thousand he's back slitted he's blaming the women for putting him in traps when it's his fault he's in the traps it wasn't the woman's fault because Solomon could have said no but he couldn't turn down that almighty dollar could he he couldn't turn down that political power well if I can get all these nations on my side I could I can make more money I can be more powerful shame on that you and I should never compromise with sin in order to get more money we should rather be fit be better to be more poor but yet to be pleasing in the eyes of God amen more money does not always equal God's favor many times it's the opposite amen hallelujah and so we must stay with the word of because Church we can't forget a few things here we want to remember all these things we want to remember that Solomon is at the end of his life he's depressed and he blames the women more bitter than death are these women who put them and put me in instance snares well that's true that's that's evil that the women tried to put him in a snare but it's evil that he gave into it as well and let me ask you this church who is ultimately behind every evil woman that Solomon's talking about who's ultimately behind every evil woman a man the son of the morning and the church said who's ultimately behind every one who's all three behind the Roman Catholic Church and not the people but the system who's ultimately behind Jezebel system who's ultimately behind know that it's a dirty old man named Lucifer so behind though of the women there's a dirty man is that right Church see Jezebel the Bible says was in the depths of Satan Satan she was in the depths of a man Satan amen hallelujah so see we got a Solomon here be a little you know we got to understand his spiritual state he's blaming the women instead of him taking a countability that's right we can't so brothers today we can't have a complex toward women you remember brother branham battle the complex toward women brother Bram said some pretty harsh things against women because he had a complex toward him when he was growing up cause he saw you know his dad was making moonshine all's he saw was women that were dressing him orally staying up all night leaving their children at home I could party and get drunk and so he got a really bad attitude towards women and the church said now everything he preached from the Word of God was true but see there's some things he said about women that were a little too far in my opinion because they were just a little rough I think and so some of those things I won't even repeat just because they're so rough but listen Church sometimes you and I say things that are so rough that I wouldn't want to repeat some things you say is that right how would you like it if I recorded you in your sinful years and then I brought that out before everybody years later wouldn't that be awful that would be awful I used to condemn people I used to say go to blank and I said oh I thank God that that's all under the blood of Jesus Christ because I don't say that anymore he's cleansed our hearts because from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks we should not be cursing anything except cursing those demons that are behind sickness we should be cursing Satan in the name of Jesus Christ amen that's exactly right so don't forget who's behind every evil woman it's an evil man that's right so bear with me here brother branham said now you say you're awful hard on us women all right men here you are any man that will let his wife wear those kind of clothes and smoke cigarettes that shows what you're made out of I got little respect of you even being a man so they would accuse brother branham you're so hard on women he's like all right let me bounce it out he said if you let your wife act like that you're not even a real man amen he says later on if you listen to dirty music and put posters up of evil women he said I got little respects of you even being a man he said I don't care how big your muscles are you're not even a man he said the only way to judge that you're a man is when you're on your knees in prayer amen that's how you judge a man which men are playing which ones are trying to find the voice of God the win of God now you'll find no real man amen that's exactly right so see he bought out men too but see he had he had a complex about women so he struggled with that now the things from the Bible we said are true all these things but I'm letting you know this Solomon he seems to be placing all the blame upon the women that set traps for him [Music] that'd be just like as we were talking let me just like well well I I got caught up into this dirty joking and and it was all that person's fault and I laughed at it and I just said a dirty joke back no it's not their fault it's your fault because you should have been so strong the Bible said you should cast down anything that exalts itself against the Word of God the Bible said take cap into captivity any thought that exposes itself against the Word of God take that into captivity and cast it down in Jesus name don't let it be exalted in your mind don't let it be exalted we're supposed to be kings and priests this morning amen we're supposed to be spiritual rulers that can judge between right and wrong and cast out evil and let the good reign in our lives amen oh I feel free in the holy spirit this morning amen I do yeah praise God now is there truth of this of course I believe spiritually it's more true because spiritually out of a thousand churches you're to be hard to find one good one because remember any group of religious people is a church according to the Bible any gathering this morning where people are gathering the Bible calls it a woman because Christ is the man and the people are likened unto women is that right amen that's why our church is called Bride of Christ fellowship because we want to be married to Jesus Christ the husband the Bible said this is a great mystery but marriage is a symbol of Christ and the church he's the husband and we're supposed to be the obedient wife thankfully our husband never makes any mistakes amen he's never gonna apologize he's the God's got never got to change anything he said everything he says right is perfect the first time we're the ones we have to humble ourselves and apologize amen but not true in the natural many times the most mistakes I make in our marriage is my mistake that's just what brother Branham said you know brother may have said he said my wife is my correction did you brothers know that said brothers don't you know my wife is my correction I've had that so many times I left Church and we're on the drive home and now I'm I'm scared to talk to my wife when after I get done preaching she's gonna point out my mistakes which I appreciate well you know as a man I don't want to make any mistakes I don't want to I don't want to make any mistakes but many times my wife has helped me see where I might have overlooked something made a mistake said something wrong and I appreciate that I don't want to be wrong I want to be right and whatever channel God can use to get me to be right I say hallelujah to that so Solomon out of a thousand women didn't find one godly well it depends where you go looking if you go to the Cleveland Browns game today you're gonna have a hard time finding a thousand do it one good woman out of a thousand or a man because they're all drunk with their dog faces on and cussing and swearing and cursing the dealers or Patriots whoever it is you're and the Bible says if you say one evil word the Bible said your religions in vain think about all those customers they say the Bible says if you say one cuss word your religions in vain your religion is not working inside of you our religion should work so that only good things fall out of our mouths and we have nothing good to say we shouldn't say anything at all it'd be hard to find one good man down there at Cleveland this morning unless they're playing away game it'd be hard to find out wherever they're at I think you understand what I'm saying or the Cavs game last night or whoever played last night or the house Tate game yesterday I know they played in Columbus yesterday because woman was talking to me about it on the Verizon on the phone so it's hard it's hard to find a godly person if you're looking in the wrong spot now say like this is we know Jesus said few there be that find it it's gonna be hard to find godly people today in this hour that's right now let's go to Ecclesiastes chapter 8 how many put on time yeah I appreciate - I appreciate that these ask you chapter 8 let's go a little bit further here and then I want to stop and I want to do some there's some foundations for our sister Tanya it's good to see her by God's grace the Lord bless you sister now I think we'll just maybe get down here we'll try to get maybe through like the first we'll try to maybe down and get down to verse 13 or something like that I hope everybody can see that I don't want to have a you know I've heard many churches especially the message where the preachers get in the flesh and they just condemn women all the time there are more harsh on the women than they in the met than they are the men and they let the men do evil things and they won't say nothing about it shame on the churches that do that God has one standard for everybody man or woman everybody needs to obey the Word of God no one's above any other as far as they're in their stance and as far as in the eyes of God now of course the Bible says men are called to lead men are leaders but all that means is they have more responsibility enough to answer to God at the day of judgment for more responsibility praise God remember in the beginning Eve was a helpmate so as sisters as your the wives you're supposed to just support the vision that your husband got from God Almighty how do you aim in your husband's supposed to pray and seek God until he catches the vision of God and then she's there to complete you she's there to complete you and help you amen that's exactly right I thank God for my wife she's helped me that she's just been a tremendous help mate the vision God gave me to Pastor a church 12 years ago sometimes I think I was crazy for starting a church but you wouldn't have to tell me that 12 years ago and I'm okay with it now of course you know but there's just so much the constant pressure like as soon as I get done with the service today I'll have that pressure oh you know you got to get a sermon ready for Wednesday it's just like and that could great if I don't balance that if I don't let off the pressure and just relax and pray that pressure makes me feel stressed out at home and that makes the atmosphere at home not very good either so learn better learn continually how to balance that pressure but my wife helps me by the grace of the Lord she's called the vision amen all right Robert please ask each chapter eight let's try to maybe get through the first let's read verse one who is as the wise man and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine and the boldness of his face shall be changed now honey know that when you have the glory of God upon you the Bible says a merry heart maketh medicine how many know the Bible says that when you're happy in the things of God your smile or your words or your heart is like medicine how many know that your smile your life your countenance your joy your happiness if you should be like a walking medicine around the people that you are amen can I just read this out of friend text me on Friday morning let me just read this to you I thought it was a blessing he says he said I do have to say I'm so blessed to be around people like you your you say he said you're God's true disciple I didn't ask him to say this he said thank you for being the voice of God he said Oh hallelujah he said thank you I got it right here I can show you after if you want to see it he said they give her being the voice of God it helps especially since some of us get off track he says now hundred ask for this but he's looking at me saying you're a true disciple and you are he said the voice of God to me Church isn't that what all of us should be we should all be voices of God amen arrived she just speaks something about God is holy God is to be served God is to be worshiped God has to be reverence god is good God is faithful God's Word is true our lives should be voices of God amen it's exactly right and if you are the voice of God then your face shines the Bible says glory a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine how do you get god's face to shine upon you obey the word of god because even sinners you see him on the cover of People magazine and a National Inquirer you see sinners smiling there and yet you know they're in the homosexuality or or they're in them they murdered people or something like that and yet they can sit there and smile now the way to know how come sinners can smile and Christian smile too well the way to know is start talking about the Word of God amen tell them that it's a sin to murder tell them it's a sin to watch dirty filthy shows like that tell them it's a sin to homosexuality and all these and then watch their face after that now you'll see who's got the countenance of the Lord now praise God amen as that's exactly right see anybody can smile that's not that what he's talking about he's talking about when the word is in your life now who has the countenance of God upon their face remember Stephen was getting stoned the Bible said his face look angel and all the other faces were all angry and throws those why because he was saying you guys need the Holy Ghost you need to get born again and that's what we're saying these denominations the Holy Ghost they got to be born to get amen and if we're not born again then you better get born again amen and now your response to that shows what kind of face you got amen I see some good faces in here that's wonderful now it shows the wisdom of God what have you told some your closest friend your family member your church is actually off the Word of God your church is Baxton your church is filled with doctrines of devils jesus said now watch their face see who responds well to that one oh of course it is yeah I love going to a church that has doctrines of devils yes well then that's so deep a demon spirit - right but tell somebody how long they are in the word and then watch their countenance that will show how much wisdom they it's exactly right the proof is k-member God said Cain if you sacrifice like Abel by the blood of the Lamb you'll be accepted the Bible said his countenance got angry and he turned from the perfect will of God brother Branham said he turned from them and the Bible his countenance got angry and wrathful and he went out the prints of God he went and killed his brother right after that so your countenance says a lot your countenance in church your countenance when you're reading your Bible your countenance when you're hearing the word of God there's a big important part to that brother Aaron even says when demons know they're gonna be exposed he said their people's faces get all different and all nervous and all upset and all angry like that and I've seen it before people don't like you preaching on their sins and so their faces get all angry and all I had and get all kind of looking down and won't look in the eye all over there's something about the glory of God on the face that knows their life is innocent that knows their forgiving that knows they may they've given those true worship to God there's something about that face that is rise and it has the countenance of God's glory on it oh yes sir oh my verse two thank you lord yeah these these sinners all over the media there they smile but yeah give them the word test see if their smile for that verse - I counsel lead to keep the Kings commandment and in the regard of the oath of God be not hasty to go out of his sight stand not in an evil thing for he doeth what server pleases him so was talking about being in the presence of a king be very careful the prends of the king shouldn't we apply that to ourselves we should be very careful how we act in the presence of the King King Jesus now look at verse 4 where the King is there's power and who may say unto Him what doest thou whoso keeping the commandments shall feel no evil thing in a wise man's heart discern if both time and judgment now we can look at this at the eyes of Jesus how many know Jesus is the king of kings and Lord of lords there's power in the words of Jesus now let me bring it down to you how many are spiritual Kingdom priests unto God the Bible says we are we are kings and priests right now and if you are a king then you've got power in your spoken word jesus said if you say to this mountain be moved and cast in the sea you'll have what you asked for amen and we got to be careful how we use that we just can't throw that around and try to do what we ever we want we've gotta wait until God gives us the option or gives us the inspiration it said then when it's said like that then it will come to pass like I told you with my friend Tom Atkinson I went the prayer closet that night I heard about it and I cried I said God I speak to that mountain in the name of Jesus Christ and I command that heart condition to move the next day he opened his eyes amen the next week he was talking the week after that he was walking the week after that he was home and I'm still trying to set up an opportunity to go talk to him hey man you see it was speaking to them I didn't do it it wasn't me it was something inside of me amen it wasn't me if something is it isn't you it's something behind you it it's something in you God's got to move you to do that hey man remember 2015 Jose we spoke to that mountain of infertility and to two women got their babies they could have babies to him and got babies in 2015 because a king the word of the king there's power amen it's exactly right Jesus said speak the word we've got to speak the word and now remember what the Bible said I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me let's say together ready I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me amen we've got to say that more when things get hard we've got to say that out loud I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me amen you cannot question the king you've got to keep the command of the king in fear no evil hallelujah now let's go down to verse it's here because every purpose there is time and judgment therefore the misery of man is great upon him and look with this guy's look at Solomon I love Solomon but listen Church he wasn't born again and so we've got to be careful how we read Ecclesiastes if we're not careful we'll just have a complex against every woman well saman couldn't find one out of a thousand what about you judging women now you're the evil one right Lydia like that one there amen see that makes you self-righteousness see there's not even all these women can't even at my job they don't even treat me good well it's probably because you've got an awful attitude on you the attitude on you probably jumped on them or vice versa exactly right but see look what he says he says man it has great misery because he knows all things will come into God's judgment a church I don't know about you that sounds like a pretty depressed King brother hey man my life is just filled with misery because I know all my works are gonna come into God's judgement why would you be miserable as a Christian this man says every man is miserable because he knows God's going to judge him but then the Bible says in the New Testament that we should have joy unspeakable and full of glory amen Solomon saying is all miserable thinking about the judgments of God but then Paul says I can't wait to be offered he said because I've got a crown of righteousness waiting there for me praise God amen hallelujah he said in Paul said Jesus will show himself to all those that love his appearing so Solomon sees and men are filled with misery when they when they meet God but Paul's saying oh when you see Jesus you'll love him because you'll be like Jim amen you see this this is written by a man who is back slit and God was angry with him of course he's going to be miserable thinking about the day of judgment because God's angry with him but the Bible says Christians have peace with God through the blood of Jesus Christ in other words you say God forgive me when that evil deal forgive me when I said that forgive me when I hate that person forgive me when I mystery that and you really mean it when you say that the blood washes all your sins away and you'll not answer for that day man Laurie and if you repeat a little that there's a crown of righteousness waiting for you that the Lord Himself will give you because you fought the good fight you've won the war you've run the race and God's going to give you a crown of righteousness amen every time Aaron talks about somebody died and they're happy right FF Bosworth he was happy Paul Rader he was happy he said this is my coronation day this is my crowning day in other words lower amen he wasn't scared to meet God because he knew the blood of Jesus Christ forgave them of all sins so should we know that today the blood forgives us of all of our transgressions if not it's time to talk to Jesus after church there's an altar right here if you knew that your seat or dude here your choice but you better talk to Jesus and make it right amen amen glory that's what the Word of God says no more on Sunday night but the RAM said you are not saved because you feel safe and many times I don't feel safe I'm saying because I've met God's requirements Amen I'm saying because God's Word cannot fail and I've met the requirements of God's Word so no matter what I feel I'm saved because God promised they men and God will not break his promise amen hallelujah there's misery so he's so depressed there's misery on every man all life is so miserable because God's gonna judge me you should have felt like that if you done the thing Solomon did you good feel like that if you let a thousand demons into your life if you built if you fill up your home instead of the things with God and you filled your home up with Hollywood or something like that yeah you ought to fear God on the day of judgment but if the blood of Jesus Christ has so cleanse your heart and your motives and your objectives and your thoughts that now you let that wisdom flow out of you - cleans out your natural house - cleans out the things in your car still cleans out the things in your office now you're getting closer to God and you have no fear on Judgment Day it's exactly right oh ho thank you Jesus amen glory that's the give her seven I'm sorry please ask these eight verse let me go back and we'll go back to verse 6 because every purpose there was time and judgment there for the misery of man is great upon him Church I don't live on ms i don't live a life full of misery to you if you do you've got to let that load of sin off you've got to lay it down at the cross of Jesus Christ if life it's miserable and you know you got all these sins bound upon you then you've come to the right place this morning a man you come to the right place because Jesus is inviting all of us to lay down our sins confess your faults one to another then lay hands on them and pray for them and God shall forgive oh hey man glory that's the way God brings his children into the kingdom of God it's exactly right you're walking around with the miserable countenance it's time you got a new countenance the time you left there's the sunshine of God shine upon your face oh thank you Jesus I remember when I got mine holiday I was a new verse at Amen and the new countenance I'm a new outlook on life a new joy a new hope that nothing else could give me praise God verse 7 for he knows not which shall be for who can tell when it shall be see someone in misery they're always worried about how's it gonna end up when is it gonna happen or its word how and when how and when how and when but the Christians like it does it well the Christians like I know how God's gonna do it and I know when in God's time you may not know how you may not know when but he'll do it again a man there's a good song right there brakes God but the person would the midst of the person living in misery and under the burden of sin a backs to the condition or just housing where does it hop when we've gotta trust in the Living God Casta Bob says cast all your we just saying casts all your burdens casts are your misery on the Lord for he cares for you hey man hallelujah verse 8 there is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the Spirit sees much of those rich people want to try to pay the doctors to keep alive they're gonna be here they're not gonna be here on one second longer than God wants them to be neither happy power in the day of death and there's no discharge in that war oh well there is actually there's a resurrection brace God amen I'd say most the time there's no discharge in that war but Lazarus had a discharge Church all right with me death and death was keeping him for a while but I was suddeniy sir excuse me brothers I hear that I heard Jesus called my name excuse me I got to be discharged here I got to go back up there I go go back up to the other there is discharge from there why because there's voice of there's life in the voice of God there's life and the wisdom of God life from the mouth of Jesus call Youm come forth and one day he'll call all of us forth amen amen if we go down to the grave they'll call us all forth and we'll shall go to meet him in the meeting in the air Amen hallelujah because that's the unchanging Word of God hallelujah there's no discharge in that war neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to well that's true and that's that part's true now let me read this for mother baron from 1963 victory day he says it seems like the Christian life if the fellow is not absolutely centered on Christ the Christian life it seems like it holds so many disappointments praise God if you and I don't keep our lot balanced upon the Word of God if we don't let our life just be balanced on the word we get an off balance what's gonna happen if you don't say right on the middle of the row with the Word of God and get unbalanced life's gonna seem like so disappointing life is so miserable why am i I all mind well as might as well just end it it's so miserable Somnath end of his life so this is so miserable but Ron tells us when your life is not centered on the word you get miserable you get disappointed with life because you think you should be getting something else or something else should be happening the thing to do is Center your life on Christ so that you know you're standing and obeying every word of God then you have a place to stand then when the storms of life come you built your house upon a rock and those storms will make you depress those storms will take away your hope those thorns won't take away your joy because you're centered on the rock of God's Word amen pastoring has not been a disappointment by the Amen for the Aaron being a husband of seven children has not been a disappointment brother it's been a blessing praise God it's because I've centered my life on the Word of God that means everything at home is got to go through the word first if it breaks the Word of God if it has any sin in it it's got to go it cannot stay in my house because my house has to be centered on the Word of God I don't want to unbalance house where they're sitting there and then they're lightening to fly feels so disappointment Wow I regret this I should have did this I should have done that no Eve we were happy that we obey the Word of God amen now I better stop right there let me make let me make a note right here I'm stopping right here can I just say one more thing though about Solomon before we close or before we move on to this foundational thing this the thought just struck me yesterday now Church we hear so many things and it's true jesus said a greater than Solomon is here we hear always hear so many things about Saha Solomon was so great and Church he was at the beginning but not at the end the Bible says better is the end of a thing than the beginning of it so Solomon's walk is more important how he walked at the end of his life I think a sister Beatrice who has grandchildren now I think of my mother-in-law has grandchildren now there there there towards more towards the end of their life I'm almost 40 oh you know the Bible says you got I got 70 years so I'm over half way past my halfway point here but the end of our lives should look so grand or our lives should have such a testimony at the end the end should be better than the beginning praise God amen and we've got to make sure we don't get discouraged while we're on the way to the end and compromise on the word or or disobey the Word of God we've got to stay with the word we got to keep our revival as Jesus said we've got to keep him as our first love we've got a love church we got to love the way we go of Christians we gotta love God's Word more than anything else amen amen we've got to keep our first love the word has to be the thing we love the most amen and that was that's my testimony back then when I first started serving Jesus and that's my testimony now amen that the Word of God is our first love the end of the life is better than the beginning because you can look back and see the fruits of all your labors ha ha ha the end of the harvest season is better than the beginning and the church said my wife and children plant a lot of seeds at the beginning and they talk about all the weeding and all the hot and all things like that but I'll tell you the end of the end of the planting season is better than the beginning amen I see Malachi carrying the potatoes or see the girls carrying the peppers oh ma the end is better than the beginning so as Christians we can look back and say thank God that God saved me there thank God that God saved me there thank God that he provided there now I can see the fruits in my life look what God's accomplished look what he's done in me it was all his grace and now I'm ready for the harvest amen amen the end of it's better than the beginning amen and I know church that's going to be true for me the end of my life is going to be more powerful than the beginning because if God Terry I'll be to look back and say it's a good thing you didn't let that TV in your house with all the the Netflix and the rock and roll the good thing is paid tithes and offerings and put God first it's a good thing you always went to church more than the football games and basketball games hallelujah it's a good thing you didn't let your girls wear those sexy clothes and good thing to let maokai watch so sexy movie things like that it's going to be better at the end because I'll be able to see the fruits of love look you baptized for your hopefully all seven of your children hopefully now I'm looking ahead you know looking back right looking ahead then looking back all your children are serving God all your children look maybe your son's doing this maybe your daughter's doing this for the kingdom of God that's the that's that's what we want to see at the end we know n will be greater than the beginning praise God let me say this last thing that's what I couldn't can't even get to it Thank You Lord glory Solomon was so great in the eyes of men but then Jesus come around a thousand years late and he said I Got News for you he said you were not to see a prophet John the Baptist attea he was more than a prophet he said this is my messenger which was set before you to prepare the way of the Lord and he said no man born of a woman is greater than John the Baptist hallelujah why because some and just taught the wisdom of God for a few years he just got the wisdom but John hailed the word amen Solomon was hearing hearing the word thinking about the word thinking about the earth but John always thought about it he held it amen he held the Word of God and baptized him and then so the Holy Ghost has said can you imagine it must been right next to him right there imagine he's trembling at the presence of God nobody else there just kind of what time is it time to go they bee's been baptized some people holiday who's ready to go home and have some some lunch their John's Truman the greatest man born of woman greater than Solomon amen and he saw the Holy Ghost descending like a dove kuhu kuhu cool and the Bible said that abode anointed Jesus and remained on him Jesus went down he came up anointed with the Holy Ghost and now when Jesus walked out Larry said John didn't you baptize Jesus he said follow him over there may man the greatest man born a woman did not point to himself he pointed to Jesus Christ amen the anointed Jesus Christ the Anointed Messiah even grand Solomon a man because he handled that word that word was made flesh it wasn't just 3,000 proverbs it was a living proverb watch that the word was made flesh and dwelt among us Jesus was the Word made flesh and that made him greater than Solomon saman had 40 years as king John the Baptist had six months brother Jose haha and six months of ministry was greater than 40 years of ministry because of Solomon's backsliding the end of a thing is better than the beginning you might have started off serving God really good with Church we can't stop there we've got to keep serving God you got to keep your zeal what's you got to keep your hunger what's what's more enjoyable than the Word of God what's taking the place of the Word of God nothing should be more important than the Word of God amen so that thought struck me last night I went to bed I was the too tired to get up and write down I said Lord if you'll just remember I'm sorry you'll just remind me that tomorrow I'll preach that by your grace thanks for reminding me was that a blessing to you see some if we're not careful we have to put Solomon away above everybody else in fact if you're not careful you'll put Solomon above GE or brother branham or Jesus now no one's above Jesus but we hear Solomon was the wisest wisest wisest but in all reality John the Baptist was greater than Solomon because he handled the Word of God he prepared the way for the Messiah and how'd he do it by preaching against sin the hey man Laurie amen that's how he saw me he became greater he lived what he preached he lived what he preached all right give me 50 let me just do 15 minutes I've already preached 45 minutes just give me 15 minutes let me sister Tonya this gonna be for you okay all right sister Talia I apologize I've thought about having Bible studies with you too most more slowly teach these things but I just forgot about it so please forgive me let's just take a few moments here and I'll show you in the scripture some of our beliefs okay is that all right sister Lord bless you praise God and we all know it's God that brought you here remember God even healed our sisters good had trouble raising her arm and we prayed for we bound that devil and loser from that devil and your arms okay is that right sister oh yeah praise the Lord amen God is healing people in our midst not only physically but spiritually amen and only Jesus can do a church now we're giving all the glory to Jesus amen will tell of his wonderful love we'll give him all the glory to Jesus and tell this wonderful love so it runs to sixteen I just want to read it so our sister Tanya knows this but if you haven't heard this lately I hope you'll I hope you'll grab on to it and not let it leave your heart alright so Romans 2:16 now who can read that for me what is someone like to read that out loud for me amen here we roll out Romans 2:16 now leave out there Lydia now sister Tanya the most one of the most important things I'd ever like to start with with you is that Paul said each one of us will be judged by what's written in this book we might have secrets that we hide from people and we just wouldn't tell them and that's fine I mean now if we've sinned against somebody we need to go tell them that if we really hurt somebody we that we can't we shouldn't keep that a secret but maybe there's things we've done we're so ashamed of we don't have to really share those secrets but we've got to confess it to Jesus Christ say Lord I'm sorry forgive me help me to never do that again because listen we're all gonna stand before the judgment seat and the judge is gonna have this book open and they'll say Jesse Smith I'll say yes sir you know the angel Lord you know you're here to answer for all the work she did on this earth and I'll say yes sir and you say I'm judging you by the gospel that you preached amen and we were all sister we all have to stand there and Jesus Christ is going to judge us by what Paul wrote because the Bible says that Jesus Christ gave it to Paul let's read that Galatians one Lydia pulled up I believe this Galatians 1 12 I know it's right around there I may have miss corded it that's quite a statement a lot of people don't know that but we're gonna be judged by this Bible that's why I want to preach verse by verse I don't leave out any verses praise it hard I want to preach every single one that I can okay so Paul says neither received it I am man neither was I taught it but by revelation of Jesus Christ so Paul said my letters didn't come from my thoughts Jesus Christ met me in a vision and he told me what to write and I'm writing it unto you and then he told the Romans he said God will judge the secret of your hearts by the gospel which I preached because it was Jesus Christ gospel so sister that's why that's why if the Bible says it we believe it and everything we believe is from the Bible there's nothing I preach by the grace of God that's not in this Bible that's always been our stance go to Ephesians 4:5 let me put it up here Ephesians 4:5 just just I just want to lay this in here and of course sister Tonya at anytime if you have any questions feel free to text me you know we can talk about it for church heathens four five one Lord one faith one baptism there is only one faith there's only one and it's not the Catholic faith it's not the Lutheran it's not the Methodist it's not even the Branham faith it's the Jesus faith right cuz William Bram's not God he was just a prophet of God there's only one faith that's the faith of Christ Paul said the life I live I live by the faith of Jesus Christ amen amen in other words sister there's only one way to believe the Bible and that's Jesus's interpretation of it not a denomination interpretation it's not my interpretation of it it's God's own interpretation of his words so that's the next thing I'm gonna lay down there we're all gonna be judged by the word there's only one way to understand there's not two ways there's only one way the next thing is about God God is only one person Hebrews 1 verse 3 let's read em God is not three persons and there is not one scripture in the Bible that says God is three persons that was actually coined the term Trinity was coined two hundred years after the last apostle died the word Trinity is not in the Bible nor is the definition God never said here o Israel I'm one of three persons God never said that would be silly if he did right the Bible says in the Old Testament that God says in Isaiah he said I am the only god there's none beside me the Bible says there's one Savior there Bible says there's no Savior beside me Hebrews 1:3 now I'm gonna skip down here I'm sorry no here this Jesus who Jesus being the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person so Jesus is the image of the invisible God that we will never see God's invisible sphere unless it becomes like a vision to us so because God's invisible he had to make himself a mask he had to hide behind a mask he had to make himself an image and that image that he built for himself so he could be seen was his son Jesus Christ now that that that son is not a different person than him that son is the same person it just has different attributes for example the body's flesh but the Spirit is spirit but that doesn't make him a section for a separate person it's a different manifestation and again listen if everybody can listen three persons is not in the Bible how to turn Tarun email me last week and I did it real nice as I always do but I said please show me one verse it says God three person they said polished Holy Ghost I said that doesn't say three persons that verse says there's one name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost ten days later Peter used that name he baptized them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus staying right there said Peter don't baptize them in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost he said praise the Lord I will he went down there he started praying ten days later he got the Holy Ghost and he said let me baptize somebody I'm gonna baptize you in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost I'm gonna baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ hey man boring there's not one scripture in the Bible where anyone who's ever baptized with or sprinkled like the some Catholics do or Lutheran's or Methodists whoever does it there's no sprinkling the Bible there's nothing there's none in the Bible that's a perversion that's not that's not right now I'm not condemning them but I'm saying it's wrong teaching there's nothing in the Bible about that so there's one name to the father's and Holy Ghost that's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so the the term Trinity and three persons was two hundred years after John died Saint John so what what the churches have done sister Tonya these denominational churches that believe in Trinity they have attacked they have actually exalted the the false doctrine above the Bible writers and now they've got themselves into idolatry because you cannot have three separate persons you cannot have a separate person without having a different personality Jose's got a little bit different personality than me Aaron's got a lot different personality than me I'm just joking but mine's the bad window here's a good one you cannot have different personality without being a different person unless English has lost its meaning completely remember the Bible said this go to Lydia proverbs 30 verse five and six let's go here this is these are the simple scriptures I've I've been emailing these Trinitarians which I pray for them I love them you know I was a Trinitarian until I knew better so you'll never you never hear say Blessed Trinity er cuz that's not in the Bible there's no such thing as a Trinity of gods that's not in the Bible so look at this every word of God is pure he's a Shield of them that put their trust him next verse the Bible says do not add to his words if you add and column three persons God's gonna reprove you he's gonna correct you and you're gonna be called a liar the Bible writers never said God is three persons so Trinitarians they just willingly add to the Bible it's kinda like this like it's kind of like they do like this well God's Word is not enough so I've got to add my Trinity doctrine in here look what they've done they just add it to the Word of God well God's gonna call them liars if they don't reap if they don't repent of that but that's what the Bible says I know that's harsh but that's true did you know there's lots of false false religions that have Trinities Hinduism has a trinity of the Braman there's Brahma Vishnu and Shiva and they're all three different persons but they're ultimately Braman that's a that's a pagan idea three persons as one god that's a pagan idea that's never in the scripture the Egyptian Trinity is called it's Amon but it's raw and Fatah all in one how many knew that the Babylonian Trinity has a Trinity as well it's got ninki later became Ishtar and then Enki and then Marduk all three persons one God that's pagan because there's not one God said I'm three persons there's you cannot add to God's Word nor take away from God's Word and there's more there's more there's more net all right go to Jude verse four Jude verse four let's go out let's move on that's that's basically the gist of that we could go on more and more but you'll never hear Holy Trinity here you'll never hear Blessed Trinity or anything like that because God never said I'm a Trinity of persons God said I am THE LORD thy God and I changed not he does not change he never was three persons now we know he has three manifestations just like me I'm a father I'm a husband I'm a pastor I'm a teacher I got a lot of role but I fill I got a lot of roles so do you oh grandma you know grandma mother sister I'm a brother I have all these men at all these roles but I'm still one person same thing with God God was a father he created the son to join him and God is the Holy Spirit God is the Holy Spirit they're not three separate they're one that's right and if you add to that then the Bible says God's gonna call you a liar to add to that so grace now this is Grace sister Tonya this is how we teach grace because the Bible says certain men will creep in the church they're gonna creep in reminds me of the Grinch Stole Christmas he creeps in there and who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men and what did these people do they turn the grace of God into lasciviousness what is lasciviousness lasciviousness is lawlessness or in other words a license for immorality so sister Tonya true grace is God's unmerited favor to us but that does not give us the right to continue living in sin it means it's it it by God's favor forgives us all of our sin but then expects us to lovingly walk in obedience afterwards because we hate sin so much we don't want anything to do with it because of that great gift of grace that's but see churches there so you're saved you can still be homosexual you can still marry as many times as you want you can still cuss smoke drink do drugs get drunk you can still do all these things they make grace a light as long as you come to my church and pay money I'm okay with that I'll tell you no we're not okay with that here if you're not going to keep God's Word I'm gonna pray God a movie out of the church and you know God will do it because you've seen it amen I've seen it we do not want leaven among us we want to be a unleavened body of believers amen we want to be a group that has no sin among us so then God can heal our sick God can save our lost God can minister in our lives God can do whatever you want to do because there's all 11 out of our house amen so see that's what we believe out grace grace is God's total favor to us as sinners but we cannot say well because I'm forgiven well I can really drunk now I'll really go for indicate now because I've got grace I'm going to heaven no you haven't actually received grace yet you need to go back to Calvary because you never went there in the first place all right let me just do let me set a timer here ten more minutes okay everybody take a deep breath I don't know where yeah the first thing you notice about our our church though is probably the way we dress okay so let's go to first Timothy 2:9 it is an absolute Bible command that we dress modestly and the Bible defines areas of our body that we should show and errors we should not show oh that's what my books about my books all ready to go I'm just waiting on the on the designer she's real busy it's all ready to go I've got the work cited page done I have comb through that book time and time again brother brother van I got 42 thousand words I've read that thing so many times I'm tired of reading it I'm gonna read it one more time because John wants it on audio I'm gonna read my book one more time first Timothy 2 to 9 there we go Lydia so sister Tanya this is why we asked the women and the men you'll see me walking around here showing off my body parts either no women and men but this specifically speaks the woman Paul says in the manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel now modest means not drawing attention to yourselves with shaped face honest that's being a saint you know just shameful realizing realizing how little we are thinking God is great and thinking that we're a little and sobriety's seriousness not with broided hair because in those days they could pay hundreds of or they can pay all kinds of money to get fancy hairdos and gold Imperials and cost the array so see the Bible commands it and remember this is the same man brothers sisters that said you're gonna be judged by my by my gospel on the day of on the day of judgment Jesus Christ will judge all the women in America and of course all the other nations by this right here they're gonna be judged did you wear modest clothes or not because my Bible commands you to wear it now women that's really the main one right because most men don't walk around near half-naked but women in America walk they if they're not saying they they show off their breasts they show off their thighs their bottoms they show off all kinds of parts that they should not show off is that right Church and the Bible tells us what to cover and I just in my book I just did a rule you got to cover from your shoulder down to your shins now that can even me right here right at the top of your shin but the Bible says in Isaiah 47 if you show your thigh this is nakedness see God God gives us the dress code and the church said the Bible does have a dress code just like schools have a dress code just like funeral homes will have a dress code right even Envy I saw in the news even MBA games have a dress code one of the women tried to walk into a game recently dressed like one of the dancers and all kinds of immoral clothes and they kicked her out even they got dress codes who would have thought about that everybody has dress codes so God has a dress code hey man that's why you won't see me showing off shorts and showing off my that's why I don't take off my shirt anymore I used to be I don't do that anymore cuz I don't wanna not that it would but you know I don't want to cause anybody to stumble I don't want women to lust or a man if they're homosexual I want them to lust after me I want to be modest like the Bible says to be modest I go to first Corinthians 11 I got a few more minutes and again I'm open at any time that's why I put on the website put everywhere I tell my friends I put on Facebook if I've ever done anything wrong I've taught anything wrong somebody come correct me with the Word of God and I've never had anybody correct me with the Word of God now that doesn't make me anything that just makes the Word of God something first Corinthians 11 now this is where the Bible says a woman should not cut her hair and a man should not grow his hair long though Jesus did not have dreadlocks like some people want to say Jesus had these dreadlocks hanging down that's nonsense that's nonsense the Bible says ashamed in those days they would take it like this from what I've read in the Almanac the men would take it like this just real quick they'd take a knife and just cut it and it'll just kind of hang down here at the bottom of their neck maybe top of their shoulders when it got really long but a woman never cut her hair in the Bible and this is what I put that challenge out there for all these years can anyone ever show me one godly woman the Bible that cut her hair you'll never find it there's not one in the entire Bible I've searched I've read that thing I've read the Bible that beautiful thing how decisions I think I've read that glorious I read this book four or five times now our families read the whole thing Malachi Lee did you ever see where God told a godly woman to cut her hair no because woman when her hair's long it represents that she's under all the authority of her husband right and if she cuts it it's a dishonor she's saying I don't have to be under your headship I wanted to be on your leadership I can I can lead myself but God said the woman has to submit to the husband okay let's read it first Corinthians 11 that's why sister Tonya you'll see all the women that we have you know as long as God will let their hair grow right you know either whenever's in your DNA you just let it grow as long as you can God's not looking for three feet 16 inches 12 God's just looking for uncut for sisters and for men it better be cut no men don't walk in here like you're a woman I'm gonna pull you aside and say you know you need to cut your hair sir you're starting to look like a woman you starting look like your wife that's true that's true I did tell one of the brothers I just helped one of the brothers about that yeah yeah you have to do that because that's what the Bible says so God and that's why we'll get to this one next but that's why women have to wear dresses too in our society at least in America instantly when when someone looks at you they should be able to tell a man or a woman by your hair and by your outward clothing if not confusion sets in and now we've got people emailing me from UK oh and the guys pleading with me what do I tell my wife she thinks that she thinks God's puts male spirits and females and puts female spirits in men's bodies I say God would never do such a thing is that God would never do that God is not the author of confusion that's nonsense use got look at your body that will tell you what you are that's a pretty good clue right look at this first cousins 11 I never even said it today look at verse 13 now if you read all the chapter those sister Tanya you'll see that the Bible says is a shame for a woman to cut her hair and then prophesy speak in tongues or even pray look at verse 13 judge in yourselves is it calmly or is it fitting that a woman pray to God uncovered that means with cut hair is it right for a woman to pray with cut hair next verse doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair isn't a shame unto him so what does Paul say don't you know it's wrong for a woman to cut her hair and try to pray to God the Bible says nature itself teaches you that it's a shame for men to have long hair well how does nature teach you that 40 percent of men go bald I looked it up I looked it up you can look it up I'll send you the link is from BTech Britannica so almost 1 out of every 2 men after a while has no hair huh this must be speaking something to me like God wants men to have short hair that's what the Bible says nature the nature of man 1 huh - almost it's for him to lose his hair I sure hope mine don't lose very soon here ha ha it's a shame a man walks are around here with uncut hair shame on that man he looks like a woman next verse but if a woman have long hair now this long means uncut I can prove it down later in the verse it is a glory to her so see when we see our sisters here with is this long uncut hair that's a that's a particular kind of glory in other words there there being the image that God wants them to actually be they and it's a glory in the sight of God God says ma that's a true female right there that female is truly manifesting God's Word see for her hair is given her for a covering not a cap I appreciate the Mennonite women who never cut their hair you know and the Amish women that wear the caps the Bible don't say a cap is your covering the Bible said the hair is your covering but a cap won't send you to hell we know that you know we know that the cap won't send somebody to help it's probably like a area of Liberty verse 16 look what the Bible says but see if any man seem to be contentious we don't have it we have no such this means other we have no other custom neither do the Churches of God if people are gonna argue about this we don't have any other custom men need to cut their hair women need to let it grow uncut we have another customer the NIV says we have no other practice and neither do the Churches of God that makes it a little more clear in more modern terms of course that Bible has a lot of works missing and there they'll be judged for that but they did translate that one right of all the ones they missed they did practice they didn't do that one right Oh Deuteronomy 22:5 let's close with that one you're let's say to our feet you've been you've been a very patient audience thank you Wow hour and 15 minutes thank you thank you dude army twenty to five now now try to answer this the best I can this is why we asked women to wear skirts and men wear pants okay the Bible says that the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment I notice it doesn't say robes doesn't say pants it doesn't say skirts it just says whatever garments are men's garments women should not wear them whatever garments are women's men should not wear them so in the days that this is Moses of course for all that do so are an abomination to LORD thy God so in Moses day men had robes of course and their robes went a little bit past their knees according what I've read womens went all the way to the ground so women's garments actually rubbed against the ground from what I've read and then and also had bigger girdles I mean there was things about their outfits that were told you could tell right away okay this is woman or man can tell right away there's also different styles okay so maybe they're made of different materials different colors so in the days of Moses you could look right away and say okay that's a man that's a woman plus you had their out you had their arter garments and then also had their hair could tell - woman's hair was really long men's was cut short now remember Jesus the Bible said Jesus never sinned one time so that means Jesus never wore women's clothes never Jesus preached the New Testament with men's robes men's garments and then this is important cross-dressing in his abomination and that's why even though this is in the Old Testament it still applies in the New Testament because homosexuality was an abomination so his bestiality all those things were abominations in the old and they still remain abomination than the new okay and I've done his history I that's what my book I have a whole chapter on the history in my book it's chapter 6 and Americans honored know cross-dressing into the 40s 50s and 60s I'm a teacher and I get magazines they sent me a magazine my second year teaching they said women can never wear pants in schools until 1970 and they had matching suits their jacket had to match their pants and people used to preachers used to preach it they used to preach it we should have separate garments so our country now let's see what see what they did they started cross-dressing they started letting the hippies grow hair like women they start experimenting with drugs and sexuality and now what do we got now all these years later we got people that don't even know if they're male they went to all kinds of perverted men want to walk in women's restrooms what is wrong with these people they're filled with demons but the seeds of that was planted back here in the 40s 50s 60s when they started letting the when women cross dress Levi's did not open up a division of pants until nineteen viii praise God you could a woman had to have just borrow a pair of man's pants before that never understand now so that's why we believe some of these things and everything we believe of course it's right in here God's Word because I know sister Tonya on that day I've got an answer for what this Bible says the secrets of my heart will be judged by Jesus Christ according to Paul's gospel and so I want a life I want to don't you Church don't you want to live a life that pleases God don't you want to obey every word of God in the Bible now we can get to makeup makeup is three times in the Bible makeups condemned you know bless my mother's heart the children not we're talking remember we were talking to my mom about makeup and she said I said mom I said can I show you the three scriptures and remember that I said it real nice I said mom can I show you the three scriptures in the Bible that talk about women not wearing makeup and she said all we're not going to talk about that I said come on mom you go to church and you don't want to read the Bible Church what are we gonna be judged by right here right here American women never wore makeup to the 1920s during the Roaring Twenties when they started cutting their hair with bobbed hair started smoking cigarettes started drinking carousing all kinds of evil things now not all the women thank God for the I'm not bashing women I'm just saying God Satan anointed some of those women to break the word of God and all these years later we forget oh but sooner they're gonna remember the Word of God and they're not just gonna remember it they're gonna keep it amen we're gonna keep God's Word the sister will be happy to do some more maybe next Sunday Lord willing I'll take the last few minutes and I'll just share a few of our our beliefs and at any time you can text me any question is that help sister Tonya alright praise the Lord how many love the Lord today Amen let's have our musicians come here so thankful the wisdom of God icing that we we fear though we feel the way of the Lord or we somebody we choose the fear of the Lord Amen that's right I choose the fear I choose the way I choose all of Jesus safety all of Jesus now hope everything was understood this this I think I think the only thing that might have been misunderstood was Ecclesiastes 7 but personal Church I don't see more women that are sinners than men I see both I see equal I could be wrong on that but I don't want men in our church to take this as like we're better than women you're not on the plain of God we're all level I thank God for our sisters in this church that'll shout in the spirit or speak in tongues raise their hands that glorify God I thank God for systems like that who did Jesus show the resurrection first man or woman woman a woman that had seven demons cast out by Jesus amen a woman who been washed by Jesus amen that's we showed the resurrection to first so brothers I just don't want I just don't want our brothers being exhausted I want to be I don't ever think I'm better or God loves me more than a woman that's not right he doesn't God loves all his children the same just like me I don't think Malachi more than my girls although I got a lot more girls I don't get Malachi special treatment I love all night chill PC I know who sent them to me the Lord Jesus Christ they're all his really I just got him brother amen for a few years but I got these arrows for a few years and I've got a modem and I've got to teach him to read this Bible Andre so that when they're older they can take down Satan's influence they can destroy Satan's Kingdom somehow because the Bible said Jesus was manifest to destroy the works of the death that's all I've tried to do my dart life is destroyed the works of Satan my life and other people's lives how do I do that by saying read the Bible what does the Bible say about baptism what does it say about got it what to say about holiness modesty what to say about the power of God miracles we can believe everything we can hang our souls on every word of God in this time [Music] [Music] we choose the word [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

you I want to fear that God that wrote this Bible and I want to submit everything in my life to the holy God who wrote this Bible so no I'm gonna have to answer for I don't want to add to this Bible I don't take anything away I just want to be in the word all the way just keep praying playing that let's just pray for a bit [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
