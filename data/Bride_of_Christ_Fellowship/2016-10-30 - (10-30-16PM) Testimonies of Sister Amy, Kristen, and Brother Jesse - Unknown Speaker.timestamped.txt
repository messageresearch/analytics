[18:01] percent of my family believes a message
[18:02] to I'm very blessed with many people to
[18:05] look to for advice prayer
[18:07] encouragement or scripture in sight when
[18:11] I was 12 I wasn't really interested in
[18:13] going to church to listen to the
[18:15] preaching I went because I had to I love
[18:18] seeing everyone to in February 2006 when
[18:21] I was 12 years old my family was an
[18:23] accident my mom and I were the only two
[18:26] hurt which was a miracle because either
[18:28] my brother or my sister had their
[18:30] seatbelts on while my parents and I did
[18:34] and it meant two seconds later my
[18:36] brother would have been thrown from the
[18:38] van and possibly killed but he went
[18:40] unscathed thank the Lord man my mama
[18:44] hurt her wrist and I hit my Hannah on
[18:45] the lock of the door and it went into my
[18:48] head right above my eye which was
[18:51] another miracle that it missed my my my
[18:54] mom and I went into the house and I no
[18:56] idea how badly I've been hurt whether it
[18:58] was really bad or not I was totally calm
[19:00] I was actually calling me my mom dad
[19:03] then I went and looked in the mirror
[19:05] realized it could be pretty bad but with
[19:08] the Lord's help I stayed called
[19:10] as i was looking into the mirror
[19:13] with fear in my heart I told God that if
[19:16] he spared my life I would testify about
[19:17] how he saved my life
[19:19] she said to my shame has taken ten years
[19:22] of sherry
[19:24] Lester turned out that it was just a
[19:27] superficial wound and all I needed was a
[19:29] whole 12 stitches
[19:31] after that something change in my heart
[19:33] I started looking forward to going to
[19:35] church more than just hanging out with
[19:37] my friends and family I had a longing
[19:40] inside at first I wasn't sure what it
[19:42] was it might sound silly but I thought
[19:44] was just craving a certain food or drink
[19:47] eventually I realized it was my need for
[19:49] God in my life
[19:51] it was may of 2006 but my family was
[19:54] coming over for a Memorial Day picnic my
[19:57] grandparents were up and I wanted my
[19:58] grandpa to baptize me I wrote a note to
[20:01] my dad saying I want to be baptized and
[20:03] left it beside him because he was taken
[20:05] in that that evening with most of my
[20:07] family present my grandpa dad baptized
[20:10] me in a creek down the road from our
[20:12] house for a while after that I was on
[20:14] cloud nine nothing bothered me not even
[20:16] my siblings
[20:18] been the trial started because of my
[20:21] previous hurts in life I grew very hard
[20:23] and very cold and distant from God
[20:25] wasn't until I was 17 that I started to
[20:27] get serious about God at that time I
[20:30] worked on a dairy farm but I didn't
[20:31] realize it but there was black mold
[20:33] everywhere I started coughing a little
[20:35] dry cough and then it got worse and went
[20:37] to my chest I thought it was just a bug
[20:40] it would go away
[20:41] it had been about six months when
[20:43] brother Kenneth Walker came to Alby to
[20:45] preach I asked my dad if he would go
[20:48] with me into the office that brother
[20:49] Walker pray for me after brother Walker
[20:53] finished when I went to sit down for the
[20:55] service knowing I was healed after
[20:58] brother Walker finished praying for them
[21:00] I coughed sorry Les Mis fun
[21:07] since I coughed a dry cough maybe two
[21:10] more times and then it was totally gone
[21:12] within a matter of minutes a brainwave
[21:14] being prayed for I just finished my
[21:17] junior year in school that summer
[21:19] everyone in church and my family was
[21:20] talking about how they were going to
[21:21] start being homeschooled I want to be
[21:23] homeschooled so I started asking the
[21:25] Lord of he'd have me to stay in score be
[21:27] homeschooled there was so much profanity
[21:29] diversions and ensue innate in sua
[21:32] nations obviously
[21:34] insinuations thank you
[21:37] our brother branham see my wife is my
[21:39] correction
[21:41] they saw anything sure you might
[21:43] correction
[21:45] there are so much romantic perversions
[21:48] and insinuations that's it at school I
[21:51] constantly had mine battles
[21:54] surrounding what was said or done in
[21:56] school I really didn't feel as though I
[21:58] was being a little testimony of my
[21:59] classmates I never really testified any
[22:01] one and only really talked about what i
[22:03] believed is someone asked or if it was a
[22:05] topic of conversation class
[22:08] in august of 2011 brother Darrell Ward
[22:11] came to preach valving he was talking
[22:12] about how his elder sister was home
[22:14] school but his younger sister was in a
[22:16] public school like me then he said some
[22:19] people are meant to home-school but some
[22:20] are meant to be in school to be alight
[22:23] so I felt that the Lord was telling me
[22:25] to stay in school I did and graduated
[22:27] from
[22:28] 14 years into a public school at the
[22:31] time I was praying for a different job
[22:32] then in August had church someone
[22:34] mentioned a job on a horse farm I caught
[22:37] about the job at the position had been
[22:38] filled then about a month later in
[22:40] October I got a callback that the girl
[22:43] in the position could only work so many
[22:45] hours there was still an opening for
[22:47] someone after work more hours I started
[22:50] the beginning of november working four
[22:51] days a week I was extremely thankful for
[22:54] the job because I had so many perks that
[22:55] my first job I kept praying because I
[22:57] wanted more hours soon I started working
[23:00] five days a week and then six I've been
[23:02] truly blessed of this job and now I'm
[23:04] just on the supervisor
[23:06] I've been in many dangerous situations
[23:08] that work at got his kept me from
[23:09] getting seriously hurt every time from
[23:12] being kicked bit pinned and struck to
[23:16] being half run over and God is always
[23:17] kept me I've also had the opportunity
[23:19] with my boss about the word so 17 I
[23:23] started really seeking God desiring a
[23:24] Holy Ghost brother Jesse came to Albion
[23:27] for a sweetheart bakery in 2012 I
[23:29] believed I was 18 that son he preached
[23:32] on the Holy Ghost and I wanted to go up
[23:33] to the altar but Satan kept telling her
[23:35] I didn't need to go finally I couldn't
[23:37] stand it any longer it felt like
[23:39] something was pulling me up to the altar
[23:40] I know there bawling my eyes out Frank
[23:42] just asking the Lord for Holy Ghost a
[23:45] bench that I felt a piece that I
[23:47] received it when I would that I went up
[23:49] for
[23:51] there is okay the way I saw people
[23:54] immediately changed as I continued to
[23:57] kneel there and just praise the lord I
[23:58] could see the struggle on people's faces
[24:00] I can tell they wanted to come to the
[24:01] belt or two but they didn't after I went
[24:04] back to my seat no sooner had I done
[24:05] that the devil immediately tried to make
[24:07] me start doubting what I adjust test
[24:12] fight
[24:14] so I lost my study
[24:19] yeah I just bow my head and prayed and
[24:22] asked the Lord to vindicate it to me
[24:23] somehow i looked up brother jesse was
[24:26] either just about to pray for someone or
[24:27] just finished pray for someone I don't
[24:29] remember he looked at me and said sister
[24:31] do you feel different I said yes he said
[24:34] you look different I just started
[24:37] thanking the Lord again or what I now
[24:40] knew for sure what he had done for me
[24:42] since then I've had my share of Dallas
[24:44] trials and being lukewarm being raising
[24:46] the message brings a whole different
[24:48] kind of mine battles the devil tells you
[24:50] that you just believe because your
[24:51] parents told you or not if they want to
[24:54] wait you and quickly follow if you're
[24:56] always around your family and it's hard
[24:57] to decipher between or personal walk or
[24:59] if you're just hanging onto someone's
[25:01] your parents cocktails it's difficult to
[25:04] make sure you have your own individual
[25:05] relationship with God or the devil child
[25:08] of you there's no ways genuine because
[25:10] you had it too easy being raised the
[25:12] message and not going through what
[25:14] others had to go through at times you
[25:16] feel this injured in and go through the
[25:17] trials that others
[25:19] that others had to go through I'm sorry
[25:23] at times you feel that since you didn't
[25:26] go through the trials that others day
[25:27] bro came out of the world and maybe you
[25:29] don't appreciate God as much as they do
[25:31] he also tries to tell you that you
[25:33] believe it because that's what you were
[25:35] raised believing so you don't know
[25:37] anything different that if you learned
[25:40] about something else you might believe
[25:41] that over the message deep down God
[25:43] always gives me his assurance of himself
[25:46] and his love for me I hope this helps
[25:48] someone god bless sister Amy
[25:52] [Applause]
[26:20] song

[29:36] to me
[29:41] [Music]
[29:43] [Applause]
[29:48] why was we
[29:51] go into a bar in church so on my family
[29:55] is German Lutheran on both sides so it
[29:58] was art every Sunday religiously but it
[30:01] was religiously
[30:03] today so we were you know we're there my
[30:07] grandparents expected us there then we
[30:09] usually got together as a family
[30:10] afterwards but um
[30:13] how much about your the Lutheran's they
[30:15] like their beer and so we never saw the
[30:19] Christian life looking no that was a
[30:22] thing I thought you just went to church
[30:24] and you meant till they believe there
[30:25] was a God so then you got a freak us to
[30:27] heaven if I was really like five
[30:30] but our our church had summer school
[30:34] where six weeks 16 but your summer you
[30:37] went for catechism classes so we had to
[30:40] memorize
[30:41] parts of the Bible which is good because
[30:43] that stuck with me as I got older and
[30:45] then Luther's catechism so if you've
[30:47] ever read that like questions and
[30:49] answers with Martin Luther
[30:50] and I'm sorry is good you know but um
[30:53] but it was never really a reality but I
[30:56] was always thankful that at least I had
[30:57] some Bible knowledge because of that
[30:59] [Music]
[31:02] my like as a family we prayed the other
[31:05] before I kind of is like a ritual I'm
[31:08] usually prayed together before we went
[31:10] to bed all good but my dad is an
[31:14] alcoholic and was
[31:16] that was a big problem growing up and so
[31:19] he had angry outbursts this was what I
[31:22] just thought was a while I mean the dark
[31:24] involved in your life debnath come home
[31:26] after work and I didn't know any
[31:28] different I never saw like a godly
[31:32] family
[31:33] anything like that my parents ended up
[31:35] divorcing when I was in eighth grade and
[31:39] at the time I felt like that was the
[31:40] biggest lesson I could have so but my
[31:42] dad was out of the house
[31:44] and then you know acted out of course
[31:47] dealing with anger towards him and then
[31:51] even a replica see hatred
[31:54] because of that my mom was so her and
[31:59] she would talk to us girls about growing
[32:02] up to be an independent woman never rely
[32:04] on me half of everything because you
[32:06] know the man had totally failed her and
[32:09] so I had that in my head that I was
[32:11] going to being independent and you know
[32:13] cohabitate before we got married to make
[32:15] sure that nothing like that would happen
[32:17] to me and things like that and I'd never
[32:20] saw that going against anything up the
[32:22] church talk because church didn't teach
[32:24] any kind of sanctification so
[32:27] let's kind of my family background well
[32:29] but even this file that my mom was only
[32:31] good mom and I think the kiss she was
[32:34] a really good relationship with us and
[32:36] would talk with us and listen it
[32:39] probably kept me out of trouble that I
[32:41] could have potentially gotten in but I
[32:42] was never I never want to like the
[32:46] parties or anything and I don't know if
[32:48] it was just my friends didn't want to
[32:50] invite me because I didn't think I would
[32:51] drink or if God just protected me but
[32:54] they never invited me like my best
[32:55] friends would never invite you to their
[32:56] weekend activities and there's a time I
[32:58] was so hurt and I was back and I'm just
[33:01] thankful because
[33:02] grade my girlfriends are drinking on the
[33:05] weekends and their past guy alcohol and
[33:08] if they would have invited me I would
[33:10] have gone along with it who knows when I
[33:13] could have got started down but God kept
[33:15] me from it and so I was always thankful
[33:17] for that and as I got older now but I
[33:20] was in sports growing up and long jumped
[33:24] and track and hang and there was this
[33:28] boy on the track team who was also
[33:30] pretty good atlanta and so one year it
[33:34] was my freshman year and his junior year
[33:36] and we were practicing for the state
[33:39] meet at another school because our
[33:41] school didn't have good facilities and
[33:43] so we talked a little bit later that
[33:45] summer this boy he calls me on the phone
[33:46] and I was pretty excited
[33:52] he was mr. all-star athlete and
[33:55] everybody in the county beautiful
[33:58] northwest ohio area knew who he was and
[34:00] so my sister and i were just so excited
[34:03] because jesse yet told me on the phone
[34:05] and
[34:07] [Music]
[34:10] we did start you know seen each other
[34:12] than shortly later but neither of us he
[34:15] was raised in church he'll share that to
[34:16] you that neither of us ever talked about
[34:19] faith or anything like that like I
[34:21] didn't I was never into the party scene
[34:24] but we still like we're not in our
[34:26] Christian relationship or anything like
[34:28] we were pre nothing like that it was
[34:31] just a typical high school dating
[34:32] relationship when he after that year was
[34:34] going to happen for school I'm
[34:37] devastated I was so sad and I thought
[34:41] well I'll probably be denied a bit
[34:43] but we cover this relationship going for
[34:47] after that and then it was during my
[34:52] junior year of high school and his and
[34:56] whatever a first year in school here
[34:58] Akron I was invited by some French to go
[35:01] to a Christian rock concert and I I went
[35:05] to a lot of regular concerts on weekends
[35:08] with friends and so I said well how much
[35:11] is you know how much of a tickets I'm
[35:12] like no it's free you just come and oh
[35:15] thats fun a free concert so I went with
[35:18] them and he was going to something that
[35:19] weekend I didn't know what it was but
[35:23] this and even though it was a Christian
[35:26] rock band was in a small little
[35:29] cafe area and Toledo was a Toledo based
[35:32] band that thing went big national after
[35:34] that but when i was there
[35:37] they were towards the end then they
[35:39] started playing these like worship songs
[35:41] and i had never experienced anything
[35:44] like that like oh you know i just knew
[35:46] that on lutheran style church services
[35:49] were little surgical and I saw friends
[35:52] that have like their hands up I've never
[35:54] seen anybody do that before and I was
[35:58] just struck by something that like
[35:59] something is real to them that's not
[36:01] real to me and I don't know what they
[36:03] have but I want that and so even just in
[36:08] that simple way like I do nothing oh I
[36:11] just knew like I have to change and so
[36:14] that was I always look back at that and
[36:16] you know we know about like Christian
[36:19] rock and spirits that can go on with
[36:20] that but I always think about how
[36:22] brother branham said that God can use a
[36:23] penny in a penny way and God used that
[36:27] particular band in my life to take you
[36:30] one step closer and so on
[36:34] Sunday night when you you know have to
[36:36] just on the phone and I saw it you have
[36:38] to break up with him because I don't
[36:41] know much but I know this isn't going to
[36:42] work and I know so it's really nervous
[36:46] and we're talking for a little bit and I
[36:47] said well I need to tell you something
[36:50] some kind of important I need to talk to
[36:52] you that feels like okay I need to tell
[36:54] you something too okay I don't remember
[36:57] who won first but cups too much he went
[37:02] to a conference call with a group called
[37:04] athletes in action which is a Christian
[37:07] athletic group for college athletes and
[37:12] he went to one and he gave his heart to
[37:14] reward that weekend and I went to a
[37:17] fishing rod concert I knew my heart
[37:18] toward that weekend in our own little
[37:20] ways and so we were both about to tell
[37:22] each other what just happened thinking
[37:23] that I was still working and
[37:28] so I always look back at that is
[37:32] that just made a huge impression on you
[37:34] like that was the opportunity i was
[37:37] ready to break it off with him but God
[37:38] has ordained it but that wouldn't happen
[37:41] so on our relationship started changing
[37:44] a lot then and as we kind of worked
[37:46] through like what it is to be a
[37:47] Christian and um
[37:50] it was the time for me to decide what I
[37:52] was going to do after graduation I
[37:54] headed out flown to a school for track
[37:57] and looked at some other places and
[38:00] me and my big ambitions I thought I
[38:03] wanted to go to an Ivy League school and
[38:04] how different think that uh up in and
[38:06] Jesse did not want me to go that far
[38:09] away and
[38:12] started me to want to either so he was
[38:15] some here in Akron and I decided that I
[38:17] would go to Kent State so I could be a
[38:18] little bit closer to him but not be the
[38:19] exact same school
[38:21] then so I went there and
[38:25] we started talking after I've been here
[38:27] about getting married young and what
[38:28] that would look like if we should be
[38:30] good swing it in college and started
[38:32] talking to so much his friends who did
[38:34] because by that time you've been dating
[38:36] for three years and so laughs he was
[38:40] very nervous about if I'm not going to
[38:43] marry this girl I ever got whatever help
[38:46] because he was so attached and I didn't
[38:49] I understand that but you know it was
[38:51] God needing him
[38:53] but I was really involved with Campus
[38:56] Crusade for Christ if you're familiar
[38:58] with that college ministry that first
[39:00] year at school
[39:02] and
[39:03] it was really really involved there
[39:05] that's like her all my friends were
[39:08] so we had gone back over thanksgiving to
[39:11] visit our family and while we were gone
[39:14] consume our family well in the same area
[39:16] and
[39:17] Jesse had come back to talk to me about
[39:20] something things like I gotta tighten up
[39:22] I just did this I will study was Simon
[39:24] and he starts rattling off stuff like
[39:26] there's no Trinity and women she only
[39:28] wear skirts dad sent a prophet and he
[39:31] said something lesser concede and he
[39:32] just threw it all out of me and I was
[39:35] like oh my goodness he's getting into a
[39:37] cult and I was terrified and I was like
[39:40] oh
[39:42] you just said there's a Trinity
[39:46] so I was really really nervous about
[39:49] that he was so excited and all I kept I
[39:52] would arise i was thinking through and
[39:54] he would tell me things he's really
[39:56] writing about it he kind of question
[39:58] things that you kind of go back and
[40:00] forth and i
[40:02] had my back to how we both given our
[40:05] hearts Lord the same weekend oh god why
[40:08] that happened because I was ready to
[40:10] break up with him then why would you
[40:12] allow that and then bring us to this
[40:14] point where he starts getting into some
[40:16] crazy doctrines and now I got to figure
[40:19] all this out and so it was really hard
[40:21] on me well because I say it so seriously
[40:25] like I didn't want to be deceived and I
[40:28] wanted to know the truth but I didn't
[40:30] understand how it could be so exciting
[40:32] to him and it was so scary to me so uh
[40:36] that Christmas break
[40:38] we went to go do some bible study with
[40:41] brother Craig door
[40:43] you know we had my hair and at that time
[40:46] he was just doing bible studies and
[40:48] little services in his house and I
[40:50] thought he was very nice you know but I
[40:53] went on the internet and I printed out
[40:56] some proof that this man was not perfect
[40:58] and I had a stack of papers to
[41:02] him and time
[41:04] this and he's going to be scared right
[41:08] on and so I came in and when we sat down
[41:12] for the Bible study so I gave it to him
[41:14] and I just remembered him two papers and
[41:17] he was like I feel sorry for the better
[41:20] and I thought she's not scared okay no
[41:24] I'm proving him wrong he's not scared
[41:26] and that really made an impression he
[41:28] wasn't intimidated by what i thought was
[41:30] proving wrong
[41:33] so we went through and he would kind of
[41:35] explain things and had gone to a couple
[41:37] I think maybe one of the services here
[41:40] at his house on a Saturday night that
[41:42] girl was okay but I just was not
[41:45] convinced when I had way too many
[41:46] questions
[41:48] so now whole next semester I told my mom
[41:51] just a little bit about what was going
[41:53] on but not a whole lot and she was very
[41:55] alarmed and
[41:58] they same thing thinking like as soon as
[42:01] we heard the word prophet
[42:02] we just not called because about the
[42:05] stuff you know that you see for people
[42:08] who proclaim themselves to be Proctor
[42:09] itself sir um
[42:12] so she was really nervous about it
[42:14] because she knew how much I love Jesse
[42:16] and so she was afraid you know that I
[42:19] was just going to go with whatever he
[42:20] says because I liked him so much
[42:23] without lil next semester I just spent a
[42:25] lot of time myself like reading the
[42:27] Bible I read through the different bible
[42:30] studies that he had we would sit down
[42:32] and go through things I'd ask questions
[42:34] and an at Kent State they have a really
[42:37] large library and they have a whole
[42:40] area of like historical Christian books
[42:43] so I just went to library and I was
[42:46] pulling out history books and I was
[42:48] reading about church history and I
[42:50] wanted to see if the things that I've
[42:52] better brand I've talked about like with
[42:53] the torch ages and with the Catholic
[42:55] Church and these things could I find
[42:57] that same information elsewhere
[43:00] and so I would get out like versions of
[43:03] foxes Book of Martyrs from 18 windings
[43:05] and I was just reading them and it's all
[43:08] about the capture the whole thing and
[43:12] reading other books and just shocked
[43:15] that this is not lining up with what
[43:17] they're talking about even things like
[43:18] that is I'm like it was all there these
[43:20] books and so God knows how to work with
[43:24] each of us power I wired and so that was
[43:28] very important to me and
[43:30] I'm that earlier before that I had
[43:33] agreed to go with
[43:35] campus crusade for what they call summer
[43:37] projects which is like a
[43:39] stateside mission mission to kind of for
[43:43] the summer and so they send these
[43:45] college kids two different
[43:47] vacation areas with the idea that if
[43:51] there's so many people are traveling to
[43:53] this particular vacation area we have
[43:55] the impact to witness to a great number
[43:57] of people in one setting because
[43:59] different people are constantly coming
[44:00] in and out and so
[44:03] the leadership at Kent had wanted us all
[44:06] to go to this particular project in
[44:09] ocean city in New Jersey because that's
[44:11] where they sent the people who were
[44:13] going to become leaders within the
[44:15] crusade organization
[44:17] so I was going there and Henry such
[44:20] tremendous amount of money to go
[44:22] and then it's justin sharing all these
[44:24] things with me I was really questioning
[44:26] that decision and like I've already
[44:28] resolved money and I can't give it back
[44:31] because I don't even know who key what
[44:34] so there was no way for me to get this
[44:36] money back and I started to get really
[44:38] nervous about this trip because as we
[44:41] added Bible studies the scripture that
[44:43] kept like I kept thinking about was what
[44:46] happens if he preached another gospel
[44:48] than what Paul preached and I knew that
[44:50] what Campus Crusade was sharing I wasn't
[44:53] so sure that was the truth anymore
[44:55] verified that i would point somebody in
[44:58] the wrong direction
[44:59] so
[45:01] you know Jesse and I kept having bible
[45:04] studies i can't remember if I spent much
[45:05] more time with further creative over the
[45:07] brooks
[45:09] but towards the end of that semester I
[45:11] just from reading the Bible in history I
[45:13] knew that being baptized in the name of
[45:16] the Lord Jesus Christ was right and that
[45:18] things had been changed
[45:20] then I knew that but I didn't really
[45:22] like own it like I wanted to be baptized
[45:25] I just thought that's the right way but
[45:27] I didn't have it in me yet to want to do
[45:29] it and so as we would talk I
[45:32] eventually asked him you know just pray
[45:34] for me because I know it's right but I
[45:36] don't want to do able and I don't want
[45:39] to go do it just because I know it's
[45:40] right if I don't feel in my heart and so
[45:42] we prayed and whatever spirit was like
[45:44] holding me back it was it was gone next
[45:46] Stanley going to bed and in the morning
[45:48] I woke up it was clear and what I needed
[45:50] to do and
[45:51] on
[45:53] right before at school we were finishing
[45:55] up for the semester and the leader of
[45:57] the crusade group Garrett can't somebody
[46:01] take my college roommate when I told him
[46:04] kind of what was going on and so he he
[46:08] kind of met with me privately and it was
[46:10] asking about it and I knew so little of
[46:12] a message like I couldn't really explain
[46:13] it to him and what I did explain like
[46:17] looking back I wasn't exactly a riot I
[46:19] was just doing the dust based on what I
[46:20] knew but the one thing he said to me
[46:23] when like just talking about baptism
[46:25] because to me it was just like let me
[46:26] just figure this out first this is just
[46:29] a Bible thing when I can look at the
[46:30] Bible and see this and he said
[46:33] when you're talking about it he went
[46:36] home
[46:36] if Jesus says this and Peter says this I
[46:41] would certainly take the words of our
[46:42] water heater ah and I said no neither
[46:46] shaking my head if I just wanted a
[46:47] conversation hold on i'm just Lee didn't
[46:50] go talk to him because I already knew
[46:51] what he was going to tell me I want a
[46:53] god to tell me I didn't want anybody
[46:55] else would I didn't talk to a lot of
[46:57] people about it
[46:58] but that was Ida sighs that's as much
[47:02] understandings he has he's okay with the
[47:04] Bible contradicting itself and this is
[47:07] not somebody I can trust so that really
[47:09] solidified it for me there as far as him
[47:12] but after school then I did get baptized
[47:14] my mom came and
[47:18] my aunt who lived in the lineman area
[47:20] she came to and um I think she just
[47:24] wanted to be there because it was an
[47:26] important event
[47:27] but she didn't really support it so as
[47:31] soon as we started driving home
[47:33] simon and jess and then my mom and aunt
[47:37] you're driving back and my mom needed
[47:39] time yeah grilling and having questions
[47:42] or any way from the first one to ask but
[47:45] she was just I'm trying to understand
[47:46] why didn't you just say this Peter said
[47:49] this and you did it this way
[47:51] and Simon starts talking and my mom just
[47:55] one
[47:57] and I'm so frustrated because I I knew
[48:01] the life that was there and I love my my
[48:04] dear but I knew that she hadn't spent
[48:07] the time studying the Bible and the
[48:09] history on this like I had and so this
[48:12] was real to me and it frustrated me that
[48:14] people were dismissing it and they
[48:15] hadn't been
[48:19] so I just kind of you know let that go
[48:21] but I I had Reese all that money to go
[48:23] to New Jersey and I didn't want to go at
[48:26] that point I had no choice and I was
[48:29] just a nervous wreck about it but I went
[48:32] and I packed all skirts because I just
[48:36] didn't even want to wear other things
[48:39] but I still took along like modest
[48:42] savings
[48:44] because that I didn't have a full
[48:47] understanding wait more
[48:49] but so while i was there than you know
[48:53] Jesse and I were talked a lot and on our
[48:56] pay phones because I didn't have cell
[48:57] phones in so we'd be talking on a phone
[49:01] we didn't have email I don't think um
[49:04] and Heath I can't remember he mailed it
[49:07] to me or he sent it with to me a bunch
[49:09] of bible studies like printed off
[49:12] for me to just go through while i was
[49:14] there and i
[49:16] spent a lot of time by myself there were
[49:19] like 115 maybe other college kids we
[49:22] were all in this massive house through
[49:24] all kinds of fire codes
[49:26] we were just crammed in this place and
[49:30] on i spent as much time as i could by
[49:32] myself and I would just go by myself
[49:34] with my Bible
[49:46] if I told them what I'm thinking all and
[49:49] I felt so alone and I had to wrestle
[49:53] with that the whole summer and mom but
[49:56] God using such a tremendous way that I
[49:58] knew leaving that summer someone had
[50:01] asked me you know how it was for me this
[50:02] person had like on a bunch of these
[50:04] summer project trips and so this he just
[50:07] loved it this is what he did Hansen when
[50:10] I thought about it and I said it was the
[50:12] hardest summer of my life I would never
[50:14] want to go through this again i'm so
[50:16] glad i did it and he was didn't like
[50:20] and I just left it there i thought god
[50:22] knows what I need but it was the best
[50:24] thing for me because I was all by myself
[50:26] and I just read the Bible and I read
[50:30] through these bible studies and I live
[50:32] and I'm just crying out to God to give
[50:34] me direction because I'm even like
[50:36] coming off for this summer I needed to
[50:38] make a decision in I was either going to
[50:40] you know follow the message or I was
[50:42] going to stay in you know denominational
[50:45] Christianity water you know
[50:47] evangelicalism and go on with this
[50:50] particular organization and I'm either
[50:53] leaving it they would say I with her at
[50:55] a call they would say I wasn't false
[50:57] doctrine they would shun me they would
[51:00] potentially mock me and I would use all
[51:03] of my friends at school and on and that
[51:07] was hard to think about that already
[51:09] lost my old friends when I gave my heart
[51:10] solar the first time in high school and
[51:12] then I was going to lose them again and
[51:15] and I just didn't know what was right
[51:18] but through that summer I would I just
[51:22] started going down to the ocean by
[51:24] myself and I take my Bible and I just
[51:26] started reading through Psalms and I
[51:28] didn't know what I was reading forward
[51:30] and really have like an agenda I was
[51:32] just trying to read the Bible just her
[51:33] to get some direction and figure out
[51:35] what God wanted me to do and
[51:37] there was this one time i was there by
[51:40] myself and I got to solve 32
[51:43] and I was just reading and all of a
[51:45] sudden I hip verse 8 and it was just
[51:47] like the words came off of age and
[51:49] stared at me is that I won't start being
[51:52] teach thee and the way which thou shalt
[51:53] go I will guide me with my eye and I
[51:57] read that now you've got it sent me
[51:59] there that's someone so that he could be
[52:02] he gonna start to eat I wasn't out of
[52:04] this well and just keep walking because
[52:07] he had it all under control
[52:10] so I feel like that verse is my life
[52:13] worse you know because it just no matter
[52:16] what happened I just named like I just
[52:17] had to keep following the Lord and he
[52:20] was he was start seeing my stuff's
[52:22] enough and I really feel like from that
[52:24] moment on like the Bible changed and it
[52:26] wasn't just a book anymore with God
[52:28] talking to me
[52:30] so I would you know read those those
[52:32] studies and things and everything I was
[52:34] seeing with these friends and an
[52:37] acquaintance since there that were being
[52:39] supposedly really living for the Lord I
[52:41] would just look at things and think like
[52:43] that's not
[52:45] even just like basic modesty things the
[52:48] way the girls would dress after one of
[52:51] the young men had the courage to get up
[52:53] and ask them not to dress that way I
[52:55] just
[52:56] yes that um
[52:59] but that one sounds last time I ever
[53:01] work here shorts that was last time like
[53:04] does he talk to me about why I bathing
[53:05] suit event which I know it just seems
[53:07] like it should be so obvious but I
[53:09] didn't see it and he explained it to me
[53:12] it was like oh okay I get that then so
[53:16] God just really used it to change
[53:18] everything for me and he sent me the
[53:20] first sermon I ever listen to forever
[53:22] their brand I'm consent to be there he's
[53:25] that my marriage and divorce
[53:26] you never listen to marriage and divorce
[53:28] it's pretty good sermon to listen to the
[53:31] first one and it was honestly really
[53:33] hard for me to hear and I felt angry and
[53:36] hurt when I was done because he was
[53:40] preaching so hard against the women
[53:42] which now i understand wasn't reaching a
[53:44] christian but it was so hard for me to
[53:47] listen to because in my upbringing the
[53:50] one who caused the most hurt in my life
[53:51] was my father and so it was hard for me
[53:54] to hear that in all i could think of was
[53:56] what about what about the men that
[53:58] mistreat their lives and what about the
[54:00] men that drink too much and are invested
[54:01] in their children and live and their
[54:03] families and all these different things
[54:06] so now that was hard but it is area off
[54:09] so i'm going to talk to him later about
[54:13] it that when he told my brother Brooks
[54:14] and rather Craig that he sent me
[54:15] marriage and divorce
[54:17] they were like you sent her white if I
[54:21] knew I had listened to anything else
[54:22] that was the first turn inside the
[54:24] portal view of you know for the
[54:27] Brandon's teachings but he sent it
[54:29] because we were talking about getting
[54:32] married if that was the right thing for
[54:34] us um I don't think I listen to another
[54:37] one for a long oh
[54:39] but I decided towards into that summer
[54:42] then I would I didn't know what I was
[54:45] going to do but I wouldn't be a part of
[54:46] campus curse anymore and
[54:48] ants was one of the leaders they were
[54:51] about that in them she was really sweet
[54:54] about it but it was hard going through
[54:56] the rest of the summer with him because
[54:57] they were all planning what the new here
[54:59] would be and I just kind of staff
[55:00] meeting for Jenna thing he thinks I was
[55:02] too scared to tell anybody else
[55:06] I'm ended up getting from home n and had
[55:08] a few couple weeks maybe back at my
[55:11] mom's before going back to school for
[55:13] the fall semester
[55:15] and I had no idea that there was just a
[55:19] ton of stuff that had been going on in
[55:21] our hometown while I was away for the
[55:22] summer and so I got back and you know I
[55:27] had a skirt on and i was real tired from
[55:31] the flight so i was sleeping and my mom
[55:32] came and woke me up and she's likely
[55:34] need to talk I just had I said oh so
[55:38] girly she's like yes now so I sit up and
[55:41] she just laid into me about what I was
[55:44] getting myself into you and this being
[55:45] occult and you can't do this and tell me
[55:48] about all these things that happened
[55:50] this summer with other friends who had
[55:52] been baptized and recruiting school and
[55:55] here she had gone on the internet and
[55:57] looked up Bible believers com I think or
[56:02] something that is not affiliated with a
[56:04] message but because the the church that
[56:06] whether Isaiah was pastoring alignment
[56:08] is called Bible believers she thought
[56:10] that was the name of some denomination
[56:12] so she searched or she got on this
[56:14] website and she's reading all these
[56:16] things that really scared her and some
[56:20] of it was on like submission for women
[56:22] and because of her experience was very
[56:24] alarming
[56:26] and they took it to a certain extreme
[56:29] there was a lot gotta balance and so she
[56:31] was really worried she said that she
[56:34] thought that he was going to make me
[56:36] quit school get married and just not
[56:39] having as many babies as I could like
[56:40] that's what she gathered from this
[56:42] website and because I also refer
[56:44] experience it was really important to
[56:45] her than I graduated college because as
[56:48] a single mom she really struggled to
[56:50] support our family with our college
[56:51] degree so I had a full ride to school
[56:55] plus extra she didn't want to see me
[56:58] throw that away and she got Jesse was
[57:00] going to make me do that and so I was
[57:02] trying to talk her down from this like
[57:04] I'm still in school they pay me to go to
[57:06] school and acquitted it's a good job and
[57:09] she didn't believe me my aunt came in
[57:12] and started questioning me and my aunt
[57:13] said something about you know you just
[57:15] have to watch with groups like this
[57:17] because they'll take one Bible verse and
[57:19] take it out of context and that made me
[57:22] so frustrated because I felt like
[57:25] baptism thingy you know that that's the
[57:28] Trinitarian formula takes one scripture
[57:30] out of context and built a whole
[57:32] doctrine around it so much is frustrated
[57:35] me and I didn't like knowing that
[57:37] everybody thought I was doing this for
[57:40] Jesse and I knew I was didn't forgot but
[57:43] that was just something i just had to
[57:44] shrug my shoulders and deal with and
[57:45] know that people were going to say this
[57:46] about me there's nothing I could say to
[57:48] through the law
[57:50] my Christian friends from high school
[57:53] when they found out about it like they
[57:55] would talk to me to look at me they were
[57:57] very
[57:59] very rude they said really bad things
[58:01] about me
[58:03] others mocked me behind my back
[58:05] but I had one friend from high school
[58:08] that always stuck is so a really special
[58:10] friend and she doesn't really understand
[58:13] the message but whenever they were talk
[58:15] about him if she would stick up for me I
[58:17] was clean earthly appreciate those like
[58:19] that but the whole town was just
[58:21] panicked about a group of us
[58:25] coming to the message and
[58:26] Jessie might share more about it
[58:30] they've called like a council hug and
[58:33] different church leaders and their wives
[58:35] and bringing in those of us Simon was
[58:39] there Jessie sister Bessie some other
[58:42] people were all there and they were just
[58:44] going to question and my mom told me I
[58:46] needed to come back from school to go to
[58:48] this cuz she's thinking out they were
[58:50] talking out of it i just told her no and
[58:53] I stopped going home to visit my family
[58:55] I just got to be way too much
[58:58] but I knew what I saw in the lives of
[59:01] the believers and I knew what I saw my
[59:04] lines with everybody else and you know
[59:07] and I was away for the summer I thought
[59:08] if
[59:09] those people are you go the best actors
[59:12] in the world or they have something that
[59:14] other Christians still because that life
[59:16] is different so they couldn't you know
[59:19] they kind of talking out of it we've
[59:22] then got married the next summer and
[59:25] even there at our wedding like people
[59:27] were upset there was somebody sitting in
[59:30] the front row of our wedding who was
[59:31] this man slouched down in a seat he had
[59:34] his arms folded and he was like this
[59:37] whole way through our wedding ceremony
[59:41] site is that will
[59:44] they will yeah they were mad at you i
[59:47] could see different people we need from
[59:49] growing up that are whispering back and
[59:51] forth but i knew it was right and I knew
[59:54] they didn't understand and I wasn't
[59:55] upset
[59:56] but just shows your shoulders a new on
[59:59] so
[1:00:01] so by then we were going to church there
[1:00:04] in Lima and married and
[1:00:08] still dealt with my issues for my my mom
[1:00:12] and different people
[1:00:14] for maybe another a few years like when
[1:00:17] we would go back and visit you know
[1:00:19] comments would be made
[1:00:21] and that was always hard but you know
[1:00:24] how it is like I think most of us
[1:00:26] understand how that is a feeling i'll
[1:00:28] also just try to love them and pray form
[1:00:30] i'd always offer like could we do a
[1:00:33] bible study just so i can show you now
[1:00:35] i'm not trying to convince you i just
[1:00:36] want to show you that there are Bible
[1:00:38] verses that I believe support this and
[1:00:41] everybody would just say no and so that
[1:00:44] was hard but
[1:00:46] then when Lydia and I was finishing up
[1:00:51] College right then so I found I was
[1:00:54] graduating early I had her graduated two
[1:00:57] weeks later um but it was such a big
[1:01:00] change to go from I was like
[1:01:04] full-time you know student was student
[1:01:06] teaching and I was doing an honors
[1:01:08] thesis and so just had a lot going on
[1:01:11] and then to go from that to just caring
[1:01:14] for this baby my mom wasn't there to
[1:01:16] help because she just changed jobs and
[1:01:17] didn't have any vacation time and
[1:01:20] I didn't realize it at the time and I
[1:01:23] think I have postpartum depression and
[1:01:26] it was really hard I just cried every
[1:01:28] single day I was all by myself I was so
[1:01:31] overwhelmed I didn't know what to do
[1:01:33] with a baby I babysat children I didn't
[1:01:36] know what to do with my home she cried a
[1:01:38] lot and I just felt so alone Anna what
[1:01:43] really scared me was I had a really bad
[1:01:45] dream
[1:01:46] and I woke up and I was afraid that I'd
[1:01:49] hurt her and let's sleep and I knew like
[1:01:52] this more than me and so I went up for
[1:01:56] prayer then the next day because it was
[1:01:59] a Sunday and um I just confessed like
[1:02:03] I'm really having a hard time and
[1:02:06] Robertson big for me and it so I've been
[1:02:09] like two weeks with that and it was just
[1:02:11] gone on the next day like all the
[1:02:13] anxiety and the depression and
[1:02:15] everything like it lets it i was still
[1:02:16] overwhelmed but i wasn't like depressed
[1:02:19] anymore and an anxious like that
[1:02:23] another testimony from that was i had a
[1:02:26] real hard time adjusting to not having
[1:02:29] time to like read my Bible and pray
[1:02:30] whenever I wanted so when the brothers
[1:02:32] would preach about you know Christians
[1:02:35] not reading their Bibles to not praying
[1:02:37] I feel so condemned because I thought it
[1:02:40] was just I was such a failure now and I
[1:02:41] was so ghastly because i had ATM and so
[1:02:45] I gone up for a prayer to ask the
[1:02:48] brother like to help me that I could
[1:02:50] somehow time to read my Bible and pray
[1:02:53] baby and she cried every time I tried to
[1:02:56] do that and so I was expecting that he
[1:02:58] was going to say on right systematically
[1:03:00] a prayer here that that will help you we
[1:03:02] July when prey like you should and
[1:03:03] instead he backed up and crispy come and
[1:03:07] go up remember to call six
[1:03:10] exit devil I was I want and he just
[1:03:14] totally flipped it on its head and it
[1:03:16] really relieved me of the guilt I was
[1:03:18] having he was saying God has called you
[1:03:20] to care for go to speak and he was just
[1:03:22] telling you like the way you serve your
[1:03:24] family you're serving God read your
[1:03:26] Bible but if I go maybe you can only get
[1:03:28] a couple verses in at a time because
[1:03:29] can't sit down like you used to and you
[1:03:32] just really like counseled me do that
[1:03:34] within just a couple minutes and it was
[1:03:37] something I just always remembered
[1:03:38] because I was it just lends me so much
[1:03:42] and i felt like a family cares about
[1:03:44] money even just as a mom you know caring
[1:03:46] for my children at home and that it's
[1:03:48] I'm not a worse Christian now because of
[1:03:50] that and you know now six goodness even
[1:03:55] you know greater than that
[1:03:58] that's what that was that was something
[1:04:00] that had always really want something
[1:04:01] and then I'll just see me sheriff or
[1:04:05] after we had Malachi
[1:04:09] right before we have Malachi we but led
[1:04:11] to start the church and on have been
[1:04:15] traveling to Lima I think for a year and
[1:04:17] a half and
[1:04:18] we were sometimes the first one there we
[1:04:21] were driving three hours and usually the
[1:04:22] first ones there I don't think you're
[1:04:25] over the last one to leave but we never
[1:04:26] left early my brother Jess had to shake
[1:04:28] hands with everybody before we left
[1:04:33] but though your eyes there with everyone
[1:04:35] and it was really good that towards the
[1:04:37] end is just really getting hard doing
[1:04:39] this with a baby Lydia did not travel
[1:04:41] while she screamed but full three hours
[1:04:43] there and three hours back she didn't
[1:04:45] sleep and recover see so it was really
[1:04:47] wearing on us than we were expecting
[1:04:48] again and we were been working with
[1:04:51] brother Brooks on potentially starting a
[1:04:53] church here and
[1:04:54] I just knew jessie was the pastor I just
[1:04:58] went and I think anybody else know but I
[1:05:01] knew it and I just kept quiet about it
[1:05:05] at the time we thought where the tim
[1:05:06] myers would be his evangelists now but
[1:05:10] he was up in the area and
[1:05:14] when Tim was getting married he was
[1:05:16] human too much Carolina and I just
[1:05:19] smiled in my heart and Jesse's the
[1:05:20] pastor he's called me pastor but I never
[1:05:22] thought of what that would be for me
[1:05:23] like that that makes it past fine and so
[1:05:26] I just knew it that's his call me and
[1:05:28] I'm
[1:05:29] an acute mental you know
[1:05:32] hate towards may be reluctant to to
[1:05:35] think that and
[1:05:37] but we eventually did starting you know
[1:05:39] are here now we got Malachi then as a
[1:05:42] baby and he was sick a lot
[1:05:45] Jesse what is now pastoring he was
[1:05:48] working and he was in graduate school
[1:05:50] and there were different financial
[1:05:52] issues too and I was finding myself like
[1:05:55] a tea kettle almost every night when it
[1:05:59] was really hard for me to keep my temper
[1:06:01] under control and I just felt like I was
[1:06:04] so stressed out all the time and come to
[1:06:07] the end of the night he gave him a the
[1:06:08] two little ones of a half now I kinda
[1:06:11] had this cried at a local bar and it
[1:06:14] just it echoed in the bathroom in such a
[1:06:16] way that I just felt like it was like
[1:06:18] giving me a short circuit and I would
[1:06:21] get so upset i would just eventually
[1:06:22] screams I'm so really we just frustrated
[1:06:25] and how was tension and I didn't even
[1:06:27] understand what it was and then I would
[1:06:31] just cry because I felt like the worst
[1:06:32] mother in the world and if I find
[1:06:35] scarring my children like I was really
[1:06:37] really worried that they were going to
[1:06:38] have I don't know like stress issues
[1:06:41] growing up or anxiety issues because I
[1:06:45] only this tea kettle sometimes
[1:06:47] in order just cry felt so guilty and
[1:06:50] then I would talk to Jesse about it no
[1:06:52] time like I don't want to do this and
[1:06:54] I'm praying when I can feel a building
[1:06:56] and I know he's like Oh God says you
[1:06:59] know that he'll give us a shout and I
[1:07:01] believed it but I didn't see it and I
[1:07:03] was trying to find like an immediate way
[1:07:05] out in that moment when I was so
[1:07:07] frustrated like I'm doing with a
[1:07:09] Christian being with and praying and i'm
[1:07:11] quoting scripture and i'm trying to sing
[1:07:12] it's not working and it was really hard
[1:07:16] for me and what ended up spinning was
[1:07:18] God evening the way up and in a way I
[1:07:21] didn't expect where another man that is
[1:07:24] a pastor of a large church in the area I
[1:07:27] was friends with Jesse and with asking
[1:07:30] him if if he was taking our date for
[1:07:32] more
[1:07:33] he was like nah no we just family stuff
[1:07:37] sometimes we'd be that now instead and
[1:07:39] his like really need to take your life
[1:07:41] on the dates you need we need to have a
[1:07:43] break on the kids and uh huh and he
[1:07:48] gives them a book couple of just a
[1:07:49] couple chapters out of I thinking what
[1:07:50] made copies or something just started
[1:07:52] reading Wow
[1:07:53] yeah yeah so he started taking me out of
[1:07:57] the house and it wasn't until years
[1:08:00] later that I realized I was praying for
[1:08:02] the way out marketa too I didn't know
[1:08:04] that what I needed was just time out the
[1:08:05] house and time away from the children as
[1:08:07] much as I love him mom you know how it
[1:08:10] is like day in day out with him he is so
[1:08:13] busy
[1:08:13] it was just more than my stress levels I
[1:08:16] could manage as one person and so you
[1:08:20] know God did into my prayer and and I
[1:08:22] really create our one service you know
[1:08:24] just a nice team crying to think I don't
[1:08:26] scream on the kids like this and
[1:08:29] here i prayed afterwards for like 45
[1:08:32] minutes or an hour it got really
[1:08:34] delivered me there too and so our first
[1:08:36] date that we have you know Jesse wanted
[1:08:38] to try to bring this up and talk to me
[1:08:39] about it and I could tell him like why
[1:08:42] delivered me and
[1:08:43] and so that was a real blessing to word
[1:08:47] of you know I was just thankful that in
[1:08:49] those situations God showed that he was
[1:08:51] mine
[1:08:51] and and build that I'm able to bear
[1:08:55] so now that was a special thing and now
[1:09:00] just
[1:09:01] being a mom so many children just see
[1:09:04] that is like the most sanctifying
[1:09:06] experience ever
[1:09:08] people say like I can never have so many
[1:09:10] children as you i'm not patient enough
[1:09:11] and like i'm not patient enough either
[1:09:13] oh my goodness that guy
[1:09:15] no I blew up at making so much when I
[1:09:18] just had a couple of it it's through the
[1:09:20] experience of being a mom to so many
[1:09:21] other gods made inclusion and it's like
[1:09:25] temporary me down and help me
[1:09:27] and more nurturing and has helped me
[1:09:30] grow and all those you know treats that
[1:09:32] we're supposed to have as a Christian
[1:09:33] like if anything fun it's been it's been
[1:09:35] motherhood and second to that probably
[1:09:37] ministry
[1:09:38] but I'm thankful for those now so it
[1:09:41] makes I think my Christian walk a little
[1:09:43] bit different than other people who are
[1:09:44] being passed that stage or who aren't
[1:09:46] there yet
[1:09:47] but God definitely misses so Spencer
[1:09:51] and now one last thing I'll in with I'd
[1:09:54] set up
[1:09:55] not having a good relationship with my
[1:09:58] dad ever God delivered me from hating
[1:09:59] him or I can say I talked to him on for
[1:10:01] my teeth I love you dad and I mean it a
[1:10:03] pity him where he is right now
[1:10:06] sorry for him and that you know a
[1:10:09] preformed got can deliver him but I
[1:10:11] always had a hard time thinking with God
[1:10:13] as a heavenly father but the scriptures
[1:10:14] where it says like if your earthly
[1:10:16] fathers know how to give you a good
[1:10:17] gifts I'm surely God does my hundred
[1:10:21] so I could never
[1:10:23] connect with scriptures about father I
[1:10:26] just
[1:10:27] I don't I told my mom wants because she
[1:10:30] feels bad about it so we don't miss it
[1:10:32] because I never had I don't even look
[1:10:33] like
[1:10:35] it's okay but now because of having the
[1:10:39] family that we do about God's grace and
[1:10:41] just see also breaking the cycle of
[1:10:44] dysfunctional family in his life to see
[1:10:48] him as a father now and the kind of man
[1:10:50] that he is has really redeemed what it
[1:10:52] is to help out is that Heavenly Father

[1:13:36] so please God I just have a few slides
[1:13:41] here like to show by the grace of Lord
[1:13:42] so 1980 I came on the scene up starting
[1:13:45] to go back here yeah
[1:13:46] nineteen eighty I came on the scene my
[1:13:49] dad's name is snooki Smith I never
[1:13:51] believed that that name was really
[1:13:54] haunted in those whole life and he's
[1:13:55] been teased and it is coffee because you
[1:13:58] know he's used it as a crutch bless his
[1:14:00] heart he's never able to overcome that
[1:14:03] he's trying to change his name a few
[1:14:04] times and he finally has changed it to
[1:14:07] rain now just as his middle name ray
[1:14:08] smith is just Ray Smith so I haven't
[1:14:13] seen a middle name is he stuck erased
[1:14:14] method I'm jessierae but that's always
[1:14:17] kind of a you know been a stigma for him
[1:14:20] a struggling point there I've always
[1:14:23] loved my dad I was never very proud of
[1:14:24] my dad he's just been wonderful dad when
[1:14:26] he's been there and i was i was born and
[1:14:29] my mom already had three babies and
[1:14:31] diapers I was the poor child and she had
[1:14:34] Simon who's three years three years
[1:14:37] older than me and then my brother Sam
[1:14:39] and cam were twins they were one year
[1:14:41] older than me and then I was born she
[1:14:43] had four babies diapers at the same time
[1:14:45] and my mom said I was the most content
[1:14:47] baby ever
[1:14:49] she would nurse me set me down and then
[1:14:51] the two twins would take all the rest of
[1:14:53] the nursing them exciting as much
[1:14:55] nursing as they got but I never
[1:14:57] complained about it
[1:14:58] so I had odd you know to me it's kind of
[1:15:01] odd thing they were hoping for a girl
[1:15:03] the whole time Oh God sets good girl you
[1:15:05] know kid three boys is all right that's
[1:15:06] another boy
[1:15:08] so I just ordained of God which is very
[1:15:11] happy I had a very happy childhood
[1:15:15] you know that I grown up I just loved
[1:15:17] just love playing with my dad I love
[1:15:19] baseball and those bright my body could
[1:15:21] sports and I never want to be a preacher
[1:15:23] and everyone to I I was my mom my mother
[1:15:26] took us to church every Sunday every
[1:15:28] Sunday everyone tonight all by herself
[1:15:29] my dad would go he was raised Catholic
[1:15:31] but live in search for God till nineteen
[1:15:34] eighty-three
[1:15:35] so I just member going to church every
[1:15:37] Sunday and cried my mom dragon six kids
[1:15:40] to church you know growing up he was
[1:15:43] really God's grace but she taught us
[1:15:44] always be in the house of God and she's
[1:15:46] got three preachers out of it by God's
[1:15:48] grace and 50 60 or 50 to message her to
[1:15:51] what a moment goes and hostile to church
[1:15:54] so I really believe God's honored her
[1:15:56] faith in that way but I grew up in a
[1:16:00] Trinitarian Assemblies of God Church and
[1:16:03] there was no holiness standards you know
[1:16:05] although the pastor's my boys wear
[1:16:06] skirts every week
[1:16:08] oilers skirts but we were speaking in
[1:16:11] tongues almost every sin every of sunday
[1:16:13] morning and it was almost the same
[1:16:15] people a few different people it was
[1:16:17] nothing and usually it was just general
[1:16:18] stuff a couple times it was like really
[1:16:20] specific and call people out and then I
[1:16:23] told you this one time when I was a
[1:16:24] teenager I was just playing God I want
[1:16:26] to serve you show me you rely said send
[1:16:27] seven tons interpretation without
[1:16:30] believe you and I'll serve you now the
[1:16:31] Bible said at two at most three
[1:16:35] but that service got and there was like
[1:16:37] 10 I mean it's just kept coming each one
[1:16:40] I was like oh oh and then I felt bad
[1:16:42] because I still want to surrender to God
[1:16:43] I was feeling so all about soldiering
[1:16:45] tonight you know sins as a teenager
[1:16:47] things like that but I knew God was real
[1:16:49] in 1988 of course you know my mother was
[1:16:51] here to cancer that's been the most
[1:16:53] profound being miracle that's happened
[1:16:55] to me just around me to see that to
[1:16:58] visit my mom in the hospital and crying
[1:17:00] leaving knowing she's gonna die and my
[1:17:03] dad prays over her one night while she's
[1:17:04] sleeping and they hope they cut her open
[1:17:06] for surgery to take outs of the cancer
[1:17:08] and tall God and then the next year or
[1:17:10] two we went around in different churches
[1:17:12] in Toledo are on the area my mom would
[1:17:13] give her testimony and just knowing the
[1:17:16] power of God I've always known that God
[1:17:19] is real there's power
[1:17:21] always had a reverence for God there's a
[1:17:23] little picture of us growing up with my
[1:17:25] dad there's me there's am in Simon Khaya
[1:17:29] but that's a little picture of us we
[1:17:31] love to play you know with my dad real
[1:17:33] good dad nobody was a balance of
[1:17:35] depression yeah but really enjoyed that
[1:17:38] this would make sure we brought the year
[1:17:39] before my mom had cancer that's not my
[1:17:41] mom that's my hand but that's me my
[1:17:43] sister Betsy it's my cousin Simon and
[1:17:47] then Santa cam hands the background
[1:17:50] they're real humble in the background
[1:17:51] but I got pretty dark as a job that
[1:17:54] inspired my testimony to you know they
[1:17:55] always made fun of me cuz I'm so dark I
[1:17:57] got into darker than that I like how
[1:18:00] dark my legs I was really really dark
[1:18:01] and so they would make fun of me they
[1:18:03] would call me some slang words for an
[1:18:05] African American you know how he's going
[1:18:06] and cry and so my dad would captain on
[1:18:09] the shoulder so that's okay so you're my
[1:18:10] only black said he said it to you call
[1:18:12] me so even in my types of hurt you would
[1:18:14] try to encourage me he was always
[1:18:17] encouraging like go to college get an
[1:18:20] education you know
[1:18:22] said you know you're going to do
[1:18:24] something great you know just just go to
[1:18:26] college or do something great and
[1:18:28] he was always encouraging me that he was
[1:18:30] only doing when I was begging to go to
[1:18:32] the baseball card Authority taking the
[1:18:34] baseball card store and I was always
[1:18:36] thankful you know for my childhood my
[1:18:38] mom was such a servant she's known in
[1:18:40] our town as the time saying you know
[1:18:41] every Christmas Easter and Thanksgiving
[1:18:44] she does think the kids meals she'll
[1:18:46] give out 200 meals to the shut-ins and
[1:18:50] and the town just gathers in you know
[1:18:52] and and supports and just gives donation
[1:18:55] to turkeys and everything like that so
[1:18:56] I'm very thankful you know for the faith
[1:18:59] my mom instilled in with me and my mom
[1:19:01] would gather us all run every night my
[1:19:03] dad was never there maybe just a couple
[1:19:05] of times but every night she got all six
[1:19:07] kids and make everyone pray first and
[1:19:08] she would closing prayer sometimes we
[1:19:11] roll around the bed rolling off the bed
[1:19:12] snicker and you know yeah boys are here
[1:19:15] but she always taught us to pray every
[1:19:17] morning before school we join hands with
[1:19:19] you no matter or later not we join hands
[1:19:21] a word of prayer and pray that God will
[1:19:23] bless the day and my mom really
[1:19:26] instilled that we need to pray I've
[1:19:27] never forgot thats always been a great
[1:19:29] rock you know me growing up around
[1:19:32] nineteen eighty nine or nine I was saved
[1:19:35] from drowning I was drowning and my
[1:19:37] cousin
[1:19:38] Matt who is the brother of the cousin
[1:19:41] Adam that was your last Sunday he jumped
[1:19:43] in and pulled me up and I remember going
[1:19:44] down like I was I was all just saying
[1:19:46] it's old it's all up it's all over and
[1:19:48] he pulled me up and that gave me a new
[1:19:51] lease on life
[1:19:53] and it was just really great you know to
[1:19:55] see how god I'm trying to be a big boys
[1:19:57] come across the big pond you know I was
[1:20:00] already up for it was awesome to see how
[1:20:02] God came and save me from that there's a
[1:20:04] few other times one time in college I
[1:20:06] was running with a gentleman to football
[1:20:08] practice and he's got this little geo
[1:20:10] metro or somebody's like let's take it
[1:20:12] up to 100 a sick up the night I'm like

[1:20:16] before I heard the message but he was
[1:20:17] speeding on 76 getting off right there
[1:20:21] right right near that goodie gear
[1:20:23] headquarters and there was all kinds of
[1:20:25] traffic all kinds of traffic and he
[1:20:28] tried to try to get off at the exit and
[1:20:30] slammed on his brakes and we went
[1:20:31] spinning two or three times across four
[1:20:33] lanes and we stopped God is my witness
[1:20:36] we stopped right by that the middle
[1:20:38] concrete barriers and we had room to get
[1:20:41] out and then as soon as we stopped four
[1:20:43] or five trucks drove past you know 70
[1:20:46] miles per hour and we just looked at
[1:20:48] each other like we were just spared God
[1:20:50] just spared our lives oh now they came
[1:20:53] in i'm sorry yeah so God just spared my
[1:20:55] life that way so numerous times and one
[1:20:57] time I was choking on the Sun silly but
[1:20:59] on the egg yolk a hard-boiled egg I was
[1:21:02] choking on that and I couldn't breathe
[1:21:03] and I would get ready get ready to pass
[1:21:05] out my dad comes up and gives me the
[1:21:07] hymen maneuver a shout out some of the
[1:21:09] yolks I know at least three or four
[1:21:11] times God has saved my life least from
[1:21:13] passing out or something like that and
[1:21:15] I'm very thankful for God's and the
[1:21:17] mercy I voicing his hand of mercy in my
[1:21:19] life that might be the theme of my
[1:21:21] testimony God's mercy his favor you know
[1:21:22] I think favor was what I like the most
[1:21:24] see my fur gotta just show me a favor um
[1:21:26] but in 1992 I think my dad taught me the
[1:21:29] greatest lesson I was about 12 years old
[1:21:31] I put this on facebook about two years
[1:21:33] ago but i just love baseball he was my
[1:21:35] idol Jose Canseco don't remember him but
[1:21:38] he was a sports car driving fanatic you
[1:21:40] know it went in fanatic and I just love
[1:21:42] me because he had big muscles get a lot
[1:21:44] of home runs well I studied his cars I
[1:21:46] knew every fact about him RBI's hum of
[1:21:49] this is batting for batting average home
[1:21:51] runs everything like that and my dad was
[1:21:54] really starting to seek out at that time
[1:21:55] and he pulled that card he said Jess he
[1:21:57] said he set it down he said you know
[1:21:59] Jesse Jose Canseco doesn't like blonde
[1:22:02] women
[1:22:02] he doesn't he likes trucks that likes
[1:22:05] pick ups trucks and he hit 20 home runs
[1:22:07] in 1988 I said no dead he's got a blonde
[1:22:11] girlfriend he drives a red sports car
[1:22:12] and he had 42 home runs in 1980 he said
[1:22:16] Jesse you know I couldn't deceive you on
[1:22:18] that about Jose Canseco I couldn't i
[1:22:19] deceive you on that and he said and I
[1:22:22] said well because I know am i studying
[1:22:23] him and he said that's the same way it
[1:22:25] is with jesus christ he said you get to
[1:22:27] know Jesus Christ so much you said you
[1:22:29] if you know him so well know the word so
[1:22:31] well no man will deceive you I was just
[1:22:33] a little tall girl but ok dad you know
[1:22:35] that's kind of weird no walk away but
[1:22:38] that never left me as soon as I gave my
[1:22:39] heart to Lourdes came back to my mind
[1:22:41] and that's the others picture my dad did
[1:22:43] by God's grace but that was the greatest
[1:22:45] lesson I've ever learned in my life no
[1:22:47] Jesus Christ so well at the devil can to
[1:22:49] see in other words have revelations
[1:22:51] right for the puts for the message terms
[1:22:52] as so much made the revelation that
[1:22:54] second can't to see because they lack
[1:22:56] could not be to see David that's been a
[1:22:59] great testimony in my life there is my
[1:23:00] dad I've been a great instrument there
[1:23:02] to help me
[1:23:05] 1977 I god help me punch my ticket to
[1:23:08] akron i'm just going to show a video
[1:23:11] real quick i should think i showed us at
[1:23:12] the other place
[1:23:13] in 1997 we were state champions in
[1:23:17] football division five here in Ohio and
[1:23:19] here's here's just a little bit here
[1:23:23] let me go back a little bit okay so
[1:23:26] where this little we're this little tiny
[1:23:28] town we're like a just a super tiny town
[1:23:31] this is what I use for the kids i was
[1:23:34] teaching the kids and bible study how
[1:23:35] you can have a natural tail in spiritual
[1:23:37] town so this is right right down the
[1:23:38] road on 77
[1:23:40] and
[1:23:41] it's over at fawcett stadium the state
[1:23:44] championship there and how do we not
[1:23:46] made it i don't think i ever want to
[1:23:47] come to a cur I didn't know the city
[1:23:49] named Akron existed actually um
[1:23:53] so this is I was required receiver so
[1:23:56] that's the state championship game I
[1:23:57] caught a few passes here that's me
[1:24:00] number 11 I was led an hour and I got a
[1:24:03] touchdown that state championship game
[1:24:04] well there was a bunch of scouts up in
[1:24:06] the stadium I hear i kneeled down i'm
[1:24:08] not even a Christian but my mom just
[1:24:10] praising me all the time and I was so
[1:24:11] humble that I caught a touchdown I just
[1:24:13] kneel down and thank God I wasn't even I
[1:24:15] mean I was cussing and smoking you know
[1:24:17] all kinds of stuff but they were just
[1:24:19] all the prayers of my mother I was
[1:24:20] telling the kids got and taught me at
[1:24:22] least to honor God with my talents this
[1:24:25] is just right down the road here idea
[1:24:26] but their scouts up there from Akron and
[1:24:28] pretty soon as my brother saying he's a
[1:24:30] real he's excited God thank God one day
[1:24:35] he's gonna come this message he told me
[1:24:37] reach out there it is
[1:24:38] his why even have told me you know that
[1:24:41] they believed everything I said the
[1:24:43] different thing but I'm very thankful
[1:24:45] for that so I was showing the kids you
[1:24:47] know how at a natural Tampa then God
[1:24:48] give me a spiritual town and this was in
[1:24:50] Columbus in 2010 I prayed for that
[1:24:52] sister there and she got him about four
[1:24:53] things in that specific service there
[1:24:56] for Easter she could have been her knee
[1:24:58] she had back trouble all kinds of the
[1:25:00] things that after service she's so happy
[1:25:02] like saying you know God healed me of
[1:25:04] all these things and I just said praise
[1:25:05] the Lord you know I was fasting that
[1:25:07] whole weekend you know and I told God
[1:25:09] I'm not going to take any offering if
[1:25:10] you do some supernatural take no
[1:25:11] offering God didn't numerous
[1:25:13] supernatural things that weekend so just
[1:25:15] showing the children you know how uh uh
[1:25:17] if you have a natural gift that's
[1:25:19] wonderful but the spiritual gifts are
[1:25:21] more important to that I'm gonna switch
[1:25:23] over so that was my ticket to accurate
[1:25:25] was because I you know I was playing
[1:25:28] right down the road here and never
[1:25:29] knackered existed if you coaches saw me
[1:25:30] and they offered money they told my
[1:25:32] coach to offer him a scholarship and so
[1:25:35] I didn't have any other offers so I want
[1:25:36] to play football attacker and
[1:25:38] was very thankful for that I showed the
[1:25:40] video
[1:25:41] but 1998 I bet the level love my life my
[1:25:44] wife you know or jumping long jumper
[1:25:46] there's our first picture of a
[1:25:47] Thanksgiving together by God's grace you
[1:25:50] know
[1:25:51] and my life has never been the same said
[1:25:55] she had a different character than all
[1:25:56] the I used to do I stood you know right
[1:25:59] girls a lot of notes I was a talk on the
[1:26:01] phone kind of guy you know that's all we
[1:26:03] did we never really did nothing do more
[1:26:05] with that we never went on dates or
[1:26:06] anything like that it sounds like okay
[1:26:08] dating you know what i mean but i
[1:26:10] usually don't know from girlfriend a
[1:26:11] girlfriend you'll just talk on the phone
[1:26:13] girlfriend that's all we had
[1:26:14] that's all we did there and uh oh then
[1:26:17] when I met Chris it was totally
[1:26:18] different i could never break up with
[1:26:20] her other girls i could break up with
[1:26:21] but it's going to break up with her so I
[1:26:23] just knew there was something different
[1:26:24] about her um and then she said you know
[1:26:27] in 1999 I went to college and I remember
[1:26:30] the first this first semester I was so
[1:26:32] it was the most awful depressing
[1:26:33] semester of my life
[1:26:35] because I was not serving God I was all
[1:26:38] alone I wasn't with her I drive back
[1:26:39] every weekend to see her so I was I
[1:26:41] heard my fractured my fifth lumbar
[1:26:44] vertebrae in high school had never got
[1:26:46] detected and I went to Akron to play
[1:26:48] football and they put me in a back brace
[1:26:49] for four months i couldn't even run for
[1:26:51] four months it was most impressing I
[1:26:53] remember just driving down chapel hill
[1:26:54] mall just trying to waste time is
[1:26:56] driving all by myself just so so
[1:26:58] miserable and then but these guys from
[1:27:01] the chapel up here in agric have
[1:27:03] witnesses to be like I'll he should come
[1:27:04] and said and finally I gave in and and
[1:27:08] part of it was my brother cam so I put
[1:27:10] the picture brother Caleb here when I
[1:27:12] would go home and see my wife Kim he
[1:27:14] just gave his heart to the Lord of
[1:27:15] denomination he was you know he was in
[1:27:16] there the church that we grew up in and
[1:27:18] he was like me borrow his car and so I
[1:27:21] 10 drivers caught there he had Christian
[1:27:22] contemporary music and a shower like its
[1:27:24] of the songs priest happy songs and
[1:27:27] singing about heaven and all these
[1:27:28] things like that and then through that I
[1:27:32] went to an athletes in action conference
[1:27:33] on the same night Kristin went to the
[1:27:35] day concert and I saw a six foot six his
[1:27:38] name was tim anderson he's a redhead he
[1:27:40] played for hiyo state use a national
[1:27:41] champion in 2002 I always I'll never
[1:27:43] forget it and he knew me too we played
[1:27:45] against each other in college too he
[1:27:47] started raising his hands to God and I
[1:27:48] felt so ashamed of myself of all the
[1:27:50] times I tried to give my heart to God of
[1:27:52] all the gifts got to give me how a state
[1:27:54] champ about seven times you know tracked
[1:27:56] in football different things like that
[1:27:58] of all the things God has blessed you
[1:28:00] with and here I'm ashamed to raise my
[1:28:02] hands and I've been running from God all
[1:28:03] these years I said God forgive me and I
[1:28:05] just not right there gave my heart to
[1:28:07] Lord as soon as i got home i threw away
[1:28:08] my metallica like Nirvana my Snoop Dogg
[1:28:11] notorious b.i.g I took out the pictures
[1:28:13] off the wall I went out or no I had a
[1:28:15] NIV Bible my church gave me I started
[1:28:17] studying that NIV bible and i came to
[1:28:19] matthew 7 and said you know the Bible
[1:28:22] said not everyone is saved that me Lord
[1:28:23] Lord will enter the kingdom of God only
[1:28:25] those who do the will my father's
[1:28:26] haven't you cast out demons and all
[1:28:28] these things and I just I never knew
[1:28:30] what that meant and so for two years I
[1:28:32] struggle with that what does that mean I
[1:28:33] don't understand it I would go to church
[1:28:37] but I was always hungry for more the
[1:28:39] word like the church I was in was
[1:28:40] Presbyterian which is kind of I mean
[1:28:43] there's some good things in there like
[1:28:44] salvation but then I start hungry so I
[1:28:47] got in contact with john piper's
[1:28:49] ministry which brother case into Mars
[1:28:50] that's the John hi brewski is pastor
[1:28:53] that's it he was saying so he had a real
[1:28:54] eyelid connections college football and
[1:28:56] John Piper John pine burr had a doctrine
[1:28:59] called Christian hedonism and I loved it
[1:29:01] even a person who's hedonistic does what
[1:29:04] is whatever their pleasure right if
[1:29:06] you're eating istic whatever this
[1:29:07] pleasure while you do it well he had a
[1:29:09] little doctrine called Christian
[1:29:10] hedonism so a Christian only does what
[1:29:13] pleasures them and which is God so it's
[1:29:16] a little interesting you know I just
[1:29:17] loved it I ate it up I was hungry for
[1:29:19] more and more the word of God and
[1:29:21] kept he knows always want more of God
[1:29:23] and loving the Lord I mean I'd live with
[1:29:26] this burden for 19 years these times i
[1:29:28] tried to give my life to god i finally
[1:29:30] surrendered and I was just so happy and
[1:29:32] so thankful for god's grace in 2001
[1:29:36] that's when the message came to me on
[1:29:37] Thanksgiving night it came to mean I
[1:29:39] look just like this on that night I was
[1:29:41] at I'll hair longer than that but I was
[1:29:43] after trim I think but
[1:29:47] it was on Thanksgiving night and Simon
[1:29:49] was the one who witness to me he let me
[1:29:51] listen to a sermon called two seats like
[1:29:53] Chris ha whoo-hoo since doesn't preach
[1:29:55] anymore but he was truly gifted man and
[1:29:57] I was just blown away and my wife was
[1:30:00] right sometimes I'd be on fire sometimes
[1:30:02] I doubt it sometimes I me a bar
[1:30:03] sometimes I doubted but took the course
[1:30:05] over in a few months there to God really
[1:30:08] solidified it in my heart and
[1:30:10] every time I was struggling like one
[1:30:12] time I was struggling and all the all
[1:30:14] the all my friends came in and prayed
[1:30:17] with me two gathers called and the very
[1:30:19] next morning Craig called me said how
[1:30:21] you doing bro Jesse he's completing the
[1:30:22] message I was like yeah oh yeah now i
[1:30:26] repented of that prayer but god no I
[1:30:29] needed that I needed that the morning
[1:30:31] after I remember getting up the first
[1:30:33] thing I was a call from Craig I thank
[1:30:34] you when he was here preacher horse and
[1:30:36] you I said thank you mother for calling
[1:30:37] me i need that call I just basically
[1:30:39] prayed and so I leave the message but I
[1:30:41] knew was wrong even in that and that
[1:30:43] brought such a conviction to my heart
[1:30:45] yes sir I still AM you know I still have
[1:30:47] my god too very so forgive me and so I
[1:30:50] was able to stay in the word of god
[1:30:52] there's a Simon you know with the kids
[1:30:54] if you think that about two years going
[1:30:55] Simon is a man of little statue but the
[1:30:57] man except the biggest heart I know he's
[1:31:00] just such a wonderful man of God anyway
[1:31:02] so we preach enforce all ends things I
[1:31:03] kind of need a break I got a busy bee
[1:31:04] coming up so that was 2001 and
[1:31:08] next 2002 is like the hour of five with
[1:31:11] that yours like our bible training firm
[1:31:13] I would just have a dr uncertain maybe
[1:31:16] once a month I drive over to Craig's and
[1:31:18] you bioassays for two or three or four
[1:31:20] hours as long as I could sit there I
[1:31:21] wrote down every scripture he ever said
[1:31:23] about anything I was just falling in
[1:31:25] love with the word of God so many great
[1:31:27] revelations a lot of friends left me and
[1:31:30] sober like that but always be grateful
[1:31:32] to god for the the bible training that i
[1:31:34] got to brother craig there and some some
[1:31:38] some assignment as well by god's grace
[1:31:40] 2003 was really my hour of deliverance i
[1:31:43] got a lot of delivering their liver ins
[1:31:44] from things like addictions and I hated
[1:31:47] my dad you know before this I hated my
[1:31:49] dad because left my mom and left us all
[1:31:52] there he didn't come a lot of my
[1:31:52] sporting events yet my sometimes my
[1:31:54] uncle's would I said a lot of hatred I
[1:31:56] just walk around hate of you know him
[1:31:58] who cares if he he moved to Tennessee I
[1:32:00] say who cares if he comes back you know
[1:32:02] but through the message you know through
[1:32:04] the preaching of were like oh you'd have
[1:32:05] to forgive everybody like if you don't
[1:32:07] forget you're not getting into heaven
[1:32:09] and I so realize I'm thinking about his
[1:32:11] name you know studying how his dad never
[1:32:13] talked to him they would go down for
[1:32:16] summers he was the last of 10 kids they
[1:32:18] would go down for summers down there to
[1:32:19] Florida you know like snow birds and
[1:32:21] sift my dad in the in the room and let
[1:32:24] him watch TV all winter long and would
[1:32:25] talk to it all that's just how he was
[1:32:28] treated come out to eat and sent back
[1:32:29] his room and so he was all alone he's
[1:32:31] used to know how do you know tree kids
[1:32:33] it did just didn't know how to overcome
[1:32:35] you know it all what kinds of struggles
[1:32:37] like that so I learned that pity on any
[1:32:39] compassion upon it and then God got rid
[1:32:42] of my numerous addictions like video
[1:32:43] games
[1:32:44] smoking and custody bad movies and all
[1:32:47] kinds of things like that a lot of awful
[1:32:49] addictions but in that year you know
[1:32:51] through studying the Bible that's why I
[1:32:52] told these brothers younger brother's
[1:32:54] coming in I said once you're free once
[1:32:57] you get into god fill your life with the
[1:32:58] word of God everything will fall off
[1:32:59] that sanctification is fill your life
[1:33:02] with the word of God every spare moment
[1:33:03] I find out even though I believe I'm
[1:33:05] born again I find I still need to give
[1:33:07] every moment of my time to God to make
[1:33:10] sure I don't go back to certain things
[1:33:11] right to temptations got the key that
[1:33:14] out we've got to keep filling your life
[1:33:15] with the word of God you to keep busy
[1:33:17] with the word of God in some type of
[1:33:20] ministry
[1:33:21] for 2003 I married the love of my life
[1:33:24] there i got married in that church i got
[1:33:27] baptized in my church I got ordained to
[1:33:29] preach in that church and bible
[1:33:30] believers Liddy was dedicating that
[1:33:32] church I love that church by believers
[1:33:33] in Lima I just love that church and
[1:33:36] brother Brooks preach a wonderful sermon
[1:33:38] that day all my family got to hear part
[1:33:40] of the message it was such a wonderful
[1:33:42] beautiful day the next day is when I
[1:33:44] believe I got the holy ghost cop sitting
[1:33:46] there in service we were there late and
[1:33:48] I just was just stood up all by myself
[1:33:50] which shouting rejoicing crying and
[1:33:53] seeing Christ you know my mind crucified
[1:33:56] and I walked out of there I just I just
[1:33:58] loved everybody I I've had not felt a
[1:34:00] lot I never felt a lot like that before
[1:34:02] I felt so free and the Holy Spirit's one
[1:34:04] that was the most free time I felt I'd
[1:34:06] had in the Holy Spirit and like so clean
[1:34:09] that too to this day as that was a day I
[1:34:10] put the stake down I believe that's
[1:34:12] where I got born again look at my life
[1:34:14] and I'm leave that lines up with the
[1:34:16] word of God
[1:34:17] so in 2004 i was ordained to preach the
[1:34:20] gospel there's a picture when i got
[1:34:22] ordained I brother Brooks and brother
[1:34:25] Craig was there brother tim was there
[1:34:27] different ones like that that was a
[1:34:29] special moment for me because I prayed
[1:34:31] and fasted a couple times that God
[1:34:33] showed me pop songs to provision first
[1:34:35] few times I preached there the author
[1:34:37] was filled with people just repenting
[1:34:39] and getting delivered I afraid if he
[1:34:40] fastens I've got to show me something
[1:34:42] supernatural and before I preach the
[1:34:45] other sister Karen right there she'd
[1:34:46] come up and or before I'd even preached
[1:34:48] on both sermons she even a word of
[1:34:50] knowledge and it's on tape I still got
[1:34:52] it today and we basically for tell when
[1:34:55] I was going to preach on so it's really
[1:34:56] a supernatural thing I really needed
[1:34:58] that my life by God's grace
[1:35:02] so I was attending you know then we made
[1:35:05] a Bible believers are Church of course
[1:35:07] and I was a deacon they're not just a
[1:35:10] minister you know like I said we drive
[1:35:12] three hours and i loved it i just love
[1:35:13] it there was Quinn churches around here
[1:35:15] but I just there's some other Brooks and
[1:35:16] those sayings brother Craig I just love
[1:35:18] those guys there there at the beginning
[1:35:21] you know they were the Shepherd's you
[1:35:23] watch over me and I'm so glad I did I
[1:35:25] learned so much about the Lord and
[1:35:27] serving God through those Saints such
[1:35:30] wonderful love and a real family
[1:35:32] atmosphere they helped create the Air
[1:35:33] Force
[1:35:35] 2004 Lydia came on the scene and had to
[1:35:39] become a father there by God's grace and
[1:35:41] Lydia you're the torture have all
[1:35:43] thought of something you know taught me
[1:35:45] a lot about serving others and when they
[1:35:48] say you don't children teach you to be
[1:35:49] less selfish that's so true and so true
[1:35:52] I've learned to live for them you know
[1:35:54] help them out the most I can by God's
[1:35:57] grace but that was a life-changing
[1:35:58] experience and each one that comes is
[1:36:01] another blessing from God
[1:36:04] 2006 I felt led to pasture and the
[1:36:08] scripture was on first Timothy 4 12 I've
[1:36:11] been praying and Jesus Jesus talked
[1:36:13] about counting the cost before you do
[1:36:14] anything right so I talked to numerous
[1:36:17] pastors you know should be what would it
[1:36:19] be like if we started church and Oh
[1:36:20] should we or the struggles were the
[1:36:22] trials we prayed about it a lot and then
[1:36:24] one day I was just hoping in the
[1:36:25] bathroom I think Lydia was taking a bath
[1:36:27] and I'll kind of something I don't know
[1:36:28] I just sitting there in the bath I just
[1:36:31] said lord I really need you to speak to
[1:36:32] me to show me if we're supposed to
[1:36:33] preach or have it have a church here i
[1:36:35] just opened up my Bible and it was first
[1:36:38] Timothy 4 12 let no man despise that
[1:36:40] youth be thou an example the believers
[1:36:42] in Word and conversational charity and
[1:36:44] spear and faith and purity
[1:36:46] till i come give attendance to reading
[1:36:48] to exhortation to doctrine they blend
[1:36:50] out the gift that is indie which was
[1:36:52] given me by the prophecy with the laying
[1:36:54] on of the hands of the presbytery
[1:36:57] so that scripture and it was only one of
[1:36:59] my eyes went directly that when i was
[1:37:01] only one highlight on that page and i
[1:37:03] just had such a piece right there like
[1:37:04] ha I think God's calling leave God's
[1:37:06] calling me and I found out later how
[1:37:08] brother branham did that sister me too
[1:37:09] did that that's given me a lot more
[1:37:10] confidence you know throughout the years
[1:37:13] to know that I prayed and asked for it
[1:37:14] of all the place in the Bible I could
[1:37:16] open up to it was that one about being
[1:37:19] young and being example and preach the
[1:37:21] word so I really been
[1:37:23] thankful for that scripture uh
[1:37:26] you know as I was pastoring from 2008
[1:37:29] 2013 I made four trips to South America
[1:37:31] these trips revolution revolution eyes
[1:37:35] on her life I I hadn't seen much
[1:37:37] supernatural before this a guide seen
[1:37:39] demons cast out of bible believers I'd
[1:37:41] seen that one night but as far as myself
[1:37:44] I hadn't really seen such supernatural
[1:37:46] there's a picture we have brother
[1:37:47] Maxwell these picture hanging up he's a
[1:37:49] real apostle past her and bird Brooke so
[1:37:52] I believe he started some churches to my
[1:37:54] god is very so we've always believed he
[1:37:56] was an apostle
[1:37:57] and that was a thousand 2013 there by
[1:38:01] God's grace but preaching another
[1:38:03] country taught me a lot about the
[1:38:04] ministry but Rams to everybody if you
[1:38:06] can't make a trip and overseas that will
[1:38:08] change your life and it really has it
[1:38:11] really has just seeing how God works and
[1:38:13] moves amongst people I've seen numerous
[1:38:15] miracles air I seen a man who had
[1:38:17] arthritis it couldn't even walk
[1:38:19] we're well I kiewit just stumbled like
[1:38:22] yours kind of chic back and bored like
[1:38:24] that we prayed for him and within a
[1:38:27] matter of minutes he's jumping around
[1:38:28] like this and he's moving his legs and
[1:38:30] he's praising god I said you got there
[1:38:31] and testify buddy yohji hours ride is so
[1:38:33] bad he was instantly delivered of
[1:38:35] arthritis
[1:38:37] the woman that he had the kidney stone
[1:38:40] instantly healed there after prayer
[1:38:42] worship
[1:38:43] cows on five times there it was really
[1:38:47] striking and the holy ish on the hoist
[1:38:49] forgot such a piece I literally felt
[1:38:51] peace come down from heaven and seeing
[1:38:54] people delivered and demons cast out was
[1:38:56] such a powerful thing I never seen that
[1:38:57] no I never done myself I was always
[1:39:00] scared to do it but those experiences
[1:39:02] show me the reality of God's Word and
[1:39:04] the power if you just believe it and
[1:39:07] literally live in the right channel you
[1:39:08] know god will manifest through you so I
[1:39:11] was very very thankful for those trips
[1:39:13] and they taught me so much about the
[1:39:15] gospel
[1:39:18] so I think I'll just close it this one
[1:39:21] here in 2014 I was really struggling
[1:39:24] with guide your loan and evangelism or
[1:39:26] do I stay in pasture and I told the
[1:39:29] story numerous times by said Lauren and
[1:39:31] Juno 2004 test the lord help me to win
[1:39:33] some message that will support our
[1:39:35] church I really need that I gotta have
[1:39:37] somebody our church to know that you
[1:39:39] still want me here I need someone here
[1:39:41] and then that was when brother amen came
[1:39:43] on the scene there and
[1:39:45] such a supernatural day that was for me
[1:39:48] all around but just to see brother amen
[1:39:51] come in and receive the word and now to
[1:39:53] see him taking his position knows
[1:39:55] unneeded things like that it's been a
[1:39:57] tremendous work to me uh because I'm the
[1:40:01] kind I've learned I got to show me a
[1:40:03] sign I pray God show me give me a
[1:40:07] physical sign give me something I can I
[1:40:09] can really believe and you're seeing a
[1:40:12] soul come in is the most blessed thing
[1:40:14] you could ever see because its eternal
[1:40:16] life amen and so that is meant so much
[1:40:19] to me it's gonna be such a piece and I
[1:40:21] so enjoyed
[1:40:23] pastoring ever since then before I
[1:40:25] joined it for the first while but I got
[1:40:26] to a bad state you know where I was
[1:40:28] struggling how come I doubt see more and
[1:40:30] then through this through his testimony
[1:40:33] in
[1:40:33] through this prayer goddess really give
[1:40:36] me a lot of peace I just got to watch
[1:40:37] out because every time I say that my
[1:40:40] wife reminded me this every time I said
[1:40:41] this is the happiest I've been as a
[1:40:42] pastor sums comes to battle us like
[1:40:46] somebody aleve or somebody will get you
[1:40:47] know so I watch my word but
[1:40:50] it really has given me a piece because
[1:40:53] like program have said you know where
[1:40:54] you're standing once you have
[1:40:56] what you're in the perfect will of God
[1:40:58] so I've known that and I don't struggle
[1:41:00] that anymore I know God's calling me to
[1:41:01] Akron he brought us here I never to come
[1:41:04] here and what that's been for football
[1:41:05] then he saved me an Akron yeah I mean a
[1:41:08] preaching Akron save souls and akram
[1:41:10] each day numerous holes here in Akron
[1:41:12] prom to the messages the hour and so
[1:41:15] it's give me such a confidence to go on
[1:41:18] with the Lord and like I said I've been
[1:41:20] healed twice instantly and services one
[1:41:22] time brother samson shetty from india
[1:41:24] prayed for me I sore throat for 90s and
[1:41:27] think I've counted and I went up for
[1:41:29] prayer and I just forgot about it as I
[1:41:31] was walking out that door wanna live
[1:41:32] I've started singing and there was
[1:41:33] absolutely no pain in my throat I've
[1:41:35] never ever had that happen before I was
[1:41:37] instantly healed after he prayed for me
[1:41:39] that was tremendous I I really needed
[1:41:41] that and then the other time I was
[1:41:43] preaching and I felt something like a
[1:41:45] roof
[1:41:46] about my neck and I couldn't move my
[1:41:47] neck there was just a few years ago and
[1:41:50] I just Holy Spirit just took my hand and
[1:41:52] we closed service and I'm afraid for
[1:41:53] myself and I felt I just felt like it
[1:41:55] the evaporation of the Holy Spirit I
[1:41:58] just evaporating that pain and to just
[1:42:00] just fab rate up and I was just so
[1:42:02] grateful after that to see God's hand in
[1:42:04] my life but as I close you know that's
[1:42:07] that's just the highlights of my
[1:42:09] testimony
[1:42:11] as i can say i just feel like God has
[1:42:14] had his favor and mercy upon me my whole
[1:42:17] life and I just always want to reverence
[1:42:21] that I always want to be thankful for
[1:42:23] that like I haven't already go go
[1:42:24] through a lot a really hard you know I
[1:42:26] tragedies or things like that having had
[1:42:28] to really go through a lot of those now
[1:42:30] to just have favored you know in mercy
[1:42:32] and
[1:42:33] but I've gone through personal battles
[1:42:36] you know personal trials and those type
[1:42:38] of things but I never want to take that
[1:42:39] for granted i want to just continue to
[1:42:40] walk humbly i like the bots like the
[1:42:44] Bible said I want to do the will of the
[1:42:46] Father I want to do God's will my life I
[1:42:48] always want to point people to Christ
[1:42:50] and their live a real example before
[1:42:52] Jesus so let's stand our feet there
[1:42:54] undisclosed with that by God's berries
[1:42:56] and like I said you hear most mind
[1:42:59] testimonies all the time but I just know
