[25:37] seated so I just want to preach on
[25:39] Romans 8 here and maybe we can finish
[25:41] the chapter tonight if we could finish
[25:42] the chapter that would be wonderful of
[25:44] course I never want to limit the Holy
[25:45] Spirit uh by the grace of the
[25:48] Lord and just so you know I did not get
[25:51] the um Sunday morning service up on
[25:53] YouTube yet in fact I just put the other
[25:55] one up from uh last week Wednesday so uh
[25:59] our emotions part two controlling our
[26:01] emotions part two I just put that up
[26:03] this week so I'll try to get last
[26:05] Sundays up soon uh as soon as I can by
[26:08] the grace of God I kind of just forgot I
[26:09] should have put it up yesterday but I
[26:10] just kind of forgot about that I'll try
[26:12] to get to that soon so we want to look
[26:15] here at Romans 811 now we'll start right
[26:17] in here I'll set a timer Lord willing
[26:19] we'll try to get hit about an hour by
[26:21] the grace of the
[26:23] Lord Romans 811 we read this last time
[26:26] and we saw that I believe church and I
[26:28] believe the Bible proves it any man or
[26:30] woman who is Justified has the spirit of
[26:33] Christ in them they have it in their
[26:35] minds praise God and I even wrote in my
[26:38] uh 2021 book I believe there's I believe
[26:41] there's evidence that the soul can have
[26:42] a small anointing of the Holy Spirit
[26:44] without being filled I believe that
[26:47] there's evidence for that because the
[26:48] Bible said uh that lot was a righteous
[26:51] Soul right so how could he be righteous
[26:54] unless the Holy Spirit was in his soul
[26:56] somehow so I believe that I but I
[26:59] believe in the New Testament now the
[27:00] fullness of the Holy Ghost can come into
[27:02] the soul Hallelujah now that's just a
[27:04] small little thought I just thought I'd
[27:06] share actually wasn't even in my notes
[27:08] but I do believe that because how could
[27:10] the souls be called righteous unless the
[27:12] Holy Spirit was in there so that's just
[27:14] my humble opinion but I believe a person
[27:17] uh the Bible said when they're Justified
[27:19] is they're declared righteous as though
[27:21] they never did it in the first place and
[27:23] as righteous as they would hope to be
[27:25] the the the Greek says so a Justified
[27:28] person has the spirit of Christ a
[27:30] Sanctified person has more of the spirit
[27:32] of Christ amen but a holy ghost filled
[27:34] person they have the fullness of Christ
[27:36] Hallelujah in other words the fullness
[27:37] in their soul and then in their minds
[27:39] their daily uh striving to keep God's
[27:42] spirit filling their minds amen
[27:44] therefore Brethren verse 12 we are
[27:46] debtors not to the flesh to live after
[27:48] the
[27:49] flesh now I thought I'd share this you
[27:51] know you don't owe your flesh nothing
[27:54] Hallelujah I just want to pull this out
[27:56] of there I thought didn't think about
[27:57] about that till today when I was
[27:58] studying the Bible said you're not a
[28:00] debor to the flesh you don't have to
[28:02] cater to your flesh when was the last
[28:04] time your flesh really did something
[28:05] good for you praise God I can't think of
[28:07] one time where actually did something
[28:09] good for me think about it you know
[28:11] whenever we would give think about the
[28:12] times we've given into our flesh well
[28:14] this would feel good or my flesh might
[28:15] like that you know and it was sin when
[28:18] was the last time it actually benefited
[28:19] us of course it never will the Bible
[28:21] said there's no fruit to any work of
[28:23] Darkness right there's nothing good to
[28:25] it so let's remember we don't owe the
[28:27] fles nothing what we owe is the Bible
[28:29] said we owe God our love hallelujah
[28:32] hallelujah we're debtors to the spirit
[28:34] that's where we owe our allegiance to
[28:36] because Jesus Christ has purchased our
[28:38] souls Hallelujah and so we're debtors to
[28:41] the Holy Spirit and that's what verse 13
[28:43] TI in for if ye live after the flesh you
[28:46] shall die but if you live through the
[28:49] spir I'm sorry but if ye through the
[28:51] spirit do mortify crucify the Deeds of
[28:53] the body ye shall live so that's when
[28:56] you know Church you're really living
[28:58] right like today right when you
[28:59] crucified your desires to to sin you
[29:02] were really living how many enjy really
[29:05] living today amen now think about that
[29:06] the rest of the eight billion people
[29:08] they weren't living because they were
[29:10] feeding their flesh but you and I were
[29:12] living Hallelujah isn't that interesting
[29:14] we're living while we're dying
[29:16] Hallelujah right we're we're we're
[29:18] crucifying the desires of the of sin
[29:20] right desires of Flesh and while we're
[29:22] doing that we're actually living we're
[29:24] living and dying at the same time it's a
[29:27] parad it really is hallelujah because
[29:29] the Bible said you must mortify that
[29:30] means crucify Hallelujah slowly dying
[29:34] but yet also living in the soul praise
[29:37] God you know I I had a couple people
[29:39] this week tell me they saw good things
[29:41] in me you know in one in one one case I
[29:44] was I was helping a student and these
[29:46] these teachers looked at me after I
[29:47] helped the student and they said you
[29:49] know they said Jesse that student was
[29:51] was was uh ordained to be in your class
[29:53] and now these are Christian women
[29:55] denominational they said and I and I
[29:57] said absolutely I believe every I said
[29:59] the footsteps of the righteous are order
[30:00] of the Lord because those teachers saw
[30:03] that child last year and they said that
[30:04] child they need to be in Jesse's class
[30:07] and they saw how I was handling that
[30:08] child now I'm not perfect here by any
[30:10] means but I just thought it was awesome
[30:11] two Christian women say it was really
[30:13] God's will that that child's in your
[30:15] class because you treat them in such a
[30:17] way and then my principal told me that
[30:18] he said I love how you always have that
[30:20] Joy on your face every day Jesse and I
[30:22] turned around him I said you know what
[30:23] principal now I'm not going to use his
[30:24] name but I said you know what principal
[30:26] I said I preach three times a week and
[30:29] all I do is get rehearsals about how
[30:31] much God loves me how I'm forgiven how
[30:33] I'm saved how could I not
[30:36] smile Hallelujah he's like you're right
[30:39] how could I not smile amen he just
[30:41] thanks me for having to smile all around
[30:43] the school amen and that's what that
[30:45] scripture tells me if I'm crucifying you
[30:48] know I'm fighting against sin every day
[30:50] right but as I keep sin under uh under
[30:52] my foot then I'm living so people at at
[30:55] my work they see me living I'm living
[30:57] for Jesus praise God I don't walk around
[31:00] like I'm a dead zombie you know like the
[31:01] Bible says you're you're dead while
[31:03] you're alive right those people those
[31:05] women that live in sin or men that live
[31:06] in sin you're dead while you're alive
[31:08] right but I but we are living through
[31:10] the Life of Christ so I was thankful
[31:12] this week to get two testimonies praise
[31:14] God hallelujah we're not debtors to the
[31:16] flesh we owe God all of our life all of
[31:19] our love all of our songs Hallelujah all
[31:22] of our worship all of our adoration you
[31:24] owe God we owe God all of our heart soul
[31:27] mind and strength so let's enjoy giving
[31:29] it to him praise God hallelujah praise
[31:32] God Amen I love it praise God now that
[31:35] gets into verse 14 so if you read the
[31:38] context of this God is telling us Paul's
[31:41] telling us through God's spirit that if
[31:43] we are crucifying sin if we're trying to
[31:45] overcome sin we are led by the spirit of
[31:48] God the spirit of God will lead you to
[31:50] mortify the Deeds of the Flesh and walk
[31:53] according to the spirit and as the
[31:55] spirit leads you to over overcome this
[31:57] sin or the spirit leads you to overcome
[31:59] that sin that proves you're led by the
[32:02] spirit of God Amen Hallelujah praise God
[32:05] that's that's the context right all
[32:08] these surrounding verses you you know we
[32:09] can pull one out that's true but if you
[32:12] but when you read it you actually get a
[32:13] richer a more Rich understanding of the
[32:16] context right so as we die to our
[32:19] fleshly desires and our sinful Desires
[32:22] in our flesh as we crucify that and live
[32:24] according to the spirit and Obey we are
[32:27] led by the spirit of God hallelujah and
[32:30] that makes us Sons and Daughters of God
[32:33] hallelujah the more obedience we have
[32:35] the more God is leading us hallelujah
[32:37] that's exactly what the scripture tells
[32:39] us hallelujah now and think about that
[32:42] remember we looked at we read this verse
[32:44] I think nature read it on Sunday but
[32:46] Jude verse4 and if you could pull that
[32:48] up there honey so many churches fail in
[32:50] this area they turn Grace into
[32:54] lusciousness they're not even really
[32:56] trying to call things things right and
[32:57] wrong you know the uh is that was that
[33:00] is that the right verse okay yes yeah it
[33:02] was condemnation they turned Grace into
[33:04] L remember remember Sunday night's Bible
[33:06] study you know we don't want to receive
[33:09] Grace in vain we want to receive Grace
[33:11] and it has an impact on us amen right
[33:13] and that will cause us to deny
[33:15] ungodliness amen hallelujah oh I love
[33:18] how the Bible just ties it all together
[33:20] Hallelujah see we're led by the spirit
[33:23] when Grace uh is turning in when Grace
[33:26] is is turning us into a more righteous
[33:29] person it's the spirit of God leading us
[33:31] to obey the word of God and crucify our
[33:34] desires Allelujah amen I love this that
[33:37] means we're the the we're led by the the
[33:39] spirit of God that means we are the sons
[33:41] and daughters of God Amen Hallelujah
[33:44] that means when I first got saved and I
[33:45] threw away all those Snoop Dog albums
[33:47] and Metallica that proved right there I
[33:49] was a Son of God hallelujah because the
[33:52] spirit would lead me to get rid of that
[33:53] trash right amen and since then you know
[33:56] I still I still get rid of things I
[33:58] still I still find God dealing with me
[34:00] in my life in different areas and stop
[34:02] doing this and stop doing that that is
[34:04] absolute proof I am a child of God
[34:06] you're a child of God hallelujah as as
[34:09] the Holy Spirit would make known not to
[34:10] sing Christmas
[34:12] songs right I mean sinful Christmas
[34:14] songs not good old hymns Hallelujah but
[34:16] that's a a good example of a revelation
[34:18] of God leading us to into all
[34:21] righteousness praise God and that proves
[34:23] you're a daughter of God that proves
[34:25] you're a son of God Hallelujah as he
[34:28] leads you into obedience to mortify the
[34:32] things of the flesh Hallelujah so that
[34:34] proves Church we're the bride Hallelujah
[34:36] like I said on that video 110 examples
[34:39] of why we're the bride that's one of
[34:40] them we have the true understanding of
[34:42] Grace leads us into obedience Grace
[34:45] leads us into Holiness now I'm G to try
[34:48] to like I said I want to make it through
[34:49] this chapter if I can by God's grace
[34:51] verse
[34:52] 15 now we're going to get review of a
[34:54] few major doctrines for ye have not
[34:57] receive the Spear of bondage again to
[34:59] fear now let's stop right there the Holy
[35:02] Ghost doesn't lead us into a slavery to
[35:05] dread or Terror now Church you know how
[35:08] many people are terrorized about Jesus's
[35:11] return think about that I'm talking
[35:12] about even Christians not only Sinners
[35:15] but how many Christians even message
[35:17] Believers are are
[35:19] terrified sorry are terrified about his
[35:23] return they're scared but we shouldn't
[35:25] be terrorized about it we should love it
[35:28] praise
[35:29] God I'm glad this water was up here I
[35:31] don't know who put this water up here
[35:32] but thank you actually going to have to
[35:33] drink it
[35:35] tonight so incredibly dry but the Bible
[35:38] said he comes to all them that love is
[35:40] appearing let me look up that verse uh
[35:42] Cas if you can beat me to it I'll give
[35:44] you a dollar no I'm just kidding
[35:46] Hallelujah I wouldn't pay you for I'll
[35:48] pay you in other ways Hallelujah
[35:51] um the scripture uh love is appearing I
[35:54] think it's in
[35:55] Timothy if I'm not not
[35:59] mistaken or maybe it's Titus yeah second
[36:02] Timothy 4:8 henceforth there is laid up
[36:04] for me a crown of righteousness which
[36:06] the Lord the righteous judge shall give
[36:08] me at that day and not to me only but
[36:10] unto all them that also love is
[36:13] appearing so I'm I'm you know I remember
[36:15] years ago remember brother amen and and
[36:18] and we were talking about uh videos
[36:19] YouTubers make and they have dreams and
[36:21] they're trying to scare people into the
[36:23] coming of the Lord and now there there's
[36:25] there is one verse where the bble says I
[36:27] believe it's in Jude where you should
[36:29] pull some out of the fire with fear so
[36:32] there is a small Ministry for that right
[36:35] but not every video not every experience
[36:37] not every day with God is fear fear fear
[36:40] and now look all these years later you
[36:41] know they had plenty of time to get
[36:42] ready right like the point of those
[36:44] videos is to get a clickbait right and
[36:48] they're trying they're trying to predict
[36:49] the day and hour no man knows the day or
[36:51] the hour Hallelujah not even Jesus knows
[36:54] the heavenly father Only Knows praise
[36:56] God
[36:57] so it show it shows now it shows now go
[36:58] back to Romans 8:15 it shows they were
[37:00] under that Spirit of bondage there's
[37:02] Christians that are under the spirit of
[37:04] bondage they live by fear oh God's Gonna
[37:06] blot my name out oh God's GNA get rid of
[37:09] me no of course not God won't do that
[37:11] because God loves you and you love God
[37:13] Hallelujah in other words you know
[37:15] you're a predestinated child of God
[37:17] hallelujah and you know you can't you
[37:19] can't lose your salvation because you
[37:21] know you really love God Amen Hallelujah
[37:24] I passed that a long time ago fearing my
[37:27] losing my salvation I passed that a long
[37:29] time ago I might might have battled that
[37:30] for a little bit but I passed it a long
[37:32] time ago you know why because we're
[37:33] going to get to it God G gives me
[37:35] witness after witness that I am a child
[37:38] of
[37:39] God Amen that's what the Bible says the
[37:43] spirit gives witness that we are the
[37:45] children of God hallelujah I know I'm a
[37:48] Child of God hallelujah and you know
[37:50] what we just need more witnesses of that
[37:52] Hallelujah and God will drive all that
[37:54] fear right out of our Lives amen I don't
[37:56] fear my name being blotted out because
[37:58] God's given me witnesses that I'm a
[38:01] Child of God hallelujah and just like
[38:03] brother R said even if I'm just I'm just
[38:06] the the skin on the bottom of the feet
[38:08] of the Bride I'm still a part of the
[38:10] body of Christ and I've still got every
[38:12] demon under my
[38:14] feet hallelujah praise God I might not
[38:16] be the head of Christ you I might not be
[38:19] the neck or the arms or the the the
[38:21] fingers but if I'm just at the feet I
[38:23] still have every demon power under my
[38:25] feet I'm still an overcomer praise God
[38:28] hallelujah amen I'm kind of jumping
[38:30] ahead but that's why this chapter is a
[38:31] beautiful chapter it's so rich in Mercy
[38:34] I just heard a preacher say it as well
[38:35] this I think it was Tim puit said that
[38:37] Romans 8 might be his F favorite Bible
[38:39] chapter I thought hey we got the same
[38:40] idea there we got the same uh
[38:42] inspiration from the Holy
[38:44] Spirit but ye have received see we
[38:46] haven't received fear if you received
[38:49] fear that wasn't from God and if you
[38:52] received it cast it down praise God Amen
[38:54] and receive this Hallelujah the spirit
[38:57] of
[38:58] adoption whereby we cry ABA father so
[39:02] the Holy Ghost does not lead into lead
[39:04] us into constant dread or Terror of God
[39:08] right it doesn't lead us you know it
[39:10] leads us to crucify our flesh so we can
[39:13] walk in the
[39:14] spirit right and as we're walk in the
[39:17] spirit now we know we're the children of
[39:18] God because we've walked with God's
[39:20] spirit so much that we have so many
[39:22] witnesses that we are the children of
[39:24] God Amen Hallelujah like I just got a a
[39:28] brother from the UK this week he's like
[39:30] can I have your number I gave my
[39:31] telegram number and he pours out this 8
[39:33] minute long video or uh audio about how
[39:36] he loves me and loves my Ministry and
[39:38] I'm called of God and keep doing what
[39:40] you're doing that's just another witness
[39:41] that I'm a Child of God people from over
[39:44] over the seas want to tell me how much
[39:46] they love me and we never even
[39:48] met I love that in other words God will
[39:51] give you witnesses that you're a child
[39:53] of God just surrender to him just walk
[39:56] in this Spirit and the spirit will
[39:57] testify to you amen don't you love that
[40:00] when God testifies to you God tells you
[40:03] who you
[40:04] are that's that's what we're getting to
[40:06] tonight that's what the Christian has
[40:08] God tells you who you are and even
[40:11] demons sometimes will tell you who you
[40:12] are right isn't that what brother BR
[40:14] brother BR had those two uh uh Sorcerers
[40:18] the fortune tellers tell him he was born
[40:19] under a
[40:21] sign right and then sometimes Church
[40:24] Sinners will tell you you're a real
[40:25] Christian
[40:27] Hallelujah is that right remember the
[40:29] woman with the remember the woman with
[40:30] the spirit of divination she said these
[40:32] men are the Servants of God they tell
[40:34] forth the word of God in truth oh I like
[40:37] it when even Devils have to tell you who
[40:39] you are amen hallelujah I love it when
[40:41] Sinners have to tell you you're a real
[40:43] Christian hallelujah amen I see if I
[40:46] never met another Christian I surely met
[40:48] one when I met you
[40:51] Hallelujah Glory thank God Amen see
[40:54] we've received the spirit of adoption
[40:56] and that means the relationship as a son
[40:59] or daughter of
[41:01] God whereby now notice what does this
[41:03] make you do it makes you cry out ABA
[41:06] father that's the personal Daddy it's
[41:08] kind of like Daddy
[41:09] Daddy it's the personal uh relationship
[41:13] to the father
[41:14] here let me uh pull up that actual verse
[41:17] then the ABA father because I haven't I
[41:20] forgot to look that one up
[41:23] today there it is okay Aba just means
[41:26] father the customary title used for God
[41:28] In Prayer so heavenly father so it's
[41:31] just it's just the common father so
[41:33] Daddy's or dad what do you call me dad
[41:35] now call me Daddy call me daddy nobody
[41:38] calls me Papa right so gotta stay with
[41:40] what the what's the customary title for
[41:42] Dad so I call my dad Dad hey Dad I sent
[41:45] him a text the other day love you Dad
[41:47] just saying hi he didn't reply but
[41:49] hopefully he read it hopefully it pops
[41:51] up on his
[41:52] iPhone but ye receive the spirit of
[41:54] adoption whereby we cry ABA father
[41:58] Hallelujah so being a Christian doesn't
[42:00] lead you into torment and Dread and
[42:03] Terror it leads you into peace but it
[42:06] also leads you into following the spirit
[42:07] of God and overcoming sin in your
[42:10] members praise God and I'm just going to
[42:13] lay this in there you know yesterday I
[42:14] put out a video for this is a quote
[42:16] video brother brand said uh we should
[42:18] never name call other Christians right
[42:21] because he gives the example uh brandom
[42:23] Tabernacle people not everybody but some
[42:25] people in the church were calling
[42:26] another message Church Junior Jackson
[42:28] Church Dead Birds because they operated
[42:31] the gift
[42:32] differently so see you know we got to be
[42:34] careful and I I believe we got the right
[42:36] Spirit right I believe our church has
[42:37] the right Spirit but just a reminder if
[42:39] we've got the spirit of God let's be
[42:41] loving especially uh especially with
[42:43] other message churches right and that's
[42:46] really for me okay I'm preaching to me
[42:48] tonight right uh let's not call people
[42:50] dead birds and things like that but I
[42:52] want to say this if if someone's a a
[42:54] foolish virgin in a message Church their
[42:57] soul is is is dead as far as it hasn't
[43:00] been quickened to the fullness of the
[43:01] Holy Spirit right right because you got
[43:03] to be quickened Hallelujah you got to be
[43:05] your your Soul's got to be filled with
[43:07] this power of God hallelujah all right
[43:10] now now the true children of God will
[43:13] cry out now this word cry we we cry
[43:16] father this word cry means to cry aloud
[43:19] and speak with a loud voice now isn't
[43:20] that something doesn't mean like Lord I
[43:23] love you it's not a whisper it's a cry
[43:27] Hallelujah you got to lift up your voice
[43:29] now most now most of us lift up our
[43:30] voice sometimes here but if you don't
[43:32] hear you got to do it
[43:34] somewhere because that that's what the
[43:36] Bible says when you got the spirit of
[43:38] adoption you cry out to god father oh
[43:41] God Heavenly Father Lord God hear me
[43:43] Jesus right Hallelujah and that's where
[43:47] a lot of churches fail that don't
[43:49] believe in the Holy Ghost because they
[43:50] don't cry out to God they never raise
[43:52] their voice to God that's why brother
[43:55] said crying is important brother R said
[43:57] God loves to hear his children cry out
[43:59] to
[44:00] him
[44:03] Hallelujah right and so you know it's
[44:05] it's
[44:06] leoan uh we'd say make Believers that
[44:09] don't cry out because they don't have
[44:11] need of nothing right they're rich
[44:13] increased with Goods have need of
[44:15] nothing they don't have to cry out to
[44:17] God now think about that would you
[44:19] rather be that way where you never to
[44:20] cry out for your financial needs and the
[44:22] money never gets tight you never cry out
[44:24] to God or would you rather have it where
[44:26] sometimes money's kind of tight or
[44:27] you're sick and you got to cry out to
[44:29] God which one would you rather have I'd
[44:31] rather have the less money and crying
[44:33] out to God right because I mean that
[44:36] that's the condition of this age now
[44:38] here in America and many Western
[44:40] civilizations right and some of the E
[44:42] many of the Eastern one too especially
[44:43] China and Hong Kong they're in really
[44:45] good conditions financially but here
[44:48] this means we cry out to God we we cry
[44:51] we use a loud voice we have needs and so
[44:54] we got to cry out to our our father so
[44:57] when you receive the Holy Spirit it
[44:59] notice it's the spirit of adoption
[45:02] that's why I say anyone who's born again
[45:04] is already
[45:05] adopted you're already adopted you've
[45:08] already got
[45:09] it the Bible said you've received that's
[45:12] past tense and the church said if you
[45:15] remember first grade Ed means past tense
[45:17] because I taught that this year if it
[45:20] there an ed on the end of a word it
[45:21] already happened it's past tense you've
[45:24] received the spirit IR of adoption and
[45:27] that spirit makes you cry out to your
[45:29] father father hear me I need you I uh uh
[45:32] uh uh I don't know what to pray for Lord
[45:35] pray through me minister to your people
[45:38] help your people
[45:39] hallelujah but see the lean Spirit uh
[45:43] the lazy spirit will not allow people to
[45:46] cry out to God so we got to keep crying
[45:48] out to
[45:50] God hallelujah verse 15 we read that now
[45:55] this of course this adoption means the
[45:56] nature and condition of the true
[45:58] disciples in Christ who by receiving the
[46:01] spirit of God into their souls become
[46:02] sons of God all right now look at that
[46:06] you're led by the spirit of God when
[46:07] you're overcoming sin then you've got
[46:10] the spirit of adoption in you makes me
[46:11] makes you cry out and now verse 16 the
[46:14] spirit itself Bears witness with our
[46:16] spirit notice a lowercase s that's your
[46:19] mind that's why I told you I'm it didn't
[46:23] believe it at first but now my mind is
[46:24] convinced sister who that I'm a Child of
[46:27] God I don't worry about going to hell
[46:29] anymore right I might have at some I
[46:31] don't even know if I did but at some
[46:33] point I might have wondered am I really
[46:34] a Believer or not but after all these
[46:36] years amen after all these years of
[46:39] having Witnesses of the Holy Spirit I
[46:41] know I'm a Child of God
[46:43] hallelujah amen and then the the Holy
[46:46] Spirit Bears witness with your mind that
[46:49] we are the children of
[46:51] God hallelujah every now and then we get
[46:54] somebody in here who thinks a child of
[46:55] God but maybe it turns out we don't know
[46:57] if they are I tell you I feel like
[47:00] everybody here now we know there's a
[47:01] child of God hallelujah why because we
[47:04] got witnesses we see God do things in
[47:08] their life move them by the Holy Spirit
[47:10] obey the word of God
[47:12] overcome uh experience the joy of the
[47:14] Lord experience the the love of God we
[47:16] see the fruits of the holy spirit in
[47:18] people's lives Hallelujah with with
[47:21] Christian interactions praise God even
[47:22] when we disagree we can do it with the
[47:24] love of Christ Hallelujah amen we got
[47:27] witnesses God gives a witness a
[47:30] testimony with our spirits that we are
[47:33] the children of God am
[47:37] amen so see church we have to have a
[47:40] witness or sign or some experience from
[47:42] the holy ghost that we are the children
[47:45] of God so let me ask you this has God
[47:47] ever shown you you're his
[47:49] child Hallelujah now that's blessings
[47:53] but it's also
[47:54] spankings has God ever rebuked you for
[47:57] we just gave an example right with the
[47:58] Christmas music has God ever rebuked you
[48:00] for doing something you shouldn't do and
[48:03] you turn it down real quick right or as
[48:05] soon as you could by God's grace because
[48:06] you're fighting a
[48:07] battle that that's a great question to
[48:10] ask Hallelujah and that's how you'll
[48:12] know you're a child of God when God
[48:14] gives you a witness you're my child so
[48:16] you can't act like those other
[48:18] people right you can't do that I'm not
[48:21] going to let you do that I'm going to
[48:23] convict you so hard until you repent
[48:26] amen hallelujah praise God I'm going to
[48:29] compel you I'm going to constrain you
[48:32] until you finally surrender
[48:35] Hallelujah and you mortify the Deeds of
[48:38] your flesh Hallelujah I won't won't let
[48:40] you get away with that Hallelujah and
[48:42] then you come out of that thank God I'm
[48:43] clean now I experience more joy in my
[48:45] life that's just another witness you're
[48:47] his child
[48:49] hallelujah amen that's right church has
[48:52] he ever shown you your his child of
[48:54] course he has Hallelujah and you got to
[48:56] cling to those you got to cling to those
[48:58] remember because the Satan's going to
[48:59] try to bring all these Witnesses you're
[49:01] not a child of God so you got to keep
[49:03] your spirit focus on those testimonies
[49:05] that you are a child of
[49:07] God right remember when you did that
[49:09] remember when you did that like they say
[49:11] when Satan reminds you of your past
[49:12] remind him of his future he gets tossed
[49:15] into the lake of fire thank God and all
[49:19] Heaven Will Rejoice Hallelujah when
[49:21] Lucifer gets cast in the Lake of Fire no
[49:24] more trials no more battles for us
[49:26] hallelujah amen so that's what we thank
[49:28] God for I thank God for witnesses that
[49:31] we are children of God you know I don't
[49:33] think I told my wife this but maybe I
[49:34] have but the more I live with my wife
[49:36] the more I know she's the daughter of
[49:39] God right I just I see it wow she's a
[49:41] real Christian I mean of course I always
[49:43] knew she was but what did I get I get
[49:45] more witnesses 20 years worth of
[49:48] witnesses she's a daughter of God she's
[49:50] a child of God because she loves the
[49:52] word of God she obeys the word of
[49:54] God
[49:56] Hallelujah verse 17 and if children I
[49:59] love this part you're going to like this
[50:00] part too then your
[50:03] heirs Hees of God and now I I ended one
[50:06] of the sermons with this thought and
[50:08] jooy hirs with Christ so as a wife as
[50:12] the wife of Christ you have some
[50:14] inheritance that other people won't have
[50:16] in heaven because they're not the wife
[50:19] right there's going to be Unix we know
[50:21] there's Unix uh I think brother amen was
[50:23] talking about that the 144,000 will be
[50:25] Unix the Bible says in Revelation the
[50:28] Bible said they'll be Unix unto God they
[50:30] won't be the bride they'll be Unix right
[50:33] Hallelujah the foolish virgin isn't the
[50:35] bride in the parable remember the
[50:37] foolish virgin were the the handmaids to
[50:39] the bride but they they never made it
[50:41] they never made it to the wedding
[50:44] ceremony right so they they were not in
[50:46] the wedding ceremony there's no way they
[50:48] can be the
[50:49] bride right you got to be there the
[50:51] bride is going to be at her wedding
[50:53] reception praise God the bride is going
[50:55] to be at her wedding ceremony Church she
[50:58] don't get locked out if that man loves
[51:00] her he's going to be there to open the
[51:01] door himself he'll beat down in the door
[51:03] do whatever to get that bride in amen
[51:05] that's his love he Delights in her amen
[51:08] like Simon said there's only one that's
[51:10] my dove that's my undefiled she's
[51:13] beautiful from head to toe praise
[51:15] God he'll do anything in his power to
[51:18] get that bride in
[51:19] there so see Church you and I get
[51:21] rewards as the bride other people will
[51:24] not get now now remember don't forget
[51:26] this if so be that we suffer with him
[51:29] that we may also be glorified together
[51:32] so here we get the idea we must suffer
[51:34] in order to
[51:36] inherit and if you've been a Christian
[51:38] long enough you've suffered through some
[51:40] form of persecution whether it's neglect
[51:42] being kicked out of your house made fun
[51:44] of lied on right I've had many I've had
[51:48] numerous of those Hallelujah mocked your
[51:52] name drugged through the the dirt I get
[51:54] that a lot on on the internet let them
[51:57] do whatever they want cuz I know my name
[51:59] is not going in the mud I know my name
[52:01] is in the Lamb's Book of Life
[52:04] Hallelujah he why because he gave me
[52:06] Witnesses of it praise God he show he's
[52:09] testified to me amen just like God
[52:11] testified to the devil you know God
[52:13] testifies to each one of us that we are
[52:15] the children of God
[52:16] hallelujah amen I believe God lets
[52:20] everybody know which side they're on I
[52:21] just I never had that thought before
[52:23] till right now didn't uh uh didn't
[52:27] uh well when did Judas find out he was a
[52:30] son of predition was that while he was
[52:31] alive or after oh yeah Jesus told him
[52:34] you're the betrayer that's right that's
[52:36] right Jesus told him you'll betray me
[52:38] see he knew he knew right Cain knew
[52:41] right God told Cain you're going to be a
[52:42] werer I'm driving you from my presence
[52:44] is that
[52:45] right so I believe amen I believe you're
[52:48] going to get Witnesses one way or the
[52:49] other let's get the witness from the
[52:51] holy spirit that we are the children of
[52:53] God hallelujah amen
[52:56] and then the Bible says then you've also
[52:58] remember don't forget this the Bible
[52:59] said you've got to prove which side
[53:01] you're on make your calling an election
[53:03] sure amen hallelujah in other words you
[53:06] can't get lazy church I want to preach a
[53:08] sermon on that all those scriptures from
[53:10] the Old Testament where the Bible said
[53:12] once Israel got uh the Bible said when
[53:15] they got fat which means when they got
[53:17] rich and food they forgot about God I
[53:20] going to preach just a whole Sermon Just
[53:21] it's a simple layer to see in sermon but
[53:23] I just want to remind us we got to make
[53:24] sure we don't get lazy on God Amen right
[53:27] just a a humble reminder right I'm not
[53:29] saying we are I don't think you are if
[53:31] you're lazy you wouldn't go to the
[53:32] church you wouldn't pray you wouldn't
[53:33] sing but it just it just it struck me
[53:36] the other day wow like that just struck
[53:38] me aresh that's going to be our battle
[53:40] to Satan's going to try to make us lazy
[53:42] but we can't be lazy we must be diligent
[53:45] we must prove to the enemy Hallelujah we
[53:47] must prove to the enemy that God's given
[53:49] us Witnesses praise God that we are the
[53:52] children of
[53:53] God but remember before Glory you must
[53:56] have suffering so this world has
[53:59] blessings and benefits and Witnesses but
[54:01] it's also it's also a witness to suffer
[54:03] for Christ's name that's also a witness
[54:06] we must have from the holy spirit
[54:08] because it says it right there in verse
[54:09] 17 if you want to be a joint air you
[54:11] must suffer like the your husband
[54:14] suffered and church many times we see
[54:16] this when people are dying they're
[54:17] suffering and you know the devil's
[54:19] saying you need to recant God don't want
[54:21] to heal you but see you overcome that
[54:23] people overcome that by saying I'm a
[54:25] Christian and if I must suffer this way
[54:27] I'll go that way remember Elisha had to
[54:29] suffer that way Elisha had an awful
[54:31] disease whereby he died right and he had
[54:34] to go that way had to go the way of
[54:36] suffering right brother Braham got to go
[54:38] just you know no doubt he suffered but a
[54:40] lot of it he was unconscious from the
[54:41] car accident you know but everybody has
[54:43] a different way remember brother James
[54:45] Browning uh I talked about him you know
[54:47] he said Lord he he prayed Lord I don't
[54:49] want to suffer when I die but he didn't
[54:51] which was it was a wonderful testimony
[54:53] to God's grace but he suffered more
[54:55] during the
[54:57] Lifetime right like longer years of
[55:01] suffering so whatever suffering God has
[55:03] for us we must accept it praise God and
[55:06] we'll overcome through it praise God and
[55:08] we must remember this is what's what's
[55:11] helping us to achieve the glory which we
[55:13] will receive Hereafter praise God this
[55:16] suffering is producing Christlike
[55:18] character Jesus learned obedience
[55:20] through the S things he suffered the
[55:22] bride will learn obedience through the
[55:23] things she suffers amen
[55:26] right how many can say Amen the the
[55:27] things you've learned many times we
[55:29] learn through suffering we have to lose
[55:32] something we have to uh experience a
[55:34] loss we have to experience a
[55:35] disappointment and that will keep us on
[55:38] the right path longer right more
[55:41] faithful more
[55:43] diligent Hallelujah so don't forget that
[55:45] this remember this is a chapter of great
[55:47] promises no condemnation all things work
[55:49] together but don't forget this you must
[55:51] suffer in order to be glorified together
[55:54] oh it's always that wonderful balance
[55:55] praise God hallelujah don't forget the
[55:58] balance of yes we have victories and
[56:01] testimonies but we must also have the
[56:03] testimony of suffering Verse 18 for I
[56:06] reckon which means calculate Verse 18 I
[56:08] calculate that the sufferings of this
[56:10] present are not worthy to be compared
[56:13] with the glory which shall be revealed
[56:16] in us hallelujah so inheriting Eternal
[56:20] rewards with Christ is easily greater it
[56:23] can be calculated it's easier greater
[56:26] than temporary
[56:28] sufferings right you can calculate that
[56:31] Hallelujah and how can you calculate it
[56:33] uh let's list some of the rewards for
[56:35] the joint heirs we get eternal life the
[56:38] Bible
[56:39] says Jesus said I'll share my glory with
[56:41] them in John 17:22 can you pull that up
[56:44] John
[56:45] 17:22 while you're turning there I'm
[56:47] going to go to Second Corinthians
[56:48] 68 let's look at a little list of uh
[56:52] joint I'm sorry of specific rewards some
[56:54] of them will be of course a
[56:56] review got that one yeah and the glory
[56:59] which thou gavest me I have given them
[57:01] that they may be one even as we are what
[57:04] did he do with the glory he gave you the
[57:06] glory I remember when I was I'm always
[57:08] going to use sister H because she's on
[57:10] the front row but I remember when the
[57:11] glory fell on her that day she got the
[57:13] Holy Ghost and that Glory just keep
[57:15] building in your life sister Hallelujah
[57:18] right in case you've ever all the time
[57:21] the glory falls on you right he shares
[57:23] his glory with you praise God God
[57:25] Amen anytime somebody says they enjoyed
[57:28] my sermon the glory did it not me
[57:30] Hallelujah it was the glory it wasn't me
[57:32] I there's no glory in me as far as my
[57:34] own human flesh but it's God's glory and
[57:36] Jesus said I give them the glory that's
[57:39] a reward Hallelujah the glory
[57:42] amen also you get riches 2 Corinthians
[57:46] 88:9 for we know the grace of our Lord
[57:48] Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet
[57:50] for your sakes he became poor that ye
[57:53] through his poverty might be
[57:56] rich so you get spiritual riches and
[57:58] I'll go as far as saying you'll get
[58:00] natural riches later as well what I mean
[58:02] is like a home in the Millennium future
[58:04] home in the uh you actual home in the
[58:07] future home right the pyramid uh the the
[58:10] the New Jerusalem you get a home in the
[58:12] New Jerusalem
[58:14] Hallelujah and then you get uh you get
[58:17] the rule nations with the rod of iron we
[58:18] don't have to read these this these are
[58:19] the ones I I preached many times
[58:21] Revelation 226 and 27 wow that's a
[58:24] that's a going air right because we know
[58:26] Christ has a rod right Christ has a rod
[58:28] of iron he says you get a rod of iron if
[58:31] you
[58:32] overcome Glory praise God then you get
[58:35] to rule cities in Luke 19:17 you get to
[58:38] rule a city Hallelujah you might never
[58:41] be mayor here but you might be mayor
[58:43] over there by God's
[58:45] grace and I'd rather rule over there
[58:47] praise God because it's just chaos over
[58:50] here hallelujah you'll have the power of
[58:52] obedience over there
[58:53] Hallelujah you another reward you get
[58:56] you get accepted in the Beloved so the
[58:59] bosom of Heaven you are accepted in the
[59:02] bosom of Heaven they're not going to
[59:04] turn you away Saints you're a part of
[59:06] that bosom Hal you're part of the love
[59:07] of God
[59:09] hallelujah because you were chosen in
[59:11] Christ before the foundation of the
[59:14] world I'm accepted in heaven amen Heaven
[59:17] won't turn me away Jesus won't say I
[59:19] never knew you he'll say I've accepted
[59:21] you
[59:22] Hallelujah here's a place for you in
[59:24] heaven
[59:25] Hallelujah you get one or two crowns
[59:28] either the martyr's crown in Revelation
[59:30] 2:10 or the Crown of Life or crown of
[59:33] righteousness as James 1 vers2 says you
[59:36] get a crown because you're a joint Heir
[59:39] well remember Jesus comes back with many
[59:40] crowns in Revelation 19 Hallelujah but
[59:44] see you are joint Heir you got a
[59:48] crown and then you get a white robe
[59:50] Revelation 79 the voice said uh do you
[59:54] know know who this is John said I don't
[59:55] know who this is this is the bride from
[59:57] every nation Kindred tongue and and and
[1:00:00] people and language Hallelujah and
[1:00:02] they're all dressed in Robes of white
[1:00:05] hallelujah amen so now I can picture I
[1:00:08] can picture Malachi he's got a nice robe
[1:00:09] on it's pure white it's not off-white
[1:00:12] it's pure white it's got a crown and if
[1:00:16] Lord darries he can have more jewels in
[1:00:18] that crown for winning

[1:00:22] cast out devils you ever come to church
[1:00:25] upset and the music Set You Free well
[1:00:27] that was God using his
[1:00:29] gift Hallelujah that's right that's what
[1:00:32] David did it as well praise God it
[1:00:34] drives away the the discouraging spirit
[1:00:37] amen it drives away that depression
[1:00:40] Spirit it drives it away in the name of
[1:00:41] Jesus
[1:00:43] Hallelujah and then now you got your
[1:00:45] crown you got your white robe and then
[1:00:48] the last thing now this I only had a
[1:00:51] little bit of time to find this but the
[1:00:52] last thing on the list was a throne
[1:00:55] the Bible said Thrones were given them
[1:00:56] in judgment so wow not only does Jesus
[1:00:59] have a throne you have a
[1:01:02] throne Hallelujah some people like to
[1:01:05] build their Throne right now but don't
[1:01:07] worry about building a throne now you
[1:01:09] let Jesus build you one later praise God
[1:01:11] right don't make yourself a fancy Throne
[1:01:13] at your house you know but save it for
[1:01:16] later because we said it on Sunday the
[1:01:18] Saints will judge the earth and the
[1:01:20] Saints will judge
[1:01:22] Angels remember that Queen think about
[1:01:25] this church by I just thought of this
[1:01:27] that's simple it's simple the queen of
[1:01:30] the South will judge all the people that
[1:01:31] lived a thousand years after her and she
[1:01:34] never even met them now what does that
[1:01:36] mean that means you and I may judge
[1:01:38] people we've never
[1:01:40] met because just because of our
[1:01:42] sacrifice God will need a witness and
[1:01:44] he'll raise up the queen of South he'll
[1:01:46] raise up Sister Zer he'll raise up
[1:01:48] Sister haa raise up Sister AAA I'll use
[1:01:51] all the sisters
[1:01:53] now and you you might God might use your
[1:01:55] life to judge somebody who had a same Ty
[1:01:59] type of experience but you overcame they
[1:02:02] didn't why because you followed the
[1:02:04] leading of the spirit of God Amen praise
[1:02:08] God Amen now think about I think it'll
[1:02:10] be many of our high school friends is I
[1:02:11] think that's what I think you
[1:02:15] know you know because we're around them
[1:02:17] all the time but then they heard about
[1:02:19] all how we got saved or maybe some
[1:02:21] people that used to be in our
[1:02:23] churches but now remember the queen of
[1:02:25] the South it was her great sacrifice to
[1:02:27] travel so far that's why I think God
[1:02:30] might bless CA that way too and Vang
[1:02:33] they traveled very far see people might
[1:02:34] have said well I'll just marry somebody
[1:02:36] close and they might have married the
[1:02:38] wrong person I'm talking about a sinner
[1:02:40] right but vang's like I'm not gonna
[1:02:42] marry just
[1:02:43] anybody maybe he's smiling right
[1:02:45] now he he was willing to go to any
[1:02:49] lengths Hallelujah that but that's his
[1:02:52] testimony that's going to be his
[1:02:53] testimony praise God
[1:02:55] amen and pay the
[1:02:57] doy right well I couldn't pay that I'm
[1:02:59] not going to pay that for a wife I'll
[1:03:00] just marry so and so well see God's got
[1:03:03] to have somebody who went the right
[1:03:05] route who did righteousness and God will
[1:03:07] raise them up and they'll be robed in
[1:03:09] right white how have they'll sit on a
[1:03:11] throne and they'll have a crown on their
[1:03:13] head Hallelujah joint HS with Christ
[1:03:15] hallelujah oh that ought to make a
[1:03:17] Baptist shout hallelujah amen but it
[1:03:20] can't because well it might but they
[1:03:22] won't be in the bride unless they come
[1:03:23] out of that Baptist
[1:03:25] theology they got to come out of that
[1:03:27] Baptist theology now Romans 8:19 for the
[1:03:30] earnest expectation that means the
[1:03:33] anxious persistent
[1:03:37] expectation okay of the creature now
[1:03:40] they're speaking of nature now animals
[1:03:42] and
[1:03:44] plants I imagine mostly animals because
[1:03:46] they have some type of emotion right
[1:03:48] they have some type of
[1:03:50] spirit it waits for the manifestations
[1:03:53] of the sons of God
[1:03:55] God
[1:03:58] right Hallelujah
[1:04:00] so the glory is so great that's going to
[1:04:03] be revealed in us uh there's currently a
[1:04:06] anxiousness on nature waiting for the
[1:04:09] manifestation of the sons of
[1:04:12] God now there's two thoughts to this and
[1:04:15] I'll tell you which one I stand on some
[1:04:17] people say the manifestation of the sons
[1:04:19] of God is the squeeze right when we
[1:04:21] really get the third pole on us now I
[1:04:24] don't don't really believe that I
[1:04:26] believe we already are manifested sons
[1:04:28] of
[1:04:29] God right I already believe that and you
[1:04:32] know why because of this chapter we'll
[1:04:34] get to
[1:04:35] it because the Bible tells us when these
[1:04:38] sons are going to be
[1:04:39] manifested right and I even saw brother
[1:04:42] Ram stopped saying it after about about
[1:04:45] 1961 he stopped using this this way
[1:04:48] where the the the squeeze was going to
[1:04:50] be the manifested sons of God I believe
[1:04:52] we already are manifested aren't you
[1:04:54] manifesting Christ on your job aren't
[1:04:56] you Daughters of God manifesting Christ
[1:04:58] aren't you a Son of God manifesting
[1:04:59] God's love yes absolutely I'm already
[1:05:02] manifesting God's love now will there be
[1:05:05] a fullness of Pentecost in the bride yes
[1:05:06] that's Joel 2 23- 26 that's what the
[1:05:09] Bible says hallelujah all the years that
[1:05:11] were lost will be restored back amen all
[1:05:14] the years of Lost in the book of Acts
[1:05:16] it'll be restored back right before the
[1:05:17] Rapture praise God hallelujah I believe
[1:05:19] that
[1:05:21] amen but notice cre the creature
[1:05:24] the animal kingdom is waiting for the
[1:05:27] manifestation of the sons of
[1:05:29] God okay now go down to verse 23 because
[1:05:33] this verse is what proves the
[1:05:35] manifestation of the sons of God is when
[1:05:37] we get new bodies it's the fullness of
[1:05:39] the adoption that's what it's waiting
[1:05:40] for right because right now men what do
[1:05:43] they do they destroy nature right they
[1:05:45] go hunting they kill animals or whatever
[1:05:47] you know they
[1:05:48] just creation is in a is in a difficult
[1:05:51] spot it's in an anxious spot right it's
[1:05:53] not in a it's not a it's not a happy
[1:05:55] spot right uh 23 not only they but
[1:05:59] ourselves also which have the first
[1:06:01] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves
[1:06:03] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[1:06:04] adoption to it the Redemption of our
[1:06:07] body so see nature is waiting for the
[1:06:11] adopted sons and then the Bible says we
[1:06:14] we're waiting for the adopted Sons the
[1:06:16] fullness of
[1:06:18] adoption okay and when do we get the
[1:06:21] fullness of adoption when we get a brand
[1:06:22] new body
[1:06:25] Hallelujah
[1:06:27] okay okay now go back to verse 19 I'll
[1:06:30] read it again for the earnest
[1:06:31] expectation the anxious expectation of
[1:06:34] the creature waiteth for the
[1:06:36] manifestation of the sons of
[1:06:38] God now we already are sons of God 1
[1:06:41] John 32 says beloved now are we the sons
[1:06:44] of God everybody say now now we
[1:06:48] are okay uh Galatians 4:6 says because
[1:06:51] ye are Sons you already are
[1:06:54] you've already got the spirit of
[1:06:56] adoption I already got the spirit that
[1:06:58] I'm a Son of God right you've got the
[1:07:01] spirit you're a daughter of
[1:07:03] God I got the spirit that tells me that
[1:07:06] but the final part of adoption doesn't
[1:07:08] happen until I get a new body hallelujah
[1:07:11] amen now verse 20 Romans 820 thank you
[1:07:13] casa good job we'll go back to that
[1:07:14] verse a little bit for the creature was
[1:07:16] made subject to vanity or
[1:07:19] fraility okay so animal nature Kingdom
[1:07:22] it's frail
[1:07:24] not willingly they didn't want that
[1:07:26] animals didn't want that who plunged
[1:07:28] animals into that Adam and Eve right but
[1:07:31] by reason of him who had subjected the
[1:07:33] same in Hope right by reason of Adam and
[1:07:37] Eve but notice There's Hope Hallelujah
[1:07:39] There's Hope amen although Nature's
[1:07:42] groaning although we're groaning there
[1:07:44] is hope Hallelujah in other words
[1:07:46] there's coming a new creation hallelujah
[1:07:48] hallelujah praise God he said behold I
[1:07:51] make all things new Hallelujah what is
[1:07:54] that hope it's the Millennium and the
[1:07:56] future home praise God Amen Hallelujah
[1:08:01] Romans 821 because the creature itself
[1:08:04] shall also be delivered so see now we
[1:08:06] know when the manifestation of the sons
[1:08:08] of God is when the creatures delivered
[1:08:11] from the bondage of corruption when are
[1:08:13] animals going to stop corrupting when
[1:08:15] eternal life sets in so probably the
[1:08:17] future home right because the Bible
[1:08:19] makes it look like a child may die a
[1:08:21] hundred years old in the Millennium
[1:08:23] that's what it looks like in Isaiah 65
[1:08:24] if I'm not mistaken or 66 one of
[1:08:28] those so that well if it looks like a
[1:08:31] child could die maybe an animal could
[1:08:32] die in the Millennium but I know some of
[1:08:34] them are going to live a thousand years
[1:08:36] right they won't have to
[1:08:37] die so it looks like uh when is when is
[1:08:42] the creature delivered from corruption
[1:08:44] no longer dying it would have to be the
[1:08:46] future home
[1:08:48] right and when do they deliver Church
[1:08:50] into the Glorious Liberty of the
[1:08:52] children of God
[1:08:55] verse 22 tells us for we know that the
[1:08:57] whole creation granth and travaileth in
[1:09:00] pain together until now so all of
[1:09:03] creation is groaning humans animals
[1:09:05] right the whole nature it's groaning it
[1:09:07] wants to have a state where it's no
[1:09:09] longer corrupted praise God but the
[1:09:11] Bible says your soul is Born Again by
[1:09:14] The Incorruptible word of God Amen so
[1:09:17] your soul is Incorruptible praise God
[1:09:20] you that's why you're already adopted in
[1:09:22] the family of God you've already got the
[1:09:24] spirit of adoption Hallelujah because
[1:09:27] the Bible said you're born again with
[1:09:28] The Incorruptible word of God hallelujah
[1:09:31] oh my verse 23 and not only they but
[1:09:35] ourselves also which have the first
[1:09:37] fruits so see we got the first fruits of
[1:09:39] the spirit amen our soul is filled with
[1:09:41] the Holy Spirit but guess what our mind
[1:09:43] needs filled with the Holy Spirit I mean
[1:09:46] permanently and then your body is going
[1:09:48] to be led by the Holy Spirit Hallelujah
[1:09:50] when you get a glorified body amen so
[1:09:53] see we we just got the first fruits we
[1:09:55] just got the filling of it now in the
[1:09:57] soul but it it's it's going to extend to
[1:09:59] a perfect mind and then a perfect body
[1:10:02] hallelujah
[1:10:04] amen even we ourselves grown within
[1:10:07] ourselves so he says we're groan now
[1:10:09] that means we're not delivered from
[1:10:10] corruption right now waiting for the
[1:10:13] adoption to it the Redemption of our
[1:10:16] body okay so we already have the spirit
[1:10:18] of adoption but we're waiting for the
[1:10:20] finality of adoption which is a brand
[1:10:23] new body when I got all three parts of
[1:10:26] the Holy Spirit can I say it like that I
[1:10:27] got a fullness of the holy ghost in my
[1:10:29] soul I got a fullness of the holy ghost
[1:10:31] in my mind and I got a fullness of the
[1:10:32] holy spirit in my body
[1:10:35] hallelujah
[1:10:37] amen a't that beautiful I love Paul's
[1:10:40] writings It's So Glorious uh Romans 8:24
[1:10:43] for we are saved by hope right faith
[1:10:46] hope charity these three right we're
[1:10:48] hoping we have hope is a good thing
[1:10:50] right but hope that is seen is not not
[1:10:54] hope okay so we can see it it's not hope
[1:10:58] right we're not hoping for the message
[1:10:59] of the hour we already see the message
[1:11:01] of the hour we know the Lord Jesus
[1:11:03] Christ baptism we know God's one person
[1:11:05] we're not hoping for that we got that
[1:11:07] hallelujah we're hoping for a brand new
[1:11:09] body Hallelujah right and we got we have
[1:11:12] that Living Hope for what a man seeth
[1:11:14] why do you yet he hoped for right so if
[1:11:17] we see it already it's not hoping hoping
[1:11:20] is what we don't see verse
[1:11:24] but if we hope for that we see not then
[1:11:26] we do with patience wait for so so so
[1:11:28] Paul tells us be patient for the
[1:11:32] adoption be patient for a brand new body
[1:11:35] don't get impatient be patient for it
[1:11:38] praise God all right now brother Braham
[1:11:42] tells us now go back to Galatians 4:6 if
[1:11:44] you don't remember this this is in the
[1:11:45] church age book brother Braham says uh
[1:11:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost must not
[1:11:50] come from you or me he said it must come
[1:11:53] according to the Bible it must be thus
[1:11:55] sayith the
[1:11:56] Lord his first verse is Acts 19 1-7 how
[1:12:01] he said Paul said have you received the
[1:12:02] Holy Ghost since you believed they said
[1:12:04] we didn't even know there was a holy
[1:12:05] ghost he's showing you got to have the
[1:12:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul
[1:12:10] but then brother R he ends that section
[1:12:12] by saying let me give you the triumphal
[1:12:15] Capstone on the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:18] Ghost Hallelujah this is it right here
[1:12:20] so this is the Caps I wish I had a cap
[1:12:22] well I got a cap right here
[1:12:24] so cap so this verse is the cap on the
[1:12:27] filling of the Holy Ghost that works out
[1:12:29] pretty good
[1:12:30] Hallelujah this verse is the cap because
[1:12:34] you are Sons God has sent forth the
[1:12:37] spirit of his son into your hearts
[1:12:40] crying ABA father in other words God
[1:12:44] always knew you were a son God always
[1:12:47] knew you were his daughter and he capped
[1:12:49] It Off by giving you the Holy Ghost amen
[1:12:52] he capped It Off by giving you that
[1:12:54] witness the Holy Ghost is in your soul
[1:12:57] you've got an Incorruptible part of God
[1:12:59] you've got the Living God you've got the
[1:13:01] fire of God in your soul hallelujah oh
[1:13:04] my oh that's juicy Hallelujah that's
[1:13:06] real good Hallelujah that's delicious
[1:13:09] amen come and dine the master cth come
[1:13:12] and dine Hallelujah like brother BR said
[1:13:15] chew on that for a little
[1:13:17] bit regurgitate that and chew on that
[1:13:19] chew that cud for a little bit oh that's
[1:13:22] good because you are a daughter of God
[1:13:24] that's why God could give you the Holy
[1:13:28] Ghost that's the cap on it that's just
[1:13:30] finish it right there that's why you got
[1:13:32] it because he always knew you'd have it
[1:13:35] Hallelujah I'm GNA take a little drink
[1:13:38] here all right verse 26
[1:13:42] 8:26 likewise so in the same the same
[1:13:45] way the spirit also helps our
[1:13:51] infirmities so you ever been uh have an
[1:13:53] infirmity have a weakness and the Holy
[1:13:55] Spirit will help you with your
[1:13:57] weakness
[1:13:58] right sometimes we're weak and we we
[1:14:00] doubt we fear we lust we're prideful
[1:14:03] we're arrogant we're
[1:14:05] critical we're emotionally angry with
[1:14:08] sinning we can be angry and sin not but
[1:14:10] sometimes we're angry and we sin but
[1:14:13] what does the Holy Spirit do he helps us
[1:14:15] with our
[1:14:16] infirmities Allelujah or if we're sick
[1:14:18] he helps heal our bodies praise God if
[1:14:22] we know not what we should pray for as
[1:14:24] we ought see sometimes we don't know
[1:14:27] which way does God want us to pray but
[1:14:29] the spirit itself makes intercession for
[1:14:31] us with groanings which cannot be
[1:14:35] uttered now I don't even know honestly
[1:14:38] what that
[1:14:39] means uh I just know the spirit must it
[1:14:41] must groan within us or the spirit must
[1:14:44] somehow groan in a Heavenly realm also I
[1:14:48] can think of is Daniel praying and the
[1:14:50] Angels were fighting to bring him the
[1:14:52] answer that's all I can think of
[1:14:54] right because if it can't be uttered
[1:14:55] then you can't hear it
[1:14:58] right if there if the spirit is is
[1:15:00] making intercession for us and it can't
[1:15:03] be uttered then we can't hear
[1:15:05] it so it's either a conversation with
[1:15:07] the angels a conversation between God
[1:15:10] and the Jesus and the Angels or God and
[1:15:12] Jesus
[1:15:13] even right I don't know if if God talks
[1:15:16] like that to Jesus separately I don't
[1:15:18] know but the Bible said that the father
[1:15:20] is above the son right father son man
[1:15:24] woman remember that from 1 Corinthians
[1:15:26] 11 but here the Bible said the spirit
[1:15:29] makes intercession for us and remember
[1:15:30] Jesus is the high priest he's the
[1:15:32] intercessor for
[1:15:33] us Jesus Will intercede for us with
[1:15:37] groanings which cannot be uttered so it
[1:15:38] either means Heavenly groanings or it's
[1:15:40] a groaning in us that we can't even
[1:15:42] utter maybe that's it maybe there's
[1:15:44] something on the inside of us we feel
[1:15:46] but we just don't even know how to
[1:15:47] express it maybe that's it but I that's
[1:15:50] just a scripture I've never quite
[1:15:52] understood but but the point is this the
[1:15:54] spirit helps us when we don't know what
[1:15:56] to do and the spirit helps us when we
[1:15:59] have
[1:16:01] infirmities so our sick friends may God
[1:16:03] hallelujah may God intercede for our
[1:16:05] sick friends and family members praise
[1:16:07] God May the spirit make intercession for
[1:16:09] them in their
[1:16:11] infirmities Hallelujah I know when I was
[1:16:13] sick my wife come up and prayed for me
[1:16:15] oh yeah and then I I forgot too uh a
[1:16:18] friend out in Minnesota heard I was sick
[1:16:19] and they prayed for me I believe that's
[1:16:21] part of the reason I got well so fast I
[1:16:23] was only sick uh what is he what wasn't
[1:16:26] even uh well maybe a day and a half I
[1:16:28] was sick maybe 36 hours and he was he
[1:16:32] was surprised he said are you well I
[1:16:34] said yes I'm well he was surprised I got
[1:16:36] well well I don't know I mean I got
[1:16:37] people in Minnesota praying for me I my
[1:16:39] wife praying for me I'm sure my children
[1:16:40] prayed for me I didn't tell many people
[1:16:43] I was sick I didn't even ask the church
[1:16:44] to pray for me because I'm like ah I
[1:16:45] don't I don't want to bother them you
[1:16:48] know I already had people praying for me
[1:16:50] I don't want to bother
[1:16:51] anybody but but here the spirit will
[1:16:54] help with our infirmities I got to
[1:16:57] listen to some good sermons while I'm
[1:16:58] laying there on the bed with that that
[1:16:59] blaring headache you know all day I got
[1:17:02] to listen to some good sermons got some
[1:17:03] good
[1:17:04] thoughts verse 27 and he that searches
[1:17:08] the hearts the holy spirit that must be
[1:17:11] the spirit of God knoweth what is the
[1:17:13] mind of the spirit because he maketh
[1:17:16] intercession for the Saints according to
[1:17:19] the will of God now that looks like it's
[1:17:20] Jesus the spirit of Jesus perhaps the
[1:17:24] logos all right so it's clear Saints for
[1:17:28] us it is all about the will of God may
[1:17:30] God help us to understand it's not about
[1:17:33] our will it's about God's will because
[1:17:36] the spirit is only going to make
[1:17:37] intercession on God's
[1:17:41] will now will there be times God gives
[1:17:44] people over to their own will yes like
[1:17:45] balam remember God will give people
[1:17:47] their own will sometimes if if they're
[1:17:49] reprobate and even God will give over a
[1:17:52] believer like Hezekiah God gave him the
[1:17:55] permissive will of
[1:17:56] God but we should we should pray and say
[1:17:59] Lord let your spirit only do your will
[1:18:02] in my life in other words let's not beg
[1:18:05] God for what we want let's beg God for
[1:18:07] what he wants praise God like brother
[1:18:10] said prayer is to change our minds not
[1:18:12] to change God's mind do you know that
[1:18:14] brother had a quote like
[1:18:16] that see and that that shows brother
[1:18:18] raham grew brother Ram grew and said he
[1:18:20] said prayer could change the mind of God
[1:18:21] earlier but later he says that now
[1:18:24] prayer is to change our mind not God's
[1:18:27] mind Hallelujah I need to make a video
[1:18:30] on that I do want to do that video
[1:18:32] because it it deals with Divine Healing
[1:18:34] brother ramam grew so much in his
[1:18:36] understanding on Divine
[1:18:38] Healing by the end he said you must
[1:18:40] first find the will of God and that's
[1:18:43] what I'm I'm thankful for church I'm
[1:18:44] thankful the holy spirit makes
[1:18:46] intercession on the will of God
[1:18:48] hallelujah let God's will be done not
[1:18:50] our
[1:18:51] will
[1:18:53] pardon
[1:18:55] me now I'm almost done verse 28 and we
[1:18:58] know all things work together for good
[1:18:59] to them that love God to them who are
[1:19:02] called according to his
[1:19:03] purpose see now if you know verse 27
[1:19:06] that God's going to do according to the
[1:19:08] will of God then you can surely believe
[1:19:10] verse 28 all things work together for
[1:19:12] good because I wanted God's will to be
[1:19:15] done in other words I didn't beg God for
[1:19:18] my what I wanted I didn't beg God uh to
[1:19:21] change his will so I could have the per
[1:19:23] will of God like Hezekiah or like uh bam
[1:19:25] and I'm not bashing Hezekiah he was a
[1:19:27] mighty man I'm just saying we should
[1:19:29] learn from those things and we all
[1:19:31] sometimes want our way you don't have to
[1:19:33] say Amen you can say out if you want but
[1:19:36] you know we all we all want our way
[1:19:37] sometime even brother Jesse ouch you
[1:19:40] know and we've all got to say Lord
[1:19:43] forgive me let me just have your will
[1:19:45] amen but see anyone that accepts verse
[1:19:48] 27 I want God's will I want according to
[1:19:50] the spirit of God then I know all things
[1:19:53] in my life will work together for good
[1:19:55] because I love
[1:19:57] God it all worked together for good well
[1:20:00] I never got that principal job I never
[1:20:02] made all that money but that was all for
[1:20:04] my good because I realized later you got
[1:20:07] to work like a dog and you make less
[1:20:09] money per hour did you know that I
[1:20:12] learned that later so I learned oh all
[1:20:14] things work together for
[1:20:15] good I'd rather make more per hour than
[1:20:18] have all this vacation time spend it
[1:20:20] with my family and spend it with God
[1:20:22] preach the word of God study and spend
[1:20:24] time with the holy spirit amen it worked
[1:20:27] together for good now when I was going
[1:20:28] through it I was really disappointed
[1:20:30] well how am I going to supp supply for
[1:20:32] my family well guess what God makes a
[1:20:34] better way praise
[1:20:36] God you see so just and that's that's
[1:20:39] very simp that's a very simple thing
[1:20:41] maybe not even a big deal but it could
[1:20:43] have got out could have got me out of
[1:20:45] the perfect will of God it could have
[1:20:46] per put me in the permissive will of God
[1:20:49] where I wouldn't have enough time to do
[1:20:50] what God called me to do in fact I know
[1:20:53] I wouldn't have enough time you know why
[1:20:54] cuz I saw my uh principal's uh email
[1:20:57] today guess how many new emails he got
[1:20:59] just today now this was at 9:00 amm this
[1:21:01] morning guess how many emails
[1:21:03] 489 I'm like thank you Lord I got 10
[1:21:07] emails today praise God I rather have
[1:21:11] that and church he's got to go through
[1:21:13] all those it's required by the the law
[1:21:16] well not by law but by the Board of
[1:21:18] Education you got to return every email
[1:21:19] within one
[1:21:21] day you if not they're going to get mad
[1:21:23] at you now they won't fire you but
[1:21:25] you're getting lazy if you don't return
[1:21:26] it by one
[1:21:27] day see Saints all things work together
[1:21:31] for good to them that love the Lord I
[1:21:32] don't want to do 489
[1:21:36] emails verse 29 let's finish with this
[1:21:39] for whom he did
[1:21:41] Forno didn't the Bible say you were
[1:21:43] chosen in Christ before the foundation
[1:21:44] of the world God knew you before you got
[1:21:47] here church God knew all about
[1:21:51] you
[1:21:53] he also did
[1:21:54] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:21:57] image of his son denominations are not
[1:22:00] making Christians into the image of
[1:22:03] Christ because they let them sin they
[1:22:05] let them they don't suffer for being a
[1:22:07] Christian there's no there's no uh
[1:22:10] there's no pain for being a
[1:22:13] Christian right but you and I God fornew
[1:22:17] us and he predestined he predetermined
[1:22:19] the bounds of your habitation he
[1:22:21] predetermined the bounds of where you
[1:22:23] could go and what you could do to be
[1:22:26] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:22:29] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:22:33] Brethren
[1:22:36] Hallelujah so now we getting to
[1:22:38] predestination we get into
[1:22:39] adoption the will of God all things work
[1:22:42] together for good and now he gets into I
[1:22:44] know my life is
[1:22:46] predestinated I know God sent me here to
[1:22:49] akan
[1:22:50] Hallelujah I know he sent you here
[1:22:52] praise God God he had to he had a
[1:22:54] predestinated
[1:22:56] plan and he knew by sending you to akan
[1:23:00] he knew that the word of God would
[1:23:02] change you to be more like Christ more
[1:23:04] so than if you had been in another place
[1:23:08] because God determines the steps of your
[1:23:11] habitation God determines where you go
[1:23:13] and where you don't go God determine
[1:23:16] that and then Jesus was the first born
[1:23:20] among many Brethren but you are are one
[1:23:22] of the born Brethren Hallelujah you're
[1:23:25] one of the many Brethren who've been
[1:23:26] born of the Holy Spirit who've been born
[1:23:29] with the spirit of adoption whereby you
[1:23:32] cry out to God ABA father amen that
[1:23:35] makes you cry out to God because you're
[1:23:37] a born child of God hallelujah I said it
[1:23:41] wrong born I shouldn't put a d on the
[1:23:43] end born child of
[1:23:46] God verse 30 it's 8 o'clock so I'm
[1:23:48] finishing up almost at my hour you've
[1:23:49] been a good audience very very very
[1:23:51] lovely very kind moreover whom he did P
[1:23:55] I'm sorry predestinate them he also
[1:23:57] called that means elected or
[1:24:00] chosen so if God predetermined KN fornew
[1:24:03] you in his mind then he predestined
[1:24:06] predestinated all the events of your
[1:24:08] life then in time he called you he chose
[1:24:12] you and then he justified you he
[1:24:15] declared you righteous
[1:24:17] Hallelujah and whom he justified if he
[1:24:21] declared you righteous he he's already
[1:24:23] glorified you
[1:24:25] Hallelujah and this is the order of
[1:24:28] predestination Hallelujah for knowledge
[1:24:32] predestination election calling
[1:24:34] Hallelujah predestination I'm sorry
[1:24:36] justification and then glorification
[1:24:39] hallelujah this is the order if anybody
[1:24:42] ever tells you predestination ain't the
[1:24:44] Bible it's right there and it gives you
[1:24:45] the exact order God for fornew you
[1:24:49] predestinated you he elected you he
[1:24:51] called you he justified you and then he
[1:24:53] will glorify
[1:24:54] you he'll give you that white robe
[1:24:57] Hallelujah never got to worry about
[1:24:58] getting stains on it right he'll give
[1:25:00] you that crown of righteousness that
[1:25:02] Crown of Life that fits your head just
[1:25:05] perfectly not too heavy either
[1:25:10] Hallelujah he's already glorified you
[1:25:12] now church with this thought glorified
[1:25:15] it's got that D on the end that means
[1:25:16] it's already happened think about that
[1:25:19] church he's already glorified you it's
[1:25:21] already in his mind
[1:25:23] here here's the Earth here's the
[1:25:24] universe in time God's already outside
[1:25:27] of that and he's got his books he's got
[1:25:29] his L Book of Life he's got a book of
[1:25:30] life and he's already glorified you
[1:25:33] you're already glorified in the mind of
[1:25:36] God that's why God could tell Jeremiah
[1:25:39] I've already ordained you a prophet to
[1:25:41] the Nations I already know I'm going to
[1:25:42] send you to the Nations and I'm going to
[1:25:44] form you in your mother's womb I'm going
[1:25:46] to give you a prophet's human spirit so
[1:25:48] you can see Visions you can know thus
[1:25:51] sayth the Lord amen and church I mean
[1:25:53] know it in a really powerful way brother
[1:25:55] Braham had the the prophet gift in a
[1:25:58] powerful way but he never wrote a book
[1:26:00] of the
[1:26:01] Bible in other words not I mean he
[1:26:03] didn't have all these words in a row
[1:26:05] like Jeremiah had church can you imagine
[1:26:07] how many chapters was in
[1:26:08] Jeremiah Isaiah had 66 chapters Isaiah
[1:26:12] had this prophet's mind where he heard
[1:26:15] every single word of thus sayith the
[1:26:17] Lord and then wrote it down brother
[1:26:19] Braham wasn't brother Braham had those
[1:26:21] but he didn't have have that specific
[1:26:23] gift to write down entire books of the
[1:26:25] Bible think of that different different
[1:26:28] Prophet gifts now different Prophet
[1:26:30] gifts a prophet gift to write every
[1:26:33] single thing down now the closest
[1:26:35] brother I'm got remember was pick up
[1:26:37] your pen and write in
[1:26:39] 1962 and he said I just started writing
[1:26:41] that's the closest we got but we can't
[1:26:43] add that to the Bible because the Bible
[1:26:44] said you can't add to it or take away
[1:26:46] it's just a prophecy to encourage the
[1:26:47] people okay just a and it it actually
[1:26:50] really points back to Genesis 1 with the
[1:26:52] seed the spoken word is Original
[1:26:55] Seed all right and this is why God told
[1:26:59] the the devil job is
[1:27:02] perfect he was a sinner saved by grace
[1:27:05] but God was already looking at him with
[1:27:07] predestination this man's already
[1:27:09] glorified amen this man's already
[1:27:12] Justified this man's already
[1:27:13] predestinated he's already called he's
[1:27:16] already for known uh you can test him I
[1:27:19] know he's going to pass the test because
[1:27:20] I've already finished it already
[1:27:22] glorified hallelujah it's already
[1:27:25] happened in my mind I already chose him
[1:27:26] I already know it's going to happen
[1:27:27] praise God that's why God can let you go
[1:27:31] through sufferings because you're
[1:27:32] already chosen in the mind of God you're
[1:27:34] already perfect in the mind of God the
[1:27:36] Bible said you've got a theophany there
[1:27:38] Hallelujah that the Bible says is
[1:27:40] eternal created in the heavens already
[1:27:44] it's already perfect it's always been
[1:27:46] perfect it always will be perfect
[1:27:49] Hallelujah God didn't mean job was
[1:27:51] sinless
[1:27:52] God knew job's sin but God meant job was
[1:27:56] a Son of God who had a perfect theophany
[1:27:59] he was going to enter into praise
[1:28:02] God and the Bible said the face of those
[1:28:05] theophanies always behold the face of My
[1:28:07] Father which is in heaven so as I said
[1:28:10] before there's some area in heaven
[1:28:12] there's there's Angels there's the 24
[1:28:13] Elders there's some area where those
[1:28:16] theophanies are all in the presence of
[1:28:18] God somehow I don't can't explain that
[1:28:20] remember there's levels of heaven right
[1:28:22] right there's the third heaven there's
[1:28:23] under the altar there's above there's
[1:28:26] some place where the Bible said Jesus
[1:28:28] said their Angels do always behold the
[1:28:30] face of my Father in heaven now that's
[1:28:32] either theophany or their guardian angel
[1:28:35] now that now that I'm preaching it it
[1:28:36] seems like the guardian angel but the
[1:28:39] Bible says we have houses not made with
[1:28:41] hands Eternal in the heavens in 2
[1:28:43] Corinthians chapter 5 and this is why
[1:28:46] God could say job is perfect because God
[1:28:48] said you're already glorified it's
[1:28:51] already happen and that's why brother
[1:28:53] Ram could say this and uh let's stand
[1:28:55] the musicians can come I'll read this
[1:28:57] quote and I'll be
[1:29:00] done brother Braham said what you have
[1:29:02] to do with a tree you got to take the
[1:29:04] tree and plant it in the ground and then
[1:29:06] have have you water it as you water it
[1:29:09] it doesn't do nothing but drink drink
[1:29:11] drink it has to drink more than its
[1:29:13] portion and the more it drinks the
[1:29:15] bigger it swells up it pushes out limbs
[1:29:17] it pushes out leaves it pushes out
[1:29:19] blossoms then it pushes out apples is
[1:29:21] that right and that's the way a
[1:29:22] Christian is we're planted together in
[1:29:25] Christ Jesus who is the inexhaustible
[1:29:27] Fountain of Life we're planted in Christ
[1:29:30] and we just drink and drink and drink
[1:29:31] and push out and everything we have need
[1:29:34] of for our Earthly J Journey Divine
[1:29:36] Healing the power of God all these other
[1:29:38] things is in every individual in here
[1:29:40] that's received the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:42] Ghost for you're planted in Christ
[1:29:44] Hallelujah the Holy Ghost baptism yes

[1:29:50] life's journey even the Rapture is right
[1:29:52] in you then praise God so once a person
[1:29:56] gets the Holy Ghost everything that you
[1:29:58] have need of is in you
[1:30:00] already that's what brother R says just
[1:30:02] like an apple tree all those apples are
[1:30:04] already in that seed every little apple
[1:30:06] is already in that seed right everything
[1:30:08] you have need of is in the seed of God
[1:30:10] that's in your
[1:30:11] soul just got to water it I love these
[1:30:15] simple illustrations it's so powerful I
[1:30:17] know we've heard it before but let's
[1:30:19] let's let's enjoy it aesh tonight by
[1:30:20] God's grace
[1:30:23] brother R said' don't resent that that's
[1:30:24] the truth the Rapture is in us now I'll
[1:30:27] prove it by the gospel and guess which
[1:30:29] verse he proves Romans
[1:30:33] 8 he said those who he's called he's
[1:30:36] Justified and those he justified he hath
