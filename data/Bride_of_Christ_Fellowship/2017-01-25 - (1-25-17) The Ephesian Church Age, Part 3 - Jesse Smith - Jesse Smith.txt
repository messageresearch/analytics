thank you sir what a wonderful atmosphere we thank the Lord for that atmosphere praise God look at uh the scripture I want to go to the Ephesian Church age tonight I want to continue on this uh series I imagine this will be a long series but uh if you read the church age book it's a long book and it's a good glorious book and you will be a more mature Christian for reading that book I guarantee that with all that's within me with all my heart I believe that why do you say that brother Jess because that's the first book I read when I became a Christian a message believer amen and this book is settled Us in the faith can you imagine if a prophet worked four years on one book what would he accomplish that's what we have by God's grace it's a prophet's commentary on the Bible uh the first uh three chapters of the Book of Revelation so Revelation Chapter 2 tonight by the grace of the lord we just like to greet everybody in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ good to be back in the house of the Lord and we had some wonderful meetings there with brother Cam and uh some wonderful uh testimonies you know just to people being blessed by the word of God uh keep them in prayer they're going through a really wonderful time they have four new souls coming to the church there so God has saved them and it's just wonderful and they're so hungry and sincere for the word of God it it's just quite humbling I was quite humbled to see their hunger and I thought oh that's what I want my let's all get our hunger like that let's all be real hungry for the word of God let's treat it like our first love amen Revelation Chapter 2 and we like to look at uh verse verses one two and three uh we'll probably look at mostly at verse three tonight but let's just review these because it's been a week or two uh believe since we looked at this here Revelation chapter 2 verse one if you're there say amen amen I'll read verses one and two and then we'll all read verse three unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou cast not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and H has found them liars and Hast born and has patience and for my name's sake I'm sorry let's read verse three together forgive me let's read that on three 1 two three and H has borne and H has patience and for my name's sake H has labored and has not fainted let's bow our heads for one more word of prayer if we can here if you have a need on your heart just make it Unown unto God tonight I have a few important needs on my heart Heavenly Father we bow our heads we raise our hands we lift our hearts to you Lord Jesus we thank you for these songs where we sing about your love we sing about your name we sing about your spirit oh Lord we worship you tonight we give you the glory you the honor take this time and Lord Make It Special Lord God for our walk with you Lord may we not let it become common or or lazy or anything let us be sincere as we possibly can and may we sense your Holy Spirit Lord dealing with our lives Lord helping us to walk in the light Lord Jesus be careful where we step be careful what we say to make sure it would please you Lord God help me I'm in great need of you tonight Lord to find your leadership and your anointing and your blessing Lord God uh thank you Lord for this opportunity and Lord just speak to every heart and mind and soul we ask all these things in the mighty name of Jesus Christ and the church said amen God bless you being seated praise God so we thank the Lord again for U um being here tonight by the grace of the lord we appreciate brother Gaye being here I got a to listen to both the sermons from Sunday they're really good by God's grace so I'm going to preach a little follow up on Sunday Lord willing I'm going to follow up with a little more pastor preaching about that because I really enjoyed that what a wonderful what what wonderful messages that he brought there very some of those things I've written down I could show you I written down I want to preach on some of those things uh I could show you that uh so but I'm very thankful you know God knows just what we have need of and it's nice for you to hear it from somebody else somebody different preaching the same thing praise God so I know that's a real help I know that's a blessing to you and a real blessing to me um and uh just we're really looking forward to what the Lord's going to do in our midst amen we're happy to have uh Stephanie here tonight let's give her a round Applause praise God good to see her by God's grace amen appreciate her amen and let's uh if we can let's just get into this thought here the Ephesian Church Age part three now I think I have part four on the website but it's actually part three tonight uh by God's grace so Mali if you'd like to switch that over whenever you're ready let's look at this here and we're going to look at Jesus's message uh to the Ephesian Church age like I said these are critical things like I said if you could uh if you could asked Isaiah you know you could ask Isaiah Isaiah could you spend four years giving me a little more scripture some of your own personal thoughts scriptural thoughts about your prophecy and then have that or Moses Moses could you give me could you study maybe chapter the first three chapters of Genesis again and you could you give me some more scriptures to kind of back this up and give me some commentary what would you have you'd have a masterpiece praise God you'd have a prophet's commentary on the scripture and that's exactly what we got here uh with with the church age book so let's look at these thoughts and we'll be probably switching you know to some scriptures uh because I had some scriptures come on my heart that we might like to look at uh by the grace of the Lord but uh this is part three tonight now we are preaching we're reading a letter that Jesus sent out to the Christians just just for Austin and Stephanie probably and maybe some of you that haven't heard it Jesus wrote this letter you know to these Believers that would live from 53 ad to 170 ad that's what this letter is for okay and the messenger that Christ sent to them after he sent these words was St Paul and uh you know Paul lived from 5 to 67 ad so we are looking at this first blue box right here this is uh the the this is the group all these PE all these Christians that lived during that time that's the group that Jesus is speaking to right here because he said there are seven cities and there's seven uh Gentile cities and he was s sending seven different messages uh to each and every city okay and it was prophetic of these time periods so we're looking at uh a m message that that that uh Jesus is sending to them through Paul and Paul lived in that green box that light green box there that was Paul's lifespan so he came at the beginning of the church age how many know that by God's grace and uh we want to now then look at this here uh we we looked last week just I'm I'm going to review just one minute okay and I'm going to set my timer here I'm gonna preach hour by God's grace so amen I preached two hours on Sunday morning at cams and they were still really by the end some of them were up standing up still amen and so I said praise God I've just forgot all track of time so that's why my voice is still pretty horse we just had some wonderful times uh preaching at the top of my lungs so it was really good it it was just a real good time now uh in chapter two verse one Christ introduces himself to the church so this is how Jesus introduce himself he said I'm the one that holds seven stars in my right hand in other words I'm holding as I start this church age I'm holding every one of these angels in my right hand this is they're in my they have my power and they have my authority let me show you that I'm God and I hold every Prophet every Church age messenger I hold them in my hand amen and then he says I walk in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks so you know who I have in my hand you know who has my power and authority my messengers and you know where I'm at I'm right amongst you praise God I'm not some far off Place Christ is walking right in our midst this evening how many believe that how do you know when he's talking to you because it brings conviction to you praise the Lord it brings you closer to the word it makes you humble it makes you believe it raises your faith so you can believe things that you used to not believe but now you can believe them because Christ is here to give you Faith amen they said Lord increase our faith and he surely did he preached the word to him and they believed it and they received it so their faith Rose amen and that's what Christ is showing us he's showing I have my messengers that I'm sending to you they're in my hand let me introduce myself to you and I'll walk with you through every Church age I'll walk with through you through every decade of your life every year of your life I walk with you through every all your generations of your children and your children's children I'm walking with your children I'm walking with all believers what a great introduction amen I always walk with you amen thanks Malachi sorry the live streamers like to see the quotes is that okay all right thank you sir and then we ended last Wednesday uh by looking at verse two I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou c not bear them which are evil and the prophet looks at this scripture and he says he sees Christ praising his own people he starts off by saying I've Got The Messengers I'm right walking with you and then he says I know your works I know you're what you're trying to do for me praise God he said I know your labor I know you're labor your hard labor for the gospel and your patience how many still waiting on Jesus to fulfill all his promises keep waiting amen he'll never fail one if you believe amen all things are possible so he's praising them I know what you do for me I know how you serve me I know you're waiting on me he's praising them amen and we ended with that and we showed how um that's how we run a church that's how we run a family when we got to when we got to correct our family first bring a compliment when you got to correct somebody first uh it's a good idea to First bring a compliment to first thank them for what they do and then try to bring the correction in a in in a in a corrective way that'll help them praise God to help them get better uh the world just likes to rebuke and cuss people out but a a real Christian will be able to thank somebody bring bring the correction and then help guide them on how to get better but a sinner just you know they'll cuss you out and they'll make you feel so and so I like I come to intersection today and I forgot that I had a stop sign but the other one didn't and so I stopped and then they're coming up and I thought well they're goingon to stop so I pull out into their section and they start honking and you know doing all kinds of evil things to me blanky blank and I'm just sitting there like okay thank you and uh and you know how it is you can see they're yelling in the car and they're on the cell phone yelling at me and all these things I'm just I'm not yelling back Christians don't return evil for evil Christians return good for evil I was so shocked I just kind of straightforward and I drove through I'm like mercy God have mercy on these people they could talk on their self cell phone and show you signs and do all kinds of wicked things like that I didn't even mean to do it but uh that's how the World treats people that make mistakes but Christians aren't that way Christians if they say something and they catch you doing wrong they they'll maybe pray about it they'll talk to you and they'll try to straighten you out and help you get better and that's what Christ is doing here he says I know that you're working for me I know that you're laboring for me and I know you're waiting on me praise the Lord now let's look at the rest of this next uh let's look at the next thought here now we're getting into some uh fresh quotes here as he walks in the midst of his church he's aware of the suffering of his people and he cares how many people just want somebody to care about them my hands up sometimes you feel like nobody cares we all want Christ to care about us and He does care about us that's why we've had Grace in our lives that's why we have Second Chances third chances fourth chances right that's why there have so many chances to get it right so many chances to be free from sin so many chances to hear God's word to be saved he gives us so many chances he's aware of our sufferings because he says I know I know I know what you're suffering no man ever suffered like Jesus Christ no woman ever suffered like Jesus Christ yes there's been innocent children innocent people that had been hurting but Jesus was perfectly innocent that nobody could ever say and nobody could ever say there was as innocent or perfect as Jesus no one could say that but Christ was the perfect God man and he suffered more than anyone has ever suffered and he says I know your patience I know your works I know your labor and he's aware of the suffering of his people and he cares praise God how do you know he cares because I felt it when no one else cared for me I prayed and I felt he cared about me amen and that relief that released my burden it released my pain it released that because I know God's real science can they can do all they want they can't explain everything praise God they can hardly explain anything anymore they keep messing up and all these things like that and try to fix something but God's word has always been the same it's never changed and God shows uh he's so powerful by what he creates man cannot create nothing nor destroy it so was already here before man got here amen and he'll be here after man is done done away with the kingdoms of the world I'm talking about the the kingdom of the US the kingdom of China all these kingdoms will fall these kingdoms of man but the kingdom of Christ will reign forever it's exactly right notice he cares as it was in the days of the Captivity in Egypt when he heard their cries he who never changes still hears the cries of the oppressed as he walks among them the very word labor signifies a weariness through oppression so Jesus is aware that you're weary anybody ever get weary fighting all these Earthly battles fighting all these demons all these Devils all these mind battles all this depression all this Pride all this lust anybody ever get weary fighting that persecution rejection all these things ever get weary battling that well Christ knows exactly what you're going through amen and he cares that's why he offered you hope he offered his eternal promise he offered you his medicine right here by God's grace it was a medicine for all my addictions praise God it was a medicine for all my disease all my sickness this has been medicine this is the only real medicine amen all the other medicine's nice it might help you out a little bit but this will help you out eternally praise God now notice God's people do not only work for him in a labor of love but they suffer for him with joy joy they suffer with joy they are patient in bearing the Yoke or the burden this first age suffered great persecution it had to work hard to preach the gospel and shed forth truth their High Calling in life was to serve God I just brother Jess I just want to serve God that's my High Calling in life that's all I want to hear that's all I want to say myself I just want to serve God in some capacity to serve my Creator to serve the one who formed me my mother's womb my mom didn't do it it might have been in her body but she's not the one who formed me it was God who form me it was God's creative hand that formed me he says Christians are patient bearing the Yoke I'm sorry their High Calling in life was to serve God and when their hopes in life were blighted they were patient and committed all to him who had promised a lasting recompense or repayment in heaven for what they had given up for him on Earth you know sometimes people get discouraged about you know when young people die early or when children die early but think about if they died uh serving God think about what kind of reward they'll get think about what kind of reward they get a great reward how many believe that or if they suffer or if they're Christians and Christian family maybe their house gets burned down and they die or something like that think about the reward yeah they didn't get to live out their Earthly life here but they got to go to Eternity and live forever with Jesus Christ we don't think about those uh scenarios very often do we because we're human you know we think about you know the hardships oh that must be hard that must be painful that must be awful but Jesus promised he said I know your labor I know your works and I know you're suffering and I care about you amen now I W to um if we can by God's grace let's read this and I want to find a scripture let's go to next one I want to find a scripture uh real quick if you'll bear with me just a little bit by God's grace let's read this and then we'll uh find the scripture I think I got a scripture in Ecclesiastes just a moment okay yeah I found it okay let's read this I think we ought to stop here and deal with the thought that God's people have always been and always will be persecuted you know that Genesis is the book of beginnings and what you find started there will carry right on through the Revelation and never change when we see see that Cain persecuted and killed Abel because the latter or Abel pleased God so whoever pleases God will be persecuted how many can say Amen to that if you're not being persecuted maybe you're in a season of Peace but if you're never been persecuted maybe you're not saved yet because once you get saved you start getting persecuted for what you beli our persecution is not physical yet although there can be some of that in America but not like other countries like Iran and and South Africa and different countries like that where there's uh maybe North Korea different places like that Japan China but we still suffer some persecution praise God he says then we see a perfect picture in Abraham's son of the flesh ishmail who teased so te see teasing teasing is a form of persecution teasing oh why do you gotta look at your oldfashioned clothes oh look at your split end sisters you don't cut your hair yet the Bible says a woman should not cut her hair she cuts her hair God doesn't hear her prayers praise God oh you men look at you oh look at your shirt and tie you think you're some fancy guy look at you you think you're somebody special oh you won't cuss or smoke her you won't go out to the shows with us you won't go to the sports games anymore a bunch of sissies and they make fun of you any teasing at you for following the word of God is a form of persecution that's how they that's how they first persecuted the son of Abraham Isaac right how many sons of Abraham we got in here spiritually that's the natural son of Abra what about the spiritual sons of Abraham that's right now if you got your Bibles uh Isaiah 571 Mal does this show up okay on the um the live stream is it showing up okay okay Isaiah 571 I want to show this because I didn't have it on the slideshow but you know God uh God does things that oftentimes we're not really watching for uh we don't consider these things look at verse look at verse one the righteous perisheth so a child will be righteous right because they don't they don't know they're a sinner yet so a child dies the righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart nobody really thinks about it and merci men are taken away so good merciful men and none considerthe is taken away from the evil to come look at that scripture like I said people get all upset well how could this how could there be a God and let this person go off the scene and the Bible said many times God takes them away because evil that's going to come later on their lives and God will pay them back a millionfold a billionfold God always pays them back if they life is cut short a little bit here don't we trust God and know that God's ways are better than our ways don't we trust God to know that if he's Eternal and perfect and he knows the beginning from the end can't we trust him if somebody gets taken away even unexpectedly to us it was unexpected to us but not to God see nobody takes it to heart nobody thinks about God's perspective on things let's have a humble heart and say Lord help me just to accept what your will happens help me just to be humble help me not to judge and try to think I know more about it than anybody else help me just to be humble in my life amen so I thought you like that how many like that scripture by God's grace I come across I said my that's a powerful scripture praise God I hadn't seen that for a while now and then there was Esau so Cain persecuted Abel now Esau persecutes hated Jacob and would have killed him had not God intervened remember his mom said get out of here you're gonna he's going to kill you run and on his way a pillow uh pillow he had a stone for a pillow and he laid down and he saw Jacob's Ladder and he saw the ladder that go up into heaven and he said Lord because you showed me this surely I'll tithe all my tithes because you showed me there's a way to heaven and you'll bless me and be with me surely I'll give you back a tenth of everything I own and that was not a law that was Grace that was just Grace from his heart God intervene to save Jacob how many times God intervene to save you well we'll find out one day won't we in the New Testament we find Judas betraying Jesus while the righteous orders of the first century attempted to destroy the early Believers the children of this world controlled by the devil hate be careful what you hate only thing we should hate is Satan and I can say this we should hate our sin I forgot about that one we should hate our sin the children of God who are controlled by the spirit so we should uh we will experience persecution at times we'll experience hatred from people teasing all these are forms of hatred from the Antichrist Spirit we should expect that no matter how just and upright a Christian is before the public how gracious he is to his fellow man doing not but good so no matter how close you can live to God let him confess Christ as the Savior and acknowledge the operation of the gifts of the holy spirit in tongues prophecy healing and miracles and he will be condemned now remember our condemnation might come a little differently for example in America most time the condemnation comes behind your back people will talk bad behind your back and they'll stick a knife in your back usually most people won't do it in front of your face at least what I've experienced now they will do it over internet because you're not face to face with them I got a lot of that I got a lot of hatred on YouTube I sure got a lot of hatred there because it's not face to face and people are fearful they won't say it to your face because they're fearful uh but really deep inside of them when they attack when they tease when they condemn it's the spirit of hatred from Satan we should expect that as Believers the spirit of the world hates the spirit of God and because it can't overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of Truth dwells hallelujah our spirit cannot be conquered amen our spirit's Mighty Victorious powerful Eternal the Victor Hallelujah and so he Satan tries to destroy the humans who are pack in the word of Truth persecution and trials are a natural normal let's say normal normal part of the Christian Life what's the normal part of your life eating lunch eating breakfast getting dressed taking a shower rushing your teeth those are all normal things so is persecution and trials for a Christian it's part of the normal everyday life so we ought to get used to it and just stop complaining about it and the church said stop complaining about it it's the normal part of life brother man said trials are what Growing Pains of God's grace there's only one thing you can do about all your persecution and trials and teas and hins commit them to God say God you take care of this person who's teasing me you take care of this person who looks down upon me or mocks me or ignores me you take you I'm gonna just love love love you take care of this and I'm not gonna judge that person I'm not gonna say Well they're going to hell or I hope God kills them and don't judge them leave their outworking of these trials and the final judgments to God God is the judge let's let him be judge we get in trouble when we try to judge right try to judge everything and judge people let God be the judge praise God it's a normal part of life the only thing you can do is Lord take this teasing take this rebuke take this ignorance or people ignore me take this pain that I have Lord I committed under your hands just give me Grace to go through every now and then he might just supernat deliver you from something praise God he might just uh take away your enemies and take away the reproach but other times he might let you suffer through it for a while and you might have to bear the cross for a while but during that time don't judge leave it all up to him just ask God for Grace to endure for example brother Simon brother Cam's got a brother in his church there that we prayed for uh in tears with all of our hearts he got shot by a cop a few years ago if you want the news uh video send me a textt and I'll text him to you it's just a powerful story well we were praying for him on Saturday night just maybe for 30 minutes 40 minutes afterwards uh the bullet's still in his back and he's paralyzed from the waist down and he said there's bullets causing me pain and we just prayed and cried and I cried out to God I yelled and the relief didn't come right then but that didn't stumble him at all he said I've believe in God he saved me uh he's redeemed me and he said later went to bed that night he woke up in the middle of night and his got off his wheelchair wheeled his way to the water uh got some water and he said there pain left him there that in the middle of the night by God's grace now look we prayed for him at 10 o'clock at night he just had to wait a few more hours for the for the pain to subside but if we didn't get it right away we say well God must not love me he must not hear my prayer God heard the prayer we just got to wait do you want to know the story the story is he was a weightlifter uh a bouncer and some uh very wealthy Toledo clubs and he thought he was invincible and two weeks before he got shot he said I'm so strong and powerful it'll take a bullet to take me down he wasn't a Christian he he got stopped by a police officer on his motorcycle the co cops back here and I got the videos if you want to see it it's powerful powerful he was reaching in to get his license and ID and the cop thought he was getting a gun and shot him right in the back and paralyzed him uh this was a few years ago he said that situation he wasn't a Christian tore his family apart they hated this cop and they just came to trial two months ago and the family all wanted to uh get this cop in jail and they pressed charges against him because really he was in the wrong and he would have been condemned but a month before the trial he met my cousin Adam who came a few months ago remember that and they did Bible study with Simon and Cam and he received the message two months ago and all that he and he said that anger and hatred was tearing his family apart they hated this cop so bad as soon as he received the message he learned about forgiveness he forgave the cop and his whole family he convinced his whole family to accept Christ I don't know if they have or not but they have accepted forgiveness and he said his whole family can now move on they've forgiven the cop and the and the court at the court date when they went to the court he's he's sitting there in his wheelchair and he says I've got my King James Bible here and I love Jesus Christ I'll send you the video he literally says that it's on the news and brother Simon and cam been teaching him the word of God and he said I forgive him because uh Christ forgave me and he said we're we want all the charges dropped on the police officer and all the charges were dropped That's The Power of forgiveness now what would be greater for God to heal him instantly and he can walk again and not forgive and go to hell because he's got hatred in his heart or to be able to forgive the man and receive salvation amen and then let's see if God don't heal him let's see because he's the same yesterday today and forever let's ask and see what God will do I got two and two news stations covered it it's powerful he stands right there packing his Bible and he says I know God's going to heal me uh so he has a revelation of his healing he said I'm gonna walk out of this wheelchair I feel my nerves coming back in my legs anyways we're praying for him on S night and that's what it came through we just we just prayed and cried out to God we don't know but we all these things we gota we can't judge like he couldn't judge the cop right he couldn't say oh he's going to hell and all these things oh he did me so wrong every trial committed to God if somebody does something evil against you forgive them forgive and you shall be forgiven how many know that's the scripture if you don't forgive Christ won't forgive you you must forgive everyone who sinned against you and how do you do that well you think well I want Christ to forgive me I sinned against him and let me tell you you've sinned against Christ more than anyone else ever sinned against you we must have a revelation of forgiveness Lord unveil forgiveness show me what this means help me to forgive those whove wronged me Glory all right I got 35 minutes okay next let's let's let's keep going on verse two and how now this church uh could not stand evil people so see while while we forgive it's the the the evil still burdens us and Jesus says I know how you cannot bear them which are evil in other words they can't let them hang around and that's true although we love and forgive people we can't let people who sin hang around the church too long because their sin will start influencing others that's how demons work demons anoint one person they call out and they try to influence others come join me come join me when you were a sinner how how did you get into sin somebody invited you to watch a evil movie somebody looked invited look at some evil magazine somebody invited you to wear some evil clothes praise God it travels from one evil person to another so Jesus tells us while we while he will help us during these trials we should not bear with them that are evil now he said these a believe that God's people ought to be holy which means sacred and set apart from sin according to this verse they took steps to keep the body unleavened from sin most evidently the apostasy had already started send an enter into the church but they were obedient to the words of Paul when he said to put away the wicked from among them they were a separated people they had come out of the world and now they weren't going to let the world enter amongst them I like that amen glory I spent 19 years living in sin and I've spent the last how old am I now 17 S I spent the last 17 or 18 years keeping the sin out and I'm not ready to let that sin back in amen I spent 19 years loving sin I spent the last 17 hating sin and I will not let it come back in because I'm happier without it I'm forgiven without it I'm free without it I'm a Christian without it hallelujah hallelujah it will not come back in because it's cast out in Jesus Christ's name this is how the Ephesians were they used to be Sinners and once they got holy they said we're not letting that devil back in amen that's the Revelation this church needs amen do everything we can do to keep him out if we finally get him out let's keep him out amen don't let him in now let's go to that real quick let's go to First Corinthians 5 I don't have it on there let's just go what he's talking about 1 Corinthians 5 just as a reminder here's an example 1 Corinthians 5 it's familiar to you 1 Corinthians 5 verse1 I might as well turn there if I got it here can see it a little better by God's grace takes a second verse one it's reported commonly that there is fornication among you now fornication is any sexual activity outside of a a legal marriage and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife so there was a man sitting in this church in Corinth who was having uh sexual relations with his stepmother in verse two and you are puffed up so you they were prideful about it they were uh they were not burdened about it they were prideful about it and have not rather mourn they weren't mourning and crying over this how could this person our church do such evil wickedness they weren't mourning about it and Paul's here to correct them we should mourn over sin in the church they should have been mourning that he which had done this deed might be taken away from among you so see that Spirit of sexual Temptation and lust it would jump off that man and try to get on somebody else praise the Lord verse three but for verily as absent in body but present in spirit I've judged this already as though I were present concerning him that had done or so done this deed in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ when you're gathered together and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ amen so in the name and in the power of the name Hallelujah deliver such in one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh so when someone won't mourn and repent over their sins we know what Jesus said go to them first one-on-one if they won't receive it take a witness with you if they still won't receive it give them so many days and then kick them out of the church that's how we keep the church clean you deliver them say let Satan haveen if they want want want to repent then let let them enjoy Satan's treatment and Satan will try to kill them that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus all right so that's an example if we let people come in here and say they're church members and get baptized in Jesus name and act like they're Christians and they continue in sexual sin or other sins they should not be a part of and if we just put up with that it's ultimately gonna pervert our spiritual lives it will affect us because it's a it's a pleasure-loving demon amongst the Christians and we're either gonna have the Holy Spirit moving here or the Unholy Spirit here but we want the Holy Spirit here and the Holy Spirit can't work while the Unholy one is is is taking over people's lives and making them lukewarm and all these things like that we've got to cast out evil spirits amen all right so Paul says there Purge it out clean it out get rid of that old Le be a new church be a new lump amen for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us amen all right so I want to show that that gives you a clear concrete example once we come out of the world we don't want the world coming back in all right brother Gabe was hitting on some of those things like uh you know the clothes and the TV and the Facebook book and so I'm going to preach again on that Lord willing on Sunday by God's grace Amen to kind of uh back that up by God's grace I already had preached that but I want to go over that uh again and of course family life and things like that I want to go over family life a little bit on Sunday Morning by God's grace the Ephesians would not put up with sin in the church Holiness wasn't a phrase with them or a figure of speech it was a way of life amen in other words they just say well we're trying to be holy we're trying to be holy we're holy were holy they actually lived holy lives they didn't have to say how holy they were you could feel how holy they were Glory you could see how holy they were by their life wasn't just like all talk it wasn't all talk it was action amen now doing good on time okay praise the Lord now Jesus says now he says and you have this what we got to do we have and thou has tried them which say their apostles and are not and has found them Liars now what do I mean we got to do this anyone who says they have a calling of God in their life must be Tried by the word praise God anyone if you say you're a pastor you got to be Tried by the word your life's got to be proven by the word of God the Bible said lay no or lay hands upon no man suddenly that's speaking of ordaining gifts in the church so don't we if somebody like somebody feels led to preach the way we do it we give them a few opportunities to preach and and then when we when we all can say oh my the Holy Ghost is really in this man's Ministry then we lay hands and sanction that gift and say God's given us another gift in the church praise God I started preaching in January of 2004 I got ordained in August of 2004 it's eight months later so they gave me eight months before they ordained my gift amen and I say like this I believe it's the test of time amen that's just my personal opinion by God's grace because it ain't me it's Christ's calling in my life amen and every gift should be like that and so the real church will make sure all those who say they have a calling or gift to you got got a gift to prophesy I got a gift to tongues they make sure they prove it God has to prove that they got what they say they got and if not they're Liars see this ain't a time to play this ain't a time to be silly and nonsense or try to pretend you got something you got whatever you got Amen brother B said how do you know you got a gift you can do whatever you're talking about you can do it amen not just talk about it you can do it Hallelujah he said what right has a people to try those who call themselves Apostles and how do they try them he said oh I love this he said here it is in Galatians 1: 18 but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel on you than that which we have already preached unto you let him be cursed it was the apostles who brought the original word to the people that original word could not change not even a DOT or a dash of it Hallelujah so how do you try them if you if you say you're an apostle then you got to preach the apostles word if you change anything about it you're not an apostle how many believe that praise God they knew that the Ephesians knew that they met Paul Paul's an apostle Paul prayed for them they got filled with the Holy Ghost amen and then Paul preached to them and uh all the sorcerers threw all their magic books in a pile and burn about $100,000 worth of books we'd say for that day oh a mighty move of God but remember Alexander and I think it was Demetrius the copper Smith put up a fuss remember what happened after that Paul left after that and that's when demons down and said well maybe Paul's Lo lost his gift maybe he's not such a mighty man anymore well that have stumbled you no that would not have stumbled me because you can only do whatever God's called you to do and then if you read your Bible in second Timothy Paul warned Timothy be careful for Alexander and Demetrius well I've got perfect Rapture in faith well you might but if you don't have a revelation about a certain thing thing you shouldn't act like you got it Paul had no Revelation that Timothy would have no trouble with Alexander so he didn't act like he did praise the Lord so be careful what we say about a revelation amen because Paul was even so wise and mature to say be careful for Alexander be careful for Demetrius they've done me much harm that's the word of God he never lost his gift he never lost his Visions he never lost his anointing but he would not insert something that God didn't say he'd only say what God Said there it is right there amen and so should we all right Paul knew it was God who had spoken to him so he said even if I come and try to give a second Revelation try to make one little change in what I gave originally let me be cursed that's how important it is to stay with the word of God he said I I should even be cursed if I change one thing in my in my word you see Paul knew the first revelation was correct God can't give a first revelation and then a second Revelation if he did he would be changing his mind he can give a revelation and then add to it as he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed to the woman and then later designated that the seed would come through Abraham and then later said it would come by the Bloodlines in David how many you know that he starts off by saying I'll give you a seed Eve and that seed will bruise the head of the serpent about a thousand years later he tells Abraham he said through you all the world will be blessed amen through Abraham's seed so now he's got more Revelation same Revelation just more information about it more details amen it's kind of like God given a main idea then he gives details to follow the main idea is the messiah's coming Hallelujah and it's coming to deliver you from Satan and to smash Satan's head and then he gives that's his main idea then he gives details it's coming through Abraham it's coming through David he'll be born in Bethlehem all these details and Jesus fulfilled every one of those amen now this is what I want to say too let's look at this this is beautiful but it was the same Revelation about the Messiah it only gave the people more information to help them receive and understand it but God's word can't change the seed came exactly as revealed Hallelujah and see what those false apostles were doing they came with their own word those Ephesians knew what word I'm sorry that word as Paul taught it they were full of the Holy Ghost by laying on of Paul's hands h Allelujah amen now let me say this I highlighted that let me give an example the Rapture 1965 the message from Yuma Arizona I believe that was more information on the same Revelation in the Bible Paul gave us Revelation about the Rapture in 1 Corinthians 15 1 Thessalon chapter 4 he gave us all this information all these Revelations but then brother Brandon breaks down for us the shout the voice and the Trump amen glory Paul never did that he just said there's going to be a shout of voice and a trump but then the prophet of God comes and says the shout is the message the Midnight Cry to get the bride ready for the Rapture amen and then he says the voice is the voice of the Archangel and archangels are connected to body changes because the Archangel Moses or the AR Angel disputed with Satan about the body of Moses because Moses got a body change amen and the voice of the Archangel is the raising of the Dead Saints just like the same voice raised Lazarus from the grave the dead raised to life and the Trump the Bible said at the Trump of God the uh the Bible said will be changed in the moment of the twinkling of an eye amen glory he gave us more information about it praise God he connected first Thessalonians 4 with uh Matthew chapter 25 Hallelujah glory and the shout of the 10 that went out to the 10 versions what is it it's more information about the same promise now somebody got really upset at one of my videos and uh on YouTube and I admit I made a mistake so let me just uh share with you how I make mistakes sometimes because I'm not perfect on my video about modest clothing in the Bible it's got 11,000 hits on it which is pretty exciting for me to know that people you know want to know about modest clothes that's just it's awesome I like that well on the video I say that everybody's got to have you know a close down to here but actually by scripture by scripture we can only prove that when anyone shows off anything above the knee it's nakedness right that's in Isaiah 47 the Bible said I'll uncover your thigh that's nakedness okay and of course the showing the chest of the breast especially for women or men men in two anytime they show off their chest that's nakedness so God wants from here covered all the way down to here at least and the church said but on the video I kind of got really zealous I got a little overzealous and I said well Jesus wears a garment down to the foot in heaven so we all should now I got went a little overboard there okay I went to little extreme and somebody called me out on it and I thank them for that because by scripture I can't prove we should all do that now by scripture I can only say that we should have uh at least covering the thighs because if you go and study hisory history in the days of Jesus I was saying this earlier the men only had garments down past their knee but the women had them all the way down to the foot okay so you could tell right away who's a man or woman when you saw shins that's a man if you didn't see any shins or any feet that's a woman you could tell right away it's very easy and then they also wore two layers of clothes they had what was called a tunic which is like a shirt underwear shirt like if you wear a T-shirt and it's really long that's kind like your underwear layer and on top of that they had either what's called a cloak or robe how many know that and that was the outer garment Peter went fishing after the resurrection he took off his Fisher's what coat and the Bible said he was naked so see he had a very thin layer a very thin layer of underwear on praise God I don't know how far it went all I know is the Bible said he had a tunic on so when we take off clothes our outer garments right now it's okay to wear one garment if it's thick but in those days it was a very thin garment so Peter's out there fishing with his underwear on and the Bible said he was naked how many know that's the scripture that's the word of God it's John chapter 20 ver 29 now so what I I updated the videos now to correct myself and I said uh we know God is surely pleased when men and women all cover from their chest all the way down to their knees I said God is surely pleased with that I said but we encourage the Christians to pray and if God wouldn't have them to wear even more modest clothing in order to stay a far away from nakedness as they possibly could now that's to me the church now listen this is just my thought I could be wrong on this but as a minister I've got to stand somewhere when people ask me questions the Revelation that God restored to brother Ram in this day is the revelation we must dress modestly and that's in 1 Timothy 2:9 I would that women dress with modest clothing and and of course men too because Peter was naked right so you know he's specifically speaking to women because they're more beautiful they are the the temp they can be tempting if a man's not careful man's got to guard his eyes but I believe the Holy Spirit has given us more information on the revelation of modesty because we see Jesus in heaven he's gonna be wearing a garment down to the foot for all eternity praise the Lord so that's why I believe the holy spirit's given us more revelation we should be the leaders in modesty by God's grace not to be legalist now if I now here's what legalism is and I preached this on Sunday they were really blessed at Cam's Church legalism is anything excessive to the word of God in other words anytime you add to God's word that's legalism okay so if I said if I said men um you have to wear pants or you're going to hell that's legalism right I'm saying that go down to your feet if you you have to wear pants and go down to your feet or you're going to hell that's legalism that's excessive but if I said Brothers you have to wear pants that at least cover your thighs to your knees now that's scriptural praise God are you with me or if I said sisters your hair has to be 36 inches down or you're going to hell that's legalism but if I say your hair has got to be long and uncut that's obedience are you with me church because some women can grow their hair long they don't have the genetic ability to do it all right but it has to be as long as it possibly can get and uncut that's what the word of God says but if I add to that that becomes legalistic but if we just keep what the Bible said we're not legalists because we're not adding anything excessive we're just loyalists can I say it like that Glory we're not legalists we're loyalist amen we're loyal to God's word and you got to apply that to murder you got to apply it to adultery you say well you don't murder you're a legalist no I'm a loyalist right I'm a loyalist you got to apply it the same way you must we must always obey the commands of God and love Jesus Christ we must never transgress Jesus never transgressed and he was never a legalist he never commanded anyone to do anything excessive than what the word of God said he said live by every word of the Bible not by anything additional just by every word are you with me church I'm not being legalistic if I say you shouldn't murder people you shouldn't commit adultery that's not legalism that's obedience that's loyalism amen that's being loyal to the word of God how many understand that legalism is adding something extra and then making that a requirement that's legalism so see I feel like I was getting kind of legalistic on that first video but I left it out there uh I didn't delete it because I still want people to find it for example like uh even though there's a mistake on it I left it out there because brother BR has all those a thousand sermons and sometimes there's mistakes on there they don't get rid of the ones that he made a human mistake on they leave it out there why because if you're truly led by the spirit of God you can't be deceived praise the Lord amen hallelujah they really like that the brother said well we were talking we were just talking about that yesterday that's exactly word for word what we were talking about I said Thank you must and I I looked at the church I said I didn't even plan to preach that and they admitted afterwards that's exactly what they were talking about the day before so thank God that's the Holy Spirit Discerning our hearts and lives amen so I'm just giving you that's my thought God can give us a revelation but then give us more information on it it doesn't change it it just gives us more details about it praise the Lord so that's just I want to lay that in there by God's grace how many doing on time okay I got about 13 minutes now here's what the Ephesians did when they came across a OST Les that were not preaching the word of God they wouldn't preach this here's what they said they looked at those F false Apostles in the eye and said you are not saying what Paul said you are therefore false praise the Lord look how look how firm look how sure they were of what God's word was they could look in the face of false preachers now we're not just talking any lay member or a woman or child preachers people that came and say we're starting churches we're Apostles they would look them in the face and say you're not saying what Paul said Hallelujah this is the confidence a real Christian has in the written word of God he says oh that sets my heart on fire get back to the word it is not you really that tries the Apostle and prophet and teacher it is the word that tries them one of these days there's going to come a prophet to the lean Church age and you will know if he's a real one sent from God or not you'll know it Hallelujah yes you will for if he is of God he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul amen Glory Hallelujah exactly as Paul was in it he won't deviate from that word for a moment not for by one iota in the last age when there will be many false prophets appearing watch and see how they keep telling you that if you don't believe them and what they say you'll be lost but when that last day Prophet comes on the scene if he is truly that prophet he will be crying out get back to the word or you are lost he won't build a private Revelation or interpretation but on that word amen and amen these are FAL false Apostles are the Grievous wolves that Paul spoke of he said once I'm gone they will try and come and claim equal Revelation but their purpose is not to help you but destroy you and that's in Acts chapter 20 let's read that since we got a little m a little time here by God's grace Acts chapter 20 oh I love these I love these words of God Amen I love this kind of preaching amen hallelujah acts 20:27 now I don't remember how long he was here but I was telling this to a brother after service I think he was here a year and a half or nine months I can't remember which one it was he was in Ephesus Paul was in Ephesus look what he says in verse 27 I just want to make just a point here for I've not shown to declare unto you all the counsel of God now whether it was a year and a half or nine months that's long enough to tell you all the counsel of God praise God Amen I like that hallelujah it's enough to hit the major highlights in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and preaching against sin and all the revelations all the powers of God all the Mysteries a year and a half or two years whatever it was is long enough to sit and hear the preaching of the word and you'll be accountable for it on the day of judgment that's exactly right I've not shun to declare you the whole counsel of God I've been pastoring here almost 11 years I let me say like this I've not shun to declare unto you the whole counil of God either amen hallelujah the people that have sat under the ministry these all these years I've declared the whole counsel as far as I know by God's grace we should be able to say that especially if we're preaching on the baptism Holy Ghost because when you get that you've got everything amen glory when you got eternal life you've got everything Hallelujah that's the seed of God and everything that you need of is in that seat already amen glory so the prophet won't build on a private Revelation he'll build on the word of God John knew of them also for he said in 1 John 4:1 many false prophets are already gone out into the world that Antichrist Spirit was already infiltrating the church and it was doing it by going against the word why here it is where it all started right here in the first church age already they were denying the word and setting up their own Creeds and philosophies instead of the word that is Antichrist for Jesus is the word to be anti- is to be anti- Jesus how many believe that anything that goes against what's written here is Antichrist and the church said if it breaks any truth in here it's Antichrist and he said if you change one word of it you're cursed praise God to be anti word is to be Antichrist because the spirit and the word are one in Ephesians 6 Paul said and take the sword of the spirit which is the word of God amen glory the holy spirit is the word of God in action for wrote the word of God if you are anti- word you will have to be Antichrist and if it's start in the first church it will have to grow until the end when it takes over and that is exactly what you will see as we cover all the ages that starts out real small in the Ephesian age and it grows in every age until the anti- word Antichrist system takes over entirely and the infallibility of the word is repudiated by the false Apostles of the false Church all right now I want to insert this before I close I got a few more minutes I heard this quote the other day and or other week and I was so uh delighted brother brandham was God's Prophet but that does not mean he's infallible because he's not God I can show you and even I read this morning in act or Genesis 13 where Abraham lied about Sarah Abraham tried to guess and say well honey they're going to kill me in Egypt because you're pretty uh they're going to kill me so you lie and say you're not married to me so he so that's what happened he lied they both lied and the king of Egypt took her and God smoted his family with plagues and he said why' you lie to me get out of here and they kicked him out prophets make mistakes prophets lie prophets sin they they do now they're infallible when they say thus sayith the Lord that's the balance we got to have but look at this quote just have you heard this from key to the door have you heard this by the way brother said I have a letter that just come in the mail as Billy picked it up a while ago that some brethren are in Michigan and this comes from the ministeri of Association that's got a lot of things that's what gets things cred up you see that they claim in here that some men or Brethren up there that said that I sent them up there and they're preaching that men should leave their wives and hunt for their spiritual mate and that I am perfectly infallible so there's some preachers in Michigan that were saying Oh Brother Bram son us up here and you men can leave your wife and find your real spiritual mate and also brother random is is perfectly infallible he never makes a mistake look what brother Ram says that there's nothing and oh oh some of the awfulest things you ever heard to say brother brandom's infallible is one of the most awful things you've ever heard to make a prophet God is Antichrist you understand that and to say oh you can divorce and remarry again as much you one that's Antichrist are you with me and he had to deal with that he heard in fact if you listen to a few messages in 1961 right at the beginning I think it's Revelation chapter 4 part one brother brandom says he's leaving the field how many you ever heard that in 1961 he says I'm leaving the field because people are baptizing in my name saying that I'm Jesus Christ and he said I'm not going out anymore I'm just going to preach to the Tabernacle he said pray for me because I think I'm gon to go crazy he says now within a week the next week they repent of it and he's back on the field but that Spirit never died because people still worship him today that's okay they they bapti they tried to baptize in Paul's name too because they were such Mighty Men of God but see how Satan gets in there and tries to pervert it the awfulest thing you can hear is that oh it's okay to divorce and just marry all you want oh and brother Ram's perfect as well now some people say every word he said was thus sayith the Lord I don't agree with that I personally believe that's one of the most awfulest things you could say I could be wrong but that's what I believe because of this right here to say every word he said was thus say the Lord would mean he's infallible and brother Ram say that's one of the most awfulest things you have ever heard to make a man God outside of Christ because Christ is God Amen it keeps going and the Ministerial Association got a hold of it and they writing me a letter about it and that I sent up there and it's causing a lot of confusion see this causes confusion when people say things that aren't the truth praise God and some of them prophesying and saying that one man should leave his wife and go marry another that's just the spirit of lust are you with me church that's the spirit of lust and it's breaking the word of God the Bible said a man should be married to his wife until death do they part they're bound as long as they both shall live to their vow that they made they stood there before God and before preachers and before family and said I'll be with you till death do us part and they're Bound by that they'll answer for that on the day of judgment if they don't keep that word not legalism but loyalism amen I got a new word there I got look that up and see if that's a real word huh see now see they're acting all spiritual well I've got thus sayi the Lord for brother Jesse he can divorce and go Remar liar Antichrist not an apostle not a prophet because it goes against the word of God brother Ram's perfectly infallible liar you're not saying what Paul said Glory are you with me church and he said now this church knows that we don't stand for such Tommy Rod as that so now you know what false Doctrine is Tommy rot it's rotting trash rotting trash false Doctrine like that it's Satan disguised Satan transforms himself as an angel of Light Behind the pulpit or an angel of Light with a gift of prophesy or some type of Angel some light giver but if that light don't shine on the word of God get rid of it it's false light Hallelujah we must stay with the word of God I got a few minutes here how many is that raise your hand if that's quotes new to you anybody is that new to anybody okay okay praise hope that was a blessing by God's grace so you know brother Bram never said he said that's awful to say that I'm infallible that's awful that's awful thing to say it's Tommy rot don't believe kind of stuff like that all right is that help by God's grace all right I just thought I'd put that in there I just put that in there yesterday I thought well I think the church will like that by God's grace I think they'll appreciate that don't you appreciate that I appreciated that when I heard that so I thought you would too amen all right now and we got a few more let me see just a few more slides I want try to be timely here okay yeah I got uh let's just do one two four more you bear with me I've never preached like this before so I hope I hope it's okay with everybody like I've I rarely just preach quote quote quote quot quote I usually go scripture scripture scripture and then a few quotes but I thought this is so critical this book is so important because the Holy Spirit warned brother brandom to write it so the people know what kind of hour we're living in and ese now all the ages are important but especially Ephesians and Le oia because it's the beginning and end and we've got to go back to our first love so if we can see how sin came in the first church age it'll help us to keep sin out of our lives are you with me this is how it comes in people start bringing false lights and you got to stand there and say that's not what the Bible said I don't care if it's me or anybody else you come up and say that's not what the word of God says if it's me then you come see me right after church you don't have to knock on the door just come in there and sayi brother Jess I got to talk to you I got a question for you is that exactly right what you preach I I don't want to be wrong I want to be right by God's grace I'm not pouring my heart in life and this to be wrong or deceive anybody or to be rich or go after women or go after power I'm pouring my heart in this because I love Jesus Christ and I preach to five people I preach to two people I'll preach to 40 people I'll preach to whatever I got because I love preaching about Christ he's my Lord and Savior and if he saved me he can save others amen that's why I preach to save souls to point to the Cross amen not because I want to be somebody I want to be what Christ made me to be now he said it's easy to get a wrong impression of what we're talking about because I'm making such making this so strong now it could sound to you as though this Antichrist spirit is a complete repudiation of the word that means the total rejection of the Bible in other words he's saying the Antichrist spirit is not saying oh we're just going to do away with the bi the whole Bible that's not what it's saying he said it's just to change one word the Antichrist Spirit just wants to change change one word are you with me see it's a denial of the Bible culminating in its rejection no sir it is not that it is what Revelation 22:18-19 says let's read that you got it real quick there Revelation 228 and 19 praise the Lord boy that's nice I can just do that glory and then the live streamers get to see that too praise the Lord now verse 18 for I testify to every man that Hearth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall what let's say together shall add unto these things God shall add unto his him the plagues that are written in the book verse 19 and if any man should take away from the words of this book of the prophecy God shall take away his part of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book we cannot add to the Bible and we cannot take it away most churches today Church take away the Bible they take away the about women and how they should dress and men and how they should act they take away the part about the supernatural they take away the part about the prophets they take away all the part about uh the godhead and all these things like that they're constantly taken out but we're but we got to be careful not to add to it amen by God's grace Of course takeway as well but I'm just saying we we we we try to really with all of our hearts just say what the Bible said and we got to make sure we don't add to it got to make sure we just say what it says all all right three more by God's grace I'm trying to be mindful of the time it is the changing of even just one word by taking away or adding it adding to it it is the original trick of Satan the Garden of Eden he just added one little word to what God had said that did it it brought death and destruction and in Ephesus it was just the same just a word added just a word taken away and the anti- word Antichrist Spirit began to flourish remember Satan just added a knot he added a not Thou shalt not surely die and that caused the all the fall all the C all the all the ambulances uh that ever rang out their their alarm uh all the babies that died all the disease it was all caused by adding one word to the word of God it's exactly right so the Antichrist spirit is not just throwing out the Bible it's changing one word of it he starts off changing one word and then he grows and grows and grows in the lives of the those who are deceived all right now he said do you get it now there are there are those two twins again there are those two trees again growing side by side in the same Earth partaking of the same nourishment drinking in the same rain and benefitting by the same Sun but they come from different seeds one tree is for the word of God exactly as God gave it and loves it and obeys it how many love the word of God how many obey the word of God you must be the right tree amen because the real tree of God loves it and obeys it praise God the other tree is from the seed that is anti the word of God and changes it where it wants to well I don't like this they're too hard on this or they they don't they shouldn't preach this and they change it they change how it they make it however they want it they basically make their own they make the Bible Buffet well I'll just take this I'll just take that if God does have a buffet then you're required to take every part part of it amen glory but see the denomination they make it the buffet well I'll just take a little bit of this I'll take the sweet stuff I'll take the the the good taste and stuff and they don't take all of it we got to take all of it amen that's right it substitutes its own Creeds and dogmas for the living true word exactly as Cain did who ended up killing Abel but fear not little flock stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil amen Eve did did not do that and she failed and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of the darkness of Satan let's stand to our feet praise God we must keep the word between us and the devil that's where Eve failed and that's where they always fail Glory now I know I preach a little hard tonight but uh just a little hard not too hard not as hard as I preach this week can but uh I try to explain some things about legalism do everybody understand that amen legalism is adding to the word but Jesus never broke a command of God and he was never a legalist because he never added to the word he was a loyal Son of God the Son of God and that's what we must be I hope you understood that by God's grace now I want to just show real quick uh can everybody see that okay yeah there we go I want to see if this will work here I want to just uh show real quick how we know brother BR was a prophit if it will let me play I don't know if it'll let me play it or not because I got I got live stream going I'm trying to stream the video so maybe that's too much on it I just want to show a few quick things about how we know brother Brandon was a prophet he's not infallible as far as sinless but he predicted three things that we can easily see have come to pass I guess I'll just pause it here and I'll just go back here that's some awful picture my Mercy the three things he prophesied he said the he prophesied of the immoral condition of the United States church and he said the United States Church would have people all smoking dancing to rock and roll uh drinking women cutting their hair uh women wearing uh makeup and sexy clothes and undressing wearing what less and less all the time isn't that what's going on in churches today he prophesied that back in 1965 and look what we got today every church that's Mega has a rock and roll concert going on he predicted the immoral condition United States churches he also said thus sayith the Lord uh he said no denomination will ever break up its denomination and come back to the word of God and you show me one that has none of them have the Catholic hasn't come back Lutheran hasn't come back Methodist Nazarene Pentecost Pilgrim h Hess none of them come back and he said they never will he said they'll take the mark of the beast thus sayith the Lord that's still standing after 50 years praise God that tells us he's a prophet and the last one he said there never rise a Ministry to the Gentiles greater than his ministry and that has stood no preacher has ever come along with a greater Ministry than that that brother brandham had how many you understand that by God's grace that's how we know he's a prophet every time he spoke in the name of the Lord it came to pass and so we're thankful for that our job must be to stay with the word keep the word between us and Satan and we'll be Overcomers how many love that by God's grace let me pray for you let's bow our heads here if you have a need just you're welcome to come up here while we sing brother amen's got some songs he'd like to play so brother just make your way there by God's grace we thank the Lord for that thank the Lord for his Mercy let's just bow our heads and we have prayer for our brother here by God's grace Heavenly Father we love you tonight Lord I just sometimes feel a little uncomfortable because I usually don't preach like this just all quotes all quotes but Lord as we said you sent your prophet he had four years to go over these thoughts and start teaching and combing the scriptures and laying out truths from Genesis to Revelation and we are privileged to read the comment commentary of a prophet of God on Revelation chapters 1 two and three and so Lord we don't shy away from that we want to say thank you and Lord I don't know who in the church has invested the time into really seeking you and understanding these things and hearing the warning of the holy spirit in this hour your Holy Spirit said write it down so the people will be warned they'll know what hour we're living in Lord we're seeing what hour we're living in right now anyone that exalts their idea above the word they're Liars we don't want to add to it we don't want to take away we just want to say exactly what it says Lord I thought of all your prophets Paul and Peter and John they had so many miracles but when they wrote letters to the church they would constantly warn them about false teachers and false prophets because Satan gets in so deceptive and so slick and and Sly as we heard on Sunday with our brother Lord let us be mindful let us have spiritual eyes let's not go to sleep spiritually let's not get tired up upon these truths that we know may we continually let them wash our lives clean let's remember that every Christian goes through trials every Christian must suffer every P Christian must be teased and mocked and made fun of and rejected but Lord through it all you're with us and you know all about it Hallelujah you're walking in the midst of the candlesticks and you held that star to the seven Church age in your hand the all the power and authority of your hand and Lord here we are today with your spirit amongst us walking amongst us doing great things still saving Souls still healing people Lord still speaking still prophesying still teaching us your word and for that we're grateful help us to know that you are with us help us to remember that through Christ we can do all things all things through Christ Jesus Hallelujah you know our works you know our labor you know the weariness we go through trying to battle off evil and yet you let us go through it because it produces obedience Jesus learned obedience for the things that he suffered bride of Christ Fellowship will learn obedience through the things that they suffer Grant it Lord Jesus that will learn to obey all the time please Lord help us to keep our fires Burning Brightly in this hour we ask all this in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen we're going to pray for these two here but just play whatever's on your heart
