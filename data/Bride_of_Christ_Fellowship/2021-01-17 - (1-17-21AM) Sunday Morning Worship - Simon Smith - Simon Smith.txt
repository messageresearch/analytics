everybody's doing well this morning you're feeling good and strong and you guys had quite the drive today by god's grace god give you strength and good seeing brother jose i heard about your testimony there earlier this spring and how god uh no that was yeah it was you and brother vang's testimony about how they gave him the healing cloth there i didn't know that i was i think brother just told me that a couple weeks ago and i was like what oh my brother just came and preached at our church yes fantastic testimony that's powerful that's that you know that ain't no joke uh so we're thankful for the lord for using you brother and you keeping the faith and applying the token anyway so that's that was exciting i know i just got stirred because of that but uh i'm like yeah thank you i'm not gonna sing a song especially thank you for the uh wonderful uh singing or music group there by god's grace let's just get into the word of god here i don't want to hold you keep it holding uh read a couple scriptures here and then tell a little story a little story uh of something in my life i've been dealing with here and because it's coming to war this thing is literally you think it's been raging before it's coming it's coming faster it's going to get more intense and you had better get your sword sharp amen amen if you don't have your sword sharp you just have to go by faith well what about this what about that well i still believe it amen a lot of times there might not be an answer for a lot of maybe let's say as the prophets would say thus saith the lord and we don't know this or we don't know that and but the word of god has an answer amen amen so if we could turn to hebrews 4 by god's grace um we'll get into this by god's grace and uh [Music] oh i'm thankful for that hebrews 4. i want to read this right from the word here this book of hebrews is powerful we know that and we know it came by inspiration of the holy ghost uh to the first messenger the prophet and look what he says here it's amazing how uh uh paul actually wrote this letter to this to the hebrews right here this switches to the jews right so notice now remember this is the first church age as the gentile church dispensation is being opened to the gentiles and it's being closed to the jews okay and we'll see a scripture here a little bit afterwards what why uh actually what takes place here um here in verse 12 it says for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword right it means it's it's a weapon a mass of serious uh discernment it is an offensive uh thing we can use against the devil against uh uh maybe false brother and gets denomination against anyone that would uh challenge the word of god amen he said it is a two-wedged sword piercing even and dividing uh to the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit it goes into the spiritual realm into realms we don't even understand yes sir yes sir it can it can open the understanding of a heart or actually can close it if you cut it a certain way we know those things he says and to the joints of marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart now notice neither is there any creature that has not made manifest in its sight so the word of god discerns all things yes is this the word of god absolutely but we must remember that this came in flesh amen and this deals with this the title of the sermon today here this came in flesh the word of god manifested it said neither is any creature did not manifest in his sight when the word of god the flesh came in nothing was closed to him he knew all things he called them what they were he spoke to them he knew exactly what he was talking about amen he says but all things are naked and open unto it unto unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do when jesus was on the earth he could see through everything he saw them as they were yeah amen now let's jump to hebrews 5. i'll just keep writing the same book there notice he's dealing with these jews these as the book says hebrews right and he's talking about the word of god and then now he jumps right to this scripture here and we'll jump right into verse uh let's jump oh sorry verse 10 and he called he's dealing with jesus christ he says called of god a high priest after the order of melchizedek correct of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing you are dull of hearing who's he he's talking to the jews he's saying he says your hearing's already getting dull yes yes the dolling out of their ability to hear the word of god and understand it yes mom thinks of god where are we at right now we're the closing of the gentile dispensation yes sir yes which was soon open to the jews and if this took place to the jews the first time as their door was closing would this not happen to the gentiles as the door is closing yes that's good you're you are he says he says they are dull of hearing for when for the time he ought to be teachers in other words all of us here in the house of god the husbands the men should be able to take uh those that are underneath them their wives children and teach them and prove all things he says you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god he said guys you guys need to be retaught for some reason something's happening to you and you need to be re-taught do you even understand the first place did you understand the first time right or maybe the door is closing it's just getting a little too dark this bar hearts here in our heads dearly father lord jesus lord we just love you lord we thank you for this day and lord we just pray lord that you would just open bring break forth this word god to your children lord to your saints god lord i cannot teach you lord lord lord jesus lord you know we i've taught many times lord to us blue in the face retired wore out fell asleep god lord and lord jesus they received nothing god and lord jesus lord it takes you lord to break forth this word of god and lord jesus that we just pray and trust or that this becomes plain and crystal clear lord to the hearers lord we love you so much lord lord use this tiny little vessel here god lord is frailty lord uh just a real tiny vessel your god lord and lord just bless these this church this assembly lord mighty god in the name of jesus christ amen and have your seats here so you know i i don't know how you guys are as christians and how your life goes but a lot of times a lot i'll say this a lot of times things take place in my life prepping me for what's coming amen showing me what's coming and i didn't know it until it comes and then it presents itself and i'm like oh that's why the lord was doing this this this okay so here's here's the situation the last two months i've been teaching uh when i have got an opportunity to teach i've taught on the trail of the serpent okay and i went through it i taught a couple times here i taught back home the home church there and uh sure enough last week i was met with some challenges on the original sin serpent seed is it correct is it uh am i interpreting the wrong way am i interpreting literal or should i be interpreting it naturally or is my interpretation uh uh skewed or swayed uh so anyhow right before directly before i was challenged on this topic something took place at work i'm a plumber by trade we uh and i was given prints the layouts brother johnny is a construction man he knows and i'm sure these guys don't understand about prince and you're giving blueprints and work and however and i was looking at my prints laying out the dimensions to run my sanitary we cut the concrete i did my spraying and whatever to mark where i wanted to cut the excavators came in took all the concrete got the excavator started switched uh then to the hoe there and started digging out my trench there and and i was starting to plumb and i had to use my dimensions correct so i got done laying everything out uh um put the test on the inspector came looked at the gauge holding easily obviously 15 minutes no problem uh good to go he says concrete good to go here's your sticker boom done out concrete guys came in concrete the entire thing and i got this feeling something's wrong and i told the superintendent i said get the carpenters out here lay the walls out make sure i'm in the walls 10 minutes later cover is like coming to me i'm on a serious lift he goes and i'm like oh no he walks me over to my okay this uh this weekend i forgot my church shoes and i had three pairs of shoes and i forgot my true shoes but i chose these this pair because that's what i had and i chose this pair because of a reason because these are hiking trails these are hiking boots okay i wore these on mount mount adams uh jefferson washington those sort of things and we're going to go on the trail anyhow today so okay stay with me we're i got my hiking boots on we're going to trail serpent all right so as this carpenter came and said hey sorry you're off on this and i said what let me see your prince i looked at his prints i added him up on my calculator boom boom boom his dimensions sure enough i am one foot three outside the wall i am in the hallway now not in the mechanical room i'm in the hallway my mop sink my vent my floor drain all is walking right into the the woman's bathroom and now i have a major major mistake huge mistake this is a probably a four or five thousand dollar mistake i'm gonna cost my company and for about 10 15 minutes i was just like doing the numbers again doing pulling pulling the the the tape measure 100 footer pulling boom man i am off and then the thought came to me you know what what are my prints say let me go back to how did i miss this so i pulled my prints out that were given to me in the beginning and as i pulled these prints out i had found that they had switched to dimension without even telling the superintendent now i'm like oh guys hey what's this i said look at yours look at mine what's up he's like oh oh no i said come here dave he's the superintendent i said dave come here i said let's have a little powwow here we said i said now what's the problem dave's like when did that change i said you tell me you're the superintendent you gave me these prints he's like ah now we have an issue so i was challenged on my layout we'll come to find out i had the right layout the whole time and we uh but since they missed up this one foot three it pulled everything and that's why my stuff is off so obviously we have to cut the concrete and this and this no bill no fault of mine cut the concrete uh the escalator started digging out where i was at and they hit an electrical line a major feed a 20 000 mistake the teeth of the bucket went right into the conduit hit the wire copper is showing ten thousand dollar mistake they had to pull all all the wire out repair the conduit pull the wire back in i went to then plumb back up and then guess what they laid out the walls and where i plumbed up was exactly correct in other words i could have left it there because this time the carpenter pulled all the way from the the long measurement and worked his way back this way and i was in the wall i was perfect but then i added all the small dimensions up and there was two foot missing there's some somewhere they met the the the architects missed two foot somewhere so in other words if we would have never said anything i'd have been fine and then directly after this problem someone comes and challenges me on serpent seed have i been taught wrong did i lay out serpents here wrong did i do this wrong did i is this wrong or this strong so this morning saints of god there is coming challenges and i have battled about three four wonderful brothers maybe five in the mess that were that was like this were in the message okay and they're coming up with some points but i've come up we've come up with a lot of questions here okay so i want to cover these today is that all right are we okay we're going to review this is this salad in your mind do you unders does everyone understand our surprise seed i mean they can understand it you understand exactly exactly what exactly took place there do we understand exactly is this possible so let's go into this the trail of the serpent here we see cain cannot understand why his sacrifice was not accepted by god abel's but first i want to show you this doctrine okay the lord opened up something now this is fantastically tremendous i want to show that i'm very excited to show this because i want to see if you guys can see this okay all right let's get into this now did the serpent have a name in genesis 3 now the serpent was more subtle than he beats the field let me tell you something the lord i've got a five scripture doctrine i can show you the serpent's name i can show you his dad's name and i can prove to you the serpent can receive the holy ghost would you believe that if i can show it to you in five scriptures i had an itch on my back what do you believe that amen absolutely so let's get in this let's see if i can break this down let's see what the serpent's name is okay can and i can show you his daddy's name he had a dad i thought it was drake i can bring this through the word of god now the serpent who is the serpent let's let's just jump to the scripture now well we're going to jump from scripture to scripture to scripture to scripture okay i mean i know this might sound a little strange but let's just go there okay let's let's look here and in revelations 20 says and i saw an angel come down from the heaven having a key of the boundless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan so the serpent is satan is that true okay now who is satan and peter took him began to rebuke him and saying far be it from thee lord that this shall have not shall not be unto thee jesus you do not have to die peter said this and he turns into peter get behind me satan so satan is peter genesis 3 the serpent's name is peter not only that but he's a time traveler how did how did peter get in genesis 3 and peter get in matthew the gospels and then peter get all the way in revelations 20. but i'm bringing the word saints now who's peter's dad's name the serpent's dad's name jonah peter's dad's name is jonah the serpent's dad's name is jonah is this strange wait a second can the serpent receive the holy ghost and peter was filled with i just brought you a five scripture doctrine and i brought it from genesis to revelation do you believe it no absolutely that was an absolute lie i just created my own doctrine who the serpent was funny huh yeah because it's ridiculous serpents he cannot jesus said this world cannot receive the spirit of god but i just created a five doctrine five scripture doctrine thorough you would think okay so that was nice that was just a little test there i just want to see what would happen now let me tell you something saints now if if service seed is correct you know the bible says that adam said that all living called his name his wife's name's eve because she was the mother of all living right is there any scripture is there any scripture think now run your run your bible minds i i'm not captain memorization but you know how the bible says job said he was you can just taste and discern true word you can taste good meat is there any scripture that says that everyone came from one man sister kristen is shaking her head no what you can do with this one sister not putting her on the spot no no no watch this now watch this from one man he created all nations through the whole earth he decided beforehand that he should rise and fall and determine their boundaries this says right here everything came from one man what you can do with this sister lily was like shy or tricky you know what the bible really says that is a false translation and he the bible says here and has made one made of one blood not one man the bible the real king james version inspired authorized 1611 he says and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on the face of the earth it does not say one man but one blood now if you take let's look at this and i'm not i'm not trying to put our sister over here or i'm just i'm just i'm just showing you points are we able to defeat these things what if they bring this scripture and you're like [Music] luckily god has trained us if we take this literal this is the new living translation if you take this scripture then you must take this scripture as well though he was a god he did not think of equality with god as something he ought to cling to it meant nothing that jesus and the father were one but my bible in our bible kjv says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god we're not to be uh we're not to think of robbery that we are equal with god if we are co-equal joint heirs with jesus we are absolutely equal with god if he purchased us then we would have to be the same value or equal value to what he gave to purchase us what do you give us he gave us his son his blood his righteous blood amen see so you're going to come you're going to you're going to maybe encounter strange things how first of all we got i said brother do you even know where the nlt version comes from it comes from a corrupted greek text westcott who are humanists even in the occult in the west kyle horton texts pulls from the sinaiticus the vantakinis and the uh alexandrian which are absolutely contrary to pretty much all no one has no protestant has ever seen the vanicanus texts but the king james was pulled from the majority text or the texas receptus which was over five thousand three to five thousand uh uh of portions of it and none of it contradicts each other and the sinaiticus the vaticanus in the alexandrian there is genesis and revelations missing but they couldn't sell a bible without genesis and revelations so where'd they pull that from so you see how easy it is to maybe deceive someone or get them on a loop or to however okay so now how do we build scripture this is how we build a doctor he says and that from a child that has known the holy scriptures which are able to make the wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus he says all scripture is given by the inspiration of god right just some of this half of this he says all of it and is profitable for doctrine every scripture we can use to prove or disprove a doctrine you must run not a five that's why when i go to thailand i said i am not here i said i will prove everything from genesis revelations with more than three scriptures right he said amen and however they say amen an entire when he says also it's for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works this is how we build doctrine right now let's see he says what does he do he says re preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine saints of god teach until you just finally say lord this is the last time if you don't do something here i am done because i'm exhausted yes good now why do we do this because there for the time will come well they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lust with a heap to themselves t teachers having itching ears and shall be turned away their ears doll of hearing hebrews dull of hearing they need to be taught again he says they shall be turned away their ears from truth and shall be turned unto fables amen yes amen how else do we do it you know when i built my five scripture doctrine did i use all the word or just five scriptures because that was a pretty amazing story i told you peter was the serpent and he trans time traveled and i mean it was just crazy and he received eternal life now look here whom shall we teach doctrine verse 9 and whom shall we make understand doctrine how are how is your pastor and whoever he brings before that's going to teach you things it must be what for precept must be upon precept amen he says precept upon priesthood not just two precepts he says show me all the precepts lying upon line lying upon lying look here's a little bit over here in genesis and look here's a little bit all the way over here in proverbs all the way through in other words when we teach baptism we use every scripture dealing with baptism amen and not only that we can use the type in the old testament all the way through everything that has to do with this subject or a doctrine we can pull from all scripture if we can't do that then there's a problem but notice what he says in verse 12 he says and yet he said they still would not hear though of hearing but notice it was priesthood of them but the word lord was unto them precept upon precept precept upon priesthood line upon line here though they're little and they might fall back and back broken snare to take in other words it didn't matter how good a teacher you were it doesn't matter that's right no matter how far you can prove it through scripture it they're not going to see it yes remember we're on trail serpent today got my hiking boots on i'm going to use one quote today and you know what that quote is the sounding of the trumpet means the gospel trumpet and the sounding the trouble that means being means get ready for scriptural war we've got to know what we're talking about you can't just be illiterate and not have a clue on how to defend this or how to defend that sister why do you let your hair grow why are you wearing skirts someone can be like you know how they you know how you could get goodness right can we answer that as sisters brother i've seen you at the beach there and i didn't notice she didn't have any shorts on why is that you too brother you want to have answers for these why don't you guys let your hair long like rock stars it's the end thing to do why don't you guys have your ears pierced i mean it's in now brothers we got to have answers for these things wait a second you tell them you're telling me brother that you believe that there's a serpent seed like there's a literal snakes running around absolutely brother let's go to the bible let's run scripture boom boom boom boom boom and prove these things let's do a little study here i might not know but my password is well jesse can you come over and show this brother we want to we want to know we're talking about we want to have these swords sharpened what what we're doing to tonight how we have the sword who how do we have start uh sharp swords this morning absolutely what we're doing today is just sharping them a little bit more taking that stone or honing the blade we're making oh flip it because it's double layered boom boom it's double head stripes flip it that's what we're doing this morning we're honing these things i want not on your way home you long travelers think on these things talk just ask questions challenge play the devil's advocate with one another prove it uh so sarah might say brother johnny well what about this question what about this question but john's like well that's a good question let's think this this this this what about this we must know what we're talking about here right not that we have to be intellectual but i'm just saying saints of god we're coming against intellectual giants the prophet said didn't uh uh who's a bosworth go against uh uh dr best and dr best already had that thing won he says okay answer me one question is uh jehovah gyra does that still apply and he already had the bait set i mean we're playing we're not playing checkers here we're playing chess ain't some dog right now but man said that was masterful because if he said yes it means all the others applied as well jehovah's still heals joel mcguire still provides amen yes lord sure my goodness so let's hit the i am already half it an hour in this is two oh my goodness i gotta i feel like brother cam i'm always like hurry up brother get your point get your point okay so we have to run again here um let's get this because when we're dealing with original sin we have first of all you they have a major question you have to make them and make them answer yes we have that we have a major issue here okay and this is just question number one let's look at this we're gonna run this real quick notice here in revelations 20 verse five and six it says now notice this is the first resurrection this is the rapture right and notice and this was showed to me five years ago i taught it brother jesse's the first place i thought this this is a this is a beautiful angle here in revelation says blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection right when did they get that blessing when did they become blessed we know when they got holy because the holy ghost was sent in acts 2. that's when they received their holiness but when did they receive that blessing when were they called blessed yes notice jesus says i bless you and make you holy he does not say that there he says they already were blessed and they already are holy it is not a present but it was already a past it's already he's just acknowledging what they are at the time of the rapture they are blessed and holy amen they've got it somewhere else so praise be to god now notice so where were these get where did they get their blessing from now great white judgment throne matthew 25 31 through 34 41 and 46 now the son of man which shall come in his glory those holy angels should sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered nations and he shall separate them from one another as the sheep divided his shepherd divided his sheep from his goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left and then shall the king say unto them on come ye blessed where did they get this blessing notice did jesus bless them blessed of my father which is the holy ghost or the spirit of god when did they get this blessing when did they get this blessing this blessing is what kept them yes this blessing kept them blessed the entire time amen sir he says he shall be saying to them on the left hand to bar for me ye cursed into ever when did they receive that curse the only reason they can get on the left is because they were not blessed and they are already cursed yes right where do they get blessed and where they get now notice here this is simple but i'm telling you this is they have to prove this and i haven't asked the question yet notice the fifth day this is day five of creation okay and god said let there be bring forth waters abundantly the moving creatures notice he's creating water life and airlift now i put this one in because i had two eagles up there okay i chose that one of all them because of runner eagle anointing you know my brother i taught it brother randy science's uh two weeks ago or three weeks ago whatever and i didn't have a corona mask and they're heavy on chronomaster over there and the only one left in my wife's truck her car was in a yellow corona mask and i went up there and i said i know i look like an eagle but i'm here to speak [Laughter] so here we have all these creatures this is day five now notice what takes place on day five and god created great whales everything creature that moveth and those things whatever and god blessed them did they ever lose did these ever lose their blessing well jesse no son that was day five now notice what he says in day six day six now over to natural life and god said let the earth bring forth living creature after his kind and cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after after his kind and it was so and god made the beast of the earth after the kind the cattle of their kind every thing that creepeth upon this earth and his kind and god saw that notice he did not say and god said it was good he did not say that because it would have had to stay good but what he saw that it was good but notice no blessing no blessing on the animal life god is a mastermind he's setting the stage no blessing day five animal life i'm sorry day six animal life nothing but it's good pretty good looks good notice on day six as well he's creating an earth and now he creates in heaven and god sent us let us make man in our image after uh our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over everything right day five and day six everything's under us now so god created man his own image in the image of god created him and male and female created them and god blessed them where did those in revelations 20 get their blessing right here yeah where did where did those in matthew 25 get their blessing right here but remember man those in revelations 20 got an upgrade they were holy too they had the holy ghost they were not foolish virgins but they were wise amen these are blessed now let me show you how powerful a blessing is okay this wow my fingers it must be dry oh this is a conditional covenant notice now the lord said to abram get the out of that country from the kingdom and from the house father's house unto a land i will shoot thee and i'll make thee a great nation and i will bless you in other words if he did not leave his father's house if he did not leave that country he would not get blessed but if he did these things he would be blessed so this is a conditional covenant now notice when balak wanted to curse them this conditional covenant passed all the way through his seed line right and he took a parable and said baylor the king of moab and brought me from aram into the mountains of the east saying come curse me jacob who came out jacob abraham come curse me come curse he says defy israel who came out israel one of the same not abraham how shall i curse whom god hath not cursed or how shall i defy whom the lord hath not defied and he took up a parable here in verse 18 and said rise up balaam can hear hearken unto me thou son of zipper god is not a man that he should lie did god lie in genesis 1 and he blessed them he's not a liar neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it if god says you are blessed no one can take it away you better realize that you are blessed on earth well brother i've got this this it doesn't matter because that blessing will stand all the way to the end amen why because you came out of god you are direct lineage from god and if god is a blessing and if he is blessed then you will be blessed as well amen he says shall hath he said and he shall he not do it or hath he spoke and shall he not make it good he will behold i cannot re i i have received commandment to bless and he hath blessed and i cannot reverse it blessing a conditional blessing he couldn't even reverse right good so let's say it like this where's my well the devil's fighting this one see this blessing right here this holds this will hold okay amen now let's continue on here now notice this after the fall see how strong this blessing is adam and eve literally calls every time you got sick every close brush with death every time god healed you every time you needed something every time you needed jesus christ he was there but every bad thing that has ever taken place on the earth was because of adam and eve right right let me say like this when cain killed abel that murder who'd that stem from adam and eve that was because sin had entered in but notice when it comes down to judgment time god does not curse the woman he cannot curse the woman but says you're going to have issues because of this you're going to have some problems in certain parts of your life then when it comes to adam who is a direct son of god he said cursed is the ground for thy sake he could not curse his direct son he could not curse his direct order the power of that blessing in genesis 1. genesis 3 1 there's another thought that goes out well this was just a spiritual being the serpent is a spirit now the serpent was more subtle than any beast and that word beast means raw alive and flesh god mercy this is not rocket science saints right this is not a tough thing this is so clear in the scripture it was a literal brute beast there was an animal called the serpent that could talk he could think he knew scripture oh but he was wild but notice at the time of the fall before he judges uh adam and eve wow oh yeah the devil's fighting for sure wow he does not want this taught notice after the fall this i mean we all know these things why did not he bless animal life on day six because he knew he was going to curse it he was going to curse the serpent which was animal right with no blessing god can do either way he can do bless or curse and because he took part in the fall he was cursed right right right now now look at cain and the lord said to cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brother's keeper and he said what has thou done the voice of thy blood brothers blood crieth on me from the ground and now art thou curse from the earth you know they you know where their one scripture doctrine they're coming up with is genesis 4 1. when i first come to this message i would sit under bible studies of brother craig and i'd watch others come in i would sit there and redo the bible study again because i wanted to i wanted to look at this yes and you know the majority of the people who left was because of serpent seed in genesis 4 1. i'm just being honest so there's a scripture that kind of looks like it hinders or put a stumbling block before the people if cain was a son of god could god curse him right saints of god this this come this answers everything amen are you telling me that god can bless in one second and curse in the other wait a second who bro who who came out who who did kane come out of eve i thought she was blessed wait a second what took place in the garden that's right i'm good what took place in the garden that adam and eve direct direct splinters from god on earth blessing came from here that blessing that was with them came with them down in them and now cain and they will come out of one of these and yet god is able to curse one [Music] that's a major problem they have to get through that first if cain was the son of adam he would have to be blessed there's no way god could curse him amen amen that is must answer that number one now notice atoms directly from god easily proven in the scripture easily run down now notice is there another instance absolutely the the geniality of genealogy of jesus which was of enos which was of seth which was the son of adam which was the son of god amen direct lineage who in the world would put god in their genealogy god [Laughter] it started with god it is jesus christ let me tell you who you are you are the elect seed private word of god amen and they didn't have his spirit but you can receive it amen we are the most blessed richest people on the face of the earth to have this understanding this revelation i stood up for a certain group of people for about a year but when you turn against the word of god now it's on that's right you could say whatever you want i don't know why the prophet said certain things i don't know why the prophet did certain things i don't know i can't answer for him i will defend him sure but when you attack the word of god now the sword is drawn right now it's war and i am going to do everything i can to prove the word of god correct and this message correct as far as doctrinally holy ghost filled everything it is proven all right amen we will fight through the word now notice what jesus said in matthew 7 he said beware of false prophets he's dealing with what people flesh and blood which come in your sheep's clothing which are inward or ravening wolves now that's symbolic obviously he says ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or things of thistles absolutely not these people will not have the fruits of the spirit even so every good tree is there anything that says that a a good tree uh can become a bad tree or a bad tree can become a good fruit good tree no jesus says there's either good or bad he says even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree something that's been uh diseased let me say like this genesis 2 says in the beginning god made a garden he says and in it ever he said trees that were good for food so they were good trees good for food when did when did god ever create a crop tree is that recording genesis 2 he never created a corrupt tree so where do these crop trees come from my goodness things so plain he says even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit a good tree came cannot bring forth evil fruit was cane a good tree beef i'm talking before he was cursed was he a good tree no no because he brought forth evil fruit saints of god you only need the seventh grade education to understand this or less the bible said he reveals he's sung unto babes who would learn how they learned they'd wean off their mama until they can get onto some fresh meat and they said bring your precept upon precept line up online and they're here little they're little that's how they're taught just sitting there bible study preaching of the word of god brother jesse get up here by inspiration however and then what then the holy ghost will come down and vindicate it amen amen a good tree cannot bring forth even fruit neither can a crab tree bring forth good fruit every tree that cannot bring forth good fruit is hewn down and casting fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them yes simple i know but man think about it saints [Music] now let's see where am i going with this here let's jump to here remember matthew 13 7 parables we've all been through this who knows how many times but look what the bible said look what jesus said actually here i just caught this recently he does one parable parable of the sower and then his disciples came and said to him why speakest unto them in parables yes yes why and the answer to them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god saints of god this is not for everyone i have to let me tell you something about me i i am of the i am one of those weaker compassionate people in fact i go i i really feel like i'm out of the will of god majority times i do stuff for people because i just get pulled if there's a poll to help in my in because remember there is there's a compassion jesus bible said they had compassion but if he had a spiritual compassion there's a natural compassion you can actually do too much wear yourself out that's right because of the human compassion that's right brother yes he says but to them it is not given what the revelation now only understand it in parable form they'll never really understand it right how can someone preach this gospel for 20 years and then say no it's wrong i told a brother recently you know what i studied this out 18 years ago brother i what no no i don't think you understand before i said this is right i said i studied it out 18 years ago right sitting before my teacher bible say after bible study bible study bible study and i'm like this is absolutely correct there's not been a doubt on this for over 18 years yes 19 maybe now it's that clear when i saw it it made all the sense of the world i told the brother i said i've taught this over 100 times literally wherever we can go yes but notice what he says in verse 12 whosoever hath what does he have whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not for him shall be taken away even that what she had and he's dealing with the mysteries he's dealing with the understanding he's dealing with his word i love i just love that guy gil look what gill said for whosoever hath whosoever hath the true grace of god implanted in him in other words a real seed who has saving knowledge of christ someone really saved and as a spiritual acquaintance with the doctrines of gospel god has given him what the keys are given the rock the revelation of the word of god amen amen shall have more grace given him how did david get that grace when he should have been killed what he was seen amen and he loved god he worshiped that with all his might amen he already half and what he was given even more amen let me tell you something when david gave grace to solomon so many times the grace was laid on to him amen was bathsheba think about it how many times and he would not say one word against god anointed then david caught in his own sin and god says you wouldn't even touch someone who was trying to kill you who i anointed i give you grace think about it so who had much war will be given to you look at the law the reaping and the selling amen amen praise god give grace to everyone amen we're not giving up on one soul praise god i don't care if they call the prophet false i'm not giving up on them amen he shall grow in the knowledge of christ and the spirit of truth shall lead him unto all truth hallelujah and shall have more abundance more grace more light more knowledge experience all grace shall be abound towards him and he shall be filled with the fullness of god the stature of a perfect man if you receive the holy ghost he said jesus said well he says you're going all the way i'm not stopping with justification and save the case and brothers don't know if you're going all the way to adoption glorification the new body amen and his light shall shine this is this is man age stuff here these guys are geniuses super revelators man i'm captain gleaner i'll be it i don't care what do you say about that whosoever hath not the truth of grace nor spiritu spiritual knowledge of christ nor any experience of the doctrine of the gospel they really never understood it right so someone ah and and for all those who may know brother jesse sister kristen sister beth do you guys anyone else know of chris hall he was a mighty preacher in the message back in the late 90s early 2000s and when i come in the message directly right when i come to message fall of 2001 right before a month or two before that he preached a sermon called two seeds yes and that it's a two-part sermon that sermon was absolutely the greatest teaching i've ever heard on serpent seed amen bar none i've never heard anyone preach like this right when i heard those i had my little dv dvd or cd walkman you know when i take it to work and i would listen while i'm working and i'm just welding i'm just like this is phenomenal this is unbelievable how did i never see this before no one's ever told me to stop and i i listen those things hundreds of times and he had the greatest teaching on serpent seed i've ever heard yes you know where he's at now he believes trinity eternal hell baptized fought from a ghost and he's not even living a christian right now that's right had the greatest teaching of serpent seed yes literally oh jess have you heard that absolutely the most powerful revelated scripture description talk about precept the palm priesthood line up online here a little there little he had it all he was a machine gun preacher right and now he doesn't even see it right i hate to use him as a example but that's an example yes yes for whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that which he seems to have or that which he seemed to have as luke expressed it for everything besides truth grace is mere show it has no solidity in it in it as natural parts human learning and a form of knowledge and of truth in the law the national let me give an example of let me give you an example of learning and understanding i just laid some sanitary and i ran three inch pvc all the way and i had to make a 90 bend and on the prints it showed 245s about five four foot apart right 45 piece pipe 45 and you know what i did when i laid it i took two 45s a street 45 and a regular 45 and put them together glued them together and i made that that way and the guy come in who drew this drawing came up to me he's like and i said what he goes you don't have 245's i said yes i do they're put together he says but on the drawing it says they're 245's this way over this one i says by code the only way you can make a three inch turn 90 degree turn is by 245's it's perfectly legal in fact it's less one one less joint to leave in fact it's the smoother transition so by knowledge he understood this but by understanding he had no clue what he was even talking about he goes well we'll see what the inspector says i'm like i've been plumbing for 16 years i have five plumbing licenses this is standard i didn't say that but i was just like i'm looking i'm just going and to me i'm like he knows it but he doesn't know it right he has absolutely no experience right he wondered if the inspector the holy ghost was going to be okay with that right right and i just stood and looked at him like unbelievable [Laughter] say to god lord give me the understanding let this revelation let the revelation of the word of god end on the holy ghost following us and give us refilling after refilling so the inspector shows up that day and i was caught up in a lift that was actually i was unloading things from a truck on the radar and the inspector's talking with the superintendent and i just watched as i'm driving by and i get done and i jump off and i'm like sorry uh mark i'm late blah blah blah he goes oh no problem he looks great here's your sticker but it's gone just like that and dave the superintendent is like sai he just said you and jeff are the best plumbers some of the best plumbers he's ever had blah blah blah and i'm just like i told you dave i told you i know what i'm talking about right right just like brother said he said would you rather have someone brand new fresh out of school out of to do your surgery or do you want someone a doctor who's trained someone who's done a thousand surgeries give me the one that's actually done the surgery instead of just instead of looking here i want to see someone who can understand it amen and make it plain and prove all things amen and bring it from here there all over through the scripture make a complete complete a for a full doctrine amen for sure praise god hallelujah now let's continue on here therefore speak i unto them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing hear not neither do they understand they just can't understand right saints of god if i was sister lydia you know how to work that computer could you turn this off off the internet for a second just for a second oh okay never mind then we'll save that anyhow so here because they sing not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and what jesus said this is a prophecy now notice he's dealing with the seven parables the mysteries of the kingdom correct but notice at the end of this he says he says but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear amen if you can still see services thanks to god you are blessed and no no remember this is not a salvation doctrine if you can't see servicing praise with god you have the holy ghost maybe god hasn't revealed to you yet that's right the main thing is receiving the baptism of the holy ghost doesn't matter if you understand it it's just for you to believe it so oh i could be right here and say man i don't know what took place in genesis 3 i have no clue but i'll tell you what i believe something took place because here's cain's curse that cannot be king son what happened there i don't know i'm gonna stay away from it that's a little too deep for me this and this but i'll tell you what if you have the holy ghost you're gonna be there in that rapture hey man praise be to god now i'm going to skip this here wow i've never wow this is really battling here i've never had this act so slow now look at this so number one how can god curse his own seedline he cannot all right i uh show me any example that all right anyone that's blessed is blessed now here's the here's the next thing we want to show and prove to the scripture here thanks again i'll be honest we're at 59 minutes now i can continue on there and i'm going to show you something that absolutely that when i taught it back home god absolutely showed something i've never seen before in the light and maybe i'll save that for a second service would that be okay yeah let's go a little longer here we'll we'll we'll we'll close down service there and then back up but i want to show you this nugget because there's a powerful powerful nugget i've never seen before and it really opened up to me now that's this is a real one this ain't time travel this saint you know i'm not talking about peter calling the serpent i'm not this is real a real deal okay i know i hope i didn't throw anybody off really i mean all right in acts 750 hath not my hands made all things now notice this is stephen he says ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears he says you always resist the holy ghost always resist the holy ghost who left the presence of god in genesis 4 who left the very presence of god almighty king as your fathers did what's he doing he's tracing the seed line he's on the trail of the serpent right now he's he's coming to present tense and he's running that line all the way back because in the scriptures bless you bless you again you go he says as your fathers did so do ye then in first 57 he says then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran with him with one accord amen now why could they not hear him actually let's turn to let's turn to john eight yes now these are all familiar scriptures okay but we're just trying to prove a point here yes because these are these things are not in here for vein or vanity but they're in here to show something and only god's elect can really understand it can really see it that's true i mean it's simple in john 8 look at verse 41 he says ye do the deeds of your father then they said unto him we be not born of fornication why are they dealing if it's notice he says ye do the deeds of your father and they said to we be not born of fornication why do they go to that act yes i thought it was well my my dad didn't eat nothing i thought it was i eating i thought it was apples or apricots or however you ever noticed in the garden of eden they always show show the apple tree you know who the apple tree is jesus song of psalms 2. who is the apple tree jesus the tree of life but carnal minds always put the apple tree in there and make that the tree of knowledge good evil but it's not it is the apple tree is jesus christ read song of solomon now jesus said if god were your father you would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god just like adam just like abel for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech in other words this is the first time they're hearing jesus and yet they didn't understand it wow it's new it seemed new to them but when the disciples heard it they said this is it john said there he is that's him that's right even because you cannot hear my word notice verse 47 john 8 verse 47 he that is of god heareth god's words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god can we bring this back to genesis right absolutely genesis 1 verse 27 so god created he created man in his own image in the image of god creating him he male and female and created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them if we are real literal children of god we have already heard his voice we have already heard our father's voice it will seem familiar to us it will speak to us and say that's it amen notice the difference between god coming down on adam and eve after the fall and they just conversed and said lord it's lord it was her it was i mean they didn't have any problem with god they gave god absolutely no problem right in fact they was familiar to them something about yes this is this is the father this is god absolutely but when it came to cain king was wroth right oh yeah well i don't think that's right exactly and i'm not going to do that and no no no right notice the attitudes look at the fruit yes sir just when both come in the presence of god totally contrary to one another told the opposite yes sir change of god this is this is manifestation we're dealing with literal manifestation between two seed lines one is blessed one is cursed one can hear the words of god and the other cannot why am i reviewing this after 18 or 19 years it's already settled in my heart right but i want to make it clear [Music] we're honing our swords this morning and we're just about done saints of god so let's let's uh let me look at this here this one question will solve everything forget blessings and cursings forget hearing and not being able to hear if we can just determine who cain's dad is that would solve everything because if cain was of adam we're all sons of god and daughters of god but if there's not if there's something wrong then there is a literal seed so anyhow let's stand we're an hour and five votes we're going to continue on and i'm going to show you something i believe to be absolutely phenomenal fantastic by the grace of god ever feeling okay okay we're
