testimony of God for I determine not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was

that are perfect yet not the wisdom of the this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the

loving greetings to you all Saints from our church Lord Jesus Christ Grace Tabernacle in warangal City southern part of India and um from my family and our sister churches and the ministering Brethren they all send their greetings in the matchless and wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ so this is my second time uh coming to this church bride of Christ Fellowship and really you know we all allow to have fellowship with the bride of Christ with the you know precious Brothers and Sisters in Christ in the bride amen and uh the the you know the scripture says uh where two or three gathered in his uh Wonderful Name Jesus said I'll be there in their midst amen amen amen let's go to the word this morning uh I would like to title this message uh this morning the the power of God the power of God so please pray for me you know uh mostly most of my English you know I have learned from Brother bram's messages so I need your prayers so without him we can't do nothing amen amen amen the power of God here we read the scriptures here in uh in um Psalms and also in book of Corinthians so here you know David saying that God hath spoken once and he said he heard two times he heard twice amen amen Echo right amen God has spoken once but he said I have heard twice have I heard this the power belongeth unto God the power belongeth unto God every Power amen amen praise the name of the Lord here then uh then St Paul he was saying that and my preaching and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom that means he is not using any kind of uh worldly uh you know speech or intellectual or carnal or you know uh you know uh man's uh he said uh uh my preach my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and of power amen you know my brothers and sisters this message has not come to us by the word only this message was Vindicated by God by Supernatural signs and wonders and miracles even the death could not stand before the message of the hour because this message came from God and this is nothing but the supernatural power amen hallelujah so my brothers and sisters here the St Paul said that that your faith faith is the Revelation faith is the foundation faith is the foundation to every Christian believer faith is the Revelation to every Christian believer amen amen praise the Lord and that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man see but in the power of God hallelujah our faith which is the Sixth Sense which is the revelation of Jesus Christ which is a super sense which is looking onto the Unseen should not stand amen yes should not stand in the wisdom of man not upon any intellectual ideas yes sir yes sir not upon certain system not on upon any kind of uh denominationalism or man-made system our faith has to depend we have to depend upon the power of God Amen what is mean by power power in Greek word it is it is called dunamis it means or refers to strength ability or power it is the root word to uh of the of the English word or Dynamite Dynamo or dynamic amen hallelujah what is the power of God Amen here we have many scriptures in the Bible many wonderful things we can preach on this uh H subject on this thought on this topic but you know I want to go into different uh angle because brother brandham said what is the P power of God what is the power of God Amen and the Bible says what is the power of God the scripture says but he shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you Hallelujah that means if we don't have the Holy Spirit we are powerless yes sir without the new birth we are powerless without the Holy Spirit we are powerless without the spirit of God we are nothing yes sir we are dead yes powerless amen the scripture says but he shall receive the power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and he shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in all Samaria unto the uttermost part of the earth amen my brothers and sisters that means the Holy Ghost the holy spirit is the power to every Christian believer the word of God is the power to every Christian believer amen amen praise the name of the Lord and the word of God is power the scripture says in Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing Ascender of Soul and Spirit and of the joy and Marrow and is discerner of the thoughts and intents of the art of the our heart amen that means the word when we are listening to the word like the prophet said when you are receiving the word you will become the word as you receive the word you will become the word Mr word is Lord Jesus Christ and when we are receiving the word then we will becoming and getting and coming into that invisible Union with the word of God which is Jesus Christ and we are coming into that wedding Union and coming and uniting with him with the word with the holy spirit amen glory to God hallelujah that means when we are listening to the word the scripture says the faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God when you receive the word you will become the word and that means the word is going through your body from your ear and from there to your heart from there to your spirit from there to your soul then from there to your blood that is that means it going into all over to your three you know uh threefold uh you know body you know the word hallelujah that's the power that is the power when you are receiving the word you are receiving the power when you are getting the power then then then then you will become a a a supernatural a seed of God Amen and here uh the scripture says the uh the word is the is the sharper than every you know word and it says uh it's a powerful it's quickening power it's quickling us our mortal bodies glory to God Amen that means God's word is powerful amen I'm just leing from I'm reading some scriptures for this message and I'm going to read some quotes from brother bram's message and uh you know that means God's word is powerful and it goes into the body spirit and soul Holy Spirit plus plus God's word is equal to powerful amen Holy Spirit yes and the word Jesus said he said a true worshipper worship Him worship God in the spirit and the truth amen amen when the spirit and the when the word comes together then you see a great things in your life in your church in your ministry in your family amen hallelujah what is power the word Paul said for I not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth amen amen hallelujah the gospel of Christ is the power of God Amen and Paul also said that for our gospel came not unto you in the word only but also in the power and in the Holy Ghost a brother asked me from Australia in when he came to India in 2012 Brother Gary Walker he asked me brother Samson can I can I bring anything from uh can I bring anything to you from Australia I said brother you just bring the the word with the power and the demonstration of the Holy Ghost you know what brothers and sisters he came amen he came and we had a a wonderful tremendous services and that morning evening uh eight conventions uh oh brother sister the power of God came down in a such a wonderful way a supernatural way you know in the daytime even the the the the you know the outside it was very hot but the sun you know was very hot and and and and and the cloud appeared and stood over our tent praise the Lord and we felt the Cool Breeze coming through our sides and we experiened the power of God 200 people coming in the prayer line everybody got healed cancer gone tuberculous is gone oh everybody got healed because that's the power of the Gospel the gospel came not by the word only but by the spirit of God but by the demonstration of the Holy Ghost so that's why Peter and John said silver and gold is not with us but whatever we have we will give unto you rise up and walk amen That Shook him that shook his legs That Shook him and he started jumping he started walking he started running what is that that is not only the word but also the power and the demonstration of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah these signs shall follow them that believe and God identified God you know established his word by the signs and wonders and miracles hallelujah amen and amen so that's why Paul said for the Our Gospel came not unto you in the word only but also in the power and in the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost fall upon you when the Holy Ghost come upon you you shall receive the power you will receive the power we will receive the power the power to overcome the darkness the power to overcome this world to uh uh the power to overcome for ourselves there are two things that cause Christians to go into error there are two things Jesus said not knowing the scriptures and not knowing the power of God Jesus said you do ear not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God St Matthew 22 and verse 29 so we are just going into some kind of problems or you know going into error because of not knowing not having the revelation of the scriptures and the power of God and we have to have this too we have to have the revelation of the word and then also we have to have the new birth we have to have the new birth and the and the baptism of the Holy Ghost when we have these two then we are the true worshipper amen we are the true worshipper we have the word we have the spirit of God so when we have the spirit of God when we have the word word then we worship God in the spirit and in the truth what is the truth the truth is the word amen what is the spirit of God the Holy Ghost amen so that's why Jesus said my words are not only words but he said that's the spirit and the power hallelujah hallelujah there are two things that cause Christians to go into error which is not knowing the scriptures and not knowing the power of God Hallelujah and Jesus said ye do error not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God Jesus gave the power to his disciple they he called them and he gave the power to them amen and then he called his 12 disciples together and gave them Power Authority ability Dynamic Dynam amen he gave the authority he gave the power to them amen and authority over all Devils all Devils all Devils yes sir nothing is left over everything is in there so we have the power to overcome every demonic spirit in this world we have the power to overcome every kind of Temptation every kind of problem every kind of disease every kind of sickness we have that power we have that Authority we have that d power inside of inside we are born again Christians we are true worshippers we are we are filled with the Holy Ghost we have the word hallelujah glory to godall amen he gave them power and authority to overcome over all devils and to cure every disease Hallelujah every disease Hallelujah nothing can stand in front of you nothing can stand before you because you are an overcomer you are more than an overcomer you are a Overcomer you are a conqueror through our Lord Jesus Christ and he sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick Hallelujah and Jesus said behold I give you the power behold I give you power to tread on serpents and

right right see end time religion is avoids the power the Bible says having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away see many people are talking about the power many people you know when Brother Gary Walker came I asked him to come with the power and the demonstration of the Holy Ghost and when he came he was praying and fasting and you know praying God and 4,000 people attended in these conventions and everybody got healed you know what brothers and sisters I would like to tell you after these people after Brother Gary and sister Deborah they left after they left we have experienced that power over six months that that the ground that ground was filled with the Holy Ghost that the on the top of the tent it was getting it was getting very hot and this brother is getting red and sweating a lot and all of a sudden the weather has changed the people in the in the congregation the brothers and ministers and some of the Believers they're just pointing out like this you know in the I thought they're worshiping and praising God but you know what all of a sudden the weather has changed the climate change the atmosphere change the cool breezing coming out from right side oh I said wow this is so nice you know I'm interpreting for him and and after the service these brothers came to us did you watch that what he said the cloud appeared on on on the on the tent outside the area is with the sun shine a lot of sign Sunshine hot but the only the tent was covered with this you know and not only one day second day the same thing repeated amen amen

shall follow them that believe amen my my gospel he said my words I we didn't Came To You by the words of man's Wisdom yes and he said uh Our Gospel came unto you with the power of God and with the power of the demonstration of the holy spirit amen amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah the power of God is in usall do you believe that Ephesians 3:20 now unto him that is able to do exceedingly exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us that means the power is already in you glory amen yes Hallelujah David said now also Al so when I'm now also when I'm old and gray-headed oh God forsake me not until I have shied thy strength unto this generation see and thy power to everyone that is to come he want to express he want to testify he want

same way where we are mechanics all the 16 elements are the mechanics when the dynamic power comes in when the little spark the holy ghost that shakes you that moves you that go that makes you to run for the word that makes you to run for the Christ that makes you to run for this message glory to God Amen brother brandom said God hates powerless religion I would like to read here the quote prophet of God said character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't reain because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule seven Church ages this Mur

Devils over all the uh to overcome the power of enemy yes glory to God hallelujah and here I would like to read this quote uh brother brandom um he was uh preaching uh the greatest battle ever fought I'm reading this quote here he said there's only two Powers yes and there is one there is only two kingdoms two powers and two kingdoms and those powers are God's power and Satan's power every war every disorder everything that comes along is either controlled by God's power or Satan's power yes see because that's the only two Powers there is and that is the power of life and the power of death amen now that's the only two powers and we are today sitting here and one are the other power is going to control us so let us cast out the evil one let us cast out the evil one let's take our position like the stars of the heavens amen hallelujah amen amen my brothers and sisters here I would like to read some quotes I don't I don't think I have a lot of time here much time but I'm going to close it uh here uh I'm reading this quotes uh uh from prophet's message uh from the time humble thyself all these messages he said uh today we have today we got the wrong conception of power power is overcoming rning wring good for evil that's real power that can love your enemy do good to those that do evil to you that's real power that's God's power see Power to overcome ourselves yes that's the main thing how how can we do that it's by God's grace by the word of God by the spirit of God by the New Birth by the baptism of the Holy Spirit when the spirit of God comes into us he molds us amen amen he shapes us he brings us into that Purity into that Perfection yes to be humble amen amen Maniacs can break chains but it takes a real man to written good for evil from his heart not because of religious duty but from his heart Hallelujah you know amen people want power and really they don't know what power is amen see they don't really know what goes with it the Way Up Is Down always if you want Power see humble you can get amen just get get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before God and then you have got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise because you have been able to conquer yourself Hallelujah and commit yourselves to Christ to humble yourself before him that's really power that's really power amen and here brother brandham in the message I would like to read this uh uh humble thyself he said you show me a church that humble real humble not arrogant church just a sweet Humble Church I will show you a church that has the favor and power of God in it Hallelujah God is going to bless this church God is going to bless this ministry the power of God is coming upon you Saints you have to get yourself you have to commit yourself into the mighty hands of God God is going to bless this ministry when we are walking when we are going and traveling around this acran this a big big big big city and there are many souls are dying without knowing Christ the word Christ they don't if you tell about the Christ they see they show you a picture that's not not only the picture you know the Christ is the anointed word of this hour many people are dying without knowing in Christ the anointed word of this hour and God is going to raise you up Hallelujah with the power of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before God and letting God just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise Hallelujah and here brother sometimes sometimes as the farmer said he went out to the field with his wagon and every time it hit a bump it just rattled and went on if there is nothing in there it makes noise right see and but when he come back he hit the same bump and did not make no noise at all because it was loaded with good things lorded with good things amen when is empty it makes noise when it filled up then no noise when you hit sence some kind of problem you can't make any noise you just pray you read your word your faith will stand upon his principles in upon his solid word amen and so that's why Paul said my preaching my speech is not standing upon man's Wisdom or man-made system or man-made Dogma or de a a Doctrine any kind of things like that but my faith is standing upon Christ the solid rock amen hallelujah he said but when he come back he hit the same bump and didn't make no noise at all because it was loaded with good so I think that's just about right that we get filled up with good things of God that the fruit of the spirit might be known through us amen fruit of the spirit when we fill love with the fruit of the spirit love joy peace Temperance longsuffering uh meekness gentleness amen Faith all these when we filled with this good fruit when we filled with God's fruit when we filled with the spirit of God then then we we will We Will We Will bear fruit we will be fruitful amen

ended the message by saying this is how you operate faith I don't know if you get a chance to saw that or not I mean some people were here but you got to confess all sin uh and be filled with the love of God right because love or faith worketh through love so you must recognize that God loves you the goodness of God leads us to repentance we must see God's goodness in our lives he wants to forgive us he's ready to Pardon and that love casts out our sins you know casts out our fear fills us with love and then that love operates Faith how many can understand that by God's grace I know there's many needs in here um we all have them and I just want to share one more time from last Sunday night I was preaching on fear in the morning we had Fellowship I went home I was going to go intercede
