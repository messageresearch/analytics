[19:31] let's just take a few pro requests here
[19:34] and a few announcements just this Sunday
[19:41] we have two services and we have a carry
[19:43] in in between services so looking
[19:46] forward to that
[19:47] whoever can stay we'd sure appreciate
[19:48] that and I believe that's our only
[19:52] announcement here oh just so you know I
[19:55] thought I was texting brother Matt mcard
[19:58] for July 12th and I told him whatever's
[20:02] best for him will do so he might do two
[20:05] Sunday services or we might us Saturday
[20:07] night in a Sunday morning because he's
[20:08] driving so far he's probably like 6 to 8
[20:11] hours depending I don't even know where
[20:13] he lives but he's he's pretty far in
[20:16] Indiana so if he's driving a really long
[20:19] distance and let's say he's got to get
[20:20] back to work Monday morning or something
[20:22] like that then I'll say ok brother we'll
[20:24] do a Saturday night and Sunday morning
[20:26] so then he has all Sunday night to
[20:27] travel so just so you know so that that
[20:31] may be tentative I haven't heard back
[20:33] from him I'm sure he's working and I
[20:36] texted him on Monday I haven't heard
[20:38] back from him so we're just waiting on
[20:39] that I just wanna let you know about
[20:41] that let's let's just be a little bit
[20:44] flexible you know for that and if people
[20:47] miss services that's okay you know they
[20:49] got plans or something like that I never
[20:52] want to interrupt people's plans and I
[20:54] hate to change plans but sometimes you
[20:56] have to do it so just to accommodate the
[20:59] preacher so let's try to accommodate the
[21:00] preacher
[21:01] by God's grace just to prayer requests I
[21:05] think we were talking about him in there
[21:07] my mother-in-law's husband Jean is a
[21:11] brain scan tomorrow is that right okay
[21:14] so let's just pray that they don't find
[21:16] any cancer in his brain right okay then
[21:20] let's just pray for Jose he said he
[21:22] didn't come on Church to church rather
[21:25] on Sunday because he was on some
[21:26] medication and he was also sick so he
[21:29] didn't want to get anybody sick that was
[21:31] very nice for the Jose god bless you sir
[21:33] he's probably live streaming right now
[21:35] lord bless you brother so let's remember
[21:38] brother Jose in prayer does anybody else
[21:40] have any of their needs they'd like to
[21:41] be remembered
[21:41] yes started okay yeah so my wife needs
[21:46] the baby to get in a better position I
[21:47] think it's head needs to go down okay so
[21:53] this guy's little trickster here some
[21:55] father's now doesn't he know better he
[22:00] should have been you should listen to
[22:02] his father you know no I was touching
[22:06] him today I said now you got to move you

[22:10] in position preach it I say you gotta
[22:12] get in position but we know all things
[22:15] are possible with prayer and so let's
[22:18] trust in the Living God to help us out
[22:20] he's interested in every detail he
[22:23] proved it when he spoke to the fig tree
[22:25] he proved it when he created squirrels
[22:27] our God's interested in all creation and
[22:30] so he does all things first glory so

[28:48] be seated please
[28:54] I'm gonna poke the visual from Sunday
[28:57] I'm I like to look a little bit more at
[29:00] patience because I know when I preached
[29:02] it at the Bible study I know I didn't
[29:04] get to all the scriptures and as I was
[29:06] reading over them I liked but I really
[29:07] like to get to those and it just be
[29:11] great to read them I think the church
[29:13] would really appreciate that so Lord
[29:16] willing we'll do that here tonight some
[29:20] reason having trouble finding the okay
[29:21] they're just okay I want to look at this
[29:26] here tonight by God's grace and look a
[29:29] little more at patience and then perhaps
[29:32] we'll get to godliness perhaps we'll get
[29:36] to that tonight by God's grace everybody
[29:39] feel okay tonight had a good week in the
[29:41] Lord and the great week in the Lord I've
[29:44] been studying this week on the the
[29:45] seventh the seven churches rather I put
[29:49] about nine hours into just the Ephesian
[29:51] Church eight just studying that and you
[29:54] know it was nice church that brother
[29:55] Branham had all those his history books
[29:57] like foxes Book of Martyrs the anti
[29:59] Nicean Council I'm sorry hunting I see
[30:02] in father's books how did it happen
[30:05] brother Brandon had all those history
[30:07] books and some saint of God typed all
[30:10] those out and now we can search him
[30:12] online
[30:13] now I know they did that about fifty
[30:14] years ago but I'm rejoicing because they
[30:16] did that because now I can just type in
[30:19] Polycarp and I can see every time these
[30:22] historians use Polycarp and what a man
[30:25] of God he was you know as I study as
[30:28] I've told you before as I study history
[30:30] and as I study the Bible the more I know
[30:33] this message is right it's absolutely
[30:37] thus saith the Lord not every detail but
[30:41] the revelations God gave to brother
[30:43] Branham they're nothing but the truth
[30:46] and they line up perfectly with history
[30:49] here's here's one here's one argument
[30:53] recently I heard so John got the
[30:56] revelation around 1895 right and Jesus
[31:00] told him you know unto the Church of
[31:01] Ephesus
[31:02] so some critics and I listened to this
[31:04] week while I was working out
[31:05] outside some critics say we'll see you
[31:08] know Jesus gave the letter to the
[31:11] Ephesus in 1895 and Paul died about 30
[31:14] years before and so they see they say
[31:18] see Paul couldn't be the ephesian church
[31:20] age messenger because he wasn't even
[31:22] alive when Jesus talked about it I
[31:24] thought that's a that's a bad answer
[31:28] because God has a pattern of sending a
[31:32] messenger the people miss it and then
[31:36] later he tells them who it was
[31:39] amen right because in Matthew 17 jesus
[31:43] told His disciples listen elias already
[31:46] came and you didn't even see it
[31:48] yeah Ray's God and the Bible said he was
[31:52] speaking of John the Baptist praise God
[31:58] insurance as I studied it out you look
[32:00] at that message to the fusion church age
[32:02] brought a brother Paul preached all of
[32:05] it Paul preached about being daily
[32:08] renewed repenting and keeping your first
[32:12] love you could find all these things
[32:15] Paul hated false doctrine paul paul
[32:19] confronted brothers and told them that
[32:21] said they were apostles and they proved
[32:23] they weren't apostles I mean the whole
[32:26] the whole letter to the I mean it's
[32:28] beautiful and I list there's about 10
[32:30] scriptures I listen jesus said I know
[32:33] you cannot bear those that do evil and
[32:37] Paul said avoid every appearance of evil
[32:40] in our memory Mercia brother it's
[32:45] beautiful shirts to see that that fits
[32:48] God's pattern God will send a messenger
[32:50] the people won't know it later on he'll
[32:53] come back and tell him this is what I
[32:54] just did on a new you and so and then we
[32:59] see the message to the fusion church age
[33:01] lines precisely with Paul's message and
[33:04] also with history in fact Polycarp sat
[33:08] under st. John and st. John of course
[33:12] lived longer outlived even Paul he lived
[33:15] more than 30 years longer than Paul so
[33:17] Polycarp sat at the
[33:19] of st. John and then when st. John went
[33:22] off the scene Pollock art became the
[33:24] bishop in Smyrna and he carried it on
[33:27] exactly like it was with John and then
[33:33] John knew what exactly was like from
[33:35] Jesus oh my
[33:37] and then Polycarp is known he went at
[33:40] nine years old church he traveled 1,500
[33:44] miles to go to Rome and it's historical
[33:47] fact those history writers wrote about
[33:49] it he cared so much about the church at
[33:52] Rome there was actually three churches
[33:53] of Rome he went to the first Church of
[33:56] Rome and tried to correct them they had
[33:58] already started the Eucharist in 85th
[34:00] I'm sorry 150 AD they had already got a
[34:03] Eucharist they had already had statues
[34:06] in the BA and the history says polycarb
[34:08] sat on the front row next to the bishop
[34:10] and watched all the saints pass through
[34:12] and get their way for their Eucharist
[34:14] and then he watched they all bought bow
[34:16] down at the statue of st. Peter they
[34:19] were re worshipping Saints in 150 AD and
[34:23] he tried to correct them but the bishop
[34:25] of the first church wouldn't take
[34:27] correction and Polycarp said fine the
[34:30] Holy Spirit told him Ephraim has turned
[34:33] unto idols leave them alone so the
[34:38] history says he went to the other two
[34:39] churches and he had revival meetings
[34:41] within he's 90 years old history says
[34:44] they had a major revival the last
[34:46] revival in Rome the dead were raised
[34:49] demons were cast out the sick were
[34:52] healed by God amen then when he got back
[34:55] it was just ten years later that he was
[34:57] martyred he was burned the stake because
[35:01] they hated him so much because he was so
[35:03] much like Christ because his teacher
[35:06] John was with Christ oh my
[35:09] it's amazing Church to see now this and
[35:12] so he he did the exact same thing he was
[35:14] constant getting people to repent he got
[35:16] history says he got two of those
[35:17] brothers in Rome to repent and go back
[35:20] to their first love
[35:21] praise God noting that they had to leave
[35:23] that First Church of Rome and they went
[35:25] to the second and third Church of Rome
[35:27] but he was doing the same things but
[35:30] Jesus told the church that they would
[35:33] experience they exactly did the exact
[35:35] same thing and it's beautiful to see it
[35:38] tile all the way through the church ages
[35:40] I'm just excited to go although and I'm
[35:42] ready for the Samara age tomorrow by
[35:44] God's grace it's just beautiful it's it
[35:48] lines up completely with history and
[35:50] with the Bible what a blessing to know
[35:52] that we've got the truth of God amen
[35:54] it is nothing nothing but the truth now
[35:56] of course you know brother man has his
[35:57] own thoughts in there we've got to
[35:59] rightly divide it and take everything
[36:00] back to Scripture we're aware of that
[36:02] a couple examples or brother Branham
[36:04] says all the messengers come at the end
[36:06] of the age but actually they'll come at
[36:08] the beginning okay so if you look at
[36:10] that and then brother Branham says all
[36:12] the seven Church of age messengers were
[36:14] prophets the next day he says only two
[36:16] are prophets the first in the last so
[36:19] he's constantly learning he's constantly
[36:21] learning and having to read correct
[36:23] himself just like you and I or some of
[36:27] you perfect and you never need
[36:28] correction is anybody in that category
[36:30] right now if not you can help me out
[36:33] I'll call you every day and you can
[36:34] correct me every day no of course not we
[36:37] all need correction right we all need
[36:39] daily guidance from the Holy Spirit
[36:42] and so that just reminds us how much
[36:45] brother Adam was a man but also how he
[36:47] was so humble he could be corrected by
[36:49] the Holy Spirit and bring forth the the
[36:52] full revelation of God's Word amen so
[36:55] let's just briefly go over our patience
[36:57] I know how maybe I'll spend a few
[36:58] minutes I got thirty more minutes here
[37:00] to my timer goes off but let's just
[37:03] review patience it's the the fifth
[37:05] anointing now look at grace patience is
[37:10] Grace amen praise God no patience means
[37:14] steadfastness you are steadfast which
[37:17] means you're determined your perseverant
[37:20] praise God you've got endurance praise
[37:22] God and it especially means that in your
[37:26] greatest trials and your sufferings you
[37:29] can be you can persevere in the myths of
[37:33] your sufferings you know a lot of people
[37:37] and as I was I was thinking all the way
[37:39] here a lot of people give up when the
[37:42] suffering start but patience is an
[37:45] anointing of the Holy Spirit
[37:47] to keep speaking God's Word in the
[37:49] middle of your suffering in the middle
[37:52] of your trials and this is before the
[37:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost right and so
[37:58] you know in other words people will give
[38:01] up on God's promise if they don't have
[38:03] patience right because patience is the
[38:07] anointing to continue believing to be
[38:10] steadfast to keep trying to not give up
[38:14] to not lose hope it's the the anointing
[38:18] you need to keep believing until it
[38:20] happens
[38:21] praise God and so there's a lot of
[38:25] examples you could go with like for
[38:27] example divine healing how many ever
[38:30] been sick and you say lord give me
[38:31] patience so I can inherit the promise
[38:33] for healing yeah right we all go through
[38:35] that right and we I'm sure all of us
[38:38] have been healed at some point or
[38:39] another there's maybe been times we
[38:41] didn't heal we got we didn't get healed
[38:43] when we wanted to
[38:44] I know Amen and I were talking about
[38:45] that we've all we both been through that
[38:47] but eventually God brought the healing
[38:49] praise God you know waiting on the right
[38:53] job you know there's brothers from cam
[38:56] Church we prayed for growth months and
[38:58] months and a year and just wondering how
[39:01] come they don't have a job
[39:02] but we kept prayed and finally they got
[39:03] a job and they've been working hard for
[39:05] you almost 10 years since you know just
[39:08] strange things uh you know a job right
[39:13] even the baptism of the Holy Ghost not
[39:15] giving up on the promise of the baptism
[39:17] of the Holy Ghost amen
[39:19] how about not giving up on your loved
[39:22] ones being saying how many knew how many
[39:24] need an anointing for that that's what I
[39:27] want to praise God how about on the
[39:29] person you should marry right or on your
[39:33] children getting the Holy Spirit or when
[39:36] to have children praise God
[39:38] think about all these questions that we
[39:41] have in life that are so much easier
[39:44] when we've got God's anointing of
[39:46] patience upon us we can wait upon the
[39:50] promise of God or if we got a dispute in
[39:53] the family
[39:54] what is this dispute going to be solved
[39:56] what are we finally going to get past
[39:59] this bitterness or this come
[40:00] Blainey or this anger or this division
[40:04] what are we ever going to get past that
[40:06] see the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[40:08] gives you steadfastness in the midst of
[40:11] the trial to keep trusting God and
[40:12] believing and I think we all need it
[40:17] praise God Jesus told Peter we all need
[40:20] it because it's the revelation God gave
[40:23] to Peter right and so that's a practical
[40:28] application to patience how we need it
[40:32] we need it to be content while we're
[40:35] walking on this way we saw with
[40:37] temperance we need to control our bodies
[40:40] while we're walking on this way and now
[40:43] once we got control of our bodies we
[40:45] need control of our minds right so just
[40:49] be steadfast just keep going just keep
[40:51] going to churches keep believing the
[40:53] promise keep praying keep reading your
[40:55] Bible keep confessing them keep
[40:56] confessing the positive promise of God
[40:58] amen and be content serving God with
[41:02] patience so this is the next step I'll
[41:07] be content I'll just keep faithfully
[41:09] serving God although I don't see the
[41:11] promise coming to pass yet I've got an
[41:13] anointing to stay true to God I'm not
[41:16] gonna give up I'm not gonna quit I'm not
[41:18] gonna charge God foolishly because I
[41:20] don't have what I want because it's not
[41:24] really about what I want it's about what
[41:26] God wants me to have because I'm not my
[41:29] own I belong to God amen so this is the
[41:33] fifth measure of the anointing of the
[41:36] Holy Spirit so this empowers you to to
[41:42] go through your battles and become a
[41:46] better Christian right because it's that
[41:50] you're gonna you're gonna continue
[41:51] you're gonna persevere and eventually
[41:54] after this trial ends you're gonna be a
[41:56] better Christian oh thank the Lord
[41:59] see like brother Diggs said you are
[42:00] tested for a testimony you have to
[42:05] overcome with a testimony but the only
[42:07] way to get a testimony is to be tested
[42:10] we all want to overcome we all want to
[42:12] get to heaven we all want to have a
[42:13] Testament
[42:14] but you've gotta be tested to get a
[42:16] testimony praise God so see when you're
[42:20] tested you're confident God's allowing
[42:23] this test to make you more obedient to
[42:27] him and job said I'm gonna have to look
[42:31] this up in just a moment Jonah said when
[42:33] he's tried
[42:34] he'll come forth as gold so job knew
[42:38] that his tests I believe it's a joke 23
[42:41] so if you got your Bibles let's just
[42:43] turn there I'm not gonna put it up here
[42:49] yeah it's job 23:10 now look you know
[42:54] Jobe if you read it recently Joe was up
[42:57] and down sometimes you at the beginning
[42:59] he was real strong and then sometimes
[43:01] he's like God will just kill me right
[43:02] it's not an interesting job and Elijah
[43:05] both said god kill me with that
[43:08] anointing left there like I'm done
[43:10] i'ma quit I'm quitting just take me home
[43:12] and gods like can't you hang a little
[43:14] trial don't you know I'm trying to get
[43:17] you to be stronger and how many times
[43:20] have we said that oh I can't bear this
[43:22] anymore this is too hard for me and God
[43:24] say no you can bear it you just need
[43:26] more grace you know I'm just actually
[43:28] building patience in your life amen
[43:31] what isn't just like humans that want to
[43:33] quit and give up and want to go home and
[43:36] go to heaven
[43:37] we're job 23:10 but he knoweth the way
[43:41] that I take when he hath tried me I
[43:43] shall come forth as gold Joe knew this
[43:48] was just an examination Jobe knew he was
[43:51] just a school taking a test praise God
[43:54] he was just getting scrutinized
[43:57] he was just in a trial job knew he was
[44:00] just taking a test but he knew after all
[44:04] this is done God's gonna make me become
[44:07] a better Christian praise God he's going
[44:10] to help me become the believer I want to
[44:13] be praise God that's right and so church
[44:17] that's what we see patients as patients
[44:20] is an anointing to endure it and you've
[44:22] got confidence I'll be a better believer
[44:25] at the end of this trial because I'm
[44:28] annointed remember everything in our
[44:30] society is just instant gratification
[44:32] right remember this one I preached on
[44:34] this we have instant instant money
[44:37] transfers we got instant pots we've got
[44:39] instant messengers we got 5g internet
[44:43] speeds which is like almost instant
[44:45] gratification
[44:46] but God works the opposite God likes the
[44:49] delay God likes to wait and God likes to
[44:53] put mountains in your way so that you'll
[44:56] learn to speak to the mountain praise
[44:59] God see because God will reveal his will
[45:02] it revealed his word to you and then he
[45:05] wants you he wants to see you take the
[45:06] word and believe the word and overcome
[45:09] with the word
[45:12] everything's instant in America but with
[45:16] God everything takes time everything is
[45:19] delayed in when it seems to us but Jesus
[45:23] said you possess your souls in other
[45:25] words you you strengthen your grip on
[45:28] eternal life through patience amen the
[45:32] longer you have to wait the the firmer
[45:35] your grip gets on the assurance that you
[45:37] have eternal life
[45:39] praise God amen the longer you wait
[45:42] that's what I'm saying the more real it
[45:44] becomes praise God the more you wait
[45:46] upon God the more he proves himself that
[45:49] he's really meant that's right it's
[45:52] exactly right
[45:54] and how does patience come patience
[46:00] comes in the middle of a trial when you
[46:04] obey God and praise God Isaiah 26:3 says
[46:09] thou wilt keep him in perfect peace
[46:11] whose mind is stayed on thee because he
[46:15] trusts them when this patience come when
[46:18] you're in the midst of a trial brother
[46:21] Adam says patience comes because you're
[46:24] faithful in other words that's why many
[46:27] people are so impatient is because
[46:29] they're so unfaithful to obey God's Word
[46:32] in every little trial they give up and
[46:35] say well I never get the answer they
[46:36] just go back to disbelieving they'll
[46:39] never develop godly patience
[46:41] until they faithfully believe God's Word
[46:44] they go through a hard day then they go
[46:46] through another hard day then they go
[46:48] through a hard week and they keep
[46:50] believing that they go through a hard
[46:51] month and then go for a hard quarter
[46:54] then they go through a hard year but
[46:56] each with each passing month and year
[46:58] the promise of God gets more sure that's
[47:03] the that's what the anointing of
[47:04] patience is to do the Bible said Abraham
[47:07] got stronger in faith Lord by God amen
[47:11] we know were they then he has lapses
[47:14] that means he was just like job just
[47:16] like you right sometimes you're up
[47:19] sometimes you're down sometimes you
[47:21] sometimes you make mistakes and
[47:22] embarrass yourself but then God raises
[47:24] your faith
[47:25] oh thank God even you're the seed of
[47:27] Abraham you might have some mistakes but
[47:29] if you've got the faith of Abraham
[47:31] you're like Abraham let's be strong in
[47:34] faith let's give God glory before it
[47:37] happens amen see that's Abrahamic faith
[47:42] so whatever promise God has made known
[47:44] to us then we should rejoice and give
[47:47] God praise I know sometimes we won't but
[47:50] on a night like tonight and when it's
[47:52] being preached tonight the night we
[47:54] should rejoice in it praise God we
[47:58] should be stronger in faith giving God
[48:00] the glory hallelujah and like our sister
[48:06] Naomi's memory verse was Philippians 4:6
[48:08] and 7 be careful for nothing in
[48:10] everything by prayer and supplication
[48:12] with Thanksgiving let your requests
[48:14] requests be made known unto God and the
[48:16] peace of God which passes all
[48:17] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[48:19] minds through Christ Jesus see what's
[48:22] keeping you the anointing when you keep
[48:25] the anointing of the Holy Spirit your
[48:28] patient your choosing and you have to
[48:30] choose that you have to choose I will
[48:32] faithfully obey and think about God's
[48:36] Word you I don't know about I don't know
[48:42] if you remember but the Bible says the
[48:44] way you do it is you've got to take
[48:45] somebody captain let me tell you this
[48:50] you gotta take the thought captive I
[48:52] said that long I was thinking about the
[48:53] illustration I was gonna ask Malachi to
[48:55] come up here
[48:55] I won't do how embarrassing I was gonna
[48:58] have one of the kids come up here I was
[48:59] gonna take them captive and like pick
[49:02] them up and like you're coming with me
[49:05] that's what you're supposed to do with
[49:07] evil thoughts when evil thoughts come
[49:10] you don't you don't entertain them you
[49:12] go to those evil thoughts and say I'm
[49:15] taking you captain
[49:16] and I'm casting you out of here like if
[49:23] if applied it's in your house you're
[49:26] gonna chase that flight down right
[49:28] you're gonna take him captive
[49:30] you're gonna make sure you get them kill
[49:32] them and cast them out right it's the
[49:35] same idealist of the spirits if we want
[49:38] to be patient that's what we got to do
[49:40] we got to bring every thought into
[49:41] captivity Islands once we've got it into
[49:44] captivity we've got to cast it down and
[49:46] not entertain it crazy stuff we got to
[49:50] stay with God's folks and believe God's
[49:52] Word
[49:52] that's what patience is faithfully
[49:55] meditating and believing upon God's Word
[49:59] that's patience it's a trial it's a test
[50:03] I know about you but I like to get them
[50:07] I like to get the Flies cornered in a
[50:09] room and and close the door that's how I
[50:12] get them so we got this big long the
[50:14] hallway and man that fly can really you
[50:16] can get places if I don't trap them in
[50:17] the room and that's what we got to do
[50:20] Church we got to get on our knees and we
[50:21] got to just think about this what
[50:23] thought we're thinking whenever evil
[50:26] thought we got a quarter let thought
[50:27] like I brother Aaron says I like the
[50:29] corner the devil praise God amen
[50:31] he likes the corner the devil expose him
[50:34] and show where he's wrong remember
[50:37] remember Berlin said when I'm tired he
[50:39] said that's when Satan will attack me
[50:41] say he'll say you have no friends nobody
[50:43] loves you he said that's when I get
[50:44] tired that's when I get my mind battles
[50:47] he said and then God will have people
[50:49] drive from States to come visit just for
[50:53] one service they'll have a little Drive
[50:55] nine hours just to get here brother
[50:57] branham one time preach a sermon and
[50:59] prevention I'll take that and I'll shove
[51:01] that in the devil's face
[51:05] we got a do we go to look at Satan's lie
[51:08] and then say see see that that's wrong
[51:10] here's what God's Word says amen see
[51:15] it's got to be that's why I praying
[51:17] before service that's like praying every
[51:19] day and looking and taking taking
[51:23] inventory of what thoughts are we
[51:25] actually thinking if we're thinking the
[51:28] wrong box it will lead to unfaithfulness
[51:30] but if we're thinking the right thoughts
[51:32] it will lead to faithfulness and
[51:34] faithfulness reducing patience amen
[51:37] it is Romans 5 Romans 5:3 my main
[51:50] consent so far by God's grace like I was
[51:53] saying on Sunday I appreciate all
[51:54] special meetings there is definitely
[51:56] something special about having lots of
[51:58] people in one place and like romancing
[52:00] the more pillar or fires you know more
[52:01] clarifying the more anointing there's
[52:03] but church he said wherever two or three
[52:07] are there I am in the Mint's we can have
[52:09] a strong anointing of just three beat
[52:11] two people are here that believe they
[52:13] then we can have just the anointing that
[52:16] God wants us to have for that night and
[52:18] no matter what the meeting is it's
[52:20] always going to be the same it's gonna
[52:22] always be cast down what Satan says and
[52:24] obey God's Word believe God's Word oh
[52:27] man speak it act upon it you can't get
[52:30] any greater than that praise God
[52:32] nobody can get any revelation greater
[52:34] than what Jesus did when he said is
[52:36] written and he stood there and you
[52:39] confront the devil and spoke to the
[52:41] devil and refused to obey Him he obey
[52:44] God instead and under that great
[52:46] anointing you got the greatest victory
[52:47] that could ever be had and proved that
[52:49] we can defeat Satan any time place or
[52:52] under any circumstance
[52:54] we just gotta obey God's Word and we can
[52:56] do that tonight it doesn't have to take
[53:01] a special service or a special preacher
[53:04] there's only one preacher the Lord Jesus
[53:06] and he's here tonight Romans 3 5 I'm
[53:12] sorry five three and not only so but we
[53:14] glory in tribulations also knowing that
[53:15] tribulation works patience
[53:19] so see trials work patience they
[53:23] accomplish patience so see you can't get
[53:28] patience unless you go through the
[53:30] trials praise God and that's where
[53:34] brother and he picks us up in the church
[53:36] age he said then patience gets an
[53:40] experience and then experience gives you
[53:42] hope see why people have no hope for the
[53:44] rapture or no hope for any victory in
[53:46] their life they don't even get to the
[53:48] patience because they can't faithfully
[53:51] overcome the trials and be faithful to
[53:54] get patience see what I'm saying in the
[53:58] midst of a tribulation they'll forsake
[54:01] obeying the word and they'll go to the
[54:03] pleasures of the world instead of
[54:06] keeping God's Word in holiness so they
[54:10] can't get their patience and then they
[54:11] can't get to experience and then they
[54:13] can't get to hope yeah experience yeah
[54:19] praise God let's see then hope maketh
[54:26] not ashamed so when you have that hope
[54:28] you have notion you're not ashamed
[54:29] anymore see what you got oh we have to
[54:32] keep God's word first praise God we got
[54:36] to be faithful to God's word in the
[54:37] trial then we get patience then
[54:40] experience then hope then there's no
[54:41] shame praise God
[54:44] amen see it's just beautiful it all goes
[54:48] together all right now the the thing we
[54:54] have to turn down
[54:56] we have to get patience we have to turn
[54:59] down making speedy decisions without
[55:02] proper prayer counsel and contemplation
[55:06] decision-making without prayer is a
[55:08] foolish thing the Bible says it's
[55:10] foolish to do that just make a quick
[55:12] decision without praying without really
[55:14] considering what we're doing now I
[55:18] wanted to I know I didn't get to these
[55:22] but you know David David was very big
[55:27] scripture makes seem like for 15 years
[55:31] he was running
[55:32] Saul and he would sing songs to God
[55:37] now if David and joyfully sting in the
[55:40] midst of being with a bounty on his head
[55:45] can you imagine sing like a wanted sign
[55:47] on the Internet and then your pictures
[55:49] there
[55:50] that's how David was right David will
[55:54] had a wanted sign on him his picture
[55:56] there and Saul was trying to kill him
[55:58] and he had a bounty on his head the King
[56:01] says killed equity yeah in the midst of
[56:03] that bruh that he meant God gave him one
[56:05] two three four five songs to sing and
[56:08] there's our answer right there when
[56:10] we're in the midst of a job let's sing
[56:12] and praise the Lord
[56:14] how do we change your spirit how do we
[56:16] get our thinking we got to stop thinking
[56:18] about those things of the world the
[56:19] trial and we got to sing to God glorify
[56:22] God is when we glorify God we come under
[56:25] his anointing because he inhabits the
[56:27] praises of his bride that's right now
[56:34] let's go to Psalms 52 eight and nine so
[56:37] I was 52 eight and nine look how patient
[56:52] is
[57:01] now look at verse 1 verse 1 it says to
[57:05] the chief musician mastiha a psalm of
[57:07] David when Doeg the Edomite came and
[57:09] told Saul and said to him David has come
[57:11] to the house of Abimelech so this is
[57:14] David riding by the Amen
[57:16] he knows Saul knows where he is now so
[57:20] God gives him a song in the midst of our
[57:24] trial look for a song praise God that's
[57:28] the time to go on YouTube that's a time
[57:30] to go back to our services and listen to
[57:32] one of our songs this is what God did in
[57:35] the midst of a trial he gives you a song
[57:37] to change your thinking to cast down any
[57:39] thoughts that exalt themselves against
[57:41] the Word of God to glorify God his
[57:43] presence comes down his patience comes
[57:46] down his confidence comes down verse 8
[57:53] but I'm like a green olive tree in the
[57:55] house of God I trust in the mercy of God
[57:58] forever and ever I will praise thee
[57:59] forever because thou has done it I will
[58:02] wait on that thy name for it is good
[58:04] before thy Saints look he knows that the
[58:08] King knows where he is right he's got a
[58:12] GPS Saul's got a GPS I'm gonna go kill
[58:15] David I know right where it is I got in
[58:17] tracking him right
[58:18] he said I'm just gonna wait here in the
[58:20] house of God I can wait here because God
[58:24] guy I'm like a free time that you're
[58:26] leaving a hurry cause I'm facing life to
[58:29] God I know God throws my steps a night
[58:34] see look most of us if I knew somebody
[58:37] was gonna kill me I probably driveway to
[58:39] Michigan or head some somewhere Florida
[58:43] my furthest relative's house that's
[58:45] where my project right if we were in a
[58:47] fearful state but with the anointing
[58:49] he's content to stay there and he's
[58:52] contagious and I will wait because he
[58:55] knows God's anointing has always
[58:57] protected his Saints amen
[59:02] so see this is these are some of the
[59:04] scriptures I don't think we ever got to
[59:06] that would really I think really help us
[59:08] here now let's just look at a few edge
[59:12] fo job is the poster
[59:14] child for patients because james511 says
[59:17] you have heard the patience of Job and
[59:20] seen the end of the Lord that he's very
[59:22] pitiful and of a tender mercy I'm gonna
[59:25] get say amen to that
[59:26] after you get through a trial it seems
[59:28] so hard but after you get through it you
[59:30] say Oh God had he pitied me so much I
[59:33] was such honey how many could say I was
[59:34] such a baby through that trial
[59:36] I found myself complaining more than I
[59:39] should have
[59:40] Amen I can say bender that I thought it
[59:45] was so hard like the coronavirus I can
[59:47] look back now and say God was very
[59:49] pitiful to me because I was I was
[59:50] nervous over the fact that we're running
[59:52] out of toilet paper I got nervous that
[59:55] was my hardest trial in the midst of the
[59:56] coronavirus oh we're down to about 5
[59:58] rolls of toilet paper
[59:59] lord have mercy you know that was my
[1:00:02] hardest I didn't even have covin 19 and
[1:00:05] I look back now I said and I say wow God
[1:00:07] was so pitiful praise God God was so
[1:00:11] mercifully men sometimes church we look
[1:00:15] back and saying how in the world do we
[1:00:17] act like that but did God have mercy on
[1:00:20] you yes does God still love you yes God
[1:00:24] knows you're gonna stumble just like
[1:00:25] Abraham just like David he knows joke he
[1:00:28] knows you're gonna stumble he knows
[1:00:29] you're human but he's teaching you he's
[1:00:32] saying it next time be stronger amen all
[1:00:36] right just like h1n1 like me too didn't
[1:00:38] have a big impact on it well hope it did
[1:00:41] have a bigger impact on us well what
[1:00:43] about the next one if there is a next
[1:00:44] one see it should be trading us for the
[1:00:47] next time we'll trust God more praise
[1:00:50] God amen and it does Church you know
[1:00:57] every time Satan the Bible says Satan
[1:00:59] comes in like a flood but every time God
[1:01:00] makes us a little stronger he raises our
[1:01:03] strength a little higher a little higher
[1:01:05] a little higher and God will keep doing
[1:01:09] that no matter what trials we go through
[1:01:10] because that's his word amen he's never
[1:01:13] gonna give us a temptation that we
[1:01:17] cannot overcome now I want to read a few
[1:01:23] scriptures about job
[1:01:25] maybe you've never seen before what was
[1:01:29] job's great victory his victory was he
[1:01:33] kept this integrity he never charged God
[1:01:36] foolishly did he want to die yes did you
[1:01:40] regret the day he was born
[1:01:41] yes was he corrected by a young man
[1:01:45] 'allahu yes did he have miserable
[1:01:48] friends yes he had a lot of trials and
[1:01:52] temptations but one thing he never did
[1:01:55] that God knew he never would do he never
[1:01:57] turned his back on God amen honey that's
[1:02:00] how we should be nobody really go
[1:02:02] through we might complain I feel sorry
[1:02:04] for ourselves
[1:02:05] we might wish to die but let us never
[1:02:08] turn our back on the fact that we know
[1:02:10] God is in control we might not
[1:02:13] understand his ways but we'll never
[1:02:15] cursed God boys love God and we're
[1:02:18] always trusting them boys believe amen
[1:02:24] his victory was in his integrity his
[1:02:27] wife even urged him to curse God but he
[1:02:30] was patient at the beginning very
[1:02:32] patient the beginning let's read
[1:02:41] well there's numerous scriptures here
[1:02:44] kind of hard to choose here but let me
[1:02:45] see
[1:02:59] yeah let's go to job 42 then let's go to
[1:03:02] jail 42 Joe 42 is the conclusion is such
[1:03:09] a beautiful picture of patience Joe 42 1
[1:03:18] you remember the story
[1:03:20] Joe gets kind of a little impatient and
[1:03:24] he says I wish to just got him to come
[1:03:26] down and talk to me remember that he
[1:03:30] said I just want to speak to him face to
[1:03:31] face and finally God comes down in a
[1:03:34] world when he said gird your loins up
[1:03:36] like a man and God precedes to ask him
[1:03:42] over 60 questions and never even answers
[1:03:47] job's question jokes him try me way to
[1:03:50] be in the balance show me if I've done
[1:03:52] wrong God never even answered his
[1:03:54] question he just asked him 60 questions
[1:03:56] that he knew he couldn't answer like
[1:03:59] where's the where does the snow form job
[1:04:01] show me law where the goats mate in the
[1:04:05] in the in the mountains can you tell me
[1:04:06] where that happens he asked him all
[1:04:09] these questions and God was he was he
[1:04:13] was showing the joke that God's ways are
[1:04:16] way higher than his wings amen
[1:04:18] and he had no reason to doubt Almighty
[1:04:21] God Joe 42:1 then job answered the Lord
[1:04:24] and said I know that thou canst do
[1:04:25] everything and that no thought can be
[1:04:27] withholding from thee now look what he
[1:04:31] learns he learns God now he knows God
[1:04:35] could take away my sorors of my and my
[1:04:38] my bodily pain right now he knows God
[1:04:42] can do everything
[1:04:43] praise God see God could have took away
[1:04:47] the boils if he wanted but God brew let
[1:04:48] him remain verse 3 who is he the
[1:04:51] highness counsel without knowledge
[1:04:53] therefore have I uttered that I
[1:04:55] understood not I things too wonderful
[1:05:00] for me which I knew not here I beseech
[1:05:03] thee and I will speak I would demand of
[1:05:05] the end declare thou unto me I have
[1:05:07] heard of thee by the hearing of my
[1:05:09] here but now mine I see a thief
[1:05:11] wherefore I abhor myself and repent in
[1:05:15] dust in ashes
[1:05:17] now remember James says this is the
[1:05:19] model of patience and it was it was he
[1:05:25] never cursed God in the midst of losing
[1:05:28] his family as money and his health he
[1:05:31] never cursed God and James writes by the
[1:05:34] Holy Spirit that's a real man of
[1:05:36] patience so what does this patient man
[1:05:41] learn at the end he earned he learned
[1:05:46] that even though I was patient I said a
[1:05:48] lot of things I should not have said
[1:05:52] that's why the Bible says all mouths are
[1:05:54] like poison ASPs snakes right every
[1:06:00] mouth is like an open Sepulchre right
[1:06:03] you know something girls like we're dead
[1:06:05] bodies they that's what the Bible says
[1:06:07] in Romans 3 every mouth is like that
[1:06:09] things just few out of our mouths that
[1:06:11] we shouldn't say and so joke learns that
[1:06:16] even though he's patient he realized I
[1:06:19] uttered some things I should not have
[1:06:21] say and then he says I have myself
[1:06:24] I hate myself that's what the word of
[1:06:26] means I hate myself and repent in
[1:06:29] dust and ashes see every trial the boils
[1:06:35] were to get him to repent the boils were
[1:06:39] to get in the scene that God can do
[1:06:41] everything amen the loss of his children
[1:06:45] the loss of his money the loss of
[1:06:47] everything was to get in the seat how
[1:06:49] great God is
[1:06:50] and to keep trusting in God and to
[1:06:52] assure him that the one you had
[1:06:54] confidence in the one who you had
[1:06:57] integrity for he's been with you the
[1:06:59] whole time he's kept you and he'll do
[1:07:02] everything right
[1:07:03] there's my 40 minutes so let me close
[1:07:06] here boy that went fast honestly I
[1:07:10] didn't know how it's 40 minutes goodness
[1:07:13] gracious that really is a shock
[1:07:18] see he had patient words mixed in there
[1:07:24] but yet he had my battles and you had to
[1:07:26] keep bringing those into captivity until
[1:07:28] God Himself come down and showed him how
[1:07:30] great he is helping to see you need to
[1:07:33] repent so you can be patient it still
[1:07:37] need to be repent right because God
[1:07:40] looks at the whole thing I just doesn't
[1:07:42] look at one little oh and I you're not
[1:07:44] patient yet patient's the whole time but
[1:07:47] sometimes he wasn't very faithful with
[1:07:49] it right he maybe lost the anointing but
[1:07:51] he eventually God would bring him back
[1:07:53] he'd say the right thing because
[1:07:54] remember he's the model of patience
[1:07:56] never curse God praise God he questioned
[1:08:02] God he questioned himself he questioned
[1:08:06] others but he never spoke anything evil
[1:08:10] about our God and so God honored him
[1:08:12] praise God by letting in me the patience
[1:08:15] poster child praise God so in closing
[1:08:21] let me just find a place to close here
[1:08:26] go to Psalms 105 19 we're already in
[1:08:30] Psalms
[1:08:39] this is speaking of Joseph from the Old
[1:08:42] Testament I love this program brings a
[1:08:45] scripture on the church each book I had
[1:08:46] never read it
[1:08:49] Joseph was in prison two long years
[1:08:55] imagine that none of us can even get
[1:08:57] close to that two years in prison and he
[1:09:03] lay there looking after us actually look
[1:09:04] at verse 18 whose feet that they hurt
[1:09:07] with fetters he was laid in iron so Joe
[1:09:10] bad pain I'm sorry Joseph two years with
[1:09:14] pain and his feet because of the metal
[1:09:16] stocks
[1:09:17] why didn't he why did the baker or the
[1:09:21] butler write at the butler remember me
[1:09:23] why do you and you know st. was
[1:09:24] whispering those things to him and he
[1:09:27] laid in the iron verse 19 until the time
[1:09:32] came I was right till the time that his
[1:09:34] word came the word of the Lord
[1:09:38] tried him see that two long years
[1:09:47] everybody failed him Potiphar's family
[1:09:51] failed him right in the way the sermons
[1:09:53] at Potiphar's house falen and now the
[1:09:57] very man that saw supernet is like he
[1:09:59] saw america it's like he did america for
[1:10:01] this guy and the guy forgets him
[1:10:05] everybody let him down Church would
[1:10:09] everybody let you down don't give up on
[1:10:11] God you feel like everybody's forgotten
[1:10:15] about you nobody cares about Joe don't
[1:10:17] believe the devil you believe my Lord
[1:10:19] Jesus Christ amen
[1:10:20] it's God letting you be tested amen
[1:10:25] it's God testing us to see it will be
[1:10:28] patient in the midst of a trial
[1:10:36] he was in prison until the time that the
[1:10:39] word came see God's promise is
[1:10:42] eventually going to come to pass it's
[1:10:44] eventually gonna get here but until that
[1:10:47] time it's a time to be patient it's a
[1:10:50] time to build up faithfulness I'll
[1:10:52] faithfully come to church every time
[1:10:55] I'll faithfully read my Bible pray until
[1:10:57] that promise finally comes to me I'll
[1:11:03] keep believing oh oh I'll be patient
[1:11:06] until that promise finally arrives at my
[1:11:09] door that's what Joseph said he said I
[1:11:13] will patiently serve God I won't sit
[1:11:15] against Potiphar and sleep with his wife
[1:11:17] I won't curse the God I won't curse
[1:11:20] these people I will just wait on the
[1:11:22] Lord I know God is gonna move amen he
[1:11:25] knew God was gonna move at some time
[1:11:27] praise God he was gonna do and so God
[1:11:37] rewarded him praise God at the right
[1:11:39] time it sees it because he was patient
[1:11:46] here's the order last thing I'm gonna
[1:11:49] say Hebrews 10 36 here's the order for
[1:11:56] ye have need of patience that after
[1:11:58] you've done the will of God you might
[1:12:01] receive the promise so here's the three
[1:12:05] steps do the will of God first number
[1:12:08] one second here's my five-minute list
[1:12:11] and second be patient this is the order
[1:12:22] to receive any promise of God just first
[1:12:26] obey God's Word do what the Bible says
[1:12:30] and then patiently wait say god this is
[1:12:36] the time I'm waiting this is the time
[1:12:37] like no man says he says I'm sure have a
[1:12:40] good time knocking cuz I know he's gonna
[1:12:42] open it to me praise God he said that's
[1:12:47] a perfect faith is I'm happy knocking
[1:12:49] cuz I'm
[1:12:49] one day he's gonna open and give me what
[1:12:52] I asked for praise God so first do what
[1:12:57] God says that's where a lot of people
[1:12:58] stumble they just don't believe they
[1:13:00] don't won't do they won't obey God's
[1:13:01] Word but after you obey then you
[1:13:04] patiently wait you persevere you give
[1:13:08] God glory in the midst of the trial and
[1:13:10] at the end of it finally at the end the
[1:13:13] promise comes the word comes and you
[1:13:17] inherit the promise praise God let's
[1:13:20] have our musicians come by God's grace
[1:13:23] that was 45 minutes can you believe that
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:31] how many want to be more patient praise
[1:13:33] God remember it doesn't mean you'll
[1:13:36] never utter a wrong word it's not what
[1:13:39] it means because Abraham did that
[1:13:40] Abraham even had Hagar and Ishmael right
[1:13:44] he even lied about his life twice and
[1:13:47] Abram basically threw out did you try to
[1:13:50] cover himself to protect himself it
[1:13:52] doesn't mean you'll never say to say a
[1:13:55] wrong word but what it means is you'll
[1:13:57] keep coming back you'll come back for
[1:13:59] renewing you'll come back for a fresh
[1:14:02] anointing amen come back for renewed
[1:14:06] faith amen why doesn't look just that
[1:14:09] one little mistake is that you're not
[1:14:10] patient though the fact you are patient
[1:14:13] shows you keep coming back to God say
[1:14:15] God forgive me I want to keep waiting
[1:14:17] amen it's always that way we obey God's
[1:14:22] Word we have this test this battle of
[1:14:25] patience I'm gonna keep being faithful
[1:14:28] I'm gonna keep believing God's Word I'm
[1:14:31] gonna keep investing in the things of
[1:14:32] God because I know the promise is on the
[1:14:34] way hallelujah
