bring me this way and we trust to be a blessing to you let's see if i can get this powerpoint running very quickly if you have your bibles uh psalms 65 verse 4. preached a little bit long last night i'm going to set a little timer for myself you can't put a timer on the holy ghost stay there uh but yet we want to be mindful we got a couple uh services we got some baptisms today we're gladly rejoicing that we can be a part of that and uh it's there's nothing like seeing a heart humble to god and receive his word amen it's fully a pleasure and a blessing uh to be a part of the work of god in this hour amen and uh i trust last night you received psalm 65 verse 4. maybe just rehearsing a thought before your mind here blessed is the man whom thou causest or who whom thou choosest and causes to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts all right so notice blessed is the man god first has to do what choose you and if he's chosen you he will want he will cause you why do you think you're sitting in the house of god today hallelujah someone has chosen you it's god himself and now he's causing you to approach unto him that he may dwell in thy courts now that dwell that means to live to stay in that place all right we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy holy temple all right now one more spot psalm 16 11. sure love the lord he's so good this bible is so rich and so deep i love everything about it and i love that there's a holy ghost that can he has chosen us to receive this word and he's causing us to what to eat the book amen hallelujah notice psalm 16 11 it says thou wilt shoe me the path of life what is this path of life that you're on in thy presence is fullness of joy if the presence of god is your is in your life there should be the fullness of joy there not part of joy not a quarter joy the fullness amen at thy right hand there are pleasures for ever more amen let's bow our heads forward to prayer let me have your seats lord jesus we sure love you this morning god and as we're this afternoon and as we have humbled ourselves oh god each one of us and coming to the house of god we've enjoyed the songs of zion lord we've rejoiced oh god to be able to worship you today and we give you thanks for it lord surely oh god it's your mercy that has allowed us to be here your grace lord we receive it we thank you for it and we're asking today on this sunday uh that you oh god as a commemoration of the resurrection lord this sunday the first day of the week oh god in the bible times of god that you would just come down oh god and let there be a rising of the son the rising of the sun oh god upon this assembly today as we've gathered lord we just believe that your spirit will speak god get me out of the way get the church out of the way once more lord and lord we're just like samson in that approach god just once more god pour out thy spirit upon us god let us eat of the dainties of heaven oh god those sacred sweets oh god and we're asking lord it is surely be in our midst ordain every word oh god discern the spirits of the heart of god through your word god and we're asking that you just allow this laity to come forth in a perfect yielding unto you lord that they might stand o god in the position that you seen them in at the foundation of the world for the loving precious name of jesus christ we give all unto you and we ask your blessing upon it all in the name of jesus christ we say amen you may be seated this morning by god's grace we're going to bring another thought to you and we'll need the lord's help this morning to do these things but i'd like to just bring this idea the attributes of the holy presence okay the attributes of the holy presence and as we start off reading that scripture and psalms there uh chosen and called to approach amen so even to feel the pull of god god remember he first loved us he had to draw us right no man could come to the father lest god drew him amen so to even be able to hear the word amen we understand that it was god's desire to make something that when you heard that name of jesus you realize that that was more than just a name amen it was more than just someone who started a religion but it was actually god himself who was calling you to that supper table of the word of god amen hallelujah now in going into this idea today of course we're going to take you to the temple and i want to start in this little direction and remember the old testament is nothing but types and shadows for the new amen and it also paints to us a picture of what we can expect by the living of the gospel of the new testament amen hallelujah the old testament you see that's why you know i've heard people say well you know all i need are these four gospels right somebody say i just need the words of jesus right some people say oh i just need the new testament and they cut off the rest of the book but brother schister this book is the word amen the word is the person of jesus christ he is coming forth in revelation both new testament and old testament amen hallelujah if anything those shadows of the old testament they bring in the perfect picture of your expectation as a believer in the lord jesus christ amen notice here in the old testament it was in the book of exodus well once uh moses went up to the mount god gave him the directions of uh the inspirations of what to build the tabernacle as right and remember uh it was a badger skin it was showing a type of jesus christ because remember it actually took moses nine months from the conception at mount sinai until the actual anointing of the tabernacle nine months showing you that it was actually jesus christ who was that tabernacle that israel was to draw unto you amen hallelujah now i want to establish this because when god sent the temple of tabernacle order he said it in such a way that only a few people could participate in worship oh my hallelujah you know when we come in here it's not just a few of you that can participate in worship hallelujah we'll get to this in a second but we understand that all are supposed to participate and be a partaker in the spiritual worship of jesus christ today amen so in the old testament when god sent up the tabernacle we see there's an outer quartz of the of the place or outer courtyard and oh and there priests and men would be able to gather right i'm gonna go somewhere in just a second now watch this so where that's men not women in the tabernacle there's looking glasses that a woman could look through but she could not approach unto the worship any further than that that only make a sister say hallelujah amen because you have been called to what to walk into the fellowship with god almighty amen then you would have the actual building set up of the tabernacle and the first uh the inner courts or the uh the holy place it would be one it would have the menorah the seven uh golden candlesticks it had the table shoe bread the altar of incense and that would be for the priest only right and then once a year there was a veil that what they could uh only the high priest himself could go into the holies of holies all right i'm laying a little foundation for where we're going all right so notice the high priest there's only one man that could go in there that was fulfilled in jesus christ one man going in there [Music] hallelujah and he paid the price with his own blood amen so i wonder if we could just separate on our cast systems today oh wait we don't have that today all right noticing in hebrews 9 6 now when these things were thus ordained the priest went always into the first tabernacle that's the holy place that we showed accomplishing the service of god hey where do you come today i come to church some of you say i come to service hallelujah god has put us in a place today that we are coming to service amen notice the sisters you don't have to sit outside you're right in this place hallelujah most of the inspiration that were on our fathers of the past they'd built a church where there'd be entering doors and then they'd have the doors leading to the sanctuary and then in this place they would have seeds where they could look this way and then there's a pulpit right here but there's no veil from there to there to separate where the holy ghost would speak to you the revelation is there's no separation that you no longer can come into the presence of the holy ghost himself amen because right here that was where the shekinah glory of god dwelts amen hallelujah it's not a man it's god himself that is in this room right now with you amen hallelujah now notice this i want you to see this in psalms 84 4 it says blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will still be praising thee amen that's a promise of god when you dwell in the house of god you're going to be always praising god hallelujah notice actually this psalm in psalms 84 it's a psalm by david and it says a psalm 4 the sons of korah all right that was the priesthood all right now notice in the 10th verse the lord showed me this a while back it says for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand notice how he said he said the courts david was saying that the courts it was better to dwell in the courts right then a thousand days elsewhere not here not here right here this i would rather be a door keeper in the house of my god than to dwell in the tents of wickedness do you get what that means david's here saying he's saying the only thing i can be because i am not a priest is i can be a door keeper right here for the priesthood to go in oh how he wanted to go into here how he wanted to go into there but he could not go he was satisfied by just being out here opening doors that's all he could do and we say oh if i could only be the apple of god's eye like david was to god and brother branham said remember he said if david was among us now he'd be one of the weakest christians in our midst because he did not have the fire baptism to the soul amen he was restricted in the old testament to this experience right here oh how it ought to make you rejoice amen to think that god ordained you for such a fellowship i love divine amen hallelujah that's why god praised john the baptist but then he said he said that that the least that are coming after this are greater than that he was talking about those that would receive the baptism of the holy ghost stay amen hallelujah now let's get going so what was it in the new testament when christ died remember the the veil was wrench tearing it down so there's no veil between you and i today no veil between the high priest and and the church we are all entering into you see the holy ghost is not restricted to one little spot anymore he's in the whole congregation amen hallelujah now notice let's begin to go through this so we want to look at today that if we were called remember in that day in the old testament it was death to go into the into the holiest of holies only the high priest could go there but your prophet said that if you don't go in today you die before you die if you went in but now it's death to not go in you are called today to live in the holies of holies the actual presence of god now tabernacling himself in you your prophet called it tabernacling deity hallelujah deity speaking amen when a life is so set aside to god that it's god and god alone that has control you have a tabernacling deity in you amen what does that mean that's what god wants to be in you you don't think the devil comes to me sometimes and i know and i know sometimes a lady looks at stuff and saying how can it be me how can it be me it's a devil's lie that it's not you you are called to experience the holy ghost in a level that is this a holies of holies experience all right now watch 55 hidden lights and today he dwells in you as his tabernacle right you're the temple of god now right but we must make this place a dwelling like we were good last night there can't be any any funny stuff going on any any little secret sins you got to get them out amen you hallelujah when in the old testament when the temple was destroyed it was because the priesthood and the people failed to order their lives with god in that tabernacle or temple and it'd be destroyed every time yes we've got to let the holy ghost clean us out well how can i get in there hallelujah but we must live with god in the holies of holies a consecrated hidden life alone quiet with god he didn't say preachers every single one of you are a temple of god as a child of god that means that you've got to live with god in the holiest of holies you're called to dwell with this literal god [Music] that you have been chosen and called to approach a consecrated right that means god you have to make sacrifices in order to stay in communion with him yes hallelujah you ain't going to be half in half out you're in amen hallelujah it's not the law of it it's the desire for communion that's the mistake that people make well i've got to fast as long as jesus or i won't make it and they try to approach god on a legal basis and god isn't interested in your legalism he wants you to come to him because you want him because you want to know him amen you're satisfied with whatever he has for you amen so what does he put on your heart hallelujah fasting is part of it hallelujah staying away from the world that's part of it keeping the word constantly in front of you that's part of it and what god wants to yield you up to a alone quiet with god hidden in life amen now get quiet well come around we become too excited upset about too many things what does that mean it shows there's something lacking the church ought to be a million miles up the road to what it is now we're still back down in the adolescent age like teenagers i got a couple they're almost teenagers now like oh glory to god and all of a sudden i see flashbacks of myself coming back oh god let it not be fussing fighting quarreling and stewing hallelujah you're still struggling with these things there's something lacking but there doesn't have to be something lacking now i'm going to take you in there i'm going to go right to the depths of it i hope you can see this today he says we when we ought to be concentrated hidden away in the holiest of holies with god it's better that we come easy take our time see where we're going amen you have to know what you're going into amen you want the entire presence of god in your life you got to realize that there is a sacrifice of your own thoughts your own ways your own desires you gotta lay it down and fall into what he has for you amen hallelujah now how do we get in there hebrews 10 19 i'm starting slow here having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus how are you going to get in the holiest by the blood of jesus christ amen i accept i give you my life hallelujah i i ask oh god you come into my life by your blood that you shed on calvary amen then follow in acts 2 38 and see what god does in your life because if you're serious about it he's going to do something for you amen hallelujah by a new and living way which he has consecrated for us now think about this even you know god wants your consecration but he consecrated the way he's already made the way so that you could get in line hallelujah he lived it out in such a way you can't live it like he did but you can live out what he'll allow you to live out amen but we're living in people's rights day laodicea where we can do whatever we want whenever we want we can have whatever type of church experience we want brother sister there's got to be something raising up inside of you that says i'm sick and tired of church entity i'm sick and tired of just living a normal life i want to live in the presence of god and there's fullness of joy forevermore right there amen oh how david would have loved to have your spot right now having a high priest over the house of god let us draw near with the true heart and full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscious and our bodies washed with pure water amen we've got to approach we've got to come humbly desperately sincerely and what show god we mean business amen now i'm going to show you something in case because i'm i'm not just stopping with with with uh uh with somebody a soul spirit movie i'm going to bring you deep with this okay now notice in 59 question answers he said well i'd go to church and i'd praise the lord if i felt like it well now a priest is to make a sacrifice and you the congregation notice how it says this are high priest of god to make a spiritual sacrifice there is only one high priest it's jesus christ but the prophet he likens the approach to you being a temple of god that you are a high priest going in to that holiness of holy presence down in amen it's based on your sacrifice you gotta say god i need to know you i've got to know you i will not be denied amen hallelujah now notice he even applies it to this service see the setup is still the same he said our high priest got to make a spiritual sacrifice that's the fruits of your lips giving praise to god you go down and say well i if i felt like it i'd go over and testify to somebody hallelujah well do it anyhow if you're a high priest brother it's burning in your heart whether you feel like doing it or not go do it anyhow because you've got to make a sacrifice something that's hard to do amen you might have felt a little bit wore out from last night don't worry i did too amen but i'm here to sacrifice for service unto god today amen i'm here believing the holy ghost is in our midst because his word obligates him amen and i stand right here knowing for a fact that all things are possible right here amen these signs shall follow them that believe hallelujah a royal people giving praise to god because god lives in this heart hallelujah so we realize that you being the temple of god this is obviously both christ in the old testament now it's youtube body spirit soul god wants to put that shekinah living right in the depths of who you are all right now i want to show you some things i feel the lord to do this today i want you to see this where are we interested in being with god in the holies of holies for the brethren call it the hidden life with god we hear so much and say glory to god i want to be in the holies of holies well what's in there the presence of god amen but when you actually begin to look at it you find that god actually had things that were put in that holies of holies he placed it within his ark the ark that it didn't matter if it was in the tabernacle or if it was carried on the priest's shoulders it was a living word amen and so much the brothers preaching joshua when they made preparation to to split jordan's red jordan c right jordan river when they went to do that they sent the art 2 000 cubits or spans or whatever it was in front of the people so that was the waters would open up again by that ark that ark is power amen that ark has christ himself the word and god has called you now to be in what in direct communion with that ark that's what it is right there that is the furniture he ordained in that ark but what what what what's in that ark and after the second bale the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden censor and the ark of the covenant overlaid about with gold wherein that means inside of that ark now watch this inside of that heart was the golden pot that had manna and aaron's rod that budded and the tables of the covenant and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercy seat of which we cannot now speak particularly oh my god i want you to see this now watch within that ark god placed attributes of his divine presence that you would be a partaker of if you go into that holies of holies all right and what was it we see what the ten commandments we see aaron's rod and we see the man of the pot of manna these are all in there well they're just in there because it sounds good god has a plan for his entire word amen it has to mean something there's something god is trying to show you in his word amen he want to put it there god does not let the word doesn't come haphazardly remember even when jesus christ come brother branham said jesus did not live his life haphazardly every move had a purpose every word had a purpose he said oh if he could just live like that amen to realize that christ in you it has a purpose amen your everywhere your every thought your every action amen it has a purpose yes we've got to move into deeper realms of christ and then we'll live it out hallelujah living in the holies of holies feeding on the arts contents is where we want to spend some time today i believe we've got a great start now remember this word is so deep yes that brother branham would preach the message influences and in that message he would talk about the burners of the of the uh of the incense the seraphims and he went in that message and said in order to live in heaven with god he said those seraphims had to have wings over their face over their feet and then what two wings to fly with we're talking about the same holies of holies experience amen but that one's in heaven that's why i'm saying this word is so deep that god anointed the prophet to say that you should be like the seraphims a burner of the incense a burner of the prayers unto god amen remember he said those three sets of wings were watched reverence humility and action amen hallelujah you got to be reverend you got to know that god's here right now he's watching you he's seeing how you're responding to the word he's seeing what you're going to do with it amen he's saying if you apply token today amen he wants to see if you're humbled by his presence in your midst many times god cannot come to a service because we're not humble enough to receive him we're not reverent enough to receive him he wants to be here oh hallelujah if we brought the president of some country in here we'd all be so humbled we'd all be so particular and that's just a man a failure of flesh at best see what if what is trump come in the room well depending who you are you'd sit right there and go i cannot believe he's here what if the god of all creation he could humble himself in such a way that he said i'll come right in the midst of him i'll dwell right there will they receive me will they believe that that i'm there will they treat me like i'm there and if they will what could happen there and god requires you have reverence humility then action to get on the move for him wings to fly with but we're working with the holies of holies today and i want to show you these things that first one that he mentioned was manna he put manna in that ark of the covenant that you would be able to feast on in that presence now watch psalm 78 and it rained down man upon them to eat and had given them the corn of the corn of heaven man did eat angels food he sent them meat to the fall oh man as they were leaving egypt they needed something to eat they were going through wilderness they didn't have crops anything like that god rained down manna for them hallelujah he rained it down every day factually rained it down every day my this is part of the holy holy experience absolutely hallelujah what was christ showing that it was john 6 47 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me have everlasting life i am that bread of life amen hallelujah your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead ah this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die i am the living bread which came down from heaven amen hallelujah where the eagles are where the carcass is the ego shall gather amen hallelujah and christ said that that manner that fell down to israel in dry times he said that was a type of himself i'm going somewhere with this now hold on he said i am the he said if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i give for the life of the world so in that holies of holies god had aaron told moses to have aaron they they took some of that manna and they put it in a golden pot and they placed it in the ark of the covenant what was that for it was a type it was going into this type of experience that we need to know what these things were and what they how they pertain to us revelations 2 17 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saying he that receiveth it yes so now god promises that he'll give you a hidden manner to the overcomer remember the seven church age received the rewards of all the other church ages so this is applicable to your walk with god let me show you what the prophet said about this all right now it's beautiful now watch this question answer 61 he says and christ is that hidden manna that comes from god of heaven afresh every day if you're living in the holies of holies this is for you that christ himself can pour upon you every day watch this we can't say well two weeks ago i had a great experience of god oh come on now this is factual i know we're tired i'm tired too but but like i'm still stuck in heaven i just don't move right back in amen but i'll tell you this you don't have to have a fresh experience from two weeks ago you don't need one from last night god ordained that you would come into such a communion with him that every single day you would be abiding in this holies of holies i'm going to show you something just a little bit here he says every day fresh now watch us this should be your expectation if you're there a new blessing a new something coming from god well it's not on emotion brother cam it's not on the supernatural don't let it's not on the major of it brother sister you've got to realize that the experience i mean who could go up to brother branham and say you know what you can't live 80 in the in the spiritual realm of visions you can't do it you can't let that gift operate in you every day all day that would be completely contradictory to what god was trying to establish with that angel hallelujah and in revelations 3 when christ himself gave the message to the angel he was to give it to you so that you could be a partaker in the same message that he received amen that's why brother sister this message it is required that you get into that holies of holies so when you wake up in the morning some of you really need some coffee i have i mean my wife do two runs this morning i need it hallelujah but did you realize that there's something spiritual that god wants to move with you every single day right we have christians on there i think i went through where was it at hobby lobby god bless them they want to be christian you know but they had a little little sign there and it said it said uh he said [Music] every day i've got to have a cup of coffee in god but you know what factually if i don't have coffee i still got god amen now whether you know it or not god can give you victory over being groggy in the morning god can give you victory for being a crab in the morning he can wake you up in the morning brother cam you're just saying something no it is factual that our god can do these things amen but you know what it is your life might start going that way and then you because death and life are in the power of the tongue you start saying well i'm not a morning person somebody say i am a morning person you are speaking the promise of that word over yourself good or bad amen that's why you say i am a son of god amen i'm filled with the holy ghost and fire amen every day god has promised me a fresh experience with him amen i've got joy in the morning his mercies are new right when i wake up amen there's a new song in my heart today to sing the love of jesus amen god is wanting to empower the spoken word on you but we find so many times that we actually get into trusting carnality the way we feel right when god comes over you there's feelings we can try to major on one quote that he said the the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation but you can't cut the quote off and say but the works of jesus christ working through them i think i said this at home the other day it's like your prophet said he said how can a man on fire sit still he can't sit still hallelujah pass around the matches let me see what you do when you're on fire let me see how much you can contain yourself in the house of god if i set a mess here right now you just want you to start kicking or whatever you do you'd find yourself moving by that fire it's the same thing with the baptism of the holy ghost he's trying to move you into a condition that you don't care what it is i'll do what you want me to do god i'll yield to your spirit honestly if the utterance comes to me i'll speak it out amen because i'm on fire for god hallelujah what is it if you're living the holy ghost there's a new blessing every day there's a new something coming from god i love this because the prophet never said what it was there might be a new revelation it might be a new prophetic herb over you it might be a new bar thrown over you again and again and again he said that hidden manna coming down from god out of heaven christ then we feast upon this manna which is christ and he sustains us through the journey till we reach the land on the other side that manna did not stop until they got to the to the promised land it could not stop hallelujah and i'm not saying that's the holy ghost because it's also a type of the millennium hallelujah and that manna falls fresh every day for you oh glory to god brother cam get the matches out hallelujah hallelujah we ought to be the happiest people in the world hallelujah it's sad that the prophet said the sickest body that i know of in the world it's a church of god we're not sick hallelujah we can't accept that we can't accept starch or any of that we need to be so yielded to god no matter what it is we'll do it the prophet talked about humiliation and he said if god wanted to humiliate you he said he said god will get you around a bunch of co-workers and he'll fall on you and want you to speak in tongues in front of them would you do that yes sir yes sir but i'll tell you what if you go out on your in your co-workers and you're scared of god you don't want to talk about god you don't want to live out god hey anybody been to a job site i know brother johnny is anybody else done work you could be on any job site nurse or whatever it is there's people sometimes they just can't contain themselves they'll start screaming something saying nasty words saying nasty things they can't control themselves right you're telling me that the devil can get so much on them that they'll carry on like that right but there's never anything wrong over your heart the holy ghost moving on you all day where you just shout out say praise the living god jesus christ i can't call the cattle black brother sister hallelujah i'll tell you one time i was on a job site i'll tell you his testimony one time i was on a job site and and i was playing the message in this room and i was doing some plumbing over here in the corner and and some guy he walked in and he came up to me he said and this is just how he did it he said he said hey you there is this crazy light that's all over you and i looked at him like this and he said he said i know what you are he said you're jesus in disguise [Music] that's what he said [Applause] i said yeah i'm a christian and he goes he goes i knew you were i knew you were he said the other day he said when we were over there standing in that group before work he said they started telling a dirty joke he said and you turned your head and walked away [Applause] he said i knew it i knew it and now i see this crazy light all around you he said i know it's the real deal and i shared the message of jesus christ right there with him amen sometimes god will open up the eyes of people around you to show that god is of you with you and in you amen you've got to expect it amen you've got to believe it you've got to live this word out amen hallelujah oh brother cam you're making yourself out to be something special i'm just saying nobody else was shocked that i was more shocked than he was [Music] hallelujah god let that happen twice in six months the next time we went to get some piping hot peas and those pizza and we walked in there and we walked in the door me and my wife my kids and so you can eat buffet we're there for business you know and we walk in there we pay and there's some guy sitting in the corner and he's just staring at us like this he just kept staring at us and i just kept on looking at him like okay it's kind of creepy this is creepy straight creepy and so we did all our things and and we we sat a couple couple little rows over from him he just kept staring at us and so i'm like man i got to man up i got to man up on this this is a little bit creepy and so anyway i look over at him he's still staring right at me and i looked at him saying hey how you doing and he said he go he goes you're a christian aren't you i didn't have my jesus gear on i wasn't i wasn't packing packing my jesus hat i had nothing he said you're a christian aren't you i said yeah i said how do you know he said there's this real bright light that's around you and your family and i looked at them it already happened at the job site and i said i said uh i said you mean like an anointing he said no it's a light and it's spiritually around you i didn't see no lie i didn't even feel god i felt the need for peter hallelujah but god was there amen he encompasses around them that fear him amen that's what this is he's not just around me he's around you amen you might not see him you might not feel them but love the lord your god and he will make a testimony out of it amen hallelujah i got to witness the message to him too but what is it well we're moving we're i already got way ahead of everything just by doing that there's a place that god wants you to walk with him he's desiring to live it out in your life what is it he wants you to live in this holy holies in such a way well what do you need you need to be in expectation of this god every day i need a fresh new blessing i want you to see that the manna types the word the word does not just uh reveal itself in just a intellectual form i read my bible today but just like in the natural you eat that manna and then it brings forth a life god wants to fill your life with an energy that will live this supernatural gospel out amen and this is till the rapture you won't need it after that look at hiddenly 55. i will give to him the hidden man i'll give to him a stone with his name in it you you get what i mean notice what he says what's this in manna what's this holy so holy entering into the adoption or the hidden place with god that's what it is see what the adoption is see what you find in your places see what you're getting serious about god and what learning how to yield yourself to god is he's positionally placing you in the body watch he says ministers of the gospel don't care about your denominations and what the world thinks but seek to enter into the hidden manna where the full revelation of god is make love perfect in your heart see what one of those blessings might be the love of god so overwhelming you in a day that maybe you're not normally like that but you find out that whoa the holy ghost just moved a supernatural moving love in my life have you ever been there i know what it's like you know it's like when when when when you've got to brother branson in his early church at pastoring he said that when the people would leave they just cry so in love with one another oh god let us get back to them let us get that fresh blessing amen from god every day amen and you and god and everything else is at rest you're you're at rest you're at peace let anything come what may you're hidden away what a place to live oh just let me abide there as the song said let me rest need the tree where uh so freely flows where the lamb is the light and the soul of the saved never die that's in the holiest of holies remember i was talking about those 3 000 promises anybody count yours up last night well brother cam i've experienced 462. oh well that means there's still 2 500 et cetera hallelujah there's that much god for you to receive amen so what was the manna so it's a fresh daily supply of heaven's food for the journey a new blessing a spirit gift or revelation for perfect spiritual health no hunger they had manna so they wouldn't be hungry hidden in manna or the living in the message of the hour never stagnates contaminates in the holy holies two was what within there was the right of aaron all right now i got to hurry up the rod in the old testament it symbolizes use as a walking staff to to shepherd uh the sheep as a king would use to ride to judge all right now watch this in number 17 we have that god is actually ordaining who he would choose to be his priesthood and it was it was the levites the tribe of levi that was chosen to do that i'm just making it short now notice that third paul what god told brother abraham he said i'll meet you in there watch this and thou shalt lay all these all these sticks in the tabernacle congregation for the testimony where i meet with you that holiness of holies is the place that god meets with you i'm not speaking something that's that's that's unapproachable brother sister right i'm trying to bring you the revelation of what is possible in your midst so that you can reach out you know the prophet said don't ask god for small things he said ask god for big things amen hallelujah i ask for deliverance i ask for the power of god amen i ask for the power to live consecrated unto you lord i ask to be a living representative of the power of jesus christ on this earth the world needs it as long as your motive and emotives and objectives are right you have the revelation of authority you have the humility of the reverence it's going to live out hallelujah that's what the third paul was i'll meet you in there same thing as my brother said last night matthew 6 you've got to go in the closet you got to go pray to god the scripture said in matthew 6 that he that heareth in secret will reward you openly hallelujah he rewards you just for doing it so what was it what was that rod doing it was symbolizing the chosen priesthood of god it should come to pass that the man's rod whom i shall choose shall blossom and i'll make to cease for me the murmurings of the children of israel whereby they murmur against you you know why god gave him manna because they were murmuring you know why he gave them the choosing of the priesthood so they wouldn't murmur you know the prophet said that the worst he said the crown of satan yes is a complainer a murmur a complainer they're not happy with anything they're not satisfied with what god's gave them they just sit right there and what they're always just being negative hallelujah and why because they provoked him in the wilderness they entered not into that land amen but notice when you're living in the holies of holies god ceases your murmuring amen he allows it to stop amen because you're living so much in the presence of god that there's no room for complaining why there's a fresh new experience every day amen there's a new blessing new revelation new move of god he's going to do something amen hallelujah look at this ride of god what was it he left that rod of god there to show the choosing and the elected of god all right ephesians was all about what that mature church at the rapture that adoption it's what it's a revelation of predestination that you were chosen to be in there hallelujah notice what did it do when it's put in there behold the rod of aaron for the house of levi bodied and brought forth buds bloom blossoms and yielded almonds what does that mean it's the same as the menorah when god set up the menorah he set it up with a an uh the balls the knots and the and the flowers yes actually i got that the knot the flower in the bowl which was the fruit all right three works of grace god would show on the people that he chose to be in the holiest of holies three works of grace would live out over them notice anytime they had the need to show the world or to show israel who was the call of priesthood all they'd have to do is show that rod it stayed in there remember this was a walking stick with nothing on it but it because it lived in the presence of god it what it showed three works of grace and notice that ball was huge hallelujah notice what he said he said there's many people tonight professing christianity who's dead who doesn't bear any fruits there's nothing in their life they seem to be helpless hopeless you're in the hole he's a holiest brother sister this revelation brings you into it they wander along just knowing that they belong to church your revelation you see you're sitting in these pews is not just because you belonged a message or you belong to a church you're here to live under the attributes that were given in the holies of holies this word brings you to it he said that's not only in the presbyterian lutheran so far that's in pentecostals that's right it's the truth what you need today is come in before christ you know we need to do if you're looking at this you're saying brother cam i don't know about all this then what you need to do is come into christ amen look what happened now the first thing he had to be refreshed to bring forth buzz about it out not only did it bud it brought forth blossoms not only did it blossom but it brought forth fruit now watch us and that's the way you'll be every believer that throws himself the outside out of the outer courts into the veil where christ is hide your life away you'll be refreshed butted blossomed and bear fruits of the spirit you got no joy you're not in his presence well times are tough there's a joy for that peace long suffering all these the fruits of the spirit are love joy peace i can't it's a different version of the bible i could probably say it but it isn't gonna be exactly right hallelujah but notice he says notice what he says it'll bear the fruits of the spirit if you've got the three works of grace you're gonna bear the yeah it's the fruit of the spirit you have the spirit you're gonna bear the fruit of it that's right amen you'll be a worker in your community how many a worker in the community glory you see you can't hide the light god help me god help me amen you'll be a soul winner for jesus you'll be a new person old things will pass away tradition of men will fail but your heart will be burning with the love of god brother can get the matches out amen hallelujah so jesus come to the tree to look for fruit on it it had everything but fruit remember you cursed the fig tree yes everything but fruit and that's what's the matter with our church today we got everything but fruit we can shout we can speak in tongues we can argue the scriptures we can teach our fiati but when it comes to fruit bearing the tree is very lean what is the fruits of the spirit love joy peace long suffering jones goodness patience he did better me it shows manny is still outside on the first altar you're still open to the public you're still listening to hear what john's got to say about it what the neighbor will think or something for yourself but one's behind the veil and the curtains has dropped you're hitting god through christ amen you see it you see how they're so specific you've got you got the manna then you got the rod each one of them are playing a different attribute notice what's three perfection these will bring the shekinah glory out of your life three no you don't need to go see what cecil demilles or whatever he's got going on is the ten commandments in that ark oh my god exodus 24 12 and the lord said to moses come up to me in the mount and be there and i will give thee tables of stone and a law and commandments which i have written that thou mayest teach them he wanted the ten commandments in there so that what he could reveal the word to you yes hallelujah [Music] there they are i was just reading something before and and a sister in a church went to a garage sale and she bought me a martin luther catechism book from the early 90s like 1905 or something like that it's in really good shape and he had a preface in the whole thing and he said he went to all the churches that claimed to be lutheran and he's seen how backslid they were and he said to think that the ministry came to this and so he said he said he ended up writing the catechism because of that and he said the first thing that he said the the preachers were not teaching the people the word of god he said the worst thing he seen in the church he said that people were coming to church but he said when they would leave church they would be no different than the world that's what even a message denominational experience will produce amen hallelujah it's got to be living amen it's got to be in duty it's got to be living in the holies of holies amen the reason i said that was because in there he said he said the vast majority of people that are in our churches have no idea what the ten commandments even are he said you preachers he said the first thing you do he said teach teach your people those 10 commandments i just thought that was neat because you got to get them the word of god he said they're living like the world well no one they only know the ten commandments right we got a revelation so high that we realize that all ten commandments are revealed in just two hallelujah love the lord your god with all your heart your mind your soul amen and then love your neighbor as yourself amen this revelation is fulfilled amen in our midst hallelujah i got time i got to hurry up oh glory to god i'm at one hour hallelujah pass around the matches hallelujah i'm going quick i want to go quick gotta be a nice preacher say lord can you say it through me quicker so i felt like brother brandon i said oh god it's like brother branstad said this takes me it just takes me hours to do it it takes me to do that and i preach even fast preach real fast hallelujah but you get a lot hallelujah it's trying to feed you the word amen amen so notice within that which was the most important watch this was actually the ten commandments for the two tables of stone watch us the lord said unto moses write thou the words for after the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with israel that word that he enjoined you to was the covenant that actually sees you through it brought you back to the unconditional covenant not all but grace the revelation is grace well if grace is on you then how do you establish that with the word that's what we want to see all right notice the covenant in theology the covenant of works is that implied the commands prohibitions promises of god the promise of god to man that man perfects obedience should entitle him to happiness and do and live that do and die god gave them the word so they'd be happy if you would live the word then the blessings of the book would be upon you that's why we have to be a bible loving people amen read the bible believe that watch that there be a spirit of god to energize this word inside of you that's why the prophet called it and jesus called in john 4 the spirit and the truth he said that when you when the word is preached god will actually bring the spirit to energize that word inside of you if you believe that's what he's doing hallelujah watch and moses said under exodus 16 30. moses and error take apart and put an omar full man in there and lay it up before the lord to be kept for your generations as the lord commanded moses so aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept you know what the testimony was they said it was called the testimony because it contained in it the law which was a testimony or testification of the mind and will of god unto israel now watch this the ark was called the ark of the testimony the ark of the covenant so you see the manna is there the rod is there but the ark does not get its name after those two it gets its name after the word of god the tables that were put inside of it now this is very important so you've got to catch this because notice he calls it the testimony what is that it's the testification of the mind and will of god unto you did you notice that it's god's mind to you hebrews 10 15 where of the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts not just hearts but in their minds will i write them hallelujah amen the purpose what the attribute god is trying to express with the ark and the shekinah the key thing is he wants his own mind testimony to roll through you you see that's why brother sister that when god brings a hope to you of faith right god god will bring something in front of you and you'll say man i feel like that needs to be mine god's gonna save that soul i just not you see it's not different than the word because his will is the word so you've got to recognize that that is the will of the word living through you that means that the whole directive of the holy ghost inside of you is to live out in a supernatural way way fulfilling every unique thing that he has promised to you as a believer see it might not be on me hallelujah for the saving of sister naomi's aunt my brother bang's dead that that might not be written on my heart but that does not nullify that it's not the will of the word because that's what places you in the body when you can receive the communion with the holy ghost and he wants to write his word in you hallelujah because if you can catch it by faith it is thus saith the lord the will of god amen there's nothing stopping it from happening it don't matter if it's a person it doesn't matter if it's an animal it doesn't matter if it's a natural necessity it will be provided because god has shown you you've come to such a holy holy experience that you realize that his word is written in your heart no i said that for a reason it's just like i said last night god wants he said whatever you ask in my name you'll receive it you see how we're living so under privilege you see how something's lacking yes it's whatever is on your heart oh brother can that's way too much that's exactly what the devil wants to tell you as a preacher i always say start right here get that first love cry out for god until you know that you know that you've got the baptism of the holy ghost and then what you cry out for that holy ghost that's in you say god i'm yours live greater depths greater manifestation more of you and me less of me god he must increase i must decrease amen it's what this adoption is doing right so notice and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more now where omission of these these is there's no more offering for sin you see that revelation in there it brings you the revelation your sins are gone that's what the word is writing that word on your heart they've been remitted you know it's like brother bram said he said it's the only one that's putting that stuff on you is the devil that's right now if you ain't never went in you never went in this time go in hallelujah look at it look at the things that god has promised us look at that he wants to establish a word testimony through you he promised to write his laws into their hearts and their minds would he write them now we're going to close 56 hidden life with christ then and there they had the seven gold candlesticks seven prong lamp rather but inside behind the veil there was an ark and that ark in that ark was the tablets the ten commandments as we call them and that represented the human heart that how god promised in the days gone by that in this day that he would write his laws not upon the tables of stone but upon the heart he'd placed the law in the heart ezekiel spoke of it and the prophets all spoke of how that god would do that in the days coming which was a type hallelujah yes don't you see what that is though you see that's where the separation of legalism and grace stand because legalism will get you over here but you can never be happy there you'll still be murmuring you'll still be complaining you'll still want you'll still just feel like you're not there you gotta drop your legalisms grace produces the holy ghost hey what's it called the three works of grace the three works of unmerited favor he gives them to you because by faith you accept them and you stay right there remember brother branham said he said it's not just good enough to accept the blood he said you've got to stay there accepting it until he comes back and responds back he recognizes your repentance he recognizes your baptism he recognizes your need for this holy holy gospel amen and he recognizes it in such a way that what that now you recognize it and that's when it becomes an invincible army and god where we at i believe brother sister we are right here hallelujah and that's why the devil's fighting as hard as he is that's why he's trying to slow us down that's why he's trying to hold it back because if this bride lives this forth that devil ain't going to have nothing to do but but fall like he did in the days of the the disciples the scripture says and jesus said he said i've seen satan fall from heaven as lightning hallelujah don't you realize that this bride is coming to a place that the accuser of the brethren finds no more place in heaven hallelujah the accuser of the brethren is cast out hallelujah right now he's accusing you before god right now he's coming against your testimony you see he can accuse all he wants because there's still a mediating blood in your way amen hallelujah when he accuses you jesus looks at you but alls he sees is the blood amen hallelujah if all he sees is the blood if all's god can see is the blood what should we see amen the blood of jesus christ listen amen so we always say god take me into that holy zolas but what's in there brother sister that's what i'm telling you this gospel is so rich this gospel is so deep that many times what is promised inside of all of it it's mind-boggling the human mind the finite mind cannot comprehend it but who's going to take you in there god's going to take you in there who's going to see that this is finished god is going to see this is finished hallelujah you crying out for the holy ghost you believe you got it amen watch what he does as he begins to complete your life more and more because you will find just like the statue of a perfect man these things are living in your life hallelujah you can't keep track of them hallelujah you can't keep track of nine spiritual gifts come on you can't keep track of the nine fruits of the spirit can you i told that to the church one time i said i can't keep track of all this did you realize god made it so you can't keep track of it you realize god made it so that you wouldn't be able to keep track of how the seraphims live in the presence of god you're gonna be able to focus on all this stuff every single day all day he didn't make it so that you would fully understand it and fully memorize it he made it so you would know it and he made it so that he would be able to live these through you whether you see it or not i realize that there's this presence all over me because we look so carnally hallelujah but sister this stuff happens all the time i thank god one time i seen about brother dave and in our church we had a preacher from africa up there preaching and i was standing in the road back here because i wasn't preaching i looked at the anointing was good i was like no it's hard to believe i was jumping i was excited and i looked and i seen i've seen that same pillar of fire that was above brother branham's head and i seen it and and and brother dave and the preacher lined up in my side i'm like i'm squinting i'm like am i really seeing this and i said god you're gonna have to show me this more lord and so i went like this that's why it's like this and i watch and that pillar of fire wasn't above the preacher it's about brother dave his right shoulder hallelujah hallelujah whether you know it or not the holy ghost is here right now hallelujah i saw the brethren church come the other day he said brother cam he said i i'm not lifting you up as a man he said but i see that light around you when you're preaching i'm looking around i don't see the light what is it what is it it ain't oh glory to god brother cam hallelujah no because whether you know it or not you've got the holy ghost it's with you too i'm just telling you this because i want you to raise your expectation to what is going on you've got to believe these things it's around your pastor it's around you but you've got to feed it in such a way and god will give witness of it he might not do the things that he did with me but he in some way will show you he is with you it's time we move past once again churchianity and we realize that the god that was with israel is here right now amen now as we close the ark of the testimonies in you you're a temple of god how far have you went with him he wants you to have the holy holies experience he wants that to be with you how are you going to do it you guys say god take me in i yield myself god i see what's in there i believe they're forming remember brother branham said until you get in there he said you're going to be on the outside he said you're going to be getting rained on you're going to the sun's going to shine on you're going to be burning and you're going to deal with all the effects of the world around you but when you're in there you're with that light oh hallelujah hallelujah i trust your expectation is through the roof amen this is not brother cam's word this is god's word to you amen this is our word amen all the promises of god are yea and amen in him amen it's your god how am i going to get it you got to learn how to accept god by faith how may i say god put me in that hole he's a holy s lord lord if you promised it for me you might say i feel like i'm so bound by flesh or i i just feel like i i'm not living these things out god lord i feel like i'm fulfilling that quote oh god where where something's lacking god but lord you preached the word to me today and it showed me what i could have there's manna in there there's a proof of election of the priesthood your kings and priests right there and there's a testimony of a word where the word is written on my heart and i'm constrained to the word the complete will and counsel of god for my unique life he longs for your fellowship brother sister today you say god put me in that holies of
