[0:00] this manner therefore pray ye did you
[0:03] notice after this manner now watch
[0:05] carefully and this is a good thing to
[0:07] write down so you can remember this
[0:09] Jesus did not say say these words right
[0:12] right he said after this manner so the
[0:15] Lord's Prayer what we're going to read
[0:17] is a model it's a uh it's a a a um
[0:21] almost a skeleton if you will yes for
[0:24] how we are to pray amen you'll notice
[0:26] the first thing that identifies in
[0:29] prayer is is the who Our Father which
[0:32] are in heaven not just God that's
[0:35] important to understand he's not just
[0:37] addressing God but he's saying our
[0:40] father amen now what this tells us is
[0:43] that in prayer and I'm going to say
[0:45] something really striking now and I want
[0:47] you to really think about this and and
[0:49] if there's a thought on it we'll we'll
[0:50] get into it just a little bit but you've
[0:52] got to understand that a person that is
[0:55] praying that when we talk about the
[0:57] Lord's Prayer not just anybody can pray
[0:59] it right in other words you could say
[1:01] the words but prayer is more than just
[1:04] saying the words prayer is actually
[1:06] entering into an atmosphere where you're
[1:08] talking to God God talking to you the
[1:11] Lord's hearing and you're listening and
[1:13] waiting and so forth so it's more than
[1:15] just uh the Catholic version of Let's
[1:17] just recite the Lord's Prayer if you'll
[1:19] notice this word father the word Father
[1:22] Here excuse me as he's expressed it
[1:25] pardon me you'll notice that it shows a
[1:29] relationship ship between a father and a
[1:32] son all right now write this down
[1:34] there's only one chosen place of worship
[1:38] in the very same token there's only one
[1:40] chosen place of prayer amen and God of
[1:43] course the Lord Jesus will respect Faith
[1:46] he'll respect somebody with faith in
[1:48] their heart but really prayer for prayer
[1:51] to take place it must be accomplished by
[1:54] those that are in this chosen place of
[1:56] worship amen and you look at it in the
[1:58] Old Testament you notice how that when
[2:01] the disciples were speaking about the
[2:03] Tabernacle and they were looking back to
[2:05] them days when the priests would go back
[2:08] into the temple he would enter and God
[2:11] would hear them as long as they were
[2:13] looking from that Temple and at that
[2:15] Temple it was because there was one
[2:17] chosen place that God would hear the
[2:20] worshipper and that was in this chosen
[2:22] Place amen the only other time that God
[2:24] will hear a prayer outside of being born
[2:27] again is if it's in Repentance and cry
[2:30] for mercy and that's God allowing the
[2:32] person to come in now God respects faith
[2:35] God respects prayers he hears all of
[2:37] that but we're talking about something
[2:38] deeper than oh Lord I need a new car and
[2:40] I need a new job and so forth like that
[2:42] people can pray them prayers day and
[2:44] night and there's tens of thousands of
[2:46] them daily that go up before the Lord
[2:48] but what we're talking about is Our
[2:50] Father which art in Heaven the
[2:52] relationship part where God reveals
[2:56] himself in this way of prayer because
[2:58] this is important for you to understand
[3:00] prayer is how God reveals himself to the
[3:03] believer this is how he shows them the
[3:06] secret things of the word the secret
[3:09] things of the Bible this is how he lets
[3:10] them know what he thinks about things is
[3:13] by the way of prayer so in other words
[3:15] people can pray and many people do but
[3:18] for example the Bible said that when a
[3:21] woman with with cut hair or a man with
[3:23] long hair in other words down past his
[3:26] shoulders like a woman the Bible said
[3:28] that it's uncom is unfit for him or her
[3:31] to pray in such a way in other words
[3:33] their prayers don't get through the roof
[3:35] God ain't listening to it he may hear it
[3:37] but he's not going to pay no attention
[3:39] to it or honor it because it's not
[3:41] coming through the chosen place of
[3:42] worship there's many of these prayers
[3:45] that will be ignored because they're not
[3:47] coming in the right uh Avenue of of
[3:50] prayer and the Avenue of worship yes now
[3:52] if you'll notice here Our Father which
[3:54] art in Heaven Our Father showing a
[3:57] relationship between father father and
[4:00] son or God and his and his creation now
[4:03] that's not to say that people I don't
[4:04] want you misunderstand it's not to say
[4:06] that God can't honor Faith he can but
[4:09] only to a point yes only to a place even
[4:12] Jesus said after people were healed and
[4:14] so forth uh be careful and serve the
[4:16] Lord and so because a worst thing will
[4:18] come on you later if you don't continue
[4:19] on so there might be a season in which
[4:22] God may hear this and hear that and
[4:24] honor this and honor that but in order
[4:26] for it to be Matthew 6 that's what I
[4:27] want to drive home as we get started in
[4:29] order for it to be Matthew 6 in this
[4:31] it's got to be our father a relationship
[4:35] between Father and Son now that's a
[4:37] sister too because most time Bible
[4:38] speaks of men not barely talks about the
[4:40] woman but she's included in there too
[4:42] sis don't feel bad about that amen now
[4:45] watch watch when he starts this it's a
[4:47] worship right off the bat the very first
[4:49] thing is Hallowed be thy name so once
[4:52] you identify the who then you can begin
[4:55] worshiping that who all right now l'sen
[4:58] close here's where it gets a little
[4:59] sticky for some people there are there
[5:02] you understand worship and prayer is
[5:05] something that comes together because
[5:07] prayer is your way of being able to show
[5:11] worship to God it's an Avenue of worship
[5:14] toward God not always with our hands
[5:16] raised and uh speaking in unknown
[5:18] languages and shouting and crying but
[5:20] even when we are praying according to
[5:23] the will of God that's a form of worship
[5:25] it's a form of showing God the Gratitude
[5:28] and showing him the honor and showing
[5:30] him the consideration that you respect
[5:32] what he thinks you respect what he feels
[5:35] about certain matters that's the type of
[5:37] worship and you'll notice when we come
[5:39] to him we don't come with the laundry
[5:40] list right hello somebody it's okay to
[5:43] say Amen in Bible study you won't scare
[5:45] me n right it's it's okay and and it's
[5:47] no problem at all to come to the Lord
[5:49] with your issues and troubles and so
[5:51] forth but first it must be a little
[5:54] worship God I thank you I love you I
[5:57] praise you and it's hard for people to
[5:59] do do such a thing number one if you
[6:01] don't know who you're talking about and
[6:03] who you're talking to and second if you
[6:05] don't understand you're a Christian
[6:07] yourself and he is your father well it's
[6:09] going to be hard to go on to these next
[6:10] parts right here you going be awfully
[6:12] confused so it takes an experience with
[6:15] God to bring them in we're going to come
[6:17] in just a moment back to this in
[6:18] Revelation 5 I'm going to tie them
[6:19] together for you by the help of the Lord
[6:22] amen you'll find that many times when
[6:23] I'm dealing with things that I I got one
[6:25] string and one string and one string
[6:27] there'll be 50 of them laying out yonder
[6:29] you'll think where in the world's he
[6:30] going but when we start tying them
[6:32] together you'll see the picture to fall
[6:33] together like a puzzle but we we we'll
[6:35] skip around just a little bit to get it
[6:37] all out now watch first in thy kingdom
[6:40] come in verse 10 thy kingdom come thy
[6:44] will be done in earth as it is in heaven
[6:46] now I want you to think who is the chief
[6:49] focus of this prayer father it's the
[6:53] father almighty God is the focus of this
[6:55] prayer how opposite that is from how we
[6:57] do sometimes right w
[7:00] and Lord I and I think and I need and I
[7:02] feel and this happened but you
[7:04] understand what Jesus is doing here he's
[7:06] teaching us how to focus ourself so that
[7:09] we can get a prayer through this is one
[7:11] reason I'm convinced brother Jesse why a
[7:13] lot of people cannot hear from God when
[7:15] they pray because the focus was wrong
[7:17] when they started beauti and they can't
[7:19] really get their s in the right channel
[7:21] to be able to hear from the Lord because
[7:23] the focus is on them not on the word not
[7:26] on Christ remember this is the who first
[7:28] we're talking about and look it's thy
[7:30] kingdom thy will he said all of these
[7:33] things in two verses and never even
[7:34] mention
[7:35] you you're not even included in the
[7:38] thing in the first place right amen amen
[7:40] that's exactly right now if you'll
[7:42] notice now each prayer and I'm just
[7:44] touching back on Revelation 5 now you'll
[7:46] notice that each prayer that a person
[7:49] prays is actually stored up in a golden
[7:53] vial of odors you'll notice this we'll
[7:55] touch that odors in just a little bit
[7:57] but he said these prayers of these
[7:59] Saints if you look there again
[8:01] Revelation 5'8 the golden vials full of
[8:04] odors now you'll notice that is a is
[8:06] storing up these prayers up in heaven so
[8:09] it's something that if you start praying
[8:11] today and maybe God don't answer right
[8:14] at that moment well it's all right
[8:15] because it's being stored up waiting for
[8:18] the time and the season now why this is
[8:20] important to understand is because if
[8:22] you know that thy will and thy kingdom
[8:25] then when you pray a prayer you're not
[8:27] demanding God to answer it then right
[8:30] yes yes amen did you hear that you're
[8:32] waiting on God to do what needs to be
[8:34] done when he wants to do it so you're
[8:37] not demanding okay God I need a million
[8:39] dollars and I want it in five minutes
[8:40] from now you got five minutes or I'm
[8:42] going to go hit the lottery right that's
[8:44] the attitude of a lot of people when it
[8:45] comes to these spiritual things that's
[8:47] why they don't get nothing from God
[8:49] because they don't know how to approach
[8:50] the who well if he's storing it up then
[8:53] it's up to God then who is the storing
[8:56] and taking the vial and putting it up
[8:58] it's up to him when certain things are
[9:00] going to be fulfilled he told Abraham
[9:02] you're going to have a son 25 years
[9:04] later he fulfilled it well that viol
[9:06] laid out there for about 25 years of
[9:08] prayers and things they prayed oh God
[9:10] fulfill God fulfill God fulfill but 25
[9:13] years later God pulled it off the rack
[9:15] poured it out on Abraham and there come
[9:16] is amen beautiful beautiful maybe it
[9:19] took him that long to get body change
[9:21] power I don't know maybe you had to
[9:22] store it up and get charged up real good
[9:24] like a battery being charged now let's
[9:26] look now Psalm 34: 15 16 and 17 now
[9:31] let's look and see about this who and if
[9:33] the god that we're praying to is really
[9:35] hearing what we're saying that happens
[9:38] to be one of the I don't want to call
[9:40] them complaints but anyhow they're the
[9:41] things that people talk about the most
[9:44] there's a couple things actually one of
[9:45] them being folks just always telling me
[9:47] I just don't know if God loves me the
[9:49] second thing is I don't know if God
[9:51] hears me when I pray well let's just
[9:53] find out what the Bible said about it
[9:54] and let's see exactly who he hears
[9:57] Remember The Who and if he's listening
[10:00] all right now watch now this is going to
[10:01] really open some things up to you the
[10:04] eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous
[10:07] and his ears are open unto their cry now
[10:11] watch the face of the Lord is against
[10:14] them that do evil to cut off the
[10:16] remembrance of them from the earth here
[10:20] he comes back again the righteous cry
[10:22] and the Lord Hearth you know he keeps
[10:24] saying righteous righteous righteous you
[10:28] understand that being in the chosen
[10:30] place of worship the ones God is is
[10:33] paying attention to is the righteous the
[10:36] rest of them he'll hear them if they
[10:38] repent he'll hear them if they ask for
[10:40] forgiveness he'll hear them if they ask
[10:42] for Mercy he might Grant little minor
[10:44] things that Faith May accomplish for a
[10:47] season but God is only listening to
[10:51] those that are of the righteous those
[10:52] that are in the chosen place of worship
[10:55] you couldn't have been an Israelite and
[10:56] say all right now I'm going to go talk
[10:58] to the Lord and walk over and build up a
[10:59] Grove in the corner and your own t and
[11:01] so I'm going to pray over here hears me
[11:02] just as good here no no no one chosen
[11:06] place that God heard him in that's the
[11:08] only place God heard him in matter of
[11:09] fact when Jonah is in the belly of the
[11:11] whale he said I'll turn myself toward
[11:13] the Holy Temple why because that's where
[11:15] God heard the prayers of the righteous
[11:17] folks you watch this is the reason why
[11:20] people saying oh you know I prayed for
[11:22] this and I prayed for that and it didn't
[11:25] happen well my question is the who are
[11:27] you the righteous amen cuz if you're not
[11:30] the righteous God has no obligation to
[11:32] your prayers amen yes that's a stiff one
[11:35] you got to absolutely swallow it down
[11:37] now that's a chunk of Eagle meat right
[11:39] there exactly right the eyes of the Lord
[11:42] are upon the righteous his ears are open
[11:44] to their cries not everybody's cries God
[11:48] will hear anybody but you've got to come
[11:50] God's way remember friends I've said
[11:52] this over and over again right here at
[11:53] this little church in different parts of
[11:54] the country God is not at letting us
[11:57] pick our own way and we'll f figure it
[11:59] out ourselves we've got to come God's
[12:01] way amen that's on everything that's on
[12:04] salvation that's on raising our families
[12:07] that's on uh money that's on anything
[12:09] that God lays before us and that's on
[12:12] prayer prayer is exact we got to come
[12:14] God's way yes we can't pray any way we
[12:16] want to well Lord you said uh you know
[12:19] ask for others then ask for myself but
[12:21] I'm more important I'll ask for me first
[12:23] and then worry about the others well you
[12:25] you ain't going to get nowhere you've
[12:26] got to go God's way in order to get it
[12:28] right remember there is a law that is
[12:31] associated with everything in this life
[12:34] there's a law with it okay I'll give you
[12:36] an example this is matter there's a law
[12:39] associated with this matter it's a solid
[12:41] it's hard it cannot be liquid it cannot
[12:44] be gas because the law that's associated
[12:46] with this wood makes it solid matter
[12:49] like that the atoms and everything in it
[12:51] makes it like that the law associated
[12:53] with that light I can scream at it all I
[12:56] want to but unless I go flip the switch
[12:57] on it ain't going to come on I can step
[13:00] and say well I'm going to do it my way
[13:01] light bul you light up I'm the boss
[13:03] around here that light will laugh right
[13:05] back at you if it could talk and say no
[13:07] my boss is back here on the wall and
[13:09] that's the one that flips the switch on
[13:11] prayer is the exact same way a bird has
[13:14] a law it's the law of flight a fish has
[13:16] a law to swim underneath the ocean but
[13:19] prayer comes by a law as well David's
[13:22] telling us what that law is you must be
[13:24] of the righteous you got to be a
[13:26] righteous person see and his ears are
[13:29] open to their cry look at verse 16 but
[13:31] the face of the Lord is against them to
[13:33] do evil so is he listening if they
[13:35] refuse Grace and righteousness and mercy
[13:38] and love and Holiness and all that and
[13:40] they reject all of that then when they
[13:42] get in trouble oh God help me well it
[13:44] depends on whether or not they really
[13:45] mean business with God or not that's
[13:47] right amen if they just want him to get
[13:48] him out of trouble like an Aaron boy
[13:50] running an Aaron or something like that
[13:52] they ain't never going to get nowhere
[13:53] God may help him along trying to get
[13:55] them somewhere but we're talking about
[13:58] prayer y' want to Le about prayer right
[14:00] you want to this what it's about now
[14:02] Psalm
[14:03] 55:17 all right now watch he's talking
[14:06] again about a righteous person all right
[14:08] get ready to turn fast cuz I'm going to
[14:10] teach it fast all right Psalm
[14:12] 55:17 evening morning and at noon he
[14:16] shall hear my voice I think this is a
[14:19] good pattern for how that David would
[14:21] pray he prayed of an evening he prayed
[14:24] of a morning he prayed at noon so
[14:26] morning noon and night he had at least
[14:29] two or three spots in the day the where
[14:31] that he set aside to talk to the Lord
[14:34] now what this tells us is not that when
[14:36] we pray that we need to have you know a
[14:38] certain block of time and a certain
[14:40] block of time and a certain block of
[14:42] time for example brother Jesse being a
[14:43] school teacher it'd be hard for him in
[14:45] the afternoon uh trying to eat lunch and
[14:48] deal with kitties and so forth like that
[14:50] and then run over and have two-hour
[14:51] prayer meet it's almost impossible but
[14:54] what David is showing here is the
[14:56] importance of letting everything be
[14:59] secondary to your prayer life he's
[15:01] showing us how that we need to set aside
[15:04] time to talk to the Lord to make it an
[15:06] important part of our day because
[15:09] without prayer in our lives we'll never
[15:12] understand the true mysteries of God we
[15:14] won to understand the mysteries of
[15:15] oursel we won't understand the mysteries
[15:17] of the world of the word and all these
[15:19] other great things we'll never
[15:21] understand anything spiritual without
[15:23] this Avenue of prayer so David Shawn set
[15:26] aside some time his time was evening
[15:28] morning and noon now that that brings up
[15:31] something I'm want to hit right quickly
[15:32] cuz I uh the faster I teach looks like
[15:34] the faster the clock preaches H but when
[15:37] you get into the thing and you start
[15:38] looking at what people talk about prayer
[15:41] a lot of times folks get in their mind
[15:43] well to be really spiritual praying
[15:45] you've got to spend three hours laying
[15:46] out before the Lord well but there's
[15:49] nothing in the Bible that says yes the
[15:52] length of time whether it's long whether
[15:54] it's short whether it's medium every
[15:55] what it is there's nothing that
[15:57] designates even the direction of how a
[16:00] person supposed to I'm talking about
[16:01] physically the way they're supposed to
[16:03] pray Jesus did say I would that men
[16:06] would stand everywhere with their holy
[16:07] hands other places they knelt other
[16:10] places they prostrated thems on the
[16:12] ground but I I like what one of the
[16:14] commentary said here and I'll read this
[16:16] to you uh just just how he says it I
[16:19] think it's wonderful it's not he says
[16:21] the position of the body in prayer as
[16:24] much as it is the attitude of the one
[16:26] praying amen I think that's I think is a
[16:29] good way to say it so in this who of
[16:31] what we're talking about this who being
[16:33] you and this who being me then we must
[16:36] understand that it is the attitude of
[16:39] that person when they're praying brother
[16:41] RM said five minutes in the presence of
[16:43] God Moses knew more about God than all
[16:46] of the 40 years his mom tried to teach
[16:48] you so 5 minutes in the presence of the
[16:50] Lord could do a better thing sometimes
[16:52] than 40 hours of praying maybe we'd say
[16:54] it that way but not to say that a person
[16:56] shouldn't pray 40 hours but to be
[16:59] spiritual don't mean you have to pray 4
[17:01] hours a day and 6 hours a day and things
[17:03] like that you take working men on their
[17:05] job and they 6070 hours a week they want
[17:08] to spend time with their families they
[17:09] want to come to church they got so many
[17:11] they got a cut the lawn they got all
[17:12] these other responsibilities well the
[17:14] Lord may show a season of Grace to men
[17:17] like that and they may have 20 minutes
[17:20] that they stand before the Lord in the
[17:21] morning they may have 30 minutes at
[17:23] night before they go to bed and let me
[17:25] tell you something little as much when
[17:26] God's in it amen amen little as much
[17:28] when God's in it God can take that 40 45
[17:31] minutes in the day and he can make it
[17:33] more powerful than somebody laying on
[17:35] their face for 3 hours because a lot of
[17:37] times it's more ritual that people
[17:40] practice than it is the attitude of why
[17:42] they're doing it and let's look at it
[17:45] this way if a man prays 40 minutes today
[17:47] 40 minutes tomorrow 40 minutes the next
[17:49] day 40 minutes in a week's time just
[17:52] take 40 times seven how many minutes has
[17:54] he prayed look how many hours he's got
[17:55] in in the week's time not to mention the
[17:57] time in church not to mention all that
[17:59] so in the week he's got a couple hours
[18:01] or so with the Lord that he's put in and
[18:03] that's wonderful that's what a man wants
[18:06] and God can deal with him just in the
[18:08] right way all right Psalm
[18:10] 56:9 all right now watch what David said
[18:13] when I cry unto thee then shall my
[18:16] enemies turn back he said this I know
[18:18] for God is for me amen this is something
[18:23] that the Lord revealed to David in
[18:24] prayer I'm going to say the 21st century
[18:26] version God if you're righteous has got
[18:29] your back amen yes yes huh God has got
[18:34] your back the bottom line is he said
[18:37] when I cry or when I would pray when I
[18:40] would pray or cry unto the Lord
[18:42] hallelujah my enemies were turned back
[18:45] God is for me or he's got my back how
[18:48] did he know he've been talking to him
[18:49] and he knows what the Lord felt about
[18:51] him Psalm 57 verse two I will cry unto
[18:55] God most high now watch he's praying now
[18:57] unto God that per forth all things for
[19:00] me so who who is it he's talking to I
[19:03] will pray I will cry I will talk to the
[19:06] Lord God most high Psalm 86 verse3
[19:11] chapter
[19:12] 86:3 be merciful unto me oh Lord here we
[19:15] go for I cry unto thee daily yes amen
[19:19] you understand it's important to have
[19:20] this daily walk with God you must have
[19:23] this daily walk with God you say why
[19:25] you're storing prayers that's right yes
[19:27] you're storing up prayers you're storing
[19:29] up blessings you're storing up great
[19:31] things of God for your life all right
[19:33] Psalm 88: 2 let my prayer come before
[19:37] thee and incline thine ear unto my cry
[19:40] now this is a wonderful thing if you'll
[19:42] study this for just a moment look at
[19:43] what he said he said let my prayer come
[19:47] before thee so it's almost as if the
[19:49] words of the man's prayer is coming
[19:52] before the Lord Jesus like we would take
[19:54] our cell phone and see a text message
[19:56] come before us our prayer is coming
[19:59] before the Lord right and let me tell
[20:02] you something God the Lord Jesus checks
[20:04] his text
[20:05] messages right right you never see him
[20:08] missing one of them amen amen that's
[20:10] exactly right he checks it cuz he says
[20:13] let my prayer come before thee just like
[20:15] a prophet would see a vision out in
[20:17] front of him it would come before his
[20:18] eyes very same thing here let my prayer
[20:22] come before thee all right what's your
[20:24] name buddy I'm Austin Austin nice to
[20:26] meet you read for me Matthew 13 verse
[20:30] 15-16 I'm not going to ask you all if
[20:32] you want to read I'm just going to make
[20:33] you do it about that all right Matthew
[20:36] 13 15 and 16 all right and sir what's
[20:39] your name again buddy Benjamin Ben
[20:41] you're a Benjamin hey good good people
[20:43] are Benjamin I know that I'm a Benjamin
[20:45] all right you get me 2 Timothy 4 3 and 4
[20:49] then brother uh Jess Jesse get me James
[20:51] 5 and four let's catch these three
[20:54] verses right together all right you
[20:56] ready you said uh Matthew 13:15 that's
[20:59] exact 15 16
[21:00] right for this people's heart is wax
[21:03] gross and their ears are dull of hearing
[21:06] and their eyes they have have closed
[21:08] lest at any time they should see with
[21:10] their eyes and hear with their ears and
[21:13] should understand with their heart and
[21:14] should be converted and I should heal
[21:17] them but blessed are your eyes for they
[21:19] see and your ears for they hear all
[21:21] right now this is an important thing
[21:23] because if you'll notice one of them is
[21:26] blind and deaf and can't hear see wow
[21:30] and the other one can hear and see well
[21:32] this is important in prayer because if
[21:34] God's going to talk to a man he's got to
[21:36] be able to hear him and he's got to be
[21:38] able to see him amen so part of this who
[21:41] is those that have the ability to hear
[21:44] and see beautiful they're blinding they
[21:46] can't see nothing God could talk to them
[21:48] all day long and they wouldn't get
[21:49] nothing if I had a somebody sitting here
[21:51] on the altar blind and deaf well I could
[21:54] stand back here and make faces out of
[21:56] and be silly and so they never even know
[21:58] what I was doing I could uh I could ring
[22:01] out and say all right I'm going to give
[22:02] you a million dollars well they wouldn't
[22:04] even know that I had the check in my
[22:05] hand because they're blind and deaf
[22:07] that's the way it is in prayer many of
[22:09] these people that are saying oh I pray
[22:13] Beyonce bless her heart and these people
[22:15] that their Grammy Awards and Country
[22:17] Awards and you know I want to thank the
[22:18] Lord Jesus my personal savior standing
[22:20] in a pair of booty shorts and all such
[22:22] nonsense that they can say that all they
[22:24] want to but the Bible said they're blind
[22:26] and deaf amen amen they can't hear the
[22:28] word word they can't hear what's true
[22:30] but he said blessed are your eyes and
[22:32] your ears for they hear they hear and
[22:35] they see well what are you listening for
[22:38] and when does God talk he talks when
[22:40] you're praying when you're studying the
[22:41] word in the things of God all right pick
[22:44] that up second Timothy did you have
[22:46] Benjamin had that yes yes sir all right
[22:47] 2 Timothy 4 3 and four if you would all
[22:50] right now watch this brings us in about
[22:51] these ears again for the time will come
[22:54] when they will not endure sound Doctrine
[22:56] but after their own lust they after
[22:58] their own lust shall they heat to
[23:01] themselves teachers having itching ears
[23:04] and they shall turn away their ears from
[23:06] the truth and shall be turned unto fa
[23:08] now did you notice this they turn their
[23:10] own ears away yes wow it's not that God
[23:13] turns them they turn their own ears away
[23:16] beautiful you're right right so how can
[23:18] they hear if they're not willing to
[23:20] listen amen amen this is prayer we're
[23:22] talking about the who all right are
[23:25] these who's going to be able to hear
[23:26] hear anything from God absolutely not
[23:29] the rain can fall on them and listen to
[23:31] me they can shout perform miracles do
[23:33] all kinds of things but to be the
[23:36] righteous you got to be able to hear
[23:38] what the spirit is saying under the
[23:39] churches these people turn their ears
[23:42] from the truth well what do they do they
[23:44] turn their ears toward itching things
[23:46] smooth things tell us nice stuff and
[23:49] don't preach on us and don't make us
[23:50] feel bad and convicted and feel like
[23:52] we're Sinners oh you know it be a shame
[23:54] if we had to repent and get the Holy
[23:55] Ghost you know that just be terrible in
[23:56] a church imagine that but you understand
[23:59] they have itching ears they turn their
[24:01] own ears away from the truth so when
[24:03] they're praying they might be doing all
[24:06] the talking but they can't hear what
[24:08] God's saying amen right amen yes that
[24:11] this explains some things to you because
[24:13] you think to yourself well what about
[24:14] Mother Teresa and the pope and these
[24:16] guys spend these nuns spend 14 hours
[24:19] praying well who's doing all the talking
[24:21] that's exactly because according to the
[24:23] Bible right here if they've turned their
[24:25] ears away from truth God could speak
[24:27] right to them and they're doing all the
[24:29] Talking they ain't hearing nothing
[24:30] that's right right they're not hearing
[24:32] not one thing just because uh for
[24:34] example many years ago I was in um
[24:36] Oklahoma and one of the brothers there
[24:38] took us to u to The Prayer Tower and
[24:40] brother Jesse when them doors opened up
[24:42] you could feel the atmosphere of prayer
[24:44] and that stumbled me a little bit I
[24:46] thought well I don't understand that how
[24:48] could you feel such a Godly atmosphere
[24:50] like that and then the Lord spoke to my
[24:52] heart who's doing all the Talking wow I
[24:55] thought who's listening who's the one
[24:57] really hearing but ain't it ain't some
[24:59] of them folks sitting there disobeying
[25:01] the word that's right brother right and
[25:03] get caught up and do a lot of praying
[25:04] but the who said you've got to be in the
[25:07] chosen place of worship in order to have
[25:10] ears to hear that's right you got to
[25:12] have the Holy Ghost amen again unless
[25:14] they're repenting unless they're making
[25:16] their heart right and being obedient to
[25:17] the word in some way repent be baptized
[25:19] Jesus name or something on that order it
[25:21] doesn't matter if they got an ear to
[25:23] hear or not the Bible said they turn
[25:25] their ear away right they might at one
[25:27] time have an ear to hear here remember
[25:29] Cain had a full length conversation with
[25:31] god that's right brother right remember
[25:33] Genesis 4 God came down and talked to
[25:35] him and he talk right back to God you'll
[25:37] never find another scripture after that
[25:39] where Cain ever had another conversation
[25:41] that's right why he turned his ears away
[25:43] from God he wasn't willing to hear what
[25:45] was being said all right but Jesse get
[25:47] us James 5:4 now and let's pull out that
[25:50] fourth verse behold the hire of the
[25:52] laborers who have reaped down your
[25:54] fields which is of you kept back by
[25:56] fraud crith and the cries of them which
[25:59] have reaped are entered into the ears of
[26:02] the Lord of Sabbath okay now you'll
[26:04] notice now this is a different side of
[26:07] this coin so to speak of what we just
[26:08] read now those that have been wrong
[26:12] those have been despitefully used those
[26:13] have been persecuted what more now
[26:16] notice he said the Cry came into the
[26:19] ears of him who is the lord of the sa
[26:22] now you understand God can hear you yes
[26:26] and he always hears us yes but it
[26:28] depends whether he's going to listen or
[26:29] not amen yeah right right there a big
[26:32] difference amen you can hear something
[26:33] but not listen to it amen right and my
[26:36] daddy used to tell me all the time don't
[26:37] you don't you don't you don't you don't
[26:38] you I'd hear him but I never
[26:40] listen right brother right tell by some
[26:42] of y'all y'all know what I'm talking
[26:43] about back through here that's exactly
[26:45] right so his ears were listening and and
[26:49] heard all right Sam why don't you pull
[26:51] up First Peter chapter 3 verse 12 all
[26:54] right let's pull in another little thing
[26:57] uh we're going to go back to the Old
[26:58] Testament just a moment and uh our
[27:00] little birthday buddy back here you get
[27:02] judges chap 2: 18 if you will you mind
[27:05] reading out loud you can hand against oh
[27:07] yeah you tough all right 1 Peter 3 verse
[27:10] 12
[27:13] Samantha you got
[27:15] it almost almost there all right now all
[27:20] right there we go first Peter 312 go
[27:21] ahead kid for the eyes of the Lord are
[27:23] over the righteous and his ears are open
[27:25] unto their prayers the Lord is against
[27:29] them that do evil are there ears on your
[27:31] face your ears are part of your face
[27:33] your face part of your ears I've never
[27:35] seen a face without ears next to it
[27:37] right right his face is against them
[27:40] beautiful he's turned his ear away he's
[27:42] not listening unless they're willing to
[27:45] be what look at what he said his eyes
[27:47] are over the righteous you got to be in
[27:51] a chosen place that's right excuse the
[27:54] sisters I don't mean this against you
[27:55] Godly women but some woman stand there
[27:58] would cut off hair oh I talk to the Lord
[28:00] every day you might do it but he ain't
[28:01] listening that's right amen amen that's
[28:04] Bible absolutely not unless she's
[28:05] willing to come down here and say God
[28:07] I'm sorry that I've cut my glory off
[28:09] like this all these years and then Jesus
[28:11] will listen right amen amen amen on the
[28:13] other side of it you take a man long
[28:15] hair hanging down his back when I I
[28:17] think I told y all this before when I
[28:18] was in Jamaica the rust aarian you know
[28:20] the men all them dreadlocks hanging way
[28:22] on down the back of their head I said
[28:24] it's just as perverted as a woman with
[28:25] short hair that's right just as sinful
[28:28] just is wrong that's right God ain't
[28:29] hearing them neither oh but I talk to
[28:31] God you may talk to him but according to
[28:34] this Bible right here he listens when
[28:36] the righteous cry not when everybody
[28:38] else do amen amen oh that's a serious
[28:41] thing people don't look at it in this
[28:42] way because they think God just listens
[28:44] and accepts any old thing that's the
[28:46] reason the church accepts any old thing
[28:47] CU they think God does that's right
[28:49] right brother right are but leave
[28:51] different go God don't want you to come
[28:52] in his yard and leave the same way he
[28:54] want you to come in and leave different

[29:28] that boy is a good reader he may have a
[29:30] school teacher for a daddy I think maybe
[29:32] all right now you watch now and look
[29:34] that repented the Lord because of their
[29:36] grow now here's what we've been talking
[29:37] about the last 20 minutes now if you'll
[29:40] notice the Lord raised them up judges
[29:43] watch he repented it repented the Lord
[29:47] because of their groanings God saw the
[29:51] desire of the people to be
[29:54] right and so God said all right in other
[29:56] words when he's saying it rep repented
[29:58] the Lord God took a step back and said
[30:00] all right I see the sincerity of your
[30:02] heart I'm going to listen to you now
[30:05] right right that's what it means and
[30:06] that that shows it can change people can
[30:10] change this thing all right feeling that

[30:14] us heavenly father as we're looking at
[30:16] the word of God now Lord Jesus and we've
[30:18] been standing here for a few minutes now

[30:24] come down in this place now and take
[30:25] your word settle our minds settle our
[30:27] hearts Lord and let these things start
[30:29] taking real deep beding ground in us now

[30:33] service and out of your hands and we
[30:35] just thank you for it Lord Jesus SN on
[30:37] the atmosphere has been set now we ask
[30:39] it in Jesus name amen amen amen praise
[30:42] the Lord all right because of their
[30:44] groanings watch when the Lord raised
[30:46] them up judges see the Lord was with
[30:50] that judge it repented the Lord watch
[30:53] this hit it again because of their
[30:55] groanings
[30:58] God saw these people was in a miserable
[31:01] condition and had no way out right and
[31:04] because they could not helps they
[31:06] groaned unto the Lord Cried Out unto the
[31:08] Lord and God said all right I'll have
[31:11] pity on you right right that you this
[31:14] right here proves to you God ain't
[31:15] coming our
[31:16] way he comes his own way MH right amen
[31:20] amen that's exactly right yes I know it
[31:22] stings a little bit but it's got to the
[31:24] B don't make you a little sick it ain't
[31:25] going to do you no good that's right see
[31:27] watch now let's go go Matthew 6:6 you
[31:29] want to read do you mind reading no you
[31:33] you pass all right well I I got I got
[31:34] some of my study home do that that's all
[31:36] right Matthew 6 I've got a sister that
[31:39] she loves Three Musketeers and and if
[31:40] I'd give her Three Musketeers she might
[31:42] read but I'm fresh out tonight and then
[31:44] see Matthew 6 and 6 all right just catch
[31:47] it again uh Austin if you will read this
[31:50] for us but thou when thou pray us now
[31:52] watch what Jesus said about this we're
[31:54] still looking at the who for just a
[31:55] little bit we're going to catch at what
[31:57] in just a little bit
[32:00] amen Matthew 6 yes sir oh Matthew
[32:06] 6 yeah they've got it up there too I was
[32:08] looking to see them catch it that's you
[32:10] can read from your Bible up there
[32:11] whichever one you want but thou when
[32:14] thou thou prayest enter into thy closet
[32:16] and when thou has shut thy door pray to
[32:18] thy father which is in secret and thy
[32:20] father seeth in secret shall reward thee
[32:22] openly now that's the who yes you go
[32:25] into the closet you're talking to him he
[32:27] talks to you you shut thy door and pray
[32:30] to thy father and that which is done in
[32:33] secret that which is done in secret is
[32:36] then rewarded open now this tells us
[32:38] that prayer is not really designed to be
[32:42] something that takes place in a large
[32:45] crowd of people now we can do that
[32:47] that's fine but this type of prayer this
[32:50] type of secret prayer shows a private
[32:54] relationship between you and Almighty
[32:58] God our Father which are in heaven
[33:00] father and son and let us know uh that
[33:03] God wants it to be a private thing all
[33:06] right I'm going to read you a little
[33:06] quotation out of the message called what
[33:08] is a vision all right I just want to
[33:10] read this to you because I think it fits
[33:12] with what he said he sees this little
[33:14] room in a in a in a tent and this tent
[33:16] sitting up here in a little room off to
[33:18] the side he said the Holy Spirit the
[33:20] pillar of fire whiping blazing went over
[33:23] the audience and stood over top that
[33:24] little building he settled down on it
[33:26] and when I was standing there the same
[33:27] voice that Angel's voice said I'll meet
[33:29] you there that's the third pool nobody
[33:31] will know nothing about it I said I
[33:32] don't understand why there will it not
[33:34] be a public show I don't understand
[33:36] going into the closet like that he said
[33:39] is it not written by our Lord when thou
[33:41] prayest be not like the Hypocrites heard
[33:43] before men but enter to the secret
[33:45] closet and pray and then it's perfectly
[33:48] scripture every time he said he said
[33:50] then he understood it so then it is this
[33:52] private meeting place now uh another
[33:55] spot here at my house the prayer room is
[33:58] the bedroom secret place meeting place
[34:01] alone isolated with God so a man could
[34:04] go right into his bedroom shut the door
[34:06] behind him walk into a closet everywhere
[34:08] every what the secret part is he can get
[34:11] along with God and then the Lord will
[34:12] meet him in that quietness and that that
[34:15] Solitude which means that you can't say
[34:18] now Heavenly Father Hallowed be thy name
[34:20] hold on a second let me answer this text
[34:22] message right brother right right
[34:25] Hallowed be thy name but let me answer
[34:26] this Facebook post first thing get done
[34:29] with this Twitter then we'll start
[34:30] talking well that's not the idea the
[34:32] idea is you've got to be focused on The
[34:35] Who that you're talking to so the reason
[34:38] it is secret the reason it is private is
[34:40] because God oh I just love to say this
[34:43] he wants your full undivided attention
[34:45] amen amen you say why cuz he wants to
[34:48] talk to you that's why amen he wants to
[34:50] share things with you he wants to hear
[34:52] from you what's in your heart and he
[34:55] wants to tell you what's in his for the
[34:56] day too amen amen a wonderful thing if
[34:59] you look at it right that's the reason
[35:01] it's secret brother sister because he
[35:03] wants us to be able to go into it that
[35:05] way all right now we're not going to
[35:06] turn but you write it down Mark 12 38
[35:10] 3940 Mark 12 38 3940 38 3940 of the 12th
[35:15] chapter of The Book of Mark all right
[35:18] Jesus said Beware of the scribes who go
[35:21] in Long clothing they love salutations
[35:24] in the marketplace well hello Dr so and
[35:26] so and Reverend so and so they love
[35:27] those things and then he said they make
[35:31] pretense long prayers yes long prayers
[35:35] now this is an interesting thing I want
[35:36] to read you out of a place called
[35:38] Johnson's notes this is Johnson's notes
[35:40] of the New Testament it's a little
[35:41] commentary and I I like how he uses this
[35:44] he picks up Mark 12 and pulls out Beware
[35:46] of the scribes and he tells us like this
[35:48] now just listen to this way he puts this
[35:50] I thought this was interesting he said
[35:53] long flowing robes reaching to the feet
[35:55] similar to those worn by the romanish
[35:57] priest
[35:58] were warn by the scribes as professional
[36:00] attire in order to attract attention
[36:04] when Christ said his Apostles out to
[36:06] preach he told them in Mark 6:9 and
[36:09] Matthew 10:10 is this being recorded yes
[36:12] is it that well that's wonderful I I'm
[36:14] going to put them scriptures in I I just
[36:17] most time I would take maybe keep
[36:19] repeating there's a lot of I got to say
[36:20] so if it's recorded you can go back and
[36:21] catch it all right the scribes ancient
[36:24] Modern Love display they loved showing
[36:27] themselves off in places of concourse
[36:30] they loved honor and respect father
[36:34] Master Rabbi teacher and so forth they
[36:37] often possess a desire to magnify their
[36:40] office and the truth they want to
[36:42] magnify themselves they love robes that
[36:44] ever adverti to everyone they were
[36:47] separate from the rest of the people
[36:49] right right now you notice Jesus said
[36:51] don't go out there making a public show
[36:54] like that in other words when a man or
[36:57] woman
[36:58] is truly living where they should before
[37:00] the Lord they don't try to attract
[37:02] attention upon themselves right now you
[37:04] say well what does this have to do with
[37:06] prayer everything remember the focus of
[37:09] your prayer the who thy kingdom come thy
[37:13] will be done so if the prayer is
[37:16] focusing upon God and that prayer is a
[37:19] part of your life then your life will
[37:21] reflect your focus in prayer amen if
[37:24] your prayer is about you when you go out
[37:27] from prayer you'll be about you right
[37:29] absolutely right brother you understand
[37:31] it yes sir if the prayer is about God
[37:33] when you go out it'll be about God GL
[37:36] the Lord somebody whatever you are in
[37:38] that prayer closet is what you're going
[37:40] to be out before men yes sir CU that's
[37:42] the way they prayed long prayers well
[37:45] their long prayer match their long
[37:47] robe you understand their attitude was
[37:51] we're something we're better than
[37:52] everybody else glory to God and this and
[37:54] that so they prayed in a way that
[37:56] reflect what they thought about thems
[37:59] this is why when we go to the presence
[38:02] of the Lord we make the focus about God
[38:05] because the prayer is not about us it's
[38:08] about him right oh I just I wish we had
[38:12] 50 of them Manchester people sitting
[38:14] here right now we' done been crying and
[38:15] squalling about this time I know they
[38:17] would have oh I just miss him so bad
[38:19] when I get in these things like this yes
[38:21] sir boy we had some wonderful times I
[38:22] was thinking on this very study right
[38:24] here I I think that very night if you
[38:26] remember Samantha that's the Lord Jesus
[38:28] came in the building night at the end of
[38:30] the thing Lord we cried and squalled and
[38:32] worship for 40 minutes after the thing
[38:34] was over oh just wonderful I just love
[38:36] his word I just pray he does that right
[38:38] here tonight just moves right in this
[38:40] place and gives us such a powerful
[38:42] visitation of his presence that it does
[38:44] something that leaves something with us
[38:45] that just oh my just change our hearts
[38:48] Hallelujah watch now in St John 11: 17
[38:52] the words are then Jesus came all right
[38:55] now that might be a short text but it's
[38:57] the value of the text that a person
[39:00] would preach and the prophet said like
[39:02] this sometimes we place value on Long
[39:05] prayers much draw out time and sometimes
[39:09] that's not right he said I had a friend
[39:11] of mine not long ago was searching
[39:12] upstairs in his uh in his attic and he
[39:15] had a trunk a little posted stamp about
[39:17] 1/2 in square this old posted stamp he
[39:20] thought well that's an old stamp he gave
[39:22] it to a kid and the boy went out there
[39:23] and got an ice cream in his mind so or
[39:26] had had an ice cream in his mind so he
[39:27] run down to the stamp collector and sold
[39:30] it to the stamp collector and he got
[39:31] enough money to get an ice cream the
[39:33] stamp collector saw the value out of it
[39:35] he made a million dollars not not the
[39:38] size of the thing but is the value now I
[39:41] want you to pay attention yes don't
[39:42] don't miss this there are postage stamp
[39:45] prayers and sometimes postage stamp
[39:48] prayers are necessary needful and
[39:50] beneficial and then there are long
[39:53] prayers that are even greater than that
[39:56] even greater than that sometimes you
[39:57] have posted stamp prayers little quick
[40:00] things in the morning some emergency
[40:02] come up and you say oh Jesus I'm asking
[40:04] you to help me this morning be with me
[40:05] that's a posted stamp prayer right if
[40:07] the value is in it and you got the value
[40:10] of what you're trying to accomplish
[40:11] meaning that you're being sincere before
[40:13] God Lord this is all the time I can give
[40:15] you I'm giving you this much time that
[40:17] postage St prayer well it don't mail the
[40:19] letter that's right yeah it'll me the
[40:22] letter sure will but sometimes we can't
[40:25] let make everything a post to S prayer
[40:27] now it's got to be sometimes in
[40:29] emergency situations you look at the
[40:31] value of what you're trying to
[40:33] accomplish more than the minutes the
[40:36] quantity of what you're trying to
[40:37] accomplish okay now in in church order
[40:40] we're taught this that when we're in
[40:43] public like this praying you ask a GU to
[40:46] offer a word of prayer and he say he'll
[40:47] pray for the mayor of the city the
[40:48] governor of the state the president of
[40:49] the Union the pastors and everybody
[40:51] around each one by number sister Jones
[40:53] in the hospital and like that walking up
[40:55] down the streets he said they'll start
[40:56] that he said and if they're dragging it
[40:59] out he said it's too much time see it
[41:02] causes people to lose interest in what's
[41:04] being said and what's being accomplished
[41:07] so this is where for example a posted
[41:09] stamp prayer would be beneficial so when
[41:11] you got the people gathered together in
[41:12] a church service like that and you say
[41:14] brother Austin come up here and lead us
[41:16] in a word of prayer well then you get up
[41:18] here heavenly father in the name of
[41:20] Jesus Christ and a few minutes it's over
[41:22] with the people are shouting and crying
[41:24] and moving on into the service but then
[41:26] if you break the flow of it and enter
[41:28] into a long prayer and everybody and
[41:30] their brothers prayed for Humpty Dumpty
[41:32] All the King's Men And even the king's
[41:34] horses and they still ain't got him put
[41:36] back together 40 minutes later
[41:38] everybody's sitting there as they say
[41:40] with their arms folded and they're ready
[41:41] to go home it's then killed the service
[41:43] posted stamp prayer it's the value of
[41:46] what's trying to be accomplished you
[41:48] understand amen all right now let's look
[41:50] now again at Revelation 58 the Saints
[41:53] and these prayers in these vials all
[41:57] right Psalm
[41:59] 56:8 now let's pull this one up and I I
[42:02] want to show you something here that the
[42:03] Bible said about God storing up these
[42:07] prayers and I want to just show you that
[42:08] this is scripture what we're talking
[42:10] about yes I'm just going to give you
[42:11] just one verse here and you just going
[42:13] to have to be satisfied with that
[42:14] there's a whole lot more but we ain't
[42:15] got enough time to get it all right
[42:17] Psalm
[42:18] 56:8 now watch here all right brother
[42:21] Benjamin if you will read this for us
[42:22] Psalm 568 if you got it in your Bible or
[42:24] up here whichever one you want thou
[42:26] tellest my wonderings put thou my tears
[42:30] into thy bottle and they are they not in
[42:33] thy book all right now watch his tears
[42:35] are part of his
[42:36] praying where did his tears come from
[42:39] talking to the Lord where' God put him
[42:42] he put him in a
[42:43] bottle what's he doing with them storing
[42:46] them up beautiful beautiful every prayer
[42:48] every tear every whatever it may be God
[42:51] storing them up do you understand
[42:52] there's not a tear you've ever cried
[42:54] that God don't already have it stored up
[42:56] amen amen glory he already got it stored
[43:00] up and it's even got it wrote in a book
[43:03] Glory Glory people say well I didn't
[43:05] hear God say nothing well maybe because
[43:07] he was busy
[43:09] writing right Hallelujah somebody maybe
[43:13] he was busy right maybe he couldn't
[43:14] answer right at that moment cuz he was
[43:16] busy doing all this hey you telling me
[43:18] all your problems I'm going to be
[43:20] storing them up in a bottle I'm going to
[43:22] be writing them down in a book I can't
[43:23] do two things at
[43:25] once amen amen
[43:27] all my that ought to straighten a few
[43:29] things out anyhow yes yes see now watch
[43:31] Hebrews 4 verse1 15 let's go to a New
[43:34] Testament example on this and pull it in
[43:36] all right if you will brother Jesse you
[43:38] read this whenever we get it up here uh
[43:40] Hebrews 4:15 or if you get it in your
[43:42] book there that'd be fine too all right
[43:45] for we have not in the high priest which
[43:46] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[43:49] our infirmities but was in all points
[43:51] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[43:53] amen is't that wonderful yes he can be
[43:56] touched with the feeling
[43:57] of our infirmity so to show you that
[43:59] this wasn't just Old Testament what
[44:00] David was saying this is New Testament
[44:02] as well amen cuz he can feel it he can
[44:05] feel the infirmity so what's he doing
[44:07] storing it up yes storing up this is the
[44:10] reason why the songwriter I thought had
[44:12] one of the greatest inspiration out one
[44:14] of the songs I heard tears are a
[44:16] language that God can understand that's
[44:18] right he interprets unknown languages
[44:21] and tears can become an unknown language
[44:23] and this is what we have to understand
[44:25] the who the who of what we're talking
[44:26] about a lot of times when God don't
[44:28] answer us right away we get discouraged
[44:30] through our hand well he didn't hear me
[44:32] no that don't always mean he didn't hear
[44:34] you that just means he didn't answer
[44:35] right then right you ever talk to
[44:38] somebody and you've been talking to them
[44:40] for six months and they ain't never said
[44:41] a word back about it and then a year
[44:43] down the road you find out everything
[44:45] you've been saying to them was hitting
[44:46] home and they're changing their life and
[44:48] everything's different you thought well
[44:49] I didn't think that guy was even
[44:50] listening well he was he just didn't do
[44:52] much answering
[44:54] right praise the Lord right brother
[44:57] I want that to drive home because if you
[44:59] can understand the who God don't always
[45:02] answer the moment you speak but that
[45:04] don't mean he ain't listening amen that
[45:06] don't mean he ain't hearing he hears it
[45:08] and he listens maybe he just chose not
[45:10] to answer back right amen you say well
[45:12] that's mean well when you're God you can
[45:14] make the rules amen
[45:17] uhhuh right brother
[45:19] right Hallelujah thatly right Hallelujah
[45:23] all right and Adam Clark's commentary on
[45:25] this in Hebrews I like what Adam Clark
[45:27] says here and I I bring some of these
[45:29] things into these studies because I like
[45:31] to give you different ways of yes sir
[45:33] hearing it said I think it makes it
[45:34] plainer I really like it brother Jesse
[45:36] myself the way some of these men put
[45:38] these things they really under that man
[45:39] anointing boy they really had a real
[45:41] understanding didn't they he said to the
[45:43] objection of your high priest entered
[45:44] into the heavens that he can have no
[45:47] participation with you no sympathy for
[45:50] you because you are Out Of Reach from
[45:53] the feelings and the infirmities Paul
[45:55] then answers back to such questions we
[45:58] have not a high priest who cannot
[45:59] sympathize with our weakness though he
[46:01] be the Son of God as to his human nature
[46:03] and so forth he said and to his equal
[46:06] with his divine nature of God or with
[46:09] God rather he said having submitted
[46:11] himself to all the trials and distresses
[46:14] being a partaker of the human nature was
[46:17] in all points tempted and so forth as we
[46:20] were he is able to secure them so the
[46:23] people saying Christ Our Lord Jesus has
[46:27] no participation with us no sympathy for
[46:29] us we're out of reach of human feeling
[46:32] and infirmity God Is Out Of Reach from
[46:34] us then Paul in this verse here he
[46:37] challenges that idea for saying but our
[46:40] high priest can be touched yes for the
[46:43] feeling first now the King James says it
[46:45] we have not a high priest that stumbles
[46:47] some people because it sound like no
[46:48] high priest he's not there but what he's
[46:50] saying is that we do have a high priest
[46:53] yes yes Absolut we don't have just a
[46:55] high priest that you can walk over and
[46:57] touch on the shoulder and He Walks
[46:58] Behind the temple but we've got a high
[47:00] priest that can feel our actually
[47:02] infirmity now here's the beautiful part
[47:04] that word secure that he uses there in
[47:05] the Bible it means to feel the same
[47:08] feeling so God ain't guessing God ain't
[47:10] supposing God ain't surmising it seems
[47:13] like they're having a bad day God feels
[47:15] the bad day amen God experiences the bad
[47:18] day God feels it the same way you and I
[47:22] feel it all right can you pray
[47:24] now can you pray now yes amen if he's
[47:27] feeling that does that change the way
[47:29] you pray you better believe it does it
[47:31] changes everything cuz when you're
[47:32] looking at The Who and you understand
[47:35] that God feels exactly what you're going
[47:37] through well then you don't just walk up
[47:38] there and say Lord I need a new car I
[47:40] need a new job I need a girlfriend I
[47:43] need a million dollars I need some new
[47:45] tennis you well if you know he's feeling
[47:47] everything you're feeling in your heart
[47:48] when you pray and you're praying to him
[47:51] it changes everything in the way that
[47:54] you approach him knowing hey this guy
[47:56] guys is actually listening to me yes
[47:59] amen that's what I've said about a lot
[48:00] of people when it comes to God they talk
[48:02] about God God God God God Jesus Jesus
[48:04] Jes they don't even know the man right
[48:06] right they've never even met him never
[48:07] had a relationship well when you know
[48:09] him by relationship then when you pray
[48:12] brother benjam you can walk right in
[48:13] there God I know you hear me I know
[48:15] you're listening to me I know you feel
[48:18] my burden I don't have to say a word you
[48:20] already know what I'm going through and
[48:22] I am just going to pour my heart out to
[48:24] you I know you're listening you may not
[48:26] answer answer but I know you hear me
[48:28] amen hallelujah do we got to who you
[48:31] better believe we got to who we got it
[48:33] now all right now and let's pick up the
[48:36] what just a little bit here and go on
[48:37] into that all right now in Luke chapter
[48:40] 18 10-4 now let's pick up this what and
[48:44] this we're going to get into this what a
[48:46] little bit more about the what the who
[48:48] the what the where the when the why and
[48:51] how and we won't catch all of them we
[48:53] won't have time but we just just a few
[48:54] little things here and right this down
[48:56] now you don't have turn there exactly
[48:58] and I think maybe brother will get
[49:00] another scripture up here in just a
[49:01] moment but WR write it down Luke 18 10-4
[49:05] all right now this is what Jesus said
[49:07] there's two men praying they go up to
[49:09] the temple to pray one's a Pharisee
[49:11] one's a Publican the Pharisee prays thus
[49:15] with himself I thank thee Lord I'm not
[49:18] as other
[49:19] men I fast twice I give
[49:22] tithe then the Publican standing a far
[49:25] off would not so much as even lift up
[49:29] his eyes to heaven but smote himself
[49:31] upon his breast saying God be merciful
[49:33] to me a
[49:34] sinner he said I tell you this man went
[49:37] down to his house Justified rather than
[49:39] the other and then he makes the
[49:41] statement he that humbles himself he
[49:43] shall be exalted he that uh abases he
[49:46] that exalts himself shall be abased now
[49:49] notice where these two men are
[49:51] standing in the temple in the courts of
[49:54] the temple where prayer is common
[49:57] offered all right some when he renders
[50:00] this stood by himself and prayed in this
[50:04] way it is the characteristic of this
[50:07] sect of Pharisees who would dread the
[50:10] contact of Sinners wow so they would
[50:14] stand by thems away from all the rest of
[50:17] the Sinners publicans extortioners
[50:20] because they believed that even if the
[50:22] shadow of a gentile fell on them they go
[50:24] bathe themselves in water cuz they've
[50:26] been dirtied up defiled this is the kind
[50:28] of thinking these people had when they
[50:30] went to prayer watch their prayer life
[50:33] was a direct reflection of their real
[50:36] life yes yes their inside life show
[50:39] what's the outside life I'd like to stop
[50:42] right here and start explaining what's
[50:43] the matter with preachers in this
[50:44] message
[50:46] now and not to mention the congregations
[50:48] and followup yes sir yes sir everything
[50:50] I'm preacher does of who he really is
[50:53] 10% of it's right here 90% of it's where
[50:56] away where nobody body can see what's
[50:57] going on a real man of God a real
[50:59] servant of the Lord his real walk with
[51:01] God is 90% out there in that prayer life
[51:04] talking of the Lord being dealt with by
[51:06] God and 10% standing here in the pull
[51:08] pit I can always tell whether that man's
[51:10] ever even had a relationship with the
[51:11] Lord at all CU I can tell by the way he
[51:14] preaches whether or not he's even got a
[51:15] prayer life or not right amen amen I can
[51:18] tell you that right away you hear people
[51:19] get up and preach uh Lord a father uh
[51:22] Lord uh uh and I think you know they
[51:24] really ought to spend some more time
[51:25] talking to him
[51:27] right exactly right and then when they
[51:29] preach they've got the same type of
[51:31] expression now here here's what I'm
[51:32] trying to get at how am I going to lead
[51:35] anybody into a relationship with Christ
[51:38] when I don't have one myself how do I
[51:40] get it I've got to pray amen amen I've
[51:43] got to talk to the Lord I got to spend
[51:44] some time with God if I don't know
[51:46] anything about the man how am I going to
[51:47] tell you how wonderful he is I've got to
[51:49] know something myself so they would
[51:51] stand by themsel all right Hypocrites
[51:53] are often the most Orthodox in the
[51:56] opinion of any class of men you better
[51:58] believe they are they know the truth
[52:00] they admit it and use it frequently in
[52:02] their prayers and conversation they'll
[52:05] even
[52:06] persecute those who may really be wrong
[52:10] and they are but of course you
[52:12] understand they they will they will P
[52:15] even in his prayer look at how he's
[52:17] praying God thank you didn't make me
[52:19] like this sinner down here right right
[52:21] he's persecuting the man yes no wonder
[52:23] he walked out of the prayer closet and
[52:24] done the very same thing yeah yes cuz in
[52:27] prayer he was persecuting amen this is
[52:29] why Jesus said pray for those that
[52:31] despitefully use you didn't say
[52:33] persecute him yes said pray for him God
[52:36] help me have a sweet attitude toward
[52:38] that brother help me have a nice
[52:39] attitude toward that sister if you pray
[52:41] for him in the outside will reflect what
[52:44] you prayed for on the end that's right
[52:46] if you prayed on the end God rained fire
[52:48] down on them you'll probably act like
[52:49] that on the outside that's right brother
[52:50] right yes sir amen see it's not wrong to
[52:54] thank God that he's kept us from the
[52:55] gross sins which other men and so forth
[52:58] commit but it should not be done in an
[53:00] ostentatious manner boy that's a big
[53:02] word in he said nor should it be done
[53:05] forgetting that we are great sinners in
[53:07] need of Pardon ourselves so the
[53:09] Pharisees were speaking in the way of I
[53:13] I have never been like these
[53:16] guys I'm a Pharisee I'm clean from the
[53:20] time I was born I am not like that bunch
[53:23] of people right right you understand why
[53:25] Jesus couldn't do nothing with them
[53:27] right yeah absolutely so how could they
[53:29] hear him when he talked to them yes sir
[53:32] yes how could these Pharisees of God
[53:33] came right down in the building and said
[53:35] hey you're a sinner well they're not
[53:38] going to listen to that right they
[53:40] turned their ears from it yes but this
[53:42] is the reason why a prostitute could bow
[53:44] at his feet and get more out of Jesus in
[53:46] five minutes than their 40 Years of
[53:49] Pharisees amen yes sir yes sir this is a
[53:52] reason why why their attitude toward the
[53:54] who the what they the what that they're
[53:56] standing by see yes watch here I love he
[54:00] says standing a far off in the temple
[54:03] where the where the where the Publican
[54:04] was at now the place where this was at
[54:07] was actually offered in the temple was
[54:10] the court of the women so in other words
[54:12] the Pharisee would Advance themsel as
[54:16] near to the main part of the temple as
[54:19] they could but the Publican would stand
[54:22] as far back as possible even to the
[54:25] court of the Gentiles
[54:28] almost as if he was a pagan himself
[54:31] being conscious of his
[54:33] unworthiness he stood far back as far
[54:36] back as he could saying God be merciful
[54:38] to me as sinner but the Pharisee went
[54:41] all the way up just as close to the
[54:43] throne as he could get as we would say
[54:44] yes because he believed himself to have
[54:46] a right there the other didn't believe
[54:48] he had a right there so he's back there
[54:51] praying God have mercy on me and the
[54:52] other one's up there saying thank God
[54:54] you didn't make me like this guy right
[54:56] but Jesus said that's the one that's
[54:58] going to be abased that's the one that's
[55:01] going to be exalted amen amen why the
[55:04] attitude of the prayer they were looking
[55:06] at the what and The Who and said God
[55:09] you're a God of Holiness and
[55:11] righteousness and I'm looking at the
[55:13] what I'm looking at who I am I am a
[55:15] sinner in need of your grace so when
[55:18] they prayed they didn't walk up like a
[55:20] lot of people do nowadays I'm the
[55:23] bride I'm elected
[55:27] I'm
[55:27] predestinated right glory to God
[55:29] hallelujah God you owe it to me cuz I'm
[55:33] bride right brother oh man no wonder
[55:36] people don't get nowhere right right
[55:38] they don't understand the what yes the
[55:40] what is I'm talking to the one that can
[55:43] take it from me or give it to me yes yes
[55:47] I have no control over so I got to come
[55:48] to him with the right kind of attitude
[55:50] Lord Jesus I thank you for making me
[55:52] bride I thank you for making me elect
[55:55] but is it your will that certain things
[55:58] would happen you see that's the
[55:59] different attitude of it amen but a lot
[56:02] of them I'm the bride Lord Jesus you owe
[56:04] it to me God don't owe us nothing
[56:06] brother amen amen don't owe us nothing
[56:10] not one thing yes now let's look at
[56:13] another Avenue of prayer all right
[56:15] Exodus 2 23-25 all right you can put
[56:18] this one on the board if you want so
[56:20] Matthew you read this for us if you
[56:22] would Exodus 2 23-25
[56:27] all right this is another way of prayer
[56:29] now watch what happens when these
[56:31] children of Israel pray all right go
[56:33] ahead kid and it came to pass in process
[56:36] of time that the king of Egypt died and
[56:39] the children of Israel sighed by reason
[56:41] of the bondage and they cried and their
[56:44] Cry came up unto God by reason of the
[56:47] bondage and God heard their groaning and
[56:50] God remembered his Covenant with Abraham
[56:53] with Isaac and with Jacob
[56:56] and God looked upon the children of
[56:58] Israel and God had respect unto them now
[57:00] this is a wonderful thing when you study
[57:03] now when they Cried unto God when they
[57:07] Cried unto God now watch this very
[57:10] powerful remark God when he heard their
[57:14] groanings their groanings then caused
[57:17] God to remember his word
[57:21] amen yes this is why we pray this is the
[57:24] what yes we pray so God can remember his
[57:28] word not that God forgot it now not that
[57:31] God forgot it but that you're reminding
[57:33] God Lord I'm still here I'm still
[57:36] believing your word not that God forgot
[57:38] about you but God likes to be reminded
[57:40] of things he likes you to call it to his
[57:43] attention amen father I'm still
[57:44] believing you I still got confidence in
[57:46] you I'm still trusting you praise God
[57:49] when they groaned God remembered his
[57:51] Covenant and look at this verse 25 God
[57:54] looked upon the children of Israel so he
[57:55] didn't just hear him but then he turns
[57:57] to look at him yes and then God had
[58:00] respect unto him yes amen God respected
[58:03] him this the whole reason why God sent a
[58:06] Moses cuz God respected him yes hang on
[58:10] everybody some people God don't respect
[58:12] that's right amen amen yes has no
[58:15] respect for them they ignore the word
[58:18] they don't live right yes tell them
[58:20] whatever to do they ignore it right they
[58:22] pretty much by their attitude tell God
[58:23] to jump in a river how could God respect
[58:25] some somebody that don't respect him
[58:27] that's right right amen right yes see
[58:32] God heard God remembered God looked God
[58:36] respected that's the way it works for us
[58:39] amen amen God heard God remembered God
[58:42] looked God respected all right Exodus
[58:45] chapter 3 now
[58:48] 7-9 all right little brother you read
[58:51] for us it's your
[58:54] turn 7-9 now watch this is exactly God
[58:58] once again talking to the children of
[59:00] Israel and the Lord said
[59:02] I the affli of my people which are in
[59:05] Egypt and I've heard their Cry by reason
[59:08] of their did you catch that I heard
[59:10] their cry what was their cry their
[59:13] prayers yes praise God for I know their
[59:17] sorrow M and I come down to deliver them
[59:20] out of the hand of the Egyptians and to
[59:22] bre them up out of that land a good land
[59:25] andarge
[59:26] a FL with milk and honey the place of
[59:29] the Canaan can Canaanites and the
[59:32] Hittites and the amorites and the
[59:33] parites Andes and the jeites now
[59:37] therefore Behold The Cry of the children
[59:39] of Israel come up unto me have also seen
[59:42] the oppression where the Egyptian
[59:46] oppress so when when they hears their
[59:48] cry watch The Cry or this
[59:52] prayer causes
[59:55] God to change his Direction in other
[59:58] words there was prophecy that held these
[1:00:01] people in this land of
[1:00:04] bondage God heard him God heard him and
[1:00:07] God heard him how long did God hear them
[1:00:09] about 400 years yes sir yes sir amen my
[1:00:12] goodness how many vials were stored up
[1:00:15] yeah right of Israelite vials vials of
[1:00:19] prayer just setting up there in heaven
[1:00:21] stored up bottled up tears amen
[1:00:26] Storehouse in heaven full of them yes
[1:00:28] sir no wonder when Moses stepped out
[1:00:32] that he just about turned Egypt upside
[1:00:35] down the first day much left the other
[1:00:37] day amen amen yes he call he calls for
[1:00:41] fly you understand why he could create
[1:00:43] yes all them prayers sitting up there
[1:00:45] uhhuh my goodness okay why plagues and
[1:00:47] Locust could fall all them prayers
[1:00:49] sitting up there yes sir I tell you
[1:00:51] brother when God goes to answer in a lot
[1:00:52] of prayer he answers in a big way amen
[1:00:55] that's the reason why God could respond
[1:00:56] if you'll notice he hears their cry
[1:00:59] verse eight he comes down to deliver
[1:01:01] them so the Deliverance was a direct
[1:01:04] result of the cry yes yes I hope you
[1:01:07] understand that that's why if you just
[1:01:09] invest a little bit of time oh God I
[1:01:11] need some help well your help may come
[1:01:13] little then yes you understand this just
[1:01:15] like in the Bible when the man uh Elisha
[1:01:18] told him said Smite the ground with your
[1:01:20] with your bow and he just smoted it a
[1:01:22] couple times he had a whole lot more bow
[1:01:24] arrows in his quiver he said why didn't
[1:01:26] you smite him more than that he said now
[1:01:28] God's only going to Smite Syria that
[1:01:30] many times you see little bottles of
[1:01:33] Tears produce little results that's
[1:01:35] right lots of bottles of Tears produce
[1:01:38] big results that's why we should never
[1:01:41] stop asking God for what we want amen
[1:01:44] amen cuz the more we ask when God goes
[1:01:47] to answer he answers and reciprocates
[1:01:50] and gives back to us the way that we
[1:01:52] give into it so if you're going to put a
[1:01:54] little time in you're going to give one
[1:01:56] minute a year Lord I'd like to get saved
[1:01:59] no wonder people don't get saved that's
[1:02:02] why they say saved about a minute
[1:02:03] because that's all they put into it
[1:02:06] right right brother B amen I can take
[1:02:09] off we' have evangelism meeting right
[1:02:11] now on that thought right there that's
[1:02:13] the reason why that they hang out about
[1:02:15] 6 months and they're gone you know why
[1:02:17] they've only put about 6 months into the
[1:02:18] thing amen amen if you're going to serve
[1:02:21] the Lord you got to put a lot into this
[1:02:23] thing yes sir yes sir every day of your
[1:02:24] life you got to put it over time
[1:02:26] sometime I like being an overtime
[1:02:27] Christian yes am when it comes to
[1:02:29] serving the lord I'm I'm going work a
[1:02:31] hard yes amen put more into it you get
[1:02:36] more out of it look at how God responded
[1:02:38] the way he responded was a result to the
[1:02:41] way he they pray beautiful beautiful
[1:02:43] exactly that's the what we're talking
[1:02:45] about oh my well so many more of those
[1:02:48] W's in there we going to get to them all
[1:02:49] but I'm I'm just going to catch the main
[1:02:50] points go beautiful beautiful so you
[1:02:53] basically saying the the the more
[1:02:55] prayers like say you praying for the
[1:02:56] same thing because the Bible I know
[1:02:58] somewhere it says don't be repetitious
[1:03:00] yeah that's true too so you saying the
[1:03:03] more that you pray for a certain thing
[1:03:05] the more time effort you put in and the
[1:03:06] more sincere you is when God comes to
[1:03:09] answer it at that time the same amount
[1:03:11] that's what you're getting that's right
[1:03:12] that's exactly right and it's a good
[1:03:14] point on that about the vain repetition
[1:03:16] and I I'm going to come to that in just
[1:03:17] a little bit we'll just hit it now in
[1:03:20] other words when Jesus say don't pray
[1:03:22] vain repetition what he's talking about
[1:03:24] is don't pray without a purpose yes amen
[1:03:28] amen you understand if if a person's
[1:03:31] just praying for the sake of praying
[1:03:33] they have no purpose behind it but
[1:03:34] what's the use of praying all you doing
[1:03:35] is saying a bunch of words yeah 400
[1:03:38] years they had a purpose they prayed we
[1:03:41] w't have this mess they had a purpose
[1:03:43] every time they prayed right amen it's
[1:03:44] not pain that way yes see uh let's say
[1:03:50] God reveals something to you Lord you're
[1:03:52] going to do a certain thing well then
[1:03:54] maybe you wouldn't have to pray about it
[1:03:55] no more but leading up to that one
[1:03:57] moment that God confirms to you it's
[1:04:00] going to be all right you might pray 400
[1:04:02] prayers getting up to that one moment
[1:04:05] when you're satisfied it's going to be
[1:04:07] all right well then you might just step
[1:04:08] away and say all right lord it's in your
[1:04:09] hands I don't have to touch it no more
[1:04:11] right but until then you're you're
[1:04:14] satisfied you see what I'm saying vain
[1:04:16] repetition without a purpose that's the
[1:04:18] main part of it Samy I worked with a
[1:04:20] Buddhist girl and she told me that to be
[1:04:22] more holy they walk around saying budha
[1:04:25] Buddha Buddha Buddha and they like make
[1:04:28] a chant over and over and that makes
[1:04:30] them more holy and that's their prayer
[1:04:32] just to repeat one work what kind of
[1:04:35] people we be walk around and said Jesus
[1:04:37] Jesus Jesus all the time be a lot better
[1:04:40] for us wouldn't it because we got the
[1:04:41] right name they don't right yeah but
[1:04:44] that's that's true there's no purpose in
[1:04:46] it it's for the purpose of ritualistic
[1:04:49] just fallowing a bunch of ritual ritual
[1:04:51] doesn't make us holy right right ritual
[1:04:53] makes us punctual it makes us whatever
[1:04:56] but doesn't make us holy yes all right
[1:04:59] teaching on Moses little boys and girls
[1:05:01] does God hear prayer yes he hears it
[1:05:04] does he answer quick not all the time
[1:05:06] sometimes he makes us wait amen
[1:05:09] sometimes he makes us
[1:05:11] wait praise God I'm kind of gigging a
[1:05:14] little bit because that's the hard part
[1:05:15] ain't it yes amen and sitting around
[1:05:18] waiting for it yes right Lord I've said
[1:05:21] I've said I've said well hold on maybe
[1:05:23] it ain't stored up yet right need to be
[1:05:26] stored a little bit more maybe when God
[1:05:27] goes to pouring the thing out it needs
[1:05:29] to be a bigger blessing than what you
[1:05:31] expect it to be yes maybe there needs to
[1:05:33] be more work put into it let me explain
[1:05:35] to you this way let's say after church
[1:05:38] here we get out here and get stuck in a
[1:05:39] ditch the snow are falling down and
[1:05:41] somebody runs into a ditch well big old
[1:05:44] truck what two three four tons ever how
[1:05:47] big the thing if it's a big old douy it
[1:05:48] might be three or four tons fall into
[1:05:50] the ditch while you walk over there and
[1:05:52] you grab one of the little hooks on the
[1:05:54] front and you just make a little a pool
[1:05:56] like this well I don't reckon we're
[1:05:58] going to get it out tonight well of
[1:06:00] course you ain't going to get it out
[1:06:01] tonight because your effort wasn't
[1:06:03] strong enough to get it pulled out but
[1:06:05] you get a chain you get you another car
[1:06:08] three or four brothers one on either
[1:06:09] side of it and pull it you see the
[1:06:11] effort is how you get the result of what
[1:06:14] you got maybe the problem is is that
[1:06:17] sometimes when prayers ain't answered is
[1:06:18] because we ain't put the right effort
[1:06:19] into it right amen something to think
[1:06:22] about ain't it y all right in judges 16
[1:06:25] verse
[1:06:26] 26-28 you just write it down judges 16
[1:06:30] 26-28 Samson called unto the Lord when
[1:06:35] he called on the Lord he asked God to
[1:06:37] remember him this is when he's blind and
[1:06:40] got the pillars in his hand and asked
[1:06:42] God to avenge him his eyes he said ask
[1:06:45] God to
[1:06:46] remember and God remembered it God gave
[1:06:49] him strength and the Bible said he
[1:06:52] killed more Philistines at the end than
[1:06:54] he did at the beginning but here's the
[1:06:56] point I want you to get in your
[1:06:58] mind
[1:07:00] Samson gave his heart to Delilah but
[1:07:03] gave his strength to the Lord exactly
[1:07:05] exactly so the results of his ministry
[1:07:08] was what he gave his strength to that
[1:07:12] was the successes but look at the
[1:07:13] failure at the end yes right this is why
[1:07:16] you see a lot of churches and things
[1:07:18] have a good pastor good preacher the
[1:07:20] people are singers and musicians and
[1:07:23] great technologists and all kinds of
[1:07:25] things boy they're just clicking right
[1:07:26] along all of a sudden they disappear
[1:07:29] somebody's committed adultery somebody's
[1:07:31] lied somebody's split somebody's done
[1:07:33] this thing that thing why is that oh
[1:07:36] listen they give their strength unto the
[1:07:38] church wow wow but they never give their
[1:07:40] heart unto God Amen how do you do that
[1:07:44] prayer yes you got to you got to commit
[1:07:46] these things to prayer God I give you my
[1:07:48] heart and prayer if more preachers would
[1:07:50] do that if more lay people would do that
[1:07:52] Deacon trust these what more Housewives
[1:07:54] we'd be in better shap amen see brother
[1:07:57] says like this no wonder the secret has
[1:07:59] been discovered you take the baptism the
[1:08:02] holy ghost out of the people and they go
[1:08:04] for the things of the world instead of
[1:08:05] going for god wow wow see what good does
[1:08:08] an intellectual talk do if it ain't got
[1:08:10] the holy spirit in it amen amen and
[1:08:13] there's Samson standing there he's
[1:08:15] divided he's split so part of himself is
[1:08:18] for this part of himself is for that and
[1:08:21] it I want you to catch this it wasn't
[1:08:23] until he became perfectly uni
[1:08:26] and surrendered to God that he had the
[1:08:28] great success of his ministry that he
[1:08:30] done what God called him to do amen amen
[1:08:32] this is what prayer real prayer puts us
[1:08:36] together yes we're not split we're not
[1:08:38] this way and that way and the other
[1:08:40] we're one we're one before the Lord
[1:08:42] remember Jesus said serve god with your
[1:08:44] heart soul body mind Spirit everything
[1:08:47] see so all of it becomes Focus every
[1:08:50] part of you comes focused when you're in
[1:08:51] prayer thy will be done thy kingdom come
[1:08:54] all right just a little a little bit
[1:08:55] further we going have to quit Ain got no
[1:08:56] idea how long we've been up here but I
[1:08:58] don't want to hold it too long all right
[1:09:00] I've been known to go two three four
[1:09:01] hours on meetings like this so I'll be
[1:09:03] careful all right now picking up another
[1:09:06] little spot here and uh uh we just want

[1:12:30] miss morning prayer don't sit and beat
[1:12:31] yourself up the rest of the day have a
[1:12:33] ready attitude Lord the first chance I
[1:12:35] get we're going to talk a little while
[1:12:36] amen
[1:12:37] amen beautiful I'm going to say this
[1:12:40] beautiful hang on everybody I'd rather
[1:12:42] have that right there than a two-hour
[1:12:43] prayer life yes yes cuz I can have two
[1:12:46] hours of prayer every single day five
[1:12:48] times a day I missed that attitude right
[1:12:50] there I've missed every bit of it amen
[1:12:52] absolutely you understand yes sir it's
[1:12:54] got to be it's got to be that way yes
[1:12:57] that was that was that was the real home
[1:12:58] run tonight I hope you got a hold of
[1:12:59] that scripture yes sir beautiful and the
[1:13:02] Lord hit that one farther than the Cubs
[1:13:03] did the other
[1:13:05] night yes sir amen they told me they
[1:13:07] turned Chicago upside down I just pray
[1:13:10] God turn my heart upside down that's all
[1:13:11] I yes sir yes amen if you're bald people
[1:13:15] I don't know if you even notice it watch
[1:13:18] here 1 Corinthians
[1:13:19] 75 all right not have turn there just
[1:13:22] write it down the Bible even said for
[1:13:25] for married men and women that in order
[1:13:29] for them to give thems to fasting and
[1:13:32] prayer you'll notice it's consent for a
[1:13:36] time so we're talking about the
[1:13:37] difference in Long prayers and and
[1:13:39] posted stamp prayers so if a man will
[1:13:41] say feeling led the Lord to try to draw
[1:13:44] close to the Lord in a certain area
[1:13:46] maybe the Lord's dealing with him on
[1:13:47] something according to the laws of the
[1:13:50] Bible husband and wife are supposed to
[1:13:52] have a private relation ship life
[1:13:56] together behind the bedroom door and
[1:13:58] they're not allowed to enter into long
[1:14:01] fasting and prayer except they seek for
[1:14:04] permission from their spouse honey I'm
[1:14:06] going into this I need consent for a
[1:14:08] time and then as soon as the thing's
[1:14:10] over with they come together again now
[1:14:12] this is referring sexually they come
[1:14:15] together again quickly that Satan not
[1:14:17] tempt them for their incontinency or
[1:14:19] inconsistency is what that word is see
[1:14:21] in other words to give yourself in into
[1:14:25] this for a consent of time so you'll
[1:14:27] watch it shows us that even in this
[1:14:30] little example that God is mindful of
[1:14:34] the responsibilities that we have as
[1:14:37] human beings and how that it interacts
[1:14:40] with our prayer life amen uhuh C can you
[1:14:42] see that clearly amen it inter our life
[1:14:44] interacts with all these other things so
[1:14:46] if we're going to enter into a deeper
[1:14:48] something with God and I'm a married man
[1:14:50] I've got to go back and ask that woman
[1:14:52] right there may I have your permission
[1:14:53] to fast and pray for a little while why
[1:14:56] I've got to ask her well she's my
[1:14:58] responsibility and I according to the
[1:15:00] Bible I owe her love debts right right
[1:15:03] oh that's that's a whole another study
[1:15:04] in itself we'll come back after while
[1:15:06] and get that one down the road somewhere
[1:15:07] another right right I don't know good as
[1:15:09] I'm feeling we may just hit it all
[1:15:10] tonight who
[1:15:12] knows huh I've got to ask her I
[1:15:16] absolutely got to ask permission why
[1:15:18] because there's a responsibility even in
[1:15:20] that now the word that Paul uses here
[1:15:22] for prayer I like this it the original
[1:15:25] word the original Greek word the
[1:15:26] definition of it is like
[1:15:28] this prayer or a place in open air where
[1:15:32] the Jews would pray outside the cities
[1:15:34] when they had no
[1:15:35] synagogue they would sometimes situate
[1:15:38] thems on a bank or a stream or the shore
[1:15:42] of a sea where there was a supply of
[1:15:44] water for washing their hands before
[1:15:46] prayer so before they would pray they
[1:15:49] would wash their hands and then they
[1:15:51] would go into to pray now now that that
[1:15:53] gives you a little type of something
[1:15:54] because because the hands represented
[1:15:57] the doings the doings your daily
[1:16:00] activities so it shows that your daily
[1:16:04] life and your prayer life they interact
[1:16:06] one with another yes and God's not going
[1:16:08] to straighten that out for us amen amen
[1:16:11] it's our responsibility to make them
[1:16:13] interact right right amen amen amen
[1:16:16] beautiful some of y'all folks that a't
[1:16:18] blinking at me no more
[1:16:20] Hallelujah now that's right that's
[1:16:21] exactly right exactly right all right
[1:16:23] Ephesians 6:18 write this down praying
[1:16:27] always with all prayer and supplication
[1:16:29] in the spirit showing that you must pray
[1:16:32] in the spirit watching there unto with
[1:16:34] all perseverance and supplication for
[1:16:36] All Saints so you're not just praying
[1:16:37] for yourself you're praying for Saints
[1:16:39] as well yes all right in the U Bible
[1:16:43] dictionary I like it says here prayers
[1:16:45] different kinds all right now watch I'm
[1:16:47] going to show you this interaction part
[1:16:48] of this and then we're GNA try to quit
[1:16:50] all right Matthew 66 as we read there he
[1:16:54] talked about the secret part of prayer
[1:16:57] but now there's a secret part of prayer
[1:16:59] there's a social part of prayer there's
[1:17:02] a family part of prayer there's worship
[1:17:06] part of prayer or even social worship
[1:17:08] for that matter there is a public part
[1:17:11] of prayer and service in the sanctuary
[1:17:15] part of prayer so somebody for example
[1:17:19] that would say well what is my prayer
[1:17:21] life it's all of that yes yes it's not
[1:17:24] just praying at home home but it's
[1:17:25] family prayers it's social prayers and
[1:17:28] worship like this it's public prayers
[1:17:31] you ever had anybody at your job to say
[1:17:33] man I'm in bad shape Pray For Me Right
[1:17:35] amen that's a public prayer yes instant
[1:17:37] in prayer instant in season out of
[1:17:39] season service of the sanctuary as I
[1:17:41] said a minute ago brother Austin come up
[1:17:42] here and lead us in prayer see that
[1:17:44] service in the sanctuary so somebody
[1:17:45] says well I got a prayer life if they
[1:17:47] only pray thems and God they've only got
[1:17:50] one part of a prayer life right right
[1:17:52] right yeah amen beautiful beautiful
[1:17:56] H and that's about where the Manchester
[1:17:58] folks got
[1:17:59] quiet but this is true see there's more
[1:18:02] to it beautiful than just the personal
[1:18:05] private prayer that you have remember
[1:18:08] the doings of the Washings of the hand
[1:18:10] the prophet told us that the family
[1:18:13] altar was the kitchen
[1:18:15] table that's the craziest thing anybody
[1:18:17] 21st century people thinks that's a
[1:18:20] ridiculous remark but more things in
[1:18:24] society
[1:18:25] uh politicians for example did you know
[1:18:28] when they're going to try to work out a
[1:18:30] deal and they're going to try to fix the
[1:18:32] world you know first thing they do feed
[1:18:34] them right the first thing they do they
[1:18:36] set them down at dinner and they let
[1:18:38] everybody sit down and start eating you
[1:18:40] know why they start relaxing they let
[1:18:42] their guard down a little while and then
[1:18:44] they can really you ever notice that you
[1:18:46] get a bunch of saints together like that
[1:18:47] and people don't know one another have a
[1:18:49] special meeting and people come every
[1:18:50] which way and you go out to eat and
[1:18:53] ain't nobody talking to one another
[1:18:54] they're standing in the line Ryan or
[1:18:56] Ruby Tuesday or some buffet or golden
[1:18:58] crowd or something everybody stand there
[1:19:00] how you doing good how are you doing
[1:19:02] fine how's the wife she's good how's
[1:19:04] your wife fine but all of a sudden they
[1:19:08] get about half a plate into them and
[1:19:10] everybody starts smiling and talking and
[1:19:12] conversing and you think he best
[1:19:15] friends you thought they lost at sea
[1:19:18] together and they had dependent on each
[1:19:19] other for their life and so something
[1:19:22] about it the family altar or being there
[1:19:24] at the table is where brother R said we
[1:19:27] pray together as a family God we need
[1:19:31] more of it we need more of it at the
[1:19:32] noron household jumping up and down
[1:19:34] running every which way these evangelism
[1:19:36] trips and your family alers a Big Mac
[1:19:38] through the through through the through
[1:19:40] the drive-thru on your way to next 400
[1:19:42] miles you know we need a lot more of it
[1:19:44] I guarantee God help me in it yes sir
[1:19:46] see all of these aspects of prayer all
[1:19:48] right now let me let me talk to you now
[1:19:50] about conversing before the Lord all
[1:19:52] right get your get your pencils ready or
[1:19:54] if you're going catch the recording
[1:19:55] later Exodus
[1:19:58] 32:11 tells us beseeching the Lord okay
[1:20:02] 1 Samuel
[1:20:03] 1:15 tells us pouring out our soul
[1:20:06] before the Lord 2 Chronicles 32 and2
[1:20:10] praying and crying to Heaven watch all
[1:20:12] these different me modes and means of
[1:20:14] prayer seeking unto God and making
[1:20:18] supplication that's job 8 and5 Drawing
[1:20:21] Near to God that's Psalm 73 and 28
[1:20:25] bowing the knees that's Ephesians
[1:20:27] 3:14 prayer presupposes a belief in the
[1:20:32] personality of God his ability and
[1:20:34] willingness to communicate with us his
[1:20:37] personal control of all things so
[1:20:40] acceptable and and acceptable prayer
[1:20:43] must be sincere that's Hebrews
[1:20:46] 10:22 it must be offered with reverence
[1:20:49] and godly fear all right ask and you
[1:20:53] shall receive that's Matthew 77 and 8
[1:20:56] Matthew 21 and 22 that's Mark 11 and 24
[1:21:01] it's St John 14 13 and 14 in the Name of
[1:21:05] Christ that's how we pray is in his name
[1:21:08] those scriptures are St John 16232 24 St
[1:21:12] John
[1:21:13] 15:16 and Ephesians 2 and8 Ephesians 5
[1:21:17] and 20 Colossians 3:1 17 1 Peter 2 and 5
[1:21:22] all them places tell us how to approach
[1:21:24] God prayer in different kinds secret
[1:21:28] social Family Worship Public Service of
[1:21:31] the sanctuary see brother man said if
[1:21:33] you want to be an edent to a meeting
[1:21:35] just don't pray wow that's you want to
[1:21:37] be the greatest help the meeting can
[1:21:38] have is not financially set aside an
[1:21:41] hour or two a day to pray for the
[1:21:44] meeting that's how you can help a
[1:21:46] meeting more than anything else right
[1:21:48] there are no rules in the scripture that
[1:21:50] says that we must kneel but there is
[1:21:53] kneeling in the scripture it's the
[1:21:55] attitude nothing in there says we have
[1:21:57] to kneel down okay I'm going to give you
[1:21:59] an example of that the places made
[1:22:02] mention of kneeling in prayer all right
[1:22:04] if if you if you're catching this on the
[1:22:06] recording I'll try to go slower here to
[1:22:09] catch it but not not too slow First
[1:22:10] Kings
[1:22:12] 8:54 2 Chronicles
[1:22:14] 6:13 Psalm 956 Isaiah
[1:22:18] 45:23 Luke
[1:22:20] 22:41 acts 7 and 60 acts 9 and 40
[1:22:24] Ephesians 3 and14 all right now bowing
[1:22:29] and falling prostrate all right falling
[1:22:31] prostrate before the Lord that's Genesis
[1:22:34] 24:26 and verse 52 as well of the 24th
[1:22:38] chapter of Genesis so Genesis 24:26 and
[1:22:41] 52 Exodus 4 and 31 Exodus 12 and 27
[1:22:45] Matthew 2639 Mark
[1:22:48] 1435 all right of spreading out the
[1:22:51] hands in prayer that's First Kings 8:22
[1:22:54] also verse
[1:22:56] 38:54 Psalm 282 Psalm 634 Psalm
[1:23:01] 889 and 1 Timothy 2:8 that's the
[1:23:04] spreading out of the hands of standing
[1:23:07] that's 1st Samuel 1:26 1 Kings 8:14 and
[1:23:10] also verse 55 2 Chronicles 29 Mark
[1:23:15] 11:25 Luke 181
[1:23:18] and13 and if we accept the Lord's Prayer
[1:23:20] that's Matthew
[1:23:22] 69-13 the model or the pattern of prayer
[1:23:25] offer offers to us no special form of
[1:23:28] prayer but just to pray after this
[1:23:31] manner pray amen amen so you can see all
[1:23:34] of these different things in the way
[1:23:36] that we pray yes so you pick which one
[1:23:38] works for you and then that's the one
[1:23:40] you use amen amen everybody does it
[1:23:43] different yes sir all right oh there's
[1:23:46] you realize I got 57 more pages after
[1:23:49] all this still got it coming right right
[1:23:51] oh let me just let me just skip down
[1:23:53] just a little bit so much about prayer
[1:23:55] when it comes to people and prayer we
[1:23:57] could just go down through so many
[1:23:59] different things but I like this uh one
[1:24:02] man said Robinson's job prayer is like
[1:24:05] the dove that Noah sent forth which
[1:24:08] blessed him not only when it returned
[1:24:10] with the olive leaf but when it never
[1:24:12] returned at all amen that's a blessed
[1:24:16] right right right I like that amen all
[1:24:19] right now getting down to the what when
[1:24:20] and how and where and all these other
[1:24:22] guys we'll we'll catch just a couple
[1:24:24] little things in Ephesians
[1:24:26] 6:8 after taking the helmet of salvation
[1:24:29] sword of the spirit Shield of faith and
[1:24:31] so forth he says praying always with
[1:24:33] prayer and supplication so what good
[1:24:35] does it do you to dress up to fight if
[1:24:37] you ain't talking to the commander amen
[1:24:39] amen have supplication for the Saints
[1:24:41] but you got to talk to the commander as
[1:24:43] well in the expectation message brother
[1:24:45] Brandon said prayer will even change the
[1:24:48] mind of God and it did one time it
[1:24:50] changed his mind not so much that God
[1:24:52] wanted to change his mind in some way
[1:24:54] but that God heard a man's prayer even
[1:24:57] allowed him to go on the permissive will
[1:24:59] right yes of that very thing that's it
[1:25:01] right there and talking about that was 2
[1:25:03] Kings 20 go 1 through 20 and you'll find
[1:25:06] out about Hezekiah turning his face to
[1:25:08] the wall the prophet walked in thus sayi
[1:25:11] the Lord you're going to die got to
[1:25:12] almost to the chambers of the door and
[1:25:14] got to the gates of the city and the
[1:25:15] Holy Spirit said thus say Lord go back
[1:25:17] and tell him he's going to live right
[1:25:19] right I said if you're a skeptic and a
[1:25:20] doubter you to put a website up just
[1:25:22] after you got done doing the second one
[1:25:23] exactly right exactly right exactly
[1:25:25] right see brother M said like this he
[1:25:28] said remember you've got to give God a
[1:25:30] cause or a reason you've got to give God
[1:25:33] a cause or a reason it all comes down to
[1:25:37] your motive and your objective now I'm
[1:25:38] not going to quit just yet because I
[1:25:39] feel led to get this next part amen
[1:25:41] Matthew 11:2 24:25 Mark 11: 24:25 said
[1:25:45] whatsoever things you desire When you
[1:25:47] pray believe you receive them but you
[1:25:51] cannot ask God for anything except
[1:25:55] you've got the right motive and the
[1:25:57] right objective yes if you don't have
[1:25:59] the right motive and objective forget it
[1:26:01] it ain't going to work you just saying
[1:26:02] pay repetitions that's all it is you got
[1:26:04] to have a purpose behind what you're
[1:26:05] asking for yes all right God
[1:26:07] reconsidered hezekiah's case because
[1:26:11] Hezekiah wanted to do more work for the
[1:26:13] Lord yeah right it wasn't God's will for
[1:26:15] him to do it but he was a righteous man
[1:26:18] he pulled on the heart of God he wanted
[1:26:20] to do more work for the Lord it ended up
[1:26:21] being an absolute devastating thing you
[1:26:23] should never for in the first place
[1:26:25] right amen you should left alone said
[1:26:26] God you got the greater wisdom of it but
[1:26:29] it proves to us what this what this
[1:26:31] story and this example shows this end
[1:26:33] sample of the scripture shows us is it
[1:26:36] tells us that when somebody has got the
[1:26:38] right motive and objective it will so
[1:26:41] pull on the heart of god Till God's
[1:26:43] willing to do what you're wanting to
[1:26:45] what you're asking for amen he's willing
[1:26:48] to do it that's where we have to be
[1:26:50] smarter than Hezekiah and say God I
[1:26:52] really want this but is it what you you
[1:26:54] really want right right you got to be
[1:26:56] that much wiser than Hezekiah was see
[1:26:58] prayer oh I love this is the most
[1:27:01] powerful weapon ever put in the hands of
[1:27:03] a man
[1:27:06] amen there's no scud
[1:27:08] missile right there's no atomic bomb
[1:27:11] amen that can work like prayer can
[1:27:13] because you can push the button and the
[1:27:15] bomb can go boom but prayer stopped the
[1:27:17] guy pushing the button that's right
[1:27:20] that's right Hallelujah absolutely yes
[1:27:21] sir the Lord Jesus yes sir amen oh my
[1:27:25] Hallelujah beautiful beautiful yes it's
[1:27:27] our attitude towards god brother Bram
[1:27:30] says in desperation he changed the
[1:27:33] program of God in desperation in other
[1:27:36] words God haded running out a certain
[1:27:38] direction and all of a sudden here he
[1:27:42] Chang now it's not that God deviated
[1:27:44] from what he really wanted he just
[1:27:46] permitted hezekiah's
[1:27:48] way God wanted him to go yes but he
[1:27:51] permitted Hezekiah to have his way power
[1:27:53] of Prayer shows us how powerful prayer
[1:27:55] is that also instructs us and gives us
[1:27:58] pause for a moment to think if prayer is
[1:28:02] that powerful of a weapon how much more
[1:28:05] powerful is it in than than in the hands
[1:28:08] of a man or a woman that will stop and
[1:28:10] as we said right from the very beginning
[1:28:12] of the study tonight and seek thy will
[1:28:15] be done thy kingdom thy will be done if
[1:28:19] a man seeks that then prayer can be so
[1:28:22] much more powerful than what he'd ever
[1:28:23] imagine because not only does he have
[1:28:25] the powerful weapon of prayer to pull on
[1:28:28] the heart of God just like the children
[1:28:29] of Israel they wept bitterly and so for
[1:28:31] pulled on the heart of God but now they
[1:28:33] got the will of God to go along with the
[1:28:35] feeling of God amen amen praise God
[1:28:37] whether that makes it I'll tell
[1:28:39] you yes brother M said stuff that the
[1:28:42] devil can't BL that's what it is
[1:28:44] hallelujah beautiful that's what we got
[1:28:46] to be that's exactly what we've got to
[1:28:48] be see the man finally backslid on God
[1:28:51] he'd been better off he took God's first
[1:28:53] word but it proves to us how powerful
[1:28:55] prayer is let me give you another
[1:28:57] example Psalm 1061 12-15 the Bible
[1:29:00] talking about the children of Israel the
[1:29:04] Bible said he gave them their request
[1:29:07] but sent leanness into their soul right
[1:29:10] why because they wanted it so bad God
[1:29:14] permitted their
[1:29:15] way but God didn't want them to have it
[1:29:19] remember when the quail came blowing
[1:29:20] through there right right terrible they
[1:29:24] they loved it they thought it was the
[1:29:24] greatest thing in the world but it was
[1:29:26] leanness to their soul right right so
[1:29:29] why we have to ask God thy will be done
[1:29:33] amen you understand that even a preacher
[1:29:36] with the authority of the Holy Ghost on
[1:29:37] him somebody come up with a sickness and
[1:29:39] I let my hands or Jesse or somebody lay
[1:29:41] their hand on and I believe him be a
[1:29:43] holy ghost filled Son of God servant of
[1:29:45] God preacher of the Gospel I believe
[1:29:47] God's with him and I believe if he asked
[1:29:49] God to move that cancer God would do it
[1:29:52] but if he's not careful and he' done it
[1:29:54] out of the will of God God could make
[1:29:56] him pay for that cancer that wasn't
[1:29:57] supposed to be moved like that that's
[1:29:59] right brother that's right it's a
[1:30:00] dangerous thing yes sir God will
[1:30:02] sometimes permit things to happen he'll
[1:30:04] allow it because we take a gift or
[1:30:07] something and influence it that's where
[1:30:09] we got to come back and find out about
[1:30:11] this who what where when and why yes yes
[1:30:14] thy kingdom thy will be done it's an
[1:30:16] important thing amen all right uh just
[1:30:19] to pinch further now uh let's see I'm
[1:30:22] just going to skip down this a whole lot
[1:30:24] here all right in Romans
[1:30:26] 10:1 Paul's desire was for Israel to be
[1:30:29] saved did you understand that God was
[1:30:32] actually trying to answer Paul's prayer
[1:30:35] in World War
[1:30:36] II in World War II when all of that was
[1:30:40] happening with the Jews during the
[1:30:43] Holocaust period God was actually
[1:30:46] answering the Apostle Paul's prayer wow
[1:30:49] wow wow he wanted Israel to be saved
[1:30:51] they cannot be saved unless the in their
[1:30:54] Homeland wow wow so God was actually
[1:30:57] answering Paul's prayer my desire My
[1:31:00] harsh desire and prayer to God for
[1:31:02] Israel they' be saved God was answering
[1:31:04] Paul's Prayer by pushing them back into
[1:31:06] the Homeland so Israel could be saved as
[1:31:08] a nation
[1:31:10] 144,000 took him 2,000 years to get
[1:31:12] there but that prayer is finally
[1:31:13] answered amen amen Paul must have done a
[1:31:16] lot of
[1:31:17] praying for to last there 2,000 years
[1:31:19] like that all right let's turn now
[1:31:22] Romans 8:26 2 7 all right brother

[1:37:59] sorrow and Jaz called on the god of
[1:38:02] Israel saying oh that thou wouldest
[1:38:04] bless me indeed and enlarge my coast and
[1:38:07] that thine hand might be with me and
[1:38:09] that thou would us keep me from Evil
[1:38:12] that it may not grieve me and God
[1:38:15] granted him that which he requested let
[1:38:17] me hit something real quick before we go
[1:38:20] there could have been 10,000 J bezas in
[1:38:22] the country

[1:38:44] God make my life miserable that's
[1:38:46] foolish right brother right that's
[1:38:48] foolishness we want the lord to bless us
[1:38:49] and help us well I don't deserve it it's
[1:38:52] not up to us us to determine what we
[1:38:54] deserve and not deserve that's up to the
[1:38:55] one that made us yes sir yes sir
[1:38:57] absolutely if I deserved everything I
[1:38:59] got I'd always get to bad but my Daddy
[1:39:02] has a little say in
[1:39:04] that he doesn't always want me to get

[1:39:26] me whatever you want to give to me let
[1:39:29] me have that what I can handle right God

[1:39:34] requested this is the attitude of a
[1:39:36] right man look if you'll notice jz's
[1:39:38] prayer wasn't God do it or else right

[1:39:47] attitude do this for me amen amen amen
[1:39:52] praise the Lord praise God all right
[1:39:55] coming to the end now James
[1:39:58] 5 prayer of faith shall save the sick
[1:40:00] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:40:02] man avails much Elisha or Elias is the
[1:40:06] Greek rendering in the New Testament
[1:40:08] Elijah prayed and God shut the heavens
[1:40:11] it wouldn't have mattered who prayed one
[1:40:12] prayer after that God didn't hear not
[1:40:15] one prayer amen not one prayer in Israel
[1:40:17] he might have heard him but he didn't
[1:40:19] listen to him that's right right cuz the
[1:40:21] only man he was going to hear about
[1:40:23] whether those Heavens come open or not
[1:40:25] was Elijah that's right when Elijah
[1:40:28] prayed again the Bible said and said God
[1:40:30] open him up down come the rain they
[1:40:32] could have prayed 24 hours a day seven
[1:40:35] days a week they could have had a prayer
[1:40:36] vigil every night they could have joined
[1:40:38] hands around the nation got all the
[1:40:40] religious and holy men together and
[1:40:42] prayed until their eyeballs fell out and
[1:40:44] their teeth followed them that's right
[1:40:46] brother right God listened God heard him
[1:40:48] but he didn't listen that's exactly
[1:40:49] right yes sir just like right now God
[1:40:51] shut the door on the United States of
[1:40:53] America there's not enough churches in
[1:40:55] the world to pray it out of it no sir no
[1:40:57] sir she's in judgment she'll never come
[1:40:59] out of it again she's gone brother said
[1:41:00] she's over amen it don't matter whether
[1:41:03] it's the last Trump or a woman president
[1:41:04] it going matter amen you know right
[1:41:08] Trump trump Pence Trump Pence Trump
[1:41:13] Pence thought it was interesting that
[1:41:15] that Hillary's running made is a cane
[1:41:17] right right so we got Kane in the
[1:41:20] trumpet all prophetic stuff coming in
[1:41:23] but she's gone yes sir make America
[1:41:25] great again and their eyes may be great
[1:41:28] right make a bunch of money and do this
[1:41:29] that well that's great to them but
[1:41:31] she'll never be what she was spiritually
[1:41:33] never she's dead right brother right
[1:41:36] John nine Jesus passes by sees a man
[1:41:39] blind from birth the disciples asked who
[1:41:41] sinned was said this man or his parents
[1:41:44] is born blind Jesus answered said
[1:41:46] neither sin but that the works of God
[1:41:49] should be manifested in manifested in
[1:41:52] him now the the the uh the idea behind
[1:41:56] that the thing I want to try to just
[1:41:58] share with you on that is sometimes
[1:42:02] things happen so God can manifest his
[1:42:05] glory yes yes not not for any other
[1:42:08] reason but that God can manifest his
[1:42:11] glory so when circumstances come along
[1:42:14] it's sometimes so God can manifest his
[1:42:16] glory it's not always because of sin
[1:42:18] right right problems come and we pray oh
[1:42:21] God forgive me forgive me help me help
[1:42:22] me
[1:42:23] sometimes it's just a matter of God
[1:42:25] wanting to manifest his glory so our
[1:42:27] prayer should be in them situations God
[1:42:29] are you trying to get Glory out of this
[1:42:31] yes and if we ask him he'd probably tell
[1:42:33] us way it would work all right that's
[1:42:36] the secret to all the mysteries of God
[1:42:38] is
[1:42:39] prayer in Exodus 3 God talked to Moses
[1:42:43] Moses talked to God Moses found out the
[1:42:46] direct will of God the time the
[1:42:48] Revelation and everything of what he was
[1:42:50] supposed to do brother BR said we failed
[1:42:52] to find the direct revelation of our
[1:42:55] life of how to fit into the program of
[1:42:57] God that's why we got to pray we got to
[1:42:59] find that direct Revelation for our life
[1:43:02] St John
[1:43:03] 16 9-2 Jesus prays for all of
[1:43:07] us all of us that are his amen you pick
[1:43:10] it up you go on down into oh just many
[1:43:13] many more places here I'm just going to
[1:43:14] have to quit I got a got time to finish
[1:43:16] it out yes sir but yes sir got all this
[1:43:19] here 2 Timothy 3 1-5 the last days
[1:43:22] parous times would come people would be
[1:43:25] unthankful and one of the first things
[1:43:27] you're supposed to do when you pray is
[1:43:29] be thankful to the Lord that's right so
[1:43:30] it goes to show that your prayer has to
[1:43:33] be
[1:43:34] something of a Thanksgiving to God and
[1:43:37] it has to also be according to the will
[1:43:39] of God amen amen not a hay on the fort
