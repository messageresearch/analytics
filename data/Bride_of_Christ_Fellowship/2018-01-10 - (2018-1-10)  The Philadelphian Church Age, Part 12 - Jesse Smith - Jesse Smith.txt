[Music] [Music] the Lord Amen let's send our feet here let's open up to Revelation chapter 3 I'd like to look at the church ages tonight again the Philadelphia church age by the grace of the Lord I don't know if we'll finish it tonight but we're getting awfully close this is part 12 of the Philadelphia Church age part 52 of the church age series here so thankful for God's grace like I said once we finish our family once our family finishes reading through the Old Testament we're in Joel right now we're gonna start reading the church age book we're gonna probably two pages a night maybe maybe one page a night depends how much time we have and you're everybody's welcome to go through that book with us you know but we just want to go through that again and I really believe it gives us a firm foundation in the in the message and the Word of God and true Christianity I really believe that with all my heart so let's go to Revelation 3:10 I'll be out of text for tonight all right revelation 3:10 and also I don't know if you saw but I got the thirty Bibles in so if anyone needs a Bible now they're not the really nice ones they're just kind of suppose they're called like pew Bibles but if anybody needs a Bible I got thirty of them and then we have message books coming and also church age books thirty church age books come in as well so those are free to anybody who wants those by the grace of God and this week I think I finished three thousand more words on my book so I'm just trying to crank it out you know crank it out so I'm almost done with chapter three by God's grace so I'm just trying to stay focused and keep pouring myself into the ways of God revelation 3:10 by God's grace for there say Amen let's read together on three one two three because thou has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world that dwell upon the earth amen let's have a word of Prayer let's just our heads every need on your heart just make it known unto God tonight heavenly father God we love you Lord tonight we come worshiping you we choose the fear of the Lord we choose the way of the Lord we choose the word of the Lord father we're grateful Lord for this opportunity bless us here Lord God as we're in your divine presence bless every heart and soul that press their way out to the house of God or may you feed them your word tonight Lord as you always do and Lord be with our live streamers Lord God may administer to their souls as they're hanging on every word in home and those that might listen to it on the archived later on tomorrow or some other time lord I just pray you administer Lord to those individuals and Lord to that one sister who was weeping and crying for the Holy Ghost a few Wednesday nights ago as we preach father may you fill her Lord God you fill her with your love fill her with eternal life Lord Jesus Lord perhaps she's listening tonight lord I just pray God your presence will be felt among all of us in Jesus Christ's name nobody said Amen god bless you to be in-situ praise the Lord so we're thankful again by the grace of God to be here tonight like I said I'll try to set my timer I'll try to be about an hour by the grace of the Lord I try to preach that long and especially on Wednesday nights so let's look at this we're on part 12 of the Philadelphia Church age series and Malachi when you're ready you can switch over buddy I have some quotes here tonight we'd like to start with the eulogy and the promise here we like to look at this here by God's grace so we're on part 52 of the series part 12 overall these are my thoughts for the next sermon so I'm gonna skip past that those are my thoughts for the next one so our text was revelation 3:10 we're looking at the eulogy and the promise now the first thought if you haven't read the book in a while the Prophet deals with the thought of the word of my patience the word of my patience when look at that tonight so we read our text here's our text and the Prophet gets into this thoughts so he's gonna break into some thoughts on patience so I thought it'd be good tonight I think we'd be refreshed to remember how much God values patience so one look at that tonight for the first few minutes and then after that the Prophet breaks in the thoughts about the bride so he breaks into specific thoughts about the bride and I think I want to end with that by the grace of Lord if we have time now the Prophet quotes Hebrews 6 13 through 15 so notice whenever you're going to teach someone about patience or any other topic the way you do that is you use other scripture right you build scripture as isaiah said you build doctrine line upon line precept upon precept here little their little praise God so you build it that way so to understand Jesus's words of word of patience my word of patience brother Ram takes us to Hebrews six and said for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I'll multiply thee and so here's the thought that he brings out now after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise and that's the key word after let's all say after ready after after he endured he obtained because the prophets going to show us the order that God often brings his word to pass and usually it's after much trying or much patience or much waiting or much tribulation the Prophet said you see the Spirit is speaking about the word of God which is given to us to wait for the fulfillment of that word required patience how many one inherit God's promises one of the requirements is waiting in fact that's one of the most important promises one of the most important requirements is you have to wait upon the Lord don't get me wrong sure sometimes I get up here and people will put a testimony in and they'll say they'll say Oh God answered our prayer from Wednesday night and I just get excited like hallelujah I just getting surprised like mine now God could good because God can do that but many times that you notice many times the prayer request you put it they don't get answer right away maybe it'll be a month maybe to be a year six months maybe to be a year but see God does this he requires patience how many know you need more patience I know I do he said just as he did in the case of Abraham so Abraham was the father of what father of faith so he was the example he's what we should all look to for faith well the way he note we know we had faith was he kept he stayed true to God's Word hey man that's the way we know he had faith he patiently endured so the Prophet said he endured as seeing him who is invisible he was patient and then the word was finally fulfilled finally oh my when God answers prayer sometimes we can say finally thank you lord finally the prayers been answered hallelujah finally this was the way God teaches his people patience why if he fulfilled his word in physical manifestations the very instant you prayed you would never learn patience but would become even more impatient with life those are the key words were to look at we don't want to become more impatient we want to become more patient that means God is going to allow situations real desires you desire God to move in the situation but God's going to allow many of these to not happen right away so that he can build patience in your heart and in my heart as well can you imagine him every time now we got it we got it we got it we got a perversion on her phone well I need to know the weather well I need to know I need know the directions we can just say boom and there we got it in the old days you had to look up your map here to take your map with you write it down I was I was one of those when I first started driving there was no internet I to look up the maps and write down the roads and write down the routes and everything like that and we just got it now it's instant boom got it got it how do you feel when you don't get how do you feel when you're got you got no signal how do you feel what do you mean I can't call somebody you ever get that every Wednesday I Drive through this valley in Doylestown because we got to pick up milk and my signal to go out right in that Valley every week and sometimes I want to call somebody I'm like I get frustrated because I lose my signal for one minute what has this taught us to be more patient or less patient Church less patient and so see that's just a perversion now this is the perversion of what it's going to be like in the new millennium because the Bible said before we asked he'll answer amen this is a perversion of that because the Bible said before you even think it God will already send the answer to you amen that's the kind of civil a civilization we're going to praise God but see this is just a foreshadowing of it Oh now like I got this app and every time I Drive by Starbucks it pops up because I like Starbucks see it's predicting my behavior right if it predicts you like this or if you drive by a giant eagle or if you drive by whatever you like you know it'll just pop up is trying to predict what you need well that's how it's going to be like God accept times a thousand or times a million God's gonna know what we have need of even before we ask it amen he's gonna give it to us before we even ask it so see this is all foreshadowing but the natchan the natural it makes us impatient rather than patient now he says let me show you this truth even more fully set for so now the way to establish a truth further give us more word give us more scripture so that's what the Prophet done by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten Son the Prophet said there it is Abraham was tried after he received the word of promise most think that as soon as we pray in Jesus name over the good promises of God that there could not be a trial but here it says that Abraham was tried after he received the promise praise the Lord most time we think oh if you asked anything like we were praying even tonight if you ask anything in my name and I'll do it and we expect him to do it right now or where's God if he didn't answer in the last 30 years over the last 20 years we got to keep waiting on the Lord amen see the fulfillment comes after promise or after waiting promise comes first then testing and then we know fulfillment comes later we'll get to that now the Prophet now get directs us to another scripture in Psalms where it talks about Joseph until the time that his word came the word of the Lord tried him amen to see every promise that you're desiring I mean desire to see so saved I mean is hiring for more power of God more favor with God so whatever we're desiring that word has come because God knows we want to see it come to pass but it also comes to test us to see what we'll do in the midst of a test it comes to try us it comes to test us to see if we're if we really believe God or not so God gives us exceeding great and precious promises he has promised to fulfill them he will let me say it again he will if God gave any man a promise he will fulfill it but from the time we pray unto the time we get the answer he must learn to receive patients into our souls for only in patience do we possess life you know some people get I think often and I think we all we just get often discouraged with the Christian life well that we read that we read the book of Acts and alls we see as miracles but we miss all the other things in between the cracks like all the times Paul spent years in prison I often read about his him shaking off that surfer into the fire and saying I'm fine you know I got the power of God on me he gets stoned and they pick him up and they pick him up as dead but he comes back to life see we see all these supernatural things and we think my life's not like that but we fail to see all the hard times he went through in order to get that kind of faith amen remember Joseph was in prison I just read it recently the one historian said 13 years he was in prison we can't even imagine a night in prison well hopefully you can't if you did well that God will forgive you right we can't we can't imagine I can't imagine what it'd be like to lock it up to get to get pushed off in the cell and go to a hotel American prisons are called hotels I mean told me the Thailand people call American prisons hotels because they get beat in there they get starved there they you know they get mystery they get diseases they get all kinds of awful are our American system of prisons is like hotels we see we can't even we don't even know it's like to have one night in prison or two to really struggle in that type of manner see we should even we should know even if comi here tonight if even we just sit through the service and and maybe nothing supernatural is happening that we see we should know something is happening supernaturally and one thing that is supernaturally happening every service no matter no matter how we might not see it happen we are supernaturally learning to be patient amen glory and patience is one of the virtues of the statue of perfect man how many one of the how many want all the virtues flowing out through them there is no other way to get patience or to get the promise of God then patience and having to wait for it not have it but just keep believing keep waiting for it amen so I know even tonight I know something supernatural is happening what do you see brother sir you see angels no but I know they're there do you see miracles no but I see the miracle of patience happening in my life amen I'm learning to be more patient I'm just like Abraham I'm rejoicing in the promise despite not seeing the fulfillment of it I know God will keep his word amen hallelujah see that's something we have to learn that's why we have to keep coming to the house of God keep praying keep believing if we don't see it we got to be like Abraham I know we've heard this before but we've got to remember the value of it amen it's so valuable but there so this is the only way that we possess our lives is through patience the only way to really possess eternal life and the promise of God is to be patient with God that's exactly right Jesus said that we'll get to that in a minute we got all the scriptures to back this up he said may God help us to learn this lesson even as we know the people of the six Age learned patience we read the history of our of the lives of these great Christians what a contrast we see between their lives and ours for they were so patient and quiet look at this and today what are we we're all but overcoming over patience and hast got to have it now I need it now gotta have it now we're overcoming that now part of its the age we live in but part of it is if we feel that we're not overcoming like we need to so how many believe God's gonna help you overcome that we got to have something to overcome and you and I guess well you and I got to overcome Laodicea we got to overcome the most lustful age there ever was the most impatient age there ever was but guess what God chose you to overcome it God knew you'd be born in this hour you were predestinated overcome it you're gonna be more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus amen you got to learn how to be patient hallelujah amen I'm learning to be patient by the grace of the Lord hallelujah so this is the order first God gives a promise which we call a revelation or thus saith the Lord of God you say God spoke to me on Sunday brother Jesse or God spoke to me tonight God speaking to me right now that's a revelation that's at that state the Lord now in between what's next is God tests us are we really gonna believe that now you all know this in marriage so I can preach to those that I've been married we all we all receive the revelation oh this is the woman I was supposed to marry this was the man I was supposed to marry but then God let's time test us right and there's trials and well it was just the right choice and it's a test God allows tests to show what's really on inside of us and for the real believer like I was telling with that marriage counseling on Sunday I was telling them I'll tell them you've got to think about from your soul what did God what revelation do God placed in your soul don't take the thought Satan put in your mind you got to live from the inside you got to live from the seed you got to live from the word Amen you got to live from the revelation to see God tests us to go along in our marriage and we gonna let God tests us and we got to receive patience with each other and not only the natural marriage but our spiritual marriage our family of God right here we have to receive patience with one another and then after all those tests God rewards us and we inherit the promise we have to pass the test that's why there's tests at school every week I got to give tests all the time I got to see what have they learned and God is saying what have the Saints learned a bride and Christ fellowship our lives show what we're learning praise God our actions show what we've learned and we got to keep learning we got to keep passing the test amen now here's the thought though we got to remember not every promise will we receive during our lifetime let's go to Hebrews 11:13 I know Bibles we won't receive every promise we've got to be willing to go to the grave well I know God promised me all my children I've heard of some brothers say that I know God promised me the salvation of this one I know God promised me this and this and that which is fantastic but we got to be willing to even die and as our last breaths from our lips we can say thank you lord I'm going to receive the promise even if you don't see it on this side you got to have eyes of faith to see beyond this world amen and if you are a Christian you do have eyes of faith they meant you see into the other dimension you see into the unseen praise God the scene is temporal but the unseen is eternal praise God Hebrews 11 39 remember Abraham died when he died he only had a few descendants but God said your seeds gonna be like the stars of heaven do you think he died saying oh god you didn't keep your promise no he died in faith believing amen the same God that gave me Isaac the same God that gave me these seed God is gonna multiply my seat I might not see in my day but God's Word can never fail glory that's the same attitude we have to have even if I don't see even if it doesn't happen in my life even if the rapture does happen in my life even if I go to the grave I'll be in the rapture in fact our eyes first for the dead in Christ will rise first amen that's the kind of faith we got to have Hebrews 11 39 and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect amen so see they didn't get all the promises they desired in their life right what would God keep his word absolutely God was keep his word Abraham seed now is multiplying it now there's millions and now through the years there's been millions and maybe billions of Christians through the years and believers right Jews believers of all sorts but he had to pass the test the test I'm studying tonight for the test that's why you come to church that's why you read your Bible study for the test amen I don't want to fail the test I'm gonna get the test set oh I forgot to prepare I'm preparing right now praise God now remember just so this is kind of tie in Sunday night's message about we looked at Judas and the money spirit on Sunday night remember we all desire this we desire to go from faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and charity now put a little note in here Judas brother branham's had never had faith to begin with in fact the Bible proves that as we saw on Sunday night because he's as justified as already glorified so Judas could not have been justified he could not have had justification had a glorified body and then be lost and said well God I'm gonna do with that glorified body those bodies are eternal how many understand it eternal theophanies are eternal now let's build on faith little more brethren my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith works patience so remember you got to have that you got to have the revelation first you got to know God promised me God did say this in his word and I believe he spoke to me but after that then your faith has to be tried and God's got to prove to the devil that you really believe his word but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire lacking nothing we gotta let patience have her way praise God we gotta let patience work in our lives we gotta let it work out see we can't try to bring something to pass we got to let it work itself out in our life buh-bam said there's nothing greater than the power of committal and what is the power committal when you commit to God and you say if you don't I can't bring it to pass but I'm committing you to do it in your time okay that's the committal of Abraham that's the committal of every believer there's powernet because there's patience in that and patience will make you perfect amen it's exactly right now I'm going to drop back to Judas because remember this is what we need to preach and this is the hour of preaching showing truth and air praise God showing wise version versus foolish virgin versus make believer we're not going to stumble over the unbeliever we know the people in the bar we know the transgender people we know people homosexuality you know we know people like that will not inherit the kingdom of God but what's deceptive is that make-believe spirit right that Judas spirit so we have to make sure that's not on us remember remember Lot's wife if you remember Lot's wife she was on the same classification of Judas she almost was saved Judas was almost saved Lot's wife was almost saved and Jesus said remember those borderline believers now so Judas never had faith so he never got real patience now let's apply this to his money situation Judas really now he might add a good reason well maybe my family maybe my family maybe that a death in the family I gotta pay for the funeral I'm just kind of making up a story you know Nemean fact he probably had some reason why he needed money right Judas so he thought well I can just get this money here real quick I can just get a deal Jesus is supernatural they're not gonna especially not on the holiday they're not gonna kill him easy he's easy supernatural he does all these things so instead of being patient waiting for the money what he tried to do is try to get the money right now do that so you can see right now he never had faith to begin with because he didn't have patience to wait for the money whatever reason was behind his desire for money he didn't have the patience to wait for the money he thought he could get it some wrong way we must make sure we get money the right way right by keeping the Word of God amen that's right that's why my children me why don't we buy those lottery cards you know which I I mean they see people buy it at the store and I got explained to them that's not the right way to get money because you lose money most of the time and you look like a fool doing it you're scratching I'm I'm trying to get money that don't belong to me what a evil spirit that is what a greedy selfish spirit did it I'm trying to get the tax money I'm going to get these people's money why don't you work instead of why don't you spend your effort instead of trying to scratch it off won't you scratch off some dirt off the floor and sweep the floor or something like that why don't you try to make some money the honest way see it's a dishonest way to get money but Christians get money the on its way you see we got patience my employer is gonna pay me right they're gonna pay me I'm gonna work hard I'll go guys provided way it's God's provided way to salvation it's got to provide a way for money it's God's provided way for everything amen and it's got to be God's pride away for patience which is just waiting just wait because it's a test are you gonna wait in the Word of God and you wait in the fear of God as we heard the song are gonna wait we're gonna compromise like Judas you know we're gonna wait and obey or wait and compromise we must wait and obey the Word of God now here's the quote we read Sunday night as we closed the probe and saw about Judas when he was here on earth he met up with Jesus made a confession he was a believer and became the treasure pack and all the money is that right you all know that now if he believed on Jesus he accepted falsely justification he never was justified he accepted it falsely just like you see people today oh I believe in Jesus another year they're drunkards you know they're covered in tattoos or they go the way of the world they never believed in the first place now here's the core I didn't have time to show you I'm gonna show you two because I mentioned it on Sunday night I want you to know I'm saying and try and say what brother Brahim said as it lines up with the Bible Judas only played Church I'm glad I'm not playing tonight he wasn't really sincere see that see why we got to be sincere every time we come the house of God he would come to church he wasn't really sincere like I visited a couple churches lately I think I was telling some reasons on the phone I visited Iowa North Carolina I saw some people that weren't really sincere hiding over there just because they were laughing and joking while the preaching of the word is going on there the brought some of the brothers or elbowed each other saying haha look at this and that's really insincere no it's yes this respect will do it's insincere now what are they showing they show you at some point they were sincere when they come the house of God but by laughing and joking and making fun of people right in the service right in the service is the service after the Holy Ghost fell be poor weeping at the altar look how quick people can get insincere we must keep this peace with sincerity and truth the Bible says see and so Judas at some point he stopped coming to church sincere he just came because he oh he's the treasurer well Jesus called me I guess I better come if he invited me but Jesus just doesn't want you to become a part of Jesus don't wants to be a Wallflower he wants you to be somebody that's used by the Holy Spirit he wants to be a participant not an observer a participant in end want you to participate be a part of the worship feel sincere the Bible said he didn't actually have faith did actually have it so how could he ever get patience he couldn't because it's one step at a time God raises our faith one step at a time see if he would have he never would have betrayed Jesus see he sewed that seed of discrepancy he thought that he could make friends with the world ma'am and also have friendship with Jesus oh I can sell out Christ but Jesus will still forgive me see how he's planning out his life I know I'll be forgiving maybe I'll be forgiving at the end Jesus will accept me I'm he already called me I'm already a member of his church I've been going his church for two or three and a half years you know I've been get all these excuses he planned out his sin thinking that he could be forgiven of it see Christians must never plan out sin we must never willingly go into sin we've got to fight against him we better resist sin praise God we've got to be zealous against sin that we don't go into it willingly but we purposely fight against it that's right if Judas was to see the enemy and the discrepancy it also became flesh and dwelt among us and the person of judas iscariot he never had no real real faith he had what he thought was a faith and how do you know how do you know you have real faith it's really simple you pass the word test whatever the word says you do it praise God that pretty easy see Judas had the word he knew the word he just didn't keep the word we must keep the word and we must be sincere with the word of God see Baretta there's such a thing as having faith and a make-believe faith Judas had a make-believe faith genuine faith of God will believe in God and God is the word it'll never add nothing to it the Bible tells us if we add one word or take one word away our part will be taken from the book of life he says that revelation 22:18 the last closing chapter amen oh this Gospels so simple it's so simple it's the highways the way of holiness and a fool will not air on this one highway amen you can't you can't make it air you if you're in Christ you're gonna pass every test because you're gonna keep the word every step of the way and that what is that genuine faith genuine faith genuine faith I'll just wait on the promise of God I was tempted for this I'm tempted for that tempted for that but I'm gonna deny all of it I'm just gonna wait on the will of God I'm gonna learn patience and God will answer His Word in time amen it's exactly right it's not the easiest thing it's actually the hardest thing to do the heart that's what Judas couldn't do he couldn't wait on God he couldn't be patient and remember every time we get impatient something bad happens remember David got impatient oh I'll just go up I'll make my own cart and what happened brother have said that honest man named use iodide and mother and even said an honest good-hearted man he was his heart was so good he wanted to catch the ark before it hit the ground and God I'm not an honest good-hearted seemingly innocent man but he broke the word and God was trying to teach David a lesson you don't do anything until it's all in the word the right way amen in church the bride knows what God wants done with the word and we must wait till we have the word until we do what we're called to do that's exactly right now here's the scripture Jesus talking about is Luke 21 he's talking about the end times and ye shall betray both my parents brethren kins folks friends think about that Peter James John Bartholomew Thaddeus they all got betrayed by parents brethren kins folk friends and some of you shall they cause put to death your own family your own friends he should be hate of all men for my name's sake but there shall not inherit perish now look he just said they're gonna be put to death but he said your hair's not gonna perish what does that mean it's that story that brother Bram said but the man told his wife and said he said or she remember he told her he said I turned to think of the story now he said he said I never lost one of my hairs he and she said pray tell me where they are brother Graham said wherever they were before I got them that's where they are right now what does this mean this is speaking to not one hair of your head will perish because God is going to restore your physical body he's going to bring it back he's going to put the treasure body with a theophany with the glorified all into one body amen and now one of those atoms not one of those cells would be lost God will bring every one of them back you'll look just exactly like he went you were 20 years old that's how you look in the heavenly City ain't him that's unfortunate for me because I don't like how I look when I was 20 but either way either way Jesus said not one of those hairs will parents God knows where every one of those atoms are every one of those cells are God's a God of restoration amen and so he says this you might die but you won't lose one of those hairs I'm gonna bring them back to you Oh precious is the flow that makes us white as snow no other fount I know nothing but the blood of Jesus it makes us so clean it makes us so protected by God he promises to protect every hair on our heads amen and then Jesus says after all this I've knowing you're gonna die you're gonna be betrayed by all your family and friends you're gonna be mystery to all these things he said but in your patience your patience see it has to come from God to you see it has to be from God's faith - now it's my faith in other words it has to go from brother branham's faith - now it's my faith well brother brandon has testimony how about you how about me brother branham had faith that nobody ever had faith do I have faith brother Branham had patience he could wait to got healed you know when he was in 1965 of his stomach condition he could wait till he got healed can you wait till you get here absolutely see it's got to be your patient see if it got to become your testimony it's got to be coming your thing it's got to be coming your power aren't you glad that you possess the promise of God it's my testimony it's God it's my faith that God has given to me by His grace you understand what I'm saying God has given you and I a testimony it's got to be ours see in your patience he said in your patience possess your souls now in the Hebrew down here possess means to get you get your soul in your patience you get your soul you obtain it you possess it it's like marrying a wife to see in your and your patients that's when you actually possess the eternal life is what I'm saying in patience you possess eternal life so patience helps us acquire eternal life you will not get eternal life without having patience can you say Amen that's absolutely scriptural Hebrews 6 11 and we designed that every one of you to show the same diligence that's effort remember human effort interest we must give interest in the to the full assurance of the hoped unto the end that you be not slothful we can't be lazy but followers them who through faith and patience inherit the promises so see real faith is assurance and a full diligence or a full interest in the promise of God brings us to the full assurance of our hope eternal life we've got to be fully interested fully diligent fully devoted to the promise of God and then we obtain eternal life we inherit the promises and now we already read this one but I had it later in this and the in the sermon but I just jumped ahead to it cuz I wanted you to see that there are promises we won't on here until we get over there in the other land praise God heaven hey man paradise now I just want to bring these quotes back up from a statute perfect man how many enjoy that message oh my brother Brooks was preaching on that at his church and kind of stir me up a little bit he remember said if you've got faith it works patience the Bible said see so this is patience now that's the next thing there is going to build this stature you know God has got real material in this building see there's a real patience and there's a make-believe patience but God's got real patience see how short we are brother sister see see why where we're at yes sir he said we have glory shouts and things because we got faith but when we come down to these things here God can't build us into that stature see he can't he can't make us up to that kind of a place we got he said we got all these other things we fall slide off with it see he can't build his church so see he's saying like we have we could have rejoicing in emotional times but we got to have these virtues like patience we gotta have a virtue like godliness we got a virtue liked temperance we got have self-control now I love this patience with what what kind of patience do we have the first thing is patience with God that's the very first thing we have to have patience with with God we could say well I just wish I was more patient with my children I wish I was more patient with my wife or my co-worker well the first thing you need is to be patient with God because God has your soul in his hand right he's controlling all the situations he's orchestrating your life as sovereignly in his hand he lets happen to your life what he wants to happen in your life and we must have patience with God God allowed my wife to act like this or God allowed my husband act like this or God allowed this in my life we must be patient with God we must look beyond the flesh and look to the spiritual realm first thing is have patience with God if you've got real genuine faith you'll have real patience because faith works patience or faith produces patience when God says anything you believe it that's all you got patience say well I asked for him healing last night to heal me and I'm just the sick this morning I said oh my what patience is that don't we act like that sometimes I've had that many times I've been sick late at night I've had fevers over the years and sometimes I get discouraged like I'll go all the night with a fever I can't sleep and I'll be like where's my faith where's my faith and sometimes I think of this quote where's my faith why did it happen right now I want to right now order right now I guess I don't have faith I guess in on faith and the whole time you might have genuine faith God's just not gonna answer right then he wants you to be patient for it think about that with Abraham anytime during that 25 years did he become a sinner and not have faith anymore no he was a certainty was a believer for the whole time he said believers the whole time he had a few stumbles but what happens when a man's thumb was a real Christian he just gets back up he just says up brush it off she made him a little mistake there I'm still on the road I'm selling the way to I'm still on the Kayden's land Amen I'm walking the cane as then I still know where I'm going I just got to get clean off a little bit praise the Lord I got my garments white again praise God gotta wash him in the blood of Jesus again see God told Abraham 25 years later there wasn't even one sign he was still believing he was patient with God uh-huh there wasn't even one side and then brother Branham jumps that Noah about patience Noah had patience yeah real godly patience God says I'm gonna destroy this world with rain and Noah preached 120 years yet I've been preaching on the rapture by the Amen for 13 years and I haven't seen one person have a body change yet I don't have one speck of evidence that the rapture is gonna happen in my lifetime but guess what I'm still preaching it I've only been preaching 13 years on the rapture he preached a 120 years on a flood and it came to pass how do we know the rapture is gonna happen because it's dust saith the Lord God said so so I just like know I've got a void all the scoffers I got a void all the naysayers I got to avoid all the people that fall away and we just got to believe God is going to rapture a bride off this earth they're gonna change in the moment tweak of an eye and I just got enough faith and patience to believe I'm one of them ain't ahead hallelujah I'll just keep building I'll keep pounding away I'll just keep getting this Ark ready I'll just keep trying to get everybody in this arc that I know amen because this heart today is not a ship this Ark is Christ amen look plenty of patience well Jesse I could I can only wait ten more years for the rapture after that I don't know if I could wait I could wait about a hundred more years I could wait another lifetime for the rapture why because I've got plenty of patience so do you you do if you waited this long I can wait a little longer God's doing something supernatural in my life he's teaching me to wait on him it's something supernatural you can't see it other than the fact that I'm staying faithful to Christ amen show me America do a miracle tonight God in God saying I am I'm gonna teach you patience tonight I'm gonna do something so supernatural tonight I'm gonna help Lydia be more patient I don't know Jessie have more patients to wait for the rapture see we think we think oh oh we've been the message these are yours where's the rapture but RAM said it won't be one second late he said Jesus will not be one second late Jesus just waiting there the Bible said he's waiting there he said only the Father Knows only that invisible spirit knows when he's gonna whisper and a Jesus here and say it's time blow the trumpet and when Jesus gets ready to blow that trumpet when to save your calls there be someone I'll be somewhere listen for my name hallelujah perhaps your time and the trumpet blows like I don't know how to do a trumpet go ho ho I'll be listening maybe between 6:00 and 9:00 in the morning but I don't know about you but I got plenty of patience for it I'll keep waiting on it because I'm just like Noah I'm a preacher of righteousness a name we must live our righteous holy life now look he weighed 120 years not even do fell from heaven there wasn't even one sign that there was going to be rain but what did God give him God gave him patience that's what preachers need patience that's what everybody needs patience I said the laity needs patience just as dusty as it ever was for a hundred and twenty years he but he was patient then God tries your patience that's right God tries them see Satan said Oh Noah don't believe he went to preach he would not even preach a hundred years on the and gods like watch him Pisa that's my son watch him oh that Bride of Christ fellowship they could never wait 15 years for the rapture our church is only 11 years old oh they could never wait 20 years they could never wait 30 years God says watch them no matter what devices they bring out the Google glasses next or the Holograms or whatever whatever they bring our next we're not gonna let these things distract us from the Word of God we're gonna stay faithful to thus saith the Lord the Bible said we know Satan's devices we are aware of Satan devices we know what he's trying to do he's trying to deceive people into sin and unrighteousness and unholy living but we know we fear God we cast out all sin we cast out anything that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and we're zealous to be overcomers amen it's exactly right hallelujah how much patience you got brother Jess just plenty I got plenty I got patience like a river I got patience like Noah I've got patience like 120 years of preaching praise God and he did that without the baptism of the Holy Ghost how much could we do with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said Christ goes on to say because you've kept my word and lived it and thereby become patient I will keep you from the hour temptation see we are so blessed just because we're patient we don't try to rush out and do something we all know people that are rush down their lives made harsh decisions you know maybe in relationships or finances or other things they just make these harsh decisions and they suffer the consequences more right but God said because you're patient I'm going to keep you from the laying down of the mark of the beast that's what the Bible says the hour temptation that comes upon the whole world is the mark of the beast because we're patient with God's Word we won't have to decide ah should I do this should I sell out or not you have to we're gonna lose all my money in the bank account or we're gonna lose our church building we wanted to go through that he's gonna keep us from the hour of temptation that's the Word of God now here again we see the overlapping of these two ages for this promise has to do with the end of the Gentile period which culminates in the Great Tribulation all right I got 18 minutes here let me see now I'll preach on this numerous times over the years I presume this probably three or four times he talks about the our patience let me just go through quickly I will keep you from the hour of temptation which you come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth the Prophet said this is not a declaration that the true church will go into and through the tribulation if it meant that it would have said that but it said I will keep thee from the hour temptation this temptation is exactly like the temptation Eden it will be very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to God's command and word and yet from the standpoint of human reasoning it will be so very right so enlightening and life-giving as to food the world now here's I want to bring this to you you know what the Bible said the Bible said we're waiting for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead even Jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come we are delivered from the wrath to come because we believe in Jesus Christ the wrath is going to start with the laying down of the mark of the beast once that mark is laid out the two prophets are going to start calling and the seven trumpets they're gonna start calling the seven trumpets it's gonna be a complete interruption of nature but it starts with the laying down of the mark of the beast but we are promised he's kept us from the wrath that is to come this is the rapture Scripture brother BAM used when he preached the rapture in December 1965 one thing I desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall let me be purged in the tribulation no sir for the time of trouble he shall hide me in his house his pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall you hide me he shall set me up Epona rock that rock is so hot it's a rock that's in the air because the meeting is in the air praise God it's not a natural Rock it's a heavenly rock and that rock is Christ amen that's the rock he sets me up on now remember the bro my wife is not mentioned in the tribulation text of all revelations you read it read it some done the bride is not mentioned in chapter 8 not mention in chapter 9 now she's mentioned in chapter 10 because she's John she takes the book and prophesized before all nations so the bride is mentioned in chapter 10 I know there's a core program said she's not seen from chapter 4 all the way to 19 but you have to balance out quotes church never understand you got to take every quote back to the word because the bride is in Revelation chapter 10 brother Branham is in Revelation chapter 10 and is he bride or not I'm here you see you see out there Bayless every quote we got to be real careful with the quotes not to make every one that saith the Lord because that's idolatry revelation 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 the bride is not mentioned in any of those chapters because those are all tribulation chapters only the Avera lacked will not be fooled by the mark of the beast the temptation will come as files I've always loved those words the temptation will come as files we're told exactly how it's going to come we know exactly how the mark of the beast is going to come we don't have to guess we know exactly how it's gonna happen the ecumenical move that's all the churches grew joining together that it started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling Christ prayer that we all might be one become so strong politically so in other words the churches are going to be backing up the government so you watch Trump right you watch the next president of God Terry's you watch they're going to become buddy-buddy the church is now the denominational churches the false churches are going to become buddy-buddy with the government this is how it has to come it has to come this way because the church will bear pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence the principles and act in the law that no people we recognize as actual churches unless under direct or indirect domination of this council so see it has to come that way it has to become the church's putting pressure upon the government and the government taking heat of that pressure to lay down the law where you can't buy or sell without the mark of the beast so we know who are enemies are our enemies are actually the false churches it's Satan in the false churches that's who our enemies are but have said that he said your worst enemy is Rome he said though because Rome his memory Rome is at the bottom of the image the great image that Daniel saw Rome was at the bottom she's ayran they were understand that's the greatest enemy is that iron church the Roman Catholic Church she's the greatest enemy she don't look like her right now cuz brother BAM said member her powers waning but she's gonna get it back she's gonna get it back right here when she calls in the bonds and forces a force to the gold standard again oh my little groups will lose Chartres privileges cetera until they lose all property and spiritual rights with the people for example right now unless the local Ministerial Association approves and many if not most cities one cannot rent a building for religious services to become chaplains in the armed services hospitals etc is now almost mandatory to be recognized as acceptable to the trinitarian economical groups as this pressure increases and it will it will be harder to resist for it to resistance to lose privilege and so many will be tempted to go along for they fear it is better to serve God publicly in the framework of this organization than not to serve God at all publicly but they air to believe the devil's lies to serve Satan even though you may want to call Joe Houma but the elect will not to be deceived Amen that's how it's going to come the churches are gonna put so much pressure that on Trump or whoever the next president is Oprah like we saw this week whoever the next president is it doesn't matter the church is going to get so in in cahoots with the government that they're gonna convince the government to lay down the mark you can't be a real Church you lose all privileges unless you agree to our doctrine and our standards that's how it's going to come it has to come that way furthermore the elect will not only be kept but as this move becomes the image directed to the Beast the Saints will be gone in the rapture amen Lori see we won't see it actually become that won't see its work its way into it we won't actually see that because memory that can't happen until Satan comes down and saying can't come down all the way to the bride goes up right because the Bible second Thessalonians 2 only he will let until be until he be taken out of the way and then that unholy one that Antichrist will be revealed the Bible says he can't be revealed until he the Holy Ghost in the church should be taken away that's right that's the scripture and this little delightful winsome movement that started out in the fellowship at Ephesus will become the monster of Satan that defiles and deceives the whole world for the church system of the Roman Catholic in the process is coming together will control the whole wealth of the world system and force the whole earth into its religious trap or will kill them by refusing them the privilege of buying or selling whereby they would make a living how many people do you know if raise your hands well how many people would say if they said oh you believe Baptist you don't believe in the Trinity you're gonna lose your job Hardy people would say ok I'll find another job or they said mr. Smith you have to teach homosexuality is OK would I be willing to say ok where do I sign to leave where's the door I really have to ask where is the door I don't know where the door is but would we do we have that kind of faith right now where we could walk away and say fine I'll leave it I'll have to put my hands in God I have to have a little patience in God after that God exercised some patience in me we got to be willing to do that I've often thought about that in California they you know they have curriculums where or I've heard about at least I haven't seen it but everything starts west and heads east at least in this nation they have curriculums where preschools are teaching it's ok to have two dads ok to have two moms and that ever comes here and I'm forced to preach it I got to make a decision and I'll have to I'll just say sorry Copley I'm taking the way with the Lords of spies whew yeah this you have to do that you have to either take God or take the enemy yeah you have to make a choice this will be accomplished simply for the harlots daughters are all but gone back to her we've seen that remember that video few years ago what's that guy's name that famous preacher real rich guy can't think his name I can't think of him but he was saying he was saying the Reformation is over remember that a few years ago the Reformation is over in other words I'm sorry that the Protestant move is over there's no more protesting the Pope we all believe justification is by faith and not by works what's that guy's name no he's friends with him though that's a good guess it's an older guy I officer texted to you it's the guy this guy who speaks in tongues a lot but it never gets any interpretation ah okay members name he has his own private jet camp members named Kenneth Copeland that's it right there thank you sister its Kenneth Copeland now I hate to call names but you understand I'm not I'm just saying they're off Kenneth Copeland went up before all his congregation and said the Reformation is over there's no more protesting he in other words he's saying our Catholic friends are our brothers we can't say that because they are under idolatry woman worship there know all these things we can't say they're not our brothers will we pray for them sure brother Branham prayed for Catholics can some of them be saved yes but they've got to come out of that system you cannot believe you cannot be an eye doctor and be saved praise God you cannot be possessed of a cage of unclean and hateful bird and be saved the call is to come out of her my people that's the call you've got to come out revelation 18:4 but he's already announced that that was a couple years ago it's thick it's trickling down of course you see another denominations now we've seen Joel Olsteen since that we called the name we've seen him on interviews he says I will not preach against homosexuality because I don't want to lose peopIe don't want to offend people hurt people he said I would gladly attend a homosexual marriage see a true man of God will not bless sin a true man of God will not will not make a license for immorality for a true man of God will rebuke sin but we're not being judgmental but we're just saying I'm not I don't know where they're gonna end that's being judgmental I don't know if they're going to heaven or hell I'm not the judge I'm not being judgmental but I am judging their words I am judging doctrine because it's false and that's what I'm called to do amen rightly divide the word of truth the Bible said I'm called to judge their false doctrine now their souls I'm not called to judge that that's between them and God now here's where he said in the meantime Roma is acquired nearly all the supplies of gold the Jews have the bonds and all the paper at the right time the harlot the Roman Catholic Church will destroy the present-day money system by calling in all the paper and demanding gold with no gold the system Falls the Jews will be trapped and come into the Lions and the harlot Church will take over the whole world aren't you glad you know what's gonna happen in the future aren't you glad we know it's gonna happen and it all lines up with revelation 13 Yusef 3 DREV elation 13 it all lines up there how it all comes down now let's finish with this here I got I got seven more minutes on my watch let's finish that I appreciate our see hours aren't that long is it not that long did you learn patience in this hour sure you did it was worth coming tonight whether you've heard all this before you know all this is it's not how much we know it's how much we're living varies god it's how close we're living to Christ now went over this briefly earlier in the series but let's just go over it again oh we have a word first all at this time it is hold fast persevere don't give up put on the whole armor of God use every weapon he's given us use every gift at our disposal look ahead with joy because we were going to be crowned by him who's King and kings and Lord of lords now he is not only giving crowns but he says that these in the bride will be made pillars in the temple of God but what is the temple what is the temple of God Jesus spoke of his body as being the temple it was it was the temple of God but now that we are his body the true church is the temple of God by the Holy Ghost within us now he is going to make the overcomer a pillar in that temple but what is a pillar a pillar is actually part of the foundation for it holds up the superstructure praise God that puts the overcomer right in there with the apostles and prophets for it says in Ephesians 2:19 2:22 let's read that Asians to 19 and 22 I'm gonna go there in my on my iPad Asians to 1922 I preached on this a couple months ago now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone you see we're built upon them see Paul was our foundation but I'm on I'm a little higher up there I lived a little later than Paul I'm not better than him but he's my foundation praise God and I'm on top of him I'm built upon him I'm built upon his preaching I preached the same thing he preaches amen hallelujah in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple the Lord in whom also ye are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit amen we are God's house we are God's dwelling place don't you feel that as many times I walk into church I can just feel the presence of God already here do you ever feel that the sweetness of the Holy Spirit why because we are the habitation of God we should expect to feel God's presence here amen we should expect it we are his habitation yes that verse 22 says that we are builded together with them everything went through the door Jesus and as part of the body or temple now when God puts a man the temple as a pillar and makes him a part of that foundation group what is he doing he's giving him the revelation of the word and of himself because that is exactly what the apostles and prophets had Matthew 16:17 there he is in that word there he stands no one can get him out hey man now ponder that word over cometh John asks the question who is he that overcometh and the answer comes right back he that believed Jesus is the Christ he doesn't say that the overcomers the one that believes in a jesus and an a Christ but believes that Jesus is the Christ one person not two he is the one who is baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen all right I got three minutes all right let me finish this God is talking about the bride here do you want to see another picture of her it is over revelation 7 4 to 17 now put two notes on here I may spend just a whole sermon on this so in the church age book member brother Branham I read an article that said brother Branham write over this book 15 times before he printed it 15 times so in this book the Prophet said revelation 7 4 to 17 is the bride let's read it revelation 7 for now I've had numerous ministers over the years talked to me about this and some of it's always ended well but some of them got kind of upset when we talked about it because I believe revelation 7 4 to 17 is the bride they believed it was the foolish virgin and so church it's really nothing get upset about we're splitting my were splitting hairs here is this a doctor that pertains to salvation absolutely not that's why it kind of hurts when people get upset over little things like this we can't get upset over little things we got to have patience with each other we got have you gotta have patience right we can't get impatient say you don't believe it the way I do you're wrong I'd fight you if I could but God won't let me see that's the wrong attitude there you know you don't want to fight Matt it's you know in a fighting spirit you want to fight the devil you want to fight God's family revelation 7 for now verses we're gonna skip 4 to 8 because you can read it those are the chose 144,000 Jews 12,000 from every tribe now verse 9 to 17 is the bride brother bran tells us now I have three times he calls to the bride one time he calls it foolish virgin so I just believe it's the bride let's just read it after this I beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all nations so it has to be Gentiles so it's either Gentile foolish version or Gentile wise version it's not just Jews it's all nations and Kindred's and people and tongues stood before the throne now this is important they stood before the throne remember the New Jerusalem has no throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in her hands and cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb and the Angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces and worshipped God now Church if we can't humble ourselves on this side how are we gonna make it to that side if we can't sometimes get on our face and home and your prayer closet if you can't get on your face and crowd to God how you gonna make it to heaven because there's people there that are on their faces crying out to God praising God they're so humble they fall on their faces before God how much humbler should we be Church we should have the fear of the Lord see these people had the fear Lord because they're in the presence of the Lord but we should have it here because we should feel his presence here look look how much humility there is in heaven we must be more humble verse 12 saying Amen blessing in glory and honor and Thanksgiving and honour and power might be unto our God for ever and ever amen and one of the elders answered said to me what are these which are way too right robes and whence came they and I said to him Sir thou knowest so he didn't know he said the angel asked him he says I don't know do you know do you know and he said to me these are they which came out of Great Tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb now see most people look at that and say oh there was Great Tribulation it has to be the Great Tribulation Period but three times real ramsett was the bride one time he says it was a foolish virgin I just want to read you the quotes either way these are blessed people how many can say amen to that either way they're blessed people to stand before the lamb with palms and their hands praising some of them are on their faces they're falling down praising God a multitude can you imagine a multitude all shouting and praising God if there could be chose up our spines there there will be I don't know if there will be praise God he's about perfect bodies but just the the atmosphere there will be beyond belief amen hallelujah he says therefore are they before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in the temple now Birmingham says he serve he said that's who serves them who serves the husband but the wife who makes my meals every day my precious wife she serves me every day day and night she serves me she serves me when my children get sick I get the lay in bed she has to get up and serve me you know unfortunately you know I know it's not it was not always easy for the wife but she serves me when I'm saying it she serves me day and night and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them they shall hunger no more neither shall thirst any more neither shall the Sun light on them nor any heat for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living living fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes now did you notice Church in verse 16 the Sun is still shining did you notice that so this cannot be the New Jerusalem because in the New Jerusalem there's no more Sun right we've been Hosea I've been talking about that so that's why I'm looking at it we've been talking other there's no Sun in the New Jerusalem so this has to be before the new heavens and new earth that means this has to be before the white throne judgment and that means this has to be probably in the Millennium or the marriage supper of the Lamb and by the RAM said the foolish version does not have a part at the marriage supper of lamb or the Millennium that's why I believe this cannot be the foolish version but the RAM said worst yet he said she's in the grave the first version is in the grave and I don't know what that means but if she don't have the Holy Ghost while she's on earth she will not be at the marriage supper she will not be in the Millennium because it's only for those who overcome and she did not overcome and get born again oh how we need to get born again praise God how we need to know that we're born again because we're overcomers now here's the here's here's brother hams comment to the church age book now I went over an hour there's my timer let me give give me five more minutes Jesus has come he has sealed 144,000 he's taken $12 on each tribe but there's another group that doesn't belong in this hundred forty four thousand seen in verses nine eighteen who are they these are in the bride taken from amongst the Gentiles they are before his throne day and night they serve Him in the temple they are the special care of the Lord they are his bride the bride goes member the bridegroom is she will never be left by him she will never leave his side she will share the throne with him she will be crowned with his glory and honor now the only quote brother have said foolish virgin is in the seventh seal and so the brothers had contacted me they kind of got upset said how can you believe that brother man said the seven seals were the most inspired sermons ever preached that might be true but brother Ham still made mistakes in the seven seals remember he said there only be seven hundred instead of seven thousand member he kept saying that over and over and they kept asking him as their 700 or seven thousand seven hundred he made mistakes not every word was thus saith the Lord but every revelation from God was thus saith the Lord just like in the marriage and divorce brother BAM said it was the state Lord from beginning to end oh no he said all the way through but he made mistakes in marriage and divorce he said Jacob had it more than a dozen wives but Jacob only had four wives you could prove that by the Bible so brother Aaron doesn't mean every word all the way through he means every revelation all the way through because you can't say all the way through and make a mistake you can't say that so he means all the revelations all the way through our thus saith the Lord so you gotta be careful how you interpret the stay at the Lord as well so this is the seventh seal he says now here was the purposes the first thing was that sleep inversion had to go through the tribulation period for purification she had to be purged of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message this she was done in the tribulation period we see they wind up over here in Revelation 7 between the 6th and 7th chapter here that she has been purged and she'd been given her robes that's the only quote where brother Branham says this is the foolish version I already read you one in the church book here's the second one this is from questions and answer 64 and this was in what month was it okay August so this is a year and five months after he preached the seventh seal brother Branham says it's the wise virgin will the prophet of Malachi 4 be the one that called the Gentile remnant of revelation 7:9 even though they go through the Tribulation Period no after revelation 7 is where we've seen the 144,000 sealed and after that he saw coming up coming back was that great number which no man could number which was the bride Malachi 4 would be finished and bride be taken up and then this group of Elijah and Elijah return back to the earth the church to go through the tribulation period but Elijah Elijah will not have anything to do with the sleeping virgin there they'll only be sent to the Jews so there's the second quote there's two quotes the brother Graham said it's the bride the last one let's send our feet out cuz I gotta close this is from okay this is from 1960 this is from the church age series this is one I heard last week when I was listening to the sermon he said there's 144,000 now if you want to see the bride come up after that to show that the hundred forty-four thousand is not the bride just continue to read on down now he says I mean from the seventh he said I mean from the seventh chapter let's serve the ninth verse and he reads on down he says what does your wife do she serves you in the house you sit down she gives you your food she fixes your clothing see she serves you day and night in your house see and this one these of all nations and Gentiles which is the bride and before the throne of God with him day and night I'll remember what we said last night and we walked on it that's why we talked on it everybody loved the Lord tonight praise the Lord let's close with that by God's grace the Bible said there before him before the throne of God they serve Him day and night in his temple he that sitteth on the throne should dwell among them they shall hunger no more thirst no more no sunlight will be on them nor any Heat for the land which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes amen what a promise we have Church can we even begin to imagine this blessing no we can't I you know often when I pray here at the church I imagine Jesus he's got his white wig on he's got his white robe and he's sitting on his throne can we imagine standing before his throne and never leave his side day and night can you imagine that there is going to be a people from Laodicea that will live lives that are worthy the gospel that will stand before Christ day and night in his temple a church if you and I have patience we can be one of them hey that we can just wait a little longer on God don't give up in patience you possess your salvation in patience you
