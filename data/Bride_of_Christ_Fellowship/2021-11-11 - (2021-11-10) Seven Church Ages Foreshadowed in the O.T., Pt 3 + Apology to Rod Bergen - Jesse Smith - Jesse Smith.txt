end amen now let's go to psalm 103 some 103 2 and 3. we ought to be so thankful we have a lord who gives us daily benefits for giving all of our sins notice that all thine iniquities iniquities when you know it's wrong you do it anyway he forgives all the things that we purposely do wrong and he heals all our diseases what a savior let's read verses two and three ready one two three bless the

glorified and magnified in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god i do have some slides here [Music] i kind of have something to uh just say publicly here since it's on live stream you know after uh that debate in 2020 with believe the sign um i preached on the debate and uh i said a few things wrong i think there's just one thing wrong that i said i shouldn't say a few i think there's one thing wrong i said so i'm going to issue a public apology to brother rod when i preached it here i said that he believed it was acceptable for homosexuality and other abominations and apparently he didn't believe that so i misunderstood that so if i say something publicly that's wrong i'm gonna apologize so my my precious brother rod uh please forgive me that's the one mistake i i've come to know that i'm wrong on and uh i hope you accept my apology sir so uh thank you for that uh church you know if i say something wrong publicly i like to correct it publicly now there was numerous things you know that the other side i'm not going to say that man's name but there's numerous things the other side have said wrong about me i haven't reached out to them yet but i will i have a list of nine things they've said wrong about me so i hope i get apology back if not the love of jesus christ covers over all that so i just want to issue that apology there publicly and i'll make sure i share this with our brother rod also uh church uh you know i just want to now kind of go into a little bit of a uh i guess you'd say battle mode with that other side because there's still a battle going on and i say that with kindness it's come to my attention of course and i knew this but uh come to my attention that uh there's at least one person probably more watches all of our sermons just to find things that i say about uh the side that i debated the people that i call them accusers of brother branham because they're accusing him uh falsely in my opinion and they would probably call me the same thing i'm accusing them or something so uh but that one's have to agree to disagree on those anyways uh to the and i'm just gonna call them spies because that's what i feel like the bible calls them to the man who's watching as a spy uh just know that i prayed for you today and i hope you get saved if you're not saved and if you're not sanctified i hope you get sanctified by the holy ghost and i hope you get filled with the baptism of the holy ghost and i would just say to this gentleman eventually get to at the end of the sermon but i hope sir that you will reach out to me and contact me if you have any questions please don't be afraid to do that i'm a very gentle person a very friendly person and so please reach out to me please don't go to other people if you have concerns about me please come to me there's nothing to be afraid of uh we can talk to it we can talk about it like gentlemen but keep listening sir and if he's not like i hope like i said if he's not saved i hope he gets saved during the sermon by god's grace so praise the lord the bible calls them spies when they uh they come in amongst you and try to uh find fault with you so uh now one thing's for sure church i'm a i'm a human so if they look long enough they're gonna find a fault with me but i wish if they'd find it they'd come talk to me about it that's what i did recently remember there was a sermon i listened to at a certain church i found at least 24 24 heirs in that i went to the pastor about the heirs and then i went to the preacher the guest preacher who preached it and that's what we should do jesus said if somebody offends you you go to them so to this dear man watching if he's still watching maybe to turn it off i don't know but if he's watching if you have left a message and you think you have more love and you're more free than ever before then please follow the words of jesus christ and come talk to me i'll be happy to come talk to you on the phone i'll be happy to talk to you in the email or text so thank you now i wanna uh with that said thank you church you know some of these things are public so i have to if i make a public mistake i just need to publicly apologize and i always want to be that way i never want to get to the spot where uh i can't humble myself and say i'm sorry if i make a mistake now church that's just a review remember church we were looking at the last three sermons is that we can see in the old testament a rise and fall of spirituality in the old testament kings of israel we see a great rising and falling just like we do in the church ages praise god in the in the church ages you know we see how how god started with a one person god right but then in the in the in the second church age the third church age they adopted a trinity we can already see how the church is starting to fall away from many uh some of the truths um and then as it goes on you know more and more teachings are are lost and then the the third tier in age you know it was only columba and his uh missionary friends i shouldn't say only it was very few uh believers actually in this about it's almost a thousand years it's like satan's millennium right of church ages but then martin luther started restoring justification praise god and of course we know he was born again yet have the baptism of the holy ghost to be a fire in the hand of jesus but his main message was justification and then god started restoring holiness you know through john wesley and then through brother branham's message he finished the mystery of god and turned was able to turn our hearts back to the apostolic fathers where now we don't have creeds like martin luther we don't have creeds like john wesley now we have bible faith praise god and our hearts are turned back to the bible praise god and so as we saw we saw a lot of rising and falling solomon rose but then he fell a few kings later jehoshaphat restored him back right but then a few generations go by a few bad kings they fall again god raises up a usaid who gives at least 50 years of ministry right uh integrity walking before the lord well he fought after his generation he fell away at the end of his life but of course he was saved we believe a couple of kings bad kings and then god raised up by hezekiah amen after him though some sinners come in right they're not godly kings then god has to do another revival josiah praise god more generations come and go and god has to send them back the yeah actually a few generations after josiah they leave the promised land god scatters them and then god has to send them back through zerubbabel ezra and nehemiah praise god and then they're there for 400 years without a prophet until god raises up john the baptist can i say that this the greatest man in the old testament you say brother jess that's a strange statement that's what jesus said he said he said john is the greatest one that's risen out of all men to this point he said but i say unto you those in the kingdom of god are greater than john the baptist because it's a testimony of the blood of jesus christ amen it magnifies the blood of jesus christ hallelujah and so i hope church you can see that there was a great rising farm remember there's a great missionary age in the days of john wesley that hasn't been accomplished to this day it was the greatest open door age there had ever been praise god the most number of missionaries the greatest number of miles traveled and the greatest number of souls say that man age of wesley's age so we can see that how many can see some trends here by god's grace i think i think it's without a doubt i can see at least four messengers that are clearly tight i'm sorry that are types of the anti-type that came later in the church ages praise god now we left off on sunday the first service with the laodicean church age all right so uh our we know the messenger was brother branham no doubt 1909 to 1965. his message was zealous repentance and it uh and the message was to it was to produce a hot experience that overcomes lukewarmness lukewarmness is sometimes hot sometimes cold in other words uh anointed prayer services and then the depths of sin right cuss and swear and drunkenness idolatry perversion you know great anointing shouting singing and then other sexual sin we'll say like that you know just other sins you know just wickedness you know uh you can just name whatever you want you know but that's what lukewarm is it's back and forth right back and forth but the bible jesus says that a believer abides in christ you must abide in the word praise god and then when you abide in the word he said ask that you will and it'll be done praise god now it's not that we order god around but god is more likely to hear our prayers when we're abiding in the word of god amen now the type of this was john the baptist he came at a very lukewarm time a very cold time where they hadn't had a prophet for 400 years right his ministry was only six months i love that quote by the man says he said sometimes god will train a man for years just to get six months of ministry out of him hallelujah church don't be discouraged sometimes god will tell you for years just to use you for a few months praise god don't ever let that be a small thing it was a great thing remember nobody was greater than john the baptist before him because everybody else just talked about jesus but john the baptist baptized jesus amen he handled jesus amen i don't know you tweeted the people there he is the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world and he could point off himself and point to the reality it wasn't a partial realization it was a perfect realization amen everybody else was just you know partially painting and types but john the baptist pointed to the perfect realization he pointed to the word made flesh and his message was turning the hearts of the fathers to the children and that's what john the baptist did he said behold the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world follow ye him amen so we can clearly see church that there's a great correlation here and both men have the spirit of elijah now let me read a few pages here from my book i was actually looking at it this morning i'm almost done with the audio book hopefully i'll be done by saturday but let's look at some of the similarities if you don't quite remember i think it's good to review these here 762. it's always good to talk about the things of the lord how is john the baptist like brother branham or vice versa both all the elijah spoke with thus saith the lord uh elijah said thus saith the lord he prophesied of haziah's demise in second kings 1 verses 1 to 18. john the baptist the word of the lord came to john the baptist in the wilderness whereby he foretold jesus would take away the sins of the world and baptize with the holy ghost amen did you know that judge john the baptist prophesied about the day of pentecost amen he prophesied about it and it happened because he had the word of the lord and there's 30 times in this book that i showed brother branham spoke with blessed alone there's at least 30 thus saith the lords in this book some of the most impressive ones were the time he he spoke thus saith the lord a sister would die a sister should care and that was just like a hazard i can never say that name a haziah's demise both men spoke thus said the lord a person would die now of course remember with sister uh sister shakira in church people say it wasn't a big thing to predict her death because she had cancer well that's true but the reason it was a big thing was because all of uh sister shakarian's preacher friends had already said thus saith the lord she was gonna live so brother abraham comes after the thought after all these prophecies and his prophecy goes against all the famous preachers so who was right was it the famous preachers did she live or was the was the prophet of god right we know the prophet of god was right okay also brother and prophesied sister humes would live and she did she lived 40 years after being here to tuberculosis had 25 uh uh great i'm sorry 25 grandchildren 40 great-grandchildren and brother said you go away yourself and two mondays in a row he said and see if i haven't told you what has come to pass see if i haven't told you that's the truth amen program said no denomination will ever come back to the apostolic doctrine that's thus saith the lord amen and we've seen it no denomination has ever come back they just float further and further away but said thus saith the lord about the vision of the american churches and look how she's so immoral look how she's in sexy clothes right the panic also is probably the worst of all of them right uh the churches i visited they were probably the worst dressed ones in fact the orthodox catholic were probably the best dressed ones because a lot of them had skirts on i think i forgot to say that william could tell you that the one that had all the idols out in the of the lobby for sale their women were actually the most modest dresser other than the apostolic church we went to so brother mary spoke numerous thus saith the lords that have come to pass of course the other side won't recognize them because they won't recognize truth and that's fine they're entitled to their own opinion so brother man was like john the baptist that he spoke with thus saith the lord they both saw visions and they both spoke with us saith the lord second the bible says they all were set apart and opposed the popular religious organizations of their day right elijah rebuked ahab and jezebel john the baptist rebuked herod and herodias brother branham rebuked jfk and jackie kennedy right so each man rebuked them and then each man rebuked denominations of their day right elijah rebuked the baal prophets uh john the baptist called he called the clergy generation of vipers are you sometimes you think i'm rough how about that i've ever called them a bunch of snakes i haven't done that yet but if the holy ghost comes upon me i gotta obey the holy ghost and then brother braham said today i indict this bunch of ministers they are crucified to the people the very god they claim to love and serve i invite these ministers in the name of lord jesus upon their what their doctrine church don't we know how important doctrine is false doctrine it makes these men today indicted which means they're guilty they're going to be guilty on the day of judgment for crucifying the lord jesus saying the days of miracles pass the water baptism in the name of lord jesus christ is not sufficient and not right upon any of these words they've substituted creed for i indict them as guilty in the blood of jesus christ upon their hands for crucifying the flesh the lord jesus the second time they're crucifying christ to the public taking them from the thing they're supposed to be given to them and they substitute something else in this place a church for creed listen for popularity isn't that exactly right most churches want to be big and popular so they want prince will by their doctrine they won't preach bride doctrine they'll preach foolish virgin doctrine or maybe mother harlot doctrine right or maybe a protestant daughter doctrine amen they'll preach that because they just want to be popular i'm so glad we're so far removed from being popular we have no cares to be popular we just want heaven to know us amen we just want the devil to be able to say paul i know uh peter i know jesus i know and i know sister smith amen and i know brother smith and i know sister naomi and brother william and they all that's what we want we want hell to recognize that jesus christ is in our lives amen that's the popularity we want amen it's not even popularity it's just power and authority third they condemned immoral women i kind of named this earlier uh jezebel herodias and brother and marilyn monroe and jackie kennedy i quote he said brother said i don't want you influenced by marilyn monroe i want you influenced by jesus christ see by his word he's the word if the word they influence you then christ can't because he is the word amen he rebuked jackie kennedy i said a hard thing about mrs kennedy a couple times about her setting passions for the world these waterhead haircuts our sisters and then the haircuts and dressed like mrs kennedy i said like a jezebel of old that's true think about that through her fashion she calls them to cut their hair wear makeup wear high heels and also say hail mary's praise god that's interceding with the dead so see that's why that denominational spirit's a slippery slope once you get them in there with the outward things it's just a real easy thing to get into praying to the dead interceding with demons right it's a very easy thing to fall into if people aren't careful now i heard today one preacher i've been listening to podcasts one preacher who's left the message now says he says the roman catholic church isn't the mother harlot then who in the world is so now if that means she's not well then now he can open his arms and accept the roman catholic church come on in mother harlot come on in go ahead i'll ride the beast with you right see how blind these people are at times if they're not careful fourth they were men of the wilderness right elijah was from gilead a mountainous region near river jordan he spent time at the brook sheriff fed by ravens he rested in the juniper tree and he dwelt alone in the cave hearing god's voice this man this man was always out in the wilderness amen john the baptist drunk awareness from about 12 to 30 right or maybe 9 to 30 depending on who you talk to he ate locusts and honey and wore camel's hair as a preaching outfit they managed to spend most of his free time in the woods awareness to refresh his mind and body because the gift of discernment would sap his spirit right his human spirit and his physical strength just like daniel experienced in daniel chapter 8 26 and 27 let's read that daniel 8 26 it's probably been a long time since we read it it's been years since we read this daniel 8 26-27 church you can go online just type in looking for some of the man's friends every one of them said that brother ram would be talking to them and in the midst of a conversation his eyes would kind of gloss over and he would look off and see a vision and come back every one of them say that and they would tell he would tell them secrets of their lives and these men are crying they're weeping it was a real prophet of god but each time they did that church it was a physical drain on no wonder he could remember some of the details you could ask my wife i forget tons of details probably been preaching 15 years and i don't go in visions every day all day how much more brother and be physically sapped his mental uh energy sap from all these visions daniel 8 26 27 and the vision of the evening in the morning which was told is true wherefore shut thou up the vision for it shall be for many days and i daniel fainted and with six certain days after when i rose up and did the king's business and i was astonished at division but none understood it so it was more than one day one vision knocked him out for more than one day of course this was a major vision right think about writing the entire chapter can you imagine seeing a vision where you could write a chapter for it afterwards this is a major holy ghost anointed vision and so he was sick for two days afterwards so see church sometimes people don't realize these things but we do they had to be men of the wilderness but abraham said he really went out to the woods to see god and rest he said i think god is there he said uh to see him and how he moves so if you go out long enough in nature on the woods or by the river by the lake pretty soon you'll see how god moves amen lastly so here's the fifth one all the men battled the sin nature when they were not under the holy ghost anointing them in their minds elijah fled to the wilderness off a threat of one threat from jezebel and he just slain over 450 prophets he just saw a fire fall down from heaven but when that anointing left he ran afraid of the woman of course in her her uh you know soldiers right that makes sense but why would he run when he saw god bring fire down see because the anointing left john the baptist saw that and the the holy ghost is sent like a dove but then when he was in prison he said go ask jesus is he the messiah or should we look for another he'd already said that he'll baptize you with the holy ghost and fire now he's word is he the one or do i look for another brother abraham under the holy spirit said this and that you might know i be god's prophet his spirit is all me here now you also have a condition of the colon and bowel so broman numerous times said i'm god's prophet but when the anointing left look what he says he says many people regard me as a prophet i don't regard myself that no sir i don't say that to be humble i say that to be truthful i do not regard myself to be a prophet the lord i haven't that honor now look under the anointing if you i'm god's prophet i'm telling you you've got this trouble this trouble but when the anointing leaves he says on me i don't call myself a prophet hallelujah the teacher see what the see what the anointing does church the anointing makes us so bold the anointing makes us so sure but if if that anointing leaves our mind what happens we become afraid we question things we doubt and the church said you'll be so happy in church right you feel like god's speaking to you you feel like god spoke through brother briggs a brother can but then a few weeks later what happened to our faith it's just a battle we've got to go through but the bible said you got to stir up your mind by way of remembrance amen got to go back to that first level now do you remember this gentleman now god rest his soul i hope he's saved i don't know but i hope he said he claimed to be elijah in 2015. his name was tony palmer is so sad uh a year after this 2016 he died in a motorcycle accident but he said he came in the spirit of elijah he's the catholic priest he came in the spirit elijah to unite the protestants and this is the man that remember i showed you all those false prophet sermons this was the man that cursed covenant and said it was going to go away didn't go away this man he has a lot of problems but he was said i'm elijah to anoint protestants with catholic and then died a year later now i'm not saying it was god's judgment i don't know only god knows but also i'm saying is that brother brandon said he had the spirit of elijah and he rebuked catholicism with thus saith the lord and he warned the people not to unite with catholicism with thus saith the lord but then another man comes along and says i've got this blue elijah you need to uh you need to unite with uh the catholic the catholics well which one's right whichever one's right with the word amen right and this man says uh he said he said doctrines don't matter he said god work it out when we get there that's a beaufort that's a bold-faced lie doctrine is i just read it doctrine is many times what separates the true believer from the false believer that's what usually separates it because both sides have anointing for miracles at times right both sides can have miracles so a miracle doesn't prove someone saved america will prove they've gotten the right anointing and god bless their anointing god bless their sincerity but that doesn't mean they're saved because these guys have miracles too he was talking about miracles this guy says they have miracles but yet they teach all kinds of blasphemous things okay so i just thought i'd remind you of that that we had a prophet who gave us thus saith the lord against catholicism and that's what we're standing on because we can see all the bible errors of catholicism and we can see how it's wrong and god has called us out of denominational systems and he said come over my people that should be not partakers of our sins and plagues come to jesus because jesus is the way church he's the way the truth and the right and no man comes to the father except through except through jesus amen so we had a prophet with the elijah spirit pointing us to the lord whereas another man who says he has elijah spirit pointed away from the word and said the word doesn't matter to me it's as clear as day commit to me it's so clear but some for some reason people can't see it remember there's former message preachers saying the catholic church is not the mother of harlot yet they got all that child abuse it's not only a clergy of i'm sorry it's not only priest abuse it's nuns abuse nuns are abusing luna girls just like priests are abusing little boys there's all kinds of news on that a couple years ago it all came out things that are known i mean they just make it known it's a it's a total their dna is wrong right their dna is not the they're not terminal people that do that they're children of the wicked one because they're known by their fruits they're known by their corrupt fruits but a good tree is known by tooth fruit amen hallelujah now it's kind of like church what we see here now as we're finishing up this series on the church ages in the old testament we see through the kings that your life is a choose your own destiny god told moses tell israel choose life that you may live choose blessing and you'll be blessed but choose cursing and you'll be cursed remember he said choose life he said why would you die oh israel remember he said that why will you die oh israel that's what moses told israel why would you choose to die choose to live praise god now in 2017 i don't remember this slide but i use this slide we can parallel the natural kings with us because we're the spiritual kings now remember the kings had three outcomes let's preach to this from my sermon in 2017. the kings were all they were either called right right but or evil you only fit in three choices amen really fit in three categories that's what jesus said about the end time amen either hot lukewarm or cold amen that's how it is you're going to fit in one of those three categories so david is the example david that did that which is right in the sight of the lord now the kind of middle of the road the kind of lukewarm was did right but not as david had done and then the other one the third kind was evil as it was in the eyes of the lord now i'm going to skip through these because you're probably you remember these hezekiah that was right uh jonathan was an example of did right but you entered not into the temple of the lord um evil is like jehoram jehu ram he raw evil on the side lord but not like his father mother before you put away the image of baal's fathered me now church this is what we ended with on sunday what were your records what will your book in heaven say right because we read all these about these men and women we see what their lives were like but we're spiritual kings and priests what is god going to write about our lives well we know he's going to write whatever we choose praise god now brother branham came across many things in his life i just listed five at the beginning brother branham let his mother-in-law say don't go to those trash people the pentecostals and so brother man listen to his mother-in-law he gave him the peer pressure can i say it like this this is a form of discrimination right kinda like remember how peter got under discrimination he wouldn't eat with the gentiles same thing here brother graham kind of in one sense discriminated against the pentecostals all because the pressure of his mother-in-law he didn't want to let down his mother-in-law right and anyone with a family that has you know some family the message and some not right you can relate to that right you know the family that's not in the message they want you to do this they want you that and you gotta pray about it right you gotta ask you gotta seek the lord so lord what's the right approach may god help us to always stand with the word of god amen i try to do that in my life with my mother-in-law my father-in-law and my wife and i as we pray we try to do that which is right in the sight of the lord we certainly got into it well i shouldn't say that i better not go too far ah second murder man was pressured to accept women preachers by his first pastor remember roy davis said uh billy he said you got to come to the service tonight we're having a woman preach and brother said i won't he said well give me your he said you're gonna have to resign he said i won't have to here's my he's here's my denominational preaching card he just handed it right in so look braham was able in that trial that uh that pressure from denominational pressure bernie was able to freely forsake his church the church that let him preach right the church that opened the paper he was so strong in the lord he was able to turn to his car and just walk away and say see you later god will raise up a church that believes the truth that's going to be recorded in his testimony when the denominational spirit tried to come in and say oh you should bow to jezebel right when jezebel tried to come in the holy spirit had had his way in brother man's life and brother overcome that denominational spirit third when he went to south africa for the first time the ministers tried to get him to go to the small churches when the angels of the lab told them to go to the big churches or the uh the bigger campaigns and what about them do he gave in to the ministers so he suffered with amoebas i think for a year after if i'm not mistaken or maybe six months he was off the field for six months to a year now see brother ram is not the only one that would compromise this because we all compromise it sometimes we all fall short of the glory of god but god we should let god teach us through our mistakes we should be able to say if i failed last time with this i'm not going to fail this time amen and that's what brother learned brother learned these mistakes right he learned from the mother-in-law he learned from the ministers and their denominational spirits right he learned from that now this is the one i read this one i mentioned endless service in 1962 a man named brother pope offered him five times the income think about that if you make fifty thousand dollars [Music] times five that's 200 that's a quarter million dollars imagine if somebody said i offer you a quarter million dollars to leave your church and you'll get it every year what would you do well i hope you stay with the word but that's what they offer baby has the quotes from the sermon is your life worthy of the gospel 1963. he said we'll give you a private jet can you imagine finding private jet you have to fly with all the public people you get to sit first class make a quarter million dollars he said okay what do i have to do brother he knew he was being tested you know oh just gotta you know don't preach on the water baptism in jesus name don't preach against initial evidence and don't preach against women preachers abraham said he said i'm surprised that a man who would honor me would ask me to compromise on the things i hold more dear than life see doctrine of abraham was more dear than life and that's what doctrine is to us it's more dear than life because it's the spirit of truth amen your actions our actions prove what spirit is behind us that that's what brother man knew but man knew it's not so much it's not the number of miracles it's the it's the it's the actions of obedience praise god hallelujah that's what matters obeying the lord obeying the spirit of truth walking in truth amen that's what matters hallelujah walking in the truth of god and the last one i just brought up was remember but i was tempted by the devil by his own complex to stop preaching in churches and to take his wife and go up into canada and then whenever god would give him without saving the lord he said he'd thunder down he'd stomp down the mountain to come down and say god said the lord and he'll leave and go back up to the mountains and the angel said you better not do that your wife will leave you you have a divorce essentially right a separation he said you better not do that you'll become a bum like your uh brother-in-law fletcher you become a bum so see look what even when we go through complex of church we have to we have to be confident that the holy ghost will help us at the right time in the right season amen but think about it brother man had fallen on all these what would his testimony be he would have been a man that abandoned the church that's called an apostate by the way apostates do not inherit the kingdom of god that's why when people abandon the church it's a very serious thing they're a bad they're leaving the battle it's like we're fighting on the battle tonight are you fighting tonight church that god's brothers we're fighting here the good fight of faith we're standing for truth and those that abandon us are going to have to suffer for that they're apostates they're leaving the faith the other one is joining organization uniting with the antichrist spirit so was that top one so was the second one really that's the jezebel spirit right submitting to a woman minister and then denominational spirit the third one but church each one of us are going to choose our own blessing thank god that the holy ghost god gave brother man victory after victory after victory and he learned from his mistakes and he was to finish his life saying that he was able to finish his course and keep the faith just like saint paul amen hallelujah praise god amen thank you church i appreciate you know we i know it's hard when there's less people here you know it's getting harder so we just gotta press through by the grace of the lord so this is why i showed in 2017. you put your name in there jesse was blank years old when he or she began to reign spiritually and jesse reigned how many years in akron you could put your name in there because you reign over the world or is the next slide but said you reign over these three these three three these four things sin the world the flesh and the devil so put your name in there lydia lydia began to reign over the devil in this year and she reigned how many years in doyletown or in akron that's your testimony and then lydia did that which was right put your name in there question male guy garrus nature virtue eden put your name in there haven she did that which was right in the sight of the lord and did all that uh brother branham did or said like i said like that or all that jesus did or all that jesus wanted you to do see we're all gonna have a story told about us the bible said the books will be open and then you'll be judged according to what's in the book i want the book to say that i started reading at this age amen 19 hallelujah i started reading at 19 amen and now it's what i'm let's see 29 39 it's 20 22 years rain for 22 years praise god in akron and i did that which was right amen just like saint paul that's my desire just to be just like saint paul did all according to what saint paul told me to do in the bible amen see church you got to put yourself in there and mothers and fathers if you're not a preacher that's what you can do you can still reign over these four evils sin the world the flesh and the devil each one of us has a testimony and we have to reign over these by the grace of god remember what bernard said he that overcomes and keeps my works to the end it's very evident from the remarks of the spirit on works that the lord is trying to get his own to see his opinion of righteous works four times he mentions works don't let anybody tell you works don't matter works matter praise god works don't save you but after you are saved works matter praise god jesus's work saves you but then he wants you to work amen the bible says we're soldiers enlisted in the army what general doesn't want his soldiers to work amen whoever hires a soldier pay some money and just sit in the tent and just eat drink and be married nobody you gotta get up and you gotta exercise in the morning you gotta run some miles you gotta put your backpack on you gotta change god saves you to put you to work amen everybody should know that four times jesus mentions works in revelation chapter two fire to your church age and now he says that he keeps doing his works faithfully until the end will be given power over nations and will be a strong capable unbending ruler who can cope so powerfully with any situation even the most desperate enemy will be proved will be broken if need be his demonstration of rule by power will be like the very sons this is very amazing hallelujah in other words if you can do the right works over and over and get godly habits then you'll be able to handle every situation that comes your way you won't be afraid of your neighbor you'll be afraid of the doctor right for those of us to go to the doctor you won't be afraid of of a debate you won't be afraid of sickness you won't be afraid of your mother-in-law father-in-law you won't be afraid of them because you've already gained the works of god god is already working you on a daily basis and you know where you stand and review what god's called you to do you only know how to surrender to the works of the holy spirit that's what i want church i want to handle every situation that so that no matter what happens our faith is in jesus christ and we can handle every situation i always try to think about that by the grace of god what if somebody comes in here like a devil when somebody comes in here you know screaming or shout what lord you'll just give me strength for that hour now brother man says perfect faith is the master of all circumstance for perfect faith masters all circumstance now i'm not going to read all this but faith masters every circumstance and brother talks about in a room of sickness the lord's revealed that this certain thing is going to happen you just speak it and go on so in other words in every bad situation you wait for the lord's leading right you wait for god to say pray for this person or just bless them right or god give me the words to answer this question i don't know the question give me the words so in each situation perfect faith has to master the circumstance in other words you have to wait for the perfect revelation in the situation faith believes that god will work it out i don't know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyhow see it masters all circumstances and faith and love is relation because you can't have faith unless you got love because your faith is in a god who is the very essence of love faith and love works together so see in other words the more you love god the more faith you'll have when those situations arise thank god i love this quote too anybody ever fear that they won't make the rapture sometimes that comes on me i'll be honest it comes on everybody but man said if a man fears he might not please god what should the man do let him fulfill the word in other words church open your bible and whatever it says do it if a man wonders is jesus going to tell me well done good and faithful servant let him fulfill the word of god in his life and assuredly he will hear those words of praise the word of truth was the criterion then it's the criterion now there isn't another standard there isn't another plum line as the world is going to be judged by one christ jesus even soda is going to be judged by the word if a man wants to know how he's go how he's making out let him do as james suggested look into the mirror of god's word church that's why we got to read our bibles every day hallelujah that's why we got to read chapters that's why they read books in the bible you got to look into the mirror of god's word and when you look at it and you do it then you have confidence i know i'm doing what he's called me to do i know he'll accept me in heaven praise god because i've done what he asked me to do is my flesh gonna like it no the bible says every day you've got to crucify your flesh paul said i die every week i die weekly no no i die monthly i die every year at christmas time and come to church at christmas time that's what a lot of denominational people do i don't die every year i die daily praise god so see if you wonder if you're going to miss i'm sorry if you're wondering about the rapture do what the bible says to make the rapture have oil add extra oil in your soul right because the foolish virgin ran out of oil she ran out of that power she ran out of that anointing she ran out of that but the wise had plenty they prepared in advance amen trust that's what we're doing tonight amen we're making preparations so if the if the rapture holds off if god's wrong suffering holds off we'll still be ready praise god if we die we'll be ready to be the ones that are raised first amen because we have enough oil to be ready when the bridegroom comes amen hallelujah praise god thank you jesus amen but see the world wants popularity now let's look at some lessons now we i just briefly went over this i think in part one i never got to all this israel was our examples in chapter 10 of first corinthians verse 6 to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be idolaters as some of them as is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up the plate neither let us commit fornication are you counting these sins start counting now we've got three so far neither of those commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand now i don't have it up here but verse nine neither let us tempt christ as some of them also attempted and were destroyed as serpents neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happen under us unto them for and samples and they're written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come let him that thinketh he standeth take he lest he fall okay so we are given five sins that israel fell to which proved they couldn't enter the baptism of the holy ghost to the promised land sorry about that is that me that's all right sound is kind of like that you know sometimes it's all sometimes it's good sometimes it's not gotta be ready for any situation right five these five are named now remember they prompted god ten times and were kept out but paul lists five sins that they specifically did now we have to take counsel we have to take warning and we have to self-examine ourselves that we don't think we're above these things church let's just say tonight i'm not above lust i could fall to lust i'm not above idolatry i could idolize something i need god's help to overcome idolatry church you're not if you're not married you're not above fornication you can fall to that right or adultery if you're married tempting god especially when something bad happens and you want god to do something right away you could tempt god you're not above that you could try to make god or command command god to do something for you now here's where we all battle murmuring and complaining right we're not above complaining sometimes we complain and we need to ask god for forgiveness he said take heed lest you fall into these five that's what we should learn from these kings that's what we should learn from all the old testament now what did eve fall to if really this was adultery and she voted those so she at least fell to two of those eve did right these were written for us in other words we need to read the old testament scriptures to gain admonition to gain warning and to gain humility so we examine ourselves and take heed lest we fall to them praise god that's just what the devil would love the devil just love to see somebody in our church who says they got the holy ghost he would just love to get them to fall in stumble in one of these areas and embarrass them at work embarrass them in the church embarrass them online embarrass them in their family he would just love to get somebody to commit a fornication or idolatry or attempt the lord or murmur and complain about something about the church he would just love to do that but you and i can't let him do that you and i got to make sure we're only standing on the word of god praise god and we can't be talked out of the word of god and we can't move to shifting sands but we want to set our foundation on the rock of revelation a rock of the word of god amen church let me say we're not above that we can fall short to some of these things remember remember john the revelator he fell down to worship an angel you remember that in the book of revelation he said hey get up don't do that i'm of one of your brothers the prophets right he was the holy ghost of a man he served god he preached for 60 years he saw america after america he leaned on jesus and muslim amen but he still could be weak and still be tempted with idolatry so we must all take heed lest we fall amen choose your destiny i like those books choose your own adventure right malcolm x says i've seen it like this i like those when i was a boy too you could choose your own adventure that's what the bible is telling us we must choose our destiny choose life or choose death amen now look from a child you've known the holy scriptures which are able to make the wise and the salvation through faith which is in christ jesus all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is going to help you in doctrine reproof correction instruction and righteousness that the man or woman of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works so what is doctrine the scripture will make you right in your doctrine which is your instruction your precepts your commandments how many want the right commands praise god we don't want the commands like oh you need to you need to sow a seed of two thousand dollars and then god's gonna bless you just sow that seed and the seed's gonna bring forth come up and lay up lay up two thousand dollars here on the offer like they do at the denominational churches that's tempting the lord as well that's accepting the lord that's not good that's not sound doctrine oh if you just if you just give a uh if you just give two thousand dollars uh your life your whole life is gonna change not always not always now reprove the old testament will give you reproof what is the proof conviction it will give you some evidence or some conviction all scripture reading all the bible will give euchain some conviction praise god so think about that solomon was convicted he was tempted by women right so our brothers can take that i want to use solomon's testimony to convict me to always live holy unto god right all brothers can say that or like hezekiah got puffed up in pride and he showed the babylonians as all the treasures in the house of god all of our sisters and daughters we all need to live abroad the pride of life right we're going to take heed to that we have to we have to take a warning from that be reproved by the word of god the next was correction restoration to your right state improving your life or your character all the old testament amen we'll improve your character amen hallelujah thank god and instruction in righteousness there's a whole lot in here but if you're instructing the righteousness you're instructed to increase your virtue very very differently so instruction in righteousness is instructing you to have more strength or power virtue all right i'm trying to close here now as doctrine and planet yes i've preached this numerous times look what the bible says look to yourselves that you don't lose the things you work for but receive a full reward whosoever transgresses and abides not the doctrine of christ has not god but he that abides in the doctrine of christ hath both the father and son if there come any unto you and bring down this doctrine receive him not into your house neither been in god's speed in other words don't even let a false doctrine on your phone right don't even let it on your tv if you got a tv screen don't let it in your house because it's going to have a a crippling effect it's going to hurt your family and it's going to hurt your church amen doctrine is so crucial the bible says if you got the right doctrine you got the invisible father and you got the visible sun amen hallelujah in other words you've got the holy ghost and you've got jesus as your high priest there it is hallelujah let me say hear your prayers amen and they'll bless you and they'll keep you if you got the right doctrine you've got the invisible holy ghost and you've got the high priest you see even medicine preachers say oh doctor no matter doctrine matters tremendously that's really what matters because if you've got the holy ghost you'll have the right doctrine it's the same thing now i'm going to skip past this let me close with these a few words to my online and church that's okay i'm not i'm not making fun of them i'm not knocking i'm just trying to be as kind as i can as i close but the bible says there are false brethren unawares brought in who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage so the people that are online as spies they're not here to help us they're trying to get us into bondage to accuse us right just look for our faults they're not really trying to help us be a better christian church i'm here to help you be a better christian tonight i want to i hope i've shown you enough word of god where you can accept the word of god and your character or your virtue or your nature can be increased amen as well right that's what i'm here for i'm here to minister the word of god to you praise god amen so you can be more solidified in the truth of god's word so you can be stronger and you can take heed lest you fall because we don't want to see people fall church doesn't break your heart when you see people fall away from the truth far away from our church of course it breaks our hearts i try to text them and bring them back or call them and bring them back send them free things send them my brips all these things it breaks our hearts when people don't come back but spies around us in our life that's why i'm praying for you brother that you get saved and sanctified and filled with the holy ghost they don't come to help us they try to bring us into bondage to the bondage they're under and what did paul say paul said to whom we gave place by subjection not even an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue so at least one man is watching my sermons just to report them to brother rahm's accusers instead of coming to try to help me if he was a real brother he'd want to help me that way he come to me one on one if i offended him of course this isn't anything new because these are spirits on the spies the bible said right because we're in their liberty what is liberty remember i talked about kids what was liberty liberty was obeying what the holy spirit yeah all right giving you guys two claps that's liberty so we're we're in the liberty we're obeying the commands of the lord they say it's legalism but really they're the legalists because they're not obeying the commands of god they're saying uh they're saying you don't have to obey these things well jesus says obey all live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god and like i said jesus said go to the person offending you this proves these men are them one spire many spies they cannot be more free since leaving the message because they're trying to get me to fall they're trying to accuse me it's not trying to help me they're trying to bring me in bondage see and let me say like this they're slaves to plotting spirits because the bible says they're spies which means to inspect in order to plot against you they're trying to set up something against me instead of trying to help me they're trying to set something up against me that's not the right spear [Music] no i watch their side too i do a lot of watching their side and i'm getting ready to share with them all the things they're wrong on i just need a lot of time to prepare because i'm trying to finish the book i'm trying to preach to you i'm trying to feed your souls yeah i'm watching their side and it's with an intent to help them i already debated them i tried to help them through for three and a half hours out of the day i tried to help them face to face i wrote this book and none of them none of them want to read either book but what's the bible say when you plot against somebody you're either that's one of these i can't i haven't had enough time to study that they're either in variance emulation striper sedition because they're trying to do a just they're trying to do a heated contention to put to put me against the other brother or they're an emulation they're trying to do a rivalry between me and the brother instead of trying to help me out why they just come to me if i sinned against them why don't they just come to me and try to help me like a brother they're trying to get me in bondage or maybe it's strife maybe they're trying to uh election year for some position make themselves look great with this this other side the the the brother man's accuser side or maybe they're just at the spirit of sedition the demonic spirit of sedition they just want to divide believers they just want to create trouble that's what the bible said they spy out in order to set a plot against you a church let me read it for our brother listening our spy brother and i say that love because that's what the bible says they are in the book brother there's 15 doctrines paul taught that most churches reject and i would say most people that leave the message are under bondage to some of these sins for example homosexual relationships paul condemns those adulterous relationships married more than one time that's a spirit they might be under it's okay to have adulteries married two three times spirit of fornication letting people marry it's okay to be married i'm sorry it's okay to do uh relations before someone's married murdering babies through abortion or abortion pills a lot of churches are okay with that women preachers yet paul forbids any woman from teaching a man see they're under that bondage they're under these bondage they're trying to get me under those bondages no sir i won't be under that violence they're not trying to help me they're trying to bring me under their same bondage substance abuse some of them smoke some of them get drunk but paul says if you defile the body you defile the temple the holy ghost and those things should not be done as long as the world stands amen little church you're right your own destiny amen you write your own story tonight praise god hallelujah you're a king you're a priest amen over sin flesh the devil in the world praise god do what's right we're doing what's right in the sight of the lord we're keeping paul's commands because that's what we judge by on that day amen the bible said all will stand before the judgment scene of christ and get the rewards done in their body done their flesh according to your works and we ain't even close to done well i gotta go fast viewing sinful movies and television shows yeah paul says i avoid all appearance of evil and josh i listen to these people that leave the message now they're on a movie binging spree they have all these movies they watched they got cussing on them murdering uh uh sex scenes all kinds of wicked things like this and they sit there and watch it and laugh about it and enjoy it yeah i'm listening to you too i'm spying on you guys but i'm gonna try to help you praise god i am just give me some time here so my some of my plans take longer than those like i thought this book that i wrote would take a little time to three years to write it and i'm almost done with it i saw i'm almost done with the audiobook sometimes i bite off a little more than i can chew but i'll get it done by god's grace shameful hair like so that women cut hair and paul says it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair and she'll be one verse in the bible where god ever asked a godly woman to cut her hair if she does she brought shame upon her husband and jesus christ show me a scripture where it's wrong show me they won't do it because they can't have any because there's none in there they're trying to bring me into their bondage false conversions they say there's only one work of grace what a lie that is oh you said the sinner's prayer now you're filled with the holy ghost you're five years old now you're through with the holy ghost i still want to go play and not even talk about god they just said a scripted sinner's prayer yes i'll say that so you can write and then church and then they write it down in their books like they got all these converts and then they go presented at a conference we have four four thousand congress this year and they're like four or five-year-olds that aren't even serving god don't even read that bible don't even pray how can they they can't even read you know and that's what they say these are real converts come on my goodness let's let's be sincere and how about this one in modest clothing all these men that have left they say the bible says modesty and it doesn't define it and so the woman has to figure out by herself because the bible don't say well i can't wait to give them a copy of my book and they say there's no bible modesty standards she has to figure it out on her own what a lie see what are they trying to do they're trying to bring us in that bondage to the lust spirit right let let the women dress however they want that's the spirit of lust those guys like seeing it that's why they do it that's why the nether women dress that the way they want they're under the bondage to that spirit they can't take a stand for harness because they don't have the holy ghost like we got in amen now that's just 10 church remember they're judged by whose gospel paul and those are all paul's gospels remember i prove it to you the bride keeps all the word of god when i preach chapter four here's five more paul baptized in the name of our lord jesus christ and they're doing father son holy ghost they're wrong on that the three works of grace i kind of mentioned already god's one person yet they call them three persons i was called a complete heretic last week on a podcast because i believe god's one person but at least i got scripture for mine they don't have any scripture for three persons so who's the real heretic well they've named themselves whatever the devil accuses you of that's what he's usually guilty of and paul never said god was three persons and will be judged by paul's gospel amen okay now i think i better stop there so teachers look at the bodies they're under i'm trying to close they're under a jezebel spirit because they let women preach to them they're and that means they're led by women they're led by in other words the roman catholic church and the daughters they're under a woman spirit a dominating female spirit in other words that's an evil spirit they're under the last lust spirit they watch movies they log all their movies and that's also there's no modesty standards that's lost again that's abominations under those spirits they're under the spirit of pride i've heard them on the podcast say they they uh they praise each other say you're a professor okay i'll just call you mr professor and the other guy says he says people just call me a walking bible and they exalt themselves so highly that's pride you're not a walking bible jesus was the walking bible you lied and things come out of your mouth and you sin and you say that you're not a walking bible you're walking a pile of dirt cloud amen that's that's what you are with the spirit and soul on the inside but yeah they say i'm a professor i'm a walking bible see how the pride is entered into them they're deceivers saying oh it's one work of grace you already got the holy ghost that's that's a lie we don't have time for that verse but that's their verse right there they promise them liberty but they're all slaves of corruption they're slaves all these other sins and they're liars church they have countless countless assumptions about brother branham just because birmingham changes the story they'll jump and they'll make a conclusion they'll lie and say see he lied and they'll make up some reason why there's all these uh changes in the stories and they're lying they're basically they're they're saying that they know what brother man was thinking they know exactly what happened they all know what happened they're lying saying that they know what happened and they called brother malaya they weren't there they don't know what happened they're just guessing it based upon what they know it's all assumptions so you see they're in bondage to that and of course the roman catholic church is no longer the mother of harlot well then who is who is that mother harder who sits on seven hills who is she that has an influence over the whole world it could only be the roman catholic church i have 11 11 proofs in the bible my dear friend my spy friend if you'll read the book and i'll send you one for free if you just tell me your name and address i'm not afraid of you because we got the word of god and then again no modesty standards there it is let's stand to our feet you can you can close it now god bless you my spy friends and all the saints we love you god bless you musicians can come see church and i hope you can see how that ties in you and i have a choice to make right when god writes the story about the laodicean church age there's going to come this part where in 2012 all these people left the message and those who stand and stay in the truth of god's word are going to have to overcome overcoming testimony
