[0:00] preach a maybe
[0:02] a a thought I haven't really preached
[0:04] often or recently but I'd like to preach
[0:06] on the secret Believers by God's grace
[0:08] as I mentioned on Wednesday John chapter
[0:11] 3 verse one it's good to be in the house
[0:13] of the Lord today good to see all the
[0:14] saints Hallelujah by God's
[0:27] grace John chapter 3: 1
[0:39] as you're turning there uh the Saints
[0:41] from Junction City send their greetings
[0:43] uh we saw them Thursday night my wife
[0:45] and I went together it was nice little
[0:46] date time there to uh be together and uh
[0:50] got home about 12: was 12:30 12:40 boy
[0:53] that was a late night still trying to
[0:55] recover today by God's grace Hallelujah
[0:57] but uh they're doing really well
[1:01] um you know just uh trying to pray for
[1:04] them and ask God to minister to their
[1:06] needs you know they uh they've got their
[1:08] trials they're young believers you know
[1:10] I maybe I'll share a little bit about
[1:11] some things they're going through you
[1:12] know try not to use any names or
[1:14] anything but they're just going through
[1:16] uh different seasons of uh growth as a
[1:19] Christian praise God so they're they're
[1:22] doing well and I'm uh we're happy to uh
[1:25] to be with them praise God I told
[1:27] Brother Irvin as well I told I invited
[1:29] brother Irvin he's the eldest gentleman
[1:30] there and I asked him if he'd come up
[1:32] and preach for us in the morning and
[1:34] then in the evening we could do uh like
[1:36] we used to do the podcast you know he
[1:37] could sit at the table and I talk to him
[1:39] and record his testimony I've had a few
[1:41] people record I'm sorry I've had a few
[1:43] people request could we share their
[1:45] testimony how did they hear about the
[1:46] message how do they come into the
[1:48] message because it's just it's brought a
[1:49] lot of encouragement hope to people uh
[1:52] so I invited him up and he just kind of
[1:55] smiled and I said you just pray about it
[1:57] brother uh again and I told him I said
[2:00] you know I said brother I said I really
[2:01] feel like you're called to Pastor that
[2:03] church and he just kind of smiled you
[2:04] know kind of smiled looked away he's a
[2:06] little hesitant to do it um but we'll
[2:09] just see how God leads by the grace of
[2:12] God John 3 like to look at secret
[2:14] Believers of course this is looking at
[2:15] the foolish virgin and remember we can
[2:17] always draw something from this because
[2:19] the foolish Virgin of course it it
[2:21] contrasts with the wise virgin we want
[2:24] to be the wise Virgin by the grace of
[2:26] God hallelujah but this is a fresh
[2:28] thought I've never had this thought
[2:29] before as far as those two words secret
[2:31] believer uh brother Bram said it 23
[2:34] times and so I studied all those and uh
[2:37] I feel like I want to preach this here
[2:38] hope it' be a blessing to you uh by the
[2:40] God's grace and church I hope like this
[2:42] I hope by God's grace that we run into a
[2:44] lot of secret Believers and that will
[2:46] see them in Heaven by God's grace that's
[2:49] that's our prayer that's my prayer
[2:51] brother Ram said many people will never
[2:53] come to your church he said they'll
[2:55] never come hear your pastor preach or
[2:57] sermon preach he said but they'll watch
[2:59] the ser sermon that you live that's
[3:01] right Hallelujah they're watching the
[3:04] sermon that you live the life that you
[3:06] live brother Bram said I'd rather have a
[3:08] man live me a sermon than preach me one
[3:11] so we want to live how you want to live
[3:13] a good sermon today praise God that's my
[3:15] prayer Hallelujah I want to live that by
[3:16] God's
[3:18] grace of course we see uh the secret
[3:20] believer part here in verse two I'll
[3:22] read one and then we can read two and
[3:24] three together you know give us a little
[3:25] bit of reading there there was a man of
[3:28] the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of
[3:30] the Jews let's read on three 1 2 3 the
[3:33] same came to Jesus by night and said
[3:36] unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a
[3:40] teacher come from God for no man can do
[3:43] these Miracles that thou doest except
[3:46] God be with him Jesus answered and said
[3:49] unto him verily verily I say unto thee
[3:53] except a man be born again he cannot see
[3:57] the kingdom of God notice that word see
[3:59] means to understand or to know Jesus
[4:02] said if you're not born again you can't
[4:04] see the kingdom of God you can't see now
[4:06] he was talking about the future the
[4:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost you won't be
[4:10] able to see the spiritual Kingdom the
[4:11] wise virgin you won't be able to see
[4:13] that so we see how this all ties
[4:15] together let's have one more word of
[4:16] prayer if you have a need on your heart
[4:17] let's make it known to god father God
[4:20] we've prayed we've worshiped we've sang
[4:22] your songs Lord God now we're looking to
[4:23] you for the word of God lord just as you
[4:25] did on Wednesday night just as you did
[4:27] last weekend with brother Dennis Lord
[4:28] and the two week or two weekends before
[4:30] that with brother Paul and brother Aaron
[4:32] we need you Lord every hour we need you
[4:34] Lord God we need you to speak to our
[4:35] hearts discern our lives uh uh encourage
[4:38] us help us Lord God hallelujah help us
[4:41] to be the Christians that you want us to
[4:43] be Lord God we know there's a high
[4:45] calling there's a high purpose Lord for
[4:47] our lives it's to live holy it's not
[4:49] just to be scarcely saved but Lord It's
[4:52] to uh make our calling and election
[4:54] Shore so the whole world all our family
[4:56] all of our friends all of our co-workers
[4:57] know that we stand for Jesus Christ
[5:00] Hallelujah and there's no doubt about it
[5:02] Lord not that we go around bragging or
[5:03] beating our chests Lord God but we walk
[5:05] around with the grace of God in our
[5:07] hearts Lord God we walk around uh
[5:09] humming and singing praises unto you
[5:11] speaking into our or speaking to
[5:13] ourselves in Psalms and and hymns and
[5:15] spiritual songs making melody in our
[5:17] hearts unto the Lord so we thank you God
[5:20] for your mercy and Grace God bless us
[5:21] now as we're in your presence in Jesus
[5:23] Christ's name and the Saints said amen
[5:25] amen God bless you as you're being
[5:26] seated praise God
[5:31] so as I said I was studying last week
[5:32] and um I was just I forget what I was
[5:34] studying I think I was studying the
[5:35] pastor I made a pastor video last week
[5:37] and and I felt like from the right side
[5:39] I don't know why it's the right side of
[5:40] my head I felt like these words come
[5:42] down to me secret believer and uh I was
[5:45] like that's right I brother Ram said
[5:46] that I've never really studied that I'd
[5:48] like to study that um to get a good
[5:52] understanding here and I do have some U
[5:54] some uh slides here Casa so I want
[5:57] to show these here by the grace of
[6:02] God now how many remember back in 2016
[6:05] it's okay if you
[6:06] don't uh but I preached a Sunday July
[6:09] 17th I preached in the morning part one
[6:12] and evening part two now the reason I
[6:14] remember it is because the good doctor
[6:16] Scott Walker he met me at the door right
[6:18] there in the old Sanctuary he said
[6:20] brother that was a real blessing to me I
[6:22] never understood that
[6:23] before and then the good doctor his wife
[6:25] and uh children visit us a few weeks ago
[6:28] right drove all the way from Arizona
[6:30] of course they were coming to Kentucky
[6:31] to see their family but they said can we
[6:33] she said can we swing by and see the
[6:35] Smiths The Smiths you know so we got to
[6:37] have three days with them they were real
[6:38] sweet people but that's why for some
[6:40] reason I remember that you know you see
[6:41] Lot's wife there this is of course the
[6:43] angel pulling lot and his three
[6:46] daughters out of Sodom and Gomorrah and
[6:48] I want to just uh start with that verse
[6:50] there just as a
[6:52] refresher uh it's 1 Peter 4:17 and 18
[6:57] just to kind of bring your uh thoughts
[7:00] here or bring these to your membrance
[7:01] here by God's grace 1 Peter 4:17 and
[7:19] 18 the Bible says for the time has come
[7:21] that judgment must begin at the house of
[7:25] God and if it first begin at us what
[7:28] shall the end end of them that obey not
[7:32] the
[7:33] gospel you know so over the years I've
[7:35] just used this verse when people ask me
[7:37] you know why do you dress up for church
[7:39] and I you know we use this verse like
[7:40] brother Ram taught us it's like going to
[7:43] court you know when you appear before a
[7:45] judge you wouldn't uh be
[7:47] disrespectful you would appear in the
[7:49] most respectful manner you can right
[7:52] I've only had one time I've ever
[7:53] appeared before the judge and I was only
[7:54] 17 and wasn't very respectful I don't
[7:57] think I that's why I got rebuked I think
[7:59] by God's Grace I was a I was a sinner
[8:01] and I didn't know better um I sure got a
[8:04] rebuke in the presence of the
[8:07] judge but we see here that uh the Bible
[8:09] tells us Peter tells us plainly judgment
[8:12] must begin at the house of God now
[8:14] there's two kinds of judgments there's a
[8:15] judgment against the soul that will send
[8:17] someone to hell but there's the Judgment
[8:20] that we all must have it's called the
[8:22] conviction of the Holy Spirit brother
[8:25] Dennis you know he said the Lord he said
[8:27] the Lord just brought to him uh he
[8:28] called it Chast chastisement what we
[8:31] call it chastisement as Believers the
[8:33] Judgment God gives on us is
[8:36] chastening and uh brother Dennis I just
[8:39] I don't know why it just meant a lot to
[8:40] me when he wrote it down he said I feel
[8:41] like the Lord's telling me this if God
[8:43] doesn't chasen us we're bastard children
[8:46] that and that's what the Bible says
[8:48] Hebrews chapter 12 and a bastard child
[8:50] is one that's not born into the family
[8:52] of God right so we want to be we want to
[8:54] make sure we're born into God's family
[8:57] Hallelujah so it's a beautiful lesson
[8:59] here at Peter gives us if anybody knew
[9:01] about God's judgment it was Peter
[9:02] because Jesus always corrected him right
[9:05] he said get behind me Satan but he
[9:07] wasn't talking to Peter he was talking
[9:08] to the spirit behind Peter right right
[9:10] and pet he's falling down and Peter uh
[9:12] he reaches his hand down pulls Peter up
[9:14] out of the water but at least Peter had
[9:16] Faith to get out of the boat praise God
[9:18] right uh Jesus was constantly correcting
[9:21] uh Everyone by God's grace but he did it
[9:22] in love amen that's what we do we do it
[9:24] with love
[9:27] Hallelujah so see that's where it begins
[9:29] begins at the house of God so God is
[9:31] going to correct uh correct his people
[9:35] first at the house of God that's where
[9:38] we get correction that's why it's so
[9:39] important not to miss Services amen
[9:41] right because you might miss God's
[9:43] opportunity to bring some correction to
[9:45] your life or uh it doesn't have to be
[9:48] judgment necessarily it could be
[9:50] blessing Hallelujah it could be uh
[9:52] wisdom discernment it could be any gift
[9:54] of the holy spirit so we never want to
[9:57] miss by God's grace that's why we talk
[9:59] about Hebrews 10 and about Gathering
[10:01] more as you see that day approaching
[10:03] Hallelujah and it first begins with
[10:06] God's people as the Bible says and I
[10:09] love what Peter he asked this uh
[10:10] question what shall the end of them that
[10:13] obey not the gospel what will their end
[10:15] be and then he brings up Verse 18 which
[10:17] is speaking of lot of course and if the
[10:20] righteous scarcely be saved where shall
[10:23] the ungodly and The Sinner appear so now
[10:26] we can see by God's grace can everybody
[10:28] see there's a there's a a
[10:30] spectrum of foolish
[10:32] virgins there's some that are just
[10:35] barely saved like uh like lot and his
[10:38] daughters barely saved right there's a
[10:41] spectrum and as we can see too uh in
[10:44] today there's message people that're
[10:46] probably right on the border of being
[10:47] born again and God will help them get
[10:49] over amen right but we know you know
[10:52] before the Rapture there's going to be
[10:54] people all along the spectrum of
[10:56] justification sanctification they're
[10:57] going to be all along the Spectrum
[10:59] and it's their choice they've got to
[11:01] walk forward amen they got to keep
[11:03] walking toward the Jordan Hallelujah
[11:05] right just like the Bible says in the
[11:07] Book of Joshua they had to walk all the
[11:09] way towards Jordan Hallelujah each one
[11:11] of us have a cadesh
[11:13] bernea right we got to come to the board
[11:16] line and say do I want to cross over do
[11:18] I want to face those giants do I want my
[11:22] my whole life to be wrapped up in this
[11:24] message hallelujah amen right that's
[11:26] what they were saying are we willing to
[11:28] go possess the land how many willing to
[11:30] possess the land hallelujah amen if
[11:32] you're willing God will take you over
[11:35] Hallelujah remember anyone who was
[11:37] willing went over Hallelujah the two
[11:40] that were willing went over Joshua and
[11:42] Caleb and of course the younger
[11:43] generation but the older generation that
[11:45] feared it and wouldn't wouldn't approach
[11:47] it they never went over God wouldn't let
[11:49] them go
[11:51] over but see look look how close they
[11:53] were scarcely lost right that's to hear
[11:56] what the Bible says if some people are
[11:57] scarcely saved then some people are
[12:00] scarcely lost that's just in other words
[12:03] just barely saved just barely like
[12:05] brother said just barely got in before
[12:07] the door closed right but the door is
[12:10] closing we know time is closing on human
[12:12] history right and some will get in right
[12:15] before the door closes I don't want to
[12:16] be that kind of person praise God I want
[12:18] to make sure I'm in and I'm taking a
[12:20] seat in the room Amen brother said when
[12:22] you get the Holy Ghost it's like God
[12:24] invites you into his room and he said he
[12:25] has all these pieces of instruments and
[12:27] each one is a gift of God and God can
[12:29] use you on any one of those gifts praise
[12:31] God I want to be in the room I want to
[12:33] be operating God's gifts I want to be
[12:35] God's servant I want to be a part of
[12:37] Jesus Christ I don't want there to be
[12:38] any questions I want everybody to know
[12:40] he was really saved Hallelujah not
[12:43] scarcely he scarcely was saved but he
[12:46] was really saved by the grace of God
[12:48] hallelujah well we all know church
[12:50] that's why I'm preaching we all have
[12:51] family members and friends right that we
[12:53] wonder are they saved we pray for them
[12:56] right we witness to them at work God
[12:58] please save them
[13:00] we run into him every day we rub
[13:01] shoulders with them every day at work
[13:02] God are they saved or not think about I
[13:05] think about my father you know I think
[13:06] of different ones in my family God are
[13:08] they saved or not I don't know but I
[13:10] know this one thing God knows Hallelujah
[13:13] and if I can be like Abraham amen I
[13:14] preach this many times but if I could be
[13:16] like Abraham and pray for the Lots in my
[13:18] life and pray that God deliver them we
[13:20] know God remembered Abraham's prayer so
[13:23] God remember Abraham seeds prayers
[13:26] Hallelujah that's the confidence I have
[13:28] I trust in God Amen My Savior amen we
[13:32] have to trust in God because of
[13:34] ourselves we can do
[13:35] nothing right God gives the increase
[13:38] amen God all we can do is water and
[13:40] plant encourage pray witness visit
[13:43] that's all we can do but God's got to
[13:45] touch that Soul Hallelujah God has to
[13:47] touch that soul and God will amen I
[13:50] believe it praise
[13:53] God so see we see people scarcely saved
[13:55] and brother man makes that uh comparison
[13:58] he said look at Abraham he was way out
[13:59] there he was clearly
[14:02] saved but lot and the daughters just
[14:04] barely saved as soon as they got out the
[14:07] fire
[14:08] fell so see we don't want to be in that
[14:11] type of a group where scarcely
[14:14] saved we want to be in the group that's
[14:16] the holy group remember there's four
[14:18] groups I'm going to read it again uh
[14:19] it's revelation 22 I believe it's verse
[14:21] 11 but please don't hold me to that it's
[14:24] been a few weeks since I referenced that
[14:25] scripture revelation 22 brother BR uses
[14:29] verse for the time of the Rapture it is
[14:31] 2211 okay he that's unjust let him be
[14:33] unjust still so here we see the four
[14:35] there's four types of people on the
[14:37] Earth brother brand calls them classes
[14:40] everybody will be in one of four classes
[14:43] now Unholy I'm sorry yes he that's
[14:46] unjust let him be unjust still he which
[14:49] is filthy let him be filthy still he
[14:51] that's righteous let him be righteous
[14:52] still and he that's holy let him be holy
[14:57] still all right so we're in one of those
[14:59] places lot was the righteous because he
[15:03] wasn't clearly separated amen Abraham
[15:05] was holy because he was separated
[15:07] Hallelujah everybody see that oh what a
[15:09] beautiful picture don't forget 17 I'm
[15:12] going to bring this out I think brother
[15:12] Aaron brought this out Revelation 2217
[15:15] it's not my notes for today but it was
[15:16] in my notes a few weeks ago I think I
[15:18] mentioned it after he preached it and
[15:20] the spirit and the bride say come and
[15:22] let him that heareth say come and let
[15:25] him that is a thirst come and whosoever
[15:28] will let him take the Water of Life
[15:32] freely so the point I want to make with
[15:34] this verse that brother Aaron made is
[15:36] the voice where's the voice of God at
[15:38] the end of the Bible it's in the bride
[15:40] amen the spirit and the bride say come
[15:43] Hallelujah that's right that means you
[15:45] are God's voice amen but back up how
[15:48] where did you get that voice you got it
[15:50] in Revelation 10 when the open book came
[15:53] down Hallelujah and the open book was
[15:55] revealed to brother Bram and brother
[15:57] Bram said eat the book right God said
[15:59] eat the book we're eating the book and
[16:00] now we become the book Hallelujah as I
[16:03] preached a few weeks ago eat the book
[16:05] you become the book you have testimonies
[16:07] amen you have Thanksgiving you have
[16:09] praise when you eat the book you give
[16:11] God glory Hallelujah and then you
[16:13] overcome by the word of your testimony
[16:16] and by the blood of Jesus Christ
[16:17] Hallelujah the blood of the Lamb that's
[16:20] right so see we got we became The Voice
[16:22] through Revelation 10 but remember
[16:25] Revelation 3 the church the nominal
[16:27] Church got kicked out from being the the
[16:29] voice right so at the beginning of this
[16:31] church age uh Jesus spewed out the
[16:34] denominations they're no longer going to
[16:35] be my voice so but Jesus said I'm going
[16:38] to give them a voice I'm going to give
[16:39] the bride a voice I'm going to bring
[16:41] down my my open seals to the the the
[16:43] seven Church age messenger he's going to
[16:45] preach he's going to finish the mystery
[16:47] of God we eat that book and then in
[16:49] revelation 22 now we're the voice of God
[16:51] how many believe that by God's grace i'
[16:53] never seen that before it's a
[16:55] progression that's what I that's what
[16:56] blessed me it's the progression
[16:58] revelation 3 no voice the church lost
[17:00] its voice Jesus has to open the seals
[17:02] bring it down to brother brandom and
[17:04] then we eat the book Hallelujah in
[17:05] Revelation 10 and then at the end time
[17:07] the spirit and the bride say come
[17:09] brother Bram tells us in the church age
[17:10] book The Spirit and the bride and the
[17:13] prophet are all saying the same thing
[17:15] and what they're saying has already been
[17:17] said in the holy word of
[17:19] God that's what I preached on Thursday
[17:21] night I preached the message and uh the
[17:24] absolute boy I laid it in heart I was
[17:26] kind of a Stern preacher on Thursday
[17:27] night but I guess it was the righteous
[17:29] indignation against brandom
[17:32] Tabernacle I don't mean to get that way
[17:34] sometimes but when I read the words that
[17:36] they say something stirs up inside of me
[17:38] like I just cannot hold still I I get
[17:40] spiritual indignation
[17:42] Hallelujah when they say it's all or
[17:44] nothing that's their quote they say it
[17:46] on tape it's either all the words are
[17:48] thus say the lord of the tapes or
[17:49] Nothing what a lie brother man tells us
[17:53] he said always be careful he said
[17:55] there's a human side and there's the
[17:57] Divine side he said but just so you know
[17:59] that it's the Divine side it'll speak it
[18:02] it'll say thus sayith the Lord amen
[18:04] hallelujah amen well that's enough of
[18:06] that all right now I don't want to go
[18:08] too harshly on that now I want to go
[18:10] back up this is a great revelation God
[18:12] showed me back in 2016 and that I needed
[18:14] this so I could write the
[18:16] books so I started off you know the
[18:18] Bible said there you're either saved or
[18:19] lost but then brother Ram tells us
[18:21] there's three kinds of Believers but by
[18:23] the end of his ministry now he says
[18:25] there's four
[18:26] classes and I was blown away as I read
[18:29] that in uh uh
[18:32] 2002 he said because there's two kinds
[18:34] of Believers you have the wise virgin
[18:36] and the foolish
[18:38] virgin okay now this is a review for
[18:39] most of us but this will be a blessing
[18:41] if you haven't read it for a while uh
[18:43] now the loss you got the make believer
[18:45] like Judas and the unbeliever brother
[18:46] Brown said there wasn't three crosses on
[18:48] Calvary there was really four now I know
[18:50] there was three on the hill of Calvary
[18:52] right but off off there in the garden
[18:55] where where the other tree was where
[18:56] Judas hung himself there was another
[18:58] tree
[18:59] that's the point I'm making I know there
[19:00] was only three on gtha I know that but
[19:03] he's he's saying the point there's
[19:04] actually four people that died right and
[19:07] so you have Jesus he was the type of the
[19:09] Holy uh or the the wise virgin right
[19:12] where's the
[19:14] wise oh yeah it's up top there it is and
[19:17] then the save Thief was the type of the
[19:19] righteous and then Judas was the type of
[19:21] the filthy and then the Lost Thief he
[19:23] was a type of the unjust never believed
[19:25] to begin
[19:26] with and then I read this and I remember
[19:29] I remember when God quickened this to me
[19:30] because I was in a ministers meeting
[19:32] Isaiah Brooks and brother Craig were up
[19:33] there doing the ministers meeting and I
[19:35] asked I I said brothers does second
[19:37] Timothy 2:20 let's read that does 2
[19:39] Timothy 2:20 uh mean the four classes of
[19:43] Believers and they said well I don't
[19:44] know brother Jesse I've never seen that
[19:46] before it looks like it does I just said
[19:48] amen and I knew it was right because it
[19:50] was with the word of God right because
[19:53] it's the word can't contradict itself
[19:56] right so God gave me that fresh
[19:57] Revelation I'm going read verse 19
[19:59] because it's beautiful for us
[20:01] nevertheless the foundation of God
[20:02] standeth sure having this seal the Lord
[20:05] knoweth them that are his Hallelujah and
[20:07] let everyone that nameth the name of
[20:09] Christ depart from iniquity Hallelujah
[20:11] see the church this proves you're not a
[20:13] worker of iniquity amen if you let God
[20:15] clean up your life month after month
[20:17] year after year that proves you are no
[20:19] work of iniquity you are one of the
[20:21] saved hallelujah amen because you're
[20:24] actively choosing to depart I will not
[20:27] Le live a life addicted to sin I will
[20:30] overcome sin I've given power to
[20:32] overcome sin hallelujah amen hallelujah
[20:34] I've been given Authority Hallelujah
[20:36] we've been given that power by the Holy
[20:38] Spirit praise God and God knows who you
[20:41] are Hallelujah He Knows My Name how many
[20:42] can say He Knows My Name Hallelujah he
[20:45] knows my every thought Hallelujah he
[20:47] sees each tear I cry hallelujah
[20:51] hallelujah beautiful song verse 20 and I
[20:53] remember just as a young preacher but in
[20:56] a great house there are not only vessels
[20:58] of gold
[20:59] and silver but also wooden Earth and
[21:01] some to honor and some to dishonor as
[21:03] soon as I read that struck me there's
[21:05] four there's four so here we got holy
[21:09] righteous filthy unjust gold silver wood
[21:11] Earth now we're not going to read this
[21:13] but if for you uh if you haven't read it
[21:15] go read jesus' parable about the four
[21:17] kinds of grounds that the seed falls on
[21:19] there's a good ground thorny ground
[21:21] Stony ground Wayside ground those
[21:24] grounds are there Hallelujah now Church
[21:26] the point I'm trying to make is right
[21:28] here this foolish version this this uh
[21:31] this spectrum is is is so
[21:34] wide there's people that'll be almost
[21:36] born again like they'll come to Kadesh
[21:38] but they won't cross over but there'll
[21:41] be some people that just scarcely just
[21:43] barely got saved right right after the
[21:45] right before the Rapture I'll say like
[21:47] that because brother BR tells us once
[21:49] the Rapture happens the Gentiles are cut
[21:50] off that's Romans 11 so then no whatever
[21:53] state you're in at the time of the
[21:54] Rapture that's the state you remain
[21:57] right right
[21:59] so there'll be people that get saved
[22:01] right before the Rapture and brother
[22:03] said don't worry about your children he
[22:05] said if their names are on the land's
[22:06] Book of Life they'll be filled with the
[22:08] Holy Ghost
[22:09] amen he said don't worry about it he
[22:11] said every name that's on the land's
[22:13] book of life will be born again I'll say
[22:15] like this every name on The Book of Life
[22:17] will be saved
[22:19] Hallelujah no man can come to me except
[22:21] my father Drew draws him Hallelujah and
[22:24] Jesus said I will not lose one
[22:26] Hallelujah he will not lose one name
[22:27] what a comfort that is to
[22:30] us and then church you know as I started
[22:32] studying God opens it up and we see
[22:34] Abraham and lot we see Enoch and Noah uh
[22:37] now that's a question I don't know ra
[22:38] Rachel had those Gods I think she would
[22:39] be a type of the foolish virgin she
[22:41] actually died earlier too because she
[22:43] was cursed and I wouldn't think a I
[22:44] wouldn't think a type of the wise virgin
[22:46] would be cursed it just doesn't seem
[22:49] like it's uh doesn't seem like it fits
[22:51] the the pattern of
[22:52] scripture now look and she was more
[22:54] beautiful too so see how we didn't we
[22:56] preach out on Wednesday how about how
[22:57] Beauty Beauty got
[22:59] Absalon that's a man's Beauty not even a
[23:02] woman's Beauty right we know women's
[23:04] Beauty gets a lot of women U but even a
[23:06] man's Beauty can get him if he doesn't
[23:08] take care of it but there's another one
[23:10] Lucifer of course and then Rachel she
[23:12] kind of got I don't know if the beauty
[23:14] had a part with it but we know for sure
[23:15] the idolatry was there then you see Esau
[23:18] Esau tried he repented and tried to get
[23:21] it back but it was too late right and he
[23:23] did a lot of awful things as well we
[23:25] went through the history on that from
[23:26] the Jewish uh talid and then you
[23:28] Hittites never believed in the first
[23:30] place and I like this one Mah you have
[23:32] josaphat I'm sorry Jehoshaphat Ahab and
[23:35] Jezebel you have all these in church
[23:37] there's I'm sure there's many more by
[23:39] God's grace okay now that's the
[23:40] foundation there uh how many appreciate
[23:42] a little review there by God's grace
[23:44] that's my I'm not even keeping track of
[23:45] time this morning I'm not even going to
[23:46] worry about it
[23:49] Hallelujah I got my thoughts here now
[23:51] let's go um so as I was telling some of
[23:53] you I think I was sharing on Wednesday
[23:56] night you know when that thought came to
[23:58] me about uh the secret
[24:01] Believers I remember yeah brother Ram
[24:03] called jeras a secret believer am I
[24:05] saying that right
[24:08] jerus gyrus there it is gyrus thank you
[24:12] jerus jerus it's like I put a i after
[24:16] that R gyrus okay help me if I if I
[24:18] forget forgive me gyrus now you got your
[24:20] Bibles let's read here uh Mark 5:21
[24:23] let's just read one of these you can
[24:25] kind of see the context here now I
[24:27] always told you this as some point I
[24:28] like to preach all the way through the
[24:30] four gospels I like to preach Matthew
[24:31] Mark Luke and John that's going to take
[24:33] some time and the Lord would really have
[24:35] to Tar for me to do that if it takes me
[24:37] 20 if it takes me 31 sermons to get
[24:39] through Romans it's going to take me
[24:41] about 300 to get through the gospels by
[24:43] God's grace so just you know all these
[24:45] fresh Revelations you know pop up as
[24:47] you're studying and it blesses the
[24:48] people and it's really God just feeding
[24:50] his children right it's God feeding his
[24:52] children now this A Beautiful chapter in
[24:56] verses 1 through 20 Jesus Jesus heals uh
[24:59] the maniac of G gadera right gadera he's
[25:03] got over 6,000 no I'm sorry he had more
[25:05] than that no allean was 6,000 or more
[25:08] demons he had over 6,000 demons in him
[25:11] and Jesus says one word go and they go
[25:14] so again it doesn't matter how loud you
[25:16] shout doesn't how loud you scream it's
[25:18] the faith that you have in
[25:20] Christ it's faith in Christ that makes
[25:22] the demons tremble it's not emotion I've
[25:25] had to learn that lesson too it's it's
[25:26] not how loud I scream Dre now it is how
[25:30] sincere I am but how sincerely right I
[25:32] am because you can be sincere and
[25:34] sincerely wrong right so you have to
[25:38] have sincerity and
[25:40] truth and uh then you know as The Story
[25:42] Goes verse
[25:47] 21 and when Jesus was passed over again
[25:50] by ship unto the other side much people
[25:52] gathered unto him and he was nigh unto
[25:53] the sea and behold there cometh one of
[25:56] the Elders of the synagogue gyrus by
[25:59] name and when he saw him he fell at his
[26:01] feet now here we get to see he was a
[26:04] ruler of a synagogue now synagogue is a
[26:06] lot like a local church it was like the
[26:08] Jewish synagogue where it was like a a
[26:10] building where they would go and the
[26:11] Jews set it up to kind of have just a
[26:13] place that was close to them so they
[26:15] could go worship together on Saturdays
[26:17] right and they would know it's it's like
[26:19] in Luke 4 Jesus got up he read uh the
[26:22] scroll he sat down of course it would
[26:24] have been laid out on a table but then
[26:25] he sat down so that was their they would
[26:27] do songs no doubt they do prayers like
[26:29] we do no doubt they do their Bible
[26:30] reading uh they would read Moses you
[26:33] know they'd read their Prophet
[26:36] Hallelujah uh and gyrus was one of the
[26:39] rulers so brother R kind of dramatizes
[26:42] maybe he's like the
[26:43] pastor so he's like a pastor of a Jewish
[26:46] church but brother Ram said he's like a
[26:48] secret believer in
[26:50] Jesus right because Jesus was like this
[26:52] Rebel priest you know we heard that song
[26:54] One Sunday's coming he was like a rebel
[26:56] priest he was calling all the the
[26:58] regular priests uh you know vipers
[27:00] serpents Snakes in the Grass he he was
[27:04] saying they're Hypocrites they only like
[27:05] to be greeted in public with their fancy
[27:07] titles and they only like to wear nice
[27:10] new
[27:11] clothing n Jesus uh tore them
[27:15] up now verse 22 we see he's so he's so
[27:20] in need of God that he falls at jesus'
[27:24] feet now notice God doesn't correct him
[27:27] because Jesus was
[27:30] God remember Cornelius fell at Peter's
[27:32] feet what' Peter say get up right
[27:36] remember in revelation 22 uh John falls
[27:39] down at the feet of this this Angel
[27:41] messenger and Angel messenger says getet
[27:43] up Peter I'm sorry no get up John right
[27:45] get up John so this proves Jesus was
[27:48] more than a man Hallelujah he was God
[27:51] and man Hallelujah he was the god man
[27:55] verse 23 and besought him greatly saying
[27:57] my little daughter lith at the point of
[27:59] death I pray theee come and lay thy
[28:01] hands on her that she may be healed and
[28:04] she may and she shall live and Jesus
[28:06] went with him and much people fed him
[28:08] and thronged
[28:10] him this is what I love about Jesus even
[28:12] as he's going about just just just going
[28:14] about his ministry he's even on the way
[28:16] to Healing he's healing right all the
[28:20] time wherever he's going Jesus
[28:21] constantly healing and ministering to
[28:23] people all along the way praise God and
[28:26] he and look he had enough time to do
[28:28] that by God's grace he had enough time
[28:30] he knew he was going to go heal gyrus
[28:32] his daughter but even going along there
[28:34] he could heal this one he could heal
[28:35] that one all along the way he was
[28:37] healing people thank God for that type
[28:39] of Savior amen church we should know
[28:42] that Jesus at any moment can stop down
[28:44] in our little busy life and minister to
[28:46] our needs too praise God he's got enough
[28:48] time amen hallelujah he's got enough
[28:50] time
[28:52] amen we just got to call on him right we
[28:54] just got to go to him draw nigh to him
[28:56] sometimes now sometimes you can't do it
[28:57] some times God will come to you but here
[28:59] as we see in the scripture uh here many
[29:01] times people went to him they drew nigh
[29:04] to God and then God would draw nigh to
[29:10] them verse 25 and a certain woman which
[29:13] had an issue of blood 12 years imagine
[29:15] that 12 years God why is why isn't my
[29:17] prayer been answered it's been 12 years
[29:19] because God has a perfect time and
[29:21] season and notice she didn't give up
[29:23] after 12 years and the church said
[29:26] Church don't give up on God Amen
[29:28] don't give up on God there's another one
[29:30] he was she was bleeding 38 years or I'm
[29:32] sorry the man was paralyzed 38
[29:35] years God help us may God strengthen us
[29:38] may God encourage us not to give up
[29:40] Hallelujah remember God's writing a
[29:42] story he's the author and finisher of
[29:44] your story Hallelujah this was part of
[29:46] the woman's story you know she's uh like
[29:50] I was talking to that young brother uh I
[29:52] saw Pastor Paul Jackson a couple weeks
[29:53] ago I was talking to his oldest son RJ
[29:55] and he you know last year when we were
[29:57] there he heard his one leg leg well we
[29:58] went back and he hurt his other leg and
[29:59] I said R.J don't fret this is all part
[30:01] of God's story you have to accept this
[30:04] God allowed this you know he was trying
[30:07] to play semi-pro football and had all
[30:08] these dreams I said don't give up your
[30:10] dreams God might be in that too you
[30:11] never know but you have to accept this
[30:13] God allowed this this is part of my
[30:15] story God was this didn't surprise God
[30:19] right God said let you wake up that
[30:20] morning and let you go and before you
[30:22] got heard and all those things God was
[30:24] with you before God's with you now he'll
[30:26] always be with you praise God
[30:28] it's part of your story we got to
[30:31] understand our story remember the queen
[30:32] of basba her whole story was to cross
[30:34] the desert and be ready to pour out her
[30:38] support on the ministry of the hour amen
[30:41] her whole life was building to that amen
[30:44] her whole life was just being able to
[30:46] cross the desert and to go support the
[30:48] man of God I mean that was what her
[30:51] whole story was and God will use her on
[30:53] the day of judgment for that praise God
[30:55] hallelujah that was her major
[30:58] uh goal she had to accomplish in her
[31:00] life church what's your major goal you
[31:02] have to accomplish in life you might
[31:04] have already passed it you might not
[31:07] have the main thing to do is trust God
[31:09] serve God support the message of the
[31:12] hour with all your heart praise God
[31:15] recognize you might have to wait 12
[31:16] years 25 38 like Abraham 25 right you
[31:20] might have to wait many years remember
[31:22] Anna and uh Anna and Zechariah no it
[31:25] wasn't Ze no it wasn't Zechariah Simeon
[31:27] Anna and Simeon they serve God fasting
[31:30] and praying in the temple for
[31:33] decades 70 60 60 years praying and
[31:37] fasting waiting for what for what all
[31:39] these years the devil could said you did
[31:40] it for nothing you did it for nothing
[31:42] but God had a special testimony at their
[31:44] end of their life they would see the
[31:46] Lord's salvation amen not just by faith
[31:49] they'd see it by sight hallelujah amen
[31:51] they would see the Lord's salvation with
[31:53] their own eyes was it worth it all every
[31:55] prayer was worth it was every fasting
[31:57] worth wor it every Miss meal was worth
[31:59] it why cuz God has a story God's writing
[32:02] a song this is my story this is my song
[32:05] your duty is to praise God all the day
[32:07] long praise
[32:12] God 12 years of bleeding verse 26 and it
[32:16] suffered many things of many
[32:18] Physicians so she could have said I was
[32:20] hurt by that preacher I'll say like that
[32:23] I was hurt by that song leader I was
[32:25] hurt by that Deacon I was hurt by that
[32:28] school teacher I was hurt by that
[32:29] professor she could have said I was hurt
[32:31] I was hurt I was hurt I was hurt she
[32:33] could had all these excuses to sit at
[32:35] home and not go see Jesus ah but Church
[32:37] who brought us here God brought us here
[32:39] to meet Jesus
[32:41] amen she wasn't hurt one time she was
[32:44] hurt many
[32:46] times see Church you have to understand
[32:49] God's writing a story in your life and
[32:52] God will not give you something you
[32:53] can't
[32:55] handle Hallelujah though you st stumble
[32:58] and fall get up again because I Stumble
[33:01] fall we all stumble and fall am many
[33:05] doctors had let her down but she's about
[33:07] to get to the right doctor amen this
[33:09] doctor wasn't going to let her down amen
[33:11] this doctor was going to lift her up
[33:13] Hallelujah in more ways than one

[33:19] she had she' wasted all of her money she
[33:20] could say they've hurt me they' stolen
[33:22] money from me they've done every evil
[33:24] thing to me but still she said I can't I
[33:26] can't uh look at what commands unto me
[33:28] I've got to trust in God
[33:30] hallelujah I won't let my life just go
[33:33] to a despair of all the pain and the
[33:35] lost the money I've lost the people that
[33:37] discouraged me I won't let that Define
[33:39] my life I'm going to get to Jesus I'm
[33:42] going to let Jesus redefine my life amen

[33:47] her this morning amen this is all kind
[33:49] of fresh amen hallelujah that's not of
[33:52] my
[33:54] notes and she got nothing better but
[33:56] worse so all she could say for 12 years
[33:59] I've been going and I only get worse
[34:00] after 12 years that's part of the
[34:03] story because God was going to heal her
[34:05] and make this part part of her
[34:09] testimony that now our sister can come
[34:11] up our sister with the blood issue now
[34:12] she can come up and say my my my sick
[34:14] friend let me pray for you that's okay
[34:17] if God didn't hear you just stay with
[34:18] Jesus I waited 12 years and may God give
[34:22] you patience to get through your
[34:24] trial
[34:26] right that that's a test testimony of
[34:28] Faith that's right amen see now that
[34:30] she'd overcome 12 years now she can
[34:33] minister to somebody else amen amen
[34:36] hallelujah that's why you go through
[34:37] trials so you can minister to people
[34:40] that have similar trials that's right
[34:42] and you can also feel uh you can also
[34:44] feel for them brother B said you'll do
[34:46] the most effective prayer when you have
[34:47] a feeling for the person you're praying
[34:50] for that's when you'll be most sincere
[34:52] in your prayers that's why it's one
[34:54] reason we got to suffer sometimes
[34:57] when she'd heard of Jesus came in in the
[35:00] press behind and touched His Garment
[35:01] verse 27 verse 28 for she said if I may
[35:03] touch but his clothes I shall be whole
[35:05] and straightway the Fountain of her
[35:06] blood was dried up and she felt in her
[35:08] body that she was healed of that plague
[35:11] amen sometimes God lets you feel it
[35:13] praise God sometimes he'll let you feel
[35:15] it other times you won't like that
[35:17] brother Danny out there in in Iowa he
[35:18] said while he was driving he realized
[35:20] the tingling was
[35:22] gone he said darling what should I do
[35:24] start praising God you can praise God
[35:27] while you're driving I've done it before
[35:29] now sometimes I get a little loose on my
[35:31] driving so I got to correct
[35:32] myself we all do that sometimes right
[35:35] you got to be careful but praise God
[35:38] worship God for what he's
[35:41] done verse 30 and Jesus immediately
[35:44] knowing in himself that virtue had gone
[35:46] out of him touched him about in the
[35:48] press and said who touched my clothes
[35:51] see here again Jesus didn't know all
[35:52] things his human body didn't know all
[35:54] things the god inside of him knows all
[35:57] things
[35:58] right because it's God it's ch I'm sorry
[36:00] it's God was in Christ reconciling the
[36:01] world himself but even Jesus's human
[36:03] mind and uh it didn't understand didn't
[36:06] know all things because he wasn't lying
[36:08] Jesus never would lie he wouldn't say
[36:09] who touched me but I know who touched
[36:12] me and his disciples said unto him thou
[36:15] seest the multitude thronging thee and
[36:17] sayest thou who touched me and he looked
[36:19] round about to see her that had done
[36:20] this thing but the woman fearing and
[36:22] trembling knowing what was done in her
[36:24] came and fell down before him and told
[36:26] him all the truth now this is what I
[36:28] love I love the Bible said she felt it
[36:30] in
[36:31] herself and then she knew in herself
[36:35] what had been done in her I think that's
[36:37] a beautiful statement if God's ever
[36:39] healed you you know what's happened in
[36:41] your body and you know you're
[36:44] better but let's apply that spiritually
[36:47] amen how many know in your so in your
[36:49] mind and in your soul you feel different
[36:51] than you used to Amen in other words you
[36:54] know what Jesus has done inside of you
[36:56] amen you don't need anybody to tell you
[36:59] about it you don't need to tell anybody
[37:00] about their experience you've got your
[37:02] own experience amen I know how I felt I
[37:05] know I was lost I know I was depressed I
[37:08] know I was discouraged I know I was
[37:10] hurting but Jesus did something in me
[37:12] and now I can tell somebody about it I
[37:14] can feel the difference
[37:16] amen glory amen I can feel the
[37:20] difference praise God let me testify
[37:23] when is it my turn to
[37:25] testify that's what I feel like when I'm
[37:26] around these uh other believers that are
[37:29] non- message people I'm like when's it
[37:30] my turn to
[37:32] testify give me a turn you need somebody
[37:34] to testify I'll go testify when is it my
[37:36] turn to
[37:38] speak Hallelujah I know what's done
[37:40] inside of me I know the change the Bible
[37:44] said I was dead in
[37:47] sins but that means now I'm alive in
[37:50] Holiness
[37:52] Hallelujah Glory if I was dead in sin
[37:55] now I'm alive in righteousness
[37:58] hallelujah oh hallelujah thank you Jesus
[38:02] amen
[38:04] hallelujah virtue went out of him I've
[38:08] had many a service where I left here
[38:09] really really tired and not because I
[38:11] didn't sleep well but because somebody
[38:12] got healed somebody got ministered to
[38:15] I've been many a Monday at work when I
[38:17] have to battle falling asleep because
[38:18] I'm so tired after preaching
[38:20] twice and virtues gone out from me
[38:23] praise God right it sometimes it
[38:25] surprises me I'm like oh am I so tired I
[38:27] got remember that's right somebody's
[38:28] prayer got
[38:29] answered Hallelujah that's right church
[38:32] that's what Jesus said we know Jesus had
[38:35] virtue God of
[38:38] him now he's go goes on to say in verse
[38:41] 34 daughter thy faith hath made thee
[38:43] whole in other words thy Revelation how
[38:45] many appreciate that remember the story
[38:47] she knew if she could just go Touch the
[38:50] Hem of His Garment she'd be made well
[38:52] that's called Revelation that's right
[38:54] God revealed or made known how she was
[38:57] going to be
[38:57] healed so she went with that leading I
[39:00] just know it I don't know how I know it
[39:01] but I know it amen God let me know about
[39:04] it amen and so Jesus says your faith
[39:07] your Revelation has made you whole and
[39:09] that backs up what brother Ram taught
[39:10] and Fa faith is Works expressed you can
[39:12] plead to God you can ask God you can
[39:14] hope all you want you're not going to be
[39:16] made well but as soon as you get that
[39:18] Revelation you're going to be well
[39:19] hallelujah amen because it's got to be
[39:22] in God's time and season praise God so
[39:25] this was her time and season think of
[39:26] that 12 years she had to wait for God's
[39:29] time and season do you think it was
[39:30] worth a
[39:31] wait hallelujah it's always worth a wait
[39:38] always Glory now I'm not gonna like I
[39:41] said I'm not going to read all that
[39:43] verse 35 so while jaras I'm sorry gyrus
[39:46] I keep saying wrong while gyrus is
[39:48] seeing these healings and seeing these
[39:50] amazing things going
[39:52] on while he yet spake there came from
[39:54] the ruler of the synagogue's house
[39:55] certain which said thy daughter is dead
[39:57] why troubles thou the master any
[40:00] further and as soon as Jesus heard the
[40:02] word that was spoken he saith un the
[40:04] ruler of synagogue Be not Afraid only
[40:07] believe look how the enemy in the midst
[40:09] of all these Miracles the enemy will try
[40:11] to bring in
[40:12] doubt by love this who speaks up who
[40:14] keeps the who keeps gyrus Faith high
[40:17] it's Jesus Hallelujah who's going to
[40:19] encourage your faith Jesus hallelujah
[40:22] amen who's going to keep you believing
[40:24] for your Miracle Jesus is going to do
[40:26] that
[40:27] Hallelujah there'll be people try to
[40:29] discourage and events of life it seem
[40:31] like it not going to work out but don't
[40:33] trust in man trust in God hallelujah
[40:36] hallelujah believe he said only believe
[40:39] and brother said he was walking down the
[40:40] road singing only
[40:42] believe amen the Bible said believe only
[40:45] but brother man said he was saying only
[40:47] believe only believe all things are
[40:51] possible only believe that brother Danny
[40:55] he knows he only has to believe that
[40:57] sister got healed of her heart condition
[40:59] she knows she only has to believe how
[41:01] many here know you only have to
[41:04] believe pray to God seek God get the
[41:07] Revelation and just believe God's
[41:09] revelation hallelujah amen just believe
[41:12] God's revelation amen that's right it's
[41:15] a
[41:18] revelation and he suffered no man to
[41:20] follow him say Peter and James and John
[41:22] the brother of of James and he come to
[41:26] the house of the ruler of the synagog go
[41:27] and seeth the tumult and them that wept
[41:30] and wailed greatly so you have people
[41:33] you have tumult you have you have
[41:34] weeping and you have wailing and and
[41:36] brother man said look the atmosphere is
[41:39] not in the condition it needs to be in
[41:40] for a miracle if you want a miracle
[41:43] brother R said you got to change the
[41:45] atmosphere that's right hallelujah
[41:47] praise God Amen that's why we usually
[41:50] wait right to the end of service to pray
[41:52] for the sick people because the
[41:54] atmosphere is at the spot where we can
[41:56] believe
[41:58] we come out of out of the world and
[41:59] we're discouraged or we're sad or we're
[42:01] we're angry uh or or we're fearful right
[42:04] we come out of the world with all at
[42:05] least but thank God we got it to church
[42:07] by God's grace amen despite our mind
[42:09] battles and so forth thank God we get
[42:11] here but then it takes singing it takes
[42:13] worship it takes prayer it takes the
[42:15] holy spirit being uh preached through
[42:17] the word of God and it brings us to a
[42:19] spot where we can receive God's word
[42:21] where the atmosphere can change where
[42:23] God can minister to the needs hallelujah
[42:25] we're finally in a spot where we can
[42:27] receive it
[42:28] hallelujah

[42:33] get it before church like remember
[42:35] Johnny got healed up here of his ankle
[42:37] swelling he said he came to church God
[42:39] told him if brother Jesse curses that
[42:41] you'll get better that's what he told me
[42:44] remember sister uh uh Marie when she got
[42:47] healed of her blood issue I remember her
[42:49] walking in that door and going straight
[42:51] down she was so happy she's like I'm so
[42:53] happy to be in church today I think she
[42:54] was by herself that that day with
[42:56] another friend and and that's the day
[42:57] God healed her when we preached five
[42:59] identifications of the true church she
[43:01] walked into church with the Revelation
[43:03] amen that works but you can also get a
[43:06] revelation right in church amen it

[43:12] people none of those people that got
[43:13] healed I said whatever you do go back to
[43:16] your seat and keep praising God don't
[43:18] let doubt come in now what a lesson that
[43:21] is with the while the man's driving away
[43:23] he gets healed on the drive amen it
[43:26] wasn't going to come in here but he had
[43:28] to keep praising God keep believing God
[43:30] keep trusting God Hallelujah the wind's

[44:35] day that's
[44:38] right there's days we got to go through
[44:40] suffering trials
[44:43] growth but there are days when the
[44:45] supernatural blows to the church
[44:47] hallelujah thank God for
[44:50] that verse 39 and when he was coming he
[44:53] saith un him why make you this a do and
[44:55] Weep the damsel is not dead but sleepeth
[44:58] there he's speaking by
[45:00] Revelation right because she was dead
[45:02] she was separated right but Jesus is
[45:04] speaking by Revelation she's going to be
[45:06] made
[45:07] well and they laughed him to scorn and
[45:10] when he had put them all out he taketh
[45:12] the father and the mother of the damsel
[45:14] and them that were with him and entered
[45:15] in where the damsel was lying now this
[45:17] is all getting to a secret believer he
[45:19] I'll say like this he was a secret
[45:21] believer but after this he was no longer
[45:23] a secret believer Hallelujah that's
[45:26] right
[45:27] and he took the damsel by the hand and
[45:29] saith unto her talith Kumai now that's a
[45:33] Syrian word so he wasn't speaking in
[45:36] Hebrew in that case he was speaking
[45:38] Syrian in another language that's why he
[45:40] was speaking the language of the people
[45:42] right so that's why they have to give
[45:45] you the interpretation which is being
[45:46] interpreted damsel I say unto thee arise
[45:49] and straightway the damsel Rose and
[45:51] walked for she was of the age of 12
[45:53] years and they were astonished with a
[45:55] great astonishment and he charged them
[45:57] straightly that no man should know it
[45:59] and commanded
[46:01] that something should be given her to
[46:04] eat amen now I did a lot of reading
[46:07] there gyrus means whom God enlightens
[46:10] and isn't that the isn't that the uh the
[46:12] example of his life didn't Jesus
[46:15] Enlighten him with his
[46:17] power there was there's death in the
[46:19] house amen there's death there's
[46:21] darkness in the house but God anointed
[46:23] gyrus with faith amen and when he had
[46:26] that Faith he he ran to Jesus he brought
[46:28] Jesus to the house and then life entered

[49:00] preached 17 times to these former Amish
[49:03] people and their greatest fear they
[49:05] still battle to this day is fearing
[49:08] man their P the the Amish Pastor is like
[49:12] God if you go one thing against his inch
[49:15] and a half Book of Rules outside the

[49:24] have a horse of that color uh I I can't
[49:27] I have to be sprinkled I can't be buried
[49:30] don't believe in Divine Healing they

[49:34] imagine the freedom that they now feel
[49:37] now that they they get to they get to
[49:38] take those papers and throw them in the
[49:40] trash can throw a couple matches in
[49:42] there
[49:44] too all that legalism it's burned up but
[49:47] they still to this day there's times
[49:49] they come up and say brother Jesse pray
[49:50] for me that will not come under the
[49:52] spirit of
[49:53] fear and the spirit of man see those
[49:57] demons are territorial

[50:24] of man or fear of anybody discourage us
[50:27] from obeying the word of God hallelujah
[50:30] I love what brother ra said I've said it
[50:31] before but if you ever go into a meeting
[50:33] or if you ever got trouble with somebody

[50:43] because he'd been in the presence of
[50:45] somebody greater amen hallelujah so
[50:48] friends let's fast and pray let's seek
[50:51] God so that no matter who we have to

[52:31] church said no wonder Jesus said
[52:34] scarcely a rich man can enter the Gates
[52:37] of
[52:38] Heaven and the Bible said it's easier
[52:41] for a camel to get through a eye of a
[52:43] needle think of a needle you seers or
[52:45] you uh what do they call it
[52:48] seamstresses think of that hole for a
[52:51] camel to get through that hole that's
[52:53] how hard it is for a rich man to get to
[52:55] heaven because his God is his
[52:58] money is that right church I'm talking
[53:00] about Americans I'm talking about you
[53:01] and me we can't trust in money we got to
[53:04] trust in the Living God we got to be
[53:07] like we got to be ready to say like job
[53:08] if he takes everything away from me then
[53:10] the Lord took it away the lord gave it
[53:12] to me he took it away blessed be the
[53:15] name of the
[53:16] Lord we need Faith Like That
[53:22] Hallelujah now brother R is dramatizing
[53:24] the story I'm just kind of going back in
[53:25] the story he said your child's going to
[53:29] die he said but the time had come for
[53:32] Action not wait till I see Jesus again
[53:34] or wait till a convenient time or some
[53:36] night I'll slip over and listen at him
[53:37] but the time to come for Action if there
[53:39] ever was a Time come for action it's now
[53:41] amen see so God brought gyrus to a spot
[53:44] he had to make an action his daughter's
[53:46] dead what's he going to do I'm sorry no
[53:48] he she hadn't died yet but she was
[53:49] dying see that perhaps somebody had
[53:53] already told him that Jesus was coming
[53:54] did anybody ever tell you that Jesus is
[53:56] coming coming at the same time he was
[53:58] crossing the Red Sea I'm sorry crossing
[54:00] the Sea of Galilee getting to him God
[54:02] always puts his men there just at the
[54:04] right
[54:05] time God sent Paul and Aaron and brother
[54:08] Dennis at just the right time how many
[54:10] believe
[54:14] that I'm G to skip
[54:17] ahead but jerus once he got in contact
[54:20] with Jesus he was a different
[54:22] man right he was able to just stay with
[54:25] Jesus he just saw the Miracles he just
[54:27] stayed with Jesus he became a different
[54:29] man so the secret believer became a
[54:31] public
[54:34] believer all right I gotta I got to move
[54:37] ahead not like this brother said I can
[54:39] see Jesus look around at Gus's house and
[54:41] say now father mother you come with me
[54:43] and Peter James and John you come too
[54:46] faith hope and charity you come along
[54:48] with me so Peter James and John
[54:51] represent faith hope and charity and
[54:53] brother Bram uses that in a spiritual
[54:55] way if there's to if there's tumult if
[54:57] there's doubt if there's fear if there
[54:59] there's evil spirits you got to get rid
[55:01] of that by having faith hope and charity
[55:05] and you got to change the atmosphere
[55:07] with faith hope and charity because all
[55:09] things are possible with faith hope and
[55:11] charity
[55:12] Hallelujah that's right brother brother
[55:15] mam gives that spiritual application
[55:17] there to Peter James and
[55:20] John
[55:24] Hallelujah now just so you know here's
[55:27] one point you'll listen to it brother R
[55:29] says it mainly at the beginning of his
[55:30] ministry but whenever the the Bible say
[55:33] you know Jesus used a different language
[55:35] and then it's interpreted brother Bram
[55:37] thought at the beginning it meant he was
[55:38] speaking in unknown
[55:40] tongues okay so brother Bram didn't
[55:42] understand so when we read that where he
[55:44] said uh talitha
[55:47] Kumi brother Ram thought at the
[55:49] beginning because he he had studied a
[55:50] whole lot he thought that was was Jesus
[55:53] speaking in unknown tongues but that's
[55:55] not exactly what it was it was a mixture
[55:58] of cyak and Chi called syyro syyro ciac
[56:05] okay so other words Jesus wasn't
[56:06] speaking in Hebrew to gyrus and his
[56:08] family he was speaking more in this
[56:10] common
[56:11] language
[56:14] okay I hope that doesn't uh uh confuse
[56:17] anybody but I'm just making the point uh
[56:19] because at one point Jesus or at one
[56:21] point brother Bram said when Jesus was
[56:23] on the cross and he said uh my God my
[56:26] God why has thou why has Thou forsaken
[56:28] me brother Ram said that was Jesus
[56:30] speaking in an unknown tongue on the
[56:31] cross but we know that's not the case
[56:34] because brother grew it he grew in the
[56:36] understanding and it was actually
[56:37] speaking in the common
[56:39] tongue right and that's why the Bible
[56:41] had to interpret it because it uh It Was
[56:43] Written in this uh Greek but it had to
[56:45] take this syro calic and put it into the
[56:48] Greek and then eventually got to
[56:50] English okay just laying that out there
[56:52] by God's grace all
[56:54] right brother said there's so many
[56:56] secret Believers today I think I read
[56:57] this
[56:58] one but I'm going to read
[57:01] again he was a secret believer he loved
[57:04] Jesus you know when a man gets in that
[57:06] shape sometime God brings him to The
[57:09] Showdown it's in distress when we really
[57:12] show our colors what we really are right
[57:15] now I'm talking about this now listen
[57:17] I'm talking about if you're a wise
[57:18] virgin God will bring you to a spot
[57:21] where you will Show Your Colors I'm a
[57:22] real believer amen right
[57:27] or if you're a foolish virgin God but
[57:29] you're see but you're a secret believer
[57:31] God will orchestrate the events of your
[57:32] life well you you'll finally take a
[57:34] public
[57:36] stand just you just won't pray in your
[57:38] own house or your own closet and then be
[57:40] afraid to talk about Jesus at some point
[57:43] you're going to have to make a stand and
[57:44] church the foolish virgin will after the
[57:46] Rapture they'll have to give their lives
[57:49] and not take the mark of the
[57:50] beast another proof look lot had to make
[57:53] a stand he had to say this is wicked
[57:55] this is abomination don't do
[57:58] this God brings the event church I'm
[58:00] saying something here God brings the
[58:02] events of our lives in 2024 God's going
[58:04] to bring the events of our lives and
[58:06] we'll have to decide which side we want
[58:07] to be on let's be on the side of the
[58:09] Holy Ghost filled Believers amen am
[58:12] let's let the trials of our lives and
[58:14] our reaction and our response let it be
[58:17] that we run to Jesus in our times of
[58:19] trouble we run to Jesus we're unashamed
[58:21] of Jesus and we bring Jesus into our
[58:24] life right we bring him back into our
[58:25] life and Jesus does Supernatural things
[58:28] for us like
[58:30] gyrus
[58:34] Hallelujah see God's gonna we're all
[58:36] I'll say like this we're all going to
[58:38] see our true
[58:39] colors Hallelujah brother William if
[58:42] anybody's seen it brother William and
[58:43] sister beatric have seen brother Jose
[58:46] got more experience people you might
[58:48] have thought for decades wow they're
[58:50] really believer turn out not to be I've
[58:53] seen it just you know in a public way
[58:55] and also church people been the message
[58:58] 40 years all of a sudden turn on the
[58:59] message no longer believe it they're
[59:01] either insane and saved or they're lost
[59:04] and they they they they forfeit their
[59:05] salvation but clearly they're not born
[59:07] again
[59:09] clearly when you're born again the Bible
[59:12] said Hallelujah you depart from all
[59:14] iniquity amen God knows them that are
[59:17] his
[59:18] Hallelujah and the Bible said they went
[59:20] out from us that includes foolish virgin
[59:22] and the make believer they went out from
[59:24] us because they were not of us
[59:26] Hallelujah see the Holy Ghost filled
[59:28] Believers will stick together despite
[59:30] trials tests sicknesses amen diseases
[59:33] all these things no no matter what goes
[59:35] on the Holy Ghost filled Saints will
[59:37] stick together because uh we know sheep
[59:39] flock together Hallelujah birds of a
[59:41] feather e of a feather flock together
[59:45] Hallelujah but God is going to make sure
[59:47] our true colors shine so everybody sees
[59:50] which side we're on how many on the
[59:52] Lord's Side
[59:54] today I never got to preach that but
[59:56] brother and preach that in the message
[59:57] of Grace it was that Moses part I missed
[59:59] a couple Wednesday nights ago when we
[1:00:00] had our sweet visitor page back there I
[1:00:02] didn't want to go into that cuz that
[1:00:04] might confuse her a little bit but
[1:00:05] brother Bram
[1:00:07] said brother Bram indicted the
[1:00:09] generation and he said this generation's
[1:00:12] guilty of crucifying the word they
[1:00:14] crucify women with long hair they
[1:00:17] crucify the water baptism in the name of
[1:00:20] the Lord Jesus Christ They Crucified
[1:00:22] God's one person and brother said I
[1:00:24] stand like Moses and he said he who's on
[1:00:27] the Lord's Side let him come and stand
[1:00:29] with me and this
[1:00:31] word hallelujah because remember Moses
[1:00:34] did that when he and Joshua come down
[1:00:36] from the mountain and everybody was
[1:00:37] dancing a filthy rock and roll and the
[1:00:40] church
[1:00:41] said he said he that's on the Lord's
[1:00:43] Side let him come stand with me in this
[1:00:45] word and brother man said if you come
[1:00:46] stand with me I'll meet you in the
[1:00:49] morning he said I say in the name of
[1:00:51] Jesus Christ come stand with me in this
[1:00:53] word and this Revelation the group that
[1:00:55] doesn't crucify the word they crucify
[1:00:57] the lust of the Flesh and the affections
[1:00:59] thereof this is the Lord's Side I'm glad
[1:01:02] to be on the Lord's Side
[1:01:04] amen come stand with me on the Lord's
[1:01:06] Side Hallelujah because you got two
[1:01:09] sides in the church got the church
[1:01:11] that's dancing playing along dirty
[1:01:13] filthy things but then you got the side
[1:01:15] that knows what's right and they're
[1:01:17] standing on the truth oh they're
[1:01:19] standing with the prophet of
[1:01:21] God
[1:01:24] hallelujah brother R says it in another
[1:01:26] way this might help you too that's why I
[1:01:27] thought I wouldn't show these if I
[1:01:28] didn't think if I didn't think it would
[1:01:29] help you I want to help you by God's
[1:01:31] grace I've always thought that gyrus was
[1:01:33] a secret believer he believed in his
[1:01:35] heart kind of a borderline believer now
[1:01:38] just so you know brother ram calls Jesus
[1:01:39] God's Eternal son but remember in the
[1:01:41] church age book brother Ram corrected
[1:01:43] that so I'm giving you a good lesson on
[1:01:45] rightly dividing the word of
[1:01:46] truth brother said Eternal son the word
[1:01:49] son already it based upon the definition
[1:01:52] says you had a beginning you came out of
[1:01:54] your father so brother man said Jesus
[1:01:56] can't be the Eternal son because a son
[1:01:59] has a
[1:02:00] beginning everybody with
[1:02:03] me it might be a little
[1:02:05] deep so then we find out if a man's
[1:02:08] really sincere in his heart because let
[1:02:10] me get back to that that's a trinitarian
[1:02:12] Dogma that's a trinitarian word look it
[1:02:15] up in your Bible look it up type in uh
[1:02:17] Eternal son so you just got to go to
[1:02:20] your app
[1:02:24] right there's no that say Eternal Son of
[1:02:28] God
[1:02:30] none there's a there's scriptures that
[1:02:32] say God's given us eternal life and this
[1:02:34] life is in his son but there's no verse
[1:02:36] that said Jesus is the third or the
[1:02:38] second person the Eternal Son of God you
[1:02:40] won't find it in the Bible that's a
[1:02:42] man-made Creed right that's a
[1:02:44] contradiction a son has has to have a
[1:02:46] father has to have a beginning a son
[1:02:48] came out of
[1:02:49] somebody a son's not Eternal the church
[1:02:52] said we find out if a man's really
[1:02:54] sincere in his heart God will work
[1:02:56] something around so that he will have to
[1:02:58] make his color shine God usually does
[1:03:00] that at
[1:03:01] times Hallelujah God's not going to let
[1:03:04] you just be a secret kind of believer
[1:03:06] God's going to bring uh events and
[1:03:08] situations to show everybody which side
[1:03:10] you're
[1:03:12] on he did it with
[1:03:14] Co look how many people fell out of
[1:03:16] church during Co and haven't come back
[1:03:20] is showed their colors I'm glad I'm
[1:03:23] still in the house of God am this is
[1:03:25] where judgement starts
[1:03:28] now in this in this quote I want you to
[1:03:30] be careful God doesn't force himself on
[1:03:32] others but he forces each person to
[1:03:34] decide which side they're
[1:03:36] on just don't s what his words here
[1:03:38] gyrus he was a Seeker believer down in
[1:03:40] his heart he believed that was the son
[1:03:41] of God he was thoroughly convinced it
[1:03:43] was you know isn't that strange God
[1:03:45] forced him to the issue God knows how to
[1:03:46] force you to the
[1:03:48] issue sometimes he gives you sickness
[1:03:51] and everything else Lord why I'm sick
[1:03:54] and I got this problem and I got that
[1:03:56] Pro and that God brings all that just to
[1:03:59] bring you to a force to show your color
[1:04:01] to make you decide which side you're
[1:04:03] going to stand on Amen but I've already
[1:04:06] decided I'm standing on the side of the
[1:04:07] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:14] Hallelujah see said gyrus had probably
[1:04:16] been studying the scriptures he was a
[1:04:18] secret believer he was the ruler of the
[1:04:21] synagogue that means he had the keys to
[1:04:23] the church he could go in there anytime
[1:04:25] time he wants I'd like to unroll this
[1:04:28] scroll then when he saw that oh he saw
[1:04:30] Jesus that's that this is that like
[1:04:33] Peter said this is that
[1:04:35] Hallelujah he probably studied the
[1:04:37] Scrolls and see where Jesus met all
[1:04:39] those requirements and he was that
[1:04:40] Prophet That was supposed to be raised
[1:04:41] up according to Moses that was
[1:04:42] Deuteronomy 18 but he couldn't make his
[1:04:44] confession because anybody that made a
[1:04:46] confession that had been with uh been
[1:04:48] out with Jesus well right then they was
[1:04:51] ex
[1:04:52] communicated now I don't think he was a
[1:04:54] priest but he was a ruler of the
[1:04:55] synagogue could have been a priest I
[1:04:56] don't know but the Bible just calls him
[1:04:57] a ruler of the
[1:04:59] synagogue remember synagogue wasn't the
[1:05:01] Temple of Herod totally different Temple
[1:05:03] of Herod was massive huge that's where
[1:05:05] uh the high priest was this is just like
[1:05:07] a little local church this is like a
[1:05:10] little local church in akan Ohio the
[1:05:12] small little humble place a little flock
[1:05:16] brother that's all it is that it's not
[1:05:18] some great big place it's a small humble
[1:05:20] little gathering of
[1:05:22] Believers and then of course you know
[1:05:24] brother called Nicodemus a secret
[1:05:26] believer that's what we read today now
[1:05:28] we read John 3 now notice he's a secret
[1:05:30] believer when does he come to Jesus by
[1:05:33] nighttime and like I said to you some
[1:05:35] people won't come to church but at night
[1:05:36] time they'll send me a text and ask
[1:05:38] about
[1:05:39] service right they'll send me an email
[1:05:41] after church how was service today
[1:05:43] brother Jesse can you pray for me I'm
[1:05:45] sick and all these things yeah I wish
[1:05:47] you would have come to
[1:05:48] church right but secret
[1:05:51] believers they won't just come out and
[1:05:53] say I'm standing with brother Austin I'm
[1:05:55] standing standing with uh brother
[1:05:56] Patrick and brother Claude I'm standing
[1:05:58] with sister who I'm standing with
[1:05:59] brother amen I'm standing with brother
[1:06:01] they just won't they don't have enough
[1:06:02] strength to come out they're afraid
[1:06:04] something that's happened right they
[1:06:07] believe but they just don't have enough
[1:06:08] Grace I'll say like this they don't have
[1:06:09] enough virtue where's virtue they don't
[1:06:11] have enough virtue to come out because
[1:06:12] that's the public strength you have see
[1:06:14] Ruth had that virtue in front of
[1:06:16] everybody she's not going to file those
[1:06:18] uh what do they call them snickle Fritz
[1:06:20] teenage boys brother BR calls it snickle
[1:06:23] Fritz you got to follow she's going to
[1:06:26] stay right with what Naomi said
[1:06:27] Hallelujah I'm stay right I'm do exactly
[1:06:29] what she said I'm going to honor the
[1:06:32] lord of the Harvest
[1:06:33] amen till he marries me Hallelujah now
[1:06:38] now remember but notice this he was a
[1:06:40] secret believer and Jesus even rebuked
[1:06:42] him he said how can I enter into my
[1:06:44] mother's womb again and be born again
[1:06:46] and Jesus said you're a master in Israel
[1:06:49] and you don't even understand these
[1:06:50] things this proves church if you're a
[1:06:52] really elect of God there's no rebuke
[1:06:54] that can turn you away from church
[1:06:57] Jesus himself rebuked Nicodemus to his
[1:06:59] face you're a
[1:07:01] master you're a Believer you're a pastor
[1:07:04] you're a song leader you're a deacon
[1:07:06] you're a trustee I'm just any any name
[1:07:07] now any name you're a mother you're
[1:07:10] you're this you're a grandfa you're a
[1:07:11] message believer all these decades and
[1:07:14] yet you don't understand this see a
[1:07:16] child of God can be corrected by God
[1:07:18] Amen because he's his child amen he
[1:07:21] knows who his dad is amen hallelujah so
[1:07:24] he can take a correction
[1:07:26] cuz he's not a bastard child he's a real
[1:07:29] child of
[1:07:31] God I'll say like this at least he
[1:07:34] came at least he sent a
[1:07:37] text at least he stopped over at our
[1:07:40] house Hallelujah they might not come to
[1:07:43] church it might not even look like it
[1:07:45] but at least they came to hear the word
[1:07:47] of God at least they come to you to try
[1:07:48] to get some prayer or something like
[1:07:51] that now I love this in John 7:50 that's
[1:07:54] right I got control here of the
[1:08:04] screen Nicodemus saith unto them he that
[1:08:07] came to Jesus by Night being one of them
[1:08:09] doth our law judge any man before it
[1:08:11] heareth him and know what he doeth they
[1:08:13] answered and said unto him art thou also
[1:08:15] of Galilee search and look for out of
[1:08:17] Galilee Rises no prophet and every man
[1:08:20] went unto his own
[1:08:23] house so see Nicodemus was standing up
[1:08:26] for him he started standing up for him
[1:08:28] here right he been to Jesus personally
[1:08:30] he went by night remember he said we
[1:08:32] know you're a teacher set from God we
[1:08:34] know the message is right we know you
[1:08:37] just preached the Bible brother Jesse we
[1:08:40] know all your doctrines come out of the
[1:08:42] Bible amen we know you're right we know
[1:08:44] you got the real Spirit of
[1:08:46] Christ but see God brought it to a point
[1:08:48] you're going to have to make a choice
[1:08:50] God's going to force you to make a
[1:08:51] decision aren't you glad he does that
[1:08:53] like we're saying God don't let people
[1:08:54] hang on the fence
[1:08:56] God God's going to push you off the
[1:08:57] fence if you don't make it well you'll
[1:08:59] jump off the fence either way Hallelujah
[1:09:02] he won't let you stay there he's going
[1:09:04] to let the winds blow and you're going
[1:09:05] to have to make a
[1:09:06] choice which side of the fence you want
[1:09:08] to be on praise God am like that one
[1:09:10] joke says the fence belongs to the devil
[1:09:12] so if you look at it like that well then
[1:09:15] you can say on the fence but the fence
[1:09:16] is the devil's he caused division
[1:09:19] anyway and then John 19:39 this is a
[1:09:22] beautiful story after Jesus Cru CR ified
[1:09:26] who's who's the one that wants his body
[1:09:29] who wants the word of God it's
[1:09:31] Nicodemus brother Austin where were his
[1:09:35] disciples you would think if anybody
[1:09:37] loved Jesus and wants his body and makes
[1:09:40] sure he gets buried it would be the
[1:09:41] disciples they ran
[1:09:44] away I'm just showing you look God
[1:09:46] brought it down to a place he had to
[1:09:48] show his
[1:09:49] colors
[1:09:52] Hallelujah now look all those Apostles
[1:09:54] the Disciples of 11 of them were going
[1:09:56] to get the Holy Ghost but they didn't
[1:09:58] have it
[1:09:59] yet but look Nicodemus had more courage
[1:10:03] in that moment he had more courage than
[1:10:06] the disciples that had been with him
[1:10:07] three and a half years Nicodemus hadn't
[1:10:09] even been with him at all and yet in
[1:10:11] that moment God allowed him to have
[1:10:13] strength God gave him a testimony praise
[1:10:16] God see when others wouldn't be there
[1:10:18] Nicodemus was there praise God that
[1:10:21] secret believer became a real believer
[1:10:23] Hallelujah
[1:10:27] sometimes in great classic Society
[1:10:28] there's secret Believers great
[1:10:30] multi-millionaires yet they're secret
[1:10:32] believers they might be
[1:10:35] Catholics they're just kindy kind of
[1:10:38] afraid to associate
[1:10:40] themselves Nicodemus was one of those
[1:10:43] type remember he was a leader of the
[1:10:45] Sanhedrin he was one of those 70 70 he
[1:10:48] was one of the most esteemed or
[1:10:49] respected men in all Israel but he came
[1:10:52] by night and said we know God's God is
[1:10:54] with you you're doing things that no man
[1:10:56] can do he was a secret
[1:11:00] believer brother said just humble
[1:11:02] yourself down always remember the Way Up
[1:11:04] Is Down With God he that humbles himself
[1:11:07] God will exalt he that exalts himself
[1:11:10] shall be brought abased just just humble
[1:11:13] down come on down get it the same way
[1:11:15] the rest of them does hallelujah just
[1:11:18] the humility we have to go to Jesus
[1:11:20] right we have to Humble
[1:11:22] ourselves now here's a little bit of
[1:11:23] history on Nicodemus
[1:11:26] oh yeah actually I'm not going to read
[1:11:27] all
[1:11:31] this yeah I just put there I read it
[1:11:33] somewhere Nicodemus was wanting the body
[1:11:35] of Jesus in the moment when the
[1:11:36] disciples were
[1:11:38] scattered see church let me just say
[1:11:40] like this see God has a special moment
[1:11:42] for you that will distinguish you from
[1:11:44] other people in other words God has a
[1:11:46] special Ministry for you that's
[1:11:47] different from
[1:11:49] me right the disciples they were going
[1:11:51] to have a beautiful ministry right they
[1:11:53] were going to have Apostles and yeah
[1:11:54] they're going to have to to die too but
[1:11:56] look here Nicodemus gets a he gets a
[1:11:59] testimony well when everybody else fell
[1:12:01] away I wanted the body of Jesus I wanted
[1:12:03] to respect the word of God he was the
[1:12:07] word right that's part of his testimony
[1:12:09] like the queen of the South Hallelujah
[1:12:11] like the woman with the blood issue
[1:12:13] that's why brother R said find yourself
[1:12:15] in the Bible Hallelujah find your
[1:12:17] testimony in the Bible Hallelujah and
[1:12:19] let that encourage your faith
[1:12:21] Hallelujah encourage you to keep
[1:12:23] pressing on because Nicodemus stood for
[1:12:25] Jesus when everybody else ran in
[1:12:28] fear what a
[1:12:30] testimony
[1:12:35] Hallelujah now here's this is
[1:12:37] interesting now I'm not saying this is
[1:12:38] true history but this is one historian
[1:12:40] said the Jewish history says that
[1:12:44] Nicodemus he was wealthy but because he
[1:12:47] became a Christian his family fell into
[1:12:49] poverty think about
[1:12:52] that he was rich but because he Jewish
[1:12:55] history says because he stood for Jesus
[1:12:57] he and his family became
[1:12:59] poor so see Church see how he would have
[1:13:02] been tempted oh you better not be a
[1:13:04] believer you better not be a message
[1:13:05] believer you're going to lose all your
[1:13:06] money but what did he decide he decided
[1:13:09] I'd rather be poor and have Jesus then
[1:13:12] be rich and be a secret believer and the
[1:13:15] church
[1:13:16] said the gospel doesn't always make you
[1:13:19] rich the gospel doesn't promise uh
[1:13:22] financial prosperity it doesn't he's the
[1:13:24] proof
[1:13:28] he was willing to give up all his riches
[1:13:30] all of his wealth to serve Jesus Christ
[1:13:32] that's
[1:13:33] Faith that's a Time tested Memorial as
[1:13:36] brother random priest amen that's a
[1:13:38] memorial
[1:13:39] Hallelujah he's willing to give it all
[1:13:41] up give up all his money all his social
[1:13:44] Prestige all his Cadillacs we say he's
[1:13:46] willing to give all that up so he can
[1:13:47] know Jesus and know Christ
[1:13:52] crucified
[1:13:54] Gia he wasn't in the word for his day
[1:13:56] but remember he never blasphemed that
[1:13:58] word he stood for the children of God in
[1:14:01] a time of
[1:14:02] trouble acts 5:33 you remember this you
[1:14:04] got your Bible you want to read it
[1:14:07] you're welcome
[1:14:12] too and when they had heard that they
[1:14:15] were cut to the heart and took counsel
[1:14:16] to slay them then stood there up one in
[1:14:19] the council a Pharisee named gilia now
[1:14:21] look church he had to stand
[1:14:23] up Church you're going to have to stand
[1:14:25] stand up sometimes when everybody else
[1:14:27] is sitting down going with the crowd
[1:14:29] you're going to have to stand up and say
[1:14:31] something I'm talking to you school
[1:14:33] children right talking to our children
[1:14:36] when you go to school you got to stand
[1:14:37] up for Jesus I got to do it
[1:14:39] too you homeschoolers you got to stand
[1:14:41] up for
[1:14:43] Jesus everybody else is going to be
[1:14:45] sitting down they're they're going to
[1:14:46] let this evil thing happen but you got
[1:14:48] to stand up you got to tell the truth
[1:14:51] you got to stand up for Jesus that's
[1:14:52] what Gia did
[1:14:55] they were going to go kill Jesus's
[1:14:57] apostles but he stood up and he he keeps
[1:15:00] them from doing that he talks them out
[1:15:01] of Killing
[1:15:05] Them verse 35 he said to them ye men of
[1:15:07] Israel take heed to yourselves what you
[1:15:09] intend to do as touching these men for
[1:15:11] before these days rose up theudas and
[1:15:14] then in verse 37 rose up
[1:15:16] Judas he said and they basically came to
[1:15:18] not go to verse 38 and now I say to you
[1:15:20] refrain from these men and let them
[1:15:22] alone for if this counsel or this work
[1:15:24] be men it will come to not but if it be
[1:15:27] of God ye cannot overthrow it lest
[1:15:29] happily ye be found even to fight
[1:15:32] against God Amen
[1:15:35] Hallelujah he knew now look he was he
[1:15:37] was a Pharisee he was a doctor he knew
[1:15:39] all the intellectualism he knew there
[1:15:41] something different about that move and
[1:15:42] brother Ram said see every move of God
[1:15:44] has Supernatural healings amen every
[1:15:47] move of God has Miracles the spirit of
[1:15:49] God they've got Revival praise God
[1:15:51] hallelujah I've seen you know as we
[1:15:53] prayed and worshiped these last few
[1:15:55] years I've seen Revival here that I
[1:15:57] never saw that level in Pentecostal
[1:15:58] churches I certainly never saw it when I
[1:16:00] was at the
[1:16:01] chapel and uh other Catholic or Baptist
[1:16:04] Churches I've been to I've seen Revival
[1:16:06] in other words the Revival is on the
[1:16:08] message of the hour praise God brother
[1:16:11] said the Revival I read it Wednesday
[1:16:12] night the Revival is on the coming King
[1:16:14] David David's coming into power Jesus is
[1:16:18] coming into Power the millennium's
[1:16:20] coming so the anointing is on Christ the
[1:16:22] anointing is on the message of Christ
[1:16:24] that he's coming
[1:16:26] hallelujah amen that's right church this
[1:16:29] is the message of the hour praise God I
[1:16:32] just heard a Lutheran preacher it's a
[1:16:33] pretty good sermon but it's not the
[1:16:35] message of the
[1:16:36] hour there's more to believing than
[1:16:39] there's more to Salvation than just
[1:16:40] being saved Hallelujah yes you're saved
[1:16:42] but God wants you to go on into
[1:16:44] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:16:46] Holy Ghost
[1:16:47] Hallelujah that's
[1:16:49] right now look at this this proves
[1:16:52] brother William I didn't know this gilia
[1:16:54] died 18 years before the destruction of
[1:16:57] Jerusalem so 52 ad he died Titus came in
[1:17:01] 70 AD this proves God wouldn't let him
[1:17:05] die with the
[1:17:06] wicked to me this proves he was truly a
[1:17:09] foolish
[1:17:10] virgin God spared him from the Wrath
[1:17:14] remember Josephus J Josephus wrote about
[1:17:16] it he said blood was flowing out of the
[1:17:18] Jewish herod's temple it was so bad what
[1:17:20] Titus the Roman govern or the Roman
[1:17:22] Emperor did I'm sorry Roman general
[1:17:25] in
[1:17:26] 8070 it was so
[1:17:28] awful God brought all this destruction
[1:17:31] on Jerusalem because they rejected
[1:17:33] Christ thank God that the wrath of God
[1:17:35] has passed us because we've accepted
[1:17:38] Jesus Christ amen hallelujah but the
[1:17:41] same wrath is coming for this world in
[1:17:43] the Great Tribulation
[1:17:44] period because they rejected Jesus
[1:17:46] Christ as I said they crucify the word
[1:17:49] of this hour Jesus Christ's message for
[1:17:51] this
[1:17:53] hour I'm almost done
[1:17:57] now brother talking about Matthew 25
[1:17:59] this is this great portion of scripture
[1:18:00] that I was even looking at emails V and
[1:18:02] I were send him back in 2020 he's not in
[1:18:04] here right now V and I were emailing
[1:18:06] back and forth I've told you just as
[1:18:08] honestly as I could be I've tried to be
[1:18:10] as honest as I can about this
[1:18:12] topic brother Ram said in Matthew
[1:18:15] 25 it does not say a Shepherd is
[1:18:18] literally separating sheep from
[1:18:21] goats but it is as a Shepherd dividing
[1:18:24] sheep from goats goats these are not
[1:18:26] sheep in this particular area of time
[1:18:28] the white Throne
[1:18:29] judgment the Sheep are in his fold they
[1:18:33] have heard his word and they followed
[1:18:35] him they already have eternal life and
[1:18:37] cannot come into the
[1:18:39] Judgment so let's go to Matthew
[1:18:41] 25:31 I'm almost
[1:18:48] done like I said at Junction City you
[1:18:50] know out in the world people could watch
[1:18:52] a three-hour movie and they could just
[1:18:54] they never fell asleep
[1:18:56] right I've seen some of those people
[1:18:58] talk after church for two hours and they
[1:19:00] never fell
[1:19:02] asleep right so let's wake up by God's
[1:19:05] grace if we need that by God's grace
[1:19:07] that's what I'm saying I'm just saying
[1:19:07] you know this should this should
[1:19:09] encourage us this should interest us you
[1:19:10] know the word of God should right
[1:19:14] Hallelujah Matthew
[1:19:16] 25:31 I I go through it too like I told
[1:19:18] you I got to stand up when I get tired I
[1:19:20] got to stand up go get some water I had
[1:19:22] to do that last weekend my brother D was
[1:19:23] preaching I was kind of tired
[1:19:25] when the son of man verse 31 shall come
[1:19:27] in his glory and all the Holy Angels
[1:19:29] with him then shall he sit upon the
[1:19:30] throne of his glory and before him shall
[1:19:32] be gathered all nations and he shall
[1:19:33] separate them one from another as a
[1:19:35] sheep divided his uh sheep from the goat
[1:19:37] so notice brother said as a Shepherd as
[1:19:40] sheep brother Bram said really though
[1:19:42] they weren't real spiritual sheep
[1:19:44] because the spiritual sheep followed
[1:19:45] Jesus during their lifetime
[1:19:48] publicly right remember my sheep hear my
[1:19:51] voice there it is right there and a
[1:19:53] there it is a stranger there will not
[1:19:54] follow there it is amen I I didn't
[1:19:56] didn't strike me till right now see the
[1:19:58] Seeker believers they can go follow
[1:20:00] another church and hear a different
[1:20:02] voice cuz they're not
[1:20:04] sheep right they're going to be saved
[1:20:06] but they're not sheep sheep Follow The
[1:20:08] Voice sheep follow the shepherd sheep
[1:20:11] abide in the vine sheep abide with the
[1:20:13] shepherd we abide with Jesus Christ the
[1:20:15] great Shepherd Hallelujah cuz we're the
[1:20:17] Sheep now Hallelujah am they get eternal
[1:20:21] life These Foolish virgin but they were
[1:20:24] not the Sheep of God during their
[1:20:26] lifetime because they can follow listen
[1:20:29] they can follow a denominational voice
[1:20:31] and the church
[1:20:34] say it's beautiful this is a great
[1:20:37] Revelation but these do not have eternal
[1:20:39] life and they are in the Judgment
[1:20:40] they're allowed to go into eternal life
[1:20:43] but upon what grounds do they enter into
[1:20:44] eternal life certainly not upon the fact
[1:20:46] that they already have his life as does
[1:20:48] the bride but they receive it because
[1:20:50] they were kind to his Brethren they are
[1:20:52] not his Brethren that would have made
[1:20:54] them joint HS with Jesus they are not
[1:20:57] heirs to anything but life they share No
[1:20:59] Throne Etc with him their names must
[1:21:01] have been in the Book of Life and not
[1:21:03] removed now because of their love of the
[1:21:05] people of God they're recognized and
[1:21:07] saved no doubt these served and helped
[1:21:10] the children of God perhaps there's that
[1:21:12] perhaps remember I preached that many
[1:21:13] times it's a perhaps people ask me are
[1:21:17] the are these people going to be saved
[1:21:18] or these people are going to be saved I
[1:21:19] don't know I've said
[1:21:21] perhaps because that's the best that I
[1:21:23] knew but now based upon this
[1:21:25] understanding if anybody's going to be
[1:21:28] saved they had to and they're not in the
[1:21:30] bride and they're surprised on the day
[1:21:32] of judgment they had to have been a
[1:21:34] secret believer does everybody
[1:21:36] understand because you have to repent in
[1:21:38] order to be
[1:21:39] saved and we see the Simplicity of
[1:21:42] repentance on the the cross when the
[1:21:44] saved Thief says Remember Me Jesus when
[1:21:46] you come into your
[1:21:48] kingdom that is the Simplicity of just
[1:21:51] being a brand a baby Christian right
[1:21:53] you're only justif ified Remember Me
[1:21:56] Jesus see he'd already confessed in his
[1:21:58] heart you're you're holy I'm Unholy I
[1:22:00] deserve this you don't deserve this see
[1:22:03] that so now the Revelation has come
[1:22:05] anyone who saved at the white Throne
[1:22:07] judgment they were saved in life but it
[1:22:09] was a secret believer they didn't tell
[1:22:11] anybody or they told very few
[1:22:14] people that's why they're
[1:22:17] surprised look at verse uh 34 then shall
[1:22:20] the king say Toto them on the right hand
[1:22:22] Come Ye blessed my father inherit the
[1:22:24] Kingdom for prepared for you from the
[1:22:25] foundation of the world for I was
[1:22:26] hungered and you gave me meat I was
[1:22:28] thirsty and you gave me drink I was a
[1:22:29] stranger you took me in naked and you
[1:22:31] clothed me I was sick and you visited me
[1:22:33] and I was in prison and you came unto
[1:22:36] me Hallelujah then shall the righteous
[1:22:39] answer him saying Lord when saw we thee
[1:22:42] hunger and fed thee or thirsty and gave
[1:22:43] thee drink when saw we thee a stranger
[1:22:45] and took thee in or naked and clothed
[1:22:46] thee oh isn't that that's what Nicodemus
[1:22:48] did there it is he was naked on the
[1:22:51] cross Hallelujah and Nicodemus clothed
[1:22:54] him Hallelujah Glory now I believe
[1:22:57] Nicodemus became a real believer that's
[1:22:59] what it looks like cuz he got poor the
[1:23:01] only way we got poor as if he denied his
[1:23:03] former Jewish faith but look at that
[1:23:06] that proves he was a real believer or a
[1:23:08] secret believer he saw the naked body of
[1:23:10] Jesus and he want to wrap it up clothe
[1:23:11] it up put the spices on naked and you
[1:23:14] clothed me and Jesus said when you done
[1:23:16] the least of these you've done it unto
[1:23:17] me
[1:23:23] Hallelujah perhaps like Nicodemus and
[1:23:25] gameo they stood for the children in a
[1:23:27] time of trouble now verse 39 or when saw
[1:23:30] we thee sick or imprison and came unto
[1:23:31] thee and the King shall answer them and
[1:23:34] say unto them verily I say to you truly
[1:23:36] I say unto you in as much as you've done
[1:23:38] it unto the one of the least of these my
[1:23:40] brethren you have done it unto
[1:23:44] me the least of the Saints Paul said
[1:23:48] he's the least right if if someone's
[1:23:50] done one good thing to the least of the
[1:23:53] Saints they've done it unto
[1:23:56] Jesus and remember brother brandham had
[1:23:58] to grow in this look up look up brother
[1:24:01] Sher brother Shar corrected brother Bram
[1:24:03] and said brother Bram you better start
[1:24:04] taking gifts from people because they're
[1:24:06] going to get a blessing brother Ram's
[1:24:08] like yeah you're right I wouldn't do it
[1:24:10] before he said brother sherck corrected
[1:24:12] me on that and this is this is this is
[1:24:15] the
[1:24:16] key we have to let now don't get selfish
[1:24:20] don't let this overflow into je
[1:24:22] selfishness and jealousy you know and
[1:24:24] and covetousness that's the word don't
[1:24:25] let it go into covetousness but if
[1:24:27] people want to do something nice for you
[1:24:28] you got to remember that God's going to
[1:24:30] remember this and God's going to put it
[1:24:31] on their Heavenly
[1:24:33] account that's Philippians chapter 4
[1:24:35] says Paul said I received your gift
[1:24:37] because it'll go to your
[1:24:39] account he said not that I had to have
[1:24:41] it or even I asked for I didn't even ask
[1:24:43] for it or want it but God will put it on
[1:24:45] your account so think about people that
[1:24:47] have got done good things unto you when
[1:24:49] they did it to you they did it unto
[1:24:52] Jesus and this is what Jesus will use as
[1:24:55] evidence remember this is evidence out
[1:24:57] of the books that are open here's the
[1:25:00] evidence this person's a Believer
[1:25:02] because they went and
[1:25:04] visited let me pull that up there
[1:25:06] because they went and visited some
[1:25:07] brother in prison some sister they fed
[1:25:10] the the hungry brother a hungry sister
[1:25:12] they clothed the the the person that
[1:25:13] didn't have much clothes they took
[1:25:16] somebody into their
[1:25:17] house they gave them drink when they're
[1:25:19] thirsty they visited the
[1:25:22] sick Jesus said see these are are these
[1:25:24] are proofs these are proofs of your
[1:25:27] faith because faith brother
[1:25:30] Works faith without works is the dword
[1:25:34] Dead the Bible said if you don't have
[1:25:36] any Works behind your faith it's dead
[1:25:38] it's not real Faith these people had
[1:25:40] Faith because they worked Hallelujah but
[1:25:42] it was a surprise they they were secret
[1:25:45] Believers and so they're surprised on
[1:25:47] the day of judgment how when did I do
[1:25:48] this to you when did I they didn't even
[1:25:50] know that Christ was in his bride amen
[1:25:52] but that's all we've been preaching for
[1:25:53] 40 50 years brother is that Christ is in
[1:25:55] the bride
[1:25:57] amen it's Christ in us the hope of Glory
[1:26:01] Hallelujah it was Christ in the bride
[1:26:03] through each of the seven Church ages
[1:26:05] now it's Christ in the bride here in the
[1:26:07] time of Lea we've known that the whole
[1:26:09] time but these are the day of judgment
[1:26:11] they didn't know that they were foolish
[1:26:12] virgins they were secret Believers but
[1:26:15] Jesus saw amen God Jesus saw their
[1:26:17] secret works and rewarded them openly
[1:26:19] amen there it is man oh that's right
[1:26:22] that's right amen
[1:26:28] brother said these people were separated
[1:26:31] wasn't Gia Nicodemus they were separated
[1:26:33] from everybody they stood up they stood
[1:26:35] against those things trying to abide the
[1:26:38] word according to what they knew of it
[1:26:39] and being a help in the work of the Lord
[1:26:41] will come up at the end
[1:26:43] time they'll miss the Millennium right
[1:26:46] we preached on that this summer amen you
[1:26:48] don't want to miss the mill it's more
[1:26:50] important and wonderful than you could
[1:26:51] ever imagine
[1:26:55] brother Bram said g was a good teacher
[1:26:57] brother Bram said g used wisdom he said
[1:26:59] good things about
[1:27:00] him see I believe these now now I have
[1:27:03] an understanding all these years I've
[1:27:04] waited for this it feels like I've never
[1:27:06] understood this how could they be
[1:27:08] surprised because they didn't recognize
[1:27:10] Christ and his
[1:27:11] bride they weren't mature believers they
[1:27:14] didn't even know that Christ was in the
[1:27:16] church and whatever they did to the the
[1:27:19] church that's how they would treated
[1:27:20] Christ remember Peter said Peter said
[1:27:23] you didn't lie to me he said you lied to
[1:27:25] the Holy Ghost remember that that's
[1:27:28] proof If you lied to a Believer you lied
[1:27:30] to God is that
[1:27:32] right look at that that's why they died
[1:27:35] because it wasn't Peter it was God
[1:27:36] behind Peter amen May each one of us
[1:27:39] recognize God behind the veil of our
[1:27:41] Badger skins hallelujah it's God behind
[1:27:44] you it's God behind me it's God behind
[1:27:46] us that's why we must be careful how we
[1:27:48] treat each
[1:27:49] other is that
[1:27:51] right see that's fresh revelation I
[1:27:54] never caught this till this last week
[1:27:56] and even now as I'm preaching three
[1:27:58] things have dropped down I need to hope
[1:27:59] this is recorded you if not I'll be
[1:28:01] praying God restore those three thoughts
[1:28:04] I know you're faithful you can bring
[1:28:05] them back to me things I never put
[1:28:07] together never understood these are
[1:28:08] believers because remember they got to
[1:28:09] be judged out of the books the books
[1:28:11] recorded their works and works come from
[1:28:13] faith and faith comes from Love Love
[1:28:16] worketh by
[1:28:18] faith I'm sorry faith I'm sorry Faith
[1:28:20] Works by love thank
[1:28:23] you faith has to work by love so it all
[1:28:26] goes back to love they love Jesus they
[1:28:28] just didn't know who jesus' bride
[1:28:30] was they were secret
[1:28:34] Believers remember church I said this
[1:28:36] earlier you're going to be judged too
[1:28:38] not Eternal separation but you're going
[1:28:41] to be judged by The Works you did this
[1:28:43] this says every I preach Romans 14 to
[1:28:45] you I already preach it you're judged
[1:28:46] you're going to stand before the
[1:28:47] Judgment seat of Christ let's read it
[1:28:48] second Corinthians
[1:28:49] 5 uh I didn't put the verse it must be
[1:28:52] 10 and 11 I must forgot to type 10 and
[1:28:54] 11
[1:29:00] there we'll see second Corinthians
[1:29:12] 510
[1:29:15] no no that's not oh no second
[1:29:17] Corinthians 5 okay I'm in First
[1:29:18] Corinthians 5 there we
[1:29:20] go I see now
[1:29:27] there it is yes amen hallelujah for we
[1:29:29] must all appear before the Judgment seat
[1:29:31] of Christ that everyone may receive the
[1:29:33] things done in his body according to
[1:29:36] that he hath done whether it be good or
[1:29:39] bad See We call we call it the Judgment
[1:29:42] seat for rewards right brother William
[1:29:44] that's what we've called it over the
[1:29:45] years it's a judgment seat of
[1:29:48] rewards and that's what the Bible says
[1:29:51] remember Jesus said if you believe
[1:29:52] you've already passed from judgment
[1:29:53] right right we've already passed from
[1:29:54] Death un life so we won't go uh we won't
[1:29:57] be sent to hell we understand that but
[1:29:59] we also have to answer for the Deeds
[1:30:00] that we do in this body because the
[1:30:02] works that we did were based upon our
[1:30:04] faith and Faith was motivated by
[1:30:09] love second Corinthians
[1:30:13] 5:11 knowing therefore the terror of the
[1:30:15] lord we persuade men but we are made
[1:30:17] manifest unto God and I trust also are
[1:30:21] made manifest in your Consciousness so
[1:30:23] see we should manif EST we should
[1:30:24] manifest the character of Jesus Christ
[1:30:26] to one
[1:30:27] another
[1:30:30] Hallelujah see we're judged for our
[1:30:32] works for rewards not for separation
[1:30:35] from
[1:30:37] God everybody see
[1:30:39] that think about your works now it's
[1:30:41] always easy with you mothers and fathers
[1:30:43] your works are to raise children that's
[1:30:44] your
[1:30:46] works like brother Bram told that
[1:30:49] uh remember Mrs Ford she was a black
[1:30:51] sister she died and brother was talking
[1:30:54] after her funeral and brother Bram said
[1:30:56] wasn't she the best wife she could ever
[1:30:57] be to her husband he's like yeah you can
[1:30:59] hear on the tape yes sir and she asked
[1:31:02] her her sons wasn't she the best mother
[1:31:04] she could be they're like yes my and
[1:31:07] look he said sister for did everything
[1:31:09] that God asked her to
[1:31:11] do she did what God called her to do in
[1:31:16] the Simplicity of the word of God let's
[1:31:19] find what God has called us to do and do
[1:31:23] what God God's called you to
[1:31:26] do
[1:31:28] hallelujah look at these examples we got
[1:31:31] here jerus Nicodemus do what God's
[1:31:34] called you God like in all these cases
[1:31:35] God called them out of their old life
[1:31:37] into a life of following the word of the
[1:31:39] hour and then you got to take a stand
[1:31:41] when everybody else won't stand you got
[1:31:43] to stand for the truth stand on your
[1:31:46] job right s be in the pie company you
[1:31:49] got to stand for Jesus in The Pie
[1:31:51] Company I got to stand for Jesus in the
[1:31:53] Elementary bus building praise God
[1:31:55] wherever you are on the soccer team you
[1:31:58] got to stand for Jesus on the soccer
[1:31:59] team is that right Patrick that's right
[1:32:02] right Claude you got to stand for Jesus
[1:32:05] sister Anna wherever you go you going
[1:32:06] back to school this week yep you're
[1:32:08] gonna stand for Jesus there that's what
[1:32:10] God called you to do you're doing
[1:32:11] exactly what God called you to
[1:32:14] do remember some of you got to remember
[1:32:17] Jesus went to learn subjection from the
[1:32:19] time he was 12 all the way to 30 so I'm
[1:32:22] talking to lyi and Malachi here Malachi
[1:32:23] is almost an adult so even though you're
[1:32:25] at my house you might be an adult you
[1:32:27] still got to learn to submit to me and
[1:32:28] your mom don't forget don't forget your
[1:32:30] mom and they do but I'm making the point
[1:32:33] Jesus spent 12 to 30 obeying his mother
[1:32:37] and father all the time and then he even
[1:32:40] obeyed her when he she said turn the
[1:32:41] water to wine it wasn't even his time he
[1:32:43] even obeyed her there too right
[1:32:46] interesting thought there now I know I'm
[1:32:49] preaching long today but that's okay I
[1:32:51] I've been waiting to preach a Sunday for
[1:32:52] a while it's been a while since I
[1:32:53] preached a good Sunday to you I at least
[1:32:55] I felt like this is a fresh Revelations
[1:32:58] I really want to lay this in I'm making
[1:33:00] a tape this morning
[1:33:03] everybody but it is a fresh
[1:33:08] revelation we now face the question as
[1:33:10] to why should why should they the uh the
[1:33:13] the those that are good to the Brethren
[1:33:14] be given eternal life at the Judgment
[1:33:16] since the Epistles seem to conclusively
[1:33:18] point out that one must possess the
[1:33:20] spirit of Christ or perish now Paul's
[1:33:22] right there it's 1 Corinthians 12 you
[1:33:23] got your
[1:33:25] Bible 1 Corinthians 12 says if any man
[1:33:28] have not the spirit of Christ he's none
[1:33:29] of
[1:33:32] his and church I've listen
[1:33:34] denominational people use this all the
[1:33:37] time maybe it's not that maybe it's
[1:33:40] Romans 12 just give me a second here any
[1:33:43] man have not the spirit of Christ he's
[1:33:44] none of his does anybody can anybody
[1:33:46] shout that out
[1:33:47] anybody okay I didn't know if you're
[1:33:49] already there
[1:33:58] If any man have not the spirit of Christ
[1:34:00] none of his I'm look up none of
[1:34:02] his I feel like
[1:34:04] I've used this verse many times I just
[1:34:07] don't have this
[1:34:10] one that's probably it h let's
[1:34:14] see that's it thank you hun Romans 89
[1:34:19] but ye are not in the flesh thank you
[1:34:20] casa but in the spirit if so be that the
[1:34:22] spirit of God dwell in you now if any
[1:34:24] man not have the spirit of or have not
[1:34:25] the spirit of Christ he's none of his
[1:34:27] look at that I've seen so many
[1:34:29] denominational preachers use this so and
[1:34:30] and their argument is see if you just
[1:34:32] repent of your sins now now you're
[1:34:35] filled with the Holy
[1:34:36] Ghost but see the Revelation is you've
[1:34:39] got the spirit of Christ in a measure
[1:34:41] you've got faith so these denominational
[1:34:43] people if they really get saved yes the
[1:34:45] spirit of Christ you have it but you got
[1:34:47] this much Hallelujah their their life
[1:34:50] proves
[1:34:52] it is a Justified person still belonging
[1:34:55] to Jesus yes but they've only got this
[1:34:57] much get you some more of that amen if
[1:35:00] you like that you're going to like the
[1:35:01] rest of it amen hallelujah and wait till
[1:35:04] you're filled with it praise God Amen
[1:35:07] and then no matter what trial you face
[1:35:08] you know God will bring you out of it
[1:35:09] Hallelujah God will give you Grace to
[1:35:11] overcome amen because Christ is sealed
[1:35:14] inside of you and Satan is sealed out
[1:35:16] hallelujah
[1:35:20] amen see this is this is great teaching
[1:35:23] from Brother here in the church age book
[1:35:24] through you know the his counsel with
[1:35:26] brother lale and some other brothers
[1:35:28] though it seems thus we must not
[1:35:30] discredit the words of Jesus who most
[1:35:32] pointedly sets forth that there are some
[1:35:34] found in the Book of Life who will
[1:35:36] either receive eternal life before the
[1:35:38] gener resurrection or after
[1:35:41] it okay so remember the book of First
[1:35:44] John says we already have eternal life
[1:35:46] that life is in his son John wrote I
[1:35:48] write to you to tell you that you have
[1:35:50] eternal life you ought to be the
[1:35:51] happiest person today if you got eternal
[1:35:54] life Hallelujah already but brother said
[1:35:56] the foolish version doesn't get eternal
[1:35:57] life here they get it over there
[1:35:59] Hallelujah that's right that's
[1:36:02] right because they go into life we just
[1:36:04] read it in Matthew 25 they go into
[1:36:07] eternal life but you've already got
[1:36:10] it
[1:36:13] Hallelujah here's a great verse
[1:36:14] Philippians 3:11 you can just read off
[1:36:16] here Paul does not evade this truth this
[1:36:19] is a beautiful Revelation for he most
[1:36:21] clearly says in Philippians 3:11 by any
[1:36:24] means I might attain to the resurrection
[1:36:26] of the dead so Paul's saying by any way
[1:36:28] I want to attain to the resurrection of
[1:36:31] the dead now look what brother brings
[1:36:32] out here beautiful thought now this
[1:36:34] statement is most peculiar we all know
[1:36:37] that we're all going to be at the
[1:36:38] resurrection whether we want to or
[1:36:40] not that must mean there's two
[1:36:42] resurrections and the church said like
[1:36:45] Revelation 20 says there's a first
[1:36:47] resurrection and then you just turn two
[1:36:49] chapters and then I'm
[1:36:51] sorry it's the same chapter you just
[1:36:54] read the rest of the chapter Revelation
[1:36:55] 20 you get to the second Resurrection
[1:36:57] amen
[1:36:59] glory so Paul could hardly be saying if
[1:37:02] by any means I might attain to the
[1:37:03] resurrection of the Dead the truth of
[1:37:05] the matter is he's not saying that the
[1:37:07] literal reading is if by any means I
[1:37:09] might attain to the out Resurrection
[1:37:12] from among the dead this is not the
[1:37:14] attain to the general or second
[1:37:16] Resurrection but attaining to the first
[1:37:18] resurrection of which is said blessed
[1:37:20] and holy is he who hath part in this
[1:37:23] first Resurrection on such the second
[1:37:25] death hath no power but they shall be
[1:37:27] Priests of God and of Christ and shall
[1:37:29] reign with him a thousand years the
[1:37:31] first resurrection has nothing to do
[1:37:33] with the second death
[1:37:35] Hallelujah so Paul's saying if by any
[1:37:37] means I might be
[1:37:38] raptured if any means I might meet
[1:37:41] Christ in the air Hallelujah even if I
[1:37:43] die if I'm dead let me be the dead in
[1:37:46] Christ that rises first Hallelujah
[1:37:49] that's what he's
[1:37:50] saying and remember the Bible says that
[1:37:53] in in Hebrews 4 as well my all these
[1:37:54] scriptures are just roolling together
[1:37:56] the spirit of Revelation is here today
[1:37:59] amen Hebrews 4 says that you must uh you
[1:38:03] must labor to enter into that rest lest
[1:38:06] A promise is given unto you you don't
[1:38:09] attain to the
[1:38:11] promise see youve got to attain to the
[1:38:14] promise the rest is the baptism of the
[1:38:16] Holy
[1:38:17] Ghost right he's talking to Jewish
[1:38:19] Christian I'm sorry Hebrew Christians
[1:38:21] yeah je they former Jewish they former
[1:38:23] Jewish J judaizers now they're uh now
[1:38:25] they're Christians but they're still
[1:38:26] Hebrew they're still Jews in the natural
[1:38:29] and he's saying don't fail to make sure
[1:38:31] you enter into that rest there's
[1:38:33] promises that you must enter into keep
[1:38:36] going further because you want to attain
[1:38:39] to the outgoing of the resurrection of
[1:38:41] the Dead hallelujah amen you want to
[1:38:44] attain to the dead in Christ rising and
[1:38:46] the dead in Christ will rise first and
[1:38:49] then we that are which are alive and
[1:38:50] remain uh shall meet them and then will
[1:38:52] go to meet the the Lord in the air
[1:38:54] praise God I didn't quote that exactly
[1:38:56] right but you know the verse it's 1
[1:38:58] Thessalonians 4:16 And1
[1:39:00] 17 this is at the end of the Thousand
[1:39:02] Years when all the rest of the Dead live
[1:39:04] again and in that day there will be
[1:39:06] those who come forth to eternal life and
[1:39:09] those others who are caught in the
[1:39:10] second death we do not need to guess
[1:39:13] about those who in the second
[1:39:14] Resurrection are given life we are told
[1:39:17] it is given to them on the grounds that
[1:39:19] they have been kind and good to the
[1:39:22] brethren those who are raised and cast
[1:39:24] in Lake of Fire will be so treated
[1:39:26] because of their mistreatment of the
[1:39:28] Brethren what about all these
[1:39:29] governments that are killing Christians
[1:39:30] like I said Iran Kenya Nigeria uh China
[1:39:35] what about all these governments killing
[1:39:36] Christians they're lost if they don't
[1:39:40] repent right they're going to be cast in
[1:39:42] Lake of
[1:39:43] Fire since this is the word of God we
[1:39:46] simply accept it there is no argument
[1:39:48] here just a simple statement of
[1:39:51] fact Hallelujah
[1:39:55] remember this remember the gibon
[1:39:58] nightes in Genesis
[1:40:00] 15 God told Abraham your seed's going to
[1:40:04] go into Egypt I'm going to bring them
[1:40:05] out and they're going to drive out all
[1:40:06] these inhabitants of their land because
[1:40:08] their cup of their iniquities Not Yet
[1:40:11] full in other words the gibeonites had a
[1:40:14] death sentence on
[1:40:16] them but what they do they deceived
[1:40:19] Joshua and the group and uh so that uh
[1:40:23] so that they wouldn't be
[1:40:24] killed right they never were the
[1:40:27] Brethren but God God forgave over 400
[1:40:30] years of sins God forgave a cup of
[1:40:33] iniquity brother William a 400 years of
[1:40:35] iniquity God forgave that in an instant
[1:40:37] and let them
[1:40:39] live and then God made them hewers of
[1:40:42] wood for the house of God and uh
[1:40:44] carriers of waters I'm sorry jugs of
[1:40:47] water God made them workers Amen in the
[1:40:51] house of God but they would never be the
[1:40:52] bre they'd never be part of the mighty
[1:40:54] Army of God they never have the the
[1:40:56] status like Joshua had but they were
[1:40:59] good to the Brethren so God saved them
[1:41:01] God was merciful to them God gave them
[1:41:04] life Hallelujah that's a type of the
[1:41:06] foolish
[1:41:07] virgin look look God they were secret
[1:41:10] Believers right God had to bring them to
[1:41:11] make a
[1:41:12] decision you either die or you join
[1:41:15] Joshua he said I'm joining Joshua and
[1:41:18] the Bible said they feared the Lord
[1:41:19] because of that and I closed the service
[1:41:22] at cams one time and it really brought
[1:41:23] people up to the altar weeping about
[1:41:25] this and God thought so much of them
[1:41:28] that in the next chapter these are just
[1:41:30] we'd say just foolish virgins but
[1:41:31] they're still God's
[1:41:33] people in the next chapter uh I forget
[1:41:35] which which nation came against them and
[1:41:38] they called for Joshua come save us
[1:41:40] that's the moment Joshua went out there
[1:41:41] and he he was fighting and he spoke to
[1:41:43] the son and said Son stand
[1:41:46] still the only time God ever hearkened
[1:41:49] to the voice of a man like that when did
[1:41:52] he do it when he was pleading for the
[1:41:54] foolish virgin's life just like Abraham
[1:41:58] plead he pleaded for the life of lot he
[1:42:00] pleaded for the righteous church God
[1:42:02] loves that kind of prayer when God wants
[1:42:04] to see people saved when when God urges
[1:42:07] you to pray for those that may be on the
[1:42:09] fence or borderline or secret Believers
[1:42:11] God loves that kind of prayer because
[1:42:13] it's eternal life
[1:42:15] Hallelujah God thought so much of that
[1:42:18] he honored Joshua's own
[1:42:20] word and let the son stand still like I
[1:42:22] told you before does that mean the Rays
[1:42:24] of the sun just stood there and I don't
[1:42:26] know I don't know how that worked out
[1:42:28] did he make the Sun and the Earth just
[1:42:30] stand still whatever condition they were
[1:42:33] in I don't know how he did it but he did
[1:42:35] it he did it because Joshua called for
[1:42:38] Mercy Joshua was in the uh brother Adam
[1:42:40] said uh he was just in in the he was
[1:42:42] just in his duty he said when you're
[1:42:45] walking your your post of Duty he said
[1:42:47] sometimes you don't got time to pray he
[1:42:48] says sometimes you just speak the word
[1:42:50] of God Amen why Christ speak speak the
[1:42:53] word of God and go forward and God
[1:42:55] honored Joshua's prayer
[1:43:00] amen and let me just say this now over
[1:43:03] the years I've said this to church i'
[1:43:04] about Matthew 25 I said I don't know if
[1:43:06] these people were saved or they're given
[1:43:07] you know the children have asked me are
[1:43:09] these atheists that are saved well now
[1:43:10] I'd say no like before I said I don't
[1:43:13] know could be Meg and I emailed about it
[1:43:16] in 2020 I still got our email saved I
[1:43:17] was looking through that's when you
[1:43:19] remember brother bang when you used to
[1:43:20] have time to email before all these kids
[1:43:21] came along remember
[1:43:24] I'm just joking buddy I'm the same
[1:43:26] way God's bless you richly
[1:43:31] buddy but I used to think I used said
[1:43:33] well maybe maybe well now I know
[1:43:35] no it's got to be someone who's a secret
[1:43:38] believer because they have works that
[1:43:40] follow their faith they have you know
[1:43:44] you have to have faith to be saved Jesus
[1:43:46] said no man comes to the father but by
[1:43:48] me now the only exception is this
[1:43:50] brother William a Jew that's blinded
[1:43:52] will Den Jesus on this Earth but
[1:43:54] according to the fist seal Jesus will
[1:43:55] save him that's the only exception
[1:43:58] because God put blindness he cut off
[1:44:00] them but they're still under Moses
[1:44:02] Covenant they're still under a covenant
[1:44:03] promise now could God do that with
[1:44:05] Gentiles maybe I don't know I don't have
[1:44:07] a scriptural example for it I'm not
[1:44:09] trying to be God here I'm just trying to
[1:44:10] give you some scripture here by God's
[1:44:12] grace Hallelujah and I'm closing with
[1:44:14] this brother brandham was a man of
[1:44:17] Grace you should know that if you've
[1:44:19] been listening these last six sermons I
[1:44:20] preached on the spirit of Grace or the
[1:44:21] message of Grace brother Bram was a man
[1:44:24] of
[1:44:26] Grace they asked brother Bram can
[1:44:28] adulterers go in the Rapture I'm just
[1:44:30] going to skip ahead you know this I've
[1:44:31] used this before over the years brother
[1:44:33] said I don't know can they go in the
[1:44:34] Rapture he said I don't
[1:44:38] know he said uh all one thing I know
[1:44:40] that doter is not inherit the kingdom of
[1:44:42] God I don't know I can't say he said I
[1:44:44] must stay with the word of
[1:44:48] God but he says this God has made
[1:44:51] restitutions in places for people that
[1:44:53] did things wrong he talks about David
[1:44:55] eating the shoe
[1:44:56] bread uh the priest blasting the Sabbath
[1:44:59] but a greater than the Sabbath was there
[1:45:01] so he gives those two examples he said
[1:45:04] there might be a chance of you to get in
[1:45:05] So This what I love about brother
[1:45:06] brandham he never made himself a
[1:45:08] know-it-all like all these denominations
[1:45:10] make themselves know it all they can
[1:45:11] condemn this person to hell they think
[1:45:13] they know everything they don't know
[1:45:14] their hearts they don't know secret
[1:45:16] believers they weren't
[1:45:18] there see they make themselves judges
[1:45:21] they make themselves like uh Gods
[1:45:23] basically but I love this about brother
[1:45:25] R he was humble he said perhaps there's
[1:45:27] a scripture I don't know but there is a
[1:45:30] scriptural precence for God showing
[1:45:32] Mercy when things were
[1:45:35] wrong that's what I'm talking about okay
[1:45:37] that's what I'm I'm mentioning here I'm
[1:45:39] not saying adulterers are going in the
[1:45:40] Rapture I don't know but brother mam is
[1:45:42] saying God did make restitutions for
[1:45:45] people at times and look what he says
[1:45:48] just leave it up to God go on ahead just
[1:45:51] live just live for Christ now see what
[1:45:52] he saying redeem the time now amen don't
[1:45:55] fall into despair don't fall into
[1:45:57] depression live for Jesus with all you
[1:45:59] got Hallelujah make your calling
[1:46:01] election sure give all diligence to do
[1:46:03] that praise God Amen don't let yourself
[1:46:05] get carried away by The Winds of sin and
[1:46:08] I'm sorry the Waters of sin stay true to
[1:46:10] God show everybody which side you're on
[1:46:13] Hallelujah there might be a chance of
[1:46:15] you getting in two wrongs never right in
[1:46:17] one just go and live the way you are if
[1:46:19] you're happy together he's talking about
[1:46:20] the people that have been married he he
[1:46:23] said all wrongs will be made
[1:46:26] right remember this brother man told us
[1:46:29] why he chose to preach the message of
[1:46:31] Grace he it was another topic he was
[1:46:34] attacked on so they attacked brother
[1:46:36] Bram about the godhead right oh God's
[1:46:38] three persons brother bram's wrong and
[1:46:40] they attacked him on Grace too you're
[1:46:41] not a good enough calvinist you're not a
[1:46:43] good enough Armenian he said I'm
[1:46:44] standing right in the middle of the road
[1:46:46] I'm standing with the Bible he said I
[1:46:48] I'll he said I'll go on the branch as
[1:46:50] far as the Bible will let me go on your
[1:46:52] branch of of
[1:46:54] Calvinism amen but as soon as you pass a
[1:46:57] certain part of the branch there's no
[1:46:58] more scripture he said that's as far as
[1:47:00] I'll go right I'll go with you as far as
[1:47:02] the Bible lets me go but I'm not going
[1:47:04] to go into your Creeds right your
[1:47:06] traditions of
[1:47:08] men brother said then I chose this
[1:47:10] morning being that that message was so
[1:47:11] attacked the godhead another thing that
[1:47:13] I'm so gotten about after is preaching
[1:47:16] Grace I want to speak on that this
[1:47:18] morning as I read this chapter
[1:47:24] uh let's stand to our feet musicians can
[1:47:32] come I'll say it like this all men of
[1:47:35] God are men of
[1:47:37] Grace you believe that
[1:47:39] brother because we are all saved by
[1:47:42] grace through faith not of Works lest
[1:47:45] any man should boast I believe the Holy
[1:47:47] Ghost has proven it right through these
[1:47:49] recent
[1:47:50] sermons God could have killed Moses at
[1:47:52] least two times times maybe three but
[1:47:54] God showed Grace God could have killed
[1:47:56] David but God showed him
[1:47:59] Grace
[1:48:02] Hallelujah God could have done so many
[1:48:04] things God could have poured out
[1:48:06] judgments God could have done all these
[1:48:08] awful things to people but God showed
[1:48:12] Grace God is rich in Mercy Church he's
[1:48:16] rich in
[1:48:19] Grace now all this to say
[1:48:23] what I wanted to show you today was that
[1:48:25] in the foolish version in that in that
[1:48:26] group there there is a huge Spectrum in
[1:48:28] there some people are scarcely saved
[1:48:31] some people can get so
[1:48:34] close but let's make our calling and
[1:48:36] election sure let's let's make all let's
[1:48:39] let's let's answer all questions let's
[1:48:41] let every area of our life be cleaned
[1:48:43] out by the word of
[1:48:45] God hallelujah so that we can see it's
[1:48:49] not me living it's Christ in me living
[1:48:52] and when someone does something good to
[1:48:53] me they did it for Christ in
[1:48:56] me not because of me because I'm my in
[1:48:59] my own self I'm a sinner saved by
[1:49:04] grace but that's the power of the Gospel
[1:49:07] of Jesus Christ he lied to Peter he lied
[1:49:10] to
[1:49:11] god let's not the Bible said lie not one
[1:49:13] to another praise God but love one
[1:49:16] another I think we read it the other day
[1:49:18] about oh brother Dennis read about we
[1:49:20] talked about last night joking around
[1:49:21] but it's true we got to be tender
[1:49:22] hearted what was the verse that you used
[1:49:24] last night remember we talked about
[1:49:25] being tenderhearted towards
[1:49:27] another vows of Mercy there it is
[1:49:30] remember we talked about
[1:49:31] that that's what we need
[1:49:33] here bows of
[1:49:36] Mercy tenderhearted toward one
[1:49:41] another having the real Spirit of Christ
[1:49:43] in our lives how many enjoyed the word
[1:49:46] although it was a little longer than
[1:49:47] normal everybody enjoy that that's a
[1:49:48] good two hour sermon see
[1:49:51] now I feel like have peace Brother
[1:49:53] William I it's off my heart I hope they
[1:49:57] sure got the tape on that because I'm

[1:49:59] Bible study and if anybody has questions
[1:50:01] my well you got a lot of scripture right
[1:50:02] here this gives me a solid place to
[1:50:05] stand you have to be a believer to be
