========================================

so I said that's okay I don't have to hold the baby you don't have to do all these traditions of man you know it's just a a show it's just a tradition not a show it's a tradition so we dedicated him to the Lord so it was really wonderful say afterwards the fellowship and had a good time in the Lord so like to continue on tonight uh Jesus said be ye perfect so I like to look at part two of this how many enjoyed last week by God's grace I told Brother Simon you know with the adoption message I asked him to you know speak on that or the mount Transfiguration rather on Sunday night I thought it just would go in perfect because if you remember last week what's one of the definitions of perfect it's maturity right and what is being adopted maturity I thought I didn't even realize it it just flowed together perfectly so I was very thankful for that so let's read Matthew 548 let's read that together on three one two three be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect let's have one more word of prayer have if you have a need on your heart just raise your hand up to the Lord surely God sees our hands father God we just come to you with praise and thanksgiving oh Adonai oh elai god of Grace we call out your name Lord Jesus Christ Lord May us and our families be saved may you save these sick ones as well Lord Jesus we love you we need you tonight Lord speak through me speak through your people Lord God if there's gifts in operation Lord our minds are on that recently father use your gifts for your glory father just speak here tonight God may we be edified may we be strengthened may we drawn closer to you we ask it in Jesus Christ CH name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God now I'll just briefly review just real briefly you know we looked at last week how um in this context Jesus speaking of of maturity um if you look at the context he's talking about how Christians should be able to love the unlovable Christians should be able to love their enemies how many did it this week anybody love their enemy this week maybe think about a little bit okay couple students amen I believe that by God's grace and so in one context you know this means maturity the word perfect means maturity in another context it means totally complete and forgiven right we saw that in Hebrews 10:14 in case you would you put that up there Hebrews 10:14 says for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified amen how many believe that scripture talks about you how many Sanctified ones out there amen that word is actually a different Greek word it's kind of close in its number and it's spelling but it it means actually to make perfect complete to carry through completely I'm already carried through Hallelujah he already carried me through amen I've it means to accomplish to finish he's already accomplished my salvation amen did he say it was finished church Hallelujah it it means bring bring to an end he has forever brought them to an end who are Sanctified in other words we know the end of the Bible Hallelujah we know the end of our destination our destination is with Christ in heaven Hallelujah it means to be found perfect it means to bring to the end goal proposed Hallelujah I've already reached the goal hallelujah amen My Soul Your Soul has already reached its goal Hallelujah that's right Hallelujah it means to bring to a fulfillment to be bring to a close it's already closed go like this it's already finished my soul's already got its place in heaven hallelujah amen I got a the Alp you waiting for me there hallelujah amen amen so that's the review there just real briefly we looked at other numerous scriptures about um looked out maturity and so forth now I want to get to some more verses the verses we didn't get to so case this word perfect also means it's in Hebrews 12 I'm sorry Hebrews 5:12 uh also means full age Jesus said be therefore perfect be of a full age don't be a baby amen don't be an immature Christian don't be a toddler Christian don't be a a first grade Christian be a full AG Christian right brother said you're not fresh recruits anymore right we're not fresh soldiers we've been in the battle a long time let's be mature praise God Amen Hebrews 5:12 says for when ye I'm sorry for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat now don't feel bad don't use this scripture to let the devil beat you up well you forgot this and you forgot that we all forget teachings I forget teachings right but let this be an encouragement that you know if someone asks you about something fresh you heard you be able to tell them right cuz just fresh on your heart there's times I got to go look up that like oh what was that again I forgot about that happens all the time but if somebody ask me something I recently preached I can tell them right away right so it means it means that we're not baby Christians like how do I get saved again how should I be baptized how am I forgiven again am I saved by my works or am I saved by grace I mean this is what it means this means some and remember he lists them later he lists these later in chapter six right remember uh the laying on of hands right there's different ones in there I don't have my Bible open to that one I just copied the the verses there on my computer but you remember there were six things that we should already know right the different baptisms different resurrections are there three resurrections four five or how many there's two resurrections the first resurrection and the last Resurrection right there's only two resurrections now verse 13 for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of rightous for he's a bab now now we're going to get down to see who really is a mature Christian amen I think you should say Amen when I read this verse 14 I don't believe I have many baby Christians here unless you just got baptized recently right verse 14 but strong meat belongs to them who are of a full age who are perfect even those who by reason of use have their senses exercise to discern good and evil how many Saw evil trying to slip into your life this week right you're mature you're not a Bab baby babies would miss it right babies would miss it they're not exercised they're not strong enough to be able to push it out of the way but you're strong enough because you're a mature Christian praise God Amen so Jesus says or Paul says that strong me you can handle strong preaching because you're of a full age that's what the Saints told me on Sunday they said I never heard a sermon like that on the godhead I said that's strong preaching for that's that ain't no uh just God loves you in John 3:16 that's some deep preaching go going back before the foundation world when it was just the father and the son and the son was rejoicing before the Lord before the world was even founded amen and then don't don't don't leave yourself out of that you were in Christ amen you were there brother said in his thoughts Hallelujah you were chosen in Christ so it all even it go even it goes back that far you were there Hallelujah see that's deep preaching some people can't handle that but then if you know that now what does it mean I was in Christ why better in Christ's word then right now I better line up my life with the word of Christ and that's what we do in this church amen hallelujah now how many saw some good slipping into your life this week amen or should should I say growing in your life right amen I should say growing not slipping it's sin that tries to slip in right but it's Holiness that is grow or grown into your life right it's it's it's it's uh what's the gardening word it's cultivated into your life right you slowly you weed out the bad things and now you can grow Stronger by God's grace amen hallelujah there it go things there's another one for perfect you're mature you're full age next one uh let's go to James chapter 1 we'll just jump up to James 1 verse2 my brethren con to All Joy when you fall into diverse Temptations if we could just live that we would be so much more Victorious right amen huh kind of all joy when you got a financial problem when you coming to church kind of all joy when you're sick and you can't come to church how many how many are joyful at home live streaming I'm not I don't like to live stream I'm glad I don't get sick very much by God's grace I don't like being at home I I just I get distracted I'm just I'm a worker man you know right it's wrong I shouldn't do that but it's hard he said come to All Joy when you fall into a Temptation I was tempted this week to do that the Bible said be joyful amen remember God can trust you with that amen he knew you wouldn't fall praise God and if you did fall you got Grace to try it again knowing the next time you won't fall praise God cuz we all fall we all make mistakes verse three knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh or produces patience see that's why you can be joyful in any trial amen that's why we got to preach it more I got to preach it more you can be joyful in any trial because I know once I get through this I'm going to have more patience amen I'm going to be a happier Christian hallelujah amen amen I'm going enjoy going to church more I'm going to enjoy seeing the Saints more if I can just get through this trial praise God amen amen verse four but let patience have her perfect work see that's that feminine attribute interesting that Christ Christ is the feminine right and God is like the masculine the submissive part let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire that means mature see patience will produce maturity in you amen so so so as we come to the end of 2023 we shouldn't be oh God the year came and I didn't get what I wanted we should be praised God I made it another year maybe this is the year coming up praise God come on sints Amen right that that should be our kind of all joy amen and these tests the these patience these trials and tests that cause patience should produce maturity in our lives amen hallelujah want nothing right I don't need anything in the world Hallelujah I don't need anything in the world I've got God's promise hallelujah amen other words I've got patience and like I preached before if I got patience I don't need anything else because I'm not trusting in what my eyes see I'm not trusting in what my mind thinks I've got patience I can wait on God hallelujah amen well said that's what you need he said the first thing you need is patience with God he said Noah had lots of patience 120 years and think about that only the family came in that would be like if everybody here left to a different church and the only people that got saved in AAR was my family we're pretty close we got 10 people right he had eight we're we're not too far you but that that's what that would be like and and and think about that service after service I just preached in Mali come on brother come you encourage me I'll encourage you come on Haven just be encouraged pretty soon just keep being patient right and that was it and I have to keep encouraging my family and me to be patient for a hundred 20 not days years 120 years amen patience will produce maturity and the church said amen hallelujah amen the p and the preacher said amen verse five if any of you lack wisdom let him ask God that give it to all men liberally so if you don't understand something if you don't have wisdom well in most cases it's because you haven't asked now there could be times God is withholding something from you in order to test you he doesn't tell us all things right right he doesn't answer all of our prayers but I'll tell you this if you ask for wisdom to make it through you know God's going to give you that by God's grace God don't want any of us to fall right and upgrade it's not so God is that a beautiful prise God's not going to operate you or rebuke you for asking for wisdom he's going to give it abundantly amen hallelujah you know God's not going to send the rebuke Spirit back like oh I failed God when you were saying God just give me wisdom it's like Solomon remember Solomon God said because you asked for wisdom because you ask for understanding and not for riches and women and a long life because you ask for that I'm giving you what you ask for and everything else hallelujah amen amen God loved that he loved that desire that Solomon just wanted wisdom to judge the people amen hallelujah it shall be given him it shall everybody say shall shall not might it shall be given in us if we ask for wisdom amen verse six but let him ask in faith remember faith is a substance of what you hope for right I've got a substance of what I'm hoping for I've got a reality that there's wisdom out there for me I know God's going to give me wisdom I've got faith hallelujah amen amen nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed all right Hallelujah go down to verse 17 so let patience have her perfect work there's perfect is mature patience is producing maturity in our lives verse 17 every good gift and perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom is no variable e neither shadow of turning now that perfect is the one like we're perfect by the blood right because God gives perfect gifts amen God gives complete gifts Hallelujah so that that's referring to the Perfection of God God he gives you the best he finishes it when he gives you a gift it's a wonderful gift hallelujah amen verse 25 but who so lookth in the perfect law of Liberty now there it again there's a again perfect like a finishing or accomplishing the accomplish the Finish law of Liberty and continue therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed James 3 verse two qua you're doing real good tonight got a lot of I should have have warned you ahead of time you got a big work tonight here got a heavy load these are all the same word be therefore perfect for in many things we offend all If any man offend not in word the same as a perfect man that means mature of course right you can make it through a day without offending somebody Hallelujah you're mature that day and able also to Bridle the whole body look at that if you can control your mouth you can control your whole body Hallelujah remember because there's power of life and death in your mouth Hallelujah right we start saying I'm tired or I'm bored or I I need this or I got to have that what does it do the body just gives it a lot easier when we can say God have mercy if we can cry out say God keep me from Evil keep me from this don't you think God's going to answer praise God amen glory let me read this quote now that's the 17 verses where that word perfect Jesus used was in the Bible the New Testament so we're we finish that so everybody say amen amen so be it I believe it so see there's two definitions there's either Perfection through the blood God finishes a work it's all complete everything's fulfilled or it's I'm becoming more mature in Christ in that context Jesus wants us mature against those who hate us our enemies right amen now let me read this quote it's from 1950 testimony brother manam said not as we are good but M there's none good but God Amen he says but God is is in the people what makes them good marks the perfect man it's God in you that makes it perfect see and then he quotes Matthew 548 or 458 sorry be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect see be therefore perfect how can you be perfect not in yourself but in him amen so at your soul look at your soul Hallelujah your soul is your soul is perfect before God God don't look at you then he looks at him or Jesus and you say well I'm in him hallelujah how many how many are in Christ tonight amen the Bible said If any man be in Christ If any man be in the word If any man be anointed by the Holy Ghost the Bible said he's a new creature how you living a new life amen Austin just text me tonight he said I'm so glad Lena and I have lived such a new life he said said so it's just like a new life see that's how you know you're in Christ your old life has passed away behold All Things become new hallelujah amen amen the old life is gone Behold a new life has begun Amen brother said how do you get into him I like how he goes to the scripture 1 Corinthians 12:13 in Cas you how do you get to him by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and then you're in him and when you're baptized by the Holy Spirit into the body is that true and the church said amen amen yes how do you get in him you're perfect in him how do you get in him the spirit gets in you hallelujah amen new quote I'm going to a different quote brother says God has already glorified his church he says those who he is Justified he's also glorified put up um Romans 8:30 H Romans 8:30 now brother R's going to use this scripture Romans 8:30 and then he's going to reference uh Matthew 548 be therefore perfect look what he does he puts these and then I'm going to give you another verse Romans 81 he puts all these together to show how you're perfect you're now he's using the he's using Hebrews 10 now you're perfect by the blood I'm talking about that perfect I'm not talking about mature anymore I'm talking about my soul is perfect it's finished amen he's finished the book is closed Hallelujah the book is closed Jesse is saved hallelujah amen put your name in there when I do did I do sisters last time I probably did Brothers last time because there were so few Brothers here you know I could take all you sisters and put your name in there the book is closed it is finished hallelujah amen you are forever perfected because you're Sanctified by the blood of Christ Hallelujah that's the word now who are you going to take Satan or God I'll take Let's Take God every time amen let's not take a liar a bluff a line with no teeth just roaring let's not take a bluff let's not take a squatter let's take an almighty God who never had a beginning never had an ending and who died for our sins who chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world let's choose a God that loves us hallelujah amen while you are yet a sinner Christ died for you the righteous for the unrighteous amen let's choose to agree with what Christ says hallelujah Romans 8:30 moreover whom he did predestinate that he also called and whom he called then he also Justified and then he also Justified that he also glorified if you are Justified which means forgiven of your sins saved the first step of the three works of Grace the Bible says you are already glorified that means you've got a glorified body already amen you look down at yourself I don't see much Glory about me my elbow so hurts although I'm still claiming my healing by God's grace I don't see my much Glory here but that's not what he's talking about he's talking about a glorified condition he's talking about a glorified body an eternal Tabernacle waiting for you in the heavens Hallelujah if this Earthly Tabernacle be his armed you have a house Eternal already waiting Hallelujah that's how you're glorified I've already got a glorified body I've already got a home a vacation home I go to if I pass from this world hallelujah amen see B says if you're justified in Christ you're glorified in Christ already as far as God is concerned how many care what God's concerned about amen Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect how could you ever be perfect brother Malachi but in the sight of Christ tonight every born again Christian is perfect amen I'm just as perfect in God as Christ was you are every other believer it's not my holiness it's his Holiness amen how many like that quote amen then he quotes 1 Corinthians 12:13 and then go to Romans 81 honey you ought to have this me some of us ought to have this memorized by now therefore there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and a man that's in Christ Jesus walks after spiritual things Hallelujah that's why you're here tonight you're not here to get a new car tonight tonight you're not here to get a a new house you're not here to get anything natural you're here to get spiritual blessings in fact you're here to get a spiritual house hallelujah amen amen that Mansion we talked about but really the real house is a new body Hallelujah am that Eternal Tabernacle Hallelujah that house made Eternal in the heavens praise God amen amen okay so those are the verses think of that Matthew 5:48 be therefore perfect Romans 8:30 you're if you're just ified you're already glorified and then Romans 81 there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus amen you see brother's doing the same thing I'm doing I'm doing the same thing here we're trying to put all the scriptures together to show you that you are saved you're already perfect in heaven now let's focus since we know that's true let's rejoice in that and now let's let God mature us here on this Earth praise God we're already perfect in the spiritual manner now let's be spiritually mature in this manner here on Earth praise God and how do you the Bible said discern good and evil in your life don't let evil in if it's on your phone delete it as soon as possible hallelujah amen if you offended somebody call them or text them as soon as possible praise God right amen get it right judge and realize is there any is there any wedges of gold getting into your Camp Ain or Joshua you're not Ain is there any wedges in our camp Joshua or Caleb yeah let's just get out anything that would offend the Lord let's just live before him let's live true praise God Amen and all these things will bring us to maturity remember what Jesus said Jesus said you cannot be my disciple unless you take your cross daily and follow me right I mentioned that repeatedly I'm going to keep mentioning that because that's the key to maturity brother Jesse how can I be mature take up your cross daily and follow him amen find the burden find God's purpose for your life crucify the lust of your flesh and the affections thereof walk in the spirit if you're walk in the spirit you're carrying a cross hallelujah amen that just struck me amen I didn't realize that if you're walking anointed by the Holy Spirit you're carrying a burden you're burdened with something praise God Amen and it causes you have to die to yourself you don't do what you want to do you do what God wants you to do right amen walking in the spirit taking up your cross daily following Christ amen hallelujah now brother talks about a an Old Testament man I mentioned this last week I'm going to read this this two paragraphs of the quote the Old Testament man confessed his sin on the goat will say and all his sins were transferred to the goat right and then he left totally forgiven except the Old Testament was partial forgiveness right but we understand he was forgiven now brother said but this man after one time offering up I'm sorry but Jesus after one time offering up his blood sat down at the right hand of God and the Majesty on high and has perfected forever every believer that's come and been born again in the spirit of God God has perfected forever them that are Sanctified in Jesus Christ amen oh my what are we scared about let me say it again what are we scared about am We Are Forever perfected in Christ God help us not to be afraid hallelujah amen amen what are you worried about don't listen what the devil's got to say believe What God Says amen now how could I be perfect I couldn't be perfect let's say can we say that let's say I can't be perfect I can't be perfect but he said you can't be perfect but God doesn't look at us when we are born again in the body of Christ God looks at Christ Christ took my place Christ took your place he's the one that's perfect and we stand in him perfected tonight before God the Father through the offering of the blood Hallelujah all I'm trying to CL different my bad my bad now get your Bibles uh got I'm gonna have some of you read here got a who's got a B Sister Z sister Z can you get Romans 5 I'm sorry 8:15 sorry and sister who would you get Romans 8:23 so 8:15 823 got back I saw that look there Haven Romans 9:4 that's G you want look one up just pretend it's a Sunday night car you can do Galatians 45 Lydia you got your Bible Lydia uh Ephesians 15 now I want to get into adoption now this is the way I taught it and brother Sim and I were in communication about this and we just agree to differ okay but if we're if we're talking about maturity then I want to bring in a option okay and so here's how I taught it over the years even when Cam and Simon were coming to my church and even when uh the albian saints were coming this is how I've always tght adoption through the word of God okay so sister Z you want to read Romans 8:15 for ye have not rece amen now look this is the same chapter where they said there's no condemnation amen am glory amen same chapter same writer same book hallelujah amen the same man that said you have no condemnation says you already received the spirit of adoption amen and when you got that Spirit you cry ABA Father which means daddy or it's the most uh personal term to to Father Dad for me to be Dad I think of my dad love you dad I don't say Daddy Mal used to call me dadd I don't know if he does anymore I always like that when he called me Daddy lady I like when you call me dadd I like that the most enduring ter term like Zion says I love you Daddy forever you're the best daddy I love you always so whatever however you talk to your dad you know as far the person that was a dad figure that you love the most that's when we have the spirit of adoption that's what we do what do you do when you're adopted you cry out to your dad hallelujah amen want to talk to your parents I'm not an orphan I'm a child hallelujah amen I'm not forsaken I never was forsaken Hallelujah am I'm adopted I've got the spirit of adoption which there's only one Spirit that's the Holy Spirit praise God go amen I've already got it I've got the spirit of adoption uh and then Romans 8:23 sister only thank you sister same chapter same man same Holy Ghost he says you've got the spirit of God but I'm waiting for adoption uh Paul can you help me out here sure he gives us other verses so the Holy Ghost is the the spirit of adoption but adoption is not finalized until you get a new body so that's what I've always taught adoption starts when you're born again it finishes when you get a new body Hallelujah see we are waiting for oh I got the spirit of it but I'm waiting for it yes that's exactly right I got the spirit of adoption and then when I finally get that Holy body then I'm fully adopted praise God that's what the Bible says hallelujah amen I love it Romans 9:4 who did I say was that haven yeah hen there go go ahead honey are Israelites and Promises thank you H now this is speaking of Israel adopted as uh the the the child of God that's in Exodus 4:22 we're not going to read it but the Bible said Israel is my son even my firstborn son so Israel was like uh remember the remember uh Ezekiel 16 God said he found Israel now this is the allegory he found Israel lying in a pool of blood remember that it she was a little girl lying in a pool of blood God said I picked her up cleaned her off and fed her and she grew into this beautiful woman then I married her that's what what God said about Israel that's adoption right orphan child dying it's just like the Good Samaritan amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen God rescues us God Saves us God brings us back to life hallelujah amen we should have been dead but God came around and rescued Our Lives amen that's called Deliverance that's called salvation and Jehovah is our Salvation Jesus hallelujah amen Okay so the to the law the law pertained the adoption they were adopted like that the little girl was adopted cleaned up and then grew up to be this beautiful bride remember God put earrings on her remember that in the Old Testament because that was the custom of those days but we don't know that there's any holes or blood in those earrings we just said earrings right that's Ezekiel 16 see those scriptures don't scare me because I know what the rest of the Bible says amen hallelujah God said don't cut yourself don't mark yourself well they got earrings on well it's either an Old Testament custom that God had mercy on and winked at or they didn't put holes in their ears I tend to believe they didn't put holes in theirs but I'm going to stay on God's side Hallelujah I'm not going to be like the world Hallelujah now Galatians 45 let's see who had that one was it Caris to redeem them that receive the ad all right so we were under the law of sin and death right or even this might this actually speaking of the Jews the Jews were under the law but now they're under grace and they are adopted by the Holy Spirit like Paul said in Romans 8 you got the spirit of adoption when the spirit of Jesus Christ comes in you the church said am amen all right now there's only one more verse that says adoption in the entire New Testament okay L at Ephesians 1 15 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of this will amen that's it we're predestinated to adoption so what Paul say when you get the Holy Ghost now you got the spirit of adoption then when you get a new body now I am adopted amen amen hallelujah amen make sense Hallelujah now here's what I found as I studyed I shared this with our brother Simon too brother Ram never preached hear ye him after 1962 so it wasn't a it wasn't a topic he even addressed after 1962 now to me that shows he grew in some Revelation you know so that's where I look at that okay now I'm talking about maturity so if you have the Holy Ghost you're already adopted spiritually and you're fully adopted your adoption is finalized when you get a new body amen how many believe the Bible tonight amen amen hallelujah now what's interesting is I when I preach it over there I remember I preached it over in that Sanctuary over there with the albian Saints here I said this I said uh now I said this there could be an adoption moment when you're in already born again where God says hear ye him it's easy to understand for a preacher but it's a little more challenging to understand for the housewife or the sister right the only way I thought it is well now uh you know now God's really going to speak through the mother to the children that could be but based upon the scriptures I've read it looks more just more looks more simple than that right it just looks like you get the spirit of adoption you just mature mature after you got the Holy Ghost and then we get new body I'm fully adopted now nobody can take me out this family now praise God hallelujah I got the body of the family I got a Smith body or I got a sarpong body or I got a Lee body whatever you know I fit the family mold praise God Amen everybody with me amen all right so um that's that's where I can see that in the scripture I love adoption by God's grace I I love it and uh I like to say this too here um you know what it all boils down to is that we must constantly mature as Christians which means confessing our sins every day taking up our cross following Jesus am and so Simon and I both agreed you know as long as we're confessing our sins and wanting more of God we're going to be adopted praise God am the main thing is to hunger and thirst after righteousness and you and I shall be filled Hallelujah you're once filled in your soul and then the rest of your days you can try to keep your mind filled with the spirit of God hallelujah amen amen that's exactly right there's only one sealing to the day of redemption you're not sealed one out of 10 times to the day of redemption you are sealed one time to the day of redemption praise God the refilling happen in the mind I need to transform mind Hallelujah I need to get my mind off the problems I need to get my mind off politics I need to get my mind off fearful things I need to get my mind off of pleasurable things I need my mind transformed I need to get my mind back on the word of God I need my mind on fire hallelujah amen hallelujah that's a refilling that we need praise God Amen it's exactly right remember the maturity I preached on this a couple months ago P Romans 52 H Romans 52 we read two to 2 to 5 then I want to show some quotes here by God's grace I think itd be helpful here Romans 52 remember this this was this is the process of developing Christlike maturity and it ties in exactly with with what we read in James chapter 1 we should count it all joy when we fall into tribulations because tribulation will work patience amen and when we have patience we don't need anything else amen right when we got God's word when we're waiting on God when we're trusting in God we don't need anything else amen Romans 52 by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in Tribulation also knowing that tribulation Works patience and patience experience now that word experience means character and that means of course mature character so when you go through your tribulations you'll be more patient afterwards and then after your paay sh you'll have more character like Christ you'll have maturity how many know you're not going to get a big break in trials and tests how many know that you don't get too big of a break Hallelujah remember that one time the longest break I've seen sister is remember that 10 years that King ASA remember I preached on that 10 years of Peace that's the longest break I've ever seen can somebody help me oh there might be one in judges where they had 40 Years of peace or something that's right okay I could be wrong with that don't callot me 10 it could be 40 years I think Israel had peace and were not enslaves somebody share that after service okay somebody search their Bibles look up 40 years so what I'm saying is that we can trust that God won't let us get complacent that's what I want to say amen God won't let you get complacent where you're backslide and that's what that's how many how many have that desire your desire is God don't let me get so complacent so I backslide I want to be more mature praise I don't want to be a baby and then someone's got to teach me the gospel all over again that's the last thing I want to be amen is a baby what a baby we love babies but spiritual babies we don't like so much whining crying complaining all the time why why is it got to happen to me we don't like spiritual babies so much because we've all been there before right and we are embarrassed of our our child our our our uh immat our childish ways I'll say that our lack of faith our lack of prayer we should have prayed for wisdom because God just pours it out on us amen you can come to a service and you get a service load of wisdom if you just ask God for it praise God amen amen hallelujah the trouble is we don't ask God enough for it that's the trouble all right so tribulation Works patience patience Works experience which means character which is the same as maturity and character produces hope an expected end and hope does not get ashamed we're not ashamed of the gospel because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us Church said amen all right now back to the I want to get down to the statute perfect man SOA can you switch over here this is how I've always taught it and it just be a good review for us here by God's grace so here are some quotes for tonight this is part two Jesus said be therefore perfect okay now i' I've always understood from Brother Bam's teachings and the the Bible that the sealing of the Holy Ghost in the soul comes after all the virtues are already in a person's character that's how I've always taught it okay and that's how I continue to teach it because of these quotes So This is my understanding and you know brother Simon and I different brother Simon believes you get the Holy Ghost here at in the soul and then you build up with there and then that I think represents the Rapture if I'm not mistaken or something like that but he and I were talking about so this is the way I've always thought this how I wrote it in my book this is how I understand it when you are Justified now you have faith you're saved okay you get Sanctified as God adds to your your character he adds virtue he adds knowledge Temperance patience God is brother kindness and then you're born again this and this is the sphere of adoption right there all right so that that's how I understand that now what's this we we don't know brother Ram didn't explain it really thoroughly if you just go read second Peter 1 this is not in here because really this is the same as that because the Bible said add to brotherly kindness charity which is love and what is love God is love what is God the Holy Ghost okay so I'm not sure why brother taught that he was still growing remember he put this out in 1962 he got the revelation of the Holy Ghost the next year all right and he never went back and preached this again so God had him preach on other things like thank God marriage and divorce Hallelujah lots of Seven Seals thank God we sure needed that the token amen we just needed all these God's only provided place to worship hallelujah amen okay so when you get that when God fills you with the Holy Ghost in your soul your soul is sealed now you got the spirit of adoption amen amen okay and now God will mature you through your life right and then when you get your new body now you can say I'm adopted completely amen all right and I got scripture to back it all up like you just read Hallelujah all right now here's the quotes that that proves to this brother Jesse did you make that up no I did not I did not brother R says then Peter says here first seven things Faith virtue see come up knowledge Temperance patience godess Brotherly Love adly kindness and then the love of God the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got all these virtues sealed in you everybody see that then it's a process the love of God is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is Christ in you in the person of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then all these virtues not a s p virtues are sealed in you now look the word sealed Ephesians 4:30 right you're sealed to the day of redemption amen right all right that's there's not just one oh brother Jesse there's just one no there's more than one here's number two when a man possesses these kind of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift God's Got You might do that but until these virtues here go into you you're still off the real true foundation of Faith but when those these virtues grow in and you add it to that then you are a living Monument amen hallelujah so you first that's two quotes first you possess all the attributes then the Holy Ghost seals youen brother Jess say there only two quotes well there's more than two here's the third one add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge Temperance patience Godly godl brotherly kindness to your brother love the Holy Spirit and Christ will come amen because just beneath him the holy spirit is to manifest Jesus Christ in the church to manifest those virtues so see you out of all those anointings and then Christ comes how many glad he comes amen Church the answer is always this I need more of God no matter where you are justification satification baptism Holy Ghost we need all we always need my always answer is get more of God hallelujah draw back to God he'll draw night to you amen oh such an easy easy formula Hallelujah repent of your sins and draw night to God God will draw night to you amen well J there only three Quotes no there's more than three quotes number four this is the uh the night after he preached the stat perfect man the Lord bless you brother Neville so happy to be back in church tonight just a teeny bit horse that's what I say every Thursday and Monday kind of a long message this morning I'm sure happy I it was here though and enjoyed it myself bringing it and I do hope you enjoy hearing it that's what I say on Monday I hope the church enjoyed the sermon don't forget now always remember that these are the things that build the servant of Christ how many want to be servants out there see Faith first then virtue and now remember the Holy Spirit cannot cap the building until these things are operating by the spirit no matter what you do see those are the things that builds the body of Christ see those things is there only four brother Jesse no there's more than four now don't forget that that here it is is first is your faith virtue now so forth is to be added in until the complete stature of Christ is made manifest then the Holy Spirit comes upon it and seals it into one body Hallelujah there's the word word sealed sealed to the day of your Redemption praise God oh am I wearing you out Church all right hoping for a few more amens these things must be therefore Jesus said by their fruits they known see fruit you cannot bear fruit without these things to bear in you and then when all this takes place of the worldliness and ungodliness and so forth that all the belief has cast out that all the things of the world has passed away that there's nothing but a new creature in Christ and then Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed to the day of your Redemption so sealed sealed same scripture seal in the kingdom of God now don't forget that keep that mind now takes these things first then the ceiling is the Holy Spirit the cap that seals us into the body praise God it cannot be any more clear as far as my humble opinion is there more than five brother Jesse there more than five and now as in the individuals these virtues and things our knowledge and Temperance is added to our faith then when the Capstone comes the Holy Spirit cements it together Hallelujah there is the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's why it's so short today amen that's why people last in message church is so short they only stay here for a few years right or let me say like this they only stay for a few decades I was telling let me just share this again I don't know if I should you know we've had people that we thought were seal with the Holy Ghost come to this church and Lead we have down at Junction City we have all these young mothers and young sisters just wonder if they got the holy ghost or not and I told them on Sunday I said it can be so simple as you sitting by a beach reading your Bible and the Holy Ghost falls on you and you start crying and worshiping the Lord like my wife got the holy ghost or it could be so simple you're in a Sunday morning service listening to the preacher and you just stand up and raise up your hands and you see some Vision in your mind or whatever I saw and you start weeping and crying say praise God and you walk out there feeling like like you love everybody it can be that simple and I told him this there's my 45 minutes okay I'm and I said don't over complicate it look for a time when you the Holy Ghost fell on you and you saw and people could have saw it and heard it I said there there's probably people walking by Christen maybe at the at the beach that maybe maybe no one is around but if somebody would have been around someone would have said something's wrong with her I can see her crying I can hear her crying something is what's wrong with her did her boyfriend hurt her feelings oh no he's a good [Applause] man she laugh but see you could have saw and heard definitely at church when I got the Holy Ghost you would saw me and heard me definitely right hallelujah amen and I knew something happened something happened I love I was in love with God more I just wanted to love people I remember on the way home I was fighting with the brother John I could pay for his meal I think I paid for his meal if I'm not misten I got to pay for you buddy no I'm pay no I'm pay let's fight about it no it's not it's not do that but I said I said I said sisters don't get discouraged either because you can have some miraculous experience and then fall away from the message right and I said there was a family used to come here there're in the message over 40 years I thought both them had the Holy Ghost now I don't know one of their testimonies was that when they were 17 years old if I'm not mistaken they were in a service and they spoke in tongues at that service and their dad had to carry them in the car take them home they spoke in tongues all night and then this same person has now left the message church and the the women looked at me like those former Amish people and they're like how could they leave this that's what I say how can I leave amen this is what I wanted my whole life amen hallelujah amen you see no matter what experience you got you better make sure your life lines up with the word of God let me this you better discern good and evil in your life and that person confessed to me on an email and said I never did fast or pray one day in my life yet spoke in tongues a whole night so see thank God for gifts but it's just a gift because just I'm just I'm not holding the gifts down but I'm saying gifts don't save you gifts don't seal you Hallelujah the holy ghost in your soul seals you Hallelujah am right this person said they never fasted never prayed and fasted and then when it come down to the end they let the bars down on their their last few teenagers and let all this sin come in let the girls cut their hair all these a real child of God wouldn't do that right I'm talking about a born again child of God I'm talking about born again so see I told those sisters learn from that it can be so simple you know it can be so simple look at a life that manifests Christ look look for a life that's capped off by the Holy Spirit praise God Amen I thank God for every experience I've ever had I thank God for every experience we've had here but the thing to do is keep maturing in Christ amen hallelujah well brother Jesse surely there can't be more there there's a few more quotes you remember the py message it's the Capstone what it do the Holy Spirit capped off the individual and seal it when we added to our faith righteousness godliness faith and so forth kept adding to it till we got seven things the seventh one was love which is God and that's how he makes the indiv and cast him and seals him with the Holy Spirit Well Jesse could there read one more there's one more see I'm not I'm not making the subjects before I wrote that book how many days did I fast and pray how many sermons did I fast and I just laid on my face that God show me the truth of IT thing is the thing is Hunger for More of the Holy Ghost amen God add to me I had to I need more I want my character to be like you and I'm gonna enjoy the journey don't stress yourself out too much enjoy the journey amen see like that that's what God did to me I think I was remember I told you before I got the Holy Ghost I would just cry shout up in my uh my attic room there and I just wanted to see an angel I just wanted to see something but God just let me cool down I got you know uh I just all I got all focused on our wedding and everything I forgot some details in our wedding so that was really bad try to make up for it over the years but see God just let me let all the pressure off All the nervousness God just let me get married and then God drops down and visits me see just something so simple praise God something so simple just keep hungering and thirsting after the word of God when you get the Holy Ghost You' got the spirit of adoption so you cry out to your daddy Lord I need you God I need you add to your faith virtue and so forth all this in First Peter First Peter 1 I believe is the first chapter where it's all added to your faith all these things godliness and Purity and Holiness and everything and then you're sealed by the Holy Ghost then see add all that add all that then you get the Holy Ghost did I put this one in there okay now that's else I'm not going to go through that one Hallelujah all right thank you so in closing we have seen Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect we can see God is asking us to become a mature Church how many believe thaten God is asking us to let him continually add more of his word to us more of his Spirit to us right in other words we got to invite God into every area of Our Lives amen praise the Lord and God will fill you at a time at that's the right time the one young sister it was uh brother Levi's stepdaughter Annie I think and she sends her greetings she's the one that went on I think a 40-day fast and then she got the Holy Ghost that's the only person I know that ever did that but she was telling me why she said um she said she was hurt by all these friends who are making uh fun of her how can I say this just I'll just say like just general making fun of her and so she realized wow I've been seeking the Holy Ghost and I have all this bitterness in me she said she said she was seeking the Holy Ghost for I think 16 or 17 years and she said then it all struck her while she was fasting I had bitterness toward my cousins I think it's the cousins they would make fun of her size and they make fun of things about her and she called them up and said I have this bitterness against you will you forgive me now think about that she said the ones that she didn't have phone numberers she wrote them letters and she said with each time with she said with each person she contacted she felt like a a weight came off her and she said she got to the spot where she had no more nothing against anybody all cleaned out and it just struck me now what's the last one running just struck me right now I didn't even see a toone right now her family her and these were church members she said I can't wait for them to see me she said that through that fast I lost I think she said 90 pounds and they said you'll never lose it because you're you're not pretty so see it was all this it was a natural and spiritual for her and she and and she you know she said uh she said I don't care if anybody tells me I'm ugly or anything like that she said I know right now if if I could I would sit right on jesus' lap and I would be Jesus's little daughter and she was like beaming smiling and she went from a real quiet lady there and now she's all talking to the sisters about being born again and how much she loves Jesus it's like a fire's been lit amen hallelujah her candle's been lit Hallelujah and like all these you know older women down there are kind of looking at her like she's this example of how to receive the Holy Ghost but I'm also trying to encourage them you don't have to fast 40 days for the Holy Ghost you got to get brotherly kindness Hallelujah you got to get patience you got to get godliness you got to get all those things get your heart cleaned out hallelujah amen amen right and seek God with all your heart let's stand to our feet musicians be therefore perfect even as my father which is in heaven is perfect how many want to be more like Jesus that's why I want more than anything praise God want people to see Christ in me I want my children to see Christ in me I want my wife to see Christ in me I want my teenagers to see Christ in me Hallelujah glory to God let's bow our head for
