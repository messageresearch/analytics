let's stand together tonight little like to see the little ones participate amen amen you may not remember but that little song God is watching me you remember me telling you about that one that's the one that wrote that right there analyse amen she's she's famous around the world for that little song I guess we've sang it everywhere and I know it's been a lesson to many people she's working on another one something about and she ain't got it together yeah but it's something about when the devil says boo I say who and how many it's gonna be a good one I know it's coming on and I'm just waiting for it amen but we we like to see the Lord bring inspiration a man that I believe it can come no matter what the age is I don't think it has to be you know any kind of great big adult type thing you're nothing like that God could fall on a little sister here it could fall on sister here it could fall on these little young uns I I just believe God's mindful of us and he gives us songs in the night I think this at one time Amen I I like that hey let's turn in the Bible again diffusions chapter for a man I want to go a little bit different route this morning I felt like the the message as far as I'm concerned was right on target and I just feel like it's where we're living at and where we're at and I really felt like it was a blessing to the people and and I trust you were blessed by the words that were sitting you know usually in evangelism you and you you like brother Joel Forney says you helicopter up and parachute out well one thing I like about coming to Akron is I don't have to get in that mode when I'm there I can kind of slow down teach a little bit pardon me and get into a couple things and the depth of the scripture I I kind of like that because anybody that knows anything about my ministry at all they know I like to teach and I enjoy that I guess I'm a teacher at heart and I I enjoy being able to teach people the Word of God I think one of the most important things forgive me that we can learn is the precious Word of God don't you think so amen it's food and life and substance to all of us and I just thank the Lord for the Word of God all right you're reading with me now in Ephesians chapter 4 and we're gonna pick it back up again the Lord well in here on verse 25 and then we just want to read just a a verse or two of that the Lord helping us and then I want to try if got to give me the grace to get down to a few more places that I wanted to get to this evening wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor he says for we are members one of another did you notice that we are members one of another we are what not divided we're one a man we're one body and members in particular when one hurts we all hurt when one rejoices we all rejoice right now verse verse thirty-two drop it down there to where we picked up this morning for our thought be ye kind one to another be ye kind one to another let's pray Lord Jesus we thank you for your word Lord what a privilege it is to be gathered again in the house of the Lord hear the songs of Zion sang and how it thrills our hard to hear people to worship and for Lord we know that you dwell in our worship and our praise you come like is a place that we would make a boat a house or a bed or rest our praise is that place for your weary feet traveling through lady who see you Lord God may we just wipe those precious feet with the tears and with the hair no God as it was with a little prostitute that time and we take our glory for the woman's hair is her glory she laid it at the feet of Jesus Lord may we do that even right here this evening Lord lay all of our glory thoughts and attitudes and opinions and ever what might be of us that we laid at the feet of the Lamb of God help us as we look into the word I pray your blessing speak to us now as we commit the word to you both speaker listener in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you may be seated I usually have to ask the Saints to say man but thank you sir but y'all had such a good a man that I didn't even have to say everybody say hey man that was all right I like that and I thank the Lord for what we've read here I believe this is the Word of God and part of maybe a little drink water I got a tickle in my throat there you know that's one thing I don't like to tickle the devil I like to yell at it maybe it's like that now looking at the the verses that we read I want to really concentrate upon this what you hear in verse 25 we are members one of another that we are one body one soul one mine in the book of Philippians Paul identifies when he says be you therefore like-minded he said be like-minded the term that he uses they're like-minded actually in the original Greek word means to be of the same soul in other words to be knit together as one or I feel that if we could recognize that part of the reason the Apostle Paul was dealing with the people in this regard was that he wanted them to understand that you are one body one mind one purpose your knitted together by the Holy Spirit and if you got the Holy Ghost and I've got the Holy Ghost brother Brennan said that Jesus burst himself on the day of Pentecost and that one pillar of fire went to you and went to me and went to others he said then when we come together to church like this he said it's like bringing that pillar of fire all back together again so we we are we are knit together in that relationship of being Christians children of God born again by the Holy Spirit and all of God's virtues everything you vested down inside of us to make the character of the bride of Jesus Christ it's given to us for the purpose of not only edifying Christ to the world but being able to take that little part of God that lays down inside of your heart and being able to use that to benefit the rest of the body Paul goes on to tell us and we don't have time to read these things I'll keep you here another two hours if I get into all that but I ain't gonna preach that loan tonight I'm just gonna jewel for any helicopters up parachutes I'm gonna use a parachute I'm just gonna get to the end and jump out and amen I I know it's I know it's Sunday evening but I want to just look for just a moment at a couple things about this body of Christ now going back into Ephesians there I want you to just to back up to the first chapter in that forth I'm sorry the first verse I mean to say in the fourth chapter and just read just a moment or two if you would just to get a background of this what I want to say what she says I therefore the of the Lord beseech you that you want worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called with all lowliness and meekness long-suffering bearing forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace there is how many bodies one body there is one spirit even as you called in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all through all and Paul was a little bit of a bill Hillary is sitting in y'all amen it's in us that Christ as I referred to you earlier about this Jesus being Christ in you but notice one one one one one all through the theme of this is one body one Lord one Christ now we recognize that I'm just going to touch that for just a moment because I just want to get that in there so you can understand where I'm heading tonight but for us is the body of Christ everything that we are is made up of God now you remember what the prophet of God said in the rapture message he said that if you're a Christian right here tonight you were in God your father before the foundation of the world every gene every attribute every thought of God was in Christ before there was a son before there was a moon before there was anything at all God had all of us inside of him could you say it this way that we were one in Christ Jesus before the foundation of the world our names wrote on the Lamb's Book of Life our part to play was laid there in the mind of God we were one now we know according to what happened in the Garden of Eden that Satan then separated that fellowship from God and mankind you realize you look at the Garden of Eden what a perfect situation it was and you look at how the Holy Spirit set them or the Jesse in a paradise of God perfect every way that a man could think of perfect perfect love perfect joy perfect peace all of these perfect existed in the Garden of Eden yet you realize that God never intended for them to remain in that condition god never intended for the Garden of Eden to remain perfection but rather contrast the holy spirit had ordained Eve to be a type of condition her body everything was orchestrated so that Satan could get to her and caused the fall as he did in the Garden of Eden and in doing so it would break this place of perfection because remember the Prophet tells the spoke Virgil seed also Christ as the mystery that God predestinated Eve that she would fall from the Garden of Eden so it was not God's intention to place man in this perfect paradise place he brought thereby and and then allowed them to stay in such a state of perfection but actually God to break that perfection and allow it to be broken so that all of the attributes that laid on the inside of a man could be manifested through this negative line of Satan coming and defiling mankind and bringing all of his unbelief and what more to the earth now that was entirely and perfectly part of the will of God God intended for man to come to the eden come to this place of perfection and then allow the devil to break it through man into the permissive will of God and yet now this is what God intended to wrap back around in the end that he would take man out of permissive will place him right back into oneness again and then take him right back into the Garden of Eden and make it just as though he never fell in the beginning Amen it's a beautiful plan it's a beautiful plan of redemption it's a beautiful program that God's laid out for you and I but in this condition down here on the earth were all busted up were not one together like we should be one but there's separations there's schisms there's family strains and genetics and this thing and that thing that makes us different one from another for example there's people sitting in this room tonight in this little church here that they've got German running through them some have got Irish running through them some have got maybe maybe African descent running through them some have Asian descent running through them all of these little differences that let you you know this I found out just recently the name nor odd we thought come from France but actually goes farther than that it actually comes from Nordica from the Vikings and that's where the name narada ridge i said that's the reason i preach like i do i'm part viking amen i plunder and steal and all that kind of stuff but it's just the devils king and that's all I'm working on amen steel enjoy back in steel in peace back a man a man and you realize all of these different strains and things running down through us there's little divisions even in our skin color and our culture's and how we were raised the backgrounds of our alive and yet as we looked at as we closing this morning how that the Prophet said and the Michael said that God wanted unity out of his people he wanted us to be one even jesus prayed that way let them be one even as we in heaven are one Oh God now we realize in order for us to get there then we're first going to have to recognize our position in the body of Christ amen amen because once you see your position in the body of Christ then you realize nobody can take your place let me just say it this way once God puts you in nobody can hire you nobody can fire a man it's just as simple as there is saying one two three because once you are born again as a child of God once you receive the Holy Spirit you are in the body of Christ and can never be separated from the hand of God hey even Paul made the remark he said tell me what can separate us a man he said can famine can death can peril can sword can any of these things separate us he said no he said nothing can separate us from the love that is in Christ Jesus amen so as we were one with God we were also one with another the woman said to brother Branham at time said now brother Brennan said I don't understand this about Jesus being one with God being God you know and all this he said then the Bible say my wife and I are one said that's right and maybe it's the brother talkin and the sister EVER who spoke it I think she stepped out of her sister me t stepped out and other madam said now it's different in this way said we're one he said but when you see me you don't see me T he said but when Jesus spoke he said when you see me you've seen the father he said so a man and woman can be one but true one this goes beyond just being United in marriage just just consummating a marriage and being united by the way of the flesh remember what Paul spoke there in the book of Romans or Corinthians rather when he said that a man that joins himself to a harlot he's one with her he might be one by the way of the flesh his flesh may join with that woman and by the way of the flesh there might be a unity and even science will tell you there's a mixing of the chemistry there's a mixing of all types of little things that take place whenever a man and woman lay in the bed together forgive me for being plain but that type of oneness is not the kind of oneness that God is wanting out of us in other words the Lord Jesus is wanting us to be so absorbed in him that when you see us you see the Lord Jesus Christ when you see Christ you see the bride we are one we are one we are one in Christ Jesus amen amen oh it just gets good and good and good or don't it him had a man that's right then Paul tells us let all these things bitterness and wrath and clamor evil speaking want more let them depart and put them away from us why because we are one amen why would you want to have hatred against your arm I like my arm I like where is that if I Know Who I am how could I get mad at my foot your stupid foot I don't like it I'm gonna cut him off I would want to do that he's me a man if my foot stupid the rest of me is stupid hey hey come on somebody because what I am everything else is that's right exactly right now watch now as we as we look at this oneness of the Holy Spirit now I just want you to look at this remark ritum Adam says like this and I just love how he says about going to the house of God he said you see when you really hang on to every word of God he said see it's a leper who said like you take a boy and a girl going together he said if that young lady says well mama wants me to go with this guy but I can't stand him could you imagine what a love affair goes that way you pick it up for a date you imagine you curled your hair you're ready you see got perfume on the whole thing and he shows up you don't care if he's late you don't care if he's early you don't care if he ever shows up you know mama making me curl my hair mama making me wear perfume mom making me do this that the other well I've got to cuz that's what she said on a new hey man brother man said that's no love affair he said that when people go to church why does he preach so long what about all this other stuff and everything like that but man says see you're not in love amen he said because that woman he said if she's heard that girl said if she's going with that boy and she really loves him then it took it's not a drudgery so her it's not a chore do you know coming to church for some people as a chore it's a drudgery it's something they got to do to keep from going to hell you're not loved because if you're in love with Jesus coming to church and got nothing to do with keeping from going to hell if you're in love with Jesus coming to church is so that you can get me amen oh I just love it don't you love it so you come to the house of God it's so that you can find love of God so you can talk to your lever to your Redeemer any man I just love it that's why you come to church some I say well I come to church because I like the singing wonderful some I said I come to church I like the preacher wonderful but why are you in the house of God if it's not for a love affair that's what God wants out of us is a love affair with Jesus Christ that's right remember even brother Bama said it like this I quoted this some time ago and I'll tell you I I turned some message people upside down the other day and I didn't mean to because they are kind of these intellectual bumps they thought maybe the more they memorize the more they were going to go to heaven I guess there's going to be a special place in heaven for the folks that memorized every quote I guess I don't know to them it must have been and I quoted this under the inspiration of the Lord I didn't mean to say it it just comes through the inspiration of preaching and I said to know the book is not to know him well you should sing the metres per cup because today I'm knowing the book was life but then I found in several places where the prophet of God said to know the book is not to know life but to know Him who is the author of this word that's what life comes people that's got it in their mind I'll memorize the message I'll memorize the quotes I memorized that's wonderful but that's still you can do all of that and still not know Jesus Christ exactly said see you're not in love but when you hang on every word oh that's how I see people come to church if I have if I have a training class for people this is going to be the first lesson right here learn how to hang on every word falling in love of Jesus I promise brother sister the problem I think that we see around the message friends is that people just aren't in love with the Lord that's what it really boils down to they they like the church they like the people that go to the church they enjoy the area or the location or whatever just like when I was in Grand Falls new Newfoundland this last weekend now you don't know where Newfoundland is unless you're a new for yourself because nobody goes there it's not a vacation spot you might go there to see twill and gating icebergs but after 20 seconds tours over it just isn't a vacation spot is cold all the time we were there last weekend I mean I don't think you got above 60 degrees one day I think you'd hit 72 and that was a heat wave people were out in their bikinis and everything on the lawns and and playing in the water I thought God we still got a coat on a man it's not even right just yet you understand but you know those people down there their pastor died on about five about four years ago and I was asking some of the people this question now they're the only church in that area there's not another Church within about four and a half hours is the only other Church on that island out there and I asked some of them folks I said not ask you a question I said if God sent you a man toot willing gate which is two and a half hours away from them I said in God sent you a pastor two and a half hours away I said how many of you be willing to pack up and move well you talk about a mule staring at a new gate everybody looking at me I said so in other words what you're trying to say is that you want go to provide a manager convenience rather than provided because you're in love of Christ and I wonder friends if that ain't why some people just come to church because it's convenient for them to come to the house of God because it works into their schedule Oh Lord the longer I preach quarter sum you get now this that's exactly what you got to ask yourself remember the Queen of the South a brother broke it down one time and I'll tell you that the numbers are staggering when you look in today's figures all of that money and things that she was able to put together it was in the billions and the trillions of dollars that she's sold and brought with her and what more to hear the wisdom of Solomon you know I think about some of you people sitting out here amen some of you got two and three hour drives going in out-of-home I think about these folks here Wendy and some of y'all that live way on alpha wait amen you're not coming all these miles to occupy a room I know air conditioned in it because you like the Church of the color of the chairs but you're coming because you love Almighty God and you're hoping to meet Jesus while you're here amen but yet brother Bama said people and air-conditioned Cadillacs won't go across the street to hear the gospel and she sold out everything she had to hear the wisdom of Solomon Amen it wonders makes you wonder are people in love today the question that I really want to find out from message people as I travel is are we really in love with Jesus or we love with a message or a messenger or a church or a way of doing things that makes us feel good about our religion you see people can go to a scary movie and they can have chills run down their back then come church and have the same feeling we don't come to church for the feeling of it I love to feel the Lord but my loyalty doesn't move on the feelings I feel hey come on some on it I don't move because I feel a certain way I am a priest called of God to sacrifice and worship and you know what whether I feel him or whether I don't feel it I am called to worship him anyways ever and eyelash of no matter whether I feel it or I don't but for some people it's the convenience of the thing if Jesus is having and being it for them to feel blessed or they'll be blessed that night but they don't want to move out of their comfort zone to work in a way that maybe the blessing would be a far off but you've got to work for it oh I know we don't like this kind of preaching as human beings because any time we have to work that's hard we don't like that I think some Christians have moved into spiritual retirement around this message a man they just want to sit on a Pew and draw a spiritual pension well I'm getting over am i but it's the truth anyhow hey that's right but to get somewhere in God you've got to make the efforts that it takes to be able to bond in the holy spirit that's right he said see you're not in love he said hanging out when you really love him you're hang on to every word he said just as the Holy Spirit gave warning this morning he said hanging every word he said he might have been talking about that see it's eternal life every word of God then he says these words and listen to this it's a joy to go to church under any circumstance I didn't know the second dinner won't be waiting on that part but I think the Lord let me put this quote in here just for this little body this weekend but brother BAM says whether it's hot you ought to be able to say Amen relied on that one and whether it's cold whether it's indifferent whether the people are fussing or growling or whatever they're doing it is a joy to hear the word of the Lord amen amen he says then you're in love then with Christ you love to go to church he says Oh hallelujah oh thank you lord thank you lord now that's where a Christian are to look at this because we are one body we are one together in a way that the Holy Spirit has knit us together now watch this you have to have respect for each other now this morning we were looking at a couple of things that Paul said one thing that we didn't touch was this on anger be ye angry and sin not now let me just give you the idea what anger means here anger is clamor or noise or disorder or men words that men would use in a brawl men the words that meant men would use in a brawl he said but Christians are to be calm there are to be serious without contention and strife and he said without brawls and Tolman's he said not to be known among the people he said but anger is also unreasonable anger it makes sense when somebody does something to be upset about it you're a human being you're never going to turn that off somebody does something wrong cut you off in traffic ever what it might be that human reaction raises up that's something that's a part of you all the days of your life but don't give yourself over to becoming unreasonably angry angry to the point to where you start making steps or taking steps to try to get back at that person or to try to show them your mind I've told people a thousand times be careful giving pieces of your mind the way you've only got so many you may end up running out after a while amen but everybody's got this attitude this idea well glory to God I want to tell you something right now they've done such and said I'm gonna boil it out for it that's unreasonable anger there is an anger that is reasonable to God you say well I don't believe that well you just need to read the Bible Jesus looked on him with anger amen brother man who said he was acting like a deacon when he took chords and beat him out of the temple one day well that's what he said he said he was acting like the part of a deacon playing the role of the deacon he said Amen listen if a deacon walked in here tonight and took chords and beat you out of the church you had put it on the Better Business Bureau on Facebook you would join we believe the sign and everybody they wouldn't wasn't believed in the Sun hey come on somebody why because as humans that humans something in us always trying to get back amen but Paul says you're one you're one and if you realize what you do to this one you're doing it to yourself what you do to that one you're doing it to yourself because if they're a part of the body of Christ and I'm part of the body of Christ what I do to you is I'm doing it to myself exactly listen this for example in respects here's a good example of one tall mount paragraph 165 with a man who says now if you can't respect the man respect the office that he holds a man that's exactly right he said see if a minister comes your pastor he said always respect him I've heard congregations talk about their pastor run him down ridiculing he said how is that pastor ever gonna do anything for you he can't do it he said I don't say this Church but I see churches he said that that's done that he said you've got to love your pastor you've got to know that he's a human being oh don't rush past that that's a good thing to know you got to know he's a human being listen I know Jesse's repopulating Ohio I get that I know he's Superman I know he can he can leap a troop and I know the man can do anything but he's still a man I know that he doesn't keep a Superman ass underneath that shirt and tie that he's wearing he's a human being he gets discouraged sometimes he gets upset at conditions he sees people get into sometimes that human part gets aggravated see you know a Manjula but see if I hadn't run past that quote we'd have some good preaching right here but to me this is the good preaching but he's everybody's a he's a pastor he should put up with it he's built to do it but he's still a human being and listen just because the man has got a gift in his life that doesn't mean that he doesn't feel sometimes like you wish he didn't have it well hallelujah we're gonna get as quiet as a method sent here for us over with he's a human you got to understand that are you saving Laurie to God if he's a pastor he can't make no mistakes where's that in the Bible I'd like to know chapter verse and quote I'd like to see where people get this idea if he's a preacher he's not allowed to make any mistakes what about turn that around on congregations what about set it on a message congregation your to make any mistakes because you're a congregation getting quietly amen hey sauce for the goose is good for the gander y'all what if you turn two thing around but you see as human beings were bound to do things and miss the mark sometimes there's times that I that I the Lord of correct me on something I realize I've absolutely missed the mark of God Lord of show me I have to make a tried oh it discourages me to death when I find out that I've done something this pleases the Lord I hate it I hate it I kicked around for days oh I repent and I put it his hands all that but I still remember the crazy thing I remember what I did and it frustrates and I get aggravated at myself and I think why in the world did you do the stupid thing that you've done ten thousand times you know you shouldn't have done it you done it again anyhow but I'm a human being I'm susceptible to do things as a human would do it so before you can have the right respect you got to know he's a pastor but he's a human bastard hey man we we bout to sing a man a man and a man hallelujah right but yet God made him his pastor with him said his pastor like that the Holy Ghost made him overseer and you've got to respect him in that manner in what manner that he's a pastor but he's also a human listen friends I've heard people around this message look at that I mean in their way there may not say this from their lips but they're looking for the perfect Church I said it doesn't exist and if it did the minute you show up you've earned it but you're not perfect yourself neither am i there's no way that we can have perfection amongst us Christ is the one that perfects us Christ in Christ alone our perfection is between my soul and God my flesh will never be perfected it can't be it's an enemy to God only the best thing I can do is take this enemy and put the chains of the Word of God around him and drag the rapture and make him live right make him pray make him go to church make him love one another mm-hmm were one you've got to respect him you said if you can't respect him in your heart as God's servant he said you said then you respect can't respect to manage that respect his office if you could respect him in your heart as God servants that God will respect you for doing that amen that's right he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me a man jesus said I said he's a representative or an ambassador of me either don't receive me receive him that I sent rather cannot receive me he said that God was there they said god is our father Abraham is our Father instead of God with your father and so forth he said you would understand me he said but you are of your father the devil why because they would not receive Jesus whom God sent to the earth as a representative of Almighty God but then remember he said you've got to respect him and believe him that he is Martha standing at the chat the grave of Lazarus the pastor didn't respond in four days now you know what a lot of people would have done then it picked up their membership went somewhere else I can't get him to answer the phone I can't are you serving the pastor you're serving God which one are you serving and then you take a man like brother Jesse he's raising a family like I said he's repopulating Ohio him my brother-in-law is the same way I keep quoting to him what brother mom said to Billy Paul that dot he said multiply and replenish but he didn't leave the job all in one person he works he's got a job I'm just I'm just I'm picking on everybody today I guess he's got things that he's got to do he's got kids he's got a raise he's got a wife he's got to take care of he's got a minister he's got to think about he's got outreach is out there people can't expect a man to be at their beck and call although they do they expect that they expect the man to have all the answers a moment they ask him well here at pasture you should know the answer but is a human pastor he's a human being that may not know the answer till he prays about it a while studies have added a while sees what the prophets see what brother bream said and the Bible said about certain things he's a human being but can you understand just this little example how disjointed the people of the churches can get if we'll one they cannot take their attack against their own body do you realize that when the churches attack the pastor the pastor attacks or the church attacking one another do you know what it is it's called suicide it's the very same principle is if a man or woman would hang them set foot a gun to their head it's the same idea altogether to assassinate your brother is to hurt you as well praise the Lord spiritual suicide in the churches listen to this and why we're not a denomination but Bevin said one reason that we're not a denomination he said because we don't answer to anybody he said I like that I'd rather stay clean and pure before the word of God he said and stand there and say there's no man's blood upon my garment he says is the best way we stayed to brendham tabernacle we're not Assemblies we're not oneness we're not Jesus only we're not Methodists we're not Baptist this little Tabernacle here we have no denomination all were free in Christ that's why we stay the way we do and God has blessed us and helped us he said now we tell why we take what he said we tell you why we take communion and tell you why we take feet wash and we don't won't let members take it if we know that they're in sin he said that's why this last two or three weeks I've been going from one member to another and watch this well you're a little having your little fuss is going around going around wouldn't speak to one another pass one other on the road and turn your head shame on you he says you who took the blest cup of God across this altar here and call you brothers and sisters and then get on the telephone and get off about one another you're not fit to be called Christians when you're that way he said that's right keep often telephones or Facebook or Twitter or Instagram or whatever else they're using if you can't talk good about somebody don't talk at all amen remember God's gonna hold you responsible not now why is brother Branham dealing with this because we're one I mean friends if if they're not one then why even care let him fuss let them argue let him just let them carry on and create a bunch of nonsense it who cares let them do it they want to do I've heard I've heard ministers of the Gosselin I don't care what they do something wrong cuz we're one and if we're one we should care one another listen if you don't show up to church here pull is missed your pool is missed you don't take part in communion it's missed feet washing brother jewel for nieces foots washing all of these things make us body make us one we're one in spirit one and heart that's right well somebody started a little something said he needs to come to me my bands oh no you're wrong he said the Bible said you go to him hi-y friends because we're one if something is wrong with my body and let's say a gangrene sets up in the in my finger well I'm not gonna look at that gangrene say when you're ready to get it right come see me I'm going to it I'm gonna go right to the source of that problem and I'm gonna say you're getting fixed if I ignore don't kill me if I ignore it it'll take Christ right out of my life we're a body don't forget this is one body right he said now he said when they won't listen to you take a witness he said then they tell it to the church and then 30 days is these people that sit in sin now and done things you know that's that's Bremen said insulting the women or trying to make perverts on the boys or something like that but he said if they want to live right live clean you know the blood of Christ protects them but he said as long as that brothers under the protection of the church the blood of Christ is protecting that's the reason the church doesn't get rolling he said notice he said for example say Leo and I had a fuss here he said well you know you wronged me he said I'm supposed to go to him he's a member of this church he become a Christian takes communion the rail with me here been baptized the name of Lord Jesus walking upright his brothers he said it ain't the man he said what you realize 90% of the time it's the devil that's got between people hey man and as long as you're letting the devil do that you're harming your brother so you see for yourself when something's wrong you don't wait for somebody to come make it right with you that'd be like saying okay gangrene fix it you got a you got a a deadly sore it's gonna kill you but you be the fixer he can't he's sick and the Bible said you that are spiritual or can I say this way you that are healthy you go to the sick one and you try to restore them back into the phone hey man that's Bible teaching but BAM said if there's something wrong with Leo and I said we go make it up he said it's your duty to come say now both boys have got this together they're getting the things straightened up he said they come to the church and said at first we find it can't agree when you come to the church like that they said as long as you don't do nothing about it the blood of Jesus Christ protects us both lyses words he said but that old cancer will start another cancer and then that cancer will start another cancer and another and another and another until the heart church will be sick over this one little thing he said then you'll come to church and it'll be just as cold the janitor will have to break the icicles before the congregation can even get in why because people don't recognize were one one body one group were one of another amen were one of another notice in the word of the church Christ is the mystery I'm not gonna read the whole thing we've read it probably ten thousand times but I just want to catch a couple highlights he said love one another but everything love one another there's John the Revelator he wrote the seals wrote the thunders wrote the plagues wrote the vials and his dying days they set him up in a low chair could even stand and preach anymore and just leaned back as a little children love one another it is the theme of all of our Christian experience if we are one with another then above everything else love one another no matter what the devil tries to say glory you're all one big great sweet group now but remember my warning Satan won't let it stay that way boy did he ever come in and fulfill these words later on he said he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make him the target he'll bring a critic unbeliever and cause them to fellowship under quietness and things and shoot that guy with poison stuff and when we talked about this morning then boysenberries shoot him with poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it don't have nothing to do with anything else they loving sweet kind one to another pray for the man that he'll be saved or the woman ever who it is pray for him and stick one with another amen that's exactly right and he says not the Klan or make yourself clannish we are one is I couldn't say to my left hand I'm mad at you he said I'm gonna get rid of you he says in my left hand I want him right where he's at he said don't get rid of that pop body part hold on to it you realize friends that many times when we come to the house of God I don't think we fully recognize that we are one body and being one say you look at the church tonight and you're sick in your body well you want somebody to pray for you sure but you know that goes beyond just those type of things everybody in this church right here has a gift of some sort you some people are gift of organizers they know how to organize a fellowship they know how to make the thing run other people try to organize a fellowship and they're pulling their hair out by the end of the day but there's other people that are gifted in the ability of knowing how to entertain people and people in churches will get jealous of things like that Oh what the world a the ones always doing the thing well you have your party see how it works out a lot of times people just aren't gifted for it but rather than grab the football from the one who's got it blocked for the one who's doing the good because we're one if the body is to operate remember the body right here in Akron the body is not Jesse Smith the body is everybody Amen it's not just the pastor in other words but it's the entire body of Jesus Christ I got my clock I'm gonna go long tonight so here we go for six verse 32 Amen there's an old expression I'm gonna try to give you your money's worth as the fresh and goes with Amen I I know I know you're tired you wore out you've been traveling you working hard and and I understand that thank God for it Luke chapter 6 verse 32 now what's the words of the Lord Jesus for if you love them which love you what thank have you in other words what glory do you get out of that to me it's an easy thing to like people who like you to love people who love you that's easy the hard parts when they don't when they don't have nothing to do for you even Jesus said here for sinners love those that love them do give to them to do good to you if you do it what think have you for sinners do the same if you lend to them who have a hole in habit of whom you have excuse me I can't even talk lord have mercy if you lend to them of whom he had hope to receive I get it out one of these nights God mercy all right let me try it again praise the Lord all right are you ready if if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive hallelujah what thank have ye in other words if you give to somebody hoping to get Ussery off of it you didn't do it right because when you give you're supposed to give out of the abundance of your giving into your bro there's bosom not looking for return why does everybody think we're talking about money maybe you're a gardener maybe you've got a good garden this year share your mater's share your taters oh that's tomatoes and potatoes for you northern folk maybe God has given some of you sisters the ability to sell so something for somebody we're one your gifts are to edify the body brother was talking about being involved in real estate let him buy your house amen well one do something one for another in other words whatever gifts you've got put it into circulation amen mmmm talked about going he said I read it the other day and investments were talking about don't hold on to your money he said make it work he said put it into circulation Jesus used the same idea whenever he talked about the thought about the idea come Jesus I should savor the RAM use the idea but the Lord Jesus said about taking your talents and sending it to the exchangers that doesn't mean it's necessarily being able to make it investment on a dollar or $10 or $100 or ever what it is but maybe your investment would be maybe you've got a family in the church that don't even have a good bed maybe you can go to Walmart Miami nice air mattress you with me just a little bit amen this is what Jesus is talking about that we are one with another I'll give to them looking in exchange that's what sinners do sinners do the exact same thing don't do that but love you your enemies and do good lend hoping for nothing again could you imagine that hoping for nothing again I give to this brother oh I sure hope he don't give nothing back to me now that sounds ridiculous don't it but that's exactly what Jesus said amen and hope that he doesn't give it back and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the children of the highest where he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil that was me I'll help you out - that was you as well we were the Sun thankful in this evil sure we was God gave you life how long did it take you - for it really thank him for it he lived every X amount of years on this earth until you really really when you got saved till you really recognized you needed to be saved ah are they tears did you wake up every single morning from the time you's a little bitty baby if your baby hands in the earth thank you Lord for life you couldn't you didn't we were the unthankful God gave to us and gave to us and gave to us and we were this group right here but he was kind to me he gave to me not even looking to see if I'd ever return it back hey man don't you think about something how many people in this world will wake up and go to bed today and God will bestow on them one best after another and never come and ask them to get anything out of it he offers them eternal life they can take it or leave it he doesn't say I'll give you the breath of life how many pet babies will be born just today just today how many thousands of babies will God grant eternal life and you'll never see him come down in that operating room or in the hospital room or at home wherever they do it the Midwife or ever had goat and never stand there and say I give you that baby now thank me for it praise the Lord he gives and never asked for nothing returned this is the reason why when I come to church I like to give and give and give and give and give and give and give as much as I can give to Jesus because he's never asked me he's never demanded could you imagine me sitting - Samantha Kay back there you back tell her you love me today if she had to tell me there's something wrong if I had to ask her there's something wrong that's right that's right same way with the Lord Jesus same exact way then he says verse 37 judge not you shall not be judged condemned not you shouldn't be condemned forgive you shall be forgiven give it shall be given to you good measure pressed down shaken together running over shall men give into your bosom so I was quoting a moment ago for with the same measure that you meet with all shall be measured to you again a man that works in the positive but you know that works in the negative too whenever we pull out on a measuring stick of whether we think a person's a Christian be careful because the measuring stick you use against he that same measuring stick will be used against thee a man you cannot condemn and say hotsauce aren't living right keep the focus on here on yourself don't look its own so look at yourself right look at Romans chapter 12 verse four four and five Romans chapter twelve verse four and five ain't got much longer to go we almost to be in that Alright Romans twelve four and five for as we have many members in but one body all our members have not the same office so we're the same but we're different we're one but God vested in us different qualities not everybody can do what I'm doing not everybody can do what you do not everybody can play piano like brother lures not everybody can run technical things like light brother back there not everybody can deal in real estate I just tried to use real-world things brother I ain't begging but I guess I am picking I've been faking or anybody all man yes not everybody can sing not everybody can do certain things but God give you something you can do God give everybody the ability to do something I said I got nothing to do wait a minute wait a minute if you're a part of a body every part of my body has a function even the skin on the bottom of my feet serves a purpose I got to laughing today to myself one of John's little girls I forget which one it was I looked over on his old hard concrete I turned she's walking barefooted and I want to holler say hey what part of Tennessee are you from that's why we could never have a doctor about open-toed shoes in Tennessee because all of our sisters take their shoes off all the time barefooted all the time some of them old country girls I've seen and walk on rocks and I'm our proxy and Here I am old Tenderfoot who they have calluses on the bottom of their feet tough man but the bottom of their feet serve a purpose even the skin on the bottom of their foot served a purpose everything has a ministry everything has a mission you can look at parts of your body somebody said so many years ago in science and the medical world said you don't need your gallbladder lose it one time see if you don't need it I had mine take it out back in 2000 and I could eat certain foods and my stomach stays tore up a whole time why because that little that little function of that gallbladder was it reserved some of the goal in my stomach and if I was to eat fatty foods medically speaking then that gallbladder it adds a little bit of gall in with those fatty foods to help for digestion they know I can live without it but god I sure wish they wouldn't have took it out believe me when I started hurting with him gall stones and I was glad they did but after I was gone I missed it I still miss it that's been nearly 20 years and I still miss my gallbladder it's got a function every purpose every part of the body has a function it serves some purpose so the devil likes to come on say you're not nothing to nobody don't you ever believe that lie of the devil Satan is a liar the word tells us different everybody has a purpose I said one reason God allowed babies to be born just so everybody to have somebody to teehee at church with her in church everybody's got a purpose but Van talked about a mother he called her the fifth gospel he said there's Matthew Mark Luke John and then mother said she's the fifth one said she gets him before the rest of them get him why because where did they learn the Bible they learned it home from that mother from that godly woman that's sitting there taking the Bible like my little Annalise back there when she was just a baby maybe oh I don't know maybe even two or three years old and she's just not like Jessica there she's just getting started and III used to laugh at her she'd get her Bible out and mama always read her Bible certain ways and certainly I'd see LaVon he's sitting over in a corner with a book open she'd have see spot run in her hands but she was reading that was her Bible she was reading her Bible for the day where do they learn these things there's a function there's a purpose in the body and that body works together in unison in harmony once you're in a first Corinthians chapter 10 now verse 17 first Corinthians 10 verse 17 for we being many are one bread one bread now you take this type you can run this back to the old testament to the bread of his presence show bread it was the showbread seed that the light of god shown on that show bread seed the priest would eat that bread amen and Paul says we are one body we are one bread now last I checked every part of a food piece carrot stem little white part on the inside of a green pepper bitter you cut them things out suam what I was thinking of today says you want that's what makes your mouth numb every part of it a good chef you like to cook you like to cook a little bit burn water you can you you I'm talking to you you like to cook a little bit not really let me tell you I don't I hated it too I turned 40 and for whatever reason I fell in love with cooking as you can see I like to eat you like to cook says you you like to cook I got to read these books about chefs to me whenever I would chop up something I put it in a bag or put it in a pot or what I do I think y'all them scraps laying on the table now here I'm gonna give you a cooking lesson okay you ready all them scraps on the table most of people they just throw them away but a good chef tell you don't do that hold on to your scraps you know what I found out all of them green peppers scraps and all of them broccoli stems and all that stuff it makes a pretty good stock if you may save it and make it a little bit later put it in a pot put some water in it just cook it for a little while you don't even have to touch it you just let it cook I thought hallelujah this is my kind of cooking but every part serves a purpose in the kitchen defeating Saints he called us one bread all of us have a purpose you may think you're scrap but even your scrap serve a purpose in the body of Christ your flavoring somebody's life just you just have it just takes somebody gifted to know how to where to put him and how to handle it in order to get the flavor out of their life I didn't mean embarrass you I was just asking him I just wondered amen all of us have a purpose in God one body we're all partners of that one bread hallelujah I'd like to do an example but I didn't bring my loaf I'm gonna do this one these days Sam don't let me forget to bring a loaf of bread I want a nice big thick of Italian bread one of these days so I'm gonna preach this again somewhere else I want to use this bread for an example but you just picture it in your brain okay one loaf you can pull the piece of that bread off and set it aside another piece set it to the side you can just keep holding that bread apart until you have thousands of little pieces of bread on that table but the end of the day it's one loaf of bread think of it like slicing bread you know many many slices in that loaf of bread but it's one loaf of bread it may be a black it may be a light it may be Vietnamese it may be Japanese it could be Indian but it's one lump one loaf we're all together you may speak French I may speak German you may speak English you may speak Dutch but if we're all one in Christ Jesus Alleluia it's one loaf of bread just like Paul said right here we're all partakers of that one bread didn't Jesus say they came from God out of heaven down and fed the children of Israel he said eat my body drink my blood and he said you'll have life with me every part even the scraps serve a purpose somehow another oh god I wish I hadn't run that mile now first Corinthians chapter 12 verse further we're going to quit all right the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ amen for by one spirit glory we are all baptized into one body amen whether we be Jew or Gentile whether it be bond or free we've all been made to drink into one spirit oh brother that's shouting ground right there cuz I'm gonna tell you something you don't matter how different you and I are if we've been drinking of this same waters life if we've been made to partake at the same holy spirits you're my brother and I'm your sister and vice versa and back and forth all the way around the body of Christ we're one for one look at verse 20 same same chapter for screen 12 verse 20 but now are they many members yet but one body Colossians chapter 3 verse 15 he said let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the to the which also ye are called in to one body and be ye thankful amen I'm thankful that's what body I'm thankful in the church age but then talks about how that man tried to take control he tried to take control of the entire church absolutely wanted control of God control of the money control of the people control of the singing control of everything listen where the prophet of God says church Facebook he said the false man was getting a hold and teaching rulership by man was right it taught that the church had to be governed it top control over the people instead of doing it's God's way they simply took authority invested all the spiritual power into their own hands and came out with a holy priesthood standing between God and the people they went back to the old Arabic system they became the Anti Christ they became the Antichrist the pot disposed that disposed of his own meteor ship and imposed their own God hated that amen the Ephesians hated that and any true believer will hated - amen he said we will have to be we'd have to be stone blind not to see the same at the word the same at war thing it worked through all these ages and now it is the worst of all he said that separated people God's people are supposed to be one by one spirit they are all ALL baptized all baptized into one body and everyone is to be moved on by the Holy Spirit and everyone everyone participate in the worship of God the Lord reveals something to me in Monticello Kentucky other day no no I was I was down there preaching and I was talking about denominational systems and the Holy Ghost give this to me just as sure as I'm standing here and I was talking to the people and I said now I realize why I say come on somebody it's because God didn't want me to be the only one worshipping this is a body move it blessed me so good cuz I hollered come on somebody for 27 years still trying to get come on to somebody somebody to come on somebody said well that's how you do is holler cut on somebody but God did not expect you to come to this church to be spectators expects you to be participators he wants us to worship together amen because why we're one body one body but if Adam said God doesn't dwell on his sears and roebuck harmony house God's God of variety he makes red flowers blue flowers pink flowers all different kinds why didn't you just make him all light or in why didn't make big mountains and little mountains and palm trees why did you at all because he likes variety he said you know what I mean he likes variety why to make the mountains the plain the real dry desert in the wet sea he's a god of variety but he wants it all this at this statement to harmonize together that's why he made me as an ear nose a mouth he said this is you the same way it all harmonizes for one body he said that's the way we do harmonize in our different opinions we can still harmonize because we are God's people marching together for one great purpose Alleluia and he said my sincere desire is to see God's great bouquet of God's gathering together he said in gathering together this bouquet called it until he comes to take us home well BAM said Marvin sheer desire is that I just love this he wants us to harmonize the same way my nose does the same way my ears too the same way my eyes harmonize you realize one reason that I can see you and hear you the harmony between my eyes and my ears there was no harmony let's say my eyes and ears had a church split and the one wasn't talking to the other they might be able to hear but they can't see might be able to see but they can't hear it has to be a harmony all of the body brother Jesse has to harmonize together I know some churches I heard recently one church said something the fact I've said so well we we've done everything we need to do in this last day we don't even need young people no more I said God have mercy what if what if the comment of the Lord went on another forty years it wouldn't just be the elders and the hoary head of wisdom sitting there they'd be in a box somewhere another buried six foot under the ground you'd need another generation you need girls like our sister here and our brother back there and these young kids here Wendy different ones or young brother there you need young men that know how to harmonize with things could you imagine what it would have been if Elijah would I had that attitude when the chariot come down for him I said well don't need a Malaysia little bald head get rid of him but it was the harmony between Elijah and Elijah that kept the succession of that anointing of the logic going on until we come down right here to this very last day when God sitting to John the Baptist he said that same Elijah anointing a William Branham he'll send that same Elijah anointing over to the Jews after the bride is taken out of here it's harmony of the entire body of Christ we are horn I don't care what anybody tells you the love of God we'll make you one listen I'm winding down Brenda Bevin said the love of God will make a tuxedo wrap his arm around and overhaul and call him a brother [Laughter] glory to God he said he was standing there that little finished boy was raised from the dead he said them grown men stand there crying like babies he said anything that make a fin put his arm around a Russian he said that bang was settled every war he said it would bring peace to every place because Jesus Christ is the answer he said they stood there and wept and cried together they hollered shyamalan wah that's God's peace rest upon you them Russians and Finns put their arms around another he said that's right he said it'll make a silk dress and a calico set together and say God bless you you're my sister the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin straightens all wrongs takes all prejudice out let me hit something real quick before we go home prejudice in color people can have prejudices that have nothing to do with skin color or race or culture or anything they like sometimes people can get prejudice because somebody does something more in the church and the other person it's the same time for prejudice some people can get wise he get to do a why does she that's a prejudice spirit but if you're a part of the body of Christ surely you don't look at your heart and say why is he always the one pumping the blood cuz that's his job a man the problem is my friends as Christians many folks just simply don't find their place in the body they're always wanting to take somebody else's place that's why we've got to find our position it takes all the prejudice out heals the sick and makes us new creatures oh if that don't make you holler a man I don't know what will hey man brother Brandon said lookee here came down to the meanest city in the earth he said well that means many Annapolis has got a chance then don't they say come to Nazareth a little virgin who was living right before God the poor not the rich and hearty a haughty rather God don't look at your money or the way your dress he looks at your heart he said that's what's the matter with the church today closing here they got too starchy too much pride he said what are you anyways but six foot of dirt and how can one lump and look at another dirt and say you're better than I they're both lumps of dirt hey man this is why Paul said these words be ye kind one to another because he's looking at everything everything that's going on the body of Christ these people he's preaching to probably had a lot of gifts themself but I love this years ago whenever a king would set a banquet history records to us that often what that King would do we know this from the message to brother men talked about this a little bit how'd it when they would come into the back door we'd say or into the end of the place where the bank was going to be held every person had to take their clothes off and put a robe on that way if the guy walked in he had a three-piece suit on or nothing walked in and he had just rags on when they undressed and put that garment on him they all looked the same they had the same type of clothing the same quality of clothing but in old history another thing that these Kings would often do is they would adjust the height of the seats and they would take the short guy and set him in the tall chair another one put him in the middle sized chair and take the tall guy and sit him in the little chair and they said that way when the King walked out and looked across that great audience every man and woman was equal in the look of him as they went down through the table remember what Jesus said he said woe be unto them if they say manners of evil it'd be better for them if they had a millstone you ever seen a millstone you know the millstone is it's a big grinding stone mmm where they grind and grind and grind heavy super heavy hurt you heavy kill you heavy and Jesus said I had be better to have one of them hung about your neck and drowned in the sea then to offend one of these my little ones why was he saying such things Church listen to me he was saying that because the little ones he was referring to was him and he was those little ones remember the prophet of God said arise in the Sun he talked about Adam and Eve and how they were one body he said sighs Christ and the bride glory he said not only is she power of his power life of his life dynamic of his dynamic but he said she is him she is him because were one be kind one to another put away lying let him at steal steal no more speak every man truth with his own neighbor put away clamor and evil speaking don't blaspheme one another's name why why Paul why would you exhort us this way because as there's one body there's many members of this one body stand with me hour and 25 minutes you all survived amen amen I got I got my watch going I'm keeping track I know you got a I know you got a long way to go amen let's just have a word of Prayer before we close I just thank God for His mercy don't you Amen let's let's just pray look thank you for this lovely day Lord father thank you for making it tolerable in this room it's not super hot outside and I can only believe Lord you let it be that way so we can enjoy the weekend thank you for the many blessings I heard him singing the song just this song service gone by count your blessings Oh God Lord how many hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of blessings could we just save things you've done in our lives I'm so grateful and Lord with all these great blessings that you've placed in our lives with all these great things you've done for us when you take one man that's got blessings and accumulate that with another man and then another sister and then another brother then another sister the brother then on and on Lord Jesus when you look at the accumulative blessings the aggregate of blessings it lets us know that you are unlimited in your blessings just as your unlimited healing we think of it Lord how many thousands of people have been healed and yet Lord many of them aren't even saved but they cut their finger on a kitchen knife the prophet of God said a doctor can stitch it but it takes God to heal it and yet all that virtue and healing power goes out from you and not many really receive it as being a blessing and yet there's as we would say down home buckets of it bucket loads of blessings still in reserves Lord because you can't run out you are the supernatural and you do supernatural things that's what your prophet taught us so Lord we look at all of the great things you've done for us what a blessing it is for one man but lower than to get it through the way of looking at a whole body when we get there that day Lord how many tens of millions of tens of thousands of hundreds of thousands how many blessings are going
