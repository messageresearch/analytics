[44:01] right as she gets older and she gets
[44:04] baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost
[44:06] I'll just continue praise the Lord so
[44:09] let's uh let's look I just I don't
[44:11] really have many slides tonight I'm just
[44:12] gonna preach out of my notes I had a
[44:14] busy week at school we're winding down
[44:15] to the end so I'm doing great cards and
[44:18] everything trying to get everything
[44:19] moves to finish up the year so I don't
[44:23] have time to do all the slides but I did
[44:25] took it take a lot of notes you know in
[44:26] my my notes so I'd like to look at this
[44:29] thought the Y's increased learning and
[44:31] this is par Levin of the series and we
[44:33] read our text from proverbs 1 verse 5 so
[44:37] tonight the main thing I'd like to do is
[44:38] I like to go through the scriptures on
[44:40] increasing learning and wisdom in the
[44:42] book of Proverbs now I was thinking
[44:45] about this you know as I was going
[44:46] through this I had many thoughts that
[44:48] kind of came to my mind and you know as
[44:50] I was getting my college degree to be a
[44:52] teacher they talked about the importance
[44:54] of learning and they talked about how
[44:56] you can hear through many different
[44:58] channels there's different types of
[45:00] learning styles some people are more
[45:02] auditory they just have to hear
[45:04] something and they they catch it like
[45:06] that others are more visual they have to
[45:08] see it when they see it they got it you
[45:10] know they got like a photographic memory
[45:12] others are more hands-on they call that
[45:15] kinesthetic that's the fancy word for
[45:17] getting hands on so some kids in my
[45:20] class they got to have their hands on it
[45:21] to really understand it they got to wrap
[45:23] themselves around it or or when we learn
[45:25] a song or when we learn new words they
[45:27] got a klappa so sometimes we'll clap the
[45:29] syllables like happily or excited or
[45:32] something like that and they got to be
[45:34] moving or clapping or or sometimes we
[45:36] you know we stopped and different things
[45:38] like that there were seven kinds of
[45:40] learning styles I didn't write them down
[45:42] but I'm just recalling those that that
[45:45] we are to have we have those and we know
[45:49] though and I have other articles to how
[45:52] it's very important to learn through
[45:53] reading now reading is not the only way
[45:55] to learn of course because you know
[45:57] Jesus said anyone that hears the book of
[45:59] Revelation and keeps it will be blessed
[46:01] because we know not everybody is able to
[46:04] read and there are some people that are
[46:06] illiterate but we know that it's very
[46:10] important to read in fact I read one
[46:12] article one time online that said those
[46:15] people who were more readers were less
[46:18] likely to get diseases later on in life
[46:21] I forget the men show is one of them and
[46:23] Alzheimer's was another one so stay in
[46:26] the Bible and then read the message stay
[46:30] in the church age book where I'm
[46:31] actually almost done with the church
[46:32] we're on page two seventy or two fifty
[46:34] two I'm sorry two fifty two so we're
[46:36] about a hundred pages so we're done with
[46:38] the book there at home so we got to keep
[46:40] reading say in the book so a reading is
[46:43] a very important thing and so tonight I
[46:46] want to look at just this idea of
[46:48] continuing to learn and continuing to
[46:50] read and and learning all the time
[46:55] because I think we all know with this
[46:57] age it's a lot easier just to turn on
[46:58] YouTube or it's a lot easier just to
[47:00] turn on a video and and try to you know
[47:02] try to get something from that which is
[47:03] okay to hear it but one thing we should
[47:07] always be doing is wanting to learn more
[47:09] about the Lord like we saw a few weeks
[47:12] ago we sang it tonight the half has not
[47:14] been told about all that God has done
[47:16] amen and there's so much more we know
[47:20] for us to learn and understand and grow
[47:23] and I've always been tremendously
[47:25] blessed by all the brother branham
[47:27] preached but I've also been surprised at
[47:29] all that he couldn't get to because he
[47:31] was a evangelist and prophet for example
[47:34] like the whole book of Song of Solomon
[47:35] he never he never really was able to
[47:37] teach a whole series on that and that's
[47:39] why we appreciate the ministry today you
[47:41] know preachers that can have time where
[47:44] the man said they can have time to go
[47:46] through these things slowly you know and
[47:48] and so we're thankful you know we know
[47:52] the Holy Spirit although the Prophet may
[47:54] have not preached every book of the
[47:55] Bible we know the Holy Spirit gave us
[47:57] principles that will last through all
[47:59] the books of the Bible so as long as
[48:01] brother Graham called the Keystone as
[48:03] long as we know the Keystone of the
[48:05] Bible we'll have the right understanding
[48:08] and Rodan said the Keystone was in two
[48:09] scriptures anybody remember one of them
[48:11] is Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same
[48:15] yesterday today and forever the other
[48:18] Keystone brother branham said was in the
[48:20] book of Ecclesiastes and he said he
[48:22] mentioned the scripture where
[48:23] Ecclesiastes says that there's nothing
[48:26] new Under the Sun what God doeth he
[48:28] doeth forever so he said those that's
[48:31] the keystone of the Bible those two
[48:32] scriptures who does thought the
[48:34] Keystone's would have been in
[48:35] Ecclesiastes in Hebrews but the very
[48:37] Keystone the foundational stones of the
[48:40] the Christian faith are that God is
[48:43] unchanging and just as he is
[48:45] changing his ways or unchanging how he
[48:48] deals with humans and how he deals with
[48:50] his bride and deals with his church and
[48:53] deals with the sinner and the reprobate
[48:55] and the Jew right as he deals with all
[48:58] them he always stays the same in his
[49:00] dealings and he is the same yesterday
[49:02] today and forever amen so that's the
[49:05] keystone of the Bible
[49:06] now we must always keep learning and and
[49:10] let's look at through the scripture so
[49:12] let's go back to proverbs chapter 1 and
[49:14] let's look at this and we must always
[49:17] find more things to learn I found as
[49:20] I've grown old you know like I told you
[49:22] my physical strength is now not as much
[49:24] as it used to be and I've got to and
[49:27] even my even my mental zeal you know
[49:29] just get it I get to get more tired
[49:31] maybe it's cuz I wore myself out I don't
[49:32] know that's my wife shaking her head so
[49:34] it looks like that's maybe I just wore
[49:35] myself out but I found my in my physical
[49:38] strength and then my even my mental Z or
[49:42] mental ability it's it's weaker and I've
[49:45] got to work harder to try to get that
[49:47] back is could anybody say men to that
[49:49] I've got to get that physical strength
[49:53] back and I've got to work to get the
[49:54] mental zeal back as well because as you
[49:58] get tired you know you did older you're
[50:00] just you're not as strong as you used to
[50:02] be that's what the Bible says the beauty
[50:04] of the young man is the strength the
[50:07] glory of the older man is his wisdom
[50:11] brother Branham said if you could choose
[50:13] one of the quarters of the hundred years
[50:15] of life to live which one would you live
[50:17] brother man said if you want to be an
[50:19] athlete you better choose the first 25 I
[50:21] forget what he said the next 100 was the
[50:24] fit 25 to 50 and then the 50 to 75 or
[50:27] the 75 to 100 but brother Graham said I
[50:29] would choose the 75 to 100 he said
[50:33] because I know more about it I'd have
[50:35] more wisdom
[50:36] so if you're guaranteed 25 years which
[50:39] age would you want to live and brother
[50:41] Branham said seventy five to a hundred
[50:44] what would be the age that he would want
[50:46] to live because he would be more wise
[50:48] he'd be more careful he would understand
[50:50] this is the right thing to do
[50:52] time is short I must redeem the time I'm
[50:55] going to invest my energy in what's much
[50:57] most important and I think as we go
[51:00] I think we can understand what's most
[51:01] important praise the Lord and what's
[51:06] most important is the Word of God and
[51:07] then also investing the Word of God into
[51:10] your family praise the Lord I think I
[51:13] saw an article last week that said said
[51:15] something along the lines of they asked
[51:17] like a thousand people or something on
[51:19] their deathbed what did they wish they
[51:21] would have done the most and none of
[51:23] them said work more they all said they
[51:26] wish they would have spent time with
[51:27] their family more time with their family
[51:29] so see what is wisdom tell us wisdom
[51:32] tells us the most valuable things are
[51:34] the things that really don't cost any
[51:35] money it's the relationships that God
[51:38] has given to us amen
[51:39] and it's our relationship with God
[51:41] that's most valuable and so we've got to
[51:44] take those things and learn from them so
[51:47] proverbs chapter 1 I'm just going to
[51:52] start a verse 1 again and rehearse 1
[51:53] through 5 actually 1 to 6 the Proverbs
[51:57] of Solomon the son of David king of
[51:59] Israel to know wisdom and instruction to
[52:01] perceive the words of understanding to
[52:06] receive the instruction of wisdom
[52:07] justice and judgment and equity to give
[52:12] subtlety to the simple to the young man
[52:15] knowledge and discretion now here's what
[52:17] here's our text a wise man will hear and
[52:20] will increase learning and a man of
[52:25] understanding shall attain unto wise
[52:27] counsels to understand the proverb and
[52:31] the interpretation the words of the wise
[52:34] and their dark sayings amen so these are
[52:39] all things that you and I are interested
[52:41] in right we're interested in the wisdom
[52:43] and instruction understanding the Word
[52:45] of God receiving instruction in wisdom
[52:50] and justice treating each other right
[52:52] through the right judgment and being
[52:55] equitable being fair with one another
[52:57] right these are all things we're
[52:58] interested in understanding the Proverbs
[53:01] themselves and the interpretations and
[53:05] so we've got to make sure we continually
[53:08] increase our learning and the Bible
[53:10] repeats us over and over again so let's
[53:14] look through the scripture now let's go
[53:15] to verse 22 in chapter one so there's a
[53:20] great a great contrast between the wise
[53:24] and then the foolish in verse 22 it says
[53:28] how long these simple ones will you love
[53:30] simplicity and thus corners delight in
[53:33] their scorning and fools hate knowledge
[53:36] so you have three kinds of unbelievers
[53:40] there will say like that you have simple
[53:42] ones and they're just happy-go-lucky and
[53:44] they they just don't care about anything
[53:46] oh who cares what if you die tomorrow
[53:48] who cares we're just gonna live it up
[53:49] they're just simple they're they're
[53:51] easily deceived right and then you have
[53:54] the scorners house corners will actually
[53:58] speak evil against what they don't agree
[54:01] with but a simple person they don't care
[54:03] they'll just move on but ask order
[54:05] they're gonna mock it and make fun of it
[54:07] remember Peter said they'll scorn and
[54:09] say where is the coming of the Lord
[54:11] right scorner scoffers oh they'll mock
[54:14] you and make they'll make fun of us so
[54:17] that's a different kind of a sinner but
[54:20] then there's these fools and fools
[54:23] actually hate knowledge so fools would
[54:27] be the opposite of us we're supposed to
[54:29] love learning more whereas a fool hates
[54:32] learning more they like living in their
[54:35] habits and how do we know and the older
[54:36] you get the more prone you are to stick
[54:38] eating in your habits if you don't use
[54:41] it you lose it right and so fools they
[54:44] don't they don't want to grow and they
[54:46] don't want to understand and they don't
[54:47] want to gain a better understanding
[54:50] about life they just want to go in their
[54:53] same pattern over and over again and
[54:55] that's chapter one where it looks at
[54:58] that now let's go back to let's go to
[54:59] chapter nine here let's jump ahead to
[55:01] chapter nine verse seven the Proverbs
[55:05] writer Solomon is going to keep bringing
[55:06] in proverbs about increasing and
[55:09] learning increasing in knowledge chapter
[55:15] nine verse seven and it will read
[55:18] 2:12 there he that reproves a scorner
[55:22] getteth to himself shame and he that
[55:26] rebuked a--the a wicked man getteth
[55:28] himself a blot reprove not a scorn or
[55:32] less he hate thee rebuke a wise man and
[55:37] he will love thee amen
[55:42] give instruction to a wise man and he
[55:45] will be yet wiser teach a just man and
[55:49] he will increase in learning so see how
[55:53] we're getting an opposite we're getting
[55:55] opposites again a wise man will love you
[55:58] more when you correct him but a fool
[56:01] will just attack you and this kind of
[56:03] goes with what Jesus was saying he said
[56:04] you got to be careful be wise as
[56:06] serpents harmless as doves be careful
[56:08] not to pet cast your pearls before swine
[56:10] so you have to pick and choose your
[56:13] battles when you're going to speak up
[56:14] and rebuke and say something sometimes
[56:17] it's wiser just to let the blind lead
[56:19] the blind jesus even said that so we've
[56:22] really got to make sure we're careful on
[56:23] how to rebuke sinners and unbelievers
[56:25] because we might be casting our pearls
[56:28] before swine but in the house of God and
[56:32] amongst God's family if we're really
[56:34] wise believers we should be able to
[56:37] lovingly and gently recorrect one
[56:41] another or be connection to one another
[56:43] and we should love each other more
[56:45] because of that amen
[56:48] but oftentimes what you see may be a
[56:50] preacher will get in the wrong spirit
[56:52] and he'll bring correction in the wrong
[56:53] way and it'll hurt people or you have a
[56:56] friend that you love or it's just
[56:58] someone in the church maybe you're not
[56:59] really familiar with and maybe they'll
[57:01] get the wrong spirit and correct you in
[57:03] the wrong way maybe it's not maybe it's
[57:06] out in front of everybody instead of
[57:07] one-on-one right and then that can cause
[57:10] hurt and pain but see it takes a wise
[57:13] person to correct another wise person
[57:15] right and it must be done the right way
[57:18] and so this is what the scripture is
[57:20] telling us here now look at we ended off
[57:25] with verse verse 8 so rebuke a wise man
[57:27] who loved you verse not give instruction
[57:30] to a wise man and he will be
[57:32] wiser teach a just man and he will
[57:36] increase and learning praise God I know
[57:40] one thing that you know preaching the
[57:41] Word of God has taught me and listening
[57:43] to brother Branham and listening to
[57:44] other preachers one thing that's really
[57:46] taught me is how to live my life more
[57:49] closer to the Lord and how to cut out
[57:51] things that I don't really have to do
[57:53] right and things I shouldn't do and by
[57:57] watching other brothers minister and
[58:00] talking to other pastors it's really
[58:02] taught me the right way to balance my
[58:03] life in other words you have to have a
[58:05] balance between studying you have to
[58:07] have a balance between working and a
[58:10] balance on spending time with your
[58:11] family I think at the beginning I was
[58:13] more guilty of just studying too much
[58:15] and not spending time with my family and
[58:18] I had to learn that balance and I think
[58:21] brothers could say Amen you know we got
[58:23] to be careful not to pour too much of
[58:24] ourselves into our work right it must be
[58:28] balanced and I've learned that and I
[58:31] told you the story ready but with my
[58:32] physical health James browning told me I
[58:34] wish I would exercise more so I've had
[58:36] to carve out two days a week where I
[58:38] those are the days I exercise two out of
[58:40] seven that ain't bad you know I maybe I
[58:43] stretched six days out of the week I'll
[58:44] stretch you know but I won't really
[58:45] exercise but two of them you know and
[58:48] maybe that's good maybe I should do more
[58:50] I don't know that's the best I can do
[58:51] right now and still be a pastor and
[58:53] working and everything like that but you
[58:55] know you watch other men and you're you
[58:58] should learn from them you should learn
[59:00] how to live your life more wisely for
[59:02] the kingdom of God and then when you
[59:06] receive correction you'll love that
[59:08] person more amen I think you know one
[59:12] person one time I talked to a pastor
[59:15] down south and I just kind of said
[59:17] something wrong and he read kind of it
[59:18] rebuked me like no no that's not right
[59:20] you know and I've always respected that
[59:22] brother a lot because of that and I was
[59:25] like yeah right I just kind of jumped to
[59:27] conclusions I kind of had the wrong
[59:29] perspective and then since I've gone
[59:31] down and you know I visited the brother
[59:33] a couple of times each time I go now
[59:35] since that moment he rebuked me I just
[59:37] kind of sit there and watch and I can
[59:39] learn so much from him and I've really
[59:42] I've been benefited by that and watch
[59:45] how he kind of orders his
[59:46] life how he runs the church how he had
[59:49] preached 'as of the church I've been
[59:51] able to grow from that so that's one
[59:53] example where I was able to be rebuked
[59:55] and kind of corrected and then learn
[59:58] from that
[59:58] how many appreciate the correction of
[1:00:00] the Lord yes and so we should increase
[1:00:05] and learning and you know another
[1:00:06] example is as I'm preaching all through
[1:00:08] the church ages and a different series
[1:00:10] that I preached through I've been
[1:00:13] corrected by the Word of God where I
[1:00:15] thought a certain thought was like this
[1:00:17] and then the Holy Spirit will come and
[1:00:19] show me another scripture and it'll help
[1:00:21] balance out my life or help correct me
[1:00:24] on a certain doctrine that I used to
[1:00:26] maybe be a one-way on ones to follow
[1:00:30] inside and maybe the the scripture will
[1:00:33] bring it right down where I need to be
[1:00:35] right in the middle of the road
[1:00:36] praise the Lord so this is what the
[1:00:41] Bible tells us here if you give
[1:00:44] instruction to a wise man he'll be yet
[1:00:46] wiser teach a just man and he'll
[1:00:48] increase in learning and that's one
[1:00:52] thing we've got to make sure we do in a
[1:00:54] case like this even on a Wednesday night
[1:00:56] on a Sunday night or Sunday morning you
[1:00:59] know a lot of people just come to learn
[1:01:01] on Sunday morning you know we've got to
[1:01:03] come to learn on every single night I
[1:01:04] think that's why you're here tonight is
[1:01:06] because you want God to teach you
[1:01:08] something new praise the Lord or if not
[1:01:10] something new to help you get something
[1:01:12] right that you haven't been getting
[1:01:13] right lately amen and think about you
[1:01:16] know think about all the years Abraham
[1:01:18] 25 years God had to keep encouraging him
[1:01:21] just believe the promise just believe
[1:01:23] the promise the victories coming
[1:01:25] victories coming think about brother
[1:01:27] Brad a member every seven years he would
[1:01:29] have that stomach problem and he didn't
[1:01:32] get healed into the last six months of
[1:01:34] his life I'm sorry the last two months
[1:01:36] of his life because in November of 65 he
[1:01:38] preaches on the wings of a snow-white
[1:01:40] dove and he said I just got victory over
[1:01:42] it and so year after year I'll say like
[1:01:46] this cycle after cycle he's just got to
[1:01:49] keep hanging on believing the promise of
[1:01:51] God it's going to come I'm going to get
[1:01:53] the victory I just got to keep hanging
[1:01:55] on and finally in the right season
[1:01:57] victory comes amen but had to learn
[1:02:00] hang on learn to trust the Lord learn to
[1:02:04] understand that not every answer is
[1:02:06] going to be a miracle right like I heard
[1:02:10] recently you know like when a baby is
[1:02:12] born like little baby eat in there you
[1:02:14] know you know she gets all the hugs in
[1:02:17] the love and all the attention and all
[1:02:19] and everyone's real gentle but when the
[1:02:21] baby grows up then it's not as gentle
[1:02:23] anymore you know and that's how God is
[1:02:26] that first God cobbles us and babies us
[1:02:28] you like the deep call to the deep you
[1:02:30] know or as the ego stir this nest the
[1:02:33] Eagles get to a point where the Mamas
[1:02:35] you know toddles them feeds them but
[1:02:37] then has to make the nests kind of
[1:02:39] uncomfortable and that's how we are and
[1:02:42] I've talked to a couple brothers
[1:02:43] remember brother Sonny how he used to
[1:02:44] come and he used to tell me when he was
[1:02:46] a first a Christian God did miracle
[1:02:48] after miracle supernatural tongue after
[1:02:51] tongue healing after healing and then he
[1:02:54] noticed as time went on they got less
[1:02:56] and less and he said I haven't changed
[1:02:57] anything I've done it seems like God is
[1:03:00] just pulling away and and I could say
[1:03:02] the same in my life too you know when I
[1:03:04] was first aid and first of preaching the
[1:03:06] Word of God in a certain way I saw a lot
[1:03:08] more supernatural and a lot more
[1:03:11] spiritual things and it seems like as
[1:03:13] time's going on maybe you see less of
[1:03:15] that
[1:03:15] well if God's teaching us a lesson we
[1:03:18] don't want to give up on God we've got
[1:03:20] to search our lives and see Lord am i
[1:03:22] serving you as humbly as I did at the
[1:03:25] beginning have I left my first love if
[1:03:28] you haven't then God is just giving you
[1:03:31] a little bit of a testing time amen God
[1:03:33] is just testing your faith and and
[1:03:35] making you go through a season of trial
[1:03:39] he's toughen you up a little bit right I
[1:03:43] know I used to get really discouraged if
[1:03:45] I didn't see a miracle every six months
[1:03:47] or yeah I used to get really discouraged
[1:03:49] like something was wrong and I still
[1:03:51] have to battle that because I wanted
[1:03:53] because every time I read about God he's
[1:03:55] supernatural and he's Almighty God and
[1:03:58] he's eat we must call him on the scene
[1:04:01] and how many times do we call him on the
[1:04:02] scene here we'll call him on the scene
[1:04:05] for this prayer request that forever
[1:04:07] because that prayer requests but see God
[1:04:10] is trying to teach us something in the
[1:04:12] times of waiting he's teaching
[1:04:14] us to keep trusting he's gonna build our
[1:04:16] faith he's going to build our confidence
[1:04:17] he's going to teach us the weight
[1:04:19] because the Bible says in patience we
[1:04:22] possess our souls amen
[1:04:24] in patience and so Abraham twenty-five
[1:04:28] years and I keep going back to that my
[1:04:30] own life you know when I go through
[1:04:32] trials and these types of things in
[1:04:35] these quiet moments or these testing
[1:04:38] moments God is increasing my learning
[1:04:40] and it's the hard way I'll be very
[1:04:43] honest it's not the easy way this is the
[1:04:45] hard way amen
[1:04:48] it is the hard way and God always takes
[1:04:51] his children the hard way right he
[1:04:54] always takes is that he took memory took
[1:04:56] Egypt I'm sorry it was your honor
[1:04:57] each of his seven going the easy way
[1:04:59] they went the hard way to the Red Sea
[1:05:01] right where it seemed like where what's
[1:05:03] going to happen but it was teaching them
[1:05:05] to cry out to God right stand still see
[1:05:08] the salvation speak the word and go
[1:05:10] forward right God wants it's like like
[1:05:13] Joshua the waters never moved until the
[1:05:17] priest actually stepped in the water and
[1:05:19] we've sometimes got a step into the
[1:05:21] water we've got to take the word obey
[1:05:24] the Lord and then when we finally move
[1:05:26] based upon the word that's a step of
[1:05:29] faith and then that's when the waters
[1:05:31] will move amen
[1:05:32] but many times God takes us the hard way
[1:05:35] and learning many times happens through
[1:05:38] the hard way through the the long way
[1:05:42] the long road look at that that's in
[1:05:46] Proverbs 9 interesting now let's go to
[1:05:50] verse 7 proverbs 9 7 I'm sorry I read
[1:05:54] that yeah I'm going on down to verse 12
[1:05:57] so let's go to 10 the fear of the Lord
[1:05:59] is the beginning of wisdom and the
[1:06:00] knowledge of the holy is understanding
[1:06:03] for by me thy day shall be multiplied in
[1:06:05] the years of thy life shall be increased
[1:06:07] if thou be wise thou shalt be wise for
[1:06:10] thyself but if thou scorn us now alone
[1:06:13] shall bear it amen
[1:06:16] oh my so see another in other words you
[1:06:19] reap what you sow if you're gonna be a
[1:06:20] scorner you're gonna bear the sufferings
[1:06:22] of scorning but if you'll be wise you'll
[1:06:24] enjoy the blessings and fruits of the
[1:06:27] lies
[1:06:27] amen now go to chapter 10 here we're
[1:06:33] getting more and more wise chapter 10
[1:06:38] verse 8
[1:06:39] proverbs 10 verse 8 the wise in heart
[1:06:44] will receive Commandments but a prating
[1:06:47] fool shall fall he that walketh
[1:06:52] uprightly walketh surely but he that
[1:06:54] pervert of his ways shall be known he
[1:06:57] that wink is with the eye causes sorrow
[1:06:59] but a parading fool shall fall the
[1:07:02] righteous man the mouth of righteous man
[1:07:04] is a well of life but violence covereth
[1:07:06] the mouth of the wicked now I want to go
[1:07:10] on to verse 14 wise men lay up knowledge
[1:07:14] but the mouth of the foolish is near
[1:07:18] destruction that's what I want to go
[1:07:20] right there the Bible's that they lay up
[1:07:22] they take ahold of knowledge when they
[1:07:24] find some knowledge of God some
[1:07:26] understanding of God they hold on to
[1:07:28] that promise amen
[1:07:30] they don't let that go they take ahold
[1:07:32] of that and they put it up on the shelf
[1:07:34] and said this is mine amen
[1:07:36] they lay a hold of it they grab onto
[1:07:39] that promise of God and that's why we're
[1:07:41] here tonight to grab onto the promises
[1:07:43] of God amen
[1:07:49] Burlison over we're seeing how the Y's
[1:07:52] increase their learning they lay a hold
[1:07:55] upon the promises of God now this is
[1:08:01] tells us how to receive wisdom what kind
[1:08:06] of condition we must be in if we're
[1:08:07] going to expect to receive the wisdom of
[1:08:09] God or the knowledge of God increase our
[1:08:11] learning 11 verse 1 a fault balances
[1:08:16] abomination the Lord but a just way is
[1:08:18] his delight when pride cometh then come
[1:08:20] a shame but with the lowly is wisdoms
[1:08:24] there it is right there
[1:08:25] with the lowly is wisdom doesn't that
[1:08:27] remind you of Jesus and Matthew 11:29 he
[1:08:30] said come learn to me I'm meek and lowly
[1:08:33] in heart amen he said so if he's lowly
[1:08:38] if Jesus is humble if Jesus does it he's
[1:08:41] not exalting himself that how much more
[1:08:43] should we humble ourselves see how
[1:08:46] humble we got to come to church we just
[1:08:48] got to say lord help me to be humble
[1:08:49] enough to hear your voice help me not to
[1:08:52] be so privacy we can't come here
[1:08:54] thinking we know it all our thinking
[1:08:55] we're living perfect before God because
[1:08:57] none of us are church and we need the
[1:08:59] grace of God every hour because the
[1:09:02] Bible clearly teaches us that that the
[1:09:05] lowly is wisdom with the lowly is wisdom
[1:09:09] so where you find people that are kind
[1:09:11] of down and out maybe as we said on
[1:09:14] Sunday you know a little bitty Timbuktu
[1:09:15] Church you know wherever there's
[1:09:18] humility wherever there's people that
[1:09:20] they all say have the trust it is God
[1:09:23] that's where you'll find wisdom amen
[1:09:26] that's beautiful look at verse 3 the
[1:09:30] Bible said there in the integrity the
[1:09:34] upright shall guide them but the
[1:09:36] perverseness of transgressors shall
[1:09:39] destroy them amen so again integrity the
[1:09:43] word integrity means this it means
[1:09:45] genuine genuine as' and reliability how
[1:09:49] many want to be genuine and reliable I
[1:09:53] want to I want to be just I just want to
[1:09:55] be Jesse Smith no matter where I am if
[1:09:57] I'm at work or if I'm at home or at
[1:09:59] church I just want
[1:10:00] be as genuine I always want to just be a
[1:10:02] real Christian and I want to be reliable
[1:10:05] I think church attendance is really good
[1:10:08] way to judge that right reliable to the
[1:10:12] house of God reliable to the people of
[1:10:14] God we're going to be genuine and
[1:10:16] reliable integrity is your guide so you
[1:10:19] know this when God is silent like we
[1:10:21] preached out a few weeks ago and God is
[1:10:23] testing you like he was testing job we
[1:10:27] must rely upon our integrity to know
[1:10:30] we're in the will of God
[1:10:31] see when we don't hear God's voice that
[1:10:34] we don't feel anything or we're not
[1:10:35] shivering or you know we know we're not
[1:10:37] crying or for me if I'm not crying or
[1:10:39] shouting one thing I can rely upon as my
[1:10:41] guide is my integrity in other words was
[1:10:44] I genuine am i genuine in this decision
[1:10:47] is there anything that's kind of master
[1:10:50] am i putting anything on and also
[1:10:52] reliability am i reliable with this
[1:10:55] decision am I am i reliable to God right
[1:10:59] am i keeping God's commandments that's
[1:11:02] one way that will guide us when we don't
[1:11:04] have a supernatural answer how many
[1:11:07] times have you prayed and I prayed how
[1:11:09] many times did we pray to feel like we
[1:11:10] haven't got the answer right I don't I
[1:11:13] don't feel this I'm not sure which way
[1:11:14] to go in those moments what guides us is
[1:11:18] our integrity we must be genuine we must
[1:11:22] know that we've been reliable to the
[1:11:24] Lord we've kept the Lord's commandments
[1:11:26] right
[1:11:27] remember our the the king down in the I
[1:11:29] forget the king that Abraham you know he
[1:11:32] was he lied to and the Bible said that
[1:11:34] God remembered the Kings integrity hum
[1:11:36] remember that the king said Lord you
[1:11:39] know the integrity of my heart I didn't
[1:11:41] want to sin against you I didn't know
[1:11:42] Sarah was married to Abraham and God
[1:11:44] said because of that I kept you from
[1:11:45] sinning against me amen
[1:11:48] okay see his integrity was his guide
[1:11:51] right he did nothing well I don't that
[1:11:55] wasn't genuine everything he did he put
[1:11:58] his heart into it he did it for the Lord
[1:12:00] amen
[1:12:02] so church
[1:12:03] that's our God if we're known I don't
[1:12:05] have it don't have a dream if we don't
[1:12:06] see a vision if we don't have with us
[1:12:08] say at the Lord if we don't have any
[1:12:09] other evidence our guide is our
[1:12:12] integrity amen
[1:12:14] what is the way your integrity is
[1:12:16] leading you the genuine genuineness of
[1:12:19] your heart amen
[1:12:22] now let's go to chapter 12 verse 1
[1:12:25] chapter 12 verse 1 whoso loveth
[1:12:34] instruction loveth knowledge but he that
[1:12:38] hater 3 proof is brutish amen
[1:12:43] how many like to do this I love to do
[1:12:46] this I have like 5 to-do list apps on my
[1:12:48] phone I just I love seeing it just do
[1:12:51] this do this do this do this than that
[1:12:53] and that's what the Bible says we need
[1:12:56] instruction if you love instructions
[1:12:59] first this then this then you love
[1:13:01] knowledge as well amen
[1:13:03] and God lays out his word doesn't he lay
[1:13:06] it out how do you know God repent be
[1:13:08] baptized get sanctified get filled with
[1:13:11] the Holy Ghost under the statute of man
[1:13:14] right faith virtue knowledge patience
[1:13:16] temperance godless brotherly kindness
[1:13:18] charity God lays it out God lays out all
[1:13:21] the instructions on how to do His
[1:13:22] perfect will we've just got the love
[1:13:24] knowledge amen
[1:13:26] we've got to love that God lays
[1:13:27] everything out 7 church ages seven seals
[1:13:31] he just lays it all the three works of
[1:13:33] grace everything's laid out for us as
[1:13:36] instructions we've just got to keep the
[1:13:38] instructions amen
[1:13:40] I think that's beautiful God there's no
[1:13:44] questions with it God gives us ones in
[1:13:47] number in numerology x' ones five sevens
[1:13:49] 12s as we saw you know with the twelve
[1:13:51] sons on Sunday night sons of Jacob all
[1:13:54] these things God gives us all these
[1:13:55] instructions and he expects us to follow
[1:13:58] them amen
[1:14:01] let's go now to chapter I'm sorry no I'm
[1:14:07] sorry I'm
[1:14:08] let's let's hold our spot there let's
[1:14:09] get our hebrews chapter 12 I wrote this
[1:14:11] scripture down I want to hit this so
[1:14:14] we're in proverbs 12 1 now let's go to
[1:14:16] Hebrews 12 yeah you love if you
[1:14:24] knowledge you love instruction okay if
[1:14:26] you love instruction you love now it's
[1:14:27] okay now keep your spot there and go to
[1:14:29] Hebrews 12 I want to look at this again
[1:14:39] I want to review this most of you're
[1:14:40] familiar with this but let's review it
[1:14:42] tonight by the grace of the Lord now we
[1:14:47] know at the beginning of chapter 12 it
[1:14:50] talks about laying aside every weight
[1:14:52] that we can run the race with patience
[1:14:54] right and then looking to Jesus the
[1:14:55] author and finisher of our faith and now
[1:15:00] look at verse 5 and you have forgotten
[1:15:01] the exhortation which speaketh unto us
[1:15:03] children my son despised thou not the
[1:15:07] chastening of the Lord nor faint when
[1:15:08] thou art rebuked of him so this is one
[1:15:11] way God gives us as he gives us a
[1:15:14] metaphor or an allegory of how we grow
[1:15:18] and learning one way to look at it is
[1:15:20] looking at a child
[1:15:22] how dear how our children grow in
[1:15:24] learning okay so God tells us just watch
[1:15:28] a child grow and learning he said that's
[1:15:30] how I'm teaching you you are like a
[1:15:33] child okay there's other examples we'll
[1:15:37] get to in a moment as well see he says
[1:15:39] God speaketh to you as children my son
[1:15:42] despise not thou the chasing Lord nor
[1:15:44] faint when thou art rebuked of him for
[1:15:48] whom the Lord loveth he chasin ahthe and
[1:15:51] scourgeth every son whom he receiveth
[1:15:55] that's a hard Scripture remember who
[1:15:58] else was couraged Jesus was scourge
[1:16:00] Jesus was scourge physically but the
[1:16:03] Bible says we're going to be scourge
[1:16:05] spiritually never ever understand that
[1:16:08] so we're going to just go through
[1:16:09] spiritual scourgings or chastening Zoar
[1:16:13] we call them spiritual program called
[1:16:15] protoplasmic stimulations
[1:16:19] spankings spiritual spankings and this
[1:16:22] is what the Scripture teaches look up
[1:16:24] scourging if you don't believe me they
[1:16:25] look up scourging he scourgeth every son
[1:16:28] that he receives but if you be with
[1:16:33] chastisement where of all our bat are
[1:16:37] partakers then are you bastards and not
[1:16:39] sons furthermore we have a father's of
[1:16:43] our flesh which corrected us and we gave
[1:16:44] them reverence shall we not much rather
[1:16:47] be in subject
[1:16:48] I'm sorry subjection under the father
[1:16:50] spirits and live for they barely for a
[1:16:52] few days chasing us after their own
[1:16:54] pleasure but he for our profit that we
[1:16:59] might be partakers of his holiness now
[1:17:03] no chastening for the present seemeth to
[1:17:05] be joyous can I get a Amen after that
[1:17:09] the body see any time God's chastening
[1:17:12] us it's never joyous and yet at the same
[1:17:15] time we're supposed to sing joy
[1:17:17] unspeakable and full of glory on one
[1:17:20] hand it's not but another hand we can
[1:17:22] have joy in what God is doing because if
[1:17:25] God is correcting us then that proves we
[1:17:27] are as children amen and we're to
[1:17:30] increase and learning like a child
[1:17:32] increases in learning nevertheless
[1:17:36] afterward it yieldeth the peaceable
[1:17:37] fruit of righteousness unto them which
[1:17:39] are exercised thereby amen now look what
[1:17:44] he says where where wherefore lift up
[1:17:47] the hands which hang down and the feeble
[1:17:49] knees have a hard time raising your
[1:17:51] hands lately in church the Bible said
[1:17:52] and raise them up to God a hard time
[1:17:55] working a hard time to praise the Lord
[1:17:57] because you're going through chastening
[1:17:59] you're being spiritually scourge you're
[1:18:01] being tested right day after day week
[1:18:03] after month you're being tested and God
[1:18:05] says just lift up your hands and give
[1:18:07] Him praise amen I love the Lord and make
[1:18:11] straight paths for your feet lest that
[1:18:15] which is lame be turned out of the way
[1:18:17] but let it rather be healed follow peace
[1:18:20] with all men and holiness without which
[1:18:21] no man should see the Lord looking
[1:18:24] diligently lest any man fail the grace
[1:18:26] of God lest any root of bitterness
[1:18:28] springing up trouble you and thereby
[1:18:30] many be defiled so see in the midst of
[1:18:35] in the midst of a trial
[1:18:36] what do you tempted to do you're tempted
[1:18:38] to have be bitter against God or against
[1:18:40] other people in the midst of a trial if
[1:18:43] we don't understand it to trial
[1:18:45] we'll get bitter either with God or some
[1:18:48] whoever God involves in the trial
[1:18:50] look what brother branham says here I
[1:18:52] found this quote when I was listening
[1:18:53] here to Revelation chapter 4 part 3 he
[1:18:57] says we have sure enjoyed this time of
[1:18:58] fellowship around the Word of God with
[1:19:00] you fine people I trust that you'll be
[1:19:02] faithful now and come to church and obey
[1:19:05] the teachings of the Bible through our
[1:19:07] gallant brother here brother Neville
[1:19:09] which I highly recommend as a servant of
[1:19:12] the Lord and moving on deeper and deeper
[1:19:15] with God and I'm so happy for that
[1:19:20] brother Graham said and the little
[1:19:21] church I admonish you in the name of the
[1:19:24] Lord Jesus to grow in the grace of God
[1:19:28] hold yourself steady and look towards
[1:19:32] Calvary all the time
[1:19:34] amen taking all the roots of bitterness
[1:19:38] out of your heart and soul that God
[1:19:40] might use you at any time now is that
[1:19:44] what we just read if we don't take the
[1:19:47] roots of bitterness out of our hearts
[1:19:48] the Bible said we could fail the grace
[1:19:51] of God you could miss God's grace for
[1:19:53] your life you could spurn God's grace
[1:19:55] because of bitterness that's what
[1:20:00] exactly what brother Graham said - if we
[1:20:02] don't get bitterness out of our hearts
[1:20:03] if we don't endure the the chastening
[1:20:05] and the trials then he says God can't
[1:20:09] use you I think we all want to be used
[1:20:13] by the Lord the RAM said if you ever
[1:20:16] feel to do something or a revelation or
[1:20:18] something comes to you strangely
[1:20:19] something warning or something be
[1:20:21] careful Satan is slick and sly asking me
[1:20:25] put it with the word of God and consult
[1:20:27] your pastor this is what he's telling
[1:20:28] you Branham tabernacle in other words go
[1:20:31] he said obey the teachings of brother
[1:20:33] Neville go deeper with God keep all the
[1:20:36] bitterness out of your heart growing the
[1:20:38] Lord he said keep your eyes on Calvary
[1:20:40] all the time amen and then he talks
[1:20:44] about how Satan likes to get in gifts
[1:20:46] and he likes to pervert gifts in the
[1:20:48] church but have said for
[1:20:51] give me if I sound like I'm a I'm a boss
[1:20:54] he said I'm no boss but I feel like Paul
[1:20:57] said back there around the congregation
[1:20:58] you're the stars in my crowns when I
[1:21:01] cross over the land on the other side
[1:21:02] yonder and meet you in that glorify
[1:21:04] condition I want to stand there to shine
[1:21:07] like the stars in the crown I want you
[1:21:09] to be there
[1:21:10] and I want to be there and he said God
[1:21:14] never sent brother Neville and me to be
[1:21:15] bosses not at all we're just your
[1:21:17] brothers were instructors in the gospel
[1:21:20] and let's all work together
[1:21:22] oh don't you like that glory now look
[1:21:29] what brother F says look look how humble
[1:21:30] this is I read you're really humble
[1:21:31] quote on Sunday remember bro Graham said
[1:21:33] I don't want to be one of those twelve
[1:21:36] judges
[1:21:37] remember it's look how humble yours now
[1:21:39] look how humble he is again and now
[1:21:42] sometimes we think we are the elected
[1:21:45] and he says I hope we are you know
[1:21:52] people get up here and say I know I'm
[1:21:53] going the rapture I know I'm the elected
[1:21:55] I know I'm the bride and brother may
[1:21:57] have said I hope we are see look how
[1:22:01] humble that is now church sometimes your
[1:22:03] faith might speak out and yes you
[1:22:05] believe that without then you just keep
[1:22:06] going on believing it right you only
[1:22:08] live as high as your confession let me
[1:22:10] know that but see there's times in
[1:22:12] humility you know he says we think we're
[1:22:16] elected I hope we are but let's just
[1:22:19] stay right with the Bible see that's
[1:22:21] that will prove you are the elected when
[1:22:24] you guided into all truth amen the
[1:22:29] Murrah have said then if everything is
[1:22:31] right through the scripture and in order
[1:22:32] with the scripture bringing glory to God
[1:22:34] in the honor of the church and so forth
[1:22:36] then we know that it is of God because
[1:22:39] the Bible backs it up but just our
[1:22:41] Theory won't back it up
[1:22:42] it won't know do no good it falls
[1:22:45] through so then it's something that
[1:22:48] struct us no matter how real it seems if
[1:22:50] it's not right not scriptural just get
[1:22:52] rid of it because there there's a real
[1:22:54] one waiting you see so there's a
[1:22:57] revelation someone thinks they have or
[1:22:59] understanding just wait on it put it to
[1:23:02] the Bible he said consult your pastor
[1:23:04] and
[1:23:05] it is it'll be right in the scripture
[1:23:07] but I wanted to read that because of
[1:23:09] what he said about at the top of this
[1:23:11] quote he said I admonish you grow in the
[1:23:14] Grace and knowledge of God if there's
[1:23:17] something preached at this pulpit let's
[1:23:20] do all we can to obey it praise the Lord
[1:23:24] let's try let's do everything we can to
[1:23:27] to bring our bodies into subjection and
[1:23:30] obey the word of the Lord because that's
[1:23:34] the brother Branham said 'keep if
[1:23:35] there's anything that gets bitter
[1:23:36] between you and a brother or you and a
[1:23:38] sister get it out of your heart talk to
[1:23:40] them pray get it out because it will
[1:23:43] make you in a spot where God can't use
[1:23:45] you alright so I wanted to make sure I
[1:23:49] read you read that by the grace Lord I
[1:23:51] heard that this week and I thought I
[1:23:52] like to read that to the church I like
[1:23:54] to share that with them I thought that
[1:23:55] being good encouragement because what
[1:23:56] would a prophet say what would the
[1:23:58] Prophet say if he's just stopping in the
[1:23:59] church and then that next he went to
[1:24:01] Beaumont Texas what would he say he
[1:24:03] would say stay with your pastor go
[1:24:05] deeper in the Lord
[1:24:06] obey what's being preached keep all the
[1:24:08] bitterness Ardea heart and always look
[1:24:10] to Calvary
[1:24:10] what would the Prophet say that's what
[1:24:13] he said amen keep all the sin out and
[1:24:16] always look to the cross of Jesus Christ
[1:24:18] amen people that think we worship
[1:24:21] brother Branham are so misguided may God
[1:24:23] help them this man oi pointed to the
[1:24:27] cross straight to the blood straight to
[1:24:29] love love love to buy love that's the
[1:24:31] only thing that's making it over there
[1:24:33] amen
[1:24:33] you see that's that's what we be taught
[1:24:36] us now let's go back to proverbs let's
[1:24:38] go to chapter 13 now because member
[1:24:43] whoso loveth instruction that means
[1:24:45] correction if you love correction you'll
[1:24:47] love knowledge if you love to be
[1:24:51] corrected you'll love known that's why I
[1:24:53] love and guests ministers coming you
[1:24:55] know I'll preach for a month really hard
[1:24:56] or two months or and then I get a guest
[1:24:58] minister in here and i could' there's
[1:24:59] times I get corrected by that and I
[1:25:01] always rejoin something I never thought
[1:25:02] about that
[1:25:03] oh praise the Lord I needed to help in
[1:25:05] there or I needed prayer amen and I
[1:25:08] always enjoy that a Christian man who
[1:25:11] loved being corrected by the Word of God
[1:25:13] that's right
[1:25:16] chapter 13
[1:25:17] verse 13 13 13 now look at this who so
[1:25:28] despised that the word shall be
[1:25:29] destroyed but he that feareth the
[1:25:31] commandment shall be rewarded amen so
[1:25:35] now we're promised a reward for fearing
[1:25:39] it and being corrected by it praise the
[1:25:42] Lord I want to make sure I got
[1:25:45] everything in there okay yeah look at
[1:25:47] verse 20 he that walketh with wise men
[1:25:51] shall be wise but a companion of fools
[1:25:54] shall be destroyed amen
[1:25:57] so who are we walking with well we're
[1:25:59] walk with one another now that's good if
[1:26:02] we're walking here together now let's
[1:26:04] make sure on the days we're not here
[1:26:05] we're walking with wise people too
[1:26:07] right because that's where ever you hang
[1:26:10] out with that's who you become the
[1:26:12] people you surround yourself with that's
[1:26:15] right now let's go to chapter 15 verse
[1:26:19] 515 515 5 says this a fool despiseth his
[1:26:34] father's instruction but he that
[1:26:37] regardeth reproof is prudent so again
[1:26:41] we're seeing the opposite the person
[1:26:43] that doesn't want to take correction
[1:26:44] that doesn't want to take it the Bible
[1:26:47] calls him a fool literally now look at
[1:26:50] verse 6 I like these scriptures in here
[1:26:52] in the house of the righteous is much
[1:26:55] treasure do you think they're talking
[1:26:56] about money do you think God is talking
[1:26:59] about millions of dollars here no church
[1:27:03] he's talking about the word of the Lord
[1:27:05] in the house of the righteous as much
[1:27:07] treasure when the revenues of the wicked
[1:27:10] is trouble because we know there's not
[1:27:12] many rich people going to be saved Jesus
[1:27:14] told us that it is possible with God to
[1:27:17] save some rich but he's talking about
[1:27:19] spiritual riches in our houses
[1:27:22] how many wonder house like that like I
[1:27:25] told you on Sunday I think was it Sunday
[1:27:27] night I told the hello testimony
[1:27:29] about that floor worker that came to our
[1:27:30] house and I knew he was gonna play rap
[1:27:33] music so I turned up the Jesus music
[1:27:34] rule out and I prayed before him and he
[1:27:37] said when he walked in the door he said
[1:27:38] he felt like Love just blew past him
[1:27:40] like a wind oh that's the Holy Ghost
[1:27:42] moving like a fire that's the Holy Ghost
[1:27:45] blowing like a win in my children right
[1:27:47] there right now I was right there when
[1:27:48] he said it he said oh I just felt the
[1:27:50] love of God blow past me when I came in
[1:27:52] your house oh I like that don't you
[1:27:55] Church
[1:27:55] what tract but others treasures going to
[1:27:57] be in our house accept the love of Jesus
[1:27:59] Christ
[1:28:00] what other treasure is there and then
[1:28:03] because of that heat and because of my
[1:28:05] girls and show and loved him he's like
[1:28:07] can we get together he's asked us to get
[1:28:09] together and have a playdate over the
[1:28:10] summer what does that the love of God
[1:28:13] does that because we didn't want to hear
[1:28:16] rap we didn't want to hear those kind of
[1:28:17] things we wanted to project the love of
[1:28:19] Christ and so why does that happen when
[1:28:22] it's a that shows that person's getting
[1:28:24] more wise right he's not a fool he's not
[1:28:26] rejecting that but he feels the love of
[1:28:29] Christ and that's what we must always
[1:28:31] project divine love amen
[1:28:34] that was a real testimony to my heart I
[1:28:36] got to share that with others to it so
[1:28:40] see they despise that then won't be
[1:28:42] corrected now go to verse 32 15 32 he
[1:28:52] uses instruction despises his own soul
[1:28:55] but he that heareth reproof getteth
[1:28:57] understanding amen so again it shows how
[1:29:01] much people actually hate themselves if
[1:29:03] they don't take correction from the Word
[1:29:04] of God they really don't love themselves
[1:29:06] the Bible said they actually destroy
[1:29:09] their own soul they despise their own
[1:29:12] soul oh that's awful condition to be in
[1:29:15] let's go to now I think I missed a verse
[1:29:18] here yeah let's go back to 14 I miss
[1:29:20] looks like I missed verse 14 can we go
[1:29:23] back please 15 14 yeah there it is yeah
[1:29:25] here this yeah
[1:29:27] 15 14 the heart of him that hath
[1:29:30] understanding seeketh knowledge but the
[1:29:33] mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness
[1:29:36] they just want to listen to anything but
[1:29:40] see the Bible says if you have the right
[1:29:42] kind of heart you'll seek after
[1:29:43] knowledge you want to know the answer oh
[1:29:46] and that's why that's why we had we
[1:29:48] announced questions and answers on
[1:29:50] Sunday brother Aaron had three questions
[1:29:51] and I said if you have a question write
[1:29:53] it down we'll be happy to answer you a
[1:29:55] church that's a really good sign when
[1:29:56] you've got questions it means you're
[1:29:58] really hungry for more of God but if you
[1:30:01] don't have questions then maybe
[1:30:02] something's wrong maybe got to stir your
[1:30:04] heart up a little bit right because
[1:30:06] that's what the Bible says the heart of
[1:30:09] him that hath understanding seeks
[1:30:10] knowledge if you're a real believer
[1:30:12] you're constantly seeking more
[1:30:14] understanding amen that's exactly right
[1:30:18] but a fool and just they just want to do
[1:30:20] a deal with foolishness like the
[1:30:22] foolishness of riches the foolishness of
[1:30:25] money in a sports and and movies that's
[1:30:28] just foolishness right but a real
[1:30:31] Christian wants the knowledge of God so
[1:30:34] you see that now go to verse 28 I don't
[1:30:37] think I read that when did I 28 know
[1:30:39] yeah yeah 328 yes I'd missed that one
[1:30:42] now verse 28 I like this one the heart
[1:30:47] of the righteous study it to answer but
[1:30:50] the mouth of the wicked pours out evil
[1:30:53] things see an evil person they'll just
[1:30:55] answer it right away they'll figure it
[1:30:56] out and they'll try to those just say
[1:30:58] anything but a this this shows your
[1:31:00] heart is righteous when you study
[1:31:02] something out to find the answer I want
[1:31:05] to
[1:31:05] know what God says about this I want to
[1:31:09] know God's feeling about this I want to
[1:31:11] know God's feeling about that like I
[1:31:14] think I told you that one time in
[1:31:15] college before I became the message I
[1:31:16] want to get a tattoo and and God knows I
[1:31:19] didn't wanna do anything wrong I just I
[1:31:20] just I just wanted to I just wanted
[1:31:22] people to see Jesus on me that's how I
[1:31:24] see you it was a natural desire of a
[1:31:26] real spiritual desire right because what
[1:31:29] do you want do you want God's Word on
[1:31:31] your body or do you want to written on
[1:31:32] your heart you see that's the perversion
[1:31:35] so you tattoos the perversion is see
[1:31:38] they they know something needs to be
[1:31:39] written on them but it's the word on the
[1:31:41] heart amen hallelujah so it's a
[1:31:43] perversion see even as a denominational
[1:31:46] person I knew I wanted something rich I
[1:31:48] want everybody to see something on me
[1:31:50] but it was the Holy Spirit that was
[1:31:52] supposed to write it on the fleshly
[1:31:53] tables of my heart
[1:31:54] and so I Church I'm just I'm not saying
[1:31:58] anything I'm just saying this I believe
[1:32:00] my heart was righteous so I didn't take
[1:32:02] my all my buddies were like oh yeah it's
[1:32:03] okay for Christians to get you know
[1:32:04] tattoos because I wasn't in the message
[1:32:06] I'm like okay so it must be but
[1:32:08] something made me stop and it made me go
[1:32:11] back and it caught it made me call my
[1:32:13] pastor that I grew up with
[1:32:14] I said pastor you think it's okay to get
[1:32:17] a tattoo what was it that made me want
[1:32:20] to do that it was a righteous heart
[1:32:22] because a righteous heart studies to
[1:32:25] answer so the pastor said okay here's a
[1:32:27] scripture and he said here talk to my
[1:32:29] wife because she was the youth group
[1:32:30] leader and he knew that she you know
[1:32:32] taught me more often now it's never
[1:32:34] right for a woman to teach a man and I
[1:32:35] know that but she actually pointed me to
[1:32:37] Leviticus 19 where it says thou shalt
[1:32:39] not mark your skin and after that church
[1:32:43] I wasn't even the message but after that
[1:32:44] that word so struck me that the Holy
[1:32:47] Spirit made me run away from the tattoo
[1:32:49] parlor see because the righteous if you
[1:32:54] have a righteous heart you'll study that
[1:32:56] to answer and I only studied it by
[1:32:57] asking one person well I'm sorry to
[1:32:59] people but see my heart was so righteous
[1:33:02] it's still one of the answer how do you
[1:33:04] want the answers today amen brother man
[1:33:07] said we've got Satan's answer to his
[1:33:09] questions man we've got the Word of God
[1:33:11] Alleluia but see we've got us take down
[1:33:14] and study if you don't understand
[1:33:16] something sit down and study it
[1:33:19] that's what I love about the church age
[1:33:21] book if you really want to study God and
[1:33:24] know God then you'll read the church age
[1:33:25] book you'll read the seal book if you
[1:33:28] really want to know God you'll study
[1:33:30] down if you got a righteous heart you'll
[1:33:31] read that and study that I know it's not
[1:33:34] the most easy book to read I know some
[1:33:36] of the paragraphs are a whole page long
[1:33:38] and that's not really good writing for
[1:33:41] our modern brains today and it seems
[1:33:44] like it's hard to read it time and it
[1:33:45] may be but the fact is if a person is
[1:33:49] humble they'll dig down deep they'll
[1:33:51] spend time because they're hungered and
[1:33:53] thirsting for righteousness and if you
[1:33:54] hunger and thirst God promised to fill
[1:33:56] you you see that the heart of the
[1:34:00] righteous study a--the to answer now
[1:34:03] later you see you got to balance this
[1:34:04] out because later Solomon says if you
[1:34:06] study too much it's weariness to the
[1:34:08] flesh but that's worldly studying right
[1:34:11] that's worldly studying because Paul
[1:34:14] told Timothy give yourself to studying
[1:34:17] give all yourself to studying the
[1:34:19] exhortation to teaching the instruction
[1:34:21] and righteousness is training and all
[1:34:23] these things give yourself wholly to
[1:34:25] that so see Solomon is saying that
[1:34:27] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:29] right and so see a real believer wants
[1:34:34] to study this out and really get down to
[1:34:35] the bottom of it
[1:34:36] amen and so see that's what Christians
[1:34:40] are they're increasing they're learning
[1:34:41] the Bible said a wise man will increase
[1:34:44] his learning now you got to be careful
[1:34:46] let me can I just share something real
[1:34:48] quick it has nothing to do with anyone
[1:34:49] in this church but I've come across two
[1:34:51] people that were on this Flat Earth
[1:34:55] thing and I might what my response is
[1:34:59] always this what does it really matter
[1:35:00] if it's flat or spherical but I believe
[1:35:03] it's fear achill because that's what I
[1:35:04] believe that's what the Bible says I can
[1:35:06] think I think I improve that many ways
[1:35:08] I've seen two people not from our church
[1:35:10] but they've contacted me out of blue
[1:35:12] they're like Jesse what do you think
[1:35:13] it's flat and you know the Bibles of
[1:35:14] this and that and and both of them have
[1:35:17] let it go too far
[1:35:18] where they start condemning people that
[1:35:20] don't feel it their way
[1:35:23] criticizing preachers you know who bring
[1:35:26] out brother random quotes and bible
[1:35:28] bible scriptures they'll criticize and
[1:35:32] they
[1:35:33] they get a wrong spirit and so see
[1:35:36] what's happening here they find
[1:35:39] something that they think they can study
[1:35:41] here and they and they they get off with
[1:35:44] the wrong spirit on to something in
[1:35:47] other words I said I this they make the
[1:35:48] minor a major and they go after things
[1:35:52] that don't really pertain to salvation
[1:35:55] there's a flat earth or spherical earth
[1:35:57] pertain to your salvation you see so
[1:36:03] there's a balance you know the righteous
[1:36:05] heart studies the answer well the
[1:36:06] pastor's that I've known even myself I
[1:36:08] went and studied it out for different
[1:36:09] people outside the church and I showed
[1:36:11] where the Bible says this and the Bible
[1:36:13] said it goes around like a circle and
[1:36:15] everything like that and people can
[1:36:17] write it off
[1:36:18] the Bible said you know the sinners went
[1:36:19] to the heart of the earth and there's
[1:36:21] all kinds of scriptures I don't I don't
[1:36:23] have a memorize in front of me but see
[1:36:25] if we're not careful we'll study things
[1:36:28] you know Satan will get in there and
[1:36:30] we'll study things that don't really
[1:36:31] pertain to salvation and so when the
[1:36:35] Bible says study to answer we got to
[1:36:38] make sure we study the right things okay
[1:36:41] actually the three people I know that
[1:36:43] got wrong about the Flat Earth three
[1:36:46] people and it took away time that they
[1:36:49] should have been praying and investing
[1:36:51] in the things that they needed like
[1:36:54] overcoming addictions like overcoming
[1:36:57] bitterness because I know the
[1:37:01] individuals were bitter against
[1:37:02] preachers but to get back at him they
[1:37:04] thought they had a revelation about the
[1:37:06] Flat Earth and they just want to get
[1:37:07] back at the preacher get back at the
[1:37:08] preacher and one of them even left the
[1:37:10] message and one of them sorry to have
[1:37:12] left the message and one of them had
[1:37:14] trouble with adulterous spirit and the
[1:37:17] Deacons had to hunt him down the church
[1:37:18] because he started hitting on women see
[1:37:21] that they got off they got off on a
[1:37:23] tangent
[1:37:23] they're trying to study things something
[1:37:25] that's not a major or something that's
[1:37:27] not really important and Satan got in
[1:37:30] there to try to deceive him like that
[1:37:32] does everyone understand now wisdom
[1:37:34] would tell you if it's not a major let
[1:37:36] it alone
[1:37:37] that's what I've said to if I don't have
[1:37:39] the exact answer what does it really
[1:37:41] matter if it's flat or round I believe
[1:37:43] it's round because you looking at the
[1:37:45] moon you can see it's round
[1:37:47] right and it rotates around the earth we
[1:37:50] see that you know we could we can see
[1:37:52] that but what does it really matter at
[1:37:54] the end of the day right what does it
[1:37:56] really matter what matters at the end of
[1:37:57] the day do we love the Word of God do we
[1:38:00] love Jesus Christ and are we loving
[1:38:02] other people amen are we getting all the
[1:38:05] bitterness out of our heart toward every
[1:38:06] person and are we keeping our eyes on
[1:38:09] Calvary see these things are
[1:38:12] distractions these sometimes you got to
[1:38:14] preach the other side to where people
[1:38:15] will study the wrong things but see the
[1:38:18] righteous study answer I just that was
[1:38:21] something on my heart I forgot to put my
[1:38:23] notes but I want to share that we got to
[1:38:25] be careful and that's you know my wife
[1:38:26] and I talked about this numerous times
[1:38:27] the message the message is like a
[1:38:31] conspiracy theory and it's a true one
[1:38:35] how many know about conspiracy theories
[1:38:37] you can
[1:38:38] they're just rabbit chases you can go
[1:38:39] down a rabbit hole with all these
[1:38:41] conspiracies about 9/11 and the flat
[1:38:43] earth and how Trump got in there with
[1:38:45] Russia you know there's all these
[1:38:46] conspiracy theories out there but what
[1:38:48] good are they going to do all of you but
[1:38:50] see the message is actually the real
[1:38:52] conspiracy theory because Satan is the
[1:38:55] god of this evil age and he has blinded
[1:38:58] the eyes of them that believe not and
[1:39:01] people are sitting in churches thinking
[1:39:03] they're worshipping Jesus and they're
[1:39:04] actually worshiping the devil so see we
[1:39:07] actually have the true conspiracy right
[1:39:09] here right we have the truth about women
[1:39:13] preachers about water baptism the
[1:39:15] Godhead no eternal hell all these things
[1:39:18] and so that's why the message attracts a
[1:39:20] lot of people and like I said three
[1:39:22] people that were in and three people
[1:39:23] that left because they like conspiracy
[1:39:25] theories they just like how we're
[1:39:27] different but they don't like the word
[1:39:29] and they don't let the word make them
[1:39:31] difference amen
[1:39:33] see we got to make the word help let the
[1:39:35] word make us different
[1:39:36] so we're different and we're different
[1:39:39] with love
[1:39:40] hey man love for God it love for the
[1:39:42] word I hope you understand is every
[1:39:44] understand by God's grace I'm not trying
[1:39:46] to criticize you know people individuals
[1:39:50] I'm trying to criticize the spirits
[1:39:52] behind it
[1:39:53] hope you understand that by the grace of
[1:39:54] Lord see our message attracts a lots of
[1:39:57] people eventually they'll fall away if
[1:40:00] their hearts not in the right
[1:40:00] place right eventually the thorns are
[1:40:03] gonna choke them out if they don't have
[1:40:04] a pure heart so we got to keep our
[1:40:07] hearts pure before the Lord amen so I
[1:40:11] hope I just take that as a little
[1:40:13] warning you know we got to be careful
[1:40:14] what we study we got to be careful what
[1:40:16] we research we got to be careful what we
[1:40:18] look into what we messed our time into
[1:40:20] or if to make sure it's the right thing
[1:40:21] we should be into that's right now let's
[1:40:25] go to chapter 16 chapter 16 verse 21
[1:40:44] 1621 he that follow after righteousness
[1:40:47] and mercy findeth life righteousness and
[1:40:52] honor so there again we follow after it
[1:40:55] now verse 23 am I in the wrong chapter
[1:41:01] yes I'm in chapter 21 forgetting that
[1:41:04] actually fit that one chapter 1621
[1:41:07] forgive me that's that's strange 1621
[1:41:10] the wise and heart shall be called
[1:41:11] prudent and the sweetness of the lips
[1:41:14] increases learning the sweetness of the
[1:41:18] lips increases learning so see what is
[1:41:21] that that's a speaking the word with
[1:41:22] grace let your words be always seasoned
[1:41:24] with grace see when you when you share
[1:41:27] instruction when you when you teach
[1:41:28] others many times when you rebuke others
[1:41:30] we got to say with the right spirit the
[1:41:33] sweetness of it now look at verse 23 the
[1:41:39] heart of the wise teaches his mouth and
[1:41:42] added learning to his lips so see we
[1:41:45] should as we learn we should be able to
[1:41:46] do witness and testify with new
[1:41:48] understandings right I've seen that all
[1:41:50] the time like I heard somebody today
[1:41:53] texted me about well how do you know
[1:41:55] tongues is the evidence and what is
[1:41:57] praying in the spirit and all these
[1:41:58] lessons God has taught me I'm able to
[1:42:01] bring out of my lips but now it's
[1:42:02] through texting right huh but I'm able
[1:42:05] to repeat it and like the gentleman with
[1:42:07] the who attacked me with the Sabbath day
[1:42:09] what the Lord showed me the Holy Spirit
[1:42:11] showed me through brother branham's
[1:42:12] message in the Bible once God showed me
[1:42:14] that
[1:42:14] elation I'm able to share with them
[1:42:16] because that's what learning is you
[1:42:20] receive it and then you give it out to
[1:42:22] somebody else you add learning to your
[1:42:24] lips praise God
[1:42:27] chapter 17 this is quite striking here
[1:42:30] oh boy
[1:42:32] 1710 maokai can you read that for me
[1:42:35] however 1710 can you imagine that a
[1:42:44] hundred stripes a hundred stripes a fool
[1:42:49] could be whipped 100 times and still not
[1:42:53] learn as much as you when you come to
[1:42:54] church amen praise the Lord that true
[1:42:58] and that was what three thousand years
[1:43:00] ago we should be so good at being
[1:43:03] corrected and learning from the Word of
[1:43:06] God we should be so used to it that it
[1:43:09] doesn't take any physical pain we should
[1:43:11] just have an open heart to Lord and say
[1:43:13] yes Lord yes Lord
[1:43:14] we receive it and our lives change when
[1:43:16] we leave the building we shouldn't have
[1:43:18] to be beaten down to it right we should
[1:43:21] learn instruction faster than what a
[1:43:24] fool does because that's what the Bible
[1:43:25] says he's got to be beating 100 times
[1:43:27] and you still learn more than a fool oh
[1:43:30] that's striking Church in other words
[1:43:33] like I say like this in other words our
[1:43:35] spiritual scourging should be more
[1:43:37] effective than even physical scourging
[1:43:38] but how many no physical scourging can
[1:43:41] be effective in Singapore remember the
[1:43:43] guys that got beaten in the 90s the
[1:43:44] Americans went to Singapore they
[1:43:46] spray-painted and they got beaten with
[1:43:48] bamboo rods anybody remember that I
[1:43:50] remember that growing up Singapore is
[1:43:52] one of the lowest rates of vandalism and
[1:43:55] was it violence in the whole world
[1:43:58] because they actually will beat you with
[1:44:00] the rod but the Bible said our learning
[1:44:04] we should have the lowest sin rate in
[1:44:06] all the world the Bride of Christ amen
[1:44:08] glory we should have the lowest sin and
[1:44:11] unbelief rate because the spirit
[1:44:13] corrects us and when the spirit corrects
[1:44:16] us we should respond with love not with
[1:44:19] a hypocritical religion oh my god he's
[1:44:23] just picking on me it's the Holy Spirit
[1:44:26] trying to help us by God's grace
[1:44:29] if you feel like I'm picking on your
[1:44:31] preachers picking on you go talk to them
[1:44:33] then you'll find out if they're picking
[1:44:34] on you if they got if they got the right
[1:44:36] spirit then they'll be they'll be able
[1:44:38] to be corrected they'll be sweet they'll
[1:44:39] be humble if they blow up and get mad
[1:44:42] and you know then that shows they got
[1:44:43] the wrong spirit that's exactly right so
[1:44:48] spiritual rebuke from preaching should
[1:44:51] be more effective to the wise virgins
[1:44:54] and a hundred stripes to a fool isn't
[1:44:58] that striking this is why the bride
[1:45:01] loves cutting messages and brother
[1:45:05] Graham said this is how the Holy Ghost
[1:45:07] preaches let me read this quote here I
[1:45:13] thought it was so wonderful this is up
[1:45:18] reaches in the legacy in church age
[1:45:20] last year programs talking about how if
[1:45:24] you preach hard today the denominations
[1:45:26] will throw you out the door they don't
[1:45:27] want to hear hard preaching brother
[1:45:32] Branham said it's so bad jesus is
[1:45:34] outside of most churches
[1:45:36] knocking trying to get in right and he
[1:45:39] says they was too busy looking at their
[1:45:42] big buildings and become rich their
[1:45:44] great big organizations and getting more
[1:45:46] members that they didn't miss Jesus they
[1:45:49] didn't miss speaking in tongues they
[1:45:51] didn't miss the great powerful messages
[1:45:53] of God who cuts down to the heart and
[1:45:56] circumcised the heart and tears off the
[1:46:00] things of the world and shucks you like
[1:46:02] a piece of corn and the church said amen
[1:46:09] we should enjoy services where it feels
[1:46:12] like everything is getting ripped off
[1:46:14] we're getting exposed it seems like God
[1:46:17] is discerning our lives and we we feel
[1:46:20] guilty we should enjoy that because it's
[1:46:22] leading us to repentance it's leading us
[1:46:26] to a fresh start but the denominational
[1:46:28] churches and other independents they
[1:46:30] don't like that they don't like you to
[1:46:32] tell them the truth
[1:46:35] they don't like that at all
[1:46:40] and if you preached that like that in
[1:46:42] their church they douse you out and
[1:46:43] that's the way the holy ghost preached
[1:46:45] jesus said you generation of vipers you
[1:46:48] snakes in the grass now that's how I
[1:46:50] preach the domination else he he he he
[1:46:53] rebuked his own disciples right he said
[1:46:55] Oh fools you're so to learn and so to
[1:46:56] believe but he also he actually rebuked
[1:46:59] the Pharisees obviously a lot more a
[1:47:02] church how many would say this how many
[1:47:05] would say we want more of Jesus we want
[1:47:07] more speaking in tongues we want more
[1:47:09] miracles we want more prophecies if we
[1:47:13] don't see it we should miss him amen
[1:47:16] we should miss Jesus because that's what
[1:47:18] he does when he comes in the church amen
[1:47:21] and he circumcised of the hearts he
[1:47:24] tears off the things of the world and is
[1:47:26] supposed to shucks us like a piece of
[1:47:28] corn amen program said but you have need
[1:47:36] to get the greatest thing and haven't
[1:47:38] got it Jesus standing outside trying to
[1:47:41] get back in with Pentecost he's trying
[1:47:44] to get back in with Pentecost where we
[1:47:47] want the Holy Ghost we want the promise
[1:47:49] of God we want the supernatural we
[1:47:52] should never lose that we want the
[1:47:55] supernatural because that's how that's
[1:47:57] when we know Jesus is here right he's
[1:47:59] here because he does what he does did it
[1:48:02] Pentecost amen
[1:48:04] oh my so see I kind of caught that
[1:48:14] inspiration from that scripture the
[1:48:17] spiritual rebukes from the pulpit should
[1:48:19] be more effective than physical pain I
[1:48:21] don't know about you but I give in a
[1:48:23] physical pain really fast I can't take
[1:48:25] maybe a whole lot of physical pain maybe
[1:48:28] maybe you're stronger than me I know but
[1:48:31] think of how think of how tired we get
[1:48:34] if we're in pain or think about just if
[1:48:37] we if we get hurt think about how it
[1:48:40] discourages us it gets us down in the
[1:48:44] dumps you know oh I'm sick again every
[1:48:47] time I get sick I feel like I just
[1:48:48] failed the world you know I had to
[1:48:51] cancel Church a few months ago I felt
[1:48:52] like I failed the world
[1:48:53] what can I do I'm the pastor I'm the
[1:48:55] preacher on the song leader I'm
[1:48:56] everything we did can't have Church you
[1:48:59] know but you know our physical bodies
[1:49:05] you know how much we need them just to
[1:49:07] be encouraged and the spiritual review
[1:49:11] chill than that oh lord help us now I
[1:49:22] want to get a scripture here just a
[1:49:23] moment not sure the chapter let me look
[1:49:28] it up real quick I got it right here
[1:49:29] I know it's verse 12 or one of the next
[1:49:39] chapters here forgot to write down the
[1:49:43] chapter I'm sorry I can't find it there
[1:50:03] says the righteous I'll just read it I
[1:50:05] can't find it so verse 12 and somewhat
[1:50:07] one of the later chapters it says the
[1:50:09] righteous man considers the house of the
[1:50:11] wicked and he learns from it again we
[1:50:14] must learn from the heirs of others like
[1:50:16] Jesus said remember Lot's wife so the
[1:50:20] Bible said if you are righteous you'll
[1:50:21] consider the house of the wicked so you
[1:50:25] can learn you and I can learn from those
[1:50:27] who fall away from the truth of God I
[1:50:30] think you know a lot is a great example
[1:50:34] someone whom we all can learn from
[1:50:36] because this is the thought that came to
[1:50:38] me while I was preparing here this
[1:50:40] thought about lot lot was a part of
[1:50:44] Abraham's church can I just say it like
[1:50:46] that can I just call it pastor Abraham
[1:50:49] could is that okay now remember when he
[1:50:52] moved to Sodom and Abraham saw Sodom
[1:50:55] burning Ozzy saw was smoke so when he
[1:50:57] left the church when this foolish virgin
[1:51:00] he was saved but when he left the Church
[1:51:02] of Abraham he'll move so far away he was
[1:51:05] outside the influence of Abraham
[1:51:08] right because they didn't have cars and
[1:51:10] planes in those days it's not like he
[1:51:12] can come to church really easily to hear
[1:51:14] Abraham preach but lot knew he was the
[1:51:17] father of many nations lot knew about
[1:51:20] the promised son lot knew about all
[1:51:23] these things with the messenger of the
[1:51:24] hour and yet he chose to move far away
[1:51:27] and he left the truth of God's Word so
[1:51:32] we know and what did the Bible said he
[1:51:34] lifted up his eyes and he saw the wells
[1:51:36] and the trees of Sodom and he saw all
[1:51:39] the financial prosperity ahead did he
[1:51:41] not and so this is what he did he lifted
[1:51:49] up his eyes and he saw all these natural
[1:51:51] things he said surely that must be God
[1:51:53] but that wasn't and every day he was
[1:51:57] there the Bible said he was tormented by
[1:52:00] sin yet he wasn't righteous man so we
[1:52:05] can see where he made the wrong decision
[1:52:08] if brother Branham said he moved away
[1:52:09] from Abraham and he forgot about the
[1:52:12] promised son or in other words for today
[1:52:16] people forget about the message bringing
[1:52:18] them to a rapture they just get used to
[1:52:21] living life on earth and they forget
[1:52:24] about placing the rapture and the
[1:52:25] promised son has the most important
[1:52:28] thing in our lives that Jesus Christ is
[1:52:30] coming and I must stay with the word
[1:52:32] amen the righteous man considers the
[1:52:38] house of the wicked si lot should have
[1:52:41] considered mine there's a lot of wicked
[1:52:43] houses over there in Sodom and it's
[1:52:45] going to probably hurt my family right
[1:52:47] and it did so much so his wife was
[1:52:50] turned to a pillar of salt
[1:52:53] okay oh thank you
[1:52:57] bless your heart buddy let's go to their
[1:52:59] proverbs 21 12 yeah I missed that thank
[1:53:02] you sir
[1:53:03] yeah there is thank you sir the
[1:53:07] righteous man wisely consider that the
[1:53:09] house of the wicked but God overthrow
[1:53:11] the wicked for their wickedness isn't
[1:53:13] that Sodom and Gomorrah perfectly Locke
[1:53:16] should have considered what kind of
[1:53:18] houses are down there in Sodom do I want
[1:53:21] to
[1:53:21] move my family into Sodom I'm consider
[1:53:24] will consider who's living there right
[1:53:28] and even in our fellowship we got to
[1:53:32] make sure and then when we fell she with
[1:53:34] people outside the message even people
[1:53:36] in the message we got to consider what
[1:53:38] kind of house do they have if we don't
[1:53:41] know the first time we go over we better
[1:53:42] pray before we go over cuz I walked into
[1:53:45] some houses and not all messages message
[1:53:49] not Judaism was Judaism right not all
[1:53:53] Israel's Israel so see consider their
[1:53:58] house consider what they choose to live
[1:54:01] in that a wise man will do that and
[1:54:04] thank you Malachi that was very helpful
[1:54:06] now go to verse 20 this is the one I was
[1:54:09] saying earlier the treasure in your
[1:54:11] house is not the money or the the new
[1:54:14] things or the the devices the things
[1:54:17] that we have or the new free frigerator
[1:54:18] the stove that's not the treasure
[1:54:21] look at verse 20 21 22 be desired and
[1:54:26] oil and the dwelling of the wise but a
[1:54:29] foolish man spit it up amen
[1:54:32] what oil should be in our houses today
[1:54:36] it's not so much you know extra-virgin
[1:54:38] olive oil that's not really the only
[1:54:41] that guy wants in our house it's the
[1:54:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:54:46] but the foolish like the foolish version
[1:54:48] used up their oil didn't have enough oil
[1:54:50] right didn't get enough oil we've got to
[1:54:53] stay with God till we get enough oil and
[1:54:56] make sure that oil stays in our house
[1:54:58] amen and that's increasing you're
[1:55:01] learning that's what it is increasing
[1:55:03] your walk with God increasing the
[1:55:05] presence of God in our homes amen that's
[1:55:09] why I'm glad people feel wind of the
[1:55:11] love coming through my house because I
[1:55:13] feel it too praise the Lord amen
[1:55:16] that's encouraging to me church what is
[1:55:21] the treasure your house the Bible said
[1:55:22] it's oil brother Graham said live in
[1:55:26] such a way that angels can visit your
[1:55:28] house but you have to live in such a way
[1:55:31] where they can visit your house I want
[1:55:34] them to
[1:55:34] in my house again praise the Lord now
[1:55:43] here's another scripture I'm looking for
[1:55:45] is it's the same chapter I don't know
[1:55:46] which one I copied out of yeah okay now
[1:55:48] going on to verse 16 21 16 so go back
[1:55:51] down I thought this was kind of striking
[1:55:54] and I'm almost done I got a few more to
[1:55:56] go I didn't set my time oh my goodness
[1:55:58] my goodness it's already nine o'clock
[1:56:00] okay mercy I lost track of time I didn't
[1:56:03] set my timer tonight that shows you what
[1:56:04] happens I don't set my timer oh mercy
[1:56:06] hours 21 forgive me I feel I know 21 16
[1:56:14] let's read that the man that wanders out
[1:56:16] of the way of understanding shall remain
[1:56:18] in the congregation of the Dead is that
[1:56:19] lot right there lot wondered out of
[1:56:23] understanding Abraham the messenger of
[1:56:25] the hour
[1:56:25] he wanders out of the messenger of the
[1:56:27] hour and he where's he gonna live in a
[1:56:29] congregation of dead people praise the
[1:56:34] Lord so that shows they're not wise
[1:56:38] instead of growing me learning he went
[1:56:41] down there and my dad said he thought he
[1:56:42] could win a few souls and have prayer
[1:56:43] meetings and it was so weak his witness
[1:56:46] was so weak there because of all the
[1:56:47] torment that all the sin was bringing
[1:56:49] upon him he his sons and laws laughed at
[1:56:52] him when he tried to tell him the fire
[1:56:54] was coming oh there's destruction coming
[1:56:57] ha ha ha
[1:56:58] they couldn't even believe him as a
[1:56:59] preacher he should have stayed with
[1:57:01] Abraham now not in the same the flock
[1:57:05] see oh he should have separate the
[1:57:06] flocks right but he should not have left
[1:57:08] the influence because when he left that
[1:57:10] influence of the messenger of the hour
[1:57:11] he went down into a dead congregation I
[1:57:14] remember the Bible said a widow that is
[1:57:16] not a true Widow she's dead while she
[1:57:19] lives right how many people say they're
[1:57:22] alive they're there they're alive
[1:57:24] physically with the heartbeat but
[1:57:25] spiritually there have hearts of stone
[1:57:27] and they're dead to the Word of God and
[1:57:30] we can't hang around those kind of
[1:57:31] people unless we're winning their souls
[1:57:33] or something like that because lot chose
[1:57:35] to separate himself totally from that
[1:57:37] and he leaves the way of understanding
[1:57:39] and wisdom from Abraham remember
[1:57:41] remember God said I know Abraham will
[1:57:43] train his servants in the way of God
[1:57:46] amen but that's not what a lot
[1:57:48] he got attracted by the things he saw he
[1:57:51] changed location he totally left the
[1:57:53] messenger of the hour and he went in the
[1:57:56] way of foolishness and the Bible said he
[1:58:00] was barely saved
[1:58:01] barely oh my and member this connects
[1:58:05] with Jesus Jesus says the Pharisees were
[1:58:07] widened suppl occurs they look good on
[1:58:11] the outside but inwardly they were dead
[1:58:12] the congregation of the Dead two more
[1:58:16] scriptures and I'm done
[1:58:21] 28:23 it's go to proverbs 28 23 I got
[1:58:24] two more 28:23 he that rebuked of the
[1:58:41] man
[1:58:41] word shall find more favor than he that
[1:58:44] flat earth with this tongue so people
[1:58:47] give you more favor when you correct
[1:58:48] them right I found that with the
[1:58:52] children at school I correct them all
[1:58:53] the time and they just keep loving me
[1:58:55] more and more
[1:58:55] they just keep riding me more letters
[1:58:58] they just keep hugging me on my leg more
[1:59:01] and more I'll correct them and a few
[1:59:03] minutes later they're hugging me because
[1:59:05] I do it in love I try to do it love I
[1:59:07] find that even with children you have
[1:59:10] more favor when you correct them now the
[1:59:14] last one chapter 29 verse 1 he that
[1:59:20] being often reproved hardeneth his neck
[1:59:22] shall suddenly be destroyed and that
[1:59:26] without remedy let's stand to our feet
[1:59:28] by God's grace see refusing hardening
[1:59:31] your neck refusing correction from the
[1:59:33] Word of God can bring a sudden judgment
[1:59:36] upon people so we must increase our
[1:59:40] learning and grow in the understanding
[1:59:43] of God let me just say like this this is
[1:59:55] gonna be a battle for us because we're
[1:59:56] in Satan's Eden we have to battle every
[1:59:59] day to make sure we learn more about
[2:00:00] God's Word than we do about other
[2:00:02] worldly things
[2:00:03] how many would agree with me on that as
[2:00:05] we go on it's gonna get harder to stay
[2:00:08] interested in the things of God and feel
[2:00:10] like we can learn because Satan's trying
[2:00:12] to make our flesh so comfortable he just
[2:00:15] wants us to focus on ourselves and make
[2:00:17] our lives so easy but we have to stay
[2:00:19] learning we have to stay digging in the
[2:00:22] Word of God in order to find instruction
[2:00:24] and correction and church I'm sure if
[2:00:28] you're like me now how you come up when
[2:00:29] you're ready I prayed this prayer I said
[2:00:31] Lord whatever you needed to do whenever
[2:00:33] you need to do keep me humble because I
[2:00:35] know if I'm humble and lowly then I can
[2:00:37] receive in correction that's what the
[2:00:39] Bible just said tonight I know if I can
[2:00:42] humble myself I know if God's got to
[2:00:44] spank me or whatever God's got to do do
[2:00:46] whatever you have to do to keep me
[2:00:48] humble so I don't get exalted with pride
[2:00:50] that's the desires of our hearts tonight
[2:00:53] how many on that desire in their hearts
[2:00:54] praise God we serve
[2:00:56] let's sing a song here I know I kept you
[2:00:58] long mercy I shoulda set my watch oh my
[2:01:01] let's just borrows for wear to prayer
[2:01:03] here have any father Lord the scriptures
[2:01:08] are so clear Lord they're speaking so
[2:01:11] powerfully here tonight Lord we need to
[2:01:14] continually learn and increase our
[2:01:16] learning only ask order only a fool
[2:01:19] would stop learning about God what's up
[2:01:23] learning about the message of the hour
[2:01:26] only a fool a foolish version would turn
[2:01:29] their eyes and look to the things of the
[2:01:30] world more than the things of God Oh
[2:01:36] Lord Jesus we need you in this hour Lord
[2:01:39] God we want to be in the congregation of
[2:01:44] the Living dear Lord hallelujah we want
[2:01:49] to become more wise we want to love each
[2:01:51] other more
