[Music] love with calvary thank you for your saving grace [Music] lord i thank you amen that's the first time i've heard that song it's a very very nice song and it's uh it's actually what i'm going to be dealing with amen so in psalm psalms 100 in verse 4 amen psalms 100 and verse 4 it says enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his course with praise it says be thankful unto him and bless his name amen father we thank you for your life lord we thank you for everything that you give to us from yourself father it's what we need and you're all that we need lord and within our lives the journey that you've set for each one of us you've brought each one of us to that place lord of realizing that you are all that we need we don't need anything else uh you are the all-sufficient god and we're grateful lord for many things and i'm grateful lord tonight or this afternoon for this song that was just sung lord you know how fitting it is to what's on my heart so i just pray that you would help us now this is your time and we are your people have your way amongst us we pray in jesus christ holy and precious name we ask it amen amen you may be seated saints god bless you praise the lord amen so i want to go also to luke chapter 17. starting at verse 11. it says and it came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off and they lifted up their voices and said jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed it says turn back and with a loud voice glorified god and fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he and he was a samaritan and jesus answering said he says where there are not ten cleanse but where are the nine it says they are not found that return to give glory to god save this stranger and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith has made thee whole amen so tonight for a topic i just kind of want to for a short period of time just deal with a topic of being grateful amen being grateful just like being humble being grateful also is important to god it's important to god that we show gratitude to him no matter what it is that he does for us no matter how big or how small god wants us to always be in a mindset of gratitude right uh now what god doesn't like is complaining he says do all things without murmuring isn't that right now satan knows that right so because he knows that and guess what he tries to get us to do murmur and complain isn't that right because he's always trying to get us to go against god i mean he wants us to displease god he wants to to uh to create a displeasing atmosphere around us that he knows that god isn't welcomed in isn't that right but uh as a point on that let's go to numbers chapter 21 and verse four now as we go here i want us to keep something in mind uh the the people of god israel right uh their whole journey in the wilderness according to the scripture it was actually ordained of god god said i i'm the one that made you to thirst i'm the one that suffered you to hunger right i'm the one that calls you these 40 years to dwell in the wilderness he says but i did this to prove you to see what was in your heart he says to humble you he says and to bring you to a place that you know that man don't live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god isn't that right so their whole journey in the wilderness was actually planned by god amen how about when we go through our dry times our rough times our wilderness experiences per se amen how many realize that's the hand of god in our lives to achieve those same purposes he says i want to see if you love me or not amen i want to prove you i want to see what's in your heart amen he's i want to humble you amen so god in all of his his wisdom he's he's he's established us in these paths of life and every bit of our path is for a significant reason amen god is achieving something even in the times like we said this morning that don't feel so good amen but yet his hand is in and it's something beautiful that he's bringing out of it you might not be able to see it and appreciate it in that moment but give it time he'll go back and show you in retrospect this was my hand and this is what i was this is what i was doing in your life isn't that right so in numbers chapter 21 and verse 4 it says and they journeyed from mount hor by the way of the red sea to accomplish the land of edom it says and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way it says numbers 21-5 it says and the people spake against god and against moses wherefore have ye brought us up out of the out of egypt to die in the wilderness so now that was the devil working in their minds amen and i'm saying that in that way because that's how these are the same things we experience as you're in the heat of a situation a trial or a tribulation of some sort in your life the devil has a way in which he wants you to view your situation amen and he wants you to begin to feel like you know it's a hopeless situation like i don't see how any good is going to come out of this and you begin to maybe sometimes get discouraged and you begin to make your attitude begins to slip right you understand what i'm saying now you begin to get a little edgy irritable because of what you're going through you don't want because you don't understand it for one right the enemy want to make sure he want to make you frustrated right and that's how they were because as they were going through these situations and coming in contact with this these paths that god has established for them they didn't understand it it didn't feel good but god was proving them but look at the attitude that began to be expressed look at how they begin to view their situation and look at how they allowed the enemy to cause them to slip into a negative frame of mind to the point to now no matter what it was they saw they were seeing it in such a way all they could do was complain notice this now and the people speak against god i've seen people go through certain situations and they begin to question god many times they know better they've been taught better you understand what i'm saying and we're not immune to those things like i said i mean that's why i'm i'm ministering to i'm this is for myself as well because even like i told brother jesse even though we're ministers we find ourselves in places at times where a little amnesia sets in amen we know better we know there is a devil and how he tries to operate or whatever but sometimes you forget about those things and you don't realize it's a devil talking to your mind you understand you think it's just you huh it brings it into a natural realm and that's what he wants he wants us just to look at the natural keep looking at things on eye level and never be able to look up to be able by god's grace to see the bigger picture and what's really going on so they got caught up in that humanistic realm and all they can see is just a natural part of life and they see that they had lack and as a result of that they began to actually speak against god that's a very foolish thing right but yet it happens even today and against moses wherefore have he brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness god already made them a promise so you're going to go into the promised land you understand what i'm saying but look at how how now and this ain't even a real heavy trial right here they just don't have a few conveniences huh how many times we desire to have a certain lifestyle or maybe have certain things in life and we don't have it certain little conveniences that god don't like don't allow us to have at certain times and the enemy want to cause us to go into these mindsets why can't i have this why is it so difficult for me to have that why is it so hard for me to be able to achieve this and if we're not careful we begin to become ungrateful you understand what i'm saying the devil want to make you look so much at what you don't have and what's not going right until you can't give god proper praise for what you do have and what he's doing currently in your life isn't that the devil's objective to cause us to look completely beyond what god is doing and look at everything we don't have it ain't going right and that's what causes mindsets to shift like that and in the midst of when you're supposed to give god praise and should be giving god praise for being able to give you food to eat provide a job for you to be able to work and make money to take care of the necessary things in life like we said this morning to give god thanksgiving just for having good health being able to be able-bodied people that's not paralyzed or you you live to see another day many people died yesterday many people died last night that was brother jesse talking about the football player that died what yesterday he's gone now but god allowed us to be here and if he allowed us to be here guess what that means our purpose isn't finished yet but there are so many things to give god thanksgiving for so when we read in psalms chapter 100 when god says enter into his courts with what thanksgiving now god knew his people had issues going on they had spiritual battles going on everybody wasn't rich everybody didn't have easy streets you understand what i'm saying but god is saying no matter what's going on in your life i don't care what's right what's wrong or what have you when you come to my house i want you to come to my house with a mindset of gratitude amen and don't think about what you don't have don't think about everything that's going wrong when you enter into my gates i want to hear thanksgiving come out of your mouth because i don't care what's wrong i'm the one that's able to make it right i'm able to give you comfort in your mind i'm able to give you peace in your soul i'm able to give you what you can't give yourself but if you approach me in the right way you'll be able to see my hand move mightily on your behalf in your life you understand what i'm saying but it's the attitude that creates the atmosphere brother branham says when you come to god would it the right mental attitude toward any one of his promises he says your attitude would help to bring it to pass why because it produces an atmosphere of faith something that god is looking at in the midst of his child his child going through all kinds of difficulties and god see you in the midst of your trial giving lifting up your voice to give him praise he see that gratitude that gratefulness you tell me brother jesse the parents that are in here when you're shy when your child is grateful when you see gratitude and your child is grateful even for the smallest things they receive huh well how do they make you feel as a parent you understand you get mad lord thank you my child get the picture they understand that life ain't easy and for the little things that they're able to receive lord they're able to give thanksgiving and be grateful and genuinely be happy you understand what i'm saying so how much more god when he sees us being grateful and thankful even for the little things that we have sometimes god will get you comparing yourself against other people you pass you go through these nice neighborhoods sometimes and you you know you just kind of go off in your imagination man that house right there is nice man it'd be nice to have that but if you ain't careful the enemy is slipping they say why ain't got a house like that why i can't be like that well i can't have a car like so and so and when listen now when those things begin to settle in like that you know you know what begins to happen you begin to become dissatisfied with what you do have and depending on the attitudes you have toward what you do have that's that determines how you treat it if you ain't grateful for the car you got guess what you ain't gonna wash it you ain't gonna keep the maintenance up on it you don't get the oil changed why you don't even want the car huh but god is watching you the whole time because he gave you that car you understand what i'm saying he's looking to see how you handle what he gives to you because once once he sees that you can have a right attitude to what he has provided and that makes him want to do more he knows the desires of your hearts isn't that right saints but many times he'll give us amen sometimes what he wants us to have that time but it's a test for us for these reasons right here he want to teach us to be grateful and once we pass that test once he sees that we can really become thankful for whatever it is he provides for us man that make him want to come and do more for us notice this though this wasn't their mind they saw a little lack of little inconvenience and here in verse 15 verse 5 it says and the people speak against god and against moses wherefore have ye brought us up out of either to die in the wilderness but there is no bread neither is there any water now notice what they say here now he says they say in our soul loatheth this light bread you know what i was you know what that means they detested it they were very dissatisfied why we couldn't have better than this as parents you provide to your child for your children what you can but whenever you have a child that'll sit there and because of what you provide isn't what they exactly want and they turn up their mouth they put i don't want that huh what you don't want that you know there's children over there don't even have clothes on their backs one time a day they get a bowl of rice huh and because you don't have exactly what you want you're going to allow yourself to become dis dissatisfied with what's been provided god gave them manner they had food and this was this was better than what they had they didn't they didn't realize it though right because it came directly from the hand of god it was so pure amen it was they called it kosher clean i mean it was clean eating it was the best thing they needed for the journey that they were in isn't that right but yet the devil in their minds made them look upon what god provided and detested we don't want to fall into that same channel isn't that right no matter what it is that god provides us you might not have steak to eat you might not have choice meats or choice clothes or the finest fabrics or the finest cars but whatever you do have show god you appreciate it see lord thank you for my house thank you for my call thank you for my family thank you for my clothes thank you for my job lord the song you guys just saw lord i thank you i give you praise father god and that make him want to come right down in the midst of us and just amen just shower us with his glory with his presence and just do things for us that nothing in this world could ever touch and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of israel died why because they were complaining isn't that something a little complaint a little shifting of the thought of you projected by the devil into the people's minds cause people's lives to be taken how serious is that but yet for you know the devil want to make it seem like a light thing you understand what i'm saying we kind of just kind of toss these little things about lightly like they all mean nothing to god but god looking right at us every time listen and it might not be all together what you show outwardly god sees your inward reactions too we guilty of it right yes sir like say for answers at christmas time somebody give you a gift you don't really like oh you get the gift as soon as you see it you're like man but you smile you say thank you give him a hug but that inward response you understand what i'm saying see we can't do god like that because he looks beyond all the outward show and he looks right down at that real response of the heart and god hears beyond the smile lord i don't like that huh so now this brings it into a little deeper place because in order to be really grateful that's actually a place that god got to bring you into can we say praise the lord saying yes notice here in uh this is very interesting here now all right i want to go to luke 6 right but as i touch on luke 6 just going back to just our opening scripture here or rather the one that we just read concerning the lepers right now those leopards you had 10 of them the bible doesn't tell us how long they were in this condition but we know what comes along with being a leper to a certain degree for the most part we're familiar with some of it right as a leper you were isolated right you couldn't freely mingle amongst the people and neither did people want you to be around them because of the condition right so you are isolated from amongst the people you had a very difficult life because not only were you isolated you were suffering in your body right this illness this sickness takes a whole and it begins to break down the body in certain ways and many times people lose limbs and stuff like that right so you got these 10 men we don't know how long they were in this condition but yet i'm sure they had heard about the testimonies of jesus christ right obviously because when they saw him and they knew that it was him that was coming look at what they did they cried out for mercy they called him master amen these are key points now yes they saw him come and they wanted relief from their condition and they called him master but now he called the master and he knew what they wanted and he told them go show yourself to the priest and the bible says as they turn to go in obedience to his command all of them were healed but even though they all were healed only one who was a samaritan came back once he saw he was healed to give him glory to give him praise but notice this now this is god in flesh and look at what god chose to pay attention to now notice he healed all of them as we read here in luke 6 chapter 35 it says beloved your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing nothing again and your reward shall be great and i didn't know i i've always operated by a certain thing just so i can help myself and the individual that i'm helping helping to be relieved of of certain pressures somebody might have a need for something right and if i have it i'll have no no problem helping them to be able to if it's financial or whatever you know but whatever i give i give it and i don't want you to return anything back to me because if you have a need for it now that means that when it's time for you to pay me back you may not be able to really afford to pay me back but you will try to out of your lack and i don't want to put the person back in that same situation that they were in when they had the bar in the first place so if i let somebody have something you have in it you don't have to worry about paying me back and that helps to relieve me also from having mind battles that this person borrowed something from me and they ain't tried to pay it back yet so you can have it amen and the bible actually says praise the lord it says lynn hoping for nothing again and god know why he's doing that right it says and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the children of the highest because this is how he operates right but notice what it says here it says for he is kind unto the unthankful so notice this now when he healed those ten men before he even healed them he already knew nine of them were ungrateful but he healed them anyway all ten and when the one came back he already knew nine wasn't coming back but for the sake of the scriptures he went ahead and just expressed the whole thing and said wasn't that ten how come where's the other nine at he already knew where they were they were going on with their normal lives again unthankful ungrateful it means a lot when you when you know somebody asks you to help them to do something or whatever to do something for them or whatever and you help them you know even amongst brothers and sisters how that didn't make you feel good when your brother or sister say thank you that's right even for parents to children the children that turn into the parents thank you mom thank you dad and for the children also for the parents you know you do a little something you like to be able to the parents to say thank you that makes you feel good right these nine men didn't even turn around and say thank you he re all right let's go a little deeper the word gratitude what does it mean gratitude means the quality of being thankful it means readiness to show appreciation for and to return kindness isn't that what the one that turned that return did he was ready to show appreciation what does appreciate means appreciate means to recognize the full worth of so once he was healed by the grace of god he recognized the full worth that was in christ and he turned around to give appreciation amen to the one that healed him amen listen now don't notice this now all right appreciate means to recognize the full worth of to understand the worth or importance of something or someone then thankful thankful means being pleased and relieved being relieved means no longer feeling distressed or anxious reassured so christ relieved those lepers of the condition they were suffering with for so long you understand what i'm saying he pleased them and he relieved them but the nine didn't even want to turn back around and give him appreciation recognizing his full worth they went on as though he was known i mean once they got what they got they didn't even care no more the lord don't like that amen god don't want us to deal with one another like that right isn't that right god god is mindful of how we handle one another and how we respond and react to things amen he was paying close he said where where are the other nine at now i healed ten and only one stranger came back to say thank you notice what our prophet says here i love this amen this is in the message of uh where are we at this is the message message of who is this but before i before i touch that i'm gonna read to you this this is the message of without money and without price brother branham says in any man or woman that's born of the spirit of god and receives the holy ghost listen to this now any man that's born of the spirit of god and receives the holy ghost will always be thankful that's a quality that the holy spirit brings into a person's life he says they will always be thankful watch he says no matter whatever happens you will be grateful huh see the holy ghost is god himself coming inside of a person's life and you begin to have the mind of god you understand what i'm saying and this is something that god introduced into his sons and daughters lives you will be a grateful people nobody ain't got to remind you to be thankful amen it comes from your soul knives by nature you understand that amen so now this particular message here is called who is this he says and as he come riding like riding in right he says lots of people said he's a healer oh we we seen him open the eyes of the blind we seen him make the crippled man to walk he says we seen him off a prayer and a fever left the child it says but then those type were only following him for the loaves and the fishes you have people that follow god only for the good things they can get out of him they don't really have a heart to give their hearts to them you understand what i'm saying there's a message brother jesse that's kind of been in the back part of my mind for a while it's a strange title the categories of the world you know because different people fall into different categories you know strange topic he ain't gave me the okay yet so i'm just holding it until the lord tell me okay but notice this now he says and that's the way the crowds are today many he says if there's a healer they follow him it says he's just an oasis it says if they get sick they run say oh will you please pray for me that the lord jesus will make me well and as soon as they come out of the hospital or the sick bed right back into the things of the world they go like a dog to its vomit he says oil or a hulk to its wallet as the scripture says just follow him for what good they can get out of him right it says they just use him for like a totem pole something like that he said that they can get from him and don't expect to serve him the crowd still goes on today he says there were nine lepers healed and one returned to give him praise he says or was it 10 he says they he says one of them returned to give him praise and the rest of them went ahead he says ungrateful he says listen i'm sorry he says in a paragraph 45 it isn't what we do he says it's what he has done for us nothing that we could do to merit anything he says who could we the unrighteous ones ever do anything to merit something before the great jehovah god and his great supreme holiness see we only thing we can do is accept and be grateful for what he has already done for us he says it's so simple so god is looking for for a grateful heart he want us to be grateful no matter what it is that that that that we face in life or whatever you might be having your hardest time most difficult moments but god allows those things to come to test us amen he's proving us he's established he's he's he's ridding us of things that's not right not good bad habits bad ideas bad thoughts right he's deprogramming us and he's reprogramming us amen he's getting our thinking right he's getting our lives recalibrated if you understand what that means my manufacturing friends they understand that you got to you got to calibrate an instrument to get it working right amen and make sure it's reading everything right from that point but god got to recalibrate our minds because it can get off sometimes thinking our views can get a little twisted got to realign everything praise god amen i'm gonna end with this note right here saints in the message of conferences brother branham says sometimes i wonder if we don't do a little bit too much complaining when everything isn't quite right quite like we wanted a little too much complaining it's nothing wrong with wanting your life to be structured in a certain way to have certain things or whatever you know and to the young adults just by experience everything don't go the way that you plan well i'm gonna go to such-and-such school i'm gonna do such and such thing it's good to plan but just put god first right he said lean not to your own understanding but in all your ways acknowledge him he said he'll direct your paths but his path for you may not be according to your desire and he has to he has to he has to work with you and bring you to a place to where you can be all right with that because my i i think my life was going to be like this career-wise and different things you know but early on the lord had to humble me you had to bring me to a place to realize life ain't about all what you want it's about what i want it's about what my purpose is for you and no matter where that might be you might end up living someplace you never would have thought of before i didn't know i was going to be back in south carolina i was ready to branch out after growing up there for all my life had i already had a job set in north carolina already hired and everything and on my way across country me and my wife to go there i was in oklahoma or in texas or somewhere and my i just changed my mind and saying i ain't going to the job thought i had something better waiting for me back at home and then once i got home the job i got was making less than the one i passed off i thought i made a mistake but you know god what god was doing he was bringing me back to the church home i needed to be in so he can begin to deal with me you understand what i'm saying i didn't understand that at that time but by and by he helped me to understand but notice what he said said sometimes i wonder if we don't do a little bit too much complaining he says when we think of now notice he's talking about a time where there was a war going on right so there was an actual war going on and soldiers were fighting on the field giving their lives he says when we think of the but when we think when we think of having to boil the coffee twice and complaining about it he says in men dying on the field young american blood being shed on the field and blood of the nations poured out and then we complain about some little sacrifice that we have to make he says it seems like i hope this doesn't seem wrong but we seem to be more or less an ungrateful people for the things that we do have he says we don't put the evaluation to the things that we do have meaning we don't look at it and begin to think about the fact that god you gave this to me you understand what i'm saying the people could have been left with nothing to eat in the wilderness but god gave them manna but because it wasn't according to their taste they they they had a different taste they had acquired when they were in egypt certain herbs and spices that were mixed in with their food and they were they were expecting a different flavor to what they had and because it wasn't exactly to their taste they began to complain and as a result of their complaining you had many of them that died why because of a murmur that the devil put into their hearts that they yielded to and they began to look they began to be ungrateful unthankful before god and god said i'm not having that so that's an example that god allowed to be there for our sakes can we say praise the lord so i'm done i just came to tell you to be grateful amen to show god thanksgiving no matter what you go through you might not have all the best but actually what you have is the best because it was given by god treat it as the best take care of it right take care of what you have and god is watching that because if he can give you that and he can see that you handle it right and take care of it it makes him want to do more for you now according to his will he may give you the very desire of your heart because he sees you grown and he sees now that you understand the significance of appreciating and being thankful for what it is he provides for you amen is all in his power he can do anything isn't that right i believe that so god bless you saints i appreciate the fellowship i appreciate the time that we've had together keep me in prayer of course keep my family in prayer and by god's grace we'll keep all of you in prayer let us stand together amen and let's give the lord a handclap of praise [Applause] thank you lord amen after we pray i think it'll be fitting to kind of put that song
