worship the lord tonight let's go to our bibles here let's go to first timothy chapter four i'm gonna set a timer i'm gonna try to be 45 minutes here we're gonna try real hard so uh first timothy four verse one first timothy four verse one like to preach on doctrines of devils part two tonight i felt it kind of opened up again today as i was studying kind of like last wednesday so we'll just see what the lord has in store for us here tonight first timothy 4 verses 1 2 and 3. first timothy 4 1 2 and 3. let's all read verse 1 together then uh we'll just read verse one yeah we kind of went over this on sunday let's just read verse 1. let's bring in on three here ready one two three now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils amen let's have one more word of prayer if we can't hear by god's grace heavenly father we love you we love that man from galilee for he was the word made flesh hallelujah before he's in galilee lord in bethlehem before he was there he was in heaven in the mind of god and became the logos after that and lord than the logos the word became flesh hallelujah and lord they handled him they touched him they held him lord god what a blessing father god there i sought but yet lord that man from galilee said they're more blessed to believe having not seen lord god so we thank you for that blessing lord god and our faith is in you and lord we're trusting in you today lord that same man from galilee to preach the word lord to us to give us strength o god to give us faith and confidence and revelation lord god as we're praying before service the greatest thing we can pray for is revelation lord so reveal your revelation reveal your thoughts reveal your mind your will your plans what you shall do reveal it to us lord give us a portion of that mind of christ here tonight god and we'll give you all the thanks all the praise all the glory please heal our sick lord god and minister to the miracles that we need lord god do miracles amongst us so god we pray in jesus name minister to the unspoken request o god thou are worthy thou art holy thou art always on time you're the on time god and we just trust in you tonight lord god to do what only you can do lord god and we just know you'll do it we just trust you to do it we give you thanks and praise in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you you're being seated god so let's do 45 minutes here and we'll see how this goes and just i just announced it right before we did the prayer brother amen was hoping to do a fellowship on march 5th so that's a saturday in the afternoon so i told him yeah brother i'll let the church know i need to text everybody but um so if the weather's nice we'll take the kids to the park maybe do a bible study or something like that or if it's cold we'll go get fun and then we'll get all warmed up or something like that but the main thing like brother said have the warmness of the holy ghost in your soul right that's what as a christian that's what you want to be around god's people more you know you just love god's people can't get enough of them praise god hallelujah so i have some slides here hun i got some uh scriptures uh we'll try to uh minister here tonight by the holy spirit and just trust god to speak his words to us here now i want to just briefly say you know i've been studying individual spirits uh as far as what the bible says about individual demons i've also been studying about all the effects of the holy spirit so we'll try to get to those on sunday lord willing and then like i said i want to show examples of uh absolute uh doctrines of devils i want to show some of those at some point sorry let's get plugged in here with the i just unplugged it i'll try it again but as i've been studying these i found that um they all have names you know and different things like that and i just want to i want to find a scriptural background for all these spirits so when those spirits come against you you can speak to those spirits in the name of jesus christ and church they have to flee wait a little bit you know when i've cast out devils and seen that i got to wait a minute or two but they'll eventually go right you gotta pray you gotta stand there on god's word right they're they're wrestling they're trying to uh they're trying to keep their uh territory but if you just hold on to god's word keep confessing the word of god and if and if everyone wants the victory there and if everybody's confessed all their sins that devil has to move praise god that's that in the name of jesus we're just saying about it we have the victory in the name of jesus praise god like remember when cam was here you know uh that devil of diabetes tried to come on and remember that when he was here preaching not long ago and he said just kept come he said it left that first time it came back in the morning he had to rebuke it again okay yeah you might have missed that were you here when cam was here last time okay yeah so uh that's what come he said a spear he felt an evil spirit come upon him and his heart started beating and he just felt it was he felt the holy spirit gave him a discernment this was a diabetes spirit or we'd say a spirit of infirmity right infirmity means sickness a sickness is coming on someone and so brother cam rebuked it he said i'm not taking that i think a doctor might have tried to tell him of that as well well he said he said after a moment it left and he felt fine he said he woke up that next morning and that same sickness was upon him and he said he felt it was a devil so he rebuked it and then it said not a few minutes after that then it was gone by god's grace again so just in other words there's times where you can feel evil how many can understand what i'm talking about there's times you walk into places and you can feel evil well that's a demonic presence right and god protects us right we know that but i'm we're talking about here with a personal battle or personal battle you have the authority if you confess all your sins you have the authority to rebuke the spirit in the name of jesus and jesus did it by name jesus called you spirit he called it the devil you spirit of infirmity or he'd say you deaf and dumb spirit come out of him right so that's why i want to go in in these next few services uh because then when these spirits come now we realize they they come as sicknesses but they also come as doctrines right and then we have the authority as a believer to cast down any evil spirit the bible says anything that exalts itself against the knowledge of god it must be cast down it must be thrown down in other in other words rebuked it must be stood up against you must take your your ground as a christian praise god so i want to just show this now all evil spirits whether they're sicknesses or religious demons i was listening to demonology today by brother brad i'm about religious spirits but no matter what kind of demon it is whether it's a sickness or a spiritual demon they're there to bring you into bondage or uh develop bad habits in your life and that's what brother bram says you know i've read this a few weeks ago but i just want to read it again he said today a man might go out drink smoke curse do the things his habits is hanging on to him it's rooted in there it's a spirit so it's a just like a root of bitterness it can be a root of infirmity or it can be a root of selfishness or root of jealousy right a root of pride a root of uh lust or arrogance or whatever it is it's got a root it has the person has accepted it and they like that spirit they they worship that he said habits are spirits so bad habits are when spirits get into people's lives or minds and they're not driven out they're just accepted okay i'm gonna live with this it's okay for me to live like this i enjoy living this i can't overcome it that's that that's a person that has a demon possessing their mind right it might not be the full demon possession we'd say like mary magdalene had seven demons in her as she was a prostitute seven demons all right so think about the people we know that sleep around brother they've got demons upon demons upon demons on them at least maybe seven maybe more right because mary magdalene had seven and she had to get delivered from seven demons by jesus right and the brother man said they're unclean spirits in men he said excuse me he said but we're in the judgment house of god we must say these things clear like a man he said when he's lustful he's a sex maniac not only that just lustful the way women dress he said no wonder they are if women comes women can become the same way now listen lustful spirits get on them and they're nice ladies sometimes you have mean ladies that are lustful but then you have sometimes you have nice just like the pharisees they weren't willing to be lustful they might not have been sleeping around but they were nice in some ways you're kind old priests right so see a demon can be anointing someone and they act nice but wait till you start calling them out that's when you're going to see what they're what's inside of them because satan hates to be exposed that's why the pharisees sadducees the demon-possessed people wanted to kill jesus because jesus was calling them out amen and that's what as christians we must be honest if we've got a sin we must be honest and call it out if we want to be free if we want godly habits we must call out our bad habits and you don't got to tell the world but you got to tell jesus amen hallelujah if you want someone to pray for you got to tell them to pray for them as for they can pray for you as well so see this idea of every spirit brings bondage is right no matter the spirit because the bible says in meekness so we must go to people that are taken captive by spirits and be humble and instruct them because they oppose themselves they're fighting against their own spiritual life right they're hurting themselves but we have to be meek about it if god will per venture give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth the fact that they are enslaved to a demon right if they are enslaved to we'd say lust or enslaved to pride because a lot of people today are enslaved in pride right like the pharisees and they may recover i'm sorry that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil so anyone with bad sinful habits is trapped in a snare a trap of satan right and they're taken captive so satan has them can you imagine satan's got him chained up in like we say like a bird caged up like a bird when someone has bad habits that's what they are in one way they're chained they're locked up they can't get out of that there's no way they can get out but jesus came church to set us free amen that's the whole point he came was destroy the works of the devil hallelujah right and to destroy satan's works to set god's people free amen from bad habits hallelujah because they're slave they're enslaved to bad habits and they get on them through many times through doctrines of devils in other words the church allows them to do it and tells them to do it and it's a deceiving spirit behind the preacher many times that will allow them to live as a slave to sin may god help us not to ever allow or put up with evil spirits but to drive them out praise god and preach victory and preach holiness praise god amen and to preach overcoming power to speak freedom by the holy spirit that we can live it and possess all spiritual blessings amen hallelujah we're going to fight yes we're going to fight daily we're going to fall short every day but that doesn't mean we're slaves to it that doesn't mean we have to develop the bad habit of it it just means we've got to repent and move on with god and forget the things in the past and press forward toward the mark of the high calling in christ jesus amen i got 36 minutes so bear hold on hold on hold on old faithful amen romans 8 says you've not received the spirit of bondage how many can say amen to that i'm not received a devil that will keep me enslaved to sin but we've received the spirit of adoption that means relationship we've received the spirit of a relationship with god almighty amen whereby we cry abba father or daddy daddy or abba father it's father just another name for father it's a it's a childlike name for father abba father that's what jesus prayed abba father daddy father he has such an intimate relationship praise god see we haven't received that now look uh here's why people receive spirits of bondage and any any evil spirit is a bondage spirit while they promise themselves i'm sorry while the preachers promised them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption so in churches that are deceived they have preachers that are bound by sin and they preach lies and they get the people bound in sin like the example let me just the biggest church in america as a pastor that will not preach against homosexuality so by him not preaching it it allows those people to stay slave in the habits of homosexuality amen and they he'll promise them liberty and healing and all these things but they're the servants of corruption now that man in particular might be a servant to money he might be a slave to the spirit of money love of money the the idol of money but yet through him not preaching against it allows those demons to sit there and yet the whole time he's promising them healing and all these blessings and all these good fortunes and good contracts and millions of dollars he's promising breakthroughs all these things but at the same time he's held in bondage to the spirit of fear because he won't preach the truth and that causes the rest of the church to be under the same spirit of fear or whatever spirit it is does everybody understand for the bible says for of whom a man has overcome the same as he had brought into bondage so in other words who whatever demon spirit we might give in to or anybody whatever spirit they give into now they're a slave to that spirit praise god whether it's lying if they give if they give into a lie and they don't make that lie right that spirit is going to make them lie again praise god right if they give in to lust and gets them to lust they don't repent they're going to lust again and they'll be a slave to it they'll never be free from it praise god but with jesus he brings the spirit of adoption amen and as a relationship we know father help me out i'm in need i'm your son the bible said if you ask for a fish god's a good god he's going to give you a fish and he said if you ask for the holy ghost god will give you the holy ghost amen highly do you know jesus said that they said if you ask for the holy ghost i'll give it to you did you know he said that okay let's read it yeah let's go to i think it's luke 11. i'm that's going off of memory here i hope this is right luke 11. we'll see if i should trust my memory here but i do believe uh jesus said the holy ghost will bring all things to your remembrance yeah there it is amen luke 11 11 praise god that's my number 11. praise god 11th hour worker 11th month i was born that's my number eleven eleven if a son shall ask brett of any of you that's a father will he give him a stone malcolm have you ever given you a stone when you ask for food lydia how about you see or if he ask a fish will he give for a fish would he give him a serpent now maokai likes to catch snakes but that's a different kind of serpent than we're talking about and the girls like i mean they all like nature so if you evil our sin nature know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him amen hallelujah so just look at look at a natural dad i give my children the best computers i can get them praise god i don't get the cheap ones i get the best ones amen i don't get the cheap food i get organic food many times praise god i don't give them the cheap enough i saw all the money i had i get in the cheap stuff but if i got a little extra i'm going to get the best and if i do that to my kids what about the heavenly father amen so if you're battling and you're struggling just call to god you have relationship with god god loves you he's your father and he'll give you victory hallelujah just ask him that's what the bible says that's why it's relationship you've got to say daddy father god be merciful deliver me from this lying spirit deliver me from this lust delivering me from this greed and don't you know god will do it amen it's relationship praise god and i've never seen it fail because the bible said in every temptation there's a way out amen in other words in every situation god's got a great gift to give you if you cry out to him for it praise god we're not to be slaves we're to be overcomers amen hallelujah now also all spirits are antichrist so someone say oh that antichrist spirit well really all are antichrist because antichrist means adversary right i looked at this a little bit on sunday he said little children it's the last time john said this you've heard that many antichrists i'm sorry that antichrist shall come that's speaking of the pope even now are there many antichrists look at this there's already many antichrists whereby we know that is the last time so he said you're looking for the pope but there's already a bunch of antichrist preachers out here so see any spirit we'd say is antichrist to some degree because it means adversary or opponent of jesus and jesus is the revealed word amen jesus is the revelation of god's word hallelujah he's the word made flesh praise god so all spirits bring bondage all demon spirits and all uh demons are antichrist in some degree or it's all yeah to full degree now you know i'm gonna just drop here uh lord uh stop here and come back here in just a moment i'm on 57. okay let me just go through this list here real quick church church i think it'll just help you uh hopefully to encourage you to read your bible here a little more you know i need we all need who needs more bible reading praise god we all need it i'm not bashing anybody i'm just saying we all need our bible reading more we got to choose instead of click on that we got to click on the bible praise god now look i just gone through i just spent a few hours studying on saturday and here's the actual names for demons that we're gonna have to overcome now the bible calls a spirit of divination which is like a sauce now this is what's on a lot of preachers today trying to predict the rapture right divination or familiar spirit now these may be the same but one kind of involves invoking the dead now that's actually getting in the tape church movement right where they actually think brother brown's marrying them the one the one song leader from jeffersonville was crying thanking god that their pastor brother branham was going to preach to them that night something wrong with that something is very wrong with that do you ever see the methodists do that say oh thank god john wesley is going to preach to us tonight you ever see them do that and that's that spirit is hanging right around the message see that's not it's not around the methodist anymore because god's moved past that that's denominated it's dead they have a name that they live but they're dead but satan hangs around the present truth and tries to deceive people out of that right spirit of jealousy we talked about that that's a demonic spirit remember on the van or the car we're talking about that that's a demonic spirit jealousy a lying spirit now see church these come up these will come upon us and we've got to cast them down and you can call them by name praise god and you can call them out say get behind you can say get behind me satan in the name of jesus christ you lying spirit get behind me i'm telling the truth praise god amen perverse spirit now that's what i got to study on a lot haughty's very simple pride a prideful spirit that's all over the message people today because if the devil can't get them with uh you know lust of the eyes lust of the flesh he's going to get him on the pride of life and that's what we got to be careful for too i'm going to preach i may get to that tonight actually i had in my notes i may get that tonight heaviness that's the depression spirit that's what the bible calls the spirit of depression is heaviness now you got a right church when you feel down you got a right to rebuke that spirit of heaviness and what the bible say you take off heaviness put on the take off heaviness and put on the garment of praise hey i didn't hear him praise god amen you got to put that on so i'm not putting on these mourners clothes and feel sorry put on a garment of praise amen put on your spiritual robe amen put on jesus righteousness and rejoice in it amen the bible says jesus made me righteous amen i know i failed but the bible says when i confess he's forgiving me and i put on new clothes i got white robes on i rejoice in his righteousness i can be glad because he loves me he forgive me he's empowering me and i'm clothed in his spirit praise god whoredoms this is a huge one brotherham said anything can be an idol i'll look at that maybe lord winning on sunday whoredom is a unlawful union so adultery or fornication unlawful union right and that's all idolatry is when someone bows down to a a wooden god or something like that that's all it is it's a religious it's a spirit of idolatry it's spiritual fornication and that's all over and remember people bow down to their jobs right they bow down to anything computers you know they bow down to alcohol if they worship that if they love that more they love jesus that's a spirit of whoredoms amen infirmities sickness any sickness that's covered 19 right there spear of infirmity right you could have got a right to speak to that demon deaf and dumb if it's a person's death or dumb got a right to speak to that spirit amen spirit of fear now we all battle that don't we right you got a right to speak to that spirit of fear rebuke it and say i have a spirit of power love and a sound mind a seducing spirit that's a deceiving spirit now that one's very closely associated to this one these may be the same church uh perverse and seducing spirit of air that may be the same one too the bible says we've not received the spirit of air we've received the spirit of truth amen and then israel has the spirit of blindness the bible says it's slumber they can't see that jesus a messiah because this evil spirit's on them and then the bible says unclean or foul spirit now that may be all as well if you read that every spirit is unclean in the eyes of god every demon spirit is foul in the eyes of god and so so all demons are probably spirits of bondage antichrist and the bible says the spirit of the world does that help okay now here here there's what we got we're not we're not left we're not you know we're not left with no weapons church we got plenty of weapons praise god there's a lot of demons out there but there's a great power in the holy ghost too amen hallelujah hallelujah there's more with us than with is than this with the devil praise god we got more angels we got more power i think we've got more attributes of the holy spirit we've got more weaponry praise god and our weapons aren't weak our weapons are mighty amen but how do you see them through your words amen you got to speak them you got to obey the word you got to uh you got to repent of sins obey the word your heart doesn't condemn you and you speak the word and god backs up his word amen so the bible says there's a holy spirit of wisdom which it's the same spirit just different powers that go along with it right different attributes of the same holy spirit there's a spirit of understanding we got i have all the scriptures for these spirit of judgment there's a spirit of burning that's a good one i want to end with that one if again there's a spirit of being humble or meekness that the holy spirit gives you there's a spirit of joy praising glory so see that's what we need that's what more message people need we need some joy praise god we should be happy that we're saved amen we should be thankful for all god's done there's a spirit of grace the bible says there's a spirit of supplication that's prayer for people there's a spirit of true spirit of power spirit of love sound mind there's this holy spirit of that there's a spirit of holiness there's a spirit of life there's a spirit of adoption spirit of faith spirit of promise spirit of revelation spirit of prophecy and there's also a fervent spirit as well and the church said amen church so i'm just kind of getting you ready for sunday lord willing if the lord tarries amen so if you need any of those you say lord send your spirit of revelation send your spirit of wisdom yeah brothers have a question fervent uh it's like uh actually i think the word is boiling so if it's boiling it's moving it's alive you know so if you have a fervent spirit it's like a active it's very active right so fervent is active i'd say diligent faithful okay busy busy for the lord a fervent it's alert yeah yeah okay that's pretty good by god's grace fervent spirit the bible said be fervent in your business as well like working at your job and you are you want to do that fervent okay now seeing all those demonic spirits and seeing the holy spirit we know we can get victory by the holy spirit over all those bondage spirits all those antichrist spirits are are not as powerful as god's holy spirit praise god now it's devil anointed preachers that bring the doctrines of devils remember we looked at this uh sunday we saw how they speak lies in hypocrisy they're conscious as a seared uh hot it's seared like a hot iron they don't even feel it anymore when they lie to people see they're just they're deceiving they're teaching demonic desires they lie as hypocrites they preach something but they don't live it they're like they're like uh actors in a play or on a movie they say one thing and that's not really what they that's not really their identity right they say they're a babe ruth or they say they're an actor some woman in a play but they're not they're somebody else they say they're helen keller but they're not helen keller they're acting about it they say they're a preacher but they're not a preacher right they say they're holy but they're not holy amen and their consciences are burned so they don't feel the effects of the lie anymore amen now remember this one a few months ago paul said the church in corinth was suffering because men bring them into bondage it's preachers church i hope your testimony is that through listening to our sermons you become free in the holy spirit i'm not trying to bring anybody into bondage i'm trying to bring you and i into obedience to the holy spirit praise god that should be your testimony amen i should be able to put a quote from every one of you on a postcard amen that says the holy spirit brought us into victory amen and if not come tell me why not praise god what's hindering the victory we got to pray more do we got a fast lord we got to repent what do we got to do jesus promised victory we should be victorious hallelujah so who brings people into bondage preachers that are false and got the wrong anointing if a man see man a man can devour can consume all the blessings that you have a preacher can take all the blessings that you had if they preach from the devil the anointing of the devil they can also take you the bible said if men take you he can seize all your possession so preacher come in he can take all your joy with something false right you could take all your victory with something false like brother william told me when i preached this about lukewarm i preached a little sermon on lukewarm fame brother and barry williams like that was such a wonderful message he said i've seen so many preachers when people come up for prayer he said they take the people's joy from them because they want to repent of something and the brother william said the preachers will stand there and say you're lukewarm you're lukewarm it's your fault and the people might be genuinely filled with the holy ghost and brother william said that people would leave all discouraged like i'm lukewarm i'm lukewarm when in all reality they were just maybe had some mind battles or they just had a complex it's not that because your soul can never be lukewarm amen your soul is sealed it's marked to the day of your redemption and first john 3 says that the seed of god remains in you and the seed of god cannot sin brother william said that was such a wonderful message and it was because it was the holy spirit it wasn't me it was the holy spirit but see but men see preachers if they're if they're all prideful they can take someone's victory and make them think they're not even born again when they might be now the opposite the opposite is denomination they make you feel with the holy ghost when you're not ah so see how we got to have the right spirit as preachers can we see that it's very important that we have as preachers the right spirit because we don't want to make a slave of you to anything except the word we don't want to take consume or devour or take your spiritual blessings we want to give you more praise god we're going to point you to more blessings because in other words i can't give it to you but i can point you to one who can that's christ jesus that man from galilee amen what does a man do a man exalt to himself that's what false preachers do they exalt themselves like they're somebody see i don't have a lot of confidence in a man who you never hear about his struggles all he preaches about how powerful he is how he never has he never can ever admit he's wrong i don't have any confidence in a man like that because brother branham wasn't that way brother brown was very humble and constantly admitted his failures before the people i'll be preaching on that lord willing a little bit and he said they also these preach preachers smite you they disrespect the congregation that's awful but that's how you know a man is anointed of the devil see he tries he takes he makes a slave of you to sin or a depression or something like that he take you lose all your joy lose all your victory uh he exalts himself he becomes a ruler over them and then he disrespects the people see antichrist people now let's look at three more doctrines on sunday we saw how the doctrine of the devil was forbidding people to marry in the catholic church now the opposite true today they allow you to marry anybody right second one was you can't eat meat and we saw that doctrine of the catholic church does the same thing during lent they call it lent is that what they call it okay they call it maybe that's what the protestants call but anyways the time leading up to easter they don't eat meat on friday so they eat fish which the bible calls meat so they're contradicting themselves okay uh now so those are two clear doctrines of devils so now one i want to say this too i forgot to say this on sunday see with that meat thing church it makes them feel more righteous than other people when they go buy fish they call them fish fries brother have you ever driven by you ever driven by like a restaurant around easter they say oh friday come in for fish it's fish fry day and they think the catholics and protestants they think they're more holy going to buy fish on friday than a hamburger because well we can't eat meat on friday but they are eating meat because fish is meat but they stand there and they think they're holier than you and church is not a contest to be holder than thou but it it's a reality that we're only holy by the word of god amen the word of god makes us holy because holy means separated amen they think they're separated because of their diet their natural diet we're separated by the spiritual diet amen jesus said you must eat my flesh and drink my blood amen he said these words are spirit and they are life and we're feasting on the word of god the reveal word of god and we have the right diet the spiritual diet praise god and they're making themselves feel more righteous but they're not amen that's why i didn't preach on sunday so i'm going to pour it in here amen i miss that i kind of forgot that see it's self-righteousness so they feel on one day they feel more righteous than you what a lie what a lie it's the blood of christ that makes us righteous not because you don't eat hamburger on friday ridiculous and eve and all they all they all teach that catholics and many protestants they all teach that like there's something about it makes you more holy it's nonsense that's the devil exalting their flesh making them prideful there it is amen prideful like they got more holiness because they never ate a hamburger on all fridays in in march and april may or march and april ridiculous people are ridiculous i should say people it's the devil's making them ridiculous not the people i'm not against the people i'm against the system praise god i got to make sure help me lord amen now here's yeah here's the third the third doctrine is this the rapture's already passed and we're in the tribulation or millennium now here's the context paul says preachers paul says timothy study yourself approved be a workman that you're not ashamed of what you're preaching rightly dividing the word of truth shun profane and vain babblings though increase in the moral godliness and their word will eat as death a canker a cancer right a flesh-eating disease of whom is hymeneous and felidas he names the two preachers that are preaching false doctrine who concerning the truth have heir saying that the resurrection is passed already in overthrow they destroy the faith of some by claiming the rapture has already happened or the lord's already come and we're in the millennium or we're in the tribulation that destroys people's faith and they'll live any old way they want because they think well the lord's already come he's already here if the lord was here you know it praise god if the lord was here he'd be done with the days of man amen the lord is here the days of man is over and the lord's day would come amen and he take that rod of iron brother austin he slammed it on the ground he said it's now the lord's name and a thousand years of peace amen all these satanic rulers would be cast out and christ would be king hallelujah amen i think the lord's day the lord doesn't come yet he's come by the holy ghost baptism in the soul he's come by the open book of the revelation of the word of god which is only the baptism of the holy ghost he's come in the fullness and the baptism of the holy ghost but he's not come physically and he's not coming any other way other than the revelation of the word of god that was prophesied we're waiting for that corporal body we'll meet that corporate body in the air amen that's the coming of the lord hallelujah but to say it's already happened is the demonic spirit doctrine of a devil it will overthrow it will knock over people's faith where they lose their faith in christ now here that's what satan did with this 1977 prediction brother branham as a preacher every preacher has the liberty to make a prediction but the devil took this prediction and really overthrew a lot of people's faith people that don't know the difference between a prediction and uh a prophecy right remember there's three reasons brother bran felt inspired to say 77 he said the seventh jubilee was in 1977. uh or 1977 was 201 years after 1776 no democracy would last over 200 years he said or he thought by history and uh it was also the the fulfillment of 1954 years for gentiles so he thought it was inspiring now look what he put in the church book and look how the devil deceived people with this so i repeat i sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the word along with divine inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate the world systems and usher in the millennium there's message churches in southern ohio near dayton that believe we're in the millennium and their pastor calls himself the eighth messenger in ohio i tell there's some bad things in ohio but there are some good things too amen there's some good churches in ohio too hallelujah there's some bad ones but there's some good ones hallelujah and see where do they get that how can we how can this be a thousand years of peace because they misunderstand this quote right they don't take this back to the word they don't understand that a prediction is not the same see brother man saw three things all appointed the same year so i thought that's really inspired okay but that's where we get this idea so that same spirit that was that same uh canker amen that same flesh eating disease that was here in paul's day saying the rapture's already passed is here today it's still here trying to tell people the rapture has already happened we're in the tribulation period well it's closer to the tribulation prayer than the millennium but it's neither it's neither here's a fourth doctrine that i've heard in the message no fasting jesus said his children would fast after his physical body left the earth fasting improves your health if you wanted to see that it's isaiah 28 i'm sorry 58. it restores your health fasting does and paul fasted often jesus said how come john's disciples fast often and your disciples don't fast he said can the children of the bride chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bright when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then shall they fast so see jesus body isn't here that's why we still fast and the church said amen here's a fifth doctrine now it's the once saved always saved doctrine or it's the everyone will be saved doctrine where do you get this it's from jude 1 4 says this is not true for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation so there's men that were ordained to go to hell and they crept into the church slowly slowly i think i said this a few years ago i've watched different people coming to church usually after six months or a year they're going to show their colors usually now some it's a lot a little longer but most people are the ones that have tried to uh throw me off or whatever usually within six months or a year and some hang around three or four years but usually within that time they creep in real slowly they get your good graces you know they make friends but then pretty soon they try to bring out a lie they try to bring in a doctrine they try to influence me in a certain a certain kind of a way they creep in real slow at least you got to watch people watch people's lives and we're learning we're learning as yours as years go on we learn by god's grace and you everybody will if you really love god you'll learn to try to catch their spirit like for example how come this person never comes up to for prayer the church that's that's it's not required to come up for prayer but there's we had people come here for years never came up for prayer and now they've left the message and they called brother branham a false prophet and they never came up for prayer one time in five to ten years they were here not one time i never saw them say amen to one word i preached see so we're catching little things there other people they'd always miss service when family visited them from out of town and they'd skip church for family that was a big clue that god wasn't number one in their lives hallelujah look at you guys doing a good job look at that family visits and you're always in the house of god that's awesome that's what i did when my family comes they want to come that's fine but i'm leaving sunday you can sleep in do whatever you want but i'm gone i'll see you on sunday night because god is number one in my life amen but give it a six months or a year amen or three years four years give it some time they're gonna creep in slowly and what they do in jude's day jude was jesus's natural brother now of course it wasn't natural but he was born by the same mom and dad he said these evil men will change the grace they'll turn the grace of god into lasciviousness which means unbridled lust i can never say that one either outrageousness shamelessness insolence in other words just live however you want god's given you grace you can live however you want you're still going to heaven that's a lie that's a doctrine from hell the bible says because men that are going to hell brought it into the church right so that's why you watch those people that say once saved always save you watch them you watch them now let me balance this out now listen once saved always saved is true for every wise virgin because they are predestinated to eternal life but only god knows the future even the wise virgins don't because you're not god i'm going gonna say it again you're not god so you church believe with all your heart you're predestinated but you cannot ever prove it you can't pull out a card and say look i got a card from heaven see says i was saved before the foundation world my name's on the last book of life i'll never fall away you you don't have that there's no proof but let me say it like this your life is proof amen you can't prove it of anything you say anything you can produce but your life will prove which side you're standing on amen hallelujah now also to balance that out the same foolish virgins will always be saved but the difficult thing is this is what i was talking with the brother of this week the difficult thing to understand is that the group like judas is scared were once saved in the foolish virgin group but then they rejected salvation jesus said he brought their names out of the book of life if they didn't overcome so that's why i made this chart jesus said there's four groups there's four kinds of soil the wise virgin have good soil they're the wise versions though their names can never be blotted off the foolish versions their names remain because they were virgin to the word but here this group is a group that their names were written on the book of life but they're blotted out due to their sins like judas so these people used to be in here but then their names are blotted off so but in god's eyes these once saved were always saved in god's eyes are you with me that's a little deeper there it's because well brother jesse i thought you said that once they don't always save isn't right it's not because it doesn't work here but it does work in god's eyes amen hallelujah praise god we don't know who's saved we can't prove it other than our lives does everybody understand and these names were never written on the book of life like pharaoh they never had faith in god they never trusted in god ever but this group the stony ground the jesus said they believe for a while but when the hot sun a persecution or offenses come upon them they wither away and they leave the faith and they believe for a while but they don't believe unto the saving of the soul hallelujah we have four minutes i can't believe that man oh and i'm a little bit i'm happy i'm happy i'm joyful praise god i'm joy i'm joyful now brother this is why i say this only god knows because brother graham said plainly he couldn't prove he was a wise virgin by his own by any human efforts but the ram said when god puts a name on the lamb's book of life before the foundation world there's not nothing in the world can rub it out because this wrote in the ink of the blood of christ so see in that case in god's eyes one saved is always saved in god's eyes he says all children all the church everything there is god by his four knowledge now we now look at this now everybody say we don't know ready let's say ready we don't know we don't know god knows we don't know we've had many people come to our church we thought we're saved filled with the holy ghost and we find out after a while they're not because they love the world more they love the word of god they take antichrist spirits they take prideful spirits and fight against the very message that save them now we don't know you say brother ben can you prove you're there can you prove your names on the lamb's book of life everybody say what does that say yes or no no can i prove to you my name's on the book of life no i can't prove it to you but what's he say i cannot prove it god could use me a tool for something else and you the same way but i believe and the church said but i believe and by faith by faith i am saved amen not by knowledge i'm saying by faith that's the way you're saved that's the way we're all saved hallelujah in other words the bible says always keep the profession of your faith hallelujah like we said never cast away your confidence that you're saying never say you're lost never say uh i'm backslidden you know if you if you can never say i'm uh uh i'm uh i'm not god's child always confess the word of god and church if you speak it and you believe it your body will have to obey your confession yes brother yes because faith is an action faith is a faith is a trust and it's an action yes faith is an action word it's a verb because the bible says by faith abraham left uh the land and possessed the promise of god by faith moses uh chose to suffer with the children of god rather than live with in egypt with all the pleasures of egypt it's by faith faith is an action because the only way i know your faith is to watch your works the bible says faith without works is dead okay every got that that's a good question brother good question because the bible says how can this how can this be true once saved always say when the bible said shall we continue in sin that grace can get greater god forbid in other words don't keep sinning so that well now god's grace is greater now no how shall we now look here's the key right there the people that leave are not dead to their self they're not dead to the world they still love the world amen how are we that are dead to sin live any longer therein if you really love jesus you can't live for sin because sin is what crucified jesus right sin is what took his life so you don't live for sin you're dead to sin and you're you're alive to jesus's life you're alive to truth you're alive to the spirit of god you're alive to the things of god how can you live in sin when you're dead to it amen to come to christ is to die to sin if they know if they never die to sin that's the trouble we've seen brothers people that say they come to christ they if they've never died to sin if they still have sin they've never died to christ and so they've never been saved now is it possible they could have died to sin and got saved and then lose it yes that's what judas did he was justified sanctified but he sold it out and took the bible says satan possessed him satan entered into judas that's a tough pill to swallow but that's the truth church you can in other words you can make it all you can leave egypt make it all the way up to the canaan's land but then turn around and deny it same thing now what's the bible say church the bible says we must perfect holiness in the fear of god there's my 45 minutes let me finish here i didn't get to where i want to go that's good the bible says follow holiness and peace with all men without which no man shall see the lord and then the bible says you can fail the grace of god see how that evil spirit comes in there and says oh everyone's saved once i was saved i'm always saved i can live however i want that's a demonic devil a doctrine of a devil if you just said one prayer i don't care how much you sin you're always saved that's a lie people can lose the anointing of god we saw that on sunday let everyone that names the name of christ depart from a life of iniquity leave that sinful life and every man that is pure everyone that has the hope of seeing jesus in him he purifies himself so brother sister that's what we got to do look at ourselves tonight and say lord make me more pure it's not easy all the time we might not want to feel like it all time but we've got to get in a place of surrender to christ where we can surrender to the holy spirit and let him make us more pure every time we come together amen so now we got five doctrines of devils plainly celibacy vegetarian diet they mandate you know the catholics the rapture is passed no fasting and they turn god's grace into lawlessness everyone's going to heaven once you're saved and say a prayer you're always going to be saved no matter how you live that's a lie and how do they preach it they preach it it's so deceptive it sounds so good what kind of loving god would save somebody than lose them well i'll tell you the kind of loving god that would save judas but then let him let him choose to go away god ain't going to force anybody to go to heaven right that's a loving god that will let you come part of the way and then he loves you enough to give you your free choice to leave him if you want to leave him that's a loving god he won't force you into his presence for eternity unless you want to but then it's not a force right it's not a force it's a freemore agency [Music] okay let me see i better stop here yeah i better stop i'll get to this sunday so part three lord winning we'll look at all these lies coming out of so-called message churches they call themselves but they're not when they preach great swelling words of vanity and they contradict the word of god it's a lie it's a doctrine of the devil let's stand on our feet and i'm going to close with these scriptures let's stand our feet i'm going to try to give you my word here that's out of the book of second peter it's kind of what i said earlier see the false preachers speak great swelling words of vanity so in other words great words that are meaningless like they make these huge promises to you musicians can come but they're meaningless promises and the bible says it's actually uh alluring them or tempting them through the lust of the flesh and through laziness uh those that were clean escaped from them who live in air and see they promised them all these things but they themselves are the servants of corruption okay so all these great things oh god loves you so god i love you no matter what if you're homosexual not god love you that's a great swelling word of vanity you can lie cuss steal cheat and and you're gonna go to heaven no matter what nonsense or like this one god wants to heal you every time that's totally against the bible you'd be surprised how many people believe that these great swelling words here's what i'm going to say right here is the live stream still on can this be the last thing i see here's what i'm going to share these great swelling words like this like when when the laodicean church goes to heaven everybody's going to come up and we're going to be the celebrity of heaven you know people preach that like everybody's going to oh paul and peter are going to run up to us and say how did you make it you're so great that's a lie that's a great swelling word like look at it i've heard many preachers preach it they even got a song about it it's just this great swelling words of pride it's vanity church there's only one person that we're going to be running to in heaven amen there's only one person i mean worshiping now we might run and greet one another right but there's one person we're gonna worship there's one person that everyone's gonna admire amen that is jesus christ the son of god amen the son of righteousness hallelujah that's a great swelling word of vanity it puffs up the people and i've seen it it makes them lazy it's turning grace into lasciviousness exalting us when the brother and then and then brother abraham even said god didn't say hardly anything good about the laodicean church age except that there were some a few people that were on fire amen praise god i tell you we're not going to be the celebrity of heaven jesus christ is the celebrity of heaven it's pride that's one example now you can stop the live stream god bless you i'm closing with this here just for the saints i'll preach more on this on sunday
