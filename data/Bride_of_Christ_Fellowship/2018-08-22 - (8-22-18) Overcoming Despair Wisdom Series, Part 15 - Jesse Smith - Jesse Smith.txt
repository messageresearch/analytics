[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] chapter 2 I could pick up on the wisdom series tonight it's been a few quite a few weeks since we looked at this so to Ecclesiastes chapter 2 verse 10 last time we preached on this was back in July actually July 4th we looked at Parliament or Tom and Solomon's five W's so please use chapter 2 verse 10 so they had a subtopic in the overcoming despair overcoming despair because we'll see after Solomon tries chasing these five W's and fails and he's overcome with despair and so we know what comes or we know what overcomes despair that's the Holy Spirit by God's grace yeah amen and that Holy Spirit of course manifest in different ways we'd say different fruits of the spirit like love joy peace gentleness goodness long-suffering all nine fruits of the Holy Spirit but I want to see this here tonight I trust to be a blessing to everybody so he's a sees chapter 2 verse 10 I think I'll read to verse 17 I'm going to read for most of this here and what's up for mine eyes desired I kept not from them I was held not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced and all my labor and this was my portion of all my labor then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labor that I laboured to do and behold all this was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no profit under the Sun and I turned myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly for what can the man do that cometh after the king even that which has been already done and I saw that wisdom excel at folly as far as light Excel with darkness The Wise Man's eyes are in his head but the fool walketh in darkness and I myself perceived also that one event happens happeneth to them all then said I my heart has it happened to the fool so I happened this even to me and why was I then more wise than I said in my heart that this is also vanity but there's no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten and how die at the wise demand as the fool therefore listen to this scripture therefore I hated life because the work that is raw under the Sun was Grievous unto me for all his vanity and vexation of spirit that's quite a statement how can a man who saw Jesus or God twice how could he say hate in life it would have had to been a tremendous backslide for a man that saw God twice and God gave him everything he possibly wanted would had been a tremendous fall away from God or someone like that to hate life let's not word a prayer here that's asked God to help us overcome despair Heavenly Father we love you today we thank you for your mercy we read your word Lord written by the as we'd say the second wisest man outside of you dear God your son Jesus Christ bless this word out to us Lord and help us to see Lord how Lord things of the world are so frivolous there's they have no value Lord God and how Lord we must keep our hearts of mind zealous for the Word of God yes we must learn not that anything come come between us and our Savior your God hallelujah may we seek after you Lord all the days of our life in Jesus Christ's name and everybody said amen may be seated here let's take this thoughts here so I like to look at this thought here tonight of overcoming despair I can't hear everybody on the livestream but if I said how many could raise your hand or say Amen to you ever if you've ever battled despair I wondered how many amens we get in other words hopelessness I think we all have yet we really have when we look at it eternally we have no reason to be hopeless but we're human and and we go through battles we go through trials that allows the enemy to test us and so we go through times of hopelessness or times of despair and we want to look at the Word of God tonight as it relates to to Solomon and and then see why he went through this and then by God's grace we already as we said earlier we know what the answer was going to be we needed a coach to walk to the Holy Spirit my god that's great so we need a genuine repentance is what we need by God's grace no I just want to review part 14 we looked at the five W's Solomon tried everything he tried why in Chapter he tried Burke's in chapter 2 verse 4 he verse 7 in Chapter 7 he tried women and we know of course in the kings as well says he had three hundred wives and seven hundred concubines so if anybody tried women if anyone tried relationships and was Solomon and then he tried human wisdom in Ecclesiastes chapter one and twelve verse 12 because he said the Bible said he read so much that much study was weirdness to his flesh so Solomon tried so hard he read so many books to try to get smarter wiser that he got worn out so he tried the five W's and who knows the the one w he was missing the word the word so he tried five W's those were all those were all worldly worldly wisdom worldly wine and works and all these things he just needed the anointed war effort beginning of his life but he must have walked and he left him hungry for the things of the world so much so that he built an altar to every false God of all of his wives which could have been you know scores of altars or hundreds of altars it doesn't really say but the Bible said he didn't build one to every false god so he appeared to him twice the first time he appeared in first Kings three and then the second time in first Kings nine he appeared now remember Ecclesiastes is written at the end of his life because he says this is the conclusion of all my life searching in Chapter 12 and then in in Proverbs Solomon is the one giving the advice because he's freshly anointed with the Holy Spirit he has lots of thoughts about God's wisdom and understanding but here at the end of his life he's reflecting and he's writing all of his his his regrets all the things that he did he wishing that would not have done now in Chapter one we saw that vanity he said everything is vanity or fleeting it doesn't mean it's worthless because if you did most of us would not say yesterday's meals were worthless where they worthless no but they were fleeting the joy of them is our the the tastiness of them as tasty as they could have been we're fleeting so everything is not useless but everything is fleeting in this life except Jesus Christ aren't you glad to know that Christ is your lasting hope Christ is your eternal hope Christ is your eternal reward even aim ahead and he will never get old you can never like brother Hanson you can never tired in that place he said you can never get upset you you could never get fearful you can never get discouraged you never get depressed you can never get hopeless it's perfect love it's perfect hope he said sublime it's beyond sublime he said you just arrived when you get to heaven you heart you've just arrived Amen you're just there and it's just it's all that you could think of and then more beyond that so not everything I'm sorry so things everything is sleeting everything is short-lived but it's not useless it is there is value to it it is worthwhile for the moment but it's not gonna last eternally except eternal life now Solomon said there's nothing new Under the Sun in Chapter one and then in Chapter one he begins searching and found that all these things were a vexation a spear or a longing or striving they were just lot of striving work is such a such a striving is such a a job you know it's such a never-ending job always you can never you can never feel like you get caught up and you say man if you want have you worked and done a job very rarely do I ever feel like I got caught up just because there's not enough time there the jobs and needs are so great you hardly feel like you get caught up and then he talks about worldly wisdom and ends the chapter with that and we found out how I love this from Jane let's go to James chapter 3 let's just kind of review this real quick James chapter 3 verse let's go to 17 James 3:17 because this will remind us again to recognize and this is where it's so crucial for us to recognize when we are using the wisdom of God like let's say we have a decision about a job or no decision about where we live or if we have a decision about who to spend time with if we have a choice between different ones spend time how do we know it was the wisdom of God here's how you know verse 17 but the wisdom that is from above is first let's all say it is first pure then let's all say it then and let's say the next one it's gentle and easy to be entreated now entreated as easily compliant or easily of obey because God's words are easiest as burden is light amen and then they're full of what full of and good without partiality without hypocrisy so there's no pretending with the wisdom of God when you really act on the wisdom of God you notice to pretend you know to pretend like you like somebody you know what to pretend like you're enjoying yourself are you don't to pretend like you're happy you have to pretend like you're peaceful you actually are you're anointed by the Holy Spirit and you feel pure before God Amen in your mind right because our soul is always sealed it's unchanging Satan's sealed out God sealed it but in your mind you will feel the peace of God you will feel the purity of God the gentleness of God the obedience or compliance to God you will feel mercy the good fruits and no totally trans to put on or pretend to be feeling anything you'll have God's anointing on you amen so that's the wisdom of God so I hope that helps if you know so now you can recognize we can all recognize in our lives when the wisdom of God has been expressed we feel pure there's peace there's gentleness everything seems to be going well now in Chapter two at the beginning Solomon decides I did a test out pleasure I'm gonna try mirth or pleasure and then he goes through three of the W's in Chapter two and then we ended at the third W wealth and we found that the real treasure was the wisdom of God or the Holy Ghost that's the real treasure of God now let's pick up in verse 10 so let's do read 10 11 and 12 attack I'm sorry Cleese II asked these two ten eleven twelve what sort of my eyes desired I can't not from them which I was held not my part from any joy my heart rejoice in all their labor and this was my portion of all my labor then I looked on all the works on my hands I'm wrong on the labor that I had labor to do behold I was vanity and vexation is here and there was no profit under the Sun I turned myself to be what wisdom and madness and folly what can the man that do come after the King even that which has been already done a man no think about this the man with the most money in the kingdom he could ride down Main Street I think about writing down what shopping place would we go to the most amazing shopping place we could go to what was it Columbus okay we're American girl an apple store can you imagine driving through there and anything you wanted you could have Solomon could have driven through there he said I'll take that watch I'll take that vehicle right get all the money I'll take this I think that was close I'll take those toys I go a lego store I'll take the whole thing anything is I looked at he got it and it still didn't make him happy and the church said Amen things we see things that natural possessions are not going to make us happy and he proved it he sought out all the joy all the pleasure and then he got excited when he finished building something he rejoiced in all his Labor's look what I've done look what I've done I've dug a brand new canal or something or I've known all this irrigation or anything that he built he rejoiced in it they probably had riots ceremonies where they all clapped with the governors and the mayors of the halle clapping they're all dressed up and they all look you know so so pristine or so so handsomer or pretty but he said eventually this all became vanity or vexation he failed to be happy but it wasn't because he didn't try he tried to be happy by all the possessions doing all the great works but it didn't make him happy and then he said well what can I do that the previous King David my father or even Saul what can I do that they didn't do they won battles they built things they leave no palaces kingdoms all these things what can I do what can the king do that hasn't been done before right what can what can the current president do that hasn't already been done before so he thought he found all this hopelessness in this now let's read verse 13 that he can read thirteen now here's the truth so after all this work he sees that that wisdom goes so beyond folly it's so much more beneficial to be wise then spend your time in foolish things okay verse fourteen but they're doing a report to the wise man's eyes are in his head but the full walketh in darkness and I myself perceived also that one event happened happiness to them all amen so he sees that death is the one event that happens to everyone verse 15 then said I my heart as it happened to the fool so what happened is even to me why was I then the more wise I said my heart that this is also vanity then verse 16 he talks about how there's no remembrance of anyone now that's not true right because we still remember great men like George Washington and the Abraham Lincoln and other great men and women especially when they read books right when the children read books they can really remember Malachi sorry about great General Lee like to read about that's a real person okay the founding fathers that's right and then science and learn about different people in science the science field too so so again he's just making a generalization he's so discouraged he's making a generalization like no one is remembered or but that's not true all the way who who were remembering tonight which keynote remembering Sullivan we're remembering dim there is a remembrance now maybe not into every single day we don't remember maybe Solomon but every day we do remember the King of Kings the Lord Jesus Christ every day we remember that King of Kings so see he's just kind of overwhelmed with discouragement and we're going to see depression happen next I look at verse 14 I'm sorry verse 17 this is one of the most striking verses in the chapter he says therefore I hated life now pause there how could you hate life when you could drive down Main Street and get everything you wanted or have as many husbands or wives as you can possibly how could you hate life but this is the result of sin and this is the result of trying to fill that god-shaped hole with something other than God and it proves it no matter how much money no matter how much you can do or possess or how the great works you can do everybody has a god-shaped hole in their heart that needs to be filled by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then when you get that and you experience true joy they even for that you just got to keep the mind battles keep victory over the my battles to keep casting down all this and then when you get back in God's presence that you just rejoice and you thank God that you have eternal life abiding in you way men thank you Jesus so he hated life this is so contrary to what Jesus said because Jesus says he says the thief cometh not but to steal kill and destroy but I am coming to might have it more abundantly but half a thing had come to Solomon had stolen some of his his joy it stolen his hope it stolen his peace it stole his wisdom he left when he compromised on God's Word he let Satan steal his true is them the word wisdom let Satan steal his peace and his it is his hope and all these things because he started compromising with his wives and remember that's when I even preached on Sunday a little bit once in you stopped moving on with God just like akin once in but bringing one cent into your house makes you stop moving on with God and just like Israel they can never get any more victories until they got the sin out of the camp amen so that's what we must recognize as well if we see our lives not getting victory and we're not seeing prayers answered and we're not saying out ourselves overcoming things if we see ourselves becoming slaves to discouragement or to sins or the lust of the flesh then we realize something's wrong we we're instead of getting victorious we're getting beaten we're not supposed to get beaten we're supposed to get better we're supposed to get better as a Christian not get beaten and kicked around and so that's the principle of God and we see it that's the principle of a soldier if you're not winning the battle you're actually losing and you're not getting closer you're getting further away because remember the Bible says in Philippians 4:4 rejoice in the Lord sometimes no rejoice in the Lord always and again I say rejoice so it's a victory that we've got to keep on top of so we should hasten and not hate the gift of life that God has given to us got a given Salman a precious life a blessed life he had all the blessings he could actually even hope for and he says I hate it I just you know we have a hard time wrapping our minds around that well that's that's reality he had every single thing he could ever want it imagine Haven heaven every horse you could possibly want but even if you did guess what you know it wouldn't fulfill your heart right just like Daddy I could have every computer or phone and I bet that I could possibly have but that still wouldn't make me happy the only thing that makes you happy is the love of Christ everything else is gonna fall short although we what we need we want things like this it's okay to like horses right it's okay to get the new phone or if you need something better as long as it's not lustful you know and greedy but that's not the point of our life the point of our life is to do what God has called us to do now verse 18 here's where we see more uncertainty so that when sin starts growing and keeps growing in a lot is life it leads to increased uncertainty or increased fear and he's worried about things he cannot control remember jesus said don't worry about your food don't worry about your clothes don't worry about your life he said that God clothes the grass if God closed the birds with feathers isn't he gonna close with you as well isn't gonna close me oh ye of little faith so you're here in verses 18 to 23 we see how Solomon is in despair so let's have our readers again read Malachi 3 18 and 19 he said be a wise man or a fool yes I'm here rule over all my labor and I have labored and where I shouldn't mr. wise into the Sun it's also Spanish Wow even says I hate all these things that I built because I don't even know if the person after me is going to take care of it right and I can relate to that we just you know did this construction down here and if I'm not careful I can worry I wonder if my children are gonna take care of it after I'm old or not you know you could just worry about silly things like that or about your car well I just got this car I wonder is there even my turnery we're going to take care of it I wonder if it's even gonna be taken care of just wondering about things and coming to the spot where he hated going to work we shouldn't hate going to work we should enjoy going to work we should enjoy what God has called us to do and do it as we're doing it unto God Salomon lost that sight he got his eyes off the things of God and he started to hating even his work she said hey Lydia can you read 20 and 21 thank you I went about to close my heart to despair all the labor under the Sun there is a manual labor is not an equity get two men that have not labored therein shall we meet [Music] also is vanity okay there simply was 18 I'm Tigers 19 I'm sorry no it was worse I thought it was verse 20 caused my heart to despair of all the labor who caused his heart to despair himself who causes you and I to get hopeless ourselves we let the devil go try to try it we let the devil convince us so there's no hope there's no use why even try right and what does he try and it was like in that story of a certain I'd the splendid way all same just trying to do is to get us to put down our sword so stop fighting he doesn't want us to keep chopping away at all and his own all his lies and all his demon powers right you would just just lay down our sword and just take it easy and lay down our shield that he didn't shoot very darts of sin darts he wants you to just sit down your your sword and shield and just just take it easy that's what happened here to Solomon he stopped fighting the good fight of faith and we've got us we've got to keep fighting we've got to be those who will fight remember when David didn't go out to battle what happened a sin with Bathsheba happening he should have been out there with the king with the Kings right with all the people he shooting out there battling right because it is about battles it is about overcoming st. it is about driving back the kingdom of Satan and making the kingdom of God move on or grow it is about that so Solomon was worried about things he can't control and he caused his own heart to despair does that remind you of job job caused his own heart to fear okay the RAM said that's in job 325 for the thing which I feared greatly is come upon me and in that which I am afraid of is come unto me brother Branham said job draw all those things upon it so the loss of his family the loss of his Anne the loss of his his property the loss of his health he brought all that on because he would sit there wonder he would fear I wonder God's the best I wonder if I'm gonna lose it all he just wouldn't worry about it and so just like Joe brought that upon himself by worried by being so scared so did Solomon bring this despair hopelessness upon himself who's your biggest enemy yourself yourself we leave me we can't let the bars on we can't let our our sword on it's okay saying not I won't find a job i won't i won't rebuke you anymore we've gotta just be like satan get behind me satan right maybe just like jesus get behind me Satan I rebuke you a name that's what we have to do we have to keep fighting keep driving him back remember because Jesus drove him back three times what he got tempted and what the Bible say Satan left him for our season how many one enjoy a season of little little temptations and trials you've got to drive him back though you gotta fight him three times in a row drive him back it's written it's written it's written and then you'll have a little season of rest by the grace of God Jillian we call those mountaintop experiences hallelujah with Solomon was not he let down his sword he let down his shield and he entered and he caused himself to despair he caused himself to be hopeless and this thought came to me I don't know if I preaches you it or not but yeah I think I did but I want to say it again this is why people many people commit the suicide because it's just a perversion of the real desire that I share that Lydia my own kinda sure that wasn't because the real desire is I don't want my own will to live anymore that's the real desire in other words I want my own fleshly desires to die right walls that I die once a week on Sunday I die daily right so the real the real desire is I'm so I'm so hopeless and helpless of my own ability I've got to crucify my own desires that Christ might live in me amen does everybody see that but see Satan perverts that and makes it oh it's so hopeless just end your life but Jesus said you've got to lose your life to find it amen so it's different so st. Robertson says end your natural light you know to end your natural life but Jesus says and your spiritual desires your evil spiritual desires and desire the things of God that you can actually live that's how you actually live crucifying what you were to do and obey the Word of God amen that's truly living so we have to keep the devil's off us keep fighting by the Word of God and by prayer amen so Solomon was no longer content with just living before God he was caring too much about his earthly works and what would happen to them why would he worry you know an honest church why does it really matter what's gonna happen after we die what is it really matter as long as we served on while we're alive that's all that counts here's the Bible's that we live once and then the judgment right name Hebrew says that so we don't even worry about who cares at this house gets ruined afterward who cares what happens to the car they're just tools right now so I can serve Jesus Christ I'm gonna use them to glorify Jesus Christ I'm never gonna put them above Christ I'm gonna put them under Christ and let them be used to glorify the name of the Lord whatever job or whatever you do whatever tells you everything is under Christ Christ is number one and everything else is just under that we never let them greater and I did 18 19 20 21 for the air 222 823 I think it's more the same for what half man of all his labor and of the vexation of his heart wherein he have labored under the Sun for all his days or sorrows and his trivial grief yay his heart taketh not rest in the night this is also vanity all right now Solomon gets so hopeless or depressed that he says all of man's days are sorrows now stop and think he had so many days where he said I had everything my eyes one was every one of his day sorrow nobody so depressed he's making these exaggerations have you ever exaggerated and said boy today was just an awful day and maybe it really wasn't that awful or that I had you all the work I've heard I've heard by myself or you always do this or you always say that when really that's not a waste you see how we all get discouraged sometimes that's what we know that's probably a good idea for us to our children too it's and me too it's a good it's a good kind of indicator that we're kind of getting hopeless or helpless when we start exaggerating and they get sue Michael I'm the only one who does this room I do all the work I'm the only one or exaggerated Salman was exaggerating think of all the children Salman had but that was that was that sorrow deaf children no think of his first wedding was out of sorrow no what about Jews that were faithfully serving God what about cross a life that got converted into Judaism would those be days of sorrow no so see he's so discouraged he's so he's so hopeless he's so backslidden that all he does is exaggerate and he fails to see all the good days in his life that's why I love Facebook cuz I get to see her - all remember this day oh brother when we did that remember when Malachi got baptized and liddy indication and name that's how I like to see those memories pop up because it reminds me of all the glorious days I don't put bad days on Facebook but we must remember that and Salah was so depressed he said a man's heart cannot rest in the night he's just generalizing he stereotyping because that's that's not what he said in proverbs 3:24 so in Ecclesiastes - he's saying you can't sleep and then proverbs 3:24 he says thou shalt lie down and I sleep she'll be sweet so in Proverbs he said all I'm sleeping and sweet and then in Cleese a sees he's like I never get any sleep so see what happens see see the effects of sin you go from enjoying life loving life loving God excited about God - everything's hopeless everything's useless what good is it to do this what good is it to do to make it better to wear better clothes what good is it to make your house better because you're depressed because that's the spirit right it's an evil spirit instead of being full of life you're full of death so hope you can see this could everybody see is it pretty clear mmm see how clear it is this man is so Baxton the wisest man is so backslidden he's not using wisdom anymore he's totally rejected the wisdom God gave him remember jesus promised to give rest so some would say there's no rest but Jesus was gonna give him a hope amen he said come unto me all that labor and heavy laden and I will give you rest amen that was a thousand years before Christ that's not a thousand years after Solomon that Christ said that so all those all those men you know they got tired they got simple they got worn out and they back slid all these things and but Jesus coming he's coming to tell you now when they give you rest into your soul it's here and it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that is the rest to your soul your soul doesn't have to be a hopeless tonight doesn't have to feel helpless our souls don't have to be in despair because the Holy Ghost gives us hope amen hallelujah he said take my yoke upon you take my burden learn of me I'm meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light hallelujah now Solomon he kind of comes to himself in verse 24 so Lydia can read 24 alright so he sees eating eating with your family fellowship are from the hand of God and we should thank God for that now we often take that for granted don't we because if we've never had tragedy strike our homes I think about families that have had they've lost children they've lost husbands wives they've lost people so close to them and they feel the pain of eating together and not having someone there but soliders trying to remind us make sure every meals that you remember is a gift from God make sure the times when brother Aaron bring food over on Wednesday night make sure you enjoy it's a gift from God and they sure like the ribs that's me that's a gift from God now we're not pressuring you do that every time we never pressure anybody but just the fact that our family is together and we're happy we're healthy we're not dying in the hospital praise God you know thank God yesterday I saw Kylie Rose and her hair's getting so long and she said thank you for the letter by the way and I just I cried what I said every time dying from cancer or prayed for you and so she ends her for a year we prayed and fasted one day a couple days for her I think two two times I think he prayed and fasted for her those who could and it's just it's so it's so enjoyable and she told her mom she said as soon as she was in the hospital she saw an angel and then she told her mom and she said that man mr. Smith he's really close to God and she didn't know nothing about it she doesn't know nothing about the message reason which she consents and she was my student she can sense that God is with us amen and so see these are gifts from God just the ability to have for her family to have Kylie Rose at lunch that's it you forgot to eat supper as a family that's a gift from God we should cherish every moment praise the Lord amen did you know brother Branham said we don't know what value is and he said what's value Oh guys did you know if I had a hundred million dollars laying it on me he said I had a little button here and if I press this button I lose my hundred million dollars but I get to talk with my old dad that's dead and gone on for one hour as a mortal being again what would I do what would you do think about someone who who's not here you can't talk to my brother James Brown think about anyone that we've lost and you had a hundred million dollars or a button if you press the button the money falls through the floor but then your loved one is there and you get the talk thing for one out which one whether we have said no hesitation I press the button amen hmm I give a hundred million dollars this morning to sit my dad down in this chair I teach this lesson my creech he said but what's money worth how much more is a soul than money hey man thinking about that a hundred million or button for one hour he said I do in a heartbeat that's the value of at the time that we have together that's the value so we don't want to take it for granted the Bible said godliness with contentment is a great game and contentment means a perfect condition of life in which no aid or support is needed I don't need anything that's contentment I don't need your help I don't need anyone's support I've got everything I need that's contentment so a godly life with contentment is great gain that's in the scripture says for we brought nothing into this world what did Genevieve bring to our family did she bring any money with her no you bring any uh any jewelry any credit cards she didn't bring anything Michie all she brought us was what joy that's all she brought us you cannot bring anything in the world and in certain you can't take anything out they can make it very easy things with you in your casket or whatever they do but you're not taking it with you to stay here on this earth so the Bible says having food and raiment let us be therewith content just be happy with food and clothes the Bible said doesn't even say money just said food including colors because they that be rich fall into temptation in the snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts all right brother man talked about Johnny Appleseed how many were in Johnny Appleseed I was kind of like a legend where he went through North America and planted all these apple trees and program says he likes that story because he's like that's what I like to do he quotes a poem and said um partings leave behind us footprints on the sands of time footprints that perhaps another while sailing over life's I love Maine a forlorn and shipwrecked brother in sing shall take heart again for the RAM said that's what we all like to see something that we have did that will cause others to benefit by what we have done amen so that's what's most important we all want to see that our lives have helped somebody else so especially us adults right because the children they don't have as many resources as we do but children you still can do great things because Kylie Rose said that they her mom said that they they made 400 bags of love this summer never take those 400 bags into the hospital going to children that I've cancer and so Kylie's one girl who can see the impact she has on people and we might not have that same calling in life but we can still all find something to do like for example with Malachi playing piano like if people say oh Malik I enjoyed that which we have many people on Sunday say Oh Malachi we enjoyed your play so Malik I could see wow in my life I did something that helped other people or when Lydia some of the children told me thank you for making them the bracelets you can see you helped put a smile on somebody's face or case you're holding Genevieve and I could say thank you patient I couldn't get her to stop crying but you did and you can you can feel the benefit of or thanks for making breakfast now the children aren't starving is it such a great job you see so you can see that your life benefits others and that's what I like to tell you children thank you for what you do because you need to see that your life has an impact what if she wasn't here what if we didn't have Olivia what if malecon I wasn't more what if acacia was aboard life would be totally different and you have a special place you have a special position in God's family that you bless other people with amen Wingull friends Samedi remember salmon derringer some old building did me I don't think we did it's on the tour I think we had time to visit it well brother man was talking to Sam Adair the doctor he says how you doing bill Oh a pretty fair I suppose yourself Oh lots of patients I had 15 examinations afternoon you imagine 15 I think the doctor I saw the other day had like three in the morning and three in the afternoon and Sam and air at 15 this afternoon so he was probably a lot faster than what are you doctors but he said well that's just as good as long as those examinations and find nothing wrong brother branham said he said we got to talking about backing her boys I said well doc I don't know just how long I'm gonna be around we're both in our 50s because that's true bill but all these years about 31 years in ministry now I've kept my heart prepared for that hour when he comes doesn't matter when he comes Sam Adair said the greatest thrill I have is what do you think it is what's the doctor's greatest thrill assume a patient recovered something like that he said living for others and that's exactly what that's what happens when a doctor's is living for others he's helping people get better the greatest thrill in his life is living for others and brother Graham said that's what life is it makes life real who wants life to feel real good it's not what you do or accomplish for yourself but what you can do for others so chilled remember Sunday when there's lots of people at the altar pray when I see that I can look and say wow that's what god help me do for somebody else or the camp said they haven't had a service like that in a long time very good so God really moved and God was speaking to people and shouting and scream and dancing the spirit it was just a really good time to the Lord people are getting victory over things that they probably left in their life too long so when I can look back and say wow I didn't I did not get the rest relax this weekend I was working and I'm still worn out just from this weekend but that's one thing I can look at and say I did not do that really for myself I did that for somebody else and I can say thank the Lord that ought to be the biggest thrill of my life and we ought to find each one of us should find the biggest thrill in our life how we can help others or get people well or or do something to benefit other people that should be the biggest thrill let me set the time roots let me go about ten moments by God's grace because we're getting close to the time here algorithm so that brings me to thinking of 31 years of ministry for the Lord I guess every man thinks of some time when he's come to his last service and come his last hour and look back down the path and see what's been accomplished and see what's went on and he's asked himself have you did anything and I just said it's what you do for others that counts that's a good feeling to be able to look back and say in 2017 here's what God used me to do in 2016 remember this when God did this number 2015 you can look back down the road of life say wow remember this happened in 2005 2000 1999 God was doing all these things that's what counts for the kingdom of God when you look back and say wow God used me to help this one God use me to help that one the RAM said I often wonder what it would be like when I get to the end of my road which we don't know what time that will be none of us so I was thinking about looking back down along the trail where I've come through life and I've seen the different hills and briar patches and rocks and hard places and smooth runnings and what I did in those kind of times it'll all show up one of these days at the hour am I going away per me and it'll do that on each one of us we will all be sure of that and he'll show up to each one when that time comes all right now let's close with Ecclesiastes chapter 3 because chapter 2 ends with this kind of sad note he just talked about all I made myself despaired I found the only good thing is the gift of God they eating and drinking the family time that we have together and brother Branham said we're all gonna look back down the trail and he said what I want to make sure I highlight that what I did in those kinds of times to think about this what what time of your life is it right now brother Graham listen is it a hill like you're climbing up a hill a hard uphill battle is it a briar patch we're getting poked and pulling out the thorns because if you like you're stepping on rocks and hard places I know when I step out on the driveway without shoes on - rough vlog I don't enjoy that walk weather order or is it the other side is it smooth running everything is going smooth like on your bike you just cruise it you're just you just you're just going along for the ride and the winds blowing through your hair it's a good tenant which one is which one are you in right now a hill briar patch rocks or smooth runnings my brother Graham said what did you do in those kind of times [Music] which spirits inside we doing the happy times do we do we go overboard and and spend too much money on the things of the world and the happy times or do we rejoice mo do we stay diligent and don't get caught up on the things of the world or stay faithful to God well we just got so much money we don't forgive it we don't go to church as much anymore we're just we're doing so good out of this thing else to give Church and I'll just go shopping or something like that well how do we act in the good times or the hard times well it's it's so depressing I don't want to go see anybody at church I don't want to help anybody out all those homeless people get helped out themselves who cares about them go get a job yeah how do we act in the hard times how did we handle the hard times I let me handle the briar patches how do we have the how do we handle the frustrations how do we act now we're all gonna act wrong some point right but we've got to get back again let's just take turn so I'll read one and all you can read two to everything there's a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven so you guys read verse 2 1 3 1 2 3 2 which is Queen a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing verse 6 1 2 3 a time to Rend and a time is so a time to keep silence and a time to speak verse 8 1 2 3 the same to our feet my countries where the brand says this about tithing the RAM said there is five months I want you remember these no matter how sincere a man may be in doing it doing God a service there's five must be there first it must be his time to do it think about what you're desiring he said God's time and do it what if Moses want to come and say we'll build an ark and float up the Nile is that like Noah did what if he would have said that that had been the right time Noah's time was all right for the ark but not for Moses this time what if Jesus would have come and said I'll tell you what we just go up on the mouth like Moses did and get a new declaration of laws on the stones did Jesus do that no brother Ram said he was that law he didn't need the laws of stones are laws on stone he was the he was the law made flesh amen so you must be in his time it must be in his season you got that now must be in his time must be in his season he said time and season all right so Malachi just come and play in God's time here as we as we get ready to pray and close the service this is what we must think about if we overcome with despair why are we overcome with despair what have we allowed ourselves to meditate upon that wasn't the plan of God it wasn't the will of God no we don't be discouraged the churches flooded we could all just spare about them or we could choose to rejoice in all things saying oh it's just a test from the Lord not allowed to test we can rejoice and be thankful we lost all the furniture I don't know what we lost I don't know the state is trying to get us to despair and be hopeless we can't get our eyes off the eternal life even word of God because there's a season of all things is it a season that you have to walk up the hill we all know the burning in our legs that we film it Walker run up a hill are we walking through a riot machen very careful slowly we'll walk you long so we don't get palmed we don't get you know start bleeding we're walking on stone tarts gums we just have to smooth sailin think about the season that you're in think about what you're going through [Music] remember that whenever we're going through this just a short time when it's fleeting there's a time for all these things I mean whether you want to recognize God's time it's easy David let's pray that let's pray to God all of us each one to recognize the time can see somewhere in and we can be content in God sees only discouraged we want to be depressed and what we like we need to be loved you won't feel like there's no hope we would feel like there is hope because Christ is our price is our length I just have a word of minutes father [Music] Heavenly Father we just worship you today I was really depressed really this podium and here we are - 3,000 years later you just went through season three bags and he got his eyes off your word oh he searched that for everything else to make him happy rather denying God help us to recognize the season of life before cloak missing the helpless and we're depressed or discouraged we recognize that all and say God doesn't want beautiful season anymore you see that I belong this is something I've done I've caused my south of you this way [Music] [Music] many times we know we're guilty nothing ourselves get down this earth negative we exaggerate we stereotype you say peeps do not you say forgive us Lord Jesus we don't need to say such things you know what I don't think they come out of our lives so forgive us O God we thank you to rejoice to be holy to be content pleasure feel that we don't need someone to help us your service because we have become friends if you provide all right I'll be good see the see sorry if we can't do anything about it it's a god-ordained sees that we cannot change now it was the heaven earth help us that the thrill living that's my prayer Lord help me live brothers don't me to see what I could be the house when I beat myself the time to do what they hope you got a stranger Lord whatever Lord your artists and developers to do enjoy to do it like your ability that you give us give us clean hands and up your hearts we may see or Jesus we thank you for the night that's over don't despair by getting our eyes back up the wisdom of God to see the eternal things we'd be willing to give up hundreds
