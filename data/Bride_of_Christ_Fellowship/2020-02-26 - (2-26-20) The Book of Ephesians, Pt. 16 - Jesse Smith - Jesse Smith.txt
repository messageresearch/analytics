for that as we read the word here visions chapter four by God's grace I'd like to get back to this series it's been over a year since I preached on this series I never quite finished it that's the beauty about being a pastor you can always pick it up at another time fees for I think our text is going to be verse 17 yep or eat 17 and 18 thank you Jesus visions for 17 and 18 let's read 17 together but then I'll read 18 because I can read both scriptures for a text tonight I'm just calling this the book of Ephesians part set 16 sorry 16 almost said 17 it's part 16 by God's grace let's read verse 17 on three one two three this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that ye henceforth not walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind sorry about that I'll read verse 18 having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart now if you would just for a moment let's go back to Revelation 3:20 that's our memory verse 4 February from brother Jose revelation 3:20 alright let's read that on three one two three behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me Amy let's have word of Prayer just briefly here let's remember this young man in prayer here by God's grace he's battling a suicidal thoughts and has already attempted it a few times but God's mercy is more let's pray that he'll open his heart to God's mercy let's pray Heavenly Father we love you tonight father we read your word we were thankful Lord that our minds have been enlightened dear God by the Holy Spirit Lord to understand the things of God nor that's the parable you told about the good ground how they would understand hear the word and be converted dear God thank you for your amazing grace that we can hear it and not just hear it but understand that Lord God and apply it to our lives by humbling ourselves Lord and yoking ourselves with you lord god working with you lord as the scripture says in mark 16 you worked with the early apostles work with us here tonight Lord God work through me work through each and every person Lord God let your Holy Spirit's presence minister and help us Lord and we pray for this young man we don't know his name it's not important the Lord he's battling suicidal thoughts so father we ask in Jesus Christ's name that the Holy Spirit will make intercession for him Lord God send out your angels and Lord God to protect him Lord God we just pray Lord that his heart and he and his wife their hearts will softened to this glorious gospel show them your kindness show them your goodness Lord if he's got something against someone let him forgive him Lord God Lord for bitterness is a root Lord it's so hard to uproot god I just pray Lord if there's any bitterness in his heart he uproot it by the Holy Spirit he take your promises and received the free gift of salvation softened his heart and his wife's heart and what I just pray to be a great testimony of salvation Lord but of all above all let thy will be done we ask everything according to your will and we know you hear our prayers we're grateful for it your God we pray your minister here tonight in Jesus Christ II and the church said Amen god bless you be in see the praise God I do have some slides here so in case you pull it up here by God's grace and I'd like to get back to this series here on Ephesians it's gonna be hard to remember but back in 2015 I started the series on Galatians I think I preached about twenty or thirty sermons on that whole book we took it all the way through and I guess let me jump right to the reason here's the reason I preached it brother Graham had the vision and the physi told about the vision of going beyond the curtain of time and they asked him about when he'll be asked about when he would be judged and he said Jesus will first come to you and then you'll be judged and then these people are your converts that you've led and he said you mean by being a leader that will judge me yes is every leader have to be judged like that yes what about Paul he'll have to be judged by his and then he said well if his group goes in so will mine because I preach exactly the same word that's it I said where he baptized in Jesus name I did too I preached and millions screamed out all at once were resting on that and I thought my if I only had only knew this before I could come here I would make people come here they can't afford to miss this why looky here so my thought behind that was if we're resting on Paul's gospel we need to know what he said in all of his letters because Paul called this the whole Council of God so that's my inspiration kind of behind this series like I said it's been since September of 2018 when I last preached on this series but I felt led to kind of pick it up and if you remember the last ones I the last messages I'm preaching on was in chapter 4 with the fivefold ministry now remember the scripture gives seven Ben it's of the fivefold ministry and then we looked at the attacks on the five fold five hold ministry and the reality of the home church and of course that led into all the Jeffersonville things that we just got done preaching the series I'll improve all things so it all kind of just flowed together and just so you know I work it on my next video it should be out Saturday about the seven mistakes of the Jeffersonville movement I'm not going to name the brother's names but I'm gonna put those false doctrines those seven false doctrines I'm gonna put them in there because the people need it I er texted a couple pastors and they need it because they just battle it you know there's this this Jeffersonville movement has millions of influencers right they influence millions and so people need the truth and Jesus said the truth will set you free praise God now here's the member here's the seven benefits of the fivefold ministry the fivefold ministry equips the Saints with the tools they need to be the bride it works the ministry it builds up the body or helps them to grow up a church keep in mind if people don't have the true fivefold ministry they can't benefit from these things this means those who attack the real fivefold ministry they're lacking some if not all of these the Saints aren't equipped they're not working in the ministry and they're not being but they're not growing in Christ they're actually becoming more immature he imagined people with sent message message pews for 10 20 years and they become spiritual babies they're just as arrogant prideful angry bitter sensual addicted to porn and evil things sports like we said they love those things more they love the things of God but see the fivefold ministry brings agreement see believers as Christians and pastors and saints we can agree on the truths of God's Word and provide and Paul said it's the knowledge which means the precise truth unto the portion of the maturity of Jesus Christ so whatever Porsche and each Holy Ghost field person can achieve the fivefold ministry helps them reach that portion whether it's remember Jesus said it's either a 30-fold fruitfulness sixty fold or a hundredfold so the true fivefold ministry helps you reach your god-given potential amen hallelujah the sixth thing it learns to speak the truth in love yeah that's why I like how Billy Paul wrote me that letters that I can feel your love did I share that with you brother Billy Paul wrote me back I wrote him a letter he wrote me back and he said I can feel your love even though you're trying to bring correction he said most people don't do it would love but you do it with love amen I like that we can say the truth but we say it in love and then seventh and Paul said it's like a body the fivefold ministry fitly joins the body together right it places the body parts and but Christ is the head praise God I might be the I might be the toe but at least I'm on that body praise God I might be the skin on the bottom of that foot but at least I'm part of that body amen you got a and that's what the fivefold ministry does helps you find your position in the body of Christ so see those and I'll say I just those in the false movements and these rumors we've been preaching on we looked at believe the sign and jeffersonville false teaching those if they're if they're if they're against the fivefold ministry then by the word they have to be lacking some of these truths there's no way they can reach the full maturity of a Christian without the real truth of God's Word amen and that's why it's so important that we don't add one word or take one word away praise God and never the millions were shouted out we're resting on their same n the fivefold ministry the Prophet the pastor the teacher the evangelists amen we're resting on there say men I'll tell ya but without this they must be lacking something because remember the Bible said add to your faith and add well without the fivefold ministry how can it be added it's very difficult praise God I imagine they have very few now that Paul told us in this chapter wrote ephesians 4 that without it they're no longer they're no longer mature so they become immature right they become tossed from one idea to another from one tragedy to another from one pleasure to another less they're just tossed or agitated all over the place they're carried which means driven in doubt hesitation different opinions from one opinion to another opinion and they're deceived this is what we see a lot they're letters stray they just go deeper into false doctrines deeper in their false doctrines all over all over the world right but the fivefold ministry protects you from this Paul says you're no longer this we're supposed to be real mature Christians amen now then we looked at the attacks on the fivefold ministry and the reality of the home church praise God now I want to review here I think Scofield said there's four but I kind of put these lasts he separated the walk from the warfare but I just kind of put those together but you could you know you could put them at you could make it four themes you know four themes but we've preached on the first theme the believers exalted position in Christ I'm getting this from Scofield the one body of Christ both Jew and Gentile now that's one of the mysteries of the gospel Paul mentions 12 mysteries that's one of them how the Jew and Gentile they used to be separated by a wall but that middle wall partitions been broken down and now we're one body in Christ Jesus amen and the Jew now is called the remnant there's going to be a small remnant of Jews because the bride must be made out of every nation from every every nation and tongue from around the world amen she's got to be a fully a full Gentile bride right a full bouquet bride we'd a amen glory and she the Jew is just one of those Nations and now we've been looking at the walk and the warfare so see chapter four we looked at the fivefold ministry is just getting into the walk of the believer so the believer can't even walk straight without the fine gifts of preaching praise God because if not they're immature right they're tossed they're agitated of all these problems without the real receiving of the Word of God amen now let's get a little more background on Ephesus just briefly here I like to just background Ephesus you know there's a nice there's a nice project online called the Bible project and these people do a lot of research and they do a video on every book and so I pulled some thoughts from there I thought that would really help you and their historical as well so acts 19 has the story of how Paul came to Ephesus you probably remember you know Apollo's was there teaching them he was mining the scriptures but they weren't born again they only knew the gospel or the baptism of John the Baptist well Apollo sleeves for a while Paul comes in he says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe they're like we did we know there was the Holy Ghost that's how I was brother right I was in the assembly of God and I didn't even know there was the Holy Ghost amen I was baptized I was in the Presbyterian then for a while but I didn't even know there's a real Holy Ghost baptism amen where the life of Jesus stayed with you permanently praise God not temporarily like we looked at last Wednesday night with the soul but it stays permanently and they said we didn't even know that he says what were you baptized Oh John's baptism of repentance so he preached to them the word they got baptized he laid hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost and they spake in tongues and prophesied as the Spirit gave them utterance amen how many were there twelve was that a megachurch no but in God's eyes we might say it was a mega church full of power praise God it was a mega power church amen because my dad says five people with the Holy Ghost it's more than five hundred without it high praise God just getting by people born again will do more for our city and do more for a church than five hundred that aren't born again that's right now this is true I got I'll have some history later from Wikipedia and it agrees with what brother Branham said in the church age book but emphasis was a huge city it was I think the second most important city outside of Rome in that day in Paul's day and it was the epicenter of worship for all the Greek and Roman gods he's remember when Paul went in their church remember he started preaching in healing and then the people got so fired up they brought all their books of enchantment remember that and they threw all their books together in a big old fire and burned it and then later the next chapter they're arguing and they almost killed Paul because he's preaching against Diana this place was it was full of the worship of women that's about where we're at today right the worship of women today they were so full of their gods and it was it was such a place of prosperity my it's a lot like later Tasya praise God and Paul Minister Minister therefore at least that's wrong at least three years I put the wrong number there because in acts 20 it says he was there for three years yeah he warned them with tears so I do I do actually apologize I just you forgive me he warned them for three years with tears about wolves that would enter in yeah that's ex 2031 he said now therefore watch therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears not now Paul writes this letter not quit according to Scofield Paul writes this letter after he leaves Ephesus remember he cried and he said that I've taught you the whole Council of God they all cry he goes off he know he's got to go to Rome to die Jesus has showed him where he's gonna die what a privilege who Jesus said I've got to show many things that he must suffer for my sake look at that the suffering was great but so were the revelations great amen we always say we want greater revelations but you know what comes with that suffering praise God Paul's a great example he's third heaven he went to the third my vision and he couldn't speak about some of the things he said but he also had some of the greatest buffeting some of the greatest suffering so many times Hertz with great revelation comes great humility and great suffering so years later in fact four years later after he wrote the letter to the Galatians he writes this letter to the Ephesians and he writes it from Rome from prison so this is a prison epistle we might call it nine now what's interesting - I just wonder this is another one from the Bible project I like they just divide it in two I showed you a Scofield themes right he had different themes but he the Bible project divides it in half the first three chapters are the gospel story which is really beautiful right you're chosen in Christ before the foundation world Jew and Gentile the walls been broken down now were one body in Christ we're building up in the building of God but then in chapter four or five and six he starts dealing with the church so the first half is the Gospel story the Jesus story and now the second half is our story the bride story I like I like that amen Christ story and now the bride story Christ in the bride amen and once they start with the preaching the fivefold ministry praise God that's what we see now I want to pull now some quotes from the church age book by man taught about Ephesus he he quotes Jesus where he says you must repent and come back to God and do your first works and what is the way back the way is the way of repentance if a sinner has to come to God by way of repentance then the lukewarm or backslider will have to repent that much more repent bring forth fruits meet for repentance prove it by your life if you do not repent to God I will remove your lampstand now how many have seen in your church or other churches people that are definitely lukewarm or backslidden and they're there there's no magic pill or there's no magic Minister can I say like that there's no magic easy fix for someone to get out of a lukewarm back sitting condition the only way to get out is to repent and change your life amen it's good to come to church it's necessary to come to church we just saw the benefits of the fivefold ministry but if we don't bring Church to our house on Sunday night or Monday morning it did it's not going to do us any good praise God we're going to remain in a lukewarm Backson and condition praise God but the reality of it is if we want to get back with God we've got to repent we have to do the same thing we did at the beginning praise God but we find very few people I say like this very few churches that are able to keep that fire but there will be some praise God amen and I want to be one of those some praise the Lord amen that little remnant that little bride a man that little flock who God has given the kingdom to and the only way to do it is by your life the daily life he said certainly a church and that can she can't give light to the world it's light it's turn to darkness God will take them away it's I'm sorry God will then take away its faithful messenger and its faithful shepherds and leave them to themselves they will go on talking about Christianity but be reffed of it repent quickly don't hesitate now here's the history we'll get to this a moment evidently Ephesus did hesitate for her lifespan was not very long the glory of God decreased ever so rapidly it was not long into the city was in ruins its glorious temple became a shapeless mass the land became a marsh inhabited by waterfowl the population was gone except for a few unbelievers in a squalid village and if you know the history they kept rebuilding it and what kept happening destruction they rebuild it destruction rebuild it destruction they kept being destroyed and that's because they never repented they never got back with God there was not even one Christian left the lamp was rent from its place now imagine that church twelve Holy Ghost field Saints brother.a they're jumping out of the water they're praising God maybe they're falling on their knees the church starts out with so much power but then Jesus gives a message now that was had to bend around the 50s right 80 54 will say now John gives the message forty years later on 80 90 so 40 years later he says turn back repair get right with God and with church we got a look at our lives we got if we've been in the message decades that this I'm coming up on my second decade here next year will be my second decade in the message if we're not careful we begin to backside and get lukewarm but we've got to renew our love for Christ by doing the same things we did when we first got saved hey man it's beautiful not even one Christian left at one time Malachi emphasis was sprawling with great with Christians amen Paul was there the prophet of God was there people were burning up there things that burning up all their evil dirty magazines right burning up all their getting rid of all their cellphone the Jesus and all kinds of things throw it away all their their evil things get rid of everything but pretty soon they let some of it back in and Jesus said repent or I'm taking the preachers out or I'm taking the whole church out no to us and Mike's now you're gonna see it to us it might seem like a slow process but with God time is very time goes very fast right with God to us it may seem like it's shorter now here's the Wikipedia history when Augustus became Emperor in 27 BC that's 27 years before Christ the most important change was when he made Ephesus the capital of proconsular Asia which covered Western Asia Minor instead of Pergamum Ephesus then entered into an era of what prosperity becoming both the seat of the governor and of the major centre of Commerce according to Strabo is the second importance and size only to Rome this was a massive City this was a huge city that had potential to serve God many people needed to hear the gospel so what God sent them a hook-nosed you with a message of Jesus Christ how did a man that used to persecute Christians God changed his heart and sends a prophet who's on fire in the city to create more people on fire amen and they just got a few little churches started right start with 12 and the little churches spring out up over the city now notice Church this was established around 80 I could actually look it up real quick acts 19 Scofield is nice as a year for every chapter it was 80 54 oh my memory serves me correct my and eighty fifty six so those were the years Paul was there 1854 86 56 now so that's when the church started so at 210 years later 210 years later the entire city was destroyed now look that might seem like a long time nuts but with God one days with God has what thousand years very short time and the warning came from John's letter revelation chapter 2 the warning came in 89 about 40 years after the church started because 40 years is like what a generation right but look how merciful God was that's why brother ray I believe the rapture could be anytime but I also could believe it could be longer ways away because if God's mercy is this if God was this merciful to the Ephesians he may be that merciful to the later see in church age no man no man knows the day or the hour right we have dreams about it like brother any man has dreams about it that's wonderful we're all looking for the coming of the Lord we watch we watch Russia we watch a Israel we watch all these things but no man really knows the day so this city from that warning a Tosa 8090 so take about a hundred years away from about a hundred sixty years after that letter from John the city was completely destroyed this marked the decline of the city's splendor however Emperor Constantine the Great rebuilt much of the city and erected new public baths let's remember that Church God is not mocked whatever a man sews that Willie reap this church failed to repair at some point probably not though let me say this the Holy Ghost filled Saints there they were always on fire for God because the Holy Ghost filled say is sealed unto the day of his Redemption praise God hey you think Church you think Paul ever back slid and got so lukewarm that people wondered if he was saved do you think Paul overdid that you think a real Holy Ghost filled Saint would ever get so far back slidden and so lukewarm that you wonder I wonder if this guy's even got the Holy Ghost no way no way because the Holy Ghost inside of you it hungers for the Word of God it lives by the Word of God well Graham said if a man whose Holy Ghost filled or woman can't get to church and hear the word he said they feel like they're perishing amen praise God see if they can't get to that fivefold ministry to hear the word of God that Jesus said Jesus sent that fivefold ministry amen that was his plan not all plan that was his plan praise but this church those 12 and all the Holy Ghost hood Saints no doubt they serve God but church it was the next generation and the next generation some people started rising up leading the church that weren't born again right and pretty soon they didn't repent they didn't repent pretty soon you've got just sanctified people and pretty soon they start leaving pretty soon just got just the five people and pretty soon after 116 more years God said I'm done with it he sends the Gauss in there destroys the whole city not now it does not mean that she could not have repented it does not mean that we cannot repent we can but it must be quickly it must be a true heart cried to God in sorrow and then God will restore the glory shall come again ha ha ha hey thank the Lord amen Sosa's about 160 years after that letter John wrote the letter Jesus had sent it to this churches he sent it and they had to repair and program says in the church age book apparently they didn't repent because God destroyed the whole city he took out the preachers he took out all his faithful men of God's women of God took them all out he destroyed the city now this is what we we need this we need someone we need church members we need believers that will quickly repent but they won't they won't drag it on for week after week well I need to do this but uh I know I should do this we don't need that we need people that are desperate to get right with God amen we need people that want to quickly feel God's presence again praise God that's what Jesus said new the first works through it quickly or else I'll come and take that lampstand that's right that's the kind that's the kind of believers that we need to be today praise God now let's go to verse 17 our text here now I'm kind of just warming up here now I'm free to about half of half an hour more okay I want to really I want to preach the hour we got kids I got to go to school and I got to go to school in the morning so I'm trying to watch it by God's grace I am trying now verse 17 this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind amen Paul's talking to the churches that had that were Holy Ghost filled he said don't walk with the vanity of a Gentile mind now let's look at some of these Greek words I don't do Greek very much for the Ray but I and when I did this study I just started pulling Greek word after Greek word I think it would be helpful for us to understand praise God so it's not to be intellectual it's just to kind of give us a different look at it because that's insurance we read over that we're like mom yeah but when you see a Greek definition it can give you a synonym right or another word it might trigger something in your mind like maybe you've heard it on a sermon this week or maybe something maybe somehow the Holy Spirit can bring out a different meaning to minister to your heart now now I want to bring this out because last we've been preaching on five sermons on the Soul recently he says don't walk as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind now what did I tell you last week Church we looked at this a few weeks ago you and I in the mine mostly right we live up here are conscious our mind right and brother and says you get calls from your body feed me feed me and he says you get calls from your soul give me fellowship with God give me fellowship with God but we're living right here many times right but then David said when I laid on my bed I commune with my soul I knew yeah now you brother says your soul is your nature right so it's what you are it's what's gonna drive you either faith or unbelief right or we know either the baptism Holy Ghost or not born again so he says don't walk in a vain mind don't walk don't make decisions from this so what he's saying is we got to walk from our soul praise God we got to live from the nature of God that God has placed in our soul praise God that's why we got to get up and pray or if you for you maybe say up late night and pray and get your direction for the next day if you're not going to get into direction for the next day in the morning you better get it at night amen you it because that you're to walk in some way and you want to walk from your soul not in the vanity of your mind and church he's not telling this to sinner's he's talking to Ephesian Christians amen this is Christians because we know we like Paul knows there's wise and foolish he writes about it in the next chapter the wise redeemed the time the foolish squander the time so that's what he's saying here do not walk in the vanity of your mind on what's been and he mean it means perverseness so don't walk in a perverted mind see it's perverted to hold grudges that's a perverted thing it's perverted to be selfish right I gotta have my way in I disagree with them and it's perverted to live in lust that's perverted it's perverted to run after money right and let greed rule your life that's perversion it's lacking spiritual vigor praise God amen see Church because whatever you meditate on that's what you become Solomon said as I thought of my heart so I was Paul says do not walk with the perverted mindset make sure your thought life is holy now we're getting into the walk of a believer oh we love chapter one oh you're sitting in heavenly places huh we love that you're chosen in Christ before the nation where all glory we love that but now he's starting to get down to your daily life now he's saying don't be like the other James house because remember they're walking around they're statues to Diana there's no doubt meet here sacrifice to idols there's prostitutes here their sports games there there's an Olympics there Paul saw the Olympics there those stations in Ephesus and all these places all over let all these attractions just like today is a prosperous economy and he's saying do not walk with the perverted mind do not be perverted have a thought life that's focused on God so you cannot walk with a perverted mind now look what he says next in verse 18 now look he says having the understanding darkened so these people didn't understand the Word of God oh that's beautiful because I chapter 5 he says we understand the will of the good that's right so in 5:17 you don't have to turn there but wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is amen glory so he says the other Gentiles will understand God's will but he says you know I Christians we need to understand God's will now I'm going to preach a whole I'm gonna write a whole Lord willing a whole chapter on that mystery of the will of God and so I've been studying on that let me just give you a little bit of a foretaste here of glory divine here let me excuse because it's the Word of God Paul says in 2nd Timothy 1 you were called with the holy calling it is God's will that we walk holy so the way Paul says God has made known to us the mystery of his will God's will is for us to live a holy life and as we walk that holy life God progressively reveals the next part of his will for our lives do you think Joseph in the Old Testament knew after those dreams for the Ray he was going to be sold as a slave to Egypt do you think he did no church some of sometimes the will of God contains tragedies in it but as long as he lived a holy life amen haha as long as he could turn down Potiphar's wife amen glory as long as he can walk in the holiness of God then God would keep opening up doors that he could keep walking in the will of God for his life amen think about it remember Abraham Lincoln he was supposed to be a woodsman and people got upset at Abraham Lincoln brother ray because he was reading books he tried to chop and read books like this and people said what what are you doing you educated man or whatever you higher what do you think you are a scholar you're supposed to be a woodsman and you just sit there but he was drawn to it it was part of his calling amen as long as he lived a separated life and as long as he loved the Word of God God was going to just open then became a mayor and then become a governor and then become president to help set the Negroes free praise God that was part of the will of God for his life yeah so the thing to do is stay holy walk in holiness in fear of God and God will open up every door for your life amen hallelujah that's been fresh to me thank the Lord see but Jen's house with perverted minds they don't understand the word their understanding is darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them so I don't they know God's life because they're ignorant of it I remember Romans 1 the Romans 1 says the law of God is in every heart so see they're willingly ignorant of it willingly on purpose they just don't want to talk about it you ever meet anybody like that they don't want to talk about don't want to hear about it don't know nothing about it they're willingly ignorant of the life of God which has to be the baptism Holy Ghost what is the life of God except the Holy Ghost baptism what is it it has to be they they alienate they separate themselves from the baptism of the Holy Ghost they don't go to churches that preach the Holy Ghost they don't pray like they want to only ghosts they just alienate themselves away from the real life of God but you and I should have a lien it ourselves we should alienate ourselves from the world and put ourselves in the holiest of Holies praise God that's where we should be alienated praise God in God's presence yeah alienate means to shut out from one's fellowship in intimacy see they shut themselves out from God's life the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they're ignorant because of their own hard hearts ignorance means a lack of knowledge they don't even want to know right because of the blindness of their heart somebody's he's covering with a cast how many got calluses on their hands from work see they don't feel it as much anymore they can't feel it let's church that's right we got to watch with our lives when we can't feel the preaching we kind of we got to rub that Callos off for some isn't there a stone that takes off a callus pumice that's right I was gonna say that I was actually gonna say that way wow I must be grown wisdom or something no no no way but see they gotta break out that stone praise God Jesus Christ is the cornerstone oh yeah break on that stone and rub away that callus so people can feel the preaching again how many times are we singing songs and people just sit there like they came and raised their hand in our church other churches they can't even feel it what has happened there so callous right they can't even like somebody singing the songs better they're like what is this gonna get over doctor waiting oh we just want the word well the songs are there to help you get in the spirit to receive the word Christians see that's where I just see we see a lot of lukewarmness and back citing in message churches and it should not be it's because people will repent they won't go and ask for the glory again amen we say God let your glory fall on me again amen let me be his own fires I was at the beginning praise God because he says repent to praise God he calls us to repent me some pomace God sends some pumice stones in the church praise God to break down the calluses of our hearts when the preaching doesn't do anything the songs not if the songs won't movie the preaching what is going to move you nothing's going to move you except sin the rest is the reason they're not hungry and thirsting here is because they're flirting with the world out there Ava and praise God hallelujah see their alienate themselves from the life of God they separate themselves they don't want to hear it they don't want to place for it they separate themselves from it they're careless the blindness of their hearts they can't see it they don't want to see it paul saying don't let this be amongst you now he goes again in the next verse in verse 19 who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness oh so now we know what they're doing now we know the reason they're alienated from the life of God they have given themselves over to lawlessness sin all here's here's the answer how come they don't have the life of God how come people in the message aren't born again because they're enjoying sin too much they've given themselves their past feeling they can't feel the preaching anymore they can't feel the songs they can't feel prayer anymore they don't even feel it because they're enjoying sin too much they're making love to Delilah right they're flirting with Delilah instead of obeying the Word of God instead of finding a real godly mate they're finding a simple mate they are past feeling the Bible says now look what past feeling means they give themselves over to the lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness or with greediness past feeling means you don't feel any pain anymore they see the word doesn't cut people anymore oh I've heard that before I've heard brother Jesse preach it and don't even don't even cut you anymore it doesn't it should always cuz the word if we're wrong we should be able to feel the word correcting us but people have so hushed the holy voice of God in their souls they don't they don't want to hear anymore they don't want to live right like they should Paul says this should not be so they cease to feel pain anymore they become cows insensible apathetic I don't if I get right with God it's okay if I don't if the Holy Spirit comes in church today that's great if not that's okay if I feel God today at church great if not that's okay I got things I got to do sure this is Paul saying this is what the problem is this is the walk it's the walk of the people the daily walk that gets us closer to God or jaw's us further away we either give ourselves over to God or we give ourselves over to the vanity of our minds that's true how many believe that see lascivious this is unbridled see when they're out of church they'll do anything once they're out of church because it's unbridled when they're alone they'll do anything cuz they're all alone it's unbridled I don't care what anybody says I know God's not watching mirror I know guys watch me but he'll forgive me unbridled excess the shimmies this outrage is this shamelessness and they're unclean they're physically morally impure lustful luxurious profligate living and they're greedy greedy desire to have more covetousness that's what the script says that's what Paul's talking about but Paul says now verse 20 but ye have not learned so with Christ amen other than Jesus doesn't teach greediness Jesus doesn't teach live however you want and just enjoy whatever you want I'll forgive everything he don't teach that he doesn't teach you won't find that from a real Christian Church amen you'll find it from a lot of false churches but you won't find that in the real Christ Church amen the real Church of the Saints of the first born hallelujah but you have not learned so in Christ so this idea of well Jesus it's okay if I don't feel the Holy Spirit it's okay if I God does annoy me too it's okay that a pathetic feeling Christ doesn't teach that Christ doesn't teach it's okay to be backslidden you don't teach that you don't learn that from Christ what do you learn stay on fire stay true stay holy stay pure stay full of power amen hallelujah that's right see you've not learned you don't learn uncleanness or greediness or callousness from Christ Jesus and teachers okay to come to church and be bored bored yourself to death and not enjoy the music and not enjoy the preach Jesus don't teach that he teaches you should feel in fact my dad says you should not be like a Wallflower he said you should be like people at a football stadium and get into the get to the mood of it if you're not into it get into it if you don't feel it just do something until you do feeling amen bring your body in the subjection the Word of God and then make that mind and that body obey what your soul is asking for praise God Jesus don't teach sit down and just it's okay to be cows it's okay to be back soon it's okay to fall asleep on the preacher it's okay to do that now if you're really tired that is okay if you worked really hard I understand I was almost falling asleep on Sunday night because I was just tired I woke myself up and received the word and church I felt a difference in my life this week on Monday Tuesday Wednesday because the word that I heard on Sunday I'm away telling the honest God truth before the Lord I felt a great difference in my walk on Monday Tuesday and today by God's grace hallelujah it should be like that all the time right because Jesus doesn't teach cows lessness he don't teach that's okay just coax for a while you don't need to get closer Jimmy see now he says but you've not learned so you haven't been informed you don't practice this with Christ you don't get in these habits with Christ the bad habits because remember jesus said come unto me all that labor and are heavy-laden I'll give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me the only way to learn is to come alongside and get hooked up to Jesus you got to get hooked in right with Christ so you and Christ are laboring together praise God so see when we go to prayer in our closets it's not you praying alone you're praying with Jesus amen you're laboring with him when you bring your family to church it's not just you bringing them to church it's you in Jesus bringing them to church amen it's you're never alone praise God that's how I know my mouth how could my mom bring six children to church three times a week all by herself it's cuz she was an ood alone she was yoked to Christ amen to what she knew to what she knew because she knew the word she knew the word that you got to gather mores to see the Day approaching why did I bring these seven children eight children why did I bring all in the church because I know crisis with me praise God how does my wife to it she's joke to Christ praise God we can't do it on our own but we lead upon the power of the Holy Spirit in our souls amen glory how do you learn if Christ is meek then you got to be meek I've got to be meek the only way to learn is to be yoked to Christ and be meek because though teacher is meek right and lowly in heart and you shall find rest for your souls my yoke is easy my burden is light let's look at some of these definitions labor grow weary exhausted ever feel exhausted Jesus had come to me if you feel exhausted hey man most people say stay out of church of you're exhausted Jesus said come to me if you're exhausted amen I know he's talking about the soul here I know that understand let's see the house the Church of God is a hospital - for your body that's right so you gotta be led by the Holy Spirit heavy laden a heavy burden placed upon you to load one with the burden and like this rest this is rest for the Soul he said I'm giving you rest for your nature that life in you he's someone give you rest for that hunger in you to cause you to permit one to cease from any movement or labor in order to recover collective strength to give rest to refresh to give oneself rest to keep quiet or calm patient expectation he said come to me and I'll give you rest for your soul beautiful he said come and take a yoke a yoke is a something you put on a draught cattle right a laboring cattle in the field he said put my yoke upon you like you're you're a laborer you're a cat alright you're working for Jesus he said I'm meek and gentle I'm lonely I'm a low degree I'm humble in other words I'm humble memories have this things these things have I spoken unto you that's right before his crucifixion that in me he have might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good courage I've overcome the world amen where we find peace at in Jesus Christ that's right another Guinness this is beautiful crew scripture Paul writes recipe that God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of all comfort who comforts us in all of our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble the reason we suffer is to help other people when you hear somebody has a truck straw like you had that should ring a bell in your soul I'm to encourage them I've been through the same thing and you should share with them how did you overcome that like I've been I've seen recent college students lately and high school and I'm telling them this is how I overcome in college like even preaches those middle schoolers last week I said here's how I did it I just I had to separate myself when all the college guys watching TV I usually ghost out and sat down I just had to give him a wave and run upstairs so I didn't get addicted to the TV I had to separate myself from them I just had to live a different life I had to go up and read my Bible praise God I'd have spent all Sunday at church so I didn't go watch the TV right he said by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God so when you receive God's comfort you're able to comfort other people for as the sufferings of Christ offended us so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ amen see now sin is a weight Church how do you know that sin is a heavy burden and Paul said sometimes we run and we have weights of sin in our lives he said let us lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us and let us run the with patience the race that set before us David knew how heavy that was look at David my iniquities are gone over my head as a heavy bird and they're too heavy for me can you imagine David trying to hold this burden of late that's why people come to church and they're like this the whole church service because that heavy weight and burden it's just it's just burning them why don't you lay it down why don't you give it to Jesus praise God why don't you repent and get back to glory of God and get back into his presence praise God throw off the heavy weight and be free the burden is light amen my wounds stink and our corrupt because of my foolishness is not usually why we fall short of God's glory our own foolishness I should resolve this video of this movie called the pilgrims progress right it's a it's an animation of the actual story by Paul Bunyan right or John Bunyan sorry but beautiful story he leaves the society and as he goes his burden gets heavier and heavier as he's seeking that celestial city right and when he finally seen it finally gets their clothes he the burden falls off and it rolls down a hill or something and then there's the cross you know I can't explain I can't remember I think I was hoping Genevieve while we were watching the movies I can't remember all the details but somehow when he saw the cross the burden fell off amen and it falls off and then he's eight and now he's free he's strong again that's all we need to do when we come to church praise God we should do it actually every day lay down the heavy burdens because the heavy burdens are like weights upon our head now at the end of this chapter Paul breaks into this illustration of the old man against the new man and he's saying we need to walk as new men our lives should be so different our Christian life should be so different from our old life we're not walking the vanity of our minds from the past we're not walking according to perverseness we're walking according to holiness and fear of the Lord we're learning of Christ our burden his light now Ephesians 4:22 now I'd actually read verse 21 if so be that you have heard of him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts now this put off means put off like a garment right it's like you got dirty clothes on right you got you got stained clothes on you got old clothes on and he's saying take off the dirty clothes and put on clean clothes amen that's right so see lust church are always deceptive Satan's always gonna make our sin it's kind of okay he's going to make us seem like it's all kind of okay if you do this it might be okay other people are doing it this brother sisters doing it it's kind of deceptive well you got to have this you really have to do this you need this it's so deceptive but that's what Paul says Paul said the old man is full of deceitful lusts so see it's all about recognizing the truth can we recognise the truth or we walk into deception you've seen it you talk to people they think they're right with God and you know they're not right with God but yet they're just they deceive themselves they they have somehow convinced themselves that that's okay that the way they're living when it's not they deceive themselves because lust is always deceptive right now here Paul now starts dealing with their individual lives with their walk now let's look first at corrupt though corrupt for us is to lead away a Christian Church from that state of knowledge and holiness in which it ought to abide so a deceitful corrupted activity will lead us away from the life that we should be living the Church of week if we come to church or we know we're not living right then let's let's be honest with ourselves let's not be deceived let's not deceive ourselves Paul said you can deceive yourself right God will give you over to a lie right if you want to believe a lie I don't believe I'm good to give you over to that let's not be deceived if we know we're not living the way we should live we've got to do it quickly Jesus says Jesus said do it quickly or else I'll take the lampstand out a way out of your life and now be renewed in the spirit of your mind a man raised God verse 23 and be renewed in the spirit of your mind listen we're all gonna feel all the times we got to recognize I feel old so we can feel new again praise God our clothes are gonna constantly feel like they're getting old and when we feel that in the natural it's time to get a new shirt right especially my pants wear my pants oh man when my pants get holes on it I don't waste any time I go right to coals and I buy a new one I don't want to walk around with holes in my pants right I used to get them right in here sometimes they rip right here usually here though I don't waste any time I don't want to walk around with old clothes on I don't want to look like a vagabond I want to look respectful praise God that's a Christian we don't want to look like we're old and sin we want to be renewed in the spirit of our mind praise God why waste time just go get it sometimes it gets me and some financial pinnacles like pickles I'll say like that I'll just go get it but it's it's a spiritual principle I'll take off the old and put it on the noon praise God get you something new praise God get you a new I'll get you a new walk a new experience with God get something near praise God it's true holiness the Bible said let me read that now I'm almost done yeah I'm really trying honey I'm really trying tonight here and she's not pressuring me but she told me to my word cuz each week I'm like maybe I preach 45 minutes tonight you know me maybe I operate she's like well you said 45 you said and you always say give me 15 more minutes I'm not gonna say that tonight okay but I do want to finish this thought ah be renewing the spirit of your mind he said and put on the new man verse 24 which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness now I don't have time so I'm just going to skip right to it then let's close this is just an image this bible project makes nice drawings and I thought I would just show this to the church and it's nice I think that I love these I'm a visual learner I love I love when people draw pictures that's why they I love how my wife trains our children to be artists there I love just it's a vision giving a visual of it give me the Statue River it man I want to see it in a visual praise God I just it makes it real to me so Paul says you've got to put off the old man and you got to put on the new man and he says you must do it he said if you're gonna if not you're gonna walk in the vanity of a calloused past feeling a Christian that can't feel the gospel effect anymore so here's a good example Paul says take off the old man put on the new he's this is the order he gives it at the end of the chapter and we'll go over this maybe on Sunday we have two services Sunday I forgot to announce that he says it said align a real Christian a new a renewed Christian doesn't lie a new Christian tells the truth Paul give me some neat mystery brother man give me some deep mystery how can I go closer to God read your Bible and pray read your Bible and pray amen and that's the hardest thing for people to do that's why program said it is there's so many things pulling Anna's so many desires but see we we have to find this way just recognize the others a lot of things pulled on me but look at my clothes they're filthy look at my spiritual life it's old it feels old and stale we'll just take it off and put on some new ones praise God just get some new ones because jesus said these kind of clothes are without money or cost amen it's not natural cost it's just as cost of sacrifice of time let's say an or fee he said if you're angry he said then make peace the old man steals he said if you steal make sure you give a lot and that's where I was guilty I stole a lot of money from my mom God forgive me I've tried to be generous since then praise the Lord he said he I'm troubled with gossip he said make sure you incur urge people the new man the new man doesn't ask for revenge the new man forgives and jerks you and I have to put this on it's not easy it's not easy sometimes you feel like taking something sometimes you feel like getting upset with somebody but the new man you take off the old and you put on the new you don't ask for revenge as forgiveness Paul says the old man is promiscuous which means fornication or adultery he said but we gotta have self-control praise God he said the old man got drunk he said but we get drunk on God's beer okay I don't have a guy and this goes into chapter five and so forth some but chapter four ends with I think these right here yeah I think think nice that's this is a beautiful picture isn't it Church such a beautiful picture of the gospel that's when it does church if we're a real Holy Ghost filled Christian we can recognize I'm getting some calluses Lord I need some pumice I want to feel this again I want to I want to take off this old experience I want to take off this old habits and I want to put on the new man praise God I don't want to live in the vanity of my mind I want to live I want to be a I want to have a transform mind I want a renewed mind in Christ musicians if you'll come here let's have a word of Prayer by God's grace see Beau Geste is that important absolutely we're resting on that hey I'm one of those millions praise God I'm resting on Paul's gospel praise God that means I'm gonna yoke myself to

today by God's grace let's go to work Lord help me at work help me to be a real Christian help me to not ask for revenge help me not to battle with these things help me to labor for the kingdom of God
