can people see I wish i I gather again amen thank you Jesus praise God let's take our Bibles and stand if we can in honor of the Word of God tonight I'd like to go back to proverbs chapter one I'd like to continue this little thought maybe finish it tonight on my son here the instruction so let's look to the Lord tonight and open up our Bibles let's go to proverbs again chapter one Harbor chapter 1 verse 8 proverbs chapter 1 verse 8 proverbs chapter 1 verse 8 we'll just read that verse together and let's just read it on 3 ready 1 2 3 my son here the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother amen let's just bow our heads for word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart just make it known unto God Heavenly Father Lord our heads are bowed our eyes are closed Lord or our thoughts are on you or we've sung your songs we've given you glory we've expressed the love in our hearts for you Lord and your precious son dear God thank you Lord for sending your son to die for us raise for us O God to forgive us of our sins and send us the power of the Holy Spirit to battle Laodicea in this age Oh God we're so grateful Lord God to be overcomers and Lord overcoming in Satan's Eden by the blood of Jesus Christ Oh God we're thankful tonight Lord bless us as we get into your word Lord God I pray you'd speak to every heart Lord Jesus may every heart humble itself and incline its ear Lord to hear what the Spirit is saying tonight Lord God we know every gathering Lord with you as an appointed gathering Lord God you knew this service would take place before the foundation of the world so speak to us here tonight Lord we need to hear from you we need strength we life we need hope we need wisdom we need your word Lord God we need your spirit help us now in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless yours being seated praise the Lord so we like to look at this is part three of my son here the instruction I think will may be finished tonight by God's grace like I said there was 23 verses where Solomon addressed my son so we want to look at that tonight by the grace of Lord part six over all of our series now part one remember he told his son to do these things to hear obey cry out seek the fear of the Lord accept God's correction and he told him to avoid evil company violent greedy friends and strange women and the rewards would be eternal life longer life favor Phil Barnes pleasantness peace deliverance from evil men and women health good doctrine and Happiness praise God now last week we saw this for part two last week he told his son to keep or guard his heart in other words imprison your heart don't let your heart your emotions leave Christ Prison we'd say Christ place for you and then he told his sons ponder your path they might do that this week sit down and think about your life and what direction it's going hopefully you did I know I did many times and just pray and think and reading the Word of God ponder your path and then he told his son keep wise words before your eyes constantly read the wisdom of the Holy Spirit he told his son keep your word or your pledge don't break any promises humble yourself if you say something don't avoid it he told him keep it humble yourself and go keep your pledge keep your friends he said don't even go to sleep before you make your word come to pass in other words make sure you keep your word and then he said avoid estranged women he gave him a second third and fourth warning to his son to avoid strange women then also we learned we must avoid compromising situations like flattering words when we know a sinner or someone who's got a questionable character is just praising us and you know we know they don't live the word all the way they make compromises we've got to avoid any flattering lips because Satan's are slick talker and we must not be alone at night because member of Salman said I looked out my window and I saw this young man coming down at nighttime and he got caught by the harlot so we saw that last week he again tells his son all these words of wisdom how many grateful for the wisdom of the Holy Spirit amen now so part three let's look at this here let's take your Bibles let's go to chapter eight if we can proverbs chapter eight proverbs chapter eight I'd like to look at verse 32 this is the fourth and final time that Solomon addresses the children so many times 23 times he says my son four times he says he children or my children and this is the fourth and final time he addresses the children so it's just it's really interesting and it's really neat 'fl that we look and see what did the Holy Spirit tell him the wisest man ever outside of Christ to tell his children because we need to know it today by the grace of the Lord 8:32 8:32 now if you recall at the beginning of this series part 1 I finished the sermon in chapter 8 I don't know if you remember that or not probably not but that's ok yeah and I was showing where brother Branham was talking about how Christ was the logos before of the foundation of the world and he said that little light was like a little child playing in front of its father remember that and that was in chapter 8 verses 22 to 31 he said I can see the logos now playing before his father and the father proud of his son the logos that little eternal light you know dancing and jumping and playing and just having fun we'd say or just enjoying life in front of the Eternal Spirit Father and that's Chapter eight now he gets gets done laying this down in verses 22 to 31 and then in verse 32 now he dresses the children and he says in verse 32 now therefore hearken unto me o ye children for blessed are they that keep my ways so God was showing through Solomon Christ's wisdom Christ in His wisdom was there before the foundation of the world it was alive its origin is at God with God is God is the manifestation of God and he says children then because you know this because wisdom is God he said keep my words keep my ways and he says for blessed are they that keep my ways amen here instruction and be wise and refuse it not how many remember when you were a sinner and you would just keep refusing the words of your mother and father I don't remember that or you refuse the words of a preacher you just refuse him you know it and the longer you dinner the easier got right because you start becoming calots the Bible said you become calloused to to the Holy Spirit and the Prophet tells us you know the the longer you tell that spirit know though the more faint it grows and the harder it is to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit I hope our ears are open to the Holy Spirit unyte amen that we came here to hear we didn't come here to criticize we came to hear and say lord help me to become a better Christian tonight give us ears to hear Lord but we used to refuse it you know in children you know we see I see it all the time I work with children but I see many times they're trying to refuse what I'm asking them to do they don't want to do what I tell them to do and they'll sit there and now wait one or two or three or four seconds and I'll ask them again and then I'll wait another three there they're trying to refuse it and that's what we we were battling ourselves as an even as adults don't we there's times God shows us the Word of God but we refuse it we turn it down we say not now we couldn't do now couldn't happen now but how God wants us to accept it and obey it right now praise God how he wants us to find today as the day of the deliverance praise God he wants us to receive the word today not to refuse it but to accept it I like verse 34 blessed is the man that heareth me watching daily at my gates waiting at the posts of my doors amen so now solomon likens wisdom to a city a sin as you know in the old days they had gates and at nighttime they would close the gates nobody got out nobody got in right early in the morning at some point if they knew there was no danger and the watchman was watching on the watchtower they'd opened the gates and they'd start business they'd have the court right there at the gates they'd have interaction and trade and commerce right there at the gates and now the wisdom of God the Holy Spirit is saying blessed are they who watch daily at my gates blessed are those who are constantly waiting from the voice of the Holy Spirit amen blessed of those who are waiting to grow an understanding of the word of God and blessed are they who wait at the posts of my doors it's kinda like this now in America most people this is all they know about waiting that's all they know Black Friday Thanksgiving oh they'll wait in line that's all they know about waiting because this is where their treasure is hallelujah they'll get up at 4 a.m. to go get the deal now they'll just stay up all night used to be they get up before you now they just stay up all night and they'll wait for the treasures of the world as many hours as it takes right no I've seen where they pay people to keep their spot lines so they can leave and come back and get their spot they're so eager to wait for natural things and I've said it before it's a shame that people will get up at 4:00 a.m. but can't come early to church and pray you know they can't even get an early to church but they can get early the best buy something's wrong with that spiritual condition and that's a small line because if you know the launch of phones they go all the way around the corner if you've ever seen a phone launch for the latest phone it'll go literally around the corner that's what sinners do I said I think that's what carnal Christians will do they'll wait on natural things instead of on spiritual things but this is what you and I should look like in the spiritual sense right God's Word God's wisdom is like a city and it's got walls and I'm sorry this is so close I just swear on today to stay low warmer you know in the morning but God's Word we'd like God's houses like this and we've got to lay ourselves or we've got a spiritually stand in line at the gate of doubts house and say God I'm ready to come in I want to come in I want I want your understanding I want your knowledge I need your wisdom amen it depends what which one you need if you need electronics really bad or you need a phone really bad you'll wait for it but we need to be like those Saints that lined up outside random Tabernacle hallelujah spiritually and wait upon the word of the Lord amen see many of those people were sick and that's why they were waiting they were desperate but we've got to be able to be desperate without a physical sickness we've got to see our spiritual condition and weight upon the wisdom of God amen open your Bible in the morning you get up a little earlier or for some of you maybe stay up a little later and get some time alone with God and say Lord Here I am I'm finally waiting upon you and God's been saying this whole time I'm waiting for you to wait upon me is that right that's what the Bible said blessed is that man or woman who waits at the gates of God City praise God I know some of you probably get two appointments early don't you if the doctor's office opens at 9:00 you're there at 8:50 right you got an appointment at noon you'll be there at 11:45 and you'll sit there and wait and if the doctors late for half an hour you'll weigh because you need to see the doctor how much more doctor Jesus hey man I mean think about that that's how important your daily walk your daily communion with the Holy Spirit that's how important it is we've got to wait upon the will of God we need some more of this by God's grace I was just waiting for you to open the church doors brother I was so hungry to hear the word of God now when you see hunger like that then you see God move more amen because those who hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled amen and that's a reality this is what the scripture said this way tells us children be blessed and if you're gonna be blessed you've got to keep the word and you've gotta wait upon the wisdom of God now that's the end of that because that's the end of that section there I'm sorry I didn't read verse 35 let's read verse 35 for whosoever fine with me find its life and shall tain favor of the Lord so when you find wisdom at God's house or God's City you find life so wisdom is life amen I'm sorry that's the wrong slide their wisdom is life now remember brother Troy preach it how the Bible is the book of life and this name is life you could also call this book wisdom because if you find wisdom you have life right wisdom leads to life that's what the scripture says he that but he's got to be found the wisdom of God must be found it's never just stumbled into it's something where we've got to apply ourselves and we've got the hunger and just like a Mary we've got to come and forget about other things and sit at the feet of Jesus we got to find the wisdom of God and if we find it nobody can ever take it from you hey man they got that hallelujah verse 36 but he that sitteth against me wrong with his own soul all they that hate me love death isn't that striking when people hate the wisdom of God it shows they love death and they're destroying their own Souls they're saying they're saying god I don't want to live eternally with you right they're saying I'd rather spend eternity now we know they won't be eternal but they'll come to niall ation at some point but then what they're saying is I would rather be apart from Jesus Christ than with Jesus Christ there's only two choices I know about you but I want to be right the feet of Jesus amen but this is what wisdom leads to it leads to eternal life and if you really love wisdom it shows you love what God made you you love who God made you you love God's creation the Bible even says the husband must love his wife like he loves himself and Paul said every man loves himself even a senator loves himself and will give himself some new shoes or might like you know some of our family friends though the alcohol or cigarettes because they want to try to please their flesh they love themselves they'll spend money on themselves or look at themselves something nice for their birthday everybody loves or should love himself we should love ourselves in the fact that we are creation of God were bought by the blood of Jesus Christ we're his property amen so we should love God's property and take care of ourselves receiving the wisdom of God receiving the life of God amen glory but to hate that hate God's wisdom is to love death that's the opposite now in verse now the my son I move on here the my son statements now moved to chapter nineteen so they jump from chapter eight all the way to chapter 19 so we have your Bibles let's go to chapter nineteen here by the grace of the Lord you know many times you know people will and I think we don't we all can relate to this we just want to hear our voice from God or we want to hear you know like I have a supernatural dream or something like that I don't know what to do and lord show me what to do and so many times we're so we're so busy looking for something supernatural that we forget that God laid out hundreds if not a thousand of wise proverbs right in the Word of God that tells us what to do praising the heart not that there's anything wrong with seeking God for a vision or or seeking God for a voice or a gift of operation or something like that if you have confidence in somebody's gift or something there's nothing wrong with that but we must remember there's 31 chapters here of God sent Holy Ghost wisdom amen and like the Bible said together we have to set these things in front of our eyes instead of other things in front of our eyes the wise words of God must be in front of our eyes amen now we've gone through 15 of 23 my son statements those were in chapters 1 to 7 now let's go to number 16 here's the 16th time Solomon says my son chapter 19 verse 27 and church Ivan through Proverbs I've been taking notes on every single verse kinda like my own little commentary you know to help me to remember these things and understand these and every single day God knows my heart something real pops up like wow something new oh my I forgot about this what why is where this could help out this this could help out that this can help out me God's Word is just waiting to be received amen he just waiting for people to line up at his door at his gates and open the gates and let that man say come on in there's plenty of wisdom for you yeah amen there's plenty of wisdom but we got to come and wait at his gates that's right verse 27 now this is just one simple scripture and then we'll jump into chapter 23 but 19:27 another my son sees my son to hear the instruction that causes thee to air from the words of knowledge just a very simple scripture so young children I look at my son and I look at the children my children if anyone instructs you on how to sin or miss the mark then Solomon says don't listen to them if any of your friends encourage you to lie or steal or cheat or lust or anything like that you've got the cease from listening to them praise God very simple but this is the wisdom of God if anyone causes you to miss the mark you must stop listening to them separate yourself like God said separate yourself come out from among them and I will receive you say the Lord and you'll be children unto me praise the Lord that's exactly right now go to chapter 23 I just want to like I said emphasize all these times the Holy Spirit had Solomon say my son chapter 23 15 we're getting there by God's grace look at that 17 to 23 we're almost there amen glory 23:15 my son if thine heart be wise my heart shall rejoice even mine let's read 16 - yeah my Rane shall rejoice when thy lips speak write things let not thine heart envy sinners but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long I wonder what God wants me to do today I got one good answer for you fear God all day I don't know anything else to do then fear God all day that's one thing you know is on your daily agenda is it not church it ought to be every day on there fear God respect God Reverend Scott verse 18 first surely there is an end and thine expectation shall not be cut off now I'm gonna stop right there now a wise hearted son who speaks right things will rejoice the heart of his father the reigns actually means the word kidneys I didn't do much studying on the kidneys I was gonna look at that some of you know something you might know more about kidneys I don't know anything about kidneys but the word means reins or kidneys or inward parts shall rejoice so I just want to emphasize that to our children because we have numerous children here tonight and I'm sure livestreaming as well children you want to make your parents rejoice you want to make your parents very happy don't you when you say the right thing when you do the right thing it puts a deep joy in the hearts of the parents and it's only something a parent can understand right parents I see some older ones nodding there and I'm nodding it is a it is something it is such a happiness so down deep that the Bible gives it the most strong language this is the strong language the reins of the heart the very depths of your heart it rejoices the parents you know some of my happiest times I would say some of my favorite cards I've got you don't get greeting cards from people I really appreciate them my favorite ones probably the favorite one to me probably was from my dad a couple years ago I think I turned 35 and he hero me a card it's the first card he ever wrote me in my life and and anything he said he was how proud of me he was of me and and how God he was thankful what God was doing in my life and that meant so much to me because as a man you know as a man or even as a daughter no doubt you want to please your parents you want them to be happy with what you've become I don't want to let down my parents just like I don't want let down my wife I don't wanna let down my children I don't want to let down my boss I want them to be happy with what I do how many kids amen to that and so nothing will make the parent heart happier than to see their children speak the right thing so children that's one way you can live for other people how about how many know eternal life is living for others right children if you say the right thing do the right thing it will actually bring joy to your parents this is the Holy Spirit's instruction to children bring joy make your make your parents rejoice hallelujah the time you I've had the privilege of baptizing for my own children I've rejoiced every time it's just you know I think I've cried every time each one came to me first it was Malachi and then Acacia then Lydia and then Haven and each time I think I've wept just tears of joy that I it wasn't me pressuring them they felt the pull of the Holy Spirit and responded to the Holy Spirit and nothing can make a father a mother's heart more joyful than to see their children say the right thing and do the right thing amen it rejoices the rain's the very depths of the heart now he says fear God all day long children know that God's watching you all day long because there's the end there is a reaping to what you're sowing do not envy sinners because we know their end is death in hell don't envy them they're not happy if they were happy why would a multi-millionaire like Robin Williams commits suicide if money makes you happy how could a multi-million dollar person just in their life because they're so depressed money does not make you popular or happy neither does fame there's one thing that makes you happy that's walking in wisdom of the Holy Spirit that's what the Bible says that's the only thing that's gonna make you happy not for money not for fame that were a pleasure of this life but it's walking in the wisdom of God amen that's exactly right we know the end of sinners it's a parent I love this he says your expectations shall not be cut off so in other words it's hard sometimes to keep the word children but you've got to keep the word and just trust God will bless me amen your expectation your hope your faith will not be cut off God will reward you amen because the Bible said you can't plead against a possible repeat reason without that trust that faith that revelation breather cometh to God must believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen children God will reward you if you honor your parents God will reward you but you've got to do it diligently you've got to be faithful you've got to always say the right thing God will reward you and now for us adults we got to be better at diligently seeking God yep there's things that come up in the morning I know there's things that come up in the night things that come up in the day things that come up all the time but we've got to let the Holy Spirit joy come up in our hearts aim ahead and make time for prayer make time for worship make time for here in the Word of God it's exactly right now let's continue on now he says it again the 18th time in verse 19 of the same chapter he says my son again so these are all like little paragraphs written to his son let's go to verse 19 23 19 here my son and be wise and guide thy heart in the way now look at verse 20 veena among wine-bibber 'he's among riotous eaters of flesh to all the fancy foods right all the drinkers for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty and drowsiness shall close a man with rags hearken unto thy father that begat thee and despise not thy mother when she's old buy the truth and sell it not also wisdom and instruction and understanding the father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice Oh hallelujah and he they began at the wise child shall have joy of him thy father and thy mother shall be glad and she that bear thee shall rejoice think of the prodigal son when was the father the happiest when the father say we need to have a feast we need to kill the fatted calf children when did he say that he said it when his son came home and obeyed the word of the Lord he humbled himself and said father I've sinned against heaven and earth I'm the guilty one amen and children that's what you need to do say I'm guilty take responsibility for your sins and cause to God for mercy amen it's exactly right and that was when he was the happiest he said go get a ring go get a rope he's not a servant make him a son restore his sonship and that's what Christ did not say man when we came back from the pig pens of sin put a ring on him put a seal on him put a covenant on him given the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and let him get his position back that he had before the foundation of the world that's right amen glory now look at he says here he said obey be wise guide your heart now first remember we read last week he said keep your heart so he first said imprison your heart and now he says guide your heart so you've got to imprison it and then guide it where it's going to go so as you keep it in and keep everything out all the evil things out and you keep yourself sealed into God's presence now you've got to guard your heart guard your emotions that you don't get out of control Holly they gotta see you gotta guide your heart your you gotta control your feelings control your emotions control your thoughts and when you do this you actually produce or bear the fruit of temperance that's right so you keep your heart you keep it in prison you you have a wall around it right you protect your heart you don't let anything in but then you've got to go somewhere you've got to guide your heart as well remember proverbs 25 I love this twenty-eight he that has no rule over his own spirit is like a city that's broken down without walls when people can't control their feelings their emotions or their thoughts they're open to every attack of Satan any trick Satan can throw at them they get they get caught they get defeated because they haven't built up what's called the guidance of the heart they haven't watched their heart they haven't got enough wisdom to know that I've got to control this I've got to keep it and I've got to guard it and I've got to be ready to defeat the devil in that day of temptation amen we've got to control our feelings emotions and thoughts be wise listen to the Word of God be wise and guide your heart in the right way guide it in the way it should go now here's more on this now right after this he says oh it's avoid drunk errs and sinful feast with gluttons which lead to poverty and rags so those who overeat those who over drink come to poverty and rags hearken to your father despise not your mother when she's old remember Jesus's words about Korbin member corben in mark chapter 7 remember that the Pharisees were telling the people oh you don't have to take care of your mother and father just take the money that you would have given to your parents and give that as an offering to the temple because those Pharisees were selfish they were lovers of money right and so Jesus had to correct them and said you've made the Word of God of none effect by your tradition see they were despising their parents when they were old for whatever reason they didn't want to give their money to their parents when their parents took care of them and the Bible said children hearken to your father don't despise your mother when she gets old but listen to them honor them by the truth the Bible says and don't sell it to get wisdom instruction and understanding see with all thy getting get something that's one thing we're supposed to get every day is the wisdom of God we're supposed to go to the gate wait at the gate wait to the doors open and then walk in and get as much wisdom as you can what a what a blessing what a promise that we can walk into God's gates and courts and take out all the wisdom that he can give us by God's grace amen don't sell out your morals children don't sell it out by the truth make a transaction exchange while your unbelief for truth and don't sell it out amen but leave this message and don't sell it out praise God I don't know let people tell you bad things about brother Branham you listen to what brother Branham said listening to the tapes and I brother Branham here what a real prophet of God says look how he lives his life look how humble he is look at him don't sell it out don't sell it the Bible truth if the Bible says it we believe it that settles it don't sell it out children it's hard we know like with our children it's hard you know they're attracted to sports or they're attracted to fashion and cutting the hair maybe it and wearing tight clothes and they might be attracted to all these things but ultimately it comes down to two voices it's either the voice of God or it's the voice of death Satan and the children have to trust that the trust God that God's ways will lead to life amen don't sell it out it's brought you this far children it'll bring you all the way home to heaven hey the head glory amen so buy the truth make a spiritual transaction whether Bram said that's what later see is not doing today like I said they want to make natural transactions at best buy at the Apple store well Graham said Jesus's counsels turfs very serious to the point he dresses he directs his last day Church to one hope we have one hope and that hope is Christ he says come unto me and buy it's evident from this phrase buy of me that the Laodicean church is not at all dealing with Jesus for the spiritual products of the kingdom amen the spiritual products the spiritual blessings of God so we said temperance is a spiritual product how many want to make a transaction for temperance and glory amen I don't want to make a transaction for divine healing price of the heart for faith revelation you see these are all things that need to be made transactions for and the best way to do it is on our knees in prayer another way to do it is to receive the word while the preachers preaching it say that's right I believe it it's revealed to my heart I'm going to stay with that word amen we've got to make a transaction in other words we've got to cast out unbelief doubt criticism fear pain unbelief we've got to cast that down and say I'm getting rid of that Jesus you take care of that I'll receive your products amen glory all spiritual products are so available today you know let's get a lot easier to make natural transactions you can do Apple pay on your phone and you can send somebody on the spirit on a natural transaction just over your phone within a matter of seconds if I want I can send 50 bucks to my wife in a matter of seconds it's just like that and that's how easy it really is see that's just that's copying what God did that's how easy it is for us to have a transaction of receiving God's Word in our hearts hey man boy I don't know about you but you know we had wonderful meetings this past Saturday and Sunday but every time I leave when I'm not preaching I've received something from God every time my hope my strength my courage my discipline my dedication my loyalty every time I hear the word of God God is adding something to me I'm making some spiritual transaction amen I'm not going to leave this door unless I made a transaction say Jesus help me to be more like you forgive me of this I'm grabbing the hold of your promise amen you've got to do that or else you're gonna get real low real low see that's what later to see a dozen one they want all the natural products they'll make every exchange they'll go to every means like I said anyway they'll go PayPal you know the godiscover PNC they'll go every way they can to make natural transactions but Jesus saying buy the truth make a transaction so you'll live the truth that's what the scripture says by the truth sell it not brother Branham even says look he says what about all these churches and schools and hospitals and missionary ventures etc God is not in them as long as their denominational seed in spirit if they're just doing it to say well we're better than the Lutheran's or we're the biggest mega church and we're better than the other churches in the area because we sent twenty thousand dollars instead of ten thousand dollars if they're doing it with that spirit God doesn't even receive a church right it's got to be the right act with the right spirit or else you're just trying to do God a service without it being his will that's how we should - we shouldn't well I'm gonna come early the price I can be more spiritual than Jesse it's not a competition it's so I can die to myself and Christ can live in me Amen because I'm fighting myself and I've got to overcome myself amen that's your motivation to come to way at the gates of Christ's City his city of wisdom hey man glory look at verse 26 here I love this part right here my son give me thine heart and let thine eyes observe my ways I love don't you love that Solomon he he could have asked for anything right we know and he says one thing he sent said son give me your heart in other words love me more than you love anything else that's what I'd say to my son Malachi give me your heart watch how I live my life watch how I love Jesus Christ and that's what every parent desires how many parents desire that children look around at your parents hands look at look at your parents hands around look at your parents hands every parent wants you to give them your heart in other words love them above everything else except God because when you're loving them you are loving God look at Solomon he could have had anything he had all the money and riches and he said give me your heart I want your love I want your devotion watch my life amen what a beautiful is portion of Scripture give me your heart and let thine eyes observe my ways now look he says this in part because next he's gonna get into this strange woman again so he must be talking to teenage boys here because we know what is Sampson knew he gave Delilah his heart right instead of giving God his heart look at verse 23 no I'm sorry verse 27 for a is a deep ditch and a strange woman is a narrow pit she also lies in wait as for a prey and increases the transgressions among men so he says give me your heart don't give your heart to lusting after women don't give your heart to lusting after a man how many people have we seen coming the message and then they leave the message for the sake of lust just a relationship with somebody oh I've seen so many of friends from the past so many people that got baptized people I looked up to and I thought my these people are really spiritual and within a matter of years they're not even coming to church and don't even don't even live the message you see because they never gave God their heart and and you better you and I better understand God's going to test every one of us to really show what's inside of our heart right all the tests and trials are to prove what's in you if you fail a test it proved your heart wasn't strong enough in that area praise God and God trying to show you your weakness so that you'll you'll make a transaction amen you'll leave that and you'll accept God's Word and you'll obey God's Word amen give me your heart son because these bees women these he says are deep ditches these immoral women he says not only are they their narrow pits they are predators they are the lions that Paul was talking about the devil is like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour the devil doesn't come like a lion he isn't like a roaring lion but he's disguised behind evil women evil men is that right that's how Satan's disguise children he's disguised as this beautiful girl but with the evil heart or a handsome young man who's got an evil heart that's the roaring lion in our day many times he's a predator and he will cause increasing of transgression Court of the Bible that's what it says in verse 28 she also lieth in wait as a prey and increases the transgression the Hmong men so she's causing other people to increase their sinning and remember they're religious like we saw last week she paid her vows she paid her ties she paid her offerings she paid all those things but she says I've got this bed and and her talk was smooth as oil and all these-- and she she's painted this picture all the husband won't be home yet she's so religious right she goes to church just because someone goes the message church children don't mean you want to get involved with him they've got to come God's provided way they've got to come through a character life they got to come through a real godly experience and they got to come through your parents now I'm preaching that because Lydia's 13 now and there might be some boys that start liking her in the next few years so I'm preparing her heart and I'm preparing my heart to anyone that keeps sinning and anyone that makes you want to sin instead of obey the word is the wrong person for you I don't care how much they come to church I don't care if they play it and sing specials we've all seen people that sing specials and don't live the right word we've seen preachers that preach and they don't live the right word it's not how religious it's how loyal they are to truth have they bought the truth and not sold it out amen see a godly woman my son maokai a godly woman will make you want to be more righteous okay even when you're wrong her chaste or innocent now chase means innocent or real Christian woman is so innocent or chaste that even when you're wrong her innocent spirit will make you want to do what's right it'll humble you and make you want to repent and do what's right and the church said that's in first Peter 3 1 & 2 she should be so holy so pure so innocent as she makes you want to repent and get right with God now how many stirrers are we gonna find like that out in the world we can find any artifice gonna find any that are so innocent and pure wearing short-shorts showing off their body parts hello how many innocent women are we gonna find out in the world now how many innocent women are gonna find the church well and our church hopefully will find a lot more but see this is the wisdom this is wisdom from 3,000 years ago church right 3,000 years ago we're thankful for the wisdom of God now he ends the chapter with this whole section on alcohol so verses 30 through 35 major on alcohol I preached on that recently when I looked at the the liberties now remember wine is a Liberty as long as it's used for medicinal purposes and as long as you don't use it to cause somebody to stumble right because that's what Paul says Paul says if you're drinking wine will cause somebody stumble you said I won't drink any wine or eat any meat or whatever as long as the world stands because we know Jesus drank wine so it must have been a very small amount of wine or it was either watered-down one of the other is either small amount or is watered-down couldn't be I don't see how it could be anything else as I read all these history things these articles and commentaries so you know this but just so just to back it up psalmist says who has woes who has troubles who has sorrows who has contentions and fights who babbles with their mouths who has wounds and red eyes who has the who has them they all belong to drunkards drunkards people that can't quit the bottle and then in verse 33 the Bible said that wine will increase your sexual immorality so it's only going to wine will only magnify your lust battle and it will all magnify perverse words that you say it doesn't help it actually magnifies and makes it worse that's what verse 33 says let's read that by the eyes shall behold strange women and thine heart shall utter perverse things when he's drinking here's a little I mean this is common sense but I looked up I just looked up a medical journal and it said they did a 10-year study on public health problems associated with early drinking from the seventh grade so Lydia what grade are you in seven okay so Wow so it's from your to 7th to 12th grade this is just the abstract now I didn't go in the deed I don't even read the whole thing I just read the abstract okay I just read the results and it says early drinkers now this is in seventh grade to 12th grade and experimenters so see children don't even experiment with it don't even give Satan a chance to get in your life experimenters were more likely than non-drinkers to report academic problems so they fail in school they have more substance abuse they get into more drugs once they start drinking and delinquent behavior in both middle school in high school by young adulthood early alcohol use was associated with employment problems they can't keep a job you can't trust a person to do a job that drinks too much or smokes or does marijuana or you name it the opioid I can't even say how do you say that Oh Boyd okay I can't say it sorry but anyone who's addicted to these type of things and it's not a laughing matter I'm not laughing at that I'm what I'm saying is that you can't trust them to keep a job and they'll get into other substance abuse and they'll have criminal and violent but criminal and violent behavior do any of our children want to be dropouts and stop learning at school then you are children do that many of our children want handcuffs on them to be taken off to jail I don't hope not well then the thing to do is avoid alcohol praise the Lord avoid it now you have it at communion that's the only time you have it and that's to remind you eat each week about the living power of the blood of Jesus Christ amen not each week every time each time we have it but we're having this Sunday night so we're having a community this Sunday night at 4 p.m. by God's grace that was in the email so see children if you want to stay out of jail if you want to stay in school and learn if you were to make mom happy and dad happy avoid wine avoid relationships that are wrong and love your parents with all your heart amen but God is first I'm not exalting parents above God I under hope you understand what I'm saying love your parents give your parents your heart praise God and that's what science I mean science says this look at verse 34 this is quite a it's kind of kind of funny statement you know the Bible we've seen that little sarcasm in the book of Proverbs chapter 31 we saw some a few Sundays ago but look at verse 34 yay so if you're if you're drinking too long yea thou shalt be as he that lie down in the midst of the sea I feel I'm tired I need a nap I'm just gonna go sleep in the middle of the ocean or he that lieth upon the top of a mast on a ship so kinda looks like this and I covered up he's gotten easy-to-understand on so when you drink too much it's like you're saying I just want to go sleep in the middle of the ocean I'm really tired I think I'll go lay down I think that's going to turn out good for him I don't care the children are doing swimming lessons I don't care how long you can float you can't float that loan to get back to land if you're out in the middle of Pacific or the Atlantic or wherever you are and then the Bible said it's like well I think I was just laid out on a mass and I'm sorry he's got a shirt on I forgot to cover right up there I didn't want to offend any sisters so I I forgot I forgot to put that up there but how about going take a nice nap on the top of a mass which it was your would you like that you know yeah it's gonna give you real big back pain after a while and that is how foolish it is to start experimenting with alcohol and drugs and evil women and also perverse words that's how foolish the violets that's as foolish as the Bible could make it it's like taking a nap in the middle of the ocean sleeping on a mast avoid those things with all your heart amen let me go ten more minutes I'll try to finish up here by the grace of the Lord I just want to give the children some visuals so you remember you know this is the wisdom of God this is life you can't put a price on the value of this sermon tonight because it's not my words it's God's words with all your getting get wisdom children right nothing is to be desired nothing that we could desire can be compared to the wisdom of God hallelujah now let's try to maybe finish this up I think I got a couple more I'm on 20 of 23 I was hoping to get done tonight okay go to chapter 24 now chapter 24 he finished chapter 23 these are all the times Solomon in his wisdom addressed my son verse 10 that's right verse 13 24 verse 13 my son eat the honey because it is good and the honeycomb because of the sweet to thy taste so shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul when thou has found it then there shall be a reward and the expectation should not be cut off so if I'm preaching wisdom tonight and you're eating it it should taste like honey in your mouth that's if you're a believer these words are like honey oh it's so sweet God's Word is so true I've tasted I know it's true I've tasted that the Lord is good amen right glory November he says your faith will be rewarded but he doesn't say when you've got to trust him that in God's time he'll reward you for keeping his word that's right now go to verse 15 and 16 lay not way Oh wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous spoil not his resting place for a just man Follis seven times and rises up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief so see the point that he's making is that a wicked man will remain wicked but a righteous man will may he might stumble in the wickedness but you know he's going to rise again and seven is the number of completion right so you have a complete victory over whatever he stumbles over amen complete victory is promised to the righteous we may fall but we get up by God's grace now this is quite striking this is something I've never this is one of those times that have just jumped off the pages in verse I believe it's uh where did I verse 17 yeah yeah 17 yeah this is quite striking and I was trying to think of a Bible example this and I couldn't think of one but just look at what the Bible says verse 17 18 rejoice not when thine enemy falls oh we got to be careful with this one and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbles now the trouble is sometimes the enemy's right in your own church or right in your own family and the church said Amen I'll say it verse 19 fret not thyself because of evil men I'm sorry I ever skipped 18 lest the Lord see it so if the Lord sees you happy that when your enemies fell you're happy oh thank God that brother fell I'm so glad this evil thing happened to his sister look what God's gonna do on this earth now I don't say this don't say anything about the eternal consequences it's just saying about counts the consequences on this earth look what it says in verse 18 lest the Lord see you and it displeased him and he turn away his wrath from him Wow we should feel sorry when our enemies go through hard times in church that takes a real move the Holy Spirit in your life because every bone in you says well this brother did that this sister said that they do they're just getting what they deserve they're just reaping what they saw but if God sees us rejoicing about that God will see that and he'll lessen their punishment on this earth that was striking is like I never read that before so it helped me to humble myself and say Lord the enemies I have helped me not to rejoice help me to love them and help me to pity their condition they don't know how to repent they don't know how to serve you they don't know how to treat a real man of God or a woman of God or a child of God they don't know how do that have them forgive them they don't know what they're doing so it seems like the only time we can really rejoice it is once Satan's cast into the lake of fire now you the one time you can say holiday play but we obviously we won't be happy when we see ones that we knew humans going to hell we won't be happy because Paul said I'd rather be cursed me than to see them my brother's lost we'll be we might be sad we might ah but the one time we can rejoice is when the the devil and his angels are cast in that lake of fire and now there's no more temptation to any man or woman amen not striking Church if you don't get nothing out of it hope you got that do not rejoice when your enemy stumbles or God will shorten their punishment striking verse 21 24 21 my son fear thou the Lord and the king and metal not with them that are given to charge so don't play around with leaders of the government right don't mess around with them that's why I don't get into bashing I don't mass Trump on Facebook I never bashed Obama on Facebook I don't bash anybody I try not to bash them like that if I've got to bash somebody then it's not really me bashing I believe it's behind the Pope but I believe it's the holy spirit bringing correction to them because brother BAM said there's got to be a voice cry out against the sin done in this city there's got to be some voice crying out against the evils but see he said don't mess don't start meddling and and don't know try to get into situations like that look at verse 22 for the calamity shall rise suddenly and who knoweth the ruin of them both my of King these things also below verse 23 to the wise it is not good to have respect to persons he that saith unto the wicked that righteous him shall the people curse nation's job for him but to them that rebuked him shall be delight and a good blessing should come upon them so see church if you want a good blessing there's times you got to rebuke people right that's what the Bible said to them that rebuke him a wicked person a good blessing should come upon them see and for me I'll just be honest it's really hard for me to rebuke people so I if I have the strength to do it then I know it was really God in me when I do it right to their face right all right over the phone or however you do it but a good blessing will come on you for standing up for truth amen so there are times when we rebuke God will bless us verse 26 every man shall kiss of his lips that giveth a right answer I like verse 27 this is for your work ethic now remember this is part of his sentence to his son prepare thy work without and make it fit for thyself in the field and afterward build on house so before you build a house prepare the land right before you build something if it's gonna last you've got to build it the right way you've got to work at it you've got to to give it a sure foundation you've got to do it the right way so whenever you work do it the right way don't do a half-hearted job as we tell you son prepare the field before you build the house you need a solid foundation and the best solid solid foundation I know is the Word of God look what he says let's keep going there that was verse 34 third 30 yeah 30 now I'm sorry I was burst 2728 beam out a witness against thy neighbor without cause and to see not with thy lips o children watch your mouth always say the truth say now I will do so to him as he had done to me I'll render to every man according to his works okay so we must follow the golden rule children do unto others as you would have them do unto you don't go after neighbor just because he is something wrong to your property don't go after him and return him back return kindness for evil return a program should return a slap with the kiss he says right now verse 30 is another 30 to 34 is more on work ethic I went by the field of the slothful by the vineyard of the man void of understanding and lo was all grown over a thorns and nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall there was broken down then I saw this and considered it well I looked upon it and received instruction so children remember you can learn from every situation the children are supposed to learn from their parents how we know we just read that tonight he said son observe my ways give me your heart well now Solomon saying if you walk by a field and a man hasn't kept his garden he hasn't kept his field he said consider that lazy man and learn from it in the last three or four years I've walked into some pretty messy apartments trying to help out people and they're lazy but they they have all the trash around but they're sitting at the video games playing video games oh how sad is that church how sad is that everything is falling apart or you know having trouble paying the rent or having trouble keeping a job everything's falling apart over the last few years I've just seen it with my own eyes and instead of condemning them we should look at that and learn from that and say God I'm gonna work harder when I get home let's say into our feet that's my time learn from remember Jesus of all people jesus said remember who remember Lot's wife a bad example so the Holy Spirit again pulls up a bad example of a man who can't keep his he can't keep his field clean right he can't keep his crops coming he's so lazy he can't keep his house in order his life in order right and he says you take a look at this and you understand this learn from this now he goes bit further he said these people like to sleep all the time yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep so shall thy poverty come as one that travaileth and I want as in our man oh just so tired I just got to get more sleep I slept 12 hours last night I just need to take another nap I had the I didn't have to go to work due to a course I haven't worked for the last three weeks collected my unemployment or I don't know what they're doing selling drugs or whatever stealing I know people have done that they steal from the store and says they don't have a job how wicked is that and the Holy Spirit said learn from that you don't want your life to become that you and me somebody looks at the field they prepare it they get everything set order and then you build a godly life you build a testimony that can stand the test of time that's a real Christian well we're almost done so maybe next week we'll just we'll see what the Lord has by the grace Lord but how many love the wisdom of the Lord amen how many few like their taste and honey in the rock tonight hey let's give it our round of laws amen amen you know a lot of these are to the children my church they also help you and I especially as parents because if I know if I want my son to be like me well I better live the right kind of way and times I haven't failed I've tried to confess it to Malachi Lydia if I've you haven't lived it right in front of the children I try to say sorry I was so tired I was angry in the van forgive me I was upset I was tired of having to sleep you know I was upset in the wrong spirit we've got to humble ourselves and then children you got to give your hearts to your parents amen God is so good to us praise the Lord God is so good the god is so good god is so good he's so good to me I love him so and I love him so I love him so I love him so he's so good to me yet your sprayer and he answers he answers prayer he answers prayer he's so good he's coming to get me I know
