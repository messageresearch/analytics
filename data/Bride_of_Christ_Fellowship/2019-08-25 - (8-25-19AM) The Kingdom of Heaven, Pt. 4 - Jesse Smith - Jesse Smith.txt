of God again part 4 kingdom of heaven rather part 4 [Music] it's good to see the Saints this morning praise the Lord God bless everybody nice to see Karen and Brenda and Sarah for me it's been an extra week haven't seen ya so Lord bless you I'm have to use the handheld mic this morning so like I like Wednesday night it's Matthew chapter 25 let's just read one scripture here just for times sake Matthew 25 let's look at verse 15 let's just read 25 15 and let's read that together if we can Matthew 25 15 is that on Lydia okay thank you Matthew 25 15 let's read that on three and then we'll read one more scripture in Matthew 25 15 on three ready one two three and unto one he gave five talents to another two and to another one to every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journey praise God let's go to Luke 19 so that's the parable of the talents Luke 19 has the parable of the pounds some people think they're exactly identical but they're they're not they're close but they're not exactly identical they're spoken at different times in two different groups of people so we like to look at that this morning the Lord will help us to do that I like to read verse 15 I thought well after your Sita will read a little more this and it came to pass that when he was returned having received the kingdom then he commanded these servants to be called unto him to whom he had given the money that he might know how much every man had gained by trading then came the first saying Lord thy pound ass gained 10 pounds and he sent him well thou good servant because thou has been faithful in a very little have the authority over ten cities and came the second saying via I'm sorry Lord thy pound hath gained five pounds and he said likewise to him be thou also over five cities may God has blessings rimas work you may be seated I don't see brother Aaron this morning so I'll send him a text after service anybody heard from him I may not be here no if you had to work maybe a double shift today and that so praise the Lord it's good to be with the ideas I want to show a few slides I do not have all the quotes ready to go for slides but I do want to show a few by the grace of the Lord just a minute I'd like to pull up my notes here okay so well let's look at here at part four I believe we're on part 4 yeah of the Kingdom of Heaven now just as a kind of a little bit of overview I like to direct your attention that little lamp there there's a lamp like the foolish virgins would have had it's kind of like dated to that time period and so you know we've been looking at some of those thoughts last few Wednesday's ago we looked at the wise virgins and the foolish and so the wise would have had these vessels they would had to trim the wicks you know the wicks would have burnt down so with the foolish of trim them but then the foolish had other vests I'm sorry the wise had other vessels of oil that they could pour into we're the foolish didn't have that and so that was made them wise everybody had everybody had a lamp right everybody had a wick but not everybody had extra oil and I'm glad I got extra oil not maybe on my flat ash sure oil maybe on my mind but I've got extra oil in my soul and that's what I'm packing for the rapture ain't a head praise the Lord because even even though even to make believer like Judas you know where Jesus says you've done many wonders miracles prophesied in my name cast out devils he'll tell them I never knew you so even they can have oil in their minds you know they can get in the Spirit of God long enough to do miracles but then when they leave that anointing off then they go off and work iniquity and the things of the world so we do want the anointing in all parts of us well we want to make sure we have the Holy Ghost in our souls aim ahead and that our life testifies to that that we live the life of a real Christian the greatest miracle of course is the miracle of a change life hallelujah now as even last week with brother Brooks you know he was we were just fellowship inning and he was saying how we were just talking about you know the book that I wrote and he was sharing how he gave it out to many people and he was saying brother Jesse I could never do that and it just kind of struck something in my in my mind you know how how we'll look at today we're looking at the talents again today he said I could never do that but I look at his life and I could never sing like him and even some of the miracles like he's seen great miracles you know you know he's prayed for people with cancer and they've been instantly healed I've never done that myself and I may never do that but then he can recognize those things that God may use me to do that he could never do we all believe in miracles you know we all believe in the power of God but we're you know we're trying to learn here and through the series on the purpose and now on the kingdom of heaven that we can find our purpose in life we can we can see our our gift in life and then be obedient to what God has us to do and so that just really encouraged me you know that brother Brooks would say something like that because it just kind of gave me like one of those moments where you kind of realize that's right I try to do I'm just trying to follow the leading Lord what God would have me to do and I just want to be faithful to that and let's look here I like to you know go I just want to go over a little bit on these you know I was writing I'm writing the next book but I wrote a chapter on the kingdom of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven because Jesus called it a mystery and I wrote on this there's seven mysteries in in Matthew 13 well something struck me a few months ago I think it was in June and I thought matters there may be more mysteries or parables about the kingdom of heaven and so I thought well I better go check the Bible before I print this book out and I found I found nine more there 16 parables that Jesus calls parables of the kingdom like he'll say the kingdom of heaven is like unto this the kingdom of heaven is like unto that and so I went and setting them out and I'm almost done with the chapter now I think I'm on the 15th parable I got one more to go and so I just want to show you the themes real briefly I'll be probably preaching on them Lord willing in the next few months we'll see where the Lord will take us but two of them deal with sin these two deal with sin the grain of mustard seed twice in the church age book where the RAM said this parable deals with the false church and then the leaven hid in three measures of course that's where the Roman Catholic Church so two of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven deal with how sin gets in the false Church and how it tries to pervert the true church but the true church overcomes amen three of the parables deal with the Holy Ghost and the rapture the King son of course is the wedding garment parable and the garment represents the baptism of the Holy Ghost cuz a man without the wedding garment he's thrown out of the the wedding he doesn't get to be a part of the wedding because he's not boy again the ten virgins of course we're off remember that one and then the great supper that one's not coming to me right now the great supper off they look that one up I already wrote about it but I just can't remember it right now two of them deal with the end kind end time conditions Jesus specifically says the wheat and the tares are a parable for the end time because at the end time he says there's a harvest and the net cast into the sea Jesus specifically says this parable deals with the end of the world how the angels gather at the end of the world and then they they separate the good fish to the Lord and the rest sarcastic into the waters one of the parables or the mysteries deals with the wicked husbandmen that's with Jews and Gentiles because the Jews don't want the the kingdom the the rich man takes it from them and gives it to another people and that's us by God's grace aren't you glad to be a part of the kingdom of God I'm more happy about that than anything I know amen that I can have a part in the kingdom of God amen and there's five a deal with salvation the treasure hid in the field so this is salvation to the Gentile and of course they're the Jews at the begin the church age the pearl of great price the laborers in the vineyard the unmerciful servant and the seed cast into the ground and then three of them deal with your stewardship which we're looking at two of them one of them were we're really familiar with the four grounds of course I preached on that numerous times but this the service and stewardship is the parables here we want to look at again today by God's grace so if we could let's go back to Luke 19 why don't we just start right there let's go to verse 11 new Luke 19:11 now if you if you read earlier in the chapter which I'm not going to read all that you know Zacchaeus gets saved Jesus is with a multitude of people memories walking and Zacchaeus climbs up in the tree you know the little guy any-any and he cries out you know and and I'm sorry Jesus stops and points him out because Jesus discerned his life or the mem Talde the story of that what a beautiful story Zacchaeus his wife was praying for more he called her Rebecca remember that Rebecca was praying for his the key is to get saved and it's a great beautiful drama and he gets saved and and Jesus was gonna go to his house you know but then in verse 11 Luke 19:11 sir surrounding Jesus and he's very soon to be crucified it sits within maybe a weaker week-and-a-half here he's very very close to to his his death but he's with ya in fact later in the chapter is the triumphal entry so he's about a week away from his from his crucifixion less than a week and so he has all these people and they're there they're thinking oh my this is gonna be the season where that awful Roman kingdoms gonna be brought down and we're gonna bring back the kingdom of David see they they were thinking natural Kingdom right everything my Jesus has raised the dead he raised Lazarus not long ago he's done all these great things for three years all this famous red a ball or brown about about about him rather and they think my this is the time when we'll know lot longer bout a Caesar we want to pay taxes the Caesar right we wish you'd have to pay our taxes that can all give it to God right but we can we can relate to how they would feel that way and and they're thinking my this is the time and we want to be ruled and we have to be take a census anymore what to pay taxes anymore you know we're gonna rebuild a greater temple and even Herod's temple you know they thought they were really going to right here so Jesus tells us parable to kind of correct their thinking Jesus was the word right always correcting people's thinking aren't you glad amen and I hope that's why you come to church that's why I come so Jesus can correct my thinking because sometimes I don't think the right thoughts neither to use sometimes you know we all fall short of God's glory they thought my this is the kingdom of God is gonna appear physically in other words they thought the millennia was going to be on my the memes coming thousand years of peace and I will build our houses you know and but see they were there about two thousand years off you know but God was merciful to them amen Jesus was merciful so he tells them this story to correct their thinking verse 12 and he said therefore a certain nobleman went into the far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return and he called his ten servants so see there's a similarity with the talents there's ten ten virgins ten sermons and he delivered them ten pounds instead of them occupy till I come now notice the whole group gets ten pounds ten servants ten pounds and earlier we read that each servant got one pound now a pound I did the research a pound is very small it was only like $15,000 now to you to most of us that would be small maybe great to some now you understand what I'm saying but it's much smaller than the talent the talent we saw in Wednesday was about a million dollars so that's why you know Jesus later on says you've been faithful with very little but I'll make you rule over much geez doesn't say that and the parable of the talents he doesn't say that he only says it in this parable because this has spoken to a multitude imagine a whole multitude is listening to him and he says let me tell you this parable I'm in to give all my servants one pound and they thought that's not very much money I mean you could get a good car for that you could get a good chariot for that out of money that's not really like a million dollars you know I wouldn't wouldn't be like a mansion or anything like that and you could even get a mansion for a million dollars today but he just tells the parable then everybody gets one everybody gets a little bit of the kingdom of God amen he says occupy until I come now verse 14 now here's where it's a little different as well you don't find this same statement in the talents but his citizens hated him now who's that the Jews Jesus's Jesus came to his own but his own received him not so he tells his servants which were going to be the the believers the Christians whether they are George então occupy till I come I'm giving you my income I'm giving you my power my authority in other words the authority of the gospel when you citizens hate him a set of messages or sent a message after I'm saying we will not have this man to reign over us so so Jesus goes away but then the Jews and the message they send this message to Jesus we don't want him to rule over us a church what about us a lot of people come to message churches but are they letting the word reign over them amen praise God are they really doing what brother Branham said or not I think we see it in their lives right we see in people's lives they have a form of godliness but they deny the power to change their life they don't let the word rule the word doesn't get first place praise God so we see the the application to today and it came to pass that when he was returned having received the kingdom then he commanded these servants to be called unto him to whom he had given the money that he might know how much every man had gained by trading then came the first saying Lord thy pound hath gained 10 pounds so about a hundred fifty thousand dollars he had at the end so from fifteen thousand to a hundred fifty thousand and he said to him well thou good servant because thou has been faithful in a very little so see that's just a little bit amount of money right 15,000 - Jesus that's just a little amount of money you can get a used car for that much money that's that's not too much that's a little you've been faithful in a very little he says have that authority over ten cities but if you and I can be faithful with the very little he's given us he'll Griffi give us great rewards God is faithful God is looking for us just to be faithful and us to be diligent with what he's given to us we don't we must be content remember godliness with contentment is great gain amen these servants had to be content with I just got fifteen thousand I'll just invested he gets back now I'm not a businessman I have no idea if you gave me fifteen thousand and said invest it I wouldn't know what to do I really wouldn't I just take it to the bank and put in the bank but at least you get some interest on that but some of you aren't real savvy with your mind you know with your business you could invest in that make investment there and turn a profit I don't know if I could do that but Jesus says you just gotta invest in that and be faithful with that and he said then I'll make you ruler over much so we can just you know if we can just manage a small ministry if we can just manage a small amount of money then Jesus says I'll make you ruler over much so we must not be overwhelmed right we must not let ourselves get overwhelmed we just have to realize this is a very small amount I've just got to apply the word of God until he returns now he says verse 18 and the second came saying Lord thy pound hath gained five pounds and he said likewise him be thou also over five cities so one person had a tenfold increase one person had a five-fold increase alls Jesus won to see was an increase amen on an area because the last man has no increase amen all Jesus wants you to do is just so show some effort and show that you're invested and you're fully devoted to the things of God amen whether it's five times you you know five times the testimonies are or your five times more sensitive to the things of God or ten times or you see ten times as many testimonies as you did you know all Jesus wants you to see is that you just don't bury in the earth put it to use do something for the kingdom of God amen that's all I wants us to see nah not not not - he doesn't want us to be overwhelmed with with with shame or with fear or with doubt he doesn't want us to doubt he just wants us to do something with what we have amen I would say the first thing to do it like I said before I think this is where God's taking us there's first to recognize what we do have we've got to recognize and I got a quote for that later on brother Graham says that something very similar first find out what you've got amen we need to find out what God's given us amen that's gonna come through prayer it's gonna come through seeking God's face amen we got to find out what he's given to us now some of us it's obvious like like we said on Wednesday with Amen in Malachi those who can sing our sisters Naomi I can sing song specials you know that's kind of obvious you know where gods bless them but the thing is they may have more gifts than that right you may have more than that and so the thing to do is find now all that you have find all that the rich man's the nobleman has left you with and then go to investing in what he's left you with glory now look at verse 20 and another came saying Lord behold there's that here's thy pound which I've kept laid up in a napkin that's that interesting napkin seems to represent death doesn't it because when Jesus rose from the dead he the Bible said they went to his is suppl occur and they found the napkin so napkin seems to represent death he just he was dead you know he just he didn't live for Jesus like he ought to have he's really we're not Li we're not actually living until we're doing what God told us to do right because you can be dead yet yet still be alive amen you can be dead spiritually but physically alive right so you went and put it in a in now verse 21 fry fear daeso see this is the kind of fear that the book of Revelation talks about how the fearful will not inherit the kingdom of God praise God he said I feared thee this is the wrong kind of fear this isn't godly fear for I fear thee because thou are an austere man of Sirius Hardman now take us up that thou layest not down and reap is that that did not sow not I said it on Wednesday that's not true this man is lying this man is deceived God only reaps where he sews let me say this the whole world's God's anyway amen every state is God's Amen every seed gets lice from God so any good thing every good and perfect gift is from the Lord amen so this man's wrong he's deceived any good thing comes from God all evil comes from Satan if there's anything good if there's any life if there's any harvest it came by God's doing amen this man is deceived he's a sinner he's fearful he's not the spirit of fear rule his life as an excuse not to be a part of the kingdom of God see but the exact opposite is true brothers and sisters the exact opposite is true in fact jesus told his disciples he said you are entering into the labors of others amen see God everything God harvests he is rightfully his but some of the blessings we received today we're actually entering into the work of others ain't we're the ones hey men that are that are gaining from other people's labors praise God amen we're the ones that benefit praise God from other people's prayers that other people's works right some of you are being blessed by the prayers of your mothers and fathers I think a sister Karen godly parents she had sister Naomi he got godly parents you had my mother although not the message she did pray a lot some of us are entering into the blessings of our parents praise God hey man and God protects us in God God's blessing by generation just like he curses my generation look at the I don't have time to go there but haven't studying I wrote it down but look at the lineage of Elvis Presley his daughter and his wife wife and look at the evil that has happened look at his now grandson and all the evils that follow those people see that's generational curses aren't you glad for the generational blessings caused by the blood of Jesus Christ and your your your your family and your relatives accepting the power in that blood and now the blessings overflow into your life amen how do new you look at you know Lisa Marie Lisa Marie Presley how she got off and married Michael Jackson then get divorced and then they remarry again so what follows their life adultery fornication Bible said whoremongers will burn the lake of fire look what follows that type of lifestyle oh thank God for the ability the grace of God to live a holy life in this hour amen I'll just say like this I don't know if my relatives were listening but my mom drugged all of us children to church but not one of our siblings is divorced and remarried like some of our cousins neither does our family have the drug addictions like some of my cousins do my mom faithfully took all the children Church her siblings did it and now they got drug abuse mixed marriages all kinds of evil things uncleanness the boxer II alcoholism drug abuse see the blessings of God God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him amen be not deceived God is not mocked whatsoever a man soweth that will you repay men praise God because it's stewardship it's the responsibility but most people like to shy away from responsibility they want to be held accountable none of us you know in our flesh enjoy that so we've got to have God help us to accept our responsibility and we've got to seek God until we find God and have a commission from God where we won't run from our stewardship anymore but we'll be faithful to it amen now look at verse 23 I'm sorry verse 22 1922 and he said that him out of an old mouth will I judge thee thou wicked servant see the scene things he said were evil it was wrong he's wicked thou knewest that I was an austere man taking up that I did not let I lay not down and reaping that I did not sow see it's a wicked thing to say that that God God would do something unjust God has got his fare got his pure the Bible said remember in Romans 1 the Bible said God reveals himself to two ways to every man through the creation and also through his own body because you have a conscience of right and wrong and that so no man is without excuse on the day of judgment praise God and so see he's a wicked man because he's knew he knew in his conscious in his heart that God was a good God that God was faithful but he let these evil spirits because of his love for the world memory buried God's tale in the world and the other parable in other words he just didn't use God's talent he didn't want to serve God he wanted to serve himself verse 23 wherefore then gave us not now my money into the bank that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury so see he didn't even do the very least thing he could have did all he had knew brother William was to take that check for $15,000 you had to do was go deposit it in the bank that's all you had to do it's like you you and I all's he had to do was go to the ATM machine Church and deposit the check he didn't have to see anybody face to face I'm just dramatizing her applying to our day you understand he just had to go to the bank type in his ATM code slip the cheque in there and let it correct collect interest and Jesus would have been happy with that Dave had oh my he would just do something you only got to do is the very smallest the very little effort get on our knees and pray a little more praise God come to church be faithful pay our ties sing to God worship God testify to our neighbor we just got to do a little thing for the glory of God and God will see our efforts and he'll bless us but this man wasn't near that with a man he wouldn't even do one little thing he could have done that so easily but he refrained from doing the one simple thing just giving it over to somebody else trustworthy a banker he wouldn't even do that so Jesus said see your words and your actions expose you you didn't even do the very littlest thing you got your your your condemning me but I'm righteous he says amen verse 24 and he said unto them that stood by take from him the pound and give it to him that hath 10 pounds and they said unto Him Lord he hath 10 pounds for I say unto you that unto everyone which hath shall not be given I'm sorry shall be given and from him that hath not even that he hath shall be taken away from him but those mine enemies which would not that I should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me now that's a picture of the of the white throne judgment and right after the judgment the Bible says they will be cast in lake of fire in the presence of the Lamb and the holy angels amen so Jesus says all those who hated me that wouldn't let the word reign over them come and slay them right in front of me because then every chance I gave them all the same amount praise God but yet they wouldn't invest in the ways of God they wouldn't let the word rule over their lives amen now let me let me go to this quick by God's grace how many recognize that picture we saw last year brothers this is a painting in a poem in brother branham's office and I will think I'll read this to you here let me find the quote that goes along with it it's from the sermon on Easter Sunday 1962 restoration of the bride tree let me just get to it here like I said didn't have enough time to put all the quotes I haven't had time for a couple weeks to put them all in there cuz I'm back to work bear with me here I guess I could probably read that there okay so I can play it too I think I have it on the audio this is a poem about brother Branham now brother Branham calls I think the man's name is Steffi Gerry Steffi if I'm not mistaken Gerry Stephie's the man that painted this picture of brother Branham misty velour bless you sir yeah oh you're fine sir good to see you or bless ya nice to see you so Gerry Steffi painted this picture a brother branham his mother wrote the poem about brother Branham and brother BAM he he's very humbled by this as you'll see it's a very humbling it's a really nice poem about brother Branham but brother Ram he's making a comment about the talent he has to paint this is a really nice painting obviously I'm almost there bear with me 1962 yeah superb Ram brother Nevel asked brother Bramson brother BAM may I have the time to interrupt you he said you sure can brother he says as a token of our appreciation by the work of a young man in our midst we present this picture to you brother branham with the full appreciation of our love I'm sorry full expression of our love and appreciation thank you brother Nevel and the tabernacle the young man is Jerry Steffi that paint of that picture he said brother Jerry Steffi paint that picture god bless that boy that's very fine Jerry if you're here this morning it's too bad I wish I had the means to let that boy go to school for an artist so my man said that boy painted this picture about man said I wish I had the money I'd send that boy to school to be an artist I thought brother branham was against school no only when the wisdom of school was exalted above the wisdom of God and the church said most of us do pretty good with that I don't think anybody's off on in our church on that there's nothing wrong with education you just can't let it pervert you away from the real truth of the word of God he says now I believe God is in art don't you believe it the congregation says Amen God is in music God is an art God is in this and it's too bad to see a town like that wouldn't be developed think about the towns now and the pounds I think I was actually kind of moving now back to the talents a little bit he said wouldn't be developed the more he does the more developing he'll be I pray that God will bless you Jerry and thank you brother Neville unto the church for this fine picture for the verse that goes under it I'll read it a little later but the devil says you want me to read it he says all right so it's titled honor to whom honor let me just play it here I think I can just play it sorry I did record it earlier patience how many does it mean remember reading us before listen to this raise your hand buddy remember reading it okay couple of you praise the Lord he's not a man that's what we're looking up okay so here it is now try to play it you know maybe I can pause it so you can if you don't understand it's quite a nice complement to brother branham now I remember brother bands recognizing the talent of the individual to draw it and then also the beautiful poems here about about him so here well hopefully everybody can hear it might be better for me to read that soprano lock it says he's not a man of stature tall nor lofty in his way he sounds himself no trumpet as he goes from day to day has no desire for wealth nor fame but none could fill I'm sorry but none his place could fill he's just the way we want him our own dear brother bill so it's a poem of appreciation about brother branham he teaches us with faithfulness the undiluted word no fancy ways no love for praise just following the Lord his speech is gentle I'm sorry his speech is soft and gentle he raises not his voice except to cry against the wrong and then he has no choice never got a lot of learning from colleges in school but he knows what is important he's sure nobody's fool for the knowledge he is given is eternal from above he has no Creed except our Christ no law but sovereign love there was no greater announcement to this lowly humble birth but to us he is the greatest man who lives upon the earth that's a nice compliment we counted more than privileged to know him as a friend we cherish all he stands for and we'll right to the end he says he's not a preacher he's modest as can be but get him in the pulpit and hard to see he was a four ordained a prophet let men call it what they will God granted us great favor when he gave us brother bill that's the end of that praise God so we saw that when we were there last year in Jeffersonville it's still hanging in the study there in the Bram Tabernacle but I just want to show you that as a as a little testimony of what brother Adam thought about art and so you know I know my wife's are artists and she painted that beautiful picture of brother Bram and the pillar of fire in my office there maybe I should hang it out here again I used to I don't know if I ever did hang it out in the sanctuary but Church you know art speaks of God art that is real good art will appoint someone to Jesus Christ and you know I was I couldn't think of an example where art led someone to Christ but I can't think of an example where a track led somebody to Christ member program told the story the man whose wife got saved and he was a car salesman and he didn't believe in that but someone handed him a little tract and he looked at it and said where will you spend eternity so the words placed on that little track brother BAM said led him to Billy Graham Oral Roberts and then came back to brother Branham and then through brothers ministry God showed him that he was a child of God and he had no more doubts about where he stood with God so we can see you know even just the design of a tract so if God can use a tract that just has words on it we know God can use a picture as well remember the testimony of the woman in the hospital I think it's from 1946 or 51 I can't marry which one of the pillar of fire picture we know the pillar of fire picture in here but brother Hammond the pillar of fire picture the woman in the hospital had that picture on her standby in the hospital room and she kept praying and looking at the picture and saying God I know you're real and she heard testimony she told brother Graham was that the pillar of fire came alive it started glowing and it came out of the picture and hung over her and she walked on the hospital healed in the name of Jesus so see it was her attitude towards the picture but a man said see she wasn't looking at me she was looking at the pillar of fire so she bowed and said any other way you make it an idol so even this picture we don't make an idol but we recognize like gods and a prophet kind of like the so looking at this picture is just like you would look at the pictures of Moses or the ten commandments when you go to the courtroom I look at those and I say praise the Lord you know did you know in the I think it's the house representatives did you know outside or I'm sorry the back of that house representives is a statue of Moses and the Ten Commandments oh you know that and so all those people that come there when they have this the president gives the State of the Union address a picture of Moses and the ten commandments is at the very back of that room now so there's some people in there that are faithful to that picture but there's a lot that aren't faith for that picture but see God uses it there as a witness God leaves it there because they out the answer they'll never be able to say well I didn't know Moses was connected I didn't know about the law of Moses the Bible said not only is there witnesses in their body and creation but then there's witnesses through art as well amen all this art will witness against them that God was trying to get them to do the right a men how many one do the right today praise God so I want to look at this here now go back to Matthew 25 let's go there and let's look now draw a little comparison here to the talents actually if you would Acts 24 because then we can see the context you saw how the the pounds was spoken to multitude that we're expecting Jesus to kind of take over the actual physical government but in Matthew 24 I believe it's verse 1 and if you know you know the scripture Matthew 24 is Jesus he gives one of the greatest prophecies of the end time and if you know there's the message the six seals are Matthew 24 praise God but this is a conversation Saints just between Jesus and His apostles this isn't what Jesus and in the whole multitude this is just with Jesus in his apostles verse 1 and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciple came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple and Jesus said mm see ye not all these things verily I say to you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and his disciples I'm sorry and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately so see this is a private discussion saying tell us when shall these things be and what should be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world now if you look just in your Bible the rest of the chapter is read letters and the rest of the next chapter is read letters and then in chapter 26 it finally switches over he starts you know moving towards the Passover and the Last Supper so all of this is spoken just to Jesus's disciples in private so in private when Jesus is just with his faithful little church his faith a little ministerial group when Jesus having a ministers meeting he tells them the parable of the talents but when he's out with the congregation when he's out with all the people or the multitude he tells them that parable the pounds they're similar but not exactly because they have different purposes that Jesus wants them to understand glory now 25 let's go to this again now notice verse 14 for the kingdom of heaven is a man travelling into far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them as Goods now see that's similar to the pounds but there's nothing said about being hated by the citizens and then verse 15 shows they're given different amounts and unto one he gave five talents to another two and to another one to every man according to several bility and straightway took his journey now look that up and I saw how five talents is about five million dollars is 4.7 million dollars two talents is about two million and then one tale is about 750,000 or 1 million we'll just rounded up to 1 million ok so it makes sense so when Jesus is with his preachers he's telling them some of you have about 5 million dollars of some of you are so gifted your gifts go beyond now who is that probably John and Peter because Peter had the keys to the kingdom praise God and John his ministry lasted we saw that 66 years his ministry after Christ left he had almost 70 years of ministry of Holy Ghost ministry my and then he wrote those he wrote the gospel and then three epistles and then the book of Revelation he wrote five books 5 Bible books filled with prophecy and mother have said the book of Revelation was the only book Jesus really wrote all by himself amen he wrote it himself telling John write this down this is the apocalypse this is the signs of the end time this is thus saith the Lord he said tell the Saints surely I come quickly amen he comes quickly to their generation amen he came to Ephesus and Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira Philadelphia a Sardis late Asiya he comes quickly to everyone and if they don't repent he takes away the candlestick that's right so here amongst the preachers he's gotta let them know he said brother Peter I may have given John a little more ministry than you because Peter got jealous a little later didn't he remember after the resurrection he said but Jesus what about John Jesus said somewhat some are standing here that will not taste death do they see the kingdom and Peter got a little jealous what about John what what's he gonna do and Jesus said stop looking at other people's talents stop comparing yourself to other people follow the word amen you follow the ministry I've given to you you follow the word it's your eyes of other churches amen it's your eyes of other preachers other ministers hid your eyes off it you follow the word that's been revealed to you praise God does that help you'll see in this talents its spoken to preachers now I believe this too the money represents responsibility preachers get more money all that means is responsibility praise God because preachers the Bible said will be judged more harshly than everybody else because they influenced the people remember James said be not many masters remember James said that because they will see that we receive the greater condemnation help me understand now and programs he told those brothers and if you listen to 1962 not taking sides of Jesus mmm it's not coming to me but man tells the preachers he said you've just got one you'd have to answer to God for one church he said but I've got millions of souls I've gotta answer for he said you think it's easy since it's harder for me to know the will of God because I'm getting more knocks he says from the devil I'm getting more knocks I'm getting more tests I'm getting more pressure Sika Satan can look at his life and say ma he's got five talents he's got the wisdom to the discernment he's got prophecy he's a prophet he has all these he has all this talent so Satan's knocking him harder better I've said it was harder for him than you and I to serve the Lord and stay faithful but also church that ought encourage us that if brother Branham could do it with harder knocks we can do it no matter what knocks we go through no matter what waves come our way if we stay true to Christ we can crest every wave amen we can win every battle praise God we can get the victory but we got to be faithful and we know we got to overcome the temptations of Satan hallelujah so see this this is perfect by scriptural preachers are given more because they have more influence and then he said everybody else he says to the multitude he's not in the multitude no everybody has something to do now I don't have time I'm not going to go there today but there's another thought I want to take maybe tonight I'll take it there's another thought how preachers have different talents but then there's there's the idea that ever anybody including preachers as has been giving something equal in other words we all have equal opportunities whether may our female preacher or not preacher praise God we all have equal opportunities and the Holy Spirit help me through the scripture just to make a big long list of operative of acts of love or works all of us can do because they're all equal to us so I want to maybe maybe Lord willing we'll look at that tonight because this is so beautiful it's so clear scripturally that preachers have more responsibility but then everybody in one way everybody another way every servant of God whether you're male female child or adult old or young or middle-aged every servant of God has the equal chance to serve the Lord has an equal chance to invest in the things of God praise God let me go to this thought here and then we'll close I want to just close to this now the reason I'm preaching this is because I went through all the quotes of brother Branham about talents and at the end of his ministry he brings up Elvis and the singers a lot so let me go through some of these this is the three kinds of believers 1963 he said but they sell out like Judas that's the make believer some of them are highly talented people and this make believer watch that guy that's the shrewd guy the little guy that fills up quick and jumps up and runs out at every little phrase that he don't like you don't pay no attention to him he's just an unbeliever to begin with but when you see this guy make believer hangs on seat that's the Judas that's him like great talents I'm going to call names here which I really shouldn't do it but I'm gonna call them anyhow that you'll know I'm glad he called him I'm glad he called him cuz you know what they're all gonna be called out anyway on the day of judgment they're all gonna be Jesus called out Herod you little fox he said he's a little fox you tell that Fox those people went back and said well Jesus called you a fox geez didn't care it was the truth speak the truth we don't gossip but we speak the truth now I'm not gonna go call people foxes I'm just letting you know but Jesus could do it because he knew what was he knew what was in the man's heart amen like Elvis Presley red Foley Ernie Ford and Pat Boone or I didn't get the Pat Boone I got three of them time anyway he said Pat Boone a Church of Christ man I'm sorry Elvis Presley a Pentecostal I think what he could have done for the kingdom of God had he stay in the Pentecostal church singing the songs of God I have friends that don't that don't believe the message from my hometown that I've talked to them and they still play Elvis now they're older they still play Elvis Presley albums gospel albums because it's so beautiful and I'll admit a few times I've heard them and it sounds really nice but it doesn't have the sincerity praise God it might be right by the notes it might be right in a nice tune or the harmony I don't know all the might be the right measure it might be all that but it don't have that ring of the godly sincerity it doesn't have the truth or the true song of the obedient Amen because he could sing it but he couldn't live in Amen that right that's why I appreciate our brother amen first lead-in songs cuz he lives the life praise God or any song leader that we know in the message that really lives the life Pat Boone I'm sorry Elvis Presley punic also Pat Boone a Church of Christ red Foley a deacon in the church of christ now I do have red Foley so let's remember this guy was a deacon in the Church of Christ well let's get the elbows first and all these people with those talents smart out on television to see if we were smarter we'd be on television so that means we're not very smart which is okay I don't want to be smart I just want the mind of Christ oh yeah you know that's why brother BAM said he said that's why God didn't give me a big amount of money cuz if maybe I couldn't have handled it but see God had given him other gifts that were more important like discernment hey hallelujah praise God he wasn't given IBM machines he was given the mind of Christ eyelid area he said those people say well aren't they religious they sing songs that don't mean one thing yes sir deceiving the world what do they get out of it judas got thirty pieces of silver elvis a fleet of Cadillacs and a hundred or two hundred and fifty million dollars or a million dollars on records and things like that pat boone and the rest of them I don't care what church they belong to and everything it's hypocrisy it's a make believe it's a front and their life proves it out that it isn't right amen their life proves your life proves if you invest in the things of God or not like I told you this before it's true even the Bible said it any sin is a seed and it has to produce death so any church with a false doctrine eventually that sin is going to show up somewhere now with the rich young ruler how did show up it wasn't adultery it wasn't murder it was money but Rev said he got in that's why listen to yesterday the investments program said he didn't get poor he got richer and he tore down his homes and build up bigger barns so he was a slave to greed well Graham said yet he would only give now can you imagine having big barns of money now for them it was food Church can you imagine having big barns of food and you only give Lazarus a few crumbs what kind of wicked evil heart would that be he had barns with grains and then he cooked the bread and they'd have a big old feast of bread and butter and everything kill the fatted lamb or fatted calf sorry kill the lamb too and then they the little crumbs that fell from the table here you go laughter I'm doing my duty yeah he said I never broke one command I never didn't commit adultery I never lied never steal but you loved riches but you may deny you're your idol was your own Barnes you're I to let you bow down to us oh god bless me so I can get bigger Barnes my their life proves out that isn't right then there are those with the talents that is great organizers worldly wisdom he says they preach the gospel claim to smart man intellectuals listen a man that's trained in that field he's not a preacher he's a lecturer I wonder how many lecturers got megachurches out there they're not really preaching the Word of God does any man that will preach the Word of God he'll be rejected he'll be cast away right amen that's what the trouble is today we have lecturers jesus said go and train and do this he said no go and preach the gospel these signs shall follow the preaching amen that's not to learn to make a lecture who can just stand in mind just put flowery things in it make you feel like you're sitting right in the presence of an archangel that isn't it having forms of godliness you see that's a lecture not the Holy Spirit action some little fellow that wouldn't know his ABCs might come now with the power of faith with the word and make the Holy Spirit do things that that man knows nothing about and deny it there you are see they'll deny brother branham they'll deny his ministry they'll deny the endtime they'll deny the baptism of the Holy Ghost the way we preach it they'll deny the water baptism but man said that's a good sign they're lecturers smart educated organized men some very smart shrewd but they won't obey the Word of God he said great people yes sir they are organizers they're prosperous successful smart and worldly wisdom just exactly like Satan did to Eve that little helpless woman he came right and tried to to sell her on the idea that she would be wiser than she was and that's what she was looking for let me read another one countdown 1964 you see when you see in person nation's friend it kind of makes you a little upset doesn't it people impersonating brother branham's gift people impersonating a real preacher a real sister in Christ but just go on anyhow it'll be alright he said now look you've got to be born for that you are born and all natural gifts come to you gifts and callings are without repentance he said like Ernie Ford red Foley Elvis Presley those fellows with them big talents of singing and using it for the world God gave them their talents and see what they're doing with it who gave them the ability to sing and dance now dance of course his dance wasn't godly but he could have danced for Jesus right in a better way I better have said you know it's like Judas Iscariot here an influence in 1963 says it again he said they are taking the town that God gave them and influencing with their lives speaking louder than what their words are so as loud as their lyrics are to their words their life speaks louder than their words how can people make such plays or movies as this man does and then stand and sing hymns and things like that it's the very height of hypocrisy so if you want to see what hypocrisy look at gifted singers or preachers and how they that they they put their gifts of God in the ground and they compromise to make money it's the very height of hypocrisy that's exactly right and he here's what they say I think God loves me so much till he'll let me get by with anything see Oh God loves me I can do this God loves me he's merciful well Ram said I said he'll never do that he would never do it even Israel his nation even David that's a good example a man after his own heart reaped every grain that he sowed praise God because he planted some wrong seeds it knee and he reaped every one he planted program says and you'll do it to each one of us we'll do it but he got lifted up in his heart the RAM said and again leadership 1965 he says Elvis Presley Pat Boone Ernie Ford and great singers they take their talents their god-given talents and use it to inspire the works of the devil how many love songs that Elvis sing that inspired adultery or fornication and that led to will say an abortion see we've got to see what do our works what gifts do we have and then what are they producing in other people's lives in other words waters what is our life influencing others to do amen glory he said this is the height of hypocrisy God gives you a tremendous gift to do something but you invest it in the things of the world rather than things of God that's right some great singers sound their god-given talents for fame in this world to become somebody he said how could you become any more of a body than you could to be as somebody than to be a son of God amen praise God I was looking for that one quote oh yeah here just now Elvis Presley as you can see on the screen he died at 42 42 he sold uh now this is just in his lifetime 146 million albums he sold millions since then he died with five million dollars in the bank which with inflation is 20 million today 20 min he spent he wasted so much money they said booze and women and traveling and clothes and all this kind of things how'd he die he dried died as a drug addict you've heard me say before he went you went you told his bodyguards I'm just going to use the restroom and he took a book of witchcraft he's gonna go read about witchcraft and harvesting the mental energy and they went back they found him dead on the toilet and he was rampant in adultery everybody knows that it's all proven they got a video where they caught Elvis his bodyguards have a video of him where he came in after lunch into the car they got a video of him and he was bragging about how he just had adultery and he called it a hot lunch and then he said Elvis you're on tape they're giggling laughing and it Church it's a you I'll show you the video if you want he turns and looks out the window all sad these things what a friend we have in Jesus because he knows he's on video look at that a man they got a given let's say a five talent gift to sing and maybe be a preacher maybe be a leader but he sold it out for the things of the world the very height of hypocrisy and I put a picture up of him up there not a pretty one because that's what it all produces right there that's what it produces and there's much more that could be said about him but he started a Pentecostal church brother branham knew Elvis's pastor and his mother very well I was reading the other day that there were psychiatrists United States going to each other and we're the great singers like and entertainers like Arthur Godfrey lot of these other people with wisecracks and so forth some of them have as many as three psychiatrists and New York newspaper reporter took two years to search it down that rock-and-roll boogie woogie Elvis a modern Judas is scared that boy was a Christian in a Pentecostal Church with the baptismal Agosto he's talking about tongues now or maybe the church actually taught the real baptism Holy Ghost I'm not sure which one it is I know his pastor his mother and them well Judas is scary got thirty pieces of silver out of Christ he got a feat of cattle and twenty million dollars but he sold his birthright read folia deacon in the church sold his birthright and taken his talents and give it up to the world they have to have psychiatrist to keep them up Presley's had three or four heart attacks and yet in his teens yet it's the strain see the burden of sin if if a person doesn't clean out their lives what happens those demons start gathering more and more and they start tormenting the person more and more it's a strain red Foley he's the only one that had anything positive I was reading on Wikipedia know if it's true he died at 58 he sold over 25 million albums in fact he was one of the first artists as a Christian ever sell million copies of a song I think it was peace in the valley yeah was peace in the valley there'll be peace in the valley for me that's at least with the websites and I hope I'm right it could be your huh but after he did that he got so popular Church he started making country album and then he influenced he actually influenced Elvis Presley with his music so again remember Abraham said look at a person's influence look how people what do people take away from your life what do people take away from my life I hope it's the righteousness of Christ hope people look at your life and say mine I want to be more like God I want to pray more I want to read my BOB I'm gonna go to church more now we know we're getting fewer and fewer as the time goes on but still let's influence let's let's have people say that they knew a real Christian and it was you and I and he was so into the things of the world that his second wife even his first wife died after birth of one of their children but his second wife committed suicide cuz he was back and forth back and forth back and forth on the very night this is according to his friend here on the very night he died he had a concert and his friend is the Christian concert a friend led him to the Lord apparently he repented and wept he went and saying that song there's peace in the valley for me he came in and died but before he died he said that's the first time I've ever sung that song and actually felt that he said he's the only one that had any good about his life no one else this other guy didn't have anything good about him so church at least he has a hope but look he'll have no reward he had to get the sing he had a gift to unite people he had the gift to do all these things for the the kingdom of God but he went back and forth on both sides suicide struck his family and here he at the end of his life like a thief on the cross God gives him a second chance amen thank God for the mercy of God hallelujah talk about talents there's the last one I believe I have for that one yeah Ernie Ford Ernie was one that is one of the saddest stories of all them he died at 72 so millions of albums he was a local disc jockey and and then some rich guy was driving through the area I heard him on the radio and here's a guy that says his whole biography says I never asked for anything say and just kept opening the doors for him I'll say like that hey a guy like a rich guy liked his voice and so he opened up and he basically picked up Ernie Ford and put him in the spotlight he could have turned it down but he didn't and he would cross over he'd make gospel albums sell millions of albums and then go back over to the world dance albums all these things his entire life he was nothing but an alcoholic his family was completely dysfunctional until his wife finally committed suicide they were known he would they would they would go to events and they were known his wife would be sloshed and drunk and sarcastic and he would just be real common and trying to hold everything together they put on this hit hypocritical front like in all the magazine's they're all smiling golfing together smiling laughing like everything's okay and church don't you know church people do the same thing today they put on false fronts like like everything's okay but the reality of your life is in your whole we've said it before proverbs says the treasure of the believer is in their home amen your home life tells what you are praise God they can act if we can act like things are good but how we live in our home tells what we really got in our hearts praise God now I want to read something here to you by God's grace yeah I pulled up this quote here let me read this to you we're at a endtime it kind of gave me courage this morning he said Amen brother Fred brother Norman the brothers I was sitting this morning if that wasn't the very same thing I was talking this morning I set out for America's harvest when I started years ago on the harvest with the the gifts and so forth it's went over it's combed he said the nation the harvest has already reaped in now we're going back across the field over stubble just picking up a grain here and there whenever we can is that right brethren that's saying the same thing here the Holy Spirit turns right up back around and speaks the same thing so if you can picture I mean we're going to see it pretty soon we have all these farming fields by our house pretty soon they're gonna harvest those fields and we're gonna drive by I think nothing of it oh there's the harvest but brother Graham said in his day the the got the field of America had already been harvested down and everything was harvested he said they're just a little places where you can find the the grains and pick up a few grains here and there Oh God if they could rejoice when the harvest began what ought to we do now when the harvest is over hallelujah winnowing time is here now separating the chaff you remember what winnowing time is where you take that pitchfork you throw the seeds up in the air and the wind comes by and blows away all the chaff amen Church the wind of the Holy Spirit is blowing here this morning amen and let's have it blow out all the chaff all the unbelief praise God separate us from any of any evil thing that said or thought may just blow that away and they the seed life of the word of God the souls of the seeds of the saints of God that will remain and Jesus will take that into the threshing floor plays God he'll take it into his house and he'll use that for his glory amen I don't know you said it's winnowing time now separating the chaff this is the time then how can you hold your peace without peace without blasting it out this is winnowing time yes sir you beat the husks off the wheat that's exactly this is the time when it's coming if anybody here that hasn't got a Holy Ghost experience and once the only ghost here's the altar right now we'll come right here and pray for anybody that doesn't have the Holy Spirit anybody wants receive Jesus I invite you here to the altar I like this if you notice in the times pass I'm not too much to persuade people I know it's good sometimes people go back and talk to one another but I've seen people led too far away from God if the Holy Spirit won't raise them from their seat then they're hopeless anyhow in other words if someone won't even like stand up to say I want to be born again how are they going to be saved if someone can't bring their body and subjection enough just to raise their hand or or walk forward and come admit that I need the Holy Ghost and I'm not born again how can there be any hope for that let's see they've got to give every part of their being body so spirit it's all got to be surrendered to Jesus Christ your body must be surrendered so you can repent and get baptized and then seek the Holy Ghost praise God to be born again Jesus turned around and said to the syrophoenician woman it's not meat for me to take the children's bread and give it to dogs she said that's the truth Lord that's right but the dogs is ready to eat the scraps around the master's table he said for this saying now this is the church I want you to notice the thing is the ministry will continually get greater I want to I wouldn't encourage you with this our ministry is going to get greater in Revelation probably not number although we would appreciate that you not be wonderful if God does save more Souls but brother says the ministry will continually get greater and this is in 1960 and it did by the third Pole it got greater in Revelation you see the gifts the Lord has given me is to vindicate that I'm telling you the truth it's God a vindication that it's a truth that wasn't what was the truth he said I was born I'm sorry he said I was supposed to pray for people I was born for that purpose I said that years ago I just put all the ministry right on the gifts he and the American people especially wanted to be entertained they got they did the same thing with our Lord but just as soon as I begin to tell them what it was tell my truth my doctrines of Scripture which I'd ask any man to correct me that's right nobody's ever done it yet and I'm just as humble would be willing to accept it any time look how humble brother Branham was if I'm wrong somebody come correct me but nobody ever did that's the same thing I've offered on all those videos if I'm wrong learning this somebody come correct me no one's ever brought a real challenge to anything because it's the word here's what I'm just gonna stop right here but as soon as Jesus began to tell them the truth about the gospel what happened the cemani went away the others went away and Jesus popularity continually rose fell until finally they crucified him but his ministry grow deeper and deeper lasted made this bread as I talked the other night into the fish turn ride around and put sockets a man's eyes it doesn't have sockets put eyeballs in now there was a crowd foul just the fish isn't yeah this is what we see today there was a crowd just followed for the fishes and loaves see people follow the church just for the physical blessings they say we'll see what he does tomorrow but their hearts were far away and at the end time how many did he have to go up to receive the Pentecostal blessing out of the tens of thousands he ministered to 120 out of tens of thousands now that spirit in the world today performing the same ministry against the same opposition it would be the same thing but as ministry grows deeper and deeper all the time greater let's say into our feet I'm gonna pull one thing out of their entertainment the spirit we're gonna battle America is entertainment sit back and entertain me now entertain when you're entertained you don't do nothing you just sit there and enjoy it in other words no stewardship musicians can come no accountability and see that's what we have to make sure Church doesn't become Oh preacher just entertain me it can't be that it's got to be God I have a part in every service I play a part my amens my pole my prayer my agreement my worship my singing my prayers all of its important all of it has an impact on the services now the kingdom of God church the kingdom of God I'm gonna pull just those nine gifts of the Spirit back up there real quick Lord willing in the next few weeks or months I want to start I feel like with the purpose series now we can start getting down I want to identify each of these gifts and then I want to give in the future hopefully the next week or a couple weeks here maybe not and of course not next Sunday but the following maybe I want to start looking at one give us time to meditate and see what has God done in my life so I want you to pray about that now and then will Lord willing we're gonna revisit it in the future I think I couldn't get to the quote I couldn't find it there I'm sorry I didn't have time to locate it but brother BAM says first find out what you've got now we know everybody's got something right in both parables the preachers had really valuable gifts because there have to influence more people but the other parable the pounds everybody has something everybody has something what I like to do not today but in the future weeks I also want you to be able to write down and say times you've seen the Holy Spirit move in other people like maybe somebody so humble God uses them with the word of wisdom to you but you're not even they're not even aware of it because they're so hungry and God supernaturally used someone in the church to answer a prayer request or something like that because I would like to identify I would like you to know what gives certain your life wouldn't you like to know if Jesus is gonna ask you and say what you do with the talents I gave you don't wanna know which talents you have to see I feel if we go this direction it'll encourage you to know why God didn't give me something God left me a very valuable not left me some great gifts I've got to invest in that and I want to be accountable honey want to be a faithful steward what Jesus left here see what does that do than that that magnifies every time we are gathered together because here's the quote out here's one of them I want to read the man said yes their church is rich but the powers not there God moves by his spirit but not not by the amount of money or telling the church [Music] so it doesn't matter how much money or what big huge talents we have or what they gifts we have we've just got to see what we have and yield to the Holy Spirit I'm just going to give you some spiritual logic here if fewer and fewer souls are going to be saved and less and less people are going to come to the message in America then where will we see the gifts operating the most it'll be amongst us praise God it may minister to others you know foolish virgin out there with your friends and family and things like that it may operate there but church I believe we're gonna see it more amongst us because there's fewer food and to be saved fewer people God moves by his spirit a church before we pray how many would raise their hands and say God show me my gifts what I'm a steward is a wisdom knowledge faith healing miracles prophecy discernment palms our interpretation your God you see the hands of sweet [Music] or not a sobering thought Lord the very height of hypocrisy is to take the gift and use it for selfish people the wrong way he was give us sincerity may we keep the feast in sincerity improve his pulses or or the great prayer desire my artists to see each person find out what they find out what you've given them what is in that pound that they have what is in the talent that you given them when they possess or once we find out what we have that we can work in that ministry then we can yield ourselves and we can come to the house of God expecting you to move Lord Here I am if you need to use somebody you can use me I'm willing we want to be faithful in them very little or we can see like Elvis and people today they're given much greater gifts and we are as far as singing Lord God as far as organization and smartness Lord but they're not using them for the things of God we're thankful and happy to use our very little small gifts happy to do it Lord kome happy to be a child of the king we want you to rule and reign over this church ruin way over every life every look life surrender to yours in order the weeks and months to come if you're willing help us in order to be able to help to see the supernatural powers in mind and gifts you've given to us that we can strike a united body for Christ Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] beautiful Lord a wonderful Savior I know for sure all of my days are held in your hands wrapped it into your boo gently it's a present [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I just want to read that quote I read on Wednesday night he said we're all sinners saved by grace and one is not above another see just one is giving something and he'll have to answer that for what he'd done what the table was give to him that's right every person has to know think I'm saying preachers are greater they're not they just have to answer for more we're all one in Christ Jesus whether male or female Greek or Jew we're all one in Christ Jesus we've got to be responsible with money give us family sire spare your life step over [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and I worship you Almighty God

gods do with our little church all of our gifts all that we have the Christ what could Christ do he remembers it just like you started with like four or five people and we're not expecting that but I thought expecting the Holy Ghost praise God the power of God the ministries gotta get greater the brides ministry has to get greater although more popular it's gotta get greater that comes by greater
