[33:08] read verse two first one revelation 21
[33:11] verse 1 let's begin on three one two
[33:14] three and I saw a new heaven and a new
[33:17] earth for the first heaven and the first
[33:21] Earth were passed away and there was no
[33:24] more sea
[33:25] I read verse two and I John saw the holy
[33:29] city New Jerusalem coming down from God
[33:33] out of heaven prepared as a bride
[33:36] adorned for her husband
[33:38] amen let's have a word of Prayer here if
[33:41] everything on your heart just make a
[33:42] known answer to the Lord here

[33:48] we're thankful Lord but for your amazing
[33:50] grace lord grace grace god's grace
[33:53] lauren and we're thankful grace is
[33:55] greater than all of our sin you proved
[33:57] it Lord when the woman was caught in the
[33:59] very act of adultery and your grace told
[34:02] her to go and sin no more the stones
[34:05] were ready to be thrown dear God but
[34:08] Lord you the Bible said you were full of
[34:09] grace and truth Lord God thank you Lord
[34:12] for your amazing grace Lord each one of
[34:15] us no doubt we fall short of your glory
[34:17] but lord we thank you for amazing grace
[34:19] today Lord and as we look to your word
[34:21] Lord
[34:22] we'll give you praise and honor for
[34:23] grace as we look to these future things
[34:25] the scripture commands us to set our
[34:27] affections on things above the holy city
[34:30] above Lord you know we're often tempted
[34:32] to look too much at the city we live in
[34:34] or the Washington DC City or cities
[34:37] around the world but Lord we look now
[34:39] Lord to that great heavenly City father
[34:41] and we pray your Holy Spirit minister to
[34:44] us Lord I'm nothing I have no ability of
[34:45] my own use me for your glory anoint your
[34:48] people use them for your glory may we be
[34:51] in the atmosphere of faith and believing
[34:52] Lord that you might be honored and
[34:54] glorified for apart from you we can do
[34:57] nothing Lord so help us to be inline
[34:59] with your Holy Spirit to be obedient
[35:01] Lord that your works can be done this
[35:04] morning in Jesus Christ's name the
[35:06] church says Amen god bless yous being
[35:08] seated praise God
[35:18] so we'll look to the scripture I'm going
[35:21] to be using some of the notes I used a
[35:23] few years ago of course not all of them
[35:24] but a couple years ago Lord willing I
[35:27] think in 2015 I preached on the future
[35:30] home so this is where we are in the
[35:32] series Lord bless you sister Wendy good
[35:34] to see you by God's grace this is where
[35:36] we are in our series you know we got
[35:38] known on Wednesday night with Revelation
[35:39] chapter 20 about the Millennium and what
[35:44] a great thought that is my the enemies
[35:46] of I'm sorry not the enemies with the
[35:48] the nations of the world will beat their
[35:50] swords and make them into hoes and and
[35:53] rakes and after Jesus rebukes them right
[35:57] there
[35:58] in the Millennium what a powerful what a
[36:00] powerful thing and how many believe that
[36:03] if God rebukes you he loves you praise
[36:05] God that proves it he rebukes the
[36:07] nations and they immediately no more
[36:09] have any concern about anyone else
[36:11] fighting anyone else they immediately go
[36:14] to being fruitful and that's what we
[36:16] should do we should receive a rebuke
[36:18] from Christ and then go back to being
[36:20] more fruitful praise God turn our
[36:23] efforts off of fighting with others and
[36:25] just laboring and God's vineyard and
[36:27] working and becoming fruitful for the
[36:29] kingdom of God amen what a beautiful
[36:32] thought that was praise God what a
[36:34] wonderful time in the Lord and now we're
[36:36] happy for another time in the lower
[36:37] today praise God
[36:39] so let's a look to the scripture I like
[36:41] to just read this whole chapter here
[36:43] it's a it's not exactly that long it's
[36:45] only 27 verses long and you've already
[36:46] read two of them to get a little
[36:49] background here so we read verses 1 & 2
[36:54] and we see the holy city coming down
[36:58] praise God verse 3 and I heard a great
[37:01] voice out of heaven saying behold the
[37:02] tabernacle of God is with men and he
[37:06] shall dwell with them and they shall be
[37:08] his people and God himself shall be with
[37:12] them and be their God and God shall wipe
[37:16] away all tears from their eyes now this
[37:18] is in the New Jerusalem there must still
[37:21] be some remembrance right now no doubt
[37:25] what this is referring to I believe is
[37:27] the previous end
[37:29] the end of the previous chapter where
[37:32] we'll have to stand there sitting on
[37:33] Thrones right the Bible said our
[37:36] testimony judges the lives of not only
[37:39] humans but even angels such a godly
[37:44] testimony of Christians and then seeing
[37:47] and if we just capture that for a moment
[37:49] the Bible said in verse chapter 20 verse
[37:52] 11 that the Bible says earth and heaven
[37:56] will flee away at the face of Jesus
[37:58] Christ right the holiness and the
[38:03] brightness of the Lord they are at the
[38:05] white throne judgement causes earth and
[38:08] heaven just to flee from him by the
[38:11] beauty of it in the power of it and then
[38:14] the dead and gray all comes standing
[38:16] before God and books are open and
[38:21] they're judged the Bible said by their
[38:24] works and of course there's the book of
[38:26] life so they take the books here of
[38:28] their individual lives and that they're
[38:31] presented and then they're there that's
[38:33] they look to the other book of life to
[38:35] see if their name is in the book of life
[38:38] and the Bible said the sea gives up the
[38:42] dead and death and he'll delivered up
[38:44] the Dead which were in them and they're
[38:45] judged every man according to his works
[38:48] and God Jesus has called it simply good
[38:52] those that have done good praise God God
[38:55] keeps it very simple either your
[38:56] testimony is you do good or you do evil
[38:59] it's a very simple God he brings it down
[39:02] to just one of those two factors right
[39:04] one of those two descriptions you either
[39:06] do good with your life or you do evil
[39:08] with your life and good is living and
[39:11] helping others living for others that's
[39:14] good Jesus proved it in Matthew 25 so
[39:18] those that did good that stand before
[39:19] Christ I stand before his bride those
[39:22] that do good go forth into eternal life
[39:26] and those had done evil to the lake of
[39:29] fire what a thought mine and death and
[39:33] he'll were casting like a fire this is
[39:35] the second death and who suffers not
[39:36] power in the book of life was cast in
[39:38] the lake of fire imagine
[39:42] that's an interesting thought the Bible
[39:44] said the first shall be last and the
[39:46] last shall be first
[39:48] I imagine that Jesus Christ will call up
[39:52] first the layer see in church age those
[39:54] that died in the tribulation I imagine
[39:57] they'll be pulled up first to be judged
[39:58] and they'll stand there and not to stand
[40:02] before a holy God and understand and
[40:05] they're there live the book of their
[40:07] lives will tell all of them that they
[40:10] wanted the the cares of the world or
[40:12] that a one of the riches of the world
[40:13] they wanted their church buildings they
[40:16] wanted their money their bank accounts
[40:18] more than they wanted the glory and the
[40:21] holiness of Christ because the great
[40:24] temptation at the end the very last
[40:26] temptation was the mark of the beast
[40:28] that was the last temptation and thank
[40:30] God Jesus said he'll keep us from that
[40:32] our temptation amen
[40:34] where we got to choose the word or are
[40:37] the very just physical blessings of our
[40:40] life and they'll to stand there and then
[40:44] the the the the Laodicean saints will be
[40:46] sitting there maybe he'll just rotate us
[40:47] up you know for each age I imagine it'll
[40:50] just be a rotation or maybe it's just if
[40:52] it's like a oval shape of a throne who
[40:54] knows but the last will be first and
[40:59] they'll be judged and we'll have to sit
[41:02] there and be a witness against them
[41:05] Emmer but remember God can bring up
[41:07] somebody from a thousand years before to
[41:09] be a witness against it because the
[41:11] Queen of Sheba was from a thousand BC
[41:13] and Jesus said I'll use her to judge the
[41:17] Pharisees so he can poll anybody imagine
[41:22] he might even pull up lot because lot
[41:26] was the days of lot was like our day
[41:28] praise God and lot will be an overcomer
[41:31] he was able to overcome the temptations
[41:36] of sodom and gomorrah and he the bible
[41:39] said is for so is righteous man and so
[41:42] we'll stand there and maybe God will
[41:44] call it a lot and lot was able to call
[41:46] it wickedness some will say I wasn't
[41:49] able to call it wickedness because of
[41:50] the pressure here the pressure there and
[41:53] God will call Pilate and they'll say
[41:55] well I was able to
[41:55] call it wickedness even amidst an angry
[41:59] mob can you imagine that and this person
[42:02] will say I just had the pressure of my
[42:03] wife or or my uncle trying to pressure
[42:06] me to accept homosexuality but lot will
[42:09] say well I'd overcome an angry mob a man
[42:13] that will be used against them on that
[42:16] day Church let's stand on holiness
[42:18] praise God let's stay with the word Amen
[42:21] let's not be afraid if we hurt people's
[42:24] feelings because what do feelings matter
[42:26] it's God's feelings that matter praise
[42:28] God it's not human feelings that matter
[42:31] it's God's feelings that matter and want
[42:34] to stand there and those that are
[42:36] disobedient we'll watch some church I
[42:39] imagine I wonderful to be crying on the
[42:40] Thrones or not but the Bible said we'll
[42:42] be crying tears there and Jesus will
[42:45] have to come by and wipe away those
[42:47] tears people that we loved people that
[42:50] we knew one after another and jesus said
[42:53] few there be that find it few will find
[42:57] the road so church the majority of the
[42:59] people from our day coming up with a
[43:01] majority will be taken and thrown in
[43:03] that lake of fire I would be about
[43:06] crying now my thinking of that people
[43:09] that we loved people that we prayed for
[43:11] and tried to witness to it people that
[43:14] maybe gave us hard times or rejecting us
[43:16] and and mocked us and make fun of us and
[43:19] they want to stand there as a witness as
[43:22] an overcomer want to stand there as a
[43:25] judge and no doubt Church I imagine that
[43:29] will start crying a little bit see one
[43:32] after another but I imagine the glory of
[43:34] the Angels the angels cheering when a
[43:37] couple of those find their names on the
[43:39] book praise God that the Angels because
[43:41] they didn't have eternal life while on
[43:43] the earth but they'll get eternal life
[43:45] when their names found on the book of
[43:47] life amen
[43:49] imagine the innumerable number of angels
[43:52] worshipping and praising God saying
[43:54] glory to God he meant that a soul was
[43:58] able to be saved on Laodicea you know
[44:03] I'm back and forth you know sometimes I
[44:05] think a lot of people are gonna be saved
[44:06] sometimes a lot I think hardly anybody's
[44:08] gonna be saved
[44:10] because you see the wickedness sometimes
[44:12] you see people do good things but then
[44:14] they'll turn around and do wicked things
[44:16] they'll say nice things about God and
[44:18] they'll turn around and do evil things
[44:20] that we know is abominable in the sight
[44:23] of God but we ought to be trusting in
[44:27] we're trusting an amazing grace but my
[44:29] dad said at that throat there won't be
[44:31] grace
[44:32] it'll be works right and those are the
[44:37] works the testimony it had to be a work
[44:39] that was good that did good to God and
[44:43] Christ pride in Christ family Christ's
[44:45] body praise God mine now I'll say like
[44:49] this I kind of said it I want to add to
[44:50] that I do think it'll be grace there
[44:52] because it'll just be grace to be given
[44:55] eternal life but the fact of there won't
[44:57] be another one that I mean by there
[44:58] won't be grace you won't be able to
[45:00] repent there you already had to repent
[45:02] earlier praise God that's what it means
[45:08] because the Bible says you live once and
[45:10] then the judgment right so your decision
[45:13] you make before death is the decision
[45:16] that will stand that's right imagine
[45:22] each age and then we go back to the
[45:23] Philadelphia and then Sardis and
[45:27] Thyatira and Samara and Pergamos all the
[45:31] way back to Ephesus and then I wonder
[45:32] after that if they'll do the Old
[45:33] Testament Saints because the last will
[45:36] be first and the first will be last
[45:40] imagine those souls from the days of
[45:42] Noah Jesus already preached to them not
[45:46] but they got to come back up one more
[45:48] time
[45:49] and here I'm Stan see him standing there
[45:51] as judge and weigh their case it's got
[45:55] to be fair did you hear the message or
[45:57] not did you follow the prophet of God or
[45:59] not did you follow the vindicated
[46:01] preacher of righteousness or not amen
[46:03] and the very word they preach to them no
[46:06] will stand there he'll be raised up
[46:08] Enoch will be stood up he'd prophesied
[46:12] that the Lord cometh with ten thousands
[46:14] of his Saints amen
[46:19] after the last one let's say the last
[46:21] one is you know pain or something like
[46:23] that throw it in there
[46:24] I imagine we'll all be crying by then
[46:26] and the Bible says as we're weeping the
[46:29] Bible said a holy city starts coming
[46:33] down and I imagined before that city
[46:35] comes down by the hose a Jesus is gonna
[46:37] look over behind and say he's gonna say
[46:39] my children it is finished praise God
[46:43] amen praise God at the end of the first
[46:48] covenant he uttered out those words with
[46:52] his last breath it is finished the first
[46:56] covenant is finished amen
[46:58] and here I believe they'll turn around
[47:00] or something or a ruby there and I hope
[47:03] he repeats it again because they'll say
[47:05] the second covenant is now finished amen
[47:08] it is finished and now you can say like
[47:11] this now the Covenant is finished praise
[47:15] God he said time is finished
[47:18] death is finished amen it's all finished
[47:22] amen no more time it is all and now it's
[47:26] just the same conditions now we're back
[47:28] to the Garden of Eden amen oh praise God
[47:31] amen glory and we'll all be crying and
[47:37] then the city this holy city will come
[47:39] down like a bride adorned for a husband
[47:44] it'll be the last wedding ceremony
[47:46] brother Jose the last wedding ceremony
[47:50] whatever save raise God amen his heaven
[47:54] coming down to marry the earth amen
[47:57] hallelujah here comes the bride amen
[48:01] glory
[48:04] she'll descend down and offer
[48:06] transparent gold and glory it'll come
[48:12] down the earth we'll have all those say
[48:16] like this like a I don't even know the
[48:19] word just a shaking syndrome or
[48:21] something like that i shaking spell and
[48:23] then the Bible said the earth will raise
[48:26] up right the earth will raise up to make
[48:29] a mountain that this pyramid can sit on
[48:32] top of
[48:33] and brother branham compares this to
[48:36] Jesus's baptism and I just caught that
[48:40] this morning when I was praying just as
[48:42] the earth had to rise up to meet the
[48:46] heavenly City
[48:47] so did Jesus's body the earth had to
[48:50] rise up out of the water to meet the
[48:52] heavenly dove amen I don't have rays God
[48:56] so it fits perfectly praise God heaven
[48:59] and earth marring uniting one rising up
[49:03] to meet the other hallelujah praise God
[49:05] amen and that will be the finished work
[49:09] now the earth can say I'm purified Amen
[49:13] hallelujah because the earth had to be
[49:17] justified the days of Noah sanctified by
[49:20] the blood of Jesus Christ pouring out
[49:22] all over the earth and now the earth is
[49:24] fired baptized and it's got in this back
[49:27] to its rightful condition it's back to a
[49:30] pure condition praise God amen
[49:34] I didn't expect to preach that right
[49:37] there but Jesus left verse 4 had to wipe
[49:41] away all the tears from their eyes we'll
[49:43] still have human emotion we'll still
[49:47] have emotion and and and be distraught
[49:50] see the church that's not someone who's
[49:52] really got the Holy Ghost they will sign
[49:54] cry for the abominations of sinners this
[49:57] proves our right they're the true bride
[49:59] of Christ
[50:00] we'll always can always burden them
[50:02] they'll cry though because their heart
[50:05] is so in love with God and their heart
[50:08] hates sin and it breaks their emotional
[50:11] state they can't they they just can't
[50:14] handle thinking the thought about loved
[50:16] ones being lost and and people that
[50:18] claim to be religious doing abomination
[50:22] than living in sin and that breaks their
[50:24] emotional state even to this point
[50:26] praise God now if it's right you can
[50:28] have a glorified body in Christ this is
[50:30] right I didn't think about that till now
[50:33] all tears so thinking about the
[50:36] multitude in Jesus somehow is going to
[50:39] wipe away all the tears from our eyes we
[50:42] don't have to worry there's no time
[50:43] there nobody's going to get tired
[50:46] oh how dare you praise God amen and
[50:50] there should be no more death see that
[50:54] remember remember brother have said
[50:55] there could be death in the Millennium
[50:56] it looks like there could be the Bible
[50:58] said a child will die a hundred years
[50:59] old
[51:00] there could be of course we know death
[51:03] also means a second death neither sorrow
[51:06] nor crying neither shall there be any
[51:08] more pain for the former things are
[51:11] passed away
[51:12] oh my praise the Lord and now verse five
[51:18] so now you must go back up to his seat
[51:20] because before he was wiping the tears
[51:22] away and now the Bible said that he that
[51:24] sat on the throne said behold I make all
[51:26] things new and he said unto me write for
[51:29] these words are true and faithful this
[51:32] is not a fairytale Church it's not
[51:34] something that I'm just trying to get
[51:35] you happy about this is something God's
[51:37] trying to get you to be prepared for
[51:39] amen he's trying to get you prepared for
[51:42] that wedding day of the heaven and earth
[51:44] praise God amen
[51:47] no no wonder a weddings are some of the
[51:50] happiest days on earth no wonder because
[51:53] they all prefigure your baptism of the
[51:56] Holy Ghost and this earth baptism and
[51:58] the Holy Ghost amen praise God no wonder
[52:03] because it represents all the past pains
[52:06] are going to be healed praise God it
[52:11] means the past life is over and just be
[52:15] encouraged our program say that if you
[52:17] got the wrong mate on this side you'll
[52:19] get the right one over there in the
[52:20] mundum it all gets fixed over there if
[52:24] you got the wrong one here everything
[52:26] wrong is going to be made right praise
[52:29] God hallelujah
[52:37] so we know this all things will be done
[52:40] away with anything with pain anything
[52:42] associated with sorrow will be put away
[52:47] these are true and faithful he said unto
[52:51] me it is done so see at some point
[52:53] there's gonna be that time where he
[52:54] turns around said it's finished it is
[52:57] dad praise God
[52:59] San and death has been put away with
[53:01] it's a thing of the past
[53:03] oh how we longed for that moment praise
[53:05] God
[53:07] it is done I'm alpha I don't know why I
[53:10] don't know why these aren't red letter
[53:11] words I am Alpha and Omega the beginning
[53:13] in the end I will give unto him that is
[53:15] athirst of the fountain of water of life
[53:18] freely praise God now look at that
[53:20] church even though we're in glorified
[53:22] bodies we can still cry up to that point
[53:24] at least and then we'll be thirsty for
[53:27] more of God oh I'm glad my thirst for
[53:30] Christ will never be quenched hey man
[53:32] I'm gonna need an eternity to spend with
[53:35] him because I'll still be thirsting for
[53:37] the waters of his life amen
[53:39] praise God see my boys have a thirst for
[53:47] more of God love church boy worship more
[53:51] of the truth
[53:51] we'll always have a thirst for that
[53:53] praise God people tell me they love God
[53:56] and got the Holy Ghost and no are
[53:57] thirsty for Church something's wrong
[53:58] with them brother over there something's
[54:00] wrong with them
[54:01] there they don't want to sing anymore
[54:02] they don't want to love the Lord or
[54:04] study their Bibles anymore something's
[54:06] wrong with you because the soul of a
[54:08] believer is constantly thirsting for
[54:10] more of God and it will for eternity oh
[54:17] you think are gonna get bored with Jesus
[54:19] some day nonsense nope he said he that
[54:22] the thirst come it's freely given he the
[54:26] overcometh shall inherit all things
[54:28] there's our promise and I'll be his God
[54:30] and he shall be my son so we deal we're
[54:34] dealing with family they're by God's
[54:36] grace all the family of God Oh toe to be
[54:40] a son and daughter praise God I like
[54:42] that song Val my true father and I a
[54:45] true son praise be thou my vision praise
[54:47] is that your vision church
[54:49] that you'll be a faithful son you'll be
[54:51] a faithful daughter and there you'll
[54:53] know him as father and you'll be like a
[54:56] child verse 8 but the fearful and the
[54:59] unbelieving and the abominable and the
[55:01] murderers and the whoremongers and
[55:02] sorcerers and idolaters and all Liars
[55:05] shall have their part in the lake which
[55:07] burneth with fire and brimstone which is
[55:09] the second death now see Church this
[55:13] I've just read on this this morning this
[55:14] has to be those who like Judas failed to
[55:18] repent because Abraham lied twice he
[55:22] lied to the king of Egypt and he lied
[55:24] Abimelech the Philistine King right
[55:28] Isaac lied to that one I think was the
[55:31] Egyptian king again the Bible said all
[55:33] Liars were burned so it doesn't mean
[55:36] Abraham and Isaac ax didn't I they did
[55:39] lie it doesn't mean by Ram didn't lie
[55:41] but they were trusting in the Lamb of
[55:43] God they were trusting in the Lamb of
[55:45] God just like the wipe away all their
[55:47] tears he wipe away all their sins to
[55:49] praise God he's able to wipe away all of
[55:52] our troubles that are our sins in our
[55:55] knit booties what about that whoremonger
[56:00] of the the woman at the well six men she
[56:04] went from one house to the second to the
[56:06] third to the fourth to the fifth and
[56:08] then the sixth one she's in that one and
[56:10] Jesus says none of those are your
[56:12] husband you've already had six alright
[56:15] she was a whoremonger but not once the
[56:19] blood of Jesus Christ when she received
[56:21] Christ as a messiah
[56:22] now when that happened she because God's
[56:25] grace was able to wash it all away
[56:28] praise God amen but these are those who
[56:32] don't repent of fear I'm scared to
[56:34] preach I'm scared to have a ministry the
[56:36] fearful I'm scared to stay in the
[56:38] message I'm scared to go to church I'm
[56:41] scared to witness the people you know
[56:43] I'm just giving examples the fearful
[56:46] those who won't repent of fear unbeliev
[56:52] they just don't believe I don't believe
[56:54] he was a prophet I don't believe I don't
[56:57] believe Jesus is the Son of God the
[56:59] environment of all homosexuality
[57:01] bestiality cross-dressing those that
[57:05] won't repent and the murderers right
[57:08] like Cain like Adolf Hitler sorcerers
[57:13] witchcraft and these are drug people
[57:15] because sorcery is always linked to drug
[57:17] so those people that that die of these
[57:19] overdoses and fail to repent and never
[57:22] admit they're wrong and they love the
[57:24] witchcraft more than they love the
[57:26] things of God idolaters now I believe in
[57:31] there will be people that worship
[57:32] brother random just like they worship
[57:34] all idolaters and they don't say they're
[57:40] sorry they don't repent they have their
[57:44] part in the lake of fire which burns
[57:46] with fire and brimstone this is the
[57:48] second death I hope you feel like God is
[57:56] helping you to be ready to go to that
[57:57] city praise God your prayer ought to be
[58:01] Lord take all the fear out of my life
[58:03] take all my unbelief out that's why I
[58:06] like that Jairus is prayer lord I
[58:08] believe help my unbelief I believe I got
[58:12] a little bit of unbelief fear hanging
[58:14] around help my unbelief help me to cast
[58:16] it down murdering whoremongers sorcerers
[58:24] are doubters Liars Lord forgive me for
[58:28] lying forgive me for my lustful thoughts
[58:33] because spiritual whoremonger you same
[58:35] as physical murdering us speaking evil
[58:38] about people God take my tongue forgive
[58:41] me for what I say I really want to try
[58:43] to be different I don't want to say
[58:44] anything evil about anybody I don't want
[58:47] to be separated from you I want to be
[58:49] with you but those that won't say
[58:53] they're sorry those that won't admit
[58:55] their sins he has to separate them and
[58:59] listen church he's not doing anything
[59:01] that they didn't want they didn't want
[59:03] to be with him and they proved it
[59:06] because they they rejected the holy
[59:08] spirit that would come to them service
[59:10] after service right I mean the Holy
[59:13] Spirit was so kind and gentle he was
[59:15] like it's like he was sending them
[59:16] flowers every week right
[59:19] when your love you send people gifts and
[59:21] you know show them your love well that's
[59:23] what God was God was trying to send his
[59:24] love one love letter after another He
[59:28] healed them
[59:29] he gave them life he gave them a health
[59:31] and strength and good money and jobs oh
[59:33] but they turned it down and they didn't
[59:35] want his presence there in their life
[59:37] snow so Jesus will say I'll give you
[59:40] what you want you don't want to be in my
[59:41] presence
[59:42] that's mercy that's love and it won't be
[59:45] for your eternity it'll be a just
[59:47] punishment right but he said love letter
[59:51] after love letter mercy after mercy and
[59:54] they turn it down and still in a repent
[59:56] of their evil deeds so Jesus says fine
[59:59] you can have what you want you didn't
[1:00:03] want my Holy Spirit to correct your fear
[1:00:05] or unbelief or abominations or murders
[1:00:08] or whoremongers or idolatry or lying
[1:00:11] then you can have that separation from
[1:00:14] my Holy Spirit verse nut and there came
[1:00:19] unto me one of the seven angels which
[1:00:20] had the seven vials full of the seven
[1:00:22] last plagues and I'm in the rope no
[1:00:25] that's right yeah and talked with me
[1:00:27] saying come either I will show the the
[1:00:29] bride the Lambs wife no the one who had
[1:00:32] the seven vials is now introducing them
[1:00:34] to the bride so he went from judgment
[1:00:36] he's introducing judgment pouring out
[1:00:38] judgment now to introducing the bride
[1:00:40] what a job what a job he goes from
[1:00:43] judgment to to holiness praise God to
[1:00:46] beauty verse 10 and he carried me away
[1:00:49] in the spirit to a great and high
[1:00:51] mountain and showed me that great city
[1:00:52] the holy Jerusalem descending out of
[1:00:55] heaven from God having the glory of God
[1:00:59] and her light was like unto a stone most
[1:01:01] precious even like a Jasper stone clear
[1:01:04] as crystal it had a wall great and high
[1:01:08] and had twelve gates and at the gates
[1:01:10] twelve angels and names written thereon
[1:01:14] which are the names of the 12 tribes of
[1:01:16] the turret of Israel on the east three
[1:01:19] gates on
[1:01:20] North three gates on the South three
[1:01:21] gates and on the west three gates and
[1:01:23] all and the wall of the city had twelve
[1:01:25] foundations and in them names of the
[1:01:27] Twelve Apostles of the Lamb and either
[1:01:31] talk with me had a golden Reed to
[1:01:33] measure the city and the gates thereof
[1:01:35] in the wall of their own and the city
[1:01:37] lieth Foursquare and the length is as
[1:01:39] large as a breath and he measured the
[1:01:40] City of the reed twelve thousand
[1:01:42] furlongs and the length and the breadth
[1:01:44] and the height of it are equal case you
[1:01:48] just switch over here I just want to
[1:01:50] show that picture again I of a couple
[1:01:52] years ago when I preached this here just
[1:01:55] such a beautiful picture so the the
[1:02:10] measurement of the city the twelve
[1:02:13] thousand cubits here is one thousand
[1:02:16] five hundred ninety seven miles from the
[1:02:17] capital to capital from Maine to Florida
[1:02:19] this is just the city itself remember
[1:02:22] the earth has to rise up to meet it
[1:02:25] where is he going to get all that earth
[1:02:27] he'll do it he'll do it I don't know how
[1:02:31] he's gonna do it but he'll do it maybe
[1:02:33] would be that volcanic that'll raise up
[1:02:34] and gush out and just raise up such a
[1:02:37] platform for this city to sit on it's a
[1:02:40] call to high mountain and he did talk
[1:02:46] with me yes okay now Foursquare verse
[1:02:49] seventeen and he measured the wall there
[1:02:51] have a hundred and forty and four cubits
[1:02:53] according to the measurements of a man
[1:02:54] that is of the angel in the city and the
[1:02:57] building of the wall that was Jasper and
[1:02:59] the city was pure gold like unto clear
[1:03:01] glass see all these companies that you
[1:03:04] know like Apple I was watching Apple
[1:03:06] they built a new building in New York
[1:03:10] and that they're not like the other
[1:03:12] companies where they just do concrete
[1:03:13] and drywall they make there's of all
[1:03:15] glass and aa at the perversion that's a
[1:03:21] cut that's an imitation because God city
[1:03:24] is just like that it's transparent glass
[1:03:27] see because a Christian is always
[1:03:29] transparent praise God right now there
[1:03:32] are some mistakes will hide which are
[1:03:34] hide things but really when you're
[1:03:35] annoyed for the Holy Spirit you've got
[1:03:36] nothing to hide
[1:03:37] raise god your life is open birth praise
[1:03:40] the Lord
[1:03:41] like I told that Willard guy on from New
[1:03:42] York he's liking about this brother that
[1:03:44] left the message he put this video I
[1:03:45] said I'll take any question you got
[1:03:47] about the message I said I'm totally
[1:03:49] transparent my life's an open book if I
[1:03:51] don't have the answer I'm gonna wait til
[1:03:53] I get it and I'll put it on the Shelf I
[1:03:55] won't put up there too long right
[1:03:58] I don't we put up there too long but
[1:04:00] I'll wait for God's time to take it off
[1:04:02] the shelf and bring it down and
[1:04:04] understand it by God's grace there's a
[1:04:08] lot of evil out there man there's a lot
[1:04:11] of mocking and making fun of God's
[1:04:13] profit from people that have left but
[1:04:16] you but I'll show my wife some of the
[1:04:17] pictures this week some of the people on
[1:04:19] Facebook that used to preach it now they
[1:04:21] marry people and the women is just
[1:04:23] showing her whole entire chest and one
[1:04:27] of them married a family member and
[1:04:31] they're exposing their midriff tanned in
[1:04:33] short shorts that's their wedding outfit
[1:04:35] short shorts and showing all kinds of
[1:04:37] cleavage that used to preach this
[1:04:39] message but see member in that city
[1:04:42] there'll be no nothing that works
[1:04:43] abomination praise God how did I hear ya
[1:04:46] so this is what this is what the fruits
[1:04:49] of leaving the Word of God because but
[1:04:51] it's not leaving brother Branham
[1:04:52] necessarily it's leaving the word that
[1:04:54] he preached because Motorama is not the
[1:04:57] message he preached the message which is
[1:04:59] God's Word so there always has to be
[1:05:03] fruits of leaving but church our lives
[1:05:06] are open book we're not scared of any
[1:05:09] question we might not be able to
[1:05:11] understand it but we've got to look at
[1:05:13] all the proof and we got to look at all
[1:05:15] the evidence that he was a prophet and
[1:05:18] Lord willing I'll be doing that in the
[1:05:19] next few weeks Lord winning once I get
[1:05:21] done with the revelation series I got a
[1:05:23] lot of thoughts about I want to go
[1:05:26] through I like I said I'm last Sunday
[1:05:27] although 17 right now Jose and I were
[1:05:30] working a little bit we've got 17 things
[1:05:31] rogram said that clearly weren't thus
[1:05:33] saith the Lord and even 1977 program
[1:05:36] says that completely says this is not
[1:05:39] the Lord this is me that's an exact
[1:05:42] quote now how people can stay in there
[1:05:44] and say everywhere it was us that the
[1:05:46] Lord when he says
[1:05:47] is not the Lord those people are
[1:05:49] delusional they've taken on the spirit
[1:05:52] of a lie because they won't accept the
[1:05:56] truth so because they won't accept the
[1:05:58] truth God's given them over to a lie and
[1:06:01] they've held it for decades the only
[1:06:04] hope is God's mercy that they'll open up
[1:06:06] their hearts and repent and say they're
[1:06:08] sorry for the sins of idolatry that's
[1:06:12] right and you know it's tied to money if
[1:06:16] you can't see any outward sins like
[1:06:17] sexual sins then you know money's behind
[1:06:19] it somewhere because the love of money
[1:06:22] is the root of worshiping brother
[1:06:24] Branham hello the love of money is
[1:06:30] behind all of it
[1:06:32] I got seventeen so if you know other
[1:06:37] times he said something let me know
[1:06:38] but RAM said you're 80% water and
[1:06:40] petroleum petroleum is crude oil that
[1:06:43] they it's a harvest and then they have
[1:06:45] to refine that to get gasoline are you
[1:06:48] eighty percent gasoline no but in my
[1:06:52] soul I've got gasoline I got fire you
[1:06:58] see so I want to go through those own
[1:07:02] show all right I'm gonna show you all
[1:07:03] the quotes under this banner of God's
[1:07:06] Spirit rightly divides the word of truth
[1:07:08] and we are a transparent people praise
[1:07:12] God and the bye wouldn't say prove some
[1:07:16] of the issues and some of the things you
[1:07:18] like to talk about but not the others
[1:07:20] the bargains they prove some things the
[1:07:22] Bible said prove all things some people
[1:07:25] like to stay away from their they don't
[1:07:27] want to touch it well most of us don't
[1:07:28] want to touch it
[1:07:29] but we know if the Bible says prove all
[1:07:31] things and we've got the Spirit of Truth
[1:07:33] the Spirit will direct us into the proof
[1:07:35] of all true things amen right now I
[1:07:40] brought down to brother Branham either
[1:07:41] me to either sin like when he lied to
[1:07:43] the IRS which we all do or he made an
[1:07:47] honest mistake
[1:07:48] with like 1977 that's just the honest
[1:07:52] mistake he just made a prediction it
[1:07:54] wasn't right or
[1:07:58] like a slip of the tongue Oh that'd be
[1:07:59] an honest mistake too I've got a few
[1:08:01] other ones but see this city is
[1:08:04] transparent see how I get off on that
[1:08:07] God loves transparency praise God amen
[1:08:11] and I don't own human ability we're
[1:08:14] trying to be more transparent Church I'm
[1:08:15] not saying we're perfect I'm not saying
[1:08:17] that we don't hide things like you know
[1:08:19] we don't want to go around telling
[1:08:20] people all of our sins all the time so
[1:08:21] we don't do that
[1:08:22] but once we know they're on that once
[1:08:24] we've set totem to Jesus
[1:08:25] once we've confessed them to Jesus then
[1:08:27] they are into the blood praise God they
[1:08:29] are forgiven and we all live in a
[1:08:31] transparent life praise God
[1:08:33] hey man that wasn't planning on
[1:08:38] appreciate that either verse 19 and the
[1:08:41] foundations of the wall of the city were
[1:08:42] garnished with all manner of precious
[1:08:44] stones the first foundation was jasper
[1:08:47] the second sapphire the third chalcedony
[1:08:52] the fourth an emerald the fifth sardonyx
[1:08:55] the sixth sardius the seventh christ so
[1:08:59] light the eighth beryl the ninth topaz
[1:09:01] the tenth a Christ so pricess and the
[1:09:05] eleventh a giant and twelfth an amethyst
[1:09:08] and the twelve gates were twelve pearls
[1:09:11] every several gate was of the one pearl
[1:09:14] and the street of the city was pure gold
[1:09:16] as it were transparent glass now
[1:09:18] remember we read it on his Wednesday
[1:09:20] night the Bible said the nations of the
[1:09:22] world will flow into this it's so high
[1:09:25] up there but yet they'll flow like water
[1:09:29] and so God will give them such strength
[1:09:32] our bodies will be so pure so the holy
[1:09:35] it's like when we will be going uphill
[1:09:37] but it's like we're running downhill
[1:09:39] praise God because it'll just be flipped
[1:09:43] if it's a different civilization praise
[1:09:45] God so it's going to have different laws
[1:09:47] amen
[1:09:48] you won't need to see any more praise
[1:09:51] God
[1:09:51] you'll flow upward praise the Lord amen
[1:09:55] see the laws of nature are now subject
[1:09:58] to the God in you amen
[1:10:02] right now we're subject to these laws
[1:10:04] unless God does America right speak to
[1:10:06] the storm or something like that speak
[1:10:08] to squirrels or speak something like
[1:10:09] that but then the Bible said the
[1:10:12] I've said before we'll call he'll
[1:10:13] already answer beautiful hmm where's 21
[1:10:22] and the 12 gates were twelve pearls
[1:10:24] every several gate was of one pearl and
[1:10:27] the street of the city was pure gold as
[1:10:28] it were transparent glass and I saw no
[1:10:31] temple therein for the Lord God Almighty
[1:10:33] and the lamb are the temple of it and
[1:10:40] the city had no need of the Sun neither
[1:10:42] of the moon to shine in it for the glory
[1:10:44] of God did lighten it and the lamb is
[1:10:46] the light thereof oh my now I didn't
[1:10:51] have need of it it looks like it's still
[1:10:52] there the Sun may still be there no
[1:10:54] doubt the moon no doubt but the glory of
[1:10:57] God will be the light thereof I believe
[1:11:00] got to let that moon stay there forever
[1:11:02] as a reminder praise the Lord that
[1:11:07] that's what we are ready men we have no
[1:11:10] goodness of our own it is only when
[1:11:12] Christ is reflecting off us that we have
[1:11:15] any benefit at all praise God verse 24
[1:11:21] and the nations of them which are saved
[1:11:22] shall walk in the light of it and the
[1:11:25] kings of the earth do bring their glory
[1:11:26] and honor into programs that's tithes
[1:11:28] and offerings and he said your tithes
[1:11:30] and offerings are eternal
[1:11:31] because for all eternity the nations are
[1:11:34] gonna be paying their tithes and
[1:11:35] offerings probably cuz they didn't pay
[1:11:37] him right the first time
[1:11:38] Amen Church maybe they said them to some
[1:11:42] headquarters instead of saying to their
[1:11:45] local ministry oh you don't think God
[1:11:49] cares about that God watches every
[1:11:50] single penny doesn't he
[1:11:51] if God watches every word you say and
[1:11:55] every idle word will be a count enough
[1:11:57] thank God for the blood for that one
[1:11:59] amen if God watches every hair of your
[1:12:01] head and knows that we have your head
[1:12:03] that God is watching over all your
[1:12:05] tithes and offerings go to so you can
[1:12:08] have nations for all eternity that he
[1:12:10] allows to be saved bring their tithes
[1:12:12] and offerings right here this right here
[1:12:13] bring their tithes and offerings in the
[1:12:15] house of the Lord they're gonna glorify
[1:12:18] God they're gonna give back to God what
[1:12:20] He has given graciously to them for all
[1:12:22] eternity
[1:12:28] what is your glory and honor well your
[1:12:30] praises your worship we know that but
[1:12:32] tithes and offerings of the
[1:12:33] representation of your honor unto the
[1:12:35] Lord Lord you've given me this paycheck
[1:12:38] you give me this job it is my honor to
[1:12:41] give you back just a tenth of this and
[1:12:46] the gates of it shall not be shut at all
[1:12:49] by day for there shall be no night there
[1:12:53] amen there's no there's gonna be no
[1:12:55] devil slip in their face amen
[1:12:58] no y'all worry about closing it for
[1:13:00] enemies cuz all the enemies are done
[1:13:02] away with Amen thank God and they shall
[1:13:06] bring the glory to honor the nation's
[1:13:08] into it and there shall no wise enter
[1:13:11] into it any thing that defileth neither
[1:13:13] work if abomination or maketh a lie but
[1:13:16] they which are written in the Lamb's
[1:13:19] Book of Life oh thank you Lord Jesus now
[1:13:23] let's hit a few themes that I just want
[1:13:25] to hit a few highlights here
[1:13:26] I got about I just maybe go about half
[1:13:28] an hour more by God's grace yeah amen
[1:13:32] thank you sir praise God like I said
[1:13:35] some of this will be review but I feel
[1:13:37] like I got to I got to finish this this
[1:13:39] thought here yeah I've gone 107 sermons
[1:13:41] I gotta finish it up here brother
[1:13:43] Branham said he took a year and a half
[1:13:44] to preach the whole book of Revelation
[1:13:47] so I wanna do the same thing so we're
[1:13:49] all on the same understanding as close
[1:13:51] as possible to the revelation here by
[1:13:53] God's grace now here's how I organize
[1:13:58] that I went through the timing of this
[1:14:00] chapter is very chronological the New
[1:14:03] Jerusalem must first descend from heaven
[1:14:05] and then the gates will open allowing
[1:14:07] entrance in the holy city and all the
[1:14:09] glory and honour from every nation will
[1:14:11] flow into her with met with through her
[1:14:15] magnificent gates and her magnificent
[1:14:17] walls amen so it comes down and then
[1:14:21] after the the gates swing open and the
[1:14:23] kings of the earth have had now think
[1:14:25] about that they've had time to go
[1:14:27] farming out there they've had time to
[1:14:30] harvest raise God they that time and
[1:14:33] then they flow and then they bring in
[1:14:35] their glory and honor into this holy
[1:14:36] city
[1:14:37] so we see the the order of this event
[1:14:41] here praise God
[1:14:43] now there's three so there's two themes
[1:14:46] here there's the new heaven and the new
[1:14:47] earth and there's the new jerusalem in
[1:14:50] this chapter as we've seen the new
[1:14:53] heaven and earth fulfills 2nd Peter 3:7
[1:14:57] so let's go there 2nd Peter 3:7 these
[1:15:07] will be a little bit of review here but
[1:15:08] I I just can't skip it because I know
[1:15:10] that I got children here and I got to
[1:15:12] get this attitude in my heart and mind I
[1:15:14] wonder just gonna solidify that I want
[1:15:16] to be happy about more happy about the
[1:15:17] people that stay than the people that go
[1:15:19] or the new people that come like Denis
[1:15:22] McBride told me I love that I want to be
[1:15:24] more happy that thank God some are still
[1:15:27] here praising the Lord what can I do to
[1:15:30] help out the faithful ones who stay with
[1:15:32] God's Word praise God that's why you see
[1:15:35] big smile on my face today you know and
[1:15:37] whatever people leave or whatever I
[1:15:38] always want to feel sad but I can't be
[1:15:40] sad I got to be thankful for those who
[1:15:42] have stayed praise God now I was
[1:15:45] thinking there's I think there's reasons
[1:15:46] God has shown me why this church has to
[1:15:48] be small I was thinking about I'm trying
[1:15:49] to place all the dots together for God's
[1:15:51] will for my life trying to play by this
[1:15:54] man maybe that that just trying to place
[1:15:57] it together praise God God knows I've
[1:15:59] tried to do as much as I can to be a
[1:16:00] blessing to people praise God help them
[1:16:03] out in times of need or visited them or
[1:16:05] try to do everything I can do to help
[1:16:07] people out 2nd Peter 3:7 what the
[1:16:11] heavens and the earth which are now by
[1:16:13] the same word are kept in store reserved
[1:16:15] unto fire against the day of judgment
[1:16:17] and perdition of ungodly men but beloved
[1:16:22] be not ignorant of this one thing that
[1:16:23] one day is with the Lord as a thousand
[1:16:27] years and a thousand years as one day
[1:16:30] remember that was from David David wrote
[1:16:32] that in Psalms 94 so this is Old
[1:16:36] Testament so Peters looking back Old
[1:16:38] Testament and he's bringing to his day
[1:16:40] and he feels were almost ready for the
[1:16:43] day of the Lord amen
[1:16:44] praise God the Lord is not slack
[1:16:48] concerning his promise as some men count
[1:16:50] slackness
[1:16:51] but is long-suffering to us-ward not
[1:16:53] willing that any should perish but that
[1:16:55] all should come to repentance amen
[1:16:58] jokes let's not be discouraged each year
[1:16:59] that passes let's not be discouraged all
[1:17:01] the rapture didn't come let's not be
[1:17:03] discouraged let's remember it's more
[1:17:05] time to get our level and saved it's our
[1:17:08] chance to try to keep some from being
[1:17:11] rejected from the prints of God and be
[1:17:14] tossed off in the lake of fire oh my
[1:17:17] let's remember that this is God's mercy
[1:17:20] and God's long-suffering praise God
[1:17:24] because he's not willing that any should
[1:17:27] come to perish God wants everybody to
[1:17:29] say I'm sorry forgive me I'm changing my
[1:17:32] life through your power and he wants
[1:17:34] everyone to repent me baptized in the
[1:17:36] name of Lord Jesus Christ but not all
[1:17:38] will do it well thankful we can do it
[1:17:41] praise the Lord amen but the day of the
[1:17:44] Lord will come as a thief in the night
[1:17:46] in which the heavens shall pass away
[1:17:49] with a great noise and the elements
[1:17:51] shall melt with fervent heat and the
[1:17:53] earth also and the works that are
[1:17:55] therein shall be burned up now that just
[1:17:56] struck me I was talking to somebody this
[1:17:58] week about then how in the world can the
[1:18:00] rapture be after the tribulation if the
[1:18:03] tribulation happened first we would all
[1:18:05] expect the end of the world because we'd
[1:18:09] see seven plagues we'd see 7 trumpets
[1:18:13] blow and water turn to blood I mean
[1:18:15] anybody would know this the end of the
[1:18:17] world but the day that's not coming like
[1:18:21] a thief I think doesn't knock and say
[1:18:23] hey it's 9 o'clock p.m. but I'll be here
[1:18:25] at midnight get ready for me get your
[1:18:27] guns loaded so you can blow me away when
[1:18:30] I try to steal your Nintendo 64 whatever
[1:18:33] here oh your Apple computer how's that
[1:18:36] like that for me or your vehicle or your
[1:18:39] your Honda or your Nissan no it's not a
[1:18:42] thief of the night a thief he comes and
[1:18:45] you don't expect him and that's another
[1:18:47] proof that the rapture has to happen
[1:18:50] before God has to snatch his bride out
[1:18:52] of the way so that the judgments come
[1:18:54] quick and fast and they had a chance to
[1:18:57] repent but they repented not because the
[1:18:59] message had been preached to every
[1:19:01] nation then shall the end come
[1:19:03] hallelujah
[1:19:05] every nation gets a chance to hear the
[1:19:06] message of the hour that's beautiful man
[1:19:13] I never thought about like that there it
[1:19:14] is the fee for the night so even that
[1:19:17] the burning fire right before the
[1:19:19] Millenium right there where we're at
[1:19:20] walk upon the ashes of the wicked that
[1:19:22] is like it comes like a thief in the
[1:19:24] night the tribulation comes like a thief
[1:19:28] in the night
[1:19:29] that's another proof to it I guess
[1:19:31] that's what I need to use with that
[1:19:32] brother who mailed me about that seeing
[1:19:37] then that all these things will be
[1:19:38] dissolved a church think about that this
[1:19:41] building is gonna be dissolved some day
[1:19:43] your car out there which hopefully it's
[1:19:46] almost paid for thank God for that
[1:19:50] it's gonna dissolve someday so this
[1:19:54] gives us the ability to prioritize what
[1:19:58] is most important in life amen all these
[1:20:01] things and all these things are gonna
[1:20:02] beat us on what matter a person aren't
[1:20:05] you to be in all holy conversation and
[1:20:07] godliness because it's all going to
[1:20:10] dissolve except your soul is that right
[1:20:14] Church it's all going to dissolve except
[1:20:18] the soul of the believer and of course
[1:20:20] your body will be swallowed up right
[1:20:21] your physical body be swallowed up in
[1:20:23] the glorified body that won't dissolve
[1:20:25] but everything else will be dissolved by
[1:20:28] fire right atomic fire or volcanic fire
[1:20:32] everything else so what persons how
[1:20:35] should we live if we if we can look at
[1:20:37] everything and see it's all gonna be
[1:20:38] dissolved what should we place our
[1:20:40] attention on our conversation and our
[1:20:42] godliness we should be careful what we
[1:20:47] say praise God we should be careful to
[1:20:51] act just like God looking for and
[1:20:55] hasting unto the coming of the day of
[1:20:56] God wherein the heavens being on fire
[1:20:58] shall be dissolved and the elements
[1:21:00] shall melt with fervent heat there won't
[1:21:02] just be fire on the earth Church
[1:21:03] there'll be fire in the heavens we will
[1:21:07] be open the seventh dimension right
[1:21:09] before the Millennium but there'll be
[1:21:12] fire around the earth and they'll be
[1:21:13] fire some type of spiritual fire there
[1:21:15] in the heavens because they even
[1:21:17] heavens will melt the Bible says with
[1:21:20] fervent heat now look at verse this is
[1:21:27] my preaching abbien verse 14 wherefore
[1:21:29] beloved seeing that you look for such
[1:21:31] things be diligent there it is there's
[1:21:33] that word diligence well Jim after I
[1:21:37] preached that on Sunday morning now he
[1:21:38] comes up he says look I just preached on
[1:21:39] diligence twice this month he showed me
[1:21:41] the copies of his sermon notes and I
[1:21:44] preached that here about being diligent
[1:21:45] praise God see being faithful being a
[1:21:49] dedicated that's a I appreciate brother
[1:21:54] Williams saying about that me said he
[1:21:55] said brother Jesse's a faithful man that
[1:21:57] made me feel good
[1:21:57] because I want to be faithful I don't
[1:22:00] want to be unfaithful I want to be
[1:22:02] diligent so I'm faithful to the things
[1:22:03] of God that really blessed my heart I
[1:22:06] appreciate that from that man of God he
[1:22:09] knew ghin that you may be found in him
[1:22:11] in peace without spot and blameless amen
[1:22:15] praise God
[1:22:16] so preaching on revelation 20:1 should
[1:22:20] get us thinking about living a holy life
[1:22:22] and being diligent for for God's kingdom
[1:22:24] because that kingdom won't dissolve that
[1:22:27] kingdom is coming this kingdom is
[1:22:28] dissolving praise God let me say this
[1:22:32] Wall Street's gonna dissolve praise to
[1:22:35] God the White House is gonna dissolve
[1:22:37] all those big oil rigs out there off the
[1:22:40] Gulf Coast in Mexico they're gonna be
[1:22:42] dissolved they're making big money now
[1:22:44] and natural gas tanks and everything
[1:22:46] like that but it's all going to be
[1:22:48] dissolved what matters is our
[1:22:49] conversation and our godliness and our
[1:22:52] diligence to live a life of peace and
[1:22:56] blamelessness before the Lord and before
[1:22:59] his people hallelujah now the Bible said
[1:23:06] there's a great noise there's gonna be a
[1:23:08] massive explosion fervent heat the earth
[1:23:10] and the works are burned up along with
[1:23:12] the heavens there's no more sea no more
[1:23:15] physical temple no need for the light of
[1:23:17] the Sun and no nighttime for all things
[1:23:20] are new and I thought about that church
[1:23:23] no see I thought well the first thing
[1:23:26] came to my mind was to see a
[1:23:27] forgetfulness
[1:23:28] so God
[1:23:30] gonna even undo or do away with the sea
[1:23:32] of forgetfulness where's your sins in
[1:23:36] the sea of forgetfulness but then the
[1:23:37] New Jerusalem there's no more sea praise
[1:23:40] God there's no more record there there's
[1:23:42] no way to even think about it
[1:23:44] it's so deep and far gone and so washed
[1:23:46] away it's completely cleanse it's all
[1:23:49] holiness praise God Amen even the sea
[1:23:53] where my sins were tossed won't be able
[1:23:55] to find it anymore
[1:23:56] praise God hallelujah amen
[1:23:59] just these look at these little symbols
[1:24:02] that he gives us what a blessing praise
[1:24:06] God what a privilege to serve Him
[1:24:08] remember John was previously invited to
[1:24:12] see the great in 17:1 the filthy
[1:24:16] woman but now he's invited to see the
[1:24:20] great holy city the bride the Lambs wife
[1:24:23] amen praise God what an invitation amen
[1:24:29] the angel shows him the immoral city the
[1:24:32] statues and think of all the abortions
[1:24:35] done and all the the bodies of those
[1:24:37] immoral men that are buried there under
[1:24:39] the catacombs right
[1:24:41] they keep praying over those bones of
[1:24:44] bones that I think there's power and
[1:24:45] touching those bones and kissing those
[1:24:47] bones and God said that sorcery and
[1:24:50] they're lying to their people by saying
[1:24:53] there's virtue there there's no virtue
[1:24:55] in that there's virtue in the Holy
[1:24:56] Spirit and John sees the evil one first
[1:25:00] and then God says now I'm going to show
[1:25:02] you the holy one praise now what a way
[1:25:04] to end this vision how did they raise
[1:25:07] God he starts off by seeing Jesus in the
[1:25:10] white robe he falls down as one that's
[1:25:11] dead in the middle of it he sees the
[1:25:13] seals and all these things then he sees
[1:25:15] the unholy woman but God ends this
[1:25:17] glorious vision on the Isle Patmos by
[1:25:20] seeing the Lambs wife the bride amen I
[1:25:23] don't know you what a way to end it amen
[1:25:26] honey that's the end of our life -
[1:25:28] that's the end of our vision is that
[1:25:30] we're a part of that bride that we live
[1:25:32] in that city that we have eternal life
[1:25:34] with Christ that's the end of all my
[1:25:38] dreams brother Jose
[1:25:40] praise God that's the end of all my
[1:25:43] visions I don't have visions but maybe
[1:25:45] had one maybe that's the end of all of
[1:25:48] it is to see the real true character I'm
[1:25:52] Jesus Christ God living in his people
[1:25:55] praise God that's what the scripture
[1:25:58] said he said I will be God he said I'll
[1:26:00] be their God I'll be with them for those
[1:26:04] say this is what God wanted the whole
[1:26:05] time that's what I'm writing that next
[1:26:07] chapter in my next book in the in in
[1:26:09] Genesis God wanted to walk with Adam and
[1:26:12] it was glorious their communion and the
[1:26:15] fullness of the day praise God the
[1:26:17] coolness of the evening and he come down
[1:26:19] and say praise the Lord Adam how you
[1:26:20] doing today Marty
[1:26:22] you say you praise the Lord they read
[1:26:26] walk and fellowship and how is he even
[1:26:27] doing and you know how are you doing
[1:26:29] today that such fellowship God was
[1:26:32] walking with them but God wasn't
[1:26:34] satisfied with that he said this is a
[1:26:35] pretty good Eden but their swarm is
[1:26:37] going to be greater I just don't want to
[1:26:39] walk with them I want to walk in them
[1:26:41] praise God hey man I want to be their
[1:26:45] very source of life that's the power of
[1:26:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the Old
[1:26:50] Testament that anointing would leave
[1:26:51] come and go come and go come and go
[1:26:54] David's leaves slays a lion but then he
[1:26:56] kills Uriah it just comes and go and God
[1:26:59] wasn't satisfied but it was a teacher to
[1:27:01] teach them that they needed more of God
[1:27:03] amen
[1:27:04] and so when the Holy Ghost fell they got
[1:27:07] a new birth and they Peter said this is
[1:27:10] that God is pouring out his spirit on
[1:27:12] sons and daughters and Paul picks it up
[1:27:15] and says I will be their God I will
[1:27:17] speak in them I will look in them and
[1:27:19] they will be my children they will be my
[1:27:21] people
[1:27:22] oh what a blessing today to be God's
[1:27:25] people praise God that he can live in us
[1:27:28] and talk through us oh you don't believe
[1:27:31] that's possible God can talk through you
[1:27:32] it is possible I showed you that quote
[1:27:35] that email I got this week where the
[1:27:37] woman read my book in two days and she
[1:27:39] said it's like Christ was talking to me
[1:27:41] hallelujah that's pretty good evidence
[1:27:44] Lydia that God likes to talk through
[1:27:46] living and living people praise God
[1:27:50] I wasn't right in that book it was
[1:27:53] Christ riding that book I got proof
[1:27:56] people's lives are changed they're the
[1:27:58] ones saying it was Christ talking to
[1:28:00] them amen and that's what God wanted
[1:28:04] from the beginning not just to be with
[1:28:05] him but to be in them praise God
[1:28:08] possessing the very bodies that his
[1:28:11] spoken word spoke and the dust that he
[1:28:14] pulled it from the earth and spoke life
[1:28:15] into it and now he's fully gonna possess
[1:28:18] them and he's gonna dwell them as long
[1:28:20] as they'll beat it and they yield to the
[1:28:22] Holy Spirit ha ha ha
[1:28:24] thank the Lord amen aren't you happy
[1:28:27] today Church Sankranthi at 6 I just kind
[1:28:32] of came to my heart here I've been
[1:28:32] dealing with this scripture now this is
[1:28:40] a of course a dating scripture art
[1:28:42] lessons a dating courtship pardon me a
[1:28:45] courtship scripture obviously verse 14
[1:28:51] sikerly and 6:14 be not unequally yoked
[1:28:53] together with unbelievers for what
[1:28:54] fellowship hath righteousness with
[1:28:56] unrighteousness and what communion hath
[1:28:58] light with darkness so see Church when
[1:28:59] you you know if you're on a mission if
[1:29:02] God wants you to be among sinners he's
[1:29:04] sending you on a mission but he's never
[1:29:06] gonna send you amongst unbelievers where
[1:29:08] you're gonna fall because there's no
[1:29:10] temptation God will never give you a
[1:29:12] temptation too hard
[1:29:14] praise God he's never gonna give you a
[1:29:16] two-time taste ream hardly hard
[1:29:19] temptation where I can't overcome that I
[1:29:20] got a given into sin know there's times
[1:29:24] you know where we will be amongst
[1:29:26] unbelievers but if God has called us
[1:29:29] there he's called us there to shine the
[1:29:31] light of God's love to them but we are
[1:29:35] not to unequally yoked ourselves right
[1:29:38] because we have no fellowship when you
[1:29:41] realize that you're amongst people and
[1:29:43] you really have no fellowship it's best
[1:29:44] that you leave praise God if you finish
[1:29:49] your mission that God told you to do or
[1:29:51] God's called you to do it's time to move
[1:29:53] on because you can have no fellowship
[1:29:54] with the things of darkness praise God
[1:29:58] like look at Jonah Jonah is a good
[1:30:00] example he went in there to preach the
[1:30:02] word and went sat outside the gate
[1:30:04] because he didn't know are they gonna
[1:30:05] stuff that or not of course he didn't
[1:30:06] want them to accept it but they did
[1:30:08] accept it he went there he blasted the
[1:30:10] way at 40 days 40 days 40 days and all
[1:30:13] the kings and all the animals even
[1:30:14] fasted bye talk about a revival praise
[1:30:18] God even the air those aren't allowed to
[1:30:21] eat no one's allowed to eat because we
[1:30:23] want to show our sincerity to God is
[1:30:27] that right so see then he broke and made
[1:30:31] sure we had no fellowship that's what we
[1:30:35] see our lives should be to well Concord
[1:30:38] hath Christ with Belial or what part
[1:30:40] hath he that believeth with an infidel
[1:30:44] see there's not much you can fellowship
[1:30:46] around right with unbelievers what do
[1:30:48] you talk about can't talk about the Lord
[1:30:52] and what agreement hath the temple of
[1:30:56] God with idols for you're the temple the
[1:30:58] Living God as God has said I will dwell
[1:31:01] in them and walk in them and I will be
[1:31:05] their God and they shall be my people
[1:31:09] this is what it's all about
[1:31:13] this is what God didn't have in the
[1:31:16] first Eton he just walked with Adam but
[1:31:19] now in this last Eden now he's not
[1:31:21] walking with us he's walking in us he's
[1:31:24] giving us a portion of eternal life and
[1:31:26] it's a permanent deposit in our souls
[1:31:28] and then our glorified body praise God
[1:31:31] oh it's always an obedience to that
[1:31:33] eternal life that's within us praise God
[1:31:37] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:31:39] be separate saith the Lord and touch not
[1:31:41] the unclean thing and I will receive you
[1:31:43] so see the way God receives you as first
[1:31:47] he gives you his word and then you have
[1:31:48] to prove it you have to prove to God
[1:31:50] that you've received his word by not
[1:31:52] associating with sinful things and then
[1:31:55] God receives you that's kinda like God
[1:31:57] gives you a little test here's my word
[1:31:59] are you gonna obey it or not and he
[1:32:00] steps back he gives you the test am I
[1:32:04] gonna touch the unclean thing or not and
[1:32:06] he said I'll receive you if I give you
[1:32:09] my word
[1:32:09] and you don't touch it he said then I'll
[1:32:11] receive you praise God just like the
[1:32:13] tree of knowledge and good and evil amen
[1:32:16] hallelujah then I'll receive you and
[1:32:20] I'll be a father unto you and ye shall
[1:32:22] be my sons and daughters saith the Lord
[1:32:24] Almighty
[1:32:25] whoa in that beautiful church is that
[1:32:28] beautiful or what this is what God
[1:32:31] wanted he wanted to dwell inside them
[1:32:34] praise God that New Jerusalem the holy
[1:32:38] great city is described in all of its
[1:32:39] beauty and splendor
[1:32:40] it's likened to a bride adorned for her
[1:32:42] husband it has a glorious light it's
[1:32:45] clear as crystal a great high wall with
[1:32:47] 12 foundation in 12 gates showing God's
[1:32:50] faithful dedication to his covenant
[1:32:52] promises to the 12 tribes of Israel and
[1:32:54] the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ the
[1:32:58] measurements of his Foursquare City
[1:32:59] prove it must be the shape of a pyramid
[1:33:01] for a cube-shaped city would not allow
[1:33:04] for the light of the Lamb to reach every
[1:33:06] area in the city and the nations that
[1:33:08] are without the city right if it's a
[1:33:12] cube if it's a cube and the lights up
[1:33:14] here if the lights up here is any light
[1:33:16] gonna get down here right here there
[1:33:18] like it no no it's just gonna shine out
[1:33:20] here they'll be no light so it has to be
[1:33:23] a pyramid it's at the very top that's
[1:33:24] kind of hard to say
[1:33:25] huh kinda hard to do that if I don't
[1:33:27] have a pier in front of me but the
[1:33:28] pyramid the light goes all directions
[1:33:30] praise God it's able to go in every
[1:33:33] direction so Christ can be the light to
[1:33:35] everybody
[1:33:37] amen the kingdom Jesus waited for that
[1:33:43] Satan labor form it's now come how do
[1:33:48] you praise God amen beautiful Jesus
[1:33:53] they're gonna stand there and the New
[1:33:55] Jerusalem and I look around and said
[1:33:58] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:34:03] praise God
[1:34:04] Satan said try and take it now before
[1:34:06] the cross try to take it now and she
[1:34:09] said no I'm catching a vision then I'll
[1:34:12] receive it later on in the future home
[1:34:14] praise God hey man how did it yeah thank
[1:34:19] you Jesus and Church murmur if you
[1:34:23] overcome now your rule over cities and
[1:34:25] nations if you can over
[1:34:28] now don't take it now take it later
[1:34:30] praise God
[1:34:31] rule over your own small ministry your
[1:34:34] own small gifts rule over that
[1:34:36] faithfully now you should be so faithful
[1:34:38] with the gifts God has placed in your
[1:34:39] life just be faithful with them be
[1:34:41] dedicated to them and then if we're
[1:34:43] faithful with the little things the big
[1:34:45] thing will come later neither very all
[1:34:53] the things Satan showed him all the
[1:34:54] kingdoms of the world are all dissolved
[1:34:57] now the glory of Babylon of the glory of
[1:35:01] Rome and the glory of New York City it's
[1:35:04] all burnt down and dissolved the very
[1:35:07] temptation is gone
[1:35:08] the only Kingdom is the kingdom of God
[1:35:12] and Jesus is worthy and he's the proven
[1:35:15] rightful ruler of this city praise God
[1:35:19] now the revelations give me a few more
[1:35:21] minutes here I noticed five important
[1:35:27] revelations in here now of course
[1:35:29] there's more but when I wrote this
[1:35:30] script I think I wrote it two years ago
[1:35:32] and I'm still on chapter v 14 I think as
[1:35:35] far as my youtube videos I've done
[1:35:36] chapters 1 to 14 so I'm left off at 15
[1:35:39] there cuz I want to lay in these other
[1:35:40] teaching videos first but I wrote this a
[1:35:44] couple years ago the first symbol is
[1:35:48] that a set of the New Jerusalem I said
[1:35:50] this earlier is coming down from God out
[1:35:52] of heaven and this is a beautiful
[1:35:54] picture of God coming to physically and
[1:35:56] eternally dwell with his people
[1:35:58] it was prefigured at Jesus baptism at
[1:36:01] the River Jordan when God the Father in
[1:36:04] the form of a dove descended to unite
[1:36:06] and dwell in the body of Jesus the Son
[1:36:09] of God
[1:36:10] uniting heaven and earth and this is the
[1:36:12] same spirit filling experienced by every
[1:36:16] born-again child of God today as the
[1:36:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost unites the
[1:36:21] Spirit of Christ from heaven into the
[1:36:23] earthly vessel of the new believer
[1:36:25] praise God amen if you are born again
[1:36:27] today Church you've already experienced
[1:36:30] in a prefigure the future home coming to
[1:36:33] the earth amen
[1:36:34] you've already experienced that as a
[1:36:36] prefigure you know it's like for heaven
[1:36:40] to touch earth praise God
[1:36:42] haha hi-yah that's a great symbol there
[1:36:46] that God gives us so it's like we're all
[1:36:53] gonna experience being born again again
[1:36:55] right if you're born again about the
[1:36:58] only ghost you've already done born
[1:36:59] again but now you get the experience
[1:37:00] being born again again praise God
[1:37:05] amen my the second revelation is over
[1:37:09] comers inherit all things as true sons
[1:37:12] of God they receive all the rewards of
[1:37:18] the previous seven Church ages having
[1:37:20] overcome all of Satan's temptations and
[1:37:22] sins which includes unbelief abomination
[1:37:25] murder sorcery idolatry lying and all
[1:37:27] those other defilements list in the
[1:37:29] chapter anyone guilty of not repenting
[1:37:32] will participate in the second death but
[1:37:35] see what's different the Bible said the
[1:37:37] overcomers made their calling and
[1:37:39] election sure they were so determined to
[1:37:43] prove to hate fruit prove to God to
[1:37:47] prove to Christ and the angels and other
[1:37:49] family members they were so determined
[1:37:51] to be an overcomer they proved it to
[1:37:53] everybody praise God that's one thing
[1:37:56] church and I hope you know what I'm
[1:38:01] talking about when you're all alone in
[1:38:03] your private life where you are in your
[1:38:05] home or your job you should always feel
[1:38:08] like someone's watching you because God
[1:38:10] is watching you the angels are watching
[1:38:13] to you and you should have the feeling I
[1:38:16] need to prove that I am what I say I am

[1:38:22] desire to prove yourself because this is
[1:38:24] a tailless praise God
[1:38:26] whenever you're low whenever your own

[1:41:47] population of the earth God will have
[1:41:49] different degrees of rewards given to
[1:41:51] those who inherit eternal life based
[1:41:52] upon the works and faith they expressed
[1:41:54] during their earthly lives before Christ
[1:41:57] can coming according to Luke 16 10 to 12
[1:42:01] first corinthians 3 8 to 5 speaking of
[1:42:03] rewards in matthew 25 20 to 30 these
[1:42:06] Kings will bring the glory in honor of
[1:42:08] their own nations into the New Jerusalem
[1:42:13] the gates will never be shut the last
[1:42:15] one here the gates will never be shut
[1:42:19] according to verse 25 city gates usually
[1:42:22] symbolize security and access so we
[1:42:25] learned that the New Jerusalem will have
[1:42:26] an abundant entrance to all a Peter said
[1:42:28] if you have the stats riverman he said
[1:42:31] and a abundant entrance will be made
[1:42:33] known unto you or we give it unto you
