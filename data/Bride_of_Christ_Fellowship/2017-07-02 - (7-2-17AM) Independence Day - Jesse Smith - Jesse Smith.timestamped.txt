[41:05] wrath of God and I saw as it were a sea
[41:09] of glass mingled with fire and then that

[43:59] stop me here this morning Independence
[44:01] Day leads to victory date tonight at 4

[44:05] series I think the chapter 11 on
[44:07] Wednesday night and won't really even
[44:08] finished Chapter 12 Daniel nice to
[44:11] finish that book by God's grace this
[44:13] series book that got his name playing
[44:15] remember that book was to be sealed up
[44:17] until the end time amen and brother have
[44:20] said it's the mysteries that God
[44:21] finished would be the mists the seventh
[44:23] angel to finish all the mystery of God
[44:25] so we're grateful that the mysteries are
[44:27] finished amen so let's look at this talk
[44:30] here you know I kind of got my
[44:30] inspiration for this last year and my
[44:34] family went to Virginia you probably
[44:36] know when I got back I said all I'm
[44:37] going to preach a message on the
[44:38] American Revolution I remember saying
[44:40] that here and never did I forgot about
[44:43] it but when we passed the Lord over is
[44:46] back today I thought yeah I think every
[44:49] time I to your church age or something
[44:51] and then we had Monday that will know
[44:53] the Alpha know we're gonna get a chance
[44:56] to pudding parade or anything like that
[44:57] but watch some videos and watch some
[45:00] soldiers give their speeches and I'm
[45:01] just crying and thanking the Lord for
[45:03] all the you know the sacrifice that men
[45:06] and women have made you know over the
[45:08] years for our freedom and then I thought
[45:10] I come into July 4th weekend I that
[45:12] slaughter
[45:12] preach a message on something about
[45:14] American history so I'm gonna try to do
[45:16] a little bit of that today by God's
[45:18] grace that's kind of I got my
[45:19] inspiration from I'm touching on a few
[45:22] things you know back from the American
[45:24] Revolution that I learned you know when
[45:25] we were over there I'm Virginia
[45:28] Williamsburg there Yorktown it was
[45:31] really quite wonderful cargo quite a
[45:33] refreshing vacation I recommend that
[45:35] anybody want to go on a good vacation
[45:37] go there go to Yorktown go to Jamestown
[45:40] you'll have a fantastic time and if
[45:43] you're if you're spiritual you see God's
[45:45] hand and everything so I want to you
[45:52] know as I said I want to tie in you know
[45:54] Victory Day with Independence Day by the
[45:58] grace of Lord we don't know you know
[45:59] Tuesday's Independence Day the fourth of
[46:01] July and it's up it's a memorial
[46:05] remembering of when our country's
[46:07] leaders signed the Declaration of
[46:10] Independence in 1776 they had to write
[46:15] up this big long document they actually
[46:17] approved it on July 2nd but they want to
[46:19] edit it one more day on July 3rd and
[46:21] then they all signed it on July 4th they
[46:23] even put it enough it's looking like
[46:25] about two more weeks to put in a
[46:26] beautiful draft the parchment you know
[46:28] and that that's what we see today you
[46:29] know when we see pictures of that
[46:32] Washington DC and so forth it's such an
[46:35] important document and know we'll be
[46:38] celebrating that and you know the
[46:39] sacredness of that day has really left
[46:41] Americans because it used to be such a
[46:44] great day they bring the Liberty Bell
[46:46] dings they find any bells that ring the
[46:47] bells
[46:48] they'd have political speech it's kind
[46:49] of out my Memorial Day or Veterans Day
[46:51] today you know where people are if you
[46:55] can you're supposed to gather for
[46:56] parades and speeches and out of the
[46:59] fallen right and honor those who have
[47:01] served be be thankful give thanks write
[47:03] unto God for what he's done but
[47:05] America's really lost touch with July
[47:07] 4th you know because there they they
[47:11] forgotten all that they this country was
[47:15] under and I was looking I'm just
[47:16] standing over the document last night
[47:18] briefly I did get a chance to read all
[47:20] of it but they listed there's how like
[47:22] Martin Luther they listed all of their
[47:25] grievances against the king you know it
[47:26] all the evils you've done the taxation
[47:28] without representation and he'd been
[47:32] killed many colonists you know from
[47:34] America that would say anything against
[47:37] him and he got a lot of awful things and
[47:39] of course you know about the Tea Party
[47:40] and Paul Revere's ride things like that
[47:43] but but they finally got fed up with it
[47:45] and and they had to decide on we gonna
[47:47] fight and become independent are we
[47:51] gonna remain under a man's hand we're
[47:54] here remaining out there a tyrants rule
[47:56] I thought I would have put a very tight
[47:58] to the church jadynn ahead what a great
[48:00] tied to the bride of Jesus Christ and
[48:02] and I believe it's you know a very good
[48:05] tight so you know what I did is I went
[48:09] back and looked at a little bit of my my
[48:11] notes from vacation last year and so you
[48:15] know in July of 1776 it was signed the
[48:19] Declaration was signed and wasn't long
[48:23] after that that the battle started and I
[48:27] just did a little reading on George
[48:28] Washington now he's a pretty good man
[48:30] the programs there's a lot of there's a
[48:32] lot of lies about him like they're not
[48:34] they thought he never told a lot that
[48:36] said now you know that no one's ever
[48:38] been perfect only christ chopped down
[48:42] the cherry between all these things but
[48:43] i was reading you know britannica last
[48:44] night and he was a pretty good fella
[48:46] he's pretty faithful right before you
[48:51] know before he was a general president
[48:52] and before the revolution
[48:54] he was a great plantation owner and a
[48:56] surveyor and did some different jobs and
[48:58] and the resize takes a pretty good fella
[49:00] was because one time that they kept
[49:04] track of how many times he went to
[49:05] church in here he went sixteen times
[49:07] only my sixteen times the church in
[49:08] london and he smoked tobacco and did all
[49:11] kinds of things so he's a pretty good
[49:13] fella remember they were under the age
[49:16] of the mayonnaise right they weren't
[49:18] under the age and we're under the flying
[49:19] eagle so he's a pretty pretty good man
[49:22] and very honest very hard-working he
[49:24] treated as slaves well he actually went
[49:25] abolish slavery but couldn't do that
[49:29] later you know Abraham Lincoln but he
[49:31] treated his slave just as well as anyone
[49:34] anyone else
[49:36] he was a very just man but you know
[49:39] laughter and then he was even a military
[49:42] leader for the whole state of Virginia
[49:44] we know that this is even before the
[49:46] Revolution he had such faithfulness
[49:49] about he was so faithful but the people
[49:52] Virginia looked up and said my this guy
[49:54] he needs to be our leader and he was the
[49:57] general you know but then I've heard of
[50:00] that he retired and went back to his
[50:01] plantation and then this started moving
[50:03] up about you know freedom and
[50:05] independence and an America be not from
[50:07] under Great Britain and everything like
[50:09] that and so he started to cut attended
[50:12] the meetings and he didn't say a whole
[50:14] lot he just attended and all these
[50:16] things and pretty soon he became people
[50:18] would ask him things and pretty soon he
[50:19] became a very influential person and he
[50:23] was one of the signers of course we know
[50:25] of the original Declaration of
[50:26] Independence and because of his because
[50:32] of his character the people looked at
[50:34] him and said we want him to be leader
[50:36] and the general of the whole army and so
[50:38] he was and he started off with the few
[50:41] good victories once the revolution
[50:43] started the most famous that you know
[50:46] was December of 1776 when he crossed the
[50:49] Delaware remember that so from July some
[50:53] book sometime between July December 10th
[50:55] I'm looking up and they start to the war
[50:56] and Italy victories but then they start
[50:58] falling on hard times and if you go and
[51:01] study that for what I've read from that
[51:02] night it had gotten really bad for the
[51:05] colonists they thought they were going
[51:06] to lose you know they thought they were
[51:08] going to lose because they hadn't had a
[51:10] victory in a few months or something
[51:12] like that it was pretty a pretty sad
[51:14] situation so George's mother had said
[51:16] the history says that he prayed and then
[51:19] did a surprise attack on Great Britain
[51:22] soldiers on Christmas night when he knew
[51:25] they might be drinking they knew may not
[51:26] be no Christmas night they might be
[51:28] drinking and having their frolicking and
[51:30] it was a very successful trip they're
[51:32] very successful and actually gave New
[51:34] Hope accorded this one this Bacchus I
[51:37] found there in the Jamestown this attack
[51:41] the stunning victory at Trenton New
[51:43] Jersey across to the Delaware on
[51:45] Christmas night the New Hope to the
[51:47] Patriot cause
[51:49] my what up what an example there of a
[51:53] leader who's got to be led of the Holy
[51:54] Spirit how many want to be led of the
[51:56] Holy Spirit you had to be led at a time
[51:59] when it looked like it was going to just
[52:01] fall apart how could how could an
[52:03] untrained army of just militia man what
[52:07] you talking thirteen counties man this
[52:08] is a very organized the government even
[52:11] its own government you know how could a
[52:14] bunch of mission of militiamen without
[52:16] any real training to beat the greatest
[52:18] army in the world
[52:19] amen but if God's behind you all things
[52:23] are possible amen remind me of like you
[52:25] know of Moses or something like that he
[52:27] just brought the people you started lead
[52:29] the people out so watch the Cubs victory
[52:31] and and they kept going and then you
[52:38] remember the winter of 1777 and 1776 it
[52:42] was when it washed had moved his army
[52:44] into Valley Forge in Pennsylvania I
[52:47] remember that they had severe weather
[52:49] and shortages of food and and terrible
[52:52] hardships for the soldiers and it was
[52:55] just a loser probably one of the lowest
[52:56] times of the war but they have it'll
[52:58] hope and if you know the story you know
[53:02] pretty soon the account has got some
[53:05] help from Lafayette and remember
[53:07] Lafayette he's a very famous man
[53:09] generally young generally come over
[53:10] across the sea and yeah he was around
[53:13] well traded military he helped bring
[53:15] training to the military he taught of
[53:17] all their ranks and biting and and got
[53:19] them really organized and training and
[53:22] after that the French even though there
[53:24] was a more French armies that came over
[53:26] and it was such a glorious thing to see
[53:30] that that when God's people and when
[53:32] they fight for their fighting for
[53:34] liberty don't you appreciate people that
[53:36] will fight for liberty and God has
[53:38] blessed our country in such a church you
[53:40] can see the effects of all they fought
[53:42] for you can see the next summer right
[53:44] now in the very Declaration of
[53:47] Independence it talks about how every
[53:49] man has the right I've got the god-given
[53:51] rights you know to pursue you know
[53:53] happiness and love and all those things
[53:55] but then and now it's God then they said
[53:58] we must work according to God's law the
[54:01] church was very ugly
[54:03] me I stood there Jamestown I stood in
[54:06] the very church that many of those men
[54:08] fasted and prayed they took a day of
[54:10] prayer fasting before actually heading
[54:12] into the war no Jamaat even before July
[54:14] 4th I stood there without my I shouldn't
[54:16] I stood in the home or George Washington
[54:18] state for a while there in Virginia and
[54:20] to see the table that he worked on they
[54:22] had his clothes and there were things
[54:24] like that by it was quite striking and
[54:27] then later on went to Yorktown
[54:28] I walked at the very fields that George
[54:31] Washington locked up we looked at the
[54:34] very Garrison's though you know where
[54:37] they built reconstructions of the
[54:39] Garrison's of the Britain soldiers and
[54:41] they had though they still had bombs
[54:44] from the trenches that the soldiers had
[54:47] built had done rather they still the
[54:49] very trenches and George Washington and
[54:52] his men had fought and they men to bring
[54:55] us freedom praise God the own the idea
[54:58] behind that was just independent I don't
[55:01] want to be ruled by man by some other
[55:03] man we want to rule ourselves by our own
[55:05] leadership and other others by our own
[55:07] leading and I think that's a great time
[55:09] for the church we don't want to be led
[55:11] by headquarters on earth he wouldn't be
[55:13] led by the headquarters of haman haman
[55:15] every church is soldered of it south
[55:17] praise the Lord and must follow the
[55:19] leading of the Holy Spirit and I was
[55:23] listening to last night we went out to
[55:25] my troops might turn up it's a little
[55:27] pizza place and there was a Jehovah's
[55:29] Witness person there they were saying
[55:31] how they were saying how the job is when
[55:33] the church has to be the true church
[55:35] because every Church they have preaches
[55:38] the same sermon every single time and
[55:39] they said that's a proof of the unit
[55:41] team can I get to say anything that wish
[55:43] that could happen but just because a
[55:45] group by man its headquarters and
[55:48] leadership can all preach the same thing
[55:49] that doesn't mean it's the call of God
[55:51] that can be the work of man look at any
[55:54] company Chevrolet or a polar or
[55:57] Microsoft they all can have the same
[55:59] words and the same bylaws are the same
[56:03] reasons of everything like that and he
[56:06] may imagine set that up but it would
[56:08] really be God if God could speak the
[56:11] same
[56:12] unity to all churches but from all
[56:15] different angles from all the different
[56:16] bible scriptures getting his bride ready
[56:18] that would be a real move of God amen
[56:21] and that's what we have in this hour we
[56:23] have that by God's grace the same Holy
[56:25] Spirit is preaching in Africa or Rhode
[56:29] Island or you know Mexico the same
[56:32] gothis preaching there is preaching an
[56:34] acronym and is preaching to us God's
[56:36] Word and it's preparing God's people for
[56:39] a second coming amen
[56:41] that's exactly right now what uh just
[56:47] for a moment before I get to the ending
[56:49] of the American Revolution I want to go
[56:51] back over Victory Day a little bit by
[56:54] God's grace okay joy make three Dan
[56:56] listen to that wow I don't think I've
[56:57] ever preached on Victory Day I'm not
[56:59] mistaken but brother branham preaches
[57:01] and we said that April fourth or 21st 63
[57:04] he preached it in a brother's house they
[57:06] brother Isaacson or she's gonna think
[57:08] about it you did okay well my same thing
[57:11] Robin he's real good at coming and
[57:13] corrected me after discouragements and I
[57:15] first think that because I don't
[57:16] understand everything I don't have all
[57:18] the background knowledge but it's
[57:20] brother Isaacson's house in Sierra Vista
[57:22] Arizona I've never been there
[57:24] I imagine the wrongs that they met
[57:26] brother hammer said he liked these
[57:28] little house meetings because it
[57:30] reminded him of the apostatize what the
[57:32] Bible said they went from house to house
[57:34] preaching God's Word and they were
[57:37] sending brother Brandon Oh tidings cuz
[57:39] he said I have received your tie these
[57:40] and he said there are treasures to me
[57:43] that's interesting a pastor and there
[57:45] was passing them receiving the ties to
[57:47] the people and setting them to brother
[57:48] Brandon that's interesting I don't know
[57:51] if the brother was preaching or not or
[57:52] just plain tapes I couldn't hear on the
[57:54] tape one way or the other but then he
[57:57] opens up with revelation 15 as you read
[57:59] our text he talks about those who've got
[58:01] the victory and he said they just got
[58:04] victory over the Beast and now they're
[58:06] singing the praises he said brother
[58:09] Graham said the first thing he does is
[58:10] bring our thoughts back to war when we
[58:14] think of BJ he said because we just
[58:18] recently came across the beating that he
[58:20] was speaking of the v-day from May 8
[58:23] 1945
[58:25] the v-j here was was actually a holiday
[58:28] on May 8 1945 it took place in Great
[58:32] Britain in the United States and it's
[58:34] celebrated victory the victory in Europe
[58:36] today when they got victory over Germany
[58:39] cities of both nations in both US and
[58:42] Great Britain as well as former occupied
[58:45] cities of Western Europe put out flags
[58:47] and banners and rejoice in the defeat of
[58:49] the Nazi war machine so managed oh this
[58:52] is the 96th I was 20 years later he
[58:55] references you know we just got out of a
[58:56] bday and when we think of victories that
[58:59] we think of war and brother branham's
[59:02] first example that he brings up a war is
[59:05] Cain and Abel he said in jealousy was
[59:09] the reason for the first bloodshed of
[59:12] that this is striking what the holy
[59:13] spirit would precess to the Hoffs church
[59:15] jealousies the first thing he brings up
[59:17] war and then jealousy and he said of
[59:20] course Cain was jealous becomes a God
[59:22] accepted Abel's revelation and not his
[59:25] he said both tried to find favor both
[59:28] were trying to find life but he said God
[59:33] only accepts one way God only a sex
[59:37] accepts the innocent blood as an
[59:40] atonement everybody have said no matter
[59:43] how small the groove God will come on
[59:46] the basis of Christ and his shed blood
[59:49] aren't you glad this morning if God came
[59:51] down the house group there and Sara
[59:53] Vista Arizona because of the chef-owner
[59:56] Christ how much more can he come to us
[59:58] amen
[59:58] if we're coming by the shed blood so
[1:00:02] what do we what's the reason what's our
[1:00:04] justification will probably think we
[1:00:06] could receive anything from God today is
[1:00:08] it because of what we've done if it is
[1:00:10] you won't get anything but if it's
[1:00:12] because of what God has done for us and
[1:00:14] trusting and what he's given to us and
[1:00:16] thanking him for what he's given us then
[1:00:18] we can expect something from God this
[1:00:20] morning it's exactly right amen
[1:00:26] when I read this quote here he said what
[1:00:30] the trouble is and he's comparing mr.
[1:00:31] Cain and Abel he said the trouble is God
[1:00:35] invites manna to look at his provided
[1:00:38] way
[1:00:38] but man wants to show himself so his own
[1:00:41] way its own idea about it so that's the
[1:00:46] idea of Cain and Abel Kane was looking
[1:00:47] at it I want to see salvation in my way
[1:00:50] I was cited the direct commands of God
[1:00:52] but Abel was looking at I want to obey
[1:00:55] God directly by his command by the
[1:00:57] revelation that he gave me by the word
[1:00:59] that he gave me which is interesting go
[1:01:02] down tells the story of how he lifts it
[1:01:04] up binoculars in soft heart and
[1:01:05] antelopes but he said he had to focus
[1:01:08] them and then he finally saw one and he
[1:01:11] said that's what we've got to do
[1:01:13] he said we got to focus our binoculars
[1:01:16] he said the word of the binoculars amen
[1:01:20] he said if your binoculars of the word
[1:01:23] show three persons he said you got to
[1:01:25] focus those binoculars again there we go
[1:01:29] he said what they fail to get the glass
[1:01:32] in focus God wants them to see one thing
[1:01:36] and that's the innocent blood that was
[1:01:39] shed for their sins
[1:01:40] we don't need organization he said we
[1:01:43] don't need any he said that only does
[1:01:44] damage we only need to look at one thing
[1:01:47] that's our substitute and the substitute
[1:01:50] is Jesus Christ I mean look at Jesus
[1:01:51] Christ this morning for healing for
[1:01:54] revelation for grace for faith for
[1:01:56] forgiveness you only need to look at one
[1:01:59] thing this day and that's the substitute
[1:02:01] that's Jesus Christ
[1:02:03] Alleluia program said God made one way
[1:02:07] because he was all human beings of all
[1:02:10] colors all ages to try to focus on one
[1:02:14] thing that's his word he said God became
[1:02:18] a man in order to take away sin that's
[1:02:21] that behold the lamb of God who took
[1:02:23] away all the sins of the world on the
[1:02:25] video and then program tells a story of
[1:02:29] a young married woman he'd meant that
[1:02:32] God gave her a victory over mental
[1:02:34] breakdown he said she lost her focus she
[1:02:37] was married to young man the man said he
[1:02:39] loved her but then he ran away with
[1:02:41] another woman who got married again
[1:02:42] she's in the she's a preacher's daughter
[1:02:44] and my mam said she was lost in a world
[1:02:48] so in other words she has a mental break
[1:02:50] now I know he loves
[1:02:51] there's no way he could let me he'll
[1:02:52] come back put them back I brought a man
[1:02:54] she just said she stayed in that world
[1:02:56] of her own in a mental breakdown for a
[1:02:59] long time until the vision came and
[1:03:02] brother Graham told her something that
[1:03:03] that she knew he could know and that let
[1:03:06] her know that God's presence was there
[1:03:08] and that she shouldn't trust in the lie
[1:03:10] that she was trusting in programs that
[1:03:13] she lost her focus on Calvary how many
[1:03:16] to focus on Calvary every day then every
[1:03:19] day indeed it praise God
[1:03:22] he said she was living in another world
[1:03:24] but she had to get refocused on Calvary
[1:03:29] in other words though he said that she
[1:03:31] should have live in a stupe condition
[1:03:33] she'll is living on lost her mind
[1:03:36] condition a mental breakdown condition
[1:03:39] there's no or whatever condition you may
[1:03:41] find yourself you may there's hope for
[1:03:42] him whatever condition your family may
[1:03:44] find themselves in there's hope in the
[1:03:46] cross of Jesus Christ
[1:03:48] hallelujah the program said see Cain was
[1:03:53] using his natural mind rather than a
[1:03:55] spiritual mind he wanted to see his own
[1:03:59] way rather than God's Way incentive
[1:04:05] program said Kings should have said this
[1:04:06] he should have said oh my brother Abel
[1:04:09] I'm so happy that God has accepted your
[1:04:12] sacrifice and now we've got away the
[1:04:16] Jehovah accepts this way because he's
[1:04:18] provided it by receiving your sacrifice
[1:04:21] wouldn't that have been the thing to do
[1:04:23] I think it's amen to that
[1:04:25] see it was jealousy that caused that
[1:04:28] first warn everybody see that let's talk
[1:04:30] about getting a victory it gives all
[1:04:32] these examples jealousy had caused him
[1:04:35] and Cain's you to look and said my even
[1:04:38] though my sacrifice now even though God
[1:04:40] didn't answer my prayer there are some
[1:04:42] people whose prayer God does answer and
[1:04:45] I need to change my worship I need to
[1:04:47] follow that way Lauren that would have
[1:04:50] been the right thing to do I'm innocent
[1:04:52] but instead he lived from the natural
[1:04:54] mind live he got jealous of Abel he said
[1:04:59] instead of coming and saying well
[1:05:01] wonderfully she got him it's the people
[1:05:04] let's do that
[1:05:04] sir we said he got jealousy the same
[1:05:09] thing as Cain God and then he utter then
[1:05:13] Cain took the blood of his brother Abel
[1:05:16] he said that's what starts the trouble
[1:05:18] that's where the trouble begins that's
[1:05:19] where the broken vows begin where the
[1:05:22] broken fellowship separates that's the
[1:05:24] thing that breaks up homes that's the
[1:05:26] thing that breaks up the wheel moving
[1:05:27] towards the first arch that we are
[1:05:29] moving towards divorces that's the very
[1:05:31] thing that breaks the fellowship so see
[1:05:35] instead of getting happy for somebody
[1:05:37] instead of rejoicing with God moving
[1:05:39] someone will get jealous or someone will
[1:05:41] get upset or someone will get some of
[1:05:43] their own spirit right and in a creates
[1:05:46] a war it grates divisions how many want
[1:05:49] a unified body in our church amen
[1:05:51] how many want to see the Bride of Christ
[1:05:52] unified around the world they met we I
[1:05:55] do so what must we do we must love a man
[1:05:59] we must not let anything get in between
[1:06:02] each other by the grace of the Lord
[1:06:04] the next example brother Graham game was
[1:06:07] Eve her fellowship with Adam and God was
[1:06:09] broken because she believed well there's
[1:06:11] two ways it's okay
[1:06:13] there's two ways to do this by medicine
[1:06:14] two ideas one was the lie the serpent
[1:06:17] and then the other one was God's plain
[1:06:19] word through Adam program so that's why
[1:06:22] God is not allowed women preachers and
[1:06:24] he had to Craig mother had to Craig
[1:06:25] Joseph and Rebecca and Sarah at the
[1:06:27] table they thought there was women
[1:06:28] angels mymadison no there's no such a
[1:06:30] thing as women angels God doesn't make
[1:06:32] the woman a messenger a leader of with
[1:06:35] the word not only makes a man a leader
[1:06:37] with the word that's right mother Graham
[1:06:42] said I know I know women that can preach
[1:06:44] like lightning far out preach a man but
[1:06:47] that's not the righteous thing to do he
[1:06:48] says Oh glory and then he goes into how
[1:06:55] this spirit of jealousy breaks up the
[1:06:58] fellowship of homes churches nations and
[1:07:01] then program goes in the national
[1:07:02] spirits Germany has a military spirit
[1:07:05] America has a product hahaha spirit he
[1:07:09] said France has an immoral sphere women
[1:07:11] wine liquor Finland has a loyal sphere
[1:07:14] and honest
[1:07:14] spirit and he said that causes warranted
[1:07:18] hey spirits will get upset with each
[1:07:20] other spirits on this person spirits on
[1:07:22] that person but man said even dogs
[1:07:24] he used sled dogs can get spirits on
[1:07:27] them and then off to separate the sled
[1:07:29] dogs in order because they'll kill each
[1:07:30] other because demons get on there but
[1:07:33] Emerson where'd this come from he said I
[1:07:35] come from Genesis the seed chapter
[1:07:37] because Cain did not love his brother
[1:07:40] and then program gets into nations have
[1:07:43] Wars than alliances than a few
[1:07:45] generations later they're back up at war
[1:07:48] again instead of being friends he said
[1:07:50] we need one Brotherhood and then program
[1:07:54] goes in the world war one that he could
[1:07:56] recounts world war one I know my son
[1:08:01] knows a lot more about World War one
[1:08:02] than I am so I'm not gonna say much
[1:08:04] about World War one just cool me on it
[1:08:07] but but Adam talks about when he was
[1:08:10] five years old
[1:08:12] World War one started he said and he
[1:08:14] thought his dad might have to go and he
[1:08:16] was he's going to try to defend his dad
[1:08:17] and keep his dad from going but a few
[1:08:20] years later he said they won the war and
[1:08:21] then they made a League of Nations and I
[1:08:23] thought that that piece for them pretty
[1:08:25] soon World War two started another back
[1:08:29] fighting again with bigger bottoms
[1:08:30] bigger planes more bloodshed and then
[1:08:35] program tells us where he got the
[1:08:36] inspiration for this sermon he said it's
[1:08:38] d-day Victory Day that was the day the
[1:08:41] armies took victory over the UH the
[1:08:43] enemies he said d-day is when they went
[1:08:48] in to fight but v-day is when a peace
[1:08:51] treaty was signed I mean know the
[1:08:53] difference d-day was when all the Allies
[1:08:56] that World War two stormed the beaches
[1:08:58] of Normandy France because the Germans
[1:09:01] had taken over that right now the
[1:09:03] Germans had taken over Normandy France
[1:09:05] pretty close right and so Eisenhower got
[1:09:11] his troops in different countries got
[1:09:12] their troops and they stormed the
[1:09:14] beaches of Normandy d-day we saw
[1:09:16] reenactment of it up in Pennsylvania
[1:09:17] remember that Milka
[1:09:18] we saw reenact a couple years ago that
[1:09:20] was really nice to see that really
[1:09:22] inspiring that was d-day and it wasn't
[1:09:27] long after that they got the victory and
[1:09:28] push back the Germans
[1:09:32] now d-day was June 6 1944 just past the
[1:09:35] anniversary of I remember seen on
[1:09:36] Facebook and everything but then the
[1:09:39] next year at Mayday was when that the
[1:09:40] v-day and v-day was again the day that
[1:09:43] they finally got victory and then the
[1:09:45] nations have agreed to stop fighting
[1:09:47] that's why remember I've got the
[1:09:48] inspiration for this sermon Victory Day
[1:09:53] the man said they blew the whistles when
[1:09:56] they had v-day they throw their hats in
[1:09:58] the air they shot guns in the air
[1:10:00] they beat the drums like the music they
[1:10:03] beat one of it on the back why because
[1:10:05] we won victory victory we won and it was
[1:10:09] a great thing it brought peace to the
[1:10:11] Christian nation so-called and we had a
[1:10:13] little time of breathing he said but now
[1:10:18] he goes into some other Wars now but now
[1:10:22] we're going to mix the transition from
[1:10:24] those natural wars into spiritual wars
[1:10:26] or we say Bible warns amen so now that
[1:10:29] he shares his inspiration for the
[1:10:32] natural Wars and then he goes back to
[1:10:35] the Bible wars praise God how many
[1:10:38] believe God's people have many great V
[1:10:40] days many great days where they can
[1:10:42] stand there and say this is the day I've
[1:10:44] overcome this is the day I've overcome
[1:10:46] Satan I've had a few day lately if you
[1:10:49] do you want a shout out or you want to
[1:10:51] praise or you want to weep tears of joy
[1:10:53] I don't know what I'm talking about Amen
[1:10:54] but you get the real bead that you get a
[1:10:56] real victory praise God
[1:10:58] something you battle for so low for so
[1:11:00] many years or so many folks are so hard
[1:11:02] and you finally get the v-day amen
[1:11:05] what a victory it is hallelujah that's
[1:11:08] what we're talking about now because
[1:11:10] remember there's gotta first be a
[1:11:12] declaration of independence first you
[1:11:14] got to declare your independent of these
[1:11:15] things but then you got to fight until
[1:11:17] you get the v-day praise God
[1:11:20] my dad said we fight every day every
[1:11:24] Christian fights a battle every day
[1:11:26] we're in a warfare right now going on
[1:11:29] constantly within us so not only do you
[1:11:31] have sometimes Wars out here with
[1:11:32] spirits but you've got a word side of
[1:11:35] you between right and wrong shall we
[1:11:38] receive it what shall we do shall we bow
[1:11:40] to the world shall we give up this
[1:11:42] thought that we got
[1:11:45] everybody man up said if we see it focus
[1:11:49] it take it from Genesis to Revelation
[1:11:53] she does Gus said the Lord each time
[1:11:56] right down through there we can't give
[1:11:58] it up we can't compromise with the rest
[1:12:00] of them we just can't do it we've got to
[1:12:03] stay here that's all now no matter how
[1:12:05] great the enemy is and how much
[1:12:07] machineries got against us and how many
[1:12:09] organizations and how many this is that
[1:12:11] yeah we have to pull the focus of God's
[1:12:14] Word till we find them there's one thing
[1:12:17] and that's the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:12:19] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:12:22] forever
[1:12:23] so can you see that every day is a
[1:12:25] warfare for you and I we are battling at
[1:12:28] a Christian warfare and program said
[1:12:32] God's Heroes has always had warfare so
[1:12:37] we're basically in two battles and
[1:12:38] trials now and listen this brother of
[1:12:42] stops and he tells this little house
[1:12:44] Church in Sierra Vista this he says you
[1:12:47] little Church
[1:12:48] remember back here you are part of that
[1:12:51] unit in other words you're some of God's
[1:12:54] heroes did you know we got some of God's
[1:12:57] heroes in here of this party and then we
[1:12:59] raised their hands I want to God for us
[1:13:00] who's a hero who's a hero fighting for
[1:13:03] crisis party I am one of God's heroes
[1:13:07] race lilies and everybody racing ahead
[1:13:11] one of God's heroes I'm fighting for
[1:13:15] Christ
[1:13:16] we're not fighting for the world we're
[1:13:18] fighting for Jesus this morning amen we
[1:13:21] seem like a small outpost but ma'am said
[1:13:23] we're a little Church he said but you
[1:13:26] know what an outpost is you're an
[1:13:29] outcast back outpost back here you
[1:13:32] should be you should be by being some of
[1:13:35] it right here by you
[1:13:36] you're an outpost back here to keep up
[1:13:39] the banners to do what's right to still
[1:13:42] claim that Jesus Christ is the only hope
[1:13:45] of the world not the Methodist Baptist
[1:13:48] Presbyterian Catholic Jewish whatever
[1:13:50] may be races planted color outside it
[1:13:52] it's Jesus Christ he's the one he's our
[1:13:55] Victor he's the one he's the chief
[1:13:57] captain of the move this is his orders
[1:13:59] we've got to carry out the orders you
[1:14:02] said some of you boys served in the ward
[1:14:04] we have any veterans in here this one
[1:14:06] anybody ought to serve in here
[1:14:07] I don't think so I think he's in ok so
[1:14:10] we don't have any natural meds a lot of
[1:14:13] spiritual veterans in here though he
[1:14:15] said if the captain gives you an order
[1:14:17] that's right what happens out there in
[1:14:18] that land this morning we that was here
[1:14:20] we have a better and you turn around and
[1:14:24] do something backwards you'll mess the
[1:14:26] whole army up that's right you'll throw
[1:14:29] it into a riot you've got to carry out
[1:14:31] the orders the only way you can do it is
[1:14:33] see the purpose and see what it's all
[1:14:36] about amen glory you see God's purpose
[1:14:39] this morning is to help us encourage us
[1:14:42] to keep fighting keep waving the banners
[1:14:45] that Jesus Christ is still the only hope
[1:14:47] of the world I'm glad to be a part of
[1:14:49] this morning amen
[1:14:50] to wave the banner to do my part and say
[1:14:54] this is a small little church a small
[1:14:56] little outpost but we still believe
[1:14:58] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:15:00] and forever will be witnesses that will
[1:15:03] stand upon that because we love that we
[1:15:05] believe that amen glory now he says
[1:15:10] there's been many be days for believers
[1:15:14] he said there's coming a final B day he
[1:15:17] talks about the Battle of Armageddon
[1:15:18] amen of course we know there's one more
[1:15:21] battle for that we know it's gog and
[1:15:22] magog but he met Jesus mentions
[1:15:24] Armageddon so but that's still true it
[1:15:26] is a one of the final battles before the
[1:15:29] millennium and then he goes let's go
[1:15:32] some some examples of some warriors
[1:15:39] actually read this I'm gonna forget that
[1:15:41] he says that Moses was a a warrior he
[1:15:48] said but the church Israel and Egypt had
[1:15:51] long forgot the victory they were slaves
[1:15:55] so has the modern church today never
[1:15:59] feel like that sometimes you lose the
[1:16:00] victory not just be honest sometimes you
[1:16:02] never lose the victory but man so that's
[1:16:05] the condition Israel is in an Asian they
[1:16:07] lost the victim they forgot what does it
[1:16:09] mean to be victorious what does it mean
[1:16:10] to be
[1:16:11] free so God said to Moses and Manderson
[1:16:15] Moses was born for something he was born
[1:16:18] to deliver the people of God he said
[1:16:23] what happened to Moses on the backside
[1:16:25] of the desert he got his glasses focused
[1:16:27] god's only purpose was it to marry this
[1:16:30] beautiful Ethiopian girl and settle down
[1:16:33] and have children but his mission beyond
[1:16:36] that was to deliver the children of God
[1:16:38] out from under that bondage that was his
[1:16:40] commission that's what he was born for
[1:16:43] church how you know you're born for more
[1:16:45] than just the natural things you're more
[1:16:47] your borders are more than just you know
[1:16:49] coming to church or having a job or
[1:16:51] having a family we're born for more than
[1:16:53] that we've got to ask God say Lord what
[1:16:55] was I born for what looks like you how
[1:16:58] can I find what I was born for most
[1:17:00] didn't fight us he was 80 years old
[1:17:02] that's when he finally got his glasses
[1:17:04] fixed at the burning bush and church
[1:17:07] that won't fix our glasses it's the
[1:17:09] burning presence of Jesus Christ amen
[1:17:11] a burning bush being in God's presence
[1:17:15] but the power of God's presence will get
[1:17:18] our eyes focus on what our purpose is
[1:17:20] that might be men like that the matters
[1:17:25] that each one of us is born for
[1:17:26] something we wasn't just put on here on
[1:17:29] earth for nothing he said that mountain
[1:17:33] never happened out there just to be that
[1:17:36] tree was put there for a purpose
[1:17:37] everything is for a purpose it's got to
[1:17:40] serve and we are here for a purpose
[1:17:42] maybe it's the testified to one person
[1:17:46] and get them saved and out of that might
[1:17:51] come a preacher who sent a million souls
[1:17:53] to Christ he gave Lutie right we gave an
[1:17:55] example dry moody I never checked that
[1:17:58] as far as this testimony but it seems
[1:17:59] like it's a powerful tested one maybe to
[1:18:01] get to more of the details but I've said
[1:18:04] maybe your purpose is to win one soul
[1:18:06] how many have a desire to witness all to
[1:18:08] Christ yeah okay so maybe that's your
[1:18:11] purpose being out and just you know the
[1:18:13] regular things y'all she's going to work
[1:18:14] I should work hard as you love my family
[1:18:16] I need to start that's wonderful but my
[1:18:19] back said beyond that even winning one
[1:18:21] soul
[1:18:22] a great purpose for the kingdom of God
[1:18:24] remember there's levels of rewards
[1:18:26] there's levels of colleagues - right
[1:18:28] there's five talents three talents one
[1:18:30] talent there's a hundredfold reaping
[1:18:34] right there's a 60 fold in the 30 fold
[1:18:37] there's all these different levels all
[1:18:39] different kinds of ministries we must
[1:18:41] seek God and see what is the mother
[1:18:42] calling for my life I want to know what
[1:18:44] I was born to do amen
[1:18:46] look what he says next unless it is
[1:18:48] don't despise where God has got you the
[1:18:54] church said hey no no no despise where
[1:18:59] God has got cheese why did I say that
[1:19:00] because I have found that for a while
[1:19:03] Lord why my doctor I'd like to be back
[1:19:06] in line are like be with my brother
[1:19:07] cabin two-pointer father brother Craig
[1:19:11] you know we get this spies where God has
[1:19:15] placed us but he says serve your purpose
[1:19:19] there's coming a great victory day one
[1:19:22] of these days where the battle is going
[1:19:25] to be over and I think of our brother
[1:19:26] James brownie his battle is over this
[1:19:29] morning it's over again aneurism went
[1:19:34] home to be with the Lord and I'll never
[1:19:35] forget he was the very first live
[1:19:38] creature I ever heard preach the message
[1:19:40] and I walked in the church I'll never
[1:19:43] forget it they had the old technologies
[1:19:44] before projectors what was those old
[1:19:47] projectors called the overhead projector
[1:19:50] and he had a picture of that Life
[1:19:53] magazine
[1:19:54] from 1963 I just heard about the message
[1:19:58] a few days ago I think it was the first
[1:20:00] weekend of December 19th I'm sorry in
[1:20:03] 2001 yeah I think it was that right
[1:20:06] around there maybe was January I maybe
[1:20:07] went to the Duke I don't remember but it
[1:20:08] this is some time in winter and he had
[1:20:10] an aura trajector and he had that light
[1:20:12] magazine on a projector sheet and he
[1:20:14] said he's preached on the inside and
[1:20:16] inside was kinda like a standard it's
[1:20:18] kind of a banner a flag and he said from
[1:20:20] the believer today this cloud of the
[1:20:24] beard overrun around there he said this
[1:20:26] car is our enzyme today and I didn't
[1:20:29] know every what he was talking about
[1:20:30] well one thing I believe was any rich
[1:20:32] water baptism
[1:20:34] but I wasn't raising the message I think
[1:20:36] I know he breached the Godhead was the
[1:20:39] right way it's only one person I know he
[1:20:41] freaked serpent see that that's how
[1:20:43] that's why I God I had to send Christ by
[1:20:45] a virgin birth was because of how sin
[1:20:48] entered the world through sex act so God
[1:20:50] had to bypass that and sent Jesus as a
[1:20:52] new creation to start a new race people
[1:20:55] who'd be born again the Holy Ghost amen
[1:20:57] and I'll never forget that what a great
[1:21:01] example that brother James lived and
[1:21:04] before we started this church both
[1:21:06] Samuel mention again he was glad to hear
[1:21:07] last year in June I went down and saw
[1:21:10] James and Samuel and in April 2006 I sat
[1:21:14] across the table said tell me what if we
[1:21:17] start a church we're feeling left to
[1:21:18] start a church what is it going to be
[1:21:20] like I'll never forget he looked right
[1:21:21] across the table and he said don't
[1:21:23] expect anybody to be the church he said
[1:21:25] you're the church he said don't expect
[1:21:28] anybody else to labor he said you've got
[1:21:31] the labor if you want to church he said
[1:21:33] God needs laborers and God these workers
[1:21:36] at his vineyard and that has been
[1:21:38] nothing but the truth right because we'd
[1:21:43] all get tired you know we all good we
[1:21:45] all go through battles and things like
[1:21:46] that but what we found is that every
[1:21:49] ministry is a burden and to work you've
[1:21:53] got a you got a labor you've got a fully
[1:21:56] support you can't give up and then I'll
[1:21:59] never forget I think it was 2011 on
[1:22:01] Mother's Day the power went out their
[1:22:04] church and James and Samuel came to our
[1:22:07] service over borrow do not pretend about
[1:22:08] modern the groom and afterwards I asked
[1:22:11] her brother James you know you were
[1:22:12] getting older brother I said what would
[1:22:14] your advice be for a young man like me
[1:22:16] and you know you go to spice but his
[1:22:18] advice was I wish I would have exercise
[1:22:20] and take care of my body better I wanted
[1:22:22] to have all the hard trouble that I have
[1:22:23] now he said I could travel more for
[1:22:25] mission work dude that's why I have
[1:22:27] rafter that I started running again I'm
[1:22:29] on a treadmill like I'm not gonna get
[1:22:31] bad health I still exercise at this day
[1:22:34] and then I do Taekwondo twice a week it
[1:22:35] but those things too though that wisdom
[1:22:38] that Warriors have talked you we're
[1:22:42] supposed to hang on to that amen
[1:22:46] and so I remember that program said that
[1:22:51] Moses though had a little disappointment
[1:22:53] at first the people rejected him and
[1:22:55] then he talks about that what seemed
[1:22:56] like a disappointment at the Red Sea
[1:22:58] when he brought 2 million people out to
[1:23:00] the Red Sea and were they going to go
[1:23:03] there surrounded by the Egyptians and by
[1:23:06] them said felt like a disappointment to
[1:23:08] Moses you've done 10 plays you've got
[1:23:10] all these miracles and Here I am I got
[1:23:12] too many people and we're surrounded by
[1:23:13] Devils the man said it seems the
[1:23:18] Christian life if the fellows not
[1:23:21] absolutely centered on Christ the
[1:23:23] Christian seems like this life holds so
[1:23:26] many disappointments but those
[1:23:29] disappointments are God's divine will
[1:23:32] happening for us how many believe that
[1:23:35] your disappointments are things God has
[1:23:38] allowed in this perfect will now it
[1:23:41] don't seem like it would be that but
[1:23:43] it's God's way of doing things
[1:23:45] he lets us hit the river to see what
[1:23:49] we'll do about it if you remember
[1:23:52] standing the gap in 63 and that message
[1:23:54] my dad told I was complex he lost the
[1:23:56] feeling for the people remember that and
[1:23:58] he said I can't go on and preach i
[1:23:59] apprec and the more the more the women
[1:24:01] cut their hair the more they wear makeup
[1:24:03] the more men go to organizational invite
[1:24:05] me to their churches he said and he said
[1:24:08] his family if they won't listen to me
[1:24:10] I'll go could be a trap her and I will
[1:24:12] preach in March go be a trapper and
[1:24:13] we've got used to me in us at the Lord
[1:24:14] he set out Thunder off that mountain and
[1:24:16] I'll come bring the prop the message
[1:24:18] down and go back up to the mountain
[1:24:19] remember that message
[1:24:20] Santa yeah that's right and brother
[1:24:25] branham said he sent that message that
[1:24:27] God had to correct him and program said
[1:24:29] if you do that he said he'll be nothing
[1:24:31] more than a bum you'll turn into a bum
[1:24:33] he said your wife will leave you if you
[1:24:36] go on with your complex and won't have a
[1:24:38] feeling for the people and preach even
[1:24:41] though they reject you the Angels for
[1:24:43] telling it here to have a divorce oh
[1:24:45] you're gonna be separated for your wife
[1:24:46] if you don't do what the Word of God
[1:24:47] says remember so I thought it was the
[1:24:50] Old Testament prophet and the angel said
[1:24:52] here are New Testament prophet there's a
[1:24:54] great difference between Old Testament
[1:24:56] right his New Testament of the Bible
[1:24:58] ministry and they stay with the people
[1:25:01] the Old Testament prophet could leave
[1:25:02] out and come back and leave out but the
[1:25:05] New Testament prophet stays right with
[1:25:07] the church exactly right and then at the
[1:25:10] very end of the message pro medicine let
[1:25:12] it be remembered here from tonight he
[1:25:14] said I have no vision about what I have
[1:25:15] to do from here for he said but he said
[1:25:17] let it be known if God has to push a man
[1:25:20] through a pipe and tell him everything
[1:25:21] he has to do he said there's no face
[1:25:24] involved in it amen and then brother
[1:25:27] Kevin said that every decision every
[1:25:29] victory he's had to make the decision
[1:25:31] did you get that from his testimony God
[1:25:35] doesn't always tell us every decision to
[1:25:37] make but he allows tests and trials he
[1:25:39] makes the trial said now I'm gonna watch
[1:25:41] my son overcome this trial and I know
[1:25:43] they're gonna use the right thing
[1:25:45] through this but if they fail God said I
[1:25:48] know they'll get it right next time
[1:25:49] are you with me church I don't
[1:25:52] understand wherever we're looking at
[1:25:53] this that's the example he goes
[1:25:55] Christianity if you're not careful if
[1:25:57] you don't see God has handed everything
[1:25:59] even allow you to make mistakes if you
[1:26:01] get disappointed with life mother
[1:26:03] instead but you've got to look at
[1:26:04] everything through Calvary how is God
[1:26:07] using this is shaky how is this trial
[1:26:09] changed my life and then you can be
[1:26:11] centered on Calvary and see God's hand
[1:26:13] and all your life thing that the man
[1:26:17] said God brought Moses I'm trying to
[1:26:19] speed up there God brought Moses to this
[1:26:20] to bring into a pide to get him to cry
[1:26:23] out he's out the room is out the red
[1:26:25] seat he looks surrounded my man said it
[1:26:27] got brought there to cry out in the
[1:26:28] midst was try and God said why he cried
[1:26:33] to me he said I know I needed the
[1:26:34] Commission
[1:26:35] speak speak and go forward well Graham
[1:26:39] said what courage to tell a man with two
[1:26:43] million people speaking go for room he
[1:26:45] said what courage he said what a courage
[1:26:47] that we ought to be that ought to be for
[1:26:49] a sick person speak the word and go
[1:26:52] forward
[1:26:53] what it courage it ought to be for a
[1:26:55] backslider turn yourself around and
[1:26:57] start back stay in the line of duty it's
[1:26:59] God's business to open up the Red Sea
[1:27:02] that's God's business you just speak the
[1:27:04] word and move forward that's all you and
[1:27:06] I have to do
[1:27:07] hey you like that I got
[1:27:10] that's all we have to do speak God's
[1:27:12] Word and go forward it's God's business
[1:27:14] to open up the Red Sea I like that the
[1:27:18] next example is Joshua remember sure
[1:27:20] about Joshua he was the next hero faith
[1:27:25] he says God let disappointments happen
[1:27:28] to show victory if only we could see
[1:27:31] then you would only see that these
[1:27:35] things that seems to be so burden you
[1:27:37] and upsetting you they are trials there
[1:27:41] are things to stand still focus your
[1:27:43] glasses on the Word of God speak the
[1:27:45] word and then just walk forward do you
[1:27:49] like that by God's grace so every trial
[1:27:51] is a situation where God is bringing you
[1:27:54] to a position and you're supposed to
[1:27:56] refocus your eyes upon the Word of God
[1:27:59] in other words each situation draws you
[1:28:01] closer to Christ amen my man said I love
[1:28:09] Joshua when he came to the River Jordan
[1:28:10] he did the same thing Moses did he had
[1:28:13] to put the word first when he put the
[1:28:16] word first he crossed down he said there
[1:28:20] you are with the Commission from God put
[1:28:23] the word first and brought a bead a it's
[1:28:25] got to come that's all it isn't how
[1:28:29] you're going to get to your destination
[1:28:31] that's up to God just keep on moving and
[1:28:34] follow the word don't you like that amen
[1:28:38] so we can just make a blanket statement
[1:28:40] saying in the will of God
[1:28:42] finding the purpose for God for your
[1:28:45] life here is poem says in every trial
[1:28:48] put the word first whatever you know to
[1:28:52] be truth just do that to speak that just
[1:28:55] stay with that and then God will open
[1:28:57] everything up up to us Amen if not it
[1:29:00] will just seem like disappointments
[1:29:02] let's just seemed like a struggles but
[1:29:05] if we put the word first the word will
[1:29:07] move we've got the prophesy right John
[1:29:09] had the prophesy again is that right but
[1:29:12] the spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit
[1:29:14] of prophecy amen
[1:29:16] is that right so our live sometimes
[1:29:19] prophesied for ending the time of my
[1:29:21] life
[1:29:21] on the side of something okay I can't
[1:29:24] remember right now but I remember the
[1:29:25] windows of course of the children being
[1:29:27] boards of the mothers I couldn't action
[1:29:29] I remember that was prophetic
[1:29:31] that's very prophetic but our lives if
[1:29:34] the Spirit of God is in us it should
[1:29:36] prophesy of things to come that's
[1:29:38] exactly right we just put the word first
[1:29:43] Abraham is the third example in game
[1:29:45] another Victor didn't remember what
[1:29:50] mother ever said his bday was it was
[1:29:52] Mount Moriah when he took Isaac up to
[1:29:55] sacrifice him on Mount Moriah
[1:29:56] that was his v-day his bday wasn't when
[1:30:00] he had I see now that was a girl I was a
[1:30:02] great that might have a minor bday gonna
[1:30:04] have said this real feed day was when
[1:30:07] God had told him to go sacrifice and
[1:30:09] destroy the very thing he thought was
[1:30:11] the blessing of God the very thing he
[1:30:14] thought was going to be the album this
[1:30:16] is the Avenue
[1:30:17] so how God is going to fulfill the plan
[1:30:19] for my life he said this was his v-day I
[1:30:25] want to just read it
[1:30:28] he said program says that God raised up
[1:30:31] has raised us from the things of the
[1:30:33] world and crush you of the earth just
[1:30:35] like Abraham see we look at these little
[1:30:40] trials and we think there is something
[1:30:41] but they're nothing but just little
[1:30:44] testing times God tested Abraham but
[1:30:47] he's got this be day when he went up
[1:30:48] there and obedience to word the Word of
[1:30:51] God
[1:30:52] but remember said Abraham had his focus
[1:30:55] right because God said I'm going to make
[1:30:57] you of other nations
[1:30:59] he put his focus on what thus saith the
[1:31:02] Lord was and he walked straight with
[1:31:05] that what the said the Lord was day
[1:31:06] after day he walked year after year
[1:31:09] confessing anything contrary to that he
[1:31:12] said it had to be that way God said so
[1:31:14] church are we walking with us say the
[1:31:17] Lord today we ought to meet what the
[1:31:19] says nor do we have the bonus of
[1:31:21] Pentecost I'll be in the bride also the
[1:31:23] move is on the bride he's God we have
[1:31:27] those that say the Lord
[1:31:28] the move is on the bride in other words
[1:31:30] we can
[1:31:31] - as God moves us amen
[1:31:35] and what is he moving us to do Church
[1:31:38] he's moving us to win souls because
[1:31:39] we're trying to finish the Great
[1:31:40] Commission so how does that look that
[1:31:43] could look all we can set more money to
[1:31:45] missionaries we can do missionary
[1:31:46] working in Akron or Ohio we do
[1:31:49] missionary work other ways the
[1:31:52] leadership with the Holy Spirit today is
[1:31:54] trying to finish the Great Commission
[1:31:55] trying to inspire the bride to move and
[1:31:58] fulfill the Great Commission for this
[1:32:00] day amen so we can't say well Abraham as
[1:32:04] I said Lord Oviedo we have not saved the
[1:32:06] Lord Amen you know what the truth is we
[1:32:09] say God we have no say Lord the fullest
[1:32:11] of Pentecost must return Lord bring back
[1:32:14] Pentecost because the Raps was not going
[1:32:15] to happen until the fullness of
[1:32:17] Pentecost comes back to the bride and
[1:32:19] that's thus saith the Lord hey I'm happy
[1:32:21] to tell you that again I read a numerous
[1:32:23] times the last few months that's right
[1:32:25] and the move is on the bride so Lord
[1:32:28] move me
[1:32:29] so the fullness of Christ could be in me
[1:32:31] how many what the fullness of Christ and
[1:32:32] then that's what winter actually gonna
[1:32:35] come is what the fullness of Christ
[1:32:37] comes into the bride and she is a she
[1:32:41] goes back to the beginning back to what
[1:32:43] they had the beginning and how's that
[1:32:45] faith um faith cometh by hearing hearing
[1:32:48] gotta hear that gotta believe that gotta
[1:32:51] pray what and trust that and speak that
[1:32:53] and go forward right just like Moses
[1:32:55] just like Abraham speak that and go
[1:32:58] forward
[1:32:58] let us save the Lord Lord I'm speaking
[1:33:01] it now the move is on me and part of the
[1:33:04] pride the fullness of your spirit we
[1:33:06] must live through us Lord
[1:33:08] the move is on the I believe it I'm not
[1:33:10] letting anything get in the way
[1:33:11] I'm not letting anything unfocused or
[1:33:13] scratch my glasses
[1:33:14] I'm gonna keep my glasses clean I'm
[1:33:17] gonna keep my eyes focused right on the
[1:33:19] Word of God that's right did you know
[1:33:23] this church arteries can I just read uh
[1:33:25] Steve
[1:33:25] I think you like this I'm already out of
[1:33:27] our mercy I have like probably three
[1:33:31] hours of notes here
[1:33:32] I'm not giving able to be consistent I
[1:33:35] thought I could get through all of it
[1:33:39] did you know when brother Branham was
[1:33:41] going up when I'm sorry when Abraham was
[1:33:43] going up to offer Isaac
[1:33:45] brother Grantham said the same thing was
[1:33:48] happening in heaven that happened when
[1:33:50] Joel was tested brother man said the
[1:33:52] same thing happens in other words both
[1:33:55] programs said this is the paragraph 185
[1:33:57] and he believed abraham abraham believed
[1:34:00] God rather and God said no doubt God
[1:34:04] told Satan I could just prove to you
[1:34:07] that he loves me see that the same thing
[1:34:11] any but I'm just talking preaching about
[1:34:12] Jove at this point and then he breaks
[1:34:14] back into Abraham is Nick amen
[1:34:16] I like that amen so say you said they're
[1:34:20] saying well of course
[1:34:22] Abraham loves you you gave him a son
[1:34:26] here's no way if you asked him to give
[1:34:30] that son back there's no way he loved
[1:34:31] you he'd curse you to your face and die
[1:34:34] everybody says no doubt Satan look at
[1:34:37] God's that he doesn't love you program
[1:34:40] said then he said God said I can prove
[1:34:42] to you that he loves me devil I wonder
[1:34:44] if God would say about us this morning
[1:34:46] hey ed I can prove that brother cabin
[1:34:48] and brother a man I can prove it brother
[1:34:50] guess he loves me I'm gonna go through
[1:34:52] this but he'll still love me no matter
[1:34:54] what amen
[1:34:55] no matter what I'm asking the sacrifice
[1:34:57] or take away whatever I loud his life he
[1:35:00] loves me no doubt God I'm told saying
[1:35:06] that Abraham loves me I'll prove it I'll
[1:35:09] prove it to you
[1:35:10] I like that we got proof sings to the
[1:35:12] devil don't you huh back what he proves
[1:35:14] that believes by promise because I told
[1:35:19] him that he'd be a father of Nations I
[1:35:22] like when I see God preached in the
[1:35:24] state don't you like that I like to see
[1:35:27] God preached in tell the devil he's
[1:35:29] going to do this he loves me he does
[1:35:31] believe every word I say seems like all
[1:35:34] come on he don't it's just a head you
[1:35:36] just gotta hedge about him and God says
[1:35:38] watch you live you doesn't go to this
[1:35:40] watch since I was helping to go kill
[1:35:41] them and then he'll actually go get in a
[1:35:43] very active do it then I'll stop and he
[1:35:45] said yeah sure sure God sure there's a
[1:35:49] chance of that happened and God seen
[1:35:51] just watch
[1:35:52] he loves Nick but rather said so Abraham
[1:35:56] took his own son off the top of the
[1:35:58] mountain
[1:35:58] his hands behind him the day that God
[1:36:01] said so right we got his hands up there
[1:36:03] he said when he pulled the knife from
[1:36:05] from its scabbard
[1:36:07] he said he pulled his hair back out of
[1:36:09] his face to take the bike he said that
[1:36:11] was Abraham speed day oh my when he was
[1:36:14] tested to the very limit of his only son
[1:36:17] now if you're just spiritual take that
[1:36:20] to the test when God hid his own son on
[1:36:23] his own feed day she talks about Christ
[1:36:26] but he goes back to Abraham Abraham
[1:36:28] speed a was Mount Kyra when the Lord
[1:36:31] provided for him a sacrifice instead of
[1:36:33] the son loves he loved listen that day
[1:36:37] Abraham proved to God without a shadow
[1:36:40] of a doubt his loyalty
[1:36:43] amen Abraham proved to God his faith in
[1:36:47] him
[1:36:49] Rahab said I got this for when I was 100
[1:36:52] years old by believing a promise he told
[1:36:54] me I was a father nation and he asked me
[1:36:56] to take his life God is able to raise
[1:36:58] him up from the dead and on to make a
[1:37:00] Presbyterian shout hey he's proved to me
[1:37:07] already that he keeps his word has got
[1:37:10] proof to that he keeps his word church
[1:37:13] amen see your tests prove your love and
[1:37:18] loyalty to God well I'm going to love
[1:37:23] God with all their oil teens go through
[1:37:26] and program says that was his victim
[1:37:29] that was the day Abraham could shout and
[1:37:32] throw the hats at blow the trumpets this
[1:37:34] is my victory dad God approved to the
[1:37:37] devil that I love God and I'm willing to
[1:37:39] lose anything God take anything for my
[1:37:41] life as long as you know I love you I

[1:37:54] how that we got that was Abraham's real
[1:37:58] V day but man said the doubts had gone
[1:38:04] from Abraham when he was taking Isaac
[1:38:05] when he heard the real word doubts left
[1:38:07] when he seen God vindicate his word
[1:38:09] God's left love took its place that's
[1:38:11] what we need
[1:38:12] Daleks need to get their place take it
[1:38:14] my love
[1:38:15] so say Lord we can say that Lord let
[1:38:18] your love take the place of my doubts

[1:38:26] the doubts brother Graham said doubt
[1:38:27] your doubts right start doubting your
[1:38:29] mouth and but love in the place where
[1:38:31] the doubts used to me praise God yeah he
[1:38:34] said speak the word and go forward I
[1:38:36] know you love me Abraham you don't doubt
[1:38:39] me a bit no matter how long you have to
[1:38:40] wait you still believe me I asked you to
[1:38:42] destroy the very evidence I give to you
[1:38:44] and you love me so much you keep my word
[1:38:47] regardless that was a real v-day for
[1:38:50] God's people hey man let me try those we
[1:38:54] said the timing I'm trying to finish it
[1:38:57] by this time goes so fast I don't know
[1:39:00] man
[1:39:01] you gave the example of Jacob I'll just
[1:39:02] skip Jacob looking for time sake let me
[1:39:04] just give Jacob he talks about I got the
[1:39:06] heed a you wrestled the angel my men
[1:39:09] type size of the backs and wall he goes
[1:39:10] to church in to wrestle with a bat and
[1:39:12] Holy Ghost and to overcome the army of
[1:39:14] Esau right the army of organization he's
[1:39:17] the organizational man God hated Esau
[1:39:19] you know the spirit of Antichrist never
[1:39:23] remember call it his bday when he got
[1:39:25] Victor Dover brother Davis and all the
[1:39:27] ministers telling his missions were of
[1:39:28] the devil he got a you said he went out
[1:39:31] to his cave and the angel came at miss
[1:39:33] and said these are from Satan these are
[1:39:35] from me and you're gonna pray for kings
[1:39:37] and monarchs and all these things but
[1:39:39] Adam said that was a great day he said
[1:39:41] after praying all night in the cave so
[1:39:44] this is Jacob prayed into the night
[1:39:45] brother Brandon pray to the night it got
[1:39:47] a victory and we know who you really get
[1:39:49] sincere pray about something don't you
[1:39:50] having experienced it God answer your
[1:39:52] prayer if you get sincere enough about
[1:39:54] it that was one he day he recalled his
[1:39:57] life the program starts bring it to a
[1:40:00] close
[1:40:01] which I'll trying to do to my dad said
[1:40:03] Christ all these victories were
[1:40:05] temporaries Moses Jacob
[1:40:07] Abraham they're all temporary he said
[1:40:11] but Christ victory was eternal between
[1:40:14] Christ Jesus fought every enemy he said
[1:40:20] one day the chief warrior came down
[1:40:21] Jesus Christ the Son of God and there
[1:40:23] was an Easter
[1:40:24] that was a real v-day Jesus had thought
[1:40:27] prevail he fought against every enemy
[1:40:29] that was to be fought against and Jesus
[1:40:33] came into the day when he made this
[1:40:35] decision of what he would do after it
[1:40:37] received the Holy Spirit and I guess
[1:40:38] another bday when he was tempted of
[1:40:40] Satan to what Ernest might have said
[1:40:45] that was a bday when he could stand
[1:40:47] there and with Stannis Satan himself
[1:40:49] with three temptations right to his face
[1:40:51] he could say it is written I don't have
[1:40:54] to do that it is written I'm not doing
[1:40:55] what you're telling me to do
[1:40:56] it is Richard I'm not falling and
[1:40:58] worshipping something else where I wish
[1:41:00] I have got a madman Jesus is flesh
[1:41:03] person may be worse than God but he
[1:41:06] himself was the image of God amen
[1:41:08] and so that was a great meeting day
[1:41:11] Jesus overcame Satan hallelujah
[1:41:14] perhaps that every miracle Jesus did was
[1:41:17] a feat day when he raised the dead it
[1:41:19] was a beatnik yeah it's a V day when he
[1:41:25] walked on water at the V day see for a
[1:41:29] Christian many days can be B days you
[1:41:31] believe that sickness temptation
[1:41:35] everything that could be Jesus fought
[1:41:37] through every bit of it and had a V day
[1:41:40] he said that's exactly right he said
[1:41:47] Jesus death the resurrection was the
[1:41:48] ultimate v-day
[1:41:52] he said the Katie finally came to an
[1:41:54] hour of crucial hour that the debt must
[1:41:57] be paid Jesus had to come to the earth
[1:41:59] he had conquered every sickness he
[1:42:01] conquered everything now he must conquer
[1:42:03] the grade and when he conquered death
[1:42:06] death couldn't say in his presence he
[1:42:09] never even preached a funeral he proved
[1:42:12] that he had power over death and there's
[1:42:15] two more enemies there was the grave and
[1:42:17] held Hades in the grave so that day when
[1:42:21] he died he was so dead - the Sun was
[1:42:23] shining on the earth the earth had a
[1:42:25] nervous prostration The Rock's run out
[1:42:27] the hills he went down to have hunger
[1:42:30] death conquered hell and on Easter
[1:42:33] morning he conquered the grave he said
[1:42:35] talk about a complete
[1:42:37] a Rio vida amen so he conquered all the
[1:42:40] enemies that all the other patriarchs we
[1:42:43] know could not conquer the matter said
[1:42:45] he brought them out of the grave and he
[1:42:49] brought the captives that have been
[1:42:51] there the Bible said he bled captivity
[1:42:54] captive and now program brings it to us
[1:42:57] and he says now he ascended on high and
[1:43:01] gave gifts unto men tonight brings it to
[1:43:06] the fivefold ministry and the gifts of
[1:43:08] the Holy Spirit what was it swords
[1:43:12] he puts swords of the word in your hands
[1:43:15] to conquer to conquer what sickness sin
[1:43:20] superstitions evil to bring every living
[1:43:22] creature that wants to live bring every
[1:43:25] one of them to realization that because
[1:43:27] Jesus lives we shall live also their
[1:43:31] game we have to fight the fight of faith
[1:43:35] complete our victory for our complete
[1:43:38] victory is positive it's sure it's got
[1:43:41] to be we have the first fruits of it
[1:43:44] which is the baptism Holy Ghost is the
[1:43:45] firstfruits of their victory amen sorry
[1:43:50] we have the evidence of it in our heart
[1:43:52] now because we've already got the first
[1:43:54] battle behind us we've been able to
[1:43:56] conquer through faith of Jesus Christ we
[1:43:59] had a happy day and got saved and got
[1:44:02] baptized that is a be day or you can say
[1:44:04] this day I have overcome Satan's
[1:44:06] temptations in my past life all these
[1:44:09] temptations we've had be days we're so
[1:44:12] thankful for the beatings amen we're
[1:44:17] going to talk about money God say me he
[1:44:18] says he tried to get saved memory he
[1:44:20] remember he hammered and no hood upon
[1:44:22] the trees and said dear sir I know
[1:44:25] you're Jesus Christ when you saved me he
[1:44:27] said he never got an answer
[1:44:28] he said the devil whispered said why you
[1:44:31] doesn't send away your damned grace
[1:44:33] there's a little more grace see you men
[1:44:37] so mean until you won't forgive you
[1:44:39] remember remember when Romero said one
[1:44:41] of the reasons he knew that the Holy
[1:44:42] Ghost was he lost his temper that was
[1:44:45] one of the reasons he had a temper
[1:44:48] members teacher tried to have him to try
[1:44:50] things too
[1:44:50] get rid of his temper but he'd never
[1:44:51] overcome his temper he said when I knew
[1:44:54] my cover was gone that's one great sign
[1:44:56] on you I was born again hallelujah when
[1:44:58] I saw my cigarettes and worldly
[1:45:00] temptation chewing and evil movies when
[1:45:03] I saw that behind me that's one good
[1:45:04] sign I knew I was born again praise God
[1:45:06] I didn't do it yet because things that
[1:45:09] were causes me to be a slave
[1:45:11] now I had victory over them now I've
[1:45:13] been a conqueror amen
[1:45:16] look man said the first thing he knew he
[1:45:18] was starting speaking against the
[1:45:20] devil's didn't know I could be saved not
[1:45:22] I still could be saved I can still hear
[1:45:23] God's voice
[1:45:24] the first thing into a light came into
[1:45:26] the room and he said Lord he said let
[1:45:29] that light come back he said if I'm
[1:45:31] forgiven he said the light came back and
[1:45:33] he said he went left like a baby because
[1:45:35] God has showed him that he's forgiven
[1:45:37] that's a real v-day that's right
[1:45:41] oh my mother knew yay now if he closes
[1:45:48] by telling the story of the teenager
[1:45:50] young man who was in prison and he
[1:45:53] wanted a pardon and there was a governor
[1:45:56] they sent to the governor had a friend
[1:45:57] of the governor and the governor came
[1:45:59] down himself but the boy was in such an
[1:46:01] awful state as mine that the governor
[1:46:04] tried to talk to me said be quiet he
[1:46:06] said awful things I feel shut up we
[1:46:07] never say that but that's what it says
[1:46:09] I'm sorry
[1:46:10] be quiet I don't want to talk to you and
[1:46:13] he said I'm trying to part you don't be
[1:46:14] quiet
[1:46:15] can't you see I'm going to die pretty
[1:46:16] soon and then the governor leaves
[1:46:18] because the governor himself came down
[1:46:20] there but he couldn't show common
[1:46:21] respect to Authority and so he missed
[1:46:24] out on us party everybody matter said we
[1:46:27] don't want to miss out on our pardon he
[1:46:29] said the very governor of heaven earth
[1:46:31] will come down to our situation today
[1:46:33] aren't you grateful for that to give us
[1:46:35] a v-day what do we just have to do we
[1:46:37] have to have a humble respectful spirit
[1:46:40] to the Holy Spirit I mean that the Bible
[1:46:43] says if you honor God God Manar you the
[1:46:45] Bible said God honors every man in every
[1:46:47] nation who will humble themselves before
[1:46:49] the Lord that's exactly right
[1:46:51] now in closing I'm gonna start closing
[1:46:54] that here we start closing down
[1:47:01] now I started with my sure I got my
[1:47:04] inspiration for this I got it from the
[1:47:06] fourth of July and that was when they
[1:47:11] declared that they were free now all
[1:47:15] those men knew if they lost this war
[1:47:17] they could be hanging for that did you
[1:47:19] know that for high treason so this was
[1:47:23] not an easy decision to walk over there
[1:47:25] and sign your John Hancock and use one
[1:47:27] the signers of the original sign in
[1:47:29] there this was like a death so in a
[1:47:33] life-and-death situation what is the the
[1:47:36] person was really out for liberty in
[1:47:38] this case a person is really following
[1:47:40] the will of God in a life with that
[1:47:42] situation what are they going to do
[1:47:44] they're going to claim the victory and
[1:47:47] basically sign their name to it they're
[1:47:50] gonna declare that I will receive this
[1:47:52] promise and I'm willing to fight for it
[1:47:55] so write the Declaration of Independence
[1:47:59] really was that they have celebrations
[1:48:01] far as I read from Scripture I run from
[1:48:03] history I didn't see much celebrating to
[1:48:04] it on there the great the great victory
[1:48:08] celebration was when Washington after
[1:48:10] Yorktown Washington had all those
[1:48:12] British soldiers walking to New York and
[1:48:14] all the people you know they're kind of
[1:48:16] like captains rather ironic slaves and
[1:48:18] here's the men that you said you don't
[1:48:19] mistreat of all these British soldiers
[1:48:21] and they used to mistreat on there they
[1:48:23] are they're enslaved and now the people
[1:48:25] had victory now the people that don't
[1:48:27] have to worry about it just like when
[1:48:29] those past masters got grinding the days
[1:48:31] of Moses they've had all their
[1:48:32] taskmasters have been crowded and
[1:48:35] program said that's what it's like for
[1:48:37] us when we get victory over temptation
[1:48:38] all the demons of use of torments are
[1:48:41] drowned in the red blood of Jesus Christ
[1:48:44] amen
[1:48:45] the sea of Jesus Christ blood all those
[1:48:47] temptations all those Devils he sent our
[1:48:49] drown there and we got the victory
[1:48:51] through the blood of Jesus amen that's
[1:48:55] exactly right
[1:48:56] we could not have a bday without having
[1:48:59] first an Independence Day praise God
[1:49:02] where we stand upon our convictions and
[1:49:04] follow the word and put the word first
[1:49:08] and stand upon the promise of Liberty so
[1:49:12] I want to preach this message us and
[1:49:13] encourage
[1:49:15] because this quote came to my mind is
[1:49:17] from Christ that Mister God revealed I
[1:49:18] was just in this uh recently last week I
[1:49:23] think I was in some crisis mission God
[1:49:24] revealed and I'm sure once I read the
[1:49:26] quote you probably heard it before
[1:49:28] program said Jesus proves his
[1:49:31] resurrection life as he vindicates
[1:49:34] himself she the pride is independent
[1:49:37] from all others she's an independent
[1:49:43] woman a great speckled bird that's
[1:49:49] different from all others you remember
[1:49:52] the Bible on that the great speckled
[1:49:53] bird but she had his name she had his
[1:49:57] life so this is where I kind of fell
[1:50:00] inspired I'll think about this
[1:50:01] Independence Day and this quote came to
[1:50:03] my heart or my mind says the bride is an
[1:50:05] independent woman she's freed from all
[1:50:08] other men she's independent from all men
[1:50:11] but what is she she's dependent upon
[1:50:13] Christ and what the example program
[1:50:16] gives the speckled bird have you read
[1:50:19] that lately it's in Leviticus 14 if you
[1:50:22] read it it's the cleansing for a leper
[1:50:25] the very first thing they left were had
[1:50:27] to do was to go in to birds turtle doves
[1:50:30] pigeons had to bring them one of them
[1:50:34] had to be killed in an earthen vessel
[1:50:36] with running water over and all that
[1:50:38] blood and water mixed my thing about the
[1:50:40] Holy Spirit not in the water than the
[1:50:41] word all these things and then that dead
[1:50:44] bird was removed and then the living
[1:50:46] bird was dead the Bible says dipped
[1:50:49] dipped in the blood of its mate this is
[1:50:52] Bible the Bible read it until the
[1:50:54] biggest working one day and one two
[1:50:56] seven and then this bird covered in the
[1:51:00] blood of its mate would fly away the
[1:51:02] Bible said that's to be put loose on the
[1:51:05] field and this was the first signs of
[1:51:07] the sinner that you are forgiven that
[1:51:10] you're cleaning the sinner had to look
[1:51:12] down and see that that we that this bird
[1:51:16] is flying free because they're covered
[1:51:19] in the light of their mate and the
[1:51:22] church said this is going to let the
[1:51:24] leper know wow I
[1:51:26] I was so filthy dirty but I can be clean
[1:51:29] this is what God showing me God is going
[1:51:32] to have an innocent one died for me and
[1:51:34] I will be dipped in their righteousness
[1:51:36] dipped in their innocent blood and then
[1:51:38] wherever I applied people will see the
[1:51:41] life of my mate a pen they'll see the
[1:51:43] Holy Spirit on me because I'm covered in
[1:51:45] the cook and Nathan I'm covered in the
[1:51:48] life of Jesus Christ amen
[1:51:50] everybody knows that this makes her
[1:51:52] independent because she is all out loose
[1:51:55] in the overworld in the wilderness but
[1:51:57] everybody that sees her she's sees that
[1:51:59] she's covered in the blood of her mate
[1:52:01] I'm glad to be covered in the blood of
[1:52:03] Jesus Christ we are independently
[1:52:06] independen church the bride is an
[1:52:08] independent people
[1:52:09] we're not mayor are made of diet but the
[1:52:12] light of our mate remains on us amen
[1:52:15] underneath of course we know Christ
[1:52:16] lives as well but that's why we stay
[1:52:19] independent from systems and
[1:52:21] headquarters and all these things
[1:52:23] program said this is our V day the
[1:52:26] b-daman the life of God is covering over
[1:52:29] us and we're independent from any other
[1:52:32] thing we're only trusting in the life of
[1:52:34] our mate how many trusting in Jesus
[1:52:36] Christ today hallelujah romance of the
[1:52:40] bride is identified by him she's
[1:52:43] independent from all others keep thee
[1:52:46] only unto her as long as that you both
[1:52:48] shall live
[1:52:49] keep the only to him the word no
[1:52:51] adultery not one side of the nomination
[1:52:54] not one side of creed no adult should
[1:52:56] all the words and him alone personally
[1:53:01] identified by him his his property alone
[1:53:04] arches that be Christ property what did
[1:53:07] what did that bird do for that blood to
[1:53:09] get on nothing that just that was their
[1:53:11] position life what do we have to do
[1:53:14] nothing it's just our position in life
[1:53:16] to be believers a man had to accept his
[1:53:19] righteousness and fly away free to have
[1:53:22] a real bday let's do our feet my
[1:53:25] boundaries we are independent from any
[1:53:29] Creed of man any man handling we're free
[1:53:32] from that because we stay with the word
[1:53:33] were to fly free in Christ covered with
[1:53:37] the life of Christ how does it start you
[1:53:40] start with
[1:53:40] declaration of independence I'm going to
[1:53:42] be free from my temper I'm going to be
[1:53:44] free from greed I'm going to free from
[1:53:46] lust I'm going to be free from fear
[1:53:48] I'm going to be free you have to start
[1:53:50] by knowing that you are declaring I
[1:53:52] independent we're independent from that
[1:53:55] I was bought with a price I have a loan
[1:53:58] to somebody else I'm not my own I can't
[1:54:01] fight for myself I can't forgive myself
[1:54:02] I can't do anything by getting you
[1:54:04] myself I need somebody to do it for me
[1:54:06] amen
[1:54:07] I'm living off of someone else's life
[1:54:10] that's what we're doing today Church now
[1:54:15] I'm closing I'm goes about let me bring
[1:54:17] this back bring around full circle back
[1:54:20] to Washington Yorktown was the battle
[1:54:24] that changed everything and finished the
[1:54:26] American Revolution that's where we
[1:54:28] stood right there right by the trenches
[1:54:29] and watched his map gotta I got to run
[1:54:31] up him Lydia we ran out of the trenches
[1:54:32] and it was quite quite inspiring before
[1:54:37] Yorktown Washington had not won a
[1:54:39] victory for four years can you imagine
[1:54:41] coming to church and not having somebody
[1:54:43] heat him for four years not having
[1:54:45] somebody saved for four years what was
[1:54:49] it was testing time the arm had to go
[1:54:52] through tests they started question
[1:54:54] there's a lot of persecution on George
[1:54:55] Washington a lot of things we write in
[1:54:56] the papers is this I'm really on the
[1:54:58] leader we've met for years without the
[1:54:59] victory we've seen the devil whisper
[1:55:03] into hell you said you want to be free
[1:55:07] you should just give up
[1:55:09] can't you see how churches we can never
[1:55:11] give up on God's premise no matter how
[1:55:14] low it gets no matter how many losses
[1:55:16] you have in a row if you're still here
[1:55:19] there's still victory praise God
[1:55:21] there's still the promise of victory for
[1:55:24] us history says George Washington in
[1:55:29] Yorktown was the first one to build the
[1:55:31] trench and for six days there was a four
[1:55:33] of British that we're getting any help
[1:55:35] for six days they built trenched after
[1:55:37] trench after trench closer and closer
[1:55:39] and so they could overcome this floor to
[1:55:42] Yorktown of the British and that's what
[1:55:43] turned the whole thing and he was the
[1:55:45] first one to put that hammer in there
[1:55:48] and that shovel and start digging and
[1:55:50] everybody followed him he said
[1:55:54] this is a direct quote persons whose
[1:55:56] duty does not call them to the trenches
[1:55:59] and who assemble there merely to indulge
[1:56:01] in curiosity are not to walk I'm sorry
[1:56:04] hard to walk on the reverse of the
[1:56:06] trenches that they may not enter up the
[1:56:08] works another short question said if
[1:56:11] you're not up here in the front lines
[1:56:13] digging the trenches you secure on the
[1:56:14] other side so you get hit by the bullets
[1:56:17] praise God
[1:56:19] what are the trenches the trenches are
[1:56:21] the hardest work let's roll the sled is
[1:56:23] right let's run the lane where that's
[1:56:25] where the sore backs are and George
[1:56:27] Washington said if you're not going to
[1:56:28] get up here digging the trenches
[1:56:29] he said go stay on the other side George
[1:56:33] Washington said this as well as the
[1:56:35] beautiful quote at the short tip before
[1:56:38] the valley said the present moment will
[1:56:41] decide American independence and the
[1:56:43] glory and superiority of the Allies he
[1:56:46] could recognize this is the moment we've
[1:56:49] got to be free and we've got the labor
[1:56:51] to do it honey no no ma'am huh no the
[1:56:53] Bible says you if you want the kingdom
[1:56:55] of God you got to press into it
[1:56:57] Severino that jesus said the violent
[1:57:00] take the kingdom of God by force many
[1:57:03] times I told this to my mother on
[1:57:04] FaceTime missionary she coffee now
[1:57:06] FaceTime with her yesterday morning many
[1:57:09] times any one of the victories of God
[1:57:11] but we're not willing to keep fighting
[1:57:12] for him we got to be committed to keep
[1:57:15] fighting for them I told my momma said
[1:57:17] the Bible said give your diligence to
[1:57:19] make your calling election sure and she
[1:57:22] said where's inspection I need that
[1:57:23] scripture I said second Peter 1 verse 10

[1:57:28] diligence we got to be faithful we got
[1:57:31] to keep fighting the good fight of faith

[1:57:34] our independence praise God free from
[1:57:38] rule over anything any temptation any
