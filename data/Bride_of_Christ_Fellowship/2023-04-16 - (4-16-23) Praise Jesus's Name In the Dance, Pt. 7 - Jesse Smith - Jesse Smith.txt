TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the word of God Heavenly Father You Are Holy are worthy we give you thanks and praise we recognize your presence we want to worship you we want to give you praise and we want to hear your word make us blessings to just Joy committee thank you me on your way with each person they have free course or whatever the need is at the end of the service whether it's repentance rejoicing or whether it's healing spiritual natural word of Prophecy Lord God our Word of Wisdom or word of knowledge word of discernment whatever would mean dear God just have your way today where this is your pastor gorgeous little sheep inside Satan said do as your Stan let's take our Bibles here I'd like to go back to that dancing series I like to go back to Psalm 149 here if you could Psalm 149 verse 1. Psalm 149 verse 1. as you turn in there again that we're thankful God for God and for All His blessings I told you I'm in touch with a few more people hopefully we'll have some visitors the next few weeks like that my friend Corbin he's out of jail now and he's working with Dinah at Planet Fitness don't you remember him that he said he's got to get permission to come you know you know just let me know buddy I'll be there to pick you up right away come to the house of God and worship and also our Barber named Josh he said he wanted to try to make it today but maybe he'll slip in I don't know maybe he'll come to the 3pm service we'll see trying to be a light to him over these couple years we've been seeing him Psalm 149 praise God I thought brother any man you had a real good opening song there all the songs were good but that opening one about praising the Lord that was that was just what I was going to preach on today by God's grace sir we thank the Lord for that I'll read verse one and then I'll read one and two and then we can all read verse three together verse one says praise ye the Lord that's Jehovah praise ye Jehovah sing unto the Lord Jehovah a new song and his praise in the congregation of the Saints let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their King hallelujah how many joyful today praise God if not I hope you are by the end of this service by God's grace let's read verse three together ready one two three let them praise His name in The Dance Let Them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and heart praise God the tambourine and the harp verse 4 because for the Lord takes pleasure in his people God looks down from heaven and he's so thankful he's so happy he gets pleasure when he sees his children playing the tambourine dancing joyful God said I like that praise God that's my delight to see my children love me in that beautiful praise God he will beautify the meek with salvation let the Saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their beds let the high praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand look at that praising God but you're ready to fight with God's word at any time when the enemy might come around you're ready to fight the enemy how are you ready today babe by God's grace amen may God add His blessings to rhema's word you may be seated praise God so we'd like to look at this thought here praise His name with the dancing um I just want to go a little bit further on some work scriptures on joy and also on praising the Lord and I want to uh if I can here I want to show some more of those brother random quotes I hope I got them in the right place I used some of them in Napoleon uh yeah I thought that'd be a blessing just as a little review here by God's grace because I know you know Levi's fairly new to the message how many years you've been in the message brother four okay okay so not not so fairly near okay so you've been around a good good that's wonderful I didn't know I didn't know how many years it wasn't now brother arley's he's real fresh to it just like I said just got baptized about a month ago so um I just want to bring out some of these and some of these I wanted to preach here at our church but I never really got a chance to preach them because I was just LED on other topics but um here's here's the first time brother Brown talks about him dancing um he said he first heard the Full Gospel people heard them clap their hands and I thought as a Baptist now sure they have some church members or or don't or dignities anyhow I thought my that's horrible so brother Brandon thought clapping the hands was horrible at one point now look we just spent the whole service clapping and brother random in his infancy State as being a Christian you know he would have thought that's horrible too much clapping aren't you glad church we can all grow in the grace and knowledge of God look he said clapping's horrible yep we'll show some scriptures where God says clap your hands clap your hands for Joy the Bible says amen so it just shows you know we're raised in a certain way and and God wants all of us to grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord now think about this let's say you were raised in a quiet Church like brother Branham so you've got to grow out of that like Arlie and Levi you got to grow out of that and just learn to open up to Jesus now on the other side where I might have been raised or maybe uh sister Naomi and Beatrice I was raised in a Pentecostal Church where if you didn't have a tongue or interpretation then it's as if you didn't have church and you've got to learn to see God in the quietness too and I don't know if that's how it was I just thought I'd use that example because I know you you dance every service you know that's good I think that's a great thing that's a great way to get Victory it's a good way to keep victory in your life praise God but so see we you know some of us are born in different situations and so God is by the Holy Ghost he's going to teach us both right because the Bible said God inhabits the praise of his people so God is in all the loud praise but then the Bible said be still and know that I'm God I can't have both at the same time you know I personally you know we personally can't now in a service though people some people can be loud and shouting and enjoying God's spirit but then other people can be still and quiet in the same service and they can just be meditating and God can be speaking directly to them they've got to quiet themselves down and maybe they're just you know real you know sacred and leaning in their chair and just praying God where other people I might be dancing around and saying thank you Jesus hallelujah oh God is so worshiping God and I feel God's presence but God can speak in both ways and so the main thing church we don't want to like brother man we like he taught us we don't want to be sitting in the seat of the scornful we don't want to be criticized in others let me say like this you know you got a criticizing Spirit when you think bad of the person because it's okay to see someone needs correction but the love of God should make you want to go to that person and correct them in love right speaking the truth in love Hallelujah he said he said that's horrible imagine clapping is horrible that's what brother man said at one time in his mind and then to beat it all here got somebody on the floor and just started dancing up and down the floor oh my I just didn't understand aren't glad God says we can grow into understanding growing the knowledge and understanding of Jesus one night I was having a meeting in my Tabernacle they was having a New Year's watch in my Tabernacle I was teaching on the second coming of Christ I had a Blackboard up there I was drawing it out the best that I knew how he would descend that we may Ascend into glory and there was a little intermission and they were singing some songs while I was wrestling right about a four and a half hours of teaching straight I think I said six hours so I was wrong it was four and a half hours straight and they were singing a special and they there were some people come from Louisville which was Full Gospel people and they said they had a special some young ladies wanted to beat some little tin cans and things and they had a washboard with some Thimbles on it with their fingers and they was playing on this washboard I guess you've seen that hookup of the hookup and one of them was going to play the piano and they started playing that song there's going to be a meeting in the air in that sweet sweet bye-bye and God's own son will be the leading one at that meeting in the air and that little lady turned real white around the mouth and begin to beat the piano she must have been really really into it and I believe if they are have been three decks a key she played every one of them what do you think about that Malachi talk about the anointing all three decks of keys I never seen such playing in my life and that lady on that washboard hitting them Thimbles and a little blonde headed sister about so high jumped out in the floor and started dancing and I was sitting there right in my Tabernacle and I thought oh my here it is I thought now what why they have to do that so first it's horrible and then why they have to do that so I waited and looked around the people they looked up at me and I looked around and thought I'm a fundamentalist you couldn't show me that in the Bible look at that he thought he's so fundamental he thought he knew the Bible so well he didn't even realize it was in the Bible see Church isn't that sometimes the attitude we get we think we know everything that's in the Bible and church honest let's be honest we don't always know everything right right we need to we need to have a humble spirit Jesus said learn on me because I'm a meek and lowly in heart so a Christian is somebody who can Rejoice but also come to church and and they can be taught the word of God they want to learn the word of God as I said the other day the word disciple how many want to be a disciple of Christ it means a learner so you gotta you've got to learn more about Jesus all the time and you can't learn unless you take up your cross you take a sacrificial humble Spirit say I'm I'm dying to my pride today I don't know all about the Bible I don't know all about the message I can grow today as a learner but see the trouble is we people think they know all about it and you can't teach them nothing I love how brother Brandon had enough uh honesty to say I can learn more by God's grace he said there's just a whole lot of things that us a lot of us fundamentals don't know it's in there that's all so I looked around and thought my where did that dancing ever come from I was sitting there in the seat of the scornful of course so with the critical spirit not saying nothing I was afraid to say anything because I was afraid that they might be right and me wrong see that's why people sometimes criticize there is a part of them that they know they're wrong praise God see so I just let it go like that so I thought my Now isn't that terrible though right here in my Tavern look at that he's calling worship dancing terrible horrible terrible all these things now did God forgive him of course did God still use his gift of course but he had to grow out of this name calling and labeling all right some people labeled today oh that's legalists or they're Pentecostal or they're this or that and they label things they don't even know and they don't even realize it's in the Bible praise God that's ignorance but see God is going to be able to help the ignorant if they really want to get help praise God if they got the Holy Ghost Jesus said I'll guide you into all truth praise God so as Believers we got to we just got to stand with the truth point to the truth preach the truth and let the chips fall where they may if they're a child of God they will finally accept the truth praise God if they're a real child of God hallelujah Hallelujah what a terrible thing dancing in this beard Hallelujah he was just ignorant he said and this little lady out there her eyes closed dancing around first thing you know and got another one started I thought oh my oh my this is terrible well I guess we've had some terrible Services lately haven't we but that's in the Baptist mind or whatever you know the the carnal mind we've had great Services praise God so I begin to rehearse that aren't you glad God will bring all things to your remembrance he'll help you rehearse things in your mind oh in the Bible they did dance and I thought when they danced what was it dancing was spoke of pharaoh was pursuing Israel and all the enemy was drowned Miriam picked up the tambourine begin to beat the tambourine begin to dance and all the daughters of Israel filed her dancing I thought well there they had the victory I love what cam brought out she was at least 85 years old we don't have any 85 year olds in here by God's grace but an 85 year old woman picked up the tambry and said this is not a time to be sorrowful this is a time to be joyful praise God all of our enemies are done with praise God Amen amen those enemies I saw for all my life I'll see them no more praise God it took an 85 year old woman look at the wisdom in that amen see some of you with more years on our lives we should have more wisdom praise God and we need a woman or we need somebody who's led by the Holy Spirit to start worshiping God and really giving God praise amen a real sacrifice of praise he said well there they had the Victory and then I read in David when the ark had been away so long then when he'd returned back why he was so happy he started dancing he had the victory his sweetheart kind of made fun of him kind of laughed at him he said well you don't like that watch this and down there he went around and around he went again and I thought well she sat up there and laughed at him and God put a curse on her I said well he said David our a man after my own heart well I thought the only thing is the matter with me I just ain't got enough Victory Maybe oh church I I just want to have victory in my life I don't want to be a defeated Christian I know there's times here we gotta we gotta fight we got to struggle but I don't want to live a defeated life I want to try them because the Bible said Jesus always causes us to Triumph in Christ amen and Paul told the Romans I will shortly put Satan under your feet praise God Jesus would put Satan under their feet whatever when Satan wasn't under their feet before maybe he would they were maybe they felt they were battling a sword and a sword as it was but he said British you're not going to put Satan under your feet and you're going to be victorious praise God so the reason now people don't clap they don't shout they don't Rejoice they don't dance is they just don't have enough Victory praise God oh God give us Victory praise God and as we've been praying here let's keep praying God give me more reasons to dance give me more Victory so I can dance more praise God that's my prayer Hallelujah in a few minutes something happened now this might shock you when I come to myself I was out there with that little girl dancing out on the floor that's right just the thing that I thought I wouldn't do I did that's my prayer God lead me to do things I think I never do if it glorifies you hallelujah thank God Amen Amen in other words in other words the Lord used me however you see fit help me not to put any limits on you praise God but help me just be a universal praise God Hallelujah I never was on a dance floor in my life but I guess I did it all right I guess it was all right of course it was all right because he got scripture for it I sure felt awful not awful awful good I sure felt awful good I had a lot of Victory after that so that would be all right then I guess Hallelujah but I said God's in music don't You Believe God's in music certainly God's music he's in art he's the god in the universe he's in his creatures and he's in the church he's in creation he's in the universe God all God's all around just everywhere he's here in the schreider auditorium right now this night right present God's everywhere I just wonder sometime if he just take the shades off our eyes till our sight would be fast enough to catch his presence in the building in other words God is here may he open our eyes so we can see him other than if he was here like he was here with David David would dance all around because God's here oh my God remember why did David dance because God's presence was now amongst his people in church don't we believe that that the prince of Jesus Christ is here today praise God he's with his people hallelujah he's here to bless his people strengthen his people guide his people edify them correct them build them up Hallelujah get them in this perfect will praise God that's why he's here praise God [Applause] he's here in the presence of his people hallelujah that's why he was shouting and the other the other Revelation was Saul didn't have the ark and Saul was not inquiring at the ark and David wanted the ark so he could inquire at the ark the prince of God and remember that was his one prayer he said one thing I've desired that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to see his Beauty and inquire in his holy Temple in other words David when the ark was coming in he said now I finally get my heart's desire Jesus is here and I get to talk to him praise God and he'll talk back amen oh Hallelujah see brother said David dance rejoice and dance in the spirit running around why he saw the word back in his place I'm going to skip past where's the quotes I was looking for those are not the quotes I want to get a couple more here let me go back I want to get the ones I didn't show you about the agonizing in prayer yeah maybe they're up here yeah yeah here there sorry now brother man says it's not here well the man says I know there's a lot of finesseism the fourth seal people carried on I know sometimes they do it when the music's jumping up and down and everything I know that goes and I believe that too look brother man believes that brother man believes it's okay to dance and praise God while the music is going I believe in that too I've seen people in that day when as long as the music's playing everybody was jumping and screaming when the music stopped they stopped see I believe that that's still all right as far as I'm concerned as long as people lives right but now you start bringing that word that's the thing that actually brings life is the word and that brings a joy of stimulation of new wine praise God Hallelujah so that's the attitude brother Brandon had let the people Rejoice let the people dance let them sing even if they just do it while the music's on let them do it as long as they live right but the most important thing is the word of God that will give you life Hallelujah amen I love this question brother brother man asked about Miriam Miriam picked up the tamarine down the bank she went dancing Hallelujah yes sir she had the victory did you ever get that much let's ask us let's let's ask ourselves that question today have I ever had that much Victory praise God I could dance for Jesus amen I don't care who is watching I don't care if anybody was in the church I don't care because I was only thinking about God Amen that's Victory praise God that's what brother Brown said did you ever get that much Victory oh victory is mine a victory is my a victory today is mine oh I told Satan to get thee behind cause Victory today is mine amen did you ever get that much amen glory to God Amen Hallelujah you're telling me I was a sinner I wasn't raising the message you're telling me some people tell me that God save me out of sin and then brought me to the message and I shouldn't dance anymore but yet I danced for Satan out in the world you're telling me that it's okay to dance for Satan but it's not okay to dance for the Lord you're telling me you know Satan will move someone to dance what is Satan always trying to do he's trying to impersonate God brother bam said it was Satan who stole the music from God God had music first but Satan impersonated it and then he brings that impersonation in other words everything starts with God dancing started with God shouting started with God worshiping clapping hands started with God don't say like this if I dance for Satan and worshiped him and I was filled with his spirit will now build with Jesus Spirit now I'm going to dance for Jesus amen I'm going to praise him because I'm filled with the new spirit praise God and I've got victory in Christ amen the addictions don't hold me anymore the spirit the evil spirits don't hold me anymore I'm free I'm out of the prison praise God I'm a new creature in Christ Jesus amen amen hallelujah praise God and the Bible says let them praise the Lord in the dance amen I got permission I got permission to Praise Jesus amen he gave me permission and it's in the Bible praise God it's in the Bible praise God this says I can dance amen this says I can shout this says I can see and this is my absolute amen ah I got one absolute that's the word of God Amen do you ever get that much Victory [Applause] Hallelujah remember brother says our spirit is clean fresh it's real it's sober and serious but nonetheless full of the joy of the Lord I feel some Joy this morning Lydia and the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the Lord as the world is when it Savers and delights in its pleasures let me look up this word exuberant here so that will help us it's a pretty big word exuber it means Joy joyously unrestrained and enthusiastic there's no restraints to my joy I keep spitting forgive me front row to get you some windshields there in a few moments here but when you are we ought to be just as exuberant as the world is except we're exuberant for Jesus Christ Glory Hallelujah so I don't have no restraints on me the only restraint on me is the Holy Ghost it's telling me do this it's telling me don't do this it's telling me stand now shout now Dance Now pray now Menace you know intercede now whatever say Amen now that's my only restraint is Lord what do you want me to do praise God because Lord I want that I want to be exuberant I want to be free I want a clean Spirit praise God Hallelujah and the pleasure of a Christian is worshiping the Lord see we ought to savor worshiping God we are a delight in praising God it ought to be something that we enjoy Brother Ali I enjoy dancing for Jesus I it's a joy especially after last Saturday night praise God it's a joke we had almost a six hour service so we had about an hour dancing about two two hours of preaching about two hours of praying and pleading for God at the altar agonizing in prayer it was a beautiful service I think seven people got the Holy Ghost in that service if I'm not mistaken all young people all young people but see that's our pleasure that's our Delight both the Christians in the world are human both have emotions the difference is our hearts and emotions are purely on the Lord and His glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh oh now brother man says some people don't believe in tongues and things like that he said you've seen one time I used to think about dancing in the spirit see somebody dance in the spirit now I've seen the mockery put on of it but I've seen the real thing too so I come to find out why could people dance in the spirit well I never seen one yet get out of the way I've never seen one yet act immorally how many can say Amen to that in other words when we dance in the spear or people we know we never see them live immorally they always do it to glorify God hallelujah praise God in the Lord in other words like Jesus said you judge a tree by its fruit praise God oh man forgive me I'm getting real zealous here you got to judge a tree so that's fine if they dances they scream or shout or speak in tongues whatever they do but after that they should live a life that's worthy of the Gospel praise God and that's what we do praise God amen I always see it just as decently and in order and sweetness oh you can dance in sweetness yes you can oh brother brother Jesse dancing service today yeah brother it was so sweet you should have seen it he had his hands up to the Lord and he was he was smiling his eyes were closed he did not have a thimble though but somebody needs to bring me a thimble we got one at home I need to bring a thin we'll start playing on the washboard praise God because that's what they did in brother Brown's meetings and the church said Hallelujah he said they had a thimble and a washboard and they're playing they're going to meet they're going to meet Jesus in the air praise God oh and even Sinners run to the Altar and get saved when it's going on well I wondered why it was and I come to find out it's victory press that with you wheat this quote was a reality to brother Branham he saw people dance and then Sinners would run to get saved we saw people dance and then Believers would go up and get the Holy Ghost same thing praise God people getting eternal life because Jesus Christ is the same praise God he's the same as he was in 1962 praise God Jesus is still the same dancing brings Victory praise God oh Hallelujah brings victory all right uh yeah no I wanted to show this call I want to rehearse this again why did David you know God looked down from heaven while David's dancing brother Randolph said and he said look at David he's a man after my own heart why he'd done lost all Pride see that's the reason people don't dance shout clap scream whatever praise God they can't praise God because they're prideful pride is self-confidence in other words I know more about it than God I know more about it than the preacher or whatever I know more about it than the song leader and I'm not going to praise God I'm not going to praise God like that because I know more about it I'm prideful brother man said pride is one of the most worst sins he says such an awful sin to have pride where you think so much of yourself that you can't think about that God Made You To Worship Him and and someone with pride won't even let God use them to worship Him in other words they won't even let their creator be worshiped think I'll think out such an awful thing pride is it exalts itself well I know more about it than God I know more about it than the word of God nobody knows more about it than Jesus praise God hallelujah it's the word of God that matters praise God so see why did David dance brother Adam said David node he was acquainted with the possessor of heavens and earth and here was the word of God coming right back among them and David was so happy he danced he danced just as hard as he could now I'm in danger here if I tried the Bible said he leaped with all of his might if I leave with all my might I might hit my head on the ceiling I'm gonna do it just so you can see what David might have danced like okay David dance I'll just go ah so David danced he jumped as high as he could and God looked down and said That's my boy I'm proud of my son that's what the Bible says amen he's a man after my own heart praise God the Bible said he leaped with all of his might I used to be able to LEAP 24 feet I don't think I can do that anymore but I can sure leap for Jesus back then praise God I just do the best I can now here's the one this was beautiful I didn't preach this yet at our church because I just found the quote a few weeks before we preached there in a poignant brother man said he said sometimes people do get interested too much in Emotion in other words if I don't have some emotion then then God didn't move or God's not with me program tries to bring some balance to that we become interested if if we can dance so see some people just want to know can I dance or can I shout can I speak with tongues perhaps I believe it I believe in every bit of that so dancing shouting speaking of tongues brother man believes in all of that but if we have that and don't have that agonizing weeping broke up Spirit God can never use it so see Church see how it's a bounce now look at that service there two Saturday nights ago what was first the first was the joy and the dancing and then we finished with a bunch of agonizing prayer and calling on God weeping and rejoicing right we're weeping people weeping for the Holy Ghost people weeping for their lost loved ones I thought it was so beautiful that we had both praise God but Church there can be times too where it's just it's just a worship service it's a service where we're supposed to just glorify God God wants us to be thankful God wants us to be happy praise God glad wants to God wants us to rejoice and be glad for all he's done for us praise God what's wrong with that I mean we have a whole day we call Thanksgiving why can't we have a whole church service we call Thanksgiving amen hallelujah amen Glory why can't we the Bible says to do it praise God Amen what is it it's it's demon spear sometimes even in the message and other Baptists and everything that want to hinder worship to God it's that same spirit that was on Michael she wanted to stop David's worship but David said you you don't like that wait till what I do next you didn't like how I ran around he said I'm going to run around again you watch honey sweetheart you watch this I'm going to go praise God I'm gonna jump higher praise God if you don't like that amen because it wasn't for you it was before the Lord praise God amen don't let any demon take your worship for Christ away amen you always got a reason to praise I still got a reason no matter what's going on I still got a reason to praise God then things are good but we got to have the other to go with it we've left off the main thing gone for the secondary so see someone that they just want to dance all the time they just want to shout or they just want to speak in tongues all the time without agonizing in prayer something's wrong because we know what Ezekiel 9 says right God will Mark he's going to mark all the Jews that sigh and cry for the Abominations done in the city and the Bible says we are Kings and Priests unto God and we as priests that means we must intercede for the Lost we must intercede for our families intercede for our friends praise God how many how many how many do that by God's grace you got to have both but the thing of the message is a lot of people just just have I don't even know if they weeper agonize they just go to church do they weep in do they have any weeping Services where they really weep well we know a lot of them don't have dancing services something's wrong with that but Ram just said so right they just don't have enough victory the Sea church I don't want to be a pastor that leads you to to failures I want to be a pastor that points you to victory praise God you can overcome you can be a Victor God will always cause you to Triumph I'm using that again in Christ Jesus amen if God's for you who can be against you praise God Hallelujah who shall lay any charge to God's elect it is God that justifies a Christian amen [Applause] there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus amen who walk after the spirit and not after the flesh amen oh doesn't that word just energize you praise God that's what mother rep says it's the word that actually brings life amen I have no condemnation God's for me praise God there's no charges against me nothing can separate me from the love of Christ amen that's life amen that's life pouring into your soul Church believe it live by it it's keeping you alive amen ah I'm unrestrained today I hope somebody looks and says ma he's really exuberant today I said that's exactly what the Holy Ghost is praise God all right that's that's the or the finish of that one that's that's all review mostly except for that one quote that's our review now I want to get to my new stuff praise God or maybe things I haven't preached yet now I preach this in Napoleon but not really here the Bible said let them praise the Lord with dance that means you have to allow it the pastors have to allow it and the church said I like how brother Shelley allows it I like that he's got a good Revelation on this you gotta love him people that shut it down shame on them shutting down the spirit of God the Bible says quench not the Holy Spirit remember those verses who's trying to shut down worship it was Michael or McCall I always say McCall it was Judas Iscariot telling uh Lazarus sister don't you don't need to what a waste this was what a waste and Jesus says let her leave her alone praise God Satan get behind her Jesus will always stand up for True worshipers amen see it's the spirit of McCall the spirit on Jesus Judas is scary it's in other words it's Satan's spirit that will try to stop the worship of God right and the Bible said let them praise His name name means Authority or Glory or fame and Jesus means Jehovah is salvation Jehovah means the self-existent one or the existing one so we must allow Jehovah's people to praise His name the existing one in the dance Hallelujah we got to allow it how many how many want to be allowed praise God I don't want to disallow because then I break the scripture Hallelujah if they could dance under the blood of bulls and goats what about the precious blood of Jesus Christ amen yeah the blood of bulls and ghosts just covered over sin it just covered over sin right just covered over but the blood of Jesus Christ abolishes all sin it forgives all sin it sends it away and God doesn't remember praise God because the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better things than the blood of Abel praise God the blood of Abel spoke Vengeance Vengeance Vengeance Jesus blood speaks Mercy forgiveness Grace power and victory praise God victory because remember every time the Old Testament state would leave the sacrifice and think of that they killed the animal they they bled it all out the Bible said they would have a remembrance of their sin to the next time now that's that should help us too that when we come and confess our sins we should truly repent and then we should let the Holy Ghost help us forget I must say it again when we come up for prayer confessing our sinner wherever you confess your sin we should be so in contact with Jesus and say Jesus now help me to forget that I did this so I can walk in the spirit without condemnation because that's the difference between animal blood and Holy Blood oh my God hallelujah there should not be a remembrance of the sins that we did in other words the condemnation should not come back well Jesse you did that last week or you did that last year no there's no more remembrance of it he's renewed my mind amen I Got A Renewed mind he's transformed My Mind by the word of God hallelujah I'm not gonna let that discourage me anymore because it's forgiven it's under the blood praise God so let them praise His name in the dance and dance the Hebrew word means to twirl or whirl so dance means the troll that's why I was twirling up here because that's what it means I thought about that all the planets how they twirl right so when we dance we're just joining creation Hallelujah I thought about this too Ezekiel Saw Jesus as the wheel in the middle of the wheel turning so look at God's spirit God's spirit's always moving to God's always on the Move praise God he's always rejoicing amen he's he's the God of all Victory praise God who's going to defeat God how many believe Jesus always has the victory praise God even in death it was Victory praise God because through death he defeated death Hallelujah so when brother amen opened up with I command my hands and praise the Lord this was exactly the one I was on right here commands the praise the Lord God knows my heart buddy I was like oh that's just my first one that's my first point now look ye that fear the Lord Praise Him how many fear of God today now fear means uh to reverence right to to honor greatly to greatly honor if you fear God you honor him with all your praise with all with all your heart in other words you think of him before anything else I'm honoring him first above everything else if you fear the Lord Praise Him are you the seed of Jacob glorify him and fear Him all ye seed of Israel while you say well I'm not Israel I got some verses Coming For You priest my praise shall be of thee in the great congregation I will pay my vows before them that fear Him the meek shall eat and be satisfied they shall praise the Lord that do what seek him see Church the more you seek God The More You Want To Praise Him because his presence come down and meet you when you seek him Jesus said draw an eye to me I'll draw an eye to you see that's another reason people don't praise God because they haven't been spending any time with God right because they know they don't fear God they don't honor God enough no they're still saved we still got promises salvation but we've got to learn to be a disciple we got to learn to be a follower of Christ to take up the cross daily and follow him he says your heart the speaking of the worshiper your heart shall live forever think of that there's no end to your soul praise God there's going to be an end to the United States there's going to be an end to Death there's going to be an end to war there's going to be end to disease there's going to be an end to cancer but there will be no end to your soul because it's God's Property praise God amen keep seeking God hallelujah so what is fear remember fear is profound honor people have told me this before like they say you go to church twice on Sunday and their eyes get real big like like profound honor I said yeah to them is profound honor now to us it's just that's just how we serve God but they're like all day even Christians they don't they don't have that profound honor I mean you you preach three times a week and they that they they can't understand it but to us it's the joy of being in the presence of Jesus we just do it because we know it's the right thing to do and God blesses us in it we're blessed because we spend this time because we're seeking God there it is amen we're blessed because we see God the more we seek Him the more we find him amen hallelujah praise God what is so fear the lord is profound to honor and remember if you profile profoundly honor Jesus Christ you're going to be what sad or happy what do you think he has made me glad oh he has made me glad I Will Rejoice for he because you feared God Amen [Applause] see when we give God the most honor when we give God the most praise and we seek his face that's when we're the happiest people whether things are going good or bad you know with everything else in our life but that's the key to happiness fearing God profoundly honoring our Lord Jesus Christ how many are witnesses of that praise God he's made me happy remember fear of God is all these things it's moral reverence it's it's your confidence in God if you want confidence in God fear God if you want a refuge fear God if you want a starting place to get more wisdom fear God if you want a fountain flowing with life fear God these are all scriptures I'm not this I'm just summarizing this sermons I preached a while ago if fear is also your anointing to hate evil I keep giving into sin I keep giving a sin well you don't you don't hate evil enough you got to honor God more so you hate the evil oh yes fear is your constant source of happiness and fear the lord is also the conclusion about your life's purpose now more verses rejoice in the Lord oh ye righteous for praise is calmly beautiful for the upright in other words you want to have a beautiful service start praising God you if you want to walk out of those doors and say what a beautiful presence that was somebody needs to start praising God someone needs his heart rejoicing Hallelujah and Haven it can be you too honey like I was saying in Napoleon I like how God's using some of us somebody's got to start it praise God we all come in here like battle warned veterans like oh I battled all week I don't know if I can praise God but by the end we can be dancing around he just changed the whole situation amen that's true how many times I come to church I'm tired especially on a Wednesday night usually not Sunday morning Wednesday night I'm exhausted I don't feel like preaching I don't feel like singing but pretty soon somebody starts brother amen singing the song very soon hands get clapping pretty soon we start preaching God's word and by the end I can hardly close service now somebody ought to say Amen on that [Applause] somebody ought to say I'm a witness to that he could hardly close service Hallelujah because worshiping God makes a beautiful atmosphere praise God amen well that's a beautiful service bro Jesse why because everybody started rejoicing not just me everybody was rejoicing joyful glad about what Jesus has done for them praise him with the harp sing on him with a sultry and the instrument of ten strings now brother man jokes and says here's my ten string instrument right here one two three four five six seven eight nine ten strings I sure like to use them praise God and they haven't worn out yet they have bled a couple times but they don't wear out sing unto him an old song well old ones can be good but he said sing a new song and play skillfully with the Quiet noise every time no with a loud noise oh my now Church remember you gotta balance that be still and know that I'm God there are seasons of mourning where everybody's hurting in the church or we're trying we're trying to enter into the suffering of somebody else those should be quiet services we're saying God strengthen our brother God strengthen our sister we're seeking your face we know your God even though this tragedy happened or even though this difficult things happen I know you're God Hallelujah but there's other times it's time to make some noise praise God because the god of Heaven is looking down and saying where's my children today who's got the victory today praise God who accepted my victory today praise God does he always offer victory of course that's why we come to church do you hear the word of God the word sets us free the word gives us Victory praise God and remember none of these are suggestions um you might want to try a new song sometime or you know consider being loud sometimes no he just says sing it play it [Music] guy really beats on him or brother amen really goes loud on there don't be discouraged God told them to do that amen as long as I'm Pastor they're going to do it by God's grace they can vote me you can vote me out or whatever but as long as I'm Pastor I'm standing with God's word praise God rejoice in the Lord oh ye righteous for Praise Is Beautiful what is praise to give a ringing cry I'm not sure how to a ringing it rings I don't know how to do it it just rings out Glory it's not just a glory amen that's how I worship when I was in Domination I was so afraid to I would only only raise my hands like this as long as some other college student was raising their hands I'd go You Are Holy everybody see it that's not what God says God says praise me with exuberance Hallelujah for joy give a ring and cry cry out aloud exaltation and praise give a ring and cry singing out loud ringing let it ring Let the Praises Ring Hallelujah amen Let Freedom Ring and I'm talking about spiritual praise God thank God for natural I thank God for Natural Freedom but the most of our freedom is spiritual Freedom praise God that's right a Psalm of Praise Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands joyful we don't want to come in here being all morning I all sad now there's a there's a time for it's time for that if something awful just happened but the Bible said Make a Joyful Noise all you lands we all got some land we live on right so all of our land serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that has made us and not we ourselves in other words I didn't come here by my own choosing God sent me here praise God I'm not the self-existent one Jehovah's a self-existent one he made me and I am the Sheep I'm just one of his sheep in the pasture or his brother Adam said I'm just one of the Pebbles on the beach praise God Hallelujah praise the Lord I'll praise the Lord with my whole heart in the Assembly of the upright in the congregation the whole heart in other words put all your emotion into it put all your love into it everything that you have put all your joy you got in you think about like this church you're like a sponge and God just wants to squeeze out all your joy in the service Just Give It All to Jesus that's how I feel sometimes I lead church I feel like God squeeze out all the energy on my body Oh My Guitar can you drive home tonight Malachi but he said give God your whole heart don't leave out your heart give God all your praise all your love all your emotions give Jesus everything praise God give them all your love because the works of the Lord are great sought out of all them that have pleasure therein so see we seek out God's Works God do this in my life Lord I pray you Minister here Lord Heal that person Lord save that Soul we're seeking out all of God's Works in our lives Psalm 113 praise ye the Lord Praise all you Servants of the Lord praise the name of the Lord three times he said praise praise praise glory in other words Rejoice Rejoice Rejoice amen I was hoping somebody would Rejoice at some point Church Rejoice Rejoice amen blessed to be the name of the Lord from this time and forevermore from the rising in the sun unto the going down to the same we should be on our smartphones working is that what the Bible says that's what we feel like though sometimes don't raise your hands I'm a slave to my father I'm a slave to my work from the rising of the Sun to the going down that's actually the opposite of what we should say ah I like to have praise God we should be praising God from the time we get up to the time we finally left hands down amen amen glory we should see the time we wake up it's a blessing to be awake and I'm going to read the Bible I'm going to pray I'm going to sing I'm gonna put on my favorite song at the time and just let it Loop over and over and over again that's what I do actually start sing along start tapping along get in the spirit of worship so as long as you're awake that's a time to praise God Rejoice Rejoice Rejoice Rejoice from the morning to the maritime praise God who is liking the Lord Our God who dwelt on high now look even God humbles himself so why can't we humble ourselves who's like our Lord God who humbles himself to behold the things there in heaven and in Earth remember he's outside of Heaven if this is heaven he's he's outside of that he's so great I mean his spirit is just outside of that and then Earth is down the Earth Is His footstool so there's Earth here's Heaven God's he just is above all that and yet he humbles himself to minister to the to speak to the angels and then he humbles himself to speak to you and I that's why you should praise him that's why you should Rejoice Rejoice rejoice it's just like holy holy holy that's what the cherubimes do Rejoice Rejoice Rejoice holy holy holy is the lord God almighty praise God well I'm A Smith so that's why I'm pounding things on a Smith like a silversmith or something or a Goldsmith Glory although I never really work with my hands like that but anyways he raised up the poor on the dust that's exactly what he did to my to me in the natural and the spiritual we were dirt poor six kids uh my parents were divorced living off of government food and God Raised Me Out of the Dust and he lifted the knee out of the dunghill where now I can feed eight children and I don't need government assistance because God has assisted me I guess I got Heavenly government assistance if I can say that amen praise God this is what God does that's why we do that Compassion International right to raise somebody up we got I think two of them right just like hey we're just like Phil we're trying to raise people up out of poverty raise them up naturally and of course by by the grace of God they'll see the spiritual things of God to raise them up out of their sins and bring them into Jesus Christ who is the word of God he lifts the needy out of the dunghill dunghill what an awful place to be a dung Hill but Jesus lifts people out of that place the place of waste right the waste place he brings you out of the waste Place Hallelujah and he lifts you up he improves your life how many thank God he improves your life he improves your health brother Harley Danny hallelujah praise God he lifts us up why because he wants to be praised that's why Arley can come and praise the Lord right hallelujah praise God that's his job that's this is our God this is who he is amen he loves us he saves us this is who Christ is amen he loves us and saves us praise God saves us from ourselves oh praise the Lord all you Nations praise him all so well brothers that was just for the Jews well here he said oh nice you're all a Double L brother man says for his merciful kindness is great towards us and the truth of the Lord endures forever praising the Lord Paul cites this in Romans 19. so Paul is telling the Romans you know you need to praise God too not just the Jews Gentiles need to praise God to you need to praise God with some dance you need to praise God with some shouts some ringing I'm not even sure how to Voice rings but he said that the Gentiles might glorify God for his Mercy why because he's been merciful to you he didn't give you what you deserved he spared you from what you deserved as is written for this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles and sing unto thy name and again he said Rejoice ye Gentiles with Israel Gentiles you just start just dance just like Israel dances amen and again so three three scriptures he quotes for the Gentiles to praise God like the Jews Praise You the Lord on your Gentiles and Lord him all ye people that means honor honor them all you people that's the that's the verse from Isaiah I'm sorry from Saul now here's the verse church when you clap It's actually an expression of joy all right [Applause] let the floods clap their hands let the Hills joyful together all nations I thank you for the rain thank you for the blessings thank you for opening up heaven and we ought to praise God too amen ah thus save the Bible praise God go to Isaiah 55 12 the same thing oh you clap too much or what do you mean God said Praise Him from the time I wake up to the time I go to bed and if I want to clap why can't I clap praise God shame on these people that they just they have a critical spirit or something but God's God's faithful praise God God will God will help them if they're true children of God oh yeah they'll they'll get straightened out real quick if they're really children of God like brother Irvin said there a couple weeks ago he was just crying he was rejoicing after that sermon and uh excited about being baptized he just said brother Jesse he kind of I'm just trying to remember the best he could but brother Irvin said to think about this he said I'm 59 years old and most people this age cannot change their ways he said but look what God has done he's opened up my eyes and my whole life is changing before my very eyes he said because in the Amish community once you're stuck in a way you're in that way right but Jesus comes in he changes everything he turns the page brother amen he takes your ashes he gives you beauty amen he takes your morning he gives you dancing Hallelujah [Applause] amen thank god brother Harley hallelujah praise God that's what Jesus Christ does amen and with tears he said I'm 59 and my life is transforming before my very eyes amen he said the thing that God would do that for me and other people he says they just can't see it that just shows he's elect God chose him before the foundation of the world oh thank you Lord Isaiah 55 12. for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains in the Hills shall Break Forth before you into singing think about that mountains and Hills will sing before them and all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands so when Israel goes out with joy and peace all creations clapping clapping with them all your God's people you're God's children hallelujah oh they just go out everywhere oh my God it's for me praise God our Nature's with me praise God who can stop me praise God only my sin can stop me only my sin can stop me right because all Nature's for me God's for me only my Disobedience will stop the blessing of God right that's what the book of lamentation says let me find that real quick here what was it uh sin has taken away the dance it was in Lamentations oh now you don't want to work when you're in front of everybody huh oh it just froze up okay uh I had a Lamentations verse I don't know if I can find it real quick you'll probably better look on my phone here yeah probably better look on my phone Where'd I put my phone yeah turn the Lamentations you've got your Bible here the Bible said it's sin that takes away the dance and I just want to read that again I think it's lamentation is five but I'm just trying to go from memory here if anybody finds it shout it out there's Lamentations five fifteen yeah praise God lamentation is 5 15. I'm almost done here I think I'm preaching an hour and 10 minutes now maybe Lamentations 5 15 and 16. the joy of our heart is ceased our dance is turned into mourning the crown has fallen from our head warns us that we have sinned that's just what Satan wants to do he wants to trick you into deceiving you or put some enticing lust before you so it will cut off all your dancing it'll cut off all your victory remember Church he's like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour but he's not the line of the tribe of Judah I'll tell you that amen again what a imposter what an impersonator he's like a lion but Jesus isn't like alive he is the line amen and he's fighting our battles amen Hallelujah [Applause] she had sin it's some sin that Satan puts on people and takes away the dance takes away the praise the Rejoice Rejoice Rejoice the holy holy holy out of the congregation my that just struck me now Look at Heaven don't even have night and day and yet they got holy holy holy all all the day long they don't have any night and that's and the Bible says just like Jesus said let it be done on Earth as it is in heaven praise God ah Hallelujah thank God um praise God for the word of God let me see how many more scriptures I got here well I sure got a lot um you know what maybe I'll let's save that for uh let me close with these some quotes from other brand just I think there'll be encouragement to you I'll say that for maybe Wednesday by God's grace tonight I think with the children I'll teach on the 30 Bible verses that Define the message I put that video out yesterday I don't know if anybody saw but um we've gone through like 12 of them in our Bible says okay praise God that's the combat all these people say the tapes are the message I know brother man said the Bible is a message the tapes point us to the message the message is Jesus Christ is the same yesterday that's already in the Bible That's Hebrews 13 8. that's that's what the message is but these uh brand of worshipers and tapers were shame on them but that's why I got to do that so to prove to them that their own Prophet said that they claim to believe I I don't know I don't I don't think I read this quote to you so I think uh at least I haven't read it lately so correct me if I'm wrong this is a really beautiful quote roadman was up in Colorado now think think about this 70 miles from Civilization now another place he says 60 miles so you get that point you know he's he's a far way away from civilization and he's looking down upon civilization he said just a Rancher and I go he's I just go there to be alone my soul we live there and look at the stars think about that he spent time just going out just to spend time with God and just look at nature just to relax and love God and there come up a storm I had to get behind a tree it rained hard the wind blew and then after it quit blowing the ice was hanging all over the trees there bro I walked from behind the tree and the sun was setting in the West his that's God Jesus's great eye was looking through the crevice in that rock I raised up my hand I said great Jehovah I see you looking at me I see you looking at me through the sunset hallelujah praise God look in nature when brother I was out in nature he was always looking for God and then he realized as I'm looking for God God's looking for me amen don't you know that church God is looking for you at all times God is longing for your fellowship excuse me sister and God is looking for you and so we ought to take more time to look for him praise God because he's already looking for us amen you know honestly church I could open this up and say look at those clouds up there I see you Jesus you love me you put that you put that beautiful blue sky up there you
