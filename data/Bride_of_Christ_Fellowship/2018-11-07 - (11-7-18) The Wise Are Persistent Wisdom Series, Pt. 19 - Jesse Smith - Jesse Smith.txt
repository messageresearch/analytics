feet here let's go right to the Word of God tonight by the grace of Lord let's go to proverbs I'm sorry please yeah seize upon me chapter 10 please please Marmee chapter 10 verse 17 please yesyes 1017 I like to just call this one part 19 like to call the wise are persistent I think it's very fitting amen the wise are persistent so please ask these 10 17 and 18 hopefully we'll get to chapter 9 and 10 8 9 and 10 perhaps but I like to take that for my text Ecclesiastes 10 17 and 18 by the grace of the Lord Thank You Lydia appreciate it blessed art Thou O land when the I King is the son of nobles and thy Prince's eat in due season for strength and not for drunkenness so Solomon saying the land is blessed when they have strong leaders because the next verse shows the opposite the next verse shows what a awful leader is verse 18 by much slothfulness the building decay off' and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through so in verse 17 we know strong leaders lead the people but verse 18 is the opposite that's what of course proverbs are and wisdom there's always a contrast the Proverbs does that repeatedly they'll contrast good and then show bad in the very next sentence or the next phrase and so here the opposite of persistent would be slothful and idle so being lazy and doing nothing how many want to be persistent for the kingdom of God well you're in the right place tonight amen let's have a word of Prayer let's bow our heads here Heavenly Father we've sung your songs or we're so happy to be walking up your Highway Lord God Lord our way gets brighter and our load gets lighter Lord walking up the Kings Highway how true it is we don't have to worry or be in a hurry Lord because we know everything is right on time and your economy Lord God your prophet said the rapture won't be one second too late or one second early everything is working right on time so father speak to us here tonight Lord God use thy word Lord Here I am M I posted Duty Lord each one of us at our posts of duty faithfully reporting for the kingdom of God's sake Lord God bless us through thy word lord thank you for the songs we felt blessed in your presence Lord God worshiping you for worship is calmly and Father now may we just feel you in the power of your presence through your word dear God let your wound discern our thoughts and tense Oh God and may it Lord God show us that you're here with us in Jesus Christ's name and everybody said amen god bless use me and see the praise God well let's go back to proverbs chapter I'm sorry Cleese asking Chapter II and I keep saying proverbs Ecclesiastes chapter eight verse nine I think we ended off with verse eight yeah left off at verse eight by God's grace so let's draw a little more wisdom by the grace of the Lord through this little series I appreciate I got a nice feedback from Sunday they were some people really enjoyed the message from Sunday so I thank the Lord for that and of course it's always a privilege when my mother-in-law is here she gets to hear the preaching of the word cuz you know she's never really asked any questions really about the message so the fact that I got to go over some of our basics I was really happy about that I'm just trusting that seeds were planted in her heart by God's grace so that always means a lot to me and then I called my mom and I told her I said you know I was downtown or how I said if yeah so I called my mom I said mom do you have any questions about the makeup let me know you know because I wanted to follow up you know I preached a little bit about that on Sunday I just want to follow up and see if she had any questions and so she didn't but that's okay God knows and it's okay if she doesn't have any questions because we know God has the answers amen and we'll just keep pressing on and trusting in the Lord please he's eight verse nine all this have I seen and applied to my heart unto every good work that is done under the Sun there's a time wearing one-man rule a--the over another to his own hurt so Solomon tried to see all the things that were done under the Sun and he saw one where a man ruled over people and it actually hurt him so I want to look at a few scriptures that will teach us that from the Word of God this reminded me of Luke chapter 12 Jesus tells a parable in Luke 12:45 and in this parable a man rule rules over others for his own hurt and not only hurts the people that he's ruling over but it hurts him in the end Luke 12:45 but if that servant say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to beat the menservants and the maids maidens and they eat and drink and to be drunken so this ruler he gets so convinced that well that my Lord's not coming back in other words the rapture is not going to be very soon he gets so idle that he starts beating his male and female servants and then he starts eating and drinking so much that he's getting drunk so he wants to escape the dahle of the hour right because he knows how my lord is not coming so he's like I might as well just beat up my servants I might as well get drunk because this is just such a boring time there's just such a time where we're not we're not expecting his return and so he's ruling over others to his hurt verse 46 the Lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him and an hour when he's not aware and will cut him asunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers so I'm happy to say tonight I'm looking for the coming of the Lord if I wasn't I wouldn't be here praise God amen so no matter the day no matter the hour we want to be looking for the coming of the Lord Luke in verse 47 and that servant which knew his Lord's will and church if anybody knows God's will it's the message believers and prepare not himself neither did according to his Will shall be beaten with many stripes for he that knew not and didn't commit things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes for whosoever much is given of him shall be much required and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask them all so God is going to ask us in the message he's going to ask more of us because we've heard more than other people so our devotion or art or our character how we treat others should be so careful we should always be acting like the Lord may come anytime and the way we'll know that we're we're feeling that way is how we treat one another praise God we won't beat each other up we will accuse falsely accuse one another we won't say evil things against one another we will be always treating each other with the utmost love and respect and we won't be overfilled with the things of the world we won't go to the world to be filled we'll go to the Holy Ghost to be filled amen because this preacher he started getting drunk with spirit which we say natural drink and said a spiritual drink he got so lazy that he just gave himself over instead of being filled with God's coming instead of being filled up with all Jesus may come back soon instead of being filled up with that he got filled up with the things of the world so we must make sure that our hearts are beginning filled up with the things of God so I hope we were spending more time worried about Jesus coming or concerned about Jesus coming then who won the elections last night amen it's more important to know that Jesus already won the election of your heart praise God amen and as long as he won that election that's all that matters praise God give your vote to Jesus that's all that matters because there's going to be more gridlock and more turmoil and more of the same very few things ever really change they just get more and more and more worse but thank God we voted for Jesus many years ago or maybe some of you even this year right hate right Kerris you voted for Jesus this year ain't my head so we got to keep casting our vote for Jesus and make sure we know and believe that he's coming anytime amen verse 9 I'm sorry verse 10 and so I saw the wicked buried who had come and gone from the place of the Holy and they were forgot in the city where they had done so this is also vanity right so faithful church members saw Solomon had seen faithful church members go in the holy city but then die and everybody forgets about him that's sad part of life verse 10 I'm sorry verse 11 now verse 11 is one of the best scriptures I've used for parenting it's one of the most helpful scriptures for parenting and also for teaching at school with 21 children then I got a tee at the Bible Club and 30 at the middle school this is the best thing for me to get control of these big crowds they say my friend asked me how can you control 80 kids this is it right here because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil what do you mean by that what I mean by that is when children misbehave I have them say that as they're sorry immediately or if they're talking what I'll do is I'll say okay go out and touch the door and come back in and try it again all over again or get out your paper you know write an apology note that a consequence must be right away now I know there's quotes her brother Branham says you know his mom would scare him and say your dad's gonna whip you when you get home and he said that was very effective with him so that can be very effective right oh well dad's gonna really have to lay into you when you get home that may be effective for some people we don't do really that at our house really but I do this at school and with my own children too to make sure they say sorry right away like we had a little argument before church upstairs between two of our children I had to make them say they're sorry right away see if you if you don't give a consequence if there's not a consequence then the children just learn to keep doing it but Solomon even in all his his back sin and condition he realized when there's rules that are broken that the the more Swift the consequences the better praise God amen especially for a wise person he's remembering the bots and the proverbs the Bible says if you rebuke a wise man he'll love you more amen hallelujah so see Christians don't mind being corrected as long as it's the Word of God and they want to be corrected they want to be corrected so that they can do the right thing as soon as possible that's right remember the Bible says do not let the Sun go down upon your wrath so if you've got something to get somebody or someone sinned against you it's best to go take care of it as soon as possible now verse 12 and 13 has a different theme this is encouraging to us who fear the Lord tonight verse 12 and 13 though a sinner do evil a hundred times in his days be prolonged yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God which fear before him amen verse 13 but it shall not be well with the wicked neither shall he prolong his days which are as a shadow because he fears not the Lord so their relationship with God will not be well because they don't fear the Lord but all relationship with God because we fear the Lord it will be well God will forgive us God will love us God will continue to take care of us because he said he never leave us nor forsake us now verse 14 there's a vanity which is done upon the earth that there be just men unto whom it happened if according to the work of the wicked again there been be wicked men to whom it happened at the court of the work of the righteousness I said that this also is vanity now the simple examples as we said sometimes bad things happen to good people and vice versa sometimes good things happen to bad people the two obvious cases are like job and the rich young ruler job does all good all perfect but then God wants to prove to Satan that there are people on this earth that will serve God just because they love God is true they men they love that God is the truth they love God's character and they know God is right and they know God is holy and they hate evil so God was proving to Satan that job serves me just because he loves me not because of what I do for him Amen hallelujah and so see bad things happen to job and as that's what Solomon is saying here sometimes I see that happen but then also the rich young ruler brother Branham said that that Satan prospered the rich young ruler I found of a quote from that from 1965 the rich young ruler turned down the highest calling in the Bible to be an apostle oppai he turned on the highest calling in church people today will turn down the highest calling as far as church goes which is being in the bride of Jesus Christ they'll turn that down for riches because remember the rich young ruler he feared losing his money more than he feared God he was more scared of losing his money and being poor than he was of having a prideful greedy heart and standing before God as a greedy person he feared losing money more than he feared God oh my and yet good things supposedly kept happening to him so Solomon said I noticed both what is it God has to have someone who will stand on every matter what the situation God needs a witness that everywhere every that where there will be a believer standing no matter what the circumstances no matter what the conditions God will have an overcomer in every circumstance amen just like me I've got to be an overcomer in every circumstance that God places me in just like you you need to overcome in every situation and circumstance because remember the Bible says all things are common unto men there's no temptation that has taken you except what's common to all men you're not the only one going through what you're going through other people have been through it before people are going through it right now if God Terry's people in the future will go through things that you and I are going through we must understand that these are all tests these are all trials but the Bible says in the end will come forth as silver and gold tried in the fire amen that's exactly right so Solomon says I see both I see good happen to bad I see bad happen to good and it shook him up a little bit verse 15 so Solomon again he goes back to this this is the theme of Solomon's life as a backslider he just he just chooses to focus on well I might as well enjoy my life I might as well see little things in my life as being gifts of God which they are we talked about that a few weeks ago all these things are gifts of God in our lives but this is what he keeps going back to verse 15 then I come mirth now mirth is gaiety or happiness then I commended mirth because a man hath no better thing under the Sun than to eat and to drink and and be merry now what about winning souls for Jesus or in that case what about winning souls verse 4 Jehovah what about getting people to the house of God so see we got to balance this out here remember he's a backslidden man and so all after he sees all these things he's wondering about all these things he said the best thing is that you eat and drink in other words eat drink and be merry for that shall abide with him of his labor that all the days of his life which God giveth him under the Sun now how many have seen it at Christmas time I see that Christmas time every year it's in the stores I think I've seen that Panero last year they have these signs eat drink and be merry one time they had like a cherry dessert and they said eat drink and eat cherry or something like that and that ridiculous we're gonna get that from Solomon but remember it's Scripture but you've got to understand what Solomon was going through he was in a Backson and condition remember we saw it last Sunday he said every man is just miserable because they know all their works are gonna come under judgment if you're really under the blood of Jesus Christ you have no fear on Judgment Day amen you're not going to be miserable a holy God because you know that holy God has forgiven you how do you know because he sent His Word he sent His presence he felt he sent his vindication he said everything to you and you had such a relationship with him you prayed enough you heard the Word of God enough you knew where you stood you listened to everything the Word of God said and you did it you know you where you stand with God and you don't have any doubts on Judgment Day but Solomon was not so he thought this is miserable we got to come under judgment and be judged for all the works we've done Under the Sun oh my so what does he praise he praises Gaiety he praises mirth eat drink and have some Cherry Coke or something like that he drink and be merry so how many know we gotta balance the scripture Church I think it was yeah it was remember Luke 17 where Jesus is describing memories describing the days of lot he says as it was in the days of lot he said where and they were eating drinking marrying giving him marriage right and then they went knew not until the flood waters came and then came the destruction that sounds very similar does it not and who's going to be the ones doing that the ones who are backslidden just like Solomon was back slidden and the only thing he sees in life is eat drink and be merry if that's the greatest hope we have in our lives if today eating drinking and being married just trying to act happy and have parties if that is the best thing of birthday parties or whatever kind of parties are the best things we have in life oh we're are very sad people in this hour but if our greatest ally is serving Jesus and worshipping Him and seeing the people of God gathered and feeling God's presence and worshiping him and loving him if that's our greatest desire then we're closer to heaven ain't ahead then we've got the right attitudes but this is Solomon's words here at this stage of his life brother Branham said with a quote he said the greatest joy on earth is winning a soul if you haven't won a soul he said that's the greatest thing he said you need to try to win a soul praise the Lord it's been a while for me I think I think there's been a few people on YouTube that said so but I would just maybe say Amen and hooah well trying to win souls you know thank God for that that God has helped us to try to win a soul and point them to Jesus Christ and there's no greater joy remember the Bible said there's no greater joy than to see your children walk in the truth now that can be both natural and spiritual children how many know that right but I just heard brother am saying today in Christ the mystery of God revealed he said oh how a pastor just loves to see and he was talking about his church he said all these of all these spiritual children you've given to me he said he said may you protect them Lord and may you be with them and he was praying for the people that one to the Lord there's no greater joy than to see soul save and live change to see live spiritually resurrected amen but Solomon saying eat drink and be merry that's really the best thing you can do is try to be happy try to have parties you know try to enjoy oh my so what we need church what we need especially with this Old Testament we kind of got to look through it through the lens of the New Testament so can I just put it back so we've kind of got a look at the Old Testament like this you've got to start from the New Testament and then look back to the old desk you have to filter all that through the New Testament so all of Solomon's words we have to filter through the New Testament it's exactly right now let's finish this chapter with 16 and 17 when I applied my heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done upon the earth for there for also there is that neither day nor night see asleep with his eyes then I beheld all the work of God that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the Sun because though a man labor to seek it out yet he shall not find it yayyyy farther though a wise man think to know it yet shall he not be able to find it you know I was listening to a blog cat was it blogcast is that how you say that podcast blog cast something like that and when there was a certain CEO I'm not gonna call names but there's a certain CEO that was bragging for a couple years about I only get four hours of sleep because remember what verse 16 said there's some of those that neared neither sleep day or night and they were bragging and having all you know I only get four hours sleep at night and and then they came to a very important meeting where they had potential clients and this the CEO fell asleep and missed out on some deals and eventually had to resign as CEO before the person got fired so now of course this person didn't you know go without sleep but they were boasting and bragging about the scripture about about how in verse 16 Lily can you put the 16 back up there how they they work so hard they needed very little sleep yes Osama had seen that in his day church there's nothing new Under the Sun some people fill their lives with work for natural things we got to fill our lives with serving Jesus Christ doing the work whether it's motherhood fatherhood going to school pastoring whatever the work is we've got to fill our lives with the work that God gave us to do daki right look at verse 17 then I beheld all the work of God that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the Sun because though a man labor to seek it out yet he shall not find it yeh farther though a wise man think to know it yet shall he not be able to know it now this is true church there's so many things in life that God doesn't let us know there's so many things we wonder well I don't know why this happened or I don't know why that happened but remember brother Aaron said the reward for the overcomer according to the church ages the reward for the overcomer in we're thinking the Philadelphia Church age was that they would be able to see what was hidden in the right white rock there would be a revelation which no man knew hidden in the white rock and so that was brother man was saying that shows that throughout all eternity God was going to be answering all of our unanswered questions on this side amen so on this side we have all these questions but on that side we'll have all the answers amen and brother Branham said this repeatedly brother Branham even talked about Elijah remember how the Shulamite woman said it's all's well all's well all is well when her when her little son died that Elijah gave her in the name of the Lord and the Bott for the Brotherhood the Bible says that that that Elijah didn't even know what was happening to the woman and brother Graham said see you know Elijah was surprised you know God doesn't always tell his prophets everything that's going to happen he looked up and seen her coming he said here comes that shunammite he and he and said she's full of sorrow but God had it's hid it from me and he told his servant run and go meet her amen Rotom says this he says I'm 48 years old I've seen vision since I was about 18 months old that's right just a baby and I've never seen it one time fail and it won't it can't now I can't make him show me anything you know we say oh well it must be easier for brother branham you know it was a lot easier for him because God showed him a lot more well brother Ram said that only made him more accountable to God so the more you see the more you God shows you the more responsible you have to be with that my brother have said even though I'm a prophet I can't make God show me anything he doesn't show me according to my desire he shows me according to what his will is how many believe that a list of this he's been praying for Lord will you just tell me how we'll come out so I can comfort the people my brother man said he'll never say a word to me about it I'm gonna read that again many things have I prayed for Lord will you just tell me how it will come out so I can comfort the people he never say a word to me about it how many appreciate that how many have how many of you have any things and God just didn't answer now that's why we rejoice Church when God does answer that's why you'll see us you'll hear me shout out or braise it harder I'll clap and I'll say hallelujah that's all per say praise the Lord that's right we rejoice when God does answer because Rhoda have said many times I ask for a word for the people and he doesn't answer me well Ram says he'll turn around and tell me something else but he tells me what he wants me to know he's my father and what he wants me to know why he tells me ain't none of my business that's his business to see as much as as much as I want to know the business of God I've got to be humble enough to say well Lord if you don't tell me that's okay that's your business that's none of my business how's he gonna all turn out Lord how how's things with my family going to turn out how's things with my loved ones if you could just give me a sign how are things going to turn out at the church is this person going to come back is this person going to get saved Lord would you give me something to help comfort this family the church and if the Lord says no then we have to say Lord that's none of my business that's your business you see that shows it doesn't lay in a man it's in God these are just gifts in other words we cannot trust in our gifts that we see amongst each other we can't trust an even a brother branham's gift for all the answers is what I'm saying we could only lean upon God we must trust God we must not put our overconfidence in men and women and gifts and all these things like that we've ultimately got to have full confidence and trust in Jesus Christ that ain't my business that's his business praise God so I thought that'd fit real well with verse 17 there's so many things a wise man don't think to know it yet he should not be able to find it out there's many things we're not going to be able to find out although we tell God Lord I desire this Lord I ask that you do this lord please minister here please do this please give me a word please give me something to help this person if we get no answer we've just got to say well the Lord gives and the Lord takes away that's how that would be up to God praise God chapter 9 perhaps we'll finish chapter 9 tonight here please ask these nine verse one I like to just read verse one and just make a few comments on verse 1 for all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of God no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them so see the Bible says the righteous the wise all their works are in the hand of God how many know your lives are in God's hands remember Ephesians 2:10 I'm just gonna read that again I'm gonna be preaching that Lord willing a little more on the purpose series I've got a lot of thoughts for that I'm just kind of wait until I finish these other thoughts I would like to really finish a series before moving on seasons 2:10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath bought before ordained that we should walk in them alright so the Bible said all our works are in the hand of God oh I'm so glad to know that that God has everything for me re in his hand he's not got to reach out and grab it and say well I better do this I better change that or maybe I'll swap this out for that I've got to have conference that everything God wants me to do is already in his plan for my life amen it's in his hand Church praise God thank the Lord the Bible says even the sinner is made for the day of destruction in the Proverbs even the works of sinners are in the hands of verse two and three I'll make some comments on two and three all things come alike to all there's one event to the righteous and to the wicked to the good in to the clean to the I'm sorry to the good to the clean and to the unclean to their sacrifices and him that sacrifice is not as is the good so is the sinner and he that sweareth as he that feareth and oath this is an evil among all things that are done under the Sun that there is no I'm sorry there's one event unto all of course death yeah also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil and madness is in their heart while they live and after that they go to the dead praise God so all people die except those few lucky Usher's they lucky except those few elected ones praise God Enoch amen Elijah praise God very few that actually cheat death we'd say or miss death thank God die other than those elected ones and the hearts of the evil are full of wickedness and madness so remember church all these things happen all temptation is common to all man we must not give place to the devil we must in this case we must not have ourselves a pity party and we must not feel sorry for ourselves as we said earlier there are others who have suffered the same as us and then there are so many others who've suffered more than us that's exactly right the same events happen to us all all temptation is common to all men exactly right verse 4 through 6 for him that is joined to all the living there's hope for a living dog is better than a dead lion verse five for the living no not that they shall die but the dead know not anything neither have they any more a reward for the memory of them is forgotten also their love and their hatred and their Envy is now perished neither have they any more a portion for heaven I'm sorry for ever and anything that is done under the Sun I want to make a few comments here to kind of balance this out I feel this is a little imbalanced here now the statement the dead know not anything is an interesting statement because I'm not sure on this some people believe that those people in heaven see what's going on right now and there seem to be some people who say that you know brother Branham said theophanies are around us all the time that's possible I personally have not seen any quotes on that like some people say brother Branham said you know you know my grandmother's here or or your mother's here in the room right now I don't know about that all I see in the Bible is that there's angels among us I do see that but I don't know if it's someone else's Ange or someone else's theophany I don't know about that I can't really prove that by scripture at this point of my my spiritual journey but I do want to say this remember the souls under the altar that he knew they knew that they'd been killed unjustly and they were crying out for revenge and brother Brandon tells us that you know Sharon Rose was waiting for Billy Paul right and remember the dream when brother man went beyond the curtain of time he said you know I'm waiting for Billy Paul she said I'm gonna go wait down for Billy Paul at the gate and so they were waiting so it seemed as if they knew something but I don't know you know the Bible says in Hebrews 12:1 that there's a great cloud of witnesses in heaven now I don't know if they're witnessing what's going on earth I don't know about that so I can't say that but I can say this there is a cloud of witnesses which would be testimonies that are witnessed to us from those who have already gone to heaven in other words if you look up - if we know all the Saints that have lived on the earth have lived such godly lives that their testimonies are like clouds above us in other words also got to do is get our eyes on heaven amen and think about all the testimonies of all these saints who have gone before us amen when we get discouraged when we think about being sick or having symptoms we've got to look to the clouds of heaven and remember that Jonah was a witness and mother madam says no one has ever been as sick as Jonah no one's ever had as many symptoms as Jonah had so that ought to encourage us that ought to be a cloud of a witness in heaven if we've ever been sick or discouraged we can look up to heaven to remember there's been people who've been more sick than we were and if God delivered Jonah God can deliver us amen hallelujah it's exactly right we got to remember there's a great cloud of witnesses there's heavenly testimonies of believers and have gone on to heaven before us and we should take courage from their testimonies that's exactly right glory amen hallelujah so it seems like Solomon saying the dead can't change anything and that's right the Bible said men live and then they die and then go to the judgment they wait for judgment we know but we know sinners wait in the prison house they wait there the souls that are in prison the Bible said they go to wait there for judgment but they're tormented while they're awaiting judgment we know that and at least there's hope for those who are alive thank God for that now it's reverse is 7 through 10 Solomon again tells us to live joyfully Ecclesiastes 9 7 to 10 go thy way eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a merry heart for God now accepteth thy works let thy garments be always white and let thy head lack no I meant live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity which he hath given thee under the all the days of thy vanity for that is thy portion in this life and in that labor which thou take us under the Sun verse 10 whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might where there's no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest now this has been an encouraging Scripture but before I get to that one so psalmist saying treat life as precious treat days as joyful love your wife or loved your husband work as hard as you can and balance work with pleasure in other words balance work with family time and verse 10 kind of ties in with my topic for tonight the wise are persistent praise God so verse 10 whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with all thy might for there's no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest brother Ram said we must work while it is day because the night cometh a man there's going to be a time where we cannot work anymore whether we go to the grave or or whatever happens there's going to be a time we can't add any more to our testimony so we must work while there is life today praise God we must work while we have an opportunity if I'm a teacher I should work as hard as I possibly can as a teacher but yet at the same time not rob my family from the ministry I must give my family and that's and God knows my heart I try to do that every day so I'm not most days I'm extremely from trying to put everything I possibly can all my might into the job and I got to come home I got to try to put all my might into being a family man and a pastor amen so the last two weeks I've been so concerned about that me get up at 4:30 every morning the last few weeks by God's grace to try to get some some more done with all my might the Bible says we must work with all our might how many one will work with all their might amen the lies are persistent and we'll get to that in just a moment now verse 11 this ought to be a word of encouragement I returned and saw Under the Sun that the race is not to the Swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to men of understanding nor yet favor to men of skill but time and chance happeneth to them all in other words God has a specific testimony for each life every life is different just because someone's the strongest doesn't mean they're always going to succeed just because someone's the poorest isn't always gonna mean they're gonna remain poor right so time it the gods time and God's plan happens to everybody praise God because we know Church there's Noth there there's no such thing as chance with God right right the Bible says God knows our beginning from the end the Bible says he knows the beginning from the end so we asked after understand this the right way God knew what happened to us last year God knew what happened to us as a child God knows what's going to happen tomorrow praise God God knows what's gonna happen in five years of God Terry's there's no such thing as chance but there is the the thing where God will change people's lives and he'll do certain things to different people different things happen to us all but we've all got to give God all of our mites while we have the chance we got to serve God with all we have amen I've got a priest with all I have tonight because this might be the last time I pray amen this might be the last time you step your foot in a church we've got to give all of it because we know there's different rings there's different testimonies there's different testimonies that people have we've got to make sure we give all that we have to God because we never know in our time may end hallelujah we are governed by God's timing not by our own God governs all things no matter how capable we are how strong we are God's will must be done we cannot control events how many know that you cannot control the events it's all in God's hand we've got to do all we can do for God while God has given us this time Oh amen I'm happy to do it hallelujah verse 12 for men also knoweth not as time as the fishes that are taking an evil net and as the birds that are caught in the snare so are the sons of men snared in the evil time when it falls suddenly upon them amen all right so see there sometimes people die quickly and it's unexpected they just die and the Bible said it falls suddenly upon them no members now I was surprised at God what's this surprise to us I'll never forget when we went to church in Lima brother Brooks's church and he was our pastor they had a missionary I forget which country was from but this was a missionary and he lived in some remote area up on a mountain I think it was maybe the Philippines or something like that and his children he had numerous children they just got old enough where his children were playing drums and then the church and his sons were as his his sons were playing drums and and the song leaders and then an awful event happened he said his sons were they were old enough to drive they were driving down the mountain and a rockslide came and just they lost him he lost his sons so he lost his whole church family or his whole church band because his sons did the drums they did the piano they did everything and he's telling this testimony and people are just weeping and he's weeping and crying and his sermon was called God's grace is sufficient for me in weakness can you imagine me in a pastor of a church he's he left the United States to start a church in the Philippines where ever was he just gets his church going to where it's going well as his family's in the band and God allows a rock slide to come and I found out later cuz brother Brooks and I were talking I found out later that he took that message around to all these churches and it was in America and was such an encouragement to people who had hard times in their lives so God let this man this mission heir and his wife struggle and suffer and lose their children in order to come around and give their testimony to comfort people who had lost loved ones that could not been comforted before that Amen isn't that just like God and I think that's even Scripture off to look up the scripture but I know there's some scripture about how how there's only people the only way you can be comforted is by someone who's gone through something that you've gone through that's the only way you can be comforted is by somebody who's already been gone through that and thank God that Jesus went through the most awful wicked persecution that could ever be given and if we ever feel discouraged we must remember that Jesus has gone through it all jesus paid it all all to him I owe amen and if he suffered awful if he went through the most awful suffering there could ever been through that I know at least Jesus can understand my situation amen that made me think of that story there these things happen to all people we're not guaranteed oh good happy times all the time we've got to remember that these things happen but it's God's Way it's God's will it's God's plan God's trying to get a testimony out of our lives verse 13 now read 13 down the end the chapter and I think we'll finish chapter 9 here this wisdom have I seen also under the Sun and it seemeth great unto me there was a little city and a few men within it and there came a great King against it and the besieged and built great bulwarks against it now there was found in it a poor wise man and he by his wisdom delivered the city yet no man remembered that same poor man then said I wisdom is better than strength nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heard that was my text from Sunday that's where I thought I'd get to I thought I'd get to that on Sunday I didn't get to that on Sunday the words of a wise men are heard and quiet more than the cry of him that rule among fools wisdom is better than weapons of war but one sinner destroy earth much good all right now I want to bring this point out from the scripture wise words are heard more and quiet among a little flock or amongst lesser people huh me know that when Elijah ran away from a Jezebel how many know that the storm and the lightning and the Thunder that did not attract Elijah how many know that Elijah never left the cave when he heard fire and thunder and lightning Elijah never left the cave that's not what drew him out what drew him out was this still small voice of God and that's what the Bible says here the wise words are heard more and quiet than in loudness with many people in other words you are gonna have your best times with God in quiet times you're gonna hear the voice of God when you're quietly fellowshipping with God amen that's what the word says it's those quiet times when you're really able to listen now don't get me wrong we all love to shout and rejoice I love to shout and say Amen and praise the Lord and that's such an encouragement to us and many times but think about that when you've been your lowest when you've been down and discouraged and you're feel like you're all by yourself those are the times when God will speak to you praise the Lord kind of like tonight right it's not the loudest services not the most people here I can't hear really any screaming or crying or I can't hear much clapping or anything like that but in quiet times the Bible said the words of the wise are heard more in quiet times so those are times you really gotta listen when it's quiet remember all those other noises didn't draw a line out now you got the balance of two because remember when God spoke on Mount Sinai remember he was the Bible so there was lightning and thunderings and God was speaking to Moses up there right he got the law we have to balance this out Solomon just noticed I saw more words of wise people amongst quiet little group and is that true especially last night with all the election stuff how many saw the I didn't see him but I heard about all the rallies last night right they have the after election rallies right the victory speeches and there's so much blah blah blah we're gonna change America that tell me it's so quiet here tonight church which gathering has more wisdom it's the democratic or Republican rally last night where they're just spewing out the same old things or is it this assembly here tonight which one has more wise words I think God vote for this one tonight won't you that's what the Word of God says and isn't it foolish how they just they care so much about politics like program said they're trying to get a man to the moon or they're trying to get them to do all these things brother Hansen we're trying to get people to heaven right we've got a greater objective tonight to get people to heaven to get people filled with the Holy Ghost to get them baptized and sanctified and filled and yet it's some smaller group instead of the fools that are excited about other things and the Word of God right in other words another way look at this is words of wisdom are more effective than brutality right many times it's more effective to give words of wisdom than to be brutal and yell and scream like remember in Proverbs the Bible says a soft answer turns away wrath have you seen that lately instead of getting mad and screaming and yelling you just give a soft rebuke that you ought to see more effect to that the Bible says that and then the after ends by saying one single mistake does more damage to nullify the works of wisdom think about David one let me say this one hour of lust and passion for your eyes wife ruin the rest of his is ruling one Act one moment he was doing so good Church he was almost undefeated up to that time he was I think he was 50 years old when that happened 53 something like that he was almost undefeated he was almost invincible but one weak moment like the Bible says him at the end of verse nine one sinner destroy Earth much good and then you know the story his own son kicked him out and then he's weeping leaving remember he's leaving Jerusalem and one of those remember when those old men spits on David remember that and one of his guards comes up and lacy said let me cut off that dead dog's head and David was so humbled he said don't you know God told him to do that and brother Ram tells that story and Christ the mystery of God revealed brother Ram was getting criticized by brother by preachers and leave al said let me argue with him let me straighten them out and brother Adam said don't you know God's letting them do that to me I don't know when was last time you got criticized I don't know when the last time somebody was talking bad about you but we've got to consider there's some times where God is letting us get criticized there sometimes God is letting this happen for a purpose perhaps for humility or perhaps for chase chastisement because we did something wrong brother Ram saw it brother Ram you can listen to in Christ a mystery lament Owsley veil that God is letting them do this God setting these preachers speak evil about me just like God that that old man spit on David now that's not always shouting preaching is it nobody likes to say yes have somebody spit on me or criticize me yes preach it brother nobody says that but yet that's what we see this is a possibility we can do so many good things and then one mistake will ruin all that good let me know may God help us church to live faithfully before the Lord help may we have a testimony like brother Branham into this to this extent may our only thought be bragging too much on Jesus and then that's not even a fault amen she said you dragged too much on Jesus but as I said I hope that's all I've got to answer for on that day amen and if we're under the blood that will be all we have to answer for that day because everything else has been washed because there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus now there is one time though brother Branham did say that he failed remember when he went remember in South Africa and he went with the ministers he went with the denominational schedule rather than obeying the angel the angel Lord brother told brother Branham if you would have obeyed me I would have given you the whole country of South Africa remember that does anyone remember that he lost the reward of having even more influence over a nation because of one mistake saying okay I'll go with the preacher schedule rather than following the ange of the Lord the same thing happened to saw member Saul Saul was told by Samuel Samuel said wait until I get there to sacrifice I remember that but because the enemy was coming in and Saul just couldn't wait any more he went ahead and did the sacrifice and then Samuel said because you've done this he said your family will not have the kingdom of God forever had you waited your sons and your your family would have had the throne forever I remember that one mistake can undo all the good that was done before it oh my prayers Jesus keep me near the cross my prayers to be different that a little bit a little bit different than David instead of going out to battle he took a little vacation my desires lord help me to stay in the battle in other words help me to stay in prayer and reading the word and continually looking for the coming of the Lord amen help me not be like that man serving that was beating his maid servants and getting drunk and and not expecting the Lord to come in other words lord help me always expect that you're coming in my day amen Gloria if only he and waited upon the Lord if only Saul could have held on a little longer if only David would have went out and fought with the rest of the kings rather than staying back and not fighting the good fight of faith if only brother Branham had gone out and gone with the angel of the Lord schedule rather than the denominational brothers now you can put your name in there if only Jesse Smith had done that but my prayers God help us not to fall short of your glory there was a scripture I thought I wanted to read here oh yeah it's very next one okay so the same thought now let's go to chapter 10 the same thought is continued in chapter 10 verse 1 that's right that's what I was thinking of please a season 10 verse 1 dead flies cause the ointment of the pocke theory to send forth a stinking savour so death a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honor amen my that reminds us of David doesn't it one little mistake ruin that beautiful testimony that he had one little mistake I'll tell the kind of a gross story here but a few weeks ago I was out of it I was getting a cup of coffee and I just made a fresh cup of coffee and I pulled it over here and inside I saw a stink bug in my coffee one little thing bug ruins the whole coffee right and this is what this is saying one little fly ruins the whole event can I say like this one person's sin in the church ruins the move of the Holy Ghost one spot of 11 will ruin the unleavened lump is that right remember that woman from the fourth parable Jesus told in Matthew 13 the Bible says she hid a leaven in three measures of meal until the whole thing was corrupted see what's saying see we know we're doing wrong when we have to hide our sins from people we know that's going to turn that's gonna ruin the rest of our day or the rest of our week or the rest of our month or year it's gonna ruin any sin we don't confess and get it out from our lives is gonna ruin the rest until we get it out of our lives one little 11 will leaven the whole thing that's so true look at verse 2 a wise man's heart is as his right hand but a foolish heart at his left let me see where am I going to okay I'm trying to get to verse 18 all right oh my let's keep going verse okay oh yeah I heard a joke about this okay I'm not gonna say that it's a political joke I'm not gonna say verse 3 yeah also when he that is a fool walketh by the way his wisdom faileth him and he said to everyone that he is a fool so see people know you're a fool or know if you're wise right away by the things that you say people say oh that person's wise or that person to fool in other words your life speaks louder than your words right your life speaks louder than anything you can say out of your mouth verse four if the Spirit of the ruler rise up against thee leave not thy place for yielding pacify great offences alright verse five now I wanted to do actually verse four now so this is the scripture about dealing with rulers a person must maintain self-control or show wisdom when they're dealing with someone a superior that's angry with them they must show wisdom and self-control verses five to seven there's an evil which I've seen under the Sun as an heir which proceedeth from the ruler folly is set in great dignity and the rich sit in a low place verse seven I have seen servants upon horses and princes walking as servants upon the earth now doesn't this remind you of Mordechai church and there the first thing I wrote down when I read that remind me of Mordecai Mordecai was just a servant but member he saved King Ahasuerus his life and then for one moment member the King wanted to honor him so the king took the servant and he put him up on a horse I remember that and then Amon had to poem wasn't naming Haman Haman had to pull him through and that must have burned up Haman's havens of pride oh here's the man the King delights to honor everybody clapped for him and he wouldn't bow to me and he was just eating him alive so see God just like Salman thought there's people that are servants that deserve to be ruling let me say like this there's many humble Christians that are the lowest of the low today but they deserve to be ruling and so Christ will make them rulers like we saw over 10 cities in the New Jerusalem a head hallelujah but there's people that are ruling that don't deserve to be ruling and we can all name politicians that are like that right they are ruling but they don't deserve because they don't have the character that they ought to have and then remember what Mordechai do he was so humble he just Africa off that horse he just went back right to ruling again took his position but it wasn't long right - the Queen interceded she fasted and prayed she went before the king she had two wine banquets which is Holy Ghost anointing which is the former lane rain and latter aid amen and then after that everything was changed right Haman was done away with Mordecai was brought in which he typed the 144,000 and instead of being a servant now he finally got exalted as a ruler praise God he got new garments he got a crown a ring he got a signet ring all these things but it was after the bride interceded it was after the bride came out of her closet and that's what we're doing we're coming out of the closet amen hallelujah and then the rapture will fully be out of that closet ain't nin thank God for that that's right Church now verse 89 we're almost there I'm trying to get to 18 verse 89 he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and whoso break up in hedge a serpent shall bind now that's just like Haman right he built the gallows but what he hung he built the gallows for Mordecai but he was hung in the gallows himself right it's like people who gossip they gossip to make somebody else look bad but really it only affects them it always come backs on them because whatever you reap that's what you sow so whatever you sow I'm sorry that's what you reap parmie verse 9 whosoever remove a stone shall be hurt with their with and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby now see both criminal work and honest work can destroy a person Solomon says so he must trust in God for safety that's what Solomon says how many pray how many pray every time you get on the road right how many pray every time you travel somewhere or fly on a plane I hope you pray when you get on a plane or get in a car especially actually it's more safe in a plane that is in a car according to statistics so we must trust God for our safety that's verse 8 9 now verse 10 11 wisdom must be timely in verses 10 and 11 if the ayran be blunt and he do know what that do not wet the edge then must he put to more strength but wisdom is profitable to direct verse 11 surely the serpent will bite without enchantment and a babbler is no better so see church wisdom makes success easier to obtain if you sharpen your sword it's going to work better it's probably gonna work better and that's what the scripture is saying if you make wise decisions it's going to be easier to have success but it must be applied at the right time you must choose the right timing in order to do something wise timely wisdom directs your life how many know that you must make the right decision at the right time or else you might miss the opportunity there's been certain people you know that we've known that that said oh I you know they had a business opportunity presented to them and then they didn't and maybe they didn't pray about long enough or not you know I don't want to give too many details man but maybe didn't pray about long enough but they miss an opportunity and and it came back later that they wish they would have done something with a certain up with a certain business opportunity or maybe a job opportunity or maybe it was a relationship oh I wish I would have prayed more before doing this or I wish you would have prayed more and done that or maybe was with the church I wish I would have prayed more about that church or something like that so wisdom timely wisdom directs your life and we must look for God's leadership in each situation that's why we should pray about every decision pray about it before you make a quick decision brother Ram said pray about everything he said God will answer you if you just pray about it verse 12 almost there the words wise man's mouth our gracious Amen but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself thirteen the big the words of his mouth as foolishness and the end of his talk is mischievous madness now that's talking about a fool he starts evil and he ends evil verse 14 a fool is also full of words a man cannot tell what he shall be in what shall be after him who can tell him the labor of the foolish weareth every one of them because he knoweth not how to go to the city all right so these scriptures all about wise men are gracious but fools have too many words now it says the directions of a fool we're ease you because he doesn't know the way to the city he's guessing a church that's what we don't want to do in this life we don't want to guess on what we should do for God we don't want to guess on things in our family we don't want to guess on things in the church we want to know exactly what the Word of God says about it and program said that's my job as a pastor my job as a pastor is to tell you what's in the Word of God amen well Graham said the gifts of the Spirit are to tell you things that are not written in the Word of God that's exactly right but the pastor's job is to tell you what's in the Word of God verse 16 and 17 almost there in these scriptures leaders often determine your success the leaders verse 16 woe to the O land when thy King is a child and thy Prince's eat in the morning to see whoa woe to you if you have a child leader someone who's not really training the Word of God look at that spiritually verse 17 and this was our text - blessed art Thou O land when that king is the Sun of nobles and thy Prince's eat in due season for strength and not for drunkenness this is why the Bible says a passer cannot be a novice it can't be somebody who just got saved because they don't know how to rule they haven't lived a godly Christian life they're probably not up all the steps of the statute of perfect man so how can they lead you if they haven't walked those steps already amen praise God that's why I thank God when God called me I was already a deacon I was already preaching for a while brother Brooke saw that he saw the the godly character of me that I'd walked up the king's highway amen and so your name me as a deacon and ordained me to preach and then he ordained me to pastor so see leaders often determine the success that we have verse 18 let me I'm gonna try to end up with this here yeah it goes with this here by much slothfulness the building decay a--the and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through a feast is made for laughter and wine maketh merry but money answereth all things curse not the king no not in thy thought and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber for a bird of the air shall carry the voice and that which hath wings shall tell the matter look at verse 18 let's go back up to that as we're finished here a building decays because people are slothful maokai we kind of talked about that last night a building decays because the people are lazy like we were talking about it which store would you in a shop at the one that's falling apart would you want to come to this church if these ceiling tiles are falling in probably not now it's different if we don't have the money to do it but if we have the money to do it we should take care of what we got right so this is the the the principle that God is is giving us here if we're slothful things fall apart they rot and decay now this happens in marriages all the time this is why there's divorces all the time people don't take care of their marriage right they don't invest in their marriage they don't time they don't take time to love and talk and forgive with their husbands and wives so the family decays it rots and it dies and then divorces happen they're slothful they're lazy instead of talking about the problems they joke about the problems or they ignore the problems this is why finances fall apart people are slothful with finances or not keeping track of all their finances anything that falls apart many of the times it falls apart because people don't take enough time to take care of it relationships like we said finances churches buildings they don't take the time search we can't let things go we can't let responsibilities go that we know we've got to take care of we've got to focus on them we've got to force ourselves to keep our responsibilities amen exactly right I don't think any of you want your relationships to fall apart do you you don't want your finances to fall apart we don't want this church to fall apart if this church starts falling apart somebody let me know we got to get something got to get some new drywall or what what we got to do we can't let things fall apart because Malachi and I saw a place last night it's literally falling apart right Malachi it's literally you know in the bathroom that the tiles falling apart it's just for the things just look like they're falling apart we can't be slothful we've got to be diligent and as our title is the lies are persistent the whys keep working the lies know what they're called to do so they don't quit they don't get slothful they don't get idle and do nothing they just don't sit back and try to relax they have a work and they know what they're called to do how many know what they're called to do let me read these closes we're closed let's stand to our feet let me read these from brother Branham brother Branham said Jesus was criticized from the time he was a baby until the time he died on the cross did it stop him no sir what was his goal always do that which pleased the father so Jesus always had a goal so he wasn't slothful and he his spiritual life didn't decay and he didn't miss the will of God his only goal was I always do that which pleased the father now how many one that kind of a goal my goodness hey I don't know if that can be our goal tonight we just want a service that pleases God tonight I just want to sing a song that pleases god I just want to preach a sermon that priest pleases God I just want to here's a message and apply to my life that pleases God amen that's his goal was to always please God but the RAM said the word perseverance means to be persistent and persistent in making a goal or doing something every man in all ages that's ever made anything out of themselves or done anything would be persistent in the thing they were trying to achieve and before you can be persistent you have to have faith in what you're trying to achieve if you haven't got faith in what you're trying to do you will never be able to do it amen so see what happens first church first you have to have faith and what is faith faith is a revelation help me know that first God has to reveal to you what you have to do and then you have to set your goal to it for example like brother Branham and remember 1962 brother Branham had a dream or a vision about store up tapes at the tabernacle so what did he do he turned down the invitations to go preach and he stayed at home he had a goal right until the end of 62 when he had that dream or he had the dream and the voice told him to go move out west so he he kept the will of God he did what he was supposed to do until God moved into the next thing he had a goal and he had to keep his eyes on the goal until he achieved the goal that's right brother Ram set as he says what are you drifting for anyone ever feel like they're just drifting through life I'm not sure where I'm going not sure what I'm doing not sure what I'm supposed to be doing I drift from this I drift of that brother madam says you're going somewhere how many people are going somewhere tonight what are you drifting for get some ambition about you set your goal on Christ and he says quit tallying with the world hallelujah praise God amen that's beautiful we got to set our goal on Jesus Christ the word ha thank you Lord what's our goal church what's your goal let's Comerica come here to the piano just play that song pleasing I want to be pleasing what's your goal tonight Church that's where as I was studying preparing and praying this morning that's kind of thought I had the wise are persistent each one of us have to have a goal and I found this to be true I don't have my my planner but I bought a planner and for the last year I've been writing off my goals for every day and I have never felt so focused in all my life in fact it was called the full focused planner that I bought but I'll be honest I I never was more focused in my life than I feel like this last year and you know what you know what writing it you know what the secret to writing it out is it causes you to meditate when you've got a pen and you've got a paper and you start writing out what your goals are for the next day or that day it forces you to meditate on things it causes you to focus it makes you stop where there's so many distractions of things going on sitting it down alone and writing out things makes you meditate upon them [Music] brother branham said I like somebody who has an admission in their life in other words they have a goal I'm trying to achieve this how many want to be that kind of person I do I don't want to get up and say well what are what's gonna happen today wonder what I should be doing today I want to know God's leading before I start the day praise God I want to know what I feel that to do and that only comes through prayer prayer reading the word hearing the voice of God don't you like to hear the voice of God in quietness you got to get quiet with God this has been quite night to hear God's voice glory oh I'm so thankful for the voice of my Savior the voice of Jesus Christ let's just pray Heavenly Father we thank you Lord that your son had a goal always do that which please to the father and your prophet told us Lord not to drift but to get some ambition about us to set our goal on Christ well I just pray you to show to each person tonight those here those listening and Lord I just of course pray for all those in our church who are members of our church by the baptism of the Spirit because we don't believe in natural membership by letter or paper or signing a book I just pray that each one in our church dear God would have some ambition and set their goal on Christ and quit tattling with the world if their dowling in the things of the world granite Lord Jesus the wisdom are wise they're not going to let their spiritual lives decay they're not gonna let their family life or their marriages the cave they're not gonna let their finances decay and rot away and avoid responsibilities they're gonna have ambitions they're gonna know what they need to get done to glorify God because they know the Bible says whatever you find and do do it with all your mind and the New Testament says the same do it with all your heart do it heartily as unto the Lord help us to be the best parents we can meet the best students we can meet the best teachers we can be the mesh workers we can be the best grandparents we can be the best brother and sister we can be help us to do all that we can with all of our nights while we can work for time and chance happen to us all we know there's no chance with you but to us it seems like time and chance because we can't predict everything we don't know everything we need your help your gut help us to have that goal we'll always do that which pleases Christ help us to have ambition help us to meditate on what you called us to do and bring our bodies into subjection to achieve those purposes in Jesus Christ name Church said amen praise God thank the Lord oh I'm so glad my goal is Jesus Christ that's my goal I know what my ambition is it's to please the father is to do what the father has asked me to do did you know brother Adam said his his goal in life for his calling in life was to pray for sick people he knew what he was supposed to do that's why he drive around and sometimes he'd be late for church now I don't recommend that for us unless you're called to pray for the sick but it was so his burden he would be late for church on prayer calls because the angel told him you were born to pray for sick people Oh God god help us to know what we were born for he meant what was I born to do and then once he shows it to me I better do with all my heart amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] they need prayer tonight my god fix it when he pray for anyone he's Perry Morgan will come up here country let's see that again by God's grace let me [Music] my lord senior year [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey Pat praise God you know the word ambition here's what it means to have an ardent desire to desire to achieve a particular end a desire for activity or exertion in other words and if one person I could ever say I met that had ambition with John brain he would always say I just want to do something for the Lord I just want to do something for the little part that's ambition whether Ram says having an ambition he says set your goal on Christ that's why I get up at 4:30 I've got to get these videos done I got to get that book done well I gotta get another book I've got to do something cuz I get emails from all over the world saying thank keep up the videos I just got a phone call this week keep up the videos cuz I need strength I'm over here in the UK there's no church I need strength that made me almost cry there when I got that there's people that need your help there's people that need my help I want to have a mission I want to help others I want to do something for the kingdom of God and church it can be as simple as taking care of these little ones God give me a better ambition give me more ambition to take care of these little ones hey give me a more of ambition to take care of my class to show them more love for Jesus Christ it give me that simple but Lord give me a ardent desire to do something for your kingdom let's pray for our sister [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] and we time has surrendered is our simply to do
