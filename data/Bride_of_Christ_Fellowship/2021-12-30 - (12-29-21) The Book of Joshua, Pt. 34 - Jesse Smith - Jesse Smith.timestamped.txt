[12:42] could if you'd like to do that let me
[12:44] know i would love to do that with you
[12:45] and
[12:46] have the lord's supper together
[12:49] let's just remember stephen and
[12:50] elizabeth as their wedding approaches
[12:52] january 8th i did receive a text from
[12:55] stephen this week he said he's no longer
[12:56] going to be able to come to our church
[12:58] he got a job
[13:00] kind of on the other side of the state
[13:01] near where his wife lives
[13:04] so i don't know when the next time is
[13:05] we'll see him but i just want to
[13:06] announce that that
[13:07] uh he's moving on and uh but we are so
[13:10] glad for having these last two years or
[13:12] so
[13:13] and he was a real good brother i just
[13:15] loved how he opened up more and more to
[13:16] us you know
[13:18] and uh church there were so many times i
[13:19] was preaching and he'd be sitting there
[13:20] just like crying in his seat you know
[13:22] you wouldn't see it you know because you
[13:24] wouldn't notice that right because he
[13:26] wouldn't be like louder like one of you
[13:27] or i or something like that mainly me
[13:29] you know the big cry baby
[13:32] but
[13:33] he just had a real love for the lord and
[13:35] uh we were just so thankful for the time
[13:38] that we had with him
[13:39] and let's just pray that god will bless
[13:41] he and elizabeth as they enter into
[13:43] their marriage
[13:44] and we're so thankful for
[13:46] that also i did put on a new youtube
[13:49] video i think yesterday so uh it's going
[13:52] pretty good and i did have a testimony
[13:54] someone watched my uh video about joseph
[13:56] branham and got delivered out of that
[13:59] false system
[14:01] so we can thank the lord for that praise
[14:02] god amen
[14:05] that that means the world to us you know
[14:08] when we can have a little part in
[14:09] someone's deliverance from a false
[14:11] doctrine because we know those are
[14:13] doctrines of devils
[14:15] you know exalting every word our prophet
[14:17] said to infallibility we're thankful
[14:20] when god delivers people from that so

[18:00] chapter 23 i'd like to continue on this
[18:02] and i think lord willing will finish
[18:03] this
[18:04] book
[18:05] this weekend by god's grace
[18:08] hard to believe we started that in
[18:10] february
[18:11] and here we are in december
[18:13] trying to bring a conclusion to this
[18:16] series here what a blessing part 36 here
[18:18] tonight
[18:19] by the grace of the lord i do have some
[18:21] slides here so
[18:23] whenever we do the text you can
[18:26] switch over so it's joshua 23 let's just
[18:29] read verses 1 2 and 3.
[18:35] joshua 23 1-3
[18:51] you know i'm just praying and asking the
[18:53] lord to lead me to the next series i
[18:54] definitely wanted to
[18:56] preach colossians as i was working my
[18:58] way through paul's letters with the
[19:00] galatians ephesians philippians i'd like
[19:02] to move on to colossians and
[19:04] perhaps look at the life of the lord
[19:05] jesus that'd be a whole other series but
[19:07] i love to preach us through the gospels
[19:08] and look at the life of christ remember
[19:11] that's so important because brother
[19:12] brahma said the ministry of the bride
[19:14] must match the bridegroom before the
[19:15] coming of the lord
[19:17] in other words the bride's ministry will
[19:18] look just like christ real sweet real
[19:20] humble full of power full of victory
[19:22] here
[19:24] okay thank you
[19:28] i'm sorry joshua 23 1-3
[19:32] i'm gonna read verses one and two myself
[19:33] and then let's all read verse three
[19:35] verse one says and it came to pass a
[19:37] long time after that the lord had given
[19:39] rest unto israel
[19:40] from all their enemies round about that
[19:42] joshua waxed old and stricken in age
[19:46] verse 2 and joshua called for all israel
[19:48] and their
[19:49] and for their elders and for their heads
[19:51] and for their judges and for their
[19:53] officers and said to them i am old and
[19:56] stricken
[19:57] in age let's read verse three together
[19:59] can we one two three and ye have seen
[20:02] all that the lord your god hath done
[20:05] unto all these nations because of you
[20:09] for the lord your god is he that fought
[20:12] for you amen may god as blessings and
[20:15] reign of his word you may be seated
[20:16] praise god
[20:24] well we're kind of a real privilege to
[20:25] be here tonight and we're thankful for
[20:27] god's grace
[20:28] i want to thank austin and lena they're
[20:30] working on letters that we're going to
[20:31] send out this week to
[20:33] as many message churches as we know
[20:35] there's like there's about 90 of them
[20:38] just in the u.s and we're going to offer
[20:40] our books and our videos for free
[20:42] and last time i think we heard back from
[20:44] 2 out of
[20:45] 50.
[20:47] so hopefully we hear back for more but
[20:48] that's okay if not you know we're just
[20:49] trying to help people and and we know
[20:51] the impact that these teachings have had
[20:53] upon our lives
[20:55] right and so we know if people are
[20:57] hungry for more of god god will add the
[20:59] same blessing to their life as well so
[21:02] we're sending those to the pastors and
[21:03] then
[21:04] anyone who we gave a free book of the
[21:06] christian modesty book everyone i kept a
[21:08] record of all those on paypal
[21:10] i think it was like 70. we sent 70 books
[21:13] out for free
[21:14] all those 70 people are getting another
[21:16] letter they're friends of the ministry
[21:18] and see if they like the new book
[21:20] or there's any help we can do we want to
[21:23] give our lives as a service to others
[21:27] a christian's greatness is not measured
[21:30] in what they get
[21:31] a christian's greatness is measured in
[21:33] how much they give
[21:36] right i quoted that ver i quoted that
[21:38] minister on sunday and i misquoted it i
[21:40] forgot it's not john wesley who was it
[21:42] does anyone remember
[21:43] he said earn as much as you can save as
[21:45] much as you can give as much as you can
[21:48] it wasn't john wesley but as one of
[21:50] those uh
[21:51] men from the reformation and i just want
[21:53] to reiterate that
[21:55] give as much as you can praise god
[21:58] because you know you're loaning unto the
[22:00] lord
[22:01] and if you loan anything to god you can
[22:03] guarantee he's going to pay you back
[22:05] god won't forget about you praise god he
[22:08] may he'll test you he'll allow you to be
[22:09] tested but he will never forget about
[22:11] you know god doesn't forget
[22:13] praise god so we looked at our texts
[22:15] here tonight and um
[22:18] you know let's just look again we have a
[22:20] couple more chapters here in this joshua
[22:21] series
[22:22] and we're bringing it down to a close
[22:27] and so tonight we'll try to get through
[22:29] chapter 23 we'll just kind of go through
[22:31] this
[22:32] keep your bible handy we'll be preaching
[22:33] right through these verses it's a very
[22:35] short chapter just 16 verses
[22:37] and we'll be addressing these thoughts
[22:39] here so chapter 23 is a summons by
[22:42] joshua reminding of the blessings and
[22:44] cursings of the land
[22:46] and then chapter 24 is another summons
[22:48] and he urges
