[47:20] our brother for having us here sister
[47:23] Whitney I'm always it's always good to
[47:25] see saints of God brother John and you
[47:30] know brother bang and all we for the
[47:34] bang looking married now and we
[47:40] appreciate him and his wife and for the
[47:42] Adam and his wife just thank you for
[47:44] your hospitality
[47:46] amen as we stand we're going to turn ask
[47:50] you to turn with us to Psalms 89 in
[47:53] Psalms 55 Psalms 89 you must realize
[48:01] tonight that we are witnesses of the
[48:08] word and you know we would love to have
[48:16] a large church more people coming but
[48:25] you and I must also know that we have
[48:28] been ordained to preach a message at a
[48:32] time where the earth has been or the the
[48:36] world in itself has been plowed over
[48:40] seven times we are living in what we
[48:44] called the gleaning time
[48:46] the cleaning time is when there's only a
[48:48] few left over it's very difficult to
[48:52] find true seed in this day hours think I
[48:57] was telling brother Jesse they said I
[48:59] know who I was talking with but you know
[49:01] a lot of times I get fish on the hook
[49:03] but to try it when you try to reel a man
[49:05] seemed like the line break up all you're
[49:11] getting right close to the boat and they
[49:13] get away but nevertheless we've got to
[49:16] continue to work till Jesus come we are
[49:22] privileged you know it's so easy it
[49:25] would have been easier perhaps if we had
[49:28] lived in a time where the revival was
[49:30] fresh and people coming in and we see
[49:35] all kinds of miracles and signs and
[49:37] wonders but I want you to understand
[49:40] that even then a lot of those people
[49:42] didn't stand they fell away but when you
[49:47] got the word that you actually living by
[49:50] the word itself and you don't see all of
[49:54] the great miracles even though you know
[49:56] that they are possible they're here you
[49:58] don't see them but we are living in a
[50:00] time but we're living in a faithless
[50:02] generation we're living in a time where
[50:06] there's only a few Bible says as it was
[50:08] in the days of nor as it was in the days
[50:10] of lot it was only a few they actually
[50:13] made it and think about this people of
[50:16] God you are of those few you're standing
[50:19] at a time where all our position is
[50:21] against you you don't see God in the way
[50:24] that they saw God you know but the
[50:28] greatest place where you see him is in
[50:30] your personal lives you see yourself
[50:33] overcoming you see yourself gaining
[50:36] victory that you know that you yourself
[50:38] would be it would be impossible for you
[50:41] to do you see yourself standing when
[50:44] you've seen many fall away you see
[50:47] yourself in love with God in a way that
[50:49] there is no quitting there's no giving
[50:52] up no matter how many times you trip no
[50:56] matter how many times you fall you find
[50:59] yourself
[50:59] standing again that's the grace of God
[51:02] to us that's a that's a covenant that
[51:05] God made with us being fulfilled and I
[51:09] am happy to be part of that whew and you
[51:15] must understand that that it takes a lot
[51:19] when I say take a lot I tell the church
[51:21] at home there at our church we've got a
[51:23] small group and you know you know we
[51:27] don't have anything fancy I think sister
[51:29] wait sister Whitney's been to our church
[51:31] and we've got curtains that she teased
[51:34] me she took my calling beyond the veil
[51:39] but in the spirit of it all we realized
[51:41] that man we're so blessed they have as
[51:45] many as we have yeah Enoch walked by
[51:49] himself you know not even his family
[51:52] walk with him and brother Branham said a
[51:55] man that one day Enoch saw his family
[51:57] say bye-bye
[51:58] you know I've seen that quote somewhere
[52:02] brother but my point my point is Enoch
[52:05] was determined to go even if no one else
[52:10] would and that's the kind of attitude we
[52:13] must have you know and so as we turn to
[52:18] the scriptures i wanna i i'm trying to
[52:20] assure you of something that your
[52:23] journey is not in vain psalms 89 27 to
[52:30] 37 also i will make with him my
[52:35] firstborn higher than the kings of the
[52:38] earth my mercy will i keep for him
[52:41] forevermore and my covenant shall stand
[52:45] fast with him his seed also will i make
[52:50] to endure forever and it's throne as the
[52:53] days of heaven if his children forsake
[52:57] my law and walk not in my judgment if
[53:01] they break my statutes and keep not my
[53:04] commandment then will i visit their
[53:07] transgression with the rod and their
[53:10] iniquities with stripes
[53:12] nevertheless my loving-kindness will I
[53:15] not utterly take from him nor suffer my
[53:19] faithfulness to fail not yours
[53:22] his faithfulness his faithfulness to his
[53:26] word and to his covenant he will not
[53:30] suffer to fail Amen my covenant will I
[53:34] not break no after the thing that is
[53:37] gone out of my mouth no altar excuse me
[53:41] the things that is gone out of my lips
[53:45] once I have sworn by my holiness that I
[53:49] will not lie unto David his seed shall
[53:53] endure forever
[53:54] and it's thrown as a son before me if it
[53:59] shall be established forever as the moon
[54:02] and as faithful witness is heaven so low
[54:06] that means to meditate on this I really
[54:10] want you to think on this because in
[54:12] this you can see if there is no failure
[54:15] in God there's no failure in us right I
[54:19] was there fifty five ten and eleven one
[54:23] of my favorite scriptures I love this
[54:25] scripture I see something that I don't
[54:27] know what everybody else sees it but I
[54:29] used to one thing my mom when she lives
[54:32] she loved flowers and things and I was
[54:35] her gardener I went out there to plant
[54:36] the seeds and make sure the flowers grew
[54:38] and fertilized them and and it really
[54:41] became a beauty for thing to me to see
[54:43] those flowers and plants grow up like
[54:45] that and I truly said I really miss
[54:48] doing those kind of things I was there
[54:51] 55 10 and 11 for as the rain cometh down
[54:54] and the snow from heaven and returned it
[54:58] not thither but watereth the earth and
[55:01] make it bring forth and bud that it may
[55:05] give seed to the sower and bread to the
[55:09] eater so shall my word be that goeth
[55:12] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[55:14] return unto me void but it shall
[55:17] accomplish that which I please and it
[55:20] shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[55:23] sent it
[55:26] my the would like let's have a word of
[55:29] Prayer
[55:30] father we thank you for your grace and
[55:32] your mercy we thank you for being so
[55:35] good to us we pray father God that you
[55:37] were blessed a service in a special way
[55:39] give us what we stand in need of the
[55:42] Lord will be careful to give you the
[55:43] praise glory and honor and Jesus
[55:46] Christ's name we pray amen
[55:48] you may be seated surely God is good to
[55:53] us one thing I love about God is that
[55:57] when his word goes out he cannot alter
[56:00] it you know how we have seen in times
[56:04] where you may buy outfit or something
[56:08] and you know it fits at the beginning
[56:11] and then you may gain way to lose weight
[56:13] and then you have to make some
[56:14] alterations well God never has to alter
[56:17] anything every every word of God fits
[56:20] you and I perfectly oh I think about it
[56:25] now it doesn't matter how young and how
[56:29] old somehow the garment always fit and I
[56:34] think about how God's Word captures so
[56:39] many characters people who are so
[56:42] different in in their ways and their
[56:44] behaviors you know whether it's I was
[56:48] talking to Jesse about this whether
[56:50] you're born on the under the Aquarius
[56:53] side or the Gemini sign or the Arias
[56:56] sign or whatever sign or whatever month
[56:58] you were born in understand the word
[57:01] fits us all it doesn't matter where
[57:05] we're we vary in our behavior when it
[57:07] comes to the natural things but it's the
[57:12] soul where the Word of God has been
[57:14] placed and we you and I must understand
[57:18] that God has promised us now you know
[57:21] what a promise is see we can fail in our
[57:24] promises we can say oh I promise you
[57:26] I'll be there or I promise you out by
[57:28] this I promise you our sin those those
[57:31] songs
[57:34] but we fail in those things we have good
[57:37] intention but because we're you and we
[57:40] we can so easily become distracted God
[57:43] is never distracted
[57:45] God you know I don't know how he does it
[57:48] but I think about just the number in
[57:51] here I mean we're not talking about the
[57:53] trillions of people or beings of people
[57:54] that's on earth but I think about the
[57:56] time that all of us have needs and God
[57:58] can hear all of our prayers and God can
[58:00] answer every one of our prayer and still
[58:02] be on time never late ever late and and
[58:08] you think to yourself you said what do
[58:10] you mean brothers I'm saying the promise
[58:12] is sure and when we talk about a
[58:15] problems we talk about an express
[58:17] assurance of which of which on which
[58:20] expectation is is to be based in other
[58:23] words we we know his promises sure and
[58:26] as we were talking over the lunch table
[58:29] you know we are expecting a man that
[58:31] that translation we're expecting that
[58:34] rapture huh we've never seen a rapture
[58:36] before but we it has been explained to
[58:39] us what one is we have never seen a
[58:41] translation before but we know what it
[58:44] is and we are in expectation because God
[58:47] promises one we're looking for him and
[58:51] we're expecting it to win happen to us
[58:53] right when somebody base of promise will
[58:56] give you a promise you know it we
[58:58] understand that our promise is not based
[59:00] upon law our promise is unconditional
[59:04] y'all know what I'm saying it means I'm
[59:07] going to do for you even if you don't do
[59:09] for me I understand I'm gonna love you
[59:13] that's that's a covenant it is one that
[59:16] we got because we have because Abraham
[59:18] had that unconditional covenant and
[59:21] Abraham had a promise that God renege on
[59:25] his promise did he fail in his promise
[59:26] no every promise he gave Abraham he did
[59:30] it is that right
[59:32] it was so unconditional you know when I
[59:35] read in the scripture where Abraham lied
[59:37] to that King and then God got on the
[59:40] king and said if you don't restore the
[59:43] man's why
[59:44] I'm gonna kill you on Abraham he caused
[59:47] it but Abraham lied to me Lord but you
[59:52] see you've never seen it anywhere in the
[59:55] scripture where God got on Abraham for
[59:58] lying instead God rewarded Abraham he
[1:00:05] went into Egypt and he came out of Egypt
[1:00:08] with more riches than he did when he
[1:00:10] went in it doesn't to the natural mind
[1:00:13] it doesn't make sense but you must
[1:00:15] understand in the eyes of God Abraham
[1:00:18] was justified as though he never seen in
[1:00:23] the first place hallelujah but God let
[1:00:27] it be written there so you can see his
[1:00:29] love toward Abraham and know that the
[1:00:31] love that he had my Abraham it's the
[1:00:33] same lovey helper you he was already
[1:00:37] accepted why because in the beginning
[1:00:41] the Bible said abraham believed God and
[1:00:44] God counted it for righteousness
[1:00:47] holy in other words Abraham not only
[1:00:50] believed the message that God gave him
[1:00:52] but received the message that God gave
[1:00:54] because he believed the message that God
[1:00:56] gave him circumcision the Undercity it's
[1:01:01] that God even Charles Abraham as a
[1:01:04] father faith because he was one of those
[1:01:06] people who could look beyond what he saw
[1:01:09] and call those things that be not as
[1:01:12] though they were and that's how the
[1:01:14] bride is we are ordained we made that
[1:01:18] way we cannot help it you said what do
[1:01:21] you mean it's like a person it meant
[1:01:23] like like Malik ah who who's who's
[1:01:25] gifted and playing oh y'all hadn't seen
[1:01:27] nothing yet
[1:01:28] Amen but the gift is there you can see
[1:01:30] it and once that gift is cultivated you
[1:01:34] know and continue in it he's going to be
[1:01:36] so good and you forget about the day he
[1:01:38] started out right because that's the way
[1:01:43] it is and guess what he cannot help that
[1:01:46] he can hear music and some of us can
[1:01:50] hear music and we can't tell whether we
[1:01:52] in the key of C or a but but it is a
[1:01:56] gift understanding
[1:01:58] and that's how it is with Abraham seed
[1:02:01] it is a gift that we have a faith that
[1:02:04] can go beyond a denominational faith we
[1:02:07] can see something and not worry about
[1:02:09] because we know that God is able see is
[1:02:12] something it's just an assurance that we
[1:02:14] have once you receive the seed oh I love
[1:02:17] this because the scripture says the just
[1:02:19] in one place you said the just shall
[1:02:21] live by faith then in another scripture
[1:02:24] says the just shall live by his faith
[1:02:26] hallelujah God defines the faith that
[1:02:29] he's speaking of and the scripture also
[1:02:32] says when the Son of Man comes shall he
[1:02:34] find the thing there's only one faith
[1:02:37] and that is the face of God by faith God
[1:02:40] created the heavens in the earth by
[1:02:42] faith y'all see what I'm saying God
[1:02:44] created all things both say and then God
[1:02:47] comes along and give us that faith and
[1:02:50] what is the faith faith is not a thing
[1:02:53] faith is a person by faith Jesus Christ
[1:02:58] who was God spoken word who was God's
[1:03:02] seed created everything we looked at him
[1:03:05] but a man said he was like the logos
[1:03:07] that light that light that came out of
[1:03:10] God and you know and that's where I
[1:03:12] don't understand how in the world of God
[1:03:14] you can see the creation and you can see
[1:03:16] the power of God and you can see the
[1:03:17] move of God and you don't know how to
[1:03:19] dance well brother and I said that
[1:03:21] little pillar fire danced they let there
[1:03:28] be and all the things that are happening
[1:03:29] he started dancing around oh my god what
[1:03:32] was it it was judge I of the word what
[1:03:38] what I really loved and I'm showing you
[1:03:41] these things because you know I don't
[1:03:42] know how this morning message after had
[1:03:44] I took this message I actually preached
[1:03:48] about two or three services Amen at home
[1:03:50] about the will and you know kill the
[1:03:53] will and all that kind of stuff and you
[1:03:56] know I some of the people you know
[1:03:58] instead of being lifted they were kind
[1:04:00] of you know down you know because they
[1:04:03] saw and I tried to confessed it in my
[1:04:05] own thoughts my own will have got me in
[1:04:08] trouble many a times hallelujah and you
[1:04:11] know
[1:04:12] a lot of times you don't even know that
[1:04:13] you got a little stubborn that's going
[1:04:15] with you until our position comes and
[1:04:17] you don't feel like doing whatever it is
[1:04:19] you're supposed to be doing
[1:04:20] right it takes God people yeah
[1:04:22] understand this thing is not based upon
[1:04:25] our our doing as his doing
[1:04:28] even though listen you know we live
[1:04:30] right before before God why not because
[1:04:34] we're afraid of Hell no we live before
[1:04:39] him because we tried to show him our
[1:04:41] appreciation for what he's already done
[1:04:45] for us
[1:04:46] I don't live right to go to heaven see
[1:04:49] the seed in me cannot see it hold her
[1:04:52] y'all give me the seed in me that cannot
[1:04:56] share so God ain't looking at this
[1:04:57] looking at the sea I'm covered by the
[1:05:01] Lord so are you but I lived righteously
[1:05:06] not because Oh Lord I'm going to be
[1:05:08] condemned the Bible said there is no
[1:05:10] condemnation to those who walk not after
[1:05:13] the flesh but after the spirit and once
[1:05:16] the Spirit of God is in you you walking
[1:05:19] after him though you make mistakes
[1:05:21] there's no condemnation is that the word
[1:05:24] that's the word but I confess you know
[1:05:29] some every ever try to feel condemned
[1:05:33] when you know you're done wrong and it's
[1:05:35] just like it's just not there because
[1:05:40] what it is is you got two worlds you're
[1:05:42] working with one world you're sending
[1:05:45] heavenly places
[1:05:46] the other way are you living here right
[1:05:49] but this world knows that you're free
[1:05:51] there's really no condemnation because
[1:05:54] you've been justified but in this world
[1:05:56] you want to feel bad because you've done
[1:05:59] wrong I don't know whether I'm
[1:06:00] explaining it or not but my whole point
[1:06:02] is you want to make things right with
[1:06:05] God even though you know it's already
[1:06:08] made right am I making sense pastor but
[1:06:14] my point is you know this is me I'm
[1:06:17] speaking of me sometimes that feels so
[1:06:21] free and
[1:06:24] Oh protect it too sometimes you know it
[1:06:28] looks like Lord you know I didn't mean
[1:06:31] to do it and let me bring it that this
[1:06:35] is what I'm trying to say sometimes you
[1:06:36] want to feel so bad till at least you
[1:06:38] bring a little bit of repentance you
[1:06:43] want to do some action Lord Lord Lord
[1:06:45] you know but it don't always come like
[1:06:47] that and maybe I'm wrong sometimes I
[1:06:50] when I confess I know I'm so forgiving
[1:06:53] till I don't have to put on an act or
[1:06:55] show before God I've already confessed
[1:06:59] it I meant what I've confessed am I
[1:07:02] supposed to feel some great remorse let
[1:07:06] me move on my point is I don't know how
[1:07:08] sometimes because I know I'm forgiven
[1:07:11] and when you come to a place and you
[1:07:14] know you've already been accepted in the
[1:07:17] beloved even I'm saying
[1:07:20] you've come to a perfect faith and you
[1:07:23] know you've already you now standing in
[1:07:25] heavenly places in Christ Jesus it's
[1:07:31] kind of hard for me to say it but I
[1:07:34] can't remember Abraham ever asking God
[1:07:38] Lord forgive me
[1:07:42] just the thought you and I must
[1:07:47] understand Amen you can't be saint and
[1:07:50] sinner you either saint or you're sinner
[1:07:54] you can't be holy and unholy you either
[1:07:58] holy or unholy you understand me you
[1:08:00] can't be a black white bird or a white
[1:08:02] black bird you got to be one or the
[1:08:04] other
[1:08:04] who are you my my thing is that we have
[1:08:09] such an assurance that every sin against
[1:08:12] us has already been paid for everything
[1:08:16] brother man said we have been so
[1:08:19] justified as though we've never done it
[1:08:21] in the first place now I'm not saying a
[1:08:24] true Saint a true saint of God you will
[1:08:26] never go outside willfully doing wicked
[1:08:30] things but when you come short you
[1:08:33] already covered have you ever pray
[1:08:37] before and before you can even finish
[1:08:41] asking God to forgive you
[1:08:43] he's already answered your prayer there
[1:08:47] have been times when my walk was not
[1:08:49] straight and God still answered my
[1:08:52] prayer
[1:08:52] ha it was a covenant an unconditional
[1:08:57] covenant that God gave to us amen and
[1:09:01] sometimes we fear when we ought not to
[1:09:03] fear never say were seen are you trying
[1:09:07] to preach hypocrisy no I'm not I'm
[1:09:10] trying to say that he whom the Sun sets
[1:09:12] free is free indeed and where the Spirit
[1:09:16] of the Lord is there is Liberty
[1:09:19] hallelujah God don't want us walking
[1:09:22] around with our head hung down
[1:09:23] hallelujah he wants us to walk in
[1:09:26] victory is that right brother Adam said
[1:09:34] we backslide every day huh
[1:09:38] now are you gonna live like a carry on
[1:09:41] like a backslider do you know you're
[1:09:44] gonna go through all that moaning and
[1:09:46] groaning are you gonna rejoice because
[1:09:48] you know you're free you know that the
[1:09:51] blow has recovered hallelujah and all
[1:09:54] when you say god I didn't mean the door
[1:09:57] boom is done hallelujah don't have to
[1:10:00] have a priest or anything because the
[1:10:02] Bible said that the blood of Jesus
[1:10:03] Christ was share for you once and for
[1:10:05] all
[1:10:06] oh god don't run can you imagine how
[1:10:10] busy Jesus would be amen of every time
[1:10:12] we made mistake he's running back and
[1:10:14] forth from the altar the blood is laying
[1:10:16] there but you saw all where's the blood
[1:10:19] it's only on top what Oh - my heart and
[1:10:22] your heart hallelujah whoo and as long
[1:10:26] as the blood is laying on the heart the
[1:10:28] heart cannot be judged or condemned put
[1:10:33] it that way
[1:10:34] am I right or wrong see God's plan
[1:10:39] remains unbroken for us it cannot be
[1:10:42] broken if you've been chosen to be bride
[1:10:47] there's nothing you can do to break it
[1:10:49] there's an
[1:10:51] think I can do to break it mmm it's a
[1:10:54] confidence it's an assurance a blessed
[1:10:57] assurance Jesus is mine oh what a
[1:10:59] foretaste of glory design right because
[1:11:03] the Bible said whom God justified
[1:11:05] he's already glorified hallelujah he
[1:11:08] didn't say nothing about sanctification
[1:11:10] because sanctification comes with the
[1:11:12] justification if you're truly justified
[1:11:15] you live a sanctified life a man not
[1:11:20] sanctified life listen is this the truth
[1:11:23] the Bible tells us that brother brother
[1:11:25] limpin is where he says in the future
[1:11:27] home he said in the future home he said
[1:11:30] when when when the earth has his baptism
[1:11:32] of fire it's going to burn all the
[1:11:35] demons away from it he said and that is
[1:11:38] a type of the true baptism of the Holy
[1:11:40] Ghost
[1:11:42] huh so when the Holy Ghost comes in your
[1:11:45] soul I talk about your flesh in your
[1:11:47] spirit I said when the Holy Ghost comes
[1:11:49] in your soul there is no demon in your
[1:11:52] soul whatever dog that was in your soul
[1:11:56] God burns it out now when it comes to
[1:12:00] your spirit Satan can anoint you there
[1:12:03] Satan can anoint your flesh but he can
[1:12:06] never make a trueborn against the lever
[1:12:08] disbelieve the word ever never no matter
[1:12:13] how many that's why when you say Lord
[1:12:15] forgive me
[1:12:16] you saying Lord you wrong I'm wrong
[1:12:18] you're right it's just quick is easy and
[1:12:22] you say well what do you mean that's
[1:12:23] what keeps us free that's what keeps us
[1:12:26] in a place of not having condemnation
[1:12:28] the the power to say I'm sorry Lord
[1:12:32] forgive me you're right
[1:12:35] I'm wrong that keeps you free as I say
[1:12:40] that throughout the day young attorney
[1:12:43] it's a constant staying in pray are
[1:12:46] constant you know you're yielding a
[1:12:49] constant of surrendering amen to the
[1:12:52] will of God and the only way I can do
[1:12:54] that is to see myself wrong and see him
[1:12:56] right and because of that God keeps me
[1:13:01] right
[1:13:02] keeps us right hallelujah you can't see
[1:13:05] listen brother branham said if it wasn't
[1:13:07] for the blood we would all be dead right
[1:13:10] now remember the time he saw that oh
[1:13:15] that lady in the in the little sandwich
[1:13:18] shop purple nails and purple hair and
[1:13:21] you know dressed like a little whatever
[1:13:24] and he condemned the Lord while you let
[1:13:27] such stuff exist on the earth
[1:13:29] whoo you know if we forget where God
[1:13:32] brings it brothers from sometime
[1:13:35] hallelujah
[1:13:36] and you must understand that that you
[1:13:39] know it was easy for him to say that
[1:13:40] because he forgotten God said ho time
[1:13:44] for a conference come behind the doorman
[1:13:46] let you see some things hmm and he saw
[1:13:49] God and showed him the woman's problem
[1:13:51] God showed William Brown of his sins
[1:13:54] showed him his condition and showed him
[1:13:57] he was worthy of death himself had it
[1:14:00] not been for the ring of the blood
[1:14:02] hallelujah come a prophet of no prophet
[1:14:05] he was a sinner saved by grace
[1:14:07] hallelujah so are we and the same
[1:14:12] covenant he lived under it's the same
[1:14:15] covenant we live under let me say like
[1:14:19] this the Bible said can any man add a
[1:14:20] cubit to his stature the answer is no no
[1:14:24] Lord how will it be more faithful that's
[1:14:27] a good desire but you cannot be more
[1:14:30] faithful ain't our God give you
[1:14:31] faithfulness God I want to be more holy
[1:14:36] you cannot be more holy there's no such
[1:14:38] thing really amen
[1:14:39] holiness is a perfect state you can't be
[1:14:42] more of a a perfect right because
[1:14:45] there's no such thing is more perfect
[1:14:49] you understand me
[1:14:51] amen but when we say Oh Lord I want to
[1:14:53] be like you I want to be more like you
[1:14:55] that's a different state you can't be
[1:14:59] more like him until he grants it
[1:15:01] everything that you obtain in the
[1:15:04] spiritual realm is given by God God I
[1:15:08] want more faith faith is a gift you
[1:15:10] can't even get it until God give it you
[1:15:14] understand
[1:15:15] but the Bible tells us we have not
[1:15:17] because we ask not hallelujah and the
[1:15:22] Buffs world let me say well I don't ask
[1:15:24] God one time and he done it one time
[1:15:28] they also is a parable in the scripture
[1:15:30] of opportunity keep knocking until he
[1:15:36] answers the door God want to see how
[1:15:40] much you really wanted and how desperate
[1:15:44] you are to obtain it but in the process
[1:15:47] of our growth let me say it like this
[1:15:51] David was the anointed of God a man
[1:15:55] after God's own heart David has such a
[1:15:58] covenant with God that he messed up how
[1:16:01] many times he paid for it I don't want
[1:16:04] you to think that you're not gonna pay
[1:16:06] for whatever you do every sin he says
[1:16:07] listen you go out the way I'm going to
[1:16:09] put my ride on your butt I ain't gonna
[1:16:11] destroy you right so that's why it's so
[1:16:15] good come on y'all knows the truth well
[1:16:17] how much of a spanking a child will get
[1:16:19] if immediately when they do row and they
[1:16:20] come run to you and say buddy I did this
[1:16:22] and I'm so sorry I did it hardly ever
[1:16:26] but if I catch it where you don't done
[1:16:29] something wrong and you didn't tell me
[1:16:32] right then that's when you get your
[1:16:34] spanking and your spanking is really
[1:16:37] about the idea that you didn't tell me
[1:16:39] you did the thing I had to go search
[1:16:42] around who broke the pot you know amen
[1:16:46] so that's how it works even in God's Way
[1:16:49] when the man is ready to repent and ask
[1:16:51] for sorrow God's grace and mercy is
[1:16:53] there Oh
[1:16:55] somebody help me so you see what I'm
[1:16:58] saying it's not we have a win-win
[1:17:01] situation first of all he promised it I
[1:17:06] love the way brother branham illustrates
[1:17:08] this and he says they laughed and at
[1:17:10] Sarah and I'm Abraham and Sarah when
[1:17:13] they said it was gonna have a baby the
[1:17:17] mall folks coming in there said you know
[1:17:18] God done promised me a baby and you know
[1:17:20] we could
[1:17:23] you know and I'm sure they say you know
[1:17:25] something's wrong with them y'all don't
[1:17:26] pay him too much attention you know but
[1:17:29] the nevertheless they believe God in
[1:17:33] spite of all oh I'm gonna make a rapture
[1:17:37] oh this is what I love about this
[1:17:39] because God waited not only big till our
[1:17:44] Sara was dead he waited to Abraham
[1:17:46] couldn't produce nothing dared Abraham
[1:17:50] he laughed one time she laughed and
[1:17:53] believes that God would have destroyed
[1:17:55] her but she couldn't because she was a
[1:17:57] part of him that's why I'm so important
[1:18:00] the whole ego those of you got our own
[1:18:03] egos God can't destroy you even though
[1:18:07] you might laugh even though you might
[1:18:08] come up with some unbelief somewhere God
[1:18:11] cannot destroy you is that the word Amen
[1:18:17] he says listen you seal to the day of
[1:18:18] your return she and every train riding
[1:18:23] smooth huh you're gonna go with some
[1:18:27] bombs you gonna go over some grids
[1:18:28] you're gonna go through some tunnels you
[1:18:30] gonna ride a man and at the same time
[1:18:33] you're gonna come to your destiny and
[1:18:34] you'll be all right I love it the way
[1:18:38] God packs her sister he packed that word
[1:18:40] in us to make sure that whenever we
[1:18:42] bumped and hit something we don't rattle
[1:18:46] solid hallelujah that's what they say
[1:18:49] with any guy in a solid brother solid a
[1:18:51] minute that's the way I like it because
[1:18:53] when you see that the word is solid no
[1:18:57] cracks in it nothing can break it or
[1:18:59] destroy or alter it it just you just get
[1:19:03] a linen ride it hallelujah and you look
[1:19:07] at this thing well what do you mean
[1:19:08] brother Brooks listen if Abraham the
[1:19:10] Bible said abraham believed God and that
[1:19:12] believe was counted unto him as
[1:19:14] righteousness hallelujah and then God
[1:19:17] comes along and gives Abraham a
[1:19:18] circumcision
[1:19:23] gave it to him and let me tell you
[1:19:26] something just like God did get Abraham
[1:19:29] he's gotta be faithful to his promise
[1:19:31] that's what I read he cannot fail he
[1:19:34] can't say he couldn't fail David he
[1:19:36] can't fail you and then because we are
[1:19:38] Abraham's seed hallelujah Lord listen
[1:19:43] I'm standing on your promises I can't
[1:19:46] produce it no more than Abraham and
[1:19:48] Sarah could produce hallelujah
[1:19:51] you've got to operate on me you've got
[1:19:54] to change me in order to produce this
[1:19:57] Jesus Christ I can't producing like I am
[1:20:00] I need a supernatural hand in this right
[1:20:06] whew you show brother Bruce he said I
[1:20:12] need some strength God prophet said that
[1:20:18] Sarah nursed on the rest of Australia
[1:20:22] she received her strength he received
[1:20:25] she received her strength from him
[1:20:27] hallelujah it's all right it's all right
[1:20:29] to receive strength that's why he's a
[1:20:32] shout yeah he was there because he knew
[1:20:34] you was gonna need strength right amen
[1:20:38] and he knew you said well what do you
[1:20:39] mean brother let me go down to Jesus and
[1:20:41] I love this because Jesus amen was there
[1:20:44] at Calvary and he's there praying and he
[1:20:47] needed strength what not the god part
[1:20:51] the man part he needed strange and
[1:20:54] sometimes we need strength the solid is
[1:20:57] solid the Bible said that the Spirit is
[1:20:59] willing but the flesh is weak sometimes
[1:21:01] the flesh is just weak and Lord we need
[1:21:03] strength how do you get strength go down
[1:21:06] on your knees and pray is that right
[1:21:09] because that's how Jesus received his
[1:21:11] strength Lord not my will but thine will
[1:21:14] be done and when he's submitted to God
[1:21:16] then an angel was dispatched and
[1:21:18] strengthened him because a lot of times
[1:21:21] that's all God needs from you it's
[1:21:22] submission and surrender once we submit
[1:21:25] his Orenda he will send us what we need
[1:21:27] is that all right listen
[1:21:30] Amen brother I'm talking about Sarah he
[1:21:32] said all what a beautiful type I'm
[1:21:34] worthy worthy of death when we sin
[1:21:37] but God cannot kill us because he would
[1:21:39] see we are part of Christ
[1:21:41] that's our grace because we are in union
[1:21:44] with Christ isn't that a beautiful
[1:21:46] thought union with Christ so therefore
[1:21:48] our sin when we do them we ought to
[1:21:51] quickly confess them that they're wrong
[1:21:53] see what I'm saying because God will
[1:21:55] take our life right but the blood
[1:21:58] answered in our place and God just can't
[1:22:02] cross the blood Amen wrong but he he
[1:22:08] would judges he would kill us but he
[1:22:10] can't Kaustubh learn oh and here we are
[1:22:16] in these last day we are in thee like
[1:22:19] the preacher said the culmination of all
[1:22:22] things we are in the zenith we are at
[1:22:24] the peak of a of Satan's Edom hallelujah
[1:22:28] we are at the darkest time of all
[1:22:30] history and God chose you God chose you
[1:22:38] because he knew that there is something
[1:22:41] in you that can win the battle
[1:22:44] hallelujah you and I have been ordained
[1:22:47] to outshine the doggy's hallelujah we
[1:22:51] are the stars Amen in this dark
[1:22:54] atmosphere hmm you think about it how
[1:22:57] difficult it is for us when all of the
[1:23:00] churches have gone whirling hallelujah
[1:23:02] think about how difficult it is for us
[1:23:04] Amen when we see the apostasy z' of the
[1:23:06] church when they when they call in right
[1:23:09] wrong and wrong right and yet you're
[1:23:11] standing for that which is righteous
[1:23:12] you're standing for that which is holy
[1:23:14] you're like Elijah and then you're
[1:23:16] standing up on Mount Carmel hallelujah
[1:23:18] you have a showdown now hallelujah and
[1:23:21] then not just because there that you
[1:23:23] have bear worship us but now Israel a
[1:23:25] bear worshipers hallelujah did you not
[1:23:28] know that these Christians who are
[1:23:30] called Christians are Bear worshipers
[1:23:32] everybody that believes in the Trinity
[1:23:34] they are worshiping bail hallelujah
[1:23:38] did you not know brother Branham said
[1:23:40] they are out there worshipping the devil
[1:23:42] and don't even know it because the only
[1:23:45] way you can worship God is in spirit and
[1:23:47] in truth
[1:23:49] that's what you ought to always thank
[1:23:51] God for your pastor because he's doing
[1:23:53] everything to keep you in the truth of
[1:23:55] the word hallelujah
[1:23:57] think about it Elijah he had to climb
[1:23:59] that mountain go up that mountain and at
[1:24:02] the time he gets up there now he's got a
[1:24:04] battle hallelujah you go tell those male
[1:24:08] worshipers we're gonna have a showdown
[1:24:09] here and we're gonna prove whose God is
[1:24:11] God
[1:24:12] I'd like that brother uh uh I'm looking
[1:24:14] at that third pool on this side and
[1:24:17] remember look we're gonna show who's God
[1:24:19] is God is that right brother branham's
[1:24:21] here at the Mount Zion showdown is when
[1:24:23] the bride of Jesus Christ is raptured
[1:24:27] death will show you whose side you
[1:24:29] belong and that'll sell you so show the
[1:24:32] church they were on the wrong side
[1:24:34] hallelujah amen a larger crime that
[1:24:37] melting fixture on the top of the
[1:24:39] mountain and after all of that he said
[1:24:41] hey ham I'm gonna have a little grace on
[1:24:43] you you better pack up and get down real
[1:24:46] quick because it's going to rain but I
[1:24:50] want you to show the power of the seat
[1:24:52] think about it now he was a Elijah
[1:24:55] he's a seed of God but I want to show
[1:24:57] you that when the streets try on during
[1:24:59] that time and that pool Amen when when
[1:25:02] God anointed Elijah he outran the
[1:25:05] chariot hallelujah
[1:25:08] don't you understand Amen when that
[1:25:10] anointing Coghlan at third Pope's fully
[1:25:12] gets into swing we won't have to worry
[1:25:15] about nothing because of the seed that's
[1:25:17] in you God Jesus Christ will like a
[1:25:21] flower will open up in his fullness and
[1:25:24] we'll see God in a way we've never seen
[1:25:26] him before
[1:25:26] hallelujah we don't have to worry about
[1:25:28] these automobiles and all of this
[1:25:30] electric stuff and digital stuff that
[1:25:33] can find us wherever they want to find
[1:25:35] that they can't find us if we're hiding
[1:25:37] in another dimension
[1:25:38] Lauren area is that right that's what
[1:25:41] David said amen in Psalm 27 he shall
[1:25:44] hide me in a secret place he hardly it
[1:25:47] is prevailed
[1:25:48] Oh somebody help me you and I must
[1:25:51] understand that if Jesus walk through
[1:25:54] the crowd will be able to walk through
[1:25:55] the crowd
[1:25:56] if Jesus walked through the world will
[1:25:58] be able to walk through the wall
[1:26:00] hallelujah
[1:26:01] we won't have to try every what we are
[1:26:03] made out of that right will speed up in
[1:26:09] their slow down whoo I would have loved
[1:26:17] to see that old man out riding that
[1:26:19] chariot down the mountain hallelujah God
[1:26:24] is so good to us we have word let us
[1:26:28] never be ashamed of who we are don't be
[1:26:30] ashamed brother branham let me say it
[1:26:32] like this you know I I try to be
[1:26:34] cautious because I don't want nobody to
[1:26:36] think I'm worshipping him but I'm not
[1:26:38] ashamed of the name you understand me
[1:26:41] I'm not ashamed of the name I'm not
[1:26:42] ashamed of what he what he did for us
[1:26:44] but I want to be careful because my God
[1:26:46] is jealous I want to make sure I salt
[1:26:49] Jesus Christ higher than the name
[1:26:51] William Brennan you see them saying Amen
[1:26:54] because I want God to know that I would
[1:26:56] have a revelation
[1:26:57] it wasn't Elijah it was the God behind
[1:26:59] the elijah is that right amen
[1:27:03] think about it we've got such power in
[1:27:06] in our genes we don't know what to do
[1:27:08] with him hallelujah
[1:27:09] but if John was able to withstand being
[1:27:11] bald three days in oil you and I are two
[1:27:14] that's power Oh y'all come on come on
[1:27:17] that's powerful holiday dude I can't
[1:27:19] even hardly stand hot water to hit me
[1:27:21] more or less oil boiled three days in a
[1:27:27] pot of oil what was that the Holy Ghost
[1:27:31] hallelujah the Holy Ghost had
[1:27:33] infiltrated every fiber of his being
[1:27:36] amen in the oil listen limitation when
[1:27:39] you got fire only inside that fire would
[1:27:42] join with any other fire is that right
[1:27:45] it's the truth your fire and God is fire
[1:27:49] put fire with fire it's just become a
[1:27:51] bigger fire hallelujah and so we realize
[1:27:55] by God's grace I'm trying to assure you
[1:27:57] people we don't have to worry don't let
[1:27:59] the Satan put such a worry on you and oh
[1:28:01] my god how am I do this and how am I do
[1:28:03] that God never told us of worry and
[1:28:05] understand worrying is a lack of faith
[1:28:09] it's the absence of faith right so when
[1:28:15] you got when you were in it oh my god
[1:28:17] but I believe God no you don't you don't
[1:28:21] believe God when you whirring I'm sorry
[1:28:22] you just don't you're trying to but
[1:28:24] you're not right because when you work
[1:28:27] when you have faith you spend like the
[1:28:30] Rock of Gibraltar
[1:28:31] hallelujah they're not varying you
[1:28:34] you're not double minded but when you
[1:28:36] worry you double minded Lord I believe
[1:28:37] you oh well our own well yes Lord you're
[1:28:40] just too intro but faith is solid
[1:28:44] hallelujah hey man the delecate do
[1:28:47] nothing with faith hallelujah yeah I
[1:28:50] understand me so we look at this thing
[1:28:52] you should all other Brooks you know
[1:28:54] what we supposed to be doing and this is
[1:28:55] what the devil has taken away from us
[1:28:57] revelation 22:17 says and the spirit and
[1:29:00] the bride say come
[1:29:01] that's our ministry we supposed to be
[1:29:06] inviting people in this time this is our
[1:29:07] hour of evangelism this is our hour of
[1:29:10] saying come come come but the devil God
[1:29:13] is also busy we don't have time to
[1:29:15] witness but our job for the Lord is to
[1:29:19] say come whosoever will let him come
[1:29:22] where do you think this is going to take
[1:29:24] place at the wild salvation today of
[1:29:28] salvation for the Gentiles will be over
[1:29:30] it's got to be now
[1:29:32] oh we don't we know we're not going to
[1:29:36] get a whole group of people if we do it
[1:29:38] reeling from the Lord but my point is
[1:29:40] there still some out there because we
[1:29:42] haven't been translated do what you can
[1:29:46] do people get out there as the bride not
[1:29:49] as a church but as a bride and know that
[1:29:53] the people know we believe Hebrews 13
[1:29:55] and eight Jesus Christ the same
[1:29:56] yesterday today and forever hallelujah I
[1:29:59] got some people I've got to work with
[1:30:01] when I get back home this man is dying
[1:30:03] any men but I'm trying to get to him his
[1:30:05] wife I had to come this way cuz I
[1:30:08] believe if God can conquer death in the
[1:30:11] Old Testament he conquered in the New
[1:30:13] Testament and he can conquer today I
[1:30:17] just don't believe if a man really trust
[1:30:20] God
[1:30:21] God I have mercy on you is that right
[1:30:25] I've heard listen to the blood prophet
[1:30:27] of God many times he's a now if God will
[1:30:29] heal you will you surrender your heart
[1:30:31] to the Lord will you give your life to
[1:30:33] God if God should heal you he said now I
[1:30:36] can't promise that he will but if he
[1:30:38] would right see that's what we we should
[1:30:42] approach people you see them in
[1:30:43] wheelchairs and things like this he said
[1:30:45] well I know about miracles I've seen
[1:30:46] them I know they're real and I'm not
[1:30:49] saying God will do it for you but one
[1:30:51] thing for certain you don't want to go
[1:30:52] leave this life a man without God on
[1:30:56] your side you won't be crippled here
[1:30:58] being crippled in hell you say well you
[1:31:01] shouldn't say it so rough you better say
[1:31:03] it rough sometimes you have to say it
[1:31:06] rough it meant to get daily teach you to
[1:31:08] jog them a little bit I don't try to O
[1:31:10] Lord not to offend people being so light
[1:31:12] on them and everything else and then
[1:31:14] something happen to him then I'm the one
[1:31:15] feeling guilty because I feel like I
[1:31:17] wasn't strong enough when I said what I
[1:31:19] said you understand me Amen I don't want
[1:31:22] nobody to die on me because I didn't
[1:31:24] tell them everything and sometimes you
[1:31:27] may not get but one chance right you put
[1:31:32] the meat on the hook you don't know how
[1:31:34] much it's going to nibble on it might
[1:31:35] take the whole the meat and the whole
[1:31:36] hook right but you trying to tell the
[1:31:39] fish you're trying to give the fish a
[1:31:40] little nibble nibble off that hook all
[1:31:43] the day without taking that hook but you
[1:31:46] want him to take the hook so how do you
[1:31:49] do that
[1:31:50] you had to look behind the me or
[1:31:55] whatever hell's you fix you with ain't
[1:31:57] God good to us listen here's John with
[1:32:03] with with will notice he said you will
[1:32:05] notice that John had addressed himself
[1:32:08] to the Christians and the brother in
[1:32:10] tribulation I love that because you know
[1:32:13] what everybody said when we John types
[1:32:16] the bride but we don't want we don't
[1:32:17] want we don't want to see the two
[1:32:18] relation but tribulation came with John
[1:32:22] the bride y'all understand me when he
[1:32:25] was out on the Isle of Patmos it was not
[1:32:27] easy for him he had a time of constant
[1:32:31] tribulation when they couldn't kill him
[1:32:33] they put him on an hour
[1:32:34] patmos and that's when he received the
[1:32:37] revelations of Jesus Christ so you got
[1:32:40] to understand that your tribulations
[1:32:42] whatever trials you going through is a
[1:32:44] journey for you and that journey will
[1:32:46] take you closer to God's revelation and
[1:32:49] will for your life you said that's not
[1:32:53] true but that's exactly what happened to
[1:32:54] Joe Joe was a righteous man that God the
[1:32:57] Word of God said he was a perfect and
[1:32:59] upright man is that right amen but his
[1:33:01] trials and tribulation took him where
[1:33:03] God needed him to be is that was only a
[1:33:05] sheet and it was there only a sheep is
[1:33:11] when he got closer to God because God
[1:33:13] unveiled to him that he was going to be
[1:33:15] in the resurrection he said I know the
[1:33:20] skin wounds eat up my fresh in my flesh
[1:33:23] shall see God
[1:33:24] can you imagine when Jesus rose from the
[1:33:26] dead and John Shawn said that's the man
[1:33:30] you talking about a Jubilee oh my god I
[1:33:35] know that dimension that they were in
[1:33:37] couldn't hardly wait to release them
[1:33:38] because they were tearing it up yeah I
[1:33:44] gotta get up out of here
[1:33:46] oh my god listen I'm almost done I was
[1:33:51] gonna preach it on but I want you to see
[1:33:52] a special class of people brother
[1:33:56] Branham says so he said you will recall
[1:33:58] that I mentioned at the beginning of
[1:34:00] this message that this book we are
[1:34:03] studying is the actual revelation of
[1:34:05] Jesus himself in the church and his work
[1:34:08] is in the future ages then I will
[1:34:11] mention that it takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:34:14] give us revelation and we will fail to
[1:34:16] get it or we would fail to get it
[1:34:19] bringing these two thoughts together you
[1:34:21] will see that it won't take just
[1:34:23] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[1:34:26] book real it is going to take an
[1:34:29] operation of the Holy Ghost that makes
[1:34:31] this book makes this book can be
[1:34:35] revealed to anyone to make this book see
[1:34:40] it can't be revealed to anyone but a
[1:34:42] special class of people so you got to
[1:34:45] understand you're not just people you
[1:34:51] now you're hand-picked you know God has
[1:34:54] set you aside I could remember when I
[1:34:57] was a boy in most of the reality problem
[1:35:01] anyhow when I was a boy we used to play
[1:35:04] marbles y'all know about marbles Jesse
[1:35:11] says no but down in the country we
[1:35:15] played marbles and you had a bag of my
[1:35:18] order was the prettiest little glass
[1:35:19] bottle of brown balls it was the
[1:35:21] prettiest
[1:35:21] we called him cat eyes and all kind of
[1:35:23] things you know and then we got the big
[1:35:25] one called the bomb you know that was
[1:35:27] your that was your big you know you take
[1:35:28] that one and you break it up like that
[1:35:30] with a back and then scatter it all out
[1:35:32] well you know every little boy had his
[1:35:36] special that he would used her you know
[1:35:40] knock it out and ring and all that and
[1:35:42] that's what you out of God you that
[1:35:46] special marvel that he uses to knock
[1:35:49] Satan out of the ring see you had a lot
[1:35:55] of marbles but this one was special and
[1:35:57] that's the way God has used us and and I
[1:36:00] look at this thing and we we worry
[1:36:01] sometime we threaten we say Oh a lot but
[1:36:04] don't you understand he saved the best
[1:36:06] wine for last the first shall be last
[1:36:09] you God's greatest secret weapon outside
[1:36:13] of Jesus himself huh Oh y'all gettin
[1:36:17] quiet
[1:36:17] don't you understand we're the ones that
[1:36:19] would defeat Satan in the end we were
[1:36:22] beasts come on Satan has been able to
[1:36:25] hold people in this dimension how long
[1:36:29] he couldn't hold Jesus right he couldn't
[1:36:33] hold Moses nor Elijah but now God has
[1:36:37] created a people that would defeat his
[1:36:41] hole all together hallelujah
[1:36:46] I don't mean just getting up out of the
[1:36:47] grave I mean there be those who won't
[1:36:49] even go to the green and you think about
[1:36:54] that what was God doing happiness
[1:36:56] he was just sowing the seed
[1:36:57] for this day ooh what's nice just
[1:37:04] powerful to me and you think about you
[1:37:06] sure what what do you mean but other
[1:37:07] books that life in you that God is
[1:37:10] quicker than you has it's far more
[1:37:13] powerful than you can imagine if God
[1:37:16] said that that power will amen and you
[1:37:18] can speak the world and your existence
[1:37:20] and go live on it I don't think he was
[1:37:22] just talking because this is just a
[1:37:25] small portion of time for eternity we
[1:37:30] got a lot more to do and God is not
[1:37:33] explaining to us what it all is but I
[1:37:36] believe that God don't put creation
[1:37:40] ability in you for the purpose of just
[1:37:42] having it there God is not a God of
[1:37:46] vanity and at some place in that
[1:37:49] eternity you're not gonna be doing
[1:37:52] things just like God did and you say
[1:37:55] brother Brooks you really going far with
[1:37:57] it but I'll tell you this he didn't let
[1:38:03] Lucifer being a creator and if it was
[1:38:06] God's Word listen brother I said God is
[1:38:09] not God is omniscient he's omnipresent
[1:38:11] he said but he's not everywhere like we
[1:38:15] think he is he said because now God is a
[1:38:17] person and he said God will never go
[1:38:20] back to being what he used to be my cuz
[1:38:23] now he's got children he's in you he's
[1:38:28] in you he could remain he could remain
[1:38:31] where he was but he's now he's got a
[1:38:34] family hmm
[1:38:37] why would God put oh Lord
[1:38:41] let me say it like this and maybe I'm
[1:38:43] stepping out too far but let me say it
[1:38:45] like this you've heard me say this
[1:38:47] before now I'm just pricking your
[1:38:49] thought just making sure you think about
[1:38:51] these things because that's what I see
[1:38:53] that's what I see it may be I'm beyond
[1:38:55] myself and I won't say I say these are
[1:38:57] my words let me say it can I drop some
[1:38:59] words on you uh when you was in the womb
[1:39:04] of your mother you had hands you had
[1:39:07] feet you had eyes you had
[1:39:11] now and you didn't need none of that to
[1:39:13] live you lived off for her you didn't
[1:39:17] have to walk she walk for you you didn't
[1:39:20] have to clap your hands or anything she
[1:39:22] did that for you but those things that
[1:39:25] the way you was created wasn't for the
[1:39:27] belly it was for the world you were
[1:39:32] created that so you can do something
[1:39:34] here so when you're born again
[1:39:36] supernaturally you're born in the womb
[1:39:39] of the earth or in this world
[1:39:42] supernaturally not for this place but
[1:39:45] for the place to come see by faith God
[1:39:49] created see that's the first thing he
[1:39:51] did remember I said like this among the
[1:39:56] Jewish tradition and culture they said
[1:39:58] to kill a man is to kill a universe you
[1:40:03] know how because of the seeds that's in
[1:40:06] him that'll never be planted that'll
[1:40:10] never grow think about what band Adam
[1:40:14] has created all of this all these seeds
[1:40:17] all over where one man
[1:40:19] it becomes eternity itself you
[1:40:23] understand me infinity almost because of
[1:40:26] one man one tree that they said you can
[1:40:29] count the apples in the tree but you
[1:40:30] can't count the seeds in the Apple right
[1:40:34] how it goes but you know you know what
[1:40:37] I'm saying so you say well what do you
[1:40:39] mean brother books to have a son mean it
[1:40:41] continues it continues it continues it
[1:40:43] continues amen even even the even among
[1:40:46] thee the customs of the world where they
[1:40:49] didn't believe in God but they believed
[1:40:51] in having sons because sons continued
[1:40:53] the seed is that right
[1:40:55] amen you saw that in the law with Judah
[1:40:58] didn't give his sons to it tomorrow
[1:41:01] right amen but my sister arm I didn't
[1:41:04] marry into this family to become
[1:41:05] childless hallelujah and if you're not
[1:41:09] gonna give me your sons I'm going to the
[1:41:11] original one who I loved it I loved it
[1:41:17] cuz she went to the original and then
[1:41:20] she brought forth seeds of Judah
[1:41:26] now you tell me that ain't God how you
[1:41:29] hear me because she knew Amen that
[1:41:32] somehow if I could get to do to God will
[1:41:35] anoint my desire and give me an
[1:41:38] impregnation I'm sure she didn't know
[1:41:40] she was gonna have twins but at the same
[1:41:41] time God rewarded her because of her
[1:41:44] faith am I making sense so my point is
[1:41:49] God will continue eternally and he will
[1:41:53] ever be eternal nothing can stop him
[1:41:56] because after this is over there will
[1:42:01] never be another multiplication of sons
[1:42:06] and that's why the Bible said there was
[1:42:10] a number that no man can know oh I wish
[1:42:15] I could tell you like I see it
[1:42:16] but I tell you one thing you'll see one
[1:42:19] day you're gonna see me up then you say
[1:42:20] well brethren I remember that I thought
[1:42:23] [Laughter]
[1:42:25] but I found out you're right I got me a
[1:42:28] planet over here a universe over here
[1:42:31] you are a young man brother hallelujah
[1:42:36] but my point is if God says ye are gods
[1:42:41] you cannot be a God without what mmm
[1:42:51] creation and see the truth of the matter
[1:42:54] is God will not share your glory his
[1:42:56] glory with anyone but the Bible says I
[1:42:59] saw the bride descending with the glory
[1:43:04] of God she didn't have her own glory he
[1:43:12] was her glory hallelujah and you know
[1:43:17] and I know that every man shares his
[1:43:19] glory with his wife and his wife and he
[1:43:26] are not to their one am I making sense
[1:43:33] oh because I won't
[1:43:35] to understand this is just the beginning
[1:43:38] this is just the beginning I have not
[1:43:41] seen is it not hurt you got to
[1:43:43] understand this is just the beginning
[1:43:45] and to miss heaven for this you got to
[1:43:50] be out of your mind
[1:43:54] you got to be out of your mind
[1:43:56] that's like trading me a penny for a
[1:43:57] million I'll give you a million dollars
[1:44:00] with my penny ticket no I'm keeping my
[1:44:07] opinion brother I like the color of it
[1:44:09] uh uh you know what I'm saying it
[1:44:11] doesn't make sense that the training is
[1:44:14] not it just doesn't make sense but when
[1:44:18] you see what God has given you eternal
[1:44:20] life let me taste I'm God there will
[1:44:22] never be a boring and I'm a closing just
[1:44:24] a minute one more thought this okay i'ma
[1:44:28] close with Isaiah 59 19 through 21
[1:44:33] there's so much I wanted to say but i'ma
[1:44:36] cut it short
[1:44:36] he said so shall they fear the name of
[1:44:39] the lord from the west and its glory
[1:44:41] from the rising of the sun when the
[1:44:44] enemies shall come in like a flood the
[1:44:46] Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[1:44:48] standard against him and the Redeemer
[1:44:52] shall come to Zion and unto them that
[1:44:55] turned from transgressions in Jacob
[1:44:57] saith the Lord now I want you understand
[1:44:59] that he's working with the bride of
[1:45:00] Jesus Christ and he also Amen is telling
[1:45:03] you that the Redeemer see God would rise
[1:45:06] up a standard you know it ain't us me
[1:45:11] understand it is the God in us that's
[1:45:14] rising up a standard and and not of
[1:45:17] people don't even think we're standards
[1:45:18] now but sister brother you're the
[1:45:21] standard but everything else has been so
[1:45:24] perverted and looking like all kinds of
[1:45:26] stuff
[1:45:27] you are the standard when I look at you
[1:45:29] I look at our sisters I'm looking at
[1:45:31] real men and women you understand me you
[1:45:36] don't even you look what I'm just being
[1:45:37] me but you don't understand
[1:45:39] you're the standard you got God set you
[1:45:42] here as a testimony of what a man and a
[1:45:45] woman supposed to look like
[1:45:47] right you are standard and no matter
[1:45:51] what people's gonna look at you and make
[1:45:52] and they're gonna notice it because
[1:45:54] they're conscious is gonna show them
[1:45:56] that you're right even though they don't
[1:45:59] want to do it they know you're right but
[1:46:02] they don't want to do it they will is in
[1:46:04] the way I know I'm a hurry up cuz I we
[1:46:09] love the Lord amen and the Redeemer
[1:46:11] shall come to Zion and unto them turn
[1:46:13] the transgression and the Jacob said the
[1:46:14] Lord as for me this is my covenant with
[1:46:17] them saith the Lord my spirit that is
[1:46:20] upon thee and my words which I have put
[1:46:23] in thy mouth shall not depart out of our
[1:46:26] mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed
[1:46:29] nor out of the mouth of that CC said the
[1:46:32] Lord from his fourth end forever that
[1:46:35] means that you can't get away from him
[1:46:38] cuz when God seals himself in he's in
[1:46:44] amen when he says I'll never leave you
[1:46:46] nor forsake you he actually put himself
[1:46:48] in there he said I can't leave me not
[1:46:50] forsaken because I've sealed in here
[1:46:54] hallelujah and I will be with you always
[1:46:56] and that's why the delegate oh you feel
[1:46:58] so lonely and God knows because I'm a
[1:47:00] sensitive person he attacks me with that
[1:47:03] a lot you know and because you got a lot
[1:47:06] of people around you doesn't mean that
[1:47:08] you can't be lonely sometimes Amen you
[1:47:11] are lonely when people are all around
[1:47:13] why because there's certain needs or
[1:47:15] certain things that you desire to have
[1:47:17] but there's not you know what I mean
[1:47:19] that kind of person or whatever and you
[1:47:22] said well Lord you know what must I do
[1:47:23] and then God says well remember me I'm
[1:47:27] always with you
[1:47:28] and sometimes God allowed those lonely
[1:47:31] feelings Amen for us to turn to him so
[1:47:34] that he can become a friend
[1:47:36] hey that's Stan I want
[1:47:44] be my friend I need him as my friend I
[1:47:46] know he's my Savior and you know in
[1:47:51] sharing one more thing in closing if you
[1:47:54] could know your origin you know you came
[1:47:56] from God you go back to God right for
[1:48:00] example well let's say I use use
[1:48:05] something in comparison yes let's use
[1:48:09] these two bottles even though they you
[1:48:13] know they both olive oils but let me see
[1:48:16] this oil or this bottle is have a
[1:48:19] different origin maybe it came from
[1:48:21] Africa maybe it came from India I don't
[1:48:23] know but my point is though these olive
[1:48:27] oils look the same they're not they came
[1:48:31] from two different origins so therefore
[1:48:33] they're different species or different
[1:48:36] brand I'm not making sense
[1:48:38] if I came from this oil if I came to
[1:48:41] this oil and and and somehow in other
[1:48:47] words if I came from this oil I can't I
[1:48:49] can't return to this bottle because this
[1:48:52] is not where I came from
[1:48:53] if there was a returning of the oil I
[1:48:56] must return to the oriole I came from
[1:48:59] right so let's put it this way one of
[1:49:02] these bottles represents God and the
[1:49:04] other one represents Satan do Satan have
[1:49:07] children yeah oh yeah oh yeah Judas was
[1:49:11] one of the top once a minute and you and
[1:49:13] does God have children well all of God's
[1:49:17] children came out of his bottle and if
[1:49:20] it's going to ever be refilled it must
[1:49:23] be filled with the same substance that
[1:49:25] came out of there in other words I can't
[1:49:31] feel that's put let's say that's still
[1:49:33] using oil cuz it's pretty bad but if I
[1:49:35] got a water in here I can't come from
[1:49:37] this oil and put it in this bottle of
[1:49:39] water cuz it'll never mix but if I came
[1:49:43] from oil that means if I put the oil in
[1:49:46] here you'll never know I'll blend right
[1:49:47] in there right so what I'm trying to say
[1:49:52] is Satan's children is water and when
[1:49:56] they go
[1:49:56] back they must return to what they came
[1:49:59] from their origin is water you can't put
[1:50:03] the water in the oil it won't fit it
[1:50:06] won't blend so when you know you came
[1:50:10] from God why are you worried about going
[1:50:11] back here you can never go to hell if
[1:50:15] you came from God
[1:50:18] if you truly sons and daughters of God
[1:50:21] you could never go to hell well you say
[1:50:24] well the sons of God saw the daughters
[1:50:26] of men and they always lost they were
[1:50:28] sons of God because they were made in
[1:50:30] the image of Adam but in their souls
[1:50:33] that were serpents God had to give them
[1:50:39] recognition because of what they look
[1:50:40] like their appearance y'all understand
[1:50:44] me
[1:50:44] so you said what do you mean don't you
[1:50:46] realize the Bible said that the serpents
[1:50:48] shall bruise the head and the the heel
[1:50:51] and and in God's each to bruise the head
[1:50:53] and who was that that's right and who
[1:50:57] was the Serpent's those religious men
[1:51:01] they look like men but God called them
[1:51:05] serpents and that's what it is today
[1:51:09] you got serpents that look like men that
[1:51:13] literally look like sons and daughters
[1:51:15] of God preaching in the pulpit and
[1:51:18] everything else you said how would their
[1:51:20] preacher that daddy used to preach Satan
[1:51:24] preached the first sermons and to Eve
[1:51:25] 2nd one anyway he proceeded and his
[1:51:32] children are preachers but they all
[1:51:34] preach a lie so you got to understand
[1:51:40] don't fear if you know that you came
[1:51:42] from God there's only one place you can
[1:51:44] return and back to ass back to God you
[1:51:48] should all brother Brooks what are you
[1:51:49] what are you trying to say well remember
[1:51:51] brother man said that man died a
[1:51:53] drunkard and he was saved saw a man fail
[1:51:56] God and he was saved hallelujah Solomon
[1:52:00] Dada idolaters and he was saved
[1:52:04] hmm David had so much blood on his hand
[1:52:07] but he was saying
[1:52:10] yeah it's all my goodness what are you
[1:52:13] talking about Peter Amen tada Jesus
[1:52:16] Christ three times and he would say
[1:52:18] Judas did not him and cursed him one
[1:52:20] time betrayed him when tiny and was lost
[1:52:25] y'all hear me see those who come from
[1:52:28] God go back to God those who came from
[1:52:31] the devil go back to the devil we are
[1:52:34] here to express the angelic or the power
[1:52:37] of God that stood with God in the
[1:52:39] beginning and those who came from Satan
[1:52:41] are those fallen angels who are here to
[1:52:44] express what the Fallen Angels did from
[1:52:47] the beginning mm-hmm that's good stuff
[1:52:53] to me I don't know who I'm bragging on
[1:52:56] me I'm bragging of God like the Dave
[1:53:00] said it's sweeter than the honey in the
[1:53:02] comb let's pray I know we're tired thank
[1:53:05] you for your your attention father we
[1:53:07] come before you lord as humbly as we
[1:53:09] know how we thank you for your grace and
[1:53:11] your mercy Lord you've been so good to
[1:53:13] us O Lord we just love you we love your
[1:53:18] services we love being in your presence
[1:53:21] we thank you now we pray that you bless
[1:53:23] the church tonight Lord assure them that
[1:53:29] the way has already been made this it
[1:53:33] can't be altered and you said by your
[1:53:36] word Lord that this it was finished
[1:53:39] before the foundation of the world it's
[1:53:43] already completed even though we go
[1:53:45] through these things even though the
[1:53:46] children of Israel amen went through the
[1:53:48] wilderness and everything that was
[1:53:49] already settled before they even denied
[1:53:51] God Lord God knew what was going to
[1:53:55] happen they knew he was they would
[1:53:56] murmur than complain he knew that they
[1:53:58] would learn and complain he knew that
[1:54:00] they wouldn't enter in even when they
[1:54:02] started out but they had to fulfill
[1:54:04] those things and those thoughts that was
[1:54:06] in his mind Lord and he knew those who
[1:54:09] would come out as conquerors he knew
[1:54:11] Joshua and Caleb before the foundation
[1:54:14] of the world father even so God you know
[1:54:16] us you knew what time we would come the
[1:54:20] battles we would fight the battles we
[1:54:23] would
[1:54:23] in the ones we would lose and father you
[1:54:26] saw our total victory in your dear son
[1:54:28] Jesus Christ that's why he had to come
[1:54:31] he had to die for us he had to live for
[1:54:34] us he had to share his blood for us he's
[1:54:37] our hero Lord he is our victor
[1:54:40] hallelujah because of him hallelujah we
[1:54:43] can rally like the Israelites did and
[1:54:46] run out of the Philistines Lord after
[1:54:49] the Goliath was killed and farther you
[1:54:52] destroyed the works of the devil Lord
[1:54:54] when you went down to hell you took the

[2:00:09] man
[2:00:13] I shall be eatin sweet yeah so I trust
[2:03:42] that you won't go out there and say
[2:03:43] brother Brooks made a new doctrine I was
[2:03:47] just giving you my thoughts and how I
[2:03:49] levitated on God's Word and when I
[2:03:52] meditate on God word it just takes me
[2:03:54] places you know I believe that what it's
[2:03:56] all about sometimes God opens up things
[2:03:58] to you and you said well well well it's
[2:04:03] in there if you could see it if you
[2:04:05] can't see it it's not in there God's
[2:04:07] Word is spiritual and sometimes it's out
[2:04:10] to be spiritually it has to be not
[2:04:11] sometime all the time it has to be
[2:04:13] spiritually discerned and remember
[2:04:16] sometimes God will tell you secrets
[2:04:17] things that he won't tell somebody else
[2:04:19] sometimes I feel bad because I'm
[2:04:21] thinking well did I tell a secret but
[2:04:25] you don't have to believe all of the
[2:04:26] extra I'm not trying to add to the word
[2:04:29] or take from it but I just say consider
[2:04:32] consider some of the things I've said
[2:04:34] and and you'll see that you can't make
[2:04:38] this it this is not on it this is the
[2:04:42] beginning of something far
[2:04:44] far more beautiful than we can imagine
[2:04:47] and I'm expect a ssin first of all to
[2:04:51] get rid of that thing you know the devil
[2:04:57] and that's alright cousin out in Arizona
[2:04:59] they won't even call his name they say
[2:05:01] what what you would call it
[2:05:03] something like that what you what you
[2:05:06] would call it as um y'all knew him come
[2:05:07] on what you call it oh my god what how
[2:05:10] they say it but anyway there's no Nate
[2:05:13] no power in his name it's really as a
[2:05:17] sad situation Lucifer is a sad situation
[2:05:21] and all of his followers you know
[2:05:25] because you know we know that this is
[2:05:27] the only day that we have seen the world
[2:05:30] fall elusive er with their eyes open
[2:05:34] because they really believe that he's
[2:05:36] God and they really believe that Jesus
[2:05:39] Christ was defeated
[2:05:40] you know that's last Pope we got there
[2:05:43] said Jesus made a mistake by allowing
[2:05:45] himself to be crucified no he did that's
[2:05:50] the greatest thing he said he could have
[2:05:52] ever done I'm so glad he did that for me

[2:05:59] command dismissed or whatever he needs

[2:06:17] little weakness of mine please pray for
[2:06:19] me I need that to stop verse God in
[2:06:36] other words we see tinnitus God sees as
[2:06:38] a finished finished product just like
[2:06:41] God's all job is a finished project he's
[2:06:42] perfect you know we battled so much with
[2:06:45] the flesh we forget sometimes the god
