[28:37] showing uh verse 16 the bible says here
[28:39] we ended uh
[28:41] where
[28:42] gideon after 11 we'd say thus saith the
[28:46] lords
[28:47] after 11 visitations from an angel from
[28:50] god himself yeah uh through the prophet
[28:53] of god uh that god sent her that's
[28:55] actually 12. i just got that that's 12.
[28:57] 12 visitations
[28:59] that's the kingdom number praise god the
[29:01] 12 tribes of israel praise god that's
[29:03] the kingdom that's a government number
[29:04] amen he had 12 visitations from god
[29:07] almighty finally after 12 visitations he
[29:10] has courage to do what god has
[29:13] borne him to jesus amen
[29:15] let me say lord help me to do what you
[29:16] birthed me praise god help me amen and
[29:19] you will do it by obeying the word of
[29:21] god by obeying uh the holy spirit gideon
[29:25] had to obey
[29:26] first
[29:27] uh by giving a sacrifice the angel
[29:30] received it he had to obey second by uh
[29:33] cutting down his father's grove
[29:35] yeah right what courage that was
[29:37] to kill or destroy the gods of his
[29:39] father yes
[29:41] now instead of fearing his dead he
[29:43] feared god more amen
[29:45] that's what we must do amen not fear man
[29:48] not fear woman not fair family but fear
[29:50] god amen
[29:52] fear god and keep his commandments
[29:53] that's the whole conclusion of the
[29:54] matter
[29:55] i didn't hear you praise god amen
[29:57] and after that by god's grace he blew
[30:00] the trumpet and got a new clothes which
[30:01] types the baptism of the holy ghost here
[30:04] in type and all the army gathers 32 000
[30:07] and god said that army's too big
[30:10] they're going to exalt themselves like
[30:11] they had something to do with it
[30:13] and so gideon says those that are
[30:15] fearful can leave the battle
[30:18] 22 000 left 69 or 70 of the people left
[30:22] his church was down to ten thousand amen
[30:24] it went down from thirty-two to ten
[30:26] thousand praise god and then the god
[30:27] said it's still too big
[30:29] he said uh we gotta cut him down he said
[30:32] go down to the waters and those that bow
[30:34] down and like they're worshiping and
[30:36] then
[30:36] uh like they're worshiping waters and
[30:38] they bow down he said then kick out of
[30:40] the camp right yeah this this was the
[30:42] prideful group yes this was the group so
[30:44] these uh 9 700 that were left the 9700
[30:47] was the prideful group of the
[30:49] self-indulgent group and god said if
[30:51] they bow down like that they don't drink
[30:53] like a dog if they're not humble praise
[30:55] god amen if they're not humble like that
[30:57] with their eyes on the enemy still all
[30:58] right if they're not prepared for battle
[31:00] send them away praise god yeah and see
[31:02] church that's what we have confidence in
[31:04] god will send those away that don't
[31:06] believe like us amen
[31:08] that's true the devils are hanging
[31:10] around for a while but god eventually
[31:12] when he's going to do something with us
[31:14] he'll send those devils away
[31:16] amen hallelujah and so now the fear of
[31:19] people are gone and now the pride people
[31:21] are gone and now the people that's left
[31:23] are the real believers the humble ones
[31:25] amen
[31:26] these are the ones that will not exalt
[31:27] themselves
[31:28] in this victory amen
[31:31] true and we and we showed by uh then
[31:33] showing how he needed one more
[31:36] one more thus saith the lord he already
[31:37] had 11 but he needed one more remember
[31:40] uh the prophet that came was the first
[31:41] one that's one i forgot about so
[31:43] actually 12 he needed a 12th word of the
[31:45] lord
[31:46] amen kind of reminds me of 12 new
[31:48] testament mysteries i think i'll just
[31:49] slide that in there real quick that's a
[31:51] good number there number 12 praise god
[31:53] hallelujah
[31:55] he says i need one more god said go down
[31:57] but if you're afraid
[32:00] right i said go down there and listen to
[32:01] the tent and you'll get one more dream
[32:03] and interpretation and there will be
[32:04] enough for you praise god but there it
[32:06] is the spirit of prophecy god
[32:07] foretelling what's going to happen
[32:10] in other words god knows exactly what
[32:11] you need so you can get the victory that
[32:14] he's called you to get true
[32:16] he he knows the he knows the odds are
[32:18] going to be stacked against us he knows
[32:20] especially with the rapture they're
[32:21] totally stacked against us but he knows
[32:23] how to raise our faith they mentioned
[32:25] just the right level amen
[32:27] yeah and that's what it will take praise
[32:28] god it will take faith that will be on
[32:30] the right level praise god you know it's
[32:32] called rapturing faith amen we know it's
[32:35] called the latter rain amen this brother

[33:36] there and gave spontaneous worship to
[33:38] god you ever done that praise god yeah
[33:40] you ever just heard the word and oh my
[33:42] god you just gotta stop whether you're
[33:43] in the car yeah or wherever you are just

[33:47] that's what i saw yesterday when i had
[33:49] my phone i saw that phone i saw roe v
[33:51] wade is going to be overturned i just
[33:52] stopped right there i had a spontaneous
[33:54] moment of worship

[33:57] amen hallelujah the bible tells us to
[34:00] pray for our government amen the bible
[34:02] tells us to sign cry for the
[34:04] abominations done in this city and
[34:06] that's the group that's marked by the
[34:07] holy spirit amen right hallelujah
[34:10] see because the holy spirit hates sin
[34:13] and so he cries out against it the holy
[34:15] spirit wants righteousness
[34:17] remember we sing that psalm brother amen
[34:18] sing that song uh break my heart for
[34:21] what breaks yours
[34:23] right that's
[34:24] just a beautiful line wow right we all
[34:27] we all think god serving god is joyful
[34:29] and we forget sometimes it's also part
[34:31] of it is grieving over sin too right
[34:34] so yeah our hearts want to be joyful our
[34:36] hearts want to be happy we love in other
[34:37] words we love the mountaintops but we
[34:39] also need to have some valleys amen
[34:41] right we need some valleys and lord make
[34:43] my heart happy for what makes you happy
[34:45] but also make my heart sad for what
[34:47] breaks your heart amen amen in other
[34:49] words tell me not to have a uh
[34:52] uh attitude towards sin that doesn't
[34:54] meet your attitude
[34:56] because god is a holy god amen and he
[34:59] hates sin praise god it despises it
[35:01] praise god god help us to have hearts
[35:03] like that amen amen
[35:06] so he had a spontaneous moment of
[35:07] worship he gave god praise and they went
[35:10] up to the boys there that's kind of
[35:11] where we left off there
[35:14] the bible gideon told them he said he
[35:16] returned uh and he told them to get
[35:19] everything ready in verse 16.
[35:21] he said divide yourself in three
[35:23] companies yeah he gave every man a
[35:25] trumpet
[35:27] then he gave every man an empty pitcher
[35:30] an empty vessel
[35:32] could it be a full vessel had to be an
[35:34] empty vessel
[35:35] and lamps within the pitchers so they
[35:38] had an empty pitcher and they had to put
[35:39] a lamp in under it and hide it this
[35:42] little light of mine i'm gonna let it
[35:44] shine right
[35:46] but it has to shine at the right time
[35:47] amen right hallelujah
[35:50] in other words you your light is shining
[35:52] but god's gonna manifest that light at a
[35:54] certain time in a certain place amen
[35:57] just like god told joshua he said this
[35:58] day i'll be beginning to magnify you in
[36:01] the sight of israel praise god amen that
[36:04] little light has been hidden for so long
[36:06] praise god but now that light was going
[36:08] to shine amen amen
[36:13] in a trumpet a ram's horn hallelujah in
[36:16] every man's hand and we know trumpets
[36:18] speak of uh gatherings or war cries
[36:22] praise god so every man needs a cry of
[36:25] battle praise god a crowd a war cry amen
[36:28] every man needs a
[36:30] a
[36:30] a power a horn is a power as well right
[36:34] it's a power the power of declaring war
[36:36] in other words the power of going out to
[36:38] meet the enemy amen amen amen and he had
[36:41] a vessel
[36:42] empty vessel and he had to have his lamp
[36:44] inside of it praise god and then verse
[36:46] 17 he said look on me do what i do when
[36:50] i come outside the camp it shall be that
[36:51] i do so as ye this reminds me of jesus
[36:54] jesus said the works that i do shall you
[36:57] do also amen hallelujah paul said follow
[37:00] me as i follow christ
[37:03] praise god
[37:04] so as we do as we hear the word of god
[37:06] we must act upon the word of god and we
[37:08] must follow the godly examples the bible
[37:11] says in hebrews follow the faith of
[37:13] those who
[37:15] are over you in the lord
[37:17] follow their faith watch how they live
[37:19] out their faith and you should follow
[37:21] that praise god aren't you glad we've
[37:22] had a prophet in this day
[37:24] who has shown us how to walk in the
[37:26] faith amen
[37:28] i didn't even break he had great
[37:30] victories but he also had failures
[37:32] but he knew how to pick himself up in
[37:34] other words he knew how to repent praise
[37:36] god amen
[37:37] hallelujah thank you lord he knew how to
[37:40] do that he knew how to rejoice and have
[37:41] victories but he also was a man he
[37:43] failed he said sometimes i don't even
[37:45] feel like i'm saved
[37:46] that's true
[37:47] um
[37:48] and he was a star in the ham was sort of
[37:50] one of the seven stars in the hand of
[37:52] jesus he was a burning and shining light
[37:55] like john the baptist four seasons thank
[37:58] god we got to hear and learn about that
[38:00] season so it can help our lives to shine
[38:02] right for jesus amen amen
[38:04] hallelujah and we can follow his faith
[38:07] as he follow christ
[38:09] that's what i love you know i told this
[38:10] brother austin the different ones you
[38:12] know when i come in the message i was
[38:13] just all about doctrine but they can't
[38:15] preach that sermon
[38:16] just once more lord in our church and
[38:17] then my eyes got opened up wow i want to
[38:20] see more supernatural
[38:22] and so that's when we would go over to
[38:23] guyana and trinidad i think i made four
[38:25] trips over there and on those trips i
[38:27] saw the greatest movement of god i've
[38:28] ever seen as far as supernatural wonders
[38:31] and miracles and that's when that's when
[38:33] truly i could see i could see the things
[38:36] brother ram talked about pointing me to
[38:38] the bible and then i did what was in the
[38:40] bible and the bible became a new book
[38:42] amen
[38:44] where the bible said cast out devils i
[38:46] cast out devils when the bible said lay
[38:48] hands on the sick they shall recover i
[38:50] laid my hands on the sick they shall
[38:52] recover they did recover
[38:54] either praise god whether it was kidney
[38:56] stones or nerve damage
[38:58] or or healing from abortions forgiveness
[39:01] from abortion we had those confessed
[39:02] over there too all those kind of
[39:04] testimonies the works that jesus did we
[39:07] do also
[39:08] amen amen follow me as i follow christ
[39:12] paul said amen
[39:14] now let's look at verse 18 then
[39:18] he says when i blow with the trumpet i
[39:20] and all that are with me then blow ye
[39:23] the trumpets also on every side of all
[39:26] the camps so they're going to be in
[39:27] three groups group maybe a group here
[39:30] group there group there three groups all
[39:32] around the county
[39:35] and he says say this
[39:37] she says when you blow the trumpet they
[39:40] have to blow for a little while then
[39:41] stop right there they can't they can't
[39:42] say this and blow the trumpets at the
[39:44] same time
[39:45] so they've got a blow and then they got
[39:47] to say the sword of the lord
[39:49] and of gideon
[39:51] now i love this i love that god just
[39:53] doesn't say the sword of the lord i love
[39:55] that god gives getting a little part of
[39:57] this guy
[39:59] yes god that's him let him fight a
[40:01] little bit back guys amen hallelujah see
[40:04] that's what god always uses man it's the
[40:06] same man amen amen god could have the
[40:09] son preach the gospel god could have
[40:10] trees preach the gospel you could have
[40:12] pictures and pianos preach the gospel
[40:14] but god said man hallelujah men and
[40:16] women men and women to witness and win
[40:18] souls and be a testimony praise god god
[40:21] gives a man something to do praise god
[40:23] true that's just like i love how the
[40:25] book of mark 16 ends the bible says
[40:29] and the disciples went preaching
[40:31] everywhere the lord working with them
[40:34] confirming the word with signs wonders
[40:36] and miracles following abraham right one
[40:39] time when i was in guyana i woke up and
[40:41] the lord gave me the sermon
[40:43] and i knew it was a sermon
[40:45] and we went out to preach it was a young
[40:46] people's meeting and i stood there it's
[40:48] the only time i've ever done this
[40:48] brother i said if god doesn't vindicate
[40:51] this service then i'm a false preacher
[40:54] wow i never said that before i've never
[40:56] said a sins yeah that's how i know it's
[40:57] god
[40:59] and i preached and i was preaching and i
[41:01] said i challenged young people i said
[41:03] you need to repent and i said i will be
[41:05] the first one down to the water to
[41:07] baptize you we baptized 20 kids that day
[41:09] praise the lord
[41:11] and god vindicated that word because it
[41:12] wasn't my word it was his word including
[41:14] the pastor's children amen amen that's
[41:16] what i said when they come up i said
[41:17] pastor you baptize them they're your
[41:19] kids
[41:21] you do it
[41:23] after all i just kind of live it was
[41:24] like 90 degrees 100 degrees after that i
[41:25] just kind of laid in the water enjoyed
[41:26] that you know we're not preaching and
[41:28] baptizing 20 or so people
[41:31] but see god vindicates his word god
[41:33] gives us a part in his ministry praise
[41:35] god in other words god will work with us
[41:38] amen let me see like this god won't work
[41:39] against us as long as we're humble
[41:42] right right because the bible says god
[41:45] opposes the proud right that's true but
[41:48] he exhausts the humble praise god in
[41:50] other words god would work with the
[41:51] apostles because they would humble
[41:53] themselves and then god would vindicate
[41:55] the word of god this is going to tie
[41:56] into what i'm going to say at the end of
[41:57] the sermon
[41:58] once i turn off the livestream
[42:00] a little testimony here
[42:03] the sword of the lord and of gideon
[42:06] now verse 19.
[42:09] so gideon and a hundred men that were
[42:11] with him came into the outside of the
[42:12] camp in the beginning of the middle of
[42:13] the watch i searched you know what the
[42:15] middle watch is what's the middle watch
[42:17] midnight
[42:18] huh
[42:18] so this battle or this cry is going to
[42:21] go out at
[42:22] midnight time another time of the
[42:25] rapture
[42:26] i don't know
[42:27] another time i think last week we showed
[42:29] you about six or seven types in here on
[42:31] the rapture this victory didn't come uh
[42:33] in the eighth year it came right after
[42:36] the seventh year
[42:37] there was no eighth year of where they
[42:39] were famine there was only seven praise
[42:41] god there's only seven church ages
[42:43] there's not eight church ages
[42:46] praise god
[42:48] this victory came after the prophet left
[42:51] the scene
[42:52] glory that's why the bible said that's
[42:54] why he said if god is with us where's
[42:56] all the miracles hallelujah
[42:59] and that's what we are that's where we
[43:01] are the prophet's off the scene but here
[43:02] we are and god is with you you mighty
[43:05] woman of valor you mighty man of matter
[43:07] god is with you and god will fight for
[43:09] us and god will make us win amen
[43:12] hallelujah as long as we're humble he
[43:15] won't share his glory with the prideful
[43:17] no
[43:19] he will not do that that's why when we
[43:21] see the pride in the message that's why
[43:22] we know god's not gonna rapture them
[43:25] because they'll be prideful
[43:27] they will say it was their righteousness
[43:28] they did it
[43:30] he does not share his glory with anybody
[43:32] this verse proves it this story proves
[43:35] it amen
[43:37] god ain't gonna let anybody get glory
[43:38] for this it's going to be the humble
[43:41] that learn to wait on him and follow the
[43:43] lead
[43:45] but rather said with gideon i think the
[43:46] second seal remember brother madam said
[43:48] that richard that quote but said those
[43:50] that catch in the little things will be
[43:51] the ones who catch you if not he said
[43:53] they'll miss the rapture it'll go right
[43:55] over the top of their heads
[43:57] true oh church it's the little foxes
[43:59] that spoil the vines yeah
[44:01] it's the little things praying here's a
[44:03] big thing that's little little thing
[44:04] making repenting to others when you do
[44:06] wrong amen humbling yourself in the
[44:09] sight of the lord the church said
[44:11] that it looks like a little thing but
[44:12] it's actually a big thing yes it is
[44:15] humbling yourself saying sorry yeah
[44:18] making amends for wrong right that's
[44:20] real thorough repentance hallelujah amen
[44:23] amen
[44:24] but if they miss it on these little
[44:26] things how about fasting and praying if
[44:28] they miss it on the little things
[44:29] fasting praying reading the bible
[44:31] confessing sin just being a a real
[44:33] genuine christian if they miss it or
[44:34] that but man said they'll miss it a
[44:36] million miles
[44:38] amen
[44:40] that's right church
[44:42] and it ain't works it's grace because
[44:43] paul said i labored more than all of you
[44:45] not worse but the grace of god that was
[44:47] with me that's good
[44:54] jesus was the greatest missionary there
[44:56] ever was sure he was the greatest
[44:58] preacher there ever was it wasn't by
[44:59] works it was by grace
[45:01] amen hallelujah he was full of what
[45:04] grace and truth there it is right there
[45:05] amen
[45:07] full of grace and truth amen full of
[45:09] god's favor amen amen amen thank you
[45:12] jesus
[45:13] now
[45:15] midnight
[45:17] and now they had newly set a watch and
[45:19] they blew the trumpets and break the
[45:21] pictures that they were in their hands
[45:23] yeah
[45:25] and the three companies blew the
[45:26] trumpets and break the pitchers and held
[45:29] the lamps
[45:31] with only 300 men
[45:33] yes
[45:34] and god was going to defeat them without
[45:37] one sword amen
[45:39] amen
[45:40] hallelujah
[45:41] all because god could get a man in his
[45:44] own hand amen he could get one man in
[45:47] his hand to clean out his home life yeah
[45:51] to believe the word of god yes to test
[45:53] god with prayer amen
[45:55] to say god give me signs amen
[45:58] give me a sign let me know you're with
[46:00] me god if you're with me where's all the
[46:01] miracles let me know you're with me
[46:03] praise god can i say like this god take
[46:05] all the fear out of my heart that's it
[46:08] right that's basically what he was
[46:09] saying lord take all the fear out if you
[46:11] want me to do this i need all my fear
[46:13] god i need to replace with your faith
[46:15] hallelujah all right that's what we need
[46:17] today amen right that's what we always
[46:19] need praise god it's the faith of god to
[46:22] cast out all fear amen that's right
[46:26] help us jesus then the bible said what
[46:28] was the first thing that went the
[46:29] trumpet now this is a little different
[46:31] than the shout voice trump right oh yeah
[46:34] so it's not a perfect type
[46:36] but it is a type amen because you have a
[46:38] trump trumpet
[46:41] so they blew the trumpets praise god
[46:44] and they break the pictures with their
[46:45] hands so imagine you have the trumpets
[46:47] blowing
[46:49] [Music]
[46:50] you and all of a sudden all these
[46:52] soldiers are sleeping
[46:54] these new soldiers are just wide awake
[46:56] all of a sudden trump is now trumpets
[46:58] was no joke in those days no
[47:00] when you were in a trumpet it was like
[47:02] the siren like the tornado siren that
[47:04] went off yesterday did you hear that we
[47:05] were in a giant eagle the tornado siren
[47:07] siren went off the girls like oh daddy
[47:09] what's going to go i said honey let's
[47:11] pray
[47:12] all right
[47:13] let's just bow our heads and pray
[47:15] we pray by the time we got outside
[47:17] everything was fine but god's grace yeah
[47:19] just
[47:20] in every situation god is in control
[47:22] amen but that was a big deal
[47:26] now what what historians say i like this
[47:28] idea historians said that now remember
[47:30] the midi knights had three other armies
[47:32] with them they hit titan i can't
[47:33] remember the other one but historians
[47:35] really believed when they heard those
[47:37] trumpets they thought it was an
[47:38] insurrection
[47:40] they thought some of the armies that
[47:41] they were teamed up with had actually
[47:43] turned on them you're right
[47:47] hallelujah because you can't have real
[47:50] uh one accord you can't have real unity
[47:52] with satanic devils
[47:54] right
[47:55] right devils always fight each other
[47:56] don't they yeah look at look at all the
[47:59] sinners they're always bashing each
[48:00] other and jocking for position and roman
[48:03] says devils that cause wars amongst the
[48:05] nations
[48:06] they really can never have any unity
[48:08] that's my church no matter how small we
[48:10] are one thing we've got that they don't
[48:12] got is unity in the holy spirit
[48:15] hallelujah amen
[48:17] we are one of the spirit we're one of
[48:19] the lord praise god
[48:21] and we know that the unity is being
[48:23] restored
[48:24] i don't know praise god
[48:27] one thing they don't have is real unity
[48:31] so all of a sudden
[48:32] everybody's woken up by 300 trumpets
[48:36] and after the trumpets blow they hear a
[48:38] crashing of vessels
[48:40] so trumpet crashing wow
[48:45] 300 of them right in a row
[48:47] so they're they're they're shocked by
[48:49] the loud sound and they're shocked by
[48:51] the brokenness i love this the bible
[48:53] said god is near unto all those that are
[48:56] of a broken and contrite heart
[49:00] this we gotta have a yeah
[49:02] ready for war i don't know we've got our
[49:04] power we gotta have power for war and we
[49:07] must have broken vessels
[49:11] god won't use the pride people right
[49:13] that's right i'm talking about the
[49:14] homosexual but also the pride for the
[49:15] message saying they're the greatest the
[49:18] greatest christians of all time that's
[49:19] what they say
[49:20] they're the greatest of all time i'll
[49:21] show it to you on sunday i show it to
[49:23] them brother
[49:24] six minutes of it
[49:26] we're the greatest we're the greatest
[49:27] young people we're the greatest
[49:28] preachers we're the greatest mothers
[49:29] we're the greatest that's a lie
[49:31] that's right that's a lot how can they
[49:33] claim that when even jesus wouldn't
[49:35] claim that for people he said that he
[49:37] said it's not for me to tell you who's
[49:39] on the right that's happy god amen
[49:42] that's right they exalted themselves to
[49:44] equal in jesus because now that or maybe
[49:46] higher because they know sitting on the
[49:48] right left when jesus didn't even know
[49:51] hallelujah right
[49:53] right and a real great person will never
[49:55] say they're great anyway
[49:57] that's right so the ones that say
[49:58] they're great they're not great right
[50:00] that's pride talking
[50:02] yes it is
[50:04] so trumpet
[50:08] breaking a vessel should crash crash
[50:10] crash crash trash crash and then all of
[50:12] a sudden they come out of their tents
[50:14] and then 300 lights
[50:16] like imagine pitch black and all of a
[50:18] sudden 300 likes
[50:20] and it makes them go crazy yeah
[50:23] amen
[50:24] the light of god amen the light of god
[50:27] shined upon them praise god amen imagine
[50:30] having a light so powerful it caused a
[50:33] nation to kill itself
[50:35] that's what they had right 300 lamps
[50:38] glory 300 testimonies amen
[50:42] they have 300 oil filled holy ghost wise
[50:45] virgins amen
[50:46] [Applause]

[1:03:39] hallelujah
[1:03:40] verse 24 and getting sent messengers
[1:03:43] throughout all mount ephraim saying come
[1:03:45] down against the midianites and take
[1:03:46] before them the waters unto beth bara
[1:03:48] and jordan then all the men of even
[1:03:50] gather themselves together and took the
[1:03:51] waters onto beth barra and jordan
[1:03:54] and they took the two princes of the
[1:03:56] many knights auram and zeb
[1:03:59] and they slew orb upon the rock
[1:04:02] aurab and ziv they slew at the winepress
[1:04:05] of zeb and pursued midian and brought
[1:04:07] the heads of orb and zeb to get in to
[1:04:10] the other side of midian i'm sorry other
[1:04:12] side of jordan remember what does midi
[1:04:13] night mean it means strife
[1:04:15] so look at this spiritually jesus was
[1:04:17] going to give them victory over strife
[1:04:19] and divisions in their church
[1:04:23] strife and gossip and bittering had
[1:04:26] entered into israel and entered into the
[1:04:29] church
[1:04:30] and evil spirit had stolen all their
[1:04:32] victories for seven seven years and the
[1:04:34] church said wow
[1:04:36] look at the spiritual type
[1:04:38] and gideon means humor he had to cut
[1:04:40] down what had grown up oh hallelujah
[1:04:42] amen i didn't know something that
[1:04:44] growing up didn't john the baptist said
[1:04:47] take the axe to the root of the training
[1:04:51] glory amen
[1:04:53] so we want strife what we want strife to
[1:04:55] leave our lives or our family or our
[1:04:56] church or anything like that what does
[1:04:58] it take it takes obedience
[1:05:00] to the word of god
[1:05:02] it takes all fear being cast out
[1:05:05] it takes the removal of idols out of our
[1:05:07] homes
[1:05:09] it takes us getting signs from god
[1:05:11] knowing exactly what to do
[1:05:13] and it takes us to have a trumpet
[1:05:16] of war in our lips
[1:05:18] hallelujah we have to have the attitude
[1:05:20] of war and we have to have by god's
[1:05:23] grace we got to have our fire hidden in
[1:05:26] earth and vessels and we must be broken
[1:05:28] vessels
[1:05:29] if we're going to drive out strife
[1:05:32] divisions
[1:05:34] arguments did the bible say
[1:05:36] paul said let there be what no divisions
[1:05:38] among you
[1:05:40] he said but all speak the same thing
[1:05:43] he said in philippians 3 16 walk
[1:05:45] according to the same rule the same
[1:05:48] judgment god wants a united bride of
[1:05:51] christ fellowship
[1:05:53] god wants the united believer spoken
[1:05:55] word tabernacle
[1:05:57] god wants us united
[1:05:59] not not focused on our differences focus
[1:06:02] on what unifies us right the blood of
[1:06:05] jesus christ
[1:06:06] the power of the holy spirit the power
[1:06:08] of god's sword amen
[1:06:10] praise god
[1:06:12] now we ever look at these guys names
[1:06:14] what does zeed mean and this will mean
[1:06:16] something to sisterhood z means wolf
[1:06:18] remember the dream that brother men had
[1:06:20] yes remember that one we were having
[1:06:22] church trouble
[1:06:23] wolf they had to defeat zeb the wolf and
[1:06:26] then paul said paul said i warned them
[1:06:28] for three years that wolves would enter
[1:06:30] in
[1:06:32] men that had perverse teachings
[1:06:35] were wolves that would come in not
[1:06:37] sparing the flock drawing to themselves
[1:06:40] disciples after their own selves
[1:06:41] dividing the church that's true
[1:06:44] true they had to destroy those wolves
[1:06:47] aura means raven
[1:06:50] i forget the meaning of that one but you
[1:06:52] know ravens aren't actually fed elijah
[1:06:54] there was good use of ravens one time
[1:06:57] but see strike
[1:06:58] and wolves and all these things they're
[1:06:59] only removed by what the sword of the
[1:07:02] lord amen the word of the lord

[1:07:19] so that the battle can be won praise god
[1:07:22] hallelujah how do we believe you can win
[1:07:23] the battle amen church if gideon can be
[1:07:25] over 300 000 with just three hundred
[1:07:29] then all things are possible to them
[1:07:31] that believe
[1:07:32] remember i showed you that last week
[1:07:34] abraham had 318 brother ray he had 318
[1:07:37] and he defeated those five kings
[1:07:40] in genesis chapter 14. and who met him
[1:07:42] after that melchizedek amen
[1:07:46] gideon had smaller than that
[1:07:49] hallelujah and still it was it didn't
[1:07:52] make any difference because it wasn't
[1:07:53] about gideon it wasn't about abraham it
[1:07:56] wasn't about them it was about almighty
[1:07:58] god amen amen
[1:08:00] church that's how it is for you no
[1:08:01] matter your battle no matter your
[1:08:02] obstacle my obstacle it doesn't matter

[1:08:07] that's it and we do what god tells us to
[1:08:11] do yeah
[1:08:12] that's true

[1:08:28] let's not forget what church was about
[1:08:29] on sunday
[1:08:31] let's not forget what church is about on
[1:08:32] wednesday let's obey what the word of
[1:08:35] god
[1:08:36] that's how you get to the says where god
[1:08:38] starts driving out strife god starts
[1:08:40] driving out wolves
[1:08:43] hallelujah
[1:08:45] that's how the battle is won
[1:08:47] not by might
[1:08:49] 300 didn't have much might compared to
[1:08:50] 300 thousand
[1:08:52] not by power they didn't have swords
[1:08:54] glory
[1:08:55] they walk into a battle all they've got
[1:08:57] is oil
[1:08:59] oh my god it's oil and lamps and ram
[1:09:02] towers amen
[1:09:03] hallelujah not my might not my power but
[1:09:07] by my spear by my sword saith the lord
[1:09:10] almighty hallelujah amen
[1:09:14] that's glorious
[1:09:17] look at that church
[1:09:21] so we can see how it's a type of the
[1:09:22] shout
[1:09:24] voice and the trump they had a shout
[1:09:26] that is
[1:09:27] the sword of the lord and if giving get
[1:09:30] in they had a trump now
[1:09:31] uh i'm not sure how the voice is the
[1:09:33] light i mean
[1:09:34] i'm not sure i have to study on that one
[1:09:36] but see that's the same thing with uh
[1:09:38] jericho they had two out of the three
[1:09:39] remember that two out of three at
[1:09:41] jericho
[1:09:43] they shouted that's when the walls came
[1:09:44] down
[1:09:45] uh the voice they had the trump as well
[1:09:47] they blew the trumpets on on the uh the
[1:09:50] seventh time around on that seventh day
[1:09:53] see so these types there's there's not
[1:09:55] perp they're not perfect types of
[1:09:56] rapture but there are they are still
[1:09:58] types of the rapture
[1:10:00] and we can see it in there

[1:10:14] see this beautiful type there
[1:10:16] the bible says in psalm 34 the righteous
[1:10:19] cry the lord heareth and deliver them
[1:10:20] out of all their troubles the lord is
[1:10:22] nine to them that are of a broken heart
[1:10:25] and save as such as be of a contrite
[1:10:27] spirit see the broken heart
[1:10:30] many are the afflictions of the
[1:10:31] righteous but the lord delivereth them
[1:10:33] praise god thank you jesus and this
[1:10:36] deliverance was going to last one week
[1:10:37] brother right this wasn't going to be a
[1:10:38] one-week victory with a million nights
[1:10:40] ago the bible said it was 40 years amen

[1:10:59] if you honor god and you love god and
[1:11:01] you keep the command and if you take the
[1:11:03] sword of the lord and of yourself by
[1:11:05] god's grace the word of god in your
[1:11:06] mouth the generation will be blessed
[1:11:10] amen the word of god hallelujah
[1:11:13] and church i just heard this week this
[1:11:15] was the last time israel had any rest
[1:11:18] until samuel
[1:11:20] the rest of the judges he was the fourth
[1:11:21] judge that means there was eight more
[1:11:22] judges
[1:11:24] they never were ever ever free again wow
[1:11:27] after gideon
[1:11:29] gideon was the last time
[1:11:33] because for whatever reason he had the
[1:11:34] character he was the last judge that
[1:11:36] actually had character to really obey
[1:11:39] the word of god
[1:11:40] now listen church how many christians
[1:11:41] you know that would be like you didn't
[1:11:42] say god give me a sign and i really i
[1:11:45] would pray really hard all night say god
[1:11:47] give me a sign how many would take how
[1:11:49] many do you know would take 11 sermons
[1:11:52] 12 sermons in a row and actually obey
[1:11:54] all 12 in a row
[1:11:58] probably not very many would they i'm
[1:11:59] talking about denominations now how
[1:12:00] about message people
[1:12:03] how many of you know that take the word
[1:12:04] of god that sincerely so see all the
[1:12:06] last eight judges none of them were like
[1:12:08] that
[1:12:09] samson got a couple few victories but
[1:12:10] he's a very sensual man
[1:12:12] yeah
[1:12:13] very sensual man
[1:12:16] he couldn't get the victory like gideon
[1:12:18] could
[1:12:19] like othniel could he was the first
[1:12:20] judge but a mighty man of god
[1:12:24] and all these uh
[1:12:26] uh deborah
[1:12:28] yes yeah yes hallelujah
[1:12:31] great men and women of god hallelujah
[1:12:34] love the word of god then obey the word
[1:12:36] of god
[1:12:37] amen praise the lord
[1:12:42] hallelujah they shouted the midianites
[1:12:44] on land just like israel shouted down
[1:12:46] the walls of jericho amen
[1:12:49] there was a shout in the camp
[1:12:51] hallelujah praise god
[1:12:54] let me close
[1:12:56] so gee church we see very similar things
[1:12:58] here this was just like ii chronicles 20
[1:13:00] when the spirit of the lord came upon
[1:13:02] jehaziel and he said be not afraid nor
[1:13:04] dismayed by reason the great multitude
[1:13:07] for the battle is not yours but god's
[1:13:10] thank you lord church in every situation
[1:13:12] we can just look at it like this this is
[1:13:14] not mine to win i can't even win this
[1:13:16] praise god
[1:13:17] i have no power in myself to win this i
[1:13:19] have authority but it's got to be at
[1:13:21] god's time and season amen that's the
[1:13:23] truth
[1:13:24] i am powerless and i myself i am no
[1:13:27] match for satan unless god comes and
[1:13:30] backs up his word and stands with me and
[1:13:32] i obey all his word then the battle is
[1:13:34] not mine the battle is the lord amen
[1:13:36] amen praise the lord hallelujah praise
[1:13:39] the lord
[1:13:41] see the promise people going in people
[1:13:43] go into trials or go into situations
[1:13:45] thinking they got the power
[1:13:47] just because they're emotional because
[1:13:49] oh god help me before no you still need
[1:13:51] to be broken
[1:13:53] you still need to be humble the church
[1:13:55] said amen god will fight against you if
[1:13:58] you're prideful
[1:14:00] he resists the pride
[1:14:02] the problem
[1:14:04] but he exalts the humble amen
[1:14:07] hallelujah
[1:14:10] he even told them that john hoshabat you
[1:14:11] should not need to fight this battle
[1:14:14] stand still and see the salvation of the
[1:14:15] lord
[1:14:16] amen
[1:14:17] hallelujah
[1:14:19] what a blessing church yes how many can
[1:14:22] see you you're yourself in this story

[1:14:39] you that's right you you you you you're
[1:14:42] the gideon amen where the where are the

[1:14:55] hallelujah
[1:14:56] john the baptist preached six months

[1:15:00] the 40 years of moses's ministry jesus
[1:15:03] christ said so
[1:15:04] he said there's not been a man born of
[1:15:06] woman greater than john the baptist it's
[1:15:09] not about quantity it's about quantity
[1:15:12] how do you praise god amen amen
[1:15:16] it's true
[1:15:19] enoch how do you take the rapture it
[1:15:20] wasn't the quantity of people that was
[1:15:21] with him
[1:15:22] it was the quality of his walk yes
[1:15:26] is that right
[1:15:28] the only one that god took in that that
[1:15:30] day you're right
[1:15:32] god intake quantity got to quality

[1:15:36] so never let the devil whisper in here
[1:15:37] say get behind me satan you're right
[1:15:41] god let 300 men defeat over 300 000.
[1:15:45] god let 318 defeat five kings
[1:15:47] god took one man out of the anteluvian
[1:15:50] age
[1:15:51] when everybody else well when others
[1:15:53] were good people but god only chose one
[1:15:55] right so in other words you and i could
[1:15:57] be that one
[1:15:59] to praise god you can stop the
[1:16:00] livestream here god bless you live
