[0:00] by the grace of god
[0:03] let's go to genesis 1 26 i'm going to
[0:05] preach on part 4
[0:07] of the
[0:09] mystery of the godhead we'll start with
[0:11] genesis 1 26 this great peculiar
[0:14] scripture to
[0:15] if we're honest to us of course but also
[0:18] very peculiar to denominations
[0:22] the sad part is though when it's
[0:23] procured to them they add to the word
[0:25] that's at the leadership of satan but
[0:27] the true
[0:29] church of the bride of jesus christ by
[0:31] the leadership of the holy ghost will
[0:32] not add anything to the word of god
[0:35] genesis 1 26 i'm still waiting on
[0:37] brother stephen for the memory verse
[0:39] that's fine he can just take his time
[0:41] by god's grace genesis 1 26 are we live
[0:43] now
[0:44] okay great praise the lord
[0:47] to our live streamers god bless you
[0:50] when i checked sunday i think we had 11
[0:51] views so
[0:52] there's 11 blessed souls out there that
[0:54] we're helping out by god's grace
[0:57] even helps one it's a blessing praise
[0:59] god
[1:00] but as i'm going to share hopefully the
[1:01] live streamers are listening i want to
[1:03] leave youtube by the end of the year i'm
[1:04] just going to leave youtube i don't want
[1:05] to support youtube i was looking up some
[1:07] facts and
[1:08] they just delete all the facts from the
[1:11] conservative side
[1:12] they just delete all of them like you
[1:14] you you look for truth on one side of
[1:15] the like the voting of the president
[1:17] trump how he lost if you look for the
[1:19] other side you won't even find it they
[1:21] youtube won't even let it come up
[1:23] they have their albums of their
[1:24] algorithms in their uh algorithms rather
[1:27] in the system and you can't even find
[1:28] truth on many subjects
[1:30] so
[1:31] i'm just going to be done with them i
[1:32] don't care just give me a few months ago
[1:34] it's going to take me a few months to
[1:35] research and kind of get over to the
[1:36] other platforms i'm not going to support
[1:38] that
[1:39] i know eventually they're going to shut
[1:40] us all off but i'm going to boycott them
[1:42] before they boycott me that's my
[1:43] attitude
[1:44] so praise god genesis 1 26
[1:49] as much as i can like i said i can't get
[1:50] away from amazon because they sell my
[1:53] books they print the books i can't get
[1:54] away from that quite yet so
[1:56] but all in good time if the lord tarries
[1:58] if not we'll be in heaven
[2:00] so that's what matters being with jesus
[2:02] praise god
[2:03] genesis 1 26.
[2:16] let's all read this together
[2:17] ready on three one two three
[2:20] and god said let us make man in our
[2:24] image after our likeness and let them
[2:27] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[2:30] and over the fowl of the air and over
[2:33] the cattle and over all the earth and
[2:36] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[2:39] upon the earth praise god

[4:34] amen god bless you being seated praise
[4:35] god
[4:37] i'm happy tonight just a little tired so
[4:39] see i'm a little slipping a little bit
[4:40] on some things so may the holy spirit
[4:42] help me i just want to be faithful
[4:45] i have just have a few visuals here i'll
[4:47] start with let's see i'll start with
[4:48] this one
[4:50] i kind of used some of my old slides but
[4:53] i kind of added some new ones so we'll
[4:56] look at let us make man in our image so
[4:59] uh in the chapter of chapter one with
[5:01] the godhead i started off
[5:03] uh by showing how god defines himself
[5:06] manifestations
[5:07] or forms not persons
[5:10] all right i'm just going to flip back
[5:11] here just to kind of get another review
[5:13] oh yeah then i showed the eight problems
[5:16] with the trinity doctrine plus the
[5:18] creeds
[5:19] uh and then all the manifestations last
[5:21] time we looked at modalism and the
[5:22] oneness move we're not modalists and
[5:25] we're not oneness by labels we're holy
[5:28] ghost-filled saints that believe god is
[5:30] one person praise god then we ended last
[5:32] wednesday with we showed the final
[5:34] mystery of the godhead is plural nouns
[5:36] and i believe it came from heaven to my
[5:39] opinion
[5:40] that god showed me that a noun is a
[5:42] person place or thing
[5:44] and a manifestation is not a person it's
[5:46] not a separate person from god it's a
[5:48] thing it's a mask of god
[5:51] and so that's why you can use a plural
[5:53] pronoun like us and our or we and it
[5:56] doesn't mean persons it can mean one
[5:58] person with other nouns
[6:01] right so that's just a simple
[6:03] a simple reason why god would use plural
[6:07] nouns with the godhead praise god
[6:10] because
[6:11] we know the son is a manifestation it's
[6:13] a visible
[6:14] appearing of the invisible person praise
[6:17] god now genesis 1 26 so now at the end
[6:20] of the chapter i go through all the
[6:21] mysterious scriptures that trinitarians
[6:23] use
[6:24] okay and then i close with is the sun
[6:26] eternal
[6:27] and then we uh then i close the chapter
[6:30] with that malcolm you have a question
[6:31] buddy okay let me know i'll be happy to
[6:32] help you guys if you have a question let
[6:33] me know
[6:34] i just didn't know if you had a question
[6:36] all right yeah let me know i can help
[6:37] you if you need
[6:38] anything all right
[6:40] uh so let us in genesis 1 26
[6:43] so again just by reading the scripture
[6:45] we never see
[6:47] god saying let all three of us persons
[6:49] make man
[6:50] right that would be adding to the word
[6:52] so trinitarians again add to the word
[6:55] now in the book i say it's important to
[6:57] look at the word make
[6:59] right because make uh means creation
[7:03] right
[7:04] let us make
[7:06] okay so uh if you go to malachi 2 10 i
[7:10] don't have it in front of me
[7:12] the whole thing but the bible says we
[7:14] have one father and one god created us
[7:18] so if if in one place it says let us
[7:20] make and another place
[7:22] it says one god then we know there's no
[7:25] contradiction right there has to be one
[7:27] person made
[7:29] man okay
[7:31] isaiah 44 24 i am going to read that
[7:34] because i put the whole thing in the
[7:35] book
[7:35] thus saith the lord thy redeemer he that
[7:38] form thee from the womb notice he
[7:40] he
[7:41] i am the lord that maketh all things
[7:44] that stretches forth the heavens alone
[7:47] so whoever stretched out the heavens was
[7:49] alone when he did it not with three
[7:51] persons
[7:53] he says uh that spreadeth abroad the
[7:56] earth by myself
[7:59] not with two other persons i spread
[8:01] forth the earth by myself
[8:04] okay so god alone forms humans in the
[8:07] womb right a mother's womb
[8:09] god alone stretch out the heavens and
[8:11] god did this all by himself not with
[8:13] three persons
[8:15] right so there's two possible meanings
[8:18] for let us there's two possible ones now
[8:20] brother brahm said this in 1953 now this
[8:23] is a pretty early sermon right but it's
[8:25] still a true revelation that he preaches
[8:28] and then he asks this question now let
[8:30] us who
[8:31] father and son
[8:33] make man in our image
[8:35] right so brother man says it's father
[8:38] and son okay which i believe that's
[8:40] definitely one of the possibilities i
[8:42] believe there's two possibilities okay
[8:44] now let's look at the first one it's not
[8:46] this one but the first one is let us
[8:49] could we could refer to god and the
[8:51] angels
[8:53] because there's other scriptures where
[8:55] god talks about us and the angels and
[8:58] only god does something
[9:00] okay so you can't you can't uh you can't
[9:03] leave this one out this is a real strong
[9:05] possibility sometimes god is just
[9:07] speaking for heaven let us do things
[9:09] right in other words angels will be
[9:11] witnesses when god makes man
[9:14] right
[9:15] because there's examples in the bible so
[9:17] let's go to genesis 11. and i'm just
[9:19] going to teach this slowly so the kids
[9:20] will know it because if the lord tarries
[9:22] they're gonna have to have to answer
[9:23] these questions someday
[9:25] one of their friends uh one of their one
[9:27] of their friends will leave the message
[9:28] and they'll say what about genesis 1 26
[9:30] and that god's a trinity and then
[9:32] they'll have the answers it'll be
[9:33] written on their heart on the fleshy
[9:35] tables of their hearts and hopefully the
[9:36] book will be there too if the lord
[9:37] tarries we'll see
[9:39] uh genesis 11
[9:41] 6 7 8 9.
[9:44] okay so at the at the tower of babel
[9:47] uh
[9:48] up in heaven god saw it
[9:52] and go to verse 7. he said go to let us
[9:54] go down and there confound their
[9:57] language that they may not understand
[9:58] one another's speech
[10:00] so the lord scattered them abroad upon
[10:02] the face of the earth over i'm sorry the
[10:04] face of all the earth and they left off
[10:06] to build the city
[10:08] okay now look church
[10:13] it looks like here
[10:14] yeah if you go down to verse 9 therefore
[10:16] is the name of the city called babel
[10:18] because the lord did confound the
[10:20] language of the earth
[10:22] okay
[10:23] and from thence did the lord scatter
[10:25] them abroad upon the face of the earth
[10:27] okay so he says let us confound their
[10:29] language but it only records god doing
[10:32] it
[10:33] doesn't record
[10:34] anybody else just god but he says let us
[10:37] right it doesn't say the lord plus the
[10:40] second lord it don't say the lord plus
[10:42] the second and third person
[10:44] it just says the lord right
[10:46] now
[10:47] it's possible it's likely that god came
[10:50] with angels to scatter and confound men
[10:53] right
[10:54] uh just like god and two angels came
[10:57] comes down later in genesis chapter 18
[11:00] and 19
[11:01] right god comes down with two angels
[11:03] right the two angels go to sodom god
[11:05] said ain't going down there i ain't
[11:07] going down to the foolish virgin i'm
[11:08] saying with the elect
[11:10] i'm going to discern the thoughts and
[11:11] intents of their hearts say amen i'm
[11:13] saying with the elect
[11:15] so
[11:15] again it looks as if god said let us do
[11:18] it so god and angels come down and
[11:20] confound the language of the people
[11:22] that's what it looks like
[11:24] okay but it never says two persons or
[11:27] three persons in the godhead did this so
[11:29] we can't add to the word now go to
[11:31] isaiah 8 verse 1 isaiah 8 verse 1.
[11:36] isaiah 8. so in the mouth of what two or
[11:38] three witnesses i'm giving you two
[11:41] witnesses along with genesis 1 26 where
[11:44] god can say let us and it can mean one
[11:47] person
[11:48] never means
[11:50] two or three persons in the godhead it
[11:52] never says that
[11:59] okay isaiah chapter 8
[12:09] one through eight
[12:16] all right now you know i think i wrote
[12:17] down the wrong scripture in the book
[12:20] i have to fix that
[12:23] oh it's isaiah 6. there's a mistake okay
[12:26] a typo let me write that down
[12:28] typo sorry it's
[12:30] it's page
[12:31] 40.
[12:34] i'm sorry well bible scholars will know
[12:37] what i'm talking about i mean anyone who
[12:38] said the bible so forgive me i right now
[12:40] i have about seven mistakes i've already
[12:42] found uh after the 200 i've already
[12:44] corrected so
[12:45] writing is no easy task
[12:48] especially for a simple man like me a
[12:50] simple brain man like me okay verse one
[12:53] uh chapter six verse one my goodness
[12:54] forgive me lord
[12:56] okay
[12:57] uh in the year that king uzziah died i i
[12:59] saw also the lord sitting on a throne he
[13:02] didn't say lord sitting on thrones he
[13:04] said one lord on one throne
[13:07] high lifted up and the train for this
[13:09] temple and above it said the seraphims
[13:10] each one had six wings twain he covered
[13:12] his face with twain he covered his feet
[13:14] in which twenty did fly see there are
[13:15] six six is a good number church
[13:18] now when man fails six is a bad number
[13:20] but satan perverts it right but it's a
[13:21] good number right six wings right that's
[13:24] anointed man
[13:26] okay and one cried unto the other and
[13:27] said holy holy holy so lord god lord of
[13:29] hosts the whoreth is full of his glory
[13:32] i'm going to skip down you know the
[13:34] story he said woe unto me i'm a man of
[13:35] unclean lips
[13:37] uh go down to verse eight it's where
[13:38] we're going and i als and i heard the
[13:40] voice i'm sorry also i heard the voice
[13:42] of the lord saying whom shall i send and
[13:44] who will go for us
[13:46] then said ah here am i send me so here
[13:50] we have one god on one throne he said
[13:52] who will go down for us
[13:54] he needs someone to preach
[13:56] but they're gonna be preaching for us in
[13:59] heaven but there's only one man on one
[14:01] god on the throne that was the lord
[14:03] jehovah praise god or this case yeah it
[14:04] was jehovah
[14:06] okay
[14:07] so we see the bible never speaks of
[14:09] three there's only one sitting on the
[14:11] throne that's yahweh and god was gonna
[14:14] cleanse israel through isaiah so us must
[14:18] refer to god and the seraphims amen
[14:21] it must who will go for us right
[14:24] because isaiah's preaching ministry was
[14:27] a warning from god and god always sends
[14:30] angels for warnings
[14:32] who did god send to balaam to warn him
[14:34] church the angel and he stopped the
[14:37] donkey remember that between that short
[14:38] straight straight way who'd he send it
[14:40] to warn him an angel so who's going to
[14:43] warn israel god's going to send isaiah
[14:45] and angels to warn them praise god
[14:48] so see let us in now three cases can
[14:51] mean god and the angels working together
[14:53] and the church said
[14:55] that is one possibility now the other
[14:57] possibility is this one just the simple
[15:00] this is an old slide so before day one
[15:02] before god started creating there was
[15:04] the logos
[15:06] [Music]
[15:07] okay i'm trying to skip past the
[15:08] illustrations okay because i think i
[15:10] showed this on sunday did i not
[15:12] the sun made everything so before day
[15:14] one before god created you know the sun
[15:16] and the moon and all these things
[15:18] the sun makes everything the sun makes
[15:20] light time space matter everything
[15:23] therefore you cannot have light time or
[15:25] days without first having the sun
[15:27] because the sun is the word
[15:29] before god was just silent all of a
[15:30] sudden he said let there be that was the
[15:33] word coming forth praise god
[15:35] let there be light and then he said let
[15:37] there be this and let there be that
[15:39] so the logos came out first praise god
[15:44] all right now
[15:45] that means the father
[15:47] created through the son the word
[15:50] okay
[15:51] so let us so now it's more than so once
[15:54] the light comes out and then the light
[15:55] starts talking now god now the father
[15:58] and son are working together
[16:00] because the angels when the angels are
[16:02] there the angels start seeing the light
[16:03] do things now it's the father and son
[16:06] working together
[16:07] right so let us make man what what day
[16:10] was that day six right
[16:12] so there was already angels there was
[16:13] already heavens and earth and and beasts
[16:17] and file of the air and all those things
[16:20] so when he said let us it could mean
[16:22] father and son right
[16:24] it could mean that as well no doubt it
[16:26] did so it may mean both of these
[16:29] it may mean let us can mean angels and
[16:31] let us of course means the father and
[16:33] his word
[16:35] but because that word has a
[16:36] manifestation it's a noun it's a it it's
[16:39] a thing
[16:40] right
[16:41] god's dwelling in that light but god is
[16:43] not the light god's dwelling in the
[16:44] light
[16:45] just like the bible says god dwells in
[16:47] the light the father draws in the light
[16:50] okay so
[16:51] uh let us
[16:53] could be father invisible and visible
[16:56] praise god
[16:57] all right so i hope that's a blessing
[16:58] and i got another one here
[17:00] yeah so genesis 1 26 i just have a few
[17:03] things i i wish i i should have removed
[17:06] these silly illustrations but these
[17:08] okay so let us make means the invisible
[17:11] father use his word the son or the logos
[17:14] the living word to create
[17:17] the father makes or creates using his
[17:19] word see ephesians 3 9. so i'll read
[17:22] that for you ephesians 3 9. i'll just
[17:24] quickly get there
[17:26] such i just love how the bible hides the
[17:28] revelation all through the bible that's
[17:30] why the bible said you got to search the
[17:31] scriptures daily praise god it's not
[17:33] just all laid out specifically it's got
[17:36] to be hidden because then those who
[17:37] really want to find it will go searching
[17:39] and finding it
[17:40] those who really want treasure will go
[17:42] looking for it
[17:43] then there'll be no excuses on the day
[17:44] of judgment ephesians 3 9
[17:47] and to make all men see what is the
[17:49] fellowship or the intimacy or
[17:51] partnership of the mystery
[17:53] from which the beginning i'm sorry which
[17:55] from the beginning of the world has been
[17:57] hidden god who created all things by
[18:00] jesus christ the son
[18:02] so all things were created by the word
[18:06] by the logos we'd say praise god the the
[18:09] the word that came out of invisible
[18:11] father
[18:12] all right now let me see what i got next
[18:14] oh yeah
[18:15] so when when god said let us he's saying
[18:18] let let me and my mask create all things
[18:23] let let my mask and eye for gra
[18:26] grammarly correct let let me and my mask
[18:30] create man let us do it
[18:33] right because that's what the angels
[18:34] were going to see the angels are going
[18:35] to see
[18:36] god
[18:37] visible holy spirit logos create man
[18:41] right he's gonna do it on the earth
[18:43] okay
[18:45] so there are your two
[18:48] explanations it never says three persons
[18:50] are creators the bible never says and
[18:53] all three persons created man it never
[18:55] says that
[18:56] but let us can mean father and son or
[18:59] father
[19:00] lo god father son and angels it could
[19:02] mean that as well
[19:03] and that's in the book so you got that
[19:05] so god creates by his word he created by
[19:08] speaking just like you and i create our
[19:11] future by speaking to
[19:13] praise god
[19:14] how do you speak it well i'm going to be
[19:16] faithful to jesus all the days of my
[19:18] life there's a prophecy right there
[19:20] i'm going to go i'm going to grow deeper
[19:21] in love with jesus all the days of my
[19:23] life there's a prophecy right there i'm
[19:25] going to walk into that brother william
[19:27] i'm going to remain faithful my whole
[19:29] life to the lord jesus christ by the
[19:31] grace of god that's a prophecy i'm
[19:33] speaking that into existence by the word
[19:35] of
[19:36] god amen
[19:40] all right
[19:41] so are your words separate persons from
[19:44] you no they're expressions of your
[19:47] person they're a manifestation of your
[19:49] thoughts and that's what christ was to
[19:52] god he wasn't a separate person he was
[19:54] an expression of the character of god he
[19:57] was the vic jesus was the image of the
[19:59] invisible god
[20:01] amen
[20:02] jesus was god's thought expressed
[20:06] all right now
[20:09] so you can see the father and son though
[20:11] shared one image
[20:13] right not two there wasn't two images
[20:16] there there was one image so it
[20:18] represents one person with multiple
[20:21] manifestations
[20:23] all right pardon me
[20:25] let me skip here i don't know what i got
[20:26] on this one what did i have on this one
[20:28] this might be a repeat
[20:33] i can't i can't see my preview okay yeah
[20:35] so the us and let us make must be used
[20:38] because the light is a separate
[20:40] manifestation from the father
[20:43] the light is a noun or a thing so it's
[20:46] capital i it needs a pronoun it's a
[20:49] logos it's got divinity inside it
[20:51] it's not a separate co-equal person
[20:54] though
[20:55] right
[20:57] okay does that help with genesis 1 26
[20:59] does that help anybody
[21:01] okay i hope so just remember even if it
[21:03] don't church that's okay but just tell
[21:05] people genesis 1 26 doesn't say three
[21:08] persons
[21:09] so it can't mean that
[21:11] it don't mean three gods and a real
[21:13] child of god will never add to god's
[21:15] pure word
[21:17] if you respect god and love god you
[21:18] would never add to a holy god's word
[21:21] praise god all right go to your bibles
[21:23] go to matthew 28 19. now the next
[21:25] section i go to is matthew 28 19.
[21:28] yep i got the mask okay and the
[21:30] invisible father
[21:32] okay as you're turning there matthew 20
[21:34] 19 uh again just a reminder for you a
[21:36] visual for the kids so
[21:38] uh
[21:39] some of the younger ones you know karis
[21:41] nature virtue
[21:42] victoria's got a big smile on her face
[21:44] jen you might catch at this service jen
[21:46] you might catch it
[21:47] the logos or the word of this is the
[21:49] logos of the word of god the very first
[21:51] light in the beginning
[21:53] it's also called the anointing
[21:55] right
[21:56] because that's the anointing is the
[21:58] messiah the power
[22:00] it's also called the theophany of god
[22:02] it's also called the son of god before
[22:05] he came in flesh
[22:06] and it's also a visible form of the holy
[22:09] spirit
[22:10] okay but the invisible form of the holy
[22:12] spirit is god the father
[22:14] okay
[22:15] so maybe that'll maybe they'll catch
[22:16] that revelation today and then they'll
[22:17] never have any questions
[22:19] for the rest of their lives by god's
[22:20] grace amen
[22:23] okay i'm doing that blinky thing i'm not
[22:25] sure why i did that okay
[22:27] all right now we'll get to this now
[22:28] matthew 20 19. go ye therefore teach all
[22:31] nations baptizing them in the names did
[22:34] i say that right names
[22:36] no it's not multiple names there's one
[22:39] name of the father and of the son
[22:43] and of the holy ghost
[22:46] this is the most
[22:47] commonly used proof of the trinity but
[22:50] it doesn't say names for separate
[22:52] persons there's one name this actually
[22:55] reveals that god has one name and many
[22:57] titles
[23:00] hallelujah that's what it actually
[23:02] reveals praise god
[23:05] and it also says it also reveals there's
[23:07] one name to be called on
[23:10] at jesus or at a believer's baptism
[23:13] there's one name to call upon praise god
[23:16] jesus did not say names he said there's
[23:18] one singular name god is one person he
[23:22] has one name ten days after jesus said
[23:25] father son holy ghost peter said jesus
[23:28] christ shortly after that uh chapter
[23:31] eight would have been uh
[23:36] james and john
[23:37] no
[23:38] philip yeah philip said lord jesus sorry
[23:41] and then peter said lord right which
[23:43] would have been jesus christ lord jesus
[23:44] christ and then uh
[23:46] paul said lord jesus and then paul said
[23:48] i was buried in the name of the lord
[23:50] so if you put those three together
[23:52] father son holy ghost is what it's what
[23:54] name is it
[23:56] all right let's say it again the
[23:57] father's the holy ghost name is
[23:59] lord jesus christ and anybody that can
[24:01] look at this and can't admit that is
[24:03] blind on purpose
[24:06] because there's no excuses on the day of
[24:08] judgment the bible never offers father
[24:10] son holy ghost in the book of acts or
[24:12] beyond
[24:13] right it's never even found to about 100
[24:15] years 80 70 years after jesus christ
[24:19] said fathers and holy ghosts you'll
[24:20] never find it
[24:21] okay so it's a false doctrine we know
[24:24] that but thank god jesus gave the
[24:26] revelation to peter praise god that he
[24:28] had the revelation that the name of the
[24:30] father son and holy ghost is the lord
[24:32] jesus christ amen now philip and paul
[24:35] also you use the lord jesus the
[24:37] preachers had complete unity that's what
[24:39] i love that's when i know the holy
[24:41] spirit's here when preachers start
[24:42] having unity amen when we can get our
[24:45] ideas together and lay aside our
[24:46] differences and all get down to what the
[24:49] word of god says then we know we got
[24:50] real holy spirit unity
[24:53] that's what i feel with randy you know
[24:54] when randy came i've always thought that
[24:56] about the squeeze i've always thought
[24:57] people have overblown the squeeze like
[24:59] we're going to be we're going to be
[25:00] saying i need a car i'm going to speak a
[25:02] scar i'm going to speak a car i need a
[25:04] stake i'm going to speak a stake into
[25:05] existence like silliness like that i've
[25:07] always thought that so when randy come
[25:09] and he said that i said praise the lord
[25:11] now we may have to speak some things
[25:12] church but that's not a guarantee
[25:14] right we're not looking for the rapture
[25:17] just so we can do miracles we're looking
[25:19] for the rapture to escape the the
[25:21] tribulation and to meet our lord to be a
[25:24] part of our wedding
[25:27] i've already been married once but
[25:28] there's that's a great that was a great
[25:30] day but i'm looking for another wedding
[25:32] day amen
[25:33] i don't know yeah i'm looking for the
[25:35] greatest wedding day there ever could be
[25:36] praise god jesus christ and his misses
[25:41] my
[25:42] and you'll never find anyone ever being
[25:46] buried or sprinkled with the titles
[25:47] father son
[25:49] and holy ghost
[25:52] all right now
[25:54] i for some reason brother william i only
[25:56] put five of these historical references
[25:59] in the book but now i'm gonna switch
[26:00] over and show you i got 14. i don't know
[26:02] why i didn't put
[26:04] all 14 in the book so you have to
[26:05] forgive me here
[26:07] i don't know what i was
[26:08] it's just been two and a half years it's
[26:09] been too long i can't remember all the
[26:11] things i was thinking i should have
[26:12] wrote it down or something
[26:13] okay here's here's source number one oh
[26:15] can i make that bigger
[26:17] okay
[26:18] i guess i can okay so the first source
[26:21] and so brother when we first come in the
[26:23] message here's what we did we were in
[26:24] college you know what we did
[26:26] we went into the libraries on our
[26:28] weekends and we would just look in the
[26:29] religious we go up to the floors my wife
[26:31] and i and we go looking in the religious
[26:33] encyclopedias trying to prove that
[26:35] baptism was right in the name of the
[26:36] lord though we had some dates like that
[26:38] we that was like a real fun date i'm
[26:40] sure for my wife that was really fun
[26:42] yeah being with me in a library i'm sure
[26:44] that's a lot of fun
[26:45] yeah looking for looking for historical
[26:47] records but simon went and scott overmar
[26:49] went he's since left the message but he
[26:51] i think he found this one if i'm not
[26:53] mistaken or but he found a couple and
[26:55] then he left the message it's so sad but
[26:57] we love bro scott if he's listening
[26:59] anyway praise god but this first one
[27:01] says
[27:03] baptism was practiced
[27:05] by the earliest christian groups
[27:07] at first only adults were baptized by
[27:10] immersion and in christ's name only in
[27:12] the second century
[27:13] baptism was done in the name of the holy
[27:15] trinity and then
[27:17] infant baptism followed
[27:19] so that means for 70 years they only use
[27:22] christ's name
[27:24] and no infants and no sprinkling
[27:27] and this ain't even a message book
[27:28] brother
[27:30] this this ain't a message book this is
[27:32] just a common encyclopedia
[27:35] it's called the new standard
[27:37] encyclopedia they got all kinds of
[27:38] eating sinners in there they don't care
[27:40] acacia
[27:42] it might thank you that's a good idea
[27:46] all right thank you
[27:48] that's my girl
[27:51] okay here's a zoomed in version just so
[27:53] you can see it now i made this about 10
[27:55] years ago and i thought when will i ever
[27:56] use this well today's the day today's
[27:58] the day now i've shared with other
[28:00] people but you know i've always wondered
[28:01] when am i going to use this
[28:03] okay second one
[28:06] this is from encyclopedia of early
[28:08] christianity
[28:11] they say the the triune baptism is
[28:14] frequently attested in the second
[28:16] century not the first
[28:19] they even admit that now i think i found
[28:21] this one yeah because that's my
[28:22] handwriting see look at my nice
[28:23] handwriting there look at that
[28:24] i remember right now
[28:26] so there's the picture
[28:30] okay
[28:31] so that's two out of 14. here's number
[28:33] three this says the evidence of acts 2
[28:36] 20 238 1048 now that's just what i just
[28:39] showed you there supported by galatians
[28:41] 3 27 romans 6 3 suggests baptism in
[28:44] early christianity was not in the three
[28:46] full name but in the name of the
[28:49] jesus christ
[28:51] so here's the actual version of it i got
[28:53] all my can i say like this i got all my
[28:54] receipts sister naomi
[28:56] but william i brought all my receipts
[28:58] with me tonight
[29:02] i got proof in other words you can you
[29:04] can say whatever you want but you can't
[29:05] argue with the bible and with history
[29:08] unless you got dirty history but we got
[29:09] the right history number four this one
[29:12] oxford dictionary says
[29:14] the title fathers and holy ghost was at
[29:15] least from the end of the first century
[29:17] so about 100 years after christ
[29:19] some of the passages speak in the name
[29:21] of the lord jesus so here it is
[29:24] end of the first so that's about 100 a.d
[29:29] and uh the the didache that's an old
[29:31] scroll they found from about 100 a.d
[29:33] where they said they baptized in the
[29:34] titles fathers in the legos so we have
[29:36] at least 70 years of no witnesses of
[29:38] fathers and holy ghost
[29:40] number five this is the handbook of
[29:42] church history
[29:43] this says the baptism of christians was
[29:45] carried out in the name of the lord
[29:46] jesus christ unequivocally so without
[29:48] doubt without question
[29:51] for the forgiveness of your sins ah i
[29:53] feel forgiven tonight amen
[29:55] there's the there's the reference
[29:56] there's my receipts right there
[29:58] now look at this brother look at this it
[29:59] even says the reception so receiving the
[30:02] holy spirit was also in some way bound
[30:05] up with baptism
[30:06] so in other words if you get the right
[30:08] baptism you get born again amen
[30:11] hallelujah that's why those trinitarians
[30:13] don't get born again because they're not
[30:15] associated with the name of god
[30:18] they got his titles but not his name
[30:22] although it's not quite clear it's
[30:23] because they don't have the mysteries of
[30:25] god that's why it's not clear but with
[30:27] us it's clear we've got the mysteries of
[30:29] god
[30:30] now i don't mean to bore you i hope i'm
[30:31] not boring with these but i just want to
[30:33] show them to you the cat now look the
[30:35] catholic encyclopedia
[30:39] some they say some theologians have held
[30:42] that the apostles baptized in the name
[30:44] of christ only
[30:46] they won't admit it but at least they
[30:47] acknowledge it
[30:50] and there it is
[30:52] a catholic encyclopedia said they
[30:54] baptized in the name of christ only
[30:57] oh well maybe they maybe the apostles
[31:00] only baptized in the name maybe
[31:02] well how do you know look in the bible
[31:05] you silly goose i'd say
[31:06] look in the bible
[31:08] right
[31:09] all you gotta do is look in the bible
[31:11] those are god's instructions to get to
[31:13] heaven
[31:15] i got a little echo i love this one i
[31:17] think brother simon found this in the
[31:18] time magazine brother william from 19
[31:20] and what was this sorry i'm going 1955.
[31:23] look at that wow 10 years before
[31:25] brotherham died they had it in the time
[31:27] magazine
[31:29] and it talks about a man being baptized
[31:31] and they actually have the literal words
[31:33] that the man said he said marcus i
[31:35] baptize you in the name of the lord
[31:37] jesus in rome
[31:39] in rome
[31:40] a hundred years after christ remember
[31:42] rome by the by i think it was by i'll
[31:46] have to preach i'll preach at the next
[31:47] mystery with the seven church ages but i
[31:49] think it was either in the the 30s or
[31:51] 40s a.d
[31:52] after christ the first church of rome
[31:54] had already got polluted
[31:57] so they had to start a second church of
[31:58] rome that was a good church
[32:00] so i wonder if this was from the second
[32:02] church of rome or the third church of
[32:03] rome okay
[32:05] so there's there there's the reference
[32:06] now that was the most blurry one i've
[32:08] got because it's so i've copied it so
[32:10] many times i gotta ask simon for the
[32:12] original copy
[32:14] but yeah that's from 1955.
[32:17] number eight is from
[32:18] the interpreter's bible
[32:21] the distinctive christian formula of
[32:24] baptism is in the name of jesus christ
[32:27] there's no trace of the trinitarian
[32:29] formula
[32:32] in the early church but it comes from
[32:33] liturgical use which means the
[32:35] nominational use
[32:38] in other words you don't find fathers in
[32:39] holy ghost so you get the denominations
[32:42] now for some reason i didn't highlight
[32:43] that so i'm sorry about that
[32:47] oh yeah it comes well it's right here
[32:48] comes from laid or liturgical use so
[32:50] they even admit you don't get father son
[32:52] holy ghost so after the apostles died
[32:54] and these denominational men and women
[32:56] started rising up there with their
[32:57] creeds and dogmas
[33:00] number nine uh the encyclopedia
[33:02] britannica
[33:04] the trinitarian formula and triumph were
[33:06] not used from the beginning
[33:09] why can't they see that if jesus said it
[33:12] wasn't so from the beginning praise god
[33:14] so what did jesus always say he said go
[33:16] back to the beginning praise god
[33:18] in that case go back to genesis but in
[33:20] this case go back to the day of
[33:22] pentecost amen when it all started why
[33:24] can't they see that because they're
[33:25] blind by their own sins
[33:32] now look it even says here in the second
[33:35] century
[33:36] no by the third century
[33:38] i'm sorry ah i forgot to turn off my
[33:41] internet here sorry
[33:43] goodness gracious
[33:46] let me set a timer here so i don't
[33:47] forget okay i
[33:49] i got to get some sleep tonight so
[33:51] here
[33:53] okay there it is again so blurry i'm
[33:54] sorry that's the best copy i could have
[33:57] number 10 the dictionary of bible and
[33:58] religion says in the name of jesus as a
[34:02] formula suggests passing under the
[34:03] lordship amen who's your lord is the
[34:07] trinity of your lord is three persons
[34:09] your lord or is the one person of god
[34:11] your lord
[34:12] see it just shows they are serving uh
[34:15] multiple gods
[34:16] right
[34:17] they bow down and kiss mary i mean they
[34:19] they serve lots of gods not just fathers
[34:21] and holy ghosts they got mary and other
[34:22] saints they worship
[34:24] right
[34:26] at a later time the baptism was a
[34:28] minister in the name of the trinity
[34:32] later time not from the beginning from
[34:35] the beginning it was not so
[34:37] so children i hope you're paying
[34:38] attention so malcolm one day he's gonna
[34:40] i think he's gonna grow up and debate
[34:41] people about this malachi i did a lot of
[34:43] work for you but hey you can find some
[34:44] more work too buddy there's a lot more
[34:46] libraries out there he can go looking
[34:48] you too lydia
[34:50] you ever go to college or anything like
[34:51] well go to the college library
[34:53] all right uh the history or doc the
[34:56] history of dogma what a book huh the
[34:58] history of dogma
[34:59] [Music]
[35:01] what a sad book brother
[35:04] they felt compelled to oppose the custom
[35:06] of baptizing
[35:08] in the name of jesus they opposed
[35:11] see the catholic church opposes us in
[35:13] the name of jesus let's use the safer
[35:15] version father there ain't nothing more
[35:16] safer than the name of jesus
[35:20] right so there it is a little again a
[35:21] little blurry i'm sorry you know i
[35:24] i i scanned them i put them in the
[35:26] scanner i did the best i could that's
[35:27] that's just the best we got after all
[35:29] these 20 some years of it's gonna be 20
[35:31] years yeah 20 years 2001.
[35:34] number 12 the history of christian
[35:36] doctrine it says at the ons outset in
[35:39] the apostolic age baptism was in the
[35:41] shorter name or form the name of christ
[35:44] now of course it's lord jesus christ but
[35:47] at least they admit it's in the name
[35:50] i didn't highlight that one that's a
[35:52] pretty good copy
[35:54] now look
[35:55] look at this they they start saying you
[35:58] had to be baptized to be admitted into
[36:00] the eucharist
[36:01] which is their bread and wine that they
[36:03] say is the literal body and blood of the
[36:05] lord liars
[36:06] liars so see they're mixing in some
[36:08] truth with with their lives in these
[36:10] catholic dogma books which makes sense
[36:12] it's dogma
[36:14] okay the outline of the
[36:16] an outline of the theology of the new
[36:18] testament
[36:20] it's a true saying that people
[36:22] were baptized in the person in the name
[36:24] of jesus the oldest baptismal formula
[36:27] has one member so see
[36:30] they're saying the oldest baptism was
[36:32] done in the name of the lord jesus
[36:33] christ
[36:34] instead of the father and the holy ghost
[36:38] and that was okay i don't think i found
[36:40] that when that one wasn't me
[36:43] okay last one everybody take a deep
[36:44] breath ready
[36:46] the anchor bible i was telling my kids
[36:47] all day that kind of resets your mind
[36:49] the anchor bible it seems plain from the
[36:52] early material in acts that baptism was
[36:54] in the into the name of jesus as lord
[36:57] and messiah and there you got two of
[36:59] them well i'm sorry yeah lord lord jesus
[37:01] christ yeah lord there you got it lord
[37:03] jesus christ
[37:05] all right
[37:07] and that was yeah again very sorry sorry
[37:10] okay
[37:12] what do i got after that okay
[37:14] oh and then and then we have prophetic
[37:16] evidence
[37:18] do i have that
[37:19] okay i don't have the quote
[37:21] but anyways we have prophetic evidence
[37:35] okay i was um i thought i had the quote
[37:37] where brother branham said
[37:40] thus saith the lord oh yeah here it is
[37:42] i'm sorry my fault here's where i was
[37:43] going to forgive me
[37:45] thus saith the lord the baptism using
[37:46] the title father son holy ghost is false
[37:50] thus saith the lord now look at this i
[37:51] command every one of you on here or on
[37:54] tape that's been baptized in the name of
[37:55] jesus christ i'm sorry that hasn't been
[37:57] baptized in the name of jesus christ be
[37:59] baptized again in the name of jesus
[38:01] christ and the church said amen
[38:03] now church based upon the bible and
[38:05] history which is the right baptism is it
[38:07] father son holy ghost or is it lord
[38:09] jesus christ
[38:11] it's lord jesus christ there's not one
[38:13] speck or shred of evidence for the
[38:17] trinity lie
[38:18] it was that leaven hidden three measures
[38:21] a meal that grew up into all this false
[38:23] document thank god we've got a
[38:25] unleavened bread today amen hallelujah
[38:28] in other words we've got sincerity we've
[38:31] got truth like paul said we've got the
[38:33] real word of god hallelujah
[38:36] i'm going to leave that up there just
[38:37] because i don't think i have any other
[38:37] slides okay so i'm going to leave that
[38:39] up there
[38:40] all right now uh give me about 15
[38:42] minutes here by god's grace
[38:44] so in the book i tell people be
[38:46] re-baptized if you were in the wrong
[38:47] baptism i said don't be ashamed of that
[38:49] they re-baptized in acts chapter 19
[38:51] right they were under the john's baptism
[38:54] paul baptized them because they wanted
[38:56] the holy ghost because the holy ghost is
[38:57] connected to the right water baptism
[39:00] amen
[39:01] now here's how i was baptized in in 1996
[39:05] i was baptized in the title's father-son
[39:07] holy ghost because i i loved god to some
[39:09] degree i knew god was real i wasn't
[39:11] serving him but i wanted to get my uh my
[39:14] youth teacher off my back
[39:16] so i said okay i'll go to the baptism
[39:18] class and i was baptized as holy ghost i
[39:20] felt good but as soon as i went out i
[39:22] turned on the rock and roll and i just
[39:23] went back into sin i mean it didn't even
[39:25] last five minutes you know because it
[39:26] was my heart wasn't right
[39:28] okay then when i hear brother brandon
[39:29] fast forward to 2002
[39:32] it's like january february 2002
[39:35] i'm like oh i need to be re-baptized
[39:39] so i called up the apostolic oneness
[39:41] church in akron i said can you baptize
[39:43] me in lord jesus christ he's like yeah
[39:45] so i went over that i said praise the
[39:46] lord and he said okay i now baptize you
[39:49] in the name of jesus and as i'm going
[39:51] down i'm like oh no i wanted lord jesus
[39:53] christ
[39:55] and i come up and they're like uh and i
[39:57] was too i was too ashamed to have him
[39:59] baptize me again because sometimes i'm
[40:02] too chicken-hearted you know i'll just
[40:03] say it yeah sometimes i'm i don't like
[40:05] confrontation right but as i was going
[40:07] down with him i'm like oh no it's the
[40:09] wrong baptism i'm not a jesus only
[40:12] so i called up brother simon i'm excited
[40:14] what should i do he's like come over to
[40:15] lima brother brooks will baptize you the
[40:17] right way
[40:19] so one weekend i drove over there on the
[40:21] saturday
[40:22] and he buried me in the lord jesus
[40:24] christ i've never been the same since
[40:26] after that time brother since that time
[40:28] i've never said a cuss word since that
[40:29] time
[40:30] because the name of jesus christ is like
[40:33] bleach and it starts washing you praise
[40:35] god
[40:36] hallelujah the blood of jesus christ the
[40:38] repentance right through genuine
[40:39] repentance he starts washing you you get
[40:42] washed by the waters of that's one thing
[40:44] i noticed immediately after that i could
[40:46] never say such a dirty word again
[40:49] what was that that was the anointing of
[40:50] the holy ghost coming on me amen
[40:54] hallelujah so that's my humble story i
[40:56] always tell people don't feel bad i've
[40:57] been baptized three times i don't care
[40:59] if you've been baptized brother man i
[41:00] said don't matter if you've been
[41:01] baptized 50 times the main thing to do
[41:03] is repent and then get the holy ghost
[41:05] amen
[41:06] hallelujah the man said they can baptize
[41:09] you 50 times front words face words
[41:11] sprinkle pour a gallon of oil on you but
[41:13] if you don't repent it's not going to do
[41:15] any good
[41:17] it's a outward expression of the inward
[41:20] work of grace that's happened in our
[41:21] hearts
[41:23] all right
[41:25] now here's what some
[41:27] liars have told me brother william
[41:30] they've told me
[41:32] first they said jesus's words have more
[41:34] weight than the apostles
[41:37] so you should use father son holy ghost
[41:41] i said you devil
[41:42] that's what i said up here i didn't say
[41:44] it out loud
[41:46] well that i mean it's true jesus's words
[41:48] were infallible but there they have
[41:51] man-made reasoning and it fails for
[41:54] three reasons
[41:56] the first is that jesus's apostles had
[41:59] jesus's spirit in their souls
[42:03] and jesus said when you get my spirit in
[42:05] you it'll lead you into all truth
[42:08] not some
[42:10] you won't have some truth but you'll
[42:11] have the false baptism come on what kind
[42:13] of lie is that amen these guys had the
[42:16] keys to the kingdom praise god they were
[42:19] opening the door to heaven hallelujah
[42:22] they had to have the key and that key
[42:24] was the name hallelujah
[42:28] repentance through the name
[42:32] these liars
[42:33] they're deceivers
[42:37] second
[42:39] this argument forces jesus and his
[42:42] apostles as enemies it makes them
[42:44] enemies
[42:45] well i'd rather have jesus than peter
[42:48] philip
[42:49] and james john and all these guys how
[42:52] sad that they want to create only the
[42:54] devil glory only the devil to put
[42:57] division between jesus and his sheep
[42:59] amen
[43:00] only the devil tried to put division
[43:02] between the shepherd and the sheep but
[43:04] jesus said when you get the holy ghost
[43:06] he said we are one amen as the father's
[43:09] in me and i and you and you and me
[43:12] praise god amen on sunday night praise
[43:15] god
[43:17] oh thank the lord
[43:19] now this is the one thing brother i
[43:21] didn't preach this
[43:22] before i wrote the book that's the one
[43:23] regret i have because see i could have
[43:25] added some of these thoughts that are
[43:26] coming fresh
[43:28] but i just had to get it out so but the
[43:30] nice thing is i can always make the
[43:32] second edition
[43:34] i got to fix some of these scriptures
[43:35] too right like isaiah 8 i got to make it
[43:37] isaiah 6.
[43:40] that's right so i want to be mindful of
[43:42] that at least it's out there at least
[43:43] it's helping people already
[43:46] all right now third and finally
[43:50] the third reason
[43:52] to say i'm taking jesus over the
[43:54] apostles it means you're cutting all the
[43:57] acts examples out of the bible you might
[44:00] as well rip out the book of acts and
[44:02] leave out the book of acts a bunch of
[44:05] devils is what they're doing they might
[44:06] as well take their
[44:07] their exacto knife and cut that out we
[44:10] don't need that church the thing is we
[44:12] need more of the word of god amen we
[44:14] don't need less of the word we need all
[44:16] the word it's only satan that would take
[44:18] away the book of acts hallelujah oh
[44:21] that's the throne of god amen you've got
[44:23] matthew mark luke john right but what's
[44:26] what's x acts is the throne acts is the
[44:29] presence of god amen only the devil want
[44:32] to take away the presence of god
[44:34] oh let them have this angels and
[44:36] seraphims all they want
[44:37] but don't don't let them have the prince
[44:39] of god oh no we're different we want the
[44:41] angels and we want the ark of the
[44:43] covenant we want the presence of christ
[44:47] glory
[44:48] there's kind of echo in here
[44:50] praise the lord well
[44:52] maybe heaven's backing me up then is
[44:53] that what that means
[44:55] i'm feeling pretty good tonight but
[44:57] god's grace amen
[44:58] hallelujah now
[45:01] go to
[45:03] matthew 13 35 this was a fresh
[45:06] revelation as i wrote this chapter i
[45:08] felt like it came from heaven brother
[45:10] william matthew 13 35 and i like to say
[45:12] brothers names more than sisters you
[45:14] know so forgive me sisters you know i
[45:15] just
[45:17] uh matthew 13 35.
[45:28] let this is what i put in the book
[45:29] church this uh
[45:30] i believe this with all my heart
[45:32] jesus spoke father son holy ghost and i
[45:35] believe he did it on purpose as a
[45:37] mystery right because it's part of the
[45:39] godhead mystery
[45:41] now the bible calls it and a dark sang
[45:44] which we'll show you very soon
[45:46] or a hidden truth
[45:49] now look at matthew 13 35
[45:53] this is i just thought this was so
[45:54] beautiful that it might be fulfilled why
[45:56] did jesus so look at verse 34 he's
[45:58] speaking in parables in fact he did not
[46:00] speak to them unless he used the parable
[46:03] that it might be fulfilled which was
[46:04] spoken by the prophet saying i will open
[46:06] my mouth in parables i will utter things
[46:08] which have been kept secret from the
[46:10] foundation of the world so jesus was
[46:13] jesus came and preached and he spoke
[46:15] things they never heard before because
[46:17] part of his mission was to speak
[46:19] mysteries and reveal things and to his
[46:23] disciples the ones who really loved him
[46:25] part of his mystery or part of his
[46:27] ministry was to reveal these secret
[46:29] things god had held for four thousand
[46:31] years can you imagine holding a secret
[46:33] for four thousand years it don't bother
[46:35] god but it would bother us right but god
[46:37] held that for four thousand years and
[46:39] now's the time i'm gonna reveal that i'm
[46:41] father son holy ghost i'm three
[46:43] manifestations and i've got one name and
[46:46] i'm gonna reveal it through my son jesus
[46:48] amen
[46:49] the old testament never said father son
[46:52] holy ghost it never talked about that at
[46:54] all it gave no speck or shred or
[46:56] evidence of that but god waited till
[46:58] jesus came so jesus could speak things
[47:00] that went over the pharisees heads but
[47:02] the elect could receive it amen
[47:05] hallelujah he hid it from the eyes of
[47:08] the wise and brutal for revealing the
[47:10] babe such as would learn
[47:14] so god held that for four thousand years
[47:16] no problem god said i'm gonna wait a
[47:18] couple more thousand years through i'm
[47:19] gonna wait a couple more when he got the
[47:21] psalm and he said i'm gonna wait one one
[47:23] thousand more years so i reveal this
[47:25] that i'm father son holy ghost in my
[47:26] manifestation
[47:28] hallelujah
[47:32] now church did you see
[47:35] as that uh that it might be fulfilled
[47:37] which was spoken by the prophet did you
[47:38] see that
[47:40] that means jesus
[47:42] was fulfilling a previous prophecy so go
[47:45] to psalm 78 verse 2. go to psalms 78
[47:47] verse 2.
[47:50] matthew is actually quoting psalms 78
[47:53] verse 2.
[47:57] in church had matthew not told us we
[47:59] would have missed it right unless the
[48:00] holy spirit would have revealed it to us
[48:02] psalm 78 verse 2 is speaking of jesus
[48:08] now look at verse one give ear o my
[48:10] people to my law incline your ears to
[48:12] the words of my mouth i will open my
[48:14] mouth in a parable
[48:17] i will utter dark sayings of old
[48:21] now if you've got a scofield bible run
[48:22] that reference look at that you see that
[48:24] e on the scofield parable if you go to
[48:26] the middle it's matthew 13 35 that's
[48:28] where i got that
[48:30] so jesus said i'm going to preach in
[48:32] parables because i'm going to utter dark
[48:35] sayings of old dark
[48:38] dark like the logos
[48:40] amen i think it dark when there was just
[48:43] one light amen
[48:45] dark sayings let there be light amen and
[48:49] there was the sun hallelujah amen
[48:52] thank god hallelujah there's my timer
[48:54] but i got a few more minutes till 8
[48:56] o'clock
[48:59] dark sang like dark when there was no
[49:01] sun and no
[49:02] and no moon yes dark like that dark when
[49:05] it was just the father and the logos
[49:07] hallelujah
[49:09] now church that word in the hebrew dark
[49:11] saying means enigma
[49:14] and
[49:14] enigma is something a concept difficult
[49:18] to understand for the carnal mind
[49:22] so god said i'm going to have jesus
[49:24] speak things that are difficult for
[49:27] human minded sinful minded pharisees
[49:31] hallelujah praise god and so jesus would
[49:33] say in the name baptize them in the name
[49:35] of the father and of the son and the
[49:38] holy ghost and the pharisees instantly
[49:39] think three gods
[49:41] three persons a trinitarian instantly
[49:43] think three persons but when you have
[49:44] the mind of christ oh there's one name
[49:46] to the father son holy ghost that's the
[49:49] name above all names that every knee
[49:51] shall bow to the name of jesus christ
[49:54] amen
[49:55] it's a difficult concept for the carnal
[49:58] mind but not the spiritual
[50:01] because the spirit
[50:02] knows you don't add anything to the word
[50:04] of god you compare word with word you
[50:07] compare spiritual things with spiritual
[50:09] things
[50:13] god likes stigmas brother william he
[50:15] likes difficult things for the common
[50:17] mind
[50:18] because only the spiritual will search
[50:20] out say god give me the understanding
[50:21] what does this mean what does this mean
[50:22] and god what will he do he'll point
[50:24] others he'll point them to other
[50:26] scriptures
[50:27] because the bible interprets itself
[50:30] and god won't do anything outside the
[50:32] bible brother said he could but he
[50:34] limits himself to the bible so that will
[50:36] have a foundation amen
[50:38] that we'll have an absolute witness
[50:40] we'll have a clear testimony something
[50:42] we can point to and say that's thus
[50:44] saith the lord praise god
[50:50] it's thus saith the lord
[50:53] that's a false
[50:54] man-made carnal baptism
[50:58] but the true baptism is thus saith the
[50:59] lord it's right aren't you gladication
[51:01] you've been baptized the right way
[51:02] malcolm aren't you glad you've been
[51:03] baptized right away lydia
[51:05] karis victoria aren't you glad haven
[51:08] aren't you glad amen we're so glad it's
[51:11] thus saith the lord we've got the true
[51:13] one praise god
[51:15] and the denomination's got the false one
[51:18] that's fine let him have it i'm gonna
[51:19] i'm going there to tell him it's false
[51:22] right i just handed that to the pastor
[51:23] hopefully
[51:24] i mean my prayer brother william and
[51:25] hopefully they can at least get through
[51:26] the first two chapters i mean i know
[51:28] it's a long book right
[51:30] i don't expect everybody to read it but
[51:31] if they can just get those first two
[51:33] chapters it'll unlock the rest amen
[51:36] you know unlock the rest because if you
[51:38] get the baptism right it'll unlock
[51:40] everything else if you get the god head
[51:42] right it unlocks everything
[51:45] then you get the power in the name you
[51:46] get the gifts of the holy spirit the
[51:48] will of god it starts opening up the the
[51:50] church ages right he talks about my name
[51:52] in the church ages they've kept my name
[51:54] through all these ages
[51:56] they've not denied my name amen
[51:59] oh my
[52:01] you can get to the mother harlot she
[52:03] blasphemes the name of god like that
[52:05] father son only ghosts
[52:13] so see matthew 28 verse 19 is still an
[52:16] enigma it's still a dark saying
[52:19] to many billions of christians
[52:23] but not to us god promised to restore
[52:26] i'll restore all things
[52:28] saith the lord and he's revealed the
[52:30] enigma of god's name
[52:33] did you know church in proverbs 30 verse
[52:35] 4. let me read that proverbs 30 verse 4
[52:37] did you know king agur or solomon this
[52:40] is a nickname for solomon
[52:42] did you know solomon asked god what the
[52:44] the messiah's name was
[52:48] proverbs 30 verse four
[52:54] verse
[52:55] uh yeah four thirty verse four
[52:58] who hath ascended up into heaven or
[53:00] descended who hath gathered the wind in
[53:02] his fist
[53:03] who hath bound the waters in a garment
[53:06] who hath established all the ends of the
[53:07] earth what is his name oh glory and what
[53:11] is the son's name if thou can tell hey
[53:15] hallelujah praise god solomon knew
[53:17] there is a god that did this but this
[53:19] god has a son
[53:22] this god has an offspring something came
[53:24] out of that god and started creating it
[53:26] was the word amen and that word is in
[53:29] you amen
[53:30] glory that's why we can speak at times
[53:33] and god's word backs it up amen
[53:35] because we're just yielding to his lips
[53:38] right we're just letting him flow
[53:39] through us sometimes we don't know what
[53:40] they were saying sometimes we're real
[53:42] bold about it but either way it's god's
[53:44] word coming through us and eternity
[53:47] eternal words goes through our lips and
[53:49] it happens
[53:57] and i sent a copy of this book just you
[53:58] know church i sent a copy of this book
[53:59] to my mother she got it she thanked me
[54:01] for it
[54:02] but she's one of the ones that told me
[54:04] uh she said i'd rather believe jesus
[54:06] over the apostles
[54:08] so i'm going to send her i'm going to
[54:09] send her some of these thoughts here
[54:10] tonight
[54:11] in a real loving way because i love i
[54:12] used to argue with her about it but i
[54:13] don't anymore and i apologize after i
[54:16] argued the holy spirit corrected me and
[54:17] said you don't argue with your mother
[54:18] about the word of god
[54:20] it's not the right spirit
[54:22] i'm going to share some of these things
[54:23] with her by the grace of the lord
[54:25] so they're still enigma today
[54:27] but not for us
[54:29] praise god it's not a difficult concept
[54:31] for us because the rest of the bible
[54:32] interprets it hear a little
[54:35] there a little line upon line hear a
[54:37] precept you know they're a precept you
[54:39] put the word of god together it tells
[54:41] one simple story
[54:43] there's no more dark sayings anymore now
[54:45] it's clear the light is shine the bible
[54:48] says the knowledge of the lord has
[54:49] shined into our hearts the day star has
[54:52] risen in our hearts amen
[54:54] glory
[54:56] all right
[54:58] let me see how i can close with this man
[55:02] i don't think i need to spend too much
[55:03] time on this but let's go to this god
[55:05] has many titles right but one name
[55:07] that's just this is very simple for our
[55:09] our loved ones in church on the debate
[55:10] back from uh september 2020 when i dated
[55:13] when i debated believe the sign we got
[55:15] in the godhead
[55:17] and i don't know if the man the man made
[55:18] a mistake
[55:19] but one of the guys
[55:21] he actually used this as an argument to
[55:23] me to try to get me to believe the
[55:25] trinity
[55:26] he said god is a father son holy ghost
[55:29] just like you're a father son brother
[55:32] pastor so he's using our
[55:35] argument to try to convince me god's a
[55:37] trinity and i just started smiling and
[55:39] then the other guy corrected him he said
[55:41] no no you can't use that one because
[55:42] that's ours
[55:44] right so even a trinitarian can see
[55:46] there's truth in that illustration that
[55:48] we're one person with many titles
[55:51] in the book i have eight titles at least
[55:53] i have eight titles and i probably have
[55:55] a lot more
[55:57] right
[55:58] but that doesn't make me more than one
[56:00] person i'm one person with many
[56:02] manifestations with many attributes
[56:04] praise god
[56:06] but i just thought it was so
[56:08] telling
[56:10] that the godhead really is simple if you
[56:12] just take enough time to look
[56:14] word that was one of those times i said
[56:16] i know the law is with me now and my
[56:18] enemies are trying to my arguments
[56:20] right i know the lord with me they
[56:22] really give me a call there
[56:25] i love that guy you know you don't like
[56:26] me he made some videos about me i like
[56:29] him by god's grace
[56:32] and holy ghost titles not name i'm
[56:35] father son brother husband uncle pastor
[56:38] teacher friend there's my eight titles
[56:40] but i'm not eight persons remember satan
[56:42] is called great dragon old serpent devil
[56:44] and satan in revelation 12 verse 9.
[56:47] satan is not four persons
[56:54] god is called wonderful counselor mighty
[56:56] god everlasting father at least he's in
[56:58] the book prince of peace
[57:00] uh we're also my father righteous branch
[57:02] desire of nations king messiah the
[57:04] prince redeemer the head stone of the
[57:06] corner son of righteousness the name of
[57:08] you there's 12 right there
[57:10] but he's not 12 persons
[57:12] new testament is called rock root and
[57:14] offspring of david bright morning star
[57:16] resurrection life true vine true light
[57:18] the word of god alpha mega the beginning
[57:20] then the first and last there's 10 there
[57:22] and the four beasts call him call jesus
[57:25] lord god almighty amen
[57:27] hallelujah i just gave you uh 22 23
[57:31] nicknames for us all it's not 23 persons
[57:35] it's all the one same person it's god
[57:37] it's jehovah it's yahweh it's jesus amen
[57:42] oh glory
[57:46] but yet all these titles are not the
[57:48] name that's above every name
[57:51] there's a name above every title and
[57:54] that's the name of the lord jesus christ
[57:56] this is proven because every time demons
[57:58] were cast out they never used a title
[58:01] they only used a name let's close with
[58:04] these so go to acts
[58:06] uh let's close with these
[58:08] that's the because the children need to
[58:10] know that so in other words if they
[58:12] sense a demon use the name of jesus
[58:14] christ and then wait a minute i had to
[58:15] wait i didn't learn i had to wait a
[58:16] little bit until it left so they'll
[58:19] stand there and they'll you know they'll
[58:20] fight and things like that i had to wait
[58:21] a minute or two then the demon finally
[58:23] left so you got to hang on it ain't
[58:24] going to be instant every time you got
[58:26] to hang on and keep believing by the
[58:27] grace of god
[58:28] you got to stand there
[58:30] like on those lamplighter videos right
[58:32] the demons don't leave right away they
[58:34] got to wait till the king's name is
[58:35] spoken they gotta wait a little while
[58:37] and then then they finally leave
[58:39] okay now
[58:43] all right uh yes uh so
[58:47] acts 16 18.
[58:49] i'll go there
[58:50] sorry i
[58:52] should put it up there
[58:57] so here's where satan he hates it he
[58:59] hates to be cast out right he hates the
[59:02] book of acts so they they make jesus and
[59:06] the apostles enemies rather than
[59:08] embracing and saying they're all unified
[59:10] by the holy ghost
[59:12] acts 16 18
[59:15] paul waits
[59:17] paul waits
[59:19] for the right time that woman with the
[59:20] evil spirit followed him verse 18 and
[59:23] this did she many days but paul being
[59:25] grieved turned and said to the spirit i
[59:27] command thee in the name of the holy
[59:29] trinity to come out of here
[59:32] ah
[59:32] i command you in the name of the father
[59:34] to come out
[59:35] now it could be done i put that in the
[59:37] book it could be done but it's never
[59:38] recorded in the bible that way
[59:40] it's always recorded in the name of
[59:43] jesus christ
[59:44] he said let's all say together i command
[59:46] you in the name of
[59:47] jesus christ to come out of her and he
[59:50] came out that same hour i've seen it the
[59:53] same brother william i've cast out
[59:54] devils i think seven times maybe six i
[59:56] can't remember each time it's jesus when
[59:58] you say the the blood of jesus the name
[1:00:00] of jesus that person the devil starts
[1:00:03] fighting don't want to leave but you
[1:00:04] just stand there with the name of jesus
[1:00:06] amen satan has to move amen
[1:00:10] hallelujah
[1:00:12] miracles
[1:00:13] were only done
[1:00:16] by the name of jesus christ go to acts 3
[1:00:18] 4.
[1:00:20] peter said silver and gold have i none
[1:00:22] but in the name of the holy trinity come
[1:00:24] out
[1:00:25] no
[1:00:26] in the name of three co-equal persons
[1:00:28] come out
[1:00:30] no
[1:00:31] let's read it ready then peter said
[1:00:33] silver and gold have i none but such as
[1:00:36] i have give i thee in the name of what
