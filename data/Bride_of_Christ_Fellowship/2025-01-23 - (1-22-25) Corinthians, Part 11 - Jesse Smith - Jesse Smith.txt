Lord God then walk in that light by the grace of God so Lord Minister now here by the Holy Spirit by the word of God anoint me anoint your people in Jesus Christ's name the Saints said amen let's take our Bibles here we'll go to 1 Corinthians chapter 7 we'll just read verse one 1 Corinthians 71 here by God's grace I think we're on part 11 if I'm not mistaken uh by the grace of the Lord what's the uh the title for Book of Corinthians part 11 that's my simple little title there by God's gra So lately well I guess over the past five or six years I've been going through entire books of the Bible and preaching every verse so yeah we're just looking at the book of Corinthians this one deals mostly with um marriage and Divorce by God's grace First Corinthians uh chapter seven does okay yeah so I I'll go back here brother in just a moment and these are the these are the main topics the whole book deals with right now we're on part four sanctity of the body and marriage so tonight we're looking at marriage by God's grace yeah all right so uh 1 Corinthians 71 hope you got your Bibles there at home by God's grace uh for the live streamers so we'll read this here on three if we can ready one two three now concerning the things whereof you wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman may God add His blessings to his word so we're going to uh preach chapter 7 hopefully we'll see how far we get through it let me set a timer here uh we're looking here uh back on this Corinthians series uh we're looking at chapter 7 now there's two main subjects for chapter 7 the first nine verses are the sanctity or sacredness of marriage uh and that's because God has established marriage and then verses 10 through 40 it's the more lengthly part that's the regulation or rule of marriage among Gentile Believers and it's just a beautiful chapter we're going to see how Paul gives us thus sayi the Lord at times and then he spends actually a large part of this chapter just giving his best judgment and he tell he tells the people this isn't from the Lord this is my judgment he says but I think I have the spirit of God so we get a lot of wisdom from Paul and understand this to be the sacred scripture uh we're in the this the fourth part of the entire uh group or or series here of the book we looked at the introduction we looked at the carnal divided condition of the church uh chapters 1 through four and then we dealt with sexual immorality in chapter five in the beginning of chapter six we looked at the S the sanctity of the body a few weeks ago when we were preaching on this uh to finish chapter 6 tonight is all about marriage uh it's the entire chapter of chapter 7even so uh that's kind of what the first seven chapters are about okay so uh verse one says what we read earlier uh now concerning the things whereof you wrote unto me so we know the the the Believers in Corinth perhaps the house of Khloe we learned in chapter one because the house of Khloe reported to Paul that there was a lot of Divisions in the church um but part of the letter perhaps it came from the house of Khloe we don't know but the some of the Believers in Corinth wrote a letter to Paul and one of the questions was on um celibacy uh and so some of the Believers in Corinth were saying it's good for a man not to touch a woman so they were speaking of uh you know they were trying to influence Believers in the church just to be celibate uh but you got to be careful with that because as Paul's going to say later U it takes a gift of God to be single not just anybody I mean people can try to be single but they'll have a great battle unless they have um a gift to be single so it's very important as Paul will get to in a little bit uh Paul says you know that's the gift that I have he said I wish all men were as me well that if that was the case then there'd be no children there'd be no little children to raise up you know in little families and Christian churches there'd be no children's ministry there be no children's uh Ministry or questions or anything like that so but that's Paul's heart you know Paul's heart was to see everybody give God all their service all their life uh so uh you know i' I heard some um history on this and and there was some history on this that said there was over a thousand prostitutes in Corinth and they just roam the streets and so uh you know when these Believers when these people became Believers know beforehand we saw in chapter six a lot of them were fornicators adulterers homosexual um there were so many sins and so when they came to Christ no wonder a lot of them are like hey we we should just be celibate you know not get married we just we got to be so far out of that uh culture because the culture was just saturated with sexuality well that's exactly what we got today uh I mean I would say a lot of women are spiritual prostitutes or at least uh naturally loose and fornicators adulterers you know the there's a lot of sexual immorality in the world today very similar um but so this this seems to be a reason why a lot of the Corinthians well we're Believers remember they got they got gifts all the time they got tongues interpretation prophecy the spirit of God is moving in but it's not necessarily moving in love for the people that's why Paul's got to you know correct them on love but so we can see why some of the people would say oh don't touch a woman ever you know just be celibate so they wrote Paul about that and so Paul's answer was uh you know that's what you're telling me in the letter but nevertheless or but or yet to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife so fornication is any sexual out sexual uh activity before marriage before you promis to marry the person so Paul said to avoid this let every man have his own wife and every woman have her own husband so this every everyone must mean anyone who wants to be married because later Paul will speak and talk about the gift of singleness and his its benefits right so uh Paul says let's uh for those people that are going to want to be married uh get married because if not he says later you're going to burn with fire fiery passions now verse three said let the husband render under his wife due benevolence that means good willll do um and likewise also the wife unto the husband okay so let me see if I got any other notes on that yeah for the wife hath not power or authority over her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body but the wife so when a couple gets married they have to understand my body just doesn't belong to me anymore it also belongs to my wife or the wife would say my my body belongs to my husband and so I've got to have Goodwill I've got to think about you know when they want to have relations I have to give myself over to that even if I don't feel like it uh now of course it's not anything with violence you never violence or forcefully or anything like that it's good will like he said do benevolence that's benevolence is love this this good will uh love so that's expressed between husbands and wife um because the B the Bible says when you're married you're one flesh right uh and the husband's wife belongs to the I'm sorry the husband's body belongs to the wife and wife the husband because he says it right there the husband hath not power over his own body but the wife and Paul says in the next verse verse five defraud ye not one another so I think I mentioned this a few weeks ago um where the word defraud means Rob so if a husband would not uh have relations with his wife on purpose he's robbing her of that and same way for the the wife uh refusing her husband uh they're actually robbing each other of that need and that due benevolence uh that Good Will and the love one for another except it be consent for a time so the only reason a couple should not want to come together is if they're going to agree to fast and pray as we see there in verse five uh but then after fasting and praying they got to come back together or else Satan will tempt them for their lack of self-control uh because of all the of course the Temptations of Corinth and even of course modern day Le oysa uh Satan's so that proves Satan's going to come and and even after you get married you're going to be tempted by the devil uh right with all these other passions and all these things so we see it right there a lack of self-control um so the enemy is just so wicked the enemy is not going to give up on you brother Ram says once uh once you say you got the Holy Ghost Satan points all of his guns at you to try to tempt you and so this is one of those cases uh where Paul says even in a marriage you know if you're not uh having the coming together relation time uh for prayer and fasting that's fine but as soon as that's over come together because Satan's going to try to tempt you in that error Satan's going to try to get people to adultery is what this is saying so come together uh shortly there soon thereafter the prayer and fasting time now verse six is a very interesting verse so let's look at this but I speak this by permission and not of commandment so there's a few different uh ideas here's the first one Paul's letters were considered scripture remember uh 2 Peter 3:16 Peter says you know some of Paul's letters are hard to understand but they're scripture and he said evil men twist them or arest them to their own destruction so people recognize Paul was writing the scripture um and yet sometimes he would pinpoint and this is the best part about Paul he would pinpoint specific times he was giving his own human judgment um that wasn't from the Lord uh but he still believed he was inspired by the spirit of God giving his wisdom or his best judgment in a situation so an example is like in verse 40 uh but she's happier if she so abide after my judgment and I think also that I have the spirit of God so Paul's saying you know this woman can get married but she'd be probably happier if she stays single based upon my judgment right because I have the spirit of God I met Jesus Christ right you met Jesus Christ um so that's one thought now here's another thought now this is just my opinion but this is also agrees with some other commentators it seemed like Paul was giving permission for the Corinthians about marriage just regarding verse six and the couples using prayer and fasting times to abstain from relations so that that's that's my thought now the commentator is going to give a third thought in the next slide here of the next uh comment that I'm going to preach here by God's grace now the reason I think that is because you don't find that anywhere in the Old Testament as far as I know now somebody could help me out can anybody think of a time in the Old Testament when a couple would fast and pray and then wouldn't have uh the relations I can't think of one I couldn't think of one um so I I couldn't think of one so that's why I think Paul was just speaking of permission just on verse six there I'm sorry verse five rather with uh prayer and fasting times where couples don't have relations now I think verses 2 three four and five um I'm sorry 2 three and four I sorry I got the wrong number there 2 three and four seem like their Divine commands found in other scriptures because Hosea 3:3 is where Hosea rescues and he buys his prostitute wife out of the slave market and he says now you're going to be faithful to me and I'm also going to be for thee so we have this idea of how the husband's wife I'm sorry the husband's bodies for the wife the wife's bodies for the husband we see that previously in the scripture so I think I think uh the verses 2 three and four were actually commands from God but then Paul says by permission he's giving permission for times of prayer and fasting not to come together separate and then after words come back together so Satan doesn't tempt now that's just my own thought okay I could be wrong on that that's my own thought but here's the third thought the third thought is uh the commentators thought maybe verse six where Paul's saying I'm speaking by permission not of commandment was him referring to the Future verses where Paul's going to share what he would recommend like in verse 7 he said for I would that all men were as myself all men so Paul's giving his his his opinion I wish all men were like me of course we know not all men have that gift right no one there's not all men who have the same gift of the nine gifts of the holy spirit or in this case even the gift of singleness so some people think verse six where Paul's saying I'm speaking this by permission is speaking to the later verses and not the previous uh five verses that's a good thought too who I I don't know for sure but we can clearly see in verse 7 and verse say then Paul says I say to the unmarried and the widows so clearly Paul has given his own judgments here based upon his status as an apostle as an a prophet a teacher he was a pastor in Ephesus um he had all five gifts he he did the work of evangelist uh he would go back and visit all the churches they started we saw that in the book of Acts so Paul had all five preaching gifts okay now verse seven for I would that all men were as myself but every man after his proper gift of God one after this manner and another after that so Paul says I wish everybody was single like me but everybody can only do what your gifts allow you to do now remember what a gift is a gift is a Caris it's a it's a charismatic right that's where you get the word gift from charismatic a gift is a special power that you have or ability that you have a special gift of God so Paul says um I wish all men were single but you got to have a gift to do that you have to have power to do that and he says each one has a proper gift or an individual gift um because some people have the the gift of tongues the gift of interpretation um you know all the prophet gifts all these all these gifts teaching preaching you know uh Apostle all these gifts um and he says and each after their own manner right and church you know you as we know you'll find your gift as you're consecrated to God when you're most consecrated to God uh that's when you'll find what your gifts are verse eight I say therefore to the unmar Widow so notice I say not the Lord he's gonna we're going to see that later he always differentiates when it's God and when it's me I say therefore to the unmarried and widows it is good for them if they abide even as I in other words if they stay single but if they cannot contain let them marry for it's better to marry than to burn now this burn word in the Greek means full of fire so a single man that's not married if he has passions on him he feels like he's full of fire like he's got to this Fire's got to be put out and also it can be on a sister too one time I did counseling with a and that's how the sister felt um and I did counseling with her and her husband at the same time over the phone that's why I mentioned that you know I wouldn't counsel an individual sister uh just her have to be with my wife or someone else so in that case it was a couple who Liv many states away I was counseling them over the the phone and that's what the sister was talking about this was one of her uh issues and so you know man or woman can have this burning right we know that that's just part of our human uh human uh buildup or makeup by God's grace but also means uh it's better to marry than to burn it also means to make to glow like a glowing fire or burning with fire so Paul's letting the the people know you know uh if you have this Burning if you have this this glowing with fire this passion to be married uh it's best to get married then so see uh a gift of singleness you won't have that fire you won't have that burning you won't have that full of fire feeling where you're feel like fires of passion I guess we would say it like that um now if you're married though right if if someone's married then if these needs are unmet uh this is what Paul was talking about earlier uh it's like robbing someone from putting out the fire I'm just using metaphor you know for what they're talking about the only way to extinguish that fires have the due benevolence as the good will uh that we talked about earlier um so this is important to recognize especially if someone feels like they might be single I always remember one brother he was a very good brother for years in like I think his into his late 20s he's like he had no desire to be married and all of a sudden overnight it switched he just woke up one morning and he was a preacher he was in the word he studied all the time he preached all the time he was one of the most dedicated Brothers I ever met and he's like oh I don't have any desire to be married and all of a sudden one day it changed just woke up one day and he got married shortly after that and he's happily married now with numerous wonderful children by God's grace I'm not going to name him but my family might know uh verse okay now so now we're done with verses one n we've gone through the sanctity or sacredness of marriage now we're going to get into the regulation or the Rules of Marriage among Believers and some of these are thus sayith the Lord some of these are from your brother Paul our brother Paul by God's grace which we know he had the spirit of God okay so verse 10 now verse 10 and 11 are thus sayith the Lord these are from the Lord okay and these are super important so verse 10 and unto the married I command yet not I but the Lord let not the wife depart from her husband okay so in other words Paul's saying thus sayi the Lord couples should try to stay together as much as possible right because that's what we vow right we vow sickness and in health uh poor Rich right there're supposed to be really if the couple are both serving God and L God there should be no reasons they should separate but of course we know the devil gets in there if people aren't born again or something like that the devil can get in there and there can be awful things happen um but ideally uh God says thus sayith the Lord Stay Together verse 11 but and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife sorry kind of cold in here um okay so now look at verse 12 now just here's the contrast 10 and 11 are thus sayi the Lord now 12 becomes Paul's suggestions advice wisdom of the holy spirit that he has but he says this is not the Lord but the to the rest speak I not the Lord if any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away so I just want you to see the contrast between thus sayith the Lord chapter 101 and then here's Paul notice he plainly points it out so with any other book now we read from Paul we preached on now you know it Paul will always point it out when he's saying this is me this is not the Lord does that remind you of anybody brother brandom right brother Bram uh brother we just listened to it uh last night he cares you care uh brother Ram thought Martin Luther King Jr would lead millions of people into like a civil war of blacks versus whites and he said he's going to do it he's going to take millions in this millions are going to die in this this this uh this Civil War well they asked brother randam like a couple months later did you prophesy that he said no I don't have nothing on that from the Lord that was just my own human opinion right he said but the way to know he said if it's from God it'll speak it it'll say thus sayith the Lord right so it's a lesson that we know but a lot of people around the message don't necessarily seem to have that understanding which is really sad they'll make every statement brother Ram said thus say the Lord they'll make every future prediction of Prophecy but they don't have this understanding that brother Ram said I've always asked you to be careful how you're listening so that we want to keep that in mind there by God's grace now notice in in verses 10 and 11 couples that separate only have two options they can either remain unmarried or reconcile that's thus say the Lord according to St Paul so couples that separate if they have a living spouse they cannot remarry if they remarry anyone else they're an adulterer and adulterers will not inherit the kingdom of God in other words they won't be baptized with the Holy Ghost if they don't repent of that they'll be lost right because you have to repent of all these things uh adulterers will burn in hell murderers Liars hor mongers uh abominable people they'll all burn in hell so they've got to repent of that adultery now verse 12 but to the rest speak ey not the Lord if any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she be pleased to Joell with him let him not put her away and the woman which hath a husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him so if there's couples that one's a Believer one's not a Believer as long as they're it's pleasing to live with each other that's fine Brother mam gives an example 1962 questions and answers he says if the husband doesn't believe and but he says wife it's okay wife you can read your Bible go to church that's fine but I'm that's not for me but I still love you we'll still live together brother Ram said that that's a good example of that they're still pleased to dwell together and it could be vice versa I know up at the well a church up North about an hour north when we when I first came in the message started going there they had a brother there and that the brother was a message believer but his wife just went to maybe a a nominal Church um but they were pleased to dwell together I still believe as far as I know they're married to this day um so that's an example of that verse 14 for the unbelieving husband is Sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is Sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now they are holy so uh I want to just say this you know one spouse cannot force his or her family to go through the second stage of Grace so in other words Paul this sanctification Paul's not talking about the second stage of Grace he's just talking about separating from profane things right because like let's say the the wife is a Believer the husband's not well uh the wife's going to say husband you know please don't bring this drugs in or please don't dring the bring these dirty movies in here and hopefully if the husband is has any kindness in his heart and respect for his wife he won't bring it in well that would be a blessing that would mean the wife's life would would keep the the children separate from profane things or she'd say husband please don't cuss you know around the children and if and if he honors that then it's keeping them from hearing profane things so that's what Paul's talking about here it's not that you know we can force our family to go through justification and sanctification we we can't force them it has to be their choice Okay so verse 15 but if the unbelieving depart let him depart a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases but God has called us to peace now this verse is one of the most misunderstood marriage and divorce scriptures that I've ever seen Satan uses this verse to cause many adulteries so the the carnal mind will look at this and say oh yeah if my spouse isn't a Believer I can leave I can separate from them we can divorce and I can remarry because I'm not under bondage no that's not true uh brother Ram taught specifically on this verse he was specifically asked about this verse 1 Corinthians 7:15 and questions and answerers 62 and brother Ram said if you misinterpret 1 Corinthians 7:15 and say you're not under bondage you can remarry then you just contradicted what the Lord said in verses 10 and 11 where you only have two choices and you can't remarry so I hope that's uh understood by God's grace also it contradicts verse 39 so I'm going to read verse 39 1 Corinthians 11:39 so that's very important brother man you know gives numerous examples in that sermon of how the Bible can't contradict itself there's no contradictions brother said I've been preaching three decades and I've never seen one contradiction in the Bible I agree I've been preaching two decades I've never seen one contradiction in the Bible uh verse four verse 39 sorry verse 39 yeah the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she's set at Liberty to be married to whom she will only in the Lord so here Paul twice so it's interesting uh before verse 15 and after verse 15 Paul specifically says there's no remarriage if you separate uh except the death of the husband or death of the wife right if a couple's separated you cannot remarry and it's okay with God it's not okay with God it's adultery uh in the sight of God if you have a living spouse you're divorced from and you go marry a second time that adultery okay so I think that's pretty clear by God's grace um in the Greek bondage means to give oneself holy to one's needs and service to make yourself a bond man to him okay so what Paul is saying if if a couple separates they're no longer under bondage in other words uh the separated spouse isn't under that bondage or Duty um like the duban Elance Command right so if they're separated then they're no longer supposed to come together together to meet each other's needs in that manner they're no longer under that bondage or that that service or that uh due benevolence okay uh and another example the wife's not then obligated to cook and clean for the husband if they're living separate and they're now separated uh they're not they're not under bondage in that case and vice versa okay now of course the man he would be required to pay child support right because he's got to take care of those children so um it's for certain situations within americ relationship they're no longer under bondage but the husband if he has kids will always be required uh to provide for his children okay now here's that I'm just going to do a short version this is actually a pretty long quote it's a pretty great quote if you want to go listen to it but they ask brother brandom um does 1 Corinthians 7:15 mean a sister or brother is free to remarry says no see you don't get his question there and what he's saying they're not free see that would make a contradiction in the scripture and the scriptures doesn't contradict themselves at all okay now I'm going skip ahead now brother R saying if there's a husband a husband and a wife and let's say the woman says to her husband I'm not going to mix up with that bunch of holy rulers I'm not going to do this I'll separate and leave you brother Ram said woman don't leave the church you let the man leave or vice versa so this is how much brother Ram is saying you stay with the church stay with the body of Christ even if you're will leave you don't forsake God's house don't forsake God's word this is how much brother Ram believed in a home church and going to church because in Hebrews 10 right and Jesus example in Luke 4:16 um always support the house of God that's where the spirit of God is poured out Hallelujah that's where you're taught remember in the Old Testament thy way is in the sanctuary God's way you'll find God's way for your life in the sanctuary and then uh brother Ram says a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases that is if your companion is putting you away and wants to depart for it you don't have to just hold on to them if they're wanting to leave you and they're going to leave you for the cause of Christ let them leave but you can't Remar because God has called us unto peace see but not that you can remarry again he's already stated that right in verses 10 and 11 and also verse 39 but you don't have to live with an unbelieving husband or an unbelieving wife if they're not willing to live with a Christian spouse okay then brother R says now what if you say brother brandom I got married my wife isn't I'm sorry my wife's an unbeliever and here's a sister over here I can marry I'm going to leave this one and marry that one oh no no indeedy your vow is until death you separate and there's nothing else in the world will permit you to marry in the Bible until your companion is dead that's right and that was remember uh chapter 7:39 it's also in uh Romans chapter 7 if I'm not mistaken let me pull that up here briefly by God's grace yeah uh the Bible said in uh Romans 71 and two and three the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth the law of marriage for the woman which hath a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she's loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she should be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she's free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man okay yeah brother Chris okay so say what if um a brother or sister they remarry when their when their ex spouse is still alive and what their spouse what their ex spouse dies while the other person is married is that what they well yeah they're still committing adultery but when that spouse dies what would that be well yeah if they're already living in the second marriage they just should just stay in that and just ask for God's mercy so when brother ran preached marriage and divorce it was February 1965 there was a lot of people in his church that were married a second or third time and brother Ram said God what do I tell them do I do they break up their homes and the Holy Spirit said no um give them permission to just live as they are but they better never do that again so they were remarrying even when the the ex spouse was still alive yes so now what the ex spouse died yeah yeah that's what it just came to my head I was like what like the first spouse yeah so what the first spouse dies uh so so say uh yeah so the F the first spouse still alive when the other spouse gets remarried that first spouse dies while the other spouses remarried is that so that would still be fornication or would it be well no longer yeah it it would it would have started as adultery but once they died then they would be free in the sight of God so they they would of course they would repent they would have to repent to God say Lord I'm sorry I was an adulter but then they'd be free right to stay in that marriage the second marriage yeah good question yeah good question all right now um brother R said uh you can't he says oh yeah I'm sorry your vow is he said no anded your vow is until death you separate there's nothing else in the world will permit you to marry in the Bible until your companion is dead right except there's one case we'll talk about that in a little bit there's one case where a man can divorce a wife and uh then remarry but it's very very rare I I've never even heard of it happening he said ' that's right there's no remarrying nowhere at all except a dead companion that's all now of course what three years later God would show him this Revelation on a on a uh there is one case for divorce and remarriage there just one so we'll talk about that here he might even explain it right here uh you can't make it contradict itself so just read the verses before and after that's a good good advice so if 1 Corinthians 7:15 is a question just read read before read after brother gives us that great advice you'll catch then what he's talking about does this mean a sister or brother is free to remarry no sir see he explained that first uh there's no such thing as any believer ever being reconciled to remarriage again with a living companion okay now verse 16 for what knowest thou oh wife whether Thou shalt save thy husband or how knowest thou oh man whether Thou shalt save thy wife so none of us know the future so Paul's saying if you're a Believer and you're married to unbeliever just stay in that and pray for the person's soul to be saved keep believing because your life will sanctify theirs automatically brother Ram said you're either going to pull you're either going to pull that sinful spouse up or they're going to pull you down so you better be super strong right you if you're married to an unbeliever right you got to just you got to just live the life you got to have a strong prayer life you got to be speaking the word all the time you got to be in church all the time you just got to be fully devoted and you got to rebuke Satan every time he comes in you just got to be fully uh fully devoted to the Lord Jesus Christ verse 17 But as God has distributed to every man as the Lord hath called everyone so let him walk and so ordain I in all the churches is any man called being circumcised let him not become circumcised is any called an uncircumcision let him not be circumcised so your calling in life or your life story that God wrote before the foundation world uh is distributed to you from God and distribute means to separate in Parts divide it into parties so another word is like lot like the Old Testament you know Joshua gave them their lot or their predestinated boundaries right so the same thing's true in the New Testament not naturally necessarily but spiritually God has a predetermined lot uh for your life for your life story and so if you're a sinner you're married to a sinner but then the the word comes to you well that's your lot in life God called you to overcome in that story in that testimony uh you can't feel bad necessarily about the past now we all feel bad about our sinful past but we have to remember God has a a a distribution for a testimony for each and every person and we have to accept that and then do all we can do to serve God within that predestinated uh boundary that God gives us our life story and this was given by God himself Paul says it it's it's God distributed God so God called you wherever you were uh whether you're married single Jew or Gentile wherever you were child adult old man old woman young man young woman God knew exactly where you'd be when he would finally get a hold of your heart because he knows your decisions he knows everything beforehand and it's all uh it's all planned out by God he declares the end from the beginning he knew the time you would choose him and uh he moved into your life at just the right time verse 19 circumcision is nothing uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping the Commandments of God hey you guys want to read some verses that be okay Malachi you want to read 20 let every man abide in the same calling where he was called all right so so so far Paul's listed two callings so I'll just go this way is that okay guys you want to read this uh Paul's listed two callings so far so uh your first calling is is one of your callings is marriage that whatever you're called to whether it be single or uh married to a holy ghost filled Saint or maybe you're a Believer and you're married to an unbeliever uh that's part of your calling and then if you're a Jew or Gentiles all of us here are Gentiles right most people listen to me would be uh considered Gentiles that's part of your calling you weren't called as a a Jew Jewish convert into a Messianic Jew coming into Christianity and now next in verse 21 he a third uh calling in life so Caris you want to read verse 21 art thou called being a servant care not for it but thou may be free use it rather all right great so now he brings in a third one whether you're a free person or your indentured servant or even perhaps a slave this is the time of the Roman Kingdom so they could have had slaves um so Paul said wherever you are you got to recognize that's where whenever the gospel came to you that was God's calling for your life you're called to overcome in that particular portion of uh of your life and he said uh if but if you're made free if you are not free but you're made free use it rather which means to a greater degree so take advantage of your freedom serve God uh do even more with the freedom that you experience as a free man or woman and thank God we have all that in America I know sometimes we feel like we're slaves to our jobs but we don't have we're not really we chose to work there um but God is gracious to us so brother Austin you want to read 22 for he that is called in the Lord being a servant is the Lord's free man likewise also he that is called being free is Christ's servant thank you brother so Paul says basically we're all we're all free in one way and we're all servants in one way so do you see that so Paul says if if you're called if you're called to be a Christian and you're a servant you're still free in Christ then he says if you're called being free you're a servant so we're both free uh spiritually and we're a servant spiritually that's the point Paul's making right we in other words we don't have to serve the devil we don't have to give into the devil we're free from those things right we're free from those chains right so it's a beautiful scripture so Paul says you know that that's why Paul said I've learned in whatever state I'm in I've learned to be content remember that in Philippians chapter 4 that and that's one of his great lessons he had to learn later on in life I've got to learn to be content no matter where I am okay so verse 23 you want to try that Victoria all right are of Christ not ye Servants of all right great verse there now remember he already said this in chapter 6 we're bought with a price our bodies are bought bought with a price but he reminds you you're bought with a price you're bought by the blood of Jesus Christ so the blood forgives you if you're a a free person if you're a dentur servant if you're a slave uh what wherever God bought you and he placed you in that position to be an overcomer but he says don't be the Servants of men other words don't I think yeah yeah Brian remember Brian used that verse on Sunday cursed is he who trusts in man so whether you're free or whether you're uh B in bondage don't trust in men like he says later to Timothy don't trust in riches right another but if you're not if you're poor don't trust in the government or don't trust in uh your your slave master or your whatever your boss don't trust in that because you're bought with a price Jesus Paid for you for your body and then he says uh abide in where he called you so let's have Kisha read uh 24 rather that every man wherein he is called therein abide with God now this is quite a statement this has caused a lot of people to be upset but Paul's basically telling people in bondage uh just abide there in other words abide there until you can get your freedom right in other words don't be discontented uh uh don't doubt that somehow you know something's wrong God gave that portion to you right we just saw that God distributed that that testimony to you and thank God we have a testimony praise God thank God we're not Sinners thank God we can have a testimony for Jesus Christ and we can overcome no matter what state we're in we uh we know we can overcome in any situation because the greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world praise God so we see that so God is with you in your calling no matter if you're Jew Gentile uh married single uh if you're slave free indentured servant wherever you are God is with you in your calling and you must be content in your calling okay now verse 25 we go to Haven now concerning virgins I have no Commandments of the Lord yet I give my judgment as one that obtaineth mercy of the Lord to be faithful okay so again I love this he pinpoints it I have nothing on the Lord from this but this is my best understanding in this Roman government right here in Corinth uh he I love how he States it plainly this is Paul's judgment okay verse 26 brother chrisan want read that I suppose I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress I say that it is good for a man so to be okay so notice Paul recognizes a dist right this is a problem so did Brother Bram that's a good verse brother BR uses at the end of the sermon a marriage and divorce if you listen to that it's a distress I mean so in Paul's day the people were distressed do we mean are we should we We selib bit how do I control the fire if I got this fire inside of me it's just a distress how do we uh deal with this and so here Paul gives them some wisdom especially now these virgins The Virgins were under distress to should we get married should we not uh Paul says I'm going to give you my just or best judgment because I found Mercy from God and I've been a faithful Apostle I started many churches I've been on three this might have been a second missionary trip I've been on these missionary trips Jesus met me in uh in Arabia and uh commissioned me to write the Bible so uh verse uh 27 we'll go back to Mal there art thou bound unto a wife seek not to be loose art th loose from a wife seek not a wife okay so this is Paul's uh advice under the current distress of living in Corinth again there's all this prostitution they're not sure what to do uh should I get married should I not there's all this talk and the gifts of the Spirit are operating so Paul says if you're bound if you're married to a wife just just stay with her don't don't try to be loose if you're loose from her don't seek a wife just stay separate so Paul's just trying to give them some advice in the midst of this distress in other words don't make a quick bad decision right just stay as you are you know give God some time to work right give give give God time to water you preachers to plant water God gives the increase right don't make any big awful decisions verse 28 uh is it Caris but and if thou Mary thou Hast not sinned and if a Virgin Mary she sh she hasth not sinned nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh but I spare you so Paul with his wisdom is trying to tell him you know if you get married there's there's there's more troubles and uh again this is his own this is his own conviction right but you got to look at the other side too you know you could be burning right and then Paul says you better get married if you're burning right uh and then also God remember God ordained marriage in Genesis chapter 1 that was his institution uh and then three Paul still had a lot of troubles remember his resume in 2 Corinthians we're going to get to that Lord willing if God carries just this tremendous resume of troubles and suffering he said troubles within troubles without fears within fears without so in other words you're going to have trouble either way so if you have the gift to be single be single you're still gonna have trouble but if you're burning and you don't have that gift get married uh there's going to be troubles in life right there's troubles uh for us it's emergency room troubles right or other troubles you know you just have difficulties in life difficult decisions family situations relatives neighbors you know you have all these uh all these troubles in life okay verse 29 we brother Austin but this I say Brethren the time is short it remain that both they that have wives be as though they had none okay so again Paul says the time is short now I didn't get to this thought it might be the next yeah I didn't get to this thought but there are numerous verses from Paul and Peter where they're saying like the Lord is coming soon time is short now were they lying no no they were inspired to warn the people and if they said the time is short well there's different ways to approach it do they mean if if they're talking about time short in the perspective of God it's right if they're talking about their lives are short and Christ could end come at any time that's true too okay so some people think you know the Bible contradicts itself it doesn't uh and then the other thing is you know Paul or Peter could be saying that just from their own wisdom or their own human understanding their own convictions just like Paul says this is not the Lord this is I so we have all the those different options in there but clearly from God's perspective the time is short because A Thousand Years is as one day with God think it's only been two two days since Jesus was crucified and resurrected and sent the Holy Ghost it's not even been two days actually it's not even been two days yeah uh so that's amazing what did you do two days ago that that's that's what God would feel like uh in the timeline of time okay thanks brother Austin uh 29 uh Victoria 29 yeah 29 wait is that right brother or no you read that I'm sorry thank you brother 30 H sorry and that weep as though they we not and they that rejoice as though they Rejoice Rejoice not and they that buy as though they possess not very good so what is Paul saying the time is short right uh he's saying in other words don't go overboard with weeping don't don't get carried away with emotions and crying try to try to stay in the middle right don't get overtaken with emotion try to be more solid and then uh Rejoice rejoicing is good but don't go too far on that either right be more sober you know and and then uh buying things don't get too busy with buying things and the cares of the world like brother Brian preached to us on Sunday uh try to be more content so Paul's and then Paul all relating this with marriage right uh try to be content in whatever situation you're in but if you have a desire to be married and burning then do that but only in the Lord okay all right we're getting close to the end here by God's grace uh verse 31 uh where we at brother OHA sorry and they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashion of this word pass away okay so again you know don't get caught up in the word riness don't abuse all your Liberties um the world Fashions of the world the trends of the world all come and go 32 Haven but I would have you without carefulness he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong unto the Lord how he may please the Lord very good but Christian read 33 but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife okay so Paul says if you do get married then you're going to care so much for the things of your family um and that that's true your focus comes on them but yet the other side of this remember this is just Paul's judgment the other side of that Paul Paul actually wrote about in Ephesians 5 right he said uh when a man loves his wife and cares for his wife it's as if he's showing the love of Christ to his wife and his love is like a symbol of Christ's love for the church so this is the balance on this you know Paul's saying you're going to have troubles if you get married uh but you're going to have trouble if you don't right you're going to have trouble either way uh so it's kind of based upon whether you burn or not or whether you have the gift of singleness or not um but yeah a woman that wants to care for the needs of her husband that's wonderful that's like the church caring about what Christ wants done you know doing the will of Christ it's a it's a one's natural one's spiritual okay all right verse 34 okay now I just want to put put this point in here but just so everybody knows a uh singleness seems to yield the greatest Heavenly reward but again that's based upon a gift in in in some cases not every case I think in uh Matthew 19 Jesus says some people can make themselves Unix uh or single um they do it either of the will of man or their own will um but it would take a lot of uh a lot of anointing of the Holy Spirit a lot of Grace if you don't exactly have that gift some are called by God Jesus says but uh clearly the greatest reward uh it seems like goes to those who are single and we know that because John the Baptist was called greatest in the Old Testament now why was that of course he introduced uh Jesus you know to the people um he actually got to see Jesus baptized Jesus everybody else just talked about him wrote about him but also he lived a life of total consecration he was physically consecrated um and spiritually consecrated ated he obeyed so much of the word of God now think about that like Moses killed a man right David killed a man John the Baptist didn't kill anybody you know John the Baptist he could have got married but he didn't he forsook marriage he was single so he could be prepared for his ministry so he made all John the Baptist made all these sacrifices and that's why I believe you know he was called of course he introduced Jesus all those things brother Ram taught us about but he's called the greatest in the Old Testament and then Jesus Jesus wasn't married right Jesus sacrificed everything for the kingdom of God of course he was sinless Son of God King of Kings Lord of lords no one would ever be greater than Jesus but just seeing that look at the life of sacrifice that he lived and look at this great reward okay and then the same thing for Paul now I I personally believe Paul will have the greatest reward in the New Testament I don't I don't claim I'm right that's just my humble thought because he was single his life matched John the Baptist in uh many ways of course they're both Martyrs uh for the gospel's sake so that's just something to keep in mind I I think Paul was constantly uh influencing the people uh to be single here so they can focus on the Lord uh because it does seem to yield the greatest reward but again that's just my humble thought I could be wrong on that okay verse 34 uh back to me there's a difference also between a wife and a virgin the unmarried woman care for the things of the world they seem to be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married careth for the things of the world how sheens her husband okay so here Paul explains the difference um a married woman cares for the things of her husband a woman who's not married she cares she wants to be holy in her body and her spirit it's completely devoted to the Lord but a married woman her body belongs to her husband right so um so there's uh two different things there a husband caring for the needs of the husband and then if you're single caring for the needs of Christ or the desires of Christ okay uh verse 35 Caris um and this I speak for your own prophit not that I may cast a share upon you but for what which is comely and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction all right very good hun okay so again you know that's Paul's saying I'm not trying to put you in bondage so if you have a burning uh to be married Paul said I'm not trying to put a snare on you so you know you'll be tempted to commit fornication all the time he said but I just want you to serve the Lord without raction so I think as I'm preaching this I'm just realizing how important it is for someone to realize if they're have the gift of singleness or not because you can get a really great reward uh if you are just single and able to do that by the gift of God in your life and also the consecration uh it's quite a quite a reward there um so brother Austin uh 36 please but if any man think that he behave himself uncomely toward his virgin if she passed the flower of her age and needs so require let him do what he will he sinth not let them marry okay so Paul's saying you know even if a a single woman gets older she can still he can still marry her right because in those days they didn't live as long as we live I think their life expectancy was much shorter uh due to the Industrial Revolution and so forth but Paul's saying it's not a sin even for an older single woman who's never been married it's not a sin um she's maybe PL past the flower she can't have children anymore it's still not a sin so see Paul's giving all these judgments to people at every different level right you know you're you're younger you're older Paul's giving you're married you're single you're separated Paul gives like all this wisdom and all this advice to all the people in all the different areas of life very uh good chapter here 37 Victoria never nevertheless nevertheless he that standeth steadfast in his heart haveth no necessity necessity that have power over his own will and have so described decreed decreed in his heart that he will keep his version do with what very good now this is referring to the father of the Virgin or the father of the the girl who's not married so so Paul says here the the P the father even has this power too he can either give her or not it's kind of up to him him and of course it'd be up to the the the daughter too right he would want to take his daughter is she burning you know because Paul says it's better to marry than to burn so the father and the daughter have to have of course of prayer time talk time counseling time see how she feels about it seek the Lord surely the Lord will answer if we really seek and fast and pray and find his will should I marry this guy or not surely the Lord would answer right okay then verse 38 uh Casa so then he that giveth her in marriage doth well but he that giveth are not in marriage to his better okay so again that's Paul's right Paul's judgment Paul's opinion it's better for a father to keep his daughters unmarried that's what Paul says U because it because you they can serve the Lord without distraction right because remember you know remember who had that great testimony wasn't it Anna in the New Testament she dedicated Decades of prayer and fasting and then she got to see Jesus so that's that's a great example of dedication fasting and praying that's the ministry uh of a single woman she can give herself more holy to that prayer and fasting so 39 Haven the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she is at Liberty to be married to whom she will only in the Lord all right so this is the verse brother R says after verse 15 right that proves you a couple cannot separate and then remarry and think God's okay with it no if a couple is already married they are joined in God's sight until death until death okay and she's only either one is only at Liberty to be married again if the the other spouse dies okay verse 40 brother Chris but she is happier she so abide after my judgment and I think also that I have the spirit of God all right so there again Paul uh believing he had the spirit of God she'd be happier if she remains single rather than being married even at an older age uh but i' I known I've known a couple years ago this this woman uh was sing I think she until she was 40 or 45 and then she got married uh to an older man like she might have been 45 he might have been 60 but she was so H and they were so happy together was over in Pennsylvania years ago not albian but a different Pennsylvania city so it was really just really sweet you know she wanted to be married all of her life but she was just patient on the Lord and then this this man came along and his wife had died and uh he wanted a wife and so they found each other it's really it's really something to see how sweet they were with each other like God Grace okay I'm finish up with a couple things here I got a couple more slides here now I want to go back into just review here real quick um there is one cause this might be new I'm looking at brother Chris this might be new to him there is one cause when a man can actually divorce his wife and then remarry there's only one but it's so rare okay and and it's a case like this if a couple gets married okay but the man later finds out that she lied to him and she had she had had relations with other maybe one man or another man other words she wasn't a pure virgin if the man finds out later that she lied that's the one time a man is allowed to divorce her and then marry another woman because the vow was given in dishonesty it was a dishonest vow so it's not a sin for him to for him is it vice versa like if he lied to her can she leave that's a good question but the Bible doesn't say that the Bible just says the man only and that's what brother bam explains now I've known people that have done that I'm just praying God don't please don't let me be in that situation you know because I just because Jesus doesn't say the woman can do it only the man can do it and brother Ram talks about that so that's a great question excellent question very spiritual question okay here's where brother R says it um let's go to Matthew 199 I don't I don't think I have that verse on here Matthew 199 who we at is that bro whose turn is it to read who thank you read that Matthew 199 whenever you're ready buddy and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except to be for fornication shall marry another committing adultery and who so Marth her which is also put which is put away do commit adultery excellent okay so there's one cause except it be for fornications that means the the the the the wife would have had sexual ations before they got married and she didn't tell him now if she told him then The Vow stands and they he can't put her away because she was honest The Vow was in Purity it was honest right now let's go to Matthew 5 uh Caris go to Matthew 5 I think it's 31 and 32 so you got to put a couple verses of Jesus together and then you'll have you'll understand you'll understand this then brother Austin could you go to Matthew chapter one you have your phone we'll show uh I don't know so I think it's think it's 19 or 21 but it's at the end of the chapter okay but uh we're going to Caris Matthew 5 yeah okay it's 31 and 32 so Caris do you want to read 3132 it hath been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement but I say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife say for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorce committed adultery okay so here it says saving for the cause of fornication okay so there's only one cause and like I said I've I've been a Christian for 25 years I've never seen this happen because usually the women know just tell everything tell all your past now you don't have to get into all the the sick details or whatever but just you have you known a man or not that's the most important thing uh when a couple's getting married because that's the only way they could actually divorce and then the man could Remar okay so let's see the the example a Bible example is in Matthew chapter 1 now Joseph and Mary were spoused to be married right they were engaged in other words and then they found out she was pregnant well Joseph thought she had known a man so Joseph was going to put her away and remarry so this is a Bible example this is the only time you could divorce a a woman and put her away in the New Testament and Remar and that's when the Angels Came no this is conceived of the Holy Ghost yes this is Jesus okay so I want to show that um yeah brother can you read uh 18 19 brother Austin now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this when as his mother Mary was spouse to Joseph before they came together she was found with the child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being just a man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away okay so Joseph was I'm just going to private thank you brother I'm gonna privately put you away because he could have had her stoned she could have been stoned according to law of Moses but he's like I'm a just man I'm a fair man I don't know I didn't see it so he said I'm just going to do it privately but then verse 20 but while he thought on these things behold the angel Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived of her is of the Holy Ghost okay and notice the angel calls Mary his wife before they had relations so that that's how serious a vow is in the New Testament as soon as you're engaged you're married in the sight of God as soon as you say will you marry me she says yes I will you're married in the sight of God and the only way of is one of them dies yes yes very good brother very good excellent great good you got it man good job and so that's what brother R says here um she has to confess that fornication to her husband before they're married if she's did that if not and her husband finds out later he has the right to put her away because she took a false vow the Bible said well the Bible does say it but then the ritual also says like you'll hear this at weddings um if any couples are joined otherwise than God word does allow their marriage is not lawful it's I say that when you guys got married I say that not pre most preachers probably today don't say that because they're so far from traditional bible-based marriages okay um I'll read the blue part if a brother man said if a man marries a woman and she has lived unclean before she marries him and then she comes to him if they've been married ever so long and then she comes to him and says honey I want to tell you something I did run out with another man I Never Told You Jesus said he has a right to put her away and marry another because they're not married in the beginning because she falsely told a lie against him so that's exactly what Jesus said saving for the cause of fornication that's the only way and then we see that played out with Joseph and Mary but the Holy Ghost stepped in there and showed exactly what had happened there by God's grace so they were United and brother Ram repeats this in 1965 in the sermon marriage and divorce we read uh we had Caris read Matthew 5 31-32 now here's here's where brother rown says only the man can do this not the woman and here's his explanation it's because man represents Christ and the woman represents the church it's a pretty simple type um but in other words like the church isn't going to put away Jesus and Jesus would never do anything wrong but the church the woman the church can't put away Jesus and I'll marry somebody else he's God he's the perfect true husband you would I mean the woman would never think of doing that so brother R says that's why Jesus said only a man can do this okay so see she's got a living husband so no man can marry her like if if a couple's separated care what she does or who she is she's got a living husband there's no grounds for her at all but it's not for him because Jesus said causes her not him brother says get it you have to make the word run in continuity or it's got to run in parallels it's got to agree everywhere see nothing says he couldn't divorce and remarry but she can't see causes her not him that's exactly what the Bible says causes her it's not St against him to Remar but her why Christ in the type okay and then he gives examp examples from the there's my hour so I'm going to try to finish up David could David could marry uh multiple women but none of those women could ever put him away and marry another right but David could put a wife away away and marry another so could Solomon and all the rest of these because the man represents Christ and the woman represents the church I'm going to skip ahead there U yeah here brother Ram referen 1 Corinthians 7:10 and he mentions those two a woman that's separated from her husband only has two choices she either has to remain single or be reconciled brother R emphasizes that in marriage and divorce Paul commands the wife that is that divorc her husband to remain single or be reconciled not to remarry she must remain single or be reconciled back to her husband she cannot remarry you can't make the word of God lie and everybody said amen okay I didn't I didn't get to this slide so I'm not going to go over this here tonight um but I'll just generally brother Maham uh brother Braham says polygamy is wrong so if a man marries multiple women and lives with them that's wrong um uh a man can only have one wife at a time right one at a time like brother Bram was married to hope hope died well then brother BR could remarry MAA but you can only have one at a time except in the case of that one case if a a woman uh lies about her vow then the man would have to put away that woman he's got a living spouse but she did a false vow and he has a new wife that'd be the only way that can happen but I guess in God's eyes the putaway wife was never his wife to begin with because she lied that's how how important it is to always tell the truth okay so I'm GNA skip past this I'm GNA try to finish up here um lot of I'm not get all I didn't get to all these so this week I put out a a a video kind of addressed three topics the seven-year tribulation interracial marriage and um what's the other one oh ministers aren't required to marry virgins in the New Testament but I just thought I would go over this because it's a it's a good thought so I put out this video and someone came against me with an argument and said uh well uh Genesis 1: 11:12 teach a seed must bring forth of its kind so they said you can't have an interracial marriage and I said that's ridiculous all marriages bring forth of their kind they bring forth humans so this this these people are so obsessed with skin color the Bible doesn't is not talking about skin color in Genesis 1 uh 11 and 12 this is how ridiculous some people are they they uh brother Ram says brother Ram says if Satan can't keep you from seeing the truth he'll push you off on some extreme to make you a Fanatic in some area and that's how fanatical these people are they're using verses that are totally out of context don't even make sense uh with the scripture because what about uh Moses and Zapora what about Moses brother random said God chose Zapora for Moses God chose to do an interracial marriage right and brother BR said God chose her because the poor would save Moses's life at least once was it twice or once the the foreskin uh was it just once or was it twice I thought it might have been I'll have to look that up I thought it might have been twice but at least once uh Zapora saved his life the angel was going to kill uh Moses CU he didn't circumcise his two sons and who stepped in and saved him his wife and so God chose Zapora for Moses and how could uh how could God choose a woman against the law of the seed so if you have a quote from brother brandom and then the the verse they got to go together if you're going to do a a true Bible teaching right then the other one they tried to say uh well interracial marriage like MOS and zapor was only allowed for a few couples because they typed Christ in the church and I said that's nonsense all marriages type Christ in the church you just have to read Genesis or Ephesians chapter 5 right the husband must love as Christ loved the church the wife must submit as the church submits to Christ and it just doesn't makes sense what other type could there be of marriage uh Satan and the great like what uh Satan and it just doesn't there there's no other types of of marriage it's only Christ and the church so um I just thought I'd share that because it's been a recent thing uh for me this week and it also shows the word will always be true like if you rightly divide the word of Truth it'll always be true remember there's at least five interracial marriages in the Bible let's see if I can remember them Moses and Zapora Joseph and azth um Ruth and Boaz um sammon and uh Rahab and Uriah and basba there there's five right there and I'm sure there's numerous other ones but there's five and God ordained all those and God even put basheba in one of Jesus's lineages God put Rahab and Ruth in one of Jesus lineages like God put interracial marriages right in the lineage of Jesus Christ so we know God is not against interracial marriage brother random was against it because I believe for two reasons uh because it was illegal till 1967 and because of all the all the violence the racial violence and Wars during his lifetime so he wouldn't want to see anybody have to break the law but then also experience you know violence and things like that but we're thankful for the word of God tonight Hallelujah by God's grace I think I'll stop y I think I'll stop there by God's grace so Mali can come here hope this was edifying by God's grace I love chapter 7 chapter 7 is is just a tremendous chapter here I trust those scriptures were helpful um it's so important to keep going over these you know we got people that are single uh we got young people we need to teach you know as they're growing up here they really need to understand marriage and divorce uh brother Ram said it's the second greatest decision in your life the most greatest decision is to follow Christ become a Christian the second biggest decision is who you're going to marry so super important to cover this tonight as we preach through the the book of Corinthians I hope that was a blessing and I also want to revisit the one way there can be divorce and remarriage and then just a little bit on interracial marriage hope that was a help by God's grace well let's bow our heads here tonight father God we thank you for the word of God that we've heard thank you that the people could read and Lord ask a few questions Lord God thank you for the word and it's true it's it's true continuity Lord as your Prophet said the Bible doesn't contradict itself that's why we know it's a holy book
