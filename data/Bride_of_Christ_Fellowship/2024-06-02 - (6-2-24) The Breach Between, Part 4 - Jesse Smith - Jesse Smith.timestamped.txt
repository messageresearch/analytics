[0:42] verses 8 n and 10 I'll read eight and N
[0:46] then we can just read 10 together there
[0:48] by God's
[0:49] grace and when he had taken the book The
[0:51] Four beasts and the four and 20 Elders
[0:53] fell down before the lamb having every
[0:55] one of them Harps and golden vows full
[0:57] of odors which are the prayer
[1:00] of the Saints and they sung a new song
[1:03] saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[1:05] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[1:07] was slain and H has redeemed us to God
[1:11] by thy blood out of every Kindred and
[1:13] tongue and people and
[1:16] Nation verse 10 let's read that together
[1:18] ready one two three and H has made us
[1:21] unto our God Kings and Priests and we
[1:25] shall reign on the earth may God add his
[1:28] Blessing to ring of his word you can be
[1:29] SE
[1:33] so we'll take a little thought on this
[1:34] here part four uh the breach
[1:43] between I just want to get a quick
[1:45] definition of sublime brother brother
[1:47] Brandon mentioned
[1:51] Sublime so we'll look to that here by
[1:53] God's
[1:54] grace sorry about that so we'll look
[1:57] here part four and we're going to pick
[1:59] up here here uh where we kind of left
[2:01] off there on Wednesday night
[2:06] sorry how many thankful for the eight
[2:08] covenants praise God everybody thankful
[2:09] for that Hallelujah I've been thankful
[2:11] for that thank God for Amazing Grace the
[2:13] blood of Jesus Christ uh to redeem us
[2:15] back to what we read here to be Kings
[2:17] and Priests unto God hallelujah so uh we
[2:21] we'll look at here uh this first part of
[2:24] the of the the the
[2:26] chapter uh we looked at verses 1 through
[2:30] seven the last three services
[2:33] here last time we ended with uh last
[2:37] last two Wednesdays ago rather with the
[2:38] line of the tribe of Judah Jesus is the
[2:41] lion of the tribe of Judah Hallelujah
[2:43] he's the root of David uh this speaks of
[2:45] course of the godhead that speaks of
[2:47] someone who came before David and this
[2:49] person is still alive Hallelujah and the
[2:52] Bible said no man was worthy so uh this
[2:55] can't be a man a natural man a natural
[2:58] descendant of David it's got to be the
[3:00] god before David Hallelujah the God who
[3:03] created David it's got to be the root of
[3:05] all men it's got to be God Almighty
[3:07] Hallelujah so we see the godhead uh
[3:10] plainly in this uh scripture here in
[3:12] verses uh five and six and seven
[3:15] Hallelujah and we ended with how brother
[3:17] random talked about when he was out in
[3:19] Africa hunting he'd hear all the animals
[3:22] the elephants and uh the Beatles and
[3:24] everything he said but when that lion
[3:25] would Roar everything was quiet
[3:28] Hallelujah brother Ram said that's a
[3:30] type he said of right here he said of
[3:32] this Bible when the Bible speaks he said
[3:35] every doubt is quietened hallelujah
[3:39] every denomination is silence brother
[3:41] Ram says when the Bible speaks
[3:43] hallelujah amen and so we're thankful
[3:45] Hallelujah that we're not denominated
[3:47] Hallelujah but we're free in Christ
[3:49] Jesus uh brother Ram said we're not an
[3:51] organization he said we're an
[3:54] organism we are a living organism
[3:57] Hallelujah Lord we are part of the body
[3:59] of Christ aren't you gladen hallelujah
[4:02] amen uh we are the body of Jesus Christ
[4:05] and Paul says that some might be the
[4:06] nose and the ear and the finger and the
[4:09] thumb he said one member can't say to
[4:12] the other I don't have a need of you
[4:15] because in a natural body you have need
[4:16] of all your members Amen in fact you
[4:19] only feel normal when your whole body is
[4:22] in one Accord
[4:23] Hallelujah if one thing gets thrown off
[4:26] uh the rest Everything feels like it's
[4:28] awful right every you get one major
[4:30] injury or one major uh sickness and it
[4:33] feels like the world's going to end
[4:35] right uh is this the end you might ask
[4:37] yourself and that's how it is in the
[4:38] body of Christ we have to be uh uh fully
[4:41] aware of one another the Bible said one
[4:43] member must care for the other each and
[4:46] every member must feel one for the other
[4:48] praise God when one weeps we must all
[4:51] weep when one rejoices we must all
[4:54] Rejoice Hallelujah and so we're a body
[4:56] we're a living organism Hallelujah we
[4:59] see it mainly from the scripture as we
[5:01] said from 1 Corinthians 12 and other
[5:03] places but I want to look here back in
[5:05] Revelation 5 here I'm going to read uh
[5:07] some of these quotes starting uh
[5:08] paragraph 151 from the breach if you
[5:11] haven't listened to that I really
[5:12] encourage you to do that listen to uh
[5:14] the second half of it yesterday
[5:15] beautiful beautiful ending to The Sermon
[5:17] Hallelujah and brother man said now we
[5:19] go when we go into breaking these seals
[5:22] you're going to see it goes Plum back in
[5:24] the scripture all the way back for each
[5:26] one of those seals the whole thing
[5:29] together the whole mystery lays right
[5:32] here in these
[5:34] seals see every mystery of the Bible
[5:37] lays in these seals brother knocks on
[5:41] the pulpit five times and the seals
[5:43] cannot be broken until that time I prove
[5:46] it here in just a minute he says
[5:48] remember the book is sealed here's one
[5:49] here it is this seal then another one is
[5:51] wrapped another seal another one's
[5:53] wrapped a seal it's a book of redemption
[5:55] and the whole thing together makes the
[5:57] book it's seal with Seven Seals
[6:00] he says and the seal mystery is on the
[6:02] inside it only says white horse rider or
[6:05] black horse rider and what more on the
[6:07] on the outside but the mystery of the
[6:09] whole book is in them seals from Genesis
[6:12] to
[6:14] Revelation the complete Plan of
[6:16] Redemption is revealed in these Seven
[6:18] Seals and oh it's an important time God
[6:21] help us he says to get it
[6:25] Hallelujah so I just want to uh share
[6:27] this in case if you can switch over here
[6:29] I just want to share this little visual
[6:31] uh by God's
[6:34] grace I kind of made a I made a video
[6:37] the other just the other day about this
[6:39] but I just want to bring this out you
[6:40] know that uh I haven't spent maybe just
[6:43] maybe one hour maybe less looking at
[6:45] this idea but brother Ram said the whole
[6:47] mystery lays in those
[6:49] seals I thought my that's just quite a
[6:51] statement to make isn't it the whole
[6:53] mystery of the Bible and Redemption lays
[6:56] in the
[6:57] seals well what's the word redemption
[6:59] mean it means purchase out of a slave
[7:03] market purchase and now you become the
[7:06] property of the person who purchased you
[7:09] actually it literally means a slave
[7:10] market if you look in the Greek there
[7:12] the word
[7:13] Redemption so somehow in the seals we
[7:17] see uh the purchase of the whole Plan of
[7:21] Redemption so the whole
[7:22] world must be somehow redeemed in the
[7:26] seals glory amen and what became a
[7:29] revelation to me as I made a put a video
[7:31] out yesterday was Revelation 5 is where
[7:33] we see that in Revelation 5 we see a
[7:36] lamb steps forth and John of course is
[7:40] crying uh because uh no man is worthy to
[7:43] look at the book and this is a very
[7:44] important book in heaven Hallelujah but
[7:47] then a lamb steps forth the voice says
[7:49] it's a lion but when John looks it's a
[7:52] lamb
[7:53] Hallelujah and it's bloody as it had
[7:56] been slain glory amen and so here
[8:00] uh we see a lamb comes forth and then
[8:02] the the voice says don't weep stop
[8:06] crying There's Hope Hallelujah the lamb
[8:10] has given us hope amen and then the
[8:12] voices say the lamb hath already
[8:15] redeemed us
[8:16] hallelujah and so we and then the Bible
[8:18] says uh they've been
[8:20] redeemed in verse n we've been redeemed
[8:23] out of every Kindred tongue people and
[8:26] Nation well every Kindred represents the
[8:28] Gentiles not just the Jews but in
[8:31] Revelation five we see the Gentiles are
[8:34] also Redeemed by the Lamb of God oh my
[8:38] and brother the whole plan the whole
[8:41] secret of of the Plan of Redemption is
[8:44] in the seals Hallelujah well that means
[8:48] everything you know from the Genesis all
[8:50] the way down everything in the Old
[8:52] Testament was foreshadowing who Jesus
[8:54] Christ brother said if you don't see
[8:56] Jesus in the Old Testament verse go back
[8:58] and read it again in amen because
[9:01] everything was pointing to Jesus Christ
[9:03] so 4,000 years of human history all uh
[9:06] accumulated in the sacrifice of Jesus
[9:09] Christ the death burial and Resurrection
[9:12] Hallelujah and we can see the whole Plan
[9:14] of Redemption fulfilled in these seals
[9:17] brother Ram tells us amen hallelujah now
[9:20] this is a little out of order but
[9:21] Revelation five we see the godhead
[9:23] because he's the root of David the LI of
[9:25] the tribe of Judah he's not like any
[9:27] other man Hallelujah he wasn't born in
[9:30] sin David said in in sin my mother
[9:32] conceived me but but David's mom wasn't
[9:35] in fornication and what what it means is
[9:38] the sin nature passed from David's
[9:40] parents to
[9:41] him Hallelujah and so a lamb had to come
[9:45] who is not born of sin he came by the
[9:48] Virgin birth God had to bypass the way
[9:51] sin came into the world through adultery
[9:55] right God had to bypass that and bring
[9:58] forth a lamb a worthy sacrifice who was
[10:01] virgin born in order to redeem every
[10:04] Kindred tribe tongue and Nation
[10:06] hallelujah amen hallelujah and so that
[10:08] shows us this is the secret of the whole
[10:11] Plan of
[10:12] Redemption Hallelujah because of Adam
[10:15] and Eve it it plunged all of humanity
[10:17] into sin and the only way to get them
[10:20] out was a redeemer Hallelujah a a price
[10:23] that could be paid and it had to be a
[10:25] virgin born Redeemer brother said a
[10:28] kinsman redeemer rer Hallelujah someone
[10:30] who is near to us hallelujah a relative
[10:33] oh that ought to make you happy you've
[10:35] got a relative in heaven and his name is
[10:37] Jesus
[10:38] Hallelujah he's your kidsman amen he's a
[10:41] part of the family of God your family
[10:43] Hallelujah I just read this morning in
[10:46] Acts 17 you are The Offspring of
[10:48] God you are God's Offspring you are
[10:51] God's children and remember the Bible
[10:53] said he's determined the times therefore
[10:56] appointed so God determined you live in
[10:58] the seven Church age and he determined
[11:00] the bounds of your habitation where
[11:02] you'd live amen hallelujah it was all in
[11:06] the mind of God it was all in the plan
[11:09] of God brother said nothing is out of
[11:11] cater amen the Rapture will be right on
[11:13] time hallelujah amen nothing's out of
[11:16] cater Hallelujah everything's going
[11:19] right according to the plan of God
[11:21] hallelujah amen he said the Rapture
[11:23] won't be one minute late Hallelujah so
[11:26] that means there's nothing we can do to
[11:27] speed it up there's nothing we can do to
[11:28] slow it down it's going to be right on
[11:30] time Hallelujah all you've got to do
[11:32] church is make yourself ready for the
[11:35] bride has made herself ready hallelujah
[11:38] amen each time you hear the voice of God
[11:40] you just got to accept what the word of
[11:42] God says apply it to your life
[11:44] Hallelujah and God will make you ready
[11:47] for his coming hallelujah how many
[11:49] believe we're getting the word in due
[11:50] season Hallelujah I believe it I believe
[11:54] it I believe we're a church that has
[11:55] unleavened bread Hallelujah brother man
[11:58] said all the the leavens got to be
[12:00] cleaned out Paul says that in 1
[12:01] Corinthians 5 all the leavens got to be
[12:04] cleaned out and then you feel like a new
[12:05] lump a new church hallelujah praise God
[12:09] a church without sin a church without
[12:11] guilt a church without condemnation
[12:13] that's the Blood Bought Church that's
[12:14] the Church of the Living God hallelujah
[12:18] amen glory now but said the whole Plan
[12:22] of Redemption so here we already see the
[12:24] redemptions by the lamb God God brother
[12:27] said God became kin folks unto
[12:30] us hallelujah God became a man
[12:33] Hallelujah CU his own law required a
[12:36] kinsman redeemer his own law required an
[12:38] innocent substitute an innocent
[12:40] sacrifice and no one could provide it so
[12:43] God had to provide it himself Jehovah
[12:45] Gyra God provided himself a sacrifice
[12:49] hallelujah oh my glory but in the first
[12:52] seal we see at least two Mysteries the
[12:54] mystery of iniquity and you see the the
[12:56] first Beast right the first Beast
[12:59] tells John about this and the first
[13:02] Beast of course was the lion the lion
[13:04] anointing and brother said thus say the
[13:06] Lord those four beasts are the
[13:07] anointings of the Holy Spirit upon the
[13:10] seven Church ages so now we see the
[13:12] revelation of the church ages in the
[13:14] seals because you have to have the
[13:16] anointing for the church ages hallelujah
[13:20] amen oh it's beautiful and and so
[13:22] there's at least I think there's seven
[13:23] Mysteries here one that are actually
[13:25] called Mysteries the mystery of iniquity
[13:26] of course is the white horse rider it's
[13:28] the Antichrist Spirit he always starts
[13:31] remember he's got a foret process he
[13:32] starts as a false teacher right and then
[13:35] he goes to Red a bloody red and we know
[13:37] today if it's not we know today they are
[13:39] killing Christians in Nigeria all kinds
[13:41] of places I think 880,000 they said
[13:43] Christians have been killed in Nigeria
[13:45] within the last decade or something it's
[13:48] just awful it it turns bloody red and
[13:51] then it turns black the Blackness of uh
[13:53] of uh the the Blackness of of a kingdom
[13:56] right it sets up the kingdom it's a
[13:57] money Kingdom with a balance and they
[13:59] take over it's the Dark Ages it darkens
[14:02] out the whole body it darkens out their
[14:03] whole false church and the last step is
[14:06] the pale death death sets in spiritual
[14:09] death sets in and they basically uh
[14:12] cross the line of line between mercy and
[14:15] judgment we're talking about false
[14:17] churches brother calls that Jezebel
[14:19] religion right and so that's the mystery
[14:22] of iniquity it starts with it's just a
[14:23] false it starts with a saying and then
[14:25] it turns to a Doctrine and then it
[14:27] becomes the unbending way Hallelujah
[14:29] that's right so we see that now I don't
[14:32] really have any Revelations for the
[14:33] second seal but the third seal we see
[14:35] the oil and wine and the oil is the
[14:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and
[14:40] the wine brother says the stimulation of
[14:42] Revelation remember Ephesians 17 says we
[14:46] should be under the spirit of wisdom and
[14:49] Revelation amen hallelujah and so we
[14:52] must be under the spear John said I was
[14:55] in the spirit on the Lord's day amen so
[14:58] we when we come to church or when we We
[14:59] Gather with the Saints we can't be under
[15:01] our our spirit we got to be under God's
[15:03] spirit Hallelujah and then the
[15:05] Revelation comes
[15:07] amen
[15:09] hallelujah and then I have nothing
[15:11] really on the four seal but the fifth
[15:12] seal and of course the beasts are in
[15:13] each one of these but then the fifth
[15:16] seal is the Bible calls it Israel's
[15:17] blindness that is a
[15:19] mystery they were you know in the Old
[15:21] Testament Israel was grafted into the
[15:23] holy tree but they were cut off yet God
[15:25] still saves the people as long as they
[15:27] keep the testimony of the the word of
[15:29] God they don't have the testimony of
[15:31] Jesus Christ because they're blinded to
[15:33] it but God will save them because
[15:35] they're blinded and we see them under
[15:37] the altar saying how long to you avenge
[15:39] our blood how long how long Lord holy
[15:43] and true amen hallelujah I love it I
[15:46] love it God is talking to them in
[15:49] heaven even though they didn't know
[15:51] Jesus Jesus is merciful even though
[15:53] Jesus blinded them he's talking to them
[15:55] amen my what a mighty God we serve amen
[15:58] what a god of Mercy what a God of Grace
[16:00] hallelujah amen and then I love this six
[16:04] seal this one just exploded it felt like
[16:05] it exploded in my thoughts
[16:08] yesterday The Sixth Seal brother BR
[16:10] calls it the tribulation
[16:12] seal right and I just started thinking
[16:14] about that well that ties in Daniel 70
[16:17] weeks right and Daniel 70 weeks has the
[16:20] Everlasting uh righteousness which is
[16:22] the
[16:23] Millennium right Gabriel's six-fold
[16:25] purpose of vising the last one was
[16:27] bringing Everlasting ing
[16:30] righteousness right so we know once uh
[16:32] once Israel is redeemed it'll bring in
[16:35] the
[16:35] Millennium no wonder brother said the
[16:37] whole Plan of Redemption is in these
[16:39] seals hallelujah oh we can go back to
[16:42] the beginning we can go back to the
[16:44] beginning and see it was adultery was
[16:47] the fruit the forbidden
[16:48] fruit right we can go back to the
[16:50] beginning and then we can see how God uh
[16:53] grafted in the Gentiles he had to cut
[16:55] off the Jews but he's bringing both Jew
[16:57] and Gentile back back Hallelujah he's
[17:00] taking two folds and he's going to make
[17:02] one fold Hallelujah so all the Sheep of
[17:05] God can be in the fold of God the fold
[17:08] of the great Shepherd Hallelujah no
[17:10] wonder brother says the whole Plan of
[17:12] Redemption is seen in those seals
[17:14] hallelujah
[17:16] amen oh my thank you Lord amen you even
[17:20] have mystery Babylon in there because
[17:22] that's that's where she gets judged
[17:23] during the the six
[17:25] seal another
[17:27] mystery how Hallelujah then you get the
[17:29] 144,000 SE with the Holy Ghost that's
[17:32] their
[17:32] Redemption that's when they recognize
[17:35] we've been purchased we've been bought
[17:37] by the blood of the lamb and we confess
[17:39] our sins and a spe and a fountain is
[17:42] open in the House of David think of it
[17:45] all these let let me just just dramatize
[17:47] it all these think about all the 145
[17:50] 44,000 they're blinded they're garments
[17:53] are still kind of dirty think of that
[17:55] you and I look at each other our gu we
[17:58] really have spiritual garments of white
[17:59] on if I looked at William he's got a
[18:01] nice blue and black there like me huh
[18:03] blue and black but really it's a white
[18:06] garment Hallelujah and if you looked at
[18:09] me the right way you'd see a white
[18:10] garment
[18:11] Hallelujah but in Israel the 144,000 now
[18:14] they're growing to that number
[18:16] spiritually they might look they're
[18:18] they're really rich or they really look
[18:19] really nice you know but really they got
[18:21] garments that are dirty and they got
[18:23] blindfolds on they're walking around
[18:25] stumbling through the darkness think
[18:26] about that but we're and and now the
[18:28] whole world around us is doing the
[18:31] same right but they're totally actually
[18:33] the Bible says they don't even have
[18:34] garments they're naked spiritually they
[18:36] don't even have they're just in sin
[18:38] blinded right but we've got white
[18:41] garments
[18:43] on but when Jesus reveals himself he
[18:46] shows them where'd you get those I got
[18:48] those in the house of my friends
[18:49] Hallelujah and when he shows it the
[18:51] Bible said they'll mourn they'll weep
[18:53] and then in one day 144,000 will'll get
[18:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[18:59] and the blinders will come off and the
[19:02] the garments they'll wash their garments
[19:04] in the fountain filled with blood drawn
[19:06] from emanuel's veins hallelujah oh the
[19:10] whole Plan of Redemption Hallelujah is
[19:12] in these seals thank God we're Redeemed
[19:15] by the blood of the Lamb
[19:18] Hallelujah now I'm going to come back to
[19:20] that so I'm going to pull it off just
[19:22] because then your eyes don't hurt
[19:25] Hallelujah so I love what brother Ram
[19:27] says that's the first point I want to
[19:28] bring and that that comes out of this
[19:29] sermon the whole Plan of Redemption is
[19:32] in those
[19:34] seals oh my see I could take a whole
[19:37] another sermon on that because what's
[19:39] our anointing the eagle
[19:41] anointing right where where uh I was
[19:44] listening yesterday to a preacher Eagles
[19:46] actually conceive their children mating
[19:49] in the air they're actually conceived in
[19:52] Heavenly
[19:53] places and you were chosen in Christ in
[19:56] the mind of Christ before the foundation
[19:59] of the world no wonder the Bible says
[20:01] you and I are already accepted in the
[20:03] Beloved hallelujah amen that's where our
[20:06] Eagle children are made that that's
[20:08] where they're formed Hallelujah in
[20:10] Heavenly places Hallelujah and then the
[20:13] Bible says if you need strength wait on
[20:15] the Lord and God will renew your
[20:17] strength like the eagle praise God so
[20:20] you can soar You Can Fly Above All these
[20:23] Earthbound elements get your eyes off of
[20:27] the things of the world and get Your
[20:28] Eyes On Christ to give you a Heavenly
[20:30] perspective of things
[20:32] hallelujah oh my that's part of
[20:35] redemption Hallelujah that's part of our
[20:38] Redemption amen now we can see it
[20:40] plainly
[20:41] hallelujah what a beautiful message
[20:44] there brother Ram gives us now I want to
[20:46] read this one
[20:47] too brother R said the Angel's call was
[20:50] for the kinsman redeemer to appear God
[20:52] said I have a law a kinsman redeemer can
[20:54] be a substitute where's that kinsman
[20:56] redeemer who's able to take it and it
[20:58] come from Adam all the way down through
[21:00] the apostles and Prophets and everything
[21:01] else and nobody was found now what about
[21:04] it nobody in heaven nobody on Earth
[21:07] nobody that ever lived brother said
[21:09] Elijah was standing there so Adam Elijah
[21:14] Moses was standing there now here's an
[21:16] interesting thought before I
[21:19] forget here you've got Old Testament
[21:22] Saints now if this is true I'm just
[21:24] saying if it's a if Old Testament Saints
[21:27] in the seventh dimension
[21:30] that's a quote okay now we know at least
[21:33] 24 are there in the seventh
[21:36] Dimension praise
[21:38] God right now we know brother man went
[21:40] beyond the curtain of time here's why
[21:41] I'm sharing this he said that voice said
[21:43] you can't see him
[21:44] yet because he's higher well the only
[21:47] way higher you could go is the seventh
[21:48] Dimension right okay so just thought I'd
[21:51] lay that in there just for your thoughts
[21:52] okay I don't know if this is dramatized
[21:54] or what but we know we have at least 24
[21:56] that are in that seventh dimension
[21:59] the souls on the altar would be in the
[22:00] sixth
[22:01] Dimension the altar of incense right
[22:04] where the Bible says they're under the
[22:05] altar crying how long that's where the
[22:07] Jews are Hallelujah I believe also the
[22:08] foolish virgin are there as well that's
[22:10] what I believe they got to have a place
[22:11] where they can go Hallelujah where
[22:13] there's not torment where there's uh
[22:15] Sublime life Hallelujah where there's
[22:17] eternal life amen hallelujah he said all
[22:21] the apostles were standing there or all
[22:23] the ones that had died all the holy men
[22:25] job and the Sages
[22:28] so you got Moses Adam Elijah job
[22:32] standing
[22:33] there everyone standing there and nobody
[22:35] was even worthy to look at the book let
[22:39] alone to take it and break the
[22:41] seals now brother says this now where is
[22:44] the pope and all these at they call him
[22:47] Holy Father Heaven said no man is
[22:52] Holy
[22:53] Hallelujah where is these message
[22:55] preachers that are the greatest of all
[22:57] time where's their Hool that's right I'm
[22:59] just I'm just sharing that you know just
[23:01] a thought where's the pope where's Mary
[23:04] brother said where's Mary Mother of God
[23:06] Mother of God we know it's not true God
[23:08] don't have a mother
[23:11] right brother said where is your Bishop
[23:14] now we're not we don't have a
[23:15] bishop where he says where is our
[23:18] worthiness
[23:20] ah he says we're nothing that's right
[23:24] Hallelujah he asked for the kinsman
[23:26] redeemer to step forward if he could but
[23:28] said no man is
[23:33] worthy all right now switch back
[23:38] here here we
[23:42] go now our precious brother Paul how
[23:45] many enjoyed his sermon last Sunday
[23:46] morning oh was a
[23:48] masterpiece I I probably say that too
[23:51] much but but I'll say like this we got
[23:53] the Holy Ghost lots of sermons are going
[23:54] to be
[23:55] masterpieces because the man has yielded
[23:57] to God
[23:59] right
[24:00] Hallelujah now we went to this church
[24:03] I've been there twice right I preached
[24:04] twice there my family went once malach
[24:06] has been twice I think he's got this
[24:09] hanging up by the pastor's
[24:11] office anybody recognize any pictures in
[24:15] there he said that's Moses because
[24:18] there's a statue of Moses I think
[24:19] Michelangelo did it or some famous he's
[24:22] got those horns coming up you know
[24:23] because they thought in those days uh
[24:25] they had horns I forget why they had
[24:27] horns
[24:28] oh his mistranslation of the Bible okay
[24:31] now this is Elijah now look brother Paul
[24:33] put the pillar of fire there because our
[24:36] Elijah had a pillar of fire and the
[24:38] pillar of fire would had to guide Elijah
[24:40] and Elisha because the spirit of God
[24:43] right Hallelujah the Bible said John the
[24:46] Baptist Spirit of Elijah was a burning
[24:48] and Shining Light hallelujah amen and he
[24:51] saw the spirit of God descending like a
[24:53] dove amen so the pillar of fire always
[24:56] accompanies the spirit of Elijah
[25:00] now look brother Paul and let let's just
[25:02] just read what he said here now that's
[25:04] the verse here here this is the same
[25:06] thing I just made it larger so y'all
[25:08] could read it don't have to strain your
[25:09] eyes the seven seal book was so sacred
[25:12] that even all the great sages of the
[25:14] Bible cannot even look at it only the
[25:16] Lamb of God Jesus Christ could take the
[25:19] book and open it for our Redemption so
[25:22] here's the pictures that brother Paul
[25:23] felt led to uh draw we got Moses Noah
[25:27] Daniel job and Elijah brother R
[25:31] mentioned now brother doesn't mention
[25:32] Daniel at least what I
[25:34] remember or Noah but he mentions Moses
[25:36] job and
[25:38] Elijah so look again but I just love
[25:41] this so this is the picture of our
[25:43] brother it had that he had in his mind
[25:46] right this is a manifestation of what he
[25:49] had in his mind Hallelujah John's crying
[25:53] no man's worthy and look the Bible said
[25:55] no no man can even look at the books
[25:57] everybody has turned away from the
[25:58] Throne of God no one's even worthy to
[26:00] look at
[26:01] it you know we know Moses wasn't worthy
[26:04] he murdered a man he didn't circumcise
[26:07] his boys and the angel was going to kill
[26:09] him right he he got angry he smoked the
[26:12] rock instead of speaking to the Rock You
[26:14] bunch of
[26:15] rebels that's real awful preacher talk
[26:18] isn't it right
[26:19] there right Noah got drunk you know
[26:23] right
[26:25] afterwards uh we don't have any bad on
[26:27] Daniel but he wasn't
[26:29] worthy right how about the grace of God
[26:32] that you live such a life God don't
[26:33] record that about you Daniel lives such
[26:34] a life Joseph's like that too Joseph
[26:36] just one time said you should lie
[26:38] because you're not Shepherds
[26:41] right uh who's that one job of course we
[26:43] know job we we preached through job
[26:45] pretty thoroughly a little bit and
[26:46] enjoyed that by God's grace Elijah we
[26:48] don't see much of him although when he
[26:49] when the anointing left him he ran away
[26:51] from the threat of Jezebel wanted to die
[26:53] he prayed that he would die he thought
[26:55] I'm the only one left God said I've got
[26:57] 7,000 that haven't bowed the
[26:59] knee Hallelujah just a beautiful picture
[27:03] and only one person's worthy Hallelujah
[27:06] the lamb who's bloody Hallelujah he's
[27:09] got seven eyes seven horns Hallelujah
[27:12] he's the only one worthy to take this
[27:14] book and remember this is a book of your
[27:16] Redemption this is a book of the rights
[27:19] and Dominion that Adam forfeited in the
[27:22] garden brother R said this is also the
[27:24] book of dominion he said eternal life
[27:27] amen
[27:29] Hallelujah and only one person was
[27:32] worthy to come and open this it was
[27:35] Jesus Christ Hallelujah so no matter how
[27:38] famous you are in heaven glory amen no
[27:40] matter what you've done no matter what
[27:42] your Works do nothing is greater than
[27:44] Jesus Christ Hallelujah because it was
[27:46] Jesus Christ that gave you the strength
[27:48] to do it
[27:49] hallelujah it's Jesus Christ that gave
[27:51] you the grace to do what you do
[27:53] hallelujah amen there'll be no boasting
[27:56] in heaven none of these guys could boast
[28:00] Hallelujah only one was worthy
[28:02] hallelujah oh I'm so glad that Jesus
[28:04] Christ is worthy
[28:06] Hallelujah and we know him
[28:08] Hallelujah brother said this is the most
[28:11] Sublime thing in scripture let me read
[28:12] you what Webster calls it sublim means
[28:16] lofty or grand exalted in thought
[28:19] expression or manner outstanding
[28:22] spiritual or intellectual or moral
[28:26] worth it means tending to Inspire awe or
[28:30] like this is awesome or uh usually
[28:33] because of elevated quality maybe beauty
[28:36] or nobility or Grandeur or Transcendent
[28:40] Excellence so Excellence Beyond
[28:43] Excellence brother Ram said Sublime
[28:45] Beyond
[28:47] Sublime in other words this is so high
[28:49] and lofty we can't really express it
[28:53] Hallelujah brother said this chapter is
[28:56] the most Sublime thing in the whole
[28:58] Bible
[29:00] Hallelujah because everyone was unworthy
[29:03] we weren't going to get eternal life we
[29:05] weren't going to get the rights back we
[29:07] weren't going to get Dominion back we
[29:08] weren't going to be able to live upon
[29:10] the Earth in the Millennium unless
[29:12] somebody came and took the book and
[29:14] opened it and revealed it to us and then
[29:16] sent it down to the seventh angel so
[29:19] that every he can preach it and then we
[29:21] can eat the book and take it to every
[29:23] Kindred tuong and Nation oh my oh it
[29:25] just it was impossible Hallelujah
[29:28] oh ah it's amazing
[29:31] Hallelujah another one is
[29:34] supreme complete or
[29:38] utter oh
[29:41] my how many enjoy that praise God just
[29:45] it's amazing so I thought I'd share that
[29:48] with you how many appreciate that I
[29:49] texted the brother the other day I'm
[29:50] like brother can you please send me that
[29:51] picture I want to show that to the
[29:53] Saints Hallelujah as such as soon as I
[29:55] saw I'm like that's inspired something
[29:56] struck me like that's of God
[29:59] that man's quite artist is he I
[30:00] appreciate how go he's using his talents
[30:02] for the Lord
[30:04] hallelujah amen so bam said Elijah Moses
[30:07] job all the sages were standing there no
[30:10] one had any Holiness he said we're
[30:14] nothing remember John 155 apart from him
[30:17] we can do
[30:19] nothing my life accomplishes nothing
[30:21] unless Christ is in it hallelujah how do
[30:24] I let him in it seek first the kingdom
[30:26] of God and his righteousness amen that's
[30:29] how I let him in it Hallelujah I seek
[30:32] him I yield to him
[30:33] Hallelujah now I want to lay this in
[30:35] here this is a more of a message
[30:38] uh uh a message
[30:42] topic you know there's some message
[30:44] churches that say intercession is over
[30:47] now they're a very small group right uh
[30:50] and they say nobody else is getting
[30:51] saved I've had people tell that to
[30:53] different people I know and they've told
[30:55] me that that they believe no one else is
[30:56] getting saved now that's the extreme of
[30:58] it now the minor part is you can only
[31:01] get saved in a message church that's a
[31:03] false Doctrine it's still but still it's
[31:06] a minor form of what this other form is
[31:09] nobody's getting saved right now now see
[31:12] what does that do it stops people from
[31:14] having hope and praying for others it
[31:16] stops missionary work it stops
[31:19] Outreach you see how it shut no no it
[31:22] shuts down the faith of the
[31:23] people no wonder we looked at that uh
[31:26] heus and fitus I think it was Paul said
[31:29] they said the resurrection is already
[31:31] passed and their word eats as a
[31:34] canker see if you start believeing the
[31:36] wrong thing it's going to eat away the
[31:39] spiritual life that you have it's going
[31:42] to take away uh the Outreach of the
[31:45] church the hope of the church and the
[31:47] Bible said it destroys the faith of
[31:50] many oh we have we have we have the
[31:53] Bible said we have a hope that reaches
[31:54] Beyond the Veil in heaven Hallelujah
[31:58] see how these false doctrines they
[31:59] create this this uh uh this sick
[32:02] spiritual condition I'll say it like
[32:04] that now but here's why you know even
[32:07] brother Braham grew in his understanding
[32:09] so I want you to listen to this brother
[32:10] BR said now here comes a lamb now his
[32:12] intercessory days is over the M uh the
[32:15] mediatorial
[32:17] days okay so just bear with me on this
[32:20] he said that's when the angel is going
[32:21] to stand there you wait and we get them
[32:23] seals and time shall be no more uh case
[32:26] you put up Revelation 10
[32:29] six boy I've been around a lot of
[32:31] preachers and you be interested I think
[32:33] every preacher has a little different
[32:34] thought on this
[32:36] here Revelation
[32:38] 10:6 so of course brother man's Ministry
[32:41] is revelation 10:7 right but Revelation
[32:43] 106 says and swear by him that liveth
[32:45] forever and ever this when the mighty
[32:46] Angel comes down with the open book The
[32:48] Seven Seals are broken Glory
[32:53] Allelujah and then he says uh that there
[32:56] shall be time no longer
[32:58] now you'd be surprised I'm sure brother
[32:59] Williams Heard lots of interpretations
[33:01] of this over the years too so this is
[33:03] this is the verse many false teachers
[33:06] misinterpret they say see when when
[33:08] brother Braham got the open book when
[33:09] brother preached the seals uh time was
[33:11] no more now we're in the
[33:13] Millennium there's some people that
[33:15] believe that nonsense because they
[33:17] misinterpret this right the only way
[33:21] that this makes sense is the right way
[33:24] that that it means there was no more
[33:27] time to wait wa for the seals to be open
[33:30] because the next verse says but in the
[33:31] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[33:33] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[33:35] of God shall be finished with he which
[33:37] he had declared to his servants the
[33:38] prophets amen got that one memorized
[33:40] hallelujah amen amen so see time will be
[33:44] no longer there's no more weight in
[33:46] other words this is when God is opening
[33:48] the book He's bringing it down he's
[33:51] revealing it to a seventh angel and
[33:53] everybody else has got to eat the book
[33:55] Hallelujah that's what your job is
[33:57] that's what my job is to eat the book
[33:59] The revelation of the Seven Seals
[34:01] Hallelujah but that that means the whole
[34:04] revelation of the entire Bible everybody
[34:07] understand so I'm not saying you just
[34:08] got to go listen to the seven seal
[34:09] sermons I'm saying you got to eat the
[34:11] whole book hallelujah amen you got to
[34:13] eat the whole Old Testament and New
[34:15] Testament
[34:19] Hallelujah so see so brother says here
[34:21] comes the lamb his intercession days are
[34:24] over he's talking about Revelation 5 the
[34:25] lamb comes forth out of the throne to
[34:28] take the book and brother said look his
[34:29] days of intercession are over that's why
[34:32] some people think there's no more
[34:36] intercession he says and you wait till
[34:38] we get to those seals and time shall be
[34:40] no more that half hour silence watch
[34:43] what takes place in that half hour of
[34:45] Silence when that seventh seal next
[34:46] Sunday night the Lord willing now pull
[34:48] up Revelation
[34:50] 81 I'm going to give you my I preached
[34:52] this before but I'm just going to lay
[34:53] these two out these are two of the most
[34:55] misunderstood scriptures in the whole
[34:56] message time shall be no longer people
[34:59] think oh uh there's no more time
[35:01] nonsense you just got to keep listening
[35:03] to brother brandom Hallelujah that's the
[35:04] problem they just don't listen to
[35:05] brother Ram enough uh and then this one
[35:10] when the Seven Seals broken there's uh
[35:12] silence in heaven about the space of
[35:14] half hour now I've heard all kinds of
[35:17] interpretations on this the only way
[35:19] that makes sense is what brother Ram
[35:20] said even before the seals in the church
[35:22] ages brother bam said the only way s
[35:25] Heaven would be silent is if the lamb
[35:27] left
[35:28] because all those cherubim are crying
[35:30] holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty
[35:32] the Bible say they don't cease day and
[35:34] night so the only reason they'd stop
[35:36] praising Jesus is if Jesus
[35:39] left right but you you'd be surprised
[35:42] you know people said this half hour
[35:44] silence was in March of 63 right after
[35:46] brother R preached that and then half an
[35:48] hour after the service there was silence
[35:49] in
[35:51] heaven what what did that what would
[35:53] that
[35:54] accomplish nothing you know it doesn't
[35:56] make any sense the only way this makes
[35:59] sense is that at the Rapture when Jesus
[36:01] leaves heaven to meet us in the air
[36:03] Heaven is silent because the mediator
[36:06] left the lamb left but as soon as he
[36:09] gets back I'm GNA I'm I'm going to
[36:10] assume they're going to hit resume on
[36:12] their worship and as soon as Jesus gets
[36:14] back they're going to say holy holy holy
[36:16] it's the Lord God Almighty
[36:18] amen just takes a little bit of time for
[36:21] Jesus to leave Heaven snatch his bride
[36:24] away and bring her out bring her back to
[36:26] the wedding reception in heaven and the
[36:28] marriage suffer the lamb
[36:30] Hallelujah that's the only thing that
[36:32] makes sense now these false doctrines
[36:33] and false ideas get some sense to you
[36:36] preacher is what I want to say you know
[36:38] in a nice way you know get on your knees
[36:40] pray about it hallelujah look at what's
[36:43] happened over these last 60 years almost
[36:45] since brother Ram's been off the scene
[36:46] it's 59 years since brother Ram's been
[36:48] off the scene look what's happened
[36:51] people like you and me we weren't even
[36:53] looking for the message and God came
[36:55] looking for
[36:56] us that's proof enough that there's
[36:59] still time to be saved amen there's
[37:01] proof enough that Jesus is still in
[37:03] heaven making intercession Hallelujah
[37:06] that he could save a Wretch like Me
[37:08] Hallelujah I wasn't looking for him he
[37:11] came looking for me Hallelujah I was
[37:14] lost but now I'm found hallelujah amen I
[37:17] was blind but now I see the word
[37:21] amen that's proof enough all their false
[37:24] doctrines are false it's just ridiculous
[37:28] they asked brother brandom in questions
[37:30] and answers part three uh 64 brother
[37:33] brandom some say Mercy's over and no one
[37:35] can be saved now again let me say this I
[37:37] understand why people could think that
[37:39] because brother Ram said when the lamb
[37:40] came forth to break the seals there's no
[37:42] more intercession brother ramam said
[37:43] that numerous times in this
[37:45] sermon right I've talked to cam about it
[37:47] Simon I've talked to all kinds of
[37:48] preachers about it brother mam thought
[37:50] that's what it meant brother man thought
[37:53] at one time the lamb would come he break
[37:54] the seals and then the Rapture would
[37:56] happen that's what that's kind of what
[37:57] he thought thought there
[38:00] right but they ask him a year later a
[38:03] year and five months later so 17 months
[38:06] later they ask him is Mercy
[38:09] over some say Mercy's over no one can be
[38:12] saved we watch the prayer lines and it
[38:15] seems some are still finding Mercy how
[38:17] many found Mercy out here
[38:19] today thank you God it's still rewriting
[38:22] my life Hallelujah God's Mercy is still
[38:24] rewriting my life amen
[38:28] is Mercy over don't never think
[38:34] that don't never think
[38:37] that now what it be interesting to you
[38:39] if you remember I preached U Souls that
[38:41] are in prison now and brother R based
[38:44] upon his vision he saw JC Penney
[38:46] remember he saw these women coming up
[38:48] with the blue and the green on their
[38:49] faces and in the vision it's like he
[38:53] it's like heaven was showing him this is
[38:55] their sole condition they're just
[38:56] grunting like uh kind of like zombies or
[38:58] something I don't that's not the word he
[38:59] uses but it just looks like dead
[39:02] Souls you know just brother sees them
[39:04] coming up and brother says it's like
[39:06] hell was opened up and all these uh
[39:09] demons are coming out and brother R was
[39:11] so impacted by that he's like honey are
[39:13] you done shopping I need to leave here
[39:15] and he goes back to Jeffersonville and
[39:17] he didn't even tell me about it he said
[39:19] ma is waiting on this tape so he was so
[39:22] moved by that vision of hell that you
[39:25] know he preaches Souls that are in
[39:26] prison now and I never finished that
[39:29] that that sermon I need to finish that
[39:30] maybe this summer by God's grace but
[39:32] brother B ends a sermon by saying he
[39:34] said maybe Mercy's over he said because
[39:37] i' by the vision I'm starting to see
[39:39] these demonic forces coming up maybe
[39:41] Mercy's over let's pray for those uh
[39:44] that they're not saved he said I've got
[39:46] family I've got children that are not in
[39:48] the Holy Ghost and they spend the last
[39:50] 15 or 20 minutes praying and brother man
[39:53] ends that sermon by saying no Smiles as
[39:55] we leave this place now what if I did
[39:59] he said this is a solemn hour now that
[40:01] was the morning service they come back
[40:02] and now they're happy in the evening
[40:03] because they realize that Mercy's not
[40:04] over my brother ad said Shake one
[40:06] other's hand not even a smile he says
[40:09] because just because the impact of that
[40:11] Vision he said maybe Mercy's
[40:13] over yeah he said I'm he said this whole
[40:17] sermon was presuming he said I normally
[40:20] don't do that and so see church I can
[40:23] understand why some people might think
[40:24] Mercy's over but you got to keep reading
[40:26] you got to to keep listening
[40:29] Hallelujah you got to take all those
[40:31] thoughts back to the
[40:33] Bible praise
[40:36] God don't never think that just keep
[40:39] right on doing everything you can until
[40:41] you're taken away amen we notice in the
[40:45] prayer lines you find Mercy sure mercies
[40:47] the doors are
[40:48] open I think where you got this this
[40:50] thought might lay between I don't have
[40:52] time to to give to each one of these
[40:55] scriptures in the right place but each
[40:56] one of their things they in the prayer
[40:58] line you find Mercy certainly if I know
[41:00] Jesus was coming this afternoon I'd be
[41:02] doing just the thing I'm doing right now
[41:05] just continuing right
[41:07] on if we knew Jesus was coming tonight
[41:09] your job would be to be right
[41:11] here stay in line with the fivefold
[41:14] ministry right because that's Christ's
[41:15] body that's Christ's gifts he sent gifts
[41:19] unto men
[41:21] Hallelujah he said sure the mercies of
[41:24] doors are
[41:26] open he said Mercy is always open see
[41:29] now where I think you get it is about
[41:31] the finishing of the seven Church ages
[41:33] and the Seven Seals being loosed the
[41:36] Seven Seals it manifested what takes
[41:38] place or what has took place the seven
[41:41] Church age were at the end of the seven
[41:42] Church age when I say the end that
[41:45] doesn't mean it's the very hour this
[41:47] very minute you remember the Bible said
[41:49] back in the times of the Lord Jesus Paul
[41:51] said for the time is at hand how many
[41:53] know that Paul said we're living in the
[41:56] last days and that was to 2,000 years
[41:57] ago imagine getting that letter right
[42:01] you got Paul's letter it's the last days
[42:04] what does that tell us God wants us on
[42:06] high alert God wants us to be ready for
[42:09] his coming Hallelujah in other words God
[42:11] doesn't want us to be
[42:13] slothful God doesn't want us to be just
[42:15] you know relaxing God wants us to keep
[42:17] our first love Hallelujah imagine
[42:20] getting a letter from Paul and you live
[42:22] your whole life it's the end time end
[42:23] time and you don't see the end
[42:25] time that ought not to discourage you
[42:27] praise God but it's to let you know
[42:30] these are the end times of the church
[42:35] ages and even the last days I know you
[42:39] know this but just bear with me the last
[42:41] days right what is a day a thousand
[42:45] years right and so if Paul wrote the
[42:47] last days we've had two days see if you
[42:50] look at the spiritual as aspect of it
[42:52] these are the last days the last 2,000
[42:55] years before the
[42:58] Millennium that one holy sacred day the
[43:01] seventh day hallelujah amen and then the
[43:03] future home is the Eighth Day
[43:06] Hallelujah the Eternal
[43:08] day L said do you realize how long that
[43:11] was in God's time that was yesterday
[43:13] brother say yesterday was Paul's day
[43:15] according see we talking about the
[43:17] thousands of years my time it's been
[43:19] 2,000 years see the time's at hand what
[43:21] God calls at hand is not what we call at
[43:25] hand see so just Just Keep On Believing
[43:29] just keep on praying brother baham says
[43:31] God still got Mercy open just keep
[43:34] flowing into it as fast as you
[43:39] can God will do the stopping when it's
[43:41] time to stop that's the end of the
[43:44] answer the church
[43:47] said
[43:49] Glory now John looked all around and he
[43:51] looked over all the Earth he looked
[43:53] beneath the Earth and there was nobody
[43:54] there creation and everybody was lost Lo
[43:57] of course John wept everything was lost
[44:00] his crying didn't last but just a minute
[44:04] because there stood one of the elders
[44:05] said don't weep John oh my his crying
[44:08] didn't last but just a
[44:11] minute Hallelujah John thought oh my
[44:15] where is this man I want a man to do it
[44:18] he he wasn't found so John broke out
[44:20] brother said everything was lost and he
[44:22] wept bitterly and he was sad because
[44:24] everything the whole creation everything
[44:26] was gone if they couldn't find somebody
[44:28] glory to God if they couldn't find
[44:30] somebody that can meet that requirements
[44:33] there every human being the whole world
[44:34] of creation was gone everything had
[44:36] fallen the rights of redemption the
[44:38] rights of eternal life the light all
[44:41] these things had been forfeited and
[44:42] there was nobody who could pay the price
[44:46] but the voice said don't weep John he
[44:48] says for the L of the tribe of Judah the
[44:51] root and offspring of David has
[44:53] prevailed brother said Prevail means to
[44:55] wrestle with and and overcome hallelujah

[45:15] remind me Hallelujah he said Prevail
[45:18] means a wrestle with an overcome oh my
[45:20] the guarden of
[45:23] Gethsemane so now we get now we get a
[45:25] picture where did you overcome
[45:27] in
[45:29] prayer in private prayer when his three
[45:32] closest friends fell asleep and wouldn't
[45:34] pray with him that's the power of
[45:36] individual prayer
[45:39] Hallelujah the Bible said the spirit's
[45:41] willing but the flesh is weak
[45:44] Hallelujah and then he says you couldn't
[45:46] even pray one
[45:47] hour he said but go and sleep now
[45:49] because this is you need some rest for
[45:51] what's going to happen right but here we
[45:54] see where did he overcome he over came
[45:57] by saying not my will but thy will be
[46:01] done think of it the greatest Victory

[46:13] up the staff and all these trillions of
[46:15] gallons all held back by the Holy Spirit
[46:18] hallelujah amen but none of those
[46:20] victories could compare to Jesus simply
[46:23] in prayer Hallelujah he just prayed say
[46:26] said I'm not going to do my will I'm
[46:29] going to do thy
[46:30] will Hallelujah and as he rose he was
[46:34] already
[46:36] Victorious because he conquered his will
[46:39] God help us to conquer our will
[46:42] Hallelujah and then we'll get some
[46:44] victory in our lives
[46:45] amen if we can just conquer our will I
[46:49] don't want to suffer or I don't want

[47:49] God he was overcoming
[47:52] see the lion the root of David has
[47:55] prevailed and overcome
[47:57] and brother B Compares a small example
[48:00] it's like Jacob he was a supplanter a
[48:02] deceiver but when he got in contact with
[48:05] the angel he held on and the angel tried
[48:08] to pull away he said I'm just not going
[48:10] to let you go he held on until he got

[50:42] Hallelujah it enters into the veil I'm
[50:46] sorry be within the veil so there is the
[50:49] Throne of God and brother man said it
[50:50] must be behind the throne he said
[50:52] there's an intercessory
[50:54] box I'm waiting for somebody draw a
[50:57] picture of this brother where you got
[50:59] the throne you got the rainbow around it
[51:00] you got the four beasts the seven
[51:02] spirits of God you got the 24 Elders
[51:04] what a picture I don't think paper has
[51:07] enough room for
[51:08] that but then behind that Throne is an
[51:12] intercessor intercessory Booth the Bible
[51:14] says so there's a
[51:15] veil there's a veil in
[51:18] heaven verse 20 wither the Forerunner is
[51:21] entered for us even Jesus made a high
[51:23] priest after the order of mzc church
[51:26] you've got a high priest in heaven and
[51:28] the Bible said he's enter there for
[51:32] us he's there for me Hallelujah I've got
[51:36] somebody in heaven that cares for me
[51:39] Hallelujah I've got somebody who can
[51:41] stand in for me when I need help when
[51:44] I'm sick when I'm tired when I feel
[51:47] threatened when I feel afraid I've got
[51:49] somebody that's entered in to the
[51:51] intercessor place the holiest of holies
[51:54] I've got somebody that's not Aaron it's
[51:57] not Moses it's not elaser it's Jesus
[52:00] Christ
[52:01] hallelujah oh my the most Sublime thing
[52:04] in scripture
[52:06] amen oh
[52:08] my Hebrews 9:3 and after the second Veil
[52:13] The Tabernacle is called the holiest of
[52:14] all the Holy Ghost verse 8 yeah Hebrews
[52:17] 98 the Holy Ghost this signifying that
[52:20] the way into the holiest of all was not
[52:22] yet made manifest while the first
[52:23] Tabernacle was yet standing verse 19
[52:26] Hebrews 10 I'm sorry Hebrews 10:19
[52:28] having therefore Brethren boldness to
[52:30] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[52:33] Jesus Christ now look at
[52:35] this not only does Jesus go in there you
[52:39] and I get to go in
[52:41] there through
[52:43] prayer
[52:46] Hallelujah is that is that what the
[52:47] Bible says pull up verse 20 having
[52:51] boldness to enter in by a New and Living
[52:53] Way which ha Heath consecrated for us
[52:55] through the veil that say is that us to
[52:57] say his flesh go to verse
[52:59] 21 and having a high priest over the
[53:01] house of God verse 22 there it is let us
[53:04] draw
[53:06] near with a True Heart in full Assurance
[53:09] of Faith or trust or Assurance or
[53:11] Revelation having a heart sprinkled from
[53:13] an evil conscience and our B and our
[53:16] bodies wash with pure water so see
[53:20] before we can go for prayer we got to
[53:22] confess our sins because we have to have
[53:24] a pure conscience
[53:27] in other words we got to remember Jesus
[53:28] forgives me when I confess it Hallelujah
[53:32] and that allows me by prayer to enter
[53:35] into the holiest of holies in
[53:41] heaven I tell you I say like this Jesus
[53:44] loves us greatly with his great love
[53:48] wherewith he loved us Ephesians chapter

[59:03] that's a kind of one I'm GNA rescue
[59:07] hallelujah oh my and brother man said we

[59:12] conscience the Bible
[59:13] says we just lay aside our
[59:16] mistakes we can lay aside all of our
[59:18] evil thoughts and plans and if we can
[59:20] lay aside our past if we just lay this
[59:22] aside brother said don't you know Jesus

[59:27] himself known to
[59:29] you oh my he'll do it today Church
[59:32] Hallelujah he'll make himself known to
[59:35] us
[59:38] hallelujah the lamb advancing from glory
[59:41] for
[59:43] intercessions for his
[59:47] people oh my brother kind of makes a
[59:50] little uh crack not like a joke but
[59:54] maybe like a a wise crack on on the
[59:56] Catholics he said John never saw 1,000
[59:59] saints come forth to
[1:00:01] mediate because Catholics pray to patron
[1:00:04] saints and stuff like that to make
[1:00:07] intercession brother man cracks a little
[1:00:08] joke he says John never saw a thousand
[1:00:12] come forth he said he saw a lamb
[1:00:14] Hallelujah a lamb he's the only man that
[1:00:17] was
[1:00:22] worthy Hallelujah
[1:00:26] now I'm just going to hit a few
[1:00:27] highlights brother said notice the lamb
[1:00:29] had seven horns brother Ram said look
[1:00:31] those horns represent the seven Church
[1:00:34] ages he said that's the Lamb's
[1:00:37] protection so see church that proves we
[1:00:39] have to defend the gospel I've had
[1:00:42] people tell me online you don't got to
[1:00:43] defend the message the message defends
[1:00:45] itself well that's in one way but Paul
[1:00:47] said I stand in defense of the gospel
[1:00:50] and then of course if they if they
[1:00:51] follow brother R they go against that
[1:00:53] quote the Lamb's protection is the seven
[1:00:56] Church ages the Believers in all seven
[1:00:58] Church ages amen do you believe that
[1:01:02] you're a horn of God the power of God is
[1:01:05] moving in your life I didn't hear too
[1:01:06] many amens on that the power of God is
[1:01:09] in your life Hallelujah you are the
[1:01:12] Lamb's protection you keep the word
[1:01:15] going you're the one driving back the
[1:01:17] enemy with your horns right you're the
[1:01:19] one driving the enemy out of your life
[1:01:21] amen see it's Christ in you is what I'm
[1:01:24] saying Christ Christ is using you the
[1:01:27] church the body Believers as the power
[1:01:30] to defend the truth of God's word
[1:01:34] hallelujah and then he goes through
[1:01:35] seven eyes he and he goes to Zechariah 3
[1:01:38] and Zechariah 4 to show those seven eyes
[1:01:40] of the seven spirits of God brother Ram
[1:01:42] said notice seven eyes seers he says
[1:01:44] those were seven prophets now don't let
[1:01:47] there some of you but the next night
[1:01:48] brother R said the only Prophet was Paul
[1:01:50] and brother brandom amongst the seven
[1:01:52] Church age Messengers don't let that
[1:01:53] stumble you it doesn't stumble me right
[1:01:56] doesn't St with me because it doesn't
[1:01:57] really matter the Bible calls them eyes
[1:02:00] so they got to see something they see
[1:02:01] the Revelation for their
[1:02:03] hour hallelujah it's another proof not
[1:02:06] every word is thus say I mean I got over
[1:02:08] 90 Now by God's grace but just don't let
[1:02:11] it some

[1:02:16] are the seven horns the seven Church
[1:02:22] ages he says now brother bam says now
[1:02:24] Jesus has the book and now he's given
[1:02:26] the book down to earth and they have a
[1:02:28] right to everything that was lost in the
[1:02:31] fall because Jesus Paid the price I've
[1:02:34] died for them and brother man said who
[1:02:36] is waiting there for me tonight it's the
[1:02:39] kinsman redeemer
[1:02:42] Hallelujah this is why we have the
[1:02:44] rights of the gifts of the holy spirit
[1:02:46] we have the rights of the supernatural
[1:02:48] move of the Holy Spirit glory

[1:03:12] Bible we have to make sure we're feeding
[1:03:14] on the word of God
[1:03:16] hallelujah and then we'll be able to eat
[1:03:18] the book Hallelujah and then prophesy
[1:03:20] again
[1:03:21] hallelujah amen brother man said brother
[1:03:24] this is the most Sublime thing in the
[1:03:26] Bible he says he said I feel like a
[1:03:28] young man again
[1:03:29] Hallelujah when I see what God has done
[1:03:32] for me he said I feel like I could speak
[1:03:33] in tongues he said because I don't have
[1:03:35] enough languages to praise him with
[1:03:36] Hallelujah preaching this sermon amen
[1:03:39] the
[1:03:40] breach now one point I just want to lay
[1:03:43] this into
[1:03:45] here brother R says when he leads the
[1:03:47] Throne of
[1:03:49] intercession he's bringing the world to
[1:03:52] judgment and then he says when the
[1:03:54] blood's off The Mercy Seat it becomes a
[1:03:55] judgment seat and then he goes to Daniel
[1:03:58] 7 where the Judgment was set the books
[1:04:00] were open he goes to the white Throne
[1:04:01] judgment and then he reads this uh poem
[1:04:04] it's called The Cowboy meditation how
[1:04:05] many remember that I'm GNA read not many
[1:04:08] people okay well then you got listen to
[1:04:09] this message if you don't remember
[1:04:11] it here's the here's the poem last night
[1:04:15] as I lay on the Prairie I gazed to the
[1:04:16] stars in the sky and I wondered if ever
[1:04:19] a cowboy could drift to that sweet by
[1:04:21] and by talking about Cowboy could I ever
[1:04:22] go to heaven
[1:04:25] there's a road to that bright happy
[1:04:27] region but it's dim there a trail so
[1:04:30] they say but the broad one that leads to
[1:04:33] bition is posted and blazed all the way
[1:04:36] they speak of another great owner
[1:04:38] brother said he's speaking in terms of
[1:04:40] cattle life if you ever was in a Roundup
[1:04:42] of cattle you can see it plain they
[1:04:43] speak of another great owner and he'll
[1:04:45] never be Overstock so they
[1:04:48] say he'll always make room for a sinner
[1:04:51] that'll drift on that straight narrow
[1:04:52] Ray in other words God's got to fill up
[1:04:55] the table all the seats at the banquet
[1:04:57] got to be filled up and God's Got A
[1:04:59] Chair for
[1:05:00] you don't think there's not room for you
[1:05:02] oh there's room for you Hallelujah he's
[1:05:04] going to make room for you Hallelujah
[1:05:06] you're a part of him they say he will
[1:05:09] never forsake you and he knows every
[1:05:12] action and look for safety we better get
[1:05:16] branded talking about the Seal of the
[1:05:17] Holy Ghost have our name on his great
[1:05:20] tally
[1:05:21] book for they say there will be a great
[1:05:24] Roundup when Cowboys
[1:05:26] men like dogies will stand to be might
[1:05:29] I'm sorry to be marked by the writers of
[1:05:31] judgment he says them prophets and seers
[1:05:34] that's posted and knows every
[1:05:36] brand
[1:05:39] Hallelujah and that last verse is I
[1:05:42] guess I will be a stray yearling just a
[1:05:45] man that's condemned to
[1:05:47] die that'll be cut in the bunch with the
[1:05:49] rusties when the boss of the Riders
[1:05:52] comes by so this poem is a man who's
[1:05:54] lost his hope oh
[1:05:56] he needs a prayer meeting is what he
[1:05:57] needs amen because if he gets a prayer
[1:05:59] meeting he can go reach up into the
[1:06:01] heavens Hallelujah and his hope can be
[1:06:03] anchored in heaven
[1:06:05] hallelujah
[1:06:06] amen so this sermon is famous for that
[1:06:09] brother man reads that cowboy
[1:06:14] meditation he says see who it is who's
[1:06:17] the boss of the riters that's the lamb
[1:06:20] to the seven Messengers who's posted and
[1:06:22] knows every brand Hallelujah The
[1:06:26] Messengers of God know the brand of the
[1:06:27] Holy Ghost they know the Seal of the
[1:06:29] Holy Ghost when they see it
[1:06:32] right
[1:06:35] Glory he's brother man said he's King
[1:06:37] now Mercy still on the throne don't you
[1:06:39] reject his offer the riters know just
[1:06:41] who you
[1:06:43] are he said I can I can and he said the
[1:06:47] boss say I can do with them what I want
[1:06:49] I still have them he's back there making
[1:06:51] intercessions for them now but someday
[1:06:53] he said I'll put them in the grave I'm
[1:06:55] sorry no he's talking about Satan Satan
[1:06:56] says oh but someday I'll put them in the
[1:06:58] grave but Jesus told the church I'll
[1:07:00] bring you
[1:07:01] out so you see there's nothing to fear
[1:07:03] Satan will tell you oh you're going to
[1:07:04] die you're going to go to the Grave that
[1:07:06] that's that's fine he can say whatever
[1:07:08] he wants Jesus said I'll bring you out
[1:07:09] of the Grave I'll resurrect you
[1:07:12] Hallelujah he says but first I've got to
[1:07:14] be an
[1:07:18] intercessor all right
[1:07:20] now brother Bram said when when time's
[1:07:23] no more he says tonight this lays in the
[1:07:25] future Jesus is still me mediator
[1:07:28] tonight Hallelujah and so brother is
[1:07:31] telling us we've got a mediator
[1:07:34] tonight now I want to go back to the
[1:07:36] verse I read
[1:07:38] here verse n Revelation 59 and they sung
[1:07:42] a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to
[1:07:43] take the book and to open the seals
[1:07:45] thereof for thou was slain and H has
[1:07:46] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[1:07:48] every Kindred and tongue and people and
[1:07:51] Nation now look when the lamb advances
[1:07:54] forward and gives you a revelation and
[1:07:57] gave them a revelation that they were
[1:07:59] redeemed look what it caused a brand new
[1:08:01] PSAL that's why the Bible says Sing a
[1:08:04] new song Amen but in order to sing a new
[1:08:06] song you got to have a fresh Revelation
[1:08:08] Hallelujah you got to have a revelation
[1:08:10] of God's word of God's Will and It
[1:08:13] produced a new song
[1:08:15] Hallelujah and notice what they sang
[1:08:18] about verse 10 and has made us unto our
[1:08:21] God Kings and Priests and we shall reign
[1:08:25] on the earth and brother man said why
[1:08:29] were they shouting why were they
[1:08:30] rejoicing why were they singing a new
[1:08:32] song he said they wanted to come back to
[1:08:36] the Earth they're all waiting there in
[1:08:39] heaven brother man said all the
[1:08:40] celebrity why are they so happy why are
[1:08:43] they singing Because God's redeemed us
[1:08:45] he said they want to come back and here
[1:08:48] they are they're going to be Kings and
[1:08:52] Priests most of these men were rejected
[1:08:55] during their lives Elijah was hunted
[1:08:58] down right or threatened hunting
[1:09:00] down Moses was against uh uh the
[1:09:03] greatest army of his day Egypt Pharaoh a
[1:09:07] lot of Daniel stood we just saw it at
[1:09:08] the theater Daniel was against the whole
[1:09:11] empire of Babylon most of these men were
[1:09:14] rejected and suffered and and battled
[1:09:16] through temptation all these things in
[1:09:18] other words their life on Earth wasn't
[1:09:19] so pretty now see Church we're so
[1:09:22] blessed in this loran church age we got
[1:09:24] to be careful the riches and goodness
[1:09:26] doesn't blind
[1:09:27] us we got to stay seeking God we got to
[1:09:31] say God stir me up amen like the Bible
[1:09:33] said as an eagle stir her nest God stir
[1:09:36] us up Hallelujah so we don't get
[1:09:37] comfortable in this life
[1:09:40] Hallelujah see their lives on Earth were
[1:09:42] not so great remember the Bible said
[1:09:44] they wandered about in tents sheep skins
[1:09:46] and goat skins David in caves
[1:09:50] right 13 years are running from
[1:09:53] Saul life wasn't so great all the
[1:09:56] time and but when they see Jesus come
[1:09:58] forth and take this book now they're
[1:10:01] ready now they want to come back and now
[1:10:03] they want to see the kingdom of God
[1:10:05] lived and expressed upon the Earth
[1:10:08] Hallelujah in other words they're saying
[1:10:10] I can't wait to go back down to earth I
[1:10:12] can't wait to have another shot at this
[1:10:14] life amen they're G to get another
[1:10:16] chance Hallelujah another time to live
[1:10:18] on this Earth
[1:10:20] Hallelujah he said we're going back to
[1:10:23] be Kings and Priests glory to God he he
[1:10:25] said I feel good enough to speak in
[1:10:26] tongues he says because it seems like I
[1:10:29] don't have enough language I could
[1:10:30] praise him with I need one that I don't
[1:10:32] even
[1:10:33] know oh my just now think about that
[1:10:37] they're in heaven and they're longing
[1:10:39] for Earth We're on Earth longing for
[1:10:42] heaven
[1:10:43] Hallelujah GL so what does it show we
[1:10:46] won't be content until we have perfect
[1:10:48] bodies and the Bible said they without
[1:10:51] us cannot be perfected Hallelujah will
[1:10:54] never feel perfect until the Old
[1:10:56] Testament Saints the New Testament
[1:10:58] Saints are ruling on this Earth in the
[1:11:00] righteousness of Christ Hallelujah all
[1:11:03] because we've been redeemed by the blood
[1:11:05] of the Lamb oh my hallelujah praise God
[1:11:10] I feel like I'm finally ready to preach
[1:11:13] Hallelujah

[1:11:29] thousands that's a lot of
[1:11:31] angels sang with a loud voice they're
[1:11:33] all saying

[1:11:38] receive power riches wisdom strength
[1:11:43] honor and glory and blessing all because
[1:11:47] of the Cross brother William all this
[1:11:50] was possible because of the cross of
[1:11:53] Jesus Christ

[1:11:59] back we wouldn't have the rights we
[1:12:01] wouldn't have a promise to come back to
[1:12:03] earth unless the lamb prevailed because
[1:12:06] he could take the book break the seals

[1:16:05] sermon and sent it down to the Earth to
[1:16:08] his seventh angel to reveal it to his
[1:16:10] people and you can't even hear Brother
[1:16:12] Ram say these words because the people
[1:16:13] are so
[1:16:15] happy
[1:16:17] Hallelujah now I've said this for years
[1:16:19] you probably don't remember it but I
[1:16:21] told you this I said I believe
[1:16:22] Revelation five was fulfilled around
[1:16:25] March of
[1:16:27] 1963 most people don't believe that
[1:16:30] that's what I believe because Jesus had
[1:16:33] to come forth take the book open it and
[1:16:36] bring it down to earth so brother Ram
[1:16:38] could reveal it you'd be surprised a lot
[1:16:41] of people don't believe that but that's
[1:16:42] what I
[1:16:43] believe right can believe whatever you
[1:16:45] want right but how many believe the book
[1:16:48] is open if the book is open how many
[1:16:50] believe Revelation 10:7 is history as
[1:16:52] brother R said and what is the
[1:16:53] attraction on the mount 196
[1:16:57] if that's history well then the book
[1:16:59] already had to open Hallelujah and we
[1:17:03] have the open book Hallelujah we see the
[1:17:05] whole Plan of Redemption and we're we're
[1:17:09] privileged to experience the Heavenly
[1:17:11] rights of the open book we're
[1:17:13] experiencing eternal life we're
[1:17:16] experiencing the Dominion of the Holy
[1:17:18] Spirit I love what David said I'm going
[1:17:20] to bring that up again David said I know
[1:17:23] God favors me because he doesn't let my
[1:17:25] enemies triumph over me oh Hallelujah I
[1:17:29] know God's favored me I know I've got
[1:17:31] the rights of the book because my
[1:17:33] enemies don't triumph over me
[1:17:35] hallelujah it's going to tie into this
[1:17:37] evening when I talk about people that
[1:17:39] fall in the message the reason they fall
[1:17:41] is because they don't have God's favor
[1:17:42] because they rejected God's
[1:17:44] favor right in other words rejecting the
[1:17:46] word means you're you reject God's favor
[1:17:50] if you don't stay humble behind the word
[1:17:52] of God you lose God's favor
[1:17:55] and he won't stand for you Hallelujah
[1:17:57] but if you stand for him he'll stand for
[1:17:59] you
[1:18:02] Hallelujah he says there you are he
[1:18:05] broke it he brought it down to his
[1:18:06] seventh angel there you are what
[1:18:08] happened the screams the shouts the
[1:18:09] Hallelujah the anointing the power and
[1:18:12] the
[1:18:14] glory and he said oh John had been
[1:18:16] standing there crying why he said
[1:18:18] everything in Heaven and Earth and
[1:18:20] everything in the sea heard me H amen
[1:18:21] blessing honor that lives forever talk
[1:18:24] about it happen time when those seals
[1:18:27] broke oh my why he says when the
[1:18:30] Revelation come that the lamb the
[1:18:32] Redeemer our Kinsman had come back from
[1:18:35] the Throne of mediatorial and he' worked

[1:19:35] been the time this don't really pertain
