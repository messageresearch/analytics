[5:22] certainly good to see brother cam and
[5:24] family here
[5:25] i tell you the lord has just really
[5:26] blessed me on this trip everyone that i
[5:28] was hoping to be able to drop in and see
[5:30] at some point they all just wound up in
[5:33] my path so
[5:34] that my heart is certainly full this
[5:36] morning
[5:37] just really grateful to that praise the
[5:39] lord
[5:40] uh you know i
[5:42] just uh it's amazing how time flies by
[5:45] it feels like i just got into town
[5:46] yesterday and here we are already near
[5:48] the end of everything but
[5:50] you know we're redeeming the time amen
[5:52] for the days are evil so
[5:54] you know praise the lord that we're not
[5:55] creatures of time even though we maybe
[5:57] seem like it right now but we're
[5:58] creatures of eternity
[6:01] and well i'm looking forward to spending
[6:03] all that eternity with you all and most
[6:05] importantly with our lord jesus amen all
[6:07] sat down around i believe maybe in a big
[6:10] circle at some point and just hearing
[6:12] the lord speak to us and us worshiping
[6:14] and praising him around there
[6:16] oh i can't you can't even imagine it
[6:17] when you don't get tired when you don't
[6:19] have you know you don't have any
[6:21] sickness or sorrow to worry about
[6:22] anymore and you can just
[6:24] revel in the joy of the lord
[6:26] and for a moment by the grace of the
[6:28] lord maybe we can just enter into that
[6:30] little slice of eternity now as we enter
[6:32] into the word and uh
[6:34] you know it's been a great privilege to
[6:36] be here brother jesse i certainly
[6:37] appreciate it and uh you know given the
[6:40] testimony last night as soon as you know
[6:41] as soon as i left my wife had to remind
[6:43] me of a couple things i left out you
[6:44] know she's like well it was a sunday not
[6:47] a saturday or a wednesday when you
[6:48] proposed and these things like that but
[6:50] you know the lord has grace
[6:52] we don't we don't uh my memory is not
[6:54] perfect for sure and uh but by the grace
[6:57] of the lord you know we're just grateful
[6:58] to him let's turn in our bibles if we
[7:00] can a couple of verses here i certainly
[7:03] appreciate it brother jesse even when
[7:05] you open the service this morning
[7:07] speaking of this verse here romans 12
[7:09] chapter 1 speaking of a living sacrifice
[7:12] i've just felt it on my heart so much
[7:14] and we'll probably even revisit some of
[7:16] the things we even ministered on on
[7:17] friday
[7:18] but it's been such an impression on my
[7:20] heart that the hour that we're living in
[7:23] he's calling for a complete surrender of
[7:25] your will
[7:27] because if we are going back to an eden
[7:29] condition
[7:30] that was the one thing
[7:32] that
[7:32] we find in the garden of eden was
[7:34] lacking
[7:36] in cain's side he could not surrender
[7:38] his own will what's the one thing he
[7:39] couldn't do the lord told him what to do
[7:41] but he could not surrender his own he
[7:43] said lord i'm going to do it my way
[7:45] and if we're living in an age that is a
[7:47] perfect example of that it's this age
[7:50] everywhere you look is i'm going to have
[7:51] it my way i'm going to do this the way i
[7:52] want to do it and it doesn't matter what
[7:54] anybody thinks
[7:55] but the more
[7:56] the lord reveals to me at least
[7:58] the more i see that lamb nature needs to
[8:00] come out in us
[8:03] just giving up our rights to him and
[8:05] completely surrendered to him so we're
[8:07] going to read this and then we're going
[8:08] to turn to john chapter 17 as well so
[8:10] just keep that in mind just a couple
[8:12] verses here
[8:15] romans chapter 12 verse 1 i beseech you
[8:17] therefore brethren by the mercies of god
[8:19] that you present your bodies a living
[8:22] sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which
[8:25] is your reasonable service
[8:27] and be not conformed to this world now i
[8:30] want you to see how he's connecting
[8:31] these two things
[8:33] it's not it's not just that when you
[8:35] present yourself a living sacrifice but
[8:36] when you do that what's going to happen
[8:38] to you you're be you're going to be not
[8:40] conformed and be not conformed to this
[8:42] world but be transformed by the renewing
[8:43] of your mind that you may prove what is
[8:46] that good and acceptable and perfect
[8:49] will of god
[8:50] in this age god is looking to prove his
[8:53] word but he's looking to prove it
[8:55] through you
[8:56] you are the proof of god's word in this
[8:58] hour
[8:59] there is not another age coming amen
[9:02] there there is not another message
[9:03] coming
[9:04] there's not another there's not another
[9:06] end time sign coming you are as the
[9:09] prophet said in one point you are the
[9:10] final voice of the final age
[9:12] and if god's going to prove his word by
[9:14] anybody it's going to be through you but
[9:17] the only way we can do that
[9:19] is to submit ourselves a living
[9:21] sacrifice to him
[9:23] amen he won't kick he won't drag you
[9:25] kicking and screaming
[9:27] and then pull you like a puppet to make
[9:29] you perform his word he's looking for
[9:31] willing vessels he's looking for
[9:33] christ-like character that's why i i've
[9:36] been just so drawn to the garden of
[9:38] gethsemane over and over again because
[9:39] it was there
[9:40] god proved what that character was
[9:43] capable of amen because we understand
[9:45] the spirit of god even left the vessel
[9:47] in the garden and yet the character was
[9:50] so infused into that body because we
[9:53] understand he was the word made flesh
[9:55] there was no sin in him
[9:57] that he was able even then to lay down
[9:59] his own will
[10:01] and in this hour i believe he's going to
[10:03] prove that his word is so powerful his
[10:05] blood is so powerful
[10:07] that even a sinless flesh
[10:10] can be trampled underneath the foot of
[10:11] the the soul of the believer and and
[10:14] brought into subjection to this word
[10:18] you can't do it yourself
[10:20] and you got to be you got to be willing
[10:21] to recognize
[10:22] what part is you
[10:24] and what parts the word but praise the
[10:25] lord we have a message we have an open
[10:27] book before us to give us the simple
[10:29] it's so simple brothers and sisters and
[10:31] that's simplicity i want to just drive
[10:33] that home it's simplicity
[10:36] remember it's it's not the big things
[10:39] that you try to do but it's the little
[10:41] things we leave undone
[10:43] right
[10:43] so let's turn to john chapter 17.
[10:49] the message i'd like to speak on this
[10:51] morning would just be one word
[10:53] sanctification
[10:54] amen
[10:56] but we're gonna lord willing maybe
[10:57] approach it in a way that is a little
[10:59] bit different
[11:00] john chapter 17 we'll start at verse 17.
[11:06] jesus is speaking to his disciples he
[11:07] says sanctify them through thy truth thy
[11:10] word is truth
[11:14] as thou has sent me into the world even
[11:16] so have i sent them
[11:18] into the world
[11:20] and for their sakes i sanctify myself
[11:23] that they also might be sanctified
[11:25] through the truth amen let's just go
[11:27] before the lord in a word of prayer
[11:28] heavenly father
[11:30] lord we know that any mortal could read
[11:33] the words off the page father but it
[11:34] takes your spirit the holy ghost your
[11:36] very presence lord and your nature to
[11:38] reveal it to the to the heart of the
[11:40] believer
[11:41] lord and as we just come before you this
[11:43] morning father we want to submit
[11:45] ourselves completely to you as those
[11:46] living sacrifices lord we want to be
[11:48] completely surrendered to you lord mind
[11:51] body soul spirit everything that we are
[11:53] we want to just lay it upon the altar
[11:54] this morning lord we don't want anything
[11:56] of ourselves left oh god
[11:58] lord as it was we lord minister this
[12:01] morning may it not be my thoughts but
[12:02] may it be your word lord if there be any
[12:04] of my thoughts lord i pray you'd remove
[12:06] them and just cleanse them by the fire
[12:07] of the holy ghost remove them out of the
[12:09] way father and lord let your spirit
[12:11] speak to your people lord may we just
[12:13] commit the service into your hands bless
[12:16] all those that have traveled you know
[12:17] different different distances and
[12:19] different times lord and sacrifice to be
[12:22] here lord and we just pray oh god that
[12:24] he would bless them and abundantly lord
[12:26] above all they could ask her thank
[12:28] father we just love you so much father
[12:30] we commit the service into your hands in
[12:31] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[12:32] pray
[12:33] amen amen you may be seated
[12:39] you know in in our age that we're living
[12:41] in we kind of spoke a little bit on
[12:42] friday you know we we really understand
[12:44] that the age we're in is a selfish age
[12:47] right we understand even though we were
[12:48] smitten out of this age what we call the
[12:50] bride age and everything we've come up
[12:52] higher than that and yet we still if we
[12:54] were to go farther even back into john
[12:56] 17 we understand i pray not that you
[12:58] would take them out of the world
[12:59] see we're still in the world but we're
[13:01] not of the world and being that as it
[13:03] may we must contend with the spirit of
[13:06] the age in which we've come out of
[13:08] and we understand that even goes back to
[13:10] the book of exodus exodus and how the
[13:13] the the mixed multitude that came out of
[13:15] egypt although they were experiencing
[13:17] the exodus and we understand right now
[13:19] we are experiencing in exodus brothers
[13:21] and sisters
[13:22] we said on friday you may not feel it
[13:24] you may not see it but as this word goes
[13:27] forth the master's hammer is just slowly
[13:30] forming you into his image yeah and and
[13:33] the lord gets the glory because it isn't
[13:35] about the way you feel it isn't about
[13:37] the way you think you see yourself but
[13:39] it's about his word that's taking effect
[13:42] in your life when you bring it into a
[13:44] willing heart when you bring it into
[13:47] good ground how many of you are good
[13:48] ground this morning you're gonna bring
[13:50] forth a hundredfold you may not always
[13:53] see it in the moment you know not all
[13:55] and not all the trees bring forth in the
[13:58] same season not all the crops come forth
[14:01] at the same time and so many times the
[14:03] devil in the see the age i have to take
[14:06] the age that we're living in because
[14:07] that is the spirit that is trying to
[14:10] press its way into the believer in this
[14:12] age and if you look around you can see
[14:15] what is the world focused on it spoke
[14:17] i've always i've always joked and called
[14:19] it the unholy trinity and i still do of
[14:21] me myself and i
[14:23] because it's it's it's a focus on the
[14:25] self that's right it's a desire to lift
[14:28] oneself up you know we we uh we think
[14:31] about even you could go even in the
[14:33] social medias and things that they have
[14:35] and i think about how they actually
[14:37] preach to the people and the people
[14:39] don't know it because they're in
[14:40] darkness but the people will be with
[14:42] that excuse you i think about how they
[14:44] have the tick tocks and the facebooks
[14:46] and the instagrams you know what they
[14:48] call those people they literally call
[14:51] them influencers
[14:53] they are trying to provide an influence
[14:56] upon the people that follow them
[15:00] now and that's what they've done they've
[15:03] brought influences into the world and
[15:05] even us as believers though we
[15:07] we try to shelter ourselves from all
[15:09] those things you can't help but be
[15:11] surrounded by that darkness because
[15:13] that's the atmosphere of the world that
[15:14] we live in which is why it's so
[15:16] important that we create our own
[15:18] atmosphere that we take that creative
[15:20] power god's given us speaking the word
[15:23] meditating upon the word of god speaking
[15:25] the positive things of god the prophet
[15:27] said that the christian is always
[15:29] positive never negative why because the
[15:31] word is yea and amen
[15:36] so we think about the age that we're
[15:37] living in that laodicean age what did
[15:39] laodicea mean it meant people's rights
[15:42] and if we're not seeing that
[15:44] either you can see in america is the
[15:46] perfect example of it why she was
[15:48] founded upon people's rights
[15:52] and in this age that we're coming to
[15:54] people's rights well i have a right to
[15:55] do whatever i want to do i have a right
[15:57] to this that i have a right to that but
[15:59] see when we became a christian we
[16:01] removed ourselves from worldly and
[16:05] and the cosmic world order as it were
[16:08] that that world order of politics and
[16:10] worried about all those things we've
[16:12] come up into a heavenly kingdom
[16:15] that's taken us beyond the worldly
[16:17] thoughts we can get so caught up in oh
[16:19] what's this doing over here what's that
[16:21] doing over there what is that to thee
[16:23] follow thou me
[16:26] and when we're talking about
[16:28] sanctification see jesus remember he was
[16:31] our example and i i i think we even
[16:34] mentioned this on friday but if you find
[16:35] yourself measuring yourself by other
[16:38] people then you're looking at the wrong
[16:40] measuring stick
[16:42] and i i hate to say it this way but if
[16:43] you're even looking at brother branham
[16:45] as your measuring stick you're looking
[16:47] at the wrong measuring stick he was an
[16:51] example for sure he was a wave sheet
[16:53] that the lord allowed to show us what
[16:56] could happen if you could fully
[16:58] surrender yourself
[16:59] and yet even then he only pointed to
[17:02] christ
[17:03] never pointed to himself
[17:05] that's why i love that song we sang
[17:07] because jesus he is greatest he is
[17:10] highest i will come to thee oh lord i
[17:12] haven't come to just sit at the feet of
[17:15] a prophet but when that prophet said
[17:17] behold the lamb of god that taketh away
[17:20] the sin of the world i gladly left that
[17:24] and i went with that word
[17:27] we don't have to revel in a day gone bye
[17:31] and we don't have to just look forward
[17:33] to a rapture that's become a body change
[17:36] but god is working right now
[17:42] but he's waiting for willing vessels he
[17:46] is waiting for somebody
[17:48] who could truly get sanctified that's
[17:51] right i'm not just talking about cleanse
[17:53] from the things of the world because we
[17:54] know what that is but remember
[17:56] sanctification is a compound word and
[17:59] too many times we leave off the second
[18:02] part
[18:04] remember what does it mean cleaned and
[18:06] what
[18:07] set aside for service
[18:10] and see what do we do we leave that part
[18:12] off because i think subconsciously we
[18:15] just expect god to just do that part for
[18:17] us
[18:19] but see jesus said in john 17 he said i
[18:23] sanctify myself
[18:26] for their sakes
[18:29] it's not he our example
[18:31] and then paul has to come along and say
[18:34] i beseech you what is missing she said i
[18:36] beg you
[18:38] he's begging the brethren
[18:40] give yourselves a living sacrifice
[18:44] if i could say it that way i'd say
[18:47] sanctify yourselves for the brethren
[18:50] for that is your reasonable service
[18:53] we don't realize
[18:54] how much
[18:55] we are affecting each other whenever we
[18:58] do the things that we do
[18:59] you are a part of the body thank you
[19:01] brian you are a part of this body
[19:04] whether one part rejoices the body
[19:05] rejoices with it whether one part hurts
[19:08] the rest of the body hurts with it yeah
[19:09] amen
[19:11] every little thing that you do
[19:13] affects all those around you
[19:15] and so if we could get out of that
[19:16] mindset
[19:18] of that laodicean well i have a right to
[19:20] it and we do have rights to it brother
[19:22] branham said we're living below our
[19:23] god-given rights and that is true but
[19:25] it's not just about your rights it's
[19:27] about the rights of your brothers and
[19:29] sisters who i be struggling
[19:31] it's about those that are out there that
[19:33] you love that you're praying for and
[19:35] fasting for and weeping for see since
[19:38] life that christ is given was not meant
[19:41] to just be closed up to yourself it's
[19:44] not meant to be just closed up to living
[19:46] waters tabernacle to bride of christ
[19:48] fellowship but he said freely you have
[19:50] received freely give
[19:53] what did you receive brothers and
[19:55] sisters what did you receive did you
[19:57] just receive an educational knowledge of
[20:00] an open book
[20:02] did you just receive something that
[20:04] could make you feel a little higher than
[20:05] denomination
[20:07] no but you received life
[20:09] and thought more abundantly
[20:13] you received life
[20:15] glory so freely give that life you ever
[20:18] feed light which is the life
[20:22] so freely give that light
[20:27] it's not enough to know it
[20:29] it's not enough to rejoice in it
[20:31] but it's time brother we are leaving i
[20:33] believe this is just me it's what the
[20:35] lord's put on my heart but we're leaving
[20:37] the little things undone because we're
[20:39] so busy looking only for something
[20:41] that's coming in the future we're
[20:43] looking for these great manifestations
[20:46] and they're they are here i believe even
[20:48] now they're happening in little portions
[20:50] but if we leave the little things undone
[20:52] how can god how can god trust us with
[20:55] the big things
[20:56] how can he trust us with the big things
[20:58] we're looking
[21:00] at all this stuff oh lord i wish you
[21:01] would do this great thing i wish you'd
[21:03] do this great thing and we ought to look
[21:05] for the big things we never cease
[21:07] looking for those things but in the
[21:08] meantime
[21:10] let us continue in the things god has
[21:12] called us to that we can do and say oh i
[21:16] would love to know the will of god well
[21:18] the will of god is his word
[21:20] and what does his word say see the the
[21:22] devil has has fought
[21:25] the people of god so much with works
[21:28] because
[21:29] as soon as you try to do works for god
[21:31] he's right there to say oh you're trying
[21:33] to work your way to heaven you're trying
[21:34] to work your way into some favor with
[21:36] god and i would say amen to the second
[21:38] one i am trying to work my way into more
[21:40] favor with god because i wanted to see
[21:41] that i'm obedient to every word that he
[21:44] showed me amen
[21:46] amen
[21:49] we're to be a living sacrifice
[21:51] every day putting yourself your desires
[21:54] your will upon the altar your will has
[21:57] to die randall verton's got to die every
[22:00] day it is not in my natural flesh to
[22:03] want to leave my wife and my two cute
[22:05] little dogs and come all the way out
[22:06] here and kind of be alone from that's
[22:08] not my natural desire but when the lord
[22:11] calls i will answer why because if he's
[22:14] done that much for me if he could leave
[22:16] his kingdom of heaven come down here and
[22:19] dwell and die for me how much literally
[22:21] or is that for me to just take a few
[22:23] days of sacrifice
[22:27] but we get so selfish
[22:29] we get selfish with it we want to do
[22:31] what we want to do and what do we say
[22:33] that's that's a little that's a child's
[22:36] mentality right when a child's got their
[22:38] little toilet you try to take it away
[22:40] and they slap your hand say that's my
[22:42] toy see but an adult see an adult when
[22:45] you become an adult
[22:46] brother i don't like i said i don't have
[22:47] children yet but they're coming
[22:50] brother amen they're coming
[22:52] you know when they're they're on their
[22:53] way but i i haven't been a child i
[22:55] understand it i can see it but you see
[22:57] that
[22:58] when you when you're younger you do
[22:59] whatever you wanted to do brother cam
[23:01] you remember we used to go wherever we
[23:02] wanted to go we did whatever we wanted
[23:04] to do if we felt like going to this
[23:06] meeting we went there if we felt like
[23:07] fellowship over here we fellowshipped
[23:09] over here but once you start taking
[23:10] responsibility once you start becoming
[23:13] an adult you start to mature a little
[23:15] more you realize god has placed me under
[23:17] a responsibility god has put me in a
[23:20] position and with that position comes
[23:23] certain responsibilities that i must
[23:25] fulfill or i'm not fulfilling the
[23:27] obligations of that office
[23:29] right if i were if i considered myself a
[23:31] husband to my wife and i didn't tell her
[23:34] that i loved her if i didn't express
[23:36] love to her in any way if i didn't
[23:38] provide for her the way a christian man
[23:41] is supposed to provide for if i didn't
[23:42] love her with a christ-like love then i
[23:44] wouldn't be fulfilling that office
[23:46] but i had to sacrifice for that because
[23:49] my body does not always want to tell my
[23:51] wife oh i love you or maybe i'm tired
[23:54] and she wants to go go shopping or
[23:56] something and what love me to go with
[23:57] her and i maybe don't want to but what
[23:59] is it it's the love of christ in your
[24:02] heart that drives you to fulfill the
[24:04] word of god amen
[24:08] i'd say children same with you with your
[24:10] parents you don't always want to obey
[24:12] but see if that holy ghost is there and
[24:15] that word is working on you
[24:17] you say you say say lord help me to be
[24:20] submissive lord help me to follow my
[24:22] parents leading why because
[24:24] that you must be that way because as you
[24:26] grow up it's never going to end little
[24:28] ones that's never going to end because
[24:30] you may think you outgrew your natural
[24:32] father but you'll never all grow your
[24:33] spiritual father you'll never outgrow
[24:35] him he'll always be there to guide you
[24:38] and direct you and correct you and tell
[24:40] you you can go here but don't go there
[24:42] do this but don't do that
[24:44] so you better start practicing it now
[24:47] you better start getting used to that
[24:48] now and being in that mindset of lord
[24:51] help me submit to my heavenly father as
[24:54] well as my natural parents
[24:56] amen
[24:58] praise the lord
[25:00] amen that's why it's uh it's a pretty
[25:01] powerful commandment of commandment with
[25:03] promise children obey your parents that
[25:05] i may be along with you that it may
[25:07] extend your days and be well with you so
[25:09] that's such an important thing it's such
[25:11] an important principle that we can take
[25:12] with us amen but see sanctification
[25:16] we understand the cleansing part we
[25:17] preached that how many times how many
[25:19] times we understand the holy ghost is
[25:21] always there convicting us when things
[25:24] aren't just right the holy ghost is
[25:25] there to tell us that thing you
[25:27] shouldn't be looking at that you
[25:28] shouldn't be thinking about that you
[25:30] shouldn't be doing this or that and
[25:31] that's wonderful we appreciate the lord
[25:33] for that we need it we need that more
[25:35] we need it more than ever we've let a
[25:37] lot of things slip probably because it's
[25:39] so easy however now we got to get to the
[25:42] second part it's time to set ourselves
[25:44] aside for the service of the lord and
[25:46] see that's not just something of you say
[25:48] well lord you cleanse me now just move
[25:50] me over here and just do whatever you
[25:52] want no he wants you to set yourself
[25:55] aside for his service
[25:57] every day he wants you to get down and
[26:00] say lord i'm gonna set my will aside i'm
[26:03] gonna set my desires aside what service
[26:06] would you have me provide for you today
[26:11] i just say this because
[26:13] this isn't to glorify anybody but i
[26:15] think about maybe ministers
[26:17] particularly pastors because there's
[26:19] more of an obligation to be there and to
[26:21] minister on a regular basis how many
[26:24] times brothers have you woken up and in
[26:26] your flesh you had no desire to get up
[26:28] and preach that morning because you were
[26:29] tired your children were keeping up late
[26:32] you didn't sleep really well or the
[26:33] devils fight you because we fight the
[26:35] battles but you know what you do you set
[26:37] that aside and say lord you have called
[26:39] me to a place where i must set aside my
[26:42] will and fulfill the word of god for
[26:45] what i do and what did he say feed my
[26:47] sheep feed my lambs be a good bishop and
[26:50] a good steward with the household of god
[26:52] and so what do you do no have you been
[26:54] perfect absolutely not i'm sure you have
[26:56] it i haven't either how many times have
[26:58] i said i was gonna preach or was gonna
[27:00] do something and then i didn't do it
[27:02] thank you lord for repentance
[27:03] forgiveness and for his blood but as
[27:05] we're going along in this journey he's
[27:08] just getting us a little closer he's
[27:09] just getting to listen a little closer
[27:11] we're drawing closer and closer and
[27:12] closer to him and the two are becoming
[27:14] one even now that uniting time is
[27:16] happening right now it's not a future
[27:19] event it is happening right now
[27:22] but it's going to take apart from you
[27:25] god will not push you through that pipe
[27:28] he can't do it because he did not
[27:31] predestinate you
[27:32] we talked about predestination he did
[27:34] not predestinate you
[27:36] just because he said i'm going to do
[27:38] this new he brother branham said he
[27:39] predestinated you according to
[27:41] foreknowledge because he knew what what
[27:44] you would choose so you have a part to
[27:47] play you must choose this day
[27:51] that's applicable every day of your life
[27:53] when you wake up choosing this day who
[27:56] you will serve
[27:57] are you going to serve your flesh on sin
[28:00] unto death are you going to serve the
[28:01] lord jesus christ and the spirit to life
[28:04] that is an everyday battle
[28:09] we've gotten so predestinated that i
[28:11] feel so many times i see spiritually
[28:14] that people are just laying back in lazy
[28:15] boys just saying well lord i came to the
[28:18] knowledge of this message and that must
[28:20] be good enough it's not good enough
[28:22] because it's got to live
[28:24] it's got to live
[28:26] and god is not playing with corpses here
[28:30] right he's not playing with corpses he's
[28:33] not going to take you like a puppet and
[28:35] just move you like a puppet on the
[28:36] strings
[28:37] i thought that i had in my mind i had
[28:39] that idea for many years
[28:41] i'll just be honest that i was expecting
[28:43] that holy ghost to be something that
[28:45] would come and that would just move me
[28:47] wherever he wanted to move me and he
[28:49] will he'll move in here but it's upon
[28:51] you to take that unction and put it into
[28:54] action by slaying that devil in your
[28:56] mind and moving forward
[29:02] you say brother that sounds like a lot
[29:03] you're trying to save yourself by works
[29:04] no sir no sir i know the work's already
[29:06] done i serve him because i serve him and
[29:09] i fulfill this word because the word in
[29:12] me wants to fulfill the word it has
[29:14] nothing to do with salvation i'm already
[29:16] saved he's already done the work now
[29:19] it's my part to play
[29:23] when john was sitting there and that
[29:25] mighty angel came down and said eat the
[29:27] book he said you must prophesy
[29:29] he didn't say i'm going to come and
[29:30] prophesy and you're just going to be
[29:32] there he said you must prophesy to many
[29:35] kindred nations and tongues there is a
[29:37] word not only that but you he had to re
[29:41] that angel didn't come down and force
[29:42] the book down john's throat
[29:45] he said take it
[29:47] you eat it you take it you eat it you
[29:50] prophesy
[29:55] god is looking for willing vessels
[29:57] that's the difference in this hour
[30:00] there's many people in the time of jesus
[30:02] that were living according to the law
[30:04] but had no real desire to do it they did
[30:07] it under pretense
[30:08] they did it for the they even scripture
[30:10] says he said they devoured widow's
[30:12] houses
[30:13] right that means they were doing shady
[30:15] deals behind the scenes
[30:17] they looked good but as soon as that
[30:19] person would die they'd swoop right in
[30:21] and say well the church is good it
[30:22] doesn't sound like the catholic church
[30:23] to you
[30:25] sounds like a catholic church to me they
[30:27] swoop right in and say oh she was a
[30:29] member of the synagogue
[30:31] this person was a member of the
[30:32] synagogue and and no doubt she willed
[30:35] everything to the church she willed
[30:37] everything to the synagogue devouring
[30:38] widows houses
[30:40] scooping them up
[30:42] making long prayers for pretense why to
[30:45] show the people that outwardly they were
[30:47] one thing when one of brother jesse said
[30:49] they're not inside
[30:50] inside on the inside they had no care
[30:53] for that at all it was all a means to an
[30:56] end
[30:57] and we got a lot of people even in the
[30:59] message that are like that we may not
[31:01] see them all yet but they will manifest
[31:03] themselves because it's got to in this
[31:05] hour but it's got to be so close it
[31:07] would deceive the elect if it were
[31:08] apostles
[31:10] they would deceive why you think those
[31:12] spirits are so close
[31:14] and they gotta come from the same group
[31:16] because they both heard the cry
[31:18] they both heard the cry but one day had
[31:20] the oil one wanted to seek after god one
[31:22] was there because it seemed easy
[31:24] they just happened to be there
[31:26] that's right
[31:28] they just happened to be there yes sir
[31:30] brothers and sisters we've got to give
[31:32] up everything that we thought we were
[31:34] we've got to give up all the thoughts
[31:35] that we thought we had we've got it's
[31:37] going to be so much simpler than what we
[31:39] thought it was going to be we thought
[31:41] like we said on friday we thought it was
[31:43] going to be i'm going to run over a
[31:44] troop i'm going to i'm gonna run through
[31:45] a troop leap over a wall then i'm gonna
[31:47] be doing this and just it's almost like
[31:48] a like a magic show like pow missing
[31:50] limbs restored yes it will happen we
[31:53] know it's coming but he said it would be
[31:55] so small it'd go right over the top and
[31:57] you wouldn't even see it
[31:59] jesus was on the scene the very god of
[32:01] heaven
[32:03] was on the scene at only a tiny fraction
[32:06] not of the world
[32:08] but just in jerusalem in judea knew that
[32:11] he was even there
[32:14] be the case in that day and that was the
[32:16] very god of heaven made flesh so much so
[32:20] that that the scripture said that if i
[32:22] could compile all the works he did in
[32:23] the book we wouldn't have the volumes to
[32:25] record it
[32:26] now think about even in our day when the
[32:29] prophet comes on the scene malachi 4
[32:31] comes on the scene round the world seven
[32:33] times a healing ministry like the world
[32:35] hasn't ceased in the time of jesus
[32:36] christ and how many people have even
[32:38] heard of him
[32:40] now multiply that by a tinier percentage
[32:43] and that's how much is going to know
[32:45] about anything when this bride takes off
[32:47] the scene
[32:48] if they don't know about malachi 4 and
[32:50] we think that we're going to go around
[32:53] and just do these things and the whole
[32:54] world's going to know it then you don't
[32:56] know your bible because it pleases god
[32:58] to hide these things
[33:01] amen the hidden things belong to us the
[33:04] children of god
[33:06] that's what belongs to us so what is
[33:08] your motive and objective you got to
[33:10] make sure those are right first of all
[33:12] are you just looking to do something to
[33:14] prove something to someone else are you
[33:16] looking to do something or or is your
[33:18] heart's desire saying lord i just want
[33:20] to fulfill the word of god because
[33:23] that's what jesus's desire was he said
[33:25] lo i come in the volume of the book to
[33:27] do thy will oh god there wasn't anything
[33:29] beyond that i don't want to fulfill
[33:31] someone else's portion i want to find
[33:34] the portion that's allotted for me and
[33:36] lord help me to get into that spot stay
[33:38] in that spot and whatever whatsoever
[33:41] your hand find it to do do it with all
[33:43] your might
[33:45] you say brother that's carnal well why
[33:47] is the scripture saying james that pure
[33:49] religion undefiled is this to visit the
[33:51] widows of the orphans to do these things
[33:53] be not weary and well-doing but see
[33:56] we've forgotten it
[33:58] we've forgotten it
[33:59] it's so simple yes sir
[34:03] hallelujah
[34:05] i just thinking about brother jesse
[34:06] you're talking about talking to the
[34:07] brother in prison
[34:08] what happened to visiting the people in
[34:10] prison
[34:11] did not jesus say he said when when did
[34:13] we come visit you in prison
[34:15] when did we do this and we need to do
[34:16] that see it was so simple
[34:19] but we've left that off because we're
[34:20] just so comfortable in our little zone
[34:23] our little zone of of the message
[34:26] that we're not willing to venture out
[34:28] and see why because we're afraid of
[34:30] persecution
[34:31] maybe we don't want to admit that but so
[34:33] many times that's really what it is
[34:35] because we're afraid well people aren't
[34:36] going to accept it yeah 99.999
[34:40] will not accept it
[34:42] we've already been taught that you
[34:44] better get that idea out of your mind
[34:45] right now but it's remember it's like
[34:47] those seeds brother branham said when
[34:49] he's talking about i think it was in the
[34:51] it is the rising of the sun he said all
[34:53] those seeds when god formed the earth
[34:54] were already in the ground he had
[34:56] already put them in the ground he said
[34:58] but when that first sunrise came up what
[35:00] happened that sun that light struck the
[35:02] seed and they started to come to life
[35:04] that's what we're doing right now
[35:05] brothers there are there are not many
[35:07] but there are seeds still out there and
[35:10] it's up to us to shine that light that
[35:14] big old gospel spotlight you're going to
[35:16] be brother you're sweeping over
[35:18] everybody you can find
[35:20] you may only find one out of a billion
[35:22] but you'll find that one that you're
[35:24] destined to find because if if that
[35:26] light see that the light that you're
[35:28] shining be the true gospel light if it
[35:30] be this message that we've received
[35:32] which is the only true gospel of the
[35:33] hour there's nothing outside of it
[35:36] i don't care how nice we try to be about
[35:37] it there is you cannot make a rapture
[35:40] outside this message it can't happen
[35:42] because is it the light for the hour and
[35:44] if you're shining that true light then
[35:46] the only life that can come forth is the
[35:49] light is the light that can that was
[35:51] represented with the seed
[35:55] because god is only matching it's just
[35:57] one it's there they have to be the same
[35:59] so don't be discouraged
[36:01] when all these ones will take so much
[36:04] and come to only so far and then fall
[36:05] away you know what at least praise the
[36:07] lord maybe they got a portion
[36:09] they may have got a portion and maybe
[36:11] they might have just been just been here
[36:13] to receive judgment
[36:15] sure you don't even know why see but we
[36:17] remember what we said what is our
[36:18] expectation we spoke at that upfront
[36:20] what is our expectation that everyone
[36:22] who comes in is going to receive it we
[36:24] know that's not true so why do we get
[36:26] discouraged when it doesn't happen when
[36:28] the words already told us
[36:30] oh lord no doubt we ought to have more
[36:31] sorrow for the souls that are out there
[36:34] well to have more love and compassion
[36:36] for that but our expectation has to be
[36:38] in line with this
[36:40] otherwise we can't see the world's
[36:42] expectation
[36:44] when he went down to the pool of
[36:45] bethesda was that he would just go
[36:47] you're healed you're healed you're
[36:48] healed i mean i can say it this way that
[36:50] sounds like religious like a modern
[36:51] benny hen
[36:53] oh you don't wave his hand over all the
[36:54] pool but then they all pass out and they
[36:56] all wake up healed or something but that
[36:57] wasn't so
[36:59] he passed by worse cases to meet the one
[37:03] that was predestinated why because he
[37:05] knew that he could receive it and it was
[37:07] his hour to receive it
[37:10] what what did the prophet say he said
[37:12] that was god's compassion
[37:15] that's not see human compass his ways
[37:17] are above our ways his thoughts are
[37:19] above our thoughts they're so past our
[37:21] finding out but we're so
[37:23] concerned with our own little worlds the
[37:25] scripture says be not concerned with
[37:27] your own things but every man look to
[37:29] the things of others right remember that
[37:31] isn't a covenant looking that's a that's
[37:33] a care that's that's a looking out for
[37:36] that's a watchfulness that's a watch me
[37:37] on a tower that says oh my i see this
[37:40] brother looks a little discouraged i'm
[37:41] gonna get down on my knees and pray for
[37:43] him i'm gonna i'm gonna sacrifice a
[37:45] little bit of my time
[37:46] to pray for someone else and not just
[37:48] get down before god with a grocery list
[37:50] of things that i want god to do
[37:54] that's not a relationship
[37:55] yes
[37:57] if you're married
[37:58] and all your wife comes to you for is
[38:00] honey i want this honey i want that
[38:02] honey would you do this honey would you
[38:04] do that okay i just need this i need
[38:06] that i need this and i need that and we
[38:07] want to sit down with her she don't want
[38:09] nothing to do with you that's not a
[38:10] relationship
[38:12] that's nothing but an indentured servant
[38:15] is that what we've made god
[38:19] it's time we come up a little higher
[38:22] hallelujah
[38:23] praise god let's turn to ephesians
[38:27] i'm sorry uh first corinthians forgive
[38:28] me first corinthians
[38:32] we're at the uniting time that's right
[38:34] we are at the uniting time the bride and
[38:36] the groom are becoming one
[38:40] first corinthians
[38:42] chapter 7
[38:44] verse 34.
[38:47] i was really struck by this
[38:50] it says there is a difference also
[38:52] between a wife and a virgin the
[38:53] unmarried woman careth for the things of
[38:55] the lord that she may be holy both in
[38:56] body and spirit but she that is married
[38:58] care for the things of the world how she
[38:59] may please her husband now i want to i
[39:02] want to take this if i could it sounds a
[39:03] little strange but let's take the
[39:04] anti-type of that
[39:07] see he's talking naturally but let's
[39:08] take it spiritually
[39:11] if you're unmarried
[39:12] you're caring for the things
[39:14] you see if you're not married
[39:15] spiritually you're going to be caring
[39:17] for the things of the world
[39:19] how many how you may please yourself
[39:21] but if you're truly married to christ
[39:24] then you only care about the things that
[39:25] will please your husband
[39:27] it's time we became we where where where
[39:29] are we trying to please
[39:31] yes
[39:32] see now he's talking let's take it up a
[39:34] little level higher
[39:35] if you're unmarried
[39:38] i'm not talking natural i'm talking
[39:39] spiritually
[39:41] what are you caring for
[39:43] if your eye if your appetites and your
[39:44] thoughts are always for yourself well
[39:46] then you're married to yourself
[39:48] you're caring for yourself what can i do
[39:49] what can i do this but if you're married
[39:51] to him you say lord what would my
[39:52] husband desire of me
[39:55] what what does he want from me so i can
[39:57] give all that i have to that desire
[40:01] right
[40:02] i want to be married to him
[40:04] i want all that i am to be married to
[40:06] christ so that my only desire is for him
[40:08] that every every ounce of my being is
[40:11] lord how can i please my husband
[40:14] see the remember he's talk that's a he
[40:15] says he says this is a great mystery but
[40:17] i'm speaking concerning christ in the
[40:18] church see there's a marriage happening
[40:20] there's a unification happening and he's
[40:23] showing us even in a type what happens
[40:25] when two get married is that wife cares
[40:27] about the husband cares about the things
[40:29] of the husband
[40:31] so what are you caring for
[40:33] if you're caring for your own things
[40:36] well then we better check to see where
[40:37] we're at in our marriage vows
[40:39] because if all we're caring about is
[40:41] ourselves well then
[40:43] where's the other part
[40:45] where's the care for the husband
[40:46] see he cared enough for you that he came
[40:48] and died for you
[40:50] he came down he sacrificed everything
[40:52] for you he gave up remember he gave up
[40:55] the chance in a natural family for a
[40:56] natural things he gave up the natural
[40:59] things that he had a right to
[41:02] right so that he could
[41:04] for the glory that lay be before him
[41:07] he bore the cross in despising the shame
[41:10] so that's the question where are we at
[41:12] come on what's our what's our desire how
[41:15] are we are we setting ourselves aside
[41:18] really sanctifying our lives
[41:21] setting our will aside setting our
[41:23] desires aside
[41:25] we've got to do that if we want to see
[41:27] if we want to see this from the lord
[41:29] amen
[41:31] ephesians chapter 5.
[41:52] ephesians chapter 5 verse 30 through 32
[41:54] we've heard this for we are members of
[41:56] his body of his flesh and of his bones
[41:58] for this cult shall a man leave his
[41:59] father and mother and shall be joined
[42:00] unto his wife and they too shall be one
[42:02] flesh this is a great mystery but i
[42:04] speak concerning christ and the church
[42:07] so that's the question who are you
[42:08] married to
[42:10] where's your marriage because we
[42:11] understand what happens when you're
[42:12] married your desires your obligations
[42:15] change a little bit right
[42:16] when you when we were single we'd go do
[42:18] whatever we wanted we could we were
[42:20] basically in the natural at least we
[42:22] were living to please ourselves because
[42:24] we didn't have obligations but see once
[42:26] you've been married to christ those
[42:28] obligations change
[42:29] and are we the bride of christ or are we
[42:31] the white are we becoming the wife of
[42:32] christ right now then what happens that
[42:34] wife has her obligations changed now she
[42:37] only concerns herself with the things
[42:38] that can please her husband
[42:40] oh lord help us yes that's it lord help
[42:42] us because we're so selfish
[42:45] we are so selfish
[42:48] maybe it's not you but it's me if it's
[42:49] any if it's not for anybody it's for me
[42:52] i'm not this isn't condemnation but we
[42:54] need to check up he's calling us higher
[42:57] we're coming where it's a uniting time
[42:59] and the only place to be united is in
[43:01] christ and we've seen
[43:03] what that nature produces
[43:05] because we've seen it in the word and we
[43:07] saw it through a prophet that was a wave
[43:09] sheep what did he do a man and this
[43:11] isn't glorifying the man it's the christ
[43:12] in the man that was giving us an example
[43:15] that i i think about how often i will
[43:17] just not do things because i'm a little
[43:18] bit tired and yet this brother that we
[43:22] that we love and we've seen what the the
[43:24] spirit of christ did in him would bang
[43:26] his leg against the car and pluck out
[43:27] hairs from his arm just to drive miles
[43:29] at midnight to go pray for one person
[43:32] that's the spirit of christ being made
[43:34] manifest
[43:35] that's look at paul and all the things
[43:37] that he labored in the things that he
[43:39] sacrificed had nothing had one cloak
[43:43] to his name
[43:44] and yet we're not satisfied unless we
[43:46] got laodicean parks all over the place
[43:48] now
[43:49] we got to have a good car gotta have a
[43:51] good house
[43:53] and i'm always reminded that scripture
[43:54] said therefore having food and rainment
[43:57] be content
[43:58] how many of you got more than that
[44:00] and still sometimes you find yourself
[44:02] not being content like you ought to be i
[44:04] raised my hand saying lord forgive me
[44:06] i've been so many times
[44:08] and what is it because you got caught
[44:10] now in the type
[44:11] what paul spoke about when you're
[44:12] married or things you get caught up in
[44:14] the natural how to please your wife or
[44:15] please your husband in the natural but i
[44:17] want to be that portion in the spiritual
[44:19] lord how can i please you today how can
[44:22] i lay myself down because
[44:24] that's where you will find the
[44:25] contentment that's where you will find
[44:27] the true joy
[44:30] it's better to give than to receive but
[44:32] we're always looking to receive
[44:34] something from god why don't we look to
[44:36] give a little bit of what god given us
[44:37] out
[44:40] the world perverted that into a
[44:42] christmas and all this garbage that they
[44:44] got out there but let's take the reel
[44:46] there's a bunch of scarecrows out there
[44:48] but let's push those aside because there
[44:51] is a true spirit of god that's going to
[44:54] work in his people there are real works
[44:56] that are to be done
[44:58] not for pretense not because you just
[45:00] want to look good to your pastor but
[45:02] because the word said it i don't see
[45:04] someone doing it the lord put it on my
[45:06] heart to do it and i will fulfill that
[45:08] word if there's no one else to fulfill
[45:10] it i will fulfill that word
[45:13] because you've been called to do it
[45:16] what's the only thing that can fulfill
[45:18] word
[45:19] word
[45:21] word is the only thing that could
[45:23] fulfill word
[45:24] it isn't that's why the pharisees said
[45:26] they could do all that they wanted to do
[45:28] they could put all these things and see
[45:30] we've heard the story brother brain i'm
[45:31] told who was there when you were sick
[45:33] the kind of priest who was there when
[45:34] they did this the kind of priest and
[45:36] satan uses that as a scarecrow to put
[45:38] you off from doing all those things
[45:40] because those things are good
[45:43] what's the difference he was doing it as
[45:45] a job
[45:46] he was doing it because it was my
[45:48] obligation to do it he was doing it
[45:50] because that catholic church would
[45:51] receive money from them just like the
[45:53] pharisees he was doing it because he
[45:55] loved the praises of man more than the
[45:57] praises of god that's what he said they
[45:59] love to wear long robes and to say oh
[46:02] bishop in the streets oh mighty bishop
[46:04] and all these different things i went to
[46:06] my grandmother's funeral a couple weeks
[46:08] ago she actually passed away like a year
[46:10] and a half ago during coven and they
[46:12] weren't even had the funeral until
[46:13] recently well they did it in the
[46:14] catholic church and i tell you what i
[46:16] was actually kind of excited to go
[46:17] because i had never seen a catholic
[46:19] service before in person except for when
[46:20] i was like a really tiny little child
[46:22] that brother it's exactly what it is but
[46:24] they walk they're playing all this music
[46:27] they have a little mini choir in the
[46:28] back with like three or four people
[46:30] singing of uh whatever they do and then
[46:32] here comes the bishop just walking down
[46:34] all slow there's i'm not kidding you
[46:36] there was probably only about 40 people
[46:37] in the whole thing and the thing could
[46:38] probably hold like a thousand fifteen
[46:40] hundred people and harry comes just
[46:42] [Music]
[46:43] like just all like pomp and circumstance
[46:46] what is it just i want the glory of man
[46:49] you can see it in their walk you can see
[46:51] the way they they act why because it's
[46:54] just a job
[46:55] it's just something that gets them a
[46:56] title but see it's not so with the
[46:58] people of god see satan has used that as
[47:00] a scarecrow to do away with the things
[47:03] that we still need to do
[47:04] to visit the widows and the orphans and
[47:06] to provide for the needs that you see in
[47:08] the body and to provide for the things
[47:09] that people have need of and to be there
[47:11] to pray with someone when they need it
[47:13] or you know help out someone when they
[47:14] need to move or
[47:16] be with someone or give them some a meal
[47:17] when they're sick or something and we
[47:19] and we look past those things because
[47:21] they look so small but it's the little
[47:23] things that we leave undone every when
[47:25] the lord puts that unction on your heart
[47:28] think about the woman that the lord put
[47:30] on her heart to pray for that little
[47:31] baby in the prayer line had she missed
[47:33] that unction perhaps that baby wouldn't
[47:35] have even been healed
[47:37] because the lord put it on her heart to
[47:39] do it but it's so easy so it's such a
[47:41] little thing the lord puts it on your
[47:42] heart to pray for somebody said well i
[47:43] can't do it because the pastor will do
[47:45] it it's not on the pastor
[47:47] right it's not on the pastor is in
[47:48] office to fulfill a service to the lord
[47:51] and to the people of god but you have a
[47:54] service to provide for god himself
[47:56] you have a part to play each one of you
[48:00] that doesn't mean we just go off and do
[48:01] whatever we want the lord's put a bishop
[48:03] over the church to be an overseer and we
[48:05] just don't sheep just don't run wild
[48:08] but at the same time they take the
[48:10] unction of the lord and they run with it
[48:12] and and i believe a pastor would be so
[48:14] if i could say they're so proud of his
[48:16] of the sheep that god's given him to be
[48:18] overseer of if he heard about a
[48:19] testimony a brother jesse hears a
[48:21] testimony of a sister
[48:23] got somebody on her heart and called
[48:25] someone in the church and prayed over
[48:26] the phone and they got healed that would
[48:28] be a testimony for jesus christ why
[48:31] because it's the holy ghost working in
[48:33] the body but we've turned it back into
[48:35] another bishopric oh it's all going to
[48:38] come through the pulpit it's all going
[48:39] to come through the pulpit no it doesn't
[48:41] it works through the body of christ
[48:45] he's calling each part of the body to
[48:47] play their part why because whether you
[48:49] know it or not the pastor can't even
[48:50] fully play his part until you're playing
[48:52] yours
[48:54] he can't do it because they all got to
[48:56] be in their positions
[48:57] that great orchestra that conductor
[48:59] could be up here conducting all he wants
[49:01] but if the two of us where the flute
[49:03] should be and the flute's over where the
[49:04] bass drum should be the music will
[49:06] always be messed up
[49:12] that's why each one of you has a part to
[49:13] play
[49:14] each one of us has a place to that you
[49:16] that only you can fulfill that's right
[49:18] there's no big eyes or little use
[49:21] remember there's a reason that brother
[49:23] branham would tell these little parables
[49:26] remember he talked about the i think it
[49:27] was the swedish man or something or
[49:28] whatever it was i talked about the the
[49:30] bolts a bunch of nuts he said but
[49:32] without the nuts you got a bunch of junk
[49:34] why because it may seem like the
[49:35] littlest piece it may seem like this
[49:37] little thing but you give it time
[49:40] you hear that little rattle in the car
[49:42] and you can't seem to find it it's maybe
[49:43] one little cotter pin that's out of
[49:45] place you give that time you run a few
[49:47] thousand miles on it pretty soon your
[49:48] axle falls off or something why because
[49:51] that little piece means something each
[49:53] piece has a purpose
[49:55] how many if you ever put together i
[49:57] think about it think about this you put
[49:59] together those little furniture things
[50:00] they have it like ikea and places the
[50:02] little solder furnitures and different
[50:03] things you can buy at stores and they
[50:05] come with instructions that us brothers
[50:06] never look at we just throw them away
[50:07] and start putting it together and you
[50:09] get finished putting it together what
[50:10] happens why do i have like six boats
[50:12] left over
[50:13] why because you didn't follow the
[50:14] directions
[50:16] why and even though you didn't know it
[50:18] the engineer designed it in such a way
[50:21] that those pieces had a purpose
[50:23] and that's what we do with god we we
[50:25] want to do something and we just run out
[50:27] without checking this without checking
[50:29] up here lord what would you have me do
[50:31] we just go out and do what we feel like
[50:32] we ought to do
[50:34] and what happens it all falls apart we
[50:36] wonder why and the engineers satan if
[50:38] you would have just the engineer's
[50:39] saying to you if you would have just
[50:40] taken that boat over here if you would
[50:42] have just taken this little prayer over
[50:44] here if you would have just taken this
[50:45] little offering i told you to give a
[50:47] month to go over here then you wouldn't
[50:48] be struggling where you are you wouldn't
[50:50] be fighting where you are but we leave
[50:52] all the things undone
[50:55] because what we put we put ourselves
[50:57] before him and we don't even know it
[51:00] we don't even know it because we've been
[51:01] puffed up by being called the bride
[51:02] we're the bride we're the bride we're
[51:04] the bride i tell you what esther was the
[51:05] bride too but when she wanted something
[51:07] from the king she went down and she
[51:09] bowed herself before the king not only
[51:10] that she she didn't even ask the first
[51:12] time
[51:14] the first time she went to him she said
[51:15] lord my only ass was it was a banquet of
[51:17] wine
[51:18] it was a banquet of stimulation said
[51:20] lord i just want you to come to our bank
[51:22] with a stimulation
[51:24] and that satan was there remember haman
[51:26] was there
[51:27] so yeah he's gonna show up too that's
[51:29] okay but it's not about him it's about
[51:30] the king
[51:31] and what did she do she said lord i just
[51:33] want you to come to my banquet of wine
[51:34] then i'll prepare for you the simulation
[51:36] we're going to worship you we're going
[51:37] to praise you and then what did you do
[51:38] she got down before him and he said what
[51:40] is your what is your request queen
[51:42] esther and i'll give you anything up to
[51:43] half the king she said oh my king if it
[51:45] pleased me
[51:46] she didn't even give her a request then
[51:47] when she said come tomorrow again to the
[51:50] banquet that i will prepare for oh my
[51:51] goodness that's god's people that's the
[51:54] wife who ain't there looking for just
[51:56] something god can do for her she wants
[51:58] to perform a service for her king
[52:01] she wants to give something to him
[52:03] she said come tomorrow come tomorrow
[52:05] tonight we're going to put another
[52:07] banquet on for you we're going to we're
[52:08] going to put another feast of wine on
[52:10] for another stimulating revelating
[52:12] that's glory to god a rejoicing time for
[52:15] you
[52:18] then he gave her everything she had
[52:19] needed then she could make her petition
[52:21] no
[52:22] see that's that's maturity
[52:24] see because remember esther already knew
[52:27] everything that was happening at the
[52:28] time and i'm sure there's probably even
[52:30] a deeper type there that i don't even
[52:32] see yet
[52:33] but i'm sure it's there
[52:34] i just hadn't studied this just kind of
[52:35] came fresh here so i wasn't necessarily
[52:37] studying on that but you think about it
[52:40] that's all right
[52:42] but
[52:43] what did she do she had a maturity to
[52:44] her yeah she knew what heyman's plans
[52:47] were she knew he was there yes
[52:50] but she could wait to the second time
[52:52] she said oh now i'll make my request
[52:54] known see how often do we do i think
[52:56] about you know brother branham i think
[52:57] there was the brother that had the issue
[52:59] in his i think he had like a growth on
[53:00] him on his ear or something and he
[53:02] wouldn't ask brother branham about it
[53:03] because he felt he didn't want to bother
[53:05] him but what happened the lord honored
[53:08] that brother's faith because he knew
[53:10] that god could do it but he just didn't
[53:12] he just didn't feel like it was his
[53:13] place to interrupt the prophet while he
[53:15] was while he was hunting or whatever it
[53:16] was and the lord came right around and
[53:18] honored that why because he wasn't
[53:20] seeking his own
[53:21] he was having respect in this case just
[53:23] respect to an office he said i don't
[53:25] want to bother brother branham he's
[53:26] doing this hunting trip and i know this
[53:27] is when he relaxes and so how many times
[53:30] if we would just you know if we would
[53:31] pray for one another
[53:32] i said that's been my prayer lately as
[53:34] lord help me not to just always get down
[53:36] and think of myself
[53:38] no it's it's easy you start praying for
[53:40] for others that you love and that other
[53:42] than you know and it seems like within a
[53:43] few minutes you're just on yourself over
[53:45] it's like this revolving loop of here we
[53:46] go back to myself back to myself back to
[53:48] myself but the lord wants to see that
[53:50] that that sacrificial life that setting
[53:53] aside of your life all to him and that's
[53:56] what we're talking about a real
[53:57] sanctification setting yourself aside
[54:00] so that he can use you because he can't
[54:02] use you if that if your vessel is busy
[54:04] doing everything you want to do what god
[54:06] goes to reach on the shelf where you
[54:08] should be set aside and you're not there
[54:12] i can't imagine how disappointed he is
[54:15] when he said well i cleansed you i
[54:16] sanctified you and here you are doing
[54:17] what you think you ought to be doing or
[54:18] what you want to do and he goes to use
[54:20] that vessel and it's not there
[54:23] well say lord forgive me
[54:25] for not always being available where i
[54:27] ought to be not being not being
[54:29] surrendered to you the way i ought to be
[54:31] lord have mercy forgive me
[54:33] amen lord have mercy
[54:35] you know we're looking he's put up the
[54:36] devil's put up all those scarecrows
[54:38] we're going to close here in just a
[54:39] minute i have like a one quote here i
[54:41] just want to read if i could
[54:43] he's put up all these scarecrows and
[54:45] he's got us thinking in a certain way
[54:47] he's got us into this place where so
[54:49] it's just lord lord's going to do it
[54:50] lord he's already done it
[54:52] how many times did the brother branham
[54:54] have to say even about just about
[54:55] healing and in general he said if jesus
[54:57] christ was here right now he couldn't do
[54:59] any more for you than he's already done
[55:02] i believe it was in the church age book
[55:04] and you correct me if i'm wrong brothers
[55:05] but i believe in the church age but
[55:06] brother branham said the reason people
[55:08] will miss it is because they cannot
[55:09] accept the full atonement because they
[55:12] can't accept it
[55:14] and when you accept it what do you do
[55:15] you surrender to it accepting being able
[55:17] to accept something is a surrender right
[55:20] because all day long someone could try
[55:22] to give me a gift give me a gift give me
[55:23] a gift and i'm just no no i just can't i
[55:25] just can't i just can't you know people
[55:27] like that you try to give them try to
[55:28] give them a blessing and they're like no
[55:29] no no no and you're just like just
[55:31] accept the blessing i just want to help
[55:33] you or the lord put it on my heart to do
[55:34] it that's how the lord feels about us
[55:36] sometimes if we would just surrender
[55:38] ourselves to him accept lord i'll accept
[55:41] whatever blessing you want to give him
[55:43] whatever blessing you desire for my life
[55:45] lord you've already given me more than i
[55:47] could ever have imagined you gave me
[55:48] eternal life you gave me a a a faith and
[55:52] a hope of a resurrection and a body
[55:54] change that i know is coming you gave me
[55:56] a holy ghost to give me life to believe
[55:58] your word when the rest of the world
[55:59] can't see it what more can i ask for
[56:08] and this is from god's only provided
[56:09] place of worship the other man said that
[56:11] every little jot everything you must be
[56:13] faithful in
[56:14] always the little vine the little the
[56:16] little fox spoils the vine sometimes you
[56:19] leave he says it's not the big things
[56:20] you do it's the little things you leave
[56:22] undone
[56:23] remember a chain
[56:25] is only its strongest at its weakest
[56:27] weakest link blessed are they that do
[56:29] all the commandments of god that they
[56:31] might have a right to enter in do all
[56:33] god said and it said for women to have
[56:35] long hair he said a man told me not long
[56:37] ago i don't preach a clothesline
[56:38] religion i said well then you're not
[56:40] preaching the gospel
[56:42] he said god laid it out there he said
[56:44] what to do you either do it that's your
[56:46] natural reasonable thing that's how
[56:49] simple it is god said it i will do it
[56:53] lord give me grace to do it more the
[56:55] lord give me grace to do all the little
[56:57] things all the all the big things all
[56:58] the little things i don't want to leave
[57:00] any of it undone
[57:02] because all it took was one in the
[57:03] garden of eden just one
[57:05] lord i want to be there and i know it's
[57:07] not about all my works are going to help
[57:09] me to enter in no because any holy
[57:10] ghost-filled christian knows that they
[57:12] can't do it without him
[57:15] because it's not me that do with the
[57:16] works it's christ that's in me but my
[57:18] job my obligation is to give that living
[57:20] sacrifice is to be dead to my thoughts
[57:23] dead to my expectations that what i
[57:25] think is coming no i don't know what's
[57:27] coming lord i i can only understand what
[57:29] i can understand that you've given me so
[57:31] far lord let my mind let my mind if i
[57:34] can say it this way let my mind just be
[57:36] a big comma and whatever you reveal to
[57:38] me let me be ready for more let me be in
[57:40] the channel so the next time you reveal
[57:42] something i can say amen and roll right
[57:44] with it
[57:48] he said blessed our day he says he said
[57:50] uh that's your natural reasonable thing
[57:52] what little thing what the little
[57:54] insignificant jesus said blessed are
[57:55] they that would take all the little
[57:57] thing do the little things a woman and a
[57:59] woman let her hair grow that's just
[58:02] that's just something she can do
[58:03] that doesn't even
[58:05] you know you think about that even the
[58:06] natural it's just something nature does
[58:08] it for her
[58:09] right
[58:11] and she won't even do that she won't
[58:12] even do that oh teach us great things
[58:15] how can you teach great things when you
[58:16] won't do the simple common thing
[58:19] because you see your motive and
[58:20] objective is wrong
[58:22] see that what does that show if you ever
[58:24] seen anybody have you ever worked in
[58:26] different places where you see a person
[58:28] come in and the first thing that they're
[58:29] doing is trying to undermine the boss
[58:32] or trying to trying to to game for a
[58:34] higher position right away even though
[58:36] they don't know anything about the job
[58:37] they're in
[58:38] i've seen it and you can tell right away
[58:40] what motive they have has nothing to do
[58:42] with doing their job properly it's all
[58:44] about finding a position it's all about
[58:46] more power it's all about more authority
[58:48] for themselves and see that's what we
[58:50] see so many times if we're not careful
[58:52] is we can't you know if you're going to
[58:54] get promoted let god promote you
[58:56] what did he say he said when you go to
[58:57] the feast take the lower seat so that
[59:00] then we which is the governor of the
[59:01] feast can say oh friend come up higher
[59:03] but let's say lest thou take the higher
[59:05] seat he said oh someone more nobler than
[59:07] they come in and then you'll be forced
[59:08] down
[59:10] oh my so when we're trying we want all
[59:12] these big we want the big thing i want
[59:13] to we sh we ought to be seeing all the
[59:15] spiritual gifts in the church i don't
[59:16] care what anybody says those spiritual
[59:18] gifts are for the local body yeah
[59:20] they're for this body they're for the
[59:22] body we're down in texas they're for
[59:23] living water's habit every local body
[59:26] should have them
[59:27] but i say lord if i'm not ready for them
[59:29] then i need to be more surrendered
[59:31] there's a reason we ain't got it yet
[59:33] because i believe that we believe we
[59:34] should have them but there's a reason
[59:36] god the word is not wrong it's always us
[59:40] it's me it's me it's me o lord standing
[59:42] in the need of prayer there's nothing
[59:44] wrong with this word we have received a
[59:46] perfect word in this hour
[59:48] all the mysteries of god should be
[59:50] finished they've been finished they are
[59:52] being finished right now and you the
[59:54] question is can we surrender to them are
[59:56] we willing to wait upon your ministry
[59:58] maybe you feel a call in your life that
[1:00:00] the lord has put it on your heart that
[1:00:01] there's going to be something great
[1:00:02] coming well you know what until that
[1:00:04] time whatever he's given you be faithful
[1:00:06] in if you're faithful in italy you'll be
[1:00:07] faithful and much right you know why you
[1:00:09] don't get much because you ain't
[1:00:11] faithful in the little yet
[1:00:13] you know why the church doesn't have
[1:00:15] much yet this bride is because she
[1:00:17] hasn't been faithful in the little
[1:00:18] things yet
[1:00:20] why because that's the law of god
[1:00:22] it's just the word it's that simple we
[1:00:24] say oh well it can't be true because
[1:00:25] we're the bride that's nothing but pride
[1:00:28] that's nothing but pride because i
[1:00:29] remember a vision the prophet had of
[1:00:31] that bride going up and what was it the
[1:00:32] last little bit started to stumble and
[1:00:34] we're at that spot right now that i
[1:00:36] believe this word is crying out to us
[1:00:38] the holy ghost is yelling to us get back
[1:00:39] in line
[1:00:41] it's time we told the word once again
[1:00:43] and stop playing around
[1:00:46] stop thinking that we get to skip all of
[1:00:48] the intermediate steps and get to
[1:00:50] business with god and say lord what are
[1:00:51] the little things we're leaving undone
[1:00:56] he's he's going to do it he is doing it
[1:00:58] but he's looking for people to surrender
[1:01:00] to it
[1:01:01] he's looking for us that would just be
[1:01:02] willing lord whatever little thing you
[1:01:04] want lord i'm going to be i'm going to
[1:01:06] be that that wife
[1:01:07] that's married to you and only cares for
[1:01:09] the things of her husband now
[1:01:11] we're not talking naturally we're
[1:01:12] talking spiritually
[1:01:14] i only want to care for the things of my
[1:01:16] husband how it can please my husband
[1:01:18] that's what i want to be all right amen
[1:01:21] we're going to keep reading here he says
[1:01:22] he says how can you teach the great
[1:01:24] things you won't do the simple common
[1:01:25] thing because your motive and objective
[1:01:26] is wrong we need to check up on that
[1:01:28] sometimes
[1:01:29] lord lord forgive me is there times
[1:01:31] where i've wanted something to happen
[1:01:33] just because i wanted to prove somebody
[1:01:35] wrong
[1:01:36] i know i just admit i've been guilty i
[1:01:38] say lord please just let this happen so
[1:01:40] so they can prove it wrong no the lord
[1:01:42] doesn't play like that
[1:01:44] the lord does not mess around like that
[1:01:45] the ultimate proving wrong is going to
[1:01:47] be this body change
[1:01:49] when they all look around and say i
[1:01:50] thought i thought the rapture was
[1:01:51] supposed to happen first and he says
[1:01:52] it's already coming you didn't know it
[1:01:54] that'll be the ultimate if you want to
[1:01:55] put it this way i told you so but that's
[1:01:57] why we wait on the lord because he said
[1:01:59] i will avenge
[1:02:01] vengeance is mine saith the lord i will
[1:02:02] repay
[1:02:04] but we're all looking for where to dig
[1:02:05] our little things in whether it be you
[1:02:07] know uh theologically or spiritually
[1:02:09] whatever way we want to do we're looking
[1:02:11] to dig the knife in so many times
[1:02:12] because that that briar nature that we
[1:02:14] have to fight every day we got to tamp
[1:02:16] it down
[1:02:18] we got to tamp it down
[1:02:19] it's your love to god
[1:02:21] lord i don't care what you want me to do
[1:02:24] i'm willing to do it he says then you're
[1:02:26] getting somewhere but if you don't do it
[1:02:28] that way the way he said do it
[1:02:31] it's his choosing the place i have
[1:02:33] chosen that's where you worship with
[1:02:36] your sacrifice you put cain brought a
[1:02:38] sacrifice abra brought his it depends on
[1:02:41] what place you take it into
[1:02:43] if you take it into the place where he's
[1:02:45] chosen it'll be all right he'll accept
[1:02:47] it if it's not he won't accept it now
[1:02:50] there is the difference between a
[1:02:52] pharisee and a born-again son or
[1:02:54] daughter of god
[1:02:55] because they know where to take the
[1:02:56] sacrifice see the pharisees had tons of
[1:02:59] sacrifices oh i go here and i do this
[1:03:01] funeral service and i go here and i do
[1:03:03] these arms and i make these prayers in
[1:03:05] the square and i do all these things but
[1:03:06] their sacrifice was being brought to a
[1:03:08] place of selfishness
[1:03:10] it was being brought to a place of
[1:03:11] self-serving like look at me look at me
[1:03:14] look at me but the christian what do
[1:03:15] they do they'll do these things in
[1:03:16] secret don't let your left hand know
[1:03:18] what your right hand is doing
[1:03:20] when they give their when they want to
[1:03:21] help out a brother or sister they don't
[1:03:22] have to go and let everybody know that
[1:03:24] they're going to do it they don't have
[1:03:25] to tell other people after they've done
[1:03:27] it they don't have to do this and do
[1:03:28] that or when they're going to go over to
[1:03:30] do help someone else out nobody else has
[1:03:32] got to know about it
[1:03:33] they just do it in secret why because do
[1:03:36] when you do it in secret your heavenly
[1:03:37] father will reward you openly
[1:03:40] i say lord that reward that i want is
[1:03:41] just a closer walk with him that's the
[1:03:43] kind of reward we're talking we're
[1:03:44] talking about spiritual rewards we're
[1:03:46] not talking with natural things those
[1:03:47] are great praise the lord you know if
[1:03:48] you've got a house and a car and all
[1:03:50] those things but you know what i want
[1:03:52] let's build up our kingdom in heaven
[1:03:54] let's build up our treasures in heaven
[1:03:55] let's not don't even worry about what
[1:03:57] other people think about you people some
[1:03:59] people you know the way they think they
[1:04:01] may see you doing a certain thing or not
[1:04:02] doing a certain thing and assume
[1:04:03] something and you don't even know when
[1:04:05] you get on the other side you don't know
[1:04:06] that that person gave everything they
[1:04:07] had to jesus christ and you never knew
[1:04:09] anything about it because you were
[1:04:10] looking on the natural you couldn't see
[1:04:12] the inside lord help us to have
[1:04:14] spiritual eyes to see and ears to hear
[1:04:16] right amen
[1:04:20] remember first corinthians chapter 13 he
[1:04:22] says though i give my body to be burned
[1:04:25] though i give all i have to the poor and
[1:04:27] i have not charity it avails me nothing
[1:04:29] that's right so what is it
[1:04:31] remember the pharisees did all they
[1:04:33] could do they gave up everything they
[1:04:35] had to be in the priesthood they're in
[1:04:36] the priesthood they gave up all those
[1:04:38] things seemingly even though in their
[1:04:40] heart they were ravening for those
[1:04:41] things that's all they desired
[1:04:44] but on the outside it looked great but
[1:04:46] what was it they couldn't come to that
[1:04:47] holy ghost surrender
[1:04:49] to say that's because that's where the
[1:04:50] sacrifice is accepted is underneath that
[1:04:52] that token the holy ghost the only place
[1:04:54] the sacrifice can be accepted is when
[1:04:56] you're doing it according to his will
[1:04:58] and not your own that's right
[1:05:02] amen
[1:05:03] says let us notice here the place that
[1:05:05] he chose for the sacrifice to be laid he
[1:05:07] placed that he chose to put his
[1:05:08] sacrifice you can't put it on any of
[1:05:10] these gates but the place that he chose
[1:05:12] to put it he also put his name in that
[1:05:14] place see that's what he said here he
[1:05:16] chose to put his name in it now let us
[1:05:18] search the scriptures for that place for
[1:05:20] that is the place where he put his name
[1:05:22] now let's read i'm going to skip down
[1:05:24] here a little bit he says
[1:05:26] he's talking about uh he says now you
[1:05:29] can't take this your sincerity in all
[1:05:31] that you want to confess you just can't
[1:05:33] take it to a methodist altar to a
[1:05:35] baptist altar to a pentecostal altar but
[1:05:37] there is an altar somewhere that he
[1:05:38] chose to put his name in it and he would
[1:05:41] meet you at that place
[1:05:42] now if you get everything running just
[1:05:44] right it's going to run everything's set
[1:05:46] in order if there's a short in that wire
[1:05:48] that light won't come on because it's
[1:05:50] been grounded
[1:05:51] and when you'll take one of god's words
[1:05:53] or one of his places and in your now
[1:05:56] listen to this if you'll take one of his
[1:05:57] words or one of his places
[1:06:00] and in your own heart have selfish
[1:06:02] objectives it'll ground the power of god
[1:06:05] right there
[1:06:07] so what's our objective
[1:06:09] is our objective to to do our own will
[1:06:12] because we have a vision and we have an
[1:06:15] expectation of what we want ourselves to
[1:06:18] be
[1:06:19] or are we trying to mean his expectation
[1:06:22] of what he wants us to be
[1:06:24] are you are you set let everyone abide
[1:06:26] in the calling wherein they are called
[1:06:29] are you satisfied with who he's made you
[1:06:32] are you satisfied with the gifts he's
[1:06:33] given to you
[1:06:35] or are you always looking to take
[1:06:37] someone else's or are you unsatisfied
[1:06:39] always looking with the carnal side of
[1:06:41] always looking on the things of others
[1:06:43] and say oh i wish i had what this guy
[1:06:44] had oh i wish i had what this guy had oh
[1:06:46] i wish i could just do this the way this
[1:06:48] person does it you can't
[1:06:50] you never will be able to
[1:06:52] the the best you'll get is a carnal
[1:06:53] impersonation
[1:06:55] if i tried to preach like brother cam or
[1:06:57] brother jesse or sing like another
[1:06:58] person to do this agent the best it
[1:07:00] would get is a carnal impersonation it
[1:07:01] won't do any good that's right i'll
[1:07:03] never be satisfied because i'll deep
[1:07:05] down know that i'm just faking it
[1:07:07] and god will never be satisfied because
[1:07:08] that's not who he made me
[1:07:11] when god isn't satisfied when you try to
[1:07:13] form yourself to another image he said
[1:07:15] be comfort be transformed by the
[1:07:16] renewing of your mind
[1:07:18] transformed into what into his image not
[1:07:20] anybody else's
[1:07:22] and that image is an image of sacrifice
[1:07:24] it's an image of sanctification setting
[1:07:26] yourself aside
[1:07:28] every day
[1:07:30] to serve him amen jesus said i only do
[1:07:33] that which pleases the father i only do
[1:07:35] those things so he says he says if
[1:07:37] you've got your own selfish objective
[1:07:38] it'll you'll ground the power of god
[1:07:40] right there if you do it because you now
[1:07:42] listen if you do it because you want to
[1:07:43] be smart
[1:07:44] you want to be different from somebody
[1:07:46] else
[1:07:47] or something right there it's grounded
[1:07:49] it'll blow a fuse you're wrong you've
[1:07:52] got to come with sincerity with all your
[1:07:55] heart your motives and objectives place
[1:07:58] that on god then search for his place
[1:08:01] find where he said and bring it there
[1:08:04] wow that's what he's looking for we need
[1:08:06] more sincerity
[1:08:09] if if the lord if the lord could tell
[1:08:11] the prophet of god of this aid the
[1:08:12] messenger of this age that you lost the
[1:08:14] love for the people you need to be more
[1:08:15] sincere
[1:08:16] and now we've come 60 plus years down
[1:08:18] the line from that
[1:08:20] then how much more
[1:08:22] than we need to have why because
[1:08:24] iniquity shall abound the love of many
[1:08:27] would wax cold that's right and we're
[1:08:29] seeing it brothers and sisters ye who
[1:08:31] are filled with the holy ghost can see
[1:08:33] the iniquity
[1:08:34] even within the ranks of the message you
[1:08:36] can see it you can see that they say one
[1:08:39] thing act another way you can see all
[1:08:41] these different things but don't let it
[1:08:42] make you grow cold
[1:08:45] you know what you cling you cling closer

[1:09:39] help me to be fully surrendered lord to
[1:09:41] everything that you would have from me

[1:09:47] i go lord that that life will be able to
[1:09:49] shine through me lord because you're not
[1:09:51] going to dwell in a filthy house you're
[1:09:53] not going to lord when when i when you
[1:09:55] want to call me
[1:09:56] lord when you want to call my brothers
[1:09:58] and sisters may he look on the shelf and
[1:10:00] find that that life is so set aside it's
[1:10:02] sitting on that shelf perfectly ready to
[1:10:04] be grabbed by the master's hand and use
[1:10:06] lord for whatever you would have it to
[1:10:08] be used for lord if it just be a little
[1:10:10] thing lord if it be a big thing we don't
[1:10:12] care because we know that the only place
[1:10:14] we can find joy the only place that we
[1:10:16] can find peace the only place we can
[1:10:18] find satisfaction is in your perfect
[1:10:20] will lord
[1:10:22] lord we know we can't find it anywhere
[1:10:23] else lord we can all i believe testify
[1:10:25] that we've tried to find that
[1:10:26] satisfaction other places lord maybe
[1:10:28] even when we've even since we've started
[1:10:30] serving you we've maybe tried to put our
[1:10:32] hand to certain things thinking it was
[1:10:34] your will but then we find it all fell
[1:10:36] flat because we had the wrong motives
[1:10:37] and objectives
[1:10:39] but lord let us lay that on the altar
[1:10:40] now let us be honest with ourselves lord
[1:10:42] let us be willing to wait upon our
[1:10:44] ministry lord let us be willing to wait
[1:10:47] for that still small voice lord and in
[1:10:49] the meantime lord all the things that
[1:10:50] you already said in your word that we
[1:10:52] ought to do let us be about the father's
[1:10:53] business
[1:10:54] lord you've already given us the
[1:10:56] blueprints you've already given us the
[1:10:57] instructions and lord i believe that the
[1:10:59] ones that are here this morning you've
[1:11:01] already given a heart to receive it
[1:11:03] you've already given a heart that they
[1:11:04] desire to perform it but lord may we
[1:11:06] just get out of our own way and not
[1:11:08] worry about the bigness or smallness of
[1:11:10] the seeming situation but lord if we
[1:11:12] could just look into the word and say
[1:11:13] lord that's the word that needs to be
[1:11:14] fulfilled in this hour
[1:11:16] lord jeremiah send me
[1:11:19] let me be willing to fulfill that word
[1:11:20] no matter how small
[1:11:21] lord if it's just giving a cup of water
[1:11:23] to somebody lord if it's just getting
[1:11:25] down on my knees for a minute here or
[1:11:26] there because all of a sudden throughout
[1:11:28] the day you put somebody on my heart
[1:11:30] lord maybe i was at work and i didn't i
[1:11:32] thought i didn't have enough time but
[1:11:34] lord you put it on my heart right there
[1:11:35] just to go even it was just a prayer for
[1:11:37] a minute more i want to sacrifice my
[1:11:39] will to you so that your glory could
[1:11:42] rest upon me lord that your work and
[1:11:44] your power could rest upon me will glory
[1:11:46] in that lord will just say lord i don't
[1:11:48] care how big or little it is i want to
[1:11:50] do it for your glory
[1:11:51] not with the wrong objectives lord but
[1:11:53] just to just to know
[1:11:55] lord i could imagine just to know that
[1:11:57] we're in your will would be enough for
[1:11:59] me
[1:12:01] to know lord that i'm performing the
[1:12:02] word that you desire for me would be
[1:12:04] enough for me
[1:12:06] lord let it be for each one that's here
[1:12:08] this morning lord
[1:12:09] lord i believe each one of us is
[1:12:11] desiring to surrender ourselves more to
[1:12:13] you lord jesus
[1:12:14] lord may we just place ourselves on the
[1:12:16] altar this morning
[1:12:17] oh god place ourselves on the altar
[1:12:19] every morning when we wake up lord from
[1:12:21] the time we wake up to the time we go to
[1:12:23] bed
[1:12:24] just to bury that old man underneath
[1:12:25] lord
[1:12:26] and say lord have your perfect will and
[1:12:28] way in our lives lord i think about
[1:12:30] enoch it wasn't any great amazing thing
[1:12:32] but the scripture simply says he walked
[1:12:34] with god and he was not for you took him
[1:12:38] lord it's that simple everyday walk lord
[1:12:40] that you've called us to
[1:12:41] if we could be faithful in that little
[1:12:43] thing that little everyday walk lord it
[1:12:46] seems so simple but it's so easy to let
[1:12:48] it slip
[1:12:49] or because we get caught by the cares of
[1:12:51] the world and so supposed obligations
[1:12:53] that we have
[1:12:54] lord let us not be drawn by those things
[1:12:56] lord but let us be drawn by those bands
[1:12:58] of love back to you lord
[1:13:00] amen we just commit ourselves to you in
[1:13:01] the name of the lord jesus christ we ask
[1:13:03] it and we thank you for it lord
[1:13:05] amen thank you lord jesus how many you
[1:13:08] feel clean how many of you feel like
[1:13:09] you've been cleansed this morning i feel
[1:13:11] i feel there's a renewing in my spirit
[1:13:14] that he's bringing us to that place of
[1:13:16] full surrender where his least little
[1:13:19] desire is my greatest desire
[1:13:22] amen amen
[1:13:24] let's just sing that song the more that
[1:13:26] i surrender
[1:13:29] amen if you have need a prayer we'll
[1:13:31] pray for you we'll have our brother
[1:13:32] jesse come up here to close the service
[1:13:35] we appreciate you we appreciate our your
[1:13:37] pastor brother jesse
[1:13:39] for having us
[1:13:41] just pray that something was said that
[1:13:42] would draw you closer
[1:13:44] i believe the ministry we're not here to
[1:13:46] uplift ourselves
[1:13:48] we're out here to uplift the name of
[1:13:49] jesus christ
[1:13:51] he's the only one worthy
[1:13:52] the only one holy
[1:13:54] there was no one else found worthy to
[1:13:56] open the book
[1:13:59] amen
