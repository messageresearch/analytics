TRANSCRIPT
========================================
just uh you know maybe nothing's super super master fresh mastered but uh something that um to hear bye guys hey man this is just uh i taught this a long time ago part of this i've always brought my mind back to this study in five or six years now just trying to be the leader of the lord while i'm up here you know mostly i'm i'd like to have everything studied out and placed here there this and that just run with it and those sort of things but uh we're just trying to learn the yield too and just kind of follow what the lord having me saying i want to be i want to be more and more yielded every day especially on our daily walk with him so let's uh let's go with matthew 13 30. matthew 13 verse 30. and the scripture says let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of the harvest i will say to the reapers gather you together first the tares to bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn so let's say you're a word of prayer during the father lord jesus will be absolutely lord jesus so we believe though that all things will work out lord and yes lord you're still a healer god lord you're still a miracle worker god or you're still uh all that your bible says you are yes i know yes you're real you're living you're breathing no lord you're ever amongst us you you have your angels round about your bride god lord and you you see all things you miss nothing god and lord god help us lord be mindful of those things god would always keep those to the forefront of our hearts god the rich and lord right in there was sealed and lord by the way that's jesus and lord jesus we'll just we ask you blessings little service god lord and lord we know all things we'll bless the people god lord i speak lord is your heavenly lord to really just stay right with the word and just good to be back here [Music] just there's so much going on in the world today and i guess by the title i'd probably have to say that maybe the title we say to the reapers so maybe we minister on that by god's grace or we'll see you see what comes to me i want to be keep my mind open you know i've been worried all week i went down here to speak on and i tried to study here and there and things got busy sisters we had a sister just move and she needed the brothers that could come we moved here this morning got out about two o'clock ran home changed and hit the road so hey man just uh kind of running around as always and those sort of things so i'm able to speak on say to the reapers of the lord go this way fully i'm not sure but we'll see my god's grace in i guess if uh if i can read this scripture in matthew 13 verse 30 the bible says let both grow together until the harvest in the time of the harvest i'll say to the reapers gathering together first the pairs and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my oh yes so we see two groups of people in the midst here we know this is in parallel form we know what we're going to see uh i we heard another lovely pastor of the jesse that go up there and we heard that the road versus wade has been overturned and now it's up to the states yes amen um which is a huge answer to a lot of our hearts a lot of our prayers that even uh got into the old conversation on the job site and um but being who we are we're grateful for those things amen but in this day in this hour we must also be very careful we know this thing is going to turn religious real fast right right because the mark will be those who will not worship with that's right the image or the beast so that's right what what what is this what would that call what would this call this is going to cause the churches to stir against uh the heathen and the women versus the churches or the religious now it's bringing the religion into the into the boxing match uh if you will or the political realm pulling the now religion into the political realm because that's literally the only thing keeping uh uh or something that could bring religion into this is that law we see that very um and thank god that the by the grace of god less babies will be uh slaughtered and uh how can god continue to bless the nation that does that oh my goodness all right i never know except the bride is still here that's right brother amen and that's uh the only thing is the prophet god said that's the only thing holding the judgments of god now is that the bride of jesus christ is still resigning on their inheritance and she will let go of the inheritance and it should be pulled up from this world and then god that now is gathered with his wife and he is going to show his wife and display his power before his coming yes and as he releases his power and his judgments uh the bible says there will be one question in the heart of the people's mind and that question will be whose name is on the lamb's book of life so that is going to now how is that going to be because people are going to turn religious real fast and they're going to be diving into the scriptures because remember the prophet he says he said he's at that gentile door we soon closed he says he says and people were going to the altar thinking they're being saved and they're not that's right the antichrist will be a religious figure but though within that mixture it's iron and clay and we know protestant protestantism and romanism will be mixed together and the protestants will lean obviously more heavy towards the scripture than the romanism and those sort of things so the question and record in the book of revelations is whose name will be they will wonder those left here will wonder whose name is on the lamb's book of life and is uh we're just getting done with that study there in the children's sunday school and lydia was able to answer every question when she came she got the title belt on that sunday by god's grace and she was able to pick she declined on the candies obviously and that's okay but she did get the title belt in the mvp status for that movie played out there so we appreciate that applause for wisdom and knowledge in the scriptures and revelations uh but getting into this thought here um notice but it says but let both grow until the harvest so in the beginning we know that god actually if you think about this now god put the serpent here in serpent form not snake form but he put serpent form here on earth first correct right right now is the earth for them absolutely not now was was the serpent in the original creation yes absolutely what about the serpent now was that in the original creation no because now the serpent has been hybrided has been hybrid to white but now and now that animal now has a soul area in in their in their heart okay they have an ability now to receive an empty spot in their heart for the holy ghost but they will never be able to accept it right by the grace of god because their names were never written on the lamb's book of life so as we get into it the bible says now let both grow into the harvest and in the time of the harvest notice they'll be so close but to the scene they're very elected the bible says that they'll be just running neck and neck a parallel one to another he says but in the time of the harvest i'll say to the reapers gathering together first the tares for now what should be in our vision what should be in our mind the prophet said the prophet god said what he says watch the verbal curtain he says watch he says uh rome he says he says watch the bamboo curtain he says watch china jesus watch the king of the north he says and watch uh the catholic church and those sorts of things and what he said was to watch watch those things right yep so we're to wash those things because the first thing we're going to see he says is the binding together of the tares the antichrist system will bow together he says and bind them in bundles to burn them into what groups what are bundles they're actually into groups that's what they're into what denominations the bible talks about the great uh the of babylon which is revelation 17 and she was what the mother of daughters and she would have children who are children because what the catholic church came out and then we see lutheranism and then protestantism of methodists and all those things and that's what pentecost and now saints of god we must be careful as the holy ghost has led us now into receiving this message not all israel's remember israel anointing will be the same it will be the same holy ghost on every vessel but the difference will be the teaching amen amen amen the difference will be the teaching we just had a brother come a little bit ago and he said he's we need to lay down all doctrine well let's let's not go that far i wouldn't say that all the way because we need doctrine we have the holy ghost in jesus said what we are to be true worshipers in spirit and in truth we must have one the holy ghost residing in us and what we must have our doctrine just as close as we can get to the perfection amen exactly right we need to prove all the things went through the scriptures show them the quotes bring it through the shadows and time saints of god the holy ghost will lead and guide us what into all truth he promised it i believe it and he is still doing it absolutely amen my old pastor right there dove to the scriptures what the holy spirit will reveal we'll open these things up right here in this bible right but in the message quotes and those sort of things thanks to god the word of god is still waiting absolutely it's going to open continue amen amen amen he said but no notice yes and then at the end of that he says after we see these bundles he says but gather wheat into my bar absolutely sure yes how many here believe that we are wheat yes amen absolutely i believe that we are weak by the grace of god yes hallelujah now what i taught i had come a couple weeks ago on wednesday and the way that that study went i came back home and i taught it on a wednesday and then my home assembly and the way that the way that looks saints of god that's literally i really believe that's literally what we what god is going to vindicate as his bride yes the ones that can love one another amen the exact correct way hallelujah my brother had texted me after that and said brother he said he said brother he said he said we're doing a lot of soul searching here after that when i said amen praise the lord we all glory to the grace of god no matter or whoever if we can love each other beyond fully 100 agreeing and one system i see like this one brother might see like this with saints of god if you can literally look at them and love them as are he as a spiritual brother which should be what closer than a natural that's right they've got the holy ghost and i've got the holy ghost now we're actually a spiritual eternal being that can look past it amen hallelujah the god of them shall love the god and me and the god of me should love the god of them amen that's what we're looking for amen yes and absolutely nothing creeping their hearts nothing yes praise god hallelujah what the problem's got to do is there's coming a time where we will we will come together it will be rejoicing and we will weep and this is exactly the exact same thing that what saint peter started preaching on the day he pulled on when when the holy ghost found the first time in the book of acts he says and it shall come to pass joel 2 and 28 and shall come to pass afterward that i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy he says your old man shall dream green seasons for your and your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirits things for god i believe we're about ready to see another out horn amen jesus and i will shoot wonders in the heavens and the earth blood and fire smoking pillars now notice the sun shall be darkened in sir the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the lord come amen now let's go jump to uh amos 5 and 18. now notice what the bible what the scripture says here now amos amos said he says i was not born probably he says my daddy wasn't probably he says but god gave me a thus say the lord [Applause] he said i had no spiritual experience of anything because i probably practiced the farmer right he's but god gave him the word of god he was he he was just like us amen [Applause] we are the ones who the word of god came to amen glory he says when you eat the book you'll prophesy again yes amen [Applause] to you the desire is of the day of the lord he says and to what end is it for you he says the day of the lord is darkness and not not light that's right in the evening time there shall be light that was the evening time of saints of god when this day when this dark day we say to god we are in a day that is so dark yes literally it is complete i'm saying like this there is just complete darkness out there i'm now doing a job in elementary and it's and they have the homosexual rainbow in a big section of their hallway right here just about this big like this not seven colors six colors and then right above it says be who you want to be and it's all in the in those six colors your states of god they're training the children already to pick and choose and to be it's what is it in the state of confusion a state of darkness what is confusion it is a darkness let me tell you when you are confused you will not be able to tell what is going on absolutely this should be what it should be as everything should be as simple as black and white that's it that's how it's going to be right but what confusion sets on and you cannot even you can understand anything you can't figure it out something's you really they cannot even have the ability to reason simple common sense that's right brother normal things they'll not be able to pick up why because it's that dark absolutely he says he's in if a man that flee from a lion he says in a bear match him he says or went into a house and leaned it on a wall and a serpent bit him at this time of darkness things of god they'll try and get away from this but something else will get them they will not be able to discern they'll try and run from it but because it's so dark they'll not be able to see the next thing coming amen right right that's why the bible says what the wise virgin had their lambs filled and and burning and shrimping and they had extra oil off yeah absolutely why because it was complete why did i need those ladders because it's a complete darkness what it was the coming of the lord for his god amen amen absolutely shall not the day of the lord be darkness and not light remember what malachi 4 was sent before the great and dreadful day of the lord sure right he says and even very dark he says and no brightness in it i hate i despise your fish feast days he says and i will not spell sees a smell in your solemn assemblies in other words he's looking for what this thing is going to be finished right confusion everywhere try to witness on the job and this one no matter what you say this one sees it this way this one sees it that way what with absolutely no bible backing right they just think this this one thinks this way this one thinks this way this one thinks this way and they just continue on living the exact same kind of life they always live but saints of god we were giving something we were given something much more right the word of god hallelujah it is spirit and life right and though we were given this the bible says if you walk in the light as you're as he is in the light and that's what we're to do if the holy ghost i'll say like this in this dark hour and you are a seed of god and you receive the baptism of the holy ghost you have now been joined with god and the bible says that god is light and now you are a carrier of the lord amen you should think different absolutely and what you should be able to be seen by the grace of god hallelujah that's right how much light are we emitting there are stars so this year's new series years ago there are stars you can see with your naked eye yes you walk outside and see all that little constellation there constellation there and those are what probably they type of the push version sure and then if you take out a magnifying or or like there's a telescope and you look and you were able to see stars you were not able to see that the world was not even seeing those lights those are what they justify those that live just like the world but what they have a seed of life in them and then the stars water they were able to be seen but just barely in the darkness but then here comes the moon actually the moon can light up [Applause] she can light it yeah glory you go out on one of the full moons however and especially with the cold days if it's got snow on the ground and while you don't like that we can walk the entire dark you can walk all night and not in that trip over one thing because the moon can light it up that's right absolutely sure amen now let's continue on by god's grace ah as i was thinking on these things things of god might not be something tremendously deep or however when jesus says to the reapers he says gather up the tares and then bind them and then then he says gather up the wheat saints of god it's so dark out there how will he know which one's which all right now notice here i want to kind of teach this and emphasize in matthew 3 and 1 notice how this works in matthew 3 and 1 he says in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judea and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand so notice the prophet of god comes out and he has what a message and his message is he's what he says the kingdom of god is right now at hand absolutely this is the time when uh we're too uh when something great is going to take place absolutely sure now now also as john the baptist would get done with his ministries he said he said he's and jesus must increase he says i must decrease uh christ and picks up the the baton if you will just don't know about that the battalion says christian knows about that the baton and we see here in matthew 4 a little bit further on that when jesus heard that john was cast into prison he departed into galilee and as he went this way in verse 17 he says and from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand so notice jesus has the exact same message as what john the baptist they're preaching the same thing they want this is the time this is the time absolutely saints of god and the kingdom of heaven is about to be ended right now this thing is about to finish i heard a minister that i enjoy a minister i enjoy listening to he said he said saints of god he says we better run to the altar because we've heard the message dollar does not mean one thing because there's not no guarantee in hearing the guarantee is being filled with the holy ghost amen when you have been filled with the holy ghost and what is the holy ghost it is a new birth and what is a mess absolutely and he says what run to the altar make sure that you are ready to go check everything i'll say this when i get ready to go to thailand well i'm kind of one of those last second guys just because the way my life goes okay the night before thailand you start throwing stuff in there because what i got work you gotta go from work then you do bible study here there you get someone needs help this is that you're gonna do that business so i'm left to the night before using the pack but one thing for certain i made sure i had my driver's license and i had my passport and those three things right there are musts absolutely you must have those what you bring your bible you bring your word you bring your laptop what for teaching those things in other words when you're going out of town we're going to overseas what we're going to do whatever god would have us do we want to be ready for anything that's coming because why he said the only way to get there is to have certain things sure now let's continue on here john baptist ministry was repent for the kingdom of god is saying heaven is a hand he was all the scene jesus comes up repent for the kingdom of heaven isn't he and then we see later here in matthew 10 and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out to hear all manners of sickness and all matters of disease he had gathered his twelve warriors now he gathered called them and the bible said he gave them power where are we going to get our power from when we start another book about when the whole thing is when when the when the divine brings forth another branch who gives what power we are going to receive the power of the holy ghost like never before but what he said jesus would have to give it to them he says and gave them power against unclean spirits jesus to cast them out to you all manners of sickness and all manner of disease and now notice what he does in verse five these twelve these twelve jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into all the ways of the gentiles and into the house into any city the samaritans enter ye not but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand so notice how they are all saying the exact same thing one the bible says what the spirit and the bride will are saying they will say the same thing what's that word they say wow amen and those that hear it say come on [Applause] absolutely the spirit of the holy ghost will have the exact same message in every single messenger absolutely every single individual that was saying what the same thing now notice the unity the prophet god himself and then his disciples after have the same they're saying the same things amen amen yes how come we're hearing things that we're not said before in such a way i'll say like that he says but whoa he's as you go preaching the kingdom of heaven is at hand and not only preach he says what he says heal the sick cleanse the that was leprosy ever seen freely give absolutely man direct direct direct commands direct authority given to these people now notice what they do what do they have to do to perform this they just had to believe what he said amen amen they had to believe and have faith that what he said would take place hallelujah yes did they understand everything jesus said at this time absolutely not but what all they had to do was believe the simplicity of this hallelujah to preach this one thing and do these sort of things and have faith in it and it'll happen it'll have uh uh results hallelujah that's why what we can pray over the amen and he's gonna get well amen absolutely we have confidence in that now let's continue on here by god's grace in matthew 6 33 what did jesus say he says but seek ye first the kingdom of god in his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take no thought what shall we eat what shall we drink wherever shall we clothe eating drinking and clothing why he says because everyone needs these things and he said what the holy father knows you in need of these things but before those things can be added to you he says receive the holy you know why a lot of people don't get blessings are they tithed do they give offerings right are they giving alms and have they received the holy ghost first and received the holy ghost because he says seeking first holy ghost and his righteousness and these things all these things shall be added to you amen [Applause] right now pulling for money all the way for money pulling for money and i said brother wrestle maybe you should trust jesus and not me that's right right because when i have a need or however i just ask the lord jesus christ right right amen that's right brother 2.4 grade point average college dropout plumber the lowest of the trades right in the old sewer system and god can provide for me all right amen yes again absolutely now let's continue on now notice matthew 7 and 20 jesus said wherefore by their fruits you shall know them not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven just because they can identify that god is lord does not mean you'll enter in notice it has a saying that these guys see that these are baptized the correct way that they have thought that they teach wrong but the bible says what their workers are iniquity right knowing to do the right thing but not doing it sure now very simple absolutely sure now i'll notice about this in matthew 11 11 verily i say unto you among them that are born of women that have not there has not risen a grave in the john the baptist not withstanding he said of all from adam all the way up oh wait he said what i'm sorry yeah from all of the born of woman so not adam right right good good from april yes good from abel there has not uh risen are greater than john the baptist he was the greatest that's right in god's own words he said this was the greatest that's right brother right god identified him as the greatest yes the holy ghost said he was the greatest amen that was standing he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he so saints of god as jesus will identify john the baptist and say he was the greatest man if you are in the kingdom of heaven you are now greater than him that's right okay right right now to think higher more higher than yourself then you should right but realize who you are because we must come to the point where we know who we did are identify john the baptist absolutely did the word of god prophesied john the baptist absolutely the the jesus speak of john the baptist absolutely is it recorded about him did god back up him absolutely yes what about you will god back up your words amen when you pray does god hear you yeah absolutely when god when god when you start weeping and crying for like that's the souls and the abominations of the city will god hear it absolutely hallelujah yes because you're greater now but what is the kingdom of heaven sister lena mike the king of heaven matthew 12. i don't know if you heard this before however you're kind of blue what is the kingdom of heaven matthew 12 verse 26 says if satan cast out satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand and if i yells about cast out devils by whom your children cast them whom do your children cast them out for therefore they shall be your judges but if i cast out devils by the spirit of god he said that the kingdom of heaven is coming unto you yes so the kingdom of heaven is the holy ghost coming that's right yes amen hallelujah glory the holy spirit has come down for 2000 years and has been here watching all things yes yes in luke 17 and 20. and when he was demanding the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come but they kept preaching and preaching the kingdom of comet the kingdom of heaven is here repent repent for the kingdom of heaven is here right he says the kingdom of heaven cometh not with observation neither shall they say no here or there for they can behold the kingdom of heaven is within america and the news would go around that something took place in acts 2 in jerusalem the holy ghost was spread out did that make roman news absolutely not he said before the prophet said he says one tenth of whatever the jews even knew jesus was alive what about these right here the next day after the after the day of pentecost uh uh hear you hear ye there's been something going on the christ has risen this and that and what his fears come down and now they're seeing this and this and 3 000 got baptized that was not in the daily news right because what it comes with not with observation amen can anyone pinpoint when every single one of us that have received the holy ghost when they received it do we know every single moment this and this this did i know that at certain point of time this brother or this sister was going to receive the holy ghost at that home we didn't know right what the holy ghost chooses and he prepares yes i want to i want to hit something here by god's grace i want to uh let's just jump here i want to hit this real quick here in john 3 and 5. i know this is simple but it's coming down to this right here we must have that token we've got to be ready glory i i get nervous i'm like lord i've done everything i know how and i'm not seeing what i want to see before i'm not hearing your voice 100 clearly i'm not even to the point where i see visions or or those sort of things yet what is it lack of what i'll tell you this lack of consecration because i believe that we are supposed to see those things i just recently heard of an accident not saying anything negative or anything but could have the holy ghost spoken right through someone through tongues interpretation and warned of certain things right brother right i'm not saying anything negative but i'm saying we need more of the holy spirit in our lives amen amen amen remember if you remember that quote there's a quote or there is a recording of a speaking and tongues and interpretation in one of the sermons of nineteen blue is 1960 and and the woman rose up and spoke in tongues and the holy ghost come down through a man and interpreted and he said he said what what did the holy spirit say he said at this time right now they are planning on the destruction of this this country he says in this same hour so while the prophet god was into preaching i believe 1916 when he deal with the church ages that at that time i believe it was a night time there he was preaching at that time in another country or somewhere in some secret little area they were already what they were planning at the exact same time the demise of this country right yes warning us and he showed many he said many things about what would come that we would just proclaim the name of jesus christ he will be with us amen amen thank you jesus hold up but uh we're taking time now let's continue on here john 3 and 5. jesus answered bear the bear is saying to thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god born of the water and of the spirit he must get baptized or buried in the name of jesus christ and what he must then receive the baptism of the holy ghost yes a thousand times but this is the only way i know to enter into the kingdom of god that's right that which is born of flesh is flesh every one of us was born in flesh he says but when you've been born of the spirit it is now spirit amen capitalize he says marvel not that i say to me he must be born again right we know these things now let's continue on here i wanna i wanna hit this by the grace of god predestination go to matthew 13. by the time we catch this rapture this is going to be so evident okay because if you think about these scriptures here matthew 13 verse 1. the same day went jesus out of the house and sat by the sea side and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood there on the shore and he spake many things to them and parables saying behold a sower went forth to sow all right so notice here is he's starting a parable and he said the sower went forth to sow what are the sower he's got a little satchel like johnny appleseed he's got season here and he's just starting to walk right he's got these seeds and he starts flinging these seeds into the air and they're landing pieces on different grounds right and when he sowed and when he sowed some seeds fell by the wayside and fouls came and the bowels let me tell you something saints why didn't the fowls devour the seeds up in your life that's right right amen hallelujah that's right because there is no one to drive the spouse away [Music] how come no one drove the piles away on those grounds that's right who wasn't there why was the ground in that condition that's right some fell upon stony places well there's not much earth and therefore they sprung up because they have no definite deafness of earth why were there stones in that ground why wasn't that ground broke up more so it could go deeper in yes and when the sun was up they were scorched because they had no root and withered away some fell among the thorns and thorns sprung up and choked them out who let thorns grow up in that ground amen and brought forth fruit some 100 some 60 fold some 30-fold who has ears on him here amen yeah amen saints of god any good fun why is parable 1 and parable 2 in matthew 13 about farming because it's it's bringing forth the seed or the word of god and it's what but remember that good ground had to be prepared what i'm saying is everything is predestinating that's right yes sir yes sir brother why are why why were you able to hear this word why were you able to catch the revelation the word of god you guys are racial but why do you believe this why don't you deep brother uh wow 45 almost malachi why don't you have a ponytail right now tattoos all over your arm wearing shorts because you believe the very world that your daddy caught and your mom called amen your uncle and all he's caught that's right why don't you have a stone heart why don't you have a heart like this and like that or whatever because god prepared a heart sister brother amen god has prepared your hearts for this word amen yeah you were predestinated to hear them [Applause] amen thank you jesus why would this sower throw that seed into bad places because they had to give them the same opportunity to give them the exact same seed yes the exact same seed that you let grow that you euler grow the unit grow that we all have threat that we that we caught and we're trying to produce what 30 60 100 yeah trying to produce this and letting all of us yield and produce these things yes but he gave the exact same opportunity to these other grounds yes he did what is it luke 8 15 but then on the good ground are they which is an honest and good heart who gave you an honest and good heart hallelujah everything is predestinated and in that honest and good heart if you get the correct c now notice it must be the correct c yeah should not be a denominational [Applause] [Music] [Applause] word will never use 30 60 and a hundred folders do it hallelujah glory what is this this is the beginning if it started out with the right seed falling on the right heart yes it must end up it must have a restoration of the right seed on the right heart it will produce a hundred fold [Applause] except those that had the right seed and their right ground hallelujah who are you you are the bride of jesus christ amen if you receive the baptism of the holy ghost because you heard the correct word amen the restoration of the word of god has come yes we now [Applause] right and it's a little scissor seed it's seed form but remember you take a little apple seed break down the genetics it just goes infinity we don't know how many apples are in that seed how many revelations are in this right or in this more and more truths are coming out of this ways to prove all things amen yeah absolutely glory if you want to know what an apple makes of an apple you got to look inside the seed and prove that this is an apple that what's inside that apple seed will peru will prove it's an apple that's right if you look into this it'll prove if you're a christian amen yeah praise god amen praise the lord now when dealing with matthew 13 we've always taught original sin through there second parable second interpretation right and the prophet god would pick up you know he's dealing with the original sin in the church book he says these illustrations depict perfect perfectly the parable of the lord jesus christ when he said the kingdom of heaven was likened unto a man that sowed good seed he says only to have an enemy comet plant tares amongst those good seeds he said god did not plant those cares those serpents in genesis 1. we're not these servants in genesis 3. i'll say this genesis 4. not the same serpents i was like this they had an upgrade and we had a downgrade but he's liking he's just lacking that parable he says back to the original but then we see later on the resume of the church ages in the church book what does he say something phenomenal he says and that age heading the scene of truth and the seed of air exactly is set forth according to the parable of the wheat and tears and what he said he says the church ages is the field amen yes yeah because remember in matthew 13 all these parables are parables of the kingdom of heaven that's right and if the kingdom of heaven is the holy ghost and every one of these parables must be what a parable of the new testament church right sure he says the church ages is the field jesus and in it are the wheat and tears the false church organized humanized the government the word and father true christian church amen now we see that in the scriptures but now as it gets oh let me read this real quick also on the resume he says terrors always flourish mightier than wheat or any cultivated plant the tare church grew rapidly in this first age and the wee church was flourished also in other words why is it going to be so dark at the coming of the lord because there will be so many levels of deception yeah yes it'll go so deep thanks of god let's just ask our pastor here oh jesse where will be the darkest the most deceptive teaching in the world it'll be in the message of the hour that will be matthew 24 24. that'll be so close to the scene they're very elected right mm-hmm is trinity gonna is that gonna fool anyone no sir but jesse we could just say youtube hey but jesse's sermons videos there on trinity seven problems trinity that's not going to deceive us no sir not even close good that's right but what about some of these message doctrines that are coming up right jesse's teaching are those those are a lot more closer of deceiving message people or people that hurt that's going to be way more deceptive why because we've heard the true word we understand those things yeah now my intellection by intellect is good we can understand those things we can teach those things by internet absolutely but it becomes to come to a time where it's revelation yes where it cannot be untaught right that's right right we know people yeah who are right there with us sister this is the original sin is amazing okay the king was not of the god first john three and 20. and they taught serpenty their entire for 20 years right brother right in a matter of one year they cannot see it was that intellect or was that revelation that's right right because by natural just by basic intellect into intelligence and by looking at it with an honest heart even honest i'll say it like that without his heart looking at it saying wow that's right right identifying that is right but did he really did the catch hole deep down right brother but jesse can you defend certain absolutely absolutely the male guy can you defend service team absolutely and if you can't you can come to me we'll stand right in front of you even they'll look at you because you're taller than me and still be able to see you but i'll be right there with my with the word drawn ready to go that's right amen but remember there will be more false then there will be true yes corinthians paul said he says there is right now more teaching false than there are truths yes yes amen i was just on youtube just you know things come up on your feet and and a brother was over here some not not message just a christian was trying to defend it uh two hollywood stars they broke up and they're married and how he needs to go back here they need to get back together this this and i'm thinking this lady here has already been married four times and he said by scripture they're supposed to i was like dude she if anyone she should be gathered back to her first husband right but they're just abs and everybody's everybody's all great great great study brother good blah blah blah blah great phenomenal completely blind right brother right completely void of the understanding of the word of god yes sir amen now in isaiah 54 1 it says he says for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the mary wife saith the lord there's going to be so many more tears in this hour that's why it's going to be so dark right right brother the bible talks about what a famine in the land for what the hearing of the word of god that's [Music] but notice in matthew 13 verse 24 another parable he put forth on him saying the kingdom of heaven is lightened to a man which showed good seed in his field but notice this is a kingdom of heaven is lagging unto a man which showed good seeing his feelings but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tears with wheat so this revelation while men slept must be a new testament revelation right what is the sleeping when they pass on that's right yes yes so when the new testament apostles peter james john matthew phillip all these stephen stone as they would fall asleep he said then what the tares then would come in but what would terrors do what do terrors do what was the nicknames in the clintons this is what this is what broke up the spirit of god among remember the anointed the brotherhood everybody's dwelling in unity everybody is in love with one another oh and a great sister with a great brother oh brother is there anything i can do for you today god and what that's what god wanted to see in heaven amen with the holy ghost amen yes one by one the pillars in the church would pass and fall asleep and the ones who had the full revelation of what divine love is among ones another one another as they would fall asleep the antichrist fear would come in and start polluting the true church of god see watch out for your brother and now i planted something in her mind all right and now he would separate from him and that displeases the holy ghost and the holy spirit starts lifting all right instead of sister lydia saying brother you shouldn't say that moment you better have some proof but what what was she doing she had the holy ghost which i believe she knew she'd say she would go immediately say brother are you are you serious and she'll go and confront her say hey is what he's saying true of course it's not true they can be brother and sister it is a separation of the people of god it is it is aiming the sons of god the daughters of god against each other right right because remember when this thing comes prophesied that what the children of god will be able to discern the true spirits within the framework that's it amen yes we are going to pick up it is and then what the prophet is only the holy ghost field would be able to detect that there's a quote they will only that's right these things amen amen yes that's absolutely the truth right now i don't know how long i've helped you but i want to i want to maybe list an ending here let me jump let me jump to this uh can you hook me up onto the old uh saints of god jesse just said you guys have been in the assembly here your pastor has sent out thousands of invitations coming to hear the original seed that word of god that was preached from the beginning he has sent out seeds like a soul and these scenes have fallen upon every the exact same kind of grounds that was prophesied right right and we know we're at the coming lord and literally this is all right now that we know they've heard the word of god and god has what added to his church daily in this area yes and we are the same in the point what well we're just a small little tiny church does god really love us this is this absolutely amazing hallelujah you are the apple of his eye you are the you're the reason these scenes were was amen there you go you are the ones that this is going to produce the exact same thing no other angle no other age was given the restoration luther did not get this restoration that's right right give me the part of it wesley did not get this restoration all right so it was a part of it another move the true move of god pentecostalism of god they did not get the restoration of the word right we were given it what is that showing he's back to planting seeds again so what's going to prove all the things is literally election now jesus is back for the last 50 60 70 years planting the same seed that was in the beginning and as all those who can receive the word of god because what god has to prepare our hearts yes when i was in college i was an atheist i was science teacher they switched me in one year from semi-christian believing god baptized right before you to an atheist four years believing not in god i was going to be scientists this evolution evolution evolution science evolution papers and then god had the break and then he started preparing my heart started getting why did he pull them thorns out why did he take out the stonyness of my heart why why did he give me a little bit more dirt than being thin on top yeah he prepared the heart for the seed amen for the seed now look back into your lives look what you once were what did you what did you have to go through before you heard the word of god he had to get to the point where you are hungry for the word of god where you were like lord show me the truth yes i was the god sends the exact same scene as he connects to back to what you amen yes to produce hallelujah what they produce back there that's right amen will it well brother i don't see a hundred fold yet it doesn't matter it said it would produce it amen now in closing we're gonna do a little family history is that okay it might be a little personal here for some but uh [Music] i'm going to tell you a story in closing now notice here whosoever was born of god did not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him who is his seed for his seed remains in him that's god's own life that's the holy ghost in you remaining there and god only sees that that's right not this if you receive the holy ghost you can he cannot sin because he is born of god but god no no think of this in the spiritual god's looking your life but what does he see first he sees this fail he sees his body with six thousand years worth of sin compiled like bank interest right in here nothing but filth there is no there's nothing sound in this flesh and he's able to look past all that amazing he's able to pass your flesh what this does guess what he gets to the next chamber and looks at your spirit realm and all the filthy things you have seen in your memory affections that are not correct ideas conscience all those things filthy and yet in that darkness he can still look past that that's right and all you can see then is your seat amen amen yes hallelujah thank you [Applause] and he looks through all those chords those two chords and find this and he fast he says what sinless that's right glory so how hard is this rapture when this thing goes haywire in the u.s and the world and we're right on the brink and darkness and judgment set the doors shut and it is black no salvation how is god gonna find you how is he gonna know where you are now let me tell you a story right here in closing this is the original study right here okay that's right okay glory sister lean this kind of okay i'm gonna tell the story this comes from my family here okay you know what this good looking guy is right here great great no this is my great grandpa go chuckster smith and lena smith that's my that's my great grandma great great baby look pretty good i mean they dressed up whatever occasion this is okay but he was a worker okay you know what he was he's a farmer my great-grandpa early 1900s was a farmer he's gathering the wheat in okay do you see any you see any weeds here any tears nothing but wheat you know what that is that's my grandpa frank smith my great grandpa was a master wheat farmer he knew how to set the rose and he was a farmer and he only planted wheat notice we just love the pups right flying live or something that's my grandpa grandpa frank now as time would go on in america less and less farming became less and less gave you the sustainability to live and to prosper okay my grandpa frank not one did he farm and my dad said he was a good farmer but he had to do stuff on the side he built houses and sold him he took land and built houses and sold them he did rentals and those things so he had to farm and work on the side just to make things made to make things pay his bills now his son was my dad but jesse's dad and my dad was a baby the baby of the family and by the time time my dad grew up my grandpa my grandpa had already quit farming because he was older and he went to work in a factory so my dad never learned how to farm properly okay i don't know if jesse remembers this but my dad working at gm he had a dream and he knew a farmer i can't remember his name right now but and my dad would drive by this farmer and one time he was driving by in the farmer that he lived by an old gate there he was parked on the side of the road and he seen him out walking and there was one weed in his field and my dad waited for him to come up gertzweiler henry getzweil he said henry why did you walk out in that field to get that one weed and he said snook he said if i don't get if i don't find out what kind of weed this is because he said by next year if i don't find the right concoction of pesticide to kill this one weed by next year that thing will be all through this and my dad said and this man henry gersheiler he bought he built five farms for each one of his sons and he was able to give him a farm to each one of his sons and they're all now farmers and home beach still very wise man now my dad though he came from a long line of farmers was not taught how to farm correctly and my dad had that same dream as well you can tell but jesse and me i've always wanted to be a farmer and he always he watches right now if you go to his house you get on his iphone his iphone is nothing but farm videos from the one with the steel tractor tires it's the big big bud spent some time with my dad wow and my dad had a dream one time because we're going to gm not a dream but he had he ended up he wanted to do the same thing henry gertzweiler did for his boys he wanted to give us each a farm and he went and bought an old raggedy house with about 10 acres and i remember going in bro jess i don't know if you remember going to that house he took us to this really beat up house i remember looking in i'm just going and my mom was not happy because i watched your face and he's like ruby we're gonna move here we're gonna set this we're gonna get this farm going this and that and i'm just like well my dad worked at gm after work he would go farming and i planted my dad planted only wheat but he was not a very good farmer because he did not have training and by the time it came for harvest he looked into his field and he couldn't find he couldn't see any wheat there was so many weeds now my dad was very poor or he did not have a combine so he had to pay he brought another farmer up and said hey could you combine this for me and the other farmer gets up there and he's like are you sure there's something in there are you sure there's any wheat and my dad said there's wheat in there will you harvest harvest it for me in the paint mops and the guy said i'll do it he says are you sure i don't waste my time dad said there's wheat in there farmer got on his combine and as he was going through all that field guess what he had of all those weeds there was still wheat in there amen one farmer could not see anything good in that field there was so many false impersonational seeds in that field right because my dad was not the best farmer now jesus christ is a tremendous farmer right but i'll tell you what when he leaves his own children there to keep the field and they quit leaning on god and go to their own wisdom they became bad farmers and they let the tares come on in right and 2 000 years as christ would send the reapers in good master are you sure there's wheat in there we're right at the end of laodicea jesus is there your children still there all right amen combines boys because there's a weed in there [Applause] right nothing but serpent seed all around you nothing but tears all around you and he's going to send his reapers in yes that's right and let me say like this he actually separates at that time it's okay to separate the wheat from the tares because when all these tears are bundled he can stand out and say right there's my wheat right there that's right amen amen amen god knows the bible says what he has this seal yes nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure yeah having this seal the notice the lord knows them that are his thanks to god amen might be a church that is so small the only one standing for the true word of god in this area right even accurate however by the natural eye someone could say a christian i'll say a real holy ghost christian from germany from russia from wherever fly right here and say there ain't no seat here [Applause] hallelujah glory remember you are the wheat god every small detail about your life is watching amen we can get in communion real yes communion with him your very harsh desires will be fulfilled hallelujah hallelujah he promised he said yes and as this darkness continues to get darker and darker saints of god this will get brighter yes hallelujah they remember something we never thought we would ever see you today ten years ago that's right where they'd be teaching boys to be girls and girls will be boys that's right never thought we see that day what if god gives us 10 more right what are we going to see boys robots girls are robots blending machinery with what's next saints of god this will give us the answers hallelujah and if we ask the holy ghost to lead us and show us in the word and i'll say like this the most important thing right now is refilling after refilling if they had the if they had acts 2 and what a couple days later they needed a refilling what about today in a darker hour compared to 2 000 years ago this is a very serious check of time i'm feeling god helpless hallelujah but just remember all three generations of my line there they all wanted to see they planted seed they wanted the best hallelujah and we not might not be the best right now about farming but we are going to be at the end we're going to show we're going to be able to produce the wheat hallelujah what is in that seed gene will come out because remember that's that sea gene has been joined now to his seed which is the holy ghost and that holy ghost will quicken it will perform at its given time yes it is alive so let's bow our heads
