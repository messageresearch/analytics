[3:09] god be glorified and magnified in jesus
[3:11] christ's name and the saint said
[3:13] amen god bless you as you're being
[3:15] seated praise god
[3:19] i do have some slides here
[3:20] [Music]
[3:25] i kind of have something to uh
[3:28] just say publicly here
[3:31] since it's on live stream
[3:32] you know after uh that debate in 2020
[3:35] with believe the sign
[3:37] um i preached on the debate and uh
[3:40] i said a few things wrong i think
[3:42] there's just one thing wrong that i said
[3:43] i shouldn't say a few i think there's
[3:44] one thing wrong i said so i'm going to
[3:46] issue a public apology
[3:48] to brother rod
[3:50] when i preached it here i said that
[3:52] he believed it was acceptable for
[3:55] homosexuality
[3:57] and
[3:58] other abominations and apparently he
[4:00] didn't believe that so i misunderstood
[4:02] that so if i say something publicly
[4:04] that's wrong
[4:06] i'm gonna apologize so my my precious
[4:08] brother rod
[4:09] uh please forgive me that's the one
[4:10] mistake i
[4:11] i've come to know that i'm wrong on
[4:14] and uh i hope you accept my apology sir
[4:18] so uh thank you for that uh church you
[4:20] know if i say something wrong publicly i
[4:22] like to
[4:23] correct it publicly
[4:25] now there was numerous things you know
[4:28] that the other side i'm not going to say
[4:30] that man's name but there's numerous
[4:32] things the other side have said wrong
[4:33] about me i haven't reached out to them
[4:35] yet but i will i have a list of nine
[4:37] things they've said wrong about me so i
[4:39] hope i get apology back if not the love
[4:41] of jesus christ covers over all that
[4:43] so i just want to issue that apology
[4:45] there publicly and i'll make sure i
[4:47] share this with
[4:48] our brother rod
[4:50] also uh church uh
[4:52] you know
[4:54] i just want to now
[4:55] kind of go into a little bit of a
[4:59] uh i guess you'd say battle mode
[5:02] with that other side because there's
[5:04] still a battle going on and i say that
[5:06] with kindness
[5:08] it's come to my attention of course and
[5:09] i knew this but uh come to my attention
[5:12] that uh
[5:13] there's at least one person probably
[5:15] more
[5:16] watches all of our sermons just to find
[5:18] things that i say
[5:19] about uh the side that i debated
[5:22] the people that i call them accusers of
[5:24] brother branham because they're accusing
[5:25] him
[5:26] uh falsely in my opinion
[5:29] and they would probably call me the same
[5:30] thing i'm accusing them or something so
[5:33] uh but that one's have to agree to
[5:34] disagree on those
[5:36] anyways uh
[5:38] to the and i'm just gonna call them
[5:40] spies because that's what i feel like
[5:41] the bible calls them
[5:45] to the man who's watching as a spy
[5:48] uh
[5:49] just know that i prayed for you today
[5:52] and i hope you get saved if you're not
[5:54] saved
[5:55] and if you're not sanctified i hope you
[5:57] get sanctified by the holy ghost
[5:59] and i hope you get filled with the
[6:00] baptism of the holy ghost
[6:02] and i would just say to this gentleman
[6:05] eventually get to at the end of the
[6:06] sermon
[6:08] but i hope sir
[6:09] that you will reach out to me and
[6:12] contact me if you have any questions
[6:14] please don't be afraid to do that i'm a
[6:16] very gentle person a very
[6:19] friendly person
[6:21] and so please reach out to me please
[6:23] don't go to other people if you have
[6:24] concerns about me please come to me
[6:27] there's nothing to be afraid of
[6:29] uh we can talk to it we can talk about
[6:30] it like gentlemen but keep listening sir
[6:32] and if he's not like i hope like i said
[6:34] if he's not saved i hope he gets saved
[6:35] during the sermon by god's grace
[6:37] so praise the lord the bible calls them
[6:39] spies when they uh they come in amongst
[6:41] you
[6:42] and try to
[6:44] uh find fault with you so uh
[6:47] now one thing's for sure church i'm a
[6:49] i'm a human so if they look long enough
[6:52] they're gonna find a fault with me but i
[6:54] wish if they'd find it they'd come talk
[6:55] to me about it that's what i did
[6:57] recently remember there was a sermon i
[6:58] listened to at a certain church i found
[7:01] at least 24 24 heirs in that
[7:04] i went to the pastor about the heirs and
[7:06] then i went to the preacher the guest
[7:07] preacher who preached it and that's what
[7:09] we should do jesus said if somebody
[7:11] offends you you go to them
[7:14] so to this dear man watching if he's
[7:16] still watching maybe to turn it off i
[7:18] don't know
[7:19] but if he's watching if you have left a
[7:21] message and you think you have more love
[7:23] and you're more free than ever before
[7:25] then please follow the words of jesus
[7:27] christ
[7:28] and come talk to me i'll be happy to
[7:30] come talk to you on the phone i'll be
[7:31] happy to talk to you in the email or
[7:34] text
[7:35] so thank you
[7:36] now i wanna uh with that said thank you
[7:39] church you know some of these things are
[7:40] public so i have to if i make a public
[7:42] mistake i just need to publicly
[7:43] apologize
[7:44] and i always want to be that way i never
[7:46] want to get to the spot where uh i can't
[7:48] humble myself and say i'm sorry if i
[7:49] make a mistake
[7:52] now church that's just a review remember
[7:54] church we were looking at the last
[7:57] three sermons is that we can see in the
[7:59] old testament a rise and fall of
[8:02] spirituality in the old testament kings
[8:05] of israel
[8:06] we see a great rising and falling just
[8:08] like we do in the church ages
[8:10] praise god in the in the church ages
[8:13] you know we see how how god started with
[8:15] a one person god right but then in the
[8:17] in the in the second church age the
[8:20] third church age they adopted a trinity
[8:22] we can already see how the church is
[8:23] starting to fall away from many uh some
[8:25] of the truths
[8:26] um
[8:28] and then as it goes on you know more and
[8:30] more teachings are
[8:32] are lost and then the the third tier in
[8:34] age you know it was only columba and his
[8:36] uh missionary friends i shouldn't say
[8:38] only it was very few uh believers
[8:40] actually in this about it's almost a
[8:42] thousand years it's like satan's
[8:44] millennium right
[8:45] of church ages but then martin luther
[8:47] started restoring justification praise
[8:49] god
[8:49] and of course we know he was born again
[8:51] yet have the baptism of the holy ghost
[8:53] to be a fire in the hand of jesus but
[8:55] his main message was justification and
[8:57] then god started restoring
[8:59] holiness you know through john wesley
[9:04] and then through brother branham's
[9:05] message he finished the mystery of god
[9:08] and turned was able to turn our hearts
[9:10] back to the apostolic fathers where now
[9:12] we don't have creeds like martin luther
[9:15] we don't have creeds like john wesley
[9:17] now we have bible faith
[9:20] praise god and our hearts are turned
[9:22] back to the bible praise god
[9:24] and so
[9:25] as we saw we saw a lot of rising and
[9:28] falling solomon rose but then he fell
[9:32] a few kings later jehoshaphat restored
[9:34] him back
[9:35] right
[9:36] but then a few generations go by a few
[9:38] bad kings they fall again god raises up
[9:41] a usaid who gives at least 50 years of
[9:43] ministry
[9:44] right
[9:45] uh integrity walking before the lord
[9:48] well he fought after his generation he
[9:50] fell away at the end of his life but of
[9:52] course he was saved we believe
[9:53] a couple of kings bad kings and then god
[9:56] raised up by hezekiah amen
[9:58] after him though
[10:00] some sinners come in right they're not
[10:01] godly kings then god has to do another
[10:04] revival josiah praise god
[10:07] more generations come and go and god has
[10:09] to send them back the yeah actually a
[10:11] few generations after josiah they leave
[10:14] the promised land god scatters them and
[10:16] then god has to send them back through
[10:18] zerubbabel ezra and nehemiah praise god
[10:22] and then they're there for 400 years
[10:24] without a prophet until god raises up
[10:26] john the baptist can i say that this the
[10:28] greatest man in the old testament
[10:31] you say brother jess that's a strange
[10:32] statement that's what jesus said
[10:35] he said
[10:36] he said john is the greatest one that's
[10:38] risen out of all men to this point he
[10:40] said but i say unto you those in the
[10:41] kingdom of god are greater than john the
[10:43] baptist
[10:45] because it's a testimony of the blood of
[10:47] jesus christ amen it magnifies the blood
[10:50] of jesus christ
[10:53] hallelujah
[10:55] and so i hope church you can see that
[10:57] there was a great rising farm remember
[10:59] there's a great missionary age in the
[11:00] days of john wesley that hasn't been
[11:02] accomplished to this day
[11:04] it was the greatest open door age there
[11:06] had ever been praise god the most number
[11:09] of missionaries the greatest number of
[11:10] miles traveled
[11:11] and the greatest number of souls say
[11:13] that man age of wesley's age
[11:16] so we can see that how many can see some
[11:18] trends here by god's grace i think i
[11:21] think it's without a doubt i can see at
[11:23] least four messengers that are clearly
[11:25] tight i'm sorry that are types of the
[11:27] anti-type that came later in the church
[11:30] ages praise god
[11:32] now we left off on sunday the first
[11:34] service with the laodicean church age
[11:38] all right
[11:40] so uh our we know the messenger was
[11:42] brother branham no doubt 1909 to 1965.
[11:47] his message was zealous repentance
[11:52] and it uh and the message was to it was
[11:54] to produce a hot experience that
[11:57] overcomes lukewarmness
[12:00] lukewarmness is sometimes hot
[12:02] sometimes cold
[12:04] in other words uh anointed prayer
[12:06] services and then the depths of sin
[12:09] right cuss and swear and drunkenness
[12:12] idolatry perversion you know
[12:14] great anointing shouting singing and
[12:16] then other sexual sin we'll say like
[12:18] that you know just other sins
[12:20] you know just wickedness you know
[12:22] uh
[12:23] you can just name whatever you want you
[12:24] know
[12:26] but that's what lukewarm is it's back
[12:28] and forth right back and forth but the
[12:30] bible jesus says that a believer abides
[12:32] in christ
[12:34] you must abide in the word praise god
[12:36] and then when you abide in the word he
[12:38] said ask that you will and it'll be done
[12:40] praise god now it's not that we order
[12:42] god around but god is more likely to
[12:45] hear our prayers when we're abiding in
[12:47] the word of god amen
[12:50] now the type of this was john the
[12:52] baptist he came at a very lukewarm time
[12:55] a very cold time where they hadn't had a
[12:57] prophet for 400 years right
[12:59] his ministry was only six months i love
[13:01] that quote by the man says he said
[13:03] sometimes god will train a man for years
[13:06] just to get six months of ministry out
[13:08] of him
[13:09] hallelujah church don't be discouraged
[13:11] sometimes god will tell you for years
[13:13] just to use you for a few months praise
[13:15] god
[13:16] don't ever let that be a small thing it
[13:18] was a great thing remember nobody was
[13:20] greater than john the baptist before him
[13:23] because everybody else just talked about
[13:25] jesus but john the baptist baptized
[13:27] jesus amen he handled jesus amen i don't
[13:31] know you tweeted the people there he is
[13:33] the lamb of god who takes away the sin
[13:35] of the world
[13:37] and he could point off himself and point
[13:40] to the reality it wasn't a partial
[13:42] realization it was a perfect realization
[13:45] amen
[13:46] everybody else was just you know
[13:47] partially painting and types but john
[13:50] the baptist pointed to the perfect
[13:51] realization he pointed to the word made
[13:54] flesh
[13:56] and his message was turning the hearts
[14:00] of the fathers to the children
[14:03] and that's what john the baptist did he
[14:06] said behold the lamb of god who takes
[14:08] away the sin of the world follow ye him
[14:11] amen
[14:13] so we can clearly see church that
[14:14] there's a great correlation here and
[14:17] both men have the spirit of elijah
[14:20] now let me read a few pages here
[14:22] from my book i was actually looking at
[14:23] it this morning
[14:25] i'm almost done with the audio book
[14:26] hopefully i'll be done by saturday but
[14:28] let's look at some of the similarities
[14:29] if you don't quite remember
[14:31] i think it's good to review these here
[14:33] 762.
[14:36] it's always good to talk about the
[14:37] things of the lord
[14:39] how is john the baptist like brother
[14:41] branham or vice versa
[14:44] both all the elijah spoke with thus
[14:46] saith the lord
[14:48] uh elijah said thus saith the lord he
[14:51] prophesied of
[14:53] haziah's demise in second kings
[14:56] 1 verses 1 to 18.
[15:00] john the baptist the word of the lord
[15:02] came to john the baptist in the
[15:03] wilderness whereby he foretold jesus
[15:06] would take away the sins of the world
[15:08] and baptize with the holy ghost amen did
[15:10] you know that judge john the baptist
[15:12] prophesied about the day of pentecost
[15:15] amen
[15:16] he prophesied about it and it happened
[15:19] because he had the word of the lord
[15:23] and there's 30 times in this book that i
[15:26] showed brother branham spoke with
[15:27] blessed alone there's at least 30 thus
[15:30] saith the lords in this book
[15:32] some of the most impressive ones were
[15:34] the time he he spoke thus saith the lord
[15:36] a sister would die
[15:37] a sister should care and that was just
[15:39] like a hazard
[15:40] i can never say that name a haziah's
[15:43] demise both men spoke thus said the lord
[15:45] a person would die
[15:47] now of course remember with sister uh
[15:49] sister shakira in church
[15:51] people say it wasn't a big thing to
[15:52] predict her death because she had cancer
[15:54] well that's true
[15:55] but the reason it was a big thing was
[15:57] because all of uh sister shakarian's
[15:59] preacher friends had already said thus
[16:01] saith the lord she was gonna live
[16:04] so brother abraham comes after the
[16:05] thought after all these prophecies and
[16:07] his prophecy goes against all the famous
[16:09] preachers
[16:11] so who was right was it the famous
[16:13] preachers did she live or was the was
[16:14] the prophet of god right we know the
[16:17] prophet of god was right
[16:19] okay also brother and prophesied sister
[16:22] humes would live and she did
[16:24] she lived 40 years after being here to
[16:26] tuberculosis had 25 uh uh great i'm
[16:30] sorry 25 grandchildren 40
[16:32] great-grandchildren
[16:33] and brother said you go away yourself
[16:35] and two mondays in a row he said and see
[16:38] if i haven't told you what has come to
[16:39] pass see if i haven't told you that's
[16:41] the truth
[16:42] amen program said no denomination will
[16:45] ever come back to the apostolic doctrine
[16:47] that's thus saith the lord amen and
[16:49] we've seen it no denomination has ever
[16:51] come back they just float further and
[16:54] further away
[16:55] but said thus saith the lord about the
[16:57] vision of the american churches and look
[17:00] how she's so immoral look how she's in
[17:02] sexy clothes right the panic also is
[17:04] probably the worst of all of them
[17:06] right uh the churches i visited they
[17:08] were probably the worst dressed ones
[17:09] in fact the orthodox catholic were
[17:11] probably the best dressed ones because a
[17:12] lot of them had skirts on
[17:14] i think i forgot to say that william
[17:15] could tell you that the one that had all
[17:17] the idols out in the of the lobby for
[17:19] sale their women were actually the most
[17:21] modest dresser other than the apostolic
[17:24] church we went to
[17:27] so
[17:28] brother mary spoke numerous thus saith
[17:30] the lords that have come to pass
[17:33] of course the other side won't recognize
[17:35] them because they won't recognize truth
[17:37] and that's fine they're entitled to
[17:39] their own opinion
[17:41] so brother man was like john the baptist
[17:43] that he spoke with thus saith the lord
[17:44] they both saw visions
[17:46] and they both spoke with us saith the
[17:48] lord second
[17:50] the bible says
[17:51] they all
[17:52] were set apart and opposed the popular
[17:54] religious organizations of their day
[17:57] right
[17:58] elijah rebuked ahab and jezebel
[18:02] john the baptist rebuked herod and
[18:04] herodias brother branham rebuked jfk and
[18:07] jackie kennedy
[18:09] right
[18:10] so each man rebuked them and then each
[18:13] man rebuked denominations of their day
[18:16] right elijah rebuked the baal prophets
[18:19] uh john the baptist called he called the
[18:21] clergy generation of vipers are you
[18:23] sometimes you think i'm rough how about
[18:24] that i've ever called them a bunch of
[18:26] snakes i haven't done that yet but if
[18:28] the holy ghost comes upon me i gotta
[18:30] obey the holy ghost
[18:34] and then brother braham said today i
[18:36] indict this bunch of ministers
[18:38] they are crucified to the people the
[18:40] very god they claim to love and serve i
[18:42] invite these ministers in the name of
[18:44] lord jesus upon their what their
[18:46] doctrine
[18:48] church don't we know how important
[18:49] doctrine is
[18:51] false doctrine it makes these men today
[18:54] indicted which means they're guilty
[18:57] they're going to be guilty on the day of
[18:58] judgment
[19:00] for crucifying the lord jesus saying the
[19:03] days of miracles pass the water baptism
[19:05] in the name of lord jesus christ is not
[19:06] sufficient and not right upon any of
[19:09] these words they've substituted creed
[19:11] for
[19:12] i indict them as guilty in the blood of
[19:14] jesus christ upon their hands for
[19:16] crucifying the flesh the lord jesus the
[19:19] second time they're crucifying christ to
[19:21] the public taking them from the thing
[19:23] they're supposed to be given to them
[19:25] and they substitute something else in
[19:27] this place a church for creed listen for
[19:29] popularity
[19:31] isn't that exactly right most churches
[19:33] want to be big and popular so they want
[19:35] prince will by their doctrine they won't
[19:37] preach bride doctrine they'll preach
[19:38] foolish virgin doctrine
[19:40] or maybe mother harlot doctrine
[19:43] right or maybe a
[19:46] protestant daughter doctrine amen
[19:48] they'll preach that because they just
[19:50] want to be popular i'm so glad we're so
[19:52] far removed from being popular
[19:55] we have no cares to be popular we just
[19:57] want heaven to know us amen
[20:00] we just want the devil to be able to say
[20:01] paul i know
[20:02] uh peter i know jesus i know and i know
[20:06] sister smith amen and i know brother
[20:08] smith and i know sister naomi and
[20:10] brother william and they all
[20:12] that's what we want we want hell to
[20:14] recognize that jesus christ is in our
[20:17] lives amen
[20:18] that's the popularity we want amen it's
[20:20] not even popularity it's just power and
[20:22] authority
[20:25] third
[20:26] they condemned immoral women i kind of
[20:28] named this earlier uh
[20:30] jezebel
[20:32] herodias and brother and marilyn monroe
[20:35] and jackie kennedy i quote he said
[20:37] brother said i don't want you influenced
[20:38] by marilyn monroe i want you influenced
[20:40] by jesus christ see by his word he's the
[20:43] word if the word they influence you then
[20:45] christ can't because he is the word amen
[20:48] he rebuked jackie kennedy i said a hard
[20:50] thing about mrs kennedy a couple times
[20:52] about her setting passions for the world
[20:54] these waterhead haircuts our sisters and
[20:56] then the haircuts
[20:58] and dressed like mrs kennedy i said like
[21:00] a jezebel of old that's true
[21:04] think about that through her fashion she
[21:06] calls them to cut their hair wear makeup
[21:08] wear high heels and also say hail mary's
[21:12] praise god that's interceding with the
[21:14] dead so see that's why that
[21:17] denominational spirit's a slippery slope
[21:19] once you get them in there with the
[21:21] outward things it's just a real easy
[21:22] thing to get into praying to the dead
[21:25] interceding with demons right
[21:27] it's a very easy thing to fall into if
[21:30] people aren't careful
[21:32] now i heard today one preacher i've been
[21:33] listening to podcasts one preacher who's
[21:35] left the message now says he says the
[21:37] roman catholic church isn't the mother
[21:39] harlot then who in the world is
[21:43] so now if that means she's not well then
[21:45] now he can open his arms and accept the
[21:47] roman catholic church come on in mother
[21:49] harlot come on in go ahead i'll ride the
[21:51] beast with you right
[21:54] see how blind these people are at times
[21:56] if they're not careful
[21:59] fourth they were men of the wilderness
[22:01] right elijah was from gilead a
[22:03] mountainous region near river jordan he
[22:06] spent time at the brook sheriff fed by
[22:08] ravens he rested in the juniper tree and
[22:10] he dwelt alone in the cave hearing god's
[22:12] voice this man this man was always out
[22:14] in the wilderness amen john the baptist
[22:16] drunk awareness from about 12 to 30
[22:19] right or maybe 9 to 30 depending on who
[22:21] you talk to he ate locusts and honey and
[22:24] wore camel's hair as a preaching outfit
[22:28] they managed to spend most of his free
[22:29] time in the woods awareness to refresh
[22:32] his mind and body because the gift of
[22:33] discernment would sap
[22:35] his spirit right his human spirit and
[22:38] his physical strength just like daniel
[22:40] experienced in daniel chapter 8 26 and
[22:43] 27 let's read that daniel 8 26 it's
[22:46] probably been a long time since we read
[22:47] it
[22:49] it's been years since we read this
[22:51] daniel 8 26-27
[22:58] church you can go online just type in
[23:00] looking for some of the man's friends
[23:02] every one of them said that brother ram
[23:03] would be talking to them and in the
[23:05] midst of a conversation his eyes would
[23:07] kind of gloss over and he would look off
[23:09] and see a vision and come back
[23:11] every one of them say that
[23:13] and they would tell he would tell them
[23:15] secrets of their lives and these men are
[23:16] crying they're weeping it was a real
[23:18] prophet of god but each time they did
[23:20] that church it was a physical drain on
[23:23] no wonder he could remember some of the
[23:24] details
[23:25] you could ask my wife i forget tons of
[23:27] details probably been preaching 15 years
[23:30] and i don't go in visions every day all
[23:32] day
[23:34] how much more brother and be physically
[23:36] sapped
[23:37] his mental uh energy
[23:39] sap from all these visions
[23:43] daniel 8 26 27
[23:46] and the vision of the evening in the
[23:47] morning which was told is true wherefore
[23:50] shut thou up the vision for it shall be
[23:52] for many days and i daniel fainted and
[23:54] with six certain days after when i rose
[23:56] up and did the king's business and i was
[23:58] astonished at division but none
[24:00] understood it
[24:03] so it was more than one day
[24:06] one vision
[24:08] knocked him out for more than one day of
[24:10] course this was a major vision
[24:13] right think about writing the entire
[24:15] chapter can you imagine seeing a vision
[24:17] where you could write a chapter for it
[24:18] afterwards
[24:20] this is a major holy ghost anointed
[24:23] vision
[24:24] and so he was sick for two days
[24:26] afterwards
[24:28] so see church sometimes people don't
[24:30] realize these things but we do they had
[24:33] to be men of the wilderness
[24:36] but abraham said he really went out to
[24:38] the woods to see god and rest he said i
[24:41] think god is there
[24:43] he said uh to see him and how he moves
[24:47] so if you go out long enough in nature
[24:49] on the woods or by the river by the lake
[24:51] pretty soon you'll see how god moves
[24:54] amen
[24:56] lastly so here's the fifth one
[24:58] all the men battled the sin nature when
[25:01] they were not under the holy ghost
[25:02] anointing them in their minds
[25:05] elijah fled to the wilderness off a
[25:08] threat of one threat from jezebel and he
[25:10] just slain over 450 prophets
[25:13] he just saw a fire fall down from heaven
[25:15] but when that anointing left he ran
[25:17] afraid of the woman
[25:19] of course in her her uh you know
[25:21] soldiers right
[25:22] that makes sense but
[25:24] why would he run when he saw god bring
[25:26] fire down see because the anointing left
[25:30] john the baptist saw that and the
[25:33] the holy ghost is sent like a dove
[25:35] but then when he was in prison he said
[25:37] go ask jesus is he the messiah or should
[25:39] we look for another
[25:41] he'd already said
[25:42] that he'll baptize you with the holy
[25:44] ghost and fire now he's word is he the
[25:46] one or do i look for another
[25:50] brother abraham under the holy spirit
[25:52] said this and that you might know i be
[25:55] god's prophet his spirit is all me here
[25:57] now you also have a condition of the
[26:00] colon and bowel
[26:01] so broman numerous times said i'm god's
[26:03] prophet but when the anointing left look
[26:06] what he says
[26:07] he says
[26:09] many people regard me as a prophet i
[26:11] don't regard myself that no sir i don't
[26:13] say that to be humble i say that to be
[26:15] truthful
[26:17] i do not regard myself to be a prophet
[26:19] the lord i haven't that honor
[26:22] now look under the anointing if you i'm
[26:24] god's prophet i'm telling you you've got
[26:25] this trouble this trouble but when the
[26:27] anointing leaves he says on me
[26:29] i don't call myself a prophet
[26:33] hallelujah
[26:35] the teacher see what the see what the
[26:37] anointing does church the anointing
[26:39] makes us so bold the anointing makes us
[26:41] so sure but if
[26:44] if that anointing leaves our mind what
[26:46] happens we become afraid
[26:49] we question things we doubt and the
[26:50] church said
[26:52] you'll be so happy in church right you
[26:54] feel like god's speaking to you you feel
[26:56] like god spoke through brother briggs a
[26:57] brother can but then a few weeks later
[27:00] what happened to our faith it's just a
[27:01] battle we've got to go through
[27:03] but the bible said you got to stir up
[27:05] your mind by way of remembrance amen got
[27:08] to go back to that first level
[27:13] now
[27:14] do you remember this gentleman
[27:16] now god rest his soul i hope he's saved
[27:18] i don't know but i hope he said
[27:21] he claimed to be elijah in 2015.
[27:25] his name was tony palmer is so sad uh a
[27:28] year after this 2016 he died in a
[27:31] motorcycle accident
[27:33] but he said he came in the spirit of
[27:35] elijah he's the catholic priest he came
[27:37] in the spirit elijah to unite the
[27:39] protestants and this is the man that
[27:40] remember i showed you all those false
[27:42] prophet sermons this was the man that
[27:43] cursed covenant and said it was going to
[27:44] go away didn't go away this man
[27:47] he has a lot of problems
[27:49] but
[27:50] he was said i'm elijah to anoint
[27:52] protestants with catholic
[27:55] and then died a year later now i'm not
[27:58] saying it was god's judgment i don't
[27:59] know only god knows
[28:01] but also i'm saying is that brother
[28:02] brandon said he had the spirit of elijah
[28:04] and he rebuked catholicism with thus
[28:06] saith the lord and he warned the people
[28:08] not to unite with catholicism with thus
[28:11] saith the lord
[28:12] but then another man comes along and
[28:14] says i've got this blue elijah you need
[28:16] to uh you need to unite with uh the
[28:19] catholic
[28:20] the catholics
[28:21] well which one's right whichever one's
[28:23] right with the word amen
[28:26] right and this man says uh he said he
[28:29] said doctrines don't matter he said god
[28:30] work it out when we get there that's a
[28:32] beaufort that's a bold-faced lie
[28:35] doctrine is i just read it doctrine is
[28:37] many times what separates the true
[28:38] believer from the false believer
[28:41] that's what usually separates it because
[28:43] both sides have anointing for miracles
[28:45] at times right
[28:47] both sides can have miracles so a
[28:49] miracle doesn't prove someone saved
[28:51] america will prove they've gotten the
[28:52] right anointing and god bless their
[28:54] anointing god bless their sincerity but
[28:57] that doesn't mean they're saved because
[28:59] these guys have miracles too he was
[29:00] talking about miracles this guy says
[29:01] they have miracles but yet they teach
[29:03] all kinds of blasphemous things
[29:07] okay so i just thought i'd remind you of
[29:09] that that we had a prophet who gave us
[29:11] thus saith the lord against catholicism
[29:15] and that's what we're standing on
[29:16] because we can see all the bible errors
[29:18] of catholicism and we can see how it's
[29:21] wrong and god has called us out of
[29:23] denominational systems and he said come
[29:25] over my people that should be not
[29:27] partakers of our sins and plagues come
[29:30] to jesus because jesus is the way church
[29:32] he's the way the truth and the
[29:34] right and no man comes to the father
[29:36] except through
[29:38] except through jesus amen
[29:41] so we had a prophet with the elijah
[29:43] spirit pointing us to the lord
[29:46] whereas another man who says he has
[29:48] elijah spirit pointed away from the word
[29:50] and said the word doesn't matter
[29:52] to me it's as clear as day
[29:54] commit to me it's so clear but some for
[29:56] some reason people can't see it remember
[29:58] there's former message preachers saying
[30:00] the catholic church is not the mother of
[30:01] harlot
[30:02] yet they got all that child abuse it's
[30:04] not only a clergy of i'm sorry it's not
[30:07] only priest abuse it's nuns abuse
[30:10] nuns are abusing luna girls
[30:12] just like priests are abusing little
[30:14] boys there's all kinds of news on that a
[30:16] couple years ago it all came out
[30:18] things that are known i mean they just
[30:20] make it known
[30:21] it's a it's a total their dna is wrong
[30:23] right their dna is not the they're not
[30:25] terminal people that do that they're
[30:27] children of the wicked one
[30:29] because they're known by their fruits
[30:31] they're known by their corrupt fruits
[30:33] but a good tree is known by tooth fruit
[30:35] amen
[30:36] hallelujah
[30:38] now it's kind of like church what we see
[30:40] here now as we're finishing up this
[30:42] series on the church ages in the old
[30:44] testament
[30:46] we see through the kings that your life
[30:48] is a choose your own destiny
[30:51] god told moses tell israel choose life
[30:54] that you may live
[30:55] choose blessing and you'll be blessed
[30:57] but choose cursing and you'll be cursed
[31:01] remember he said choose life he said why
[31:03] would you die oh israel remember he said
[31:05] that
[31:06] why will you die oh israel that's what
[31:08] moses told israel
[31:10] why would you choose to die choose to
[31:12] live praise god
[31:15] now in 2017 i don't remember this slide
[31:17] but i use this slide we can parallel the
[31:19] natural kings with us because we're the
[31:22] spiritual kings
[31:23] now remember the kings had three
[31:25] outcomes let's preach to this from my
[31:26] sermon in 2017. the kings were all they
[31:29] were either called right
[31:31] right but
[31:33] or evil
[31:34] you only fit in three choices amen
[31:37] really fit in three categories that's
[31:38] what jesus said about the end time amen
[31:41] either hot lukewarm or cold amen
[31:45] that's how it is
[31:46] you're going to fit in one of those
[31:48] three categories
[31:51] so
[31:52] david is the example david that did that
[31:54] which is right in the sight of the lord
[31:56] now the kind of middle of the road the
[31:58] kind of lukewarm was did right but not
[32:00] as david had done
[32:02] and then the other one the third kind
[32:04] was evil as it was in the eyes of the
[32:06] lord
[32:08] now i'm going to skip through these
[32:09] because you're probably you remember
[32:11] these hezekiah that was right
[32:13] uh jonathan was an example of did right
[32:15] but you entered not into the temple of
[32:17] the lord
[32:19] um evil is like
[32:21] jehoram jehu ram he raw evil on the side
[32:24] lord but not like his father mother
[32:27] before you put away the image of baal's
[32:28] fathered me
[32:29] now church this is what we ended with on
[32:31] sunday what were your records
[32:34] what will your book in heaven say
[32:36] right because we read all these about
[32:38] these men and women we see what their
[32:40] lives were like but we're spiritual
[32:42] kings and priests what is god going to
[32:44] write about our lives well we know he's
[32:46] going to write whatever we choose
[32:49] praise god
[32:51] now brother branham came across many
[32:53] things
[32:54] in his life i just listed five
[32:57] at the beginning brother branham let his
[32:59] mother-in-law say don't go to those
[33:01] trash people the pentecostals
[33:04] and so brother man listen to his
[33:05] mother-in-law he gave him the peer
[33:07] pressure
[33:09] can i say it like this this is a form of
[33:10] discrimination right
[33:12] kinda like remember how peter got under
[33:13] discrimination he wouldn't eat with the
[33:14] gentiles same thing here brother graham
[33:17] kind of in one sense discriminated
[33:19] against the pentecostals all because the
[33:21] pressure of his mother-in-law he didn't
[33:23] want to let down his mother-in-law
[33:26] right and anyone with a family that has
[33:28] you know some family the message and
[33:29] some not right you can relate to that
[33:31] right
[33:32] you know the family that's not in the
[33:33] message they want you to do this they
[33:34] want you that and you gotta pray about
[33:36] it right you gotta ask you gotta seek
[33:38] the lord so lord what's the right
[33:40] approach may god help us to always stand
[33:43] with the word of god
[33:44] amen
[33:46] i try to do that in my life with my
[33:47] mother-in-law my father-in-law
[33:49] and my wife and i as we pray we try to
[33:51] do that which is right in the sight of
[33:53] the lord
[33:57] we certainly got into it well i
[33:58] shouldn't say that i better not go too
[33:59] far
[34:00] ah
[34:01] second murder man was pressured to
[34:03] accept women preachers by his first
[34:05] pastor remember roy davis said uh billy
[34:08] he said you got to come to the service
[34:10] tonight we're having a woman preach and
[34:11] brother said i won't he said well give
[34:13] me your he said you're gonna have to
[34:14] resign he said i won't have to here's my
[34:16] he's here's my denominational preaching
[34:18] card he just handed it right in
[34:20] so look braham was able in that trial
[34:23] that uh that pressure from
[34:24] denominational pressure bernie was able
[34:27] to freely forsake his church the church
[34:29] that let him preach right the
[34:31] church that opened the paper he was so
[34:33] strong in the lord he was able to turn
[34:35] to his car and just walk away and say
[34:36] see you later god will raise up a church
[34:38] that believes the truth
[34:40] that's going to be recorded in his
[34:42] testimony
[34:44] when the denominational spirit tried to
[34:45] come in and say oh you should bow to
[34:47] jezebel right when jezebel tried to come
[34:50] in
[34:50] the holy spirit had had his way in
[34:52] brother man's life and brother overcome
[34:54] that denominational spirit
[34:58] third when he went to south africa for
[35:00] the first time
[35:02] the ministers tried to get him to go to
[35:04] the small churches when the angels of
[35:06] the lab told them to go to the big
[35:07] churches or the uh the bigger campaigns
[35:10] and what about them do he gave in to the
[35:13] ministers so he suffered with amoebas i
[35:15] think for a year after if i'm not
[35:16] mistaken or maybe six months he was off
[35:19] the field for six months to a year
[35:24] now see
[35:26] brother ram is not the only one that
[35:27] would compromise this because we all
[35:29] compromise it sometimes we all fall
[35:31] short of the glory of god but god we
[35:33] should let god teach us through our
[35:35] mistakes
[35:37] we should be able to say if i failed
[35:38] last time with this i'm not going to
[35:40] fail this time amen
[35:42] and that's what brother learned brother
[35:44] learned these mistakes right
[35:46] he learned from the mother-in-law he
[35:47] learned from the ministers and their
[35:49] denominational spirits right
[35:51] he learned from that
[35:54] now this is the one i read
[35:56] this one i mentioned endless service
[35:59] in 1962 a man named brother pope offered
[36:03] him five times the income
[36:05] think about that if you make fifty
[36:07] thousand dollars
[36:08] [Music]
[36:10] times five that's 200 that's a quarter
[36:12] million dollars imagine if somebody said
[36:14] i offer you a quarter million dollars to
[36:16] leave your church and you'll get it
[36:17] every year
[36:19] what would you do
[36:20] well i hope you stay with the word
[36:23] but that's what they offer baby has the
[36:25] quotes from the sermon is your life
[36:26] worthy of the gospel 1963.
[36:30] he said we'll give you a private jet can
[36:31] you imagine finding private jet you have
[36:34] to fly with all the public people
[36:36] you get to sit first class make a
[36:38] quarter million dollars
[36:40] he said okay what do i have to do
[36:41] brother he knew he was being tested you
[36:43] know oh just gotta you know don't preach
[36:45] on the water baptism in jesus name don't
[36:48] preach against initial evidence and
[36:49] don't preach against women preachers
[36:51] abraham said he said i'm surprised that
[36:54] a man who would honor me would ask me to
[36:56] compromise on the things i hold more
[36:58] dear than life
[37:00] see doctrine of abraham was more dear
[37:02] than life and that's what doctrine is to
[37:04] us it's more dear than life because it's
[37:07] the spirit of truth amen
[37:10] your actions our actions prove what
[37:12] spirit is behind us
[37:15] that that's what brother man knew but
[37:17] man knew it's not so much it's not the
[37:19] number of miracles it's the it's the
[37:21] it's the actions of obedience praise god
[37:24] hallelujah
[37:25] that's what matters obeying the lord
[37:29] obeying the spirit of truth walking in
[37:31] truth amen that's what matters
[37:32] hallelujah
[37:34] walking in the truth of god
[37:36] and the last one i just brought up was
[37:38] remember but i was tempted by the devil
[37:40] by his own complex
[37:42] to stop preaching in churches and to
[37:44] take his wife and go up into canada
[37:46] and then whenever god would give him
[37:48] without saving the lord he said he'd
[37:49] thunder down he'd stomp down the
[37:50] mountain to come down and say god said
[37:52] the lord and he'll leave and go back up
[37:54] to the mountains and the angel said you
[37:56] better not do that your wife will leave
[37:58] you
[38:00] you have a divorce
[38:01] essentially
[38:02] right a separation
[38:05] he said you better not do that you'll
[38:06] become a bum like your uh brother-in-law
[38:08] fletcher
[38:11] you become a bum
[38:12] so see look what even when we go through
[38:14] complex of church we have to we have to
[38:16] be confident that the holy ghost will
[38:18] help us at the right time in the right
[38:20] season amen
[38:22] but think about it brother man had
[38:23] fallen on all these what would his
[38:25] testimony be
[38:26] he would have been a man that abandoned
[38:28] the church that's called an apostate by
[38:30] the way
[38:31] apostates do not inherit the kingdom of
[38:33] god
[38:34] that's why when people abandon the
[38:35] church it's a very serious thing
[38:37] they're a bad they're leaving the battle
[38:39] it's like we're fighting on the battle
[38:40] tonight are you fighting tonight church
[38:42] that god's brothers
[38:43] we're fighting here the good fight of
[38:45] faith we're standing for truth and those
[38:47] that abandon us
[38:49] are going to have to suffer for that
[38:52] they're apostates they're leaving the
[38:54] faith
[38:57] the other one is joining organization
[38:59] uniting with the antichrist spirit so
[39:02] was that top one
[39:04] so was the second one really that's the
[39:06] jezebel spirit right submitting to a
[39:08] woman minister
[39:09] and then denominational spirit the third
[39:11] one
[39:12] but church each one of us are going to
[39:14] choose our own blessing thank god that
[39:16] the holy ghost god gave brother man
[39:19] victory after victory after victory and
[39:21] he learned from his mistakes and he was
[39:23] to finish his life
[39:25] saying that he was able to finish his
[39:26] course and keep the faith just like
[39:28] saint paul amen
[39:30] hallelujah praise god amen
[39:34] thank you church i appreciate you know
[39:36] we
[39:38] i know it's hard when there's less
[39:39] people here you know it's getting harder
[39:40] so we just gotta press through by the
[39:42] grace of the lord
[39:43] so this is why i showed in 2017. you put
[39:45] your name in there
[39:47] jesse was blank years old when he or she
[39:49] began to reign spiritually
[39:51] and jesse reigned how many years in
[39:53] akron
[39:56] you could put your name in there
[39:58] because you reign over the world or is
[40:00] the next slide but said you reign over
[40:02] these three these three three these four
[40:04] things sin
[40:05] the world the flesh and the devil
[40:08] so put your name in there lydia
[40:11] lydia began to reign over the devil in
[40:13] this year and she reigned how many years
[40:15] in doyletown or in akron
[40:17] that's your testimony
[40:19] and then lydia did that which was right
[40:23] put your name in there question male guy
[40:25] garrus
[40:26] nature virtue eden put your name in
[40:28] there haven
[40:30] she did that which was right in the
[40:31] sight of the lord
[40:33] and did all
[40:36] that uh brother branham did or said like
[40:38] i said like that
[40:40] or all that jesus did or all that jesus
[40:42] wanted you to do
[40:44] see we're all gonna have a story told
[40:46] about us
[40:48] the bible said the books will be open
[40:50] and then you'll be judged according to
[40:52] what's in the book
[40:54] i want the book to say that i started
[40:56] reading at this age amen 19 hallelujah i
[40:59] started reading at 19 amen
[41:02] and now it's what i'm let's see 29 39
[41:04] it's 20 22 years rain for 22 years
[41:08] praise god
[41:09] in akron and i did that which was right
[41:12] amen just like saint paul that's my
[41:15] desire
[41:16] just to be just like saint paul did all
[41:18] according to what saint paul told me to
[41:20] do in the bible amen
[41:23] see church you got to put yourself in
[41:24] there and mothers and fathers if you're
[41:26] not a preacher that's what you can do
[41:28] you can still reign over these four
[41:30] evils sin the world the flesh and the
[41:33] devil
[41:35] each one of us has a testimony and we
[41:37] have to reign over these by the grace of
[41:39] god
[41:42] remember what bernard said
[41:44] he that overcomes and keeps my works to
[41:47] the end
[41:49] it's very evident from the remarks of
[41:51] the spirit on works that the lord is
[41:53] trying to get his own to see his opinion
[41:54] of righteous works
[41:56] four times he mentions works don't let
[41:59] anybody tell you works don't matter
[42:02] works matter praise god
[42:05] works don't save you but after you are
[42:07] saved works matter
[42:10] praise god
[42:12] jesus's work saves you but then he wants
[42:15] you to work amen
[42:17] the bible says we're soldiers enlisted
[42:19] in the army what general doesn't want
[42:21] his soldiers to work amen
[42:23] whoever hires a soldier pay some money
[42:25] and just sit in the tent and just eat
[42:28] drink and be married nobody you gotta
[42:30] get up and you gotta exercise in the
[42:32] morning you gotta run some miles you
[42:34] gotta put your backpack on you gotta
[42:36] change god saves you to put you to work
[42:38] amen
[42:40] everybody should know that
[42:43] four times jesus mentions works in
[42:45] revelation chapter
[42:47] two fire to your church age
[42:50] and now he says that he keeps doing his
[42:51] works faithfully until the end will be
[42:54] given power over nations and will be a
[42:56] strong capable unbending ruler who can
[42:59] cope so powerfully with any situation
[43:02] even the most desperate enemy will be
[43:04] proved will be broken if need be
[43:06] his demonstration of rule by power will
[43:08] be like the very sons this is very
[43:11] amazing
[43:13] hallelujah in other words if you can do
[43:15] the right works over and over and get
[43:16] godly habits then you'll be able to
[43:18] handle every situation that comes your
[43:20] way
[43:22] you won't be afraid of your neighbor
[43:23] you'll be afraid of the doctor right for
[43:25] those of us to go to the doctor you
[43:27] won't be afraid of
[43:28] of a debate you won't be afraid of
[43:31] sickness you won't be afraid of your
[43:33] mother-in-law father-in-law you won't be
[43:34] afraid of them because you've already
[43:37] gained the works of god god is already
[43:39] working you on a daily basis and you
[43:41] know where you stand and review what
[43:43] god's called you to do
[43:45] you only know how to surrender to the
[43:47] works of the holy spirit
[43:51] that's what i want church i want to
[43:53] handle every situation that so that no
[43:55] matter what happens our faith is in
[43:57] jesus christ
[43:59] and we can handle every situation i
[44:01] always try to think about that by the
[44:02] grace of god what if somebody comes in
[44:04] here like a devil when somebody comes in
[44:05] here you know screaming or shout what
[44:07] lord you'll just give me strength for
[44:09] that hour
[44:12] now brother man says perfect faith is
[44:14] the master of all circumstance for
[44:16] perfect faith masters all circumstance
[44:20] now i'm not going to read all this but
[44:22] faith masters every circumstance
[44:25] and brother talks about in a room of
[44:26] sickness the lord's revealed that this
[44:28] certain thing is going to happen you
[44:30] just speak it and go on
[44:32] so in other words in every bad situation
[44:34] you wait for the lord's leading right
[44:36] you wait for god to say pray for this
[44:38] person or just bless them
[44:40] right or god give me the words to answer
[44:42] this question i don't know the question
[44:43] give me the words so in each situation
[44:46] perfect faith has to master the
[44:48] circumstance in other words you have to
[44:50] wait for the perfect revelation in the
[44:52] situation
[44:56] faith believes that god will work it out
[44:57] i don't know how he's going to do it but
[44:59] he'll do it anyhow see it masters all
[45:01] circumstances and faith and love is
[45:03] relation because you can't have faith
[45:05] unless you got love because your faith
[45:07] is in a god who is the very essence of
[45:09] love faith and love works together
[45:13] so see in other words the more you love
[45:14] god the more faith you'll have when
[45:16] those situations arise
[45:21] thank god
[45:22] i love this quote too
[45:25] anybody ever fear that they won't make
[45:26] the rapture sometimes that comes on me
[45:28] i'll be honest it comes on everybody
[45:30] but man said if a man fears he might not
[45:33] please god what should the man do
[45:35] let him fulfill the word
[45:38] in other words church open your bible
[45:41] and whatever it says
[45:43] do it
[45:46] if a man wonders is jesus going to tell
[45:49] me well done good and faithful servant
[45:52] let him fulfill the word of god in his
[45:54] life and assuredly he will hear those
[45:56] words of praise
[45:59] the word of truth was the criterion then
[46:01] it's the criterion now there isn't
[46:03] another standard there isn't another
[46:05] plum line as the world is going to be
[46:07] judged by one christ jesus even soda is
[46:10] going to be judged by the word if a man
[46:12] wants to know how he's go how he's
[46:14] making out let him do as james suggested
[46:17] look into the mirror of god's word
[46:19] church that's why we got to read our
[46:21] bibles every day
[46:22] hallelujah that's why we got to read
[46:24] chapters that's why they read books in
[46:25] the bible you got to look into the
[46:27] mirror of god's word and when you look
[46:29] at it and you do it then you have
[46:31] confidence i know i'm doing what he's
[46:32] called me to do i know he'll accept me
[46:35] in heaven praise god
[46:37] because i've done what he asked me to do
[46:41] is my flesh gonna like it no the bible
[46:43] says every day you've got to crucify
[46:45] your flesh
[46:46] paul said i die
[46:48] every week i die weekly no no i die
[46:52] monthly
[46:53] i die every year at christmas time and
[46:54] come to church at christmas time that's
[46:56] what a lot of denominational people do
[46:58] i don't die every year i die daily
[47:00] praise god
[47:04] so see if you wonder if you're going to
[47:06] miss i'm sorry if you're wondering about
[47:07] the rapture do what the bible says to
[47:09] make the rapture have oil
[47:12] add extra oil in your soul
[47:14] right because the foolish virgin ran out
[47:16] of oil she ran out of that power she ran
[47:19] out of that anointing she ran out of
[47:21] that but the wise had plenty they
[47:24] prepared in advance amen trust that's
[47:26] what we're doing tonight amen we're
[47:28] making preparations so if the
[47:30] if the rapture holds off if god's wrong
[47:33] suffering holds off we'll still be ready
[47:36] praise god if we die we'll be ready to
[47:38] be the ones that are raised first amen
[47:40] because we have enough oil to be ready
[47:42] when the bridegroom comes
[47:45] amen
[47:46] hallelujah praise god
[47:48] thank you jesus amen
[47:50] but see the world wants popularity
[47:55] now let's look at some lessons now we i
[47:57] just briefly went over this i think in
[47:59] part one i never got to all this
[48:06] israel was our examples in chapter
[48:08] 10 of first corinthians verse 6
[48:11] to the intent that we should not lust
[48:12] after evil things as they also lusted
[48:15] neither be idolaters
[48:19] as some of them
[48:20] as is written the people sat down to eat
[48:22] and drink and rose up the plate neither
[48:24] let us commit fornication are you
[48:25] counting these sins start counting now
[48:27] we've got three so far neither of those
[48:29] commit fornication as some of them
[48:31] committed and fell in one day three and
[48:33] twenty thousand now i don't have it up
[48:35] here but verse nine neither let us tempt
[48:37] christ as some of them also attempted
[48:39] and were destroyed as serpents
[48:41] neither murmur ye as some of them also
[48:43] murmured and were destroyed of the
[48:44] destroyer
[48:46] now all these things happen under us
[48:48] unto them for and samples
[48:51] and they're written for our admonition
[48:53] upon whom the ends of the world are come
[48:55] let him that thinketh he standeth take
[48:58] he lest he fall
[49:02] okay so we are given five sins that
[49:04] israel fell to which proved they
[49:06] couldn't enter the baptism of the holy
[49:08] ghost to the promised land
[49:10] sorry about that
[49:12] is that me
[49:17] that's all right sound is kind of like
[49:18] that you know sometimes it's all
[49:20] sometimes it's good sometimes it's not
[49:21] gotta be ready for any situation right
[49:25] five
[49:26] these five are named now remember they
[49:28] prompted god ten times and were kept out
[49:31] but paul lists five sins that they
[49:33] specifically did
[49:35] now we have to take counsel we have to
[49:37] take warning and we have to self-examine
[49:40] ourselves that we don't think we're
[49:42] above these things
[49:45] church let's just say tonight i'm not
[49:47] above lust
[49:48] i could fall to lust
[49:50] i'm not above idolatry i could idolize
[49:52] something
[49:53] i need god's help to overcome idolatry
[49:56] church you're not if you're not married
[49:58] you're not above fornication you can
[50:00] fall to that
[50:02] right
[50:02] or adultery if you're married
[50:05] tempting god
[50:07] especially when something bad happens
[50:08] and you want god to do something right
[50:10] away you could tempt god you're not
[50:12] above that
[50:13] you could try to make god or command
[50:15] command god to do something for you
[50:18] now here's where we all battle murmuring
[50:20] and complaining
[50:21] right
[50:22] we're not above complaining sometimes we
[50:24] complain and we need to ask god for
[50:26] forgiveness
[50:28] he said take heed lest you fall into
[50:30] these five
[50:32] that's what we should learn from these
[50:34] kings
[50:35] that's what we should learn from all the
[50:36] old testament
[50:38] now what did eve fall to if really this
[50:40] was adultery
[50:42] and she voted those
[50:45] so she at least fell to two of those eve
[50:47] did
[50:48] right
[50:50] these were written for us in other words
[50:52] we need to read the old testament
[50:54] scriptures
[50:55] to gain admonition to gain warning and
[50:58] to gain humility so we examine ourselves
[51:01] and take heed lest we fall to them
[51:04] praise god
[51:05] that's just what the devil would love
[51:07] the devil just love to see somebody in
[51:09] our church who says they got the holy
[51:10] ghost he would just love to get them to
[51:12] fall in stumble in one of these areas
[51:15] and embarrass them at work embarrass
[51:17] them in the church embarrass them online
[51:19] embarrass them in their family he would
[51:21] just love to get somebody to commit a
[51:22] fornication
[51:24] or idolatry or attempt the lord or
[51:26] murmur and complain about
[51:28] something about the church
[51:30] he would just love to do that but you
[51:32] and i can't let him do that
[51:35] you and i got to make sure we're only
[51:36] standing on the word of god praise god
[51:40] and we can't be talked out of the word
[51:42] of god and we can't move to shifting
[51:45] sands
[51:46] but we want to set our foundation on the
[51:48] rock of revelation
[51:50] a rock of the word of god amen church
[51:53] let me say we're not above that we can
[51:55] fall short to some of these things
[51:59] remember
[52:00] remember john the revelator he fell down
[52:02] to worship an angel you remember that in
[52:04] the book of revelation he said hey get
[52:06] up don't do that
[52:07] i'm of one of your brothers the prophets
[52:10] right
[52:11] he was the holy ghost of a man
[52:14] he served god he preached for 60 years
[52:17] he saw america after america he leaned
[52:19] on jesus and muslim amen
[52:21] but he still could be weak
[52:24] and still be tempted with idolatry
[52:27] so we must all take heed lest we fall
[52:30] amen choose your destiny i like those
[52:33] books choose your own adventure right
[52:34] malcolm x says i've seen it like this
[52:36] i like those when i was a boy too you
[52:38] could choose your own adventure
[52:40] that's what the bible is telling us we
[52:42] must choose our destiny choose life or
[52:45] choose death amen
[52:48] now look
[52:50] from a child you've known the holy
[52:51] scriptures which are able to make the
[52:52] wise and the salvation through faith
[52:54] which is in christ jesus all scripture
[52:56] is given by inspiration of god and is
[52:59] going to help you in doctrine reproof
[53:02] correction instruction and righteousness
[53:04] that the man or woman of god may be
[53:07] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[53:09] good works
[53:13] so what is doctrine
[53:16] the scripture will make you right in
[53:17] your doctrine which is your instruction
[53:20] your precepts your commandments
[53:23] how many want the right commands
[53:25] praise god
[53:27] we don't want the commands like oh you
[53:29] need to you need to sow a seed of two
[53:30] thousand dollars and then god's gonna
[53:32] bless you just sow that seed and the
[53:33] seed's gonna bring forth
[53:35] come up and lay up lay up two thousand
[53:37] dollars here on the offer like they do
[53:38] at the denominational churches
[53:40] that's tempting the lord as well that's
[53:42] accepting the lord
[53:43] that's not good that's not sound
[53:44] doctrine
[53:46] oh if you just if you just give a uh if
[53:48] you just give two thousand dollars uh
[53:50] your life your whole life is gonna
[53:51] change not always not always
[53:56] now reprove
[53:58] the old testament will give you reproof
[53:59] what is the proof
[54:01] conviction
[54:03] it will give you some evidence or some
[54:05] conviction all scripture reading all the
[54:08] bible will give euchain some conviction
[54:10] praise god
[54:14] so think about that solomon was
[54:16] convicted he was tempted by women right
[54:17] so our brothers can take that
[54:19] i want to use solomon's testimony to
[54:21] convict me to always live holy unto god
[54:25] right all brothers can say that
[54:29] or like hezekiah got puffed up in pride
[54:31] and he showed the babylonians as all the
[54:34] treasures in the house of god all of our
[54:36] sisters and daughters we all need to
[54:37] live abroad the pride of life
[54:39] right
[54:40] we're going to take heed to that we have
[54:42] to we have to take a warning from that
[54:46] be reproved by the word of god the next
[54:48] was correction
[54:50] restoration to your right state
[54:53] improving your life or your character
[54:56] all the old testament amen we'll improve
[54:58] your character amen hallelujah
[55:01] thank god
[55:03] and instruction in righteousness there's
[55:04] a whole lot in here but if you're
[55:06] instructing the righteousness you're
[55:07] instructed to increase your virtue very
[55:09] very differently
[55:12] so instruction in righteousness is
[55:15] instructing you to have more strength or
[55:17] power virtue
[55:21] all right i'm trying to close here
[55:23] now as doctrine and planet yes i've
[55:25] preached this numerous times look what
[55:26] the bible says look to yourselves that
[55:28] you don't lose the things you work for
[55:31] but receive a full reward whosoever
[55:34] transgresses and abides not the doctrine
[55:37] of christ has not god
[55:39] but he that abides in the doctrine of
[55:41] christ hath both the father and son
[55:45] if there come any unto you and bring
[55:46] down this doctrine receive him not into
[55:48] your house neither been in god's speed
[55:51] in other words don't even let a false
[55:52] doctrine on your phone
[55:54] right don't even let it on your tv if
[55:56] you got a tv screen
[55:58] don't let it in your house
[56:00] because it's going to have a a crippling
[56:03] effect
[56:04] it's going to hurt your family and it's
[56:06] going to hurt your church amen
[56:08] doctrine is so crucial the bible says if
[56:11] you got the right doctrine you got the
[56:13] invisible father and you got the visible
[56:15] sun amen
[56:17] hallelujah in other words you've got the
[56:18] holy ghost and you've got jesus as your
[56:20] high priest there it is
[56:22] hallelujah let me say hear your prayers
[56:25] amen
[56:26] and they'll bless you and they'll keep
[56:27] you if you got the right doctrine you've
[56:29] got the invisible holy ghost and you've
[56:31] got the high priest
[56:35] you see even medicine preachers say oh
[56:37] doctor no matter doctrine matters
[56:39] tremendously that's really what matters
[56:42] because if you've got the holy ghost
[56:43] you'll have the right doctrine
[56:45] it's the same thing
[56:47] now i'm going to skip past this
[56:53] let me close with these a few words to
[56:55] my online
[56:57] and church that's okay i'm not i'm not
[57:00] making fun of them i'm not knocking i'm
[57:01] just trying to be as kind as i can as i
[57:03] close
[57:07] but the bible says
[57:10] there are false brethren unawares
[57:12] brought in who came in privately to spy
[57:14] out our liberty which we have in christ
[57:17] jesus that they might bring us into
[57:20] bondage
[57:21] so the people that are online as spies
[57:24] they're not here to help us they're
[57:25] trying to get us into bondage to accuse
[57:27] us
[57:29] right just look for our faults they're
[57:31] not really trying to help us be a better
[57:32] christian church i'm here to help you be
[57:34] a better christian tonight
[57:36] i want to i hope i've shown you enough
[57:38] word of god where you can accept the
[57:40] word of god and your character or your
[57:42] virtue or your nature can be increased
[57:44] amen as well
[57:46] right
[57:49] that's what i'm here for i'm here to
[57:51] minister the word of god to you praise
[57:53] god amen so you can be more solidified
[57:56] in the truth of god's word so you can be
[57:58] stronger and you can take heed lest you
[58:00] fall
[58:02] because we don't want to see people fall
[58:06] church doesn't break your heart when you
[58:07] see people fall away from the truth far
[58:09] away from our church of course it breaks
[58:12] our hearts i try to text them and bring
[58:13] them back or call them and bring them
[58:15] back
[58:16] send them free things send them my brips
[58:17] all these things it breaks our hearts
[58:19] when people don't come back
[58:23] but spies around us in our life that's
[58:26] why i'm praying for you brother that you
[58:27] get saved and sanctified and filled with
[58:29] the holy ghost
[58:31] they don't come to help us they try to
[58:33] bring us into bondage to the bondage
[58:35] they're under
[58:37] and what did paul say paul said to whom
[58:40] we gave place by subjection not even an
[58:42] hour
[58:43] that the truth of the gospel might
[58:45] continue
[58:46] so at least one man is watching my
[58:48] sermons just to report them to brother
[58:50] rahm's accusers
[58:52] instead of coming to try to help me if
[58:53] he was a real brother he'd want to help
[58:55] me that way
[58:56] he come to me one on one if i offended
[58:58] him
[58:59] of course this isn't anything new
[59:01] because these are spirits on the spies
[59:03] the bible said
[59:06] right because we're in their liberty
[59:08] what is liberty remember i talked about
[59:09] kids what was liberty liberty was
[59:10] obeying what
[59:12] the holy spirit yeah all right giving
[59:14] you guys two claps
[59:16] that's liberty so we're we're in the
[59:18] liberty we're obeying the commands of
[59:20] the lord they say it's legalism but
[59:22] really they're the legalists
[59:24] because they're not obeying the commands
[59:25] of god
[59:27] they're saying uh they're saying you
[59:28] don't have to obey these things well
[59:30] jesus says obey all live by every word
[59:33] that proceeds out of the mouth of god
[59:38] and like i said
[59:40] jesus said go to the person offending
[59:42] you this proves these men are them one
[59:45] spire many spies they cannot be more
[59:48] free since leaving the message because
[59:50] they're trying to get me to fall they're
[59:52] trying to accuse me it's not trying to
[59:54] help me they're trying to bring me in
[59:55] bondage
[59:57] see
[59:58] and let me say like this they're slaves
[1:00:00] to plotting spirits because the bible
[1:00:02] says they're spies which means to
[1:00:05] inspect in order to plot against you
[1:00:08] they're trying to set up something
[1:00:09] against me instead of trying to help me
[1:00:12] they're trying to set something up
[1:00:13] against me
[1:00:15] that's not the right spear
[1:00:17] [Music]
[1:00:18] no i watch their side too i do a lot of
[1:00:21] watching their side and i'm getting
[1:00:22] ready to share with them all the things
[1:00:24] they're wrong on i just need a lot of
[1:00:25] time to prepare because i'm trying to
[1:00:27] finish the book i'm trying to preach to
[1:00:28] you i'm trying to feed your souls yeah
[1:00:30] i'm watching their side and it's with an
[1:00:32] intent to help them
[1:00:34] i already debated them i tried to help
[1:00:36] them through for three and a half hours
[1:00:37] out of the day i tried to help them face
[1:00:39] to face
[1:00:40] i wrote this book and none of them
[1:00:42] none of them want to read either book
[1:00:46] but what's the bible say when you plot
[1:00:47] against somebody you're either that's
[1:00:49] one of these i can't i haven't had
[1:00:50] enough time to study that they're either
[1:00:52] in variance emulation striper sedition
[1:00:55] because they're trying to do a
[1:00:58] just they're trying to do a heated
[1:00:59] contention to put to put me against the
[1:01:02] other brother
[1:01:04] or they're an emulation they're trying
[1:01:05] to do a rivalry between me and the
[1:01:07] brother instead of trying to help me out
[1:01:09] why they just come to me if i sinned
[1:01:10] against them
[1:01:12] why don't they just come to me and try
[1:01:13] to help me like a brother they're trying
[1:01:15] to get me in bondage
[1:01:17] or maybe it's strife maybe they're
[1:01:19] trying to uh election year for some
[1:01:21] position make themselves look great
[1:01:25] with this this other side the the the
[1:01:27] brother man's accuser side
[1:01:30] or maybe they're just at the spirit of
[1:01:32] sedition the demonic spirit of sedition
[1:01:34] they just want to divide believers
[1:01:38] they just want to create trouble
[1:01:40] that's what the bible said they spy out
[1:01:41] in order to set a plot against you
[1:01:46] a church
[1:01:48] let me read it for our brother listening
[1:01:50] our spy brother and i say that love
[1:01:52] because that's what the bible says they
[1:01:53] are
[1:01:55] in the book brother there's
[1:01:57] 15
[1:01:58] doctrines paul taught
[1:02:00] that most churches reject
[1:02:02] and i would say most people that leave
[1:02:03] the message are under bondage to some of
[1:02:06] these sins for example homosexual
[1:02:08] relationships paul condemns those
[1:02:10] adulterous relationships married more
[1:02:12] than one time
[1:02:14] that's a spirit they might be under it's
[1:02:16] okay to have adulteries married two
[1:02:18] three times spirit of fornication
[1:02:20] letting people marry it's okay to be
[1:02:21] married
[1:02:22] i'm sorry it's okay to do uh relations
[1:02:24] before someone's married
[1:02:27] murdering babies through abortion or
[1:02:29] abortion pills a lot of churches are
[1:02:31] okay with that women preachers yet paul
[1:02:34] forbids any woman from teaching a man
[1:02:37] see they're under that bondage they're
[1:02:39] under these bondage they're trying to
[1:02:41] get me under those bondages no sir i
[1:02:43] won't be under that violence
[1:02:46] they're not trying to help me they're
[1:02:47] trying to bring me under their same
[1:02:48] bondage
[1:02:49] substance abuse some of them smoke some
[1:02:51] of them get drunk but paul says if you
[1:02:53] defile the body you defile the temple
[1:02:55] the holy ghost
[1:02:56] and those things should not be done as
[1:02:58] long as the world stands amen
[1:03:01] little church you're right your own
[1:03:03] destiny amen you write your own story
[1:03:04] tonight praise god hallelujah you're a
[1:03:07] king you're a priest amen over sin flesh
[1:03:10] the devil in the world praise god do
[1:03:12] what's right we're doing what's right in
[1:03:14] the sight of the lord we're keeping
[1:03:15] paul's commands because that's what we
[1:03:17] judge by on that day amen
[1:03:19] the bible said all will stand before the
[1:03:21] judgment scene of christ and get the
[1:03:23] rewards done in their body done their
[1:03:25] flesh
[1:03:26] according to your works
[1:03:29] and we ain't even close to done
[1:03:31] well i gotta go fast
[1:03:33] viewing sinful movies and television
[1:03:34] shows yeah paul says i avoid all
[1:03:37] appearance of evil
[1:03:39] and josh i listen to these people that
[1:03:41] leave the message now they're on a movie
[1:03:43] binging spree they have all these movies
[1:03:45] they watched they got cussing on them
[1:03:46] murdering uh uh sex scenes all kinds of
[1:03:50] wicked things like this and they sit
[1:03:51] there and watch it and laugh about it
[1:03:53] and enjoy it yeah i'm listening to you
[1:03:55] too i'm spying on you guys but i'm gonna
[1:03:56] try to help you praise god
[1:03:59] i am
[1:04:00] just give me some time here
[1:04:02] so my some of my plans take longer than
[1:04:03] those like i thought this book that i
[1:04:05] wrote would take a little time to three
[1:04:06] years to write it and i'm almost done
[1:04:08] with it
[1:04:09] i saw i'm almost done with the audiobook
[1:04:12] sometimes i bite off a little more than
[1:04:13] i can chew
[1:04:15] but i'll get it done by god's grace
[1:04:19] shameful hair like so that women cut
[1:04:21] hair and paul says it's a shame for a
[1:04:23] woman to cut her hair and she'll be one
[1:04:25] verse in the bible where god ever asked
[1:04:27] a godly woman to cut her hair if she
[1:04:29] does she brought shame upon her husband
[1:04:31] and jesus christ
[1:04:33] show me a scripture where it's wrong
[1:04:34] show me
[1:04:36] they won't do it because they can't have
[1:04:37] any because there's none in there
[1:04:40] they're trying to bring me into their
[1:04:41] bondage
[1:04:44] false conversions they say there's only
[1:04:47] one work of grace what a lie that is
[1:04:51] oh you said the sinner's prayer now
[1:04:52] you're filled with the holy ghost you're
[1:04:53] five years old now you're through with
[1:04:54] the holy ghost i still want to go
[1:04:56] play and not even talk about god
[1:04:59] they just said a scripted sinner's
[1:05:00] prayer yes i'll say that
[1:05:02] so you can write and then church and
[1:05:03] then they write it down in their books
[1:05:05] like they got all these converts
[1:05:07] and then they go presented at a
[1:05:08] conference we have four four thousand
[1:05:10] congress this year and they're like four
[1:05:11] or five-year-olds that aren't even
[1:05:12] serving god don't even read that bible
[1:05:14] don't even pray how can they they can't
[1:05:15] even read
[1:05:17] you know
[1:05:18] and that's what they say these are real
[1:05:20] converts come on
[1:05:23] my goodness let's let's be sincere
[1:05:26] and how about this one in modest
[1:05:28] clothing all these men that have left
[1:05:29] they say the bible says modesty and it
[1:05:31] doesn't define it and so the woman has
[1:05:34] to figure out by herself because the
[1:05:36] bible don't say well i can't wait to
[1:05:38] give them a copy of my book
[1:05:41] and they say there's no bible modesty
[1:05:43] standards she has to figure it out on
[1:05:45] her own
[1:05:47] what a lie see what are they trying to
[1:05:48] do they're trying to bring us in that
[1:05:50] bondage to the lust spirit
[1:05:52] right let let the women dress however
[1:05:54] they want that's the spirit of lust
[1:05:55] those guys like seeing it that's why
[1:05:57] they do it that's why the nether women
[1:05:59] dress that the way they want they're
[1:06:01] under the bondage to that spirit they
[1:06:03] can't take a stand for harness because
[1:06:04] they don't have the holy ghost like we
[1:06:06] got in amen
[1:06:09] now that's just 10 church
[1:06:14] remember they're judged by whose gospel
[1:06:16] paul and those are all paul's gospels
[1:06:19] remember i prove it to you the bride
[1:06:21] keeps all the word of god
[1:06:23] when i preach chapter four
[1:06:25] here's five more paul baptized in the
[1:06:27] name of our lord jesus christ and
[1:06:28] they're doing father son holy ghost
[1:06:30] they're wrong on that
[1:06:33] the three works of grace i kind of
[1:06:35] mentioned already god's one person yet
[1:06:37] they call them three persons i was
[1:06:38] called a complete heretic last week on a
[1:06:41] podcast because i believe god's one
[1:06:42] person but at least i got scripture for
[1:06:44] mine
[1:06:46] they don't have any scripture for three
[1:06:47] persons
[1:06:48] so who's the real heretic well they've
[1:06:49] named themselves whatever the devil
[1:06:51] accuses you of that's what he's usually
[1:06:52] guilty of
[1:06:55] and paul never said god was three
[1:06:57] persons and will be judged by paul's
[1:06:59] gospel amen
[1:07:05] okay now i think i better stop there
[1:07:07] so teachers look at the bodies they're
[1:07:09] under i'm trying to close they're under
[1:07:10] a jezebel spirit
[1:07:12] because they let women preach to them
[1:07:14] they're and that means they're led by
[1:07:16] women they're led by in other words the
[1:07:18] roman catholic church and the daughters
[1:07:21] they're under a woman spirit
[1:07:23] a dominating female spirit in other
[1:07:25] words that's an evil spirit
[1:07:27] they're under the last lust spirit they
[1:07:28] watch movies they log all their movies
[1:07:30] and that's also there's no modesty
[1:07:32] standards that's
[1:07:33] lost again that's abominations under
[1:07:35] those spirits
[1:07:36] they're under the spirit of pride i've
[1:07:38] heard them on the podcast say
[1:07:41] they
[1:07:42] they uh
[1:07:44] they praise each other say you're a
[1:07:45] professor okay i'll just call you mr
[1:07:47] professor
[1:07:48] and the other guy says he says people
[1:07:50] just call me a walking bible
[1:07:52] and they exalt themselves so highly
[1:07:54] that's pride you're not a walking bible
[1:07:57] jesus was the walking bible
[1:07:59] you lied and things come out of your
[1:08:01] mouth and you sin and you say that
[1:08:03] you're not a walking bible you're
[1:08:05] walking a pile of dirt cloud amen that's
[1:08:08] that's what you are with the spirit and
[1:08:10] soul on the inside but yeah they say i'm
[1:08:12] a professor
[1:08:14] i'm a walking bible see how the pride is
[1:08:16] entered into them
[1:08:19] they're deceivers saying oh it's one
[1:08:21] work of grace you already got the holy
[1:08:23] ghost that's that's a lie
[1:08:25] we don't have time for that verse but
[1:08:26] that's their verse right there they
[1:08:27] promise them liberty but they're all
[1:08:29] slaves of corruption
[1:08:31] they're slaves all these other sins
[1:08:33] and they're liars church they have
[1:08:35] countless
[1:08:36] countless assumptions about brother
[1:08:38] branham just because birmingham changes
[1:08:39] the story they'll jump and they'll make
[1:08:41] a conclusion they'll lie and say see he
[1:08:43] lied
[1:08:44] and they'll make up some reason why
[1:08:47] there's all these uh changes in the
[1:08:48] stories and they're lying they're
[1:08:50] basically they're they're saying that
[1:08:52] they know what brother man was thinking
[1:08:53] they know exactly what happened they all
[1:08:55] know what happened
[1:08:58] they're lying
[1:09:00] saying that they know what happened and
[1:09:01] they called brother malaya
[1:09:03] they weren't there they don't know what
[1:09:04] happened they're just guessing it based
[1:09:06] upon what they know it's all assumptions
[1:09:09] so you see they're in bondage to that
[1:09:12] and of course the roman catholic church
[1:09:13] is no longer the mother of harlot
[1:09:15] well then who is
[1:09:17] who is that mother harder who sits on
[1:09:18] seven hills
[1:09:20] who is she
[1:09:22] that has an influence over the whole
[1:09:23] world it could only be the roman
[1:09:25] catholic church i have 11 11 proofs in
[1:09:26] the bible my dear friend my spy friend
[1:09:29] if you'll read the book and i'll send
[1:09:30] you one for free if you just tell me
[1:09:32] your name and address
[1:09:33] i'm not afraid of you
[1:09:35] because we got the word of god
[1:09:38] and then again no modesty standards
