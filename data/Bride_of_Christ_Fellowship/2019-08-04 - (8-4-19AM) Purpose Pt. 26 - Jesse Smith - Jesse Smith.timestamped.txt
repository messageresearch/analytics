[29:27] to pray read my Bible though thank the
[29:28] Lord for that thank the mercy and His
[29:34] grace won't forget to preach God's Word
[29:39] amen thank you sir
[29:43] as your attorney let's go to
[29:45] Ecclesiastes chapter 3 elective continue
[29:47] on the purpose series in a visitor this
[29:49] morning Daniel he says he knows a
[29:50] William Branham give you around flaws I
[29:53] Danny nice to meet you sir
[30:00] happy to be in the house of Lord today I
[30:02] mean God for all he's done all he's
[30:05] graciously done for us I got an email
[30:07] this week from a person in south
[30:10] calipari Southern California and he'd
[30:14] been going back and forth about water
[30:16] baptism and he saw our video on the Lord
[30:18] Jesus Christ and he just got baptized
[30:20] this week so we think going for that he
[30:22] said he's just happy about that thank
[30:25] the Lord he said now he said if you know
[30:27] anyone else in Southern California needs
[30:29] baptize you said let me know that's it
[30:32] all right sir so very thankful for what
[30:36] God is doing you know as we turn their
[30:39] classes chapter 3 no we want to remember
[30:42] we had there was two to mass shootings
[30:45] yesterday so as we read our Scripture
[30:52] and pray let's remember all those
[30:54] affected that's awful
[31:00] you know when those things happen it's
[31:01] incredibly sad but you know the Bible
[31:06] said there's no new thing under the Sun
[31:07] it's been happening for all of time you
[31:11] know Cain and Abel started there we want
[31:15] to pray for them the thought came to me
[31:18] you know when I was when I first saw the
[31:19] one about Ohio there's one in Dayton
[31:21] there's a shooting in Dayton last night
[31:23] about this morning about 1:30 a.m. the
[31:25] thought that came to me was how many how
[31:28] many abortions were done yesterday you
[31:29] know people make big big deals about
[31:31] these school shootings and yes they are
[31:33] a big deal I looked it up and there was
[31:36] over around the world there's over
[31:39] 125,000 abortions every day so we have
[31:44] to only we want to weep with those and
[31:46] more with those but also Anna pray for
[31:47] change that God will change people's
[31:49] hearts change the Supreme Court we
[31:51] prayed for that last year but just keep
[31:53] praying but we have to keep this in mind
[31:56] you know the media tries to create this
[31:57] big thing but you know it's been going
[31:59] on forever
[32:00] we just are our duty is to pray for
[32:02] those people and the it light if it
[32:05] impacts any of us that we can be a help
[32:06] to them but we should be just as
[32:09] burdened about the people that had to
[32:10] suffer last night as the unborn
[32:13] we should remember them but we saw last
[32:15] week they don't have a voice we need to
[32:17] be kings and priests we need to stand up
[32:19] for those who don't have a voice and so
[32:21] our prayer is that that God will change
[32:24] things in our world also in our nation
[32:28] and I did I emailed the state of Ohio a
[32:32] couple months ago and they they did pass
[32:34] another law limiting abortion so I thank
[32:37] the Lord for that of course there's more
[32:39] work to be done please ask these chapter
[32:41] three we're looking at verse 7 I got a
[32:51] little more on a time to be silent the
[32:53] time to speak I want to preach them on
[32:54] that and then we'll look at a time to
[32:56] love and a time to hate this morning by
[32:59] the grace of Lord let's all read verse 7
[33:01] together please ask these three seven on
[33:04] three one two three
[33:05] a time to Rend and a time to sew a time
[33:09] to keep silence and a time to speak
[33:12] verse eight let's read it together a
[33:14] time to love and a time to hate a time
[33:17] of war and a time of peace that's that
[33:20] one more word of Prayer if you ever need
[33:21] on your heart just make a note unto God
[33:23] let's just lift our hearts and haven't
[33:26] have any father we love your Lord we
[33:27] pray you bless our fellowship speak to
[33:29] Lord healing means there's a spiritual
[33:34] means there's work needs in Jesus name

[34:37] services today if you're part of our
[34:39] home church and you didn't get a message
[34:41] companion make sure you get one of those
[34:42] just think bangs got to get one I think
[34:44] that everybody's got one by God's grace
[34:47] we'll have a carry in on September 8th
[34:49] so we got plenty of time to prepare for
[34:51] that the next few weekends were busy I'm
[34:54] out preaching in a couple of weeks so
[34:56] September 8th ok September 8th way back

[35:00] remind everybody by the grace of the
[35:03] Lord ok Liddy you can switch over here
[35:06] Lydia or mom you said the live stream is
[35:08] OK or at least it sounds good in there
[35:11] yeah that sounds good in there I'm sorry
[35:13] praise God let's look to the Lord here
[35:16] as we would preach God's Word
[35:19] amen tonight normalling will not want to
[35:24] start a little series on spiritual
[35:25] warfare I have a lot more to go on the
[35:27] kingdom of heaven there's a lot of
[35:28] parables there's I think 15 or 16
[35:31] parables now I think I found another one
[35:33] about the kingdom of heaven so we like
[35:36] to continue on that but I think I want
[35:37] to just look at spiritual warfare
[35:38] tonight and hopefully the Lord will deal
[35:42] with us with that so let's look at
[35:44] purpose today I want to finish this 12th
[35:46] season here the Bible said there is a
[35:48] time to keep silence and a time to speak
[35:53] so I want to just look at this now what
[35:57] I added here is we never want to speak
[35:59] negative especially when we're in a
[36:01] difficult situation we never want to
[36:04] speak negatives that's the first thought
[36:06] I want to follow up on we of course know
[36:10] there's we always speak the Word of God
[36:12] against our temptations right we always
[36:14] if we're being tempted we always speak
[36:16] God's Word it's always the time and
[36:17] season for that but if we're going to
[36:20] use a gift we have to wait for the
[36:21] leadership of the Lord and then God will
[36:25] anoint us just like when the God
[36:28] anointed brother Branham to speak the
[36:29] squirrels or got anointed by the bram to
[36:32] tell howdy right to speak the word God
[36:35] will anoint us to bring the past great
[36:37] moves of the Lord or we'd say thus saith
[36:39] the Lord God would
[36:40] join us for that praise God but we got
[36:43] to be in a position to be anointed for
[36:44] that now let's look at this
[36:47] I want I mentioned these last week but I
[36:48] never read them I want to read them to
[36:50] you there's this season here there's a
[36:53] couple seasons where sister Mita was
[36:55] helping brother Branham and so I'm using
[36:58] this as a time to be silent and never
[37:01] speak negative when you're going through
[37:04] a trial and what I mean by that is you
[37:07] never say well maybe God hasn't called
[37:10] me to be saved or maybe I'm not saved or
[37:12] maybe I'm no good maybe God doesn't want
[37:14] to use me you know just things that I
[37:17] said like this idle words because Klaus
[37:19] and we shouldn't say idle words so we
[37:22] want to be careful in the midst of
[37:23] trials to say positive things or say
[37:27] nothing at all right so here's the one I
[37:30] mentioned last week brother Hammonds
[37:31] talking about his new ministry and he
[37:32] said the other morning I said to my wife
[37:34] I'm already fifty honey fine do anything
[37:36] for the Lord I've got to hurry so
[37:37] brother is putting a lot of pressure on
[37:40] himself
[37:41] I got a hurry I got a hurry and she said
[37:43] bill God trained Moses 80 years and said
[37:46] he can train you for another 50 years to
[37:48] get one day of service from you he's got
[37:51] a purpose for you so just stand still
[37:54] she said I thought that's a lot of
[37:56] wisdom stand still God moves every head
[38:00] just according to his great plan just be
[38:03] still God don't don't try to push she
[38:06] said you get ahead of him then it's a
[38:08] whole lot better to try to follow than
[38:10] it is to lead because he's the leader
[38:12] amen
[38:13] how many sheep we got here this morning
[38:15] I want to follow the leaders leadership
[38:16] of the Lord so this is a time where he's
[38:20] getting he's putting pressure on himself
[38:21] I've got to do this I've got to this and
[38:24] his wife asked to remind him listen I've
[38:25] got a perk God's got a purpose for you
[38:27] just stand still so she must have been
[38:29] able to watch his his mannerisms his
[38:32] behavior he was getting uh he was
[38:35] getting maybe stressed out he was
[38:37] putting a lot of pressure on himself but
[38:39] remember the Bible said the wisdom of
[38:41] God is always gentle right it's always
[38:43] peaceful we looked at that last week
[38:44] from James chapter 3 that's how the
[38:46] wisdom of God is it's filled with the
[38:48] peace of God amen and so that's the
[38:52] first situation a few my
[38:54] later brother branham had a febrile e
[38:56] for eight or nine days I think we'll
[38:58] read it in here so this is April of the
[39:01] next year so this is about what fun six
[39:03] months later he said then I laid in bed
[39:05] for nine days with just a high burning
[39:08] fever many of the Brethren come to me
[39:10] many famous brothers came prayed for me
[39:12] here come brother Graham Snelling and
[39:14] brother Otto all these brothers all
[39:16] gathered and praying and everything else
[39:17] me pray he said try my best couldn't
[39:22] even whisper I wonder what's it all
[39:24] about my lovely little wife sitting
[39:25] there her and then praying for me just
[39:28] kept on just staying the same they
[39:30] couldn't understand so here's a time
[39:32] when God doesn't seem like he's
[39:33] answering how many can say him into the
[39:36] head but answer well the church even the
[39:38] pastor you ask every every call that a
[39:40] guest preachers that came in evangelist
[39:42] prayed for me and God still not moving
[39:45] he said what's it all about
[39:47] he said they couldn't understand many
[39:49] times we go through seasons where we
[39:50] can't understand but maybe it's a season
[39:53] for you to learn to say the right thing
[39:56] Amen or be silent because God has a
[40:00] purpose for everything he said then
[40:01] after the meetings was over so he missed
[40:04] these meetings he was scheduled to
[40:05] preach Monday I just you know I'm so
[40:14] thankful for a god-given wife aren't you
[40:17] brother in a real wife a real companion
[40:18] i sat down at motion or got over close
[40:21] to me I said Mita
[40:22] sometimes I wonder you can barely
[40:23] whisper you can hear brother Ram
[40:24] sometimes I wonder I wonder what's the
[40:28] matter I said why would their meetings
[40:31] be there and God let me lay like this
[40:33] said why was it now here's the bad words
[40:36] right sometimes I wonder if he even gone
[40:43] can you picture that see we've got the
[40:46] same way to it I lost my voice and I
[40:48] wonder I do something wrong a few years
[40:51] ago and so we you know he goes through
[40:55] these city seasons and then his wife
[40:58] says she said ain't you ashamed of
[41:00] yourself now of course she didn't say no
[41:01] we're in a bad way but a humble way and
[41:04] she told me bill don't you know that
[41:08] god knows what he's doing with you just
[41:11] be quiet God takes away your voice just
[41:15] be quiet if he shuts down special
[41:20] meanings if he does these things just be
[41:22] quiet he said I went that kind of
[41:24] rebuked me a little so when it laid on
[41:26] the bed and she come and change his
[41:27] sheets and she got the things out on her
[41:30] arm and just started out and I looked
[41:31] there and then brother Graham sees a
[41:32] vision how God was gonna do more things
[41:36] in his ministry and I can't remember the
[41:37] exact vision it was I think it was with
[41:40] a third Pole I can't remember but Jesus
[41:43] appeared to brother Graham right after
[41:44] this I should have got the quote I
[41:45] didn't pull it up wouldn't be hard to do
[41:47] that after service but see God was kind
[41:51] of slowing him down to give him another
[41:53] vision something else to do God had to
[41:56] slow him down
[41:56] and sometimes we can think how could it
[41:58] be God's will for me to not go to these
[42:02] meetings or not free cheese meetings
[42:04] where I'm a preacher for brother branham
[42:05] but see God sometimes slows us down in
[42:08] order to speak clearly to us amen he has
[42:12] to give us a little time he draws us
[42:14] aside to be tested and tried right where
[42:18] the valley my soul amen
[42:25] humility and so we see this as a season
[42:30] where be better to be quiet when if
[42:33] we're gonna say something negative it's
[42:35] best for us to not say anything negative
[42:37] every say then so even the prophet of
[42:40] God even those who are we say most
[42:42] spiritual most gifts most powerful even
[42:45] the most gifted of us are still human
[42:48] we still need God's grace in our lives
[42:49] they meant to show as was prophet by his
[42:56] wife there's a time to be quiet amen and
[43:00] so that's the way with him we know where
[43:02] these are seasons now as I was studying
[43:05] here this came to me this week I know
[43:07] there's another proverb scripture last
[43:09] week we showed you the one where answer
[43:10] not a fool an answer of cool there's
[43:12] times you don't answer a fool because
[43:14] you'll get that spirit on you but there
[43:16] are times you do answer fools now this
[43:18] one came to me again even a fool when he
[43:21] ordered this
[43:21] peace is counted wise and either
[43:24] shutteth his lips as esteemed a man of
[43:26] understanding so it's always wise it's
[43:29] generally wise to wait until you're
[43:31] inspired to say something praise God
[43:34] and so the Bible said even a fool people
[43:38] might even consider a fool being wise if
[43:40] they just shut their mouths right so
[43:45] it's so important for us to remember
[43:47] these scriptures for our lives that we
[43:50] need to be slow to speak I'm gonna be
[43:53] slow to speak and then quick to listen
[43:54] amen
[43:55] right now there are our time so I want
[43:58] to show the other side of the season
[43:59] where blind Bartimaeus cried out more if
[44:04] the congregation's tell him be quiet be
[44:08] quiet be quiet but he says son of David
[44:10] have mercy on me and they say be quiet
[44:13] shut up stop bothering the preacher
[44:15] right but he knew this is Jesus this is
[44:19] the Messiah
[44:20] he's got the anointing if I'm ever gonna
[44:22] be helped it's right now amen so here's
[44:25] the other side of the season where you
[44:27] know Jesus doesn't come around like this
[44:29] all the time right and their seeds of
[44:32] our life where we don't feel maybe the
[44:34] anointing like we do in a certain time
[44:36] amen and when we feel that anointing
[44:38] when we know God's presence with us
[44:40] that's the time we need to cry out to
[44:42] God amen because he cried out said they
[44:45] went before and rebuked him and said
[44:47] hold your peace but he cried so much the
[44:50] more now son of David have mercy on me
[44:53] amen
[44:54] and so the scripture goes on to say and
[44:56] then he comes in what will you have that
[44:58] I do unto you and he said Lord that I
[44:59] may receive my sight and Jesus to them
[45:01] receive thy sight that faith has safety
[45:03] and immediately he received his sight
[45:05] and followed him glorifying God and all
[45:07] the people when they saw gave praise to
[45:09] the Lord now a member of the number the
[45:11] the maniac of Gadara at Legion
[45:13] he went to come follow Jesus but Jesus
[45:15] said no you stay there you be alight to
[45:17] your community but this blind man he
[45:21] said no you come follow me Amen see
[45:23] because God has a purpose for all of our
[45:25] lives we got to hear what God sang amen
[45:28] we got to hear where God's placed me
[45:30] lord where do you want me where
[45:32] my position is it the following is that
[45:35] the father missionary or is it to find a
[45:38] place where you want to plant me and you
[45:40] want me to grow and you want me to be a
[45:42] witness to all those of my testimony
[45:44] amen see God wants us to have a
[45:47] testimony praise God see both men were
[45:52] testifying
[45:53] EJ was testifying well a maniac of
[45:55] Gadara now delivered and then also the
[45:57] next man was testifying the black
[45:59] Bartimaeus now Peter had to testify to
[46:02] the Gentile or to the Jews that the
[46:04] Gentiles receive the Holy Ghost they
[46:07] were are there are kind of upset verse
[46:08] 17 for as much than as God gave them the
[46:10] gift as he did unto us who believed on
[46:13] the Lord Jesus Christ what was I that I
[46:15] could withstand God because the Jews
[46:16] were saying Oh God
[46:17] how could God for the Holy Ghost on the
[46:19] Gentiles but then when Peter says listen
[46:22] they acted the same way reacted when the
[46:24] Holy Ghost fell they rejoice they
[46:26] declared the wonderful works of God they
[46:29] ran all over the city they shouted
[46:33] three right amen and when they heard
[46:36] these things they held their peace and
[46:38] glorified God here's a good example
[46:39] people that were wise Holy Ghost filled
[46:42] people that were wise and they didn't
[46:44] speak against the Gentiles receiving the
[46:46] Holy Spirit instead they glorified God
[46:49] amen so they chose not to be critical
[46:52] see they held their peace with criticism
[46:54] they could have criticized it but
[46:57] instead they held their peace and they
[46:59] didn't speak against it and then they
[47:00] glorified God saying God is also to the
[47:03] Gentiles granted repentance unto life
[47:06] amen
[47:06] what is it show Church that we need to
[47:08] be born again well we're born again God
[47:11] will lead us to be silent and then it'll
[47:13] lead us to praise the Lord amen but we
[47:15] got to be so in touch with God that we
[47:17] know which time it is is it time to
[47:20] praise God there's a time to be silent
[47:22] we have to have the leadership of God to
[47:24] do that that's why a lot of people say
[47:26] things and ruin churches are not born
[47:31] again
[47:32] so say things out of the strike church
[47:35] those same things that destroy a
[47:36] relationship or a friendship or a
[47:38] marriage or or something like that those
[47:41] because they're not born again but see
[47:43] those who are born again they ask God
[47:45] Lord set a gate before my lips amen and
[47:49] help me not to say anything except it
[47:51] would glorify you
[47:52] praise God so here's a good example when
[47:54] you're born again now church there's no
[47:57] way that how could they have known that
[47:59] God in the great heavenly was changing
[48:01] dispensations he was changing seasons
[48:04] amen
[48:05] how did they know God was going due to
[48:07] the Gentile they didn't know they had to
[48:09] have something inside of them to
[48:10] recognize they had to be born again in
[48:13] church we won't recognize what God's
[48:14] doing except we're born again amen
[48:17] so we need to be born again and
[48:19] recognize what God is doing in our myths
[48:21] amen see and those who are born again of
[48:24] the Holy Ghost they're to recognize the
[48:25] change when it gets close to the third
[48:27] ball in the squeeze it's not gonna be a
[48:31] change for the world must be changed for
[48:33] us because they're gonna come against us
[48:34] amen it
[48:35] the foolish virgin will recognize it
[48:37] there they're off trying to get the oil
[48:39] they're all trying to work for that is
[48:40] that the foosh bird
[48:41] will outwork the wise merchants a
[48:44] hundred to one he said the trkage book
[48:46] our works as far as labor and effort
[48:49] won't compare them
[48:50] he said because because they're doing it
[48:54] all for the glory of their churches
[48:55] rather than for the glory of the gospel
[48:57] amen
[48:59] see there that's why they'll have you
[49:02] know relays for cancer that's why
[49:04] they'll raise money in and while they're
[49:06] there they're sown alcohol you know and
[49:08] drinking alcohol they'll have a have a
[49:12] supper of spaghetti suffered raise
[49:13] thousands of dollars for cancer
[49:15] survivors or something and get drunk
[49:17] while they're doing it see though I'll
[49:19] work though how all these works and it
[49:21] seem like it's a great thing but it's
[49:24] not a great thing a man the great thing
[49:25] is doing the will of God amen jesus said
[49:29] that say many I you know you can't stop
[49:32] Devils you did many wonderful works but
[49:34] I never knew you because your workers of
[49:36] iniquity praise God
[49:38] so our work seemed to be works of
[49:40] righteousness amen the most important
[49:42] thing is doing the win of God obeying
[49:44] the word of God amen
[49:46] see how could they recognize that they
[49:48] had to have the Holy Spirit inside of
[49:49] them amen now Jesus has to tell Paul not
[49:55] to be silent now later in Corinth they
[49:57] had a lot of persecution as you know and
[50:01] they eventually had to leave but the
[50:02] Bible said Christmas the chief rule of
[50:04] the synagogue believed on the Lord with
[50:05] all his house and many of the
[50:07] Corinthians hearing believed and were
[50:08] baptized then spake the Lord to Paul in
[50:11] the night vision be not afraid but speak
[50:13] and hold not your peace amen
[50:16] remember Paul was forbidden to go up and
[50:18] preach in Asia right we saw that last
[50:20] week in chapter 16 he was for Britain
[50:22] per minute so that was a time not to
[50:24] speak but here is a time to speak and
[50:26] he's all nervous he's all scared
[50:28] so Jesus himself has to come and say
[50:30] don't be afraid speak my word amen
[50:33] I like that I believe the Holy Spirit
[50:35] will inspire us when to speak don't you
[50:37] if God helped this man when he was
[50:40] afraid to speak the work God will help
[50:41] you and I if we're afraid to speak his
[50:43] word amen
[50:44] it's God's will if God wants us to speak
[50:47] then God will lead us to speak praise
[50:50] God Paul couldn't get away from her he
[50:53] he went through fear as well he let the
[50:55] difficult seasons but the Holy Spirit
[50:57] was there to say speak or hold your
[50:59] peace and we gotta listen that still
[51:01] small voice to hear for ourselves amen
[51:05] he said for I am with thee and no man
[51:07] shall set on thee to hurt thee praise
[51:09] God
[51:10] pride much people in this city remember
[51:12] when Jesus sent out the disciples he
[51:14] said I give you power over demons and
[51:15] all these things and he said nothing
[51:17] shall by any means hurt you praise God
[51:20] so see Jesus when he calls you when he
[51:24] puts you in a certain assignment know
[51:26] how long it'll ask is eventually Paul
[51:28] remember Church Paul got whipped what
[51:30] five times there was times that he was
[51:34] allowed to get beat up here's one time
[51:37] where he got spared from it oh my it's
[51:40] gonna take some maturity on our parts
[51:43] see we think well first that by God will
[51:46] never suffer any pain will never suffer
[51:47] under persecution no one would ever
[51:49] attack me well that's not always true
[51:51] it depends what God's will is for that
[51:54] season praise God that's true like when
[51:59] you hear about you know other mentioned
[52:00] churches are you know having people that
[52:03] that die in tragic accidents or
[52:05] something like that and we must not
[52:06] wonder where was God God knew what he
[52:08] was doing Amen god knows what he's doing
[52:11] our lives are laid out before him as a
[52:13] great a great plan he's got the great
[52:16] map just laid out and he knows all about
[52:19] it he knows that for beginning from the
[52:21] end our God is a great God amen he's a
[52:25] great director he orders our steps in
[52:27] his word amen but see there's times to
[52:31] speak no one's going to hurt you when
[52:32] there's times you're gonna have to get
[52:33] whipped five times Paul so we got to be
[52:37] we got to have wisdom we got to have
[52:39] understanding we just got to trust God
[52:41] no matter what we're going through trust
[52:43] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[52:45] and he continued their year in six
[52:48] months teaching the Word of God among
[52:49] the various teaching teaching the Word
[52:51] of God so God had to say relax Paul you
[52:54] got a year and a half to preach you got
[52:57] a year and have to teach no one's gonna
[52:58] hurt you during this year and a half but
[53:01] after that he said you said you have to
[53:03] suffer great things for my name's sake
[53:05] praise God all right now what a
[53:09] stop there I want to move on now to the
[53:10] 13th season I think I just want to
[53:12] preach the rest of time on this
[53:15] so this 13th season I got a couple
[53:18] examples they just came to me while I
[53:20] was praying here so I don't have all the
[53:21] slides on these but I want look at this
[53:24] now now the 13th we're almost done with
[53:27] this little series that I want to get
[53:28] into the gifts of the Holy Spirit the
[53:30] purpose for your life and all those
[53:32] great things about the purpose I got
[53:35] some questions marks out here because I
[53:36] actually forgot to remove those now in
[53:39] the in the natural and the opposite with
[53:41] love and hate these from what I can see
[53:43] from Scripture deal with relationships
[53:46] now it could be sins and everything like
[53:48] that but I think that works more in the
[53:50] spiritual complementary but in
[53:53] relationships you see this a lot in the
[53:57] in the scripture so let's go to
[53:59] Deuteronomy 22 13 let's go there you
[54:05] know this is a sad thing but you know
[54:07] Moses had to deal with it because the
[54:09] people weren't born again and the Bible
[54:11] said there was a mixed multitude amongst
[54:12] them Deuteronomy 22 here are me 20 to 30
[54:24] let's go to 12 oh yeah I'm sorry no 13
[54:26] your honor II 20 to 13 if any man take a
[54:30] wife and go in unto her and hate her and
[54:32] give a cage of speech against her and
[54:34] bring up an evil name upon her and say I
[54:36] took this woman and when I came in her I
[54:38] found her not a maid then shall the
[54:40] father the damsel and her mother take
[54:41] the bring forth the tokens of the
[54:43] damsels virginity under the elders that
[54:45] sing the gate and the damsels father
[54:47] shall say to the outers I gave my
[54:48] daughter this man to wife and he hated
[54:50] her and lo he hath given her occasions
[54:52] feasts against her saying I found out my
[54:54] daughter a maid and yet these are the
[54:56] tokens of the my daughter's virginity
[54:57] and they should spread the clock before
[54:59] the elders of the city and the owners of
[55:01] that city shall take the man and chase
[55:02] chastise him and they shall merce him in
[55:07] and hundred shekels of silver and give
[55:09] them under the father the damsel because
[55:11] he has brought upon an evil an evil name
[55:13] upon a virgin of Israel and she shall be
[55:15] his wife he may not put her away all his
[55:18] days so in this case is this a strange
[55:21] situation
[55:23] really shows you these people weren't
[55:24] born again they weren't even close
[55:26] they weren't even close here's a man who
[55:29] would take a virgin and love her but
[55:32] then after he marries her he finds
[55:33] something he doesn't like about her and
[55:35] the love switches to hate right and he
[55:40] puts a lie on her but then the Bible
[55:42] said the father brings the cloth and
[55:44] then he's got to pay a hundred dollars
[55:46] because he hundred shekels because he
[55:48] brought an evil name upon this version
[55:50] and he has to still marry her now look
[55:53] at us it's quite a season no doubt
[55:55] during the courtship they're all happy
[55:57] making plans how about the number of
[55:59] babies are gonna happen how big a house
[56:02] they want and you know I'm making all
[56:04] these great plans but then it's switch
[56:06] some evil spirit got on this man right
[56:09] he was piercing get all men to how many
[56:11] believe that it's all men or women so
[56:16] it's switch it was a no season they went
[56:18] through a season of love and they went
[56:20] through a season of hate and so God gave
[56:24] them wisdom in every season how to deal
[56:27] with the problems in every season praise
[56:30] God I don't have this one but you know
[56:31] this one between Jacob and Esau before
[56:34] Jacob took it they the the blessings
[56:37] they love each other right and then he
[56:39] hated Jacob
[56:40] I remember that he's gonna kill him so
[56:43] Jacob had to run away get a wife two
[56:46] wives and then some Compu binds and then
[56:50] when he come back he wrestled the angels
[56:51] at God you've got to change me I'm gonna
[56:53] face my brother and he got a new walk
[56:56] which represent the Holy Spirit and then
[56:58] when he walked in Friends of Esau Esau
[56:59] forgave him so they went through a long
[57:02] season many years where there's a season
[57:05] of love and a season of hate praise God
[57:09] in my life I've told you this before
[57:11] when my dad left my mom with six kids
[57:14] and my dad went to come to my games of
[57:15] sports I hated him but then I became a
[57:17] Christian and I loved him yeah you know
[57:21] cuz I signed I realized how much God
[57:24] loves me praise the Lord and I realized
[57:28] I've been realizing this more that we
[57:30] don't wrestle against flesh and blood so
[57:32] that's why Jesus says if you can't
[57:35] forgive someone
[57:36] I'm not gonna forgive you because you
[57:39] got to look at every situation realize
[57:40] who ever hurt you it's not the person
[57:43] it's the demon behind there and that's
[57:47] what we look at tonight the different
[57:48] levels rest against principalities and
[57:49] powers and high places and all these
[57:51] things our battles is is above human
[57:54] battles it's a spiritual battle and this
[57:59] is the area here where God is showing us
[58:01] these things that we've got to we may go
[58:03] through a season where we hate someone
[58:05] or something but by the grace of God
[58:08] he's gonna bring us back to love and
[58:11] notice this is right before the end the
[58:13] final season which the Bible said marked
[58:15] the godly man his end is peace so we
[58:19] know the one represents kind of birth
[58:21] you know and and then this is kind of
[58:23] represents the end maybe where the cycle
[58:25] starts again so this is at the end of
[58:27] the cycle and so God has to teach us
[58:31] Church in to love those who he once
[58:33] hated that's difficult
[58:35] how many can raise your answer that's
[58:36] difficult it's difficult but it's a
[58:39] season that God has laid out in our
[58:41] lives and God are going to Solomon to
[58:43] show us that and so we had we can have
[58:45] the victory often it's in relationships
[58:48] but now spiritually these are all
[58:50] spiritual seasons too we've got the hate
[58:53] the garment stained by sin and this may
[58:56] again connect to the first love of how
[58:59] we got to hate everything that pertains
[59:00] to sin so Jesus says now this season
[59:06] can't pertain to spiritual because we're
[59:09] never supposed to hate anybody we're
[59:12] supposed to love our enemies except the
[59:15] devil and the demons we don't hate them
[59:18] because they cannot be saved there's no
[59:20] redemption for them you have heard that
[59:22] have been said thou shalt love thy
[59:23] neighbour and hate thine enemies they've
[59:25] heard this but I say to you love your
[59:27] enemies bless them that curse you do
[59:29] good to them that hate you and pray for
[59:31] them which despitefully use you and
[59:33] persecute you that ye may be the
[59:36] children of your father which is in
[59:37] heaven
[59:37] for he maketh his Sun to rise on the
[59:39] evil and on the good and sendeth rain on
[59:42] the just and the unjust amen
[59:44] I know yeah so we must love those who
[59:48] hate us
[59:49] so this season's doesn't give us a
[59:52] license while I'm allowed to hate this
[59:53] person now listen let me say this you
[59:56] may hate somebody but it may be a season
[59:58] so the next time you go through a
[1:00:00] difficult trial somebody hurt you you
[1:00:01] won't hate them
[1:00:02] you'll learn to forgive them right away
[1:00:04] like with me and my father now I know if
[1:00:07] somebody really hurts me I can't I used
[1:00:09] to say that a lot I hate my dad I hate
[1:00:11] him I'll never forgive him I'll never go
[1:00:12] visit I used to say those things but now
[1:00:14] I've learned that if somebody does
[1:00:16] something against me I've got to go with
[1:00:17] my prayer closet and I've been doing
[1:00:19] that recently I love sister so-and-so
[1:00:21] I love brother so-and-so people that
[1:00:23] have hurt me and on the fax we got to go
[1:00:25] to the closet and say that we have to
[1:00:26] say that I love them because the Bible
[1:00:28] said when you pray forgive jesus said
[1:00:32] when you pray forgive amen so you've got
[1:00:36] to take that person's name and your
[1:00:37] prayer closet and you've got to speak
[1:00:40] their name and say I forgive them
[1:00:41] because Jesus forgives them hey we can't
[1:00:46] hate our enemies we got to love our
[1:00:48] enemies amen now the Bible said if any
[1:00:52] man come after me and hate not his
[1:00:54] father and mother and wife and children
[1:00:56] brothers and sisters yay and his own
[1:00:58] life also he shall be could not be my
[1:01:00] disciple now you got a balance in
[1:01:01] Scripture because Jesus doesn't mean you
[1:01:04] hate because that would just do away
[1:01:05] with what he said here
[1:01:06] right he just said love your enemies and
[1:01:10] now we got to understand that maybe they
[1:01:12] could have chose a better Greek word or
[1:01:14] something or a better word but because
[1:01:17] if you look at the parable passage in
[1:01:19] Matthew 10:37 he said he that loveth
[1:01:22] father or mother more than me amen it's
[1:01:25] not worthy of me and he that loveth son
[1:01:28] or daughter more than me is not worthy
[1:01:29] of me so we have to make sure we check
[1:01:31] our Greek words in our understanding
[1:01:33] because God doesn't want you to hate
[1:01:35] Jesus not saying you that's okay to hate
[1:01:38] them now like I said you may go through
[1:01:40] a season where you do but you need to
[1:01:42] say God take the hate out of my heart
[1:01:43] give me love and forgiveness but here in
[1:01:46] a parallel passage what he's saying is
[1:01:48] you've got to love God he's got to be
[1:01:50] your first love amen cuz he said love
[1:01:54] your enemies right if your mother mother
[1:01:57] father's your enemy you still gotta love
[1:01:58] them
[1:01:59] you're not gonna hate them you gotta
[1:02:00] love them so it takes a great
[1:02:03] a great teaching of the Holy Spirit to
[1:02:05] help us out on these things amen because
[1:02:07] there's a season to love and hate Jesus
[1:02:10] is plainly that you cannot love two
[1:02:12] masters at the same time now Mammon may
[1:02:16] represents money or the world Jesus said
[1:02:19] you will eat no man can serve two
[1:02:20] masters either will hate one or love the
[1:02:23] other or else he cannot hold to the one
[1:02:25] and despise the other you cannot serve
[1:02:27] God and Mammon praise God so if
[1:02:30] someone's not born again yeah they may
[1:02:32] go through seasons where you know coming
[1:02:35] to church of the message church feels
[1:02:36] like they hate it because it's all rules
[1:02:38] and regulations but I see it as love and
[1:02:40] protection when God says don't hey he's
[1:02:43] protecting me from demon powers ain't ya
[1:02:46] when God saying don't fornicator don't
[1:02:49] commit adultery he's saying I'm keeping
[1:02:51] you from AIDS I'm keeping you from
[1:02:54] murder I'm keeping you from lust I'm
[1:02:56] protecting you God's Word protects amen
[1:03:00] its protection amen so see but Jesus
[1:03:06] says in in the very soul of the person
[1:03:09] they know which one they love amen
[1:03:12] a church we got to remember we met you
[1:03:17] know at work especially at work once
[1:03:34] again cigarette butts women here you get
[1:03:41] tempted every time a man says something
[1:03:46] is that lust spirit and he's got to turn
[1:03:50] that down
[1:03:51] and so you know in our work situation
[1:03:53] the same thing may happen so I'm going
[1:03:54] to say something to get you hurt your
[1:03:56] feelings or they they criticize you the
[1:03:59] spirit of hate or anger may come over
[1:04:01] you and we've got to hate that you know
[1:04:04] once we really bread once we really
[1:04:06] close your eyes and pray will realize
[1:04:08] that we love Jesus and we hate the world
[1:04:10] but your flesh if I would say no good
[1:04:13] thing grows in your flesh nothing amen
[1:04:16] the sin nature dwells in your flesh your
[1:04:19] flesh will always hate the Word of God
[1:04:21] but your soul are always loving amen
[1:04:23] this we had to make sure we're living
[1:04:26] from the soul man because yesterday I
[1:04:29] seen the guy he got his tobacco tin out
[1:04:31] and my flesh would like to do that right
[1:04:33] but my flesh ain't in control my soul is
[1:04:35] in control my flesh is not my control
[1:04:38] tower
[1:04:39] my soul's the control tower where God
[1:04:42] directs all the ships all the decisions
[1:04:44] all the thoughts God directs it all amen
[1:04:47] and all the thoughts got to come back to
[1:04:49] the soul when you're a real Holy Ghost
[1:04:51] filled Christian amen so see we got to
[1:04:55] remember that that our sin or flesh
[1:04:58] still loved sin once the sin and when
[1:05:01] we're in those atmospheres we gotta
[1:05:04] remember that's the time to pray and if
[1:05:07] we leave that place and we gotta pray
[1:05:09] when we get home and say god I don't
[1:05:12] love that I love you praise the Lord
[1:05:16] because it's such a great temptation I'm
[1:05:19] not above temptation I go to those
[1:05:20] places and I've got to suffer through
[1:05:22] that I hear the music I used to sing
[1:05:23] when I was a teenager I've got a cast
[1:05:25] that down because your fleshly the flesh
[1:05:28] wants to dance you know my flesh
[1:05:30] literally wants a dance that old rock
[1:05:31] and roll but I've got to bring it under
[1:05:33] subjection my body's not thine own I
[1:05:37] realized that my body was purchased on
[1:05:39] the cross of Calvary by the shed blood
[1:05:42] of God's Son Jesus Christ our Messiah
[1:05:44] amen he bought this money it's his body
[1:05:47] and I've got to be an overcomer and I've
[1:05:49] got to overcome all those things by his
[1:05:51] grace amen
[1:05:53] it's not my body it's his body he bought
[1:05:56] it amen with a great price so see this
[1:06:02] is why I'm saying you know the world
[1:06:03] whenever we go out there sometimes I
[1:06:06] like to leave home but we have to
[1:06:10] because you just get around this trash
[1:06:12] you know you get around this atmosphere
[1:06:14] and it wants to serve the world but
[1:06:16] we've got to always remember to serve
[1:06:18] from our soul praise God that's our true
[1:06:20] master now the Bible said in Romans 12
[1:06:23] let love be without pretending that's
[1:06:26] what this simulation means pretending so
[1:06:28] be sincere in your love
[1:06:31] abhor or hate that which is evil cleave
[1:06:34] to that which is good be kind the
[1:06:37] affection one to another with brotherly
[1:06:38] love in honour preferring one another to
[1:06:42] try to prefer your brother-sister give
[1:06:43] them the first choice do something nice
[1:06:45] for them see the Bible said this is
[1:06:47] theirs this is why these things happen
[1:06:50] all the time
[1:06:50] love it love love and hate is a season
[1:06:53] spiritual season that we go through
[1:06:54] we're I mean how many are learning to
[1:06:57] hate sin more and love God more see we
[1:07:03] go through scenes of that where a
[1:07:05] written we don't hate sin as much and
[1:07:06] we're getting loosened but God has for -
[1:07:09] we got it remember to hate sin and then
[1:07:11] love righteousness amen because we all
[1:07:15] get tested we all get tried remember you
[1:07:20] know we were listening to the
[1:07:20] supernatural in our van Bam's
[1:07:22] life story and we're right at the part
[1:07:24] where he goes to South Africa and the
[1:07:26] second set a trap for him and you
[1:07:31] remember the story you know he almost
[1:07:32] died after that because he got amoebas
[1:07:35] in South Africa because he catered to
[1:07:37] men he catered denominations rather than
[1:07:39] the Holy Spirit so this would be the
[1:07:42] time where we'll say like this brother
[1:07:43] didn't hate that enough he didn't hate
[1:07:46] that denominational spirit enough
[1:07:47] because he surrendered to it praise God
[1:07:51] so see that's what I'm saying like we
[1:07:53] get under you know we get around people
[1:07:55] we got to get peer pressure to even the
[1:07:56] message right Church believe that we get
[1:08:05] around that we get influence and we've
[1:08:08] got to remember to hate anything that
[1:08:10] goes against God's Word amen no matter
[1:08:14] who's trying to influence you brother
[1:08:15] have said I always have with trouble
[1:08:16] with a bunch of Frazier's he said now
[1:08:19] those aren't good preachers those are
[1:08:20] bad preachers I know a bunch of good
[1:08:22] preachers but but see and then he
[1:08:26] learned to hate that denominational
[1:08:28] spirit and he never disobeyed after that
[1:08:31] remember the denominational preachers
[1:08:34] wanted to take him just to the small
[1:08:35] churches but the Holy Spirit want to
[1:08:37] take him to the massive services so more
[1:08:39] people could be healed but because
[1:08:41] they're denominational you know
[1:08:42] jealousies and
[1:08:43] and pettiness I don't like that preacher
[1:08:45] program we're not going to that preacher
[1:08:47] see my program catered to their schedule
[1:08:50] rather than to God's schedule just like
[1:08:52] he catered to his mother-in-law and the
[1:08:54] church said at one point bro Gramm cater
[1:08:57] just enough he turned down that offer
[1:09:00] for the Pentecostal churches see he
[1:09:03] didn't hate it enough I hated it but not
[1:09:06] enough may God help us he will go
[1:09:08] through seasons where we learn more to
[1:09:10] hate sin so we don't do it again the
[1:09:13] next time it's presented to us amen
[1:09:15] that's right
[1:09:16] hallelujah that's what I'm talking about
[1:09:20] like lifelong lessons to your life right
[1:09:28] like with my tune tobacco and cigarettes
[1:09:30] I threw up a cup you know the reason why
[1:09:37] I didn't hate it enough but once I hate
[1:09:40] enough anybody then the love of God came
[1:09:43] in how did it yeah
[1:09:44] you've got to hate your sin more than
[1:09:47] anything and that's when you'll get more
[1:09:49] love for God amen that's the reason
[1:09:52] people go don't get delivered like
[1:09:53] program said with that maniac that felt
[1:09:55] on his feet he said he's not deliver
[1:09:57] Satan left him but there was more demons
[1:09:59] there remember he said Satan leave the
[1:10:00] man and he fell down at his feet and
[1:10:03] never believed says he's not delivered
[1:10:04] because he worships those spirits he
[1:10:08] loved those spirits and couldn't get
[1:10:10] delivered so see you didn't hate them
[1:10:12] enough amen but then Mary Magdalene was
[1:10:16] seven demons let's go to the very depths
[1:10:32] and gets us it gets so low that will
[1:10:35] finally start hating sin that's when
[1:10:37] we'll get the victory amen
[1:10:39] I hate acting like it like this I hate
[1:10:42] orange is getting defeated here I hate
[1:10:44] that God give me the love of God give me
[1:10:46] the victory and you know Jesus will
[1:10:48] bring it amen I know you
[1:10:52] that's right Church those spirits can
[1:10:56] stay
[1:10:57] as long as people don't hate them but
[1:10:59] they love them those spirits are gonna
[1:11:00] stay right there so we all love the
[1:11:03] things of God more than we love anything
[1:11:05] else see I just want to share those
[1:11:09] scriptures now I want to deal with this
[1:11:11] because I mentioned this a few weeks ago
[1:11:12] if you got your Bible go to first
[1:11:13] Corinthians 12
[1:11:14] I really felt inspired when I said this
[1:11:17] and I felt I felt the lay of t was even
[1:11:21] more if not the I'll just say like this
[1:11:25] I thought the ladies more important than
[1:11:26] the preacher because there's more of you
[1:11:30] because listen if you have a preacher
[1:11:32] okay let's just use me and you I'm a
[1:11:34] pastor and a church you can go on
[1:11:37] without me but I can't go on without you
[1:11:40] right if you all say well but you
[1:11:50] understand I'm just used as a general
[1:11:51] example but if the pastor leaves or I
[1:11:55] get sick or God calls me away somewhere
[1:11:56] you all can still go on because you're
[1:11:59] the church the preacher just one person
[1:12:02] but when we think about a church who do
[1:12:05] we say Church who do we mention first
[1:12:09] the pastor not the people see how we
[1:12:14] ignore makes it easy to identify but why
[1:12:16] don't we use church names don't just say
[1:12:17] Brian Kretsch toship because we just
[1:12:22] like to attach it to a man because it
[1:12:24] gives you know the man gives the church
[1:12:27] an image but when God looks at it God's
[1:12:29] like I'm not giving honor to the what
[1:12:32] the part you see I give more honor to
[1:12:34] the part you don't see amen and the
[1:12:37] success of our church is based upon the
[1:12:40] prayers of the people the success of
[1:12:42] brother Mannis meetings were based upon
[1:12:44] the prayers of fastings of the people
[1:12:46] amen
[1:12:47] so my ministry as a pastor will only
[1:12:50] music successful as your prayers there
[1:12:56] right but rather said give all the
[1:12:58] credit to the people fasting you
[1:12:59] remember behind the curtain memory said
[1:13:01] that known as evangelistic meetings he
[1:13:03] would go to certain cities and they'd
[1:13:05] have people set up praying before bo-ram
[1:13:06] came and he said give the credit to the
[1:13:08] people
[1:13:10] because they're praying and fasting in
[1:13:12] other words they're trying to contact
[1:13:14] God they're seeking God asking God to
[1:13:16] move praise God now if you don't
[1:13:21] understand that I haven't preached on it
[1:13:23] too much but let's look at this here
[1:13:24] this will help you revelation 2:5 Jesus
[1:13:27] and his bride I love this hate the deeds
[1:13:30] of Nicolaitans not just Jesus but his
[1:13:32] bride does to Nikolay tourism is
[1:13:38] conquering the lazy one holy man well
[1:13:46] let's wait till he gets anointed wait
[1:13:48] till he gets annoyed wait now don't
[1:13:49] don't get me wrong if we leave all the
[1:13:51] things happen everybody's got to be
[1:13:53] north i anointed all over the service
[1:14:03] just the priests and the Catholic
[1:14:09] another church what he said remember
[1:14:12] therefore from whence thou art fallen
[1:14:14] and repent and do the first works or
[1:14:16] else I will come unto thee quickly and
[1:14:17] remove thy candlestick out of this place
[1:14:19] except thou repent but this thou hast
[1:14:22] and this thou hatest the deeds of the
[1:14:24] Nicolaitans which I also hate I've
[1:14:26] searched that out and make our ears go
[1:14:27] like this what does Jesus hate Jesus
[1:14:31] hates Nikolay 'it isn't where you put
[1:14:33] all the anointing on one person like
[1:14:35] brother branham right or like a preacher
[1:14:38] you put all the anointing on men and the
[1:14:41] people seemingly don't have a ministry
[1:14:44] he said see how it all started early
[1:14:46] church it was called deeds and it became
[1:14:48] a doctrine it became the standard it
[1:14:49] became the unbending way it finally took
[1:14:52] over and God was pushed aside
[1:14:53] oh I started out so small so quietly so
[1:14:55] in offensively it looks so good it seems
[1:14:57] so sound then it caught a hold like a
[1:14:59] Python it squeezed out the very breath
[1:15:01] and killed all the spirituality there
[1:15:04] was in the church
[1:15:05] oh that false - subtle it's like an
[1:15:09] angel of light until it gets a hold of
[1:15:10] you now I want to say that I believe in
[1:15:12] leadership but it's not the leadership
[1:15:14] of men I believe in I believe in
[1:15:16] leadership of the Holy Ghost through the
[1:15:18] word I believe also the guy that set men
[1:15:22] of the church men who are
[1:15:23] gifted by the spirit and they will keep
[1:15:25] the church in order I believe that I
[1:15:27] believe also the church is ruled over by
[1:15:29] men that God says that take charge amen
[1:15:32] but that is the rule by the word so that
[1:15:35] is not man really ruling but the Spirit
[1:15:38] of God for the word in the sphere are
[1:15:40] one now then he quotes this I love the
[1:15:44] scripture
[1:15:44] remember them which have the rule over
[1:15:45] you have spoken to you the Word of God
[1:15:47] whose faith follow considering the end
[1:15:49] of their conversation so you're supposed
[1:15:53] to be able to see my faith and other
[1:15:54] preachers faith and follow that kind of
[1:15:56] faith
[1:15:57] however they live their life godly in
[1:15:59] the godly manner we're supposed to
[1:16:01] follow that faith right I said by the
[1:16:03] RAM quotes here he said but see what was
[1:16:06] happening back there that false vine was
[1:16:08] getting ahold and it was teaching that
[1:16:11] rulership my man was right and taught
[1:16:13] that the church had to be governed it
[1:16:14] sought to control over the people but
[1:16:16] instead of doing it God's Way
[1:16:18] they simply took authority invested all
[1:16:20] the spiritual power in their own hands
[1:16:21] and came out with the Holy priesthood
[1:16:23] sitting between God and the people they
[1:16:26] went right back to the old ironic system
[1:16:28] they became Antichrist for they disposed
[1:16:30] of his meat ownership and imposed their
[1:16:32] own will God hated that he sensative
[1:16:36] that and any true believer will hate it
[1:16:38] too
[1:16:39] amen in other words the preachers now
[1:16:42] the Catholic Church is the best example
[1:16:43] they treat the priest now I will join
[1:16:49] with you afraid but as I pray with you
[1:16:52] I'm putting my faith with you
[1:16:54] to touch the high priest he's taking the
[1:17:00] place surprised I'm not taking this
[1:17:02] place I'm joining my faith in with you
[1:17:05] that we will touch Jesus because he can
[1:17:07] be touched by the feelings of our
[1:17:09] infirmities amen
[1:17:10] and that's by the word because men rule
[1:17:14] by the word by the Spirit of God not by
[1:17:17] their own thoughts we would have to be
[1:17:22] stoned blind not to see the same thing
[1:17:23] at work all through the ages and right
[1:17:25] now this the worst of it all so we
[1:17:27] should be able to see it the clearest of
[1:17:28] all all right now what it was was an
[1:17:30] organization that separated the people
[1:17:31] God's people are supposed to be one amen
[1:17:34] by one spear they're all baptized into
[1:17:36] one body
[1:17:37] and everyone I love this is to be moved
[1:17:39] upon by the Holy Ghost and everyone is
[1:17:42] to participate in the worship of God
[1:17:44] [Music]
[1:17:46] don't wait til Amen get to the spirit
[1:17:49] don't wait til I or Malachi or sister
[1:17:51] Sola don't wait till they get the spirit
[1:17:53] you and I everybody get in the spirit of
[1:17:55] God but men one the preeminent so they
[1:17:59] took over control and bishops became
[1:18:02] Archbishop's and with imposing titles
[1:18:04] they bypassed the Word of God and taught
[1:18:06] their own doctrines they got the people
[1:18:08] to obey them until the time came that
[1:18:10] their way of worship to not in any way
[1:18:12] at all resemble the early days after
[1:18:13] Pentecost these deeds were the beginning
[1:18:16] of apostolic succession from apostolic
[1:18:18] succession it was one easy and quick
[1:18:20] step to church membership as the means
[1:18:23] of saving grace the word was reduced to
[1:18:26] a Creed Antichrist by his spirit was
[1:18:28] predominating the church this is church
[1:18:33] you a say because you come to our church
[1:18:39] sup - Jesus Christ amen Romancing you
[1:18:43] can be baptized that is filled with the
[1:19:09] Holy Ghost is all those things it is but
[1:19:13] it should be more he said more seen
[1:19:16] right now it's the worst of all right
[1:19:18] now so in other words there's more
[1:19:21] church membership today than there is
[1:19:22] relationship with Christ which we know
[1:19:26] that's not a surprise to us but the
[1:19:27] trouble is that does surprise us when it
[1:19:29] lurks in the message churches right
[1:19:32] because masters people think well I'm
[1:19:33] Esther job you got a prophet I'm okay no
[1:19:36] you're not you got to be under the blood
[1:19:37] of Christ just the same ways everybody
[1:19:39] else and see the way I want to see it
[1:19:43] and when you and I need to be we need to
[1:19:45] all put effort in to bring in the Spirit
[1:19:47] of God to every service
[1:19:50] because everybody needs to participate
[1:19:52] in the worship of God hey man now before
[1:20:02] I do this let me look up a quick quote
[1:20:04] Church just give me a I thought it was
[1:20:06] in here but it's not so let me pull it
[1:20:08] up the subtle priestly program called it
[1:20:11] a subtle priests in I thought I had it
[1:20:12] but apparently I didn't I don't want to
[1:20:18] move on till I get this one here okay
[1:20:22] yeah here it is Paul saw it coming
[1:20:26] he warned them about this subtle
[1:20:27] priesthood that would come and take over
[1:20:28] with his false doctrines so the deeds
[1:20:32] and Nicolaitans always comes by
[1:20:34] preachers preachers preachers try to
[1:20:38] shut down the move of the Holy Spirit in
[1:20:40] the church that's who do preachers he
[1:20:43] knew they would implement a way of
[1:20:45] worship that excluded the people from
[1:20:47] any part in a Holy Spirit ministry and
[1:20:49] even right today amongst those who claim
[1:20:51] to be free how many claim to be free
[1:20:53] how many claim to be for the Spirit amen
[1:20:57] there's not too much freedom in the
[1:20:59] laity and the best we can see is a few
[1:21:02] preachers with inspired preaching while
[1:21:04] the flock just sits there this is over
[1:21:06] bit it's a far cry from Paul who said
[1:21:10] that when all came together all had the
[1:21:12] leading of the Spirit and all
[1:21:13] participated in spiritual worship hey I
[1:21:19] want everybody to come to church with a
[1:21:21] song right with that Scripture wanna go
[1:21:23] with the song with the revelation with a
[1:21:25] doctrine with something to build other
[1:21:27] people uh praise God we should all come
[1:21:30] to church letting the Holy Spirit
[1:21:35] alright first Canadians travels first
[1:21:39] Kenny's twelve
[1:21:46] now um let's just read it I've never
[1:21:49] preached out of this chapter I don't
[1:21:50] think on extensive an extensive series
[1:21:52] well yeah I did
[1:21:53] yeah I'm sorry it's been a while though
[1:21:55] it's been a while that's when we were
[1:21:56] out the other place in warming let's go
[1:21:58] verse 13 for about one sphere were all
[1:22:02] baptized into one body whether we be
[1:22:04] Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or
[1:22:06] free and have been all made to drink
[1:22:07] into one spirit for the body is not one
[1:22:09] member but many
[1:22:11] if the foot shall say because I'm not
[1:22:14] the hand I am NOT of the body is it
[1:22:16] therefore not of the body now what if I
[1:22:21] tried what if you walk around one foot
[1:22:25] church how would you do this after
[1:22:27] church right every part of the body is
[1:22:38] some part
[1:22:39] you're so important you and I we're all
[1:22:41] important to God's body amen when you're
[1:22:45] not here not good right when I'm not
[1:22:48] here unless I'm preaching it's not good
[1:22:50] that doesn't happen very much so see
[1:22:52] we're all a part of the God's body we
[1:22:55] all play an important part in the things
[1:22:56] of God verse 16 if the ear shall say
[1:23:00] because I'm not the preacher wait are we
[1:23:03] there because I'm not the I see I am NOT
[1:23:07] of the body is it therefore not of the
[1:23:09] body if the whole body were an eye where
[1:23:12] were the hearing if the whole were the
[1:23:15] hearing where were the smelling but now
[1:23:17] God has set the members every one of
[1:23:18] them in the body as it has pleased him
[1:23:21] so God gave you a gift that pleased him
[1:23:26] we just got to find out what gifts we
[1:23:28] got and how do you know you can do it
[1:23:30] you can do it because when the Holy
[1:23:31] Spirit gets on you you can do it that's
[1:23:34] how you know verse 19 and if we're all
[1:23:38] one member where were the body but now
[1:23:40] are they many members but yet one body
[1:23:43] and the eye cannot say to the hand I
[1:23:45] have no need of thee nor I go to the
[1:23:46] head I have no need of you see we need
[1:23:49] every person in this church right to
[1:23:50] play our part I need everyone from the
[1:23:53] the sister the brother no matter what
[1:23:55] far we need everybody in the church to
[1:23:57] play their part
[1:24:00] we have need of everybody verse
[1:24:02] twenty-two see we need you to pray we
[1:24:04] need you to worship we need you love God
[1:24:06] we need you to be led by the Holy Spirit
[1:24:08] amen
[1:24:09] nay much more those members here it is
[1:24:12] right here nay no much more those
[1:24:14] members of the body which seem to be
[1:24:17] more feeble are necessary so the ones
[1:24:21] that we think are feeble they're
[1:24:23] actually more necessary and those
[1:24:27] members of the body which we think to be
[1:24:30] less honorable
[1:24:31] well we always yeah we should on to the
[1:24:33] preachers well that's what we do it too
[1:24:35] much sometimes right those members which
[1:24:38] we think to be less honorable upon those
[1:24:41] we bestow more abundant honour and our
[1:24:44] uncomely parts have more abundant
[1:24:47] communists for our comely parts have no
[1:24:50] need but God tempered the body together
[1:24:53] having given more abundant honor to the
[1:24:56] part which lacks honor so who do we
[1:25:00] honor we honor anybody that's got a gift
[1:25:02] preaching if anybody does miracles we
[1:25:05] honor them with the most honor it's okay
[1:25:07] to honor them right but we need remember
[1:25:09] God honors those that are least honored
[1:25:11] praise God verse 25 why does he do this
[1:25:15] that there be no division or schism in
[1:25:18] the body but that the members should
[1:25:20] have the same care one for another and
[1:25:23] whether one member suffer all the
[1:25:25] members suffer with it or one member be
[1:25:27] honored all the members rejoice with it
[1:25:29] now ye are the body of Christ and
[1:25:31] members in particular and God has set
[1:25:33] some in the church the first apostle see
[1:25:35] the missionary that's the highest
[1:25:36] calling secondarily prophets thirdly
[1:25:39] teachers after that miracles then gifts
[1:25:41] the healings helps government's
[1:25:42] diversities of tongues are all apostles
[1:25:46] are all prophets are all teachers are
[1:25:48] all workers America's of course no have
[1:25:51] all the gifts of healing do all speak
[1:25:52] with tongues do all interpret but covet
[1:25:55] earnestly the best gifts yet I show unto
[1:25:57] you a more excellent way praise God
[1:26:00] everybody catch that the Bible said
[1:26:02] cover earnestly the best gifts so
[1:26:05] prophecy is one of the greater guess
[1:26:08] because the Bible said in the next few
[1:26:09] chapters because it edifies everybody
[1:26:13] right so prophecy is one of the pretty
[1:26:15] important gift because it will benefit
[1:26:17] the most people now I want you to see
[1:26:20] that covet earnestly the best gifts
[1:26:22] there's nothing wrong with preachers are
[1:26:24] you there's nothing wrong with you
[1:26:25] saying my I want to see God move more in
[1:26:27] the church that's what I say I see that
[1:26:29] all the time I pray for that every
[1:26:30] Sunday I print that every Wednesday
[1:26:32] night God move by Holy Spirit and
[1:26:34] thankful what he does through gifts but
[1:26:37] there are seasons where God's planting
[1:26:39] right where God's watering and then in
[1:26:40] the season where God gives the increase
[1:26:43] the thing is God learned patience I
[1:26:46] gotta learn patience we all have to
[1:26:48] learn patience but we all have to find
[1:26:49] our position in the body as well that's
[1:26:52] a mystery the will of God we'll get to
[1:26:53] that one day in the future Lord willing
[1:26:55] now this I just read this last night or
[1:26:58] this morning know this morning so
[1:27:02] brother Rama is asked a question right
[1:27:04] at the beginning of the church age
[1:27:05] series he said one wanted to know if is
[1:27:07] it wrong for women to testify or sing or
[1:27:10] give messages and tongues interpret the
[1:27:12] messages or prophesy in the church but
[1:27:15] ma'am said no it isn't wrong as long as
[1:27:17] it comes in the place in order see the
[1:27:21] church is in order
[1:27:22] only when and the real true way to do it
[1:27:24] is for those who speak with tongues and
[1:27:25] things their messages are given before
[1:27:27] the message from the pulpit never during
[1:27:28] that time of course the Holy Spirit's
[1:27:30] moving just from one place at a time as
[1:27:34] Paul spoke of there but women are gifted
[1:27:36] with prophecy and get there with tongues
[1:27:38] interpretations and everything but being
[1:27:41] preachers and the church said glory so
[1:27:47] that means women can have a gift the
[1:27:48] wisdom a word of wisdom she's got to
[1:27:50] open her mouth and wisdom and give a
[1:27:51] word word of knowledge which is
[1:27:55] understanding by the same spirit women
[1:27:59] can have to get the faith the gifts of
[1:28:01] healing the gift of miracles prophecy
[1:28:04] discernment of Spirit divers kinds of
[1:28:06] tongues and interpretation tough day men
[1:28:09] nor sisters can have all can have any of
[1:28:14] those gifts right everything but being
[1:28:21] preachers
[1:28:22] Oh hallelujah they're not to be
[1:28:26] preachers they're forbidden breach of
[1:28:27] the churches that's right take the place
[1:28:28] or be a teacher anything else in the
[1:28:30] church unless brother man says later
[1:28:31] they can teach Sunday school they're
[1:28:33] just kids they're not men the Bible said
[1:28:34] a woman can have a syrup authority above
[1:28:36] a man he says and can occupy one of
[1:28:39] those nine spiritual gifts the corner
[1:28:41] perks canoes twelve as under Noah bond
[1:28:43] is that her message should not come
[1:28:44] forth in its place you see each message
[1:28:47] waits for its time if there be one who
[1:28:50] speaks with tongues there be no
[1:28:51] interpreter let him hold his peace -
[1:28:53] they're beginning interpreter see and
[1:28:56] these meetings are given usually just
[1:28:58] before the meeting that's right messages
[1:28:59] then the profit of the preacher which is
[1:29:01] the New Testament prophet a preacher
[1:29:03] when he comes forth God begins to move
[1:29:04] through him see then when he's finished
[1:29:06] then messages begin another man then
[1:29:08] just before it's always an order always
[1:29:10] but a woman does have the right amen how
[1:29:14] about all these preachers say like the
[1:29:15] message given rights Amen it's right
[1:29:28] there he'll get away now of course he
[1:29:30] takes me right to wear makeup because
[1:29:31] that's just America right that's not a
[1:29:33] god-given right amen
[1:29:36] what's a saying you have every right the
[1:29:39] sisters have every right to prophesy or
[1:29:42] discern spirits praise God
[1:29:48] well hoping this will help the church
[1:29:50] someday as the Holy Spirit moves more in
[1:29:53] our congregation that's my desire I know
[1:29:56] it's yours too we want to see the
[1:29:57] fullness of Pentecost being the bride
[1:30:01] and so that would mean however God wants
[1:30:03] to move he can move through any gift
[1:30:05] everybody's born again everybody will
[1:30:07] use wisdom everybody will stay out of
[1:30:08] the flesh and they'll just do what God
[1:30:10] tells them to do and that could mean a
[1:30:12] woman having a disservice per say excuse
[1:30:15] me brother the Holy Spirit maybe this
[1:30:17] word here of the sermon for you the most
[1:30:21] you have to serve your thoughts intents
[1:30:23] of your heart you're thinking about that
[1:30:24] that's the wrong funky thing about this
[1:30:26] how many vows gonna honestly handle a
[1:30:28] woman telling you that right right but
[1:30:34] that's the real reality of the Holy
[1:30:36] spirit we had that happened one time I
[1:30:39] told you about it brother Brooks and I
[1:30:40] were at our dedication in 20 2007 our
[1:30:43] dedication sister Karen Saunders walked
[1:30:45] out there and gave it thus saith the
[1:30:47] Lord and kind of reviewed brother Brooks
[1:30:49] right in front of both of us and I and a
[1:30:52] church she rebuked him for something he
[1:30:54] admitted to me that morning while we
[1:30:56] were taking a jog at the at the park and
[1:30:58] she was three hours away in Lima at that
[1:31:00] time
[1:31:00] see that's why I knew was the Holy
[1:31:01] Spirit because mel brooks brotherís was
[1:31:04] saying i don't give enough testimonies i
[1:31:07] don't tell enough testimonies i need to
[1:31:08] write a book on this and he's feeling
[1:31:11] all bad
[1:31:11] well she come around that night it must
[1:31:13] been eleven o'clock at night she said
[1:31:18] and the people and I can't remember all
[1:31:20] the words but it was social it discerned
[1:31:29] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:31:30] and I we're both witnesses we just
[1:31:32] talked about it see the Holy Spirit is
[1:31:35] with us wherever we go amen
[1:31:38] we just got to live such a godly life
[1:31:40] church that God can use us to do some of
[1:31:42] these things amen
[1:31:44] then we got to be humble enough to
[1:31:46] receive it no matter if it's from a man
[1:31:48] or a woman well that man is not my
[1:31:50] husband we'll see then we got it then
[1:31:52] that man maybe should go through your
[1:31:53] husband then it's gonna take some wisdom
[1:31:56] to do these things to take some humility
[1:32:02] see a woman the message restores the
[1:32:05] woman's rights the rights of the nine
[1:32:08] gifts to the Holy Spirit
[1:32:09] that's right church now here's where I
[1:32:13] was trying to tell you earlier God is
[1:32:16] not the god of the pulpit as far as like
[1:32:19] God only cares he only cares he's only
[1:32:21] right here making sure everything's okay
[1:32:23] other man said he's just not the guy the
[1:32:25] pulpit he said now the thing that we're
[1:32:27] talking this question was should women
[1:32:29] and so forth that's exactly what the
[1:32:31] church or started the church in this
[1:32:33] case at the beginning they takin all
[1:32:35] this salon it's solemnity so solemn it
[1:32:39] II from the audience and placed it in
[1:32:41] the pulpit God but God is the God of the
[1:32:47] audience amen
[1:32:49] Oh amen that oughta make you shocked he
[1:33:00] was ready be led by the Holy Spirit or
[1:33:15] just absorb try to get it it's the guy
[1:33:22] the pulpit and the audience amen
[1:33:24] like that song said he's gone at the
[1:33:27] pulpit he's got at the back door
[1:33:29] he's got in the Amen Corner he's gone
[1:33:31] all over the floor that's right my man
[1:33:36] says it plainly here each person has to
[1:33:39] give to the Holy Spirit and God wants us
[1:33:41] all to know what we're called to do
[1:33:46] remember Jesus says I hate that doctor
[1:33:48] the Nicolaitans when they try
[1:33:52] right see Bobe I said the Holy Spirit's
[1:33:56] working through the preacher now because
[1:33:58] of then the service maybe there's a word
[1:34:00] to come forth hey man
[1:34:03] you never know but see people got to
[1:34:06] come knowing that God used me if you
[1:34:09] want to use me I got a cut with my heart
[1:34:11] clean all sins confess I gotta come
[1:34:14] prayed up amen
[1:34:18] see he works in every human being
[1:34:21] oh just preachers know every human being
[1:34:24] he lives in every heart
[1:34:27] oh yes he finds those gifted people
[1:34:30] works through them now if the devil
[1:34:32] can't catch them on one thing then he
[1:34:33] comes over and just makes a big
[1:34:34] conglomerate of nothing that runs the
[1:34:35] people to be used see we want to be used
[1:34:38] by the Holy Spirit he said said but if
[1:34:43] one speaks with tongues by revelation
[1:34:44] gives interpretation of it something to
[1:34:46] edify the church then the whole church
[1:34:47] identified by something that will speak
[1:34:49] and God speaking in languages that we
[1:34:51] know nothing about and we'll give it to
[1:34:53] one and interpret it by another one and
[1:34:54] say a certain certain thing that
[1:34:56] happened just exactly the way it said
[1:34:57] then you've got to the Spirit of the
[1:34:59] Lord among you and oh let's strive for
[1:35:02] that friends let's keep that fire
[1:35:05] burning hey see what does it take it
[1:35:08] takes a fire in prayer it takes us
[1:35:13] hungry for the things of God
[1:35:17] bran never said oh let's get rid of all
[1:35:19] the gifts I got a call right before he
[1:35:21] died he said all nine gifts in the
[1:35:23] spiritual church he said that's a Kazakh
[1:35:24] if I ever knew it and there's a church
[1:35:27] age book clover but I said the gifts
[1:35:29] were made at church until Jesus returns
[1:35:30] in the rapture amen
[1:35:33] see let's keep that fire burning so
[1:35:35] that's what we're to strive for
[1:35:37] we're to were to try to come here and
[1:35:39] say God moved by your Holy Spirit that's
[1:35:41] why I plead on my face every service God
[1:35:43] moved by your Holy Spirit move amongst
[1:35:45] us I'm striving I want to see God help
[1:35:48] us people amen and don't have to be
[1:35:51] through a gift every time but it can
[1:35:53] just be through the preaching but I'm
[1:35:54] saying I want to see more of it so
[1:35:56] that's why I come to pray for it amen
[1:35:58] because obviously God the audience - how
[1:36:00] does he got a notice he got on the
[1:36:02] acoustic guitar under C got on the
[1:36:05] no honestly got the pulpit I wanna see
[1:36:07] godly computer honestly got in the back
[1:36:09] chair we want to see God in the audience
[1:36:11] amen we want to see God everywhere no
[1:36:19] these are seasons because remember Paul
[1:36:21] even pause to go through seasons where
[1:36:23] he hated his shortcomings for we know
[1:36:26] that lost spiritual and I'm carnal
[1:36:27] sunderson for that which I do I allow
[1:36:29] not for what I would that I do not but
[1:36:33] what I hate that I do if then I do that
[1:36:37] which I would not I can set unto the law
[1:36:39] that it's good so Paul went through
[1:36:41] times he he loved the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:43] in his soul but he hated this this
[1:36:45] whatever sin it was a besetting sin he
[1:36:48] would actually do that instead he hated
[1:36:51] it but he would do it now that is no
[1:36:55] more I that do it but sin that dwelleth
[1:36:56] in me so he realized this is not
[1:36:58] something my soul wants to do this sin
[1:37:01] is trapped inside my members in other
[1:37:03] words that made him belong to one a new
[1:37:05] body amen Gouri the more you saw this
[1:37:08] sin trapped in his body the more he
[1:37:10] wanted that sin swallowed up in life
[1:37:12] amen for I know that in me that is in my
[1:37:16] flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will
[1:37:21] is present with me but how to perform
[1:37:22] that which is good I find not I might
[1:37:26] look like a good pastor I might be a
[1:37:28] good friend of you but I tell you when
[1:37:29] I'm all alone and I'm there's times I
[1:37:31] hate what's inside of this guy right
[1:37:32] here I hate it I look down to myself and
[1:37:35] say what am i doing how could I think
[1:37:37] that how could I say that how could I do
[1:37:39] that what's wrong with me but I'm just
[1:37:40] like Paul I do it but I hate it I love
[1:37:44] the things of God but I do things that I
[1:37:46] hate amen
[1:37:48] but next time I'll get the victory amen
[1:37:51] hallelujah so he had to recognize it's
[1:37:55] not and I had to tell it to haven
[1:37:57] Haman's Haven was asking me this morning
[1:37:58] about you know when you sin or notice
[1:38:01] yesterday she's asked me about I said
[1:38:03] honey when you sin it's not you I said
[1:38:05] it just your flesh because the Bible
[1:38:08] said the seat of God doesn't sin
[1:38:09] remember first John if the seed of God's
[1:38:12] in you it doesn't sin Paul says you sent
[1:38:15] in your flesh and your mind
[1:38:18] your flesh and your spirit that's where
[1:38:20] you sin but you don't sit in your soul
[1:38:22] that's God's seed that's God's nature
[1:38:24] that's the and everything that's in you
[1:38:26] all your let's say all the gifts you
[1:38:28] ever use all the healings you ever see
[1:38:29] all the other Americans ever see it's
[1:38:31] already in that seat yeah glory now the
[1:38:38] Bible says you must hate others sin so
[1:38:40] much that you go try to reach out to
[1:38:41] them this is where I need help this
[1:38:43] where we all need help because we don't
[1:38:44] want to fend people but we need to be
[1:38:46] led of the Holy Spirit keep yourselves
[1:38:48] in the love of God looking for the mercy
[1:38:49] of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal
[1:38:51] life and of some have compassion making
[1:38:54] a difference so see you can't have
[1:38:57] compassion on everyone there's not
[1:38:58] enough time in your day my brother man
[1:39:00] almost killed himself by praying for so
[1:39:02] many people going without brakes he had
[1:39:04] to learn to take breaks it was in 1949
[1:39:07] he almost died he had to take a break he
[1:39:09] was six months off the field and they
[1:39:11] started up meetings back in January 1950
[1:39:13] right and that's when the pillar fire
[1:39:15] came a little break he had amen see he
[1:39:19] thought and memory you can hear on tape
[1:39:21] brother Ram says anytime you need me he
[1:39:24] said call me this is before his break he
[1:39:26] said call me I'll be there rain or shine
[1:39:28] and he did but then he had to find out
[1:39:30] later no I can't do that
[1:39:31] because I'll kill myself and God doesn't
[1:39:34] want me to kill myself I said last week
[1:39:36] on weeks ago God want you to have
[1:39:37] vacation God doesn't want you to kill
[1:39:40] yourself you have to balance and if some
[1:39:44] have compassion making a difference you
[1:39:45] can't have compassion on everybody and
[1:39:47] others save with fear pulling them out
[1:39:50] of the fire hating even the garment
[1:39:52] spotted by the flesh now that's how you
[1:39:54] should feel you should hate to see your
[1:39:56] loved ones dabbling in sin right or your
[1:40:00] friends you should hate to see friends
[1:40:02] dabbling around with sin the Bible said
[1:40:04] you should hate that and that should
[1:40:06] cause you and movie to have compassion
[1:40:08] and try to make a difference in their
[1:40:10] life right can I help you do you need a
[1:40:13] Bible can I pray for you do you want one
[1:40:15] of my pastors books about modesty you
[1:40:16] want a message companion book anything
[1:40:18] try to help try to have compassion can I
[1:40:20] put a prayer request in for you you need
[1:40:22] some money need some food we need to
[1:40:24] have compassion trying to help people
[1:40:26] amen all right now
[1:40:31] here's what was special about Jesus I'm
[1:40:33] the Bible said David wrote about well
[1:40:35] you know what was special about him he
[1:40:37] loved righteousness and he hated
[1:40:38] iniquity uh-huh now here it is because
[1:40:43] Jesus hate iniquity that was the key to
[1:40:46] his anointing because the Bible said
[1:40:48] therefore because he hates sin therefore
[1:40:51] God anointed with the oil gladness above
[1:40:54] his fellows amen if we look for more
[1:41:00] more noisy means more hatred so we live
[1:41:11] [Music]
[1:41:13] therefore I'll anoint him above
[1:41:16] everybody else because he hates iniquity
[1:41:20] thank you Jesus see that's why maybe
[1:41:24] some some sermons brother brother amen
[1:41:27] brother Aaron some sermons got more
[1:41:29] anointing than others but we don't
[1:41:40] really know anything maybe people
[1:41:41] haven't been hatin sin like down too
[1:41:43] but that's okay we're patient right we
[1:41:45] love each other we're a body we eat each
[1:41:47] other there's their seasons for cleaning
[1:41:49] to praise God their season the Wren
[1:41:52] their season the show glory amen
[1:41:54] their seasons but see the more we hate
[1:41:58] sin the more God anoints us here's a
[1:42:05] bold claim this is this is pretty
[1:42:06] powerful
[1:42:07] he's talked about Christ in the church
[1:42:08] so ought men to love their wives as
[1:42:10] their own bodies he's at love with his
[1:42:12] life loveth himself for no man ever yet
[1:42:15] hated his own flesh there's never been a
[1:42:18] man that hate his flesh you say what
[1:42:20] about a suicide guy well that wasn't him
[1:42:22] that was the devil doing that that man
[1:42:25] treated he washed his body he combed his
[1:42:28] hair brushed his teeth he put on
[1:42:31] deodorant he took care of himself he
[1:42:33] didn't hate his body because the Bible
[1:42:36] said every man nourish and cherish his
[1:42:38] body even as the Lord the church you say
[1:42:41] what about a scruffy old man a hundred
[1:42:42] up in the woods he still feeds his body
[1:42:45] he's got he still lays in a soft bed
[1:42:48] somewhere he don't lay on spikes and
[1:42:50] stones and scratching his back he's no
[1:42:53] man never hate his flesh but see we've
[1:42:56] got to learn to hate it we got to learn
[1:43:01] to hate sin that dwells in our flesh and
[1:43:04] obey the Holy Spirit I'm almost done
[1:43:08] bear with me here this was a lot of the
[1:43:12] scriptures and the Bible actually talked
[1:43:13] about this that's why I put a lot in
[1:43:14] here this book actually first John deals
[1:43:16] with this
[1:43:16] he's assay if he's in the light and the
[1:43:18] message and hated this brother he's in
[1:43:20] darkness even till now well I believe
[1:43:23] the message but I hate this church I
[1:43:25] hate that you don't have the light yet
[1:43:27] from you he that loveth his brother
[1:43:29] abideth in the light and there's none
[1:43:31] occasion of stumbling in him but he said
[1:43:32] hey this brother is in darkness and
[1:43:34] walks in darkness and knoweth not
[1:43:36] whither he goes because the darkness has
[1:43:38] blinded his eyes hatred blinds people's
[1:43:40] eyes because he says later you can't
[1:43:53] hate a man and then that you can see aim
[1:43:58] in other words however you treat the
[1:44:00] people you see that's how you treat God
[1:44:02] amen Marvel not my brethren if the world
[1:44:05] hates you people some years let him hang
[1:44:07] around and see how much they love
[1:44:09] everybody after a few years right we've
[1:44:12] seen people would hang around our church
[1:44:13] for years and years here's I'm pretty
[1:44:14] soon it's a little bit bitterness may
[1:44:16] come in a little bit of hatred so that's
[1:44:19] why this church is the best place to
[1:44:21] stay and love everybody amen whatever
[1:44:24] Church God calls you stay there love
[1:44:25] them stay there decade after decade
[1:44:27] forgive 70 times 7 amen none of you have
[1:44:31] ever forgiven me 490 times have you if
[1:44:34] so yeah let me know about it that's a
[1:44:37] big number 490 times forgive somebody
[1:44:41] that's how you know you pass from death
[1:44:43] on the life you can forgive those that
[1:44:45] you used to hate amen whosoever hateth
[1:44:49] his brother is a murderer and you know
[1:44:51] that no murderer hath eternal life
[1:44:53] abiding in him
[1:44:57] there is no fear in love but perfect
[1:45:00] love casts out fear because fear hath
[1:45:02] torment he that feareth is not made
[1:45:03] perfect in love we love him because he
[1:45:05] first loved us if a man say oh I love
[1:45:08] God I love Jesus and hate his brother
[1:45:10] he's a liar there's a lot of church
[1:45:13] splits brother William seen him I've
[1:45:14] seen him we've seen Jose seen a lot of
[1:45:16] the church foots but and people hate
[1:45:18] each other when they split you can't
[1:45:21] love God and hate your brother
[1:45:23] we're either loveth not his brother whom
[1:45:25] he has seen how can you love God whom
[1:45:28] you've not seen in other words your love
[1:45:31] for God is seen through the people that
[1:45:34] you see amen everybody sees your love on
[1:45:38] how you treat the people that you see
[1:45:40] hey you can't be good you don't know
[1:45:45] right I can't treat you good I don't
[1:45:47] love God I can't love you and forgive
[1:45:50] you and pray for you and help you if I
[1:45:52] can't love you I can't love God because
[1:45:55] we can't love someone invisible if we
[1:45:56] can't love the visible and this
[1:46:02] commandment have we from him that he who
[1:46:04] loveth God loveth his brother also hey
[1:46:08] I'm trying to get let me see where I got
[1:46:10] I'm almost there I feel bad like I'm
[1:46:12] going too long
[1:46:12] I'm almost there yeah the false church
[1:46:15] is filled with hate not but not us right
[1:46:17] because the Bible said they're full of
[1:46:19] hateful birds you listen to a Catholic
[1:46:22] sometime I'm listening to someone you
[1:46:23] listen to him at all let's just listen
[1:46:25] for a while see what's going to come out
[1:46:26] of our mouth if this is scriptural
[1:46:30] they're gonna hate a lot of things that
[1:46:32] they shouldn't hate because they're full
[1:46:35] of it that's the mother and she got
[1:46:37] daughters just give people a little
[1:46:40] while you listen to them pretty soon I
[1:46:42] start talk about all the things they
[1:46:43] hate all the things going wrong in my
[1:46:44] life all the bad things the Bible says
[1:46:47] and everything give thanks for this is
[1:46:49] the will of God in Christ Jesus amen we
[1:46:52] all struggle we all go through trials
[1:46:53] but we all got it all turn around the
[1:46:55] right season see it's hateful they're
[1:46:58] full of hatred in the foster but we're
[1:47:00] full of love amen or love for the word
[1:47:06] love a lot of love for sin we got love
[1:47:09] for the word
[1:47:10] yes yeah I think I have some quotes on
[1:47:16] that I put my thoughts in there
[1:47:18] sometimes I forgot to go through that
[1:47:19] take them out yeah I mentioned that yeah
[1:47:24] Bob Ram said people actually love the
[1:47:25] devil programs reading X's 21 verse 5
[1:47:30] and we preached on this recently with
[1:47:32] the man who took the all if the servant
[1:47:34] we didn't want to go free the Jubilee he
[1:47:36] take a halt this is that text right here
[1:47:37] and if the servant that's the man that
[1:47:39] was to be free shall say plainly I love
[1:47:42] my master and now here's what uses that
[1:47:47] for today oh I like to go to dances I
[1:47:50] had given up my dances for nobody I
[1:47:53] ain't giving up this or that or other
[1:47:54] nobody my wife my children this earth
[1:47:57] and I love now look here brother Graham
[1:47:59] I'm gonna tell you do you mean I have to
[1:48:00] you have to stop nothing you just come
[1:48:03] in and it stops itself but you say well
[1:48:07] I wouldn't do that I'd I don't have to
[1:48:09] do that I belong to church I'm just as
[1:48:10] good as you or anybody else
[1:48:11] all right brother that's all right you
[1:48:13] hear what's the truth what I listen here
[1:48:15] ain't father son Holy Ghost just as good
[1:48:17] well if you want to keep to that way you
[1:48:19] just go right ahead you've heard what
[1:48:21] you heard that trumpet sounded and you
[1:48:23] heard a note of given the Bible said Oh
[1:48:25] God look at that wouldn't that make for
[1:48:27] a text right now in the next hour if the
[1:48:29] trumpet give an uncertain sound for if
[1:48:32] your denomination says polish and only
[1:48:33] ghost that no sound like the trumpet if
[1:48:35] the trumpet gives the uncertain sound
[1:48:37] who shall prepare himself for war now he
[1:48:40] reads it again and the servant shall say
[1:48:43] I love my master I don't want to be free
[1:48:45] the Holy Ghost and he says this is what
[1:48:47] people are really saying I love the
[1:48:48] devil that's making me do these things
[1:48:51] that's making me hate my brother I love
[1:48:54] it oh that's making me do this sexual
[1:48:57] sin I love the devil that's making me so
[1:49:00] afraid they love those things so program
[1:49:04] uses that time I'd rather stay with my
[1:49:06] master where people are saying that
[1:49:08] today I'd rather stay with the devil he
[1:49:12] says and I think you're too narrow mind
[1:49:13] up there
[1:49:13] I just think you're too narrow all right
[1:49:15] I love the things I think about to have
[1:49:16] these big things like this have dances
[1:49:18] Bunco in the church things like that all
[1:49:20] good time they're just as good as any a
[1:49:22] bunch guys but there
[1:49:23] all right all right he says and I will
[1:49:25] not go out seeing the freedom of the
[1:49:27] Spirit you talk about so going free of
[1:49:29] the Jubilee is freedom in the Holy
[1:49:31] Spirit and then his master the devil
[1:49:33] shall bring him to the judges and should
[1:49:35] also bring him to the door what
[1:49:37] who's the door congregation says Jesus
[1:49:39] Christ I set before you a door when did
[1:49:42] that mark of the beast come in this age
[1:49:44] where the door was sent the final
[1:49:46] marking of the Beast and how do we know
[1:49:50] that we have life is because we hate sin
[1:49:53] and we hate sin so bad till we know that
[1:49:56] death associates there and we shun the
[1:49:59] very appearance of it any way we can get
[1:50:00] affront away from it we jump run
[1:50:03] anything that we can do to try to keep
[1:50:05] away from from sin because sin has death
[1:50:07] in it and we sure don't want to
[1:50:08] associate anything in death we want to
[1:50:10] keep away from that man so he was
[1:50:13] talking to young Christians the day
[1:50:14] before he said if you were standing out
[1:50:16] there on the road and the car was coming
[1:50:17] down the road at 90 miles an hour out of
[1:50:19] control you would get out of that
[1:50:21] highway as quick as you could you jump
[1:50:25] slide you anything to get away that car
[1:50:27] and that's the way sin should be to a
[1:50:29] Christian because sin is associated with
[1:50:34] death and as soon as you see sin in any
[1:50:36] form jump from it get away from it I
[1:50:38] don't care what you have to do get away
[1:50:40] from the very appearance of evil because
[1:50:41] remember yes to associate with sin is
[1:50:45] death just the same as standing there
[1:50:47] and let a car strike you don't just wait
[1:50:52] and see what it'll do get out of the way
[1:50:53] the very appearance of evil shut it
[1:50:55] quickly then you see a temptation coming
[1:50:58] up you know it's if something's wrong
[1:51:00] that death is lurking after you see then
[1:51:02] get away from it just as quick as you
[1:51:04] would get away from my autumn will be
[1:51:05] approaching at 90 miles per hour see
[1:51:07] you'd want to get away from it right
[1:51:09] quick out of the way jump slide run just
[1:51:12] get away from it let's say into our feet
[1:51:14] by God's grace amen praise God gotta get
[1:51:20] away from it now the next time we look
[1:51:21] at warm peace there's national Wars
[1:51:24] peace treaties within their spiritual
[1:51:27] Wars
[1:51:28] so what close of that one next time by
[1:51:30] the grace of God how many love the Lord
[1:51:31] today we looked at a lot love and hate
[1:51:35] today
[1:51:37] we looked at seasons and musicians I'm
[1:51:38] sorry musicians you can come look at
[1:51:41] these seasons of love and hatred let's
[1:51:45] just bow our heads here I think the
[1:51:46] thought that you know I felt the Holy
[1:51:48] Spirit dealing with a lot was do we love
[1:51:51] all of our brothers and sisters do we
[1:51:53] hold any grudges against anyone do you
[1:51:56] have any roots of bitterness is there
[1:51:59] any sin that we love that we shouldn't
[1:52:01] love remember comes in any form and
[1:52:05] Satan just lurking around waiting to
[1:52:09] come around and try to knock somebody
[1:52:11] over right like Bob em said hit somebody
[1:52:13] with a ninety mile per hour car they
[1:52:15] come so fast don't they become so fast
[1:52:19] Satan is lurking around he's watching
[1:52:22] your behavior he's testing you he's
[1:52:23] tempting you and then the temptation
[1:52:27] will come so fast
[1:52:29] [Music]
[1:52:31] how many would say brother Jesse pray
[1:52:33] for me that I'll learn to hate Church I
[1:52:49] hope you're encouraged that you know God
[1:52:51] is the God of the audiences
