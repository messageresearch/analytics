[0:00] but on the internet I didn't put it as a
[0:01] part two because I want to focus more on
[0:03] this idea of we depart from iniquity and
[0:07] on the same lines of we are not the
[0:09] workers of iniquity so I want to take
[0:10] tonight and I want to look at that uh
[0:12] chain of scriptures down through the
[0:14] Bible Matthew 721 you have your
[0:21] Bible Matthew 7:21 by the grace of God
[0:32] and then we'll go back to 2 Timothy
[0:35] 2:9 Matthew 7:21 some have called this
[0:38] the scariest scripture in the Bible now
[0:41] we don't have uh fear of man right but
[0:43] we fear the Lord hallelujah and it just
[0:46] makes us sober as Christians you know we
[0:47] we we trust we're saved we believe we're
[0:49] saved we confess we're saved uh but we
[0:51] look at this scripture soberly and the
[0:53] Bible says Paul says examine yourself he
[0:56] said to make sure you're in the faith
[0:58] Hallelujah he he said either Jesus
[1:01] Christ is in you or your reprobate which
[1:03] means rejected so you either have the
[1:05] spirit of God working on you in one of
[1:07] the three stages of Grace justification
[1:09] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11] which is new spirit my spirit I'm sorry
[1:14] uh uh new spirit uh I'm sorry new heart
[1:17] new spirit my spirit so the spirit of
[1:20] God is in you working in one of those
[1:21] Realms or a person is rejected so we
[1:24] want the spirit of God to deal with us
[1:25] hallelujah no matter where we are on our
[1:28] spiritual journey we want the spirit of
[1:29] God God to woo us with his love
[1:31] Hallelujah Clean us out make us pure
[1:34] Hallelujah Matthew
[1:39] 7:21 turn there my
[1:46] Bible now I'll read 2122 then we I'll
[1:49] read 23 not everyone that saith unto me
[1:53] Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom
[1:55] of heaven but he that doeth the will of
[1:58] my father which is in heaven praise God
[2:01] that's that's the heart of Christianity
[2:03] I don't want to do my will I want to do
[2:05] God's will that's how we all feel verse
[2:09] 22 many not a few but many will say to
[2:11] me in that day Lord Lord have we not
[2:14] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[2:17] have cast out Devils so that's balum
[2:19] Judas are some examples there prophesy
[2:22] it's correct casting out Devils Judas
[2:25] and in thy name done many wonderful
[2:27] works so any of the nine gifts of the
[2:29] Holy Spirit there any of the five
[2:31] preaching
[2:32] gifts in verse 23 let's read that 1 2 3
[2:36] and then will I profess unto them I
[2:39] never knew you depart from me ye that
[2:43] work iniquity all right let's go to
[2:45] Second
[2:47] Timothy 2:19 2 Timothy 21:19
[3:07] so tying these verses together we're
[3:09] looking at the word of course iniquity
[3:10] we depart from iniquity that's my
[3:11] thought for tonight but it's just like a
[3:13] part
[3:14] two let's read that on three ready one
[3:17] two 3 nevertheless the foundation of God
[3:21] standeth sure having this seal the Lord
[3:25] knoweth them that are his and let
[3:28] everyone that nameth the name of Christ
[3:31] depart from iniquity may God add his
[3:34] Blessing to the reading of his word you
[3:35] can be seated by God's grace appreciate
[3:37] your honor and respect for the word of
[3:40] God
[3:41] hallelujah we're very thankful that God
[3:44] knows us hallelujah God knows them that
[3:46] are his hallelujah it's a real blessing
[3:49] uh to have that understanding and that
[3:52] knowledge and church how many of you
[3:54] feel like uh one of the sheep that Jesus
[3:56] left the 99 and you feel like you're the
[3:57] one he left all the 99 to go get that
[4:00] one how many feel like you're that one
[4:01] Hallelujah I know that for sure in my
[4:03] life I was running far from God and who
[4:06] came looking for me Jesus came looking
[4:08] for me Hallelujah so all of us should
[4:09] have that awareness in our lives we
[4:12] remember the time when Jesus came
[4:14] running to us and what did he do he
[4:15] threw us on his shoulders and brought us
[4:17] into the fold Hallelujah brought us back
[4:19] what a blessing what a promise
[4:21] Hallelujah so I want to look here
[4:22] tonight let's just I want to Define
[4:24] iniquity by the uh the Lexicon and then
[4:26] how brother random gives us like a more
[4:28] simplified uh version of it uh in in the
[4:31] in the Lexicon um iniquity means
[4:36] illegality which is a violation of the
[4:39] law or wickedness so it's like a
[4:41] purposeful transgression of the law okay
[4:45] so iniquity is uh you purposely violate
[4:48] the law on purpose right uh and it's to
[4:52] transgress iniquity wickedness okay
[4:55] brother random uh says it like this
[4:57] iniquity is something that you're going
[5:00] out and you do it and you know you
[5:03] oughtn't to have done it
[5:07] Hallelujah now uh we all could take a
[5:10] few moments if if we wanted to and think
[5:12] of just this past week did we do
[5:13] something that we knew we should not
[5:15] have done did we kind of bend the truth
[5:17] a little bit on a lie did we take
[5:20] something that wasn't exactly ours we
[5:22] didn't maybe ask for it do we Harbor an
[5:25] evil thought and do we maybe text
[5:27] something or email something we probably
[5:29] should not have said
[5:30] uh did we watch something we should not
[5:32] have watched we all can look at our
[5:34] lives and and recognize you know we have
[5:36] iniquities in our life but the beautiful
[5:39] promise and this is the quote brother
[5:40] Ram gives us the same quote he says uh
[5:43] but don't forget the benefits to being a
[5:46] Christian David cried forget not all his
[5:49] benefits bless the Lord oh my soul in
[5:52] Psalm 103 verses 2 through three 2-5 and
[5:56] all that is within me bless His holy
[5:58] name bless the Lord oh my soul and
[6:00] forget not all of his benefits brother
[6:02] says benefits what is a benefit in the
[6:05] journey and he says this who forgives
[6:08] all mine
[6:10] iniquity if he did it under the blood of
[6:12] bulls and goats surely it's even better
[6:14] under the blood of Jesus Christ
[6:16] Hallelujah and then brother R gives that
[6:18] definition iniquity is something you're
[6:20] going out you do it and you know you
[6:23] oughtn't to have done it but he forgives
[6:26] it you ask him he forgives you amen
[6:30] hallelujah it's that simple right it's
[6:31] such a simple transaction you repent you
[6:34] ask for forgiveness he gives it to you
[6:36] freely Hallelujah he said forgives all
[6:38] of my iniquity heals all of my diseases
[6:42] hallelujah what a promise amen so we can
[6:45] see the simple definition there you know
[6:47] as I Was preparing this uh sermon I had
[6:48] numerous thoughts and so I guess the
[6:51] thought the the kind of Direction I want
[6:53] to go is I've been you know reading
[6:55] through I read through Ezekiel Jeremiah
[6:56] the last few months and now I'm in
[6:58] lamentation so my mind has been on you
[7:00] know Jerusalem's destruction so I want
[7:02] to just briefly go through the
[7:03] destruction of Jerusalem by
[7:05] Nebuchadnezzar around 585 BC around 585
[7:09] BC and church if you pull up
[7:12] Lamentations 4:6 AAA I just want to just
[7:14] review this briefly so you have an
[7:16] understanding um remember uh uh David
[7:20] said this is the city of the great king
[7:22] we sing about it great is the Lord and
[7:24] greatly to be praised and uh the B David
[7:26] called it the joy of the whole earth and
[7:29] it was beautiful under David's day but
[7:30] in Solomon's day it was even more
[7:32] magnificent all the gold and the
[7:35] Magnificent uh uh reflection of the the
[7:37] sunlight on the gold all the gold and
[7:40] and the brass and Solomon's uh beautiful
[7:42] magnificent Temple but the reason God
[7:45] destroyed it and God destroyed it some
[7:48] uh 300 it's either
[7:50] 345 or 355 years after Solomon started
[7:55] building Pagan temples in Jerusalem God
[7:59] gave him window over there about
[8:01] 345 or 355 years and when they wouldn't
[8:05] repent now that's almost the 400 years
[8:07] kind of like uh uh with uh Abraham God
[8:10] told Abraham you know the cup of of the
[8:12] iniquity of the amorites wasn't full yet
[8:14] he gave them 400 more
[8:17] years so why did God destroy Jerusalem
[8:20] verse uh lamentation 4:6 tells us for
[8:23] the punishment of the
[8:26] iniquity of the daughter of my people is
[8:29] is greater than the punishment of the
[8:32] sin of Sodom that was overthrown and as
[8:35] in a moment and no hands stayed on
[8:38] her so uh the the the writer of
[8:41] lamentation says Jerusalem's destruction
[8:44] was worse than Sodom and gomorrah's
[8:46] destruction I showed you the videos I
[8:48] showed you some pictures of last year
[8:50] about how the sulfur still is still in
[8:53] existence in the in the ruins of Sodom
[8:55] there the video's got over millions of
[8:57] views and uh the one guy took a little
[8:59] chunk of that sulfur burn it and lit it
[9:01] up and just burned right there and you
[9:03] can still see shapes of humans and
[9:05] shapes of buildings that are still there
[9:07] and they were destroyed in a moment's
[9:09] Time by fire and
[9:13] brimstone but but the holy spirit says
[9:17] God's destruction of Jerusalem was worse
[9:19] than
[9:21] that and so Adam Clark this is just his
[9:23] thought uh seemed like he said but uh
[9:26] Sodom was destroyed in a moment
[9:28] Jerusalem though they fell by the most
[9:31] lingering
[9:33] calamities so it's like the Judgment was
[9:35] coming and it wasn't fast it was slow
[9:38] like oh it's kind of foreshadowing here
[9:40] something's bad I can see it's getting
[9:42] closer and closer and the destruction is
[9:44] getting closer and it wasn't just
[9:46] something simple and fast it was a
[9:48] lingered out
[9:50] judgment because uh they were uh
[9:52] surrounded by King
[9:55] Nebuchadnezzar now he came uh he came
[9:58] there and uh as we said in 585 BC the
[10:01] actual destruction was made but it was
[10:03] either 18 or 30 months that
[10:06] Nebuchadnezzar used to try to weaken
[10:09] Jerusalem first he he put a Siege of
[10:12] soldiers all around uh Jerusalem so
[10:15] nothing could get in and nothing could
[10:16] go
[10:18] out so he put a Siege around him and
[10:21] then after a few short months there was
[10:24] a
[10:24] famine the Bible said in second Tim 2
[10:27] Kings 259 he burnt the house of the Lord
[10:31] and the King's house and all the houses
[10:33] of Jerusalem and all the houses of the
[10:35] Great Men burned he with fire reminds us
[10:37] of Los Angeles doesn't it Lamentations 4
[10:40] said said 4:10 said the hands of the
[10:42] pitiful women have sodden their own
[10:44] children they were their meat in the
[10:47] destruction of the daughter of my people
[10:50] so during The Siege the famine was so
[10:52] severe that people resorted to eating
[10:55] the little
[10:57] ones but they were warned about this in
[10:59] Deuteronomy
[11:01] 2853 God told them if you don't kill
[11:04] your enemy your enemy will kill you
[11:07] Church remind us reminds us we better
[11:09] destroy the demons that are trying to
[11:11] destroy us hallelujah and how do we
[11:13] destroy them cast them down rebuke them
[11:16] in Jesus Christ's name don't give in
[11:18] them don't feed them don't give them
[11:20] even a moment's look don't stop and
[11:21] think about it for just a second don't
[11:23] even give it any thoughts just run to
[11:25] God flee to Jesus Hallelujah get as far
[11:28] away as you possibly
[11:30] can so it was either 18 to 30 months it
[11:34] began in the ninth year of King
[11:36] zedekiah's Reign according to 2 Kings 25
[11:40] verse1 and then of course it went to
[11:42] famine and eventually uh
[11:45] desperation remember what you know the
[11:46] sad part is you know uh the the the very
[11:49] night where uh the the king got caught
[11:51] the Bible said all the men of War fled
[11:53] By Night by the way of the gate in the
[11:55] two walls these men left all the women
[11:57] and children behind
[11:59] not very manly doesn't sound like very
[12:01] manly
[12:02] right look what iniquity brings you down
[12:05] to this is what iniquity brings you down
[12:08] to right destroying your uh you know
[12:11] eating family members I know it's it's
[12:13] unheard of we would never even consider
[12:16] that but this is what happens to people
[12:18] that that God used to visit them 350
[12:21] years earlier God would visit them with
[12:22] a pillar of fire church the pillar of
[12:25] fire visited brother brandom hallelujah
[12:27] amen is that right amen the pillar of
[12:29] fire visits us hallelujah when God does
[12:32] a miracle God speaks something God does
[12:33] Supernatural it's as if the pillar of
[12:35] fire has visited us
[12:38] hallelujah but they got so used to not
[12:41] having the pillar of fire that they
[12:42] started compromising and worshiping
[12:45] other gods so uh the The Siege caused a
[12:48] famine and Desperation the F I'm sorry
[12:51] the city fell and was destroyed so about
[12:54] 18 to 30
[12:55] months and it was uh an awful awful
[13:00] destruction and what caused it Church
[13:03] iniquity now see we see it many ways too
[13:05] some sometimes people among us you know
[13:07] they'll they might fall Away really fast
[13:10] or it might be really
[13:12] slow people that live in iniquity right
[13:14] even amongst us or other message
[13:16] churches you know I talk to lots of
[13:17] pastors right and I hear they they
[13:19] experience the same thing people uh can
[13:22] can just instantly just turn on them
[13:25] right and take the wrong Spirit right or
[13:27] it just might be a slow kind of descent
[13:29] well first they don't come to the
[13:30] evening service and then they miss
[13:32] Wednesday and then they start changing
[13:35] the way they're dressing and you know
[13:37] and then they start changing the way
[13:38] they're
[13:39] talking and it's just a slow iniquity
[13:42] has a slow impact on other
[13:44] people or it can come very quick just
[13:47] like Sodom and Gomorrah but it was uh it
[13:50] was disastrous to see how all this uh
[13:53] could take place to a people that knew
[13:55] God a people that had prophets right
[13:59] people that had the pillar of fire
[14:01] Miracles
[14:03] worship and yet because of compromise
[14:06] see church as soon as Solomon built that
[14:07] first Pagan Temple that was the first
[14:10] step away and see once you allow one sin
[14:13] look then you can start allowing all the
[14:15] others so see you got to go back to that
[14:18] first one get rid of the first one
[14:20] makees you get rid of all the sin
[14:22] Hallelujah because it's so easy if you
[14:24] just compromise on one thing well then I
[14:26] can just start doing that and I can just
[14:28] start doing that that's clearly works of
[14:31] iniquity Hallelujah but we we want to
[14:34] live in a way where God can forgive our
[14:36] iniquity because we'll confess our
[14:38] iniquity we'll take the idols out of our
[14:40] Lives we'll make the land clean again
[14:43] Hallelujah so what iniquities did uh
[14:46] Israel commit you know as I said I've
[14:47] been reading through lots of
[14:49] uh books here and they're all related to
[14:52] the same thing here with
[14:53] jermiah many many evils in Jeremiah 2:
[14:57] 13 He said my people have committed two
[14:59] evils they forsaken me the Fountain of
[15:02] Living Water imagine leaving a beautiful
[15:04] Fountain of water to go drink on some uh
[15:07] Dead uh dirty stinking water corrupt
[15:10] water you leave the Fountain of Living
[15:12] Water to go drink some diseased water or
[15:17] just worse than that anything you could
[15:18] imagine this is the first evil they
[15:20] forsook God they left God and then they
[15:23] hewed to themselves sists broken sists
[15:27] that can hold no water so they tried to
[15:29] create sisters that could hold their own
[15:31] water see create their own religion but
[15:34] see it couldn't hold water right it uh
[15:37] it was a broken system right their lives
[15:41] couldn't their lives couldn't contain uh
[15:43] even the sin right it was just like a
[15:44] leaking sstn but see uh the believer has
[15:48] a a Fountain of Living Water brother man
[15:51] said you've got a gushing stream all the
[15:53] time that you have access to if you want
[15:55] to drink from God's spirit Hallelujah
[15:58] you have access has to it all the time
[15:59] praise God you can drink from The
[16:02] Fountains of life amen what a
[16:06] blessing and as I turn the pages you
[16:08] know
[16:10] uh idolatry is a huge
[16:13] one uh and God Called It lovers it's as
[16:17] if every one of their Idols was a
[16:19] different lover that they loved other
[16:22] than God they forsook loving God and
[16:24] they took all these other lovers I love
[16:27] what God promises though in Jeremiah 322
[16:29] I preach it when I preach the
[16:30] backsliding series return ye backsliding
[16:33] children and I'll heal your backslidings
[16:35] behold we come unto thee for thou art
[16:37] the Lord Our God so see God will heal if
[16:41] we return hallelujah what a promise that
[16:44] he gives us now it's interesting in
[16:46] chapter 4 there's makeup and face
[16:48] painting in verse 30 Jeremiah
[16:52] 4:30 you see so many sins in here look
[16:55] idolatry uh the wrong uh uh marriages
[16:59] you see face
[17:00] painting uh you see their uh when they
[17:03] got rich and they got more money that's
[17:06] when they fell into sin's traps I call
[17:09] it the prosperity trap because I
[17:10] probably heard somebody say that before
[17:11] it's not I didn't coin that okay uh
[17:14] that's in Jeremiah 5: 2728 and
[17:18] 29 when they became wax and Rich they
[17:21] were wax and fat they forgot the
[17:24] fatherless they forgot the
[17:27] needy and then their Prophet started
[17:29] prophesying falsely they started
[17:31] believing false
[17:33] prophecies Hallelujah and the the
[17:35] amazing thing is that the people loved
[17:38] to have it so they loved lies I'm just
[17:42] amazed these false prophets online they
[17:44] they they they tried to uh make Co stop
[17:47] and in the name of the Lord it didn't
[17:49] happen in other words these people are
[17:50] getting all these lies and they keep
[17:52] giving them
[17:53] money it's because they they love the
[17:55] emotion of it because they they they
[17:57] know he's in sin and he's living in sin
[17:59] and if as long as he lives in sin then I
[18:01] can live in sin too I'm going to keep
[18:03] supporting him because he's uh he's
[18:05] living in sin and I like sin too see
[18:07] because he's tickling their itching ears
[18:09] letting them marry two three times and
[18:10] who knows what else my goodness the
[18:13] Bible said he said God's people Israel
[18:15] love to have it so they love false pre
[18:19] Preachers and Prophets we don't love
[18:21] them here
[18:22] hallelujah we love real preachers here
[18:24] hallelujah real prophets here like
[18:26] William Brandon was a real prophet of
[18:28] God hallelujah
[18:29] that's what we love here hallelujah he
[18:31] even even speaks of the reprobate mind
[18:33] in Jeremiah uh 6:30 reprobate and silver
[18:36] shall men call them because the Lord
[18:38] hath rejected
[18:40] them remember God tells Jeremiah not to
[18:43] pray for Israel in Jeremiah 7: 16
[18:47] therefore pray thou not for this
[18:50] people now look idolatry was a family
[18:54] affair look at uh Jeremiah uh 7:18 the
[18:58] children gather the wood the fathers
[19:00] Kindle the fire and the women need their
[19:02] dough to make cakes to the Queen of
[19:06] Heaven so it's a family affair and
[19:08] that's how it is today the little
[19:10] children will get their little Nintendo
[19:11] devices and worship those games and they
[19:14] don't teach them nothing about
[19:16] Jesus right and then the dads got their
[19:18] porn or whatever they got and the moms
[19:20] got their gossip I'm just throwing
[19:21] things out there they got their Shopify
[19:23] whatever you know who knows what they
[19:24] who the men got their tools and they
[19:26] worship their Tools in their trucks you
[19:28] know you know you know what I'm saying
[19:29] everybody's got their own Idols it don't
[19:32] have to be one particular thing but see
[19:33] it was a family affair everybody partook
[19:36] in
[19:37] that somebody should have stood up and
[19:39] said no we're K we're taking this Idol
[19:41] out of the house let's serve God
[19:44] hallelujah let's let's serve a real
[19:46] living God let's drink from the fountain
[19:48] Hallelujah of Living Waters Hallelujah
[19:52] but nobody did very few people did the
[19:55] one time this is pretty great in uh
[19:57] Jeremiah 7:29 the one time God told
[20:00] people to cut their hair was when they
[20:03] were full of idolatry and
[20:06] iniquity so you you you'll never find a
[20:08] verse where God ask a Godly woman to cut
[20:11] her hair but God does tell them in
[20:13] iniquity and this one you can't even
[20:15] tell if it's a male or female right so
[20:18] it's so it's so uh vague God never asked
[20:21] a Christian or Jewish woman to cut her
[20:23] hair if she's a Godly woman verse 29 he
[20:26] said cut off thine hair oh Jerusalem so
[20:28] he's speaking to the whole City oh
[20:29] Jerusalem and cast it away take up a
[20:31] lamentation on high places for the Lord
[20:33] hath rejected and forsaken the
[20:34] generation of the rest did they no but
[20:37] yet look at Nineveh Nineveh would repent
[20:39] in dust and Ashes a bunch of
[20:42] heathens right this is why Jerusalem got
[20:45] the worst judgment because they knew
[20:47] even better they they the Bible said
[20:49] Angels uh ministered and brought them uh
[20:51] the word of God Moses brought it down on
[20:54] tables of stone written with the hand of
[20:56] God hallelujah they saw the pill of fire
[20:59] they saw the Miracles they saw the Red
[21:01] Sea cross but because they lived in
[21:04] iniquity they lived opposite to what
[21:05] they knew God gave them a greater
[21:08] judgment a long lasting drawn out rebuke
[21:12] and
[21:13] judgment man and I'm just flipping
[21:15] through here because I I I've written so
[21:17] much about it here uh in my Bible
[21:20] here just look at all the all the
[21:23] different uh sins that they
[21:27] commit let me skip
[21:31] ahead even hezekiah's son the son that
[21:34] he prayed for remember he prayed he said
[21:36] God accept my life even hezekiah's own
[21:38] son caused this destruction he had a big
[21:41] part in it in Jeremiah
[21:44] 154 isn't that something remember
[21:46] brother R tells us and the Bible said
[21:48] that was the permissive will of God God
[21:50] did a mighty miracle for Hezekiah but he
[21:52] should have died when God wanted to take
[21:54] him home because his son that grew up
[21:57] helped cause the destruction of
[22:00] Jerusalem look at verse four and I will
[22:03] cause them to be removed in the kingdoms
[22:04] of the Earth because of Manasseh the son
[22:06] of who see wanting a longer life wanting
[22:10] uh goods and and money and all these
[22:12] things that's not always God's will
[22:14] right look what it produced amen now was
[22:18] he sincere yes Hezekiah was extremely
[22:21] sincere but see wanting something other
[22:24] than the will of God is a is an awful
[22:26] thing we should not want the permiss the
[22:28] will of God we should want the perfect
[22:30] will of God hallelujah brother Chris you
[22:32] got a question
[22:37] brother yes oh
[22:39] yes yeah you can read the whole chapter
[22:41] brother you can see all the evil that he
[22:42] did I don't have that studied up here
[22:44] for tonight but yeah you could easily if
[22:47] you like have a Bible dictionary just
[22:48] type in Manasseh son of Hezekiah it
[22:50] would list all the things you could just
[22:51] do chat GTP too that's that's really
[22:54] handy I've been I've been getting a lot
[22:55] of good notes from JP as far as they
[22:57] give you gives a list the scriptures
[23:00] there so think of that you know even the
[23:02] permissive will of God now I'm going to
[23:04] jump ahead
[23:05] here Idols yeah let's go to chapter 19
[23:08] Idols in 19 ver4 because they forsaken
[23:11] me and estrange this place and have
[23:12] burned incense in it to the other gods
[23:15] whom neither they have they or nor their
[23:18] fathers have known nor the kings of
[23:19] Judah and have filled this place with
[23:21] the blood of Innocence so they're
[23:23] burning incense and then they're
[23:25] shedding innocent blood it's it's babies
[23:27] verse 5 they have built also upon the
[23:29] high places of Baal to burn their sons
[23:32] with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal
[23:34] which I commanded not nor spake it
[23:36] neither came it into my
[23:39] mind so because they sacrificed their
[23:41] children God tells them in verse nine
[23:43] you're going to eat your children look
[23:45] at verse n and I will cause them to eat
[23:47] the Flesh of their sons and their flesh
[23:49] of their daughters and they shall eat
[23:50] everyone the Flesh of his friend in The
[23:52] Siege in the straightness wherewith
[23:54] their enemies and they that seek their
[23:55] lives shall straighten them my goodness
[23:59] this is uh let's see 8855 this is 20
[24:02] years before it happened Jeremiah says
[24:03] thus sayith the Lord if you don't stop
[24:06] these abortions here's what you're going
[24:07] to do and I hate to repeat it but that's
[24:09] what that's what they're going to that
[24:10] 20 years look at this over and over
[24:12] again year after year Jeremiah warns
[24:13] them thus sayi the Lord thus say the
[24:15] Lord thus say the Lord they threw him in
[24:16] prison they threw him in a pit of mud
[24:18] and he almost died and God's like just
[24:21] stand there and speak it and Jeremiah's
[24:23] like I'm done preaching but he said but
[24:24] then a fire was burning like a fire
[24:26] burning up in my bones and I've got got
[24:28] to say what God's called me to
[24:31] say no doubt Jeremiah walk all around
[24:34] the Bible said Jeremiah would would go
[24:35] in there they'd be worshiping there in
[24:37] the temple of God and walk outside and
[24:39] there's temples erected that Solomon had
[24:41] erected to false gods burning children
[24:44] doing all these wicked things right
[24:45] outside there and he constantly was thus
[24:47] sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord
[24:49] thus sayith the Lord and they still
[24:51] wouldn't
[24:53] turn he was very
[24:56] sorrowful he even curses the day he was
[24:59] born he was so discouraged that they
[25:00] wouldn't listen to him I ought to be
[25:02] encouraged I got so many people that
[25:03] listen to my preaching I get so many
[25:05] people that come up and repent now for a
[25:07] small church I thank God for that but
[25:09] Jeremiah didn't get that he just had a
[25:12] few people that he was put in jail in
[25:14] chapter
[25:16] 20 and now church now look at verse 20
[25:19] verse 7 now here's God's grace on
[25:21] prophets look look look look at what he
[25:23] says Jeremiah 20:7 oh Lord thou Hast
[25:25] deceived me and I was deceived did God
[25:27] deceive Jeremiah
[25:28] no but see sometimes remember your
[25:31] words this is calling God a deceiver
[25:34] you're calling God a
[25:35] deceiver who said this
[25:38] Jeremiah Church in our Darkest Hours
[25:40] we'll utter the the most foolish
[25:46] things why he's in prison uh he he's
[25:49] rejected he's he's not getting fed and
[25:51] he was in prison multiple times do you
[25:53] know he was carried away at the end of
[25:54] his life to Egypt and died in Egypt
[25:56] didn't even die in The Promised Land
[25:59] for a prophet of God that we all look to
[26:02] no no wonder he's called uh The
[26:03] Sorrowing Prophet like Jesus
[26:06] was sorrow preaching thus sayi the Lord
[26:09] warning them don't do this to your
[26:10] children don't erect these Idols don't
[26:12] live like that don't do these things and
[26:14] yet people wouldn't take heed thank God
[26:16] that there uh thank God that there was a
[26:18] Jeremiah and Ezekiel hallelujah thank
[26:20] God that there was somebody Hallelujah
[26:22] that believe the word of God he curses
[26:25] the very day he was born in verse 14
[26:27] cursed be the day in where and I was
[26:28] bornn sound like sound familiar like
[26:31] job church sometimes Believers can get
[26:33] discouraged they don't see all the
[26:34] fruits of their Ministry oh but they're
[26:36] going to see it on the other side
[26:37] Hallelujah is that
[26:40] right God will reward them richly on the
[26:43] other side if they're faithful with the
[26:44] little God will make them rule over much
[26:49] hallelujah oh my you can just see all
[26:52] the all the wickedness of Jeremiah's uh
[26:56] generation yeah okay now so we see
[26:58] idolatry false worship of God child
[27:01] sacrifice to Pagan deities shedding
[27:04] innocent blood and violence they just
[27:05] let this go on sexual immorality and
[27:08] spiritual adultery they oppressed the
[27:10] poor the orphans and the widows no
[27:14] wonder God said don't even pray for
[27:15] these
[27:18] people and they desecrated the Sabbath
[27:20] in Ezekiel 20:8 but they rebelled
[27:22] against me and would not hearken unto me
[27:24] they did not every man Cast Away the
[27:26] Abominations of their eyes neither did
[27:28] they forsake the idols of Egypt then I
[27:30] said I will pour out my Fury upon them
[27:32] to accomplish my anger against them in
[27:33] the midst in the of the land of
[27:36] Egypt Hallelujah moreover verse uh 12
[27:41] Ezekiel 20:12 moreover also I gave them
[27:43] my Sabbath to be a sign between me and
[27:45] them that they might know that I am the
[27:47] Lord that sanctify them but the house of
[27:49] Israel rebelled against me in the
[27:50] wilderness they walk not in my statutes
[27:52] and they despise my judgments which if a
[27:55] man do he shall even live in them and my
[27:57] Sabbath they greatly polluted then I
[27:59] said I would pour out my Fury upon them
[28:01] in the wilderness to consume them it
[28:04] seems like everything God told them to
[28:06] do they did the
[28:08] opposite they refused to repent when a
[28:11] prophet gave them thus sayith the Lord
[28:12] Jeremiah 7:26 yet not they hearken not
[28:15] unto me nor inclin their ear but Harden
[28:17] their neck they did worse than their
[28:19] fathers now I've read this one before to
[28:21] you this is a beautiful scripture 2
[28:24] Chronicles 36:16
[28:28] let me turn there because there's a
[28:29] beautiful verse in there 2 Chronicles
[28:34] 36:16 you know You' you do yourself some
[28:37] real good church if you listen to
[28:38] brother brandom and then if he rebukes
[28:39] you on something go make it right go
[28:41] confess your sins that would do you some
[28:43] good that does me good Hallelujah 2
[28:47] Chronicles 36 because why it shows
[28:49] you're re you're you're accepting a
[28:52] prophet's word you're accepting the
[28:54] prophet that's why when I heard brother
[28:56] man say a man shouldn't have long hair
[28:58] quickly cut my hair by God's grace 2
[29:01] Chronicles
[29:05] 36:16 nobody ever told me that nobody
[29:07] preached that to
[29:08] me yeah verse let's do 15 15 is so
[29:11] beautiful it's been a while since I
[29:13] preach this and the Lord God of their
[29:15] fathers sent up sent to them by his
[29:17] Messengers rising up bee times and
[29:19] sending because he had compassion on his
[29:21] people and on his Dwelling Place he
[29:24] didn't God didn't send Jeremiah or
[29:25] brother Ram to bother us God sent
[29:27] brother in Jeremiah and Isaiah to show
[29:29] his compassion to us right to treat our
[29:33] children the right way to uh to worship
[29:35] the only thing that's worth worshiping
[29:37] Hallelujah to honor the Sabbath for us
[29:39] it's a Sunday don't work on Sunday honor
[29:41] Sunday Hallelujah give God a full day of
[29:43] worship praise
[29:46] God uh taking care of the poor the
[29:49] widows the people that really need it
[29:52] Hallelujah but instead of uh instead of
[29:55] them accepting the prophet what do they
[29:57] do to uh Jeremiah brother brandom Isaiah
[29:59] they mock The Messengers of God and
[30:02] despise his words and misuse His
[30:04] prophets until the Wrath of the Lord
[30:06] rose against his people till there was
[30:08] no
[30:11] remedy now Church what's interesting
[30:14] is Solomon set up his first Idol in
[30:16] either 345 or 35 I'm sorry in uh either
[30:20] uh
[30:21] 936 uh or is it 938
[30:25] ad and then uh Jerusalem was the
[30:28] destroyed in
[30:29] 585 uh BC so it either went 345 years
[30:34] till destruction came or
[30:36] 355 how many knows uh how long has our
[30:38] nation been going on we're coming up on
[30:41] 249 almost
[30:44] 250 well I'm starting at 1776 when we
[30:47] declared independence so I got out the I
[30:50] got the calculator
[30:52] today so we're already at 249
[30:56] years now think think of all the babies
[30:59] they killed what about America it's over
[31:01] 70
[31:02] million it's over 70 million and there's
[31:05] some reports I was rejoicing at first it
[31:07] seemed like it says there was less
[31:08] abortions now some Reports say now
[31:09] there's actually more abortions since
[31:11] roie Wade so I don't know what to think
[31:13] all I know is say God have mercy on us
[31:16] God have mercy on what you who you can
[31:18] it's hard to know who what to
[31:20] believe but that's why we put all of our
[31:23] trust in the word of God
[31:25] hallelujah so they had corrupt
[31:27] leadership corrupt priests corrupt false
[31:31] prophets and so because of this God had
[31:34] to send
[31:35] Nebuchadnezzar and Nebuchadnezzar
[31:37] destroyed the walls uh burnt the house
[31:40] of God burned it with fire and it was a
[31:43] slow like I said 36 to uh I'm sorry 18
[31:46] to 30 month process of just slowing
[31:48] everything gets worse and worse day by
[31:50] day day by day day by day until God
[31:53] destroys it God said that was worse than
[31:55] Sodom and Gomorrah God gave the religion
[31:58] people his own people that were supposed
[31:59] to be his people gave them a worse
[32:01] judgment than Sodom and
[32:03] Gomorrah because of iniquity they knew
[32:08] better now Church how many know God's so
[32:11] merciful in the New Testament Lydia
[32:13] found this verse put up Leviticus 20:1
[32:15] this was a great thought we're talking
[32:17] on Bible time I think on Sunday night
[32:19] Leviticus 20:1 because we've been
[32:20] preaching on the Corinthians series the
[32:22] man sleeping with his stepmom what would
[32:24] happen to that man in the Old
[32:25] Testament and the man that lieth with
[32:27] his father's wife hath uncovered his
[32:29] father's nakedness so see uh the
[32:32] husband's uh wife is called his
[32:35] nakedness because that's that's the
[32:37] marriage bed it's referring to that so A
[32:39] man that would uh take his father's wife
[32:42] or stepmother both of them shall be
[32:44] surely put to death their blood shall be
[32:47] upon them so if if that man in Corinth
[32:50] had been in the Old Testament just a few
[32:52] years earlier they had the right to take
[32:54] him out and stone
[32:56] him so in the old Testament you would
[32:58] deliver them to the Believers to Stone
[33:01] them but in the New Testament Paul says
[33:03] in 2 Corinthians 5:5 deliver them unto
[33:07] Satan for the destruction of the flesh
[33:09] so the Old Testament the Believers would
[33:11] take care of it in the New Testament God
[33:13] said let Satan take care of
[33:16] it
[33:19] Hallelujah so in one way it seems a
[33:21] little merciful now what what did it say
[33:22] in the New Testament that his soul might
[33:24] be saved so that that in that in itself
[33:27] is more merciful
[33:29] Hallelujah that God will use that to
[33:31] bring that one to repent so he can he or
[33:33] she could get
[33:34] saved
[33:36] hallelujah what a what a striking uh uh
[33:40] difference here in the Old Testament New
[33:43] Testament now let's look at some new uh
[33:45] Testament iniquities as well by God's
[33:52] grace verse uh Matthew
[33:55] 23:25 woe unto you scribes and Pharisees
[33:58] Hypocrites for you may clean the outside
[34:00] of the cup and of the platter but inward
[34:02] you're F of full of extortion and ex
[34:05] excess extortion of course money moneya
[34:08] laundering so they put on an outside
[34:11] show and act it all holy but they're
[34:13] Hypocrites Jesus said you wash the
[34:15] outside but inside you're filthy I
[34:18] appreciate everybody's clean modest
[34:19] clothes but what we want really want is
[34:21] your heart to be clean some of you make
[34:24] your hair so great I try to make mine
[34:25] clean too some of you make your face so
[34:28] shine somebody try to get that shirt
[34:30] just tucked in exactly the tie just just
[34:32] the right length we go to such lengths
[34:34] to make sure everything looks good on
[34:35] the outside God's looking at the inside
[34:38] Hallelujah he wants to make sure
[34:40] everything on the inside's in good
[34:42] order and that we're doing what we say
[34:45] we believe
[34:47] in right nothing's worse than a
[34:49] hypocrite we know that because Jesus
[34:50] said the HP the the Pharisees get
[34:52] greater
[34:53] damnation those that work iniquity right
[34:56] workers of iniquity get worse damnation
[35:00] now this is supposed to be an
[35:00] encouraging message it's coming across a
[35:01] little more rough than I thought you
[35:03] know I wasn't really you know sometimes
[35:04] I think it's going to come happy and
[35:06] then it comes rough sometimes going be
[35:07] rough and it comes happy or joyful
[35:09] that's that's a better
[35:10] word hallelujah
[35:13] now I want to look at this Matthew
[35:16] 24:12 and because iniquity shall abound
[35:19] the love of many shall wax cold here's a
[35:22] good indication when someone's living in
[35:25] iniquity they don't they don't have the
[35:27] love they used to have for others and
[35:29] the church
[35:31] said that's what Jesus said it's a clear
[35:33] sign when people live in iniquity they
[35:36] don't have the same love they maybe
[35:38] won't shake their hand like they used to
[35:40] they won't spend much time talking to
[35:42] you like they used to won't text you and
[35:45] try to encourage you or smile at you
[35:47] like they used to Something's Wrong sin
[35:51] has cut off the love of
[35:53] Christ
[35:54] Hallelujah that's a great sign that's
[35:57] why it's so important to love one
[35:58] another Jesus said that's the whole sign
[36:00] you're a Christian amen by this they'll
[36:03] know that they're my disciples because
[36:04] they have love one for another
[36:07] Hallelujah will you find people they
[36:09] just they might cross their arms at you
[36:11] after service just walk away from you
[36:13] won't look won't even shake your hand
[36:15] won't won't won't hug you or nothing
[36:16] like that what is that that's iniquity
[36:19] cutting off the love of
[36:20] God hallelujah everybody see
[36:24] that it's a it's prophecy it's prophecy
[36:29] oh
[36:30] man Hallelujah God knows what he's doing
[36:33] church God knows what he's
[36:39] doing so we can see iniquity is a hard
[36:43] heart it's a heart that doesn't want to
[36:45] turn to God
[36:50] hallelujah so many verses that teach us
[36:52] about uh
[36:55] iniquity I want to look at another
[36:57] iniquity is uh specifically for our days
[36:59] Revelation three about the lukewarm
[37:01] iniquity how many know that's a real
[37:03] thing
[37:04] today think about that church no other
[37:07] age had that said about them except our
[37:09] age lukewarm which just means not hot
[37:13] not cold and hot remembers boiling so
[37:16] let's look let's look at our uh let's
[37:18] look at our spiritual stove today is it
[37:20] boiling Hallelujah do we got the water
[37:22] boiling on the inside Hallelujah it
[37:25] ought to be Hallelujah and if not let's
[37:26] make sure it's that way before we go
[37:28] Hallelujah that's why you came sometimes
[37:29] to get on the stove Hallelujah have the
[37:32] Lord Jesus uh stir you up by God's grace
[37:34] the Bible say stir up your gifts
[37:36] Hallelujah stir up your
[37:38] faith verse uh Revelation
[37:42] three verse 15 I Know Thy works that
[37:45] thou art neither cold nor hot I would
[37:47] that ye were cold or hot so then because
[37:49] Thou Art lukewarm neither cold nor hot I
[37:51] will spew thee out of my mouth so uh
[37:54] that's rejected from the body of Christ
[37:56] right if you're in if you're in the body
[37:59] of Christ right you're a part of the
[37:59] body of Christ so this would be like
[38:01] Judas workers of iniquity you're no
[38:05] longer in you're no longer apart you're
[38:06] rejected there it is there's a rejection
[38:08] right uh the reprobate mind rejected
[38:11] lukewarm would of course be doing some
[38:14] works of iniquity and some works of
[38:15] righteousness Jesus said that doesn't
[38:17] work in my body Hallelujah that makes me
[38:19] sick
[38:21] Hallelujah then he says I never knew you
[38:23] right regarding those that did that the
[38:26] workers of iniquity Matthew chapter
[38:27] seven now here here here's a good here's
[38:31] a good uh idea of people's words that
[38:33] are workers of iniquity here's what they
[38:35] say because thou sayest I'm rich and I'm
[38:38] creased with Goods I don't need anything
[38:41] I don't need more of God God can't use
[38:44] that type of person God can't use us if
[38:46] we're going to put our spiritual lives
[38:48] on cruise
[38:49] control right well I've got enough I'm
[38:52] doing fine I'm just going to keep doing
[38:53] what I always do and but in reality you
[38:56] don't right or people will stop doing
[38:58] what they used to
[39:00] do you got to always examine your life
[39:02] and make sure I'm I'm I'm sincere I'm
[39:04] doing what I'm supposed to do praise God
[39:06] hallelujah amen I don't want to become
[39:10] lukewarm I want to uh keep my mind
[39:12] boiling I want to keep the thoughts of
[39:14] God right up here and I want to see the
[39:16] right Works come out of my life as well
[39:19] Glory he spews out the lukewarm they're
[39:22] rich and increase with goods and have
[39:25] need of nothing our prayer ought to be
[39:27] tonight Jesus I need
[39:29] you I need you to forgive all my
[39:32] iniquities I need you to heal my body
[39:35] all those uh Psalm 103 verses amen I
[39:39] need all that I need you constantly I
[39:41] need you every day Lord I need you every
[39:44] hour I need you
[39:45] Hallelujah that's
[39:48] right so see this is how you'll know
[39:51] people that are in lukewarm condition
[39:52] that well I don't have time I don't need
[39:54] to go to church I don't need to read my
[39:56] Bible I don't need to go there I don't
[39:58] need to spend more time with God they
[39:59] don't have need of it so they don't they
[40:01] don't do
[40:02] it but we should say I definitely need
[40:05] more of God I'm I'm just aware I'm just
[40:08] daily aware that I need more of Christ
[40:09] in my life
[40:11] Hallelujah that's the lukewarm words I
[40:13] don't need that I don't have to do
[40:16] that I don't need more of the Lord and
[40:18] that's the prosperity trap as we saw in
[40:20] Jeremiah Israel got into that as well
[40:23] and so Jesus says you you you say you
[40:25] don't need anything but you don't even
[40:27] realize you're you're wretched miserable
[40:30] poor blind and
[40:32] naked so these people are in a in a in a
[40:35] deceived condition they don't even
[40:37] realize their spiritual State their
[40:40] iniquity has caused them to re they
[40:42] can't recognize the actual state that
[40:44] they're
[40:45] in they they're blind that Tick Tock
[40:48] makes them uh Fall Away From God they're
[40:49] blind to that they they don't they don't
[40:51] understand that they don't understand
[40:53] that drinking out with the sisters or
[40:54] drinking with the brothers or the boys
[40:56] or the workers and getting drunk they
[40:58] don't understand that these things are
[40:59] making them fall away from
[41:01] God they can't see it they're they're
[41:06] blind miserable wretched Verse 18 but
[41:10] Jesus still gives them counsel Jesus
[41:12] still offers counsel because he's
[41:13] merciful
[41:15] Hallelujah
[41:17] merciful I counsel to to thee of me to
[41:20] buy gold tried in the
[41:22] fire brother ra said that's a a a fir
[41:25] tried character
[41:27] Jesus says you need to purchase this you
[41:29] need to let your faith be tested and
[41:31] trust me through trials then you'll have
[41:32] a gold testimony you have faith like
[41:36] gold that's been tested and tried and
[41:39] all your unbelief and all your struggles
[41:40] are all burned out all your little sins
[41:42] and little uh uh uh what do they call
[41:45] them uh Tendencies and all those sinful
[41:48] Tendencies all your past uh uh you know
[41:50] just just weaknesses they all get burned
[41:52] out and you become a stronger
[41:54] Christian that's right and white rment
[41:57] right reignment is actually the opposite
[41:59] of iniquity white reignment is the
[42:01] righteousness of saints the Saints do
[42:03] what's
[42:04] right and then isav isav of course went
[42:07] on your eyes you can see what is
[42:09] eyesight it's understanding it's
[42:10] spiritual understanding or
[42:12] knowledge so anoint thy eyes with isow
[42:15] that they might might see us your real
[42:17] condition and if you see your real
[42:19] condition you'll be able to accept verse
[42:20] 19 as many as I love I rebuke and
[42:24] chasen if you really got spiritual
[42:26] eyesight you'll be able to recognize oh
[42:28] the Bible says I'm falling short there
[42:30] then Lord forgive me and help me to obey
[42:32] it next
[42:33] time because he loves me right he don't
[42:36] he won't let me stay the same be zealous
[42:39] therefore and quickly in other words be
[42:41] zealous and and repent so quickly repent
[42:44] Hallelujah and what do you get Church oh

[42:55] of your good parts he's going to tell
[42:56] you some of your bad Parts because he's
[42:58] got to rebuke you sometimes

[43:19] greater compliment than that you

[43:28] Hallelujah he that hath an ear let him
[43:30] hear what the spirit says to the church
[43:32] how many's hearing what the spirit says
[43:34] tonight Hallelujah GE if we're real
[43:37] Christians he'll help us depart from
[43:40] iniquity sins that we know are
[43:44] wrong right and in many cases God has us
[43:48] do that if someone sins against us Jesus
[43:51] said we got to go to them and face them
[43:53] one onone let's pull up these verses uh
[43:56] Matthew 185 and we're going to go down
[43:58] to 20 H so sometimes God think about
[44:01] that sometime God will use you to help
[44:03] somebody correct their iniquity and
[44:06] church usually that's the last thing I
[44:07] want to
[44:08] do it's the last thing you want to do I
[44:11] got to go to that person you keep
[44:13] praying oh God help them to get right
[44:14] help them to get right they don't get
[44:16] right well whose turn is it to go
[44:17] correct them you the Holy Ghost says I
[44:19] want to use you to correct them you're
[44:22] like oh God why I got to do
[44:24] that okay Lord
[44:27] if you say so if you lead me if you
[44:30] guide me moreover If thy brother shall
[44:33] trespass against thee that's another
[44:34] word that's another word for iniquity
[44:35] remember trespass is another word for
[44:39] iniquity go and tell him his fault
[44:41] between thee and him alone if he shall
[44:43] hear thee thou shal thou Hast gained thy
[44:45] brother next verse verse 16 but if he
[44:49] will not hear thee then take with thee
[44:50] two one or two more oh one or two you
[44:53] could take okay you can take two praise
[44:54] God you don't have to just go with two
[44:55] you can do two you can do three
[44:57] that in the mouth of two or three
[44:58] Witnesses every word may be
[45:01] established verse
[45:03] 17 and if he now I'm sorry if he shall
[45:06] neglect to hear them tell it to the
[45:10] church but if he neglect to hear the
[45:12] church let him be unto thee as a heathen
[45:14] man and a Publican and then you're going
[45:16] to see it you're going to see it later
[45:18] Paul says just ignore them that they'll
[45:21] be ashamed of themselves is that right
[45:24] okay now go to verse uh go to uh Romans
[45:27] 1617 here's another
[45:28] one now remember Paul would not teach
[45:31] anything different from Jesus so have to
[45:33] see how these tie together I beseech
[45:35] your brethren mark them that cause
[45:36] division so Point them out to the
[45:38] church and offenses contrary to the
[45:41] doctrine or the instruction or the Bible
[45:43] that word means commands too which you
[45:45] have learned and avoid them so there's
[45:47] that they're like a heathen Publican
[45:49] just avoid them don't spend any time
[45:50] with
[45:51] them if someone will trespass against
[45:54] you a child of God part of the body of
[45:56] Christ and won't repent of it God says
[45:58] avoid them don't talk to
[46:01] them oh no what about all that love
[46:03] stuff we're talking about what happened
[46:04] all the 1 Corinthians 13 Love This is
[46:08] Love because that man ought that man or
[46:10] woman ought to be ashamed of themselves
[46:13] for sinning against a Christian another
[46:15] brother and sister and failing to repent
[46:17] of
[46:19] it and and Jesus says I'm going to
[46:22] rebuke you as many as I love if I love
[46:25] you I will rebuke you
[46:28] and what what are you supposed to do uh
[46:30] kind of repent or zealously repent
[46:33] zealously don't hold anything back say
[46:36] oh oh forgive me yes you're right God
[46:37] forgive me I had an evil spirit on me
[46:39] that day or whatever you should be so
[46:41] zealous to repent Jesus said if they
[46:43] don't avoid them that's
[46:46] love because if they really have the
[46:48] Holy Ghost they'll know they've grieved
[46:50] the Holy Ghost they'll be ashamed of
[46:51] themselves and they'll want the Holy
[46:52] Ghost back in their lives if they really
[46:54] got it
[46:58] 1 Thessalonians uh
[47:03] 5:14 now we exhort you Brethren warn
[47:06] them that are unruly see you give them
[47:07] that warning go oneon-one then you take
[47:09] one or two with
[47:10] you warn that are unruly that means
[47:13] insubordinate which means you won't
[47:15] submit to the authority of the
[47:18] church or even the uh your brother or
[47:21] sister anyone that would go against uh
[47:24] the word of God insubordinate won't
[47:26] submit
[47:28] uh the Bible says warn them give them
[47:30] warnings give them one give them two
[47:32] then you tell to the whole church then
[47:33] the whole church is supposed to reach
[47:34] out to them
[47:37] right for what for iniquities they know
[47:40] better someone tells them they don't
[47:42] repent two three people tell them that
[47:44] that's just again more witnesses you're
[47:46] not making it right you need to make it
[47:48] right
[47:50] Hallelujah we always say we want to be
[47:52] the Church of the Living God the book of
[47:53] Acts Church here's the book of Acts
[47:55] church right here Hallelujah remember
[47:58] God even killed Anan and Fus because
[47:59] they lied to the Holy Ghost they lied to
[48:01] Peter that was the book of Acts Church
[48:05] Hallelujah yes now uh 2 Thessalonians
[48:09] 3:6 here's where we see uh more of this
[48:11] idea of there are Heathen and a Publican
[48:14] unto you now we command you brethren in
[48:16] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[48:17] withdraw yourselves from every
[48:21] brother or sister that walketh
[48:25] disorderly and not after the tradition
[48:28] which you received of us hallelujah go
[48:31] to verse 14 will you go down to verse 14
[48:33] says note that I'm sorry yes and if any
[48:36] man obey not our word by this epistle
[48:39] note him see Mark him let everybody know
[48:41] tell it to the
[48:42] church right because iniquity is in the
[48:45] in the
[48:45] camp note that man and have no company
[48:49] with him that he may be ashamed not go
[48:52] to hell but be ashamed and repent it's a
[48:55] brother it's a sister
[48:58] Hallelujah so we see this all through
[49:00] the Bible this is how God teaches the
[49:02] church to do loving correction we don't
[49:06] like to do it sometimes but who else is
[49:08] going to do it Church Jesus tells us
[49:10] it's love that causes you to go to a
[49:12] brother or sister to try to correct them
[49:15] that's
[49:16] love have you ever been uh uh face to
[49:19] face with somebody accusing you have
[49:21] sinned against them how about a group of
[49:23] two or three how about a whole church
[49:27] I've never had a whole church I've only
[49:29] had one just one person coming at a time
[49:33] or maybe I guess I've had two I've I've
[49:34] had to I'd say that yes by God's grace
[49:37] but this is how uh this is what happens
[49:41] and see Church iniquity works on people
[49:43] as we said earlier the love that they
[49:45] had for the individual or individuals is
[49:47] gone look at I found this yesterday
[49:50] morning I'm like oh my goodness
[49:51] Lamentations
[49:54] 2:10 now these are Lamentations these
[49:56] are complaints of of Israel because of
[49:58] their iniquity and look at the body
[50:00] language here the Elders of the daughter
[50:03] of Zion sit upon the ground and keep
[50:05] silence so they're they're
[50:06] quiet they have cast up dust upon their
[50:09] heads they have girded themselves with
[50:11] sackcloth the Verdin of Jerusalem hang
[50:13] down their heads to the ground so look
[50:16] look at their they're quiet their heads
[50:18] are down remember we talked about
[50:19] self-pity remember we talked about
[50:20] self-pity feeling sorry for yourself
[50:22] what do you it's just like pouting like
[50:23] a
[50:25] baby see this is is what iniquity does
[50:28] this is supposed to be the people of
[50:30] God but the the the sin of iniquity took
[50:33] all their worship out it took all their
[50:36] love out for God and for God's
[50:39] people
[50:41] hallelujah look at Ezra
[50:44] 9:6 and I said oh my God I'm ashamed and
[50:47] blush to lift up my face to thee my God
[50:50] for our iniquities are increased now
[50:53] Ezra is interceding not for not not
[50:56] maybe for for all his iniquities but for
[50:57] the the iniquities of all the people and
[50:59] his iniquities have made him so ashamed
[51:01] he keeps his head down and he can't even
[51:04] look up to
[51:05] heaven now church when I was a sinner
[51:08] I've told you this before I would sit in
[51:09] the somebody's of God church and I would
[51:11] just sit there with my head down like
[51:12] this when is this going to be over and
[51:15] you better believe I was silent I wasn't
[51:17] singing no worship or anything like
[51:18] can't wait to get out watch the football
[51:19] watch the basketball like
[51:23] this and the Bible said that's a sign of
[51:25] iniquity
[51:27] they hang down their heads
[51:32] silent what what does that iniquity
[51:35] makes you ashamed in the presence of God
[51:37] so you don't worship God you don't love
[51:38] God's
[51:39] people is that
[51:42] right now look look what happened when
[51:44] the people though got on fire in uh
[51:47] Nehemiah
[51:49] 8:6 now verse 10 is a very familiar
[51:51] scripture the joy of the Lord is your
[51:53] strength how many know
[51:54] that that's what we need tonight we need
[51:56] some enjy in our hearts Hallelujah
[51:58] that'll make us strong but but notice
[52:00] when they're having their Revival after
[52:01] the Captivity after their return from
[52:03] captivity through
[52:04] zerubabel here now Ezra Nehemiah and
[52:06] Ezra blessed the Lord the great God and
[52:08] all the people answered what they answer
[52:11] amen amen with lifting up of hands so
[52:16] this is Revival mode before their heads
[52:18] are down their hands are down they're
[52:20] silent but when God starts doing
[52:22] something they lift up their heads they
[52:23] shout amen amen and they praise God God
[52:26] because they're in Revival their
[52:28] iniquities are forgiven
[52:31] Hallelujah same city same people
[52:33] hallelujah Jews God's
[52:37] people
[52:41] hallelujah see what iniquity does cuts
[52:43] off all your praise cuts off all your
[52:49] love look at Psalm
[52:51] 63:3 because thy loving kindness is is
[52:54] better than life my lips shall praise
[52:56] thee so when they come to church they
[52:57] actually praise God and worship God
[52:59] remember before they're silent their
[53:01] iniquities made them silent with heads
[53:03] down won't worship God verse four thus
[53:06] will I bless thee while I live I'll lift
[53:09] up my hands in thy name it's such a
[53:11] victory if you honestly you lift your
[53:13] hands and say God I Surrender I want
[53:15] more of you I'm praising you if you
[53:17] really with a sincere heart you actually
[53:18] say Amen with a sincere heart that's a
[53:21] sign of Revival Hallelujah it is I just
[53:25] showed you how those in iniquity don't
[53:27] have those signs in their lives we all
[53:29] know if you're honest with yourself you
[53:31] ought to say Amen already
[53:35] Hallelujah Psalm 134 verse one a song of
[53:40] degrees behold bless ye the Lord all ye
[53:43] Servants of the Lord which by night
[53:45] stand in the house of the Lord lift up
[53:47] your hands in the sanctuary and bless
[53:49] the
[53:50] Lord not hang your head down as
[53:53] lamentation said and keep your hands
[53:55] down but actually look up to heaven Lift
[53:57] Your Hands Say Amen worship God praise
[54:00] God why because you're
[54:02] forgiven because you know God's loving
[54:04] kindness has forgiven you and you're not
[54:06] walking in iniquity you're walking in
[54:08] the Purity the Integrity the
[54:10] righteousness of Jesus
[54:13] Christ Hallelujah I'm almost done it's
[54:15] already 8
[54:18] o' it go so
[54:20] fast hallelujah how many enjoying the
[54:23] word tonight amen hallelujah it's a
[54:25] blessing it's a blessing to know that we
[54:27] always depart from iniquity once God
[54:29] shows us it might take every time it's a
[54:30] little different you know but as as soon
[54:33] as possible we should depart from
[54:34] iniquity say God don't let me go back
[54:37] there again don't let me walk down that
[54:38] road of iniquity again let me go in the
[54:41] way of everlasting Hallelujah let me
[54:43] stay on the narrow road Hallelujah I
[54:46] don't want to go back there don't God
[54:47] don't let me go back there but see
[54:49] workers iniquity they just right go
[54:51] right on that path they just keep you
[54:53] you you try to you know one at a time
[54:54] you try to talk them out of it they just
[54:55] keep on going then you take two or three
[54:57] hey please turn around they just keep on
[54:59] going just right walking right into
[55:03] it and then while they're walking they
[55:05] don't love
[55:06] nobody right nobody that they ought to
[55:09] love right right right here in the
[55:12] scripture the love of Jesus Christ will
[55:15] make you try to correct somebody if you
[55:17] really love them Hallelujah that's what
[55:21] God's love
[55:23] does
[55:25] glory I'm saving it for my punchline
[55:27] here we ready for the ending here by
[55:29] God's grace I've been building up all
[55:31] this Doom and Gloom to try to bring it
[55:33] down here by God's
[55:39] grace so the question comes to the end
[55:42] how do we overcome iniquity Psalm
[55:45] 11957 Thou Art my portion oh Lord I have
[55:47] said that I would keep thy words verse
[55:50] 58 I intreated thy favor with my whole
[55:52] heart see you got to put your whole
[55:53] heart into it God let your blessing be
[55:55] on me let your Spirit be on me with
[55:57] everything I got be merciful unto me
[56:00] according to Thy
[56:01] word here it is verse 59 brother
[56:04] preaches numerous times from from that
[56:05] time on I thought on my ways and turned
[56:08] my feet unto thy
[56:11] testimonies how do we overcome iniquity
[56:14] we we recognize the path we're going the
[56:17] path of Disobedience we recognize we're
[56:19] on the wrong path and we think about
[56:21] God's word and we turn our direction we
[56:23] repent and go the other way and walk in
[56:26] the the path of obedience look at verse
[56:29] 60 he didn't wait a whole week he didn't
[56:31] wait a month to get right he said I made
[56:33] haste and delayed not to keep that
[56:35] Commandments Amen in other words as soon
[56:37] as I got out of church I made it
[56:41] right how much more if one if a brother
[56:43] comes you and a sister comes you and
[56:45] says you sin against them how how much
[56:46] more should you quickly make it right as
[56:48] soon as
[56:49] possible but some
[56:51] people they'll be rebuked I say no no I
[56:53] didn't do that keep going and they keep
[56:55] going headl WR that
[56:58] way that's not the spirit of Christ the
[57:00] spirit of Christ is I'm going to quickly
[57:02] make this right I'm going to quickly
[57:03] make sure my brother or sister knows
[57:05] that I love
[57:06] them
[57:10] hallelujah hallelujah that's
[57:12] right Ezekiel 18:30 therefore will I
[57:16] judge you oh House of Israel everyone
[57:18] according to his ways sayith the Lord
[57:21] I'm sorry Lord God repent and turn
[57:23] yourselves from all your transgressions
[57:25] so iniquity shall not be your ruin see
[57:27] what iniquity does it makes somebody
[57:29] ruin their whole life like I said with
[57:31] some of my family members I've seen them
[57:33] ruin Decades of their lives but some
[57:35] people ruin lives for a week or a month
[57:37] or or six months or a year or two years
[57:39] or three they ruin entire lives but God
[57:42] is able to rescue them if they're able
[57:44] to turn back to the righteous path
[57:46] Hallelujah so we're singing about the
[57:48] Lord is my shepherd see what iniquity
[57:50] does it ruins a life it ruins a
[57:54] testimony but we will not be the workers
[57:56] of
[57:57] iniquity verse 31 Cast Away all your
[58:00] transgressions just throw your bad
[58:02] habits and your your desires and your
[58:03] sins and your your pride or or or or
[58:06] lust or bitterness or whatever may be uh
[58:09] Throw It cast it away from you don't
[58:10] don't hang on to it cast it away from
[58:13] you whereby ye have transgressed and
[58:16] make you a new heart does that sound
[58:18] familiar a new heart and a new spirit
[58:21] Hallelujah you make it you see but you
[58:23] can't get a new heart and spirit until
[58:25] you cast away the old the old sin the
[58:29] iniquity God's not going to give you a
[58:30] new heart or new spirit while people
[58:33] hold on to sin and
[58:36] iniquities for why will you die oh House
[58:39] of Israel for I have no pleasure in the
[58:41] death of him that dieth sayith the Lord
[58:43] God wherefore turn yourselves and
[58:46] live turn from the the path of iniquity
[58:50] and walk in the narrow road of
[58:52] obedience Glory
[58:57] so
[58:58] true but church we realize the power of
[59:01] Jesus Christ is present in our lives and
[59:05] it's hard to calculate how much this
[59:07] means to us but acts 3:26 gives us a
[59:10] good Insight in here unto you first God
[59:13] having raised up his son Jesus Christ
[59:16] sent him to bless you how did how did
[59:18] how did Jesus bless you in turning away
[59:21] every one of you from his iniquities
[59:24] look at this great blessing Jes Jesus
[59:26] Christ came he died he rose he sent his
[59:28] Spirit and the blessing is that God
[59:31] takes you off of your path of
[59:33] self-destruction and puts you on the
[59:35] path of Eternal Redemption hallelujah
[59:38] amen what a blessing Hallelujah that was
[59:41] the blessing the blessing was to turn
[59:43] you from your self-destructive path of
[59:45] hating self hating God to turn you to
[59:48] love God love God's people love the way
[59:50] of life and receive eternal life
[59:53] Hallelujah this is the blessing of Jesus
[59:55] Christ
[59:56] this is why if you have the spirit of
[59:57] Christ you won't be in iniquity too long
[1:00:00] till the Lord Jesus Christ corrects
[1:00:03] you I just want to share this testimony
[1:00:05] this kind of came to my mind here U
[1:00:08] there's a brother that was emailing me
[1:00:09] this week he's way older than me I think
[1:00:10] he's I shouldn't say way older he's in
[1:00:12] his 60s I'm almost 50 by God's
[1:00:17] grace but he
[1:00:20] said when he got married he didn't know
[1:00:22] the message and I just want to I want
[1:00:24] you look at the patience and look at the
[1:00:25] respect for the word of God this man
[1:00:26] could have easily went in iniquity he
[1:00:28] said from a right after he got saved he
[1:00:29] you know he married a unbeliever they're
[1:00:31] both unbelievers he got saved received
[1:00:33] the message got the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:34] Ghost and then he says I know I'm called
[1:00:37] to preach now think about this he's 20
[1:00:38] he's know he's called to preach but he's
[1:00:41] got an unbelieving spouse he could have
[1:00:43] said I don't care what they what those
[1:00:45] churches say I'm going to go to church
[1:00:46] where I can preach because I know I'm
[1:00:47] called to preach you know what he did he
[1:00:49] waited on
[1:00:51] God waited on God and he let he just
[1:00:54] waited on God for decades
[1:00:57] and there was something else that
[1:00:58] happened in there I'm not sure exactly
[1:00:59] what happened but he waited until uh uh
[1:01:03] you know and then oh yeah then his wife
[1:01:04] never turned to Christ so all these
[1:01:06] decades he was dealing with his wife
[1:01:07] wouldn't accept the message wouldn't
[1:01:08] accept Christ I know I'm called to
[1:01:10] preach I know I'm called to preach and
[1:01:12] all these Temptations and he knew like
[1:01:13] and even his Pastor died and and he knew
[1:01:16] his Pastor would have let him take over
[1:01:18] even in that marriage situation another
[1:01:22] temptation to try to just do iniquity
[1:01:24] just do whatever you want to do and
[1:01:25] don't care about the word of God he said
[1:01:28] but then God moved him to different
[1:01:29] places and then finally he said and this
[1:01:31] he wasn't praying for his wife to pass
[1:01:32] away but his wife eventually passed away
[1:01:34] and he's in his 60s and now finally he
[1:01:37] can start preaching and he's traveling
[1:01:38] overseas seeing missionary work people
[1:01:40] saved heal healed filled with the Holy
[1:01:43] Ghost but God was testing him not for
[1:01:46] one year not for two years but for
[1:01:50] decades 40
[1:01:52] years God was testing him saying are you
[1:01:54] going to stay in the truth or you're
[1:01:55] going to walk in the path here here's
[1:01:57] the path if you want to go which way you
[1:01:58] going to
[1:02:00] choose and he said now God give him a
[1:02:03] wonderful wife a believing wife now but
[1:02:06] he had to wait 40 years are we willing
[1:02:08] to wait 40 years on
[1:02:11] God see Satan makes the path of iniquity
[1:02:14] look so much better oh well I know I I
[1:02:16] know this and I know that I would do
[1:02:18] that I would do that but God wants your
[1:02:21] obedience God wants your your
[1:02:23] righteousness and not your
[1:02:25] unrighteousness
[1:02:28] I thought that was a beautiful testimony
[1:02:30] 40 years and now he's finally in the 60s
[1:02:32] now he's finally traveling overseas with
[1:02:33] these brothers taking the message books
[1:02:35] to Nations that don't have it I mean
[1:02:36] it's just a beautiful me beautiful
[1:02:40] testimony able to wait on God Lord I
[1:02:42] love you I and and then he he emails me
[1:02:44] about all these different doctrines that
[1:02:46] we see eye to eye on it and all these
[1:02:47] years he's had the Holy Ghost since he
[1:02:48] was 20 and waiting 40 years the Bible
[1:02:51] said wait upon your ministering amen
[1:02:54] hallelujah he'd rather wait wait and
[1:02:56] suffer and suffer in a very hard
[1:02:58] relationship he'd rather wait on that
[1:03:01] and trust God Hallelujah for God's
[1:03:04] timing rather than trust in feelings and
[1:03:06] run after this and opportunities and
[1:03:08] opportunities right it's test is what
[1:03:11] they're called they're called
[1:03:15] tests Sor I'd share that it was a great
[1:03:18] testimony to me this week I'm like oh my
[1:03:19] goodness waiting 40
[1:03:21] years before God waiting 40 years so God
[1:03:24] can you can finally feel like God's
[1:03:26] really using me let's wait on the Lord
[1:03:29] the Bible said if you wait you'll renew
[1:03:31] your
[1:03:32] strength you renew your strength when
[1:03:34] you wait on God like I told that I told
[1:03:36] another brother I said never push your
[1:03:38] way yeah I told a man on the email he
[1:03:40] feels led to preach I said you'll never
[1:03:43] have to push your way into anything if
[1:03:45] if it's God's will I never had to push
[1:03:48] anybody to be Pastor I never I've never
[1:03:51] asked to preach anywhere I've never had
[1:03:52] to do anything God if God's in it God
[1:03:55] will open the door at the right
[1:03:57] time won't have to divide a church or
[1:03:59] steal ties or you know like people do
[1:04:01] with churches starting churches and all
[1:04:02] this nonsense he won't do any of that if
[1:04:04] God's really called you you'll be able
[1:04:06] to keep the word and then God will
[1:04:08] provide for you Hallelujah if he's
[1:04:10] called you to do something he'll make a
[1:04:11] way for you to do it praise God God
[1:04:13] won't lead you into iniquity
[1:04:20] Hallelujah I'm closing with these last
[1:04:22] few things here I got a couple more
[1:04:23] things here thatat your perfect man
[1:04:27] brother Ram says we have to die to
[1:04:29] ourselves he said in order uh to have
[1:04:32] the Life of Christ and he Compares it to
[1:04:34] embalming how many you been to a funeral
[1:04:35] lately what's inside that body embalming
[1:04:38] fluid brother says the trouble is he and
[1:04:41] he Compares that to you and I think
[1:04:42] about that he Compares us to being dead
[1:04:44] bodies and we got to be filled with
[1:04:46] God's spirit but brother says but the
[1:04:49] thing of it is we don't get the
[1:04:50] embalming
[1:04:51] fluid so the people rot away just just a
[1:04:55] one type
[1:04:56] and brother's comparing that to the Holy
[1:04:58] Ghost we've got to die out to ourselves
[1:05:00] and we got to let God fill us he says
[1:05:02] with those attributes right there did
[1:05:04] anybody notice this as as I left Su I'm
[1:05:06] like that's right brother R said and I
[1:05:09] had Wendy put these on here these little
[1:05:10] everybody see this little word Eden you
[1:05:12] see that little word what's h s spell
[1:05:14] his let's give her two class got ready
[1:05:16] for some more Bible studies here it's
[1:05:19] his faith it's his virtue vir it's his
[1:05:25] know kind of was refreshing me like
[1:05:27] that's right when you get God's spirit
[1:05:29] it's no it's not even your ability it's
[1:05:31] all his ability when I got faith to
[1:05:34] believe brother Chris and and finally
[1:05:36] become a Christian it wasn't hard to go
[1:05:38] be baptized because I had his faith
[1:05:40] Hallelujah I had the faith of Jesus
[1:05:42] Christ I could go be
[1:05:44] baptized that's why I told my older
[1:05:46] children I said if you ever feel led to
[1:05:47] be re-baptized again I said you'll
[1:05:49] you'll know when it's because you'll
[1:05:51] know because go it'll be God in you
[1:05:53] it'll be Christ faith in you Hallelujah
[1:05:55] and nobody can keep you from those
[1:05:57] Waters
[1:05:59] Hallelujah and I I admire our children
[1:06:01] uh being baptized at such young ages but
[1:06:04] then as they get older they go through
[1:06:05] trials that they never went through
[1:06:07] before but see I went through all those
[1:06:08] trials before I was a real believer and
[1:06:11] they've got to go through them and they
[1:06:12] want to make sure their testimonies are
[1:06:13] sincere that's that's that's wonderful
[1:06:16] that that's
[1:06:17] lovely uh that's
[1:06:19] admirable and you want to know and how
[1:06:21] do you know because you know something
[1:06:23] is filled me amen hallelujah something
[1:06:25] something has anointed me something has
[1:06:27] empowered me it's not my faith it's not
[1:06:29] my virtue it's not my knowledge it's
[1:06:31] Christ's Faith Christ virtue Christ
[1:06:34] knowledge Christ has given me Temperance
[1:06:36] I didn't have his self-control but now I
[1:06:38] got it but it's not mine it's all
[1:06:40] Jesus's Hallelujah that's the blessing
[1:06:42] of God he gives me his anointing to keep
[1:06:46] the word of
[1:06:49] God brother bam
[1:06:53] says he says if you die take the blood
[1:06:56] out of a man you embalm him the troubled
[1:06:57] is a lot of them never got embalmed he's
[1:07:00] talking about the spirit of God filling
[1:07:01] a man you take the blood out of a man
[1:07:03] he's gone then the only thing you you do
[1:07:05] is put another uh blood back in him he's
[1:07:07] going to live again you took his blood
[1:07:08] out blood
[1:07:09] transfusion and now we put the blood of
[1:07:12] Jesus Christ in and it brings the faith
[1:07:15] of Jesus Christ it brings the virtue of
[1:07:18] Jesus Christ did you know that when
[1:07:19] you're a Christian you don't have your
[1:07:21] faith you have the faith of Jesus Christ
[1:07:24] Hallelujah if you're you're really
[1:07:25] serving God you have real Faith because
[1:07:28] it's not your faith it's the faith of
[1:07:30] the Son of God Paul says in
[1:07:32] Galatians you get the knowledge of Jesus
[1:07:34] Christ you get the temperance of Jesus
[1:07:36] Christ you get the patience of Jesus
[1:07:38] Christ the godliness of Jesus Christ the
[1:07:40] brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ see
[1:07:42] that's why you can treat your brother
[1:07:43] and sister in the right way because you
[1:07:44] have Christ
[1:07:47] kindness glory and the love of God he
[1:07:50] says which is Jesus Christ my goodness
[1:07:54] Hallelujah so you get all these
[1:07:55] attributes of Christ and then you get
[1:07:57] Jesus Christ Hallelujah the
[1:08:01] Capstone he's the head and controls you
[1:08:04] and your feet is the foundation Faith he
[1:08:06] says amen controlled by the head there
[1:08:08] you are there's the perfect Mana of God
[1:08:12] when he possesses these virtues or these
[1:08:16] attributes
[1:08:19] Hallelujah so that's what we want church
[1:08:21] we want the Faith of Christ The Virtue
[1:08:24] and as I said on on on Sunday if you're
[1:08:26] struggling with patience say just just
[1:08:28] talk to God and say God I don't have the
[1:08:29] patience I need your
[1:08:31] patience recognize the difference my
[1:08:33] patience won't be enough to get through
[1:08:35] this like that brother a human patience

[1:08:40] years that's why he need the patience of
[1:08:42] Jesus Christ amen and he got it and now
[1:08:45] he's obeying the word and God's blessing
[1:08:47] his life as a beautiful testimony of the
[1:08:50] patience of Jesus Christ

[1:08:58] Bible says we have treasure in Earth and
[1:08:59] vessels in 2 Corinthians I believe it's
[1:09:01] chapter 3 each one of these is a
[1:09:03] treasure when you have the Faith of
[1:09:04] Christ that's a treasure and see you
[1:09:06] just get more treasure more anointing

[1:12:25] then then Jesus will say I know you see
[1:12:27] the workers of iniquity they never let
[1:12:29] Jesus do that so Jesus said I never knew
[1:12:31] you you never let me come in and take
[1:12:35] some time and and just write all my word
[1:12:37] upon the fleshly tables they never open
[1:12:39] themselves up they would just try to do
[1:12:41] some Miracles right they would actually
[1:12:42] get in the the spirit but then they run
[1:12:44] off in in on their path of
[1:12:48] iniquity but Jesus said I never knew you
[1:12:50] but he's supposed to know us because he
[1:12:52] writes his word on the fleshly tables of
[1:12:54] our
[1:12:56] heart and if he writes his word on our
[1:12:59] heart then the Bible says uh Thy word
[1:13:01] have i hidden in my heart that I might
[1:13:02] not sin against God I might not walk in
[1:13:06] the path of iniquity I think it's Psalm
[1:13:08] 11911 if I'm not mistaken
[1:13:12] Hallelujah write it on my heart so I
[1:13:14] don't sin I don't go in iniquity against
[1:13:17] you and whatever attribute whatever
[1:13:19] strength you need whatever power you
[1:13:20] need pray until you feel it Hallelujah
[1:13:25] that's why I told you when I go in the
[1:13:26] barber I know there I just put my hand
[1:13:28] out I just start praying I pray until I
[1:13:29] I'm ready to go in there by God's grace
[1:13:33] last verse Galatians 49 I'm going way
[1:13:34] longer than I thought Galatians 4:9
[1:13:36] that's how it always
[1:13:37] is Galatians
[1:13:42] 4:9 but now after that ye have known God
[1:13:45] or rather are known of God see Church in
[1:13:49] in the in the final say of this in all
[1:13:51] reality who knows which one better do we
[1:13:54] know God better or does God know us
[1:13:56] better Paul says in the final reality of
[1:13:58] all this we know God but rather God
[1:14:01] knows all of us how does God know you he
[1:14:04] predestinated you he chose you but also
[1:14:06] you let him in and he had s with you you
[1:14:09] had fellowship with God and you talked
[1:14:11] with the him with the word and you let
[1:14:13] him write the word of God on the fleshly
[1:14:15] tables of your heart God knows me church

[1:14:45] known
[1:14:48] me he predestinated me he left the 99 to
[1:14:51] go get the one think about that Jesus
[1:14:54] didn't leave me out in the world Jesus
