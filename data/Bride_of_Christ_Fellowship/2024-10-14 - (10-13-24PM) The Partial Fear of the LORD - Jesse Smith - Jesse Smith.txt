========================================

2 Kings 17 I was kind of saving this I thought I'd do a a little kids Bible study on it but I thought I'd just preach it uh by God's grace I want to look at the partial fear of the Lord so I want to look at the partial fear of the Lord I've been teaching on the fear of the Lord but I like to look at uh the partial fear of the Lord it's a great thought I felt like it was a great thought the lord gave me years ago so I haven't preached it for quite a while and then I heard A good sermon from Charles Spurgeon on it he's called The Prince of preachers Hallelujah now I just said there's no preachers but Jesus right but that's what people called him of course he was in the man age brother Ram said they there was no greater sermons than in the Philadelphian Church age brother Braham said that that's what he felt because it was the age of the man anointing so uh what we recognize is that God is uh God was using those brothers so I listened to uh his message and just a tremendous message 2 Kings 17 Hallelujah we'll just read one verse because I want to preserve the time verse 33 2 Kings 17:33 while you're turning there I did want to say this too does anybody have a cough I heard some coughing this morning anybody have a cough uh because if they're taking communion let's have the coffers go last do anybody have have a cough anybody have a cough I don't I have not coughed I've been good anybody have a cough all right remember I told you that a couple times ago I said if there's ever sickness in the church let me know we'll just do the little cups we got lots of little cups out there and we can uh just want to keep everybody as healthy as possible by God's grace okay so nobody's got to cough okay so all right Hallelujah 2 Kings 17:33 for there say amen amen looking at the partial fear of the Lord here tonight let's read just verse 33 let's hear your voices on three one 2 three they fear the lord and serve their own Gods after the manner of the Nations whom They Carried Away from then may God add his Blessing to ring of his word you can be seated you over the years I've I've kind of come back to this thought over and over again and then when I heard brother Spurgeon preach on like oh man now I really got to preach this here so I hope it's a help to somebody I hope somebody enjoyed the message this morning by God's grace about being a hero I may preach a couple of sermons on that because brother Ram has like I said 20 quotes on it and he goes at it from and every angle you know to win souls or uh you know for your family he takes it from so many different angles be a hero uh find a find a position find your gifts you know he just takes it from all these different angles be a hero in life Hallelujah so I know like I said I know brother Mercy's being a hero bringing his his brothers and sisters to church you keep it up brother that's heroism to me in the modern day so God bless you verse uh now we want to start at verse 24 I'll try to give a background here and uh I'm just going to preach the rest of this chapter so it's the second part of the chapter from 24 um down to 41 if I'm not mistaken I thought this would be a good uh communion message here uh because we don't want a partial fear of the Lord we want a full fear of the Lord hallelujah and so we want to look at this if haven't looked at it for a while uh it was kind of made fresh to me so uh actually before we read 24 I just want to again share remember we defined the fear of the Lord a few weeks ago uh the Old Testament definition it's right Behavior but it's inspired by profound honor so it all starts with that honor when someone has adoration or profound adoration for the Lord that adoration or love for God will move you into the right Behavior so in other words obedience and and that's the Old Testament definition if we looked at the fear of the Lord morally reverence right that's the that's the actual Hebrew definition but if you break it down it means the right Behavior done with the profound honor for God hallelujah and then uh you know the New Testament Jesus summed it up by uh you know the greatest commandment love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and strength and then he said if you love me keep my commands so we found that the fear of the Lord is love loving obedience I love to obey God's word I love to please my heavenly father so that's what we want to uh experience here you know in our lives by God's grace we want the true fear of the Lord now there are as we as we're going to see here tonight there's two kinds of fear of the Lord there's this Godly fear of the Lord that we're talking about but there's also what what's we'd say a sinful fear it's the terror of the Lord that's what we're going to see in this chapter so there's two kinds of fears you know we've always said that God do not give us the spirit of fear but yet we're to fear the lord right so God does not give us that Terror right of the Lord in I'm talking about in the in the worldly sense right we'll see it here tonight they only acknowledge God to be kept from being killed so for us it would translate into something I only do religious acts so I don't go to hell that's what the the the other fear of the Lord is and that's a sinful fear okay but the real fear the lord is this loving obedience I Adore You Lord I honor you and I want to behave the right way praise God I want to obey the word of God because remember God does not give the spirit of fear this worldly sinful torment okay so I just want to lay that out again uh as a refreshment to you uh by God's grace you know uh and this this ties in with second Corinthians I don't have the actual verse in front of me but remember the Bible talks about Godly sorrow and worldly sorrow so worldly sorrow would be this sorrow it's sad you got caught right that's worldly sorrow Oh I got caught I you know I was sinning and I didn't mean to get caught but I'm sorry because I got caught it's not like Lord I'm so sorry I didn't want to do this but worldly star was like I wanted to do it I'm just sorry I got caught right that's the only reason people are sad like you know I've been sharing you know different ministers boy 2024 has been a rough year on uh ministers as far as that are not true to God they' fallen in so many things and uh very few of them will actually come out and say they're sorry for what they did they'll just kind of fade off into the Shadows that's worldly sorrow they got caught right in fact the most recent one he was a 73 year old man uh he was having an affair with a 29y old woman he's 73 and it was the parents of the 29y old woman that came to the church and brought the issue and so see it was wasn't the it wasn't the preacher saying I'm so sorry God I'm bringing this it's it's uh it's the parents of this girl bringing it to them and he got caught I'm sorry I got caught but see a real child of God wants a pure heart praise God they want they know God's watching them Hallelujah God sees all things Hallelujah God's eyes run to and fro around the earth uh trying to find someone he can show himself strong in praise God so we know there's a great difference there between you know Godly sorrow is like Peter Lord I'm sorry forgive me you know I love you he said feed my sheep Peter Hallelujah you know I love you but see worldly sorrowful people they get caught they're sorry they're sad about it and uh they they never seem to really get the victory it's not a real true repentance praise God church that's what the theme of this is we have to make sure we get a real repentance we we truly uh take the attitude where we learn to hate our sin and we'll do anything to keep from going going back to that sin all right so I know this is really down to the heart of things it's not really a shouting message uh but it's an important message praise God because it's your soul your soul should not want to uh go back to sin that it's already struggled with right or already been uh uh been guilty of Godly sorrow would make one want to avoid that sin hate that sin hallelujah amen and so that's what we're looking at here tonight by God's grace there's two kinds of fear of the Lord and we want the right kind of fear of the Lord hallelujah remember the Bible said you know I've told people this over the years you know online and here as well you know people say well how can I overcome well I've said just repent and then just get in God's presence because in his presence is fullness of joy amen like it's either true or it's not that's psalm 16 so if you want to if you want to just get away from sin Get In God's Presence you'll never feel a joy like that Hallelujah then when you experience that Joy the cares of the world or the The Temptations of the world their powers were weaken over you because you've got the joy of the Lord and the joy of the Lord is your strength hallelujah it's a blessing Hallelujah to know the Lord hallelujah God is so good to us glory to God now in our text here we we're looking at uh 2 Kings 17:24 and the men I'm sorry and the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon and from Kuan or cut High and from Ava and from HTH and from seph vame and plac them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel and they possess Samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof now remember this is right about the time of Hezekiah so King Hezekiah because if you actually just turn look at the next chapter it's Hezekiah and he has a Revival this is right about the time they're ready for Revival Glory and a lot of the northern tribes have been carried away right Northern Israel had been carried away because of their sins and so uh the king of Assyria says I need to fill in all those parts someone's got to take care of the land right someone's got to live in the houses we don't want this to All Fall Apart it's our land now we conquered them so they brought in all these people to live in Samaria verse 25 and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there that they feared not the Lord therefore the Lord sent Lions among them which slew some of them so this is quite a story you know uh this is God's land remember the Bible said the Zeal of the Lord will put Jesus on Mount Zion God loves this land God's fighting for this land this is his provided place of worship and so when God's people as disobedient as they were as God's people are carried out God still considers this this is still my land and when these heathens come in they don't fear the lord right they don't even acknowledge Him so what does God do he sends in Lions to slay some of them how many believe that would bring the fear of the Lord on you but we're going to find out it wasn't the real fear of the Lord it was the terror of the Lord right and which we have that in a way I think you understand what I'm saying like we know God can like brother said God can pull our card any time and we'll go up to heaven like you that's what I'm talking about like we have respect for God God's timing is perfect and God can do anything he wants with our lives God doesn't owe me anything God doesn't owe us anything he already paid it all praise God Amen he already paid it all Jesus Paid It all all to him I owe praise God right so we see this here that the Lord sends Lions among them so notice the uh and Charles Spurgeon noticed there there's three states the first first state is they have no fear of the Lord so it's people coming into God's land they don't fear God at all and so what does God do because they won't fear God they got their Idols God sends in Lions to give them some level of fear of the Lord right Hallelujah and this is God's grace right because they're probably doing all their uh burning of children right they're probably doing all their loudness of sexual immorality along with all the idolatry that normally uh accp ined it and God said no you're not going to do that here this is Holy Ground amen verse 26 therefore they spake to the king of Assyria saying the Nations which thou Hast removed and place in the cities of Samaria know not the manner of the god of the land therefore he has sent Lions among them and behold they slay them because they know not the manner of the god of the land so these some these uh heathens now living in Samaria they realize okay this is all happening because we don't know the ways of God this is there's a certain way of God how many know there's a way of God in this church Hallelujah every church right brother Jim brother cam brother uh uh brother Samuel there's a manner God has a manner God uh God demands respect brother Braham says that's the fear of the Lord there God demands it Hallelujah you got to have it right the the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and so these heathens come in they begin sacrificing they've been doing all their wicked idolatry to the full exent God sends lions in to slay them verse 27 then the king of Assyria commanded saying carry thither one of the priests whom he brought from th and let them go and dwell there and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in bethl and taught them how they should fear the lord so look they they have to say you know uh if if if if we don't know God we need a preacher to get help us to know the word of God how can we hear how can we believe except God sends us a preacher so see it's always been God's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah God's always had a preacher to help people and what does the preacher do he gives them the light the key of knowledge the Bible says the key of knowledge the entrance of light right opens up God's word hallelujah so he sends a priest and tell them they should fear God this is a holy land right this is God's land we need to fear God verse 29 how be every nation made gods of their own and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made and every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt and the men of Babylon made Sako benoth and the men of cth made nural and the men of HTH made Ashima verse 31 and the aites made nibhaz and tarac and the sephar sites burnt their children in the fire to adrc and animik the gods of sepher vain so here the Bible tells us plainly these heathens moved in and they were doing the wickedness of sacrifices now again look how much mercy God has on America right 70 million abortions probably more since the 1970s when they changed the law yet we still get rain we still get God's spirit falling among us we still get blessings God gives everybody the rain falls and the just and the unjust our God is full of Mercy rich in Mercy hallelujah amen but God sent because of that was his land he sent Lions there to slay them to wake them up this is not just any land you just can't live however you what in this land This Is My Land even though it's in a backsliding condition my goodness they were burning their children in the fire verse 32 so here's now the second condition the first condition they did not fear God and now in verse 32 they begin to get a partial fear of God so they feared the Lord and made unto themselves of the lowest of them Priests of the high places which which sacrific for them in the houses of the high places now look what they do they they learn from one priest but then they make false priests or they they develop their own priesthood they didn't get the five-fold ministry see so they just like the like we read this morning or we mentioned it the Bible said they' heaped to themselves teachers having itching ears to tell them what they want to hear I don't want to get killed by lion but I also love my other gods I don't want to go all the way with God I like to have some pleasures of the world as well the church said see where we're going Jesus said don't let the cares of the world distract you Idols right don't let uh Mammon don't let God Be Your I'm sorry don't let money be your God all these cares of the world so they start their own tape boy Ministry I'll say but it could be a false five-fold too that's just a little joke there they they develop a false priesthood so that's the point we're making yes and preachers in the Catholic priests in the Catholic church and preachers in the Methodist Baptist Lutheran message anywhere if they're not filled with the Holy Ghost they could be these false priesthood right it's the same thing in other words any preacher that will let you compromise and enjoy pleasures of the world that's not a real preacher Hallelujah I don't always enjoy you know a a hard sermons I don't like to preach hard sermons but I know I got to because church I'm not going to answer to you I'm going to answer to Christ for what I preached that's why I don't apologize if I preach on sin I'm not going to apologize that's what God called me to do Hallelujah but see look look what the world does look what compromisers do they get fake preachers or false preachers that'll let them enjoy pleasures of sin and also have a knowledge of the Lord a partial fear of God this is what happens to many churches right so now we find out that these uh these these people in Samaria they're impersonators right they have a partial fear of God but not a true fear of God they're worshippers but not true worshippers right remember John 4:23 and 24 says the father's looking for true worshippers those who will worship Him in spirit and truth so did these people in Samaria did they have the right Spirit no did they have the truth well partial but they didn't have all the truth God was looking for true worshippers he was looking for young men that would worship God with all their heart soul mind and strength Hallelujah that's what he was looking for he wasn't looking for a partial surrender he was looking for a total surrender praise God hallelujah so we see it from the the uh text plainly the devil will uh give people the preachers they want to help them to compromise and enjoy the pleasures of sin but also have an idea about the manner of the message or a manner of Jesus they know the manner of Jesus but they don't know Jesus does that sound familiar Matthew 7 they say Lord Lord Jesus said many will say Lord Lord did we not prophesy did we not cast out devils and done many wonderful Works he said I never knew you look they knew they knew the manner of the Holy Spirit they knew how to cast out Devils prophesy do many one they knew the manner for Supernatural but they didn't know Christ Ah that's what we need today we need men and women that know Jesus Christ Hallelujah they know the love for Christ the love for the word of God hallelujah but see God's looking for true worshippers so see Satan will always imit imitate true worshippers so see how Satan He he'll give them a partial fear of the Lord but not the full fear of the Lord and we've seen that amongst us as we as we said all the people that fall away so sad but of all the people that fall away uh they could be they could be genuine some of them are some of them we don't know but what what happens is Satan imitates repentance I've seen that I've told you many times people will cry over sin but it's only worldly sorrow because they got caught but the next day they go out and do the same thing they cried about the day before there's no real change there's no real repentance there's no hatred for sin right see and that's what's happening here they have a form of there it is a form of godliness but they're denying the power thereof that's Hallelujah see Satan can imitate uh right he can imitate the True Believer they're false Christ they have the right anointing they have the Christ anointing to do works but when they're not under that anointing they're living a false life they're living in iniquity praise God yes remember Hezekiah was king of Judah Judah was the southern part right Samaria now if I'm looking at you guys Samaria was a Northwestern up there if I'm not mistaken I have to get out my Israel map here but remember the northern countries of Israel had all been taken away and so in this section of of Samaria uh the Syrian King filled it in with heathens right but there was still a faithful Remnant praise God there was still a faithful group down there in the south Southern Judah praise God God gave him a faithful King by hezekiah's name Hallelujah I always loved him because he started at 25 I started ping at 25 so I love I always love Hezekiah when I get over there brother brother uh uh Patrick I'm GNA tell him your testimony meant something to me and it did when I first became a pastor I preached on Hezekiah because I was like wow he's 25 I'm 25 I'm gonna tell Hezekiah you meant a lot to me brother when I needed Hezekiah he was there amen the word of God about Hezekiah was there Hallelujah that's right now church we can see here now we get to the second state they didn't fear God and now they fear God to a partial amount but it's not the fear the loving obedience and church we we're going to read this chapter never read this chapter in your private life too never does it ever say they made sacrifices to God never does it say they kept the Feast of Israel so see they just they never really showed real repentance they never sacrificed Bullock or ax or goat or sheep they never did these sacrifices they just learned about the message but they didn't have the real heart for the message that's what we've seen a lot right people come in they try to live it for a while pretty soon they can't live it right they never really get the real uh experience with God verse 32 so they feared the Lord this is their second state and again finny recognized three states and made unto themselves of the lowest so yeah that was the priest yes so that was the second part they made themselves priests so they have to learn uh intellectually brother Ram said I've been listening to the Corinthians book of Correction by Brother Ram 1957 what a it was a Bible study before brother Neville preached did you know that it was a real it was just like an hour nine minutes and uh brother B was talking about that he's like these Corinthians they just had an intellectual conception with God he said they were trusting in their prophecies they were trusting in their tongues they were trusting in their Sensations he said but a lot of them because they kept sinning and they didn't mourn over sin he said they just had an intellectual conception and that's exactly what's happening here these people they just have an intellectual con conception this is what I'm told the message is about this is what I'm told God uh is like but they never had God on the inside of them praise God hallelujah that's right so we see this second stage well now they'll fear God so they don't get killed by the the Lions and so Charles Spurgeon says look they were converted by lions I thought that was a really good thought Lions drew them to church in other words Lions drew them to the message and brother Charles finny said I've seen it in our church he said said a a family in the Church of England he said their child will pass away and that'll bring the dad into church and F he'll finally start serving God but if he comes for that reason alone then it wasn't a real conversion it's because a lion devoured his child brother BR talked about it brother you might remember this brother BR talked about people they only get uh experience in their intellects and he said they'll come to the altar can you stand up here brother CLA and uh brother R said they'll say oh you know your mother died she's in heaven don't you want to be with your mother and brother Ram said he saw preachers try to say you know get them emotionally worked up see if you want to go be with your mom you got to get right with God right and brother man said then they would serve God for a little bit then they'd Fall Away brother man said he's working on the wrong thing he's working on his emotions rather than the soul let's give our brother two claps since is Sunday night bless you he said he's working on here instead of down there in the soul that's right Hallelujah is that right so Charles Spurgeon sees this as a false conversion it's not a genuine conversion and again how do you know because they still allowed Idols in their lives right they only played message they only played church God help us we don't want to play church that's why that's why you're here tonight you don't want to play church I don't want to play church so the Lions converted them to change some of their Behavior we've seen it before too you know I can't remember but years ago I used to tell this testimony I can't remember now but somebody was dying I think it was in Lime I can't remember but they they they they told us if God heals us they'll serve God and God did some miracle there and they came to church for a while but eventually fell away and I remember telling my wife or I told somebody there I was like man God healed them and then they told God they served God and then they fell away what was it a lion conversion I'm going to die the lions are after me so yes I'll start to acknowledge God I'll get to know the manner of God but not have real love for God everybody see that everybody see that this is what we have we have a partial service to God not a complete surrender to God I've always loved this chapter it's always been always meant a lot to me now church can someone be saved by Terror I think the answer is yes Jude 1:22 and 23 qua I think the answer is yes I've used this before and of I'm sorry Jude uh 122 and of some have compassion making a difference see we don't we can't have compassion on everybody but we got to be led to have compassion on some people and others Sav with fear pulling them out of the fire eing even the Garment spotted by the flesh we get the picture of the Angels pulling lot out of Sodom some people are just going to have to drag them into church or some people you might you might save them that way and in that they might you know like lot they turn around or I'm sorry they didn't turn around the wife turn around but feeling the heat and feeling the destruction they had a a respect for God and they got saved so I want to let you know you know there's a balance on this so uh between the foolish virgins and the make Believers like Jud Judas scariot so Judas the scariot would have been one of these partial fear of the Lord because what' he keep he kept the idol of money the Bible said he was a thief in his heart right just like the Rich Young Ruler what was the one thing he wouldn't give up money his love for money right so there was one thing that always remained there in his life Judas he never gave money and the maybe the security of it and and not trusting in money the love of money he never gave that over to the Lord but we see here some people you might save with fear they might have a genuine oh God thank you for saving me and they might have love most often salvation comes by God showing his goodness to people and then they repent out of their love for Christ Romans 2:4 or desp despises thou The Riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of God leadth thee to repentance amen see so I hope that was your case now Church you might have the other case but I hope it's your case now that you've served God the reason we serve God is because he's been so good to us amen amen no one's been better to me than God Almighty amen I've had some good friends some good Brothers good sisters I have good relatives we've had some good friends there in Ritman my we've had some wonderful friends there some of the finest friends you could ever ask for but nobody's been better to us than the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah and that's how God Saves people he showed them as goodness everybody remember the prodigal what caused him to leave uh the the pig pens of the world he remembered even my father wouldn't treat me this bad even if I just go to my father and say sorry surely he'll treat me better right the Devils treat me so bad but I know God he'll have mercy on me he'll have compassion on me Hallelujah so it was love it was the goodness of God my father's got a good heart the Heavenly father's got an eternity good heart Hallelujah and the Heart of the Father the goodness of God is expressed To Us by the Holy Spirit he's wooing us he's drawing us right he's drawing us unto him and therefore we can respond and we can run to the father again and again that's a good song we got to learn that song If we haven't yet learned it Allelujah so see the priests allowed this kind of a mixed life and as your pastor I'm not going to allow that by God's grace as far as I can't change what you you decide or I decide but I can preach the truth hallelujah do not mix the uh pleasures of this world with a Christian Life Hallelujah cannot mix them Hallelujah if you make a mistake confess it uh get it under the blood and serve Jesus Christ make Jesus Christ your joy and your passion Hallelujah do not mix uh a worldly life life with a real Christian Life Hallelujah like I told you before remember there was one family that they confessed to me later said every time our our worldly family came in we'd always skip church to be with them and the and then the individual confessed it to me and said it was wrong God never had first place oh Lord I hope everybody looks at their heart tonight does God have first place in your heart is God your number one above anything that's what we need need today Hallelujah we need a heart that's fully surrendered to Christ amen hallelujah so the preachers allow them to live in this uh it's a double life I'll say it like that church you don't want to lead lead a double life you'll you'll you'll live with condemnation guilt uh all the all the attacks of the enemy you'll never have any real love or Joy or Freedom or Victory God gives us so much freedom and victory it ought to be a joy to come to the house of God and praise God hallelujah as a pastor I get nervous when people won't praise the Lord right like what's their life I'm told to watch over the souls amen like one time I you know I said uh this I never heard a certain brother say Amen uh for years I never heard I never seen the brother come up for prayer and turned out he ended up leaving the message he never had a real experience with God and then I found out later he would watch all these NBA basketball games I mean come on waste three hours then you can't pray you know you can't uh come up for prayer I mean what that that that's called making love to the world that's loving the world you can't love God in the world either love one or hate the other is that right we got to love God the righteousness of Christ amen let's love God with all of our hearts amen hallelujah so these these people in Samaria they never got real repentance they never got a real confession of sin they never kept all the word of God remember brother man said what' he say the evidence was church he said the evidence of the Holy Ghost was what in the word all the way that's what he says in the church age book now I believe it's all the words so I believe it's fruits of the Holy Spirit yes you'll have gifts yes you'll have a life free from sin it's all that it's all the word right yes you'll believe the message for your day the message for your day is bring forth fruits right it's harvest time right you'll have all that Hallelujah and we got to have all that but that's a real life that's in the word all the way brother R said you always have something in your heart saying Lord I want to do something for you so what are you doing that's a good question right what are you doing what are you doing for the Lord that's the question we got to ask ourselves tonight what are we doing for the Lord who am I helping am I a hero for the Lord let's be that by God's grace let's be that Hallelujah I liked what um I like what Spurgeon said he said if we do not worship God alone then we worship no God at all talking about the true God it's a it's quite a good statement I love Spurgeon he's he's gifted brother and he'll always be a preacher right brother manam said whatever you are in this life you'll be that in the next life so he'll be giving us nuggets in heaven brother my goodness brother Spurgeon Hallelujah see God wants all worship that's the only kind he takes that's right and it was proven as Spurgeon said it was proven in the temple of deeon remember they put the Ark of the Covenant in there what happened the gods fell down there was all kinds of gods in there and as long as God wasn't in there all the gods could exist but when God came in there he cast them down that's right that's what happens in your life if God comes in your life the idols will come crashing down Hallelujah because God can't stand God won't put up with a partial service to God a partial life Liv for God God wants your whole life are the children hearing me too by God's grace we want them to know it from a young age by God's grace God wants the full worship Hallelujah that's right when God comes in he shames every Idol As we sing that song He shames every Idol Hallelujah He reigns without rival our Jehovah Hallelujah now we go down to verse 33 now we get to the third and final condition first they didn't fear God second they begin to fear God but it's only a beginning they don't go all the way so they saw all these lions killing all their loved ones like oh God we we better learn to fear God but once the Lions left then they started going to this next mixture they feared the Lord and they served other gods so they stopped the burning of the children but they still would go out and make sacrifices to the idols they went as far as they could go without the Lions there to kill them well as long as I can get away with a little bit that's what I want to get away with as a Christian we don't want to get away with any sin we want God to spank us when we make a mistake right we want God to correct us amen hallelujah amen Lord don't let me get by without correcting me correct me if you love me you'll correct me praise God hallelujah amen is that right so now we see the third and this is the worst condition the third and final this is the worst condition like the Bible said it' been better for Judas not to be born than to be born to know the truth and then fail to walk in it so these people are like Judas the scar they're like the uh the people people that had Miracles but they kept living in iniquity right they had a partial anointing but not the full anointing to live a life that pleases Christ Hallelujah so that's how we apply it to the New Testament right we got to find some new testament examples what is a where's a false conversion in New Testament Matthew 7 Judas scariot right they learn to fear God in a little minor way but they don't fear God all the way with loving obedience Hallelujah they feared the Lord and served their other gods after the manner of the Nations whom They Carried Away from then Charles Spurgeon said no in in his time of life there was no country greater than England he said because he used this verse about the Nations he said no country has more of the gospel and look they had the they had the uh the the sanctification message right because John Wesley lived in the 1700s Spurgeon was 1800s they had the sanctification message he said there's no uh greater Church in all the world than in England as far as God has just gave them a Revival through John Wesley and he was trying to keep the revival going he said but I found I I find our greatest Idol in England is alcoholism drunkenness now what did Brother Ram say is americaas you remember what brother R say entertainment I'm going to say that again what brother Ram say entertainment the church said so there's what drunkenness physical drinking alcohol getting drunk in fact Spurgeon said one man I know he said he said I feel most spiritual when I have four or five glasses of alcohol in me then I can finally talk about God Spurgeon said you are not a Christian right you're not a Christian if you need that to talk talk about God in fact we have a friend that that's how her mom's like her mom will only talk about God when she's Saed drunk I think the word is for so sad so sad and that that that's the hypocrisy of that woman she'll only talk about Jesus when she's drunk but everybody knows Christians don't get drunk on natural wine they get drunk on spiritual wine hallelujah praise God they love God they worship God that's when they get drunk on the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen and so what what do people I'll say like this what do message people in America get drunk on entertainment Hallelujah I can hear it's quiet I understand that but church we have to all examine Our Lives entertainment anything that pulls away your love and devotion for God you just try to entertain yourself that's the God of this evil age at least in America at least right now I said at least because there is a persecution coming a minor one brother Ram says in other words there's a squeeze coming down where we're going to be able to see we're going to see the United States government changing its laws right we're going to see them brother M said remember remember there's I have five I made a video last week uh there's at least five verses God's trying to fulfill not all scriptures are fulfilled that's why the Rapture hasn't happened but one of them is revelation 13:16 can we pull that up there hun brother Braham says I believe according to revelation 146 the bride will be forced to stop preaching the word of God before the Rapture so he calls his all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads brother Ram says this the causing alls this is the squeeze when the Beast system starts getting ready to lay down its Mark and they say you can't preach anymore brother Jesse then we should know the rapture's on it's time for the squeeze right it's time to get ready for the latter rain Hallelujah now we should be ready for it at all times because brother man said it could happen in just a matter of hours right just like uh Jesus's arrest uh crucifixion and and death burial Resurrection all those scores of scriptures were fulfilled in a matter of three or four days right is that right Hallelujah that's what we see in the word of God we got to be ready Hallelujah at any time we must have our our devotion fully given to the Lord we must have our lamps trimmed and clear Hallelujah so the third and final worst condition was they fear the lord to some degree but they let the idols remain in their lives the cares of this world Jesus said and then remember he said eating and drinking like the days of Noah right all these things that's what we're battling entertainments right cares of the world keeping our minds focused on the Lord look at verse 34 unto this day they do after the former manners they fear not the Lord so isn't it it's almost like a contradiction in verse 33 said they feared the Lord but then verse 34 says they didn't fear the lord see because God doesn't count a half-hearted effort as fear of the Lord hallelujah amen glory so it says they fear the lord that means to some degree but they still let the idols exist in their life and so then God says well they fear the lord but they didn't really fear the lord does everybody understand they had a partial fear of God but not a total fear of God all right appreciate everybody staying with me they fear not the Lord neither do they after their Turn the Page in my scofi Bible statutes or after their ordinances or after the law and commandment which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob whom he named Israel so see they didn't keep all the commands they just kept some of them that okay this is the way God kind of works in your life right so sisters you just kind of want to have long hair kind of want to wear skirts Brothers you just want to try to be a nice guy all the time and now the Bible don't say the nice inherit the kingdom of God the Bible said those who are born again inherit the kingdom of God Glory Hallelujah see they only get part of the word they don't get a full fear of the Lord verse 35 with whom the Lord had made a covenant in charge them saying ye shall not fear other gods nor bow yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them Hallelujah verse 36 but the Lord who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm him shall ye fear and him shall you worship and to him shall you do sacrif oh I love this point Spurgeon brought this out no wonder they couldn't worship God these these these uh Babylonians that moved in no wonder they couldn't worship God because they've never been brought out of Egypt Glory Hallelujah how many can say God brought you out of Egypt hallelujah amen God saved my soul God brought me out of captivity to sin I've been through the waters I've been baptized hallelujah amen I've ate the Mana of the word hallelujah I know it's like to be in Egypt he brought brought me out of the my clay he set my feet on a rock to St Hallelujah brother William he puts a song in my soul today Hallelujah that's why these people didn't fear God they hadn't been delivered by God but if you've ever met God if you've ever been delivered by God you can't help but fear Him and love him with loving obedience hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen woo I love this this beautiful chapter to me amen uh to me it's the word becoming real this is jump to me this jumps off the pages and now I can see uh partial Believers in the message right or denominational churches they got a partial fear of God but they don't serve God all the way it's because they've never really come out of Egypt they didn't experience what you and I experienced Hallelujah that's why brother said if someone wants to get re-baptized he said go ahead and let them just give them an just he said make sure they have a conscience that I've come out of Egypt amen some of our young children might grow up and they might feel like well maybe I need to be re-baptized guess what I'll be right there to re-baptize them because whatever they need for their conscience to be true with God we're going to do it by God's grace they need to know that they know that they know that I was lost but now I'm found Hallelujah I was blind but now I see Hallelujah amen I was a rich but God's Amazing Grace came and rescued me hallelujah amen is that right sister Anna Hallelujah I like that smile you got on your face there Hallelujah I know it's like God brought me out of the my clay Hallelujah he brought me out of Egypt I was there and happened amen I was led by the prophet of God I was led by acts 238 amen I was brought out of the my clay Hallelujah I was there and it happened I ought to know praise God but these people now they were just kind of planted in there they didn't have the same experience that God's people had and I even remember one of these brothers that's left the message he said his mom forced him to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ at the Bram Tabernacle and he said he fought it all the way down then he ended up turning away from the message and he told me to my face he said I don't think the Lord Jesus Christ baptism is right I think fathers and Holy Ghost is okay so what do we need we need each person to have a genuine experence I want to be baptized because I want to die to myself and I want Christ to live in me praise God that's what I want I'm worthy of hell I'm worthy of death my sins is what nailed to the cross but his life and his mercy and his forgiveness and his blood now comes upon me and I can live a life of Christ Hallelujah because he died for my sins Glory how many want that kind of a pure heart right there can we see the beautiful uh Revelations from this chapter there's so much connection to our life people just get they move into the message or they just move into a church and they just try to act like everybody else like pretty soon you learn how to you I learn how to sit and I I I learn how to say how you doing I learn how to say I'm pressing the battles like everybody else are you pressing the battles right right right right brother Mercy he's laughing yeah I I learned right away how to act around message people just be nice and night just be nice right just say oh I'm doing okay praise God and that that's it you know just got to shake a few hands and you can leave but where's the real Spirit of Christ that wants to care for your brother and sister right where's that real the real heart to serve your your family praise God hallelujah talking about real religion here about God's grace religion is a good thing when it's pure so they had false religion they had an impostor religion they only obeyed some of God's commands but they still enjoyed all of their idolatry well partial idolatry they still served other gods and so they fear the lord but God said you really don't fear God they had a terror of the Lord but not a real love for the Lord hallelujah verse 37 and the statutes and ordinances and the law and the Commandment which he wrote for you you shall observe to do forever and you shall not fear other gods verse 38 and the Covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget neither shall ye fear other gods so because you're a covenant people you don't fear the world you don't fear other gods because God made a promise to each one of us God made you and and I a promise God brought us into the Covenant so we do not fear other gods Hallelujah we do not fear what man shall do to us because God has joined us into the Covenant Hallelujah remember the Bible said Moses sprinkled blood on them remember he sprinkled blood and the he said I'm sprinkling you because now this represents I'm joined and Peter says you're sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah praise God Amen so when you obey the word of God and God convicts you and you obey the holy spirit it's like you've been sprinkled now I'm walking in obedience now I've been baptized now I'm getting Sanctified and pretty soon that sprinkling comes into your soul it's a baptism of the Soul praise God so you start with the sprinkling but then the baptism comes into you sometime later praise God am the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that right Peter said that you're sprinkled you're joined to the Covenant when you start obeying the word of God but you have to have a baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's right now I'm looking back to the word I'm almost done here I'm not sure when I started Hallelujah verse 39 but the Lord your God ye shall fear and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies what a promise church if you just love God if you just love God all the days of your life he'll deliver you out of every trial I can ask my wife and say Lord say darling has the Lord delivered us out of every trial yeah every trial brother William has the Lord delivered you out of every trial Hallelujah does God keep his word see if we fear God if we take the right approach to God if we have love for God he's going to back us up he's going to fight our battles for us amen hallelujah God promised if we give him all of ourselves he'll give all of him to us hallelujah oh my what a blessing Hallelujah I hope somebody's ready for communion praise God hallelujah glory to God now look at the sad State as we close this look at the sad State verse 40 how beit they did not hearken but they did after their former manner so they got a a little bit of cleaning up they clean up a little bit out of their lives until the Lions went away but then as soon as they weren't afraid of the Lions anymore they well I can try a little bit of this I can go a little further with this and pretty soon God just let them he didn't send the Lions anymore because that's what they wanted right read it the Bible never says he sends Lions again right God will give the God gives warning before judgment right he doesn't say how much he's going to give us the warning but here they got a warning after a while they just got kind of cold on God and they go back right doing the same things they did but they had an understanding about God they knew the manner of God that's what they did verse 41 so these nations fear the lord and serve their graven images both their children now look how sad this is this is what happens in the message right if you get grandparents right or you get a couple that doesn't serve God or they serve God partially what happens then their children just serve God partially and church it always gets worse in the second generation if they don't have a genuine experience with God right and then those children have children and now it's three generations later and they're doing the same things they did at the beginning same sins so these nations fear not the Lord and serve their graven images both their children and their children's children as did their fathers so they do unto this day but thank God God had a little group of people there who are having Revival Hallelujah Hezekiah brought them in to Revival praise God now Church you know what we need we we we need to know more than the manner of God well you know God's kind of like this and God kind of did this to brother brandham you know God kind of worked with brother Bram like this we need to know more than that we need to know more than the manner of God we need to know the heart of God that makes all the the difference these people were not after the heart of God they just want to know about God so I don't get into trouble I can still have my pleasure filled life how can I uh avoid you know the Lions of this world and still uh kind of respect God but then still enjoy the pleasures of sin that's what their minds were on our mind should be on how much sin can I get rid of praise God and how much righteousness can I can I live for Christ and this this went from generation to generation to the Next Generation how important it is for us parents right to live a life worthy of the gospel because our children are going to see how did Mom and Dad live hallelujah it's so important because our lives are going to be examples footsteps to the Next Generation praise God so we don't want false conversions church we don't want lions trying to convert US to follow the message we should have a heart that loves God and it should be the conviction of the holy spirit that comes upon us if we make a mistake God Lord forgive me convict me and then let me get my heart right with you may you be my joy may you be my song may you be my passion Hallelujah I don't want to mix anything with my pure love for Jesus Christ Hallelujah but that's what they wanted they wanted to mix the things of the world with the things of the message right so they mixed it and what they get they got Generations I'll say generations of vipers I might as well say that because that's what they were religious but not living the full word of God hallelujah so what do we see we see like I've been preaching on that's why I thought this was inspired too double mindedness right well I better do this I better do my and that's what Charles Vinnie said too sorry Charles Spurgeon he said there's so many people in our church they're just there for the ritual of it they just come to the ritual but as soon as they leave they go back out to their drinking or they gambling or they're smoking or whatever it is actually did you know he smoked one cigar every Sunday for the glory of God did you know that that's that man age they didn't have the full Revelation Martin Luther would drink alcohol and Charles Spurgeon it was I watched a video of his uh his weekly routine every Sunday uh I think it was on the drive home from the second service they had two Services every Sunday he said he would smoke a cigar to the glory of God that's what he said for the good of his health he died at 57 church so let's not take that uh let's not take that literally okay they didn't know better in those days they didn't know was cancerous they didn't know these things God the Bible said God Winks at ignorance when you don't know but church we know we know we need to live a higher life but see the double-mindedness of these of these so-called message Believers or so-call Methodist so-called Baptist so-called Pentecostals they got their minds on the things of God boy we we went to some good Pentecostal Church man they can really remember we went to that big AC church over there boy no nothing against them but man they can really shout out they come really prayed and screamed and shouted when they walk away they got uh makeup rolling down their face they're walking away in their high heels you know walking away in their high heels like like they did something well what did you do what did you just do you just mixed religion with the cares of the world the love of the world Hallelujah and I hope God answers their prayers but what is it it's a mixture of Love of the world and some of the things of God there's going to be a people that are in the word all the way GL there's going to be a people that live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God hallelujah brother Cam and I put out that podcast yesterday and that's the first scripture cam uh brought out the NIV says man shall not live by bread of alone and then that's it it cuts out live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and you know I debated one of these guys on the debate I'll probably hear from him or hear somebody else I'm just going to delete their email because they they've shown their colors but he he used that in the debate he said uh he said you can't because I was using Matthew 4:4 we live by every word we got to be justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost he said nobody can live by that now that was his time to talk and by the time it was my my turn I'd forgot to respond to that but see they take offense at that they don't want to give God all that they have but as Christians we should want to give God all that we have praise God that should be a joyful invitation yes I'll serve you with all my heart I I I I get to do every word of God and and the Bible makes it so easy the Bible said love fulfills all the law of God hallelujah it makes it so easy if you just love your neighbor as yourself love the church as yourself you fulfill all the law but that's what those new uh I'm going to on that again pretty soon the Bible I'm sorry the Bible translations man those are wicked oh my goodness I I can hardly stand it but but I I even told a brother this morning I said brother he said you're a cult of King James version I said I am no cult I said I got saved in the NIV Bible and the church said I'm not some cult starter I've always said it I'm gonna be respectful I'm respectful with that but I'm not gonna be respectful to the for the to the devil who's taking out words out of the Bible I'm preaching against the devil and the system not these people like that's what brother R said brother would blast denomination day in day in day night in Night Out day in day out he said but I'm not against the people I'm against that system that serpent that's biting the people hallelujah so that's what I am too by God's grace I'll still smile and say Hey you can read whatever Bible you want you could get saved out of there but you got to be careful it's taken away from the word of God you can still get saved in the NIV but if you really love God you want to go in God's word all the way have I warned anybody out tonight have I warn anybody out Hallelujah all right I'm going to try to finish up here so see Church the thing for us is that like I said with the foolish virgin this this is the issue with foolish virgin and the make believer because they both kind of engage in some of these uh partial message or partial truth but then they still have Idols in their life but we are assured of this first Corinthians 3:13 we are sure of this church God help us every man's work shall be made manifest God is going to show what everyone's work was all about their lives and their Ministry Hallelujah sometimes you wonder how did that brother do that why did that sister do that God's going to show it to us hallelujah for the day shall declare it what the day of the Judgment because it shall be revealed by fire the white Throne judgment and fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is verse 14 if any man's work abide which he hath built upon he shall receive a reward see Church we're either listen we're either building for the pleasures of the Lord or the pleasures of our flesh what are we building for what who we trying to be a hero for ourselves or for some somebody else see the day of judgment is going to manifest what was this all about the the the day of judgment will manifest why did I preach this gospel it'll manifest the sermon brother B said I'll be judged by the sermons I preached why am I preaching this so you and I can have pure religion so you and I will get rid of any Idol of our lives and have the true fear of the Lord hallelujah has anybody thought about that recently how many sermons have you heard on the fear of the Lord from other message preachers or just sermons that you is it a lot or very few what anybody can say it out loud a lot or few few that's what I thought I've seen few and yet the Bible says it's sister Lena it's the principal thing sister Lydia the fear of the Lord is the princip it's the most important thing where are our desires what's the and church I don't get wrong I love Miracles I I love to testify when people give us Miracles but that's what I feel like I feel like people are so into Miracles and and Supernatural just wanting to have some type of testimony they forget the part about the fear of God hallelujah the fear of the Lord we want both and I like I said I've seen it this year by God's grace I've seen Miracles I've seen it very thankful for God's grace I didn't I didn't read First Corinthians 3:15 if any man's work shall be burned in other words all of his preaching or all of his giving to the poor whor is burned up it wasn't done with the real fear of the Lord he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved so this is a foolish virgin this is not the samarit the the moved in Samaritans from Assyria in first uh 2 Kings 17 these are people that are saved so this is the lot this is the uh the foolish version that's saved right might be the Nicodemus or the Gia right think about that brother I just struck garia taught all those Jewish things but that's all going to be burnt but he could still be saved think about that you work 35 years and you can retire right that's what they tell us in America you know by the time I get up there it's going to be 45 I'm be 85 year old man come on kids let's do our Phonics work today come on let's clap I'll be having my uh what do they call those things cane I'll be walking there with my cane all right now let's dance and praise the Lord kids let me sitting down my cane so I can praise the Lord but think his whole life Gia as wise as he was it was all burned up he spent all those years teaching the law of the Jews it's all going to be burned up but yet he could be saved don't you want your life to count for something praise God don't you want to reward Peter Peter said what do we get Lord we've forsaken everything I Ed brother amen is that good example that's just like Peter amen's just like Peter I left my father's house what do we get Jesus said you get H hundredfold now and in in the life to come right we forsaken all what does God do he gives us all the blessings Hallelujah in this life and in the Life to Come Hallelujah sacrifice all for Christ it's a beautiful story and this is what we should want for our lives a life that has the true fear of the Lord hallelujah let's go to First Corinthians 10 I got a couple more scriptures I want to end with 1 Corinthians 10 verse 13 well now if you look at verses 1 through1 13 this is all about Israel and Israel is another good example just like Judas and because many of them the Bible said died in the wilderness and they were lost God brought out a mixed multitude there it is amen there it is hallelujah the mixed multitude that's kind of what this Ser sermon is about the mixed multitude right some of them believe some of them didn't believe right some of them really praised God some of them just did it as a as a routine as a ritual right the Bible said they all drank the spiritual drink they all uh ate the meat the Mana they all got baptized in the water right they all went through these religious acts but not all of them had the fear of the Lord the love of God hallelujah only three right made it over other other than the ones that were 20 and under right Joshua Caleb and whose other one uh Joshua Caleb Miram didn't Miriam make it over no she didn't that's right she died okay two made it over plus all the 20 and under verse 13 there hath no temptation to taking you but such as as common to man but God is faithful I love those two words but God Church remember when you go through tests when you go through trials someone's been through this before you're not the only one who's ever battled this before I say like this but even greater the people that battled it overcame it by the same thing you can overcome it by Hallelujah the answer is the same for each and every one of us it's the love of God it's the charity amen doesn't the Bible say brother the love of God hides a multitude of sin I thought I'd hear a a louder shout on that one amen the love of God covers over a multitude of sin Hallelujah so we all go through the same similar trials but God is faithful hallelujah it's faithful to have communion with us even after we're going through trials and we might give into some of those trials we might give into some of those Temptations but God is still willing to have fellowship if we'll confess our sins and walk in the light as he's in the light God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able lord I can't handle this this is above my pay grade no it's not is that right he won't test you above that you're able to Bear remember greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to Bear wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry see here he says it plainly Paul says it plainly a lot of our trials are just us being tempted by Idols right we're just tempted like like like Paul said a snare I'm brought into captivity so like there's a little trap and little by little we get a little closer well can I can I say this can I do that could I take that could I touch that could I could I say that and pretty soon they get trapped right but God always makes a way out praise God you don't have to stay there there's a way out of of Temptation there's a way out of sin it's called repentance amen hallelujah it's called trusting in the Living God hallelujah but notice dearly my he said my dearly beloved flee from idolatry so what got Israel all these things idolatry got them no matter all the spiritual acts they went through it was always idolatry that's what got these Assyrians in the Holy Land Hallelujah so remember Church what are some Idols that we got to overcome got to overcome the cares of this world in America you got to overcome entertainment so I like I like what uh brother Bram said we got to cast down entertainment for ourselves and he said we have to entertain Jesus hallelujah praise God Amen we got to entertain him and say Lord I Want To Worship You I Want To Praise You I want to listen to a sermon I want to read my Bible I want to pray I want to help somebody I want to call a saint I want to I want to be I want to Fellowship around the word of God hallelujah entertain Jesus right cares of the world entertainment brother Ram said sports figures right he said you can make your spouse an idol right you can make a car a piano he says so sorry buddy you can make you can make preachers Idols a lot of people do that like I told you uh the one person would say oh that brother's coming to town and then clean up their life but when the pastors preaching and they live a dirty life that's hypocrisy right that's idolatry I idolize that preacher in his gift more than any other preacher right but by by their fruits a person is known Hallelujah and of course money as we said the love of money is the root of all evil so let's stand to our feet musicians can come the partial fear of the Lord Lord is an awful state to be in there's a statement brother brandom says similar to this he said some people get only enough religion to make them miserable he said why would you only take enough religion to make you miserable he said why don't you get a religion that'll make you live that'll give you life and have it more abundantly praise God think about your life this week was it abundant in the grace of God do you feel like you were uh joying the abundance of God's love and the word of God that's what God offers to us the Abundant Life living in the Overflow praise God I'm living the Overflow of God's grace now I'm not talking about if you're going through a trial you might be but even in Trials you can praise God and you can feel God's presence in the storm how many understand that by God's grace let's bow our hearts here would you play that uh yeah you are my strength when I'm weak You're My All In All to these Assyrians in the Holy Land Jesus was not there all in all Jehovah wasn't there all in all we want God to be our all in all that's let's pray father God we thank you for the word of God tonight thank you for the attentiveness of your people they pull on the word of God they love the word of God they smile like our sister Anor there in the back lord God thank you that they love the word of God bless it to their hearts Lord if I say anything wrong you please pardon me Lord God you know the intents of my heart to help your people to feed the people the word of God lord we see in the scripture these people didn't want communion they just wanted to know about God but they didn't want to love God they didn't want to be a people after the heart of God but Lord we want to learn from that we want to be after the heart of God we want to be in the word all the way we want Jesus to be our all in all help us Lord when Temptations come when entertainment or cares of this [Music] life or maybe it's pride of life and maybe it's lust of the eyes lust of the flesh Lord whatever may be Lord help us when these Temptations and snares come upon us Lord God may we escape them Hallelujah may we flee from idolatry so we can keep the true fear of the Lord right Behavior with profound honor loving obedience Lord these are your people Lord you called me to feed them Lord I've realized that for 18 years Lord God I've tried to feed them the word of God help them Lord God to get every sin out of their lives help me Lord God to get every sin out of my life Lord God may we just have lives with unleavened conditions Hallelujah lives of the unleavened bread of the word of God hallelujah you can live happy living in the Overflow Lord God lord Jesus be our all in all today Lord God father I pray you bless the elements here bless my wife for making the communion bread and thank you for the Saints I believe it was brother amen sister who got us the wine Lord a few months back Lord thank you bless the elements Lord and those that have helped prepare them Lord God you've been gracious you've been good to us Lord God these are reminders that we want to partake of the word the body and partake of the Holy Ghost the wine the stimulation of Revelation Lord God we want to do it with a Pure Heart Lord God so in this next few moments of Silence Lord God may we search our hearts may we work out our own salvation with fear and trembling Lord God deal with every heart now for a few moments of Silence Saints let's have a few moments of Silence talk it over with the Lord now is the time for some communion reflecting on the word of God that we've heard
