[37:34] proverbs chapter 31 thank you rather
[37:38] large thank you sir let's go to proverbs
[37:44] chapter 31 3 verse 12
[38:00] we read verse 12 and then skip down to
[38:03] verse 34 our text this morning like to
[38:06] continue on the proverbs 31 woman we
[38:10] started that a few weeks ago about two
[38:12] weeks ago by God's grace I'd like to
[38:16] continue on that thought so you know I
[38:18] was thinking this is kinda like a
[38:19] Mother's Day message so if I don't
[38:21] preach a Mother's Day theme on Mother's
[38:23] Day well you got it a little early this
[38:25] year and who doesn't like early presents
[38:28] you know I I sure like early presents
[38:30] don't you so we'll see what the Lord has
[38:34] for us but just feeling you know really
[38:37] inspired here and in the Proverbs and
[38:39] really been blessed by the messages the
[38:43] Lord has given to us praise God
[38:45] proverbs 31 12 and then we'll go down to
[38:47] verse 30 these are the two attributes or
[38:49] these are the two foundations of a
[38:52] woman's life these two because these two
[38:56] are like the bookshelves or the bookends
[38:59] on a book on a bookshelf these hold this
[39:02] this portion together these two hold it
[39:05] together verse 12 let's read that
[39:07] together on three one two three she will
[39:09] do him good and not evil all the days of
[39:13] her life now let's go down to verse 30
[39:16] let's read that on three one two three
[39:18] favor is deceitful and beauty is vain
[39:22] but a woman that feareth the Lord she
[39:25] shall be praised amen
[39:28] these two scriptures are like the
[39:31] bookends of our lives
[39:33] remember this applies not only to
[39:34] natural women but to the church as well
[39:37] for the church is the wife of Christ
[39:40] that's just bow our heads you haven't
[39:42] eaten your heart just make it known unto
[39:43] the Lord as we approach the Word of God
[39:46] Father in heaven we thank you Lord again
[39:48] for today open our eyes Lord we want to
[39:52] see you this morning open our ears we
[39:56] want to hear you this morning that's all
[39:59] we ask Lord God is that we could
[40:01] experience fellowship we could
[40:03] experience communion with the eternal
[40:06] God who
[40:08] has revealed his name as the Lord Jesus
[40:10] Christ we're so grateful Lord for your
[40:14] spirit that we feel Lord God I'm humbled
[40:17] in your presence Lord God it's a sacred
[40:20] feeling Lord I never get used to it Lord
[40:22] God never Lord because I'm made of flesh
[40:26] Lord we're but Lord inside we grown to
[40:30] be clothed upon the body that's eternal
[40:33] in the heavens Lord God we desire that
[40:36] we're groaning for that Lord God how we
[40:39] love your presence dear God and we
[40:42] rejoice in your word Heavenly Father
[40:45] speak to us Lord through this Mother's
[40:47] Day message Lord God and help the whole
[40:50] church Lord all the brothers as well to
[40:52] see how our part is so crucial Lord God
[40:56] and as we Lord our types of the church
[41:00] or the Bride of Christ help us all to
[41:04] receive from thee this morning Lord let
[41:06] us hear thy voice loud and clear in
[41:09] Jesus Christ's name and the church said
[41:11] Amen god bless you two being seated
[41:13] praise the Lord so we're just grateful
[41:28] to be here in the service of the Lord
[41:31] this morning and looking forward to
[41:33] communion tonight by God's grace maokai
[41:36] you can switch over when you're ready

[41:46] to wear myself out today a couple years
[41:50] ago I lost my voice from preaching so
[41:52] hard from song leading so hard and I
[41:55] told the Lord I would never push myself
[41:57] too hard again if he could help me by
[42:00] His grace I got a I got a control my
[42:03] zeal so help me Jesus so we look at this
[42:07] well let's look at this is part 2 of the
[42:09] proverbs 31 woman but part 7 of the
[42:11] series so like to look at this thought
[42:13] and then tonight I don't know what I'm
[42:14] going to preach tonight I've just got
[42:15] numerous thoughts scattered so I need to
[42:17] get back to the church early and pray a
[42:19] little more and I'm not sure what I'm
[42:20] going to minister on to
[42:21] night so we'll see what the Lord has for
[42:23] us here so we read our text this morning
[42:25] you know these are the two foundations
[42:28] of a woman's testimony we also say the
[42:32] church you know this is the foundation
[42:34] now remember part one we a couple weeks
[42:37] ago we looked at the origin or author or
[42:39] the background of chapter 31 was either
[42:42] it was either Solomon or some proselyte
[42:45] king named lemuel I believe I'm more
[42:48] lean towards Solomon it just doesn't
[42:50] really make a whole lot of sense that
[42:51] there would be a proselyte king who was
[42:54] a Jew and then he wrote he had so much
[42:57] wisdom about a woman it would seem like
[42:59] Solomon would get that wisdom because he
[43:01] was the wisest man of all that's what it
[43:03] would seem like to me but I don't know
[43:05] for sure but anyways we saw the path of
[43:08] wisdom wisdom starts with God in this
[43:10] chapter wisdom starts with God and then
[43:13] it comes down to a mother a mother who
[43:17] made a vow and said God if you give me a
[43:20] son I know he's gonna be king I'll teach
[43:22] him the ways of God so in this chapter
[43:25] the wisdom went from God to a mother who
[43:29] made a vow for a son to be a faithful
[43:31] king and then the king would take this
[43:34] wisdom that he received from his mother
[43:36] no doubt later his tutors and his father
[43:38] but remember mothers the the first
[43:40] gospel or the fifth gospel right the
[43:42] first one that gets to the child or the
[43:44] RAM said before Matthew Mark Luke and
[43:46] John get their mother gets their amen
[43:48] and then that King would influence the
[43:51] entire nation remember this nation was a
[43:54] kingdom of king of kings and priests we
[43:57] know the Levites were the the Levitical
[43:59] priesthood the Aaronic priesthood we'd
[44:02] say but really every true believer in
[44:05] Israel was a king and priests unto God
[44:07] Amen just like us today we're kings and
[44:11] priests unto God hallelujah and so God
[44:15] determined this is the way wisdom would
[44:17] flow here in Israel this time or if it
[44:20] was a proselyte king in another nation
[44:23] remember there was that he she said this
[44:25] is the words of my prophecy so we saw it
[44:28] was prophetic if it applied to Solomon
[44:32] the
[44:33] because the the mother said ask for
[44:36] wisdom asked for judgment have a voice
[44:39] for the poor
[44:40] we saw how Solomon asked for wisdom
[44:42] later on he asked to judge this great
[44:44] people and then he and then he judged
[44:47] the harlots the right way you know so it
[44:50] seems prophetic and and also it seems
[44:53] prophetic in a sad way like a warning to
[44:55] Solomon who fell to women because the
[44:59] mother said stay away from wine and
[45:01] women all Kings need to stay away from
[45:03] strange women and excess wine
[45:07] so it seems prophetic in that way as
[45:09] well and then we ended by showing how
[45:13] these were a mother's words to her son
[45:15] the future King I'm sorry I kind of went
[45:18] over that already and then we ended with
[45:22] this how chapter 31 from verses I
[45:25] believe it's 10 all the way to 31 is an
[45:31] acrostic poem of the virtuous woman
[45:34] which means that every sentence begins
[45:37] with a different Hebrew letter all the
[45:39] Hebrew letters of the alphabet so this
[45:41] is what we're this is a nice picture I
[45:43] found on on Google so it starts with a
[45:48] woman of Valor who can finds that's one
[45:50] that's one Hebrew letter and so the rest
[45:53] of the the chapter each sentence begins
[45:58] with a different Hebrew letter that's
[45:59] quite a challenge if you tried to try to
[46:01] write a sentence about you're trying to
[46:03] try to round a poem about your spouse
[46:04] and begin every sentence with a
[46:07] different letter of the alphabet it was
[46:09] considered a highly skillful thing to do
[46:12] and we find the greatest poetry in God's
[46:15] Bible amen
[46:16] not Shakespeare or Homer her Iliad and
[46:19] he's they not like that the greatest
[46:21] poetry and writings are recording this
[46:24] Holy Bible that were so grateful to hold
[46:27] this morning amen so that's what we're
[46:29] saying an acrostic poem so in other
[46:32] words this is a poem about the A to Z of
[46:35] a godly woman and remember brother ram
[46:38] said Christ is the A to Z he is the
[46:41] Alpha and Omega so if this applies to a
[46:43] woman then this must mean that his bra
[46:46] has his full characteristics Amen now
[46:50] only Jesus had the full characteristics
[46:53] of the Father he was the fullness of the
[46:55] Godhead bodily but the bride
[46:58] so from we'd say from Ephesus to
[47:00] Laodicea the bride of all ages she would
[47:04] we say has the full characteristics of
[47:07] Christ's character because every one of
[47:09] her members was in the mind of Christ
[47:12] before the foundation of the world amen
[47:15] and the Bible said that Jesus chose us
[47:17] in him before the foundation of the
[47:20] world
[47:21] so all that Christ was all these
[47:23] characteristics all these desires he had
[47:25] he knew his wife would fully Express his
[47:28] character over the course of the Gentile
[47:31] church age Amen hallelujah she's in the
[47:35] word all the ways we saw that quote from
[47:36] the prophet of God that's why she's born
[47:38] again of the Holy Ghost she's washed by
[47:41] his blood and his all fare remember in
[47:45] the Song of Solomon I preached on that
[47:46] quite a few years ago now but but in one
[47:48] of the chapters it starts off with the
[47:50] husband and he he goes from feet to head
[47:52] and just lists all the beautiful things
[47:54] about her and then the bride takes her
[47:57] turn and she lists all the beautiful
[47:59] things about her husband and that's a
[48:02] great type of Christ who he loves
[48:04] everything abroad his bride amen she's
[48:06] all fair she's all beautiful she's all
[48:09] clean she's all holy amen
[48:12] she's all washed hallelujah she's
[48:15] expressing all of Christ's character to
[48:18] the world and so now you have an idea of
[48:20] this acrostic poem it's the A to Z and
[48:23] this that this then this this poem then
[48:28] shows all that a godly woman could
[48:30] accomplish in her life and I know how
[48:35] our sisters want to be godly women or
[48:36] else you wouldn't be here as as personal
[48:43] as the Word of God is you know how it
[48:45] cuts at men and women but especially at
[48:48] women in this we'd say this culture that
[48:50] seeks to magnify beauty and power and
[48:54] authority and influence and all these
[48:57] things that it magnifies for women in
[48:59] the
[49:00] of this dark lair to see an age god
[49:02] bless our sisters for wanting to be real
[49:04] proverbs 31 women amen
[49:06] and not being tempted by the things of
[49:09] the world but walking in the straight
[49:11] and narrow
[49:12] because even churches will tell you
[49:14] today oh it's okay for a woman to do
[49:16] this and okay for a woman to do that but
[49:18] we must look to the Word of God to give
[49:20] us all the answers to what type of
[49:23] characteristics a Christian woman should
[49:25] express hallelujah
[49:29] now let's we'll start working our way
[49:33] through here by God's grace so this is
[49:37] an acrostic poem and it's of an
[49:40] extremely rare and valuable life okay so
[49:45] in other words this woman is going to be
[49:47] very hard to find
[49:50] there's not many like this woman so
[49:56] she's hard to find and her price is far
[49:57] above rubies the Bible said who can find
[50:01] a virtuous woman her price is not just
[50:06] the price of rubies but far above rubies
[50:09] so brothers have you got a godly wife on
[50:12] the way home you should give her a
[50:14] little back massage with one hand if
[50:16] that's safe for you and you driver just
[50:18] recognize you're sitting next to
[50:20] millions of dollars how many believe
[50:24] that it's far above now not just Ruby
[50:30] Ruby's I'm going to show you the value
[50:34] of one carat of one Ruby and now my
[50:39] daughter fear not now this is speaking
[50:40] of the virtue who can find a virtuous
[50:43] woman Ruth was this way and Boaz says I
[50:49] will do to the all that thou requires
[50:51] amen I hope we have that desire this
[50:54] morning amen
[50:55] that Christ can do everything we require
[50:58] what Christ can meet all of our needs we
[51:01] just gotta ask him amen
[51:02] this is where she laid herself she was
[51:06] at the end of a rope she she that of a
[51:08] road she laid herself at the feet of
[51:10] Boaz and said I need a husband I need a
[51:13] kinsman Reid
[51:14] praise God I need someone to take care
[51:16] of me
[51:17] I need a family I need a future
[51:19] hallelujah in church we've got the lay
[51:22] ourselves at the feet of Christ's
[51:23] Alleluia and know that he'll give us all
[51:26] we require amen
[51:28] not everything we want but everything we
[51:30] require because all the city everybody
[51:37] knows that you're a virtuous woman
[51:40] everybody knows si Boaz was willing to
[51:44] meet her requests because everybody knew
[51:47] she was a strong godly Jewish woman Amen
[51:51] everybody knows she lived the life
[51:55] before everyone remember she would
[52:00] follow with the other maidens the Bible
[52:01] said I was reading that in Chapter two
[52:03] she would just follow the other maidens
[52:05] and he's met these maidens were you know
[52:07] either female daughters unmarried or
[52:09] they were female slaves and and they
[52:11] would follow after the other harvesters
[52:13] and there'd be a little glean over here
[52:15] a little you know barley over here they
[52:17] picked that little one up and they were
[52:19] that they didn't have a big job they
[52:20] actually had just a hard job they just
[52:23] had to go and get the scraps but thank
[52:25] God the children still get the scraps
[52:27] that fall from the master's table they
[52:28] had how do ya amen
[52:31] and she she would just follow right
[52:34] along with them she could have went out
[52:36] to other men's fields she could have
[52:38] went to other denominations right she
[52:40] could have went to other churches but
[52:42] she stayed in the field of Boaz her
[52:44] kinsman redeemer praise God and
[52:46] everybody knew what kind of life she
[52:49] lived and listened church everybody
[52:51] knows what kind of life you live all
[52:53] right how do we express it everyday we
[52:57] express it every week every every
[53:01] decision we make expresses what kind of
[53:03] life is inside us and everybody knows
[53:05] what kind of virtue we have and that
[53:09] means strength she was a strong woman
[53:13] she wasn't tempted by other men she
[53:15] wasn't you she may have been tempted but
[53:17] she overcame it you know and she stayed
[53:19] true she stayed faithful she was a
[53:21] strong believer in other words now for
[53:25] rubies now not just one ruby remember
[53:27] not just one her price is far above
[53:31] rubies
[53:34] now rubies according this is according
[53:36] to gem society org so on I am no you can
[53:40] take a test and become certified to be a
[53:42] master gem guy I forget what it's called
[53:44] gemologist I'm guessing there I have no
[53:46] idea but you can become so knowledgeable
[53:50] about gems but I'm definitely not I just
[53:52] copied I just copied of what it said off
[53:54] the website the hardness is second only
[53:57] to the diamond and extremely rare even
[54:02] more rare than diamonds in fact they
[54:05] just found a new weed say string of
[54:07] rubies in Myanmar if I'm not mistaken
[54:10] from the reading yesterday so there's
[54:13] you know certain packs where you know in
[54:16] the ground where they have all these
[54:17] precious jewels
[54:18] I think Africa has lots of diamonds from
[54:20] what I've heard in South Africa I know
[54:22] there's lots of diamonds and gold and
[54:23] but these are so rare they're hard to
[54:27] find and I like this you can do more
[54:30] with the Ruby than with other gems amen
[54:35] I like that you can treat it you can
[54:38] take it through different heats and and
[54:40] Cooling's and cuts and different things
[54:42] and it still stays genuine Ruby praise
[54:45] God that's a real Christian woman don't
[54:48] you think God can put her through all
[54:50] kinds of trials but he shall come out
[54:52] shinier and brighter with more clarity
[54:54] at the end you can do more of the
[54:56] Christian woman than with all these
[54:58] other worldly women amen
[55:00] I like that it's a beautiful thing this
[55:06] these rubies they're one of the most
[55:08] popular and expensive gems in the world
[55:11] and I like this the record prices go
[55:15] from $100,000 per carat to a 2 million
[55:20] per carat based upon the clarity and the
[55:22] cut and there's there's 4 C's I don't
[55:24] remember all of them I remember clarity
[55:25] and cut that's all I remember
[55:26] a hundred thousand per carat all the way
[55:31] up to two million per carat and a care
[55:33] is the weight of a paperclip I don't
[55:35] have one up here I wish I had should
[55:37] have brought one out I got one on my
[55:38] desk out there imagine the weight of a
[55:41] Paperclip if you could get a ruby that
[55:43] weight one carat it can be up to two
[55:48] million dollars and the Bible said a
[55:51] godly woman's price is more valuable
[55:54] than rubies so her value is far above 2
[56:02] million per carat brothers I just
[56:05] sometimes think we forget God forgive us
[56:07] right if we forget how valuable our
[56:09] wives are that's not me that's the Bible
[56:12] it's far above rubies so when you look
[56:17] over there say mile when you're driving
[56:18] home
[56:19] I've got about twenty million dollars
[56:21] sitting over there I'm so blessed
[56:24] because it's far about what's far above
[56:26] two million I don't know I'd say 20 30
[56:28] 50 hundred far above and very hard to
[56:35] find a man I'm so glad that God didn't
[56:39] put mine very far for me it would put
[56:40] put her in the same high school as me to
[56:43] make sure I wouldn't miss that shine in
[56:44] Ruby there a lot I think I just thank
[56:48] the Lord for that God knows I never want
[56:50] to I never would have went all these
[56:52] years like wondering you know go from
[56:53] camp-meeting to camp-meeting where's my
[56:55] wife where's my wife
[56:56] God knows I don't want to go through all
[56:57] that nonsense I just want to find her I
[56:59] just want to live be happy with her by
[57:01] God's grace God knows what we have need
[57:04] of I've seen brothers go to this god I
[57:07] see one brother in particular went from
[57:09] South Africa up to Canada and down to
[57:12] Texas and over here just looking for a
[57:15] wife who can find one amen but God will
[57:20] give it to us if we just ask in his name
[57:22] Amen so valuable I'll say like this is
[57:25] so valuable it's worth going around the
[57:27] world for it if you had to if that's
[57:29] part of your testimony and God's testing
[57:32] you to see if you'll stay with the word
[57:33] it's worth traveling around the world to
[57:35] find one of these million dollar women
[57:37] by God's grace multi-million dollar
[57:39] women as far as value her spiritual
[57:42] value is compared to millions of dollars
[57:45] that's right church now
[57:50] before we get to this list she has this
[57:52] list of works that she she's known for
[57:55] in verses twelve
[57:58] I'm sorry thirteen down to 27 cuz after
[58:03] twenty-seven and just talks about how
[58:04] she's praised and virtuous and fears God
[58:08] before we get to do that let's look
[58:10] again at these two defining attributes
[58:12] of the proverbs 31 woman and we need to
[58:16] spend time on this a lot of time people
[58:18] when they preach this they just jump to
[58:20] what a woman does which that's fine but
[58:24] if you do that if you just jump to her
[58:26] works and you don't start at her
[58:28] foundation then the works become vain
[58:31] because before you build a house you got
[58:34] to prepare the ground Amen I don't know
[58:37] yeah you've got to have the foundation
[58:39] in place amen and this woman has to we'd
[58:44] say pillars of foundation I say like
[58:46] that or two cornerstones of or one good
[58:49] cornerstone that has two parts whatever
[58:51] you want to say to her character amen
[58:54] and I'm going to call them boundaries
[58:57] these two attributes of a woman define
[59:00] the boundaries of her life in other
[59:04] words these two things if she has these
[59:06] two attributes to her these two
[59:08] characteristics then that determines all
[59:11] that she can do in her life and then
[59:14] that makes her happy that'll make the
[59:17] church happy if we can stay in God's
[59:19] boundaries if we can do what God's
[59:22] called us to do and not step out in our
[59:25] pride and try to do something we're not
[59:27] called to do but just do what God's
[59:29] called us to do so here's the two
[59:32] defining attributes we read it in our
[59:33] text the first one is in verse 12 she
[59:37] will do him good and not evil all the
[59:40] days of her life that's the first but of
[59:45] course is not the first the first ones
[59:47] actually verse 30 because we put the
[59:49] Lord takes our top priority right God
[59:52] first then family next right so number
[59:55] third verse 30 a woman that feareth the
[59:58] Lord shall be praised
[1:00:01] so the
[1:00:03] shorter is one this woman must fear the
[1:00:06] Lord second after that after she fears
[1:00:12] God then she does good to her husband
[1:00:15] every day of the week
[1:00:17] not just Sunday and I'm talking about to
[1:00:21] the church now we do good we treat
[1:00:23] Christ the best we can every day of the
[1:00:26] week not just Wednesday and Sunday we
[1:00:29] serve Jesus every day we're in every day
[1:00:32] of the week Christian hallelujah
[1:00:35] so her relationship with the Lord we'd
[1:00:38] say is her foundation
[1:00:40] now I preach on this but I did it on an
[1:00:43] online video when I was sick of last
[1:00:46] month but let's just review the fear of
[1:00:48] the Lord the fear of the Lord is to
[1:00:50] laugh at evil that's not right and the
[1:00:56] church said the fear of the Lord is to
[1:00:59] hate evil this is when you're allowed to
[1:01:03] express hate when you see sin you can
[1:01:06] hate sin we shouldn't hate our brother
[1:01:10] and sister we should love our brothers
[1:01:12] and sisters praise God we shouldn't even
[1:01:16] hate our enemies we must love our
[1:01:18] enemies but one time you can't express
[1:01:21] the vine hate is when you see sin and
[1:01:25] you can hate sin proverbs 8 I'm sorry
[1:01:31] pride arrogance II and the evil way and
[1:01:33] the froward mouth do I hate be not wise
[1:01:39] in that own eyes fear the Lord and
[1:01:41] depart from evil so you hate evil so the
[1:01:45] fear of God hates evil and then it
[1:01:48] leaves evil behind in the dust it
[1:01:51] doesn't hang around evil and kind of
[1:01:54] play with it a little bit and experiment
[1:01:56] and just trial just try this I'll just
[1:01:58] pet this this be my little pet thing and
[1:02:01] no it hates it and then it leaves it
[1:02:04] praise God by mercy and truth and Nic wa
[1:02:09] t is purged and by the fear of the Lord
[1:02:12] men depart from evil the reason men
[1:02:15] commit
[1:02:17] sins and we say adulteries or or
[1:02:20] fornications the reason men do that is
[1:02:23] because they don't fear God enough amen
[1:02:28] the reason women commit adultery and
[1:02:32] fornication said and get drunk and do
[1:02:34] drugs the reason they do that is they
[1:02:37] don't fear God enough they love the
[1:02:41] pleasures of the world more than they
[1:02:43] fear the Living God
[1:02:45] hallelujah so the fear of the Lord is to
[1:02:49] hate it and then walk away from it
[1:02:53] praise God you know we know the Bible
[1:02:57] says you know casting down imaginations
[1:02:58] but if we cast it down and hang around
[1:03:01] it doesn't do us any good
[1:03:02] if the box of snakes comes to our house
[1:03:05] that we just toss it down but we hang
[1:03:07] out outside the front door that doesn't
[1:03:09] do us any good the snakes are gonna
[1:03:10] crawl all over our feet all right Church
[1:03:13] but you've got to hate it
[1:03:15] cast it down reject it slam the door and
[1:03:17] get away from it amen that's real fear
[1:03:21] of the Lord so this is the foundation of
[1:03:24] a godly wife a proverbs 31 woman and
[1:03:28] I'll say on this a proverbs 31 church so
[1:03:31] her first priority is to submit to every
[1:03:34] word of God
[1:03:34] a woman's thinking attitude behavior
[1:03:41] must all submit to God it doesn't even
[1:03:45] matter you know we shouldn't skip ahead
[1:03:47] to the work so what does she do I want
[1:03:48] to do that you must make sure your heart
[1:03:51] is right because remember the Prophet
[1:03:53] said if the nominations can build
[1:03:55] churches and hospitals and missionary
[1:03:57] programs if they can do all that without
[1:03:59] the Spirit of God
[1:04:00] it's an antichrist spirit so what good
[1:04:03] are the works if the spirits not right
[1:04:04] first we got to get the spirit right
[1:04:06] verse and fear the Lord amen then go
[1:04:10] build a hospital or a missionary or or
[1:04:12] something like that a church then go do
[1:04:15] that but first get your foundation right
[1:04:21] so in other words this is what lamu
[1:04:23] Elle's mother or possibly Bathsheba this
[1:04:26] is what she's saying son maybe Solomon
[1:04:30] uf they're different people make sure
[1:04:32] you choose a woman who fears the Lord
[1:04:34] above all things let me just tell our
[1:04:38] young sisters because my daughter is now
[1:04:40] a teenager let me just tell them the
[1:04:43] best thing that young sisters can do is
[1:04:46] to fear God and live such a godly pure
[1:04:51] innocent life learn to fear God be an
[1:04:55] example to all the other young sisters
[1:04:58] in the church don't worry don't try to
[1:05:02] get somebody's attention just sit there
[1:05:04] and you're another word stay in your
[1:05:06] spiritual position
[1:05:08] don't try to attract anybody's attention
[1:05:10] just try to get God's attention Amen
[1:05:12] with your faith and fear of the Lord
[1:05:15] don't change your clothing to be a
[1:05:17] modest don't change anything about your
[1:05:19] character don't be flirty with the boys
[1:05:22] but fear God humble yourself fear God
[1:05:26] and God will send you the husband at the
[1:05:28] right time that's right that's what you
[1:05:33] young men like Malachi and Elijah need
[1:05:35] to be looking for as they come in their
[1:05:37] teenage years I know he's only 11 but
[1:05:38] I've got to preach it anyhow you know
[1:05:40] he's he's got to hear when they go to
[1:05:44] places or cultures they should have
[1:05:46] looked for a girl who doesn't love the
[1:05:48] Lord they should look for a girl who
[1:05:50] trembles in the presence of the Holy
[1:05:52] Ghost
[1:05:54] hallelujah someone that fears God they
[1:05:59] care what God thinks about them amen
[1:06:02] they hate evil and they depart from evil
[1:06:06] that's what our young men need to be
[1:06:08] looking for that's the most important
[1:06:10] thing they can look for because we're
[1:06:13] gonna see with some of these the jobs
[1:06:15] and the works that this proverbs 31
[1:06:17] woman does she couldn't do these while
[1:06:19] she had little kids some of these she
[1:06:21] had to do when they were all grown and
[1:06:23] she had more time on her hands like
[1:06:26] clearing a field the Bible said she
[1:06:28] clears out a field of the rocks a woman
[1:06:33] clears out the field plants it and then
[1:06:36] sells those and gets money off it and is
[1:06:39] fruitful in her endeavors
[1:06:40] how can she those she's if she's got
[1:06:42] twins on her back you know this
[1:06:43] this would be a very hard thing to do so
[1:06:47] we have to understand like so Solomon or
[1:06:49] well you know this young King Lemuel if
[1:06:53] he's looking for a wife you know he
[1:06:55] wouldn't look maybe for an older woman
[1:06:57] he would be looking for a younger woman
[1:06:58] and this younger woman might not be out
[1:07:00] in the fields yet but one thing she's
[1:07:02] got to have the fear of the Lord she's
[1:07:05] got to love God and fear God and hate
[1:07:08] evil amen he will he might not see that
[1:07:11] works yet but he can know this those
[1:07:13] works will happen if she loves God with
[1:07:16] all her heart amen
[1:07:17] she's going to be a proverbs 31 woman
[1:07:21] I'll be very honest and my wife and I
[1:07:24] have you know we talked about this
[1:07:25] numerous times I believe if not if not I
[1:07:27] apologize to her afterwards but I told
[1:07:30] her I said you know I love my wife but I
[1:07:32] never knew she was gonna be this good of
[1:07:33] a mother I knew she loved the Lord but I
[1:07:37] didn't know she was gonna be this
[1:07:39] valuable you understand what I'm saying
[1:07:42] because you know we I just didn't know
[1:07:45] all that was in her but one thing I knew
[1:07:48] is that she would separate herself she
[1:07:50] leave her denomination and she come to
[1:07:52] the message even after here in marriage
[1:07:54] and divorce was her first sermon she
[1:07:55] ever heard
[1:07:57] even after hear on that she was still
[1:07:59] love and serve the Lord and I didn't
[1:08:02] know at that time what just all the
[1:08:03] works and all the love for the family
[1:08:05] and all the fruit that would come out of
[1:08:07] her mothering I didn't know but I knew
[1:08:09] one thing she loved the Lord and that's
[1:08:12] what you have to know brothers when you
[1:08:14] choose you've just got to know one thing
[1:08:15] does she fear the Lord or does she do
[1:08:19] what she wants to do we need women that
[1:08:21] fear the Lord amen that is the most
[1:08:25] important thing fear God keep his
[1:08:30] commands Gloria oh look I doubled the
[1:08:36] slide so forgive me I just put quotes on
[1:08:37] that one
[1:08:38] sorry I don't know why did that well
[1:08:40] Graham said the kind of woman that a man
[1:08:42] would choose will reflect his ambition
[1:08:45] in his character remember she's the
[1:08:47] reflection of him right if a man chooses
[1:08:50] the wrong woman it reflects his
[1:08:52] character and what he ties himself to
[1:08:55] truly shows
[1:08:57] what's in him why did this man tie
[1:08:59] himself to was it a woman who feared the
[1:09:03] Lord or was it a woman who has a make
[1:09:05] believer or unbeliever what is a man tie
[1:09:08] himself to it shows what's inside of him
[1:09:11] now if he wasn't a Christian yet made a
[1:09:13] decision or something like that
[1:09:14] that's different right and then God
[1:09:16] allowed that for our testimony sake and
[1:09:18] you know we know that person would have
[1:09:20] done different had they been a believer
[1:09:21] and so forth like that but we've got to
[1:09:24] trust in the sovereign knowledge of God
[1:09:26] that God knew what we do God knew and we
[1:09:29] get saved and all things work together
[1:09:31] for them that love the Lord we've got to
[1:09:34] trust the sovereign wisdom of God so a
[1:09:38] woman reflects what's in the man when he
[1:09:40] chooses her for life it shows what's
[1:09:43] down in him no matter what he says
[1:09:46] outside
[1:09:47] watch what he married and that Grich huh
[1:09:53] watch what he marries that will show
[1:09:56] what's on the inside of him it shows
[1:09:58] what he has in his mind what his future
[1:10:03] home is going to be because he's took
[1:10:05] her to raise his children by and
[1:10:09] whatever she is that's the way she'll
[1:10:11] raise those children so reflects what's
[1:10:13] in the man a man that takes a woman like
[1:10:16] that just shows what he's thinking of
[1:10:17] the future Amen hallelujah
[1:10:22] what a beautiful thought for us and
[1:10:26] think about that Christ knows what's
[1:10:30] inside of our character right cry if
[1:10:33] Christ chose us in him well we must have
[1:10:35] the right kind of character a man by His
[1:10:38] grace now by His grace
[1:10:40] so I proverbs 31 woman simply cannot
[1:10:45] stand evil she's constantly purging it
[1:10:50] from her life and her home so should our
[1:10:55] church constantly purge sin from our
[1:10:58] church that right and then later
[1:11:02] she does this if she fears God departs
[1:11:05] from evil hates evil then cries and her
[1:11:09] family will praise her for this later
[1:11:11] not worship praise and complement her
[1:11:16] because brother Bram teaches that in the
[1:11:18] church age book brother Aaron said
[1:11:19] Christ praises his own he's not
[1:11:24] worshiping us
[1:11:25] he's just complimenting us for being
[1:11:28] well well done good and faithful servant
[1:11:30] amen
[1:11:31] he's complimenting us cuz this is what
[1:11:34] he says he said I know your works I know
[1:11:37] your labor mother's he knows your works
[1:11:39] your labor your patience how you cannot
[1:11:42] bear them which are evil so see there's
[1:11:44] the fear of the Lord right there these
[1:11:46] ephesian church age believers they
[1:11:49] couldn't handle evil people no matter
[1:11:51] how religious they are they hated sin
[1:11:54] and now has tried them which say they
[1:11:58] are possible you say you're a messege
[1:12:00] believer let me try and see if you
[1:12:01] really do believe the message and are
[1:12:04] not and has found them liars and has
[1:12:09] born and has patience thank God for a
[1:12:12] patient wife patient mother patient
[1:12:15] father and for my namesake has labored
[1:12:18] and is not fainted
[1:12:20] how many glad when you feel like giving
[1:12:22] up Christ is there to lift you up amen
[1:12:24] you're in your flesh of your mind you're
[1:12:27] so weary you're so tired but Jesus won't
[1:12:30] let you quit amen because he that
[1:12:32] started a good work will finish it will
[1:12:34] completed in you and I a man because
[1:12:37] he's faithful hallelujah it's his power
[1:12:40] behind this dream he met he's the one
[1:12:42] that's pushing us on hallelujah
[1:12:44] that's right church so this is a
[1:12:47] compliment this is Jesus praising the
[1:12:51] Ephesian bride so if this will
[1:12:56] can rid her life and her family of all
[1:13:00] the sin in the family Christ will praise
[1:13:02] her
[1:13:03] so sisters it's your job to go home well
[1:13:06] I say follow the leadership of your
[1:13:07] husband of course but with his
[1:13:08] leadership purge out the entire home
[1:13:10] keep all the leaven out Amen but man
[1:13:14] said how beautifully the Savior praises
[1:13:17] and commends his children he that takes
[1:13:24] full account of their fine spiritual
[1:13:26] attitudes and behavior you know Jesus
[1:13:30] watching your attitude this morning
[1:13:31] all wise you got to preach this or I'm
[1:13:33] thankful he's preaching this he's
[1:13:36] watching our attitudes this morning and
[1:13:38] he's either gonna praise you or rebuke
[1:13:41] you that's what he because if he don't
[1:13:43] rebuke you you're not one of his own
[1:13:45] right as many as I love I rebuke and
[1:13:49] chasten amen he takes full account he
[1:13:54] knows that there's weakness amongst them
[1:13:56] but yet he does not cry out against it
[1:13:58] he said isn't that just like the Lord he
[1:14:00] knows how to encourage us in the right
[1:14:02] matters and discourage us in the wrong
[1:14:06] matters I can truly say that I had two
[1:14:09] brother another brother from Africa
[1:14:10] texted me yesterday and he was saying
[1:14:13] out he's a young brother and I've text
[1:14:16] him over the last few months but he was
[1:14:20] telling me he said brother Jesse he said
[1:14:21] I've sat on the message all these things
[1:14:22] he said but I'm not born again and how
[1:14:24] do I do this I'm I forget how old he was
[1:14:26] either teenage or early college and he
[1:14:28] said every time I get around my friends
[1:14:31] at school he says I just join in to
[1:14:35] their evil conversations he said what
[1:14:37] should I do
[1:14:38] am I born again and I said no sir you're
[1:14:40] probably not born again because when
[1:14:43] you're born again you hate evil praise
[1:14:47] God
[1:14:48] you hate evil and so after the text he
[1:14:51] agreed he said yes I need to be born
[1:14:52] again I've got too many things I got
[1:14:54] like repent he said what should I do
[1:14:56] I said you need to get alone with God
[1:14:58] and pray and weep until you hate the
[1:15:02] dirty jokes of your friends more than
[1:15:04] anything in the world amen
[1:15:06] then you need to ask God to fill you
[1:15:08] with the Holy Ghost amen
[1:15:12] because he when you're born again then
[1:15:15] you determine the atmosphere and if you
[1:15:18] can't change the atmosphere then you
[1:15:19] leave the atmosphere is that right and
[1:15:23] he thanked me said I got to go study
[1:15:25] Center I wish I had more time to talk to
[1:15:26] you have all these questions
[1:15:27] I said well whenever you're ready I'll
[1:15:28] help you and he sent me a picture of him
[1:15:30] and his buddy I guess they did a selfie
[1:15:32] or something like that I don't he said
[1:15:33] he said we love your videos all these
[1:15:35] things like that but I was telling look
[1:15:37] I was trying to show him that Jesus
[1:15:39] wants to discourage his evil
[1:15:41] conversations but encourage him that
[1:15:44] he's at least come this far
[1:15:45] he's been baptized we encouraged him
[1:15:48] that you've been baptized praise God but
[1:15:50] now you've got to walk through the hot
[1:15:52] wilderness you've got to be sanctified
[1:15:54] amen you got to be cleaned out of your
[1:15:57] daily habits and desires until God fills
[1:15:59] you with His Holy Spirit he can trust
[1:16:02] you with his word amen that's right how
[1:16:08] many seen how God knows how to encourage
[1:16:10] you when you're struggling this week
[1:16:13] I'll be real honest I was really
[1:16:14] struggling I was really discouraged this
[1:16:16] week different things in my life you
[1:16:17] know I was really discouraged really
[1:16:19] discouraged and and I got a text was
[1:16:23] that yesterday yeah yesterday morning I
[1:16:25] was here at the church said I got a text
[1:16:26] from one of my friends in Copley and it
[1:16:30] was a mother and she you know sent a
[1:16:32] text to my wife and I at the same time
[1:16:33] which was very respectful because
[1:16:35] they're not in the message but she loves
[1:16:36] the Lord you know it seems as far as she
[1:16:38] knows and she said Jesse and Christin
[1:16:41] last night the Lord woke me up several
[1:16:44] times all's I could dream about was your
[1:16:46] family and she said I don't know what's
[1:16:49] going on I can't even remember all this
[1:16:51] going on but each time God woke me up I
[1:16:53] prayed for you and your family and I
[1:16:57] rarely get texts like that and so she
[1:16:59] sent me a scripture John 10:10 that said
[1:17:03] the enemy comes to steal kill and
[1:17:04] destroy but I have come that you might
[1:17:07] have life and you might have it more
[1:17:10] abundantly
[1:17:10] he said I'm praying for you to have the
[1:17:13] abundant life and the little did she
[1:17:14] know I was been so discouraged the last
[1:17:16] few days just discouraging what's why
[1:17:19] this and why that and why this and the
[1:17:22] and then God and I thought how
[1:17:24] how how sweet is God that God can anoint
[1:17:28] somebody who doesn't even know what I'm
[1:17:30] going through wake her up a mother of
[1:17:32] numerous children wake her up in the
[1:17:35] middle of the night over and over again
[1:17:36] just to pray for my wife and I how much
[1:17:40] Oh how He loves you and me amen
[1:17:42] makes me wanna sing a hymn hallelujah Oh
[1:17:44] how He loves you and me and then this
[1:17:47] morning right before church I got a text
[1:17:48] from Tennessee and a brother said how
[1:17:50] are you doing you're really heavy on my
[1:17:52] heart today is everything okay Oh how He
[1:17:56] loves you and me praise God does Jesus
[1:18:01] know how to encourage this church
[1:18:03] absolutely does he know how to
[1:18:06] discourage us in the wrong matters
[1:18:07] absolutely program said we could all
[1:18:11] learn a good lesson right here running
[1:18:13] the church and our families and better
[1:18:17] still we could all learn a good lesson
[1:18:18] in that God deals with us each one of us
[1:18:20] in exactly the same way amen you so you
[1:18:24] can't say well well brother Jesse God
[1:18:26] loves you more than he loves me or yo
[1:18:28] God God treats you a little bit better
[1:18:30] than me you can't say that because Jesus
[1:18:33] treats all his children the same
[1:18:34] hallelujah he's not a respecter of
[1:18:37] persons he said don't ever be
[1:18:40] discouraged saint of God that's real
[1:18:42] good for me this morning he said for God
[1:18:45] is now ungracious to forget your labor
[1:18:48] of love hallelujah whatever we do even
[1:18:52] giving a cup of cold water someone has a
[1:18:54] reward and a blessing from the Lord
[1:18:56] let's say hallelujah ready hallelujah
[1:18:59] amen
[1:19:04] so if she
[1:19:05] we can keep all the sin out of her life
[1:19:07] and her home even when her children
[1:19:11] become teenagers we can't make an excuse
[1:19:15] when they become teenagers right we got
[1:19:17] to keep the house clean I know my mom
[1:19:21] fought it as hard as she could but she
[1:19:22] was all by herself she let in more than
[1:19:24] she should have but she didn't know the
[1:19:26] message but she tried to keep out the
[1:19:28] bad movies and the worldly music when I
[1:19:30] was growing up cuz I didn't know better
[1:19:31] she would she would destroy tapes and
[1:19:33] you know cassette tapes remember
[1:19:34] cassette tapes anybody remember that
[1:19:36] she'd break CD she throwing the trash
[1:19:38] she break our video games of that
[1:19:40] violence on him she tried as hard as one
[1:19:42] woman could with five boys and one girl
[1:19:44] she tried as hard as she could so the
[1:19:49] woman has to fear the Lord and now after
[1:19:52] fearing God hating evil she must do good
[1:19:56] to her husband every single day now look
[1:20:00] she purposely does good every day that's
[1:20:05] her first thing I've got to do good to
[1:20:07] my husband I fear God I love God I keep
[1:20:10] it all the sin on the house the next
[1:20:11] thing what good thing can I do for my
[1:20:14] hubby amen now brothers the Bible said
[1:20:19] you need to love your wives too so I'm
[1:20:20] not leaving the brothers out but this is
[1:20:22] proverbs 31 this is what I'm preaching
[1:20:24] right now men you if you don't love your
[1:20:26] wife shame on you right but she's got to
[1:20:30] have a purpose today what can I do good
[1:20:33] for my husband I've gotta do something
[1:20:36] today to be good to him now
[1:20:41] timebut Church I already read through
[1:20:43] the whole book of Proverbs I took
[1:20:44] detailed notes I didn't have time
[1:20:45] yesterday to go through it but there are
[1:20:46] all the scriptures about odious wife or
[1:20:49] contentious wife and what the Bible say
[1:20:52] the Bible says it's bad work better to
[1:20:54] dwell in the wilderness than in a house
[1:20:56] with a contentious wife praise the Lord
[1:21:01] she's either the greatest Blessington or
[1:21:04] brother Ram said she's water in his
[1:21:06] blood and husband's you can be the same
[1:21:09] to your wife right we all know husbands
[1:21:12] that have been abusive either verbally
[1:21:13] or physically and it's the most awful
[1:21:15] thing that could be done in a marriage
[1:21:17] right using the children not loving the
[1:21:20] wife shame on a man like that he's
[1:21:22] probably guilty of it he's probably
[1:21:24] deserving of jail time if not worse
[1:21:26] right if he's violent towards his wife
[1:21:29] and children he deserves jail time but
[1:21:33] the Bible now as this point here she's
[1:21:35] got to do good not to start arguments
[1:21:38] not to get back at her husband but she's
[1:21:41] got to think what good can I do to my
[1:21:43] husband today you need to wake up you
[1:21:45] and I and say what can we do for the
[1:21:47] kingdom of God today amen what can I do
[1:21:50] to lift up the name of Jesus Christ
[1:21:53] today let me do something good for Jesus
[1:21:56] today I don't want to take a day off I
[1:21:57] don't care if it's Saturday I want to
[1:21:59] glorify Jesus hallelujah so she doesn't
[1:22:04] say or do anything evil towards her
[1:22:06] husband because she so has so much fear
[1:22:11] of the Lord that she would never let any
[1:22:13] evil into her home I hope I hope this
[1:22:16] reminds you of your life right now I
[1:22:19] hope you say oh praise the Lord that's
[1:22:21] how I'm living and if not Oh Lord
[1:22:23] forgive me help me to live the right way
[1:22:25] cleanse me this morning so I can have a
[1:22:27] house like a proverbs 31 woman so see
[1:22:32] this woman she recognizes that she is
[1:22:36] his helpmate not the other way around
[1:22:39] right I she says I'm here to carry out
[1:22:45] his vision I'm here to help him
[1:22:48] he's not here to help me get what I want
[1:22:51] I'm here as a helpmate to help him get
[1:22:54] what God's leading him to so her
[1:22:58] motivation is now this is powerful now
[1:23:01] just stay with me here I know I know I
[1:23:04] preached 40 minutes already can you
[1:23:06] believe that her motivation then for the
[1:23:08] many activities she will accomplish in
[1:23:11] her lifetime in this chapter is to be
[1:23:14] good to her husband now we're going to
[1:23:17] talk about spices we're talking about
[1:23:19] clothes in a moment here maybe later
[1:23:21] next week all these things that she can
[1:23:23] do fields prophets are trading with
[1:23:27] merchants across the oceans this woman
[1:23:30] does it all oh she knows all of this
[1:23:34] with one goal to fear God and then to do
[1:23:36] something good for my husband no doubt
[1:23:39] her family but notice in this chapter
[1:23:41] the chapter never exalts children above
[1:23:45] the husband this chapter keeps the order
[1:23:49] of God where God is first then husband
[1:23:53] and the church said so we got to take
[1:23:58] the
[1:23:59] understanding as we look at this chapter
[1:24:01] all that she accomplished she doesn't
[1:24:04] she does this in the name of her husband
[1:24:06] just like we do everything in the name
[1:24:08] of Jesus Christ amen
[1:24:10] we'll cross the sea right we will do
[1:24:14] whatever we cross the country
[1:24:15] we'll go whatever we can and everything
[1:24:17] we do if we give to the poor or if we go
[1:24:20] to the hospital pray for somebody we do
[1:24:22] it all in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:24:28] remember wives submit yourselves unto
[1:24:31] your own husband's as unto the Lord for
[1:24:33] the husband is the head of the wife even
[1:24:34] as Christ as the head of the church he
[1:24:37] is the savior of the body therefore as
[1:24:39] the church is subject unto Christ so
[1:24:41] that wives be to their own husband's in
[1:24:43] everything now look at this I'm not
[1:24:47] going to raise your hand sisters but how
[1:24:48] many sisters feel like you're submitting
[1:24:50] to your husband I hope all of them but
[1:24:54] here's what it means in the Greek to
[1:24:55] arrange under if I submit I yield to
[1:24:59] your admonition or advice so sisters if
[1:25:04] your husband gives you his advice you
[1:25:07] should yield to that how many believe
[1:25:09] that's godly unless he tells you
[1:25:14] something outside the word you don't
[1:25:16] have to obey that put everything else
[1:25:19] even it's just his preference or his
[1:25:22] advice whatever he wants the woman needs
[1:25:25] to submit and listen to the advice
[1:25:28] because how should the church respond to
[1:25:32] every word of Christ should we just
[1:25:33] brush it off and do what we want or
[1:25:35] should we take the advice of Jesus and
[1:25:37] every preference that he has Amen I
[1:25:39] think you know the answer to that I
[1:25:42] thought that was so striking sisters are
[1:25:45] we just are we even taking the advice of
[1:25:47] our husbands we ought to because that's
[1:25:50] what the word submit means the Greek
[1:25:54] military term means to arrange troops
[1:25:57] and divisions in military fashion under
[1:26:00] the command of a leader in non-military
[1:26:03] use it was a voluntary attitude of
[1:26:05] giving in so our sisters are most like
[1:26:09] Christ when they just give in and say
[1:26:11] okay I'll do
[1:26:12] away now you need to do this and listen
[1:26:16] you need to do that that that that do
[1:26:17] what I want do what I want no a real
[1:26:20] godly submissive woman she does she's
[1:26:24] able to give him she's able to take
[1:26:25] advice she's able to do what the husband
[1:26:27] asked her to do but see he's got to have
[1:26:31] a loving spirit behind it and even if he
[1:26:34] does it as long as it's not nothing off
[1:26:36] the word she should still submit I know
[1:26:40] that's tough an hour later to see in
[1:26:41] society or maybe the way you were raised
[1:26:43] but how many believe the Word of God is
[1:26:45] more important than society and culture
[1:26:47] how many believe that so our sisters and
[1:26:50] remember we get brothers we got apply
[1:26:51] this to our life with Christ
[1:26:53] are we taking Christ's advice or we just
[1:26:56] do in our own advice are we are we quick
[1:27:00] to give in to what whatever Christ wants
[1:27:02] brothers are we quick to do that we
[1:27:04] ought to sisters are we quick to give in
[1:27:07] and I'll just okay that's fine I'll do
[1:27:09] it your way that's fine
[1:27:10] I had these plans and ideas but but you
[1:27:12] know I'm under you so I'm just going to
[1:27:14] trust the gods leaving you the right way
[1:27:18] that's where the rubber meets the road
[1:27:20] can I say like that that's where the
[1:27:22] rubber meets the road
[1:27:23] what's our attitude like remember Christ
[1:27:25] is either gonna praise you or rebuke you
[1:27:27] for your attitude amen hallelujah the
[1:27:33] proverbs 31 woman she modeled submission
[1:27:37] her mission is based upon his mission
[1:27:41] and she puts her mission under his
[1:27:44] mission which is submission right is
[1:27:48] that right sub mission the woman still
[1:27:51] has a mission but it fits into his
[1:27:53] mission hallelujah because it's under
[1:27:56] his mission so all these things the
[1:27:59] woman does later in this chapter
[1:28:01] training children you know maids and
[1:28:04] servants and all these things fields
[1:28:07] buying things purchase these things all
[1:28:09] she does she does them under the
[1:28:12] husband's mission so it hadn't been the
[1:28:14] husband's mission first and then to do
[1:28:17] him good she thinks oh I can do this I
[1:28:20] can do that and that will bless my
[1:28:22] husband praise
[1:28:26] god I really believe this will help our
[1:28:33] families don't you don't you believe
[1:28:36] that if we can express this kind of
[1:28:41] character
[1:28:43] remember Church this is rare now I hope
[1:28:47] I hope we have a church full of rare
[1:28:49] rubies this morning or you're so rare
[1:28:53] you can do you've done all these things
[1:28:54] in your life
[1:28:55] as far as sisters I'm talking about that
[1:28:58] would be beautiful but remember we don't
[1:29:00] have to do all this just like we could
[1:29:02] never do all the things Christ did but
[1:29:05] we've got a press and strive press
[1:29:07] toward the mark of the high calling in
[1:29:09] Christ Jesus we've got to do all that
[1:29:11] God's called us to do we've got to
[1:29:13] accomplish all that Christ wants to
[1:29:14] accomplish in our lives like brother BAM
[1:29:17] said I may not be a Billy Graham but
[1:29:18] Billy Graham can't be a William Branham
[1:29:20] right we've all got a purpose we've all
[1:29:23] got a place we've all got to come under
[1:29:26] the mission of Christ so the property
[1:29:32] one woman has two motivations I'm down
[1:29:34] to 10 minutes
[1:29:35] Wow all right got to protect myself so I
[1:29:38] don't bare wear myself out the proverbs
[1:29:40] 31 woman has two motivations she fears
[1:29:42] the Lord and she does good to her
[1:29:45] husband every day not to mistreat him
[1:29:49] not to make his life miserable not to
[1:29:51] make him upset but just to give in
[1:29:53] voluntarily just given his advice his
[1:29:56] preference she just gives in that
[1:29:58] voluntarily God's called me to serve you
[1:30:01] I'm your helpmate
[1:30:02] I know how to follow the will of Lord I
[1:30:05] fear God too much to go against my
[1:30:07] husband
[1:30:08] I say like that we fear God too much to
[1:30:11] go against Christ that's right
[1:30:13] that's right Oh glory see many women
[1:30:18] today have different motivations that's
[1:30:21] why their lives aren't a proverbs 31
[1:30:23] woman they could care more about money
[1:30:25] that's why they got to go get a job
[1:30:27] before it maybe it's time right or maybe
[1:30:32] a 10
[1:30:33] they've got to go dress a certain way or
[1:30:35] do something to get attention there
[1:30:39] they're not happy enough or they're not
[1:30:40] content with what God's called them to
[1:30:43] do or maybe they're after acceptance
[1:30:46] well I just want the world or these
[1:30:48] friends of mine to accept me so I'll go
[1:30:49] do this instead of what my husband wants
[1:30:51] me to do or maybe they're just motivated
[1:30:55] by fear well if I don't get outside the
[1:30:57] house I'm never gonna be anything
[1:30:59] valuable when the home is the very
[1:31:03] backbone of society it's the backbone of
[1:31:06] the church I mean know that your home my
[1:31:09] all our homes our church is only as
[1:31:11] strong as the home is that right so see
[1:31:17] the proverbs 31 woman is not motivated
[1:31:19] by any of these temptations her
[1:31:22] motivation is only the fear of the Lord
[1:31:25] and to do good to her husband all the
[1:31:27] days of her life now I have a quote for
[1:31:31] next time where bodiham said it's okay
[1:31:32] for women at times to work outside the
[1:31:34] home it's okay well Aram says that his
[1:31:38] main concern if you listen to the quotes
[1:31:40] actually from questions and answer 64
[1:31:41] his main concern is that a godly woman
[1:31:44] will get around a bunch of filthy men if
[1:31:47] you listen that quote and they will kind
[1:31:49] of defile her good morals so he says if
[1:31:53] a woman wants to help him her husband
[1:31:55] get out of debt and can take care of
[1:31:57] that still take care of the children do
[1:31:58] all those things he said that's fine he
[1:32:01] said but he's concerned about the
[1:32:02] atmosphere that she's under because she
[1:32:05] has a sacred responsibility to her the
[1:32:08] word right and to her husband and her
[1:32:10] family she has a sacred responsibility
[1:32:12] just like the man has a sacred
[1:32:14] responsibility just like men must stay
[1:32:16] undefiled before God they must lead and
[1:32:19] walk in holiness glory
[1:32:25] that's right church
[1:32:26] love the Word of God don't you now I
[1:32:29] want to stop here and pause a note I'd
[1:32:31] mentioned this earlier the children must
[1:32:34] not be exalted above the husband's
[1:32:36] vision or mission or leading whatever
[1:32:38] you want to call I just call it the
[1:32:40] leadership of the Holy Ghost whatever
[1:32:41] he's lead led to do the children cannot
[1:32:44] be exalted above the husband's
[1:32:46] leadership so she does good of course
[1:32:50] both to the children the husband but
[1:32:52] he's still the head she doesn't make the
[1:32:55] children the head of the family and I
[1:32:58] think we've all seen that in different
[1:32:59] families right we're what the children
[1:33:01] want is more important than what God
[1:33:03] wants it so the easiest example is
[1:33:05] usually Wednesday night services or
[1:33:07] Sunday morning services people got to
[1:33:09] skip Wednesday to go to sports games or
[1:33:13] academic challenge or extra practice on
[1:33:16] their studies
[1:33:16] they'll put things above the Word of God
[1:33:18] is that right and the church said or
[1:33:20] they'll skip Sunday morning because we
[1:33:22] got a wrestling tournament or we've got
[1:33:24] out what you name it we've got a
[1:33:25] volleyball tournament and at that point
[1:33:29] the needs the natural needs or desires
[1:33:32] of the children have been exalted above
[1:33:34] the will of God
[1:33:36] now it's the father's fault if that
[1:33:39] happens because he's the head of the
[1:33:40] family but see even in the home the
[1:33:45] mother must love the husband and do him
[1:33:49] good all the days of his life and she
[1:33:53] must not put the children even above the
[1:33:55] husband now we know a godly woman will
[1:33:57] meet all the children's needs and the
[1:33:59] husband's needs but what I mean is that
[1:34:01] the children cannot become an idol she
[1:34:04] can't love the children more than she
[1:34:06] loves her husband and me be mistreating
[1:34:07] her husband she's got to love everybody
[1:34:09] prays to the heart see if the children
[1:34:14] and the children will feel this believe
[1:34:16] me they'll feel this because I've taught
[1:34:19] many children over the last 14 years and
[1:34:20] I've had parents tell me that their
[1:34:22] children run their houses and the church
[1:34:25] said they run that parents have told me
[1:34:29] they run the house we do whatever they
[1:34:32] have to do whatever they want to do that
[1:34:36] should not be so in the Church of the
[1:34:38] Living God
[1:34:40] we know them needs the needs must be met
[1:34:42] we know that but this proverbs 31 woman
[1:34:45] she does her husband good all the days
[1:34:47] of his life and the children never get
[1:34:50] exalted above the mission or leadership
[1:34:53] of the husband so I put this up there if
[1:34:57] the children feel they're the center of
[1:34:58] the family and they will how do you know
[1:35:01] because they'll demand their way and
[1:35:02] their way goes above the word that's how
[1:35:05] you know any breaking or compromising on
[1:35:09] the word not hating evil but
[1:35:11] compromising to evil now you know the
[1:35:14] children have been exalted that mother's
[1:35:15] life the children have been exalted
[1:35:17] above the husband that's the scripture
[1:35:22] so this is an example of idolatry and
[1:35:26] the children they will start thinking
[1:35:28] well my mom exists for me and that will
[1:35:32] alternate lead whoa
[1:35:33] God he's there for me and God becomes an
[1:35:37] errand boy God becomes a Santa Claus
[1:35:40] instead of a faithful corrective loving
[1:35:43] father are you with me Church if these
[1:35:47] children become more if their needs go
[1:35:51] above the husband they become more
[1:35:53] important than the word this is what
[1:35:56] happens idolatry occurs and like I said
[1:35:58] I've seen it in numerous homes but we
[1:36:03] should think we exist for God's purpose
[1:36:06] God doesn't exist to help me out I exist
[1:36:10] to glorify Him how many adults can say
[1:36:13] amen to that my life the purpose of my
[1:36:17] life is to glorify Jesus Christ and I'm
[1:36:20] bringing my wife and children along to
[1:36:22] follow me and help me lift up the name
[1:36:25] of Christ Jesus amen
[1:36:26] glory that's my leadership of the Lord
[1:36:29] and any hate anything that's evil I hate
[1:36:32] and I depart from that I do not leave my
[1:36:34] family and to compromise on God's Word
[1:36:41] the wife or children will feel it if the
[1:36:45] wife doesn't
[1:36:45] the right order and do her husband good
[1:36:48] and and not exalt the children she
[1:36:50] doesn't keep that order they'll know it
[1:36:51] they'll act like it they'll act like
[1:36:53] it's all about them
[1:36:54] we must act like it's all about Christ
[1:36:58] now this is the example you say where's
[1:37:00] that in the Bible I preached this over
[1:37:01] and over again
[1:37:02] Eli's bad example God sent a prophet to
[1:37:05] Samuel to tell sit little old Samuel
[1:37:08] that I'm getting rid of Eli because he
[1:37:10] honored his sons above the word praise
[1:37:16] God so in this case it was Eli the
[1:37:19] father all the responsibilities will
[1:37:20] ultimately go on the father he honored
[1:37:25] his sons more than God because he
[1:37:27] because he let his sons continue to be
[1:37:29] ministers in the house of God
[1:37:31] despite their adultery's despite their
[1:37:34] breaking of God's commands on offerings
[1:37:36] that member they would take the fat they
[1:37:38] would call up the fat and take it for
[1:37:40] themselves the pieces with the biggest
[1:37:41] fat they cut that off but all the fat
[1:37:44] was supposed to go to God and fat was
[1:37:48] that part that tastes the best I guess
[1:37:59] you
[1:38:27] the bottom and taught him a lesson to go
[1:38:29] give a a tan was it called a suntan yeah
[1:38:33] that's right
[1:38:34] a suntan should to give her a suntan and
[1:38:37] get them to obey or fear the Lord or get
[1:38:40] out of that position this is what
[1:38:44] happens the woman has to in the home she
[1:38:48] has to keep just to keep the mind of her
[1:38:51] husband I've got to love him I've got to
[1:38:55] do good for my husband every day if she
[1:38:58] keeps that headship
[1:38:59] she keeps the headship of husband above
[1:39:01] me wife then no doubt show that'll
[1:39:04] trickle down to the children and the
[1:39:05] children will start to understand the
[1:39:06] fear of the Lord
[1:39:07] mom why do you do this mom why did we
[1:39:09] got this why don't we go back to church
[1:39:11] or why we keep praying why do we keep
[1:39:12] doing all these things it's because we
[1:39:14] fear God and God's ways are best God is
[1:39:18] directing our path God is directing your
[1:39:20] father amen
[1:39:21] right the Holy Spirit is guiding your
[1:39:25] father that's what our mothers need to
[1:39:27] say and then the father's need to say
[1:39:29] the Holy Spirit's guiding me because
[1:39:33] I've asked and God has answered I've had
[1:39:35] a relationship and experience with
[1:39:36] Christ Jesus amen
[1:39:39] I got two minutes now remember this
[1:39:44] woman is a woman she is the embodiment
[1:39:48] of the full effect of wisdom in a person
[1:39:52] she is wisdom made flesh she is proverbs
[1:39:56] made flesh and may we'll look at this
[1:39:59] tonight by God's grace she is prob
[1:40:05] herbs made flesh how many be the bride
[1:40:07] will be the word made flesh Christ was
[1:40:10] the fullness of the Godhead the fullness
[1:40:12] of the word made flesh
[1:40:13] we are just supposed to manifest our
[1:40:15] portion of the word amen
[1:40:20] proverbs 31 now verse 11 you've got your
[1:40:23] Bible so that's good I can put it up
[1:40:24] here for you I'm sorry I do have it up
[1:40:26] here proverbs 31 verse 11 I think we'll
[1:40:28] close to this the heart of her husband
[1:40:34] does safely trust in her so that he
[1:40:39] shall have no need of spoil interesting
[1:40:42] thought in it now I had to look up some
[1:40:46] of these commentaries to kind of get an
[1:40:49] idea so if if a woman really fears God
[1:40:55] if she hates evil and leaves evil it
[1:40:58] gets evil out of her house her husband
[1:41:01] will learn to trust her now he should
[1:41:04] have been trusting her before they got
[1:41:05] married right in best-case scenario he
[1:41:08] should have saw MA she really fears the
[1:41:10] Lord I can trust her she loves God she
[1:41:11] loves the house of God she loves the
[1:41:13] preaching the word she loves to pray
[1:41:14] she loves the things of God my she's
[1:41:16] filled with the spirit and if she lives
[1:41:20] like that then her husband even before
[1:41:22] they're married will I know I can trust
[1:41:24] her
[1:41:24] that means confidence she has confidence
[1:41:27] I'm sorry he has confidence in his wife
[1:41:32] so if she's a woman that fears the Lord
[1:41:35] and will do him good all the days of his
[1:41:37] life then he will safely trust in her
[1:41:41] the commentary now now this is the
[1:41:43] partner strange so that he shall have no
[1:41:45] need of spoil no need of spoil we
[1:41:49] usually think of spoils with wars don't
[1:41:51] we like after Abraham to feed the four
[1:41:53] kings he went out for the spoil and
[1:41:55] brought the spoil in david at Ziklag
[1:41:58] david's family was all taken away he
[1:42:00] prayed and God direct him okay go
[1:42:01] possess get everything back it'll be
[1:42:03] your spoil you'll gain everything back
[1:42:04] that's your spoils of war so this is
[1:42:07] interesting so this is what Clarke says
[1:42:08] I like it he says she is an unspotted
[1:42:11] wife the heart of her husband does
[1:42:13] safely trust in her he knows she will
[1:42:15] take care that a proper provision is
[1:42:19] paid for his household and will not
[1:42:22] waste anything so he knows she's gonna
[1:42:28] take care of everything in the home
[1:42:30] she's a good manager of the house praise
[1:42:34] God
[1:42:34] if he works hard makes money all week he
[1:42:36] knows she's not gonna go blow it on
[1:42:38] Amazon or something like that right or
[1:42:41] you name it
[1:42:42] Cavs tickets I don't know
[1:42:45] you name it movie tickets she's not
[1:42:47] gonna go blow it on some worldly lust he
[1:42:50] trusts her can trust your wife with your
[1:42:53] checkbook can't you brothers and what's
[1:42:58] more important than that your children's
[1:42:59] lives
[1:43:00] your children's souls yeah so this is
[1:43:05] what he says he has no need for spoil in
[1:43:07] other words he is not obligated to go
[1:43:10] out on predatory excursions or wars of
[1:43:13] conquest he doesn't have to make
[1:43:15] extra-extra wars in order to provide for
[1:43:19] the family at the expense of the
[1:43:24] neighboring tribes he doesn't have to
[1:43:25] kind like an untimely thing well I've
[1:43:28] got to go out get out a part-time job
[1:43:29] now if you need one that's different
[1:43:31] like if just it was a trial or something
[1:43:34] like that
[1:43:34] but if the wife's overspending and now
[1:43:38] the husband's got to go get another job
[1:43:40] now that's something we need to talk
[1:43:41] about can ever understand that by God's
[1:43:44] grace there's a difference here I'm not
[1:43:46] saying if our money runs out or the
[1:43:47] extra insurance or insurance went up I'm
[1:43:50] not talking about things that you can
[1:43:52] you know you can't predict I'm talking
[1:43:54] about a woman doing sinful things and he
[1:43:57] can't trust her with the management of
[1:43:59] the home this is what the scripture says
[1:44:02] so a godly proverbs 31 woman the husband
[1:44:06] can trust her with resources of the home
[1:44:09] how many sisters feel better now by
[1:44:12] God's grace amen he can trust her he
[1:44:16] Key's got to go and he's got to do his
[1:44:17] work he's gonna come home and he knows
[1:44:20] she's trustworthy he's got confidence
[1:44:22] she's gonna manage things at the house
[1:44:24] well that's what the word guide means to
[1:44:26] manage she's the manager remember Titus
[1:44:29] said guide the whole not rule the whole
[1:44:32] guide the home the man rules the home
[1:44:35] and the church said notice what harm to
[1:44:38] send our feet I'll stop right here I've
[1:44:39] already gone over an hour I'm going to
[1:44:41] our and five minutes to notice what
[1:44:43] harmony Jesus never did anything until
[1:44:45] he's seen of the father or the father
[1:44:48] showed him first
[1:44:50] this is spoken word original seed this
[1:44:52] is where he said pick up your pen and
[1:44:53] write the Holy Spirit told the Prophet
[1:44:57] harmony between God and Christ see John
[1:45:00] 5:19 so will the bride and he shows her
[1:45:04] his word of life he knows her and she
[1:45:09] receives it she never doubts it nothing
[1:45:12] can harm her not even death for the
[1:45:15] Seabee planned the water will raise it
[1:45:17] up again brother Graham wrote a big
[1:45:20] hallelujah after that I mean Oh God's
[1:45:22] going to raise you up if the seed of
[1:45:25] God's been planning your soul gonna
[1:45:26] raise you up amen here's the secret the
[1:45:30] word is in the bride and the mind of
[1:45:33] Christ to know what he once done with
[1:45:36] the word and she does it in his name she
[1:45:41] has thus saith the Lord
[1:45:43] then it's germanized so the Holy Spirit
[1:45:45] waters it until it's grown and serves
[1:45:49] its purpose so just like this woman
[1:45:52] takes care of all the resources he
[1:45:54] trusts her in the home and everything
[1:45:57] they have with the checkbook and the
[1:45:58] food and all the resources just as the
[1:46:01] natural husband can trust his natural
[1:46:04] life with all the resources so Christ
[1:46:06] wants to trust us with his word that we
[1:46:10] will not try to bring the word to pass
[1:46:12] ourselves or for something to happen but
[1:46:14] we will know the word so well and be so
[1:46:17] led by a spirit that everything will
[1:46:19] happen in his time for his purpose
[1:46:22] hallelujah let's bow our heads here for
[1:46:24] a moment
[1:46:25] real or see if you could come we'd
[1:46:27] appreciate that
[1:46:32] now churches we
[1:46:34] pray think about the thoughts from this
[1:46:37] message here a lot of it dealt with
[1:46:42] submission just giving in just having a
[1:46:46] voluntary attitude to give in a lot of
[1:46:51] it dealt with not exalting anything
[1:46:54] above the headship God's given us not
[1:46:57] making the children idols not
[1:46:59] compromising on the word doing good to
[1:47:02] your spouse every day of your life for
[1:47:05] the brothers loving your wives for the
[1:47:08] sisters doing good to your husbands
[1:47:10] every single day of your life let's take
[1:47:12] a moment examine our lives here we know
[1:47:18] the Holy Spirit is the Word of God and
[1:47:20] it's sharper than any double-edged sword
[1:47:23] it divides asunder soul body and spirit

[1:47:29] the Word of God has spoken to somebody
[1:47:30] this morning I believe it has Amen let's
