========================================

and the Lord shall be safe [Music] my soul [Applause] Hallelujah It Is Well with our Souls praise God let's take our Bibles and we'll stand let's go to Revelation chapter 8. as I said I'd like to preach on the seven Thunders teach on it by God's grace and we're not doing this live today I'm just recording the audio and then I will post it either tonight or tomorrow on the YouTube channel as I said on Wednesday you know I forgot how much static is on there and so bag and I need to meet at some point and we'll do that by God's grace and try to get the static off there um I feel like this might be the best recording we can get by God's grace Revelation chapter 8 verse 1. of course we'll start with the seventh seal and then look at the seven Thunders by the grace of the Lord so I had two questions on it this week and I appreciate the questions and I thought it was uh you know also inspired I put out a video last week about the supernatural cloud from Arizona in 1963 so I just kind of felt it was kind of Timely I had a different few sermons kind of preparing and yesterday like I said with music and other things but I thought I would just go ahead and preach this today uh since we had Emma back and um I thought it'd be a help To Us by God's grace it's kind of like a review from when I preached it back in March 2022 so I'll just kind of review some of that and added a couple new visuals so Revelation chapter 8 verse one of course this is the only verse on the seventh seal brother Brown tells us there's no symbols and there are no symbols there's no horse riders there's no beasts or anything like that all's we're told is that there's silence in heaven and of course we know the only reason that could be is if Jesus left heaven because all the cherubim constantly saying holy holy holy to Jesus and then all this heavenly worship stops the only reason it would stop is if Jesus left so let's read verse one together ready one two three and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour let's go to Revelation chapter 10. we'll read verse three I'm just going to try to conserve time here by God's grace let's read verse three Revelation 10 verse three let's read that on three one two three and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices amen let's have a one more word of prayer here I just I need God's grace I'm sure you do too I'd like to present this as simple as possible and I for those who have questions I love the questions those are wonderful questions and I just would pray that the Holy Spirit would dissolve all doubts and just give us understanding I know some of these things Saints took me years to understand um and that's fine because that's the that's the timing of God so let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you again for today Lord God and we're humble to be in your presence It Is Well with our souls today Lord God hallelujah how we look forward to that one day Lord when our faith will become sight I believe Peter said that in the scripture he said having not seen but you love and Lord that's how it is Lord we haven't seen your physical body in a glorified condition but we love you we felt your spirit Lord God hallelujah we've seen your spirit with spiritual eyes do wonderful things in our lives Lord God so we're aware of your presence today Lord God I ask that the great Holy Spirit Lord God would just take control Lord God and just give understanding Lord and I pray Lord I could be used as your vessel Lord again to look at this topic lord it's an important topic it's a it's a it's a modern event Lord that we look at fulfilled by prophecy in this day Lord God so we thank you for your blessings we thank you what for what you've done Lord and what you are doing Lord God and what you're going to do so father we thank you for every blessing guide this message today in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as your BNC to praise God and I apologize you know Wednesday uh I preached on music more in depth and then the live stream cut off so I'm sorry what happened was I was using the church's Wi-Fi and that's why we've had all the sermons drop over the years is because the Wi-Fi signal goes in and out and that's why we ran that line to give the laptop direct Wi-Fi and I think it's only dropped one I think in the all these months we've done that so I do apologize about amen or whoever was listening I don't know if bang has a chance to listen at work or not but I do apologize and then I tried to record the rest but then when I switched over and played those songs I was there when the spirit came on my iPad it stopped recording because it had to play the audio so I didn't even get the second half recorded so uh so as much as I like technology I'm not very good at technology so but anyways let's uh let's look at this thought here by God's grace so um I just want to you know preach this I have some slides here as simply as I can by the grace of the Lord and again we had a couple questions about the Seven Seals and the Seven Thunders um and I just want to encourage everybody too you know I was praying up here and the thought just came to me you know I was praying for Chris you know I was looking for I was at Walmart yesterday I was looking for Chris I didn't see him you know I was looking for him to invite him back to church um you know Kyle Steve Shelby and member jakori Paul's son he came on that Wednesday night and it just struck me all five of those people were here when we were dancing around the church and praising God I thought wow I thought these five you know will continue to pray for them but these five visit us at a time when the spirit of Joy was here in other words they couldn't say and come in and say oh that was a dead service in fact they all said the opposite uh brother Steve or yes brother Steve said I love the energy but we know it's not energy it's the Holy Ghost you know yeah he calls it energy but like we used to say oh that was fun but it's not fun the word is Joy God's not fun God's full of joy I just was so blessed by that you know that God sent us these visitors in these last you know six months or whatever and each one has been able to feel the joy of the Lord now what's sad is that they've left the joy for things of the world that's why they're not here but we can have peace in our hearts that the joy was here the love of God was here and hopefully it'll they'll be reminded of that and they'll be attracted back to hear the word of God hallelujah think about I mean all those think about all those people in Jesus Ministry for three and a half years they saw him heal Miracles and then they all shouted crucifer not all but many of them shouted crucify him what happened just a week earlier they were saying Hosanna Hosanna it's just the spirit that people fall under how important it is for us to stay under the spirit of God right as we said with music on on Wednesday you know these people from uh Hillsong Bethel or you name it uh you name any of them you know I like Phil you know I like Shane and Shane you know but when they when they're in the channel of the Holy Spirit they get the right words but when they add rock and roll or any worldly beats then they get under the wrong spirit but how important for us it is to stay under the right spirit of God and I believe we're doing that by the grace of God it's just like Balaam as we said Balaam could get under the spirit of God but then there was other times he'd be under the wrong Spirit right I say the most the time he was under the wrong spirit so I just thought I'd share that you know I wrote that on my notes here and I just want to encourage you you know these visitors have seen our best Joy they've seen our our best worship Hallelujah and uh our best songs you know our best praise and so we'll just trust that God will draw them back you know all that the father has given me will come to me praise God so we have that great promise that God uh if these people you know really want to serve God then we're right here praise God we're not going anywhere we're right here and we'd be happy to have them uh by the grace of God so Saints I just want to make this as simple as possible you know what so here's where I preach I preach it back in March of 2022. now for me this is like going viral 280 views on my on my sermon that's you know most of my sermons get 20 views you know something like that um you know it just shows people are just you know it's okay but people are interested in some of the controversial topics which is okay um and then I preached a part two I think the next service I don't know I didn't look that one up but uh if you'd like a uh review of this topic I was listening to it on the way here you know uh just to see was there anything I could leave out or anything I left out there I'd like to include um and it was a pretty anointed service by God's grace I felt the presence of God and um but anyways just if you like a review that's a good sermon to go listen to um and just think it's been 60 years since God opened the seals 60 years 1963 to 2023. and I'll say like this very few people have the right understanding of the seals uh or the seven Thunders and that's okay that's what Jesus said he said very few will find the narrow road um and to me you know uh to me I feel like uh like brother bam said he said take these tapes and go listen to them and the in the quietness of your home and he said see what the Holy Ghost will reveal to you Hallelujah and so that's what I've done you know that's what uh real Holy Ghost filled Saints do they go home and they listen to brother Branham and they meditate on those things Hallelujah and then God can show them revelations in there Hallelujah and so that's what I've done like I said I preach over 125 sermons just on the Book of Revelation and if we put these in here now I'm getting close to 130 but it's just important to Remember You know here 60 years later and we can look back and clearly see what God was doing by the grace of God and this all plays into uh the prophecy like last time Simon was here when I was here um you know I I said I come up here and I said the order remember the order of the Rapture what's left you know we have uh uh we have birth pains left that's what's happening now I mean you see the flooding you see the earthquakes you see all these uh natural disasters around the world that's birth pains uh covid-19 was the birth pain so we have birth pains left we I also at the same time we have the uniting of church and state right we have the brother Brown calls it The Binding of the tares so there there's numerous scriptures that need to be fulfilled and then to me as I said when Simon was here uh to me the biggest sign that the raptures here will been will be when the United States begins to lay down the mark now we believe will be raptured right before the Mark is laid down amen but laws first have to be passed where they where the United States because the United States is the beast in Revelation 13 verses 11 to 18 the beasts out of the land not the Beast out of the sea that was that was Pagan Rome turning into imperial Rome right but in verses 11 to 18 we have the Beast rising up out of the land that was the United States of America brother Brown tells us right they have power to make fire come down from heaven that's the atomic bomb uh from 1945 the two bombs that they dropped in Japan but to me that will be the greatest sign that the Rapture is here so until then what do we keep doing keep drawing closer to Jesus all the time Hallelujah watching watching and praying watching the signs praying and staying close to God not letting little things you know divide us and not let little things distract us from the presence of God and growing in Grace and knowledge of the Lord so you know we've seen at church you know I'm just going to kind of fly off the the cuff here I'm just going to shoot from the hip they say you know since brother left the scene look at all these people that follow brother random very few of them actually stayed in the middle of the road I'm going to name a few names here Joseph Coleman he took the seven Thunders and he said those seven Thunders were the Seven Virtues Of The Statue of perfect man so he said the first Thunder was Faith the second was virtue the third was knowledge and he made that a dogma and the fruits of his ministry have now proven he was wrong and he was saying the only way to be raptured would be to be in his church well that's so convenient you know that's well it's my church and you I'll be in the Rapture because I'm in my church you know it's and he excludes everybody else and so now and then he had for all those years he had people following him around the world now how did his life end his life ended where he got so sick that he let new preachers come up and they were actually alcoholics and drug addicts and adulterers they were sleeping with women in the church and they falsely prophesied that he'd get well and how do I know because I heard this person's podcast about it oh yeah and I met the brother who was in the church uh the brother from Pennsylvania uh brother I can't remember his last name now okay it'll probably come to me a little bit but I just preached for him a couple weeks ago when I was out in Pennsylvania um I'm ashamed of myself I can't think of his name but he left that church for those very reasons and they also prophesied that Coleman would rise from the dead after he died and of course he's still in the grave and then Coleman's Sons were caught in money laundering they money laundered and stole millions of dollars from the people they tried to get the people in this pyramid scheme so always watch your money chair see who's after your money the devil's after your money right trying to do Shady deals on the side and all kinds of bad Investments and they went to jail Joseph Coleman's Sons went to jail and so see you know and think about Lee Van leevel he was a good guy at the beginning but after a while he preached and he got to the spot brother value before he passed away there was no shouting in the church but you there was no rejoicing no dancing no Holy Ghost no emotion at all because he said it's the Holy Ghost without sensation and it became what they they crucified the Holy Ghost and not those people can't get born again because they can't get free right and now there's forms of that too right there's extremes where people go on that that was in Ohio levale was from Ohio it's it's Saint Paris right it's right south of Lima um you know uh there's so few people now Perry green was one of the few men that stayed with the word of God Eddie bisco for the most part stay with the word of God now he had a really bad mistake I told you about haven't called his name but he had a really bad mistake in the 90s now church I'm saying some plain things here this morning so you can see the love of Jesus Christ should produce honesty the love of Jesus Christ yes it'll have Miracles yes it'll have uh uh Joy Hallelujah and I'm dancing and have all these things it's got to have the whole word of God though it's got to have Christian character if it doesn't then the persons aren't born again so I'm just you know um here I'm here am I you know here are we we're standing UH 60 62 years after brother Brown's off the scene now what has brother Adams Ministry produced in our lives is produced the fruit of the Holy Spirit praise God that's why I like when William comes and uh these people come the preachers come in and say you have a wonderful worship service I say thank God for brother amen uh or brother William will say I I feel Divine love when uh I come to this church and sister Elizabeth will say I go to mega church but I don't feel loved there but I feel love when I come to your church I can say thank God this is what the Holy Ghost produces praise God Amen amen it's not maybe not big in number but it don't have to be big a number it's got to have the character of Christ Hallelujah and Jesus said few there be that find it Hallelujah if we can't love our enemies we're not Christians Hallelujah if we can't love one another we're not Christians so you know this is like I said this is like a sermon like modern events made clear by prophecy so we'll look at some of these events now um I do want to read Daniel 12 4 before I forget I just made these notes before I come out here Daniel 12 verse 4. I don't have it on my slides that's why I wrote it there so I'll make a point about Daniel as well um Daniel 12. I'll just read verse one because we got time I don't really have a whole lot of slides because it's a kind of a review and at that time shall Michael stand up the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people he's talking to Daniel so Jews Michael will stand up for the Jews in the tribulation period and there shall be a time of trouble that's a tribulation such as never was since there was a nation even to the same time remember there's going to be demons that are going to be tormenting people for five months they look like scorpions they got hair like women uh they look like horses as well this is a time of trouble the world's never seen anyone who goes against the Catholic Church will be killed right but we'll be gone by God's grace before that happens that's what we believe that's what we believe the Bible teaches that at that time thy people shall be delivered that has to be the hundred and forty four thousand that's God's people Everyone that should be found written in the book now what a promise amen as long as your name's in The Book of Life hallelujah amen God will deliver you praise God God will not have wrath upon his people praise God verse two and many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt now that seems to be the white Throne judgment but it could be something else verse three and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever verse 4 but thou o Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased okay so we can clearly see that's our day knowledge is increased right we know that with technology how it's so increased um and so in other words the what I want to bring out is see he says seal the book so the mysteries of the book were sealed until the end right and then we know Revelation 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin the sound the mystery of God will be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets so there has to come a time when the mystery of God is open and is finished and that's according to Revelation uh chapter 10 verse 7. now before I get to the the order I want to just go through these slides so I want to start with the seven Church ages brother Adam said the revelations not every word but the revelations in the church ages and the seals was thus saith the Lord as I've proven I've tried to prove through my videos um you know brother Brown used a lot of Larkin's information but Larkin didn't say everything brother Brandon said brother Brown said many more additional things that Larkin didn't say Hallelujah um and brother random said you know bring all your books when we preach the church ages and over 20 times he said we're going to use historians informations he he was being transparent but the revelations brother random gave were different than anybody else right right all the revelations in those uh seven Church ages and of course the Seven Seals so here's what he says he finished he's finishing the seventh seal now the vision now that's the vision he's speaking of of the cloud which he called the seven angels the constellation of seven angels The Vision Plus the word plus the history plus the church ages all blend together so I could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of God and the vision and the Revelation the interpretation therefore or thereof is thus saith the Lord hallelujah now you're all familiar with this so I'm going to try to just go slow with this here's the seven Church ages now these dates are very similar to Larkin but Brothers changed two of them I can't remember which ones they are now I know he changed laodicea and I think I can't remember which other one he changed um but brother man got the idea of the dates from Larkin he just changed two of them okay now Larkin didn't do Messengers it was Charles Tay's Russell that did Messengers but Charles Tays Russell makes him himself the seventh messenger and we know he wasn't he predicted the Rapture I think it was 1819 he said that's the year of the Rapture and it came and passed and you know he was he was no prophet um and then uh Charles days Russell had Saint John was the first church age messenger and brother Branham chose Saint Paul so see what what's happening church is that these men were drawing close to God and they had gifts to teach and preach but they weren't Prophets right and even the ones that said thou saith the Lord like Charles says Russell we're wrong they were proven to be wrong uh Clarence Larkin never said thus saith the Lord because he was just that he was just a teacher he was a pastor thank God he was a faithful he's a wonderful teacher of the word of God but he didn't have everything right it took a seventh Church age Messenger to finish the mysteries of God Hallelujah now I'm going to go through these a little faster you might remember these so now we're getting into the Seven Seals the Seven Seals show that God sent the first anointing on the church was as a lion okay and to combat that Satan sent out a white horse a deceptive teaching Antichrist spirit okay that's a white horse and uh that was the first seal and it was in innocent deception on the part of Satan but Church the elect cannot be deceived it's impossible for us to be deceived someone was texting me yesterday overseas and said you know what he's looking at my music videos and he said I really appreciate that uh he said but yeah he said but we got to be so careful with music I'm like yes exactly right we must be so careful but I sense a little bit of fear on him and so I said friend we're not going to be deceived I don't walk around saying oh is God going to strike me down here is God going to strike me down here I walk in the love of God hallelujah now I am a Son of God hallelujah now I'm a Child of God but yes yes I'm aware I want to be very aware but I've served God long enough to know if I walk and Joy walk and be in those moments when I might make a mistake the Holy Ghost is there to correct me praise God he'll show me he'll correct me just like he did brother Brandon praise God remember that still small voice Hallelujah one thing's quiet down in your home or at night time or morning time whenever time you get quiet time that's that's so small voice will start saying Jesse or Zer or Beatrice or acacia check this area of your life study this further it's a still Small Voice right or sometimes there may be preachers and they'll just blast exactly what you needed right it won't be a still Small Voice they'll be shout when you're screaming or jumping around or pouting on the wall like brother Diggs or something like that you you'll know it's God praise God there's just something about the Christian they know God is speaking praise God because their ears can hear what the spirit says in the church Hallelujah right they've got they have ice out they can see God moving to their midst praise God they're not blinded to the things of the world you know they're not blinded by Leo to see them they're not blinded by the goddess evil age praise God but the true God of this age the Lord Jesus Christ has given them ice out and they can see Hallelujah they've got spiritual sight now this white represents the number of years so the first seal was it was the beasts working on both Vines but it was also a time period okay so it lasted almost two Church ages all right well then brother Adam said after that the Antichrist jumped off his White Horse and got on a bloody red one and that's when he got power to kill right so that's Satan it's death it's the death rider the whole time we just find out his name under the fourth seal okay so then he's going to come and so the Saints have to have the anointing of the ox to make themselves a sacrifice to die as martyrs okay that's the second now Satan's got United powers to kill United church and state okay and this last uh over parts of three Church ages okay and then brother Brown said then he's now that he's got power of church and stay and power to kill uh now he he can take control uh as the Black Horse he's got power to control the food and the spiritual food he's got power almost of all the uh the known world right and uh brother Brown said that's the black horse or the Dark Ages he's capturing the wealth of the world that's where you have your Crusades you know the Catholic Church would go on crusades and they would promise you know every person every man that died they promised them eternal life and all their sins forgiven and they get to get out of purgatory for free that's the same thing the Muslims do right they know if they die in a Jihad then they get they automatically go to heaven Allah will let them go to heaven they'll have like a hundred wives or something like that they promise them all these lies they can't handle one wife how are you going to handle 100 wives right they don't have the character to handle one wife and them in that age there'll be no marriage like it is here right it won't be a physical thing it'll be a spiritual thing right a spiritual Unity but they always tempt them with those type of worldly lies and so forth now the longest seal was the third seal was over 900 years this lasted okay and so that that black horse rode for a long time right he was capturing the wealth of the world but slowly though at the end the pope lost his power and influence over the Nations and it's all it's all laid out in my book where's my book it's all laid out in there I just had brother Brian he's like you texted me yesterday he said you wrote this book I'm like yeah I wrote it two years ago he's like I'm just finding out about it today I thought that's a good sign I'm not bragging about my book or anything like that it's just uh it's just and I told him I said he said oh brother I'm so far behind I said no brother I said God's put your God's foot God has ordered your footsteps to the Lord forgive me trying to go too fast the footsteps of the righteous are order the Lord and you and I will find everything we need in the right season of Our Lives praise God if we make a mistake God will forgive us and God will bring us back in the perfect will but you'll find exactly what you need at the right time God is faithful Hallelujah and so write about the laodicean church age now we need an ego anointing we need a prophetic Ministry to finish the mystery of God to turn our hearts back to the apostolic fathers but also spiritual death is here okay so this rides it wrote from about 1906 it's not my brother man's birth and right out to the end time this ego anointing will last that long now some people may say it may go in the two Israel prophets well I'll give you that because they're prophets I'll give you that brother man said you know the gospel rent from the Jews to the Gentiles right through through Paul Barnabas and all those Saints and then he says it's got to go back from the Gentiles back to the Jews that that seems like it's true okay and so that rides out now um we go up in the Rapture but of course I said that anointing might stay on those two prophets I'm just giving you a visual and brothers said the pale horse rider makes his ride all the way down to the battle of Armageddon okay because that's where the Antichrist is defeated and the Antichrist is cast in the Lake of Fire right there at the end of Armageddon that's his final ride okay now I'm going to give a better illustration of this later but the seventh seal is the rapture I'm going to get um it starts it starts the seventh seal is the beginning of the end right because once once the Rapture goes it's all it's all bad after that yeah it's all bad it's all judgments and Wrath and time is beginning to run out now time is going to start running out this is the last mystery this is the last set of events before eternity sets in and God ends time so also right after you know the Rapture in the fifth sea almost happened at the same time the Rapture happens and then the Jews you know saying how long O Lord now the Raptors happen how long Lord and and the Lord says I've got more Jewish Martyrs that have to be fulfilled okay and that's during the tribulation period okay and then the sixth C of course is the Tribulation seal it's the interruption of nature it's two prophets that can control nature right they can turn the Waters of blood they can make it not rain for three and a half years right and then after they leave then you have another half last week of the tribulation period where the trumpets are blown the vows are pouring out the woes are pouring out and then it all ends up with the battle of Armageddon all right praise God now this is a lot of review now here this one might help you so this one brand new I made this one this morning so hopefully it helps you by God's grace okay so the church ages and the Seven Seals now see I didn't I didn't break up so I didn't have time I didn't break up this into seven pieces okay it's just one Church age so it's two thousand years it's all the church ages and just in one little small little group there okay so hopefully this will help somebody by God's grace so that was the first seal the first seal lasted that time okay the second seal lasted a little bit longer the third seal was the longest right of the time periods of the first four seals and now the fourth seal is going to last a little while too it lasted from the start of the seven Church age and it's going to last all the way down to the battle of Armageddon because the four seal has the fourth Rider death and death makes his final ride we can you can read about it in Revelation chapter six he makes his final ride and he deceives uh I believe a fourth part of the earth the Bible says or the the four corners of the earth and he deceives them and brings them to the battle of Armageddon so that's the four seal now here watch this one we're here by God's grace here's the seven seal the seven seal is a time period I hope that helps you by God's grace let me do let me go back can I go back all right I gotta run them all back again all right I wish I could go back one at a time the Rapture starts the seventh seal or the final mystery here of these Seven Seals It's the final time period before time ends okay so watch this one here's a seven seal the seven seal is all it's from the time of the the end of the Gentile Church ages all the way to the New Jerusalem I'll show the New Jerusalem a little bit so once the Rapture happens the Seven Seals open okay and then uh here's the next one there it is okay there's official the fifth seal is just a short time after the Rapture the Jews cry out how much longer how much longer and he says more of your brethren more Jews have to die in the tribulation period that's official okay now the Sixth Seal is just that uh tribulation period The Seven Year Great Tribulation period the Jew the two Jewish prophets preach it for the first three and a half years and then they go they go home in the Rapture praise God and then uh God pours out his wrath that's the Sixth Seal okay and then brother Adam said the seventh seal he says the end of time he said it's the end of the seals it's the end of the uh it's under the vials it's under the trumpets end of he said it's the end of everything amen send them everything and so once the white Throne judgment happens and and then once there's you know all the Sinners have been casting Lake of Fire all the demons thank God they've been casting Lake of Fire no more torment Hallelujah once it's all done and the New Jerusalem comes down then time shall be no more praise God no more there's no more seals praise God Hallelujah it's just this glorious time the honeymoon's over now we're entering into our home life with Jesus hallelujah praise God the honeymoon somewhere in here honeymoon's right the honeymoon's a big spot in here praise God it's in your honeymoon Gloria but I hope that helps by God's grace does that help can anybody say Amen is it anybody raise a hand if that helps or anything okay good okay so now what would be more beneficial is if I could zoom this in so make this smaller and I could put Daniel 70 weeks on top of that and you see it even better right so if I had room over here all the way for way for Babylon all the way to the feet right and then God blinded the Jews he stopped Daniel 70 weeks and then he's going to pick it up and then I'll put the feet right here right after the Rapture everybody understand yes because God because that that image has to be this is what I want to say Church it's okay if you're going in Grace and knowledge of God Daniel was in Babylon all those years at the end of his life he fasted for 21 days to know what God was doing and he kept reading Jeremiah's words and we're reading the Bible today praise God he was still trying to understand prophecy in other words and after 21 days God showed him that vision of the statue praise God and but it took a lot of time it took a lot of waiting on God it took seeking God so what I'm saying is keep seeking God God will reveal all he wants you to know in his season praise God Amen 21 days and then Gabriel comes to him and says you're greatly beloved in heaven praise God and the Bible says we're God's beloved Hallelujah so we have we have the grace to know where God's beloved so we got to live like it praise God let's keep living like how many one living like it by God's grace I want to live like I'm God's beloved you know I had a Canadian gentleman text me yesterday and he said I just want to tell you brother Jesse every time I listen to you preach and make all your videos he said I fall more in love with this message and I wrote him back I said brother from the bottom of my heart you make me want to cry you're such a blessing to me praise God that's what I want to do praise God I want to just show the truth of the revelation of the Bible I want to believe the Bible live the Bible uh believe in brother Branham honey is God's Prophet just like all the other six Church age Messengers I want to manifest Jesus Christ to my generation praise God let me read that now here's brother Adam's prayer it's on the inside of this this Bible what was brother man's prayer dear God help me to be thy true servant I promise to teach this thy holy word praise God and to live it as thou will help me to do I do believe everywhere in this Bible how many kids say Amen to Be Thy word help me to live and prove it so to my generation how do you say that's my prayer too that's fine and I like this Bible because it says now write your prayer to God but I never wrote it because I said that's my prayer I'm just going to use the same prayer Reverend he says I he said in Jesus Christ's name I pray a man Reverend William Branham Tucson Arizona his unworthy humble servant that's what I want to be I'm an unworthy but I want to be a homo servant to Jesus Christ and make this real to as many people as I possibly can now you gotta be careful you buy this Bible because at the bottom Joseph put in here he said may your understanding of the words written in this holy book agree line for line word for word and Dot for DOT with the message of the hour in other words may you agree with every word on the tape now see you got good and you got bad that's okay I love the brother I was emailing him yesterday I always mentioned that every service it's not a complex I'm just trying to help him I said when are you going to say what the tapes say the tapes say Billy Paul's a promise Joseph when are you going to say that I said when are you going to put that on your blog I'm probably gonna get no response that's okay that's okay I'm not trying to be a smart alec I'm just saying when you have the truth you're not you're not afraid of questions you don't avoid hard questions you pray and let God reveal it to you praise God so I'm trying to be as kind as possible now let me go over this here you know to understand the seals and the Thunders you have to know the seals have three forms okay brother Ram said there's symbol form uh there's reality form and there's Revelation form there's three forms to the Seven Seals that's where it gets confusing especially with the seventh seal because Brothers will say the Seven Seals open and then he says the seven seal has been open to us well it is open right and some of the in a couple of the forms but it's not open in some of the other forms okay so you just have to listen to the first seal and I'm not going to read through all this because you can go back and listen to the um the sermon I just want to uh go through these quickly here by God's grace so uh where's Acacia okay she had a good question all right she she had one of the questions which was a great question okay so the first seal the symbol was given to John in 90 A.D the reality form happened that's that white time space period I put on the time timeline and the Revelation was given to brother Branham on March 18 1963. uh that was a Monday right yeah Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday 60 years ago second seal oh yeah I'm sorry in the first seal when brother man preached that and he got done preaching when he was preaching the Revelation that he saw in the vision that was God's voice thundering out to the people it didn't sound like thunder on Earth but it sounded like thunder in heaven praise God Amen the Bible said it was Thunder hallelujah amen right so what when brother and preaches what was happening it was Jesus bringing an open book down to brother Branham it was fulfilling Revelation chapter 10 1-7 Hallelujah and then now that the book's opened but Ram can preach exactly what it what what the the vision saw with and it lines up with the word word for word line for line in the Bible praise God and then he can say that thus save the Lord praise God that's a lie that's a line roaring let's read that if you got your Bible I'll go to Amos 3 7. do you want to read that for me you're always going to be my official first reader all right no I don't have the official Imo's three seven we never got down your unto his servant to the prophets amen now I can read verse six I think I left out six okay now read verse eight okay praise God so that scripture says God will do nothing except he reveals a secret to His prophets and it's like a lion roaring right okay now if you got your Bible go to Revelation chapter 10. now some of these symbols are a little difficult to see and I don't claim to have a good understanding of all of them um but we can clearly see uh lots of similarities here now we know verse Revelation 10 verse 7 is brother Ram's Ministry where the mystery of God is finished now how does it get finished it's got to be finished uh by the mighty Angel Christ in other words the Holy Spirit coming down and bringing the revelations to a man on the Earth okay verse one and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and with the rainbow I'm sorry a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of Fire now we know the cloud uh look like this I'm gonna skip ahead so this is a video I put out last week I think yeah 11 days I'm sorry two almost a week and a half ago so this is what we believe this this cloud in uh taken in Arizona February 19 I'm sorry February 1963 was was Jesus clothed in the cloud that may seem strange but if you read the Bible many times God came down in the cloud he came down to Moses in the cloud I mean numerous times he overshadowed Solomon's Tabernacle in a cloud amen in the cloud so cloud is something God would often do he'd often put himself in a cloud okay now we know it's Jesus uh because the Rainbow on his head and his face as the sun and feed his pillars now there's no there's no face feet or rainbow here but these are descriptions of Jesus in heaven in Revelation chapter one so you see it's Jesus coming down and a rainbow means a covenant anyway praise God now I want to show this too this cloud of course was was taken I think brother Jose's not here but I want to thank him for so here's the picture of that cloud in this 1963 now a lot of people think it's awesome that there's a rainbow on the other side so if you could actually look through this through the light you would see a rainbow on top of the cloud now some people I can see it now I can see a rainbow on top of the cloud so some people say that's the Fulfillment of Revelation 10 1 I don't know um I just think it's very fitting though I think it's very fitting I think it's a great it's a great uh it's a great sign that that was God along with all the other proofs okay okay and he had in his hand a little white book open now just so you know Jesus can't come back he can't set his foot on this Earth until the millennium so that so if this Mighty Angel comes down and he's got his foot on the sea in the land it's got to be the Holy Ghost because he will not touch this Earth until it's burned over with fire Hallelujah and we walk on the ashes of the wicked so this has to be a holy ghost coming and not a physical angel coming or like a spiritual angel coming visible like we'd see Gabriel we'd see Michael or we'd see wormwood or we'd see any other Angel like the angel of the Lord okay so these are all spiritual things now look at verse uh three and cry with a loud voice as when a lion roar now I read I read Amos three uh six seven eight to show that when God does a mystery it's like a lion roaring so here the Holy Ghost comes down he's clothed in a cloud and he Roars like a lion in other words a prophet is going to preach amen hallelujah the prophet's going to preach as when a lion roared and when he cried seven Thunders uttered their voices okay seven Thunders so when Jesus comes down he brings an Open Bible glory amen no more Mysteries Hallelujah as far as the bible-defined Mysteries are finished right and he makes he a lion roar so Christ Roars through the ministry brother random and what he does when that book comes down seven Thunders under their voices okay and like I showed you now let's go back so in case you this one I want to show this to you hon when when brother Brown preached the first seal that was the first thunder in other words all the truths of God that was the first Thunder they thundered out because a thunder is God speaking to his people whether through a prophet or rather or whether out loud too it could be out loud you could hear a thunder like in John chapter 12. okay so the first seal was the first Thunder because remember when this book was brought down seven Thunders utter their voices and the church said amen they've got to be uttered in other words if Revelation 10 7 is fulfilled then the seven Thunders had to smoke already right they hadn't been spoken because that's the order Christ comes down he's got the book open that's the revelation of the Bible and seven Thunder speak and then the mystery of God is finished praise God and then you and I are supposed to eat the book and go share it with the world share with everybody after that we can praise God is that right I love it praise God I love to know we're doing our part we're standing here saying all who want to hear from the open book can come hear the open book praise God I love that God's given Austin so many opportunities to share the about the open book invite people to church we all want to invite people to church but we got to wait for God's opportunities to do it right I love that Hallelujah so when so on March 18th the first Thunder sounded his voice the white horse rider uh the lion anointing Tuesday brother preached the second seal that was the second Thunder uh the red horse right and then the ox anointing all those Revelations was God thundering a second time Wednesday was the third seal that was the third Thunder Hallelujah amen money Tuesday was it Thursday was the fourth seal that was the four Thunder Hallelujah Friday was the fifth seal that was the fifth Thunder March 22nd 1963. Saturday was The Sixth Seal that was the sixth Thunder praise God and I'm just gonna go through these quickly because by now I'm sure some of you are more familiar with it how many know you sometimes you need repetition to understand things because I don't think anybody in here catches everything the first time right I know I didn't and you know as I get older I realize how much more I forget things I used to remember those quotes but now they've left my mind because I've studied different things and so I got to go back and review those quotes and then on Sunday March 24th brother man preached the seventh seal and that was the seventh Thunder God was telling us what we would know about the seventh seal as much as we could know now here's here's here's what I'm saying uh about the seventh seal the seventh seal had no symbol but it didn't have a description there's silence in heaven that must mean Jesus left Heaven that must mean it's the rapture now the reality form of the seven seal is the day in hours Matthew 24 I think it's 13. the day and hour no man knoweth except God only not the son not the Angels but God only right that's that's the reality form of the seven seal that day and hour when no man knows it but the revelation of it oh these two things this was the Revelation the Revelation was known to us on March 24th 1963. that's what we got the understanding about no sounds in heaven no symbol and the Rowdy form is the day and hour of the rapture okay now here's a more here's a more fun or more detailed or maybe more difficult to understand timeline hopefully not more confusing but it could be all I did was add the reality forms so here's where John got the symbol form of the Seven Seals in 80 90 or 180 it doesn't matter the actual year right the reality form is when all these time periods happened and those Spirits actually bowed each other so right now we're in the reality form of the Pale Horse the Revelation form came 60 years ago praise God in 1963. Hallelujah so a symbol form was 80 90 around that time the reality form was all those timelines and the Revelation form was in 1963. okay now at the end of this I will take questions okay because it probably a little shorter sermon than usual I forgot to set a timer how long has that been how long have I been preaching oh I would know okay I've been preaching 15 minutes okay so let me do a 15-minute timer let's see if we can do an hour and five minutes or something like that let's see if it's possible so um because I believe the seven Thunders already happened they believe their future okay but my quote for this was from Brother Branham brother Branham said all this was he said the seven Thunders were already in the past so let me read that here um brother Adam said Revelation 10 1-7 was history it's already happened meaning the open book has already been brought to the earth and the Seven Thunders already uttered their voices they've already given the revelation of the Seven Seals so Brother Band preached those seven nights that was God thundering out amen like a lion Hallelujah oh my thank God now here's where he says it brother says it five months before he passes away what's happened upon Mount Sunset now Mount Sunset was where he got this the sword of the king which he called the third pole which was going to be the opening of the word right also could include preaching the souls that were lost right we only preach one sermon on that so hold it in prison now I wanna I wanna preach more on that I just can feeling led to go other places I feel kind of burned to get those also Mount Sunset was where uh he said he said he was caught up in that consolation of angels that's that cloud he said he was caught up into that you know there's two thoughts on that now when when on February 28th brother Branham was not in Arizona where the cloud was he was in Texas pleading for the life of a of a young uh young man who was sentenced to die and then God the judge heard him uh brother Hammond it was Joel Osteen's Father John Osteen Joel Osteen's father was with brother Branham pleading for the judge to spare this young boy's life he was a murderer he was all but he was the boy one of these guys one of the preachers sons so Joel Osteen's dad and brother Brian pleaded for the boy's life and the judge gave him just life in prison okay but anyways on February 28th whether man was in Texas sorry have I got these backwards now there's two possibilities Brother Brad said he was caught up in that cloud well either he was transported like Ezekiel on February 28th or seven days later when he got there and he saw it that's when he was transported up into it but either one it doesn't matter yeah okay so people criticize brother Brown they'll say well he wasn't there he was in Texas well that's true he wasn't there but he might have been there by mission right right if we believe the Bible it could have happened praise God Ezekiel was carried a hundred miles in a vision from chaudia he was carried from was it modern day Iraq or was Saudi Arabia I think it's all right zika was carried from Iraq back to Jerusalem 100 miles the Bible said God picked him up by his hair by Vision how does that happen and then he saw those uh he saw all the sun worshipers in Israel's Temple and yet his body is laying over there in chaudia and people make fun people preachers made fun of me on the internet because I believe that's possible well they can make fun of whatever they want I've got thus save the Lord praise God on marriage and divorce the church ages the Seven Seals hair and Holiness I got dust saved the Lord I'm standing with the Bible praise God and anyone who lives Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer some form of persecution I don't care if anybody digital viral or not I just know that God will save the elect praise God and I'll do my part to get the elect to Heaven Hallelujah okay so it's either one either I was caught up by Vision on February 28th or seven days later no seven would be a good day it would have been March 7th or seven days later when he was there he was caught up now why is seven a good day because in ezek or in Exodus the cloud came down on Saturday night and seven days later Moses went up into the cloud so that's why March 7th might have been a good time when brother and went up in the cloud but it doesn't really matter okay and I'll share the reasons why what happened on Sunset mountain in Arizona it was God confirming his word what's all this noise about notice it's God fulfilling his promised word again of Revelation 10 1-7 and the days of the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God should be finished the hidden Mystery of Revelation 10 1-7 the last message to the last Church age fulfills exactly in this age Saint Luke 17 30 the day when the son of man shall be revealed and then brother M goes through this Life Magazine here he goes to This Life magazine in that cloud picture talks about it for two paragraphs I sent to Emma yesterday that's why I know we were talking about it and the god of Heaven promised that evening time would have evening lights three years ago this ministry the mystery of Revelation 10 1-7 he says was a was a prophecy what time is it sir brother man preached that on December 30th 1962. but now it's history it's past the promise is fulfilled what time is it sir and what's this attraction it's God fulfilling his word he's the same yesterday today and forever okay so brother random says Revelation 10 1-7 is fulfilled now let me show you that yeah here's the prophecies so here here's the date December 30th 1962. so this is two months before the cloud came down and brothers telling his church God is sending me out west amen now you know I got I had to send him out west because the other prophets had to be sent out to the desert Moses was sent out to the desert you were sent to the desert too buddy you got a good time for your life brother you were sent out to the desert to find God and then God sent you back east and then Paul had Christ and come back see so Brothers says sorry I'm so excited slow down Moses was sent to the desert to get the Commandments and Brogan said he wrote an Old Testament Paul was sent out to the desert met Jesus wrote A New Testament and brother Adam said his ministry as a prophet as the seven Church age messenger he says this is what house will you build me 1965. he said wouldn't it make sense if God's gonna finish all those Mysteries God would have to send a prophet out west and then send him back to give the revelation of the Seven Seals ah it's beautiful praise God Amen it's beautiful it fits the pattern praise God if it's the baron so brother Austin I was also telling brother Brooks he had numerous things like brother Branham he was almost beat up no brother Brooks was beat up by a group of guys and wanted to kill him but God stopped brother Brooks from doing that same thing with brother Brandon brother brand was beat up by Boys he took the shotgun out to shoot him and none of them none of the shells would go off right and then as soon as they leave then they all go off um there's other things brother Brooks was telling me I was like brother your life's just like brother Brandon Hallelujah sorry keep looking my hands anyways here so here's a prophecy bro I was talking about that cloud he said I like wings traveling faster than sound could travel they come from eternity doesn't that sound like Revelation chapter 10. the mighty Angel comes down in a split like a 20 of an eye not enough to batch your eye just a twinkle they were there I didn't have time to count I didn't have time no more than just a look mighty ones great powerful angels snow white wing set and heads and they were woo-woo and when it did I was caught up into this pyramid of constellations okay so that's what that cloud is it looks like a pyramid right looks like a pyramid and it's snow white it's a white cloud so he says that yeah he says that now and then at the end of the sermon he's this is like a three hour four hour sermon and he calls this the seven Thunder sermon as a second name because he's talking about Revelation 10 1-7 he's talking about God commissioning him to preach the seven church I'm sorry the Seven Seals right now look what he says church I'm standing in an awful place but if but if you knew it remember I tell you in the name of the Lord I've told you the truth and something is fixing to happen so it's thus saith the Lord this vision he called it Snow White pyramid see brother man's critics will say he didn't say cloud well he said a snow white pyramid isn't that what it was doesn't God come down in clouds of course no this is January is this is a month later this is uh 15 days later January 14 1963. um here in Phoenix tonight in the name of the Lord now how many preachers have you heard say that I come here in the name of the Lord brother Brown said he always waited on God to send him to places because when he got to the pulpit he could say I'm here in the name of the Lord no that's that's a different kind of message right there Hallelujah now I can say like this I believe I'm here in Akron In The Name Of The Lord because I'm feeding God's sheep the word of God Hallelujah I didn't send myself here God sent me here hallelujah he said I would not try to explain what's happened many of you people that take the tapes be sure to get that one what time is it sir that was just before I left home a vision sent me here yes I don't know I don't I'm not a tape salesman I'm not I don't stress those things like me I'm not a book salesman even though I write books I'm not a book salesman I don't stress it we get them and we got to take business around the world wait until the jungles everywhere they had the little something put up in their ears they got they can tape into the tape and stand there and translate that right into the language and it goes around the world now the photograph of that cloud was photographed let's see 14. a month and uh two six weeks later so he gives two prophecies right twice he says in the name of the Lord something's going to happen Snow White pyramids seven angels God's gonna do something and it happened praise God okay now on the video it's only 14 minutes here's four reasons I believe this Cloud was Supernatural brother branham's reputation as a faithful Bible teacher let me just put my two cents in right here I wrote this book on purpose and I purposely put less a brother and quotes in it so I could prove to everyone brother's message was the Bible praise God and um on my personal website I have I have a a PDF for every chapter with all the brother and quotes in it that back up the Bible truths that are in this book praise God because the guy told me I can't write a the book gets too thick if I put all programs quotes in here this book would be like this thing too thick so he said you gotta shorten it I said okay I'll take some things happen but I purposely Wonder just like my modesty book I purposely wanted everyone to see that modesty is a Bible teaching and God just used brother random to show it to us praise God and I still this day challenge all those haters out questions and haters all those accusers about around somebody read my my books and show me where I'm wrong and to this day none of them will do it now who's right and who's wrong I'll listen to their stuff brother Austin they won't hear anything I say who's right and who's wrong I think I'm right because I'm not afraid of their things they're afraid of my stuff because it's all the Bible okay and like I said I said when was the last time they listened to Brothers sermons he will weep and cry for 15 minutes or 30 minutes and plea with people to repent and get right with Christ where do you see these people doing it that have left the message where do you see you don't see them doing that they laugh and make jokes and they're they make they make fun of brother Brown they call them names they mock him all these kind of things where's the real love for Jesus Christ the second reason I believe it was Supernatural I just showed you those two quotes there was prophecy the third reason is if you have six extra hours of time you can listen to this guys I think he preaches three sermons on it he works in water so he knows all about clouds and water he heats water I guess he's a message believer in South Carolina and he showed how the cloud was too high it was too wide it was too dense all these things there's no clouds that can be formed at 28 miles high you can't no there's no clouds that high none he said man don't even have the power to get him up there he said you can't get up there he said it has to be a supernatural cloud and as one proof all the haters of brother Rams started making comments mocking him and church I was a witness he wrote back in love to every one of them and say oh well may God forgive you of that and I said well who's got the real fruit of Christ their comments were well well NASA and the Army proved it was a Thor rocket and he's like I he said that that's their that's just data he said I work with water here's all the facts he said you do the facts and he said God bless you at the end I like that he's got the real character of Christ and he's got all that scientific evidence it's way over my head I'm not that smart but if you want to watch it that's the thing to go watch oh yeah I had people this week watching my video uh they watched my video on it and they said wow I went back and watched that whole thing all my doubts are dissolved about the cloud whether it was from God or not I said praise God that's what I'm here for I'm here to point people to the truth now the fourth reason and I've dedicated the last two years of my life to this the fourth reason I believe the cloud was Supernatural because God gave brother Ram a supernatural revelation of the Seven Seals there's at least 38 differences between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin Charles Hayes Russell and Uriah Smith on the Seven Seals okay and there's way more than that because with each seal uh brother Ram's accusers only use one of those preachers not all three but one of them so that means on each seal that we I could compare brother Brown to the two other ones and that'd be even more differences there's probably 50 or 60 differences Hallelujah there's my uh hour and five minutes okay let me do another 15 minute loop I think I'll be done by that time now I put four additional points on there this case is ultimately the accuser's words versus brother Branham and brother Ram is not here to defend himself and government data and records are not infallible right the government said if you get the coveted shot you won't get coveted well guess what they all found out the government was lying what about the JFK assassination they still won't tell us all the details on that the September 11th attacks they still won't give us the details on that but you can watch the bombs that that those buildings bombs went off all the way down it wasn't just a plane knocked down the wall the building it'd be impossible they had fortified steel it's bombs it was an inside job it was a job done by the US government they lie about that how about the hunter Biden laptop they said also that was a lie now they say it's all real I'll Trust the government when the government comes in in the millennium Hallelujah that's what I'm gonna trust the government Hallelujah a righteous Governor Hallelujah he's got a ride of iron ruling all the nations hallelujah amen and and people say the second thing people say well brother man said he was under the cloud and he wasn't even there I said well maybe but he never said thus said the Lord I was under the cloud so it doesn't even matter at some point he was under the cloud but he didn't say when with thou saith the Lord he'll say now saith the Lord on February 28th I was under there he just said I was under it and church you all know this try to remember something happened last week and tell me all the details that happened last week I can't remember what happened yesterday what did we eat yesterday where'd you buy Walmart like my wife tells me all the time I I forget details of stories I'll say my mom was healed of I can now I would say my mom was here to lung cancer but it's not lung cancer it's liver cancer I do it all the time I can't get all my stories right if he was in Visions all the time I give him credit for all that he remembered praise God because he remembered a lot he's got a way better memory than me but they criticized and like I told you Church they're in this day Satan's trying to get our eyes off the Bible and get our eyes on brother has mistakes right who's the accused of the brother Satan is the accuser the Brethren yeah right they ought to be thankful for what brother random did preach and reveal the word of God showed us the right water baptism the right godhead showed us how to defy the Antichrist spirit amen showed us how to worship praise God Amen showed us how to live a Godly holy life a life of modesty and Holiness thank God Hallelujah for brothers Ministry and again brother man could have been under the cloud like Ezekiel 8 15. and they say well brother Adam didn't say cloud before the event but he said a snow white pyramid which looks just like a cloud now just so you know and here's I'm gonna try to bring this down here the reason you know I differ with you know I'll just say precious brother and not just in this state around the world the reason I disagree is because there's 52 quotes on the Thunders and brothers says lots of different things about the Thunders I remember when I preached on the latter rain last year remember I showed all the quotes on the latter ring and brother Adam said in some places the latter rain's already poured out and in some places the brother said Lord pour us around Atlanta rain tonight and then the church age book he said the latter rain is rapturing Phase rise to end time well you have quotes all over the place so what do you got to do go back to the word right so I I I've done the same thing when I preached this last time a year ago I went through all the 52 quotes and I just showed the highlights of them okay and so today I'm just going to re rehearse and then just show you a couple of ones that people have questions on or that uh that I've just respectfully disagreed with other people on so here's the here's the first there's two there's two quotes people most understand and the reason they misunderstand it is because Brothers connecting the seven Thunders to rapturing Faith in other words brother brother I'm saying we'll have rapturing faith when the seven Thunders are revealed that's why they say we're still waiting for the seven Thunders now these are real quotes but you got to see what did Brother random also say about the seven Thunders right okay so this is that same message where look he gives the vision he gave the vision of the pyramid the cloud with in the name of the Lord in the same sermon he says but this one didn't come from Earth he come down from heaven because the mystery is finished he's talking about the mighty angel of Revelation 10. and when the Mysteries finished the angel said time shall be no more and seven Thunders throw their voices out what now what if now this is not they'll say the Lord he said what if it is something to let us know how to enter into the rapturing faith what if the seven Thunders are something to help us know to enter the raspberry page what if they are we'll receive them because I'm praying every day for them I'm praying for Jesus Christ to guide me to all true so I know I'll get it praise God if their future but I believe they're already fast is it he said is it will we run and leap over walls he's quoting Joel now Church there's never been a time where Saints have leaped over walls men have Samson picked up Gates they've been given superhuman strength they've killed lions and bears but I don't remember anybody ever jumping over walls with super jumping power like Mario we might get it by the way you and I can jump over the walls we might but he but so I I believe Joel is actually a spiritual thing we'll jump over the walls of the obstacles in our lives you know like before the Rapture we'll have to I don't know if it's natural or not nobody knows that's why brother Ram didn't give us the save the Lord he didn't know but he's saying what if what if it is is it is it I don't know will we run leap over walls and is there something fixing to happen these all marred vile bodies are going to be changed can I live to see it oh Lord is it so close that I'll see it is this generation serves my brother what time is it another church was was Jeff what was brother Adam's Generation The Generation that saw the Rapture no no but he was hoping it was is it okay if you hope it is yes is it okay if I hope it is yes I hope it's in my generation but if it's not I hope it's in your generation right I hope it is now I hope I live long into your generation [Laughter] hope I get to 120 can you imagine me being 120. here's now here's one people really major on because it's in the seals sermons so this was four months later or three months later and then there's coming for seven mysterious Thunders that's not even written at all remember remember the Holy Ghost told John don't write what those Thunders were about he says I believe that through those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it there's something we got to step further we can't have enough faith for Divine Healing Harley we got to have enough Faith to be changed in a moment and be swept out of this Earth and we'll find that after a while the Lord willing find where it's written okay so this is the quote different people will say well see you know we don't see a lot of Miracles so the seven Thunders must not be revealed well there's there's certain things that are keeping keep in mind here uh by God's grace you know we can't have enough faith for divine healing well when has God not healed our sick who's sick that hasn't been healed right now brother amen's battling right but he's a lot better by God's grace but remember God let Paul be sick a long time yeah yeah God let Timothy get often infirmities in his stomach I don't know if that relates to you brother but I just thought that it just came in right now that thine Austin infirmities right and yet is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever absolutely regarding we got to have enough Faith to be changed in a moment now we got to balance this out because I showed I showed the church a quote um was it Wednesday night the Rapture will be an easy thing did I share that Wednesday night for the rest of the rash would be everything easy it'll be an easy thing so you got quotes on both sides so what do we do today we go back to the word of God gotta go back to the word we might leap over walls that might be part of it I don't know we don't know is it is it going to be in our generation I don't know but it could be tomorrow we gotta live like it's tomorrow praise God now look at that March 63. so these are the quotes some people use but there's two quotes after the seals that say the seven Thunders were the revelations already contained in the Seven Seals so that that's that's where I take a lot of Peace in that that and also brother said Revelation 10 1-7 is history so I've got two quotes plus another quote saying it's already in the past and the Seven Thunders already spoke in the Seven Seals so that's why I stand where I stand now I wanted to play this but I didn't get it recorded on my uh on my iPad they asked brother and you can hear Brothers says have the seven Thunders which equals seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but yet are not yet known to us as the Thunders yet now it's hard to know what it's hard to understand what this no means because there's numerous questions in here no but look what he says they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about okay and this is a year and what five months 17 months after he said the seven Thunders aren't known yet they're going to give us rapturing Faith 17 months later he said the seven Thunders were about the revelation of the Seven Seals they wish to reveal the seven Thunders out of their voices and no one could make out what it was John knew what it was but he's forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel Hebrews of Revelation 10 7. and the seventh angel is a messenger to the seven Church ages see now church I wish you would have kept talking at that point do you you wish that dude yeah I wish you would have uh can you give a civil war program but when I read that I don't see him saying like oh they're gonna give us rapturing faith and you gotta you got to enter in that rapturing Faith through the seven Thunders I don't see him saying that okay remember Revelation 10 1-7 is history right seven Thunders have already sounded and then the church age book which I have quotes for brother says I read it through a couple times and then his daughter Rebecca Smith wrote a magazine article I think it was in 1990 and said she would read the church age book to him while they drove around the country and he would make comments and make Corrections and I think she said they did it five times all the way through that's a lot of reading now who's read the church age book five times don't raise your hands who's ready five times sister Rebecca said she read it through five times that's his daughter so brother man had to know what was in the book right he had to know it was in the church age book and so levale put the grammar on brother random sermons right levielle just took out all he he had he had all them typed out a sister it's on it's on the tapes a sister typed out the church ages and then levale took out all the duplicate stuff and he organized it and put it all together with good grammar brother Brown said LeBron said now this messenger of Malachi 4 Revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers how many hearts been turned to the apostolic fathers my heart has in every question I don't say oh uh what does uh what does my denomination say what does my grandpa say what does my grandma say I said what does the Bible say praise God that's how you know your heart's been turned back you go to the Bible for all your answers and number two what will the seven Church age messenger do he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so all right is that where I was going to stop I was going to stop about right there now in my past sermon let me say a couple more things here how do the Seven Seals turn our hearts back to the fathers so the Seven Seals do that because we can see we're under the force seal we have the Flying Eagle anointing and that helps us fly up Church into Heavenly places we Fly Above The Temptations of laodicea in other words you're not lukewarm you're on fire praise God Amen amen that's what that's the whole point you're an overcomer I thought your heart has turned back you believe the the prophet of this day brother random pointing us to the Bible and you believe the Bible revelations and it makes you spiritually on a higher plane than you used to be it makes you in a higher place than all the other churches praise God Amen it does and not to brag on ourselves or not to boast but because we've got thus saith the Lord it puts us on a higher plane than trinitarians right we're flying above the things of the world my trinitarian friends would go to church and my wife talked about it too when she hung around in the youth groups and those College youth groups they would talk about God and they'd go home and watch filthy movies dirty movies laugh and cuss and immorality but when we met Craig Booher and Dave Llewellyn and Simon Smith Hallelujah of course I knew my whole life but I met a new Simon after The Sea of they lived a real life praise God when I met Isaiah Brooks it was a different kind of person praise God that's why I told the Saints over there I never met a man like brother Isaiah Brooks talk of this message he was different than all the other preachers because all the other preachers were mainly motivated by what money and popularity yeah yeah and brother Brooks would stand there and rebuke us he rebuked the women for wearing uh uh I don't I don't know sexy clothes he sometimes he had brother Craig rebuke him for wearing high heels and everything like that Hallelujah I never heard that before I never heard a man preach like that but where do you find that you find that in the Bible praise God and all the other sins that men do and adultery and pornography I never heard a man preach like that it was God so that's how our hearts get turned we get the anointing of the Flying Eagle We Believe thus saith the Lord because we can find it in the Bible remember Church once again there's 31 thus saith the Lords in this last chapter 31. how many does the Catholic Church have how many does the Pentecost have zero how many does the Baptist have with Austin zero we've got 31 Church a line has roared Hallelujah the lion is roared we've heard the voice of Christ the book is open to us today praise God like I said they'll say I asked my pastor uh can uh this was a good time a good example I said pastor can I get a tattoo he said talk to my wife that was a bad answer but anyway she pointed me to Leviticus 19. that was a good answer and either fear of God I didn't get a tattoo but any other Church oh yeah I went to the chapel because Austin I said can I get a tattoo they said sure that's just old legalistic requirement they didn't even consult the Bible they didn't even look in the Bible right but we look in the Bible why because our hearts have been turned back right now because the Bible's open to us praise God the Bible's open we can see the truth of God like people go to the church today and say can I marry a third time can I marry a fourth time they'll be back of course can I'm a man can I become a woman of course just come to church where our name is transformation so we can have trans trans is in our name so we can have trans people here that's what they say but what does the Bible say all right brother I'm saying on anointed ones the end time he said look at these young boys they're letting their hair grow like girls they're turning into girls and look where we are today look very hard today so hair was what the first step in becoming a man for a woman and a man becoming a woman hair was the first step changing the clothes was the first step to give a woman pass right then you cut her hair and she acts like a man and then she wants to transition and get surgery to become a man it's the first step these things happen slowly like the Bible said they have sowed they planted two of the wind and they're reaping the Whirlwind but we sow to the spirit and church what do we reap eternal life Hallelujah in Jesus Christ Our Lord now you're all waiting for me to close I'm trying to close here by God's grace anything else I want to say the old questions yeah let me take questions this would be a great time for questions
