[0:01] so I said that's okay I don't have to
[0:02] hold the baby you don't have to do all
[0:03] these traditions of man you know it's
[0:05] just a a show it's just a tradition not
[0:06] a show it's a tradition so we dedicated
[0:09] him to the Lord so it was really
[0:10] wonderful say afterwards the fellowship
[0:13] and had a good time in the Lord so like
[0:15] to continue on tonight uh Jesus said be
[0:18] ye perfect so I like to look at part two
[0:20] of this how many enjoyed last week by
[0:21] God's grace I told Brother Simon you
[0:23] know with the adoption message I asked
[0:24] him to you know speak on that or the
[0:26] mount Transfiguration rather on Sunday
[0:28] night I thought it just would go in
[0:29] perfect
[0:30] because if you remember last week what's
[0:31] one of the definitions of perfect it's
[0:33] maturity right and what is being adopted
[0:36] maturity I thought I didn't even realize
[0:38] it it just flowed together perfectly so
[0:41] I was very thankful for that so let's
[0:44] read Matthew 548 let's read that
[0:46] together on three one two three be ye
[0:49] therefore perfect even as your father
[0:52] which is in heaven is perfect let's have
[0:54] one more word of prayer have if you have
[0:56] a need on your heart just raise your
[0:57] hand up to the Lord surely God sees our
[0:59] hands father God we just come to you
[1:00] with praise and thanksgiving oh Adonai
[1:02] oh elai god of Grace we call out your
[1:05] name Lord Jesus Christ Lord May us and
[1:08] our families be saved may you save these
[1:10] sick ones as well Lord Jesus we love you
[1:12] we need you tonight Lord speak through
[1:14] me speak through your people Lord God if
[1:16] there's gifts in operation Lord our
[1:18] minds are on that recently father use
[1:20] your gifts for your glory father just
[1:22] speak here tonight God may we be edified
[1:25] may we be strengthened may we drawn
[1:27] closer to you we ask it in Jesus Christ
[1:29] CH name and the Saints said amen God
[1:32] bless you as you're being seated praise
[1:41] God now I'll just briefly review just
[1:44] real briefly you know we looked at last
[1:45] week how um in this context Jesus
[1:48] speaking of of maturity um if you look
[1:51] at the context he's talking about how
[1:52] Christians should be able to love the
[1:54] unlovable Christians should be able to
[1:56] love their enemies how many did it this
[1:58] week anybody love their enemy this week
[2:00] maybe think about a little bit okay
[2:01] couple students amen I believe that by
[2:04] God's
[2:06] grace and so in one context you know
[2:09] this means maturity the word perfect
[2:11] means maturity in another context it
[2:13] means totally complete and forgiven
[2:17] right we saw that in Hebrews 10:14 in
[2:19] case you would you put that up there
[2:21] Hebrews 10:14 says for by one offering
[2:24] he hath perfected forever them that are
[2:28] Sanctified amen how many believe that
[2:30] scripture talks about you how many
[2:31] Sanctified ones out there amen that word
[2:35] is actually a different Greek word it's
[2:36] kind of close in its number and it's
[2:38] spelling but it it means actually to
[2:41] make perfect complete to carry through
[2:44] completely I'm already carried through
[2:46] Hallelujah he already carried me through
[2:49] amen I've it means to accomplish to
[2:51] finish he's already accomplished my
[2:53] salvation amen did he say it was
[2:55] finished church
[2:57] Hallelujah it it means bring bring to an
[3:00] end he has forever brought them to an
[3:03] end who are
[3:04] Sanctified in other words we know the
[3:06] end of the Bible Hallelujah we know the
[3:08] end of our destination our destination
[3:10] is with Christ in heaven Hallelujah it
[3:14] means to be found
[3:16] perfect it means to bring to the end
[3:19] goal proposed Hallelujah I've already
[3:22] reached the goal
[3:24] hallelujah amen My Soul Your Soul has
[3:27] already reached its goal Hallelujah
[3:30] that's right Hallelujah it means to
[3:32] bring to a
[3:33] fulfillment to be bring to a close it's
[3:37] already closed go like this it's already
[3:39] finished my soul's already got its place
[3:41] in heaven hallelujah amen I got a the
[3:43] Alp you waiting for me there hallelujah
[3:45] amen amen so that's the review there
[3:48] just real briefly we looked at other
[3:50] numerous scriptures about um looked out
[3:54] maturity and so forth now I want to get
[3:56] to some more verses the verses we didn't
[3:58] get to so case
[4:00] this word perfect also means it's in
[4:02] Hebrews 12 I'm sorry Hebrews
[4:04] 5:12 uh also means full age Jesus said
[4:08] be therefore perfect be of a full age
[4:11] don't be a baby amen don't be an
[4:13] immature Christian don't be a toddler
[4:14] Christian don't be a a first grade
[4:18] Christian be a full AG Christian right
[4:21] brother said you're not fresh recruits
[4:23] anymore right we're not fresh soldiers
[4:25] we've been in the battle a long time
[4:27] let's be mature praise God Amen Hebrews
[4:29] 5:12 says for when ye I'm sorry for when
[4:33] for the time you ought to be teachers
[4:35] you have need that one teach you again
[4:37] which be the first principles of the
[4:38] Oracles of God and are become such as
[4:41] have need of milk and not of strong meat
[4:43] now don't feel bad don't use this
[4:44] scripture to let the devil beat you up
[4:46] well you forgot this and you forgot that
[4:48] we all forget teachings I forget
[4:51] teachings right but let this be an
[4:54] encouragement that you know if someone
[4:55] asks you about something fresh you heard
[4:57] you be able to tell them right cuz just
[4:59] fresh on your heart there's times I got
[5:02] to go look up that like oh what was that
[5:03] again I forgot about that happens all
[5:05] the time but if somebody ask me
[5:07] something I recently preached I can tell
[5:08] them right
[5:09] away right so it means it means that
[5:13] we're not baby Christians like how do I
[5:14] get saved again how should I be
[5:17] baptized how am I forgiven again am I
[5:19] saved by my works or am I saved by grace
[5:21] I mean this is what it means this means
[5:23] some and remember he lists them later he
[5:25] lists these later in chapter six right
[5:27] remember uh the laying on of hands right
[5:31] there's different ones in there I don't
[5:32] have my Bible open to that one I just
[5:33] copied the the verses there on my
[5:35] computer but you remember there were six
[5:36] things that we should already know right
[5:39] the different baptisms different
[5:41] resurrections are there three
[5:43] resurrections four five or how many
[5:45] there's two resurrections the first
[5:47] resurrection and the last Resurrection
[5:48] right there's only two
[5:50] resurrections now verse 13 for everyone
[5:54] that uses milk is unskillful in the word
[5:56] of rightous for he's a bab now now we're
[5:59] going to get down to see who really is a
[6:00] mature Christian amen I think you should
[6:02] say Amen when I read this verse 14 I
[6:06] don't believe I have many baby
[6:07] Christians here unless you just got
[6:08] baptized recently right verse 14 but
[6:12] strong meat belongs to them who are of a
[6:14] full age who are
[6:16] perfect even those who by reason of use
[6:20] have their senses exercise to discern
[6:22] good and evil how many Saw evil trying
[6:24] to slip into your life this week right
[6:27] you're mature you're not a Bab baby
[6:29] babies would miss it right babies would
[6:32] miss it they're not exercised they're
[6:33] not strong enough to be able to push it
[6:36] out of the way but you're strong enough
[6:39] because you're a mature Christian praise
[6:41] God Amen so Jesus says or Paul says that
[6:45] strong me you can handle strong
[6:47] preaching because you're of a full age
[6:49] that's what the Saints told me on Sunday
[6:50] they said I never heard a sermon like
[6:52] that on the godhead I said that's strong
[6:53] preaching for that's that ain't no uh
[6:55] just God loves you in John 3:16 that's
[6:58] some deep preaching go going back before
[7:00] the foundation world when it was just
[7:01] the father and the son and the son was
[7:03] rejoicing before the Lord before the
[7:06] world was even founded amen and then
[7:08] don't don't don't leave yourself out of
[7:10] that you were in Christ amen you were
[7:13] there brother said in his thoughts
[7:15] Hallelujah you were chosen in Christ so
[7:18] it all even it go even it goes back that
[7:20] far you were there
[7:21] Hallelujah see that's deep preaching
[7:24] some people can't handle that but then
[7:26] if you know that now what does it mean I
[7:28] was in Christ why better in Christ's
[7:29] word then right
[7:31] now I better line up my life with the
[7:34] word of Christ and that's what we do in
[7:35] this church amen
[7:37] hallelujah now how many saw some good
[7:40] slipping into your life this week amen
[7:41] or should should I say growing in your
[7:43] life right amen I should say growing not
[7:46] slipping it's sin that tries to slip in
[7:48] right but it's Holiness that is grow or
[7:52] grown into your life right it's it's
[7:55] it's it's uh what's the gardening word
[7:57] it's cultivated into your life right you
[7:59] slowly you weed out the bad things and
[8:02] now you can grow Stronger by God's grace

[8:53] this week to do that the Bible said be
[8:55] joyful amen remember God can trust you
[8:57] with that amen he knew you wouldn't fall
[9:00] praise God and if you did fall you got
[9:02] Grace to try it again knowing the next
[9:04] time you won't fall praise God cuz we
[9:07] all fall we all make mistakes verse
[9:09] three knowing this that the trying of
[9:12] your faith worketh or produces patience

[9:18] trial amen that's why we got to preach
[9:19] it more I got to preach it more you can
[9:21] be joyful in any trial because I know

[9:31] going to enjoy seeing the Saints more if
[9:32] I can just get through this trial praise
[9:34] God amen
[9:36] amen verse four but let patience have
[9:39] her perfect work see that's that
[9:40] feminine attribute interesting that
[9:42] Christ Christ is the feminine right and
[9:44] God is like the
[9:46] masculine the submissive part let
[9:49] patience have her perfect work that ye
[9:51] may be perfect and entire that means
[9:54] mature see patience will produce
[9:58] maturity in you amen so so so as we come

[10:31] the world Hallelujah I don't need
[10:32] anything in the world I've got God's
[10:34] promise hallelujah amen other words I've
[10:36] got patience and like I preached before
[10:38] if I got patience I don't need anything
[10:41] else because I'm not trusting in what my
[10:43] eyes see I'm not trusting in what my
[10:45] mind thinks I've got patience I can wait
[10:47] on God hallelujah amen well said that's
[10:51] what you need he said the first thing
[10:52] you need is patience with God he said
[10:54] Noah had lots of patience 120 years and
[10:58] think about that only the family came in
[11:00] that would be like if everybody here
[11:01] left to a different church and the only
[11:03] people that got saved in AAR was my
[11:05] family we're pretty close we got 10
[11:07] people right he had eight we're we're
[11:09] not too far you but that that's what
[11:12] that would be like and and and think
[11:14] about that service after service I just
[11:15] preached in Mali come on brother come
[11:17] you encourage me I'll encourage you come
[11:19] on Haven just be encouraged pretty soon
[11:21] just keep being patient right and that
[11:24] was it and I have to keep encouraging my
[11:26] family and me to be patient for a
[11:28] hundred 20 not days years 120 years amen
[11:34] patience will
[11:36] produce maturity and the church said
[11:39] amen hallelujah amen the p and the
[11:42] preacher said amen verse five if any of
[11:45] you lack wisdom let him ask God that
[11:48] give it to all men liberally so if you
[11:50] don't understand something if you don't
[11:51] have wisdom well in most cases it's
[11:53] because you haven't
[11:55] asked now there could be times God is
[11:57] withholding something from you in order
[11:58] to test you he doesn't tell us all
[12:00] things right right he doesn't answer all
[12:03] of our prayers but I'll tell you this if
[12:05] you ask for wisdom to make it through
[12:07] you know God's going to give you that by
[12:08] God's grace God don't want any of us to
[12:11] fall right and upgrade it's not so God
[12:14] is that a beautiful prise God's not
[12:16] going to operate you or rebuke you for
[12:18] asking for wisdom he's going to give it
[12:20] abundantly amen hallelujah you know
[12:23] God's not going to send the rebuke
[12:25] Spirit back like oh I failed God when
[12:27] you were saying God just give me wisdom
[12:28] it's like Solomon remember Solomon God
[12:30] said because you asked for wisdom
[12:33] because you ask for understanding and
[12:34] not for riches and women and a long life
[12:36] because you ask for that I'm giving you
[12:38] what you ask for and everything else
[12:40] hallelujah amen amen God loved that he
[12:43] loved that desire that Solomon just
[12:46] wanted wisdom to judge the people amen
[12:50] hallelujah it shall be given him it
[12:53] shall everybody say shall shall not
[12:56] might it shall be given in us if we ask
[12:59] for wisdom amen verse six but let him
[13:02] ask in faith remember faith is a
[13:04] substance of what you hope for right
[13:07] I've got a substance of what I'm hoping
[13:09] for I've got a reality that there's
[13:11] wisdom out there for me I know God's
[13:12] going to give me wisdom I've got faith
[13:14] hallelujah amen
[13:16] amen nothing wavering for he that
[13:19] wavereth is like a wave of the sea
[13:21] driven with the wind and tossed all
[13:24] right Hallelujah go down to verse 17 so
[13:27] let patience have her perfect work
[13:29] there's perfect is
[13:30] mature patience is producing maturity in
[13:33] our lives verse 17 every good gift and
[13:37] perfect gift is from above and cometh
[13:40] down from the Father of Lights with whom
[13:42] is no variable e neither shadow of
[13:45] turning now that perfect is the one like
[13:47] we're perfect by the blood right because
[13:51] God gives perfect gifts amen God gives
[13:53] complete gifts
[13:55] Hallelujah so that that's referring to
[13:57] the Perfection of God God he gives you
[13:59] the best he finishes it when he gives
[14:01] you a gift it's a wonderful gift
[14:03] hallelujah amen verse 25 but who so
[14:06] lookth in the perfect law of Liberty now
[14:09] there it again there's a again perfect
[14:11] like a finishing or accomplishing the
[14:14] accomplish the Finish law of Liberty and
[14:16] continue therein he being not a
[14:18] forgetful hearer but a doer of the work
[14:20] this man shall be blessed in his deed
[14:22] James 3 verse two qua you're doing real
[14:24] good tonight got a lot of I should have
[14:26] have warned you ahead of time you got a
[14:27] big work tonight here got a heavy load
[14:29] these are all the same word be therefore
[14:32] perfect for in many things we offend all
[14:35] If any man offend not in word the same
[14:36] as a perfect man that means mature of
[14:39] course right you can make it through a
[14:41] day without offending somebody
[14:43] Hallelujah you're mature that
[14:45] day and able also to Bridle the whole
[14:48] body look at that if you can control
[14:50] your mouth you can control your whole
[14:52] body Hallelujah remember because there's
[14:55] power of life and death in your mouth
[14:58] Hallelujah right we start saying I'm
[14:59] tired or I'm bored or I I need this or I
[15:02] got to have that what does it do the
[15:03] body just gives it a lot easier when we
[15:06] can say God have mercy if we can cry out
[15:08] say God keep me from Evil keep me from
[15:10] this don't you think God's going to
[15:11] answer praise God amen glory let me read
[15:16] this quote now that's the 17 verses
[15:19] where that word perfect Jesus used was
[15:21] in the Bible the New Testament so we're
[15:23] we finish that so everybody say amen
[15:25] amen so be it I believe it so see
[15:28] there's two definitions there's either
[15:30] Perfection through the blood God
[15:31] finishes a work it's all complete
[15:34] everything's fulfilled or it's I'm
[15:36] becoming more mature in
[15:38] Christ in that context Jesus wants us
[15:41] mature against those who hate us our
[15:43] enemies right
[15:45] amen now let me read this quote it's
[15:48] from 1950 testimony brother manam said
[15:51] not as we are good but M there's none
[15:54] good but God Amen he says but God is is
[15:58] in the people what makes them
[16:02] good marks the perfect man it's God in
[16:07] you that makes it perfect see and then
[16:10] he quotes Matthew 548 or 458 sorry be ye
[16:14] therefore perfect even as your father in
[16:16] Heaven is perfect see be therefore
[16:18] perfect how can you be perfect not in
[16:21] yourself but in him amen so at your soul
[16:25] look at your soul Hallelujah your soul
[16:28] is
[16:29] your soul is perfect before
[16:32] God God don't look at you then he looks
[16:35] at him or Jesus and you say well I'm in
[16:40] him hallelujah how many how many are in
[16:41] Christ tonight amen the Bible said If
[16:44] any man be in Christ If any man be in
[16:47] the word If any man be anointed by the
[16:50] Holy Ghost the Bible said he's a new
[16:52] creature how you living a new life amen
[16:54] Austin just text me tonight he said I'm
[16:56] so glad Lena and I have lived such a new
[16:58] life he said said so it's just like a
[16:59] new life see that's how you know you're
[17:01] in Christ your old life has passed away
[17:03] behold All Things become new hallelujah
[17:06] amen
[17:08] amen the old life is gone Behold a new
[17:12] life has begun
[17:16] Amen brother said how do you get into
[17:18] him I like how he goes to the scripture
[17:20] 1 Corinthians 12:13 in Cas you how do
[17:23] you get to him by one Spirit we're all
[17:25] baptized into one body and then you're
[17:27] in him and when you're baptized by the
[17:29] Holy Spirit into the body is that true
[17:31] and the church said amen amen yes how do
[17:34] you get in him you're perfect in him how
[17:38] do you get in him the spirit gets in you
[17:41] hallelujah
[17:43] amen new quote I'm going to a different
[17:45] quote brother says God has already
[17:47] glorified his
[17:52] church he says those who he is Justified
[17:54] he's also glorified put up um Romans
[17:58] 8:30 H Romans
[18:00] 8:30 now brother R's going to use this
[18:02] scripture Romans 8:30 and then he's
[18:04] going to reference uh Matthew 548 be
[18:07] therefore perfect look what he does he
[18:10] puts these and then I'm going to give
[18:11] you another verse Romans 81 he puts all
[18:13] these together to show how you're
[18:15] perfect you're now he's using the he's
[18:17] using Hebrews 10 now you're perfect by
[18:20] the blood I'm talking about that perfect
[18:23] I'm not talking about mature anymore I'm

[19:00] take a liar a bluff a line with no teeth
[19:03] just roaring let's not take a bluff
[19:04] let's not take a squatter let's take an
[19:06] almighty God who never had a beginning
[19:09] never had an ending and who died for our
[19:11] sins who chose us in Christ before the
[19:13] foundation of the world let's choose a
[19:15] God that loves us hallelujah amen while
[19:17] you are yet a sinner Christ died for you
[19:20] the righteous for the unrighteous amen
[19:22] let's choose to agree with what Christ
[19:24] says
[19:25] hallelujah Romans 8:30 moreover whom he
[19:28] did predestinate that he also called and
[19:30] whom he called then he also Justified
[19:32] and then he also Justified that he also
[19:36] glorified if you are Justified which
[19:38] means forgiven of your sins saved the
[19:40] first step of the three works of Grace
[19:43] the Bible says you are already glorified
[19:46] that means you've got a glorified body
[19:48] already amen you look down at yourself I
[19:51] don't see much Glory about me my elbow
[19:54] so hurts although I'm still claiming my
[19:56] healing by God's grace I don't see my
[19:58] much Glory here but that's not what he's
[20:00] talking about he's talking about a
[20:02] glorified condition he's talking about a
[20:05] glorified body an eternal Tabernacle
[20:08] waiting for you in the heavens
[20:09] Hallelujah if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[20:11] his armed you have a house Eternal
[20:13] already waiting
[20:16] Hallelujah that's how you're glorified
[20:18] I've already got a glorified body I've
[20:20] already got a home a vacation home I go
[20:22] to if I pass from this world
[20:24] hallelujah
[20:27] amen
[20:28] see B says if you're justified in Christ
[20:32] you're glorified in Christ already as
[20:35] far as God is concerned how many care
[20:36] what God's concerned about amen Jesus
[20:39] said be therefore perfect even as your
[20:41] father in Heaven is perfect how could
[20:43] you ever be perfect brother Malachi but
[20:46] in the sight of Christ tonight every
[20:48] born again Christian is perfect amen I'm
[20:51] just as perfect in God as Christ was you
[20:54] are every other believer it's not my
[20:57] holiness it's his Holiness
[21:00] amen how many like that quote amen then
[21:03] he quotes 1 Corinthians 12:13 and then
[21:05] go to Romans 81 honey you ought to have
[21:07] this me some of us ought to have this
[21:09] memorized by now
[21:11] therefore there is no condemnation to
[21:14] them that are in Christ Jesus that walk
[21:17] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[21:19] and a man that's in Christ Jesus walks
[21:22] after spiritual things Hallelujah that's
[21:25] why you're here tonight you're not here
[21:27] to get a new car tonight tonight you're
[21:28] not here to get a a new house you're not

[21:40] is a new body Hallelujah am that Eternal
[21:43] Tabernacle Hallelujah that house made
[21:46] Eternal in the heavens praise God amen
[21:50] amen okay so those are the verses think
[21:52] of that Matthew 5:48 be therefore
[21:55] perfect Romans 8:30 you're if you're
[21:57] just ified you're already glorified and
[21:59] then Romans 81 there's no condemnation
[22:03] to them that are in Christ Jesus amen
[22:05] you see brother's doing the same thing
[22:06] I'm doing I'm doing the same thing here
[22:07] we're trying to put all the scriptures
[22:08] together to show you that you are saved
[22:11] you're already perfect in heaven now
[22:13] let's focus since we know that's true
[22:15] let's rejoice in that and now let's let
[22:17] God mature us here on this Earth praise
[22:19] God we're already perfect in the
[22:22] spiritual manner now let's be

[23:04] maturity remember what Jesus said Jesus
[23:06] said you cannot be my disciple unless
[23:07] you take your cross daily and follow me
[23:10] right I mentioned that repeatedly I'm
[23:13] going to keep mentioning that because
[23:15] that's the key to maturity brother Jesse
[23:17] how can I be mature take up your cross
[23:19] daily and follow him amen find the
[23:22] burden find God's purpose for your life
[23:24] crucify the lust of your flesh and the
[23:27] affections thereof walk in the spirit if
[23:29] you're walk in the spirit you're
[23:30] carrying a cross hallelujah amen that
[23:32] just struck me amen I didn't realize
[23:34] that if you're walking anointed by the
[23:36] Holy Spirit you're carrying a burden

[24:09] goat will say and all his sins were
[24:11] transferred to the goat right and then
[24:13] he left totally forgiven except the Old
[24:15] Testament was partial forgiveness right
[24:17] but we understand he was forgiven now
[24:19] brother said but this man after one time
[24:23] offering up I'm sorry but Jesus after
[24:25] one time offering up his blood sat down
[24:28] at the right hand of God and the Majesty
[24:30] on high and has perfected forever every

[25:04] perfect I can't be perfect but he said
[25:08] you can't be perfect but God doesn't
[25:10] look at us when we are born again in the
[25:12] body of Christ God looks at Christ
[25:15] Christ took my place Christ took your
[25:17] place he's the one that's perfect and we
[25:20] stand in him perfected tonight before
[25:22] God the Father through the offering of

[26:22] we're if we're talking about
[26:25] maturity then I want to bring in a
[26:27] option okay and so here's how I taught
[26:29] it over the years even when Cam and
[26:31] Simon were coming to my church and even
[26:32] when uh the albian saints were coming
[26:35] this is how I've always tght adoption
[26:36] through the word of God okay so sister Z
[26:39] you want to read Romans
[26:41] 8:15 for ye have not
[26:49] rece amen now look this is the same
[26:52] chapter where they said there's no

[27:34] was a dad figure that you love the most
[27:36] that's when we have the spirit of
[27:38] adoption that's what we do what do you
[27:40] do when you're adopted you cry out to
[27:41] your dad hallelujah amen want to talk to
[27:43] your parents I'm not an orphan I'm a
[27:46] child hallelujah amen I'm not forsaken I
[27:49] never was forsaken Hallelujah am I'm
[27:52] adopted I've got the spirit of adoption
[27:54] which there's only one Spirit that's the
[27:56] Holy Spirit praise God go amen I've
[27:59] already got it I've got the spirit of
[28:01] adoption uh and then Romans 8:23
[28:06] sister
[28:18] only thank you sister same chapter same
[28:21] man same Holy Ghost he says you've got
[28:24] the spirit of God but I'm waiting for
[28:26] adoption
[28:28] uh Paul can you help me out here sure he
[28:30] gives us other verses so the Holy Ghost
[28:34] is the the spirit of adoption but
[28:36] adoption is not finalized until you get
[28:39] a new
[28:40] body so that's what I've always taught
[28:43] adoption starts when you're born again
[28:45] it finishes when you get a new body
[28:48] Hallelujah see we are waiting for oh I
[28:52] got the spirit of it but I'm waiting for
[28:53] it yes that's exactly right I got the
[28:57] spirit of adoption and then when I
[28:58] finally get that Holy body then I'm
[29:00] fully adopted praise God that's what the
[29:03] Bible says hallelujah amen I love it
[29:08] Romans 9:4 who did I say was that haven
[29:10] yeah hen there go go ahead honey are
[29:20] Israelites and Promises thank you H now
[29:24] this is speaking of Israel adopted as
[29:27] uh the the the child of God that's in
[29:30] Exodus 4:22 we're not going to read it
[29:31] but the Bible said Israel is my son even
[29:33] my firstborn son so Israel was like uh
[29:37] remember the remember uh Ezekiel
[29:39] 16 God said he found Israel now this is
[29:43] the allegory he found Israel lying in a
[29:45] pool of blood remember
[29:47] that it she was a little girl lying in a
[29:50] pool of blood God said I picked her up
[29:53] cleaned her off and fed her and she grew
[29:55] into this beautiful woman then I married
[29:56] her that's what what God said about
[29:58] Israel that's adoption right orphan
[30:02] child dying it's just like the Good
[30:04] Samaritan amen hallelujah amen
[30:06] hallelujah amen God rescues us God Saves
[30:09] us God brings us back to life hallelujah
[30:12] amen we should have been dead but God
[30:14] came around and rescued Our Lives amen
[30:17] that's called Deliverance that's called
[30:19] salvation and Jehovah is our Salvation
[30:21] Jesus
[30:22] hallelujah
[30:25] amen Okay so the to the law the law
[30:29] pertained the adoption they were adopted
[30:31] like that the little girl was adopted
[30:32] cleaned up and then grew up to be this
[30:34] beautiful bride remember God put
[30:37] earrings on her remember that in the Old
[30:39] Testament because that was the custom of
[30:41] those
[30:42] days but we don't know that there's any
[30:44] holes or blood in those earrings we just
[30:46] said
[30:47] earrings right that's Ezekiel 16 see
[30:49] those scriptures don't scare me because
[30:51] I know what the rest of the Bible says
[30:53] amen hallelujah God said don't cut
[30:55] yourself don't mark yourself well they
[30:57] got earrings on well it's either an Old
[30:59] Testament custom that God had mercy on
[31:01] and winked at or they didn't put holes
[31:03] in their ears I tend to believe they
[31:06] didn't put holes in theirs but I'm going
[31:08] to stay on God's side Hallelujah I'm not
[31:10] going to be like the world Hallelujah
[31:13] now Galatians 45 let's see who had that
[31:16] one was it
[31:18] Caris to redeem them
[31:24] that receive the ad all
[31:28] right so we were under the law of sin
[31:31] and death right or even this might this
[31:33] actually speaking of the Jews the Jews
[31:34] were under the law but now they're under
[31:36] grace and they are adopted by the Holy
[31:39] Spirit like Paul said in Romans 8 you
[31:41] got the spirit of adoption when the
[31:42] spirit of Jesus Christ comes in you the
[31:44] church said am amen all
[31:49] right now there's only one more verse
[31:51] that says adoption in the entire New
[31:54] Testament okay L at Ephesians 1 15
[31:58] having predestinated us unto the
[32:00] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[32:02] himself according to the good pleasure
[32:04] of this will amen that's it we're
[32:07] predestinated to adoption so what Paul
[32:10] say when you get the Holy Ghost now you
[32:12] got the spirit of adoption then when you
[32:14] get a new body now I am adopted amen
[32:16] amen hallelujah amen make sense
[32:20] Hallelujah now here's what I found as I
[32:22] studyed I shared this with our brother
[32:23] Simon too brother Ram never preached
[32:26] hear ye him after
[32:28] 1962 so it wasn't a it wasn't a topic he
[32:31] even addressed after 1962 now to me that
[32:34] shows he grew in some Revelation you
[32:37] know so that's where I look at that okay
[32:40] now I'm talking about maturity so if you
[32:43] have the Holy Ghost you're already
[32:45] adopted
[32:46] spiritually and you're fully adopted
[32:48] your adoption is finalized when you get
[32:51] a new body
[32:52] amen how many believe the Bible tonight
[32:55] amen amen hallelujah
[32:59] now what's interesting is I when I
[33:01] preach it over there I remember I
[33:02] preached it over in that Sanctuary over
[33:03] there with the albian Saints here I said
[33:05] this I said uh now I said this there
[33:08] could be an adoption moment when you're
[33:11] in already born again where God says
[33:13] hear ye him it's easy to understand for
[33:15] a preacher but it's a little more
[33:17] challenging to understand for the
[33:18] housewife or the
[33:20] sister right the only way I thought it
[33:23] is well now uh you know now God's really
[33:27] going to speak through the mother to the
[33:28] children that could
[33:30] be but based upon the scriptures I've
[33:33] read it looks more just more looks more
[33:35] simple than
[33:36] that right it just looks like you get
[33:39] the spirit of adoption you just mature
[33:40] mature after you got the Holy Ghost and
[33:42] then we get new body I'm fully adopted
[33:44] now nobody can take me out this family
[33:46] now praise God hallelujah I got the body
[33:49] of the family I got a Smith body or I
[33:52] got a sarpong body or I got a Lee body
[33:54] whatever you know I fit the family mold
[33:57] praise God
[33:59] Amen everybody with me
[34:03] amen all right so
[34:06] um that's that's where I can see that in
[34:08] the scripture I love adoption by God's
[34:10] grace I I love
[34:12] it and uh I like to say this too here um
[34:16] you know what it all boils down to is
[34:19] that we must constantly mature as
[34:22] Christians which means confessing our
[34:25] sins every day taking up our cross
[34:27] following Jesus
[34:29] am and so Simon and I both agreed you
[34:33] know as long as we're confessing our
[34:36] sins and wanting more of God we're going
[34:38] to be adopted praise God am the main
[34:40] thing is to hunger and thirst after
[34:42] righteousness and you and I shall be
[34:44] filled Hallelujah you're once filled in
[34:47] your soul and then the rest of your days
[34:49] you can try to keep your mind filled
[34:51] with the spirit of God hallelujah amen
[34:54] amen that's exactly right there's only
[34:56] one sealing to the day of redemption
[34:58] you're not sealed one out of 10 times to
[35:00] the day of redemption you are sealed one
[35:02] time to the day of redemption praise God
[35:05] the refilling happen in the mind I need
[35:08] to transform mind Hallelujah I need to
[35:10] get my mind off the problems I need to
[35:11] get my mind off politics I need to get
[35:13] my mind off fearful things I need to get
[35:15] my mind off of pleasurable things I need
[35:17] my mind transformed I need to get my
[35:19] mind back on the word of God I need my
[35:21] mind on fire hallelujah amen
[35:25] hallelujah
[35:27] that's a refilling that we need praise
[35:29] God
[35:31] Amen it's exactly
[35:34] right remember the maturity I preached
[35:36] on this a couple months ago P Romans 52
[35:39] H Romans 52 we read two to 2 to 5 then I
[35:43] want to show some quotes here by God's
[35:44] grace I think itd be helpful
[35:53] here Romans 52 remember this this was
[35:57] this is the process of developing
[36:00] Christlike
[36:02] maturity and it ties in exactly with
[36:05] with what we read in James chapter 1 we
[36:07] should count it all joy when we fall
[36:10] into tribulations because tribulation
[36:12] will work patience amen and when we have
[36:15] patience we don't need anything else
[36:17] amen right when we got God's word when
[36:20] we're waiting on God when we're trusting
[36:22] in God we don't need anything else
[36:25] amen Romans 52 by whom also we have
[36:29] access by faith into this grace wherein
[36:31] we stand and rejoice in Hope of the
[36:33] glory of God and not only so but we
[36:36] glory in Tribulation also knowing that
[36:38] tribulation Works
[36:41] patience and patience experience now
[36:44] that word experience means character and
[36:47] that means of course mature
[36:51] character so when you go through your
[36:53] tribulations you'll be more patient
[36:55] afterwards and then after your paay sh
[36:57] you'll have more character like Christ
[37:01] you'll have
[37:03] maturity how many know you're not going
[37:04] to get a big break in trials and tests
[37:06] how many know that you don't get too big
[37:09] of a break Hallelujah remember that one
[37:11] time the longest break I've seen sister
[37:13] is remember that 10 years that King ASA
[37:14] remember I preached on that 10 years of
[37:16] Peace that's the longest break I've ever
[37:18] seen can somebody help me oh there might
[37:21] be one in judges where they had 40 Years
[37:23] of peace or something that's right okay
[37:25] I could be wrong with that don't callot
[37:26] me
[37:27] 10 it could be 40 years I think Israel
[37:30] had peace and were not
[37:32] enslaves somebody share that after
[37:35] service okay somebody search their
[37:36] Bibles look up 40
[37:38] years so what I'm saying is
[37:42] that we can trust that God won't let us
[37:45] get complacent that's what I want to say
[37:46] amen God won't let you get complacent
[37:48] where you're backslide and that's what
[37:50] that's how many how many have that
[37:51] desire your desire is God don't let me
[37:53] get so complacent so I backslide I want
[37:56] to be more mature
[37:58] praise I don't want to be a baby and
[38:01] then someone's got to teach me the
[38:02] gospel all over again that's the last
[38:04] thing I want to be amen is a baby what a
[38:07] baby we love babies but spiritual babies
[38:10] we don't like so
[38:12] much whining crying complaining all the
[38:15] time why why is it got to happen to me
[38:17] we don't like spiritual babies so
[38:19] much because we've all been there before
[38:22] right and we are embarrassed of our our
[38:23] child our our our uh immat
[38:27] our childish ways I'll say that our lack
[38:30] of faith our lack of prayer we should
[38:32] have prayed for wisdom because God just
[38:35] pours it out on us amen you can come to
[38:37] a service and you get a service load of
[38:39] wisdom if you just ask God for it praise
[38:41] God amen amen hallelujah the trouble is
[38:44] we don't ask God enough for it that's
[38:46] the
[38:48] trouble all right so tribulation Works
[38:53] patience patience Works experience which
[38:54] means character which is the same as
[38:56] maturity and character produces hope an
[39:01] expected
[39:02] end and hope does not get ashamed we're
[39:05] not ashamed of the gospel because the
[39:06] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[39:08] by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[39:11] Church said amen all right now back to
[39:14] the I want to get down to the statute
[39:15] perfect man SOA can you switch over
[39:18] here this is how I've always taught it
[39:20] and it just be a good review for us here
[39:22] by God's
[39:24] grace so here are some quotes for
[39:26] tonight this is part two Jesus said be
[39:28] therefore perfect okay
[39:31] now i' I've always understood from
[39:33] Brother Bam's teachings and the the
[39:35] Bible that the sealing of the Holy Ghost
[39:37] in the soul comes after all the virtues
[39:40] are already in a person's character
[39:43] that's how I've always taught it okay
[39:45] and that's how I continue to teach it
[39:46] because of these quotes So This is my
[39:50] understanding and you know brother Simon
[39:52] and I different brother Simon believes
[39:53] you get the Holy Ghost here at in the
[39:55] soul and then you build up with there
[39:57] and then that I think represents the
[39:58] Rapture if I'm not mistaken or something
[40:00] like that but he and I were talking
[40:03] about so this is the way I've always
[40:05] thought this how I wrote it in my book
[40:07] this is how I understand it when you are
[40:09] Justified now you have faith you're
[40:12] saved okay you get Sanctified as God
[40:15] adds to your your character he adds
[40:17] virtue he adds knowledge Temperance
[40:19] patience God is brother kindness and
[40:21] then you're born again this and this is
[40:24] the sphere of adoption right there
[40:27] all right so that that's how I
[40:28] understand that now what's this we we
[40:31] don't know brother Ram didn't explain it
[40:33] really thoroughly if you just go read
[40:35] second Peter 1 this is not in here
[40:37] because really this is the same as
[40:40] that because the Bible said add to
[40:42] brotherly kindness charity which is love
[40:45] and what is love God is love what is God
[40:47] the Holy Ghost okay so I'm not sure why
[40:50] brother taught that he was still growing
[40:52] remember he put this out in 1962 he got
[40:54] the revelation of the Holy Ghost the
[40:56] next year all right and he never went
[40:58] back and preached this again so God had
[41:00] him preach on other things like thank
[41:02] God marriage and divorce Hallelujah lots
[41:04] of Seven Seals thank God we sure needed
[41:06] that the token amen we just needed all
[41:08] these God's only provided place to
[41:10] worship hallelujah amen okay so when you
[41:13] get that when God fills you with the
[41:16] Holy Ghost in your soul your soul is
[41:17] sealed now you got the spirit of
[41:19] adoption amen amen okay and now God will
[41:23] mature you through your life
[41:26] right and then when you get your new
[41:28] body now you can say I'm adopted
[41:30] completely amen all right and I got
[41:34] scripture to back it all up like you
[41:35] just read Hallelujah all right now
[41:38] here's the quotes that that proves to
[41:40] this brother Jesse did you make that up
[41:42] no I did not I did
[41:44] not brother R says then Peter says here
[41:47] first seven things Faith virtue see come
[41:49] up knowledge Temperance patience godess
[41:51] Brotherly Love adly kindness and then
[41:54] the love of God the Holy Ghost Christ in
[41:56] the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon
[41:58] you in the true baptism of the Holy
[42:00] Ghost and you got all these virtues
[42:02] sealed in
[42:03] you everybody see that then it's a
[42:08] process the love of God is the Holy
[42:10] Ghost the Holy Ghost is Christ in you in
[42:13] the person of the baptism of the Holy
[42:14] Ghost and then all these virtues not a s
[42:17] p virtues are sealed in you now look the
[42:21] word sealed Ephesians 4:30 right you're
[42:24] sealed to the day of redemption amen
[42:26] right all right that's there's not just
[42:28] one oh brother Jesse there's just one no
[42:30] there's more than one here's number two
[42:33] when a man possesses these kind of
[42:34] things then the Holy Ghost comes upon
[42:37] him no matter you might speak with
[42:38] tongues you might impersonate any gift
[42:40] God's Got You might do that but until
[42:42] these virtues here go into you you're
[42:44] still off the real true foundation of
[42:46] Faith but when those these virtues grow
[42:48] in and you add it to that then you are a
[42:51] living Monument amen hallelujah so you
[42:55] first that's two quotes first you
[42:57] possess all the attributes then the Holy
[42:59] Ghost seals youen brother Jess say there
[43:02] only two quotes well there's more than
[43:03] two here's the third one add to your
[43:06] faith virtue virtue knowledge Temperance
[43:08] patience Godly godl brotherly kindness
[43:11] to your brother love the Holy Spirit and
[43:14] Christ will come amen because just
[43:17] beneath him the holy spirit is to
[43:18] manifest Jesus Christ in the church to
[43:20] manifest those virtues so see you out of
[43:22] all those anointings and then Christ
[43:25] comes how many glad he comes
[43:27] amen Church the answer is always this I
[43:29] need more of
[43:31] God no matter where you are
[43:33] justification satification baptism Holy
[43:35] Ghost we need all we always need my
[43:37] always answer is get more of God

[43:45] formula Hallelujah repent of your sins
[43:48] and draw night to God God will draw
[43:49] night to you amen well J there only
[43:52] three Quotes no there's more than three
[43:54] quotes number four this is the uh the
[43:58] night after he preached the stat perfect
[44:00] man the Lord bless you brother Neville
[44:02] so happy to be back in church tonight
[44:03] just a teeny bit horse that's what I say
[44:05] every Thursday and Monday kind of a long
[44:07] message this morning I'm sure happy I it
[44:09] was here though and enjoyed it myself
[44:11] bringing it and I do hope you enjoy
[44:12] hearing it that's what I say on Monday I
[44:14] hope the church enjoyed the sermon don't
[44:16] forget now always remember that these
[44:18] are the things that build the servant of
[44:20] Christ how many want to be servants out
[44:21] there see Faith first then virtue and
[44:26] now remember the Holy Spirit cannot cap
[44:29] the building until these things are
[44:31] operating by the spirit no matter what
[44:34] you do see those are the things that
[44:35] builds the body of Christ see those
[44:38] things is there only four brother Jesse
[44:40] no there's more than four now don't
[44:42] forget that that here it is is first is
[44:44] your faith virtue now so forth is to be
[44:46] added in until the complete stature of
[44:49] Christ is made manifest then the Holy
[44:51] Spirit comes upon it and seals it into
[44:54] one body Hallelujah there's the word
[44:56] word sealed sealed to the day of your
[44:58] Redemption praise
[45:00] God oh am I wearing you out Church all
[45:05] right hoping for a few more
[45:08] amens these things must be therefore
[45:10] Jesus said by their fruits they known
[45:12] see fruit you cannot bear fruit without
[45:14] these things to bear in you and then
[45:17] when all this takes place of the
[45:18] worldliness and ungodliness and so forth
[45:21] that all the belief has cast out that
[45:22] all the things of the world has passed
[45:23] away that there's nothing but a new
[45:25] creature in Christ and then Ephesians
[45:27] 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God
[45:29] whereby you're sealed to the day of your
[45:31] Redemption so sealed sealed same
[45:34] scripture seal in the kingdom of God now
[45:36] don't forget that keep that mind now
[45:38] takes these things first then the
[45:42] ceiling is the Holy Spirit the cap that
[45:44] seals us into the body praise God it
[45:47] cannot be any more clear as far as my
[45:48] humble opinion is there more than five
[45:50] brother Jesse there more than
[45:53] five and now as in the individuals these
[45:56] virtues and things our knowledge and
[45:57] Temperance is added to our faith then
[46:00] when the Capstone comes the Holy Spirit
[46:02] cements it together Hallelujah there is
[46:04] the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's
[46:06] why it's so short today amen that's why
[46:08] people last in message church is so
[46:10] short they only stay here for a few
[46:12] years right or let me say like this they
[46:14] only stay for a few
[46:16] decades I was telling let me just share
[46:18] this again I don't know if I
[46:20] should you know we've had people that we
[46:23] thought were seal with the Holy Ghost
[46:24] come to this church and Lead
[46:26] we have down at Junction City we have
[46:28] all these young mothers and young
[46:29] sisters just wonder if they got the holy
[46:31] ghost or not and I told them on Sunday I
[46:33] said it can be so simple as you sitting
[46:36] by a beach reading your Bible and the
[46:39] Holy Ghost falls on you and you start
[46:41] crying and worshiping the Lord like my
[46:42] wife got the holy ghost or it could be
[46:45] so simple you're in a Sunday morning
[46:47] service listening to the preacher and
[46:49] you just stand up and raise up your
[46:50] hands and you see some Vision in your
[46:51] mind or whatever I saw and you start
[46:53] weeping and crying say praise God and
[46:54] you walk out there feeling like like you
[46:56] love everybody it can be that simple and
[46:59] I told him this there's my 45 minutes
[47:01] okay
[47:04] I'm and I said don't over complicate it
[47:07] look for a time when you the Holy Ghost
[47:08] fell on you and you saw and people could
[47:11] have saw it and heard it I said there
[47:13] there's probably people walking by
[47:14] Christen maybe at the at the beach that
[47:16] maybe maybe no one is around but if
[47:17] somebody would have been around someone
[47:19] would have said something's wrong with
[47:20] her I can see her crying I can hear her
[47:22] crying something is what's wrong with
[47:24] her did her boyfriend hurt her feelings
[47:27] oh no he's a good
[47:28] [Applause]
[47:30] man she
[47:32] laugh but see you could have saw and
[47:34] heard definitely at church when I got
[47:36] the Holy Ghost you would saw me and
[47:37] heard me definitely right hallelujah
[47:41] amen and I knew something happened
[47:43] something
[47:44] happened I love I was in love with God
[47:46] more I just wanted to love people I
[47:48] remember on the way home I was fighting
[47:50] with the brother John I could pay for
[47:51] his meal I think I paid for his meal if
[47:52] I'm not misten I got to pay for you
[47:54] buddy no I'm pay no I'm pay let's fight
[47:58] about it no it's not it's not do that
[48:00] but I said I said I said sisters don't
[48:02] get discouraged either because you can
[48:04] have some miraculous experience and then
[48:06] fall away from the message right and I
[48:09] said there was a family used to come
[48:11] here there're in the message over 40
[48:12] years I thought both them had the Holy
[48:13] Ghost now I don't know one of their
[48:16] testimonies was that when they were 17
[48:18] years old if I'm not mistaken they were
[48:20] in a service and they spoke in tongues
[48:22] at that service and their dad had to
[48:24] carry them in the car take them home
[48:26] they spoke in tongues all night and then
[48:28] this same
[48:29] person has now left the message
[48:33] church and the the women looked at me
[48:36] like those former Amish
[48:38] people and they're like how could they
[48:41] leave this that's what I say how can I
[48:44] leave amen this is what I wanted my
[48:46] whole life amen hallelujah amen you see
[48:49] no matter what experience you got you
[48:51] better make sure your life lines up with
[48:52] the word of God let me this you better
[48:54] discern good and evil in your life and
[48:57] that person confessed to me on an email
[48:59] and said I never did fast or pray one
[49:01] day in my life yet spoke in tongues a
[49:03] whole night so see thank God for
[49:06] gifts but it's just a gift because just
[49:09] I'm just I'm not holding the gifts down
[49:12] but I'm saying gifts don't save you
[49:13] gifts don't seal you Hallelujah the holy
[49:16] ghost in your soul seals you Hallelujah
[49:20] am right this person said they never
[49:22] fasted never prayed and fasted and then
[49:26] when it come down to the end they let
[49:27] the bars down on their their last few
[49:29] teenagers and let all this sin come in
[49:31] let the girls cut their hair all these a
[49:33] real child of God wouldn't do that right
[49:36] I'm talking about a born again child of
[49:37] God I'm talking about born
[49:39] again so see I told those sisters learn
[49:42] from that it can be so
[49:43] simple you know it can be so simple look
[49:46] at a life that manifests Christ look
[49:50] look for a life that's capped off by the
[49:52] Holy Spirit praise God Amen
[49:56] I thank God for every experience I've
[49:57] ever had I thank God for every
[49:58] experience we've had here but the thing
[50:01] to do is keep maturing in Christ amen
[50:05] hallelujah well brother Jesse surely
[50:07] there can't be more there there's a few
[50:08] more
[50:09] quotes you remember the py message it's
[50:12] the Capstone what it do the Holy Spirit
[50:14] capped off the individual and seal it
[50:16] when we added to our faith righteousness
[50:18] godliness faith and so forth kept adding
[50:20] to it till we got seven things the
[50:22] seventh one was love which is God and
[50:24] that's how he makes the indiv
[50:25] and cast him and seals him with the Holy
[50:33] Spirit Well Jesse could there read one
[50:35] more there's one
[50:38] more see I'm not I'm not making the
[50:41] subjects before I wrote that book how
[50:43] many days did I fast and pray how many
[50:44] sermons did I fast and I just laid on my
[50:46] face that God show me the truth of
[50:50] IT thing is the thing is Hunger for More
[50:52] of the Holy Ghost amen God add to me I
[50:55] had to I need more I want my character
[50:57] to be like you and I'm gonna enjoy the
[51:00] journey don't stress yourself out too
[51:02] much enjoy the journey amen see like
[51:05] that that's what God did to me I think I
[51:06] was remember I told you before I got the
[51:08] Holy Ghost I would just cry shout up in
[51:11] my uh my attic room there and I just
[51:13] wanted to see an angel I just wanted to
[51:15] see something but God just let me cool
[51:17] down I got you know uh I just all I got
[51:20] all focused on our wedding and
[51:22] everything I forgot some details in our
[51:24] wedding so that was really bad
[51:26] try to make up for it over the years but
[51:29] see God just let me let all the pressure
[51:31] off All the nervousness God just let me
[51:33] get married and then God drops down and
[51:35] visits me see just something so simple
[51:39] praise God something so simple just keep
[51:43] hungering and thirsting after the word
[51:46] of God when you get the Holy Ghost You'
[51:48] got the spirit of adoption so you cry
[51:50] out to your daddy Lord I need you God I
[51:53] need
[51:54] you
[51:56] add to your faith virtue and so forth
[51:57] all this in First Peter First Peter 1 I
[52:00] believe is the first chapter where it's
[52:02] all added to your faith all these things
[52:04] godliness and Purity and Holiness and
[52:05] everything and
[52:07] then you're sealed by the Holy Ghost
[52:11] then see add all that add all that then
[52:15] you get the Holy
[52:20] Ghost did I put this one in
[52:22] there okay now that's else I'm not going
[52:27] to go through that
[52:29] one
[52:31] Hallelujah all
[52:33] right thank
[52:38] you so in
[52:40] closing we have seen Jesus said be ye
[52:44] therefore perfect even as your father
[52:47] which is in heaven is perfect we can see
[52:50] God is asking us to become a mature
[52:52] Church how many believe thaten
[52:55] God is asking us to let him continually
[52:58] add more of his word to us more of his
[53:01] Spirit to
[53:03] us right in other words we got to invite
[53:05] God into every area of Our Lives amen
[53:08] praise the
[53:10] Lord and God will fill you at a time at
[53:14] that's the right
[53:15] time the one young sister it was uh
[53:17] brother Levi's stepdaughter Annie I
[53:19] think and she sends her
[53:21] greetings she's the one that went on I
[53:23] think a 40-day fast and then she got the
[53:25] Holy Ghost that's the only person I know
[53:27] that ever did that but she was telling
[53:30] me why she said um she said she was hurt
[53:33] by all these friends who are making uh
[53:35] fun of her how can I say this just I'll
[53:37] just say like just general making fun of
[53:39] her and so she realized wow I've been
[53:42] seeking the Holy Ghost and I have all
[53:43] this bitterness in me she said she said
[53:47] she was seeking the Holy Ghost for I
[53:48] think 16 or 17
[53:51] years and she said then it all struck
[53:53] her while she was fasting I had
[53:55] bitterness toward my cousins I think
[53:57] it's the cousins they would make fun of
[53:59] her size and they make fun of things
[54:01] about her and she called them up and
[54:03] said I have this bitterness against you
[54:05] will you forgive me now think about
[54:08] that she said the ones that she didn't
[54:10] have phone numberers she wrote them
[54:12] letters and she said with each time with
[54:14] she said with each person she contacted
[54:17] she felt like a a weight came off
[54:20] her and she said she got to the spot
[54:22] where she had no more nothing against
[54:26] anybody all cleaned out and it just
[54:29] struck me now what's the last
[54:32] one running just struck me right now I
[54:34] didn't even see a toone right now her
[54:37] family her and these were church members
[54:41] she said I can't wait for them to see me
[54:42] she said that through that fast I lost I
[54:44] think she said 90 pounds and they said
[54:46] you'll never lose it because you're
[54:49] you're not
[54:50] pretty so see it was all this it was a
[54:53] natural and spiritual for
[54:56] her and she and and she you
[54:58] know she said uh she said I don't care
[55:01] if anybody tells me I'm ugly or anything
[55:03] like that she said I know right now if
[55:05] if I could I would sit right on jesus'
[55:07] lap and I would be Jesus's little
[55:09] daughter and she was like beaming
[55:12] smiling and she went from a real quiet
[55:15] lady there and now she's all talking to
[55:16] the sisters about being born again and
[55:18] how much she loves Jesus it's like a
[55:21] fire's been lit amen hallelujah her
[55:23] candle's been lit Hallelujah
[55:25] and like all these you know older women
[55:27] down there are kind of looking at her
[55:28] like she's this example of how to
[55:30] receive the Holy Ghost but I'm also
[55:32] trying to encourage them you don't have
[55:33] to fast 40 days for the Holy Ghost you
[55:36] got to get brotherly kindness Hallelujah
[55:38] you got to get patience you got to get
[55:39] godliness you got to get all those
[55:40] things get your heart cleaned out
[55:42] hallelujah amen amen right and seek God
[55:44] with all your heart let's stand to our
[55:45] feet
[55:50] musicians be therefore
[55:53] perfect even as my father which is in
[55:55] heaven is perfect how many want to be
[55:56] more like
[55:58] Jesus that's why I want more than
[56:00] anything praise God want people to see
[56:02] Christ in me I want my children to see
[56:03] Christ in me I want my wife to see
