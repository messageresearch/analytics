[0:00] real i miss it
[0:02] all right let's go to matthew chapter 26
[0:03] if you would god bless everybody it's
[0:04] going to be in the house of lord tonight
[0:09] i will try to watch it the lord winning
[0:11] matthew 26 55. i just want to read one
[0:13] verse and we'll try to preach hopefully
[0:14] 45 minutes and i want to look at
[0:17] doctrine again you know the power of
[0:18] jesus's doctrine
[0:20] and this is uh that's what i kind of
[0:21] like what i preached on
[0:23] sunday morning if you're able to watch
[0:25] the live stream there or the archive
[0:32] it's been a good a good study for me to
[0:34] kind of go through and see
[0:37] all the scriptures about jesus's
[0:39] doctrine
[0:40] and which really means jesus teaching so
[0:42] for us that'd be the more common word
[0:44] what kind of teacher was jesus what did
[0:46] he teach how often did he teach
[0:49] i think we'll be surprised
[0:50] uh you know by what we see here
[0:54] so matthew
[0:56] 26 55 matthew 26 55.
[1:04] and to me church the the main thought of
[1:06] this is how as we said on sunday morning
[1:09] anyone who's baptized with the holy
[1:10] ghost will be in the word all the way
[1:13] which means they'll be able to be taught
[1:15] as they grow older in the lord
[1:18] we see a lot of people that hang around
[1:19] churches but they don't get on fire for
[1:21] god actually get more lazy for god that
[1:23] proves they're not in the word all the
[1:25] way and i don't care what anybody says
[1:27] there's no way they're born again
[1:28] if you're not going deeper in the things
[1:30] of god falling more in love with jesus
[1:32] yes you're going to have trials yes you
[1:33] have struggles but if you have a
[1:35] continual hunger and thirst for
[1:36] righteousness that proves you've been
[1:37] filled with the holy spirit
[1:39] it's a proof of it
[1:41] so may the lord bless each one of you
[1:43] and this also proves to me that if god
[1:45] wants us to teach us if god wants to
[1:47] teach us more and more
[1:48] then that means there's more and more
[1:49] victories he wants us to gain
[1:51] there's more and more land to take
[1:54] right we have to have the attitude of
[1:55] where i'm not a know-it-all i don't know
[1:57] everything i want to be humble i want to
[1:59] grow in my understanding of god
[2:01] we've got to have that attitude as
[2:02] believers matthew 26 55
[2:08] thank you for your patience here as i
[2:09] get there i'll set my timer now here and
[2:12] uh try to do
[2:13] i'll set it for 30 30 minutes we'll see
[2:15] how far we do there then we'll give a
[2:17] little closing there
[2:19] 26 55 matthew 26 55.
[2:25] i want you to notice this is jesus uh
[2:29] he's at uh he's being arrested here
[2:31] rather he's being arrested on the night
[2:32] of his
[2:33] arrest right the day before the
[2:34] crucifixion right and notice what he
[2:36] says is he's being arrested here in
[2:38] verse 55 in that same hour said jesus to
[2:40] the multitudes are ye come out as a
[2:43] thief i'm sorry as against a thief with
[2:45] swords and staves for to take me in
[2:47] other words why are you coming at me
[2:48] like i'm a thief
[2:50] you have swords and staves and
[2:53] he says
[2:54] i sat daily with you teaching in the
[2:56] temple and you laid no hold on me
[2:59] so he wasn't a thief he wasn't a type of
[3:02] guy you'd
[3:03] approach jesus and say oh this guy's a
[3:05] violent guy
[3:06] no the bible said he they saw him daily
[3:09] teaching where in the house of god he
[3:11] was about his father's business
[3:13] so when jesus was around that era
[3:15] jerusalem where would he be he'd be in
[3:16] the house of god when he wasn't there
[3:17] where was he was up in capernaum right
[3:19] in his northern residence up there he
[3:21] spent the majority of his ministry up in
[3:22] capernaum and the galilee area
[3:25] constantly teaching in the synagogues he
[3:26] was always in the synagogue as the bible
[3:28] said so every saturday brother austin he
[3:30] was always in church every saturday if
[3:32] it's saturday where's jesus he says he's
[3:33] over in the synagogue he's reading the
[3:35] scrolls he's teaching he's healing
[3:37] people
[3:38] hallelujah that was our savior
[3:40] verse 56 but all this was done that the
[3:42] scriptures of the prophets might be
[3:44] fulfilled then all the disciples forsook
[3:47] him
[3:48] and fled
[3:49] imagine that being arrested and all your
[3:52] all your companions all your all your
[3:53] buddies all your best friends they all
[3:55] leave you
[3:56] jesus endured that and he did it with
[3:58] love in his heart as well
[4:00] for the joy that was before him he
[4:02] endured all this all this contradiction
[4:04] of sinners all this abandonment he
[4:06] endured all that because of the love
[4:07] that he had for you and i how many still
[4:09] see yourself as the disciple jesus loved
[4:12] let's bow our heads heavenly father we
[4:13] just love you we we give you praise we
[4:15] love you with all of our heart soul mind
[4:17] and strength lord jesus anoint me god
[4:18] for these few moments as we refocus on
[4:21] you and we give you this sacrifice of
[4:23] praise we've entered with thanksgiving
[4:25] we enter with praise oh god we give you
[4:27] the sacrifice of praise now speak to us
[4:28] through thy word thy holy word and i
[4:31] pray god you minister now in jesus
[4:32] christ's name and saint said
[4:35] amen hallelujah god bless you as you're
[4:36] being seated
[4:40] if jesus wants to teach you all the days
[4:42] of your life
[4:43] then that means he's interested in every
[4:46] detail of your life
[4:48] he wants you to be in the word all the
[4:50] way all the way to your 60 70 80 lord
[4:53] willing 90
[4:55] even more lord willing a hundred
[4:57] then he must have so much knowledge that
[5:00] he can teach us
[5:01] and that must mean he wants to be a part
[5:03] of all of our day
[5:05] from the very beginning all the way to
[5:07] the wonderful parts you know all the way
[5:09] to the very end right
[5:10] hopefully it's all wonderful by god's
[5:12] grace but you understand what i'm saying
[5:13] i have a few slides here we'll look at
[5:15] this if you have your bibles go to
[5:17] matthew five go to back to matthew
[5:19] chapter five i uh on sunday morning i
[5:22] didn't really spend a lot of time on
[5:23] this but i want to spend
[5:24] i want to show you uh this is part two
[5:26] the power of jesus is doctrine
[5:29] in church it's power
[5:31] not just to do signs miracles and
[5:33] wonders that's part of it but it's also
[5:35] power to make you a daily
[5:37] faithful believer
[5:39] to make you an obedient humble christian
[5:42] to have the the mind of christ have the
[5:44] character of christ every day of your
[5:46] life that's power
[5:48] anybody can go to church and say amen on
[5:49] sunday but if you have the power of god
[5:51] you'll serve god on monday
[5:53] and tuesday and you'll go to church on
[5:55] wednesday
[5:56] you know right
[5:58] see you
[5:59] that's real power when you got it to do
[6:01] miracles because even the uh even the
[6:03] workers of iniquity have miracles
[6:05] they can temporarily meet god's
[6:07] requirements and they can approach god
[6:08] at a service and do a miracle but then
[6:10] the rest of their time they're workers
[6:12] of iniquity
[6:13] right like balaam we know that
[6:15] so
[6:16] that that's really power sometimes we
[6:17] misunderstand power
[6:19] right power uh the bible says power or
[6:22] brother man says power without a
[6:23] character is satanic
[6:25] so that proves it a power do miracles
[6:27] without the character of christ ends up
[6:29] with a worker of iniquity a person who's
[6:32] uh sent to hell who's lost who loves the
[6:35] iniquity more than righteousness
[6:37] so the real power of god is signs
[6:39] miracles and wonders but it's a daily
[6:42] life that wants to grow closer to god
[6:44] and wants to please him and wants his
[6:46] presence all throughout the day amen now
[6:49] we read our text here
[6:51] i'm just going to give you quickly 15
[6:54] there's probably more i'm going to give
[6:55] you 15 doctrines
[6:57] where jesus taught in the sermon on the
[6:59] mount i think there was that show and my
[7:01] kids were talking about it the chosen
[7:03] they talked about how
[7:04] the sermon on the mount was like
[7:06] one of jesus's major sermons and no
[7:08] doubt it was it was a and they kind of
[7:10] pumped it up or not pumped it up but
[7:12] they kind of worked it up as this the
[7:13] message one of jesus greatest messages
[7:15] and no doubt it was
[7:17] but i'm not sure if people understand
[7:19] every time jesus said do something
[7:22] that's a doctrine
[7:23] because the word doctrine means
[7:25] instruction or command so a doctrine is
[7:27] anything you should do
[7:30] uh preaching is what god has done or
[7:33] will do
[7:34] okay
[7:35] so preaching is the rapture is coming
[7:37] soon praise god and god is healed god
[7:39] god always does miracles those are all
[7:41] that's all preaching but when it gets
[7:42] down to you need to repent and this is
[7:44] how you do it now we're on doctrine amen
[7:46] or this is how you get the holy ghost
[7:48] now we're on doctrine
[7:49] right because it's instruction it's
[7:52] teaching you how to obey
[7:54] so you can imagine
[7:57] here uh that that doctrine is very
[7:59] crucial i think doctrine is greater than
[8:00] what we understand
[8:02] it impacts as we said every detail of
[8:04] our life
[8:05] it ought to because it ought to teach us
[8:07] how to pray teach us how to serve teach
[8:09] us how to interact in our homes teach us
[8:11] how to behave on the on the job amen
[8:13] teaches how to love god at church it
[8:15] should impact every area of our life and
[8:18] there's power in it praise god
[8:20] now the first doctrine is how to be
[8:22] blessed in matthew 5 verses
[8:25] 3 through 12. so you want to be blessed
[8:27] the bible said be poor in spirit that
[8:29] means be humble in spirit
[8:32] right don't be exalted like i know
[8:34] everything or
[8:35] or i'm smarter than everybody
[8:37] that's the way to be cursed the way to
[8:39] be blessed is to be poor in spirit if
[8:42] you do that then you are part of the
[8:43] kingdom of heaven the bible says
[8:46] remember verse 4
[8:48] how are you blessed mourn
[8:50] and then you'll be comforted
[8:52] see a lot of people won't mourn they'll
[8:54] drown their sorrows away with alcohol
[8:55] right or food or cigarettes or
[8:58] lustful living luxurious living whatever
[9:01] but it really is a blessed thing to
[9:03] mourn over natural things that we should
[9:06] mourn over
[9:07] deaths and sicknesses and all you know
[9:09] whatever whatever we must mourn over
[9:11] because then the bible says then we
[9:13] receive the comfort of the holy spirit
[9:16] verse 5 meek if you want to be blessed
[9:19] be meek for they inherit the earth
[9:21] praise god which very similar to poor in
[9:23] spirit
[9:25] uh verse six blessed are they that do
[9:27] hunger and thirst for righteousness for
[9:28] they shall be filled praise god you
[9:30] wanna be filled with the holy ghost
[9:31] start hungering for the word right love
[9:33] the word say amen to the word amen
[9:35] hallelujah pray right seek god
[9:39] make that the the best part of your day
[9:41] the best part of your week being in the
[9:42] house of god being with the saints
[9:44] hunger and thirst after and jesus
[9:46] promised you'll be blessed and be filled
[9:48] by the holy ghost verse 7 blessed are
[9:51] the merciful for they shall obtain mercy
[9:55] again this is how to be blessed how to
[9:57] this is doctrine
[9:59] uh verse
[10:00] 8
[10:01] how are you blessed be pure in heart and
[10:04] you will see god of course that's in his
[10:06] favor you'll see god in his favor of
[10:07] course you'll see god in your life as
[10:08] well hallelujah if you are pure in heart
[10:12] verse 9 blessed are the peacemakers they
[10:14] should be called the children of god
[10:17] right don't stir people up to anger and
[10:19] arguing and fussing and debates but
[10:22] encourage them to have peace
[10:23] and say how can we how can we smooth
[10:25] this out i do it all day and i'm with
[10:27] six and seven-year-olds all day i'm i'm
[10:29] trying to be a peacemaker all day
[10:31] all right this one argue in that
[10:32] argument i'm like can we do we really
[10:34] have to do this
[10:35] but you know they're just learning
[10:38] i think about adults you know i think
[10:39] about people that you know manage over
[10:41] adults there's a lot of arguments in
[10:42] adults right right there's probably more
[10:45] but we should be peacemakers
[10:47] and verse
[10:48] 10 blessed are they when you're
[10:50] persecuted for righteous sake for theirs
[10:52] is the kingdom of heaven blessed are you
[10:53] when men shall revile you and persecute
[10:55] you and say all manner of evil against
[10:57] you falsely for my sake rejoice and be
[10:59] exceedingly glad for great is your
[11:01] reward in heaven for so persecuted they
[11:03] the prophets which were before you
[11:06] okay so there's the first doctrine how
[11:08] to be blessed
[11:11] if jesus is speaking here on instructing
[11:13] you how to live that he's giving
[11:15] doctrine he's giving you the doctrine to
[11:17] be blessed how many want to be blessed
[11:20] how many want to be peacemakers tomorrow
[11:22] i want how many want to be merciful
[11:24] tomorrow
[11:25] praise god then act on jesus's commands
[11:28] now go to verse 22
[11:30] but i say unto you that whosoever is
[11:32] angry with his brother without a cause
[11:34] should be danger of the judgment and
[11:35] whosoever shall be in danger of the
[11:37] counsel i'm sorry whosoever shall say to
[11:39] his brother raqqa shall be in danger of
[11:41] the council but whosoever shall say thou
[11:42] fool shall be in danger of hell-fire
[11:44] here's the how-to on anger
[11:47] here's how to deal with anger
[11:49] do not have unjust anger with people
[11:52] if you have unjust anger with people
[11:54] then you have a murdering spirit on you
[11:56] that's what jesus says
[11:58] right
[11:59] and then if you have that murdering
[12:00] spirit on you you're likely not to
[12:01] repent and jesus said you're likely to
[12:03] go to hell
[12:04] if you can't forgive all because of
[12:06] anger
[12:07] so this is how to
[12:09] deal with anger
[12:11] the bible says you can be angry and not
[12:13] sin
[12:14] like we're going to see with jesus and
[12:15] the cords he was angry but he never
[12:17] sinned in fact we'll see it while he was
[12:20] with whipping them with the cord he was
[12:22] giving them doctrine amen
[12:25] hallelujah praise god
[12:27] that's what it is like today when we get
[12:28] when we start hammering on doctrine
[12:30] people don't like it right they they
[12:32] want because it offends them it makes
[12:34] them want to or makes them have to
[12:35] change their life if they're going to be
[12:36] a real believer
[12:38] people don't like that
[12:40] well that's okay it doesn't matter what
[12:41] the people like it's what god's children
[12:43] like amen and god's children will like
[12:45] it even though it's hard or difficult
[12:47] they'll say amen to every word of god
[12:49] all right that's the second doctrine
[12:51] the third doctrine is verse 23 therefore
[12:53] if i bring thy gift to the altar and
[12:55] therefore remembers that thy brother at
[12:56] the ought against thee leave there thy
[12:58] gift before the altar and go thy way
[13:00] first be reconciled to thy brother and
[13:02] then come
[13:04] and offer thy gift
[13:06] in other words if before you come to
[13:08] church try to make everything right
[13:09] before you come to church i know it's
[13:11] not always possible but try to do that
[13:13] before you give an offering or before
[13:14] you give your tithe before you try to do
[13:16] any service to god make sure your heart
[13:18] is right with god
[13:20] see that's how to how do i offer a real
[13:22] sacrifice jesus says this make sure you
[13:24] have no offenses toward anybody
[13:26] that way god will receive your sacrifice
[13:28] how many want god to receive your
[13:30] sacrifice
[13:31] i don't want to be like cain and give
[13:32] god an offering and then god says i
[13:33] don't even receive it
[13:35] that's what a lot of people do today
[13:37] they'll offer some who say well i went
[13:38] to church or where are they saying
[13:39] praises
