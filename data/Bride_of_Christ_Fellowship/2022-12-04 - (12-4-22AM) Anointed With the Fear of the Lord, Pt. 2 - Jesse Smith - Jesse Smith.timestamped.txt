[0:00] I have a few uh quotes to show
[0:03] scriptures rather
[0:07] so let's look at part two here and uh
[0:10] see how far we can get by God's grace
[0:21] so we looked at I'm just going to do A
[0:23] Brief Review I promise it's just it's uh
[0:25] only a couple slide review Okay so
[0:28] so from Wednesday we saw how the fear of
[0:31] the Lord is all these things it was just
[0:33] amazing to see when you start lining it
[0:35] up what the fear of the Lord actually is
[0:38] it's your moral
[0:40] reverence so
[0:42] your moral honor for God in other words
[0:45] your honor of obedience
[0:48] so when when a person has the fear of
[0:50] the Lord they honor God with their moral
[0:54] decisions that means they're obeying the
[0:56] voice of the Lord praise God
[0:58] and I you know as I believe you know the
[1:00] more I thought about it all weekend and
[1:02] everything like that the more I think
[1:04] about it is the more I I think is that
[1:06] just to be saved you've got to have the
[1:08] fear of the Lord
[1:10] because the Bible says the beginning of
[1:12] wisdom right and then if you don't have
[1:13] wisdom you can't see the the mother
[1:15] Harlot sits on Seven Hills plus all the
[1:17] other gifts of the Spirit you know all
[1:18] the other aspects of
[1:20] uh the supernatural
[1:22] the Bible says the goodness of God leads
[1:24] us to repentance
[1:26] so what's good about God what's good
[1:29] about God is that he forgives us of our
[1:30] sins we're guilty of of sin but God
[1:33] forgives us
[1:35] and so the goodness of God leads us to
[1:37] repentance so we fear God we honor God
[1:40] we morally we we morally honor God and
[1:44] we say Lord your ways are right and
[1:45] you're and I'm repenting I'm uh and
[1:48] repenting is departing from Evil there
[1:49] it is praise God so the fear of the Lord
[1:51] is to depart from Evil the fear of the
[1:53] Lord is to hate evil
[1:55] and so a person can't even get saved
[1:58] unless they have the fear of the Lord so
[1:59] what does that mean it means that fear
[2:01] of the Lord is an anointing that can
[2:02] increase as we continue serving the lord
[2:05] Hallelujah
[2:07] you and I will never get to a spot where
[2:09] we say I'm I'm good on the fear of the
[2:11] Lord I don't need any more fear of the
[2:13] Lord right we'll never get to a spot on
[2:15] that
[2:16] um
[2:17] so we just want to revisit it I think
[2:20] it's timely as we've had all this uh all
[2:22] the results and I kind of want to show
[2:24] that at the end too
[2:25] brother random says when you're LED of
[2:27] the Holy Spirit you have to if you don't
[2:29] hear a voice or you don't see a vision
[2:30] from God he says you have to look at the
[2:32] results that your decision bears
[2:36] and so that's what I've always tried to
[2:37] do as a preacher I'm sure you two as a
[2:40] believer
[2:41] you know you make decisions and you
[2:43] fight you're you're trying to find the
[2:45] will of God the best you can
[2:47] but then you the nice part is you have
[2:49] hindsight you look back and say okay
[2:51] that was either the right decision or
[2:52] the wrong decision
[2:54] and when it's the right decision then
[2:56] you know you found the leading of the
[2:58] Lord
[2:59] you've you've had the fear of the Lord
[3:01] praise God for that decision and and if
[3:04] not well then you say praise God forgive
[3:06] me try me again next time I'll have the
[3:08] fear of the Lord for this
[3:10] amen and so that's what all of us all of
[3:12] us fail we all fall short of God's grace
[3:14] but God really loves us amen that's a
[3:15] beautiful song buddy
[3:17] I always mention one of the songs amen
[3:19] sings because it's always it's it's
[3:21] always uh timely by God's grace so the
[3:23] fear of the Lord is also your confidence
[3:25] in God we saw that the Bible said he
[3:28] that's in the fear of the Lord is
[3:29] confident in God hallelujah now to me
[3:32] church this I think this is the key I
[3:33] didn't have time to write this out but I
[3:35] think this is the key to more miracles
[3:37] because the Bible said Jesus could not
[3:39] do many miracles because of their
[3:41] unbelief
[3:42] right what is unbelief well doubt you
[3:44] know I don't believe the word but when
[3:46] we're confident in God then we know God
[3:48] wants to move amen
[3:50] so I feel like you know the more fear of
[3:52] the Lord and we I can prove this by the
[3:53] Bible
[3:54] uh the book of Acts especially the more
[3:57] fear of God we have the more God moves
[3:59] supernaturally
[4:00] in other words the more moral reverence
[4:02] the more we're honoring God with our
[4:04] decisions the more God moves in our life
[4:08] how many how many witnesses of that by
[4:09] God's grace amen the more you really
[4:11] make sure today I'm going to serve God
[4:13] today I'm really going to honor God
[4:14] today I'm going to meditate on the
[4:15] things of God today I'm really going to
[4:17] be focused on God today
[4:19] the more we do that the more we see God
[4:21] move in our lives
[4:23] and that's what the scripture tells us
[4:25] so it's plain it's true it's Vindicated
[4:28] by the Holy Spirit praise God
[4:30] and also the fear of God is your Refuge
[4:33] it's your place of safety praise God
[4:34] hallelujah
[4:36] fear is your starting place on your
[4:39] journey to getting the main thing right
[4:41] getting the wisdom of God
[4:43] it's so many things fear is your
[4:45] Fountain of Life
[4:47] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[4:50] fear is uh the anointing
[4:52] that you receive when you hate evil
[4:55] fear is your constant source of
[4:58] Happiness who would have thought fear
[4:59] brings happiness right but it's a
[5:01] different definition up here it's not
[5:03] the fear we normally associate with them
[5:05] I'm fearful of guns or I'm fearful of
[5:07] dogs I'm fearful of monsters or whatever
[5:10] you're whatever someone might be fearful
[5:12] of
[5:13] but it actually when you fear the lord
[5:15] it brings true happiness in your life
[5:18] and then we saw that fear is your
[5:20] conclusion about life's purpose have I
[5:23] accomplished my purpose in life the way
[5:25] you'll know is because you're walking in
[5:27] the fear of the Lord
[5:28] you're morally reverent to the things of
[5:31] God
[5:32] and church many times you know I think
[5:34] we just have to Humble ourselves and
[5:35] accept what God's purpose is for our
[5:37] life rather than the purpose we think we
[5:39] need for our lives
[5:41] right it's different many times than
[5:43] what we want it to be it's not about us
[5:45] it's about God hallelujah it's about
[5:47] God's choice who are we to tell to the
[5:49] uh the Potter Lord you need to make me
[5:52] like this
[5:53] you need to make my life like this no
[5:56] the the Potter has power over the clay
[5:58] praise God and Jesus has power over each
[6:01] one of our lives
[6:03] and so thank God for the fear of the
[6:05] Lord that we can come to our conclusion
[6:07] that my life when I when I obey God when
[6:10] I reverence his word then I'm fulfilling
[6:12] God's purpose I found the conclusion of
[6:14] the matter amen I found the conclusion
[6:17] to the mystery of my life I found it in
[6:19] the fear of the Lord It's so simple
[6:21] right it's just you know it's just kind
[6:23] of shocking how simple it actually is
[6:25] when we look at the scriptures here okay
[6:27] and then this was a good one too you
[6:29] know I think it kind of struck me while
[6:30] I was preaching
[6:32] fear of the Lord is taught by Grace when
[6:34] you receive God's gift
[6:36] receiving God's gift cause you to you
[6:39] know morally reverence God it causes you
[6:41] to honor God so fear is taught by Grace
[6:44] fear is not taught by legalism
[6:47] uh
[6:48] and of course the fear of God also
[6:50] teaches you reverence we saw that in
[6:52] Hebrews chapter 12. let us serve God
[6:54] acceptably with reverence and fear
[6:56] Hallelujah so thank God for Amazing
[6:59] Grace hallelujah how many want to be
[7:01] taught by Grace amen I don't want to be
[7:03] taught by the law uh the law of man or
[7:05] legalism I don't I don't want to be
[7:06] taught by human fear I want to be taught
[7:09] by the grace of God hallelujah to teach
[7:11] me the fear of the Lord praise God
[7:14] and of course we saw the Lord Jesus
[7:15] Christ was anointed with the fear of the
[7:17] Lord this is speaking of Jesus he come
[7:20] out of the stem of Jesse then David
[7:23] Solomon down all those Generations
[7:26] Messiah came out of the uh the tribe of
[7:29] Judah by God's grace
[7:33] and notice the spirit of Lord rests upon
[7:35] Him in all these ways and then the Bible
[7:37] said he shall make of him quick
[7:39] understanding in the fear of the Lord
[7:42] so Jesus was quick to fear the lord he
[7:44] was I'll say like this he was constant
[7:46] he was always fearing the Lord
[7:48] right and in the moments where he
[7:50] struggled what'd he do he prayed
[7:52] right he said he said he had that moment
[7:54] he said let this cup Pastor me
[7:57] right so he was battling with fearing
[7:58] the Lord you know Lord if it's possible
[8:00] take this cup from me but notice in the
[8:02] moments where he was struggling with the
[8:04] fear of the Lord Prayer is what got him
[8:06] through praise God prayer is what it's
[8:09] going to get you through praise God
[8:11] prayer is what is going to get me
[8:13] through it's going to get each of us
[8:14] through when we come to moments of our
[8:16] life when we don't
[8:18] maybe know the will of God or we don't
[8:20] we find it difficult to obey the will of
[8:23] God prayer and self-crucifixion you know
[8:26] dying to self mortifying the Deeds of
[8:29] the flesh uh taking up one's cross daily
[8:33] walking like Jesus walk will help us
[8:35] find the fear of the Lord
[8:40] and so Jesus was quick in the
[8:43] understanding in the fear of the Lord he
[8:45] understood this he was quick to obey he
[8:48] was quick to go to prayer Hallelujah God
[8:50] help us to be quick to go to prayer amen
[8:52] he will by God's grace now just I put a
[8:54] little thought in here between these
[8:56] verses so the fear of the Lord
[8:58] is an anointing that gives you spiritual
[9:00] discernment or spiritual eyesight and
[9:03] spiritual hearing
[9:05] because the Bible said Jesus would not
[9:07] judge after the sight of his eyes
[9:10] right Jesus could look at the Pharisees
[9:12] and say you're the cleanest physical
[9:14] people on earth
[9:16] you have the most beautiful clothes
[9:18] right
[9:19] your temple garments or your your
[9:21] Priestly garments they're the most
[9:23] beautiful garments but inwardly you're
[9:25] full of dead men's bones
[9:28] right so it is today no matter how big a
[9:30] church is or no matter how rich people
[9:32] are
[9:34] whatever money they spend on clothes a
[9:37] real spiritual person thank God we can
[9:39] look past the outside and we could look
[9:41] down into the heart
[9:43] right that's the spirit of the Lord the
[9:45] spirit of the Lord doesn't look upon the
[9:47] outward appearance just like God God
[9:49] doesn't look upon the outward appearance
[9:50] amen like like he told David right like
[9:53] Samuel told David God look at us at the
[9:56] heart Hallelujah
[9:58] and see even the hearing of the ears you
[10:00] know Jesus Jesus watch the Pharisees
[10:03] worship and he said they draw near to me
[10:06] with their mouth but their heart is far
[10:08] from me
[10:10] right
[10:11] that's why you know when we listen to
[10:13] like let's say a Hillsong song or a
[10:15] Bethel song or uh any any person put any
[10:18] name in there we can kind of hear their
[10:20] singing but to me they don't sing it
[10:23] with the real love like we sing it with
[10:26] Hallelujah that's right amen
[10:28] we can hear it but it just doesn't have
[10:30] the right ring to it praise God
[10:33] because we're hearing with more than
[10:34] just a natural one right so we got to
[10:37] take out there's any Little Rock and
[10:38] Roll we got to take that out if there's
[10:40] any like uh what do they call it when
[10:42] they make their voice all like that
[10:45] inflection they inflict their voice or
[10:47] they slur like you know how Lauren
[10:49] Daigle does the you know they they add
[10:52] this human element to it well we can
[10:54] hear that's just not really that doesn't
[10:56] glorify Christ that's exalting a manner
[10:58] that's exalting a woman
[11:00] so see the fear of the Lord and if you
[11:02] fear God you wouldn't make your voice
[11:03] sound like that
[11:05] it's not a performance it's a worship
[11:07] praise God
[11:09] and so Jesus just like the Pharisees you
[11:11] know Jesus just we can do the same thing
[11:13] we have the spirit of God to recognize
[11:15] well that doesn't sound exactly right
[11:16] they're saying all the right things but
[11:19] it doesn't sound right there's just
[11:21] there's something missing to it right
[11:23] and so thank God that we can see with
[11:25] spiritual eyes thank God that we can
[11:27] hear we're spiritual ears because
[11:29] blessed are your eyes for they see
[11:31] blessed are your ears for they can hear
[11:33] praise God Amen
[11:36] this is an anointing of the Holy Spirit
[11:39] that Believers have but Jesus had it
[11:41] first
[11:45] notice in this
[11:47] story about ananias the fire and Peter
[11:49] Peter didn't see anything that looked
[11:51] wrong
[11:52] Right ananias comes and says I sold the
[11:55] land I want to give this and this and
[11:57] the amount and now look Peter's got the
[11:59] same Holy Ghost Jesus had praise God
[12:01] and he doesn't judge by what he sees
[12:03] naturally he judges by what he sees
[12:06] spiritually
[12:07] and the Holy Spirit showed him that
[12:10] ananias was lying to the Holy Ghost but
[12:12] everything on the outside looked good
[12:14] right it looked religious it looked very
[12:17] close to all the other worshipers who
[12:19] were selling their lands and giving the
[12:21] money to the early church
[12:24] and so we see the the the way we're
[12:26] going to have this spiritual eyesight is
[12:28] to stay in communion with God to stay in
[12:30] the fear of the Lord
[12:32] then we'll see past people's outward
[12:34] appearance and like I said this many
[12:36] times but how many people have we come
[12:37] in here and they leave out to a life of
[12:40] sin or a worldly life on the outside
[12:43] they dress holy
[12:45] on the outside it looks like it's right
[12:48] but then inwardly we find out later God
[12:51] net was never first place to begin with
[12:54] right
[12:55] or they they never really had the Holy
[12:57] Ghost to begin with OR they really
[12:59] didn't love the word like maybe they
[13:01] thought they loved the word
[13:03] see because but we see it with spiritual
[13:06] eyesight praise God we can see it and
[13:08] we're made aware of it and so we've got
[13:11] to have this anointing that Jesus had
[13:13] and Jesus had this anointing in it and
[13:16] it helped him to overcome praise God
[13:18] hallelujah that's going to help us to
[13:20] overcome as well praise God the
[13:21] anointing of the Holy Spirit
[13:24] now notice after this anointing when
[13:26] when when when when when the anointing
[13:29] on Peter moved in such a way it caused
[13:31] everybody else to have fear of the Lord
[13:34] so that's what I want to have as a
[13:36] leader of the church as a pastor I want
[13:38] to be under the anointing so God can do
[13:40] Supernatural through me and then that
[13:43] will raise the fear of everybody in the
[13:44] church praise God
[13:48] like I don't I don't think sister Naomi
[13:50] will mind sharing but I had a dream
[13:51] about sister Naomi a couple weeks ago
[13:53] and it discerned her life
[13:55] right we talked about it out there my
[13:57] wife had a dream I shared it with a
[13:59] friend this week and the friend received
[14:01] it as from the Lord
[14:03] um I didn't ask for the dream I just go
[14:06] to bed you know same way I'd go to bed
[14:08] every night you know
[14:10] um
[14:11] and and uh
[14:13] you know what we want is we want God to
[14:15] move through us you know we can't tell
[14:17] God how to move through us we've just
[14:19] got to be vessels that God can use and
[14:21] then God can use us in whatever way he
[14:23] wants to use us praise God
[14:25] but I feel like that and I know you do
[14:27] too when God does a miracle or God does
[14:29] any Supernatural through somebody it
[14:31] actually raises your fear of the Lord
[14:33] like it makes you want to be a better
[14:35] servant to the Lord
[14:37] that's that's great fear it says moral
[14:39] like in other words when you see God
[14:40] answer a prayer in the church it makes
[14:42] you want to live closer to God
[14:43] hallelujah amen thank God Amen
[14:47] and so this is the anointing of the Holy
[14:49] Spirit now we're constantly under the
[14:51] battle to keep this anointing on us
[14:53] praise God
[14:54] and that's what we daily Endeavor to do
[14:58] well the ram called it the greatest
[15:00] battle ever fought how many would agree
[15:01] with brother Brandon I agree it is
[15:03] without a doubt the greatest battle ever
[15:05] fought to keep your mind focused on the
[15:08] word of God to walk in the fear of the
[15:10] Lord praise God
[15:12] because we're living in laodicea where
[15:13] it's a lukewarm time and every almost
[15:15] everything we see in our phones and our
[15:17] interactions everything we see around us
[15:19] is making us look warm
[15:22] right it's trying to influ try to
[15:24] influence our minds and I didn't say
[15:25] you're so now let me clear that up again
[15:27] it tries to make your mind lukewarm amen
[15:30] not the soul
[15:32] and so everything is is trying to
[15:34] influence you lukewarm in the spirit
[15:35] lukewarm in the mind and don't meditate
[15:38] on God but we we have to break through
[15:40] that and we've got to take time to rub
[15:42] to rub the anointing on us praise God or
[15:44] ask the lord lord rub your anointing on
[15:46] us praise God that we can walk in the
[15:49] fear of the Lord praise God
[15:51] and then when we do that the great fear
[15:53] comes on all of us hallelujah
[15:56] it should spread in a good way praise
[15:58] God hallelujah
[16:03] now I just you know with this these six
[16:06] anointings I just want to revisit this
[16:07] again uh briefly uh Jesus had six
[16:10] anointings on that's a picture from uh
[16:13] Jesus of Nazareth that movie is like a
[16:15] six hour movie or something
[16:17] anyways I just love that movie about
[16:19] Jesus his hair is kind of long in that
[16:21] one I don't know if I'd say his hair was
[16:23] that long
[16:24] but the Bible said here he had six
[16:26] anointings on him
[16:29] or six we'd say attributes of the
[16:31] anointing of the Holy Spirit
[16:33] wisdom understanding counsel might
[16:34] knowledge and the fear of the Lord now
[16:37] remember I'm taking these notes now from
[16:39] 2018.
[16:41] so number six has at least three
[16:42] meanings it means Fallen man and Beast
[16:44] it also means the anointed man and it
[16:46] means measuring time for man right time
[16:50] time that man lives in
[16:53] okay so brother Brown said six is man's
[16:55] day brother random said six is the
[16:56] number of man
[16:58] and so uh beasts were made on the sixth
[17:01] day of creation
[17:03] right uh Jacob as a man served Laban for
[17:07] six years for cattle so we see man and
[17:09] beasts connected in six
[17:11] days of work for a man
[17:14] all right thank God for a day off on
[17:15] Sunday praise God for most of us not me
[17:19] that's okay
[17:20] that's my it's my calling in life uh
[17:23] Revelation 13 18 666.
[17:27] polygamy started in the sixth generation
[17:30] of Cain's descendants
[17:33] um Ahab and Jezebel's daughter reigned
[17:35] for six years before Joe Ash descended
[17:37] to the throne a Hebrew servant would
[17:40] serve for six years but seventh go free
[17:43] now I like this his worth was uh double
[17:46] a blessing I like that his worth was a
[17:48] double a blessing
[17:51] six years they would plant in the field
[17:53] right but then rest on the seventh but
[17:56] like this they got a double blessing on
[17:58] the sixth year
[17:59] see six is a good number some people
[18:01] only 666 is not a good number all the
[18:03] other sixes are good numbers if you're a
[18:06] believer
[18:07] praise God
[18:09] like uh one time Loris Loris you know in
[18:13] a in a funny way he was saying well 13
[18:15] is not a good number brother Jesse you
[18:16] know it's a number of uh the beasts of
[18:18] Revelation I said well that's true
[18:19] brother I said but there's the other
[18:20] side you had the 12 apostles plus Jesus
[18:22] that's 13. that's a pretty good team
[18:24] there
[18:25] that's a that's an Unstoppable team if
[18:28] Jesus is on your team you're Invincible
[18:29] praise God
[18:30] but it's just showing the point that God
[18:33] works on both sides of the I'm sorry God
[18:34] works on the good side and Satan works
[18:36] on the bad side
[18:37] right Satan takes a number and he
[18:39] perverts it
[18:41] sixth thing the Lord hates
[18:44] proud look that's where we get like
[18:45] makeup and things and and fancy clothes
[18:48] lying tongue hands that shed innocent
[18:50] blood heart devising Wicked imaginations
[18:52] fit or feet swiftly run to Mischief
[18:54] false witness speaking lies and then
[18:56] sowing Discord among brethren
[19:00] it took a job six months to slay all the
[19:03] male which were Esau's
[19:04] descendants in the New Testament it was
[19:06] about the sixth hour when pilate
[19:09] presented Jesus before the Jews
[19:12] of course Fallen man crying away with
[19:14] him crucified
[19:16] there was Darkness from the sixth hour
[19:18] to the ninth hour so Darkness started in
[19:20] the sixth hour which would have been
[19:22] noon
[19:24] The Sixth Seal includes a six-fold wrath
[19:26] upon man
[19:28] earthquake some become Black Moon
[19:30] becomes blood stars fall to Earth how do
[19:32] you remember this servant anybody
[19:33] remember the sermon for a while ago
[19:34] slightly yeah I didn't remember all of
[19:36] it so it was fresh to me now measuring
[19:39] time a foot has two groups of six right
[19:43] six inches but six inches uh Solomon's
[19:46] Temple and the shoe bread had two groups
[19:48] of six as well
[19:50] the common measurements are in groups of
[19:52] six inches 18 inches 24 they're
[19:54] multiples of six thirty thirty six a day
[19:57] has 24 hours or four groups of six
[20:02] uh there's 12 months which is two groups
[20:04] of six
[20:06] time is measured in hours or 60 minutes
[20:10] and then there's 60 seconds in a minute
[20:12] so this all relates to man you can see
[20:14] the sixes the sixth day of creation now
[20:16] here we get to the good part here's
[20:17] where you and I come in praise God the
[20:20] anointed children of God hallelujah man
[20:23] was made in God's image on the sixth day
[20:25] and he was a holy man
[20:27] said he was made on the sixth day of
[20:29] course he had a holy Veil on him right
[20:30] he wasn't he wasn't a sinner Adam hadn't
[20:33] sinned yet
[20:34] Abraham interceded six times for a lot
[20:37] praise God hallelujah
[20:40] on the sixth day Manna would be twice as
[20:43] much to cover the seventh kind of went
[20:44] to that earlier
[20:46] six days the glory of the Lord in a
[20:48] cloud covered Mount Sinai amen
[20:51] and God called unto Moses on the seventh
[20:54] day
[20:56] six branches came out of the one
[20:58] Candlestick three on each side of course
[21:00] it's typed with the middle kennel type
[21:02] the seven Church ages Aaron's ephod had
[21:05] two stones one for each shoulder each
[21:07] had six names of the children of Israel
[21:09] so there you see again two and six
[21:11] shoe bread was two rows of six
[21:14] uh there are six Cities of Refuge the
[21:17] Bible said three on one side of Jordan
[21:19] and three on the Canaan side
[21:22] six days Israel ate unleavened bread for
[21:24] the feast on the seventh there was a
[21:26] solemn assembly
[21:28] see six days of unleavened six days of
[21:30] sanctification amen
[21:31] hallelujah Joshua went about Jericho for
[21:34] six days
[21:36] praise God
[21:38] Ruth was given six measures of barley
[21:40] praise God
[21:42] David did a service and sacrificed oxen
[21:44] every six steps
[21:46] Solomon's Temple has six steps with
[21:48] twelve Lions upon the sixth step so
[21:51] there's two groups of six again
[21:53] Esther was purified by six months of oil
[21:55] then six months of sweet odor she had to
[21:58] be anointed to come in the presence of
[22:00] the king amen hallelujah praise God the
[22:02] anointing the seraphims each had six
[22:05] wings and they were crying what holy
[22:07] holy holy they had anointing of God
[22:10] there's a six-fold blessing Moses is
[22:13] given to give to Israel to bless them to
[22:16] keep them shine upon them the grace upon
[22:18] them the countenance upon them and peace
[22:21] Gabriel had a sixth full visit
[22:23] Hallelujah to Daniel and what was the
[22:26] last one what was the sixth reason out
[22:28] of the six reasons what was the sixth
[22:30] one to anoint the most holy amen
[22:32] hallelujah oh the Bible's an aspired
[22:35] book hallelujah amen hallelujah thank
[22:38] God
[22:39] in the six months of Elizabeth's
[22:41] pregnancy Gabriel visited Mary to
[22:43] conceive the would-be God man Christ
[22:46] Jesus to bring out to conceive the
[22:49] anointed man the fully anointed man that
[22:51] was to come Hallelujah Jesus Miracle
[22:54] changed six pots of water into wine
[22:57] six days before the Passover Mary
[22:59] anointed Jesus's feet the four creatures
[23:02] each had six wings and they were the
[23:05] anointing for each of each of those ages
[23:08] Hallelujah we've got the Flying Eagle
[23:10] anointing
[23:13] thank God Hallelujah the woman at the
[23:15] well had six husbands right but she met
[23:17] the anointed man after that sixth one
[23:19] praise God
[23:20] and Peter went up to pray about the
[23:22] sixth hour then he was anointed to see a
[23:24] great vision praise God
[23:26] there were six men on Mount
[23:27] Transfiguration praise God
[23:30] there are six raptures amen and we go in
[23:33] number five we go in the Rapture of
[23:35] Grace amen hallelujah thank God Amen
[23:38] Israel gets number six praise God
[23:40] hallelujah I'm sorry the two prophets
[23:42] rather the full armor of God has six
[23:45] elements to it the loins gird about with
[23:48] truth the breastplate the feet shod The
[23:50] Shield of Faith the helmet of salvation
[23:51] and the sword of the spirit praise God
[23:53] the sixth Church age Messenger to
[23:55] Philadelphia was John Wesley he was
[23:57] under the man anointing the anointed man
[24:00] praise God the sixth Church age brother
[24:03] Adam spoke six squirrels into existence
[24:05] he said as a confirmation of his
[24:07] ministry a confirmation that he was
[24:10] God's anointed Prophet but Abraham said
[24:13] on the sixth one he said this will be
[24:14] the six times that you've confirmed it
[24:16] to me Lord the number of man six times I
[24:18] said you won't let me miss him praise
[24:20] God
[24:21] hallelujah amen
[24:23] thank the Lord amen
[24:25] now this applies uh I want to share with
[24:28] I wanted Chris to see this but I guess I
[24:30] guess Leah and uh let's be new to I'm
[24:32] sorry Lena sorry sister Selena Leah
[24:35] and Emma by God's grace but numbers have
[24:38] meanings and numbers mean a lot you know
[24:40] to all of us but to me 11 means a lot to
[24:42] me I feel like 11 is like the last call
[24:46] for me uh
[24:47] in 2002 right after I came in the
[24:49] message
[24:50] uh Bill Tyler now he don't go to message
[24:52] church anymore but he sent me a letter
[24:54] in the mail this is before cell phones
[24:56] and really before we most of us had
[24:58] internet access
[25:00] he said I want to show you the
[25:01] similarities to number 11 in your life
[25:03] well in football I was number 11. my
[25:06] weight when uh when he saw my uh the
[25:08] website was nine plus one plus one was
[25:11] 11. my current weight when I preach this
[25:13] was 164. if you add those up makes 11. I
[25:17] was 163 this morning so I went and drank
[25:19] a kombucha I'm probably 164 right now
[25:23] I was like ah I'm one pound under
[25:24] something's wrong with me I better go
[25:26] drink some kombucha
[25:27] the September 11th attacks made Simon go
[25:30] to The Message Bible say which allowed
[25:32] Bill Tyler to write this to me I
[25:35] received a message in the 11th month and
[25:36] I was born in the 11th month
[25:39] here's the letter he wrote me back in
[25:40] 2002 I'm not going to go through it but
[25:42] he just said I hope and pray that every
[25:45] time you look at your football jersey
[25:46] you'll rejoice in the Lord for the
[25:49] Simplicity of Salvation he's offered to
[25:51] you by his grace
[25:52] Hallelujah there's my picture when he
[25:55] saw it
[25:56] why y'all laughing
[25:58] [Laughter]
[26:00] yeah as many moons ago 2002.
[26:03] that's 20 years ago right 20 years ago
[26:06] yeah 20 years ago
[26:07] so that's what he saw on the website and
[26:09] he said oh I see all the 11s here
[26:12] and of course that's my number so every
[26:14] time I look about that I think God
[26:16] called me to be 11. now Jesus said there
[26:19] were 11th Hour workers
[26:22] so 11 is also the last call
[26:26] and so I realized that uh God called me
[26:28] to be the last one of the last workers
[26:30] praise God the 11th Hour worker and
[26:33] brother Adam says I mean all these
[26:34] quotes there's all these quotes but I'll
[26:36] just go to this one
[26:37] now the seventh Angel's message
[26:39] Revelation 10 7 is to open the mystery
[26:41] of the seals calling the eleventh hour
[26:43] Gentile workers and I'm Gentile to I'm
[26:46] not Jewish to receive the same pay that
[26:49] the first uh workers got by God's grace
[26:52] amen
[26:54] the evening time he says and then there
[26:56] has to be an evening time message and to
[26:58] receive the same thing they did at the
[26:59] beginning the evening time message is to
[27:01] restore back again to bring back that
[27:03] same thing again so Austin I don't know
[27:04] if you saw it but there's all the 11s
[27:06] that this brother recognized about my
[27:07] life many many years 20 years ago by
[27:09] God's grace
[27:11] uh 11th month I was born 11th month I
[27:14] received the message September 11th
[27:15] allowed Simon to receive the message my
[27:18] football number my weight my everything
[27:20] like that so it just kind of goes all
[27:21] together you just look for God in your
[27:23] life now back to Jesus's six anointings
[27:25] Jesus had the anointing of the Holy
[27:27] Spirit but it manifested in six
[27:29] different ways
[27:30] uh
[27:32] the first one was wisdom and they asked
[27:34] Jesus should we pay taxes or not to
[27:36] Caesar and he said give to Caesar what
[27:38] Caesar's but give to God what's God's
[27:40] that was wisdom it showed them what to
[27:43] do with their money and how to do it
[27:45] with their money
[27:46] right they didn't cheat God nor did they
[27:48] cheat Caesar right they they fulfilled
[27:51] or they satisfied both requirements
[27:53] and the people were saying which one we
[27:55] can only satisfy one but Jesus said do
[27:57] both praise God
[27:59] now understanding actually means
[28:01] discernment
[28:03] so when the Bible said Jesus was
[28:05] anointed with the spirit of
[28:06] understanding it meant the spirit of
[28:07] discernment and he discerned both
[28:09] nathanael's Godless Spirit and the woman
[28:12] at the well her sexual immorality was
[28:15] six men so Jesus was able to discern the
[28:18] spirits
[28:21] now Jesus had the spirit of counsel as
[28:23] well
[28:24] now he plainly says it himself I counsel
[28:27] thee and he's talking to us Amen in the
[28:29] laity in church age amen I'm counseling
[28:32] bride of Christ Fellowship to buy gold
[28:34] tried in the fire
[28:37] so by means to hold on to right because
[28:39] the Bible said we can buy it without
[28:40] money or Price amen the Bible says buy
[28:43] the truth and sell it not Hallelujah
[28:47] so his counselors you need to invest in
[28:49] the truth amen
[28:50] by the truth make sure you hang on of
[28:53] anything else hang on to the truth of
[28:55] God's word amen
[28:57] buy gold buy white raiment which is
[29:00] Jesus's righteousness live a holy life
[29:01] amen don't live by your righteousness
[29:04] it'll never work live by the
[29:05] righteousness of Christ amen
[29:08] and anoint your eyes which is with eye
[29:10] Salvage Holy Spirit here it is the
[29:12] sermon that's what he's saying counsel
[29:14] to get the understanding of the Lord
[29:17] I'm counseling you to do this take my
[29:19] advice to take take my counsel here
[29:23] and make sure you have these three
[29:26] also go to this one here you know this
[29:28] is uh I love Jesus I go to Luke 12. I
[29:31] just want to spend a little just a
[29:32] moment on this Luke 12 13.
[29:36] now before we go to this Jesus had the
[29:38] spirit of counsel and I want you to
[29:41] notice Jesus leaves the decision up to
[29:43] this man
[29:45] I'm going to say that again
[29:47] Jesus did not tell this man what to do
[29:49] Jesus left the decision up to him in
[29:52] other words Jesus was letting this man
[29:53] pass the test and the church said
[29:56] there's going to be times God doesn't
[29:58] tell us exactly what to do he's going to
[30:00] leave it up to us to see if we'll pass
[30:02] the test or not
[30:04] look at the scripture here Luke 12 13.
[30:10] Jesus does not tell him how it's all
[30:12] going to work out
[30:14] Jesus didn't tell him about the
[30:15] inheritance this large sum of money
[30:18] he was whether he was going to get it or
[30:19] not
[30:20] now this kind of relates to how we were
[30:22] talking brother
[30:23] right I just thought it was I just
[30:25] thought you know this was interesting it
[30:26] was beautiful and you would think here
[30:28] he's got the fullness of God in him
[30:30] right the fullness of God is in Christ
[30:33] and Jesus doesn't tell him the right
[30:35] decision
[30:37] Jesus just counsels him on his attitude
[30:39] towards the situation
[30:41] now you would think all God Of Heaven
[30:43] would tell you okay do this go say that
[30:45] go say that and you can get your
[30:46] inheritance
[30:47] no
[30:48] Jesus realized this was a test of this
[30:51] man's character
[30:53] like brother Brandon said God doesn't
[30:54] always tell His prophets what do you
[30:56] want what he doesn't tell them
[30:57] everything
[30:58] he doesn't tell them because you've got
[31:00] to have something you've got to overcome
[31:02] you know remember brother Diggs sermon
[31:04] tested for a testimony
[31:07] here this man is being tested for his
[31:10] own testimony
[31:13] he wants to see what are you going to do
[31:14] about it
[31:15] God steps back and say here it's your
[31:18] choice I'm going to give you some
[31:19] counsel but I want to see what are you
[31:20] going to do about it
[31:21] what's your choice going to be about it
[31:24] in this case are you going to covet
[31:26] after the money
[31:27] or you're going to wait on the Lord
[31:30] you have a choice church we have a
[31:31] choice you're either going to covet
[31:33] after things or you're just going to
[31:35] trust God Church let's trust God
[31:38] the holy spirit is here to counsel us to
[31:41] trust him
[31:43] now there now for certain situations
[31:45] there may be situation situations where
[31:47] God makes something so plain to you so
[31:50] clear to you you've got thus saith the
[31:51] Lord on it right there are times like
[31:53] that but I just want to show you there's
[31:54] times that God doesn't tell us what's
[31:56] going to happen he's actually letting us
[31:58] make our own choice
[32:01] and he wants to see what we're going to
[32:03] do about it
[32:05] so Luke 12 13.
[32:08] bless you and one of the companies said
[32:10] to him Master speak to my brother that
[32:12] he divide the inheritance with me in
[32:15] other words give him a thus saith the
[32:16] Lord so I get my half of the money
[32:19] now what does Jesus say Jesus said yes
[32:21] sir I'll go rebuke him right away
[32:24] is that what he said
[32:25] no now could he have done that yes he
[32:29] could have said go get the money it's an
[32:30] officious mouth down there
[32:32] right Church
[32:34] because I got that money saved for you
[32:36] the fish swallowed it it's right there
[32:38] in the fish just like he did with Peter
[32:40] he could have spoken into existence
[32:43] but this was a test for the man not to
[32:46] be Covetous because Jesus was going to
[32:48] give him the right counsel praise God
[32:50] verse 14. they said to him man who made
[32:53] me a judge or divider over you
[32:58] right wow no really Jesus was the judge
[33:01] of all the universe
[33:03] but see we can tell Jesus knows the
[33:06] man's being selfish here
[33:08] he's coming with the wrong motive and
[33:10] objective because he just says well who
[33:11] made me the judge and ruler
[33:13] how do you know it's me
[33:15] how do you know I'm supposed to tell you
[33:18] verse 50 and he said to me take heed and
[33:21] beware of covetousness for a man's life
[33:23] consists not in the abundance of the
[33:25] things which he possesses end quote
[33:28] right that's the end of the story
[33:33] you know he doesn't Jesus doesn't say
[33:34] well here let me catch a vision from the
[33:36] father because I only do without which
[33:37] the father shows me let me get a vision
[33:39] from the father and tell you if you're
[33:40] going to get the money or not no it was
[33:41] a council session
[33:43] teacher sometimes we can't be
[33:45] discouraged if we don't get what we ask
[33:47] for
[33:48] we got it we got to be content with the
[33:50] wisdom and the counsel that God gives us
[33:52] because it may be God's test that we've
[33:54] got to pass
[33:56] right praise God
[33:59] all all the counts of the holy spirit
[34:01] gives this man is just beware that
[34:04] you're not a Covetous person
[34:07] I'm not going to force them to give you
[34:08] the money I'm not going to force you to
[34:09] get the inheritance I'm not going to
[34:11] force it to happen I'm not going to do
[34:12] what you ask me to do this time I'm
[34:14] gonna let you decide
[34:17] I'm going to let the events of this
[34:20] decision manifest if your spirit was
[34:22] right or not
[34:24] I'm not going to give you the direct
[34:25] answer on this one
[34:27] Hallelujah
[34:28] you would think my or if Jesus was
[34:31] really anointed he'd give me that
[34:32] inheritance right now
[34:34] no not exactly
[34:37] no he was fully anointed praise God
[34:39] Christ was fully anointed the fullness
[34:41] of the godhead bodily drought in him so
[34:43] but the spirit knew in this case God is
[34:45] going to test this man and he's going to
[34:47] say just give him counsel make him
[34:48] beware that he doesn't have a Covetous
[34:51] sinful heart
[34:53] see sometimes Church the voice of God is
[34:55] so gentle sometimes the voice of God is
[34:58] just saying be careful about your next
[35:00] step
[35:01] you know sometimes we think you know
[35:03] every service has to be like Wednesday
[35:04] night or you know or other services
[35:06] where God has dropped down and we feel
[35:08] the presence of God so strongly but
[35:10] there's times where we may just hear the
[35:12] counsel of God
[35:14] and it's still the same Holy Spirit
[35:16] not a different spirit this was not a
[35:19] weaker Jesus or a lesser it's the same
[35:21] Christ Hallelujah
[35:24] so in other words we have to be humble
[35:25] enough to accept the word of God in
[35:27] every situation
[35:29] and recognize God's spirit moving in
[35:32] every situation
[35:34] so I just thought that would be a
[35:36] blessing that really struck me this
[35:37] morning when I was studying I was like
[35:37] oh that's a beautiful thought
[35:39] that the holy spirit gives us counsel
[35:41] and sometimes he doesn't tell us exactly
[35:43] what to do so here we don't actually
[35:44] here we don't get any real like a wisdom
[35:46] direction do this do that go get the
[35:48] money here no it's just counsel beware
[35:51] that your heart doesn't become covetous
[35:55] Hallelujah
[35:57] so I wonder the next few Services here
[35:59] if God will just give us a beware sermon
[36:02] and that that would be fully annoying to
[36:04] the Holy Spirit just be aware not to do
[36:06] this
[36:08] beware not to let your heart get
[36:09] overcharged with the things of the world
[36:12] and it can be the same holy spirit that
[36:13] could heal the sick raise the dead give
[36:15] us a prophecy give us a dream amen
[36:17] hallelujah the same Holy Spirit
[36:20] would be able to give us the word of
[36:22] counsel that we have need of for the
[36:24] hour
[36:26] my this is what we all long to see
[36:28] praise God Amen we all enjoy when God
[36:31] moves in strength and mighty Deeds the
[36:33] Bible said he was mighty indeed and word
[36:35] before God Emma when she said she got
[36:38] the Holy Ghost in here didn't you say
[36:39] you felt a wind sister who has felt that
[36:41] wind in here hallelujah that's a
[36:43] beautiful day
[36:44] thank God Amen
[36:46] it's the might of God it's God's Mighty
[36:49] power blowing through his people amen
[36:51] hallelujah
[36:53] and we don't know when it's going to
[36:54] blow but I just suggest be here because
[36:57] it's going to happen sometime amen
[36:59] hallelujah because Christ is welcome
[37:01] here other churches he's kicked out of
[37:03] the church but Jesus is invited in here
[37:05] he's the guest of honor this morning
[37:07] amen
[37:08] Glory
[37:10] Jesus miracles his might was
[37:13] unparalleled and cannot be matched
[37:16] I don't care what anybody says they're
[37:17] not going to do any Greater Works than
[37:18] Jesus because it isn't them doing the
[37:21] Greater Works anyway it's Christ doing
[37:22] the Greater Works
[37:24] nobody's going to do greater than Jesus
[37:26] not a scripture on that in the Bible
[37:29] now his knowledge
[37:31] in John 7
[37:33] they hear Jesus preach and they say how
[37:36] knoweth this man these things how does
[37:39] this man have the knowledge and the
[37:40] Bible said Jesus said I did not get my
[37:42] Doctrine from man I got my Doctrine from
[37:44] above
[37:46] so there was an anointing on Christ he
[37:49] didn't have to go to Bible school he
[37:51] just had to go in the presence of God
[37:52] and God would show him the knowledge of
[37:54] God the truth of God's word and the men
[37:56] marveled how does he know this how does
[37:58] he know it it's an anointing that makes
[38:00] you know it praise God
[38:03] and sixth and finally the fear of the
[38:06] Lord Jesus's moral reverence
[38:10] is unmatched as well no man would ever
[38:13] will ever serve God like Christ did
[38:16] he always pleased the father and the
[38:19] Bible said he even submitted himself to
[38:22] the death of the cross
[38:24] this was an anointing that was on him
[38:27] Hallelujah
[38:29] now I'm not going to spend much time on
[38:31] this but I started to see a little bit
[38:33] of similarities between the anointings
[38:36] and then the six
[38:38] uh pieces of the armor of God like I can
[38:41] see how wisdom is like a mind gird about
[38:43] with truth and I can see how might is
[38:45] like the spirit sword of the spirit
[38:46] right it's power
[38:48] and the shield of faith is like kind of
[38:50] like the fear of the Lord right because
[38:51] when you have the shield of Faith you're
[38:53] not getting hit by the enemy's darts
[38:55] amen you're not giving in to the sinful
[38:57] attacks the church said
[38:59] if you pull up your Shield you get you
[39:01] get attacked you you set yourself up to
[39:03] be infected with sin
[39:06] right but when you got the fear of the
[39:07] Lord you depart from Evil praise God
[39:11] now all the other ones so I I saw like
[39:13] four similarities I guess one two three
[39:16] yeah four similarities
[39:18] and I'm not really ready to preach that
[39:20] full thought but I think it's a
[39:21] beautiful thought praise God I do now
[39:24] like Jesus church we must Delight in
[39:26] God's word
[39:27] and I know you do because you sit
[39:29] through all these long sermons you sing
[39:31] all these wonderful songs with our
[39:32] brother praise God you wouldn't come
[39:34] here three times a week if you didn't
[39:35] Delight in God's word but what we have
[39:37] to remind remember is that we need to
[39:38] Delight in God's word every day
[39:40] and that's why we come here so to
[39:42] encourage us to do it every single day
[39:44] and church then there are times where
[39:46] even me all of us we maybe don't feel
[39:48] like coming to church
[39:50] I don't expect you to say Amen on that
[39:52] way
[39:54] there's sometimes I'm feeling sick or
[39:55] I'm really tired I really don't feel
[39:57] like coming I'd rather take a nap and
[39:59] call off can we get a substitute for
[40:01] tonight here
[40:02] foreign
[40:03] we all be like that at times
[40:06] but we must remember that that we need
[40:08] God's help to renew our strength
[40:11] we need God's help to remove renew our
[40:13] minds every day so that the word of God
[40:15] is more delightful than the next YouTube
[40:17] video
[40:18] right
[40:19] the word of God is more delightful than
[40:21] the next podcast
[40:23] or whatever we might Delight in or the
[40:25] next raise we get on the job you know
[40:27] or the next unexpected Financial
[40:29] blessing in which we blame God for
[40:31] but we got to make sure God's word is
[40:33] our number one divide praise God it's a
[40:36] joy of our life
[40:37] like I said that's why I started getting
[40:39] up at 4 30. now I'm getting up at four
[40:40] I'm just waking up at four every morning
[40:42] I want to make sure God's word is my
[40:44] delight
[40:45] now I like it too because it makes me go
[40:47] to bed earlier so I'll do like that
[40:48] praise God I want to make sure I say
[40:49] that Hallelujah I need to get better
[40:51] earlier
[40:52] now here's what it says about Christ
[40:54] Praise You the Lord blessed is the man
[40:56] that feared the Lord
[40:58] greatly in the commands Hallelujah
[41:01] his seed shall be Mighty on the earth
[41:03] the generation of the upright shall be
[41:05] blessed wealth and riches shall be in
[41:07] his health and and his righteousness
[41:09] endureth forever of course this is
[41:11] speaking of Christ the seed of Christ
[41:14] the children of Christ would be blessed
[41:16] and they're Mighty in word hallelujah
[41:18] they're Mighty indeed amen but this also
[41:21] applies to the Natural man so I didn't
[41:23] get I didn't get time to look this up
[41:24] but Jonathan Edwards was a mighty
[41:26] preacher in the 1800s and they trace his
[41:28] descendants I shared it maybe last year
[41:30] but there was like uh like there was one
[41:32] vice president in his lineage there was
[41:34] like 50 preachers in his lineage there
[41:36] was like 40 lawyers and there was like a
[41:39] 30 University presidents in other words
[41:43] this man loved God so much the Bible
[41:45] said that he delighted so much in the
[41:47] word of God that the blessing went from
[41:49] him to the Next Generation
[41:52] and that's all we have responsibility
[41:53] for church is our lives and the Next
[41:56] Generation praise God I'm going to
[41:58] preach on David and Solomon Lord willing
[42:00] pretty soon Church David did most of the
[42:02] hard work he stored up all the stones
[42:05] all the iron all the wood he stored up
[42:08] all most of all these things and he
[42:10] didn't even live to see what he was
[42:12] storing up for church that might be us
[42:14] we might not live to see the Rapture but
[42:17] if we're faithful like David then our
[42:19] Our Generation after or the generation
[42:21] after that or of Generations on down the
[42:24] line if we're faithful then one of these
[42:26] Generations will will see the coming of
[42:28] the Lord they'll be blessed because of
[42:30] our dedication amen
[42:32] as we're blessed by our brother
[42:33] branham's dedication
[42:35] Hallelujah
[42:36] and Paul an iranius and Martin and
[42:38] Luther and Columbo Hallelujah Wesley and
[42:41] each one we're blessed because of
[42:44] previous generations staying true to the
[42:46] word of God but we've got to make sure
[42:48] the Commandments of God are our Delight
[42:53] Hallelujah
[42:55] so we're looking at the Delight
[42:57] and of course this David wrote this this
[42:59] is speaking of Christ blessed is the man
[43:01] that walketh not in the cons of the
[43:03] ungodly
[43:04] think of that Jesus never took a bad
[43:07] advice from anybody
[43:09] the devil said Bow Down and Worship me
[43:10] he wouldn't take the devil's advice God
[43:12] help us not to take the devil's advice
[43:14] oh get back at that person or I'll show
[43:16] you how to do this I'll show you I'll
[43:18] show you how to do this this uh this
[43:20] dishonest deal here
[43:22] God help us to take the counsel of
[43:24] Christ amen
[43:26] blessed is a man who nor standeth in the
[43:28] way of Sinners nor sinneth than to see
[43:29] the scornful his Delight is in the law
[43:31] of the Lord and in his law does he
[43:34] meditate day and night oh constantly
[43:36] he's thinking about the word in the
[43:38] morning he's thinking about the word at
[43:39] noon time he's thinking about the word
[43:40] at night that's what we must be our
[43:42] Delight must be in the law of God
[43:44] hallelujah
[43:46] and he shall be like a tree planted by
[43:47] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[43:49] fruit in his season his leave also shall
[43:52] not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[43:55] prosper what a promise Hallelujah
[43:58] see Church remember I showed you that
[43:59] picture let me go back and show Emma
[44:01] because she could you see it on
[44:03] Wednesday night okay
[44:05] uh the the image that they give us in
[44:08] the Bible
[44:09] is uh
[44:11] the fear of the Lord is like a spring or
[44:13] a fountain of waters this is the gihan
[44:14] spring it's under uh Mount Zion it's
[44:18] under Mount Zion or Mount Moriah rather
[44:19] in Israel
[44:22] so Hezekiah uses spring lots of lots of
[44:24] saints use this spring
[44:26] and of course it's down and under here
[44:28] so this is going up to the Mount Moriah
[44:30] the Temple mount
[44:33] uh
[44:34] where's my other picture uh there it is
[44:36] so the Bible said the the fear of God is
[44:39] like this spring of water it's life
[44:42] but you can't but you're never going to
[44:45] have wisdom unless you stay planted in
[44:46] the fear of the Lord
[44:48] so this is the imagery of our life we're
[44:50] like the trees Christ was the Holy tree
[44:53] praise God Amen Christ was the tree that
[44:55] was planted by rivers of a living water
[44:57] he did not sit in the Council of the
[44:59] Pharisees just like we don't sit in the
[45:01] Council of Baptists or Presbyterian amen
[45:03] thank God I used to amen thank God I
[45:06] don't praise God but we sit in the
[45:08] Council of the Holy Spirit praise God
[45:11] and we pull from the fear of the Lord
[45:13] how many are you drawing from the fear
[45:15] of the Lord today praise God
[45:17] you're drinking in the power of the holy
[45:19] spirit in the fear of the Lord I'm gonna
[45:21] I'm gonna reverence God's word I'm going
[45:23] to keep God's word when you draw that in
[45:25] then you produce the fruits of the
[45:27] spirit
[45:28] Hallelujah that's a good visual there
[45:32] the only way we'll get to the wise life
[45:34] the only way we'll get to the principal
[45:36] thing wisdom is by drawing on the fear
[45:40] of the Lord drawing it in and make sure
[45:42] we're rooted and grounded in Christ's
[45:44] love amen glory amen rooted in gardening
[45:47] in Christ's love
[45:49] I can't promise I'll get to the right
[45:51] slide here
[45:54] thank you for your patience here
[45:59] yeah there we go
[46:03] so this speaks of both David also Christ
[46:06] and also us well we've got to keep the
[46:09] word of God in our mind all the time
[46:11] that's what I love about making YouTube
[46:12] videos or just being a preacher I've
[46:14] always got three or four different
[46:15] thoughts kind of turning in my mind you
[46:17] know this week I put out four reasons I
[46:19] don't have a Christmas tree I just put
[46:20] that up video I got some good feedback
[46:21] on that amen hallelujah
[46:24] also put out uh
[46:26] I could put a podcast out a solo one
[46:29] last week about these questions that a
[46:31] preacher asked me about brother Branham
[46:33] and so I was defending the message there
[46:34] got a lot of good feedback on that but
[46:36] that's what I love about being a
[46:37] preacher I I just I have to I have to
[46:39] stay with new fresh thoughts all the
[46:41] time I always got like three or four uh
[46:43] wheels turning you know I guess I guess
[46:45] it's like a vehicle yeah right I got
[46:47] four wheels turned on all the time so I
[46:48] always got like four thoughts I got four
[46:50] Series going right four or five series
[46:51] going at the same time
[46:53] uh but I love that because it just makes
[46:56] me meditate I'm always looking for a
[46:57] fresh thought I'm always looking for
[46:59] fresh Revelation praise God and my mind
[47:02] and your mind meditates on the things of
[47:04] God
[47:06] oh it's a blessing church it's such a
[47:08] blessing to meditate on the things of
[47:09] God why would we meditate on on on on on
[47:12] any sin
[47:14] why would he meditate on destruction why
[47:17] would we meditate on failure why would
[47:19] we meditate uh on hatred why would we
[47:22] meditate on these things when we can
[47:24] meditate on the word of God hallelujah
[47:26] the promises of God thank God Hallelujah
[47:29] my that's how I tell my children we were
[47:31] reading a about the church ages last
[47:34] night
[47:35] and I love reading about these men and
[47:36] women that gave their lives I love
[47:38] reading about Martyrs my
[47:41] because with pilot carp he was a hundred
[47:43] and they said part of the car weird
[47:45] they're going to kill you or kill all
[47:46] the Christians the polycarp has 100 year
[47:48] old man he stepped forward and said kill
[47:49] me now what a man of God right there
[47:52] I'd rather you take my life than take
[47:54] their lives
[47:56] and while he was walking and we read it
[47:58] a couple weeks ago while he was walking
[48:00] to the stake they said denounce Christ
[48:02] and die denounce Christ that was Christ
[48:04] and you'll live yeah live rather
[48:07] and he said I've served Jesus Christ for
[48:10] 80 some years and he has been he's done

[48:14] him in my last moment amen thank God
[48:17] Amen
[48:18] amen and they they lit the fire it
[48:20] wouldn't burn him
[48:21] right so then they stabbed him with the
[48:23] spear all the blood gushed out and put
[48:24] out the fire
[48:27] right and so then they uh they killed
[48:29] him and then
[48:30] they chopped him up burned them up and
[48:33] took all the ashes and threw it in the
[48:35] in the river because he was so much like
[48:37] Christ
[48:38] they didn't want his disciples to say
[48:40] that he raised from the dead because he
[48:42] was so much like Jesus a church that
[48:44] Inspire us that ought to inspire us no
[48:46] matter what we're going through we're
[48:47] not going to the stakes yet we're not
[48:49] being burned to Stakes God help us not
[48:50] to compromise on any word of God praise
[48:52] God these are our forefathers these are
[48:55] the ones that fear God and generations
[48:57] past let us make our Delight in the law

[49:03] their squeeze hour it'll keep us in our
[49:05] squeeze our amen

[49:09] delight yourself right at Christ
[49:11] Fellowship in the Lord

[49:15] thine heart
[49:17] Delight means to be happy about be happy
[49:19] about the word
[49:20] now I know it cuts you sometimes but but
[49:23] after you apply that balm and Gilead
[49:24] then you're happy again
[49:26] that's what brother Adam said the word
[49:27] preaches like a sword when it chops you
[49:29] up or Cuts you up oh that hurt but then
[49:32] you pray say God forgive me and then God
[49:33] puts on the bomb of Gilead
[49:36] the healing ointment
[49:38] that helps you that helps your heart
[49:40] heal
[49:41] and then with love you can say thank you

[51:23] God will move upon your request
[51:27] but again we've got to trust that God's
[51:29] decision for our life is better than our
[51:31] hopes and desires

[51:35] righteousness as the light

[52:40] okay I don't know
[52:42] only God knows what I mean by that is
[52:44] that uh we cannot limit the Holy One of
[52:47] Israel cannot limit Jesus right God is
[52:49] Without Limits the Bible says now notice
[52:51] there's diversities of gifts but it's
[52:54] the same spirit
[52:55] every gift is a little different
[52:57] there are differences of administrations
[52:59] or services
[53:01] or Ministries in other words like
[53:03] brother man I said one Divine Healing
[53:04] Ministry is different from another
[53:06] right that means One Pastor might be
[53:09] different than another pastor
[53:12] there's diversities of operation
[53:14] different way they work different
[53:15] workings of the spirit
[53:18] but the same God that works all in all
[53:21] and the way to know it's God is if at
[53:23] first lines up with the word and then it
[53:25] has good results amen yeah
[53:28] that's right that's how you know if it's
[53:30] God
[53:32] but Ram actually said it like this he
[53:34] said first I'll show it in a moment he
[53:35] said first get in the spirit
[53:37] he said then get a revelation
[53:39] then look for in the word and then look
[53:41] at the results that it bears
[53:43] and brother amen shared that about
[53:45] getting the spirit a couple months ago
[53:46] right and you and your wife
[53:48] so it's the spirit that creates all
[53:50] these continents they're all
[53:51] complementary in other words one
[53:53] Christian is going to be happy for
[53:54] another Christian when they have their
[53:55] gifts operating
[53:57] right or when they're when they're
[53:58] serving in their Ministry one Christian
[54:00] is going to be so happy
[54:02] like when I see Austin singing and
[54:03] playing I bought on that guitar or we
[54:05] got on that guitar it just makes me so
[54:06] happy I couldn't be more happy praise
[54:08] God see a mouth guy play there you know
[54:09] just Lydia each one finding your little
[54:12] gifts of the kids singing a special our
[54:14] God is tremendous you know whatever
[54:16] when we're using our gifts we all
[54:18] Rejoice because all the gifts help one
[54:20] another they all complement each other
[54:22] they all build each other up it's the
[54:24] same Spirit same anointing praise God
[54:27] one Spirit operating in different ways
[54:30] but it all brings about the right
[54:32] results
[54:34] so I just made this just as a just as a
[54:36] simple visual there's one Holy Ghost
[54:38] right but he's got five preaching gifts
[54:40] why five why not seven well I don't know
[54:42] I can't limit God
[54:45] he's got six pieces of armor there are
[54:47] six anointings on Jesus why not seven I
[54:49] don't know all I know is I'm not gonna
[54:51] limit God
[54:53] there's one Holy Ghost but there's seven
[54:54] Holy Spirits the Bible said seven fires
[54:57] Before the Throne but right brother said
[54:58] that's one that's the Holy Spirit
[55:00] Ministry to each of the seven Church
[55:01] ages
[55:02] so it's the same Holy Spirit but God had
[55:04] to send uh a different little
[55:06] characteristic of it to every age
[55:10] right and what's our what's our
[55:11] experience for today be zealous and
[55:13] repent
[55:14] and say hot for Jesus and the church
[55:16] said
[55:17] don't be lukewarm this is not the time
[55:19] to be lukewarm delight yourself in the
[55:21] Lord amen be happy in the Lord praise
[55:24] God Amen
[55:25] be happy in the Lord Seven eyes of
[55:28] course Jesus said those seven spirits
[55:29] roaming the Earth Holy Spirit seven
[55:31] horns seven Powers seven Messengers
[55:33] seven attributes in the Statue of man
[55:35] and then there's the eighth charity why
[55:37] why eight I don't know brother I don't
[55:39] know sister I don't know brother
[55:40] I can't limit God how come there's nine
[55:42] fruits of the spirit and not seven
[55:44] I don't know
[55:45] God's got a different God can do
[55:47] whatever he wants praise God I'm just
[55:49] learning how much little I do know about
[55:50] God
[55:52] but I want to meditate I want to Delight
[55:54] in this word I want to think about it
[55:56] all day praise God all day
[55:59] all day and night
[56:01] no I've been trying to get down to the
[56:03] base place to close here
[56:05] I never set a timer okay well that's all
[56:07] right
[56:09] I rarely keep it anyway right if I
[56:11] should say that
[56:12] here Brad I never had to laugh on that
[56:14] yeah I want to add some more I didn't
[56:16] have enough time uh well you know I
[56:18] always get
[56:19] I just tell my wife you'll say sometimes
[56:20] like this during the studying it just
[56:22] flows flows flows I said hallelujah
[56:23] thank you God I have so much and
[56:24] sometimes I'm just like waiting on the
[56:25] Lord like I'm really trying to
[56:27] scratching my head I'm not sure which
[56:28] way to go with this
[56:29] so yesterday I was one of those
[56:30] scratching the head days you know but
[56:32] anyways I trust has been a blessing to
[56:34] you so far by God's grace
[56:35] I just felt like it maybe maybe it was
[56:37] different than that but that's you know
[56:38] can't trust your feelings
[56:40] uh the fear of the Lord has learned now
[56:41] this is ought to help us out a lot here
[56:42] this is a beautiful scripture now God's
[56:44] talking to Israel church but we know we
[56:46] can see the spiritual element to this
[56:49] what nation is there so great who hath
[56:51] God so nigh unto them
[56:53] as the Lord Our God in all things is in
[56:56] all things that we call upon him for
[56:58] now think about a church what church is
[57:01] there like our church is there any
[57:02] denomination of church like our church
[57:04] who has God so nigh unto them I believe
[57:07] answer is no on that why because we've
[57:09] been to other churches
[57:10] and we don't see God there
[57:12] we don't see God Discerning counseling
[57:14] we don't see just worldly Council
[57:17] sinful things
[57:19] so first of all consider how blessed you
[57:21] are because God Is So Close To You amen
[57:23] thank God Amen
[57:25] Jesus Christ is not outside of our
[57:27] church he's the welcome guest as we
[57:29] already said he's the Lord of this
[57:31] church he's the real pastor of this
[57:33] church amen he's the real evangelist in
[57:35] this church
[57:36] Jesus is
[57:41] but God had Moses tell the people only
[57:44] take heed to yourself see you can't
[57:46] force anybody to be saved he said you
[57:48] take care of yourself
[57:50] you live such a life you have such a
[57:52] life of let the light of God shine a
[57:54] Noonday amen through your life
[57:57] take heed to yourself and keep your soul
[57:58] diligently lest thou forget the things
[58:01] which thy thine eyes have seen don't
[58:03] forget all those testimonies God's given
[58:04] you
[58:05] Hallelujah all the times you've seen God
[58:07] move I know that's God
[58:10] be careful do not forget those
[58:12] testimonies lest they look they depart
[58:15] from your heart
[58:17] all the days of our life
[58:20] see we can't forget all those times God
[58:23] like we said with isolation God
[58:24] sometimes is going to isolate you just
[58:26] to see if you will you'll you'll trust
[58:28] him and just remember all the things he
[58:30] has done even when it seems like even
[58:32] when I don't feel it he's working you
[58:34] know I mean that's a good sign that's
[58:35] true that's true
[58:37] but there's times when you don't really
[58:38] see it or feel it and God wants you to
[58:41] in those times remember the good times
[58:44] well remember the times when God was
[58:46] moving strongly or more actively
[58:50] if you don't Church they're going to
[58:52] depart out of your life
[58:54] and that's when the Bible says you'll
[58:55] for you you'll forget you were even
[58:57] forgiven in second Peter chapter one
[58:59] if you don't do those statutory man if
[59:01] you don't live the gospel live under
[59:02] that anointing you're going to forget
[59:04] all those testimonies that God did in
[59:05] your life
[59:08] by God's grace he won't let us forget
[59:10] praise God I won't say me it's not that
[59:13] I won't let you forget it's the holy
[59:14] spirit that won't let us forget
[59:16] that's right
[59:19] he says and teach them to thy sons and
[59:21] thy Sons Sons especially the day that
[59:23] thou serves before the Lord thy God when
[59:25] the Lord said unto me gather me the
[59:27] people together and I'll make them hear
[59:29] my words now I forgot to bold this but
[59:30] that's why I wanted to bold just so you
[59:32] know that they may what learn to fear me
[59:35] all the days that they shall live upon
[59:38] the Earth and that they may teach their
[59:40] children
[59:42] so I'm glad the Holy Spirit had me
[59:44] revisit this topic because it was
[59:46] greatly
[59:47] uh
[59:49] greatly thanks I guess over the numerous
[59:51] testimonies that we got
[59:54] because we should all know in our hearts
[59:57] today I'm here to learn to fear God more
[1:00:00] I want to fear God more so I don't
[1:00:03] forget about him
[1:00:05] in other words you should be here not to
[1:00:07] not to necessarily pick apart my
[1:00:09] mistakes I know you don't do that I'm
[1:00:11] just trying to give you an example you
[1:00:12] know we're here to learn of God Amen
[1:00:14] thank God Amen we're here to learn how
[1:00:18] to fear God how to morally reverence him
[1:00:22] that's why we're here
[1:00:24] how can I obey God more in my daily life
[1:00:27] how can I meditate on the things of God
[1:00:29] more
[1:00:30] and I found it getting up early reading
[1:00:32] praying singing
[1:00:34] you know when I wash dishes or whatever
[1:00:35] I just put on the music I just try to
[1:00:37] sing and give God praise and stay under
[1:00:40] that atmosphere standard that anointing
[1:00:41] by God's grace I need to learn I'm still
[1:00:44] learning I'm still learning how to fear
[1:00:46] the lord in my life
[1:00:48] and that's what God told Moses you tell
[1:00:50] those people
[1:00:51] remind them to fear God all the days of
[1:00:54] their life
[1:00:55] that they will learn to fear me and that
[1:00:58] they will teach their children teach the
[1:01:01] Next Generation how to fear God as well
[1:01:03] Hallelujah
[1:01:05] and of course church this is a choice
[1:01:07] you have to make
[1:01:09] every person today you're either going
[1:01:11] to leave out of here like brother Brian
[1:01:12] said to remind us of brother Adam's
[1:01:14] quote you're going to leave out of here
[1:01:15] a better Christian or worse
[1:01:17] right you can't say you can't say the
[1:01:19] same
[1:01:21] and the Bible says that in Proverbs one
[1:01:23] remember in Proverbs 1 lady wisdom is
[1:01:25] crying out
[1:01:27] uh to the streets and inviting anyone to
[1:01:30] come in and hear the word of God but the
[1:01:32] Bible said they turned her down
[1:01:34] so then in verse 28 then shall they call
[1:01:36] upon me but I will not answer they shall
[1:01:38] seek me early but shall not find me
[1:01:41] for that they hated knowledge and did
[1:01:43] not choose the fear of the Lord
[1:01:46] they did not choose it
[1:01:48] they would none of my counsel they
[1:01:51] despise all my reproof
[1:01:54] a church I'll say it again like I said
[1:01:55] last Sunday I think if we're not
[1:01:56] mistaken a real child of God doesn't
[1:01:59] mind being corrected by the word of God
[1:02:02] if you tell them something they're wrong
[1:02:03] on or something they could improve a
[1:02:05] real child of God isn't going to get mad
[1:02:07] at you now they might in the flesh
[1:02:09] but once they get back in their soul
[1:02:11] they're going to thank you for it the
[1:02:12] Bible said they'll love you if you
[1:02:13] correct them
[1:02:15] Hallelujah
[1:02:17] every time brother Brooks had to correct
[1:02:18] me or anytime brother Craig had to
[1:02:20] correct me in a Bible study or anything
[1:02:22] I said oh praise the Lord I appreciate
[1:02:23] that thank you
[1:02:25] Hallelujah
[1:02:28] or even simple things like brother amen
[1:02:29] requested last year you know can you uh
[1:02:32] can you uh I think you said can you ask
[1:02:34] if you have a leading of the Lord right
[1:02:36] after the song service and so I've done
[1:02:38] that see now I try to model that as an
[1:02:42] example if I can learn then you can
[1:02:44] learn to
[1:02:45] we all can learn by the Holy Spirit
[1:02:49] and that's how we know we love each
[1:02:50] other the Bible says when we submit
[1:02:52] ourselves one to another
[1:02:54] right
[1:02:55] when we're patient with one another
[1:02:57] loving long-suffering praise God that's
[1:03:00] how we know we love each other
[1:03:03] the Bible said therefore they shall eat
[1:03:05] of the fruit of their own way and be
[1:03:07] filled with their own devices that ought
[1:03:09] to encourages praise God if we're living
[1:03:11] the right way we know God's going to
[1:03:13] feed us the right fruit praise God if
[1:03:15] we're planting the right seeds
[1:03:17] hallelujah we're going to reap the right
[1:03:18] Harvest hallelujah amen that's what Paul
[1:03:21] said he said I he said I don't guess I
[1:03:23] have a crown he said I know I've got a
[1:03:26] crown of righteousness amen it's laid up
[1:03:28] for me and all those that love God's
[1:03:30] appearing praise God
[1:03:32] he's like I'm not guessing if I have any
[1:03:34] fruits he knew he had fruits of the
[1:03:36] spirit praise God he knew he had fruits
[1:03:38] and rewards that were laid up for him in
[1:03:40] heaven praise God
[1:03:42] I'm coming up on an hour so here let me
[1:03:43] set a five minute timer I'll try to
[1:03:44] close here
[1:03:49] Hallelujah
[1:03:52] yeah so here I think I'll close to this
[1:03:54] now let me escape real quick I think
[1:03:55] there was another thing I wanted to show
[1:03:58] yeah those are all just notes
[1:04:02] all right so bear with me here oh yeah
[1:04:04] yeah let me do this too I'm sorry I got
[1:04:06] a couple more things here
[1:04:09] okay now this is how we know God is
[1:04:11] talking to us if we don't hear a voice
[1:04:14] and even if your voice you got to check
[1:04:15] it by the word
[1:04:17] right brother Adam said I was in the
[1:04:19] spirit isn't that just beautiful I love
[1:04:21] that you could just call those words the
[1:04:23] whole of the Christian Life see in the
[1:04:25] spirit means if you're the Lord right
[1:04:26] because that's part of the Holy Spirit
[1:04:28] if we're going to live as Christians we
[1:04:29] have to be in his spirit so in his
[1:04:31] Spirit we have to be in his Spirit of
[1:04:33] Godly fear
[1:04:35] John was not talking about being in his
[1:04:37] own spirit I don't want to be in the
[1:04:38] spirit of Jesse Smith right that's
[1:04:40] that's going to fail me every time it's
[1:04:42] going to be discouraging it's going to
[1:04:43] be sad it's going to be whatever
[1:04:45] that would happen not brought about
[1:04:47] these Visions it had to be the spirit
[1:04:49] uh of God it had to be the spirit of God
[1:04:52] with us too or all of our efforts are in
[1:04:55] vain think about that all the efforts of
[1:04:56] uh denominations or even message
[1:04:58] churches is in vain unless they're in
[1:05:01] the Holy Spirit
[1:05:03] Paul said I'll pray in the spirit I'll
[1:05:05] sing in the spirit I'll live in the
[1:05:06] spirit how important is for brother amen
[1:05:08] a song leader to be in the Holy Spirit
[1:05:09] when he leads songs
[1:05:11] how important it is for me to be in the
[1:05:13] holy spirit before I preach the word of
[1:05:15] God
[1:05:16] Hallelujah
[1:05:20] if there is anything everybody's
[1:05:23] everybody say the word anything ready
[1:05:24] and if there's anything that will come
[1:05:27] to you that's good it must be first
[1:05:29] revealed by the Holy Spirit
[1:05:31] you must get a revelation from the
[1:05:32] spirit
[1:05:33] and then two you must confirm it by the
[1:05:35] word
[1:05:37] and three it will be made manifest by
[1:05:40] the results it bears
[1:05:45] as surely as John needed to be in the
[1:05:46] spirit to receive these tremendous
[1:05:48] Revelations fresh from Jesus we need to
[1:05:51] be in the spirit to understand the
[1:05:52] revelations that God has given to us to
[1:05:54] live by in his word for it is the same
[1:05:57] spirit
[1:05:58] Glory
[1:06:00] so these are three easy steps right to
[1:06:02] know you're hearing God's voice
[1:06:04] this is a good way to know you're in the
[1:06:06] fear of the Lord
[1:06:08] well brother Jesse you know I'm in the
[1:06:09] fear of the Lord or even myself I'm in
[1:06:11] the fear of the Lord but this decision
[1:06:12] to make well here's what you do first
[1:06:14] get in the spirit get in the fear of the
[1:06:15] Lord
[1:06:16] or the joy of the Lord same it's the
[1:06:19] same spirit
[1:06:21] and then wait till God gives you a
[1:06:23] revelation but then you're not done oh I
[1:06:25] feel something I just thought of
[1:06:27] something oh this is not a dream right a
[1:06:28] vision or I heard something preach it
[1:06:31] was a revelation you're not done yet
[1:06:33] everybody say not done yet not done yet
[1:06:35] you're not done yet
[1:06:37] whatever comes to you we must test it by
[1:06:40] the word of God
[1:06:42] make sure it lines up line for line with
[1:06:44] the word of God here little there little
[1:06:46] right line upon line
[1:06:49] and then sometimes we won't know until
[1:06:52] after we make the decision and then we
[1:06:54] can see this was let of God or not let
[1:06:56] of God
[1:06:58] it's made manifest by the results that
[1:07:00] it bears
[1:07:01] Hallelujah
[1:07:03] and so for me you know as a pastor it's
[1:07:05] very easy for me to see this I'll come
[1:07:07] and preach something
[1:07:09] and then I'll look at the results that
[1:07:11] it bears in our lives
[1:07:12] that's what I love about being a pastor
[1:07:14] by the way hallelujah or just a preacher
[1:07:16] in general I can see the results now
[1:07:18] sometimes they're immediate sometimes
[1:07:19] they're not
[1:07:21] but over the course of you know years of
[1:07:23] ministry I can see the results your
[1:07:25] lives like rubber band said your lives
[1:07:27] are the proof of the ministry
[1:07:30] my preaching has produced by preaching
[1:07:32] by the word of God has produced the Amen
[1:07:34] in ahuah right
[1:07:35] or my children or each family here the
[1:07:38] preaching has produced the life that you
[1:07:40] live and so as a preacher I thank God
[1:07:42] for that I can look at the fruit of my
[1:07:46] constant Ministry but each one of us can
[1:07:49] look at the fruit of our decision making
[1:07:51] praise God
[1:07:53] and then we can know did we hear the
[1:07:55] voice of God on that
[1:07:56] we really hear the voice like that
[1:07:58] isolation I was driving home from
[1:07:59] Indiana and the word just came to me
[1:08:00] isolation
[1:08:02] just came isolation right
[1:08:04] and I saw the results that at Bower
[1:08:06] praise God hopefully it was a blessing
[1:08:08] to people I know it seemed like it was
[1:08:10] for what people said
[1:08:13] and so we have these steps by God's
[1:08:15] grace
[1:08:17] now I'm going to close okay
[1:08:20] so let's end with this summary here
[1:08:24] now I might have left some I know I left
[1:08:25] Proverbs too I remember Proverbs 2 on
[1:08:27] Wednesday the Bible said if you want to
[1:08:29] understand the fear of the Lord you have
[1:08:31] to cry out and lift your voice to God
[1:08:34] in church you don't it can be it could
[1:08:36] be in your car
[1:08:37] you can cry out to God any location
[1:08:40] any location cry out to God say God I
[1:08:43] need wisdom I need understanding I'm I'm
[1:08:45] asking you give me give me Grace to know
[1:08:47] which way to go give me Grace how to
[1:08:49] work this out how do I solve this
[1:08:51] and if you cry out to God the Bible said
[1:08:53] you'll find the fear of the Lord
[1:08:55] you'll find the knowledge of the Lord
[1:08:58] so
[1:08:59] fear is found through dedicated prayer
[1:09:02] right or just calling out to God
[1:09:05] fear is your anointing and the church
[1:09:07] said
[1:09:09] fear is your moral reverence and honor
[1:09:11] for God's word that's really what the
[1:09:13] word means
[1:09:15] morally reverencing God morally honoring
[1:09:18] God with obedience
[1:09:21] fear is also you're confident when
[1:09:23] you're obeying God's word you're not
[1:09:24] disobedient you have confidence in God
[1:09:27] if our hearts condemn us not amen we
[1:09:29] know we shall have what we ask for
[1:09:31] praise God
[1:09:33] fear is also your place of safety enough
[1:09:35] and that's funny to say that fear is
[1:09:37] your place of safety because we think of
[1:09:39] instantly human fear right
[1:09:42] but it's the fear of the Lord more
[1:09:43] obedience in other words obedience is
[1:09:45] your place of safety
[1:09:48] fear is your
[1:09:50] prerequisite sorry prerequisite for
[1:09:53] wisdom
[1:09:55] fear is your Fountain of Life
[1:09:58] fear is also your choice amen
[1:10:02] Hallelujah
[1:10:03] fears a conclusion about your life's
[1:10:06] purpose
[1:10:07] fear is your lesson you must learn
[1:10:12] I'm not sure how many more things fear
[1:10:13] could be I know there's more I didn't
[1:10:14] get to them
[1:10:16] fear is your path to Blessings
[1:10:20] and fear is your path to being praised
[1:10:23] by God
[1:10:24] because the Bible said a woman that
[1:10:26] fears the Lord shall be
[1:10:28] praised
[1:10:30] brother Graham said there's nothing more
[1:10:31] humans like than to hear their voice
[1:10:34] announced before people and recognize
[1:10:36] and this you know you don't have to say
[1:10:38] Amen to that but that's true
[1:10:40] that's why all the musicians like this
[1:10:41] to fill up the stadiums and oh Taylor
[1:10:44] Swift or Jay-Z like they love to hear
[1:10:46] their name called in front of people who
[1:10:47] doesn't
[1:10:50] but there will be no greater calling of
[1:10:52] a name
[1:10:53] right than the marriage supper the Lambs
[1:10:57] right when what the Bible says when we
[1:10:59] stand before the Judgment seat of Christ
[1:11:01] for rewards given out to us
[1:11:04] Hallelujah
[1:11:06] he that feareth the Lord she that fears
[1:11:08] the Lord shall be praised and Jesus is
[1:11:11] going to praise Us by saying well done
[1:11:14] well done good and faithful servant
[1:11:18] so fear is what a lot of things
[1:11:22] fear is foundational
[1:11:24] you need that at the beginning of your
[1:11:25] walk but I'm going to say fear is
[1:11:27] something you need even if you're a
[1:11:28] mature Christian
[1:11:31] without a doubt
[1:11:33] and I didn't even get to all the
[1:11:34] scriptures so there might be a part
[1:11:36] three
[1:11:36] all right let's stand in our feet
[1:11:38] musicians can come
[1:11:46] now just so you know you can
