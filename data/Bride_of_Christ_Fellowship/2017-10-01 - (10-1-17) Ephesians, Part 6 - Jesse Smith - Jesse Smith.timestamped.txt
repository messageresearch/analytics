[35:51] Ephesians chapter 2 my Bible here by
[35:55] God's grace now I've had a lot of
[36:00] traveling time lately like last week I'd
[36:02] spent a lot of time on airplanes and
[36:04] everything sigh I was going back through
[36:05] my old notes and I've seen some numerous
[36:08] series I never finished I want to start
[36:11] back up a series I was preaching on the
[36:13] Ephesian the book of Ephesians so kind
[36:16] of felt led to preach on that of course
[36:17] Wednesday we looked at the book of life
[36:19] for our church age series but this one's
[36:23] about a year old I stopped preaching
[36:24] this on July of 2016 and I want to pick
[36:27] it up this morning I was reading
[36:29] yesterday and studying and I just felt
[36:31] this was inspiring to me so let's go to
[36:34] Ephesians chapter 2 and I left off in
[36:38] chapter 2 I left off with the scripture
[36:44] about verse 14 so let's pick up at 14
[36:47] we're left off at the middle wall
[36:48] partition I don't expect you to remember
[36:50] that it was about a year ago but I just
[36:53] want to briefly review a little bit and
[36:56] then we'll move on into chapter finished
[36:58] at chapter 2 Lord willing and maybe
[36:59] begin chapter 3 how many love the Lord
[37:02] Jesus Christ with all your heart let me
[37:04] love this good Holy Bible amen
[37:05] it's full it's free from errors this is
[37:08] the infallible Word of God so let's look
[37:10] at this Ephesians 2:14 if you're there
[37:13] say Amen let's read 14 together and then
[37:17] I'll read 15 by myself read verse 14 one
[37:20] two three four he is our peace who hath
[37:24] made both one and hath broken down the
[37:27] middle wall partition between us I'll
[37:30] just read verse 15 that will be done
[37:31] having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[37:33] even the law of Commandments contained
[37:36] in ordinances for to make in himself of
[37:41] twain one new man
[37:44] so making peace art so glad for the
[37:46] peace of God this morning let's just bow
[37:48] our heads you've haven't eaten your
[37:49] heart just make it known unto God have
[37:52] any father we love you Lord God this
[37:56] old-time religion makes us love
[37:58] everybody
[37:59] it makes us stop our sinning Lord God it
[38:02] lines us back up with the Word of God
[38:04] we're so grateful for that and nor one
[38:07] thing this Holy Spirit will make the
[38:09] devil fly hallelujah because as we
[38:11] cleave in obedience to the Holy Word of
[38:14] God Satan it must flee because we resist
[38:18] him with the Word of God we thank you
[38:20] Lord Jesus for this holy word father for
[38:23] our visitors and it's good to have our
[38:24] sister Wendy back and Lord is good to
[38:26] see all the Saints this morning Lord God
[38:29] father we just ask Lord that you
[38:30] minister by your Holy Spirit take me out
[38:33] of your way Lord God let your will be
[38:34] done
[38:35] we know you chose the five gifts of the
[38:38] fivefold ministry to perfect your church
[38:40] father may we get in line and may we all
[38:43] pull upon the Word of God to see what
[38:45] the spirit would say to us this morning
[38:46] father we're grateful Lord for this
[38:48] opportunity father we know the angels of
[38:51] God are here to write down our requests
[38:53] Lord and take them up to the throne of
[38:55] God Lord and we just want to Lord you
[38:59] want to get in unity with what the Holy
[39:01] Spirit would have us to say this morning
[39:03] and Lord have us to do so thank you Lord
[39:06] for your mercy bless us now in your
[39:08] divine presence in Jesus Christ's name
[39:10] the church said amen god bless you Jimmy
[39:13] and see their praise the Lord I just
[39:19] have a few pictures I'm going to review
[39:21] a little bit
[39:30] all right so we're happy to be in the
[39:34] House of Lords by God's grace it's good
[39:39] to be with everybody again and we went
[39:41] out like I said I want to pick this up
[39:42] I've been going back through my old
[39:44] notes and a lot of time just go through
[39:46] notes you know when you when you go into
[39:47] a meeting like last week's meeting I
[39:49] mean the Holy Spirit could bring out
[39:50] anything to preach you know so I was
[39:52] just digging through the notes and I
[39:53] thought okay I need to finish the
[39:54] Ephesians series and there's a couple
[39:57] more I need to finish by God's grace but
[40:00] I just kind of felt led to study on that
[40:02] and as I said I was studying different
[40:04] things and this was what kind of
[40:05] inspired me so I'd like to go with this
[40:07] this morning let's do a brief review you
[40:10] know the reason I started preaching on
[40:12] you know the book of Galatians and
[40:13] Ephesians was because those are the
[40:15] letters that give us the Apostolic Faith
[40:18] they lay the foundation for believers
[40:21] right
[40:22] we know that's in Scripture let's go to
[40:25] second Peter 3 let's read this briefly
[40:26] second Peter 3 verse 15 you know it
[40:33] would have been quite a thing Church and
[40:34] I just like if we could use our
[40:35] spiritual imaginations this morning it
[40:38] must have been quite a thing to live in
[40:39] the days of pompey Terr because like
[40:42] Peter says here they were receiving
[40:46] Paul's letters as the Word of God they
[40:49] were receiving it as Scripture most
[40:53] letters of course obviously 99.9% the
[40:56] letters you would receive in that day
[40:57] were not Scripture they were just
[40:59] regular letters you might have received
[41:00] but when they got a letter from Paul or
[41:03] and they got to listen to a letter that
[41:06] was written by Peter all of a sudden it
[41:09] was it was time to check up with God
[41:11] they had to handle this letter like it
[41:14] was the Word of God coming from the
[41:16] throne of God does every understand and
[41:19] so by God's grace if we could just tap
[41:23] into that same type of thought that same
[41:25] sincerity where we come to church and
[41:27] yeah we know this letters are 2,000
[41:29] years old but there's power within those
[41:31] letters to speak to us today and we need
[41:35] to hear what the Spirit is saying
[41:36] through those letters because it will
[41:38] minister to our needs today
[41:40] if we're really trusting
[41:41] and believing in God we have to have
[41:43] that confidence look what he says in 3
[41:46] verse 15 an account that the
[41:49] long-suffering of our Lord is salvation
[41:51] even as our beloved brother Paul also
[41:54] according to the wisdom given unto him
[41:57] hath written unto you so this group of
[42:00] Christians had already received a letter
[42:02] from Paul now they're receiving a letter
[42:04] from Peter my the messenger to the Jews
[42:07] Peter and the messenger to the Gentiles
[42:10] Paul and Peter recognizes this man uses
[42:15] great wisdom how many want more wisdom
[42:17] of God well you come to the right place
[42:19] you come to the Word of God amen
[42:21] Paul's letter the wisdom of God you know
[42:24] even Peter has to recognize it I've got
[42:26] the keys but he's got the great wisdom
[42:28] of God he has the the mystery of the
[42:30] dispensation to the Gentiles verse 16 as
[42:34] also in all his epistles so see there
[42:38] had been more than one they did receive
[42:39] numerous epistles of Paul speaking in
[42:43] them of these things in which are some
[42:44] things hard to be understood which they
[42:48] that are unlearned and unstable wrest as
[42:52] they do also the other scriptures unto
[42:55] their own destruction so we see a few
[42:59] things want to point out in here that
[43:01] Paul wrote things that were so deep in
[43:04] wisdom and understanding that even Holy
[43:06] Ghost field Christians had a hard time
[43:08] understanding them so don't feel bad if
[43:10] you read the book of Romans by ever ever
[43:13] read Romans lately or second Corinthians
[43:15] Witcher or some some books that contains
[43:18] some deep some deep principles we'd say
[43:20] but even Holy Ghost Christians struggle
[43:24] to understand some of these things and
[43:26] so we understand that they but they
[43:28] receive it though as the Word of God but
[43:32] I want you to notice those that are
[43:34] destroyed they take the scripture and
[43:38] they make it say what they want instead
[43:41] of just saying what the scripture says
[43:42] we need to be a church that just says
[43:45] what the scripture says we don't change
[43:48] the scripture and this is how you know
[43:50] it's always what's called the word des
[43:51] you give the word test in the mouth of
[43:54] two or three window
[43:55] says that every word be established so
[43:57] when someone comes teaching something
[43:59] you never heard before
[44:00] you've got to examine that and take that
[44:02] back to the Word of God and there must
[44:05] be two or three witnesses about that
[44:08] teaching from the Word of God if not you
[44:11] can just brush it off and say that's a
[44:13] false doctrine I'm not gonna spend my
[44:15] time on that let the blind lead the
[44:17] blind I'm following Christ and so this
[44:21] is the understanding they had a false
[44:23] preacher will not just twist one
[44:26] scripture he'll start twisting more and
[44:29] more scriptures right because the Bible
[44:32] said they will increase unto more
[44:33] ungodliness remember we looked at that a
[44:35] few weeks ago from second Timothy that's
[44:38] what happens once they twist one thing
[44:40] wrong if they don't repent of that false
[44:41] doctrine that spirit they feed that
[44:44] spirit it gets worse and worse and worse
[44:46] their lives get more ungodly and ungodly
[44:49] and it increases unto more ungodliness
[44:52] amen but I want you to see that there it
[44:55] was so important when they when they
[44:58] receive that letter you know they had a
[44:59] seal around it you know like you we know
[45:01] in the seven seals when they would break
[45:03] that seal my think about that by they
[45:07] didn't have the revelation of the seven
[45:08] seals yet but they had seals breaking
[45:11] around Paul's letters around around
[45:14] Peter's letters they break that seal and
[45:16] unroll and now they would have the
[45:19] revelation of what was contained in that
[45:20] book amen hallelujah makes me rejoice
[45:23] thinking about that because we've had
[45:25] the spiritual revelation of the seven
[45:27] seals revealed to us amen so true amen
[45:31] now let's go back to Ephesians here I
[45:33] just want to lay that in there they knew
[45:36] this was the Word of God they knew a man
[45:40] is led by the Holy Ghost to write the
[45:43] word and we are the beneficiaries of
[45:46] this word amen
[45:47] we're receiving the true Word of God and
[45:51] that's what happens with you and I in
[45:53] our day God the Bible said God has
[45:57] restored the faith of the fathers so
[46:00] that means most churches today don't
[46:02] preach what they actually preach in the
[46:04] book of Galatians in the book of
[46:06] Ephesians and Colossians Colossians
[46:09] most churches today do they twist the
[46:11] scriptures and make it say something
[46:13] that they want to say so they can live
[46:15] in their lusts but the Holy Spirit in
[46:18] real believers will rightly divide the
[46:20] word and teach the truth that we might
[46:23] live in obedience which is living in
[46:25] righteousness amen
[46:28] so I want to start again now by after
[46:32] that I want to say that as you know Paul
[46:34] wrote this letter from prison he was
[46:37] either an accessory in prison or he was
[46:40] in the Roman prison or the house arrest
[46:42] that he was in an X 28 they're not sure
[46:45] which prison he wrote it from but Paul
[46:47] wrote this book from prison we get that
[46:49] in a few scriptures through three verse
[46:52] one he says he's the prisoner of the
[46:54] Lord for this cause i paul the prisoner
[46:58] of jesus christ for you gentiles we also
[47:01] see in chapter four verse one I
[47:03] therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[47:05] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[47:07] vocation wherewith ye are called he's a
[47:11] prisoner and then chapter 6 verse 20
[47:17] chapter 6 verse 24 which I am in an
[47:20] ambassador in Bonn see he's in bondage
[47:23] right now can you imagine being a
[47:25] prisoner and and then writing letters
[47:28] and your letters are the Word of God I
[47:30] mean this is just such an amazing story
[47:32] when you look at the life of Paul he's
[47:34] an ambassador's in bonds now look at
[47:36] verse 20 that there and I may speak
[47:38] boldly as I ought to speak so see Paul
[47:40] reek recognizes I'm in prison
[47:42] and I'm not as bold as I need to be they
[47:44] said may God help me to have the bonus
[47:46] that I need Church there's times we lose
[47:48] our boldness sometimes we lose it and
[47:50] our homes sometimes we lose bonus on the
[47:52] job but one thing about a Holy Ghost
[47:54] filled Christian they're supposed to
[47:56] pray for more boldness
[47:57] that's what they did in Acts chapter 4
[47:59] after they got persecuted and before the
[48:01] council they went back rejoicing and
[48:04] prayed and said God give us more
[48:06] boldness so just because we lose our
[48:08] boldness that might not mean we're not
[48:10] born again it just means we need a
[48:12] refreshing of the Holy Spirit praise God
[48:14] how many can say amen to that so if you
[48:17] haven't been bold lately there's hope
[48:18] for you Paul's in prison he's saying God
[48:20] I'm not as bold as I need to be
[48:22] the Holy Spirit help me suck and be more
[48:24] bold even in prison amen
[48:26] he's in bonds he's a prisoner for Christ
[48:30] and program teaches you don't have to be
[48:33] in an actual prison to be a prisoner of
[48:35] Christ but every Christian should be a
[48:37] prisoner to the will of God amen
[48:39] that means every day you can't do what
[48:42] you want to do you only do what Christ
[48:44] tells you to do you only do what the
[48:47] Spirit says you're to do how many want
[48:49] to be a prisoner for Christ all but this
[48:51] world are so many temptations we must
[48:53] constantly crucify the lusts of the
[48:56] flesh and the affections thereof amen we
[48:58] must constantly make sure we're living
[49:00] for other people we're not living for
[49:02] ourselves it's so easy to live for
[49:06] ourselves today we must live for others
[49:08] hallelujah so this is a letter from
[49:13] prison and a man named Takei 'kiss or
[49:17] tikki cos I don't know how to say that
[49:20] he was a pause letter carrier you see
[49:23] that in chapter 6 verse 21 let's read
[49:25] that just so I got it but that ye also
[49:31] may know my affairs and how I do take I
[49:35] kiss tychicus
[49:36] tick I kiss I don't know a beloved
[49:40] brother and faithful minister Lord shall
[49:42] make known to you all things whom I have
[49:45] said unto you for the same purpose that
[49:47] he might know our fares and that he
[49:49] might comfort your hearts praise the
[49:53] Lord
[49:55] so see Takei cos I just say our brother
[50:00] t maybe I'll say that our brother T our
[50:02] brother T would visit Paul in the prison
[50:04] and I've also read other things where
[50:07] ever fruss he's named in the book of
[50:08] Colossians remember I profess that's
[50:10] this is a wonderful name there - I love
[50:12] those names but Epirus had let Paul know
[50:16] about the conditions of these churches
[50:18] around Ephesus and and where the
[50:21] Colossians were living and he reported
[50:24] that he went to visit Paul and I profess
[50:26] reported the net profess went back and
[50:28] then Takei kiss a brother t he he was
[50:32] there ministering the Paul in his bonds
[50:35] Paul's of
[50:35] prison or house arrest he's there
[50:37] ministering and so Paul writes two quick
[50:40] letters I'm sorry at least one quick
[50:42] letter Colossians was like a quickly
[50:43] written letter there's over 150
[50:46] scriptures that are word-for-word in
[50:49] Colossians that are actually in
[50:51] Ephesians but Ephesians is the longer
[50:53] letter and as I was reading through this
[50:54] history I just got inspired man this is
[50:56] this is powerful this is we need to know
[50:59] this amen we need to know what they went
[51:01] through to bring us the true Word of God
[51:03] because then we'll appreciate it more
[51:05] how many one appreciate your Bible more
[51:07] I don't want to read your Bible more how
[51:09] many want to have a more sacred feeling
[51:11] when you wake up in the morning and say
[51:12] it's my time with Jesus these men were
[51:15] in jail for it these men were rugged men
[51:18] that sacrificed everything their wives
[51:20] would have to go without their husbands
[51:22] I mean these were rugged men all because
[51:24] of the Word of God
[51:25] Christianity was the most persecuted
[51:28] religion of this time and it was not
[51:31] popular being a Christian like it is
[51:32] today
[51:33] there was no prosperity gospel back then
[51:35] if you're a Christian you're
[51:36] automatically persecuted God help us to
[51:39] live above that nonsense God help us to
[51:41] live a rugged life amen
[51:43] to keep our eyes on the cross amen this
[51:46] is the kind of life they lived so Takei
[51:49] 'kiss would sit there and wait to her
[51:53] Paul to get the anointing and write the
[51:55] letter and then he Paul would you know
[51:56] through the bars or through maybe
[51:58] through the door I've even heard
[51:59] recently that when Paul was in house
[52:01] arrest and I looked this up I heard a
[52:03] preacher used a very trustworthy
[52:04] preacher he said when Paul was under
[52:07] house arrest he was actually chained to
[52:10] the guard the Roman guard chained so
[52:14] they were changing at the wrists or
[52:16] somewhere at the foot so can you imagine
[52:19] Paul having to take a bath or you know
[52:21] wash off and he's got this guy chained
[52:23] to him can you imagine that you know
[52:26] just taking care of business writing the
[52:27] letters I wonder if that guy got saved
[52:29] while Paul was writing those letters I
[52:30] wonder he's under that anointing they're
[52:33] chained he was a prisoner in bonds for
[52:36] Christ amen and this is the kind of
[52:39] atmosphere he lived under and he was
[52:42] filled with the Holy Ghost he was a man
[52:44] of God he was a dispensation of the
[52:46] Gentiles yet he went through really
[52:48] ten struggles and persecutions but he
[52:51] went through all that so he could be
[52:52] more like Jesus Christ god help us to go
[52:55] through our persecutions with joy that
[52:57] we might be more like Christ because our
[53:00] afflictions are light afflictions and
[53:02] you know who said that
[53:03] Paul is the one who said that Paul said
[53:06] my afflictions are light afflictions so
[53:08] what are ours ours or ours or feather
[53:10] afflictions then if his are light
[53:12] afflictions ours would be feather
[53:13] afflictions now we know their mind
[53:16] bounds they're intense mind battles it's
[53:17] the greatest battle ever fought but
[53:19] there's no real persecution like
[53:21] physical persecution
[53:22] that'd be the hardest persecution there
[53:24] would have to be because Jesus says that
[53:26] in the Sermon on the Mount blessed are
[53:28] those who are persecuted for my name's
[53:29] sake remember that rejoice because great
[53:32] is your reward in heaven amen
[53:35] so while we have light affliction our
[53:37] affliction is not the same of course as
[53:39] those days but we know it's coming to
[53:41] the u.s. we know persecution is coming
[53:43] and it's thus saith the Lord it's coming
[53:45] so we got to be prepared we never know
[53:47] the day in the hour that's right now so
[53:52] Takai kiss would make everything known
[53:54] from Paul to the church
[53:57] can you imagine Takei cos carrying that
[53:59] word I've got the revelation I've got
[54:01] the fresh revelation of God's Word for
[54:03] this hour huh I can imagine he must have
[54:05] been running along skipping along I've
[54:07] got the word I've got the message for
[54:09] the hour mine we can do the same thing
[54:11] when we got message books right or a
[54:12] church age mode we've got the word of
[54:15] the hour amen and we can give it to
[54:17] others praise God amen now I want to
[54:25] move past this now and get back to our
[54:27] some of our scriptures here too the the
[54:31] message is the central messages of
[54:34] Ephesians the book of Ephesians the
[54:37] central messages can name off a few
[54:39] themes Redemption God's intervention to
[54:43] man through grace predestination
[54:46] reconciliation union with christ the
[54:51] holy walk the recreation of the
[54:54] christian family and the walk and
[54:56] service and warfare of the believer Amen
[55:00] honey appreciate this book amen
[55:02] had to recreate the family and so he did
[55:04] it through the writings of Paul in
[55:06] Ephesians chapter 5 my goodness in
[55:08] chapter 6 hard to show us what our
[55:11] Warfare's like do we have on the full
[55:13] armor of God amen
[55:15] we know Peter put it on on the day of
[55:18] Pentecost holiday yeah he went up to the
[55:20] the day of Pentecost and he got filled
[55:23] with the Holy Ghost and the Prophet said
[55:24] he put on the full armor of God now he's
[55:27] ready to stand there and fight with the
[55:28] sword of the Spirit praise God
[55:30] beforehand he would lose his testimony
[55:32] before Widow not widow girls a little
[55:35] worker girls he was a little maids he
[55:38] would he couldn't stand like he needed
[55:39] to stand but he went up to Pentecost and
[55:42] he got on the full armor of God that's
[55:43] what we need today the full armor of God
[55:46] we need people praying that are always
[55:48] praying in the spirit praise God they
[55:50] have the helmet of salvation they know
[55:52] they're saved the belt of the truth
[55:54] their minds are centered on the truth of
[55:56] God's Word amen they're ready to answer
[55:59] because they've got the thoughts of God
[56:00] in their minds their feet are shod
[56:03] they're ready to go anywhere at any time
[56:05] to do something for the kingdom of God
[56:07] amen and most of all he said have the
[56:09] shield of faith the shield of faith is
[56:12] the confidence in God's word that no
[56:14] dart of the enemy can this can break
[56:17] through faith conquers hallelujah faith
[56:19] is our victory amen
[56:21] that's our shield is faith in Christ
[56:23] word hallelujah now let me get now to
[56:28] back to the scripture and I had it in my
[56:32] mind this morning I had in my mind to
[56:36] just reread all chapter 1 that'd be okay
[56:39] okay you know we're supposed to read a
[56:41] chapter every morning I don't know if
[56:43] you did but if you didn't here's your
[56:44] chapter let's read it I'm just gonna
[56:45] stop in a few moments and pull out a few
[56:47] thoughts visions 1 verse 1 hallelujah
[56:51] God's has mercy Church we want to be as
[56:52] dedicated as we can right but God is
[56:55] merciful Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ
[56:59] by the will of God to the Saints which
[57:01] are at Ephesus and to the faithful in
[57:03] Christ Jesus
[57:04] I can imagine Tai Chi cooter Takei kiss
[57:08] open that the faithful in Christ Jesus

[57:12] ones that are staying with brother
[57:14] Branham

[57:21] then to stand with Moses glory let us
[57:24] stay with Joshua than to stay with
[57:26] Gideon that they stay with all these men
[57:27] of God and to stay with Daniel and to
[57:29] stay with all these men and today we

[57:34] verse two grace be to you and peace from
[57:37] God our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[57:39] Christ blessed be the God and father of
[57:43] our Lord Jesus Christ has blessed us
[57:44] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[57:47] places in Christ if we're missing a
[57:51] blessing today we know God has already
[57:54] given it to us we've just got to get
[57:56] where two heavenly places and heavenly
[57:59] places program so does this believer
[58:01] spiritual position in Christ it's when
[58:03] you're walking in the spirit you're
[58:05] under the anointing but how many believe
[58:07] the how many oh the Bible says all
[58:08] blessings are given to you where's my
[58:10] blessings well they're in heavenly
[58:12] places you got to get caught up in the
[58:13] atmosphere got to get caught up in the
[58:15] Holy Spirit that's where you'll find
[58:16] your blessings hallelujah
[58:21] according verse 4 this is one of those
[58:22] beautiful scriptures according as he has
[58:25] chosen us in him before the foundation
[58:30] of the world amen
[58:32] where did God choose me in his mind
[58:34] before the foundation of the world Paul
[58:37] couldn't write this to everybody right
[58:38] he couldn't write this to the Corinthian
[58:39] church he had to ride it to a deep
[58:41] mature church the ephesian church that
[58:45] we should be holy and without blame
[58:47] before him in love so if you were in the
[58:52] mind of God in the Lamb's Book of Life
[58:54] before the foundation world you will
[58:56] live a holy life because he's called you
[58:59] to a holy life and holy means separate
[59:01] free from sin right I mean set apart
[59:04] hallelujah sacred verse 5 having
[59:07] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[59:10] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[59:12] according to the good pleasure of his
[59:16] will
[59:16] amen my destinations already been
[59:19] predetermined by the Amen its
[59:20] predetermined where was it determined in
[59:23] God's mind Amen if I came from out of

[59:27] going back to
[59:28] amen and God ordained to determine
[59:31] everything that would happen all the
[59:32] situations that I would shine forth his
[59:35] light and I'd bring forth fruit in my
[59:37] season amen it's exactly right for each
[59:40] one of us were predestinated unto this
[59:42] adoption verse 6 to the praise of the
[59:45] glory of His grace wherein he hath made
[59:48] us accepted in the eleventh the loved'
[59:51] what beautiful words he has made us
[59:54] accepted amen

[1:00:01] redemption through his blood hallelujah
[1:00:03] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:00:05] riches of His grace what can wash away
[1:00:07] your sins nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1:00:10] nothing not your good conduct not your
[1:00:13] good character not how holy we live but
[1:00:15] first they're washed away by the blood
[1:00:17] of Christ amen now look at verse 8 this
[1:00:21] is I want to just emphasize these things
[1:00:23] again wherein he hath abounded toward us
[1:00:27] in all wisdom and prudence so God has
[1:00:30] abounded toward us that means God has
[1:00:32] revealed himself to us God has come to
[1:00:35] us he's abounded to us in what all
[1:00:38] wisdom and prudence when you come to
[1:00:42] church you should look for wisdom what's
[1:00:43] the wisdom of God telling me my current
[1:00:44] situation praise the Lord because he is
[1:00:47] abounded towards us in other words he's
[1:00:49] kind of come up and greeted us right he
[1:00:51] sees he's made an effort to come to us
[1:00:54] that mean we might receive all the
[1:00:55] blessings and all the wisdom Oh aren't
[1:00:58] you glad about that
[1:00:59] he's abounded toward us he made a move
[1:01:02] towards us we didn't seek after God God
[1:01:04] sought us amen having made known unto us
[1:01:08] the mystery of his will according to his
[1:01:11] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[1:01:14] himself God makes known the personal
[1:01:16] will for our lives he makes it known to
[1:01:18] us his will verse 10 that in the
[1:01:21] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[1:01:23] might gather together in one all things
[1:01:25] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[1:01:28] which are on earth even in him in whom

[1:02:00] inheritance for me in the home of God
[1:02:03] being predestinated according to the
[1:02:05] purpose of him who worketh all things
[1:02:07] after the counsel of his own will if God
[1:02:11] allowed it in your heart we should thank
[1:02:13] her God allowed something to happen your
[1:02:14] life you should thank God for it this
[1:02:16] was predestinated to happen as hard as
[1:02:18] this is or as difficult as the struggle
[1:02:21] is God predestined this to happen guess
[1:02:23] what God predestinated this service
[1:02:24] right here and the church said all
[1:02:28] things are predestinated oh let's let's
[1:02:32] get the word let's catch the Word of God
[1:02:35] hallelujah yes that we should be to the
[1:02:39] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[1:02:42] Christ hallelujah so our lives should
[1:02:44] glorify Him that's why we sing and raise
[1:02:47] our hands and praise God our lies are
[1:02:49] for God's glory
[1:02:50] verse 13 in whom he also trusted after
[1:02:53] that ye heard the word of truth the
[1:02:55] gospel of your salvation who in whom
[1:02:57] also after that ye believed you were
[1:02:59] sealed with that holy spirit of promise
[1:03:02] this is one of the major doctrines and
[1:03:04] ephesians for us in this our people are
[1:03:07] not born again the Holy Ghost just
[1:03:09] because they're saved you can be saved
[1:03:11] without being born again praise God the
[1:03:16] Holy Ghost baptism it comes after you've
[1:03:19] served God and you're justified you're
[1:03:21] baptized you're sanctified and then at
[1:03:23] some time after that then you get filled
[1:03:25] with the power of God and then you are
[1:03:27] sealed to the day of your Redemption you
[1:03:29] won't go back into the world you're
[1:03:31] sealed you're locked into Christ there's
[1:03:34] no going back
[1:03:35] you burned every Bridge you're a servant
[1:03:37] of Christ amen you're sealed in your
[1:03:40] whole body spirit and soul our Christ
[1:03:43] hallelujah that's one of the great
[1:03:45] mysteries laying in here so many
[1:03:47] churches teach oh you got saved
[1:03:50] oh now you're filled with the Holy
[1:03:51] Spirit no you're not you need to have a
[1:03:53] cleanse out sanctified life before you
[1:03:55] can be filled with the whole
[1:03:56] spirit look at the disciples they served
[1:03:58] Christ for three and a half years and
[1:04:00] still weren't fill at the Holy Spirit
[1:04:02] they need a little more sanctifying and
[1:04:04] they got it when Jesus except their
[1:04:06] weaknesses be exposed right they got a
[1:04:09] little more sanctification why did I
[1:04:11] don't know how didn't have what I
[1:04:12] thought I had and sometimes God will let
[1:04:14] us realize why I didn't have what I
[1:04:15] thought I had I thought I was stronger
[1:04:18] with this I thought I had more victory
[1:04:19] than this I thought I was above this and
[1:04:21] gotta let things happen he arranges
[1:04:23] everything to show us where we are that
[1:04:25] we might look to him for more wisdom
[1:04:27] more bonus more strength amen hallelujah
[1:04:32] God has to expose our weaknesses like
[1:04:36] you did with Peter and all the disciples
[1:04:37] has to show us where were weak so he
[1:04:39] might be strong amen
[1:04:44] now verse 14 which is the earnest of our
[1:04:47] inheritance so the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:49] Ghost
[1:04:50] is the earnest or down payment of our
[1:04:52] inheritance until the redemption of the
[1:04:54] purchased possession which is our
[1:04:56] eternal body unto the praise of his
[1:04:58] glory wherefore I also after I heard of
[1:05:01] your faith in the Lord Jesus and love
[1:05:03] unto all the saints I hope people could
[1:05:06] say about our church open brother Brian

[1:05:24] you making mention of you and my prayers
[1:05:25] that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:27] the father of glory may give unto you
[1:05:30] the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
[1:05:32] the knowledge of him amen see how Paul
[1:05:36] keeps emphasizing this wisdom revelation
[1:05:39] knowledge we should all be growing in
[1:05:42] these things the eyes of your
[1:05:45] understanding being enlightened that ye
[1:05:47] may know what is the hope of his calling
[1:05:49] and what the riches of the glory of his
[1:05:53] inheritance in the Saints do we often
[1:05:56] think about that you often think about
[1:05:58] the inheritance that lays for us in
[1:06:00] heaven
[1:06:00] we need to set our affections on things
[1:06:02] above amen there's a perfect body

[1:06:19] and there's also crowns for us to throw
[1:06:21] at the feet of Jesus amen Oh hallelujah
[1:06:24] but we must think about the things above
[1:06:26] the inheritance that lays before us as
[1:06:29] we run the race verse 19 and what is the
[1:06:34] exceeding greatness of his power to us
[1:06:37] word who believe this is where we need
[1:06:38] help brother have said this is where we
[1:06:39] need help in America in America the
[1:06:42] prophets said our biggest hindrance is
[1:06:44] fear that God won't keep his word
[1:06:46] Christians are so afraid God's not going
[1:06:48] to keep his word God won't answer my
[1:06:50] prayer but here Church let it be a
[1:06:52] strength to us this morning that we have
[1:06:55] exceeding greatness of his power to us

[1:07:15] to see it every day praise God power to
[1:07:17] cast down temptations power to love when
[1:07:20] it's hard right power to forgive when
[1:07:22] it's hard to forgive there's mighty

[1:07:26] power that's given to us who believe

[1:07:45] heavenly places we got to get in the
[1:07:47] spirit we got to get in God's thoughts
[1:07:49] amen that's right verse twenty which he
[1:07:54] wrought in Christ when he raised him
[1:07:56] from the dead and set him at his own
[1:07:57] right hand in the heavenly places far
[1:07:59] above all principality and power and
[1:08:01] might and Dominion and every name that

[1:08:29] head tells me to do I want to pack out
[1:08:31] the orders that the head is telling me
[1:08:33] to do praise God amen chapter two now
[1:08:36] you read your chapter right there's a
[1:08:37] good chapter we all hopefully ready to
[1:08:38] listen to the chapter this morning hey
[1:08:40] man now I think what I'm gonna do now
[1:08:45] cuz I've already bought going about a
[1:08:46] half hour okay I think I'm gonna do now
[1:08:48] is uh I'm gonna jump ahead to where we
[1:08:51] left off there's a chapter now remember
[1:08:54] let's go to chapter four chapter two
[1:08:55] verse fourteen we'll go back to that
[1:08:56] middle wall partition Malachi can switch
[1:08:58] over now back thanks for switching over
[1:09:00] to the scriptures I like that that's
[1:09:02] really good so everybody can see those I
[1:09:05] just want to review this briefly and
[1:09:08] then we'll get into we'll finish chapter
[1:09:09] to it and start chapter three chapter
[1:09:12] two verse 14 he's our peace who has who
[1:09:18] hath made both one and hath broken down
[1:09:21] the middle wall of partition between us
[1:09:30] now there's a middle wall of partition
[1:09:32] between us there we go now remember we
[1:09:36] looked at this about a year ago the
[1:09:37] middle wall partition now the Bible said
[1:09:41] Christ broke this down there's a middle
[1:09:43] wall partition how many member that by
[1:09:46] God's grace anybody member okay maybe
[1:09:49] not all right so last year we showed
[1:09:51] this this was the temple of Herod of
[1:09:56] course in the days of Jesus I'm sorry
[1:09:59] this was the Temple of Solomon yeah
[1:10:00] because Herod's wasn't as large as that
[1:10:02] this is a temple of Solomon so outside
[1:10:04] of the walls here you're inside the
[1:10:06] walls you have the court of the Gentiles
[1:10:07] Gentiles could only go this close to God
[1:10:10] they could never go in and experience
[1:10:13] we'd say the sacrifices they can never
[1:10:15] experience the holy worship they were
[1:10:19] kept at a distance they were cut out
[1:10:21] because there were Gentiles they were
[1:10:23] unclean they didn't meet God's
[1:10:24] requirements that sound familiar like
[1:10:27] you and I we didn't meet God's
[1:10:28] requirements did we we were filthy
[1:10:30] without God without law without the word
[1:10:33] we had no promises and this great big
[1:10:36] wall here
[1:10:37] part of the building is called the great
[1:10:39] wall of partition if you remember and
[1:10:41] there was a warning written on the
[1:10:44] middle wall partition remember that
[1:10:45] warning it looked like this this is kind
[1:10:47] like a copy of it nearly rub it you know
[1:10:49] they rub it what's it called I forget
[1:10:51] because stone rubbing or something like
[1:10:52] that I forget what they caught now
[1:10:55] here's what it says that's in a foreign
[1:10:56] language it's called the stones of
[1:10:59] warning here's what it said no foreigner
[1:11:01] is to go beyond the balustrade and the
[1:11:04] plaza of the temple zone who suffers
[1:11:07] caught doing so will have himself to
[1:11:09] blame for his death which will follow so
[1:11:14] let's go back to that the Jews were so
[1:11:16] they were so they were so zealous for
[1:11:21] their word that they had these signs
[1:11:23] hanging up if any Gentile entered they'd
[1:11:26] only have themselves to be blamed but
[1:11:30] the Bible said Christ was our peace and
[1:11:32] broken down the middle wall of partition
[1:11:35] between us so in Christ died this wall
[1:11:42] this wall didn't fall but the Bible said
[1:11:46] there was a spiritual wall that fell
[1:11:47] there was no more division between Jew
[1:11:50] and Gentile the walls fell and now they
[1:11:53] were won by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:11:56] now there's one thing that did fall that
[1:11:58] day that was the Veil the veil was rent
[1:12:01] praise God so not only was the wall
[1:12:04] broken down between man and man's you
[1:12:06] and Gentile the wall between God and man
[1:12:09] was broken down as well hallelujah and
[1:12:11] now there's no veil between God and man
[1:12:15] and God's holy presidents aren't you
[1:12:17] glad Church that we can enter in the
[1:12:18] holy presence of God this morning hey
[1:12:21] man you can enter in and receive your
[1:12:23] healing you can enter in and receive
[1:12:25] your forgiveness you can enter in and
[1:12:26] receive your bonus we just got to enter
[1:12:29] in and come into his presence amen
[1:12:30] hallelujah so see and God's always
[1:12:35] breaking down walls he broke down this
[1:12:37] spiritual wall he broke down Jericho
[1:12:39] walls he breaks down walls all the time
[1:12:41] God is always bringing the people
[1:12:43] together through the blood of Jesus
[1:12:45] Christ amen
[1:12:47] all right now
[1:12:50] thing I didn't get to I want to show is
[1:12:54] that the the only way we can kind of
[1:12:57] relate to this is that by understanding
[1:12:58] the Berlin wall because that was so you
[1:13:01] know we're so far removed from the days
[1:13:02] of you know the Jews and we don't even
[1:13:04] live in the East you know we're Western
[1:13:05] people
[1:13:06] I remember the Berlin Wall and we
[1:13:08] remember the Berlin Wall okay you might
[1:13:12] not this is a wall that stood for 28
[1:13:15] years let me let me read a little bit
[1:13:17] about it by God's grace this was a
[1:13:23] barrier built to close off East
[1:13:26] Germany's access to West Germany and it
[1:13:31] stood for 28 years and I don't let me
[1:13:33] just show this picture a picture's worth
[1:13:34] a thousand words so they built this wall
[1:13:41] and they built it around 1961 yeah I was
[1:13:47] set up in 1961 and it stood until the
[1:13:50] 80s and you know I remember growing up I
[1:13:52] remember seeing when the wall came down
[1:13:53] on the news just as a little boy I don't
[1:13:55] remember much about it cuz I was so
[1:13:57] little now remember much anyway god I
[1:13:59] need God to help me with my memory but
[1:14:01] but I remember when that happened I
[1:14:03] remember when I'll have a picture in
[1:14:05] just a moment but this was standing from
[1:14:10] 1961 to 1989 and here's what was
[1:14:16] happening in the years between 1949 and
[1:14:18] 61 two and a half million East Germans
[1:14:20] had fled from east to the West Germany
[1:14:23] including steadily rising numbers of
[1:14:25] skilled workers professionals and
[1:14:27] intellectuals so all the rich people all
[1:14:29] the all the smart people were moving
[1:14:32] from the West East and their loss
[1:14:36] threatened to destroy the economic
[1:14:38] viability of the East German state so
[1:14:40] the eastern sides like we're losing all
[1:14:42] of our doctors we're losing all of our
[1:14:45] smart people we're losing all of our
[1:14:46] scientists we're losing all of our money
[1:14:48] and so out of fear they built the Berlin
[1:14:52] Wall it was erected on the night of
[1:14:56] August 12th and 13 1961 the original
[1:15:02] always bill of barbed wire and
[1:15:04] cinderblocks and was subsequently
[1:15:07] replaced by a series of concrete walls
[1:15:09] which were up to 15 feet tall and they
[1:15:14] were topped with barbed wire on the top
[1:15:16] so they really don't want those doctors
[1:15:17] to leave they didn't want all these uh
[1:15:20] scientists and educated professionals to
[1:15:22] leave that concrete wall plus barbed
[1:15:24] wire on top my goodness by the 1980s the
[1:15:30] system of law now had electrified fences
[1:15:34] and fornications that extended 28 miles
[1:15:37] around that part of Germany and divided
[1:15:43] the two parts of the city
[1:15:48] 5,000 people were captured by East
[1:15:51] German authorities attempting to get
[1:15:54] past the wall 5,000 almost 200 died
[1:15:58] because they were trapped in by this
[1:16:00] wall you ever felt trapped in by walls
[1:16:03] here I feel like I just can't get out of
[1:16:06] this kind of like reminds us of those
[1:16:07] strongholds in the complexes right I
[1:16:09] just can't get out of this so 5,000
[1:16:13] people were arrested they didn't get
[1:16:14] through that wall 200 died attempting to
[1:16:19] get through the wall but you remember in
[1:16:23] 1989 remember 1989 they finally you know
[1:16:26] was covered and graffiti and everything
[1:16:28] like that I remember that from the news
[1:16:29] in 1989 remember that some of us okay
[1:16:32] that's the closest we can remember and
[1:16:37] that's the most we can relate to this
[1:16:38] there was a middle wall of partition
[1:16:40] between Jews and Gentiles you can get
[1:16:43] the Glock God but not as close as I can
[1:16:46] look that's what you could say you can
[1:16:49] serve God but you can't serve him like I
[1:16:51] can serve him does that sound familiar
[1:16:53] that suffer maker we have to make sure
[1:16:55] pride doesn't raise up for us believers
[1:16:57] right
[1:16:58] well you can't worship God like I can
[1:17:01] now part of that's true and part that's
[1:17:03] not true it depends how you say it right
[1:17:06] it depends what spirit you say that in
[1:17:08] praise the Lord because a wise version
[1:17:11] can worship God in a way that a foolish
[1:17:13] virgin can't are you with me
[1:17:16] the wise virgin could not go to the
[1:17:18] marriage procession because they could
[1:17:20] worship God with oil but the foolish
[1:17:23] version couldn't worship God with oil
[1:17:25] the thing I'm attacking is that spirit
[1:17:27] of Pride and that spirit of division
[1:17:30] that's what we're attacking because we
[1:17:31] know there's a difference between a wise
[1:17:33] virgin and a foolish version we know
[1:17:35] there's a great difference but pride
[1:17:38] when pride Rises isn't it rise in and
[1:17:41] weaken oh we can't do this and we can't
[1:17:42] do that when we're better
[1:17:44] we must never think we're better we just
[1:17:47] must feel that we're called amen oh yeah
[1:17:49] that's the word I want to use we're not
[1:17:51] better
[1:17:51] we're just called to a higher life how
[1:17:53] many called to a holy calling this
[1:17:55] morning hey man we're not better than
[1:17:59] ourselves but one thing because we've
[1:18:01] received a higher calling we can live
[1:18:03] higher amen
[1:18:05] and so this fell this this fell on
[1:18:09] November 9th 1989 this wall fell 28
[1:18:17] years it's separated families can you
[1:18:19] imagine me on one side saying darn and
[1:18:21] how are you oh my son I wish I could see
[1:18:24] there was thousands of people that
[1:18:26] happened to once they erected that wall
[1:18:28] and shut it off that night they just had
[1:18:30] to peek through the wall can you imagine
[1:18:31] me in heartbroken so no we're just we
[1:18:34] can't work we're divided we're not
[1:18:37] United now apply that to the church how
[1:18:40] United we should be it's the middle wall
[1:18:42] partition
[1:18:44] anything that separates us even
[1:18:46] complexes anything at all that would
[1:18:48] separate us see how awful that is how it
[1:18:50] separates other people it separates us
[1:18:52] us from our family how many want all the
[1:18:55] walls to fall down amen in Jesus name we
[1:18:58] should believe that we should have all
[1:19:00] the walls fall down and they fall down
[1:19:01] by going through the blood of Jesus
[1:19:03] Christ which is the Holy Spirit in the
[1:19:06] sour amen does that help by God's grace
[1:19:09] that gives us a little bit of a modern
[1:19:11] kind of understanding of this middle
[1:19:14] wall of partition and Paul's writing
[1:19:16] this and Takaya kisses opening this up
[1:19:18] and this is the revealed Word of God all
[1:19:22] the walls between us should be broken
[1:19:24] down how do we do that we go to one
[1:19:27] another and talk about if they've sinned
[1:19:29] against us we go to them
[1:19:30] right praise the Lord somebody sinned
[1:19:32] against you go to them praise God and so
[1:19:36] if you sin against somebody they should
[1:19:37] come to you now if you know you sinned
[1:19:39] against somebody you should still go to
[1:19:40] them if you don't know you sinned
[1:19:42] against them you gotta wait till they
[1:19:43] come to you right
[1:19:44] that's how walls get broken down when we
[1:19:48] come through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:19:50] exactly right
[1:19:52] amen this was a revolution what about a
[1:19:56] spiritual revolution we've had in Christ
[1:19:58] Jesus
[1:19:59] Oh hallelujah amen all the walls you
[1:20:03] know I denominational walls build up I
[1:20:05] was raised by the costal where we they
[1:20:07] spoke in tongues every week you know and
[1:20:09] that was fine but it was but I had a
[1:20:12] wall built up like you had to do this
[1:20:13] too to be born again
[1:20:15] and God had to break down that wall and
[1:20:17] say that's a man-made wall I'm breaking
[1:20:19] down that wall in Jesus name Amen
[1:20:21] speaking in tongues is a gift of the
[1:20:23] Holy Ghost but it's not the Holy Ghost
[1:20:25] the Holy Ghost is the person of Christ
[1:20:27] amen it is the Holy Spirit Himself
[1:20:29] dwelling in the soul of man aren't you
[1:20:32] glad the walls been broken down Oh
[1:20:34] hallelujah this is what it's done for us
[1:20:38] it's broken down walls that separate
[1:20:41] walls that divide the blood of Christ
[1:20:43] has done that for us amen verse 15
[1:20:49] having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[1:20:52] remember all sin was put upon Jesus body
[1:20:55] that's how sin was abolished he paid the
[1:20:59] penalty for our sins even the law of
[1:21:02] Commandments contained in ordinances for
[1:21:04] to make in himself of Twain one new man
[1:21:07] so making peace and that he might
[1:21:12] reconcile both unto God in one body by
[1:21:15] the cross having slain the enmity
[1:21:18] thereby hallelujah amen and came and
[1:21:23] preached peace to you which were far off
[1:21:26] and to them that were nine for through
[1:21:29] him we both have access by one spirit
[1:21:32] unto the Father amen
[1:21:35] see we can't get to the Holy Ghost we
[1:21:37] can't get to God we can't get to God's
[1:21:39] Spirit unless we have faith in the blood
[1:21:42] of Jesus Christ
[1:21:43] let's not let's not say that's not deep
[1:21:46] enough preaching can you say amen to
[1:21:48] that
[1:21:48] let's not that's not how the attitude
[1:21:52] because our current walk with the Lord
[1:21:55] shows what we think about the blood of
[1:21:56] Jesus right because we can only get to
[1:21:59] the Father the Holy Ghost through
[1:22:00] remembering the cross I was out of New
[1:22:03] York and this pastor was a wonderful man
[1:22:05] of God brother Devon he's a wonderful
[1:22:07] man of God but he was telling me some of
[1:22:09] the spiritual battles they've had over
[1:22:10] the years and one of the battles was
[1:22:12] with a movement called the seven
[1:22:14] thunders movement you've probably heard
[1:22:15] of it there was many offshoots of that
[1:22:17] one of the offshoots was that they no
[1:22:19] longer needed to preach on the blood of
[1:22:20] Jesus Christ anymore
[1:22:22] because now the preaching is for the
[1:22:24] rapture they got to get the bride ready
[1:22:25] for the rapture oh my and brother Vaughn
[1:22:31] did not agree with that and he had to
[1:22:33] stand up in a convention after three
[1:22:35] preachers had preached on he had to
[1:22:37] stand there and say you're wrong in
[1:22:38] front of a thousand or I think it was a
[1:22:40] thousand or five hundred people and get
[1:22:43] them to see that the blood of Jesus
[1:22:44] Christ will never lose its power we're
[1:22:47] never in a spot where we don't need the
[1:22:49] blood of Jesus Christ so you with me
[1:22:50] Church because the Bible said it's the
[1:22:52] blood of the everlasting covenant and
[1:22:55] that blood of Christ
[1:22:56] remembering the cross makes us perfect
[1:22:59] for everything we have to do so if
[1:23:01] you're struggling with your job if
[1:23:03] you're struggling with your family if
[1:23:04] you're struggling with the church if
[1:23:06] you're struggling with your gifts apply
[1:23:08] the blood to that apply the cross to
[1:23:10] that look at the think of the cross and
[1:23:12] how how would this cross influence me to
[1:23:15] act in this situation and the church
[1:23:16] said keep your place go to Hebrews 13
[1:23:19] that just reminded me of the scripture
[1:23:20] feeling definitely feeling led of the
[1:23:23] Holy Spirit Hebrews 13 because the Holy
[1:23:27] Spirit will always point us to the word
[1:23:29] fact the Prophet said it will only point
[1:23:32] you to the Word of God Hebrews 13
[1:23:44] verse 20 that's what we must do we must
[1:23:48] picture ourselves today at the cross and
[1:23:51] then whatever battle whatever giant we
[1:23:54] preach on Giants last week they really
[1:23:55] enjoyed that message the Giants that
[1:23:58] Joshua drove out as a wonderful time in
[1:24:01] the Lord mine as we think about this
[1:24:05] whatever giant you're facing whatever
[1:24:09] problem you're trying to drive out the
[1:24:11] cross must be right there you must be
[1:24:12] right there at the cross you must
[1:24:14] picture Jesus Jesus died he's gonna
[1:24:18] guide me there's power in the cross the
[1:24:21] sins of this person who sinned against
[1:24:22] me Jesus died for those sins or I'm the
[1:24:24] guilty one sometimes we get overcome
[1:24:26] with guilt we won't forgive ourselves
[1:24:27] but we were us remember he had to die
[1:24:29] for me I needed him to die for me and
[1:24:32] there's forgiveness for me if that's my
[1:24:34] land that died there's forgiveness for
[1:24:36] me and the church said Amen mine we
[1:24:38] can't hold guilt we got to let it go
[1:24:40] because we know we're trusting in God's
[1:24:42] provided sacrifice he paid for our sins
[1:24:45] he took our guilt he took our punishment
[1:24:47] that's why we need the cross today amen
[1:24:49] glory verse 20 now the God of peace that
[1:24:54] brought again from the dead our Lord
[1:24:56] Jesus that great Shepherd of the Sheep
[1:24:59] through what church the blood of the
[1:25:04] everlasting covenant please don't let
[1:25:05] the blood become common this morning
[1:25:07] don't let the blood become common it is
[1:25:10] through the blood of this everlasting
[1:25:12] covenant verse 21
[1:25:13] will make you what perfect complete God
[1:25:19] will complete his will in your life
[1:25:21] through the blood of the everlasting
[1:25:24] covenant in heaven to do his will
[1:25:29] everyone do his will I want to do only
[1:25:31] God's will I don't do my will I want to
[1:25:33] do my wife's will I don't want to do
[1:25:35] what the church wants me to do I want to
[1:25:36] do what God wants me to do you
[1:25:38] understand no disrespect against anybody
[1:25:41] but we must do God's will first working
[1:25:45] in you that which is well pleasing in
[1:25:47] his sight we got to please God not man
[1:25:49] we've got to please God
[1:25:52] through
[1:25:53] do that through Jesus Christ to whom be
[1:25:56] glory forever and ever amen
[1:26:01] do you appreciate that we must we must
[1:26:04] constantly trust in the blood of Jesus
[1:26:07] Christ that will help us forgive others
[1:26:10] help us forgive ourselves and it will
[1:26:15] prepare us to do every good work we do
[1:26:17] for God
[1:26:18] I remember the cross I remember what it
[1:26:21] did it's like the cross is right here I
[1:26:23] can see Jesus I can see he died and now
[1:26:25] I want to hear his voice I want to hear
[1:26:26] what he'd say I want to and I want to
[1:26:28] quickly respond to that like Isaiah did
[1:26:31] Lord send me
[1:26:33] let's close by finish in chapter 2 in
[1:26:35] Ephesians let's go back there let's
[1:26:37] close that up I just got timer I got 12
[1:26:40] minutes on here about probably finished
[1:26:41] before that by God's grace oh I love
[1:26:44] this book amen book of Ephesians
[1:26:46] remember this all parallels Joshua and
[1:26:50] Joshua represented well Josh represented
[1:26:53] people taking the land the first people
[1:26:54] to possess the land by power and that
[1:26:57] types when you first get born of the
[1:26:58] Holy Ghost that's what Ephesian the book
[1:27:00] of Ephesians types you you're just a
[1:27:03] fresh Christian man I'm filled with the
[1:27:04] power of God I'm filled with the Holy
[1:27:05] Ghost
[1:27:05] I'm gonna possess this land but then we
[1:27:08] run into giants though we run into
[1:27:11] trouble sometimes we God restore our
[1:27:13] boldness praise God hallelujah the cross
[1:27:20] slain the enmity verse 16 by the cross
[1:27:23] slayed it the cross slayed the hatred
[1:27:26] that was against us hmm let's go to
[1:27:31] verse 19 now therefore ye are no longer
[1:27:35] strangers and foreigners but
[1:27:37] fellow-citizens with the Saints and the
[1:27:41] house of God verse 20 and our bill upon
[1:27:47] the foundation of the apostles and
[1:27:49] prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the
[1:27:53] chief Cornerstone in whom all the
[1:27:56] building fitly framed together groweth
[1:27:58] unto an holy temple in the Lord in whom
[1:28:03] he also are builded together for an
[1:28:05] habitation of God
[1:28:07] through the spirit let's stand to our
[1:28:08] feet I put this picture back up here
[1:28:10] because it's very fitting for what Paul
[1:28:12] just wrote it's very fitting God came to
[1:28:20] reconcile the body of Christ and he said
[1:28:24] we're not foreigners we're not far out
[1:28:26] here anymore but you know I think I
[1:28:29] dramatize it when I preach it last time
[1:28:30] boy I'd like to hear I like to hear
[1:28:33] those priests blown the trumpets a
[1:28:34] little better boy it's kind of quiet out
[1:28:35] here I'd really like to see what that
[1:28:38] lamb looks like I would like to be there
[1:28:41] how does the priest rightly divide their
[1:28:43] sacrifice how do they offer the fat here
[1:28:45] and how do they do these different
[1:28:46] things I like to see it but I'm not
[1:28:48] allowed in they're not allowed to see
[1:28:51] that I can't get as close to God as I
[1:28:56] like to all we want to be closer to the
[1:28:57] Lord don't you this is what he says he
[1:29:02] says we're not separated anymore
[1:29:05] we're not divided we're one body we're
[1:29:08] fellow citizens with the Saints the
[1:29:12] Bible said and we are built upon the
[1:29:14] foundation of the apostles and prophets
[1:29:19] in whom all the building fitly framed
[1:29:24] together groweth unto a holy temple in
[1:29:27] the Lord so Jesus Christ Seabees and the
[1:29:30] prophets they're like the foundation
[1:29:31] right oh maybe that maybe I'll go to
[1:29:32] this one right that's why the better one
[1:29:34] to go to Jesus Christ is the foundation
[1:29:36] and we're built upon that right 2,000
[1:29:40] years later were these stones at the top
[1:29:42] how many know the Bible says we're
[1:29:44] lively stones we're not dead stone just
[1:29:47] sit here and do nothing for God we have
[1:29:49] a life for God we're supposed to live
[1:29:51] and declare the glory of God we're
[1:29:53] living stones Christ is our cornerstone
[1:29:56] were founded upon him that's why I can
[1:29:59] never be pushed off or I can never lose
[1:30:00] my fitting our footing I can never sink
[1:30:03] in the miry clay because I'm founded on
[1:30:05] a rock amen glory and I'm a part of this
[1:30:10] building my foundation is the holy
[1:30:14] apostles in Christ and here's my
[1:30:17] foundation the book of Ephesians
[1:30:19] book of Galatians went through that I'm
[1:30:23] glad to be a part of that and why do we
[1:30:25] do it verse twenty-two why are we part
[1:30:26] of this building so we can be a
[1:30:28] habitation of God through the Holy
[1:30:30] Spirit in other words God live in me God
[1:30:35] speaking to me God sing through me
[1:30:38] God witness through me God walking me
[1:30:41] God live through me how many want that
[1:30:44] to be their prayer today by God's grace
[1:30:45] let's bow our heads here
[1:30:50] let me pray you that will be a
[1:30:52] habitation of God through the spirit
[1:30:57] also before we pray would anybody say
[1:31:00] raise our hands they protest pray for me
[1:31:01] there's some walls I got a breakthrough

[1:31:27] picture the cross Lord God I know you're
[1:31:29] not on the cross anymore but I'm
[1:31:30] picturing it because it reminds me of
[1:31:32] the effects of the cross all my sins all
[1:31:35] the sins of the church here were placed
[1:31:37] upon you Lord God and now we can picture
