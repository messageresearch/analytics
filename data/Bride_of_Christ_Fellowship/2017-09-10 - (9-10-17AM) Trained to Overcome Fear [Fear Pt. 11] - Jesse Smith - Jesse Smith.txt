so I apologize divorce more than one tambourine playing I kind of lose the beat and then also can be kind of loud in the small room like this if we have numerous tambourines so generally just one

even Wow that makes so much sense if Jesus said father son Holy Ghost and they baptize in the name of Jesus every time that makes perfect sense I never understood that so it's wonderful but in one case perhaps if you need a revelation to see another case he said you don't need a revelation he saw any other needs of snorted by God's grace in heaven for everyone Esther you have a request for a

[Music] [Music] like to continue the series on beer this is part 11 like to preach on trained to overcome fear this more training to overcome this fear how they gave a little preview that on Wednesday night and got caught up trained to overcome fear first John for reading our like to read our scripture about perfect love first John for we read 17 and 18 verse 17 says hearin is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the Day of Judgment because as he is so are we in this world that would have to be the soul of man would it not when the soul of man has the Holy Spirit inside of it you have a part of Christ it's called Christ in you that's the only way we could be as God is to have part of God inside of us verse 18 there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if a man say I love God and hateth his brother he's a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God love his brother also let's have a word of Prayer let's just bow our heads if ever need on your heart this morning just make it known unto God surely he's with us he's mindful of our needs and loves us so very much Heavenly Father we love you so much we love you because you first loved us dear God thank you for being the one who first loved and for Lord creating us and creating mankind Lord this great drama that's unfolding before us Lord as we are at the end time Lord Jesus help us to be faithful help us to play our parts Lord we're believing our part is the wise Virgin in this our Lord God to have our lamps trimmed and clean dear God we thank you for this reading of thy word Lord Jesus I pray you our faith Lord by granting perfect love to operate in our hearts and lives Lord God we give you all the glory we ask that you be glorified forgive us of any trespass that your Holy Spirit flow through us now lord help me to yield to your spirit help each and every one to get in the channel of the Holy Spirit for your glory that you might be honored today in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you means looking at part 11 by the grace of the Lord this series on fear also I'm sister Wendy had requested that I put our Azra Nehemiah Esther series on the church computer along with the Daniel series from this year so I got it on the desktop there so if anybody wants it I don't know if you like to go back and listen the past sermons but if you want them there I think there's 24 on Ezra and Nehemiah and there's course 12 on Daniel we did one per chapter so I just wanted to make sure I share those in case anybody likes to listen to those by the grace of the Lord so let's look at this thought here trained to overcome fear I want to start with the quotation from the testimony raising the dead boy in 1953 I want to start with this quotation because this is kind of where I got my inspiration and then I want to read about a Navy disaster simulator you may not have heard of I want to read about that as we look at train to overcome fear praise God how many how many in training right now you feel the Holy Spirit's training you to overcome all fears Amen you we ought to be by the grace of the Lord if God's with us he's training us to overcome all trials all temptations but especially the spirit of fear the Prophet said that's the greatest hindrance on the church is fear well God back his word or not and so we've got to have confidence and we saw last Sunday we kind of went through the three parts of man last Sunday with perfect love part two and we saw how you got to have all three parts flowing with love your body saw and spirit and we saw to me it was a great revelation I don't know if you remember about the end of the service you know the scripture faith hope and charity came to my heart and brother Sampson Shetty bought this for me last time he was here so he want to say thanks for our hosting so got my new tie on today the first time I wore my new tie but the scripture came to my mind because charity is greater than faith and hope and I thought that's right it struck us at the end of the service how love is the greatest because faith cannot even operate without love we must have full love for Christ in our mind that means any conscious memory reason affection imagination we can't imagine imagine anything evil we can't have any conscious so well I should have did this better or I'm guilty of this we can't let anything bother us we must have love in every area of our human mind especially that's the where the greatest battle is ever fought taking place right there and then if you have that full love of God and mother Bram took it back to John 3:16 he said that's how he could have perfect love when the bull was there right and he had to walk past the bull and the Hornets from the hornet's nest he brought it back to John 3:16 God so loved me amen and if God so loved me how I ought to love his creation as well amen and love all his people praise the Lord so he brought it back to perfect love and John 3:16 and then we saw that that's how perfect love operates we must have full love of God have no nothing in our conscience battling us our hearts the Bible said must condemn us not and then once we have that love then that love can operate faith because I could have confidence that God is going to keep his word because I love him and he loves me praise God and then after that after you have loved faith then the last thing is hope and in Romans chapter 5 verse 4 the Bible said hope is the last of those four stages you have experienced and trials and I kind of got a mixed up right now but I don't have it in front of me but you know it Romans 5 for how the last thing that produced that all this produces tribulation worketh patience there is patience worst works experience and experience works hope amen and so faith I'm sorry charity love faith and hope praise God the greatest of these is love amen because the only way we can have hope is to go through the tribulations with strong faith they men and that happens because we had love of God first love of God to cast out all fears Amen so it is all about perfect love in this hour it's about love programs that divine love is the only thing that's going to make it over there how many know that hallelujah so it's all about the greatest commandment love God with all your being all three parts amen body soul spirit hallelujah so I want to start with this quotation and I got it you know by studying the hivite it tights and everything like that there's all these quotes about this the prophets talking about Abraham and how God promised his seed the the land of Canaan and then it took 400 years for Joshua to get in he talked about now he said it's yours but it's just as full of Hittites and Jebusites and Canaanites and all kinds of enemies they're walled up heavy now it's yours go take it I give it to you but you go get it and he said that's people today if you'd only see when I tell you about divine healing you'd say well brother branham look I was prayed for last night I can't move my hand anymore he said that don't have one thing to do with it not a thing it's yours go get it he said why sure God just didn't go up there and take his brush and sweep them all out and say now come in here you are set down never did God do that and then he quotes James - you show me your faith without your works and I'll show you my faith by my works you've got to do it and you've got to fight for every inch of ground that you have every man in here that's born again of the Spirit of God knows that you've had to fight for every inch of ground how many know you got to fight for every inch there was no victory that was just given to you without you fighting for without you you know quoting the word or denying the symptoms and all these things every born against person of the Spirit of God knows you fight for every inch of ground amen hallelujah toe the mark was Satan isn't that right friends this is not a picnic it's a battleground we never come here to eat cookies and so forth we're in a battle now we all like cookies but we're not come here to eat cookies programs say could you imagine United States Army training a man to set around and eat cookies and so forth why no he gives them a uniform his gun and trains him to get out there and fight and the defend the nation and that's what we've got to do we got to defend our god-given rights what God said it's ours let's stand right toe-to-toe with Satan so Bob Rams encouraging us have sons and daughters of God we're gonna have to battle for every promise to be fulfilled in our lives we have to understand it's not a picnic it's not going to be given to us the rapture is not going to be given to us necessarily as much as we'd say just sit back and do nothing about it we've got something to do praise God our loved ones aren't just gonna you know just give their hearts to God we need to pray for them we need to intercede for them praise God we need to be lights we need to be witnesses we're not going to go to the Statue of Reverend man by doing nothing the Bible said you make your calling and election sure praise God we have something to do and then he says how Satan hasn't got one legal right everything he's got is defeated the only thing is is a scarecrow he can't bother you a man that's born of the Spirit of God there's nothing at all that can harm him glory he said now Satan can push things over on you and just keep shoving you out and shoving you out he said what if I went to my house tonight and I looked there and I saw a big bunch of people we're drunken prostitutes carrying on why I put them out well how you gonna do it you they say well I'm a human this house is made for humans I can live here too but I would say this belongs to me this is my legal possession I've got an abstract deed here at the courthouse that shows this belongs to me and you cannot stay here any longer I'd serve notice on them and they'd have to move if they didn't there's a law downtown that'll make move is that right amen well anything that Satan put upon you in the way of a sickness or whatever it is you every born-again person has an abstract or warrant from God and the Holy Spirit is here to put the devil out amen no matter if he's a cancer tumor cataract whatever is the Holy Spirit we'll put him out if you'll serve him notice in the name of Jesus Christ amen so we must have to be willing to believe that this possession is mine and I can serve the enemy notice in the name of Jesus Christ because he has no legal rights I'm the Lord that heals all our diseases is that right he's wounded for our transgressions with with His stripes we are healed but you got to go over and take it amen he said that's the same thing the Holy Spirit's leading the church today the only thing you say is well now God tells me in my heart that Jesus Christ has healed me this is my possession I take it I go on and it's mine praise the Lord hallelujah he said then you just go on the Holy Spirit just keeps leading you no matter how you're feeling if you go to you're feeling then you're certainly going to be discouraged if you go back to that every time you have a negative testimony every time you look at your symptoms then you fall in right then praise the Lord so can we see we've got to be able to confess the Word of God we preach a sermon on that a few weeks ago driving out the hittites is denying the symptoms and possessing the Word of God by speaking the Word of God how many understand we need to speak the Word of God it's so critical these are legal rights Jesus died for all these blessings Jesus died that every promise might be yours and mine amen but we're gonna have to fight for every inch of ground hallelujah now read this quote when I was studying I thought mine the United States Army and then I just went on YouTube and and a video popped up called the spirit of fear although that's a 40-minute sir I can listen to that and I listen to this sermon and they said something about this I'm gonna read a little article from Popular Mechanics it's just a very short article what it talks about the United States Navy because brother man talk about the United States Army they don't train people to sit there and eat cookies right and and to have an easy life they've got to be disciplined I'm gonna understand discipline praise God they've got to be disciplined they've got to be able to deny themselves and they've got to be able to follow orders despite feelings and that's why the Army has to separate them from their their wives and their children or or their mothers and fathers they've got to be separated like Abraham had to be separated praise God he had to be separated from his family so he could hear the commander's orders amen now this article is called surviving on the USS trailer has anyone ever heard of the USS tre er no one okay well good it's gonna be fresh to everybody that amen so nobody can fall asleep during this one okay nobody can nod your head and look away everybody new to everybody here surviving the USS trailer it's called the Navy's disaster simulator so here's the headline it says night after night the USS Trey ER sometimes known as the unluckiest ship in the Navy takes enemy fire exploding into burning flooded wreckage by confronting mayhem on this replica guided missile destroyer recruits learn lessons that may one day save their lives so this is in Illinois this USS trailer is based in Illinois and I'm going to read through this article the USS trailer is a 210 foot long replica of a guided missile destroyer the vessel rises above a ninety thousand gallon pool of water inside a building at the Navy's Recruit Training Command Center about 35 miles north of Chicago open last year and I don't know what year this was this could be from many years ago I may be 10 years because on the Internet I don't know open last year after six years of planning and construction the 56 million dollar Navy simulator is the most realistic and ambitious in the world can you imagine spending 56 million dollars on a replica battleship here and it's designed to train their recruits before they're actually officially officially sailors in the Navy before they even graduate they have to go to the USS trailer five days a week it bears the brunt of multiple enemy missile attacks that result in simulated deaths injuries and damage but while the scenario is fictional the stakes are real for recruits toward the end of their eight-week basic training course the trailer is their baptism by fire and final exam thanks the baptism of the Holy Ghost I think it's all that stands between them and the right to be called a sailor amen I like that so I skipped a little bit in the article so the Navy let this journalist or whatever he is from Popular Mechanics come and spend a 12-hour shift on the USS trailer what are we talking about training to overcome fear training overcome fear they spent so much money he says we're indoors but I can feel a gentle breeze that carries and has the sound of seagulls that says so they spent all this money to make a simulated experience of a ship that's going to be hit by missiles to train the crew before they become official sailors he said we climb the gangway in teams then we descend in the bowels of the ship the night starts slowly with exercises that involve monitoring gauges standing lookout and coiling lines so they have all these different things they just rotate from one one duty to the next all night 12 hours they do this shift here every 45 minutes or so we returned to the crew living space to visit the head and watch debriefing videos that describe US Navy history what a what an interesting night huh what an exciting night you go from duty to duty then you got to watch Navy history maybe what we wouldn't think would be a very engaging night but that's what they do then just as the Petty Officers start chewing out recruits for drifting off to sleep he said boom an explosion rattles the floor and the lights flicker brace for shock a petty officer shouts we leaned against the walls to prepare for secondary blast then race to Don our battle dress fire resistant hood metal with face guard and long gloves for the next four hours we dash from one scenario to another escaping from a smoke-filled compartment through an emergency hatch and humping 35 pound canisters of 5-inch gun ammunition out of a room slowly filling with water so the Navy has spent almost 60 million dollars probably by now to do all the the touch-up work on it probably 60 million dollars to simulate what is like to be on a battleship that gets hit by enemy fire and so the lights will go out they'll Flickr off and on water will start filling and they're in a ninety thousand gallon tank water starts slowly filling the ship and they're faced with all these different trials sound like your life a little bit God is letting you go through many what seemed like fearful trials but the whole time - god it's simulated praise God God knows what's going to happen God is in control God is really protecting your life amen I like that the intense environment is intended to provide stress inoculation they're trying to inject the the sailors with stress they're trying to create stress they're trying to create fear so in sailors encounter a real catastrophe they'll know they can handle it an often-cited inspiration for the Traer was a three-day struggle to save the USS Cole was crippled by suicide bombers in Yemen in October mm this is all inspired from an attack in the year 2000 am I saying that right amen Yemen is that how I say okay thank you brother Yemen so they got this idea wow this happened in Yemen and so we want to simulate that so the soldiers or the sailors they're not afraid so they can kind of get a taste of what this is going to be like and member they got to go through this in order to be fully baptized by fire to become a fresh recruit never a real not a real recruit but a fresh sold your fresh sailor to be an official sailor I like that it's the baptism by fire it says listen as the night continues the catastrophes grow more taxing right because you've been up all day and you you you go there and then it's a 12-hour shift you can't go and sleep the petty officers will chew you out if you try to go to sleep and the waters rising they got to go from one room to the next room from one job to the next job young and inexperienced never feel like that young inexperienced the recruits are struggling to make the most of their seven weeks of naval education but fatigue is starting the show and he talks about how they had a mistake in the casualty exercise they had a casualty exercise where where they had you know floating soldiers and and they let some of them drown now they weren't real they were dummies you know but they let him drown they didn't get to him in time and so they you know they're so tired they're not able to save lives we these pretend lives on the ship and so they reach a low point and they said that eight they said after we finished lugging the groaning dummy so the dummy even makes noise that's how much detail they put into it up to the sickbay the instructors tear into us nobody likes to get chewed out do they but they been up all day all night working as hard as they can with waters rising and fires they have all these simulations in here they let some dummies die and they got to get pulled up and shoot out nice and he says the instructor tears into us look he's dead a petty officer says as he rips open the stretchers velcro straps to show us how we fastened them incorrectly he says you killed them because they didn't put the straps on correctly sometime around dawn so they're up all night almost 24 hours sometime around dawn the captain comes on the intercom the enemy ship that attacked us has been captured and the damage to our own vessel has been contained amid the relief we hardly feel exhaustion it says the traitors DNA comes from theme parks says a civil engineer who oversees the backstage operations there's fans on the pier to create the sensation of wind there's wave machines to make the pool of water seemed like a real ocean they're sent machines to recreate the smell of the sea there's even artificial guano spattered here and there to offer the extra touch of realism he says I'm particular curves to see how the mass casualty exercise is staged for me this is the most intense part of the whole evening trying to save casualties so that these dummies that look like you know they're bleeding or or they're there they're wounded or they're gonna die and they save that to the very end do they have enough strength and focus to save other lives even I think Christ is in that business too don't you Christ wants us to persevere through difficult times to overcome all of our fears in order save one soul praise God that's right he said the one this is the one that sent my pulse racing nearest to the level it would hit during the actual catastrophe walking back over the tilting floors in the coma day so that the floors would even tilt they had such a control he said I can hardly recognize the place even the dismembered by dummy hanging from the ceiling looks no more menacing than a department store mannequin so once it's all cleaned up it is the fear seems to to move away the smoke effect it turns out is an aerosol of glycol that looks just like the real thing but doesn't cause lung damage strobe lights mimic the flickering of electrical fires and subwoofers vibrate under the floor to simulate explosions heating pads inside a steel door approximately the high temperatures caused by a raging fire on the far side and electrically heated oils produced the odor of burning wires so they have all these all these aways to simulate what it's like to be in a ship that's sinking mine now the the journalist ends by saying that he said when they left at dawn the next morning that game a navy had to put on and he said he said I like that I appreciate their kindness to give me the Hat but he said I didn't earn this I haven't been here eight weeks of training I just went through one night and they've got to do it I think every at the end I think every Friday or every last week they've got to go and do this work in order to become a real sailor how many I appreciate that story I heard that thought mine if the US Army will spend a hundred million dollar I'm sorry the Navy will spend a hundred million dollars to help their soldiers overcome fear how much more will Jesus Christ help his body his army overcome fear and doubt and unbelief amen if the army if the Navy will do that how much more will God help you and I he will train us to overcome all fears and remind me of Jonah Jonah is in the belly of a whale and he sees all these things and he caught a revelation these are just simulations glory and that's what these soldiers could have said not but they're tired right so it's so simulated it's hard to see these things as simulations but church if the revelation of God could strike our hearts a day will see that sicknesses or or discouragements or trials or frustrations or depressions or whatever it may be they're just simulations right the Devils try to place it on us and but God is in control he won't give you a simulation you cannot handle a man you won't you won't let that water rise that you'll drown amen he really won't let you lose a soul praise God because God is in control he's allowing you to go through simulations that your fear will be cast out so you experience it but you'll know the next battle you'll be able to overcome any men I think that's a beautiful thought right there yeah yeah and then I listen to God called man yesterday from 1958 well Aaron said when God gets ready to do something in the supernatural realms he usually gets a man he can put his trust in and anoints him and sends him out and he's fearless at the job that's the kind of men we need today not polish scholars but men who know God in the power of his resurrection glory then he gives some examples and we'll just go through a few brief examples for instance there was a man in the Bible by the name of Moses who had got all of his training he knowed all the theology he knew everything that he should know if he'd have needed education or education he could teach the Masters in in Egypt he didn't need one thing and the Bible tells us that he was learned and all the wisdom of the Egyptians why he could teach their scholars he could teach their scientists he was key to the very point when it comes to intellectual but yet it taking God 40 years listen 40 years to beat all of that out of him there in the sand and when he got out all his intellectual conceptions of God beat out of him out there in the stands the metal was ready to be molded over amen glory and we know the burning bush was like the baptism of the Holy Ghost for Moses we know that that's when he got and God said I'm going with you he took off his shoes that we know it's it's dramatized that God stepped inside of him inside the shoes amen hallelujah so we see this that you know he was trained up so intellectually for a third of his life the second third God had to beat it all out of him now we know Israel wasn't ready after Moses first forty years but also Moses wasn't ready either because God works on both ends praise God Moses was not ready you know sometimes we get too hard on Israel they should have received Moses well maybe they should have but Moses wasn't ready either he was trying to kill a man to save him right a murderer he wasn't ready either because he had all this intellectualism pounded into his mind and God said I know how to train individuals I'm gonna send my prophet out there in the wilderness to beat all that intellectualism out him for 40 years I know how to train my men praise the Lord amen everybody said that's the way god takes his man and beats out all their fears and all their intellectuals how many want their fears beaten out how many want your intellectuals beat out I'll be the first to raise my hand I know I want to try to understand everything I just want to believe it we want to we want to have the Holy Spirit reason and discern we do on that but when it comes down to our lives we don't want to intellectually reason or trying to understand intellectually we just want to believe God's Word amen and God Butler have said God knows how to do that he knows how to beat out all of our fears and our intellectuals he said then the great master Potter puts them on the wheel and begins to mold them over again workmen worthy he says it's God's man and listen this who could train a man more than God himself the Navy does a pretty good job don't think I think spending 60 million dollars don't you think that's a pretty good job I think that's a fantastic job I don't think I'd want to go in there for a 12-hour shift myself at least without seven weeks of training previously and try to last and go through the pressures and the noises and the strain the stress they're trying to inoculate you with fear fill you with stress so that you'll learn to overcome it but who could train a man more than God himself the Prophet said think about your life how God's trained you to this point and start thinking about that as we go a little bit further here think about what God has trained you with over the course of your life brother Branham said watch the way he trains them and then he goes through I remember I didn't finish the sermon because the last hour was prayer line but when I listened he went through three more men or three men including Moses went through Moses which we just went through then he went to David then he went to a lie shut those three examples and then he says he's running out of time he does the prayer line there so the Prophet said God had to take Moses out in the wilderness for forty years to beat out all the spheres remember he was scared of Pharaoh church right the Bible said they had to wait till the Pharaoh died and then a new Pharaoh rose I didn't know Moses right he wasn't mad at Moses and so brother Ram said you know he Moses and his wife had many arguments or temper tantrums out there on the backside of the desert in other words God was building patience with him God was trying to get him away from his intellectualism all the wisdom he learned in Egypt God is trying to beat that out of him and God took 40 years to beat this man a church we get impatient after one year we get impatient sometimes only as humans sometimes we've got to battle that impatience we get patient after 10 years well brother Jesse it's been 10 years since this and that net and gods like I used 40 with Moses I used 75 with Abraham right or in 25 extra after that to get into the promise why who could train a man more than God himself God is training us Church to get all of our intellectual pride out right and all of our fears about our calling in our life watch the way God does it watch how he does it he may do you like Moses he may give you a revelation right away I've got I got a ministry I got something to do I got something new for God but then you may fail and he may have to separate you and take you far away in order to beat all of your previous understanding out of you and then anoint you and send you back to do God's will he may do you like that but Arab said he may do you like David he said David had to be all alone he said all alone in the Shepherd's field that was David's battle that's the second when he goes to after Moses he said look at David look how God trained David he had to get him all alone away from his seven other brothers and get him out there singing and dancing and praise God with his sheep payment just the shepherd and his sheep praise God he had to get them all alone out there program said look at David's rugged training alone in the wilderness hallelujah Church don't we don't you feel like that sometimes in the church we feel like just so we're all alone we're one little one little fold in the wilderness praise God we're one little Church here in Akron Ohio just like they're all around in different places one little church there one little church there and program said that's God's rugged training he said he didn't send David to a school he sent him all alone to be a shepherd amongst the Sheep praise God he said when he's all alone out there brother man brother as a David now can hear the still small voice of the Lord so sometimes when you feel like you're alone Church the reason is so you can hear God's voice remember God who could train a man better than God who could train sisters better than God who could train our brothers better than God so Moses had to be separated from all his family all of his previous riches and and all those things David started his life separated and that's how he met God separate as a shepherd and sheep out in the waters all alone but around said David was not contaminated with the things of the world because he was all alone amen I've had brother my brother Tim Myers remember when he was here he started he actually started the meetings here in Akron in 2003 if I'm not mistaken maybe 2002 but he's called me numerous times over the years that we've talked and he said you know he said thank you said thank God for brother Brooks you know protecting us well Brooks never told us oh gods all these special meetings and and which there's nothing wrong with special meetings when you're mature but he said while we were immature you know because brother Tim now lived in North Carolina there's a lot of churches around there which can be good but some of them are off the word and they have what the Bible says enticing spirits they'll major on a minor right and they'll entice in the same which eventually leads into sin and and if it's not confessed that leads into all kinds of public sins but brother Tim and I would talk and he said well I'm just so thankful he said when I moved down here I didn't realize all the fanaticism that's around us having so many churches now God let some people grow up amongst those churches he said but we should be so thankful that brother Brooks protected us from those things and just tried to protect us like a shepherd with his sheep amen and I thought that's so true because of that we could hear the voice of the Lord and not be contaminated by things of the world amen but when I said God wants his shepherds to stand up for the Sheep praise God Rahab then God let up bear come into the David we know that and he said the Shepherd understand they're all alone in the wilderness he had to stand up and defeat that bear with a sling but my man said God God wasn't done because God knew there was a guy at the head he said so God had to raise the standard got it a lot of trial going that he could raise David's faith a little higher he said he understand the greatest of all beasts the lion the lamb said David took out a knife Church a hand knife brother Ram said that he said that lion killed all these men with one slap oh you said a few slaps of the paw he said he said David took a hold of that mane of the line and took his knife and stabbed the line and killed the line by the power of God amen so David knew what it was like to defeat the king of the beasts right but God raised that enemy in order to raise David's faith God was training his man to defeat a Goliath amen now if only he could have defeated that adultery and murder right David you understand what I'm saying that's the power of the Holy Ghost in this hour are you with me Church it was wonderful that Goliath was defeated hallelujah when it went off but even more wonderful if he would not have committed adultery and murdered Uriah are you with me but Rance not and leave a person with the Holy Ghost could come in adult you this since I believe because the comforter is living inside of them amen and the Bible said when the person commits adultery the Bible said they're destroying their own soul proverbs 6:23 that's the scripture the Prophet said God can't use cowards he's all about David and how God watch how he trains them amen he said God wants gallant men not cowards he said God can only use a man who has faith hallelujah a man who could train a man more than God himself now he went a little bit on Elijah he said Elijah's training was first seeing the supernatural and Elijah he saw the supernatural God in Elijah he said but before that Elijah's training was driving the oxen to plow straight rows his brother and said after he lied you would leave he said he lied she would need to train some more men and if you look at Jay who anointed Jay who and different things like that he had some many I had to keep put in order by God's grace and point them on the straight and narrow so he grew up farming right and he got the drive he had to drive those oxen right he had to drive them and encourage them and move them and make them go straight praise God and that's the training that God gave him but once he saw the supernatural I show the prophet of the hour he said can I follow your knees and you know what I just said he did kind of give him kind like a little bird buek you know he said no just go back but license like no I'm gonna sell out he went back and you know killed the oxen and had a feast with his family and then he left and sold out praise God and bromance said Elisha knew what it was to put your hand to the plow and not look back because jesus said a man shouldn't put his hand to the plow and then look back at the world and say oh I really missed this from the world he said he'll I sure knew what he was doing praise God he sold out completely to follow the word of the hour God was training Elisha amen that's the way God takes his man and beats out all their fears and their intellectuals years and years of training years of training years of loneliness can I say like that years of feeling de-stressed years of battling fear no doubt Moses would fear that Pharaoh's really got it for me I could never go back and you know those forty years he was waiting how could I go back mine I know I know my mother told me this I know my mother was a real saint I know she said I was deliver my and just year after year of wrestling with this who could train a man more than God Himself amen God lets us go for years and months and weeks and I'm got you on the reverse order but it goes years and decades right and it's rugged training it's not easy training but that's how God trains a man and woman watch the way he trains and he says all these simulations that rise up in our lives amen aren't you glad God's the living reality praise God these trials are just simulations we just got to stay with the word we just got to be faithful right we just got to obey the Lord love the Lord and rise above all sin and all these simulations will end one day praise God that's exactly right I'm going to judges chapter six I just want to review Gideon real quick it's been a couple years since I've preached on him I just want to review some of his faith and let's look how God trained him judges chapter 6 because when I preach on getting what spoke to me from the Holy Spirit was how he overcame so much fear God keeps got God kept saying don't be afraid don't fear don't fear and then I hear brother Branham say the church's biggest problem is fear fear fear and so I believe this is very helpful for us today judges chapter six now you know the story the millions are many nights are taking all they're all their harvest and so they're hiding out they're leaving there but their lands are supposed to be possessing and they're living in caves and mountains they start crying out to God we're poor we have no food and God sent a prophet and God rebuked them through the Prophet because of and they're in bondage because of their own sins and then a verse 10 chapter 6 he said I am the Lord your God fear not the gods name writes in whose land ye dwell but she have not obeyed my voice so when people get in trials and they crowded to God God will remind them of the past God will remind them of the training and God will always say you need to obey my word think about the training God's allowing you in right now what kind of training is it you feel all alone you feel like the water is rising all the time like the Navy potential sailors you like the waters rising around you you feel like it's casually time you're just trying to save a soul you do anything to save a soul the training God knows how to train us amen and God said don't fear so when God sent the Prophet the prophets last words where don't fear obey the word of the Lord obey God's words stand behind God's word amen and watch it live hallelujah and then how was God training Gideon mother bear instead of Gideon was just a farmer and brother and said Gideon went out to church that day he heard the private preach he said and the Prophet went off the scene we don't even know where the Prophet went and so then Gideon goes hiding he hides right he's threshing wheat the Bible said and he hides and God says you're a mighty man of Valor and then he asked this great question my man said it was a scriptural question if God be with us why then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of what does God say God says go in your might but yet he's afraid he said have not i sent thee he says where's all the miracles he said go you be the miracle I think let the miracle flow through you I'm gonna use you for a miracle praise God you see that going this thy might you've got some faith inside you get in you just gotta exercise that faith crisis in the ship you just gotta wake Christ up a man does every see that he said oh by my family's poor how can I be a saviour for Israel my family's poor I'm the least in my father's house and God makes the least the first many the last shall be first hallelujah testimony was I'm the least and God said I'm gonna make you first look at his training just a farmer a fearful farmer who heard the prophets word and he's like well I want to see this word fulfilled where is the God that God sent us a prophet I want to see the miracles and God said you go and be a miracle you go and have the Word of God in your heart how many want the Word of God in their heart today that you can be the miracle you can go in the might of God praise the Lord now in verse 17 he asked for his first sign he said give me a sign that I've talked with you so get in before he has enough faith he needs signs from God to know that he's that so that he's not fearful and I've said this before this is how many of us some of us operate maybe we asked for God for a sign if God gives us a sign then he'll then we'll act upon it like the last time brother Simon went to Thailand he's going in a couple of weeks here but he said last time he went he he prayed and fast and said God give me two signs I'm supposed to go and I guess he was at work and saw the word Thailand on the truck really big I can't remember the exact ones and he said he saw two or three more witnesses I think he got four witnesses and he asked for two or three or something like that something along those lines in other words I know he told me God gave him more signs than what he wanted God went above and beyond because there's an element of fear wouldn't you have a little element of fear going to a place you never been there before well sure you would if you're if you're human right and so he asked God for two or three signs and God gave him more than he asked for and then he said then the brother then the third the last sign was the brother calm said have you made your decision yet has God given you the signs and he said that was the final sign he said how can I turn it down and look how God blessed gave him 14 baptisms praise God and angels rejoice at one sinner that repents see that so many times we operate this way Lord I believe you're sending me but give me a sign first so that was the first sign God gave him the sign right the fire came down consume the sacrifice and who's talking with an angel but then God said go clean out the altars of your father in other words if you want to do them if you want to see a miracle go clean out your father's house anything any sin left over in your father father's house you've got to clean it out praise the Lord you see how God demands cleanliness see how God demands holiness God asks for sanctification praise God before I Drive out the many nights and deliver you and use you as a miracle worker we've got to drive out all the abominations in the church amen you've got to throw down the groves amen remember the Grove was the hiding place they go in the wilderness and they are in the Grove rather the grove of trees and they have sex acts they sacrifice babies all kinds of things they'd hide out and do these sins and God's cutting down those God had a Gideon cut down those groves remember what Gideon meant Heuer he was a cutter praise God mother have said profits are hewers they cut out the word of the Lord egg they cut with the Word of God amen and so Gideon does this he obeys the Word of God he cuts down there his father's grows and exposes all the sin and now gods get ready to use him amen it's exactly right so first he asked for a sign God gives it to him then he says now you obey you go drive out all the abominations of your father's house I preached that message in Minnesota I don't know if your mother's a couple years ago when brother brother Juan asked me to go out there and preach and I preached it rises to be near the service and as soon as I did the altar call sister come up and she said it's so hard I wanted to come up to the altar right when you preached it at the beginning of the message but she said I've been hiding out I'm a mom of so many kids I've been hiding out in my laundry room watching Netflix series of TV shows and she's weeping and crying and she said when you preach on Groves hiding out and I was think I was using a cellphone as an example I usually do you know her tablet she said as you were preaching that I was so convicted she said I appreciate the rest of your message but when that was preached that's what convicted me god knows what he's doing Church amen you see that's what people you got it we have to make this word speak to us today is that abomination hiding out and watching cussing swearing and think about all those women and men kissing all the fornication that's an abomination Church when they know better claiming to be in the message of the hour God help all of us to live a sanctified life and not hide out in sin right but this is what Gideon had to do he had to cut out any hidden sin in his father's house hallelujah then God could use him to save souls and to save the whole nation of Israel the second sign number was put a fleece on the wolf floor if it be dude on the fleece only and that's a verse 36 and 37 of chapter 6 he said if there if we dry up all in all the earth beside then shall I know all right that and then God let it do so when he rose up the Bible said he thrust the fleece together and all the water came out God gave him more than what he asked for church if you sincerely ask God for something God's gonna give you more than what you asked for just like we brother Simon just like we'd get in like with anyone who really cries out to God I want to be in your perfect will I have a burden do something for you Lord God give me a sign so I won't be afraid if you cry out God's gonna hear your cry and then the third sign he asked for was if I flip it over he said don't be hot against me he said but let this once more with the fleece let it now be dry only on the fleece side and upon all the ground let there be do and God did so that night and then remember God right after that he rose up he assembled the army together the first sermon he preached was anyone that's afraid I do you 32,000 leave the camp that's his first sermon see Gideon was afraid but now he's overcoming it but now he's got to rid all the fear out of the army and so 22,000 leave he's left with 10,000 and then God said go down to the river all those that bow down like they're bowing to God he said all them have to leave right and he's left with 300 all those that lap it like a dog into the but I preach on that you know the the Britannica said or nothing' Britannica but the Bible dictionary said the dogwood would lick and sigh have his eyes open and so it typed how the the Israelites who weren't gonna be there we're used to bowing down to idols and didn't keep their eyes on the battle praise God brother Graham said the same thing about that they got to keep your eyes on the battle and so God said now I've got 300 and you remember there was one more fear that Gideon had it's in verse 10 of chapter 7 God sends the little fear because now these 300 men surround the army that's the multitude of the sand of the sea church 300 men and he's got one for you still got living a fear and God is so merciful God's merciful when you have a little bit of fear left he's merciful because he still wants you to do the job he's called you to do verse 10 but God said but if thou fear to go down go thou with furrow thy servant down to the hosts and thou shalt hear what they say and afterwards shall bind hands be strengthened to go down into the hosts then he went down with first servant under the outside of the armed men that were in the host you remember the story they walk up to a tent he's walking by the tent and he overhears a midnight soldier and he just woke up from a nightmare well was a nightmare for him but it was a blessing for Gideon he said all he said I saw a barley bread a loaf of barley bread rolling down a hill and it hit our tents and all the midnight tents fell and he said that the barley loaf is nothing but Gideon amen and then when getting heard that the Bible said he fell on his knees and started worshiping see God will give you everything you need so you're fearless watch how God trains his men nobody can train a man better than God hallelujah so if you need signs God will give you signs if you need a burning bush God will give you a burning bush if you need a line and bear God will give you a line and bear I'll give you a slingshot he'll give you whatever you have need up wait upon the Lord obey his voice and watch how God trains you to overcome for his name watch him do it nobody can do it better than God Church nobody can do it like he can we just have to sit still let him beat out all the fear and all the intellectualism out of our lives to think we know more about it than everybody else pummel ourselves like Moses had to like Gideon had to getting that it put God to his test like the Bible said with ties and offerings prove me getting is the same thing with this this America Lord you wanted to send me prove it to me please prove that you're gonna use me and 299 other men to defeat this innumerable army and God did it huh me no God did it praise God amen beautiful picture there now let me try to give me about 10 more minutes to close here by God's grace yeah one more thought I want to bring with this here this OK by God's grace are you glad he's training you to overcome fear this is more like a encouraging message to encourage you that it's patience in patience possess our souls he will push out he'll beat out all fear all intellectual understanding any any lusts or pride or whatever's hindering our walk with God and keeping us from God's will for our lives he'll beat it out we've just got to stay in his training how they'd hear yeah I want to close now kai would you put this slideshow up here by God speak I just want to show this last picture here I want to close with this just give me about 10 more minutes I just want to show how we're trained to overcome fear I just want to show our brother branham was trained to overcome fear is this okay I just want to close with this a few weeks ago I preached on this those if you look in Joshua 3:10 God lifts that list these seven nations that were greater and mightier than Israel and God was going to drive them all out and I'm you know and I I started thinking about this and and you know I really believe this is a Golden Nugget myself but that's just me you know but I started looking at what they did you know Canaanite met merchants or possessions and that to me it typed for the New Testament love of money and possessions and things Hittites means sons of half and half means dread or fear that's clearly interpreted by their names Hittites were the Gibeonites and what they did now their name didn't mean anything significant but what they did was they made a league with Israel and that types friendship or compromise with the world that's where I get that perizzites meant they were farmers they worked the ground and the the ground represents the the flesh because the man with the one tail buried his talent in the earth the earth the ground so he buried it instead of putting it to work for the kingdom of God that represents carnal flesh means carnal right your carnal mind had Paul said that first Corinthians three girgashites means those who dwell in the clay and and the Bible said if we're not upon the rock then we're in the miry clay so clay represents instability not obeying the Word of God yet we know it and these are all battles again remember these are all battles that we face after we've crossed Jordan right after you're born again so you have great training that takes place before you're born again and even greater training that takes place after you're born again it's exactly right am rights were giants and so I call this a giant lust or a great fleshly lusts they were giants and then Jebusite means strong jabu jabu jabus in the dictionary one of the names is stronghold one of the name mean the meaning of the name is stronghold and a stronghold is the complex in 2nd Corinthians chapter 6 the Bible said we can't build up strongholds and I was just just inspired me Church let's so let's just close with a few minutes that look at how brother Branham had to deal with all these so can ever understand where I'm kind of going with this I want to show you how God trained a modern-day prophet many of these will be familiar to you so just bear with me maybe they won't I don't know so brother Branham said the first the Canaanites will be loving money I mean no the Prophet battled money brother branham's talked about the three things ministers faced and he said I wasn't much afraid he said of the popularity of women but the test of money that was the thing that bothered me so brother Rams greatest attempt a freeze got the Holy Ghost now was the test of money right he got to a spot he said for nine years my meetings were going great so let's see 47 plus 9 I've been 56 right he said my meetings were growing great he said I get a thousand letters a day but he said all of a sudden 56 of course we know America rejected the gospel in that year he said all of a sudden went down from a thousand letters of dates he said about 75 I got the quotes if you want them but the time time he said then he went to California and I lost $5,000 in one meeting and the next meeting I lost $10,000 so now he's in debt $15,000 and you remember what he did he went home and told his wife and Billy Paul I'm done on the field he said daddy won't you Billy said daddy won't to you if you don't preach the gospel he said I'm still gonna preach I never said I'm not gonna breach he said but I told God but I said I told God that if I go on the field I'll never go into debt and if I do I'll quit and Billy Paul got brotherman said god bless Billy Paul later for this Billy Paul said some inspiring words to encourage his daddy he said daddy God never told you to come off the field he said you made that promise to God right God never said if you get in debt you have to quit preaching out in the field and then God took brother Ram through a few visions remember there's a fishing vision a fish fishing vision about the lure and there's someone there's so much involved here but then he the third mission was the little tent so after he's struggling you know I'm going off the field I'm gonna go down there to Mister he said a bar and ask him I get my job back he said God showed him the vision of the third pole and he said that encouraged him to get back on the field praise God so God gave him three visions don't leave the field stay on the field but you see how he battled money he battled money so much so that when he saw the debt he thought he failed God but he never failed God it was a test to overcome the canaanites amen hallelujah brother and thought he failed God but he didn't fail God God was just showing him your ministry is gonna change a man we're going to the big meetings anymore now we're going down to the third poll the opening of the word the spoken word hallelujah everybody see that he had a battle this in his ministry this was 1956 he had to battle that I'm leaving the field and God had to use his son and wife was weeping crying begging him not to leave the field but he said I'm a God a promise so we can see that what a temptation that was money this is something he battled after getting in the promised land next fear brother Ram said before he started preaching he said all the ministers told him his visions were other Devils remember that dr. Davis and he said all the local ministers said it was the devil he went to his cave there in Jeffersonville to pray he said God take this away from me and you remember late into the night God sent the angel the Lord and the angel Lord told him not to fear in fact let me read the exact quote here so then you can have that because he said you'll pray for kings and potentates and monarchs and all these things and then he says he's notable words he says no fear he says this he's in my commission he said I'd be given two signs when I told him that I was afraid people wouldn't believe me this is the 1946 he said I'd be given two signs as the prophet Moses was given to vindicate or make plain to any people that I'm telling you the truth but the angel says I'm gonna send you forward brother and I'm afraid they're not gonna believe me and God said I'm gonna give you signs to take away your fear and I read this a few weeks ago 1955 brother Hannah said night after night he said I stand before witch doctors and critics they try to throw spells on me challenged me to duels and never one time I say by the grace of God has one speck of fear ever hid my heart can you imagine that witch doctors cursing with blood and they're doing all kinds of evil things and not one time did he ever a speck of fear why because the Lord told him I'll be with you and I've given you signs in that beautiful Church hallelujah he was afraid how can I do this and the angel says I'm giving you the signs I'm giving you power hallelujah how many know that brother Branham was scared of dying until 1960 how many knew that in the fifth seal he tells us that and the fifth seal if you listen to that he thought was scared of dying he thought I would be a said I thought I'd be a spook or cloud he said I thought I'd be a cloud floating past and I'd wave and say hi brother Neville how're you doing he said but I could never reach out and touch him he said I didn't want to be a spook he said then God took him behind the curtain of time in 1960 I remember that by God's grace so he battled this for how many years of ministry here over 20 23 years he battled those Hittites for 23 years until God gave him victory and said you're not gonna fear you know where you're going you know it's beyond the curtain amen how did it yeah it's exactly right can you see how the Prophet battled these things these these these nations greater than him right these spirits greater than him see how he battled that we might battle the same church Hittites was a compromise in 1963 brother BAM told a story about how a and is's is your life were the gospel it's some Pentecostal leader he doesn't give the name that I that I read but he's talking about how the Pentecostals won't come to the spiritual feasts he's talking minute typing it to one of Jesus's parables they won't come to the feast they they're not they make light of Jesus invitation to come to the feast in Matthew 22 minister offered him money if he compromised and not preached on certain doctrines finish up here the man looked at him and said he says a shame that you're taking he said you can hardly buy yourself a meal look you're a Robertson look how all these other men and you they don't even have 100 the ministry you got AI said yeah that's right that's right he said my group will take you in as one of our brethren will give you the right hand of fellowship will charter you a plank imagine having your own charter plane and I'll give you your wages of five hundred dollars a week or more if you want it which today equals to two hundred seventeen thousand dollars a year and people are selling out the message for less than that and he said we'll pay you five hundred dollars a week which is over like I said two hundred thousand my man said well what do you what else did not preach he said oh you know your baptism and you kind of baptize like oneness and said oh he said yeah you know the initial evidence you got to preach the tongues are initial evidence they said oh the women preachers just a few things like that if you'll just compromise with a goodnights remember God told Joshua don't make any league when you come in that land don't make any compromise don't take their money and not preach the truth preach all the truth amen hallelujah if God so clothe the grass of the field how much more will he clothe you and I hallelujah if God feeds the sparrows and who they don't even plant or reap Jesus says right or reap or so if God feeds them how much more will he feed us o us of little faith at times right he's with us he's gonna feed us he's gonna help us he said uh-huh he said you know I'm surprised that one servant of God would ask another servant of God after paying the tribute to me like you did calling me a prophet and knowing the word Lord or the revelation of the word comes the prophet and turnaround dr. Pope he calls him and woods okay maybe it is dr. poopy and would ask one servant of God to compromise on one revelation amen hallelujah that was in 1963 he overcame the Hittites he preached for all those years Church all those years and he's still battling some of these great compromises imagine being offering you offer two hundred thousand dollars if you'll just compromise and don't don't talk about this and he turned it down hallelujah by the power of God God knows how to train men hallelujah that's right church all right parasites Karl this is the ground farmers carnal mindedness I just go some quick examples brother random uses carnal mind when his mother-in-law called those Pentecostal people a bunch of trash I had to learn from that experience use his carnal mind and he compromised where we're not compromising she's his carnal mind he's thinking yeah I better not take his or her daughter out there amongst those Pentecostal people brother random catered to the men in South Africa and got amoebas remember that carnal minded he should not have left and the angel said you'll suffer for that and he got amoebas yet Church did he already have the Holy Ghost yeah he's already born-again God knows how to beat out every infirmity out of us God knows how to beat out I say any weakness out of us if we just wait upon the Lord I'm finishing up girgashites worst was the clay and brother branham battled Protestant denomination no ministers his whole ministers whole ministry in fact when he was preaching the church ages in 1960s I was listening to all those and reading through those where the RAM said the revelation of the mark of the beast finally struck him during that series and then afterwards if you watch the quotes then he's got enough confidence to say thus saith the Lord denominationalism is the mark of the beast because he saw how the mark of the beast was working you know kind of tempted Polycarp a little bit we've talked about that a little bit am

good church God is training us to overcome all of our trucks now I'm very thankful for that many tires we know maybe understand why our life has all these different brows we don't understand God is doing the training God wants us to learn to fight for every inch of ground and stand toe-to-toe Satan I love that that's the way God takes this man beats out of all of the speakers and all the intellectuals who could train a man more think I'm self watch the way strange them this train you if you despise I think about your life think about the training you had to endure it's very valuable to God God has allowed simulations to come we call in symptoms maybe it's loneliness like David maybe it's fear like Moses afraid for four years maybe it's David the suspense of great beasts and great giant animals coming at you unexpected you got to the jump in your life maybe it's like I should work in a group dry driving in a straight line keeping your keeping your walk straight with the law bringing you the bride say like oh then you can yourself [Music] let's having that no one can train a man better than God itself you've been full confidence but that's training for your life Heavenly Father you saw a hands Lord you promised to be an ever present help in time of trouble or your training up to overcome or worse tracking message to may you give us the patience Lord may give us the

that when a man offers an 220000 he says absolutely not the about these important money the revelation of the message are more important than houses and lands and money thank you Jesus for trading your profit in such a way help us so watch how you're draining our lives so we don't get discontented we don't hit the scourge we don't get depressed because you know how to train a manor with your school your puppets that is so rugged that's so true David's rugged training Moses Elijah Gideon brother branham such rugged training rejection no no it was a big part of that or company but we're confident that you care for us because we care for your word and your word says you died for us first based upon your life the minister now going to fill us with strengthen the inner man may we be
