[41:00] there okay revelation 3 verse 7 we read
[41:08] seven eight and nine
[41:10] let's read seven together and I'll read
[41:12] eight and nine so let's begin with seven
[41:14] on three one two three and to the angel
[41:18] of the church in Philadelphia write
[41:20] these things
[41:21] he that is holy he that is true he that
[41:25] hath the key of David he that openeth
[41:27] and no man shutteth and shutteth and no
[41:31] man openeth now read verse eight and I
[41:32] myself I know thy works Christ knows our
[41:36] works this morning I have set before
[41:38] thee an open door and no man can shut it
[41:41] for thou hast a little strength and has
[41:44] kept my word and has not denied my name
[41:49] now verse nine is where we're going to
[41:51] end Lord willing I'm going to kind of
[41:53] well at least when I studied the Holy
[41:56] Spirit let me pass verse eight to go to
[41:59] verse nine behold I'll make them of the
[42:02] synagogue of Satan which say they are
[42:05] Jews and are not but do lie behold I
[42:11] will make them to come and worship
[42:13] before thy feet and to know that I have
[42:17] loved thee what a striking thought there
[42:20] Jesus was going to make sure all the
[42:22] liars knew who the people were that he
[42:26] really loved what a striking thought
[42:29] well that's just by adds a word of
[42:31] Prayer just like if you just have an eat
[42:33] on your heart just maybe you raise your
[42:34] hand to the Lord as we approach the Lord
[42:36] today have any father we love you Lord
[42:38] God and you pray you speak to us through
[42:40] this thy word have any father thank you
[42:42] for these red letter words Lord God the
[42:44] words of thy Son Jesus where we know
[42:47] there's no prophet today that's
[42:49] physically on the scene so we know the
[42:50] Prophet is the Holy Ghost so we're
[42:52] asking the supernatural prophet of the
[42:54] Holy Ghost to break his word to us Lord
[42:57] speak Lord to us help me Lord God may be
[43:00] revealed in your word revealed in power
[43:03] revealed in simplicity Lord God Lord
[43:06] that your people might receive you and
[43:08] rejoice Lord and let these holy words
[43:11] change them let the word be imparted to
[43:14] their souls in Jesus Christ's name I
[43:16] never said amen god bless you didn't see
[43:18] the praise God so we like to
[43:28] switch over Malachi we have just some
[43:29] quotes today by the grace of Lord and
[43:31] some scriptures to show by the God's
[43:34] grace we're looking at the Philadelphia
[43:40] Church age which was from 1750 to 1906
[43:44] and the messenger was John Wesley we
[43:47] spent part one looking at John Wesley's
[43:50] life and so we looked into his life and
[43:53] the white or the life of his mother
[43:55] Susannah Wesley is it not switching over
[43:57] okay let me get this and I hope you were
[44:00] blessed by that I was truly inspired by
[44:02] that by God's grace to see the sacrifice
[44:04] of Susanna Wesley Knight is she had 19
[44:06] children but only 10 of them lived and
[44:10] she just did everything she could do to
[44:13] make sure her children heard the Word of
[44:14] God and she would meet with them
[44:16] individually you know and so forth at
[44:18] night and would administer to them even
[44:21] when their her husband was out so John
[44:25] Wesley of course being the most famous
[44:27] you know that the messenger of the age
[44:30] he was the man of God who preached the
[44:34] message of sanctification which was
[44:36] cleanliness in heart and life that's
[44:39] what sanctification is cleanliness in
[44:41] heart in life how many 1 a a pure heart
[44:43] before God a clean heart before God
[44:45] that's John Wesley preached that he
[44:47] lived from 1703 to 1791 he lived 87
[44:53] years preaching 800 sermons a year my
[44:56] and traveling thousands of miles by
[44:58] horseback truly he was a star in the
[45:00] hand of God could you say amen to that
[45:02] truly he was a star of the seven stars
[45:05] truly he was a star what an example he
[45:07] is for us so looking at part three this
[45:09] morning and then we'll look at worship
[45:11] you know tonight we'll just do Bible
[45:12] study on true worship by God's grace you
[45:17] know we're looking at this age right
[45:19] here of the yellow here this is the
[45:20] sixth church age here the battle which
[45:23] we'll get to a little bit today will
[45:24] begin this is the synagogue of satan'
[45:26] that's what they battled most was people
[45:29] that said they were believers but were
[45:31] not we would call that a very deceptive
[45:35] enemy right because today you know
[45:38] Christianity is widely popular around
[45:40] the world
[45:41] but we know Jesus said there still be
[45:44] very few that find the way to true
[45:46] salvation today so we know there's a
[45:48] great deception going on today and they
[45:51] were battling just as we are as we are
[45:52] in our day synagogues of states and
[45:55] churches that said they were true
[45:56] churches but were lying they were not
[45:59] true churches and so that's what John
[46:01] Wesley and the Saints in those days had
[46:03] to battle and we know there's a
[46:04] carryover remember Wednesday we looked
[46:06] at the lap over well actually I was two
[46:07] Wednesdays ago we looked at the lap over
[46:09] between the ages and we know there's a
[46:12] lap over so we know they battled the
[46:15] anointing of the Black Horse writer
[46:17] it was the anointing that had the
[46:20] balances member the rider had the
[46:21] balance it is in his hand and he was
[46:23] after money and power and we see that
[46:26] effect still on churches today churches
[46:28] that go after money and go after power
[46:31] more than they go after obedience to the
[46:33] Word of God and so that's this is the
[46:36] context in which John Wesley was
[46:39] preaching the words of life amen
[46:41] now we're preaching in a were in a time
[46:43] where where the the battle we have is
[46:46] the lukewarm spirit and how many win in
[46:48] the battle by God's grace amen on fire
[46:51] fill with the Holy Ghost a passion to
[46:54] know his word praise God a strong desire
[46:56] fervent desire to please him and a
[46:58] strong passion to read the Word of God
[47:00] amen to grow from the Holy Spirit that's
[47:02] someone who's on fire today walk in the
[47:05] spirit not walking in the flesh and so
[47:08] in the first two parts we completed the
[47:10] summary that's the city the age and the
[47:12] messenger we looked at the messenger and
[47:14] his mother again I'm just going to go
[47:15] past that because I just briefly taught
[47:17] about that but one thing I want to say
[47:20] about Susanna Wesley every child to her
[47:22] was a talent from God it wasn't a burden
[47:26] like most families today in America it's
[47:28] a burden to have another child but
[47:29] Susanna Wesley saw each child as a
[47:32] talent which is a valuable piece of
[47:34] money she saw this is a very valuable
[47:36] gift that I've been given I have to make
[47:38] sure I treat this talent with utmost
[47:41] respect amen and what a great example
[47:45] she was to all the mothers we saw that a
[47:47] few Wednesday's ago
[47:48] and so today we'll look at the
[47:50] salutation we're looking at verse 7
[47:52] Jesus's words to the Philadelphia Church
[47:55] age that was battling the synagogue of
[47:57] satan' this age that was battling
[48:00] churches that were kingdom building on
[48:02] earth rather than storing up treasures
[48:04] in heaven mine and so we're told the key
[48:09] to understanding verse 7 is actually in
[48:13] verse 9 s that's why I just felt led to
[48:14] go there that's what we're told the key
[48:16] to understanding verse 7 is so here's
[48:19] verse 7 we already read that together as
[48:21] a congregation and and we're taught
[48:22] these words from our prophet William
[48:24] Aaron Branham he said oh how beautiful
[48:26] are those words how majestic is even the
[48:32] sound of them how thrilling to think
[48:34] that all those attributes can be applied
[48:36] to one person who would dare to such
[48:39] things about or say such things about
[48:41] himself but Jesus Christ the Lord of
[48:43] glory who else would say I'm holy I'm
[48:47] true and I have the key of David who
[48:49] else would say that except the Holy One
[48:51] amen
[48:52] glory he said I believe the key to
[48:56] interpreting exactly what each of these
[48:58] wonderfully descriptive phrases means is
[49:01] found in verse 9 that's why we read 7 8
[49:04] and 9 so you really can't understand
[49:07] chapter I'm sorry chapter 3 verse 7
[49:09] without understanding verse 9 in chapter
[49:12] 3 so let's look at verse 9 again I have
[49:15] it up here for you I know it's kind of
[49:16] small but hopefully you can see it okay
[49:18] behold
[49:18] I'll make them of the synagogue of Satan
[49:21] which say they're Jews and are not but
[49:23] do lie behold I'll make them to come and
[49:28] worship before thy feet and to know that
[49:32] I have loved thee what a statement from
[49:35] the Lord Jesus the Prophet says I say
[49:38] this verse is the key because it deals
[49:39] with the Jews who have always called
[49:43] themselves a children of God to the
[49:46] exclusion of everyone else they
[49:48] crucified and killed the Lord Jesus
[49:49] Christ their terrible deed brought their
[49:53] own blood upon their own heads for
[49:56] centuries all because they refused Jesus
[49:59] as their Messiah which indeed he was to
[50:02] them he was not the coming one or the
[50:04] Son of David to them he was Beelzebub or
[50:06] some unrighteous one only
[50:09] fit for Destruction so to understand how
[50:14] he's holy and he's true we must know
[50:17] that his enemies accuse him of being
[50:20] everything else but that his enemy said
[50:23] he was not holy his enemies said he was
[50:25] a liar
[50:26] but we know that Jesus always told the
[50:29] truth amen but here's where the Jews
[50:33] brought upon themselves the blood curse
[50:35] as it's called you know commonly amongst
[50:39] theologians or just preachers you know
[50:40] we'd say when Pilate saw that he could
[50:43] prevail nothing but rather a tumult was
[50:46] made he took water and washed his hands
[50:48] before the multitude saying I'm innocent
[50:50] of the blood of this just person ce2 it
[50:54] then answered all the people and said
[50:56] his blood be upon us and our children so
[50:59] the Jews said let Jesus's blood be if
[51:00] you don't want it on yours put it on us
[51:03] and anyone that knows history knows that
[51:05] less than 40 years later Jerusalem was
[51:08] destroyed by Titus Israel was encamped
[51:11] around for two years by Titus no one got
[51:15] out and no one got in and they literally
[51:18] starved them to death and overtook the
[51:21] city and that was God's judgment against
[51:24] them because they rejected Christ oh we
[51:28] should receive Christ today with all of
[51:29] our hearts amen there's no reason to
[51:32] refuse him there's no reason to doubt
[51:34] him we must always believe him amen
[51:37] there's responsibility everybody has
[51:40] responsibility to receive Christ today
[51:43] if not his blood may be upon our hands
[51:48] because that's what the scripture tells
[51:50] us now we know even though the history
[51:52] of Pilate I read about him in the
[51:54] lexicon in the history he said he washed
[51:56] it off his hands but he didn't he
[51:59] actually went crazy at them in his life
[52:01] and committed suicide he tried to get
[52:04] exalted to some other positions and
[52:06] eventually lost his life and he never
[52:08] got that blood off his hands because the
[52:10] only way to get it off your hands is to
[52:12] put it on your heart
[52:13] praise God and to fall in love with the
[52:16] blood of Jesus amen the sacrifice of
[52:17] Christ that's the only way to get the
[52:20] blood off your hands is to say Lord fill
[52:22] me with your love
[52:23] amen fill me with the passion to know
[52:26] Christ Jesus amen and remember the Nazi
[52:29] resume carried out the Holocaust for
[52:32] over six million Jews were slain all of
[52:35] this happened because they called Jesus
[52:39] so Beelzebub they said oh he's not our
[52:41] Messiah although they knew he met the
[52:44] scriptures right because that's what
[52:45] Nicodemus said we know your teacher sent
[52:48] from God
[52:49] they knew he was a the word of God they
[52:53] knew he had supernatural power but they
[52:55] crucified Him anyway because he preached
[52:58] against their churches and their
[52:59] denominations I don't know about you but
[53:01] I'm open to any word of God that will
[53:04] convict me or show me I'm wrong
[53:06] I want any Word of God to show me where
[53:08] I'm wrong I just want to be right amen I
[53:11] don't have to come to this church always
[53:13] I don't have to I don't have to be
[53:14] pastor here always but I do always want
[53:17] to love Jesus Christ and believe all the
[53:19] Word of God that he has for me praise
[53:21] God
[53:21] but they were so caught up in their
[53:23] church that they wouldn't accept the
[53:25] word their fresh word for their day and
[53:27] because of that a millions of Jews have
[53:30] been scattered around the world and lost
[53:32] their lives because they didn't
[53:34] appreciate Jesus Christ and respect who
[53:37] he actually was amen hallelujah
[53:41] but not so to the Jews now to us he was
[53:47] indeed Immanuel God manifest in the
[53:49] flesh he is indeed Messiah surely he was
[53:52] exactly as he now sets himself forth to
[53:54] be there he is the same Jesus Jesus
[53:58] Christ the same yesterday and today and
[54:01] forever the Holy One in the midst of the
[54:04] lampstands is the very same Jesus who
[54:06] walked the shores of Galilee who healed
[54:08] the sick who raised the dead and who in
[54:11] spite of irrefutable proof was crucified
[54:14] and killed but he rose again and is
[54:16] seated at the right hand on the Majesty
[54:19] on high glory now in the next portion
[54:23] the Prophet shows why or shows what the
[54:27] Jews thought and what they should have
[54:29] thought so we're going to see the
[54:30] difference between a synagogue of satan'
[54:33] versus true Christianity and these are
[54:35] the examples the Prophet
[54:37] gives in the book so the Prophet says
[54:43] the Christians call Jesus the Holy One
[54:45] but the jews called him Beelzebub but
[54:49] they knew he was God they knew it was
[54:51] God's men the Jews decided to keep the
[54:54] law instead of accepting grace the Jews
[54:59] eventually perished for because of this
[55:01] because of calling Jesus the Beelzebub
[55:04] but the Christians were saved by the
[55:06] grace of God the Jews all their churches
[55:11] all their synagogues became became
[55:13] synagogues of Satan but all the
[55:16] Christian gatherings became gatherings
[55:19] of the Holy Ghost amen
[55:21] they had synagogues of death but the
[55:23] Christian had synagogues of life hey man
[55:26] aren't you glad to be filled with the
[55:27] life of Christ amen
[55:28] how did I'm so good I'm happier about
[55:31] that than anything else I know amen
[55:33] is he filled with the life of Jesus
[55:35] Christ amen since this word indeed
[55:39] expressed perfect realization as against
[55:44] the idea of partial realization now
[55:46] these are some deep terms I don't
[55:48] usually use so bear with me all right
[55:50] this is what the Prophet teaches in the
[55:52] church age book is very deep as
[55:54] illustrated in these verses we can now
[55:56] understand as never before anti-type
[55:59] contrasted with type and substance with
[56:02] shadow so let me just back up a little
[56:05] bit so see the law was a shadow how many
[56:09] know the law was a good thing the Bible
[56:12] said the law was a good thing because it
[56:15] was given by the hands of angels and the
[56:17] Moses praise God
[56:18] it contained promises hallelujah the law
[56:23] was good to those that were good to the
[56:25] law I'll say like that that's right
[56:28] now of course the law was also a school
[56:31] teacher to bring us to Christ amen
[56:35] so the law taught us what God was really
[56:38] like it taught us what was holy and
[56:41] unholy aren't you glad about that
[56:43] amen that God taught us what was wrong
[56:47] and what was right to show us the
[56:49] difference between being
[56:50] out and being pure praise God he showed
[56:54] us the difference but this was all
[56:55] shadow that's why I put it in black
[56:57] there it's all shadow of what was to
[56:59] come in Jesus Christ and so I'll go to
[57:02] the next one I got some new words up
[57:03] there this is a partial realization of
[57:06] God the Jews had a partial realization
[57:08] they actually cooked all the shewbread
[57:10] right that you the priest would cook 12
[57:14] loaves of shewbread and leave it there
[57:16] before the altar of incense and and it
[57:20] would smell good and and fresh and get a
[57:22] New York we all like fresh bread don't
[57:25] we and there's something about our flesh
[57:27] brother bang that just mmm you like
[57:30] fresh bread but that's a partial
[57:34] understanding they were serving God and
[57:37] God allowed them to do that that natural
[57:39] bread for thousands of years but when
[57:41] Jesus came he said I am the bread and
[57:45] I'll say like this there's nothing as
[57:47] fresh there's nothing as satisfying
[57:49] there's nothing that will feel outside
[57:51] of the true bread Jesus Christ amen
[57:54] he's the perfect realization of bread
[57:58] today amen hallelujah if you're hungry
[58:01] today
[58:01] Jesus will fill you hallelujah you can
[58:05] eat natural bread we can go out to eat
[58:07] afterwards and you could brought your
[58:08] Packer lunch and that will fill you up
[58:10] for a little while but that's just a
[58:11] partial reality of what Christ really is
[58:14] when you really feed on Christ you do
[58:17] not hunger after worldly things anymore
[58:19] amen it's impossible because Christ is
[58:23] perfect reality of being fulfilled and
[58:26] satisfied with bread amen if you leave
[58:29] out of here and hear the preaching of
[58:32] the word and you're still not satisfied
[58:33] something's wrong with how you're
[58:35] feeding we should God called us here to
[58:37] come every day and we're to hear and
[58:39] live by every word that proceeds out of
[58:42] the mouth of God amen
[58:44] it's our responsibility as we said to
[58:46] eat the true bread the Word of God
[58:48] hallelujah to feast on the Word of God
[58:51] and let it satisfy your every longing
[58:53] amen but see when people come to our
[58:57] church or any Church and they leave out
[58:59] hungry and their souls
[59:00] something's wrong they're so hungry for
[59:02] the things of the world they
[59:03] eat what God asked them to eat praise
[59:06] God because Christ is perfect bread
[59:11] Christ is perfect fulfillment and
[59:14] satisfaction that's exactly right
[59:18] next is the vine this example brother
[59:21] bran gives in John 15 verse 5 jesus said
[59:23] I am the true vine I mean oh he said
[59:27] that so Christ is the true vine and if
[59:30] he's a true vine brother amen then I'm a
[59:32] true branch hallelujah oh yeah you know
[59:36] you might go to the vine we have an
[59:37] orchard right across of our street and
[59:39] we can I can drive pass and see the
[59:40] grapes hang in there you know at harvest
[59:43] time I think that's a pretty nice that's
[59:45] a natural vine and we thank God for the
[59:47] natural grapes you know in the and the
[59:49] wine you know we haven't communion in
[59:51] different things we thank God for the
[59:52] grape juice and all these all these
[59:54] fruits from the earth but Jesus is
[59:56] saying I'm the true vine I'm the one
[59:59] who's got real life giving resources
[1:00:02] praise God I am your harvest amen i I
[1:00:05] have what you need and in other words
[1:00:07] he's saying I'm the true vine and you'd
[1:00:09] be a true branch hallelujah you let my
[1:00:12] life flow through you and you'll bring
[1:00:15] forth the fruits of the spirit the true
[1:00:17] fruits of the spirit right not a mocking
[1:00:21] or not an impersonation but the true
[1:00:23] fruits of the spear hallelujah let's
[1:00:26] read that real quick while we're there
[1:00:27] let's go to it back to Galatians 5 the
[1:00:30] true fruits of the Spirit if he's the
[1:00:31] true vine and you're the true branch
[1:00:33] then you'll truly produce the true fruit
[1:00:36] of the Spirit amen
[1:00:38] and that is part of the evidence of the
[1:00:40] Holy Ghost it's part of it notice I said
[1:00:43] part because the Evans only ghost is all
[1:00:45] the word living all the Word of God for
[1:00:50] your age so this is part of the word for
[1:00:52] our age so this is part of the evidence
[1:00:55] of the Holy Ghost is having the fruits
[1:00:58] of the spirit now here's the works of
[1:01:06] the
[1:01:06] verse 19 Galatians 5:19 now the works of
[1:01:09] the flesh are manifest which are these
[1:01:10] adultery so people that are married and
[1:01:12] have relations with other people
[1:01:14] adulterers fornication people who are
[1:01:19] not married and have relations
[1:01:21] physically uncleanness which is just
[1:01:24] unbridled life lasciviousness is a
[1:01:27] lawless life there's no rules for me and
[1:01:29] I can do whatever I want I can enjoy all
[1:01:31] my lusts that's lasciviousness idolatry
[1:01:32] is giving anything worship except Christ
[1:01:37] anything you get more worship than
[1:01:39] Christ is an idol witchcraft is course
[1:01:42] spells witchcraft and also the use of
[1:01:44] drugs like we have a lot of that around
[1:01:46] Akron with the what's it called the the
[1:01:48] opiate crisis is that what it's called a
[1:01:50] Scott is that the right word
[1:01:52] Oh p8 okay thank you they had a
[1:01:55] convention on it at our school last week
[1:01:57] I didn't go I think that church that
[1:01:58] night but there's a big crisis in
[1:02:01] Northeast Ohio if only and they knew
[1:02:03] that was witchcraft working behind that
[1:02:04] spirit if only they knew that's
[1:02:08] witchcraft and it takes the Holy Ghost
[1:02:09] to deliver somebody from that it's
[1:02:12] exactly right hatred there should be
[1:02:14] just love in our church we should just
[1:02:16] hate sin praise God variance which I
[1:02:20] didn't look that one up emulations our
[1:02:22] divisions so dividing the church
[1:02:24] dividing families dividing friendships
[1:02:27] wrath anger right strife arguments
[1:02:31] seditions false teachings and heresies
[1:02:35] or even worse additions right there
[1:02:38] heresies that go completely against the
[1:02:40] Word of God envyings when you envy other
[1:02:42] people murdering and that's just killing
[1:02:45] someone's influence right it could be
[1:02:47] physical murder but Jesus said it's
[1:02:49] being upset with someone without a cause
[1:02:53] drunkenness of course drinking
[1:02:55] revellings are part late parties into
[1:02:56] the night and suchlike of the which i
[1:03:00] tell you before as i have also told you
[1:03:02] in time past that they which do these
[1:03:04] things shall not inherit the kingdom of
[1:03:06] God and the church said they will not
[1:03:10] inherit the kingdom of God this is New
[1:03:13] Testament teaching I'll say like this
[1:03:15] this is the law of the Spirit today amen
[1:03:17] we're not under the law stones one of
[1:03:20] the law of the
[1:03:20] spear today and the Holy Spirit says
[1:03:23] these are works of the flesh this is
[1:03:25] someone who's catering to their flesh
[1:03:27] and not serving the Holy Spirit Nelligan
[1:03:31] verse 22 but the fruit of the Spirit is
[1:03:33] love joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[1:03:39] goodness faith meekness temperance
[1:03:44] against such there is no law
[1:03:47] look at verse 24 and they that are
[1:03:50] Christ's have crucified the flesh with
[1:03:51] the affections and lusts so when you're
[1:03:54] really walking in the spirit
[1:03:55] you've crucified the desire to have
[1:03:59] fornication you crucified the desire to
[1:04:01] envy to drink alcohol and a drunken
[1:04:04] state right to have idols in your life
[1:04:07] when you're walking the spirit you've
[1:04:09] crucified lasciviousness now I need
[1:04:11] boundaries in my life I need the word to
[1:04:13] rule my life I need the Holy Spirit's
[1:04:15] role you've crucified those feelings
[1:04:17] amen
[1:04:18] I don't end me this person anymore
[1:04:21] because I've crucified that by the power
[1:04:23] of God amen this is fruit of the Spirit
[1:04:27] this is when you're a part of the True
[1:04:28] Vine this is what flows out of your life
[1:04:31] amen this one flows out of a true branch
[1:04:32] how do you I'm glad to be a true man
[1:04:35] branch hallelujah by the grace of God we
[1:04:39] won't have any real we'll have partial
[1:04:41] realization in a natural vine even next
[1:04:44] week with communion it's partial
[1:04:46] realization but the real communion is in
[1:04:50] our prayer life leading up to that and
[1:04:52] of course it's every day if you don't
[1:04:53] have communion this morning I feel sorry
[1:04:55] for you
[1:04:55] you should had communion this morning
[1:04:57] with Jesus Christ is that right
[1:05:00] exactly right because it's communion all
[1:05:03] the time hallelujah now see there's
[1:05:06] partial forgiveness the sins were
[1:05:08] covered but with Jesus the sins are
[1:05:10] forgotten amen
[1:05:12] there is no record in the mind of God of
[1:05:14] those sins hallelujah that's perfect
[1:05:17] realization of being forgiven he doesn't
[1:05:19] even remember that you did it praise God
[1:05:22] because the word justification means
[1:05:24] declared righteous he declares you
[1:05:26] righteous as though you never did it
[1:05:28] hallelujah and this is what I love too
[1:05:32] under the law the
[1:05:34] Jews had some sin desire their their
[1:05:36] conscience wasn't cleared they still had
[1:05:39] a desire to sin and this is how you know
[1:05:42] you're really born again you have no
[1:05:44] desire to sin you have no desire for the
[1:05:48] things of the world always you have a
[1:05:50] desire for is more of Jesus Christ
[1:05:52] that's the only thing that satisfies
[1:05:54] because he's the true bread you've
[1:05:56] tasted the true bread and you're
[1:05:58] satisfied with that bread hallelujah
[1:06:00] amen the blood of bulls and goats can
[1:06:04] never do away with that sin conscience
[1:06:06] but the blood of Jesus Christ does away
[1:06:08] with it amen you say even if someone you
[1:06:12] were all alone in the room and you know
[1:06:13] nobody was watching you you still
[1:06:14] wouldn't get drunk or you still wouldn't
[1:06:16] have a cigarette absolutely I still
[1:06:18] would not I would still abstain because
[1:06:20] I know God's in that room with me amen
[1:06:22] and I know God's inside of me in this
[1:06:25] room praise God and this room wants to
[1:06:27] praise the Lord hallelujah and serve God
[1:06:30] hallelujah it's exactly right we're
[1:06:34] doing partial realization of of God
[1:06:36] versus a perfect realization of God
[1:06:39] that's what we see when he says I'm true
[1:06:41] I'm holy I have the key of David this is
[1:06:44] what he's saying here he's saying I'm
[1:06:46] I'm giving you a perfect reality of God
[1:06:49] and man today aren't you glad for that
[1:06:52] hey man I'm happy but as I said I'm
[1:06:54] happy about that anything else I know
[1:06:55] Amen that you and I can have a perfect
[1:06:58] realization of a relationship with Jesus
[1:07:01] Christ there's three more he gives and I
[1:07:05] may have missed one but I do believe
[1:07:07] there's three more Moses was a partial
[1:07:10] realization of a law giver right he
[1:07:12] brought the law down but Jesus was the
[1:07:15] perfect example of a lawgiver hallelujah
[1:07:20] Jesus's laws all the words he preached
[1:07:24] praise God and remember you know some
[1:07:27] people get hung up on this go to Acts
[1:07:29] chapter one
[1:07:29] some people get hung up on all there's
[1:07:31] no more Commandments now we're not under
[1:07:33] the law
[1:07:33] we're under grace and they get all
[1:07:35] confused because they don't study long
[1:07:37] enough they don't pray long enough
[1:07:39] that's the reason why there's false
[1:07:41] doctrine not waiting upon the Lord and
[1:07:43] not studying enough because he said
[1:07:47] you seek me with all your heart you will
[1:07:49] find me and Isaiah said call upon me
[1:07:53] while you're while I'm 9 Wow while you
[1:07:55] can while there's time to call upon the
[1:07:57] Lord and we all have time to call upon
[1:07:59] Jesus it's just just our choice what are
[1:08:02] we gonna do with our time are we gonna
[1:08:03] call on Jesus in our free time are we
[1:08:05] gonna call on the things of the world
[1:08:07] I say let's call on the holy name of
[1:08:08] Jesus it's our choice we're the one who
[1:08:13] makes that decision Acts chapter 1 verse
[1:08:17] 1 the former treatise have I made oath
[1:08:21] Theophilus of all that Jesus began to do
[1:08:24] and teach until the day in which he was
[1:08:28] taken up now look at the next part this
[1:08:30] is the Prophet emphasized this in the
[1:08:32] message token in 1963 says this after
[1:08:36] that he through the Holy Ghost had given
[1:08:40] Commandments unto the Apostles whom he
[1:08:43] had chosen so does the New Testament
[1:08:45] still give Commandments Church
[1:08:47] absolutely Jesus taught and and and
[1:08:50] taught the Word of God while he was on
[1:08:53] earth but after he left he said I'm
[1:08:54] gonna fill my Apostles with the Holy
[1:08:56] Ghost that's in me and now they're gonna
[1:08:58] give out Commandments to my people amen
[1:09:00] the trouble is today most people don't
[1:09:02] want to be commanded by the Word of God
[1:09:03] they think they can figure out salvation
[1:09:06] I'm sorry
[1:09:06] God has a government you must go through
[1:09:08] the government of the leadership that
[1:09:10] God has on the earth today it's through
[1:09:12] the commandments through the fivefold
[1:09:13] ministry which only preaches the Word of
[1:09:15] God and it perfects the people of God
[1:09:18] and brings them in line with the Holy
[1:09:19] Spirit today that's how the Holy Spirit
[1:09:21] speaking today through God's five gifts
[1:09:23] that he gave the preachers Amen that's
[1:09:26] right that's the only way he gave it
[1:09:28] today he still has Commandments today
[1:09:30] but the commandments are through his
[1:09:32] holy apostles and his ministry the
[1:09:34] government of the church amen that's
[1:09:37] what I was doing AB obviously with
[1:09:38] Benjamin this week and I showed him I
[1:09:40] show how there's two governments there's
[1:09:41] a government of the the natural
[1:09:42] government the United States government
[1:09:44] we have to honor and pray for them don't
[1:09:46] we yes we do we pray for him here we
[1:09:49] pray for Donald Trump here
[1:09:51] I don't grieve this lifestyle enough on
[1:09:54] that really don't agree with his
[1:09:56] lifestyle but or more most people in the
[1:09:59] government most
[1:10:00] the government don't live right because
[1:10:03] they're bought with money but then
[1:10:06] there's the spiritual government and the
[1:10:08] spiritual government is v preaching
[1:10:10] gifts to govern the body of Jesus Christ
[1:10:12] and it's through those five gifts that
[1:10:15] God will bring unity to the people unity
[1:10:19] to the faith don't you feel like that
[1:10:20] when we have brother cam or brother
[1:10:21] Brooks or brother Craig come in here by
[1:10:23] the Samuel when you preach our
[1:10:24] dedication meetings you know back in
[1:10:25] June don't you love that when the Holy
[1:10:27] Spirit comes in here and you have you
[1:10:29] here another gift of the fivefold
[1:10:30] ministry preaching the very thing that
[1:10:32] we preach does that make you feel good
[1:10:35] it shows that we're all being governed
[1:10:37] by this one Holy Spirit Laurie
[1:10:39] amen we're all one accord the Holy
[1:10:43] Spirit can have different men all around
[1:10:44] but the Holy Spirit's all bringing us to
[1:10:46] the same spot he's bringing us to be a
[1:10:48] church that's without spot without
[1:10:50] wrinkle and without blemish amen
[1:10:53] a church that's washed in the waters of
[1:10:56] Christ home where they men yes so Jesus
[1:11:00] is the lawgiver now look here's how he
[1:11:02] gives laws through his apostles there is
[1:11:05] fivefold ministry gives Commandments but
[1:11:07] like I said mostly what I don't want to
[1:11:09] be commanded do anything they just want
[1:11:10] to option well you can do this or not
[1:11:11] but the Bible said we're commanded to
[1:11:13] keep the Word of God they don't want
[1:11:17] commands they just want suggestions they
[1:11:19] want options well God's Word is his only
[1:11:21] option there's only one provide a place
[1:11:24] of worship and the church said there's
[1:11:26] only that's in Jesus Christ that's in
[1:11:28] the Holy Ghost the word of the hour
[1:11:30] now David was the partial realization of
[1:11:33] a king he was a mighty king subdued all
[1:11:36] the enemies he actually fulfilled you
[1:11:37] know Joshua's Commission on the borders
[1:11:40] that Israel would fulfill member we
[1:11:42] preached on that not long ago David
[1:11:44] fulfilled that some 700 800 years after
[1:11:47] Joshua took the promised land he finally
[1:11:49] reached the borders that that God had
[1:11:52] promised to Joshua but Jesus is the
[1:11:56] perfect realization of a king for he is
[1:11:59] king of kings and Lord of lords amen
[1:12:02] so it's partial verses a perfect
[1:12:06] realization and as we said again the
[1:12:09] partial realization for the Jews was
[1:12:11] they just had synagogues for the
[1:12:14] so they just had church membership but
[1:12:16] with the church they have more than
[1:12:18] church membership they have God
[1:12:19] membership glory God's inside of them
[1:12:22] amen
[1:12:23] God's walking in them God's talking to
[1:12:26] them God's living in them God is giving
[1:12:28] in them God is serving in them it's God
[1:12:30] in them it's Christ in them the hope of
[1:12:32] glory amen that's the perfect
[1:12:34] realization of what Jesus is doing today
[1:12:37] it's exactly right
[1:12:40] now let's get back to these Jews here
[1:12:42] because he said you can't understand
[1:12:43] verse seven without understanding verse
[1:12:45] nine but the Jews back there the time of
[1:12:49] Jesus did not want to accept that
[1:12:51] sacrifice a lot of people they won't
[1:12:53] accept the Holy Ghost baptism right
[1:12:56] they don't want to they don't want to
[1:12:58] ball and and cry and boohoo they don't
[1:13:01] want to lay at the altar - they're
[1:13:02] filled with power they don't want to be
[1:13:03] embarrassed I'd rather be embarrassed
[1:13:05] over here and then be embarrassed at the
[1:13:06] white throne judgment and really it's
[1:13:09] not an embarrassment to love the Lord
[1:13:10] it's a it's a joy to love the Lord it's
[1:13:13] a joy to have the Holy Ghost on you it's
[1:13:15] a joy to have your cup running over
[1:13:17] glory it's a joy and who cares what the
[1:13:20] world thinks they're lost
[1:13:21] I care what God thinks amen it's a joy
[1:13:24] to have your spirit overflowing with
[1:13:26] worship and praise and giving God glory
[1:13:28] it's a joy to have that we're so
[1:13:30] thankful for the Holy Ghost amen today
[1:13:32] hallelujah the blood of bulls and goats
[1:13:38] made nothing perfect
[1:13:39] it was once God's ordained method but
[1:13:41] now Christ having appeared in the flesh
[1:13:43] and by the shedding of his own blood has
[1:13:45] put away sin and by that offering of
[1:13:48] himself has made us perfect the Jews
[1:13:53] would not take that I will not take your
[1:13:58] preaching I will not believe that Jesus
[1:14:00] Christ makes me whole I know about you
[1:14:03] but I believe it with all my heart
[1:14:05] I will take that on every day seven days
[1:14:08] a week and twice on Sunday glory
[1:14:11] I'll take Jesus Christ every day to wash
[1:14:13] away my sins to make me perfect but what
[1:14:16] about the Philadelphian age and yes the
[1:14:18] other ages - did they really accept this
[1:14:20] reality in Christ no sir now remember
[1:14:22] the stars did the stars accepted it
[1:14:25] Wesley and Luther and Columba marked in
[1:14:27] and
[1:14:28] all these the stars were shining bright
[1:14:30] with the light of Christ amen and no
[1:14:33] doubt there were some believers but he's
[1:14:34] making reference to the majority of
[1:14:36] people in the age the majority of the
[1:14:38] people won't accept it right today the
[1:14:41] majority of the people won't be
[1:14:42] born-again the Holy Ghost but some
[1:14:44] people will praise God some people will
[1:14:46] be born again some people will have the
[1:14:48] life of Christ
[1:14:49] some people will know that for to me to
[1:14:52] live is Christ and to die
[1:14:53] it is my gain some people will know that
[1:14:56] today some people will know that I
[1:14:58] fought a good fight
[1:14:59] I've ran the course and there's a crown
[1:15:02] of righteousness that's waiting for me
[1:15:04] praise God I'm not guessing if there's a
[1:15:06] crowd I know there's a crown amen
[1:15:08] because I fought the good fight of the
[1:15:10] one faith of Christianity the Holy Ghost
[1:15:13] baptism amen that's right and Paul said
[1:15:16] I knew even though he blasts him long
[1:15:18] ago he knew who God forgave me and I've
[1:15:20] know God forgave me that blast that
[1:15:22] blaspheming and I know I've got a crown
[1:15:24] of righteousness waiting for me amen
[1:15:26] and not only me but all those hallelujah
[1:15:29] all those that love is appearing
[1:15:31] hallelujah thank you Jesus no sir they
[1:15:36] didn't really accept it even though
[1:15:38] Luther brought the truth of
[1:15:39] justification the Romish church and its
[1:15:42] eastern counterpart the orthodox church
[1:15:44] still clung to works now look at this
[1:15:48] paragraph I read this when I preached on
[1:15:50] justification a few months ago and I
[1:15:52] just put a little thing on Facebook
[1:15:54] about that that just totally refreshed
[1:15:56] me when I preached the just shall live
[1:15:57] by faith
[1:15:58] I felt so clean and fresh afterwards I
[1:16:01] think you're gonna feel that way to try
[1:16:02] to receive at church kunti let me let me
[1:16:04] let me persuade you try to receive this
[1:16:06] right now try to receive this now works
[1:16:11] are fine but they don't save you they
[1:16:14] don't make you perfect it is Christ or
[1:16:16] parish and it's not even Christ and
[1:16:19] works it is Christ alone this age began
[1:16:23] the years of our minyan ISM that does
[1:16:25] not believe in Christ as the reality it
[1:16:28] does not sing him nothing but the blood
[1:16:29] for sings nothing but the blood and my
[1:16:31] own conduct mercy now I believe in good
[1:16:35] conduct if you're saved you will do
[1:16:37] righteously see we got people baptize
[1:16:39] and say they're saved and they're not
[1:16:41] even living a right
[1:16:41] life which proves they're probably not
[1:16:43] even saved because if you're saved you
[1:16:46] will be virgin to the word your works
[1:16:48] will be pure before God because you have
[1:16:51] wise virgin and foolish virgin both are
[1:16:54] making no intercourse with the world the
[1:16:57] church said okay what church you go to
[1:17:00] no matter what church you go to if you
[1:17:02] say you're saved and not living
[1:17:03] righteously doing the right thing living
[1:17:05] the right way you're probably not save
[1:17:07] you're probably deceived in your
[1:17:08] experience with God the thing to do is
[1:17:10] repent lay at the altar open your Bible
[1:17:13] ask God to forgive you and hear the word
[1:17:15] of God amen don't follow the voice of
[1:17:18] strangers follow the voice of the word
[1:17:19] amen until your life is right you do
[1:17:23] everything right by the word that's the
[1:17:25] kind of person that's saved that's the
[1:17:26] kind of person who's righteous before
[1:17:28] God absolutely right no bad deals no
[1:17:32] speaking behind people's back no steal
[1:17:34] and no murder and no lusting after
[1:17:37] things but just somebody who lives a
[1:17:39] righteous life before God God's seeking
[1:17:42] those people look at that tonight that's
[1:17:44] who guys looking for God's going around
[1:17:46] the church I wonder is the people ro1
[1:17:49] gonna seek me today are the people in
[1:17:52] row 2 gonna seek me today I'm seeking
[1:17:54] for a true worshiper where somebody that
[1:17:57] loves me but you know he'll always find
[1:18:00] him because he seeks and saves that
[1:18:01] reaches the house he knows all those
[1:18:03] that are called he goes down to the Row
[1:18:05] 3 Row 4 Row 5 he comes up to the pulpit
[1:18:08] amen he comes everywhere looking where
[1:18:12] is somebody that really wants to worship
[1:18:14] me in truth before we close we look at
[1:18:18] the definition of worship and I want to
[1:18:20] ask you then are you a worshipper today
[1:18:23] wonder when was last time have we looked
[1:18:25] at the word worship for a while are you
[1:18:27] a worshiper we're gonna find out if your
[1:18:28] worshiper and I'm gonna find out if I'm
[1:18:31] a worshiper to you by God's grace look
[1:18:33] at this we have already gone over that
[1:18:35] but let me tell you now salvation is not
[1:18:38] Jesus plus me
[1:18:40] it is Jesus alone salvation is of the
[1:18:46] Lord from start to finish it is all God
[1:18:50] let his leghe's let his life be him he
[1:18:53] starts naming all these spirit writers
[1:18:54] let his lie
[1:18:55] be in me let his blood be what cleanses
[1:18:59] me see it's all about him his life his
[1:19:02] blood let it be his spirit that fills me
[1:19:05] let it be his word in my heart and mouth
[1:19:07] let it be his stripes that heal me let
[1:19:09] it be Jesus and Jesus alone not by works
[1:19:12] of righteousness err Christ is my life
[1:19:15] amen what do you get excited about in
[1:19:19] your life right now that'll show you if
[1:19:20] you're right with God or not right
[1:19:23] because it's it's him if his words not
[1:19:26] in your life then you're really not
[1:19:27] living as you should praise God it has
[1:19:30] to be his word in your mouth praise God
[1:19:33] ask me his life in you you're his word
[1:19:37] has to be in your mouth to really speak
[1:19:39] and to really really talk we're really
[1:19:41] not talking left unless we're talking
[1:19:43] about the Word of God praise the Lord
[1:19:45] we do a lot of talking a lot of texting
[1:19:46] we dog there's a lot of face time and
[1:19:48] everything like that
[1:19:49] we do a lot of talking but we're really
[1:19:51] not talking if Jesus Christ loving him
[1:19:54] is at the center of our conversation
[1:19:57] it's true it's true it's not Jesus plus
[1:20:01] it is Jesus Jesus did all this for me
[1:20:04] it's all about Jesus and and Jesus said
[1:20:07] the Holy Ghost will speak of me amen
[1:20:09] it'll bring all things I've said to your
[1:20:11] remembrance amen glory now let me close
[1:20:15] to this yeah I got about give me a few
[1:20:17] minutes here now my closing is gonna
[1:20:20] member tell you how long my closing is
[1:20:21] gonna be here 25 minute closing ok so
[1:20:25] give me 25 minutes to close I'll set a
[1:20:27] timer here so I don't go over I got to
[1:20:30] save some strength for the evening
[1:20:32] praise the Lord I want to close with
[1:20:36] this thought because the Prophet said
[1:20:38] you can't understand verse 7 without
[1:20:40] understanding verse 9 now actually I'm
[1:20:45] already to this part okay I'm already at
[1:20:47] this part what is worship what is
[1:20:51] worship
[1:20:53] I'm said you can't worship in the church
[1:20:54] and pass notes and snicker and play
[1:20:57] around as he said he said actually
[1:20:59] helping people not worship God when
[1:21:02] you're distracting them in the
[1:21:03] congregation here's the Webster's
[1:21:09] definition and we'll look at the Greek
[1:21:10] definition now I'm gonna go down here
[1:21:14] first I kind of got him out of order
[1:21:16] sorry but worship is look at this
[1:21:18] extravagant respect now let's be honest
[1:21:23] be honest with yourself
[1:21:24] are you offering extravagant respect to
[1:21:28] God today not just respect but
[1:21:33] extravagant respect worship is
[1:21:36] extravagant respect or admiration for or
[1:21:41] devotion to an object of esteem admire
[1:21:48] that's why I said what do you admire
[1:21:49] right now if I could look on your phone
[1:21:51] and I could go through your history of
[1:21:52] what you looked at yesterday
[1:21:54] what were you admiring the latest Amazon
[1:21:56] deal it's good to get a deal but what do
[1:22:01] you admire what are you lavishing all
[1:22:04] the praise on what what are you so
[1:22:06] excited and and so emotional about that
[1:22:10] people know that person really likes the
[1:22:12] book guys who that person really likes
[1:22:16] the Detroit Lions what do people notice
[1:22:22] about you they say oh they they have
[1:22:25] extravagant respect for this
[1:22:28] that's worship and then the second
[1:22:32] definition closely related reverence
[1:22:34] offered a divine being or supernatural
[1:22:37] power now another one calls it the the
[1:22:42] Greek called it homage program called it
[1:22:45] home egde I shared with my wife one time
[1:22:48] he called it home it is definite I love
[1:22:51] how he pronounces words homage an
[1:22:53] expression of high regard or respectful
[1:22:56] what is respect its esteem so highly
[1:22:59] valuing something I think our lives
[1:23:05] chuh Church I think our lives show what
[1:23:06] we value I think our decisions we make
[1:23:09] every day really shows what we value do
[1:23:14] you believe that respect is giving
[1:23:18] something a high value all youth at work
[1:23:23] that got a boss how many you respect
[1:23:24] your boss do you value his opinion or
[1:23:27] her do you value their opinion is it
[1:23:30] valuable when you get the email from
[1:23:32] your boss or email from mom or whoever
[1:23:34] you value most yeah does it does it mean
[1:23:37] I mean you get on that email right away
[1:23:39] or you brush it off and sass some other
[1:23:41] time I don't value that this is worship
[1:23:46] respect we're talking about worshiping
[1:23:50] Jesus Christ those that worship Jesus
[1:23:54] Christ of the Philadelphia church age
[1:23:56] those that receive the key of David
[1:24:00] glory amen
[1:24:01] those that went through the open door
[1:24:03] that Jesus opened for them and did not
[1:24:07] deny the name of Jesus Christ they would
[1:24:10] stand with Jesus Christ and the ones who
[1:24:13] lied about it would come and worship
[1:24:15] before their feet it's quite a thought
[1:24:19] isn't it now here look what look what
[1:24:26] the Greek is for worship now this is the
[1:24:28] the worship is 70 times in the in the
[1:24:30] New Testament and I think 60 of them
[1:24:32] have this definition some of them are
[1:24:34] just broad worship you know just all the
[1:24:36] acts of worship but here's what worship
[1:24:38] actually means now it's Prosecco new Oh
[1:24:42] prosecute Anejo or somebody prosecute
[1:24:45] nay o cross proskuneo are you frost
[1:24:47] kunia and it gets its meaning from two
[1:24:51] words it means to kiss like a dog
[1:24:54] licking his master's hand oh my got a
[1:24:57] dog at home a couple okay two or three
[1:25:00] how many people have dogs huh yeah just
[1:25:04] a couple that's all right I don't like
[1:25:06] how they shed so much and I don't like
[1:25:08] how they stink so we don't have a dog at
[1:25:10] our house now if you got a dog that
[1:25:12] doesn't shed her stink now you're you're
[1:25:13] in business right there but that's just
[1:25:16] my opinion
[1:25:17] [Music]
[1:25:18] but the actual word worshipping God and
[1:25:20] this is the one where the Bible said
[1:25:23] that four and twenty elders fell down
[1:25:24] and worship before God this is the
[1:25:27] actual this is the one that's used the
[1:25:30] most the actual worshiper of Jesus
[1:25:34] Christ is one who's like a dog before
[1:25:37] its master they're like a dog before its
[1:25:42] master let's just let that sink in for a
[1:25:44] little bit recently I've gone to
[1:25:46] people's houses I forget who it was and
[1:25:48] the dogs really liked me can you imagine
[1:25:51] that dogs like me but I forget where it
[1:25:55] was but as soon as I got there they come
[1:25:57] running up I'm trying to think who was
[1:25:58] there wagging their tail they just and
[1:26:01] they lay down on their side and like
[1:26:02] come on rub me down yeah I spend some
[1:26:05] time with me I can't remember who it was
[1:26:08] but some dogs really fell in love with
[1:26:10] me recently I can't remember where it
[1:26:11] was but that's the kind of action that
[1:26:15] Jesus wants you and I to show not tongue
[1:26:21] wagging now you might speak in tongues I
[1:26:23] like that you might speak with tongues
[1:26:26] hallelujah but this is the worship I
[1:26:32] want to what you'd examine yourself we
[1:26:34] have communion next week are you
[1:26:35] worshippers are you worshipper do you
[1:26:40] give extravagant worship
[1:26:42] do you give extravagant adoration to
[1:26:45] Christ that's between you and God I
[1:26:47] don't know some of your faces tell a
[1:26:49] certain story all of our faces tell
[1:26:53] story but we want it to be in sincerity
[1:26:56] and truth I just want to spend a little
[1:27:00] bit of time on that I still got about 23
[1:27:02] minutes it means to kiss the hand
[1:27:05] towards one in token of reverence you've
[1:27:10] all seen the pictures how they kiss the
[1:27:12] Pope's had raised your have you seen a
[1:27:13] picture of them kissing the Pope's in
[1:27:14] I've seen that they just run up and kiss
[1:27:18] his hand they do that to the the kings
[1:27:20] and princes in England or not they that
[1:27:23] to the King of England I don't know I
[1:27:24] haven't seen any pictures like that
[1:27:26] that's the closest that's the closest
[1:27:29] you and I could get to understanding
[1:27:30] that
[1:27:32] the Pope they kissed his hand which we
[1:27:33] believe the Pope is wrong you know we
[1:27:35] respect him but we believe he's totally
[1:27:37] wrong in his doctrine we shouldn't pray
[1:27:40] to Mary
[1:27:41] we shouldn't pray to dead people right
[1:27:44] we shouldn't do those things and we know
[1:27:48] his church is the mother harlot in
[1:27:49] revelation 17 because Rome sits on seven
[1:27:52] hills we know that but see this is what
[1:27:56] worship is it's to kiss the hand in
[1:27:58] token of reverence now those you who
[1:28:02] aren't married you can't understand this
[1:28:03] yet but after I got married with my wife
[1:28:05] I kiss her hand right or anyone that's
[1:28:09] married you kiss your loved one let me
[1:28:11] know what we're talking about by God's
[1:28:12] grace that's an act that's one way to
[1:28:15] understand where this word comes from
[1:28:17] worship means to kiss it means to touch
[1:28:22] and I wonder are we touching the heart
[1:28:24] of God this morning with our worship
[1:28:26] because we should if we're not we're not
[1:28:28] worshiping in spirit and truth we've
[1:28:30] actually gone into vain worship which
[1:28:32] we'll look at tonight in the Bible study
[1:28:33] because he said you can he said oh this
[1:28:36] is the fate of the powerful scripture
[1:28:38] from Matthew 15 in vain do they worship
[1:28:42] me they honor me with their lips but
[1:28:44] their heart is far from me what is your
[1:28:48] heart really giving extravagant praise
[1:28:50] to people come to church they sing god
[1:28:55] bless america you know they they sing
[1:28:57] hallelujah you know all hail King Jesus
[1:28:59] but is there heart in it because worship
[1:29:03] involves more than just words or else
[1:29:05] the Pharisees had worship down to the
[1:29:07] tee
[1:29:09] Christ has to be our number one object
[1:29:13] of adoration I adore Jesus Christ more
[1:29:17] than I adore lust finances right jobs
[1:29:22] families relatives Christ has to be our
[1:29:27] number one adoration and it's liking
[1:29:33] that how you would kiss your spouse or
[1:29:35] how you'd kiss maybe the baby when the
[1:29:38] firstborn I'm gonna pretty good at that
[1:29:40] by the way by God's grace
[1:29:43] hence among the Orientals especially the
[1:29:46] Persians they showed worship by falling
[1:29:49] down on their knees and touching the
[1:29:51] ground with their forehead which the
[1:29:53] Muslims still do today as an expression
[1:29:57] of profound reverence in the New
[1:30:01] Testament by kneeling or prostrating to
[1:30:03] do homage or make obeisance whether in
[1:30:07] order to express respect or to make
[1:30:10] supplication are we worshiping today are
[1:30:16] you did you worship during the worship
[1:30:18] service did you worship and adore
[1:30:23] did you give extravagant praise to
[1:30:26] Christ did you highly value the songs
[1:30:30] that we sing or is it like how could
[1:30:33] brother Jesse and Malachi play that song
[1:30:35] again that's the only ones we know right
[1:30:36] now we'll keep practicing right now okay
[1:30:42] Malik I had a dream years ago and he
[1:30:44] said he went from the congregation to
[1:30:46] the piano to the pulpit now I don't know
[1:30:49] about you but I just believe that some I
[1:30:51] believe that's the prophesy myself and
[1:30:53] so we're seeing I'm seeing it fulfilled
[1:30:55] right now this was when he's 3-4 years
[1:30:56] old he drew a picture of him brought it
[1:30:58] to me and so I'm seeing him move from
[1:31:00] the congregation to the piano just makes
[1:31:04] my heart happy because God said I'll
[1:31:06] speak to the men and women through
[1:31:08] dreams and visions the young men in
[1:31:11] dreams praise God so this is worship now
[1:31:17] there's a couple other definitions of
[1:31:18] worship homage shown disappear men these
[1:31:20] are ones were common familiar with
[1:31:22] homage rendered to God and to the
[1:31:24] Ascended Christ and heavenly beings two
[1:31:26] demons are we worshiping you know Jesus
[1:31:34] is patient but if we won't worship him
[1:31:36] at some point he starts to get angry
[1:31:38] with us let's go to the Book of Psalms
[1:31:40] you got your Bible it's got a book of
[1:31:42] Psalms Psalms chapter 2 verse 11 God
[1:31:47] will be merciful merciful merciful for
[1:31:50] years sometimes decades but at some
[1:31:52] point if we don't give over to him he
[1:31:54] gets angry that we won't give him
[1:31:56] extravagant praise
[1:31:57] you know why because he's got to the
[1:31:59] universe he gave you your life your
[1:32:02] breath your being he provides all the
[1:32:04] food shelter clothing he provides he
[1:32:06] sends rain upon the just and the unjust
[1:32:08] and he's worthy of your praise now in
[1:32:11] that but all the natural things he took
[1:32:13] away all the spiritual wrath against you
[1:32:14] on the cross by the blood of Jesus
[1:32:17] Christ and if we won't give him
[1:32:20] extravagant praise then he gets upset
[1:32:25] Psalms 2:11 serve the Lord with fear
[1:32:30] with respect see that respect there it
[1:32:33] is and rejoice with trembling kiss the
[1:32:38] son lest he be angry and ye perish from
[1:32:43] the way when r at his wrath is kindled
[1:32:46] but a little blessed are all they that
[1:32:48] put their trust in him Jesus tired of
[1:32:51] people some people given praise to
[1:32:52] sporting events he gets tired of that he
[1:32:56] gets tired of people praising their
[1:32:57] children more than praising God or
[1:33:01] praising money or how much money or
[1:33:04] their occupation or whatever they get
[1:33:07] tired of you got he gets tired of people
[1:33:08] just praising that and and giving all
[1:33:10] their extravagant emotion and energy
[1:33:13] that rather than worshiping him he gets
[1:33:16] tired and he said kiss the son see show
[1:33:19] that kiss shown that tender touch that
[1:33:22] extravagant worship show him that lest
[1:33:25] he be angry
[1:33:25] how many glad you can kiss the son today
[1:33:27] hey man I'm glad hallelujah glory but
[1:33:32] see some people don't come to church
[1:33:34] like that
[1:33:34] oh I could never do that like but that's
[1:33:36] what worship is follow them around long
[1:33:38] enough I would just imagine for one hour
[1:33:40] you can follow them around for one hour
[1:33:42] and you're gonna find them giving some
[1:33:43] worship to something and they're just
[1:33:46] choosing not to give it to Jesus Christ
[1:33:48] most people's as soon as they get out
[1:33:50] and get on their phones you start seeing
[1:33:51] seen what they want to extravagantly
[1:33:52] worship how many understand that there
[1:33:56] was what their it's what they're giving
[1:33:57] all their love to all their praise all
[1:34:00] their attention extravagant praise
[1:34:02] that's their God that's their idol but
[1:34:06] the Bible said kiss the son kiss Jesus
[1:34:09] touching Jesus is
[1:34:11] all that really matters it and your life
[1:34:13] will never be the same
[1:34:14] amen it's exactly right well Bram said
[1:34:21] we come to church to express our love to
[1:34:24] Jesus Christ let me out maybe I can
[1:34:31] share this the right way there's
[1:34:36] something about coming to church and
[1:34:39] worshiping God there's something that's
[1:34:42] so important about that and how you act
[1:34:46] right here don't get me wrong what you
[1:34:48] really are is what you are at home are
[1:34:52] you showing extravagant worship at home
[1:34:54] that's really what what it boils down to
[1:34:57] that's real worship because people can
[1:35:00] pretend here well there's something
[1:35:03] about when we are gathered together
[1:35:06] there should be so much worship and
[1:35:08] praise there should be such a unity when
[1:35:10] we're gathered together that people who
[1:35:12] visit our visitors this morning should
[1:35:15] know they love Jesus Christ
[1:35:18] they're extravagantly worshiping Jesus
[1:35:21] Christ this is our time to come together
[1:35:23] and foreshadow what we're going to be
[1:35:27] doing for all eternity and if you don't
[1:35:30] like putting extravagant praise on Jesus
[1:35:32] here you're probably not gonna like
[1:35:33] heaven and you're gonna have a very
[1:35:34] small chance to even get into heaven are
[1:35:37] you with me
[1:35:38] you don't like worshipping here with
[1:35:40] God's people that will you live with
[1:35:42] eternity something wrong with your
[1:35:44] worship it's vain worship God is looking
[1:35:48] for someone to show him true extravagant
[1:35:51] love extravagant worship Oh My glory
[1:35:55] kiss him lest he be angry because he's
[1:35:59] done everything for you he deserves the
[1:36:03] honor he deserves the praise he washed
[1:36:07] away your sins with his blood and all
[1:36:12] the Knick WA T's of us all were placed
[1:36:14] upon Christ and with His stripes I am
[1:36:16] healed amen glory my life is healed my
[1:36:21] destiny is healed amen hallelujah my
[1:36:23] eternal
[1:36:25] is settled because I'm healed through
[1:36:26] the stripes of Jesus Christ amen
[1:36:28] so I'll kiss him today amen I'll kiss
[1:36:32] him every day we'll kiss the Sun and
[1:36:34] we'll make him happy praise God amen we
[1:36:39] come here to do that and so we're coming
[1:36:41] here and and that's why we get worried
[1:36:43] if people are you know not enjoying the
[1:36:45] worship or they don't look like they're
[1:36:46] expressing extravagant praise that's why
[1:36:48] preachers have to preach on that now
[1:36:50] you're coming here saying you're
[1:36:51] worshiping but not expressing
[1:36:53] extravagant praise upon him something's
[1:36:56] wrong with that
[1:36:57] something's wrong with that or coming to
[1:37:00] church and worshipping isn't as
[1:37:02] important as other things it's not as
[1:37:04] valuable as other things that people
[1:37:05] placed before the house of God it's not
[1:37:08] as valuable it's not as steamed as
[1:37:10] highly the values been placed on well I
[1:37:12] ask you again what are you worshiping
[1:37:14] are you worshiping we must worship in
[1:37:18] spirit and in truth hallelujah because
[1:37:20] God is actively he's wants somebody to
[1:37:22] love him but amen he wants somebody to
[1:37:24] love him he wants somebody to kiss him
[1:37:26] this morning somebody to kiss him and
[1:37:28] say I love you Jesus you're you're
[1:37:30] you're beautiful you're you're wonderful
[1:37:32] you're marvelous oh just like pour all
[1:37:34] my praises upon you amen that's what
[1:37:38] he's looking looking for somebody to
[1:37:39] worship him like a dog licks his
[1:37:43] master's hand now we are not to be
[1:37:49] worships as we closed out of the service
[1:37:50] I got I got 12 more minutes we're not
[1:37:54] we're not the ones being worship in this
[1:37:56] scripture Jesus says I'm gonna have all
[1:37:58] those synagogues of Satan that were
[1:38:00] lying and said they were true churches
[1:38:02] come stand before you and make them
[1:38:04] worship at your feet but you and I are
[1:38:07] not the ones being worshiped are we
[1:38:15] sharing in the glory yes but are we
[1:38:19] being worshipped absolutely not
[1:38:22] because the Bible says I am the Lord
[1:38:25] this is my name and my glory will I not
[1:38:28] give to another neither my praise to
[1:38:30] graven images now don't some of the word
[1:38:34] glory because look down and we'll get to
[1:38:36] this one right here first
[1:38:38] first cut this one 29 that no flesh
[1:38:40] should glory in his presence that so if
[1:38:45] I'm standing by Jesus I won't be saying
[1:38:47] oh praise me praise me it would be like
[1:38:48] I'm standing with him praise him praise
[1:38:50] Him praise Him praise Him praise him or
[1:38:53] in this case praise him praise Him
[1:38:55] praise him because look at John 17 there
[1:38:59] is a portion of glory that we share and
[1:39:01] that portion of glory is the Holy Ghost
[1:39:04] because he said in the glory which thou
[1:39:06] gavest me I have given them see we
[1:39:09] receive glory we received a part of God
[1:39:12] amen
[1:39:13] that they may be one even as we are one
[1:39:16] I am them thou and me that they may be
[1:39:18] made perfect in one and that the world
[1:39:20] may know that thou sent me has loved
[1:39:24] them as thou hast loved me amen glory
[1:39:27] remember this is the mystery which was
[1:39:29] hid from all ages Christ in you the hope
[1:39:32] of glory amen
[1:39:35] those lying churches and say oh we're
[1:39:38] Jews or we're the true believers or
[1:39:39] we're the true message believers when
[1:39:41] they are brought before the true
[1:39:43] believer they bow down and worship but
[1:39:47] they have to worship Christ they're not
[1:39:49] worshiping us they're worshiping Christ
[1:39:54] there are five Bible examples I found a
[1:39:57] worshiping before thy feet so I'm gonna
[1:39:59] finish with this I thought that was so
[1:40:06] striking the first example is Joseph's
[1:40:09] brethren I remember that story Joseph
[1:40:15] had a dream as a young boy I saw I saw
[1:40:16] 12 stars bowing down and worshiping me
[1:40:21] now the reason Joseph could be worship
[1:40:23] was cuz he was a type of Christ right
[1:40:26] but it wasn't like God worship it was
[1:40:27] just reverence and obeisance but he said
[1:40:31] I saw twelve stars falling down and
[1:40:34] worshiping me and so we know what
[1:40:38] happened he got sodas brothers didn't
[1:40:40] like his spiritual gifts so they sold
[1:40:41] him out to to Egypt he went to Egypt got
[1:40:44] exalted when the prison of falsely
[1:40:45] accused but God was with him
[1:40:47] amen and God raised him up and Joseph of
[1:40:50] the Old Testament is a type of Jesus cry
[1:40:52] the new I challenge yesterday somebody
[1:40:54] on that that said Joseph of the Old
[1:40:57] Testament is the type of Joseph Branham
[1:40:58] which I give all respect to him and the
[1:41:00] voice of God but they never got back
[1:41:02] with me I challenge him on that they
[1:41:03] never got back this I'm waiting to hear
[1:41:04] back from them about that because Joseph
[1:41:08] or the Old Testament was a type of Jesus
[1:41:09] Christ praise the Lord he's a type of
[1:41:13] Jesus Christ because he was sold for
[1:41:17] nearly thirty pieces of silver right
[1:41:19] twenty I'm sorry he was twenty pieces
[1:41:23] yeah twenty pieces of silver and he was
[1:41:26] exalted to the right hand and every knee
[1:41:29] and every tongue had every knee had to
[1:41:31] bow every tongue you had to confess that
[1:41:32] Joseph was in the town a man Joseph was
[1:41:35] there so here you have the enemies once
[1:41:38] of Joseph forced to come and they just
[1:41:40] they're not even realized what they're
[1:41:42] doing they're just falling into the plan
[1:41:43] of God amen
[1:41:44] Joseph was the one who kept the word
[1:41:46] Joseph was the one that worship God amen
[1:41:48] Joseph was the one that did not deny the
[1:41:50] name of God amen and they were the lying
[1:41:53] brothers they're the ones that lied and
[1:41:56] said we're right with God we know what
[1:41:58] happened to Joseph and all these and
[1:41:59] they lied about it and so God made the
[1:42:01] liars come bow at the feet of those who
[1:42:04] live true to God amen it's exactly right
[1:42:08] all prefiguring the white throne
[1:42:11] judgment which we close with in just a
[1:42:14] moment
[1:42:14] did you know in second Kings to those
[1:42:17] sons of prophets were watching he lied
[1:42:19] you and he was going to go and they kept
[1:42:22] saying he lied your masters gonna leave
[1:42:23] today he said hold your peace close your
[1:42:27] mouth I know he's gonna leave today but
[1:42:29] I'm watching him I'm gonna make sure I
[1:42:30] got that double anointing he said you
[1:42:34] may your masters gonna leave today see
[1:42:36] that they're just egging him on they're
[1:42:38] just trying to discourage him they were
[1:42:40] just trying to upset that next prophet
[1:42:42] in line amen
[1:42:44] but then when Elijah went up Elijah was
[1:42:47] right there
[1:42:47] he caught the anointing he caught the
[1:42:49] mantle and he said where is the god of
[1:42:52] Elijah and he started using the mantle
[1:42:54] like a lie to use the mantle that's what
[1:42:56] we're supposed to be we're supposed to
[1:42:57] catch the anointing that was on brother
[1:42:59] Branham which was the Holy Ghost and
[1:43:01] we're supposed to say where is the God
[1:43:02] of William Branham
[1:43:03] and used the word like he used it amen
[1:43:07] it's in the name of Jesus Christ Satan
[1:43:10] you must move back in the name of Jesus
[1:43:13] Christ were supposed to be the ones with
[1:43:15] a double anointing amen
[1:43:16] that's exactly right using the mantle of
[1:43:19] the power of the word of God hallelujah
[1:43:21] and I'm glad I've seen it move back
[1:43:23] kidney stones I've seen that lorry I've
[1:43:27] seen it move back migraines amen
[1:43:29] I've seen that move back nerve trouble
[1:43:32] and back surgery I've seen the mantle of
[1:43:34] Elijah moved back all these things why
[1:43:37] because it's got to move back because
[1:43:39] he's the same God yesterday today and
[1:43:41] forever amen
[1:43:44] hallelujah aren't you glad for the
[1:43:47] mantle of Jesus Christ glory but after
[1:43:51] that when Elijah did that he smote the
[1:43:53] waters the Bible said all those sons of
[1:43:56] the prophets came and bowed themselves
[1:43:57] before heel I sure searched the
[1:44:00] scriptures they're the ones egging them
[1:44:02] on and trying to make it they thought
[1:44:04] they were the true church but God always
[1:44:06] shows who the true church is the liars
[1:44:09] the ones that are a little mischievous
[1:44:11] they'll come in worship at the feet of
[1:44:13] the true believer that's exactly right
[1:44:18] you know the story of Jesus and the
[1:44:20] demons of the maniac of Gadara they came
[1:44:24] running to Jeter the maniac came running
[1:44:27] to Jesus remember and felt on his feet
[1:44:29] and said have mercy on us before our
[1:44:32] time and they told Jesus don't send me
[1:44:35] here and Jesus just said one word go
[1:44:39] right go and the man fell down like he
[1:44:42] was dead he said oh let me follow you as
[1:44:44] an apostle and Jesus said no stay here
[1:44:45] be a light in gaturro let the light of
[1:44:48] shining gaturro you stay here and you
[1:44:50] start a church you stay here let the
[1:44:52] light of Christ tell everybody how you
[1:44:54] got delivered to everybody how will the
[1:44:56] liars and demons had to fall down at the
[1:44:58] feet of Jesus a man let the light of
[1:45:00] Christ shine in your town amen
[1:45:03] it's exactly right be the example amen
[1:45:05] be the light shine be the worshiper in
[1:45:08] your town be the one who gives
[1:45:10] extravagant praise to Jesus
[1:45:12] there's too much praise for everything
[1:45:14] else today everything else gets praise
[1:45:16] except Jesus
[1:45:17] and so it shows it's not true worship
[1:45:21] it's not true worship people start
[1:45:23] checking their watch how long is this
[1:45:25] guy gonna preach today don't you
[1:45:27] understand I'm giving an extravagant
[1:45:28] praise to Jesus
[1:45:29] I feel Jesus wants me to keep going so
[1:45:32] he can get more praise amen so somebody
[1:45:35] can get more of the word and get a
[1:45:36] revelation because we cannot
[1:45:38] overemphasize the importance of
[1:45:40] spiritual revelation to the believer and
[1:45:43] the place where you receive spiritual
[1:45:44] revelation is in the house of God
[1:45:46] because faith cometh by hearing and
[1:45:48] hearing by the Word of God amen
[1:45:51] it's exactly right that's why church
[1:45:53] that's why if we sit and then sermons
[1:45:55] don't do anything for us it's our fault
[1:45:57] because we're not praying for revelation
[1:45:59] of the word if we're praying for
[1:46:01] revelation more than anything else God
[1:46:03] will give it to us because the Bible
[1:46:05] says ask God for wisdom he'll not deny
[1:46:07] you he'll give it to you you just must
[1:46:09] have faith and nothing doubting Amen
[1:46:12] that's why the service itself is so
[1:46:14] telling about your spiritual condition
[1:46:15] are you worshiping or you're not
[1:46:18] receiving any spiritual revelation
[1:46:19] that's your fault because jesus said I
[1:46:21] need to be kissed I need to be
[1:46:24] worshipped I need to be adored I need to
[1:46:26] be exalted and people are bringing a
[1:46:28] false worship they're bringing a cane
[1:46:30] offering rather than bringing the true
[1:46:32] offering of Abell praise God and the
[1:46:35] church said that's exactly right that's
[1:46:38] nothing but the truth remember to
[1:46:41] Wednesdays go ahead to the service by
[1:46:42] sharing all the inspiration all the
[1:46:44] revelations got to give me from the
[1:46:45] church age series so far I live on those
[1:46:48] I live on those those revelations give
[1:46:51] me strength to keep up fulfilling the
[1:46:54] Word of God for my life they keep
[1:46:57] unlocking the mysteries of the secret to
[1:46:59] my life and my ministry of my family the
[1:47:01] Word of God keeps on unfolding and
[1:47:03] unfolding it's the mystery of his will
[1:47:05] for our lives that's exactly right
[1:47:08] now the last two I got quotes for I have
[1:47:11] quotes for the other ones but didn't
[1:47:13] have time to put them on here so last
[1:47:15] two i got quotes for look what he says
[1:47:16] this is in the 1960 sermon december 10th
[1:47:19] that i got three minutes glory yeah
[1:47:21] alright so here's the scripture now he
[1:47:24] quotes it so these are the exams act
[1:47:26] worse down here except he takes out Jews
[1:47:28] and mother Ram types these Jews which
[1:47:30] they they are
[1:47:31] Phil so brother Graham brings it to the
[1:47:33] New Testament so there's synagogues of
[1:47:37] liars that say their spirit fill but or
[1:47:39] not oh the church we ought to search our
[1:47:41] lives and make sure we're spear filled
[1:47:42] because we don't want to be someone
[1:47:45] lying saying I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:47:46] when we really don't got it and if you
[1:47:50] got it you're gonna worship because
[1:47:53] that's your whole life my life is a
[1:47:56] sacrifice of worship cetera so the
[1:48:03] Prophet said see they which say that
[1:48:04] they say their spirit fill but they're
[1:48:06] not spirit filled now look at the
[1:48:11] example he gives he gives the foolish
[1:48:12] virgin as an example of coming to
[1:48:15] worship before the feet of the wise
[1:48:17] virgin isn't that striking I never
[1:48:20] thought of that in a hundred years until
[1:48:21] I listened to the sermon last couple
[1:48:22] weeks ago he said don't you remember the
[1:48:25] sleeping virgin when she raised up now
[1:48:27] remember what was she called there's 10
[1:48:29] of them that went out to meet the
[1:48:30] bridegroom is that right 5 was wise had
[1:48:32] oil in their lamp
[1:48:33] how many knows what oil signifies in the
[1:48:35] Bible spirit that's in Zechariah 4 now
[1:48:37] one couldn't say you're not sanctified
[1:48:39] and I'm not they was all sanctified a
[1:48:44] foolish virgin is someone who's
[1:48:46] sanctified by the Holy Spirit but the
[1:48:48] Holy Spirit has not baptized them into
[1:48:50] the body yet they just have a clean
[1:48:54] heart and mind like John Wesley
[1:48:55] appreciate have a clean heart in mind he
[1:48:58] says now no one couldn't say you're not
[1:48:59] saying to fie there was all sanctified
[1:49:00] all sanctified but 5 was wise enough to
[1:49:03] have the wisdom of Revelation Oh
[1:49:06] hallelujah
[1:49:07] the wisdom of Revelation got a revealed
[1:49:10] faith God had revealed the meaning of
[1:49:13] the Bible to them
[1:49:14] how many men to catch that door see the
[1:49:18] open door to be filled with the spirit
[1:49:20] they had oil in their lamps and the
[1:49:22] others had no oil and when they were
[1:49:28] awakened why
[1:49:29] here they come up to them and said oh
[1:49:31] give me some of your Holy Spirit give me
[1:49:33] some and said yeah sorry sister just got
[1:49:35] enough for myself I ain't got any to
[1:49:36] spare and I feel the same way today I
[1:49:38] don't have any Holy Ghost to share I
[1:49:40] need all the Holy Ghost I got to keep me
[1:49:42] going next week and the week after and
[1:49:44] next month and next year
[1:49:45] all the holy ghost I can't share any
[1:49:47] with you I know I got it from Jesus I'm
[1:49:49] kissing the son and you and I must all
[1:49:51] have our own Holy Ghost we must all be
[1:49:53] packing God's life within us and our
[1:49:55] lamps must be trimmed and burning and we
[1:49:57] must worship God in spirit and in truth
[1:49:59] amen
[1:50:00] you'd like to give it to somebody else
[1:50:01] but you can't I preached for them to get
[1:50:04] it but it's up to them all right I
[1:50:05] preached everywhere I go and want people
[1:50:07] to be filled with this and if you're
[1:50:08] fill it that you're a true worshiper
[1:50:10] amen
[1:50:12] people can see you extravagantly praise
[1:50:14] Christ oh yeah you're not holding back
[1:50:20] like you're not stingy well the man said
[1:50:23] you want to revival he said you cannot
[1:50:25] be stingy with your worship so the
[1:50:30] opposite of stingy is extravagant or
[1:50:32] generous we all know what stingy with
[1:50:34] money is I ain't giving you a penny more
[1:50:37] you better give that boundary funding
[1:50:39] all that back now I'm the fool that will
[1:50:43] just pay it you know okay whatever you
[1:50:45] can have my money I don't care but with
[1:50:49] your praise we have to be generous with
[1:50:51] our praise to Christ now did you come in
[1:50:53] here and were you generous during the
[1:50:55] song service how about one brother a
[1:50:57] mentor brother Jose was singing special
[1:50:58] were you generous in your worship were
[1:51:01] you singing along where you just tried
[1:51:04] now I'm not saying if you got children
[1:51:05] crawling all over you I know what that's
[1:51:07] like you know and they're they're
[1:51:08] putting their fingers in your ear and
[1:51:10] mesons play with my hair and worship you
[1:51:13] know I'm trying to trying to give
[1:51:15] extravagant praise I'm talking about
[1:51:17] when we can do it are we doing it as our
[1:51:22] heart did we come here to worship or we
[1:51:25] just come in here with MAO service oh I
[1:51:28] honor God with my lips all I'll say
[1:51:30] hallelujah praise the Lord but is it
[1:51:33] real worship I know I'm challenging the
[1:51:36] I'm jonesing myself I'm an I know I was
[1:51:38] gonna preach this today so I was praying
[1:51:39] in my closet with extravagant worship
[1:51:40] this morning I don't have any Holy Ghost
[1:51:45] to spare I'm sorry I wish I could give
[1:51:47] you some of my Holy Ghost by can't spare
[1:51:48] any because it's sealed inside of me
[1:51:50] it's sealed and I can't go unsealed I'm
[1:51:53] sealed to the day of my Redemption amen
[1:51:55] and so while he they said go and prep
[1:51:58] the wise said go and pray up and while
[1:52:01] they were going to get some the
[1:52:02] bridegroom came and they went into the
[1:52:03] wedding supper and they was left without
[1:52:06] where they'll go through the tribulation
[1:52:08] period watch this in a little couple
[1:52:10] more minutes see it'll go right into the
[1:52:11] Tribulation Period because they weren't
[1:52:13] true worshipers they had truth
[1:52:15] sanctification but then have the baptism
[1:52:17] the Holy Ghost that makes you a true
[1:52:21] worshiper spirit and truth now here's
[1:52:26] the - cause then I got two more quotes
[1:52:27] it yeah you know you know I'm almost
[1:52:28] done here and my time or did go off so I
[1:52:30] mean yeah I just need a couple more
[1:52:32] minutes here sorry let's stand though
[1:52:35] let's tan we'll get you standing they'll
[1:52:37] make me close sooner oh I want to be a
[1:52:41] true worshipper today I want to be a
[1:52:47] overcomer I don't wanna be a liar I
[1:52:50] don't wanna lie and say well I'm a
[1:52:51] synagogue of the Jews or in other words
[1:52:53] I'm a Holy Ghost filled Christian I
[1:52:55] don't want to say that and not really be
[1:52:56] one I want to be one
[1:52:59] well good way to check is with communion
[1:53:03] I'll examine myself you examine
[1:53:06] yourselves whether we be in the faith
[1:53:07] are we worshiping like we ought to is
[1:53:12] Christ valued number one above
[1:53:13] everything else
[1:53:15] that's what respect is value highly
[1:53:18] valuing Christ above everything else
[1:53:22] I'll make them to come and worship
[1:53:24] before thy feet and to know that I have
[1:53:26] loved thee my first Corinthians 62 do
[1:53:30] you not know that the Saints should
[1:53:32] judge the world so now we know where is
[1:53:34] this gonna happen where's where is this
[1:53:35] gonna happen when the the liars come and
[1:53:37] stand before and worship at the feet of
[1:53:39] the Saints is gonna happen at the white
[1:53:41] throne judgment which we just preached
[1:53:44] on about three weeks ago not only will
[1:53:45] there be 12 apostles on 12 Thrones
[1:53:47] judging the 12 tribes of Israel
[1:53:49] but the
[1:53:49] Saints also will judge the world that is
[1:53:53] when these who claim to belong to God
[1:53:55] and claim that God loves them we'll find
[1:53:57] out exactly who's a child of God and who
[1:53:59] is loved of the son yes that day is
[1:54:01] coming when it will be made manifest
[1:54:03] these who are now ruling the world in a
[1:54:06] measure and who during the last age will
[1:54:08] build an image to the Beast whereby they
[1:54:10] will actually rule the world will one
[1:54:12] day be humble when Jesus comes with his
[1:54:13] Saints to judge the world in
[1:54:15] righteousness that is exactly what we
[1:54:18] saw Matthew 25 all the ones who missed
[1:54:20] the first resurrection will stand before
[1:54:22] the judge in the bride last quote here
[1:54:26] now you recall that the beginning of
[1:54:28] verse 7 I said that verse 9 would help
[1:54:30] us to understand it everybody remember
[1:54:32] that I hope you saw that I meant what I
[1:54:36] meant Jesus sent him forth forth himself
[1:54:39] as he that is holy true and the only
[1:54:42] reality the one with the key of David I
[1:54:45] hope you can say amen to that
[1:54:46] it's Christ the only reality in your
[1:54:48] life what's real to you
[1:54:51] where are you most sincere at I hope
[1:54:54] it's right here
[1:54:55] and in your home praying before God
[1:54:57] Christ has to be a reality where he is
[1:55:02] exalted above everything else he has to
[1:55:05] be a living reality oh how my heart
[1:55:10] desires that for all of us that's
[1:55:12] exactly true those phrases describe him
[1:55:14] perfectly
[1:55:15] but the Jews and his day refused him and
[1:55:17] all that he was they rejected their
[1:55:19] Savior and all he meant to them the
[1:55:20] nominal Christian has now done the same
[1:55:22] they have done what the Jews did exactly
[1:55:24] the Jews crucified him and then turned
[1:55:26] him turned on the true believer
[1:55:28] the nominal Christian has crucified him
[1:55:30] afresh and turned on the true Church to
[1:55:32] destroy it but God is true and he who is
[1:55:36] above all will yet return and when he
[1:55:39] does he will show who the only potentate
[1:55:42] is and as he proves himself to the world
[1:55:45] and all the world bows at his feet at
[1:55:48] that time all the world will bow at the
[1:55:50] feet of the Saints proving that they
[1:55:56] were right in their stand with him
[1:55:59] blessed be God for evermore
[1:56:03] hallelujah you love the Lord tonight or
[1:56:05] today parmie it's almost tonight well
[1:56:07] actually is afternoon I hope you can
[1:56:10] understand by God's grace every
[1:56:11] understand let's just bow our heads for
[1:56:14] word a prayer here of course we're going
[1:56:29] to sing in a few moments - it's a chance
[1:56:30] to really worship to show God how
[1:56:34] valuable he is to you is it really the
[1:56:37] most valuable thing in your life is he
[1:56:41] really getting all your extravagant
[1:56:43] praise you praise things more than
[1:56:46] Christ what do we love the most
[1:56:55] how many but raise your hand say for the
[1:56:57] Jessie please pray for me I feel like I
[1:56:59] haven't been given him extravagant
[1:57:00] praise I feel like I haven't been
[1:57:02] worshiping him with where you saw the
[1:57:08] hands I'm trusting everyone is sincere
[1:57:11] more or does I prepare this message
[1:57:16] Norden as I would say you prepare this
[1:57:22] idea of the worship and to me I start
[1:57:24] studying it through the scripture
[1:57:25] Moorcock Lord I've truly felt refreshed
[1:57:33] to know what worship means to come to
[1:57:36] the master offer generous grace oh Jesus

[1:58:18] your praise more this world temp sister
[1:58:25] praise and adore so many things but we
[1:58:30] know through your power we can cast all
[1:58:32] of our cares upon you because you care
[1:58:35] for us we don't want to be found saying
[1:58:40] well I honored the message under the
[1:58:43] Holy Spirit with my lips but my heart
[1:58:45] was not really in the worship we were
[1:58:52] not hearts to be behind it as well then
[1:58:57] we can have a covenant Lord that it was
[1:58:58] like Stevens it's like an angel how

[2:00:12] we receive the word we've heard we will
[2:00:15] we be governed by the Holy Spirit will
[2:00:18] we accept the commands of the Holy
[2:00:20] Spirit

[2:09:19] finances anything that would come
[2:09:22] against their current system they
[2:09:27] clashed with the Lord we love you so
[2:09:31] much today we want your word to come
