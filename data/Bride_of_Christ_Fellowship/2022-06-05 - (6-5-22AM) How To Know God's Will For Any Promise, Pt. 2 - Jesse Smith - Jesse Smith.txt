========================================

as we get to the word of god heavenly father you've been so good to us lord god we just want to take this moment as we read your word and preach the gospel lord god that we can tell you thank you for being so good to us lord god psalms tells us lord your thoughts for us are so great they can't be numbered david knew it lord god your grace was so great upon him as i showed my brother last week in ephesians we will spend ages lord god you reminded me of the scripture we'll spend ages looking at the kindness of how our savior appeared to us you've been so good you've been so merciful giving us all we need health family a christian family god home church lord god blessings food on the table you've been so good to us we just want to turn and say thank you lord god as we look into your word here today you've been good to us [Music] lord we come with appreciation thanksgiving minister ministered everyday lord i'm not sufficient i have no ability of my own lord and you can only use me if i surrender all my ability because i have none dear god so lord just use me god that your people would be blessed encouraged strengthened here today we're looking to you the author and finisher of our faith lord be with those we don't see lord i didn't see brother banning and sisters see us i'll pray just minister to them or perhaps they're sicker or tired or something i just pray and minister to them lord today father all the saints strengthen them today in your holy presence in jesus christ saint said god bless you let's take our bibles here as we're standing i want to just read you part two of what we looked at on wednesday how to know god's will for any promise so let's go to jeremiah 29 11 and go there this might be the last one we'll kind of see how it goes here today jeremiah 29 11. some of the most beautiful uh passages of the scripture you know emma after graduation she had this verse up you know never entered my brother paul and amanda they have this versus their wedding you know it's appropriate for any occasion praise god because god is so gracious and he has thoughts plans for us how many thankful for god thoughts of peace on your life praise amen he's going to give us an expected end but you know we've been looking at here in the last wednesday you know how to find god's will so this gives us comfort that god has a will for us and then he tells us how to find that verse 11 let's just read verse 11 together and then i'll read afterwards verse 11 one two three for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expectation again this is spoken to a backslidden israel who was kicked out of their promised land but of course notice there's a little remnant in there of the backslidden right there's a remnant and god was going to bring the believing remnant back to israel so it wasn't all evil right in other words god deals justly with every individual so if your heart is right with god god's going to bless you praise god yes hallelujah now i'll read verse 12 then shall ye call upon me and he shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you so if we want god's peace if we want god's plan we've got to go we've got to leave right we've got to come go to him that means we have to leave our daily uh our daily responsibilities at some point and find a time to seek god's face we've got to go and seek him now of course this meant physically they would go back to israel the program says this means go back to pentecost amen hallelujah he said that the message desperations he said and i will hearken to you verse 13 and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all our heart now church we all know there's times of our lives when we're really seeking god with all of our hearts and other times when we're not you know we we all know that because we're convicted by the holy spirit and but we also know there's seasons we also know seasons of life where you're in desperation and then then you have seasons of rest praise god and so let's remember that you know as we want to know god's will for our lives in these situations uh verse 14 and i will be found of you so see if we put everything we have into seeking god's will we'll find god's will saith the lord i'll turn away your captivity and i will gather you from all the nations amen may god has blessed the reading of his word you may be seated praise god so looking at part two here and i really am going to try to preach an hour hopefully i really want to do that i preached like six hours last week my voice is really tired so try to take care of myself as i promised someone i would and yesterday we had you know a taekwondo test so i'm all worn out from that you know but i got to take care of my body if not i'm going to turn into a disease-filled person and i don't want to do that i want to be a healthy person so i have some quotes here we'd like to share by god's grace how to know god's uh will for any promise of god we'll just kind of work towards the ending you know the ending is kind of where we ended wednesday but just let me briefly review part one in 2016 i preached on divine healing in the other sanctuary over there and how to approach it and i basically had there's four steps to know just about divine healing if you want to know if god's going to heal you but then i saw that this was actually applicable to every promise of god i saw the same thing if i want to know god's will first i must confess my sins right because the bible says if your heart condemns you god won't hear you but then god god is greater than our hearts amen amen so for rebellious if we won't repent then god will bring us to repentance the goodness of god will lead us to repentance amen amen and then once we've confessed then we must actually ask for god's perfect will because the bible says we have not because we ask not we wonder why is this happening what's going to happen with this person well have we prayed about it you know we desire to see god move in certain ways but have we prayed about it have we actually asked god what his perfect will is for the situation and then third you know we must accept god's will and then act like it now this may mean god will show us what's going to happen or we realize we have to wait for it that church let's be honest most of us we got to realize we got to wait for it right because we're not prophets right god doesn't give us thus saith the lords all the time to know okay i know this is going to happen to my mom this is going to happen to my dad this is going to happen to me it's going to happen at this time most of us aren't prophets amen so a lot of a lot of it is going to be just accepting that okay this is god's will to test my faith this is god's will to try me with the fiery trials of my faith praise god in other words this is going to be an abrahamic situation where abraham had to wait 25 years praise god and notice as he went along church god revealed more about the promise at the beginning it was just go out to a land you're going to be father many nations but then it was then you're going to you're going to have a son and then later and then i thought it was hagar then he tried to get through hagar but then it's no it's through sarah yeah so that's called progressive revelation amen thank god that god reveals more about his will as time goes on hallelujah he did that with jesus's birth you know from the garden of eden they prophesied uh uh uh the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent and then micah says it'll come out of bethlehem of ephratea ephrata i always say that wrong the least of the the tribes of israel praise god it'll come out of there but as time went on more and more revelation was about it and that's what we can expect in our lives praise god we can expect more revelation about our lives as we go on serving the lord that's what happened with brother branham right first bowl second full third fall hallelujah and so we got to and church and let me say like this if if we don't know it then we've just got to thank god and know that god will give us the best uh answer for our lives that will make us the best christians praise god amen that's what i mean by act like being thankful even though you don't have what you want be thankful because you know god knows what you need amen amen hallelujah and then just for you what you know you similar to number three but you wait or seek the channel for it to come in now divine healing the channel may be right here the channel may be right here i'll anoint you with oil or brother cam or whether digs or somebody will anoint you and god will just give you faith and in that moment you'll know god heard my prayer or maybe a prayer cloth i still got some prayer cloths under here but those day that we prayed for or it might be just a prayer call put this in your bible read your bible every day take it out you know later on you sleep with it whatever you have to do it might be that channel or it might be the channel of a dream or it might be a channel of just sitting in the service or listening to brother random at home you know it might just be in that channel that god will speak something and then you'll know god was talking to you praise god because you're waiting for the channel you know it's god's will or you believe it's god's will just waiting on the channel for it to come in now does that help by god's grace yeah as i was you know brother amen ask me that question last sunday after service that was such a great question but i thought well i think that'll help the church you know so i thought i'd preach on it at least a few services here uh by the grace of god and so we find out that's this is kind of how our approach should be as we wait upon every promise of god and then i showed on wednesday you know brother branham program was many times an evangelist the holy spirit said do the work of an evangelist yes he pastored for a number of years i believe from 33 if i'm not mistaken to 46 or 47 when he went on the mission field there maybe longer than that might have been longer than that too i think in one place he said he fasted for 18 years so but brother random learned when he was out on the evangelistic field he had to make it seem like the promises were to everyone that anyone could receive it right even though he knew that wasn't the case in other words he knew not everybody would receive it now i i take the different approach because i'm in a pastoral ministry now what if you had to wait on a promise for 10 years and every week i said it's for you it's for you it's coming soon it's for you god's with you and jesus is never late jesus right on time wouldn't you be a little discouraged i mean after a while you might be a little discouraged why is this taking so long brother you're preaching like it's coming right now you're preaching like it's for me like it's for everybody right that's just how it is so i just take a slightly different approach that uh it's your it's your duty and your response and mine too it's our responsibility to seek the will of god for our lives let me just give you an example of you know name we might remember this in beatrice uh on a wednesday night a year ago i was preaching on the blessing and cursing series i don't know how many people was here that's why i know they were here because i remember that they were here and i just got real emotional at the end of the service i don't know if you remember this and i cursed the spirit of depression on my dad do you remember that and believing that god would bring him out of depression because i just talked to him you know a few months before that we had the best talk we ever had and then i cursed uh the spirit of unforgiveness on my mom now she has since told me she's forgiven him so that that was a blessing but the one on my dad hasn't come to pass now how do i look at that do i look at i spoke in the name of the lord but i have to look at it as either either it was god's will now god answered the one with my mom but the one with my dad my dad's still battling that so see how do i look at that you know i've got to look at it like this like i was asking god for my desire i was hoping god would do it that's the only way i could say it i was hoping god would do it or it could be the perfect will of god but i've just got to wait longer right because some of the times when i've seen god move the most was when i was most emotional i've been weeping and crying uh at least three or four times i've spoken to mountains spiritual mountains and they've moved in the name of jesus christ the one was with my co-worker i see this paper bugging me i left some paper on the floor so i'm just gonna pick it up okay nothing to do with the sermon he's bugging me my co-worker her name was nikki and they couldn't have kids i did a bible study at her house and one of the people even rebuked me uh and i just you know i just took it you know just saying how you can create my battles in your devil the devil can be in your mind if you'd be a believer and they said no no and everyone looked at me like you're wrong i was like i'm right and one morning in prayer i just saw my knees on a saturday and i looked out the window i was weeping and crying for nicki and her husband i can't remember husband's name but i said i speak to that mountain of infertility and i command to move in the name of jesus christ it wasn't a few days later i got a picture of them holding up their pregnancy test and they had a little baby girl and then i saw her in fairlawn a few years later after this right by the thirsty dog coffee place i don't know if you know where it's right near cleveland road i don't know she was going in to get a smoothie and i saw right before school i said how you doing nikki she said praise the lord i don't know she said i said that and she said you know how to dream about you that we're going to have more kids and i was like like oh my i don't know i said well glory to god and then i saw her a year later she's she's like uh we just had twins and that was the dream that came to pass so the second one i had nothing to do with the first one i had god had me do something to do with right okay so that's one time i spoke to the mountain the other time was who is dead that wasn't crying during that time i was just believing it because i woke up that morning at 4 30 couldn't go back to bed there's power of life and death in the tongue uh the other then the third time was one that i shared in a point last week my high school best friend's dad died i'm sorry didn't die all the way he had a stroke but when simon said he saw all the signs like gideon and simon come back and said he's healed and i was doubting i just went the prayer clause and i was just crying and i gave god a vow i said god i vow if you'll move this mountain i will tell that man about the message and i said i speak to that mountain of heart disease in the name of jesus christ and i said let tom come out of that hospital completely well and he did like a month later that took a while okay so uh and then i called him on the phone i told him about brother graham he's like oh yeah uh yeah he said too bad god didn't show him about his death in a car accident and i was like okay at that moment i was just grieving i said okay well he pointed us back to the bible and i just tried to end this and the call after that i was really grieved you know but i did my part i told him i told him that you know what god has done for us is god sent us a prophet back to the word of god i shared about the message and he turned it down that's okay he's still alive today church he's still alive today so i'm just sharing that example i know naomi and beatrice would remember that and i preached on blessings and cursings so i've got to take that situation back to here you know uh i spoke against those spirits because i felt really emotional felt really moved and one way god answered with my mom but i'm still waiting on the one for my dad okay so we gotta we gotta judge every situation and maybe in that in that situation that maybe in the moment that we try to believe god's word we don't know if it's actually a revelation or if it's just hope but as i as i ended on uh as i ended on wednesday night let's turn to first corinthians 13 if you have the love of god you will hope in the will of god for your life amen amen and that's what i'm trusting in church uh because like i said a lot of times i don't have i don't have a hundred percent thus save the lord i mean it's rarely ever happened in my life i would ever say that like i knew it was thus saith the lord because if so i would be a prophet and then i'd be able to say or a minor prophet which some of you might be you know you might we just have to talk about it kind of remember the situations that happened but i found that most time i'm just hoping or i just have some inspiration or some emotion and i speak god's word because i feel so moved emotionally to do it i recognize wow this is different than other prayers i've had i feel the presence of the lord i feel real sincerity amen i feel real sacredness so we speak the word of god but ultimately i would say we all come back to this let god's will be done not my will be done amen right like even when johnny come up here when he had that ankle problem about a year ago whatever it was he told me in prayer life he said brother jesse i know if you curse this god is going to heal my ankle it's been it's been it's been swollen for a week right and he says it keeps getting worse well i didn't know i just said well okay i'll take you at your word i cursed the i laid my hands on the ankle i cursed it he said the next day was ninety percent better than that that week was 100 well that god's great but there's a time i don't know i'm just taking his testimony and i'm hoping god doesn't but i don't know for sure because i didn't have a vision i didn't have a dream i don't have thousands of lord i'm not a prophet so what i'm saying is that the love of god makes us hope in the lord amen amen that's what i'm saying amen first corinthians 13 7 we end with that one bear so charity bears all things see charity can bear with someone when they're when they're in the wrong spirit in other words you can you can be patient with someone if you've got charity that's why i want to be patient with all the jeffersonville people and all the bride pride people all the prideful bride members that call themselves the greatest of all time you can bear that if you have the holy ghost you can bear people's mistakes hallelujah and and one proof that you love me is that you put up with me to spot my mistakes is that right you can put up with your pastor because you can bear all things you can bear my mistakes right and i can bear yours because we're a family praise god beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things and then we get this great scripture charity never fails hallelujah love will never fail praise god amen the love of jesus christ cannot fail the love of jesus christ will always be there praise god the love of jesus christ is eternal love amen amen hallelujah so if you have a portion of that eternal life then you'll be able to hope for all things and that's what i look at you know what i want to know the will of god brother you know that's another great question when i want to know the will of god all i can do is look at the scriptures and then hope that this is what god's gonna do and then watch and see what god will do and then i must rejoice in whatever god allows to come to pass because it's god's it's god's will not my will and remember just like as a guy i don't want my permissive will i want god's perfect will even if that would mean like hezekiah even if it would mean we would go to the grave early now we're all believing we'll go in the rapture but what if we don't all right what if god jerry's 100 more years to take the message around the world now we want to be thankful whatever god allows to come to pass but if we have the love of jesus christ we can hope for the best and we can hope for our desires but ultimately we've got to trust god he'll give us what's best for us amen now remember here's where moderator said that just so you know he says now we have to preach the gospel that healing is raw yet we know it's not so when you're an evangelist or something a prophet and you're just with new crowds every night you know you've got to preach it oh it's for everybody it's for everybody it's for everybody but then you when you really get down to a church you don't always know for every individual case you don't always know unless god would show you yeah right can i give you an example from bubba's ministry let me i just feel like maybe i'll just go to this one right now because remember this when i preached this in uh the purpose series well that was about three or four years remember who's that anyone remember sister sister andy wright's younger sister edith wright so hattie wright is the sister that uh her husband died and she had two boys and she lived on a land and they had a hill and they just planted crops on their hills and uh she gave brother branham 20 for construction yeah on the new tabernacle brother brown was going to give that money back and he was inside of her house but then the holy spirit said don't he said remember that with a woman who gave a few pennies so he didn't do it but he was going to do it and he was telling the brothers about the squirrels and remember hattie wright said that's nothing but the truth amen and he said the holy spirit just blew in that room yeah real sacred and he said give her whatever she asked for and she said what do i ask for brother adam he said you could ask for the healing of your sister eden you could ask for the health of your mother and father he said you can ask for a million dollars he said but just as a witness that i'm god's prophet whatever you ask for you're gonna get right now again hallelujah and she said what do i ask for he said ask for the thing that is the greatest desire of your heart thank god money wasn't the greatest desire for heart amen and she asked for the salvation of her two boys i give you their salvation in the name of jesus christ now god can't force that so see god must have known they've been wanting to repent but they were fighting against it as little teenage boys or preteens we might call them i don't remember i don't know their exact age but bromance said they ran over to their lap with their mom and wept and cried and then they got baptized and were doing foot washing with with all the saints they wrote about it in the generation but brother jose got me yeah and one of the sons got older he was just a truck driver and i think if i'm not mistaken they were going to draft him into the uh he was trying to decide whether going to the military and he asked brother branham and i think brother brandon said go ahead and do it he said you're going to come back and be well i know you're not going to die in other words he didn't want to die and he didn't want to miss the rapture but brother man told him go do it you'll be well he did and he came back and he was well by god's grace but this was hattie's little sister edith now look at her legs look see how her legs are paralyzed and twisted up like that she's in a wheelchair yeah i just want to you know if i hadn't i hadn't preached this for a number of years i just thought i'd bring this out again how do you know the will of god for every situation the reality is you don't but if god doesn't answer that god is letting you know his will his will is not to do an immediate thing it's going to be a test of faith and we've got to act like we trust god amen we've got to act like we believe god amen no matter what god allows to come to pass so remember here's the quote so this was an example of someone who's partially healed but i've heard preachers say god doesn't do partial things right have you ever heard that i've heard preachers say god doesn't do a halfway job god does a full job well that's true most of the time right but sometimes god does give a partial healing because this is one example hallelujah you okay brother yeah i'm gonna say we can pray for if you need hands okay okay hallelujah so it's just an example because you know again sometimes we're given messages like god always wants to heal him and god always wants to do miracles and god god will do exceed and that's true god will do it exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or think but it depends on his will for the situation you're going to see these quotes brother bam fasted and wept and cried for her healing from the paralysis i think she was paralyzed from the waist out if i'm not mistaken that's why her legs are all twisted up like that brother random said in 1959 now this isn't a new ministry this is speaking about the third poll so even in the third poll he's concerned about uh you know wanting to see her get a full victory uh brother amen can you go check on jose he might be in the men's restroom because she's not there real quick you might have to pray for him get him some food or water or something he just looked a little uh sick so brotherham said i've prayed and prayed for that little girl i've prayed to see god healer i've seen afflictions even greater than hers healed now the paralysis i've fastened i've prayed i've longed i've sought the lord with tears for the healing of that little girl the poor little fellow was afflicted when she was just an infant perhaps infantile paralysis that's drawn her little hands and feet so it kind of curls them up right curls up you see her legs growing up like that she suffered for many years and when we prayed the first time for her she stopped suffering that was 26 years ago so the suffering aspect of being paralyzed was healed right away god healed it 26 years ago from that i've been in the 30s right 30s i've been 33. when she gets a stomachache or toothache just as soon as i go to pray for i know the lord's going to take it isn't that something the lord will tell i'm going to heal the stomach i'm going to give the toothache but the lord will not tell him i'm going to heal the paralysis yet he's seen congressman upshaw get out of the wheelchair praise god but that affliction i've seen her set here in the building when other cripples would get up and walk away and the inflictions and so forth and wonder see sometimes god is going to let us wonder it's a test of our faith right and then the enemy will come in there and say well see god doesn't care god doesn't love you you're not sincere enough you did it fast enough you didn't pray enough and the whole time it might not be that it might just be god has a different testimony for this individual that's why the thing to do is confess first all your sins amen amen that way you know it's confessed yeah i'm not hindering the move of god because i've confessed all that i know how to do amen but i wonder why don't that little girl walk and i forgot to set my timer oh boy lord and now look he's even talking to the lord lord why don't you appear over her let the angel lord overshadow the child so i can speak thus saith the lord if it was up to me i'd speak it see church it was up to me i pray for every one of you and you get everything you want it was up to me all right but it's not unto me it's up to god amen but it ain't up to me it's up to him now uh this is five years later she passed away and she never got the healing from the paralysis now there he's praying before this meeting this is not jeffersonville this is somewhere else he said i got a message from the east a little lady i knew she's a little girl named edith wright passed on to meet god this afternoon at three o'clock we got to go back if there's anyone here that would like to be earned in prayer would you just raise your hand and then he says i think what's that a couple uh yeah eight months later eight months later they still didn't have a memorial service service for her and now look and then he says afterwards he said i didn't get back for edith when she went but sister wright you remember the dream she had about a couple years ago i told you that i said it's little edith won't stay with us very long now because the lord had already told that she was going through that dream that she had so god gave sister edith a dream herself that you're going to come home to meet me does that sound like as a guy set your house in order for you shall die right about two years later she went to meet god now now waiting for papa and mama to cross the dividing line between the mortal and the immortality mr i just want to remind us of this like uh you know we what i mean we all don't we all look to brother brandon's ministry is just such an encouragement don't we i mean you look at all those wonderful testimonies i look at them we all do i'm skipping back up here to where i was um we all look at those wonderful testimonies and we all want to rejoice in them but we have to remember there's times where god has a different plan than we have and so we got to be open uh to receiving god's plan and how do you know you've got to see god no doubt edith was seeking god so what did god do god sent her a dream it's your time to go you have a couple more years to live so she got a partial healing but not a complete healing is god so good is god still merciful is god still eternal does god still care of course he cares amen the bible says cast your cares on the lord for he cares for you amen amen so god in his infinite knowledge knew in his care for edith it was best for her to get a partial healing and then bring her home now for some of us that could be quite a pill to swallow but we have to trust god with our entire lives we have to trust god with everything that we have how we want to do that by god so i ended with these two conclusions if you already have the revelation then just confess your sins be happy act like you've already got it that's the easy one why shouldn't say these one uh that's the one where you already know what's gonna happen right but the other one is if you don't know the will of god now this is what i find myself in i find myself in this case the most often i don't have enough safety lord yeah and i don't know anybody that does either so don't feel bad for me right don't look down on me because i don't know anybody like that if i did i know they were a minor prophet so if you and i don't know god's will for this or this or that then we've got to daily confess our sins be happy or positive waiting and or hoping and see if god is going to move us into desperation or not for that child or sorry not for the child or for that that desire could be a child it could be anything and then while we're waiting we must worship and trust god with his will or his plan praise god now that's a great scripture charity hopes all things if you're born again with the love of god you can hope for anything your heart desires praise god now i went through our recent miracles and testimonies on wednesday night such an encouragement to us um now here's where brother adam says disappointments can happen as we grow the knowledge of god so how do you know when you're first in order how many know that in order to get in the kingdom of god you must become like a child but then the bible says move on from childhood to maturity amen so i found this when i was a younger christian i just thought well god's going to do all these miracles he's bringing in my whole family if he brought in simon and cam and me and he's bringing in everybody he's bringing my mom i mean i just i i thought and then when we had seven people in akron we started the church i thought man if god's given us seven souls in a couple years we'll have like 49 souls now we're actually getting pretty close to that with all these babies and these blessings and god said in austin lena back and god said to people from ghana all the way across the ocean that's a blessing but you know uh i i had a certain way where i thought god was gonna do it but god doesn't work to my way i want god to work in his way praise god but i have to learn that i have to grow in knowledge which means understanding i have to understand that god's that god's not always going to do what i want to do god's going to do what's best for me so sometimes church will have disappointments down through life with divine healing like with sister edith or other other situations in our life like with my dad not being saved yet since i was a boy i prayed for him to stop smoking and serve god so it's a boy i'm 40 i'm almost 42. so that was 8 or 10. so let's just say 10. so for 32 years i pray god help him to stop smoking and every time i see him he keeps smoking and keeps getting worse and worse what does that mean does that mean i'm a sinner and that's my fault that he's still smoking no every man has three more agency that's right all i can do is hope if i've got the love of god i'll keep hoping amen what can i do i prayed now for let's see my parents divorced when i was probably 12 or 13 in middle school so i prayed for all these years 30 years for them to get back together uh i don't know if it'll happen but i'm leaving in the hands of god all i can do is hope so we're going to have disappointments as we grow in the knowledge of god but we've got to still worship god despite our disappointments now remember in the sermon works as faith expressed i just copied these over from that 2016 sermon this whole sermon was a compilation or a combination of what brother adam had learned about divine healing over decades of preaching he says uh we're old men we've been in this a long time we've seen the pros and cons and everything and praying for the sick around the world and seeing the disappointments of people so wow brother i would pray for the sick and some people will be disappointed but then he'd pray for the sick and he'd see hallelujah amen that's why i've got to be encouraged if i pray for people and they don't get well i just got to have courage now the devil will attack me and say it's your fault well i'll say well i just confess my sins right here it can't be my fault the only way of being my fault is if i uh if i didn't ask them to forgive their sins first like like moses right moses uh used his gift without without the right uh spirit without without confessing his sins right and then i get in trouble with god for that that could be but if i confess all my sins it is isn't my fault god's will is something different for their life than what i thought it was going to be and what they thought it was going to be then all this church we learn by see that's why you know with message churches that they are still saying all the time god wants to heal all the time it's always god's will for miracles that means they haven't learned right and i'm not doubting them i'm just saying we've got to come to a place of maturity that whether god gives or god takes away blessed be the name of the lord amen we've got to get to the spot where we want god's will more than our own will praise god amen we're and we're god's helping us we're growing to this spot where we can trust god that god's timing is better than our timing like you know i've recently talked to austin he's come back and we've talked about he's telling me about all the things he desires god to do in his life wonderful desires and each one all we can say is brother if it's the will of god it'll come to pass right i told austin well i wish the lord would do this in my life and what god did this and i really want to do this and i like to travel and started you know uh not start start more like missionary work i told austin all these things that if we could just get a break you know amen you and i have talked about it we have all these desires but we've got to learn as time goes on we got to learn that we might have some disappointments and things that we thought but that's okay it's god it's god accomplishing his will it's god bringing us to his thoughts it's god giving us the mind of christ amen he said just like you're learning to swim you know you splash the water and grow go across across the pool and say i made her now after you learn to swim you're more graceful is the stroke and it don't wear you out so much see that's it you learn how to do it and cut every corner make it better and that's more of an easy so so it is with divine healing so it is with every question in our life it should become easier can i say like this it should become easier to wait on the lord for his answer because we're more mature now we're not like a baby like i gotta have it now i gotta have it now right that's how we were when we're young christians i've gotta have a miracle i've gotta do this i i have to see this i have to know this i have to know this no i've got to know god i've got to know god's will that's what i've got to know we're talking about going from milk to meat praise god amen so the christian life should become more easy right in other words i'll commit this in the hands of god i'll be neutral and whatever god desires i'm gonna let god do it my life now there are going to be times like paul when you have the anointing on you he had power to command that demonic spirit to leave that woman of divination right he waited for many days and she kept saying these are the true servants of god he was grieved and finally said thou fall spirit come out of her in the name of jesus christ now that's commandment so we we can be led of course we can always be led into those types of things or i speak to that uh the swelling ankle right in the name of jesus christ i rebuked that there was going to be moments with that but there's also been moments where we've got to wait on the lord you can say like this there's going to be times of lightning flashes and thunder roars emotional ties that's what i'm talking about but there's going to be times of gentle times too just waiting on the lord just trusting in the lord mighty shouts and mighty miracles and everybody clapping and screaming and crying there's gonna be times i've just got to trust god in this situation i'm committing this to god see we got to learn how many are happy to learn he said we see the same thing with preaching divine healing or anything else as you go along you begin to learn if you don't learn there's something wrong yeah see you've got to learn you've got to learn how to accept god and what it really means so the church that will mean we might have to look back at certain things that we're bothered about like why hasn't god done this or why hasn't god healed that person why does god save my dad why all these things we gotta look back that and accept god for what god is doing right we gotta look back and say lord maybe i've been bitter maybe i've been impatient forgive me for being impatient what do you really mean lord by the fact you haven't answered my prayers what do you really mean and of course what it means is god loves you still but god is either waiting giving that person time to repent or god is molding you to have more patience and the church said who doesn't need more patience lydia i could have a prayer line every service all right all you people that need patience come and get them to the prayer line everybody would everybody would get luck i'd annoy everyone with the oil and then i turn around and say hey man pray for me for patience right yeah every service yes we need more patience because we want it now just like you want that reply on the text what are they gonna text me back what are they gonna text me back when are they going to email me back are they going to answer me you know just we were you're used to that slayer to see them but we've got to learn to accept god's ways god's timing amen amen and what god really means i love this quote i hope i hope i always preach this to you and i hope you can always say amen to this quote cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval amen are the bright skies like we had him yesterday boy when a beautiful day yesterday and still waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved it's from the bosom in other words in the heart of god his love is elected where that means means chosen his love his love is chosen which he had for us before the foundation of the world amen does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because the bible says so amen and manifest that he did love us for us i'm sorry i did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us his spirit placing us as sons amen how do i know god loves me the bible says so and he saved me he sanctified me he filled me with the holy ghost he gave me a church that loves jesus amen that's how i know he loves me amen hallelujah and he's placed me as a son i'm learning how to handle the father's business hallelujah glory he raised you up as a daughter of god a child of god and you're learning how to handle your father's business hallelujah amen and how shall i prove my love to god by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy their joy in the house of the lord their joy in the house of the lord she's like yeah that's my song amen god inspired phil for me on that one how am i going to prove my love to him by believing what he said and acting with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass god cannot tempt any man but god does give permission to satan attempt a man but he says you cannot take his life in many cases right in other words you can only go this far satan hallelujah aren't you glad god hasn't uh god hasn't hold your card yet amen you're still here by the grace of god amen fighting the battles amen god can still trust you praise god his wisdom has allowed different things to come to pass uh we might have disappointment but we're still trusting god we're still believing god we're looking for more revelation amen of the will of god for our eyes amen like that list i gave you what greater miracle could we have in austerlina getting saved or did the children get baptized last year what what greater miracle is there right then if stephanie gets a hopefully she's watching god bless you or mj or some of these ones what greater miracle could there be than to see a soul go from a heart of stone to a heart of flesh and then watch as the holy spirit service after service writes his will upon the fleshly tables of their hearts and they learn to love god and serve god and serve with joy in the midst of their trials because none of us are except from trials if you are you're not a child of god you're a faster child of god if you have no trials but if you have trials then surely you know i'm a child of god thank you jesus for the trials amen thanks for correcting me and chasing me and helping me to love you more praise god that's one thing we all know about god he's wise and he orchestrates all the events of our life so that we'll learn to serve him with joy and it should get easier all the time amen amen with ease we should be able to now swim with ease now swimming is still hard work how many know that yeah and some of you are scared of the water i understand i was we had uh we had zion walking around the pond last sunday you know i was a nervous wreck come on don't fall in you know but it's still hard work right christian life is still hard work but it should get better yeah we should know what we're doing we should have better techniques we should have a better a better understanding of how to navigate these trials i know god has allowed this i know god's for me i know i'm a child of god i know i'm going to heaven i know i'm forgiven by the blood of jesus christ but god's allowed me to be tested so what does brother adam say before you try to fulfill any promise of god he says first get in the spirit revelation 1 verse 10 says i was in the spirit on the lord's day in other words get under his anointing by seeking him that's the only way to get on the anointing remember praise it pray praise god when you're when you're privatized with god praise god because he inhabits the praises of his people it's a promise if you start praising god eventually god's gonna come anoint you praise god as you're seeking his face remember bibraham says i'm gonna skip down here this is what we read earlier he says others get healing just by grace it's just given to them there's and there's the difference see that does it that's the real revelation because faith is a revelation from god it must be revealed first so before someone can know they're going to be healed it must be revealed first before someone can know their loved one's going to be saved it's got to be revealed by god first the revelation has to come first and revelation comes when you get in the spirit amen hallelujah now these are familiar quotes but i read these years ago i'm going to keep reading again and i hope you keep saying amen to them i was in the spirit isn't that just beautiful my i love that you could just call those words the whole of the christian life if we're going to live as christians we have to be in his spirit john was not talking about being in his own spirit that would have not brought these visions it had to be the spirit of god it has to be the spirit of god with us too or all our efforts are in vain paul said i will pray in the spirit i'll sing in the spirit i'll live in the spirit if there's any good thing that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word so see you get you have you're in the spirit and then that spirit will remind you of a verse and may manifest by the results it bears as surely as john need to be in the spirit to receive these tremendous revelations fresh from jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that god has given to us to live by in his word for it is the same spirit how many one live for jesus amen he just told you if you would have lived by the words of jesus get in the spirit first amen that's why we have a song service first buddy that's why we have specials up there to get you in the spirit so that when the word of god comes you can receive it you can live by it you can walk out of here living by the word that you heard he said look at it this way all too many read where it says acts 2 38 and just pass right on they don't see it if they saw it by getting the spirit they would know if they want to receive the holy spirit they need to repent be baptized in the name of the lord jesus and then god would be duty-bound to fulfill his word by filling them with the holy ghost they never get in his spirit or it happened to them exactly as the word says pray to god for revelation by spirit that is the first step get in the spirit so what's the first step pray right worship sing glorify god get in the spirit and then start going to work on the work of god i'm sorry the word of god then start acting upon the word of god but first pray first worship at first get under that anointing and then start obeying the word of god now let me use another illustration by the man says suppose you need healing what does the word say well we've all read it countless times but did not get in the spirit when reading it did we ask god for our spirit to teach us the real truth of it if we did we would call the elders confess our sins be anointed and pray for and that would be that it might not come immediately yeah the church said amen but it is spirit it is all over yes yes now see we would be hoping right we're hoping unless it was a direct revelation to us we're hoping it's all over right because again you have to look like eateth right you've got to see god for every situation ever for each and e for each life every individual life you've got to see god for your own will of god's will for your life sorry i'm going to cut it up there may the holy spirit give you revelation what i said every individual has to seek god for god's will for their life there's no other court of appeal god will fulfill his word oh we need to get in the spirit and then things will be done don't go through the acts first get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch what god will do yes amen have you noticed how the world gets in the spirit of things that are in the world they go to their ball games their sporting events their dances they enter to the spirit of it they don't sit there like wall flowers old dried up sticks they enter right into the feel of things become a part of things but oh how they hate the christians for getting in the spirit of god's word they call us fanatics and holy rollers there's nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but ignore that i said ignore that amen ignore criticism ignore satan's voice in your mind where god's not doing anything and god doesn't hear your prayers ignore that he said you can expect it but knowing where it's coming from just go on and get in the spirit of worship amen 16 years this week that's right 16 years this weekend we started the church uh the first sunday of june of 2006. glory 2006 14 15 16 years this is this is this yeah this first sunday in june no yeah yeah this yeah okay i didn't realize that now our anniversary services are later right but this is actually the beginning so for 16 years i've seen people come i've seen people go i've seen people told me i'll be the first in line uh to do anything you preach and then they turn around and they get against me i people had people tell me uh you're the most dynamic preacher i've ever met and then leave to some other place i've seen god heal people i have seen god not heal people i've seen god answer some wonderful prayers in mind i've seen others he hasn't answered i've seen happy times i've seen sad times good times i've seen hard times we've all felt and know when the church is on fire then the church is struggling right we've gone through all these times so what is our response our response is to trust god confess our sins and get in the spirit praise god i live in the good times for the bad times this is our response we've got to trust god we've got to wait on god we've got to let god perfect us amen he's doing something right now in our lives we've got to trust god we've got to learn from god we've got to believe god hallelujah amen amen there was a time about a year or two ago remember brother and it was like i was preaching just every sunday and it was like we were everybody was shouting and it was such a such a atmosphere remember that i mean brother johnny was here and uh everybody was shouting everybody was it was just a tremendous anointing and we wonder how long will that last now here we are we're the same church what's wrong nothing's wrong we just go through seasons we go through trials we go through tests but we don't criticize others when we do when we go through difficult seasons we lift them up we don't get prideful we get huggable praise god and wait as we know god's going to restore right like i'll always remember that when brother bill sanchez up there in sheffield when we first came in the message we went to their church in 2004 it would have been 2002 2003. and he said just having college people sitting on the front row standing up clapping brought their church a revival and he thanked me for that while we were sitting at his wife's funeral with her open cast right there she told my wife and i right there right by his dead way thank you for those 20 years ago thank you guys for coming our church god brought a revival our church was dying we needed a life and god sent life into the church the church that's just a reminder god's going to bring it back praise god if you're struggling it's just a season yeah it's just it's just fall it's just winter my spring is coming amen a new day's coming amen god is faithful gotta restart if you are a revival god will bring it to you hallelujah the whole time really amen all i knew was acts 2 38 and yet i was revival they could say where's revival in sheffield it's right here praise god where's the revival in africa right here right now amen hallelujah but we're waiting on god we're learning we have to ignore criticism from satan and other people now daily i get criticism on youtube so i'm learning to live with criticism okay every week i'm calling the false preacher false prophet paul's teacher i'm like you don't know nothing about the message i shouldn't say that i shouldn't say that i said you really don't know all you know about the message you think you know things but you don't know things and i say god forgive me for that and then when i present the quotes and scriptures they got nothing there's no report but see we may be criticized but we know where we stand amen church when the winds blow and the winds when the storms come your house won't fall because you're built on the rock of god's word amen that's how i know god's for me like psalmist says when my enemies come against me they do not prevail against me i prevail over them hallelujah i'm the one giving the word we're the ones speaking the word speaking the words we're speaking the word so we'll overcome we're bible believers we believe in jesus christ and god backs it up amen amen hallelujah i know god backs up other groups as well of course i believe that i listen to all five services of these uh preachers that call themselves the greatest this past weekend because this week my wife had me weed out in the garden it was pretty hot out there i was waiting at least for five or six hours so i got to put my earbuds in listen the first sermon this is the second sermon and again they call themselves one of them called one of one of the other one one of the greatest preachers of all time i mean you got enoch in there you got john the baptist in there yeah brother branham jeremiah any some of these men were mart paul john and this guy i know this guy's life he's lived as a pastor since he was 15 he's had thousands i mean unlimited money for all these years living a life of luxury can fly around the world any time he wants is that really the greatest life but after listening to them they never mentioned one thing about fasting helping the poor out of i've listened like six hours of preaching some of it was good it was there's my 30 minutes okay give me 15 minutes you see i listen to what they say but i also listen to what they don't say because remember what is true what is true anointing in the holy spirit humility serving others the greatest among you is not the one who gets served it's those who do serve right yes so see i'm listening i'll be there say but i just believe a complex has happened it's a different complex than what we normally see because it's a complex of self-confidence so for example brahms complex was criticizing the people that didn't receive his message well now they're not really criticizing anybody they're just lifting each other up and bro and say just you know the preacher that called the other one the greatest of all time the other one or one of the greatest of all time got up and said you're just a politician and the people laughed so even the preacher knew it was a far and above about beyond what he should have said he called him a politician what does the politician what does a politician do they make promises they make flattering words to try to convince you to like them right a lot of politicians they just make promises they don't keep them yeah remember joe biden said he's going to cure cancer where's that at nobody holds him accountable for that right they just make promises they can't keep so see now they can be saved but i believe something has really happened here with pride and remember broadband says if you have the holy spirit on you you're humble so see it's just really it's really like one of those anointed ones of the end times things they can have the anointing still for miracles but then they still got this complex of pride on them i still believe they're safe and i believe some of them are filled with holy ghosts now let's get back to this our spirit is clean is that how you feel when you come to church it is fresh it is real it is sober and serious but nonetheless full of the joy of the lord the christian ought to be just exuberant and full of his pleasure in the lord as the world when it savors and delights in its pleasures both christians and the world are human both have emotions the difference is the christians hearts and emotions are purely on the lord of glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh that's right so see church to get in the spirit we have to seek god right through bible study prayer remember daniel fasted for 21 days and he finally got the answer to daniel 17 weeks that was not that was a time of consecration he had to seek the lord to understand the scripture john on the isle of patmos he had to be banned out there all by himself no home church out there there was only broods of dens of literal vipers and snakes he didn't have a home church out there but that's when god revealed the book of revelation to him remember jeremiah they're going to go back but they've got to seek god with all that they have what would that look like for you well you still got to go to work so while you're at work you'll be working and then in your little breaks you'd pray or you listen to a sermon or read your bible what would it look like for you to see god with all your heart what it looks like for me every move every waking moment we want to be in the word in prayer in fellowship yeah we got to take care of business but lord that's right i'll send a timer lord give me 10 minutes i'll email these people back and then i'll get back to the word i got to limit it right because i know my time is most valuable nothing's more valuable than time so i gotta limit this get this business done and then get right back to seeking god amen so church we gotta build up our faith the bible says beloved build up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost when was the last time you had a real good prayer meeting to build up your faith brother jess i'm struggling i'm struggling with this or that yes so am i sometimes so what do we need a prayer meeting to build up our faith and the most powerful one jesus says is praying in your closet because he says if you do that i'll reward you openly amen and then i love this keep yourselves in the love of god jerry amen keep yourself in charge keep hoping in god keep believing god amen looking for what the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life and if some have compassion making a difference and others say with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garments spotted by the flesh hallelujah now church let's remember how good god is remember the parable the talent god said so this is the parable of the 11th hour worker sorry he says is it not lawful for me to do what i will with my own is thine i to evil because i'm good so god's going to have some people work 12 hours and other people one hour and they all get the same reward yeah isn't god good either way yeah i worked a 12-hour day i got paid this much money i worked in one hour a day i got the same amount of money oh we'd all like to be the one-hour worker not all that suffering now that heat of the day but that's what god says aren't i aren't i good didn't i keep my promise doesn't god keep his promise to you church amen hallelujah god keeps his promise but he's got a different plan for every life a different will a different testimony but rather than a different ring to every life in whom also we obtain an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ get your bibles here uh children it's going to be like a order trophy let's read these lydia romans 8 28 malachi deuteronomy 6 24. nature yeah and she was like choose me choose me i love that deuteronomy nature of deuteronomy age 16 and then haven deuteronomy 10 13. all these verses show that god works every event for your good every time amen always god always works out every event no matter the suffering or the trial god always works it out for your good hallelujah i put this in my book i hope i never forget this by god's grace romans 8 28. thank you all things work together for good malachi deuteronomy 6 24 please and the lord commanded us to do all these statutes to fear the lord our god for our good always that he might preserve us alive as it is at this day the commandments are for your good always ever say always ready the commandments if you keep god's commands like worship with joy pray get the spirit amen wait on the lord it will always be for your good amen amen it will work out for the good of your life uh nature deuteronomy 8 16 hun whenever you're ready great great job so god humbles us so our ending will be better so the latter end is better sound from there like you ready from jeremiah i have an expected end for you i have a testimony you're going to accomplish towards the end but you've got to be humble but i'm going to bring you to the the good at the end praise god hallelujah and then uh haven deuteronomy uh 10 13 to keep the commandments of the lord and the statutes which i command this day for thy good for thy name will you keep the commandments i've given you for your good see every event for your good always amen amen the church said hallelujah oh they all all the scriptures are saying the same god is always working out everything for your good even wendy out of heart trouble right brother joseph even in heart trouble yes god works it out so you can testify to the doctor amen god's got a place for good doctors brother amen absolutely god's got a will god has a purpose remember jail time was important for paul not just to write the bible so that everybody in jail in philippians 1 knew that paul was a christian amen and that strengthened some creatures it made them firing more excited to preach them god's word our prophets in prison but he's keeping the word of god others ones it discouraged so those are the ones that had to grow in their faith they were they were immature christians but the mature ones glory he's standing he hasn't he hasn't recanted amen i don't know he's keeping the faith hallelujah he's earnestly contending for the faith that was delivered to him i hope jose likes these ones church if if you want to know god's will you've got to set sign or time apart to know god's will and i thought of just while driving to church i thought of three examples from brother branson's ministry first he didn't know why he was having visions he would tell us pastor can you imagine combating if you were having miracles and you came to me and said what do you think and i said it's the devil that's a brother random experience yeah roy davis told him these visions and miracles that's the devil because they've never seen him before so brother branham went to seek the lord in the cave and the angel visited him yeah he actually told his wife before he went he said honey i may not come back i'm going to wait there i'll die yes unless god comes and answers my prayer now that's sincere right there yeah so see how god has to bring us to desperation sometimes now i'm going to finish the quote brother i told the angel i've been told that those visions was wrong and he the angel lord amen the angel the angel referred me to what scripture what am i referring to you the scripture amen god works everything for your good always amen so if you ever need to know god's will the angel the angel of the lord angel the covenant the holy spirit will direct you to the word amen angel how do i know these visions are of god go look at nathanael god gave jesus a vision about nathaniel i saw you while you're under the tree oh discernment oh yes scriptural yeah yeah my life is scriptural it's not the devil it's the holy spirit amen amen i don't know because i can prove it by the word of god and the woman at the well i don't know brother says the angels are always scriptural they said you still got paul said you still got to test them but i have a word though yes thank god so there's two then he gives him a third one where jesus says a little while the word will see me no more but i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world in other words people are gonna keep having visions until the end of the world so it's okay brother man that you have visions because it's scriptural and they're going to keep happening to the end of the world because i'm always with you amen then brother said then i could leave there and i could rejoice and he could stand against the preachers because he had scripture to stand on yeah what'd it take it took a time to seek god we had to shut away and seek the lord and like i told brother mj maybe listen i said you don't skip church when you do that you still come to church because if not you're outside of the plan of god you're disobeying the word of god so you've got to seek god between the services or before after your choice amen but don't don't skip church praise god that's when that was going to really attack you yeah now the second one was after mother and started preaching he went to mishawaka michigan and he saw one man speak in tongues the next man interpret and they saw a vision this man was a good man but this man divorced his wife and was living with another one yeah it was an adulteress yeah i thought i was among angels i realized there's devils around here right yeah so he said i i don't understand this i've got to go out he went to the cave went to greens mill cave praying he come out of the cave and his bible down and the sunlight was there and he said uh i just laid the bible down and started and the wind blowed over to hebrews chapter six don't you love how god uses the nature hallelujah i thought maybe the lord wants me to read that hallelujah the wind blew me right to hebrews chapter six oh glory he said when i read it oh well praise the lord turn around another one i thought well i'll just read somewhere else laid it down wipe my eyes the wind blowed it back to hebrews 6. then it happened three or four times as many as three anyhow i thought i don't see nothing wrong with that what's in there now you know the story he read it and then he saw a vision right he saw a vision of one man playing depending good seeds and then a man in black point planting the bad seeds in other words he saw a vision of the wheat and the tears the tares are right amongst the wheat but how do we know by their fruits you know them amen by their love their joy their peace their long suffering by their life and what they express in their life that's how you know their praise god that's how you know you are we today praise god when you obey the word of god and the love of god and humility flows out of your life not arrogance not pride not selfishness with the fruits of the holy spirit i must read that the holy spirit now for us it might be brother jesse keeps preaching on that maybe i need to understand that better right when the guest preachers come in they just preach the same thing i must need to understand that yeah the third time was when he preached the seals he said the land there's my 45 minutes okay he said the lamb is standing tonight as we enter in the sixth chapter he's got his book in his hand he's starting to reveal it and oh i would have absolutely i hope that people are spiritual i would have had a horrible mistake on that first seal if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock today when the holy spirit came in the room and corrected me on something that i was writing down to say where did god reveal these things to him when he was seeking god all on his own when he got in the spirit amen when he got in the spirit the spirit came down and showed him things that were to me praise god showed him and answered him all the questions in his life didn't have you know these were major junctions of his ministry that first one was before he even went out on the evangelistic field before the first poll the second one was a part of the first and second poll and now here's the third poll the opening of the word amen i was taking it from an old context i had nothing on it i don't know what the second seal is no more than nothing but i take out some old texts or context of something i wrote on several years ago and i wrote it down i gathered this context and dr smith many great outstanding teachers i gathered all them believed that so i wrote it down and i was fixing to say well now i'll study from that standpoint and there about 12 o'clock in the day the holy spirit just swept right down to the room and the whole thing opened up to me and there it was oh the first seal being opened see it's in this time church when we're desperate when we're seeking god when we make extra time to seek the face of god that's what god will reveal things to us amen we got to get in the spirit that's why i told uh oh i can say this uh that's why i told virtue you know she was coming for the holy ghost so many times that's beautiful virtue that's why i said go talk to your mom or your grandma about receiving the holy ghost because i know how i got it it took me two or three years there was times i had my own prayer meetings up in my little closet of a college dorm room you know it was so tiny it wasn't even like it was just like a triangle type of room you know triangular pyramid or something like that i would just have my own prayer meetings and call to god say fill me with the holy ghost i'm expecting angels i'd wait and see if angels would come in the room does he virtue you got a hunger thirst for righteousness right it's a beautiful thing that you're desiring all those children who want to be filled with the holy ghost that's a beautiful thing right but it's in these times of seeking god one on one seeking god with all your heart soul mind and strength it's in those times where brotherhood says the real person the real character comes out in your heart that's getting in the spirit and then just a few months later that's when i got the holy ghost praise god by god's grace but it was two or three years of learning how to understand a christian and and do what's right and learn the scriptures and then seek god and to seek god myself see so many people want somebody else to give the holy ghost instead to god are they trusting the preacher they're trusting the mom or their dad or something like that only jesus gives jesus the one that baptized him with the holy ghost amen well the same thing only jesus can answer the questions of our hearts he says i'm just as positive as i'm standing right here tonight this is the gospel truth i'm going to tell you i just know it is because it's a revelation because if it's a revelation contrary to the word then it isn't revelation and you know there's some of this stuff can look absolutely true and yet it isn't see it looks like it is but it isn't all right let me close with this uh let's head to our feet musicians can come here okay let me just close with this thought um it's right here this is from another server but i just want to close with this one we're all familiar with this but if we want to know the will of god for any promise of god we have got to seek god the bible said acts 17 the bereans were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so the bible gives them a royalty designation that's not natural royalty that's spiritual role in other words people that will be kings and queens in heaven nature seek god now every day praise god amen that's the proof that their spiritual royalty because they're interested in spiritual things [Music] thank hallelujah amen that's god god is calling these people spiritual kings because they take what paul said they make sure well where did paul say that in the bible okay yes they're taking time away from hopefully hopefully i'll say like this hopefully they're spending that time with their families seeking the scriptures because we don't want to rob our children of their our time together right we don't want to rob them anything we are clearly given the formula for finding any promise of god is by seeking god searching the scriptures daily that's why let me bring this up i just can't stop here just one more help me lord stop that's why this is what the message people put up these are five full people this was years ago and as soon as i saw this i'm like this is this is clearly wrong they said just say amen this is a preacher's wife a very famous preacher's wife she posted this on facebook and i was like what screenshot that's wrong i'm going to say that for later just say amen to every word of the message in other words just say amen to everything brother branham said don't doubt or question it it's that simple i thank god for choosing me to see the light of this day now that sounds all positive but that is actually worship of a man then the bible just say who are the noble ones the ones that believe everything and don't go search it or the ones that search it by the bible they're both prophets paul and brother are both prophets which ones are the real believers the noble ones are the ones who take every day and remember what was preached and they go look at it in the bible the next day i'm not going to ask you to raise your hands because sometimes i forget what the preacher said the next day but some of them are like red letter days like i always remember when simon preaches certain things and can't read certain things i always remember similar services brother brian hawkins god just it's like god just steps down shows us exactly what we need you see church you have got to find you and i have have to find a way to do this we have got to see god every day search the scriptures every single day for answers to your questions that that's what makes you a spiritual king that's what makes you a spiritual priest because you want to see god every single day you want to know what god wants from my monday what does god want for my tuesday my wednesday my thursday we cannot hear the word and then do nothing with it we have to hear the word and act upon it and then we'll know the will of god for every promise of god how many want to be noble christians praise god let's bow our heads the secret is seeking the face of god having joined the midst of trials knowing that god allows these things in his wisdom to come to pass hallelujah i think i preached over an hour so lord have mercy on me i love you church i love your love for the lord jesus christ i love you with christian brotherly love appreciate you listening so intently we want to be noble christians so we have to do what noble christians do they search the scriptures every day now for you church it might i know moms are busy with kids and grandmas and things dads have a little bit more free time they get to travel and go to work and things but for you it might just be listening to a sermon every day and really listening intently if you care but each of us have to every day seek god that's what makes us noble spiritual kings and priests unto god that's what makes us the royalty of heaven we were the beggars now we're royalty the song says hallelujah kings and priests as we pray church let's be grateful that god will work out everything for our good heavenly father we thank you for the word of god today i'm just trying to file your leading lord i waited last night just wondering which direction to go this morning i finally felt lord as i was praying here at the altar i finally felt this was the way to go so thank you thank you for having patience on me dear god lord i just pray you bless your people help your people today lord we all have questions like brother man said wonder why things happen we wonder but i pray lord the word of god today fell on good ground hallelujah that will remember everything you allow is for our good always hallelujah then lord i pray also that we will seek your face every day search the scriptures daily hallelujah not to be deceived and not be idolaters and not be lazy christians but be wise virgins redeeming the time because the days are evil bless us with that anointing to seek your face every single day hallelujah because when we seek you we shall find you because we search for you with all of our hearts thank you lord bless your feet
