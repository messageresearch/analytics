[0:00] U this is a thought that came to me
[0:02] while I was reading through the book of
[0:03] Jeremiah got through that and now I'm
[0:04] going through the book of Hosea by God's
[0:07] grace but I just came across a numerous
[0:08] string of
[0:09] scriptures um I'll get to those here as
[0:12] we preach the word of God today
[0:13] Hallelujah 2 Timothy
[0:17] 2:19 i' like to preach on the Lord
[0:19] knoweth them that are his Hallelujah
[0:23] second Timothy 219 praise God the Lord
[0:25] knoweth them that are his
[0:41] now just remembering now yeah I preached
[0:42] on verse 26 not long ago about the
[0:44] snares of the devil so this isn't that
[0:46] same type of context here uh Paul's
[0:48] dealing in his final letter he wrote
[0:50] before he was martyred he's helping uh
[0:53] young Pastor Timothy here understand the
[0:55] ways of the Lord hallelujah verse 19
[0:58] nevertheless the foundation of God stand
[1:00] sure having this seal so God's seal has
[1:02] a two-fold seal a two-fold attribute to
[1:05] it God has when a person is sealed by
[1:07] the Holy Ghost they have these two
[1:08] attributes by God's grace the first is
[1:11] the Lord knoweth them that are his
[1:14] that's the first attribute the second is
[1:17] and let everyone that nameth the name of
[1:19] Christ depart from iniquity we see in
[1:22] brother brandom's life we see it in
[1:24] Paul's life we see in Peter's life
[1:26] anyone who's born again will quickly
[1:28] leave iniquity by by God's grace how be
[1:31] thankful for that today Hallelujah I'm
[1:32] going to read verse 20 and then we'll
[1:33] all read 21 I'm going to read 20 but in
[1:36] a great house there are not only vessels
[1:37] of gold and of silver but also of wood
[1:39] and of Earth there's the four types of
[1:42] vessels it's also the four types of
[1:44] Believers we'd say or three Believers
[1:45] and four classes however you want to say
[1:47] that uh Jesus talked about those four
[1:49] grounds there they are found that years
[1:51] ago uh by God's grace and some to honor
[1:53] and some to dishonor so we know an
[1:55] honorable life will depart from iniquity
[1:58] sins you know are wrong if you are truly
[2:00] sealed by God you'll leave those sins
[2:02] amen hallelujah amen uh and then a child
[2:05] of God will be a a vessel of Honor by
[2:07] their Works they'll be an honor to God
[2:09] hallelujah we know that because that's
[2:11] what that's what a vessel is for a
[2:12] vessel is to do work a vessel has a
[2:14] purpose a vessel is to be filled how
[2:16] many had some uh coffee this morning
[2:18] that's a good vessel right that's I
[2:20] thank God for that vessel some of you
[2:21] might have had milk or whatever you had
[2:23] if you had a drink of water it's a
[2:25] vessel thank God there was a vessel
[2:26] there it was for God's honor Hallelujah
[2:29] so that's what God liens us unto or
[2:31] vessels of Honor now let's read verse 21
[2:33] if again 1 2 3 if a man therefore Purge
[2:37] himself from these he shall be a vessel
[2:40] unto honor Sanctified and meat for the
[2:43] Master's use and prepared unto every
[2:47] good work I don't know if my my wife
[2:48] remembers that but that was our verse
[2:50] when we got married we had a little
[2:52] verse there our prayer was that we would
[2:53] be Sanctified in meet for the Master's
[2:55] use little did we know we'd be just
[2:57] pastoring a few years after that we got
[2:59] married three years after we'd be
[3:00] pastoring I didn't know what I was
[3:01] getting into Hallelujah but God is good
[3:04] let's have one more word of prayer if
[3:05] you have a need on your heart let's make
[3:06] it known unto God father God we thank
[3:07] you for today Lord we read your word
[3:10] Lord now we just ask that the great holy
[3:12] spirit thank you God for leaving us the
[3:14] spirit Lord Lord Jesus you said it's
[3:15] better that you go away because the
[3:17] spirit would come and guide us into all
[3:19] truth Lord we recognize it's we're in a
[3:21] better condition Lord that the Holy
[3:23] Ghost is here hallelujah thank you Lord
[3:25] God let your spirit flow through US Lord
[3:27] may it anoint our thoughts Lord our
[3:29] words Lord Jesus May these scriptures
[3:30] bring life to the believer as your
[3:33] Prophet said there's nowhere uh there's
[3:35] no way else to be pepped up except by
[3:37] the preaching of the word the receiving
[3:38] of the word so Lord give us Grace today
[3:41] give us strength by the Holy Ghost Lord
[3:43] meet every need Lord God help us to be
[3:45] vessels of Honor Lord and depart from
[3:47] any work of iniquity father God surely
[3:49] we all want to say that I have the Seal
[3:51] of God on me the Lord knows me and I've
[3:53] departed from all iniquity so God how we
[3:56] want that how we desire that in our
[3:57] hearts and lives so bless this service
[3:58] today in the name of Jesus Christ and I
[4:01] ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the
[4:03] Saints said amen God bless you to being
[4:05] seated praise
[4:08] God
[4:12] hallelujah hallelujah so thank you again
[4:14] everybody for their patience on
[4:15] Wednesday you know we got here and I
[4:16] started cleaning up and then I realized
[4:18] oh there's no water the water froze up
[4:19] and uh thanks for dealing with that and
[4:22] being flexible and uh going to the the
[4:24] live stream there I trust that was a
[4:26] blessing by God's grace looking at
[4:27] marriage and divorce again as always if
[4:29] you have any questions about marriage
[4:30] and divorce or where I stand on certain
[4:31] things you're more than welcome to do
[4:33] that uh ask me uh February 9th remember
[4:35] we'll start back up two Services there
[4:38] we'll probably do a little B study on
[4:39] water baptism genev feeling Pole to be
[4:42] baptized uh by God's grace so she's
[4:45] asked about it for several months in a
[4:46] row so that will probably be one of our
[4:47] topics there and uh she just says I want
[4:50] to be saved Daddy I want to I W to I
[4:52] want to be baptized I said okay then you
[4:54] got to understand it now got to
[4:56] understand it so we're thankful for the
[4:58] grace of God hallelujah so let's look at
[5:00] this here the Lord knoweth them that are
[5:02] his as I said I was reading in uh um
[5:05] Jeremiah and a lot of these scriptures
[5:06] came out to me as quite uh wonderful and
[5:09] so I'm going to deal with that here
[5:10] today by the grace of the Lord
[5:13] hallelujah so we know the heart is uh
[5:15] deceitfully Wicked above all things
[5:17] that's what Jeremiah says as a sinner
[5:20] your heart is deceitfully wicked above
[5:23] all things I'm actually I don't have
[5:24] that one down let me look it up so if
[5:25] you would take your Bibles let's go to
[5:27] Jeremiah
[5:43] maybe
[5:45] it's 179 thank you sir thank you all
[5:48] right great job Casi beat me there
[5:49] wonderful job a see I was looking I
[5:51] typed in deceitfully it wasn't coming up
[5:53] so it doesn't have a l y on
[5:54] there uh the Bible says through the
[5:57] prophet the heart is deceitful above all
[6:00] things uh and desperately wicked who can
[6:03] know it now friends I wish this was O
[6:06] only true before we were
[6:08] Christians so what's this speaking of
[6:10] this is speaking of the human Spirit and
[6:12] the sin nature right if it's speaking of
[6:14] a heart we know it's not the physical
[6:15] heart it's the spiritual part of the
[6:18] person right because we're all physical
[6:20] and spiritual you and I see the physical
[6:23] inside is an invisible spiritual thing
[6:26] Hallelujah and so it's deceitfully
[6:28] wicked Above All Things who can know it
[6:30] remember Paul penned those beautiful
[6:32] words in 2 Corinthians I'm sorry 1
[6:33] Corinthians 15 I Must Die daily
[6:36] Hallelujah so what do we got to die we
[6:37] have to uh daily die to the desperately
[6:40] wicked condition of our human Minds if
[6:43] we don't renew our minds every single
[6:46] day we will do some deceitfully Wicked
[6:49] and awful things you don't have to say
[6:51] Amen you could just say ouch right
[6:54] because we all I I'd say ouch too
[6:57] because there's things I do I know it
[6:58] doesn't please the Lord and I'm like
[7:00] where did that come from well I let
[7:01] myself get out of the spirit and brother
[7:04] R talked about it too remember his head
[7:05] spinning around with all the stress of
[7:07] being sued by the IRS and and then he
[7:09] lies to his wife and he's got to go back
[7:10] and make it right every believer knows
[7:12] about this right even Peter wouldn't eat
[7:14] with the the the Gentiles just
[7:17] discriminatory sin you know uh thinking
[7:19] he's better or something because of fear
[7:21] he's thinking he's better than the
[7:22] Gentiles and Paul's got to come up and
[7:24] correct him but here we see this truth
[7:25] that Jeremiah lays out so beautifully
[7:27] it's deceitfully wicked Above All Things
[7:29] so I'm going to say the the human mind
[7:31] the sinful human mind is deceitfully
[7:33] wicked Above All Things plus the sinful
[7:36] nature in our flesh the Bible says
[7:38] hallelujah Paul said there's no good
[7:40] thing that dwelleth in me not in my
[7:41] flesh and he's talking about not in this
[7:42] human spirit either remember he said
[7:44] I've got to serve God with my mind I've
[7:46] got to bring my mind into subjection to
[7:48] the word of God hallelujah so we're
[7:51] thankful for uh this scripture here in
[7:53] Jeremiah we see how it uh so easily
[7:56] applies to our lives and we must be
[7:58] careful to constantly look look at our
[8:00] hearts Hallelujah now I'd like to go to
[8:02] uh Ezekiel 36 let's go to Ezekiel
[8:05] 36 here's the Glorious three-step
[8:07] process of the three works of Grace I
[8:10] have loved this Revelation you know over
[8:11] the years I've had many people attack me
[8:12] and say there's no three works of Grace
[8:14] there's three there's not three works of
[8:16] Grace in The Bible and I just said well
[8:17] you just haven't read your Bible enough
[8:19] it's all throughout there praise God
[8:20] it's all I have a list I have a chart in
[8:21] my 2021 book there's about 10 or 11 uh
[8:25] scriptures with three stages to being
[8:27] baptized with the Holy Ghost it's all
[8:29] through the entire Bible but here it
[8:31] plainly sets it out in uh Ezekiel
[8:34] 3626 now the issue around the message is
[8:37] most people think they have the Holy
[8:38] Ghost in the soul when they don't
[8:41] Hallelujah that's the issue and that's
[8:42] where we got to because people can hang
[8:44] around for years I've seen they've hung
[8:45] around 40 years uh and be some of the
[8:48] biggest tithe payers be song leaders uh
[8:52] you know preachers and then they can
[8:54] turn on a drop of a hat right because it
[8:57] proves they were never born again again
[9:00] they didn't let Jesus all the way in
[9:01] because the heart is deceitfully wicked
[9:03] Above All Things Hallelujah the heart
[9:06] will deceive them their thinking will
[9:07] deceive them of course they let Satan
[9:10] anoint them to deceive them right but
[9:12] that's where we got to make sure that's
[9:14] why uh we always make our calling and
[9:15] election sure praise God Peter says that
[9:18] Peter of all people make your calling
[9:20] and election sure Hallelujah is that
[9:22] right so here we see the three stages of
[9:24] Grace a new heart also will I give you
[9:27] now notice where's the heart got to come
[9:28] from it's got to come from from God it's
[9:30] not in you to have a new heart God's got
[9:32] to give it to you and if God's got to
[9:34] give it to you that means you got to ask
[9:36] for it and you got to receive it because
[9:37] he's not going to force his way on
[9:39] anybody you got to say God my heart is
[9:41] deceitfully wicked my thoughts are
[9:43] deceitfully evil they're so wicked give
[9:46] me a new heart
[9:48] hallelujah it's got to come from God
[9:51] hallelujah so we know there's three
[9:53] stages but we also realize uh we need
[9:56] our minds refreshed every single day so
[9:58] this scripture can apply to every single
[10:00] day right so we get good lessons from
[10:02] that just like the statue per man yes
[10:04] yes you get capped off with Charity the
[10:07] baptism H Holy Ghost you get capped off
[10:09] but the rest of those you got to keep
[10:10] adding to it because it's in your human
[10:12] Spirit we got to because we all know
[10:14] there's times we haven't had enough
[10:16] brotherly kindness and yet we might say
[10:17] we're born again we all know there's
[10:20] been times we haven't been patient
[10:21] enough and yet we claim to be born again
[10:24] right Church Hallelujah so see it's it's
[10:26] just it's an understanding that God lays
[10:28] out these stages and for the soul the
[10:31] soul is one seal there's one seal to the
[10:33] Holy Ghost now there's two signs you got
[10:35] it right we just read that there's two
[10:36] signs you got the seal right as we saw
[10:38] in Timothy but then constantly the human
[10:41] Spirit has got to be built up and you
[10:43] must ask God for and you must let God
[10:45] give you it and then you must receive
[10:47] God's new spirit amen the new heart
[10:49] Hallelujah you must receive all those
[10:51] anointings and then if you do that then
[10:53] the Bible says an entrance will be made
[10:55] for you into heaven Hallelujah and if
[10:58] you do those things you'll never fail
[11:01] you'll never fail the Lord you'll never
[11:03] turn away you'll never go reprobated
[11:05] something like that if you do the word
[11:07] of God if you receive the new heart the
[11:09] new spirit then you'll be filled with
[11:10] God's spirit Hallelujah in your soul and
[11:13] it'll keep you it'll keep you in your
[11:15] difficult
[11:16] moments so there's a new heart now
[11:18] that's that's the stage of justification
[11:21] God declares you righteous you repented
[11:23] of all your sins Hallelujah and you're a
[11:25] new Christian right you got a new spirit
[11:28] but you still got to clean out that
[11:29] Spirit right you still got to clean out
[11:31] that house as brother Brian and the Lord
[11:33] led me to preach on by God's grace you
[11:35] still got to clean out that house well
[11:36] now Jesus is in there but now you got to
[11:38] let it get cleaned out and get all the
[11:39] trash out Hallelujah that's a process
[11:42] okay and then he gives you a new spirit
[11:44] okay and the new spirit of course is
[11:46] your habits your way of thinking brother
[11:48] Christian do you have a question
[11:54] brother yes yeah the major sins yes so
[11:57] you get saved you still have bad habits
[11:59] and then the new spirit is you get rid
[12:00] of all those bad habits and then the
[12:02] next verse can you go the next verse
[12:04] then he says then I'll give you and I'll
[12:05] put my spirit within you so that's in
[12:08] the
[12:10] soul yes and then you'll deal with small
[12:12] stuff throughout your whole life but
[12:13] it'll never turn into major big things
[12:16] yes good question give them two claps
[12:17] let's let's get back in that mode there
[12:18] now I'm just kidding go back there I'm
[12:21] sorry
[12:23] sister I'll put a new spirit now look
[12:25] God's Got You got to say God put a new
[12:27] way of thinking in my life
[12:30] first it's God give me a heart to know
[12:31] you give me a heart to love you you get
[12:33] that you get saved but then it's God
[12:35] give me a new spirit give me a new way
[12:37] of thinking give me a new atmosphere
[12:39] that I create around myself and others
[12:41] Hallelujah so before I got my haircut
[12:44] yesterday I did the same thing I prayed
[12:45] and I reached out my hand I said I'm
[12:46] going in there Lord help me to change
[12:48] the atmosphere and as soon as I got in
[12:49] there I said something about this and
[12:51] then I saw a a baby that was um three
[12:55] months premature is still alive and so I
[12:57] was in there in there I was saying
[12:58] praise the Lord Praise the Lord
[12:59] hallelujah God is so good to this the
[13:01] preey the prey still in the the uh the
[13:03] Intensive right but we're just and then
[13:05] pretty soon my barber starts praising
[13:06] God and then the barber that that owns
[13:08] it he says yes God is
[13:10] good see because I I don't want to
[13:12] brought I don't want to be brought under
[13:13] the atmosphere of that so I reach I know
[13:15] I've got a battle so I go in there with
[13:16] my sword drawn Hallelujah and the rest
[13:19] of the time no problem so I'm learning
[13:21] I'm learning to change the atmosphere
[13:22] praise God I just bowed my head and say
[13:24] God help me to change the atmosphere
[13:25] because I know they got you know they
[13:26] got music in there and all kinds of
[13:28] things um but that's where I see it l
[13:30] I've got to renew my spirit before I go
[13:31] in there right because I know here comes
[13:34] a battle here comes a joke here comes uh
[13:36] and help me Lord God help me to create
[13:37] an atmosphere help me to find a time I
[13:40] can mention the name of Jesus and it
[13:42] will change the atmosphere and people
[13:44] recognize God's presence hallelujah amen
[13:48] now look and then he says I will take
[13:49] away the Stony heart now Stony heart is
[13:51] like a rebellious Heart A Heart of Stone
[13:53] right a stone won't move it's supposed
[13:54] to not move it's supposed to have that
[13:57] attribute as a solid that uh it's hard
[13:59] hard to change the uh the shape right
[14:01] and that's how a sinner is it's hard to
[14:03] change their bad habits but God said
[14:05] I'll give you a heart of Flesh
[14:07] Hallelujah I'll give you a heart that's
[14:09] malleable that that's sensitive to the
[14:11] Holy Spirit and I'll give you a heart of
[14:14] Flesh so see most people with if they
[14:16] don't if they don't have a heart of
[14:17] Flesh they got a Stony heart they can't
[14:19] be moved by the Holy Spirit they can't
[14:21] be taught by the Holy Spirit they can't
[14:22] be corrected by the Holy Spirit but
[14:24] thank God if we got a heart of Flesh it
[14:26] can be moved upon it's living hallelujah
[14:28] it's a lie amen it's not a Heart of
[14:30] Stone hallelujah it's a heart of Flesh
[14:32] Hallelujah it can receive the word of
[14:34] God all right next
[14:37] verse he says and then uh I'm sorry
[14:39] verse 27 and I'll put my spirit within
[14:41] you so so a new heart is a little
[14:44] anointing of God's spirit a new spirit
[14:47] is more of God's spirit and then uh the
[14:49] the my spirit is a filling of the Holy
[14:51] Spirit Hallelujah and cause you now here
[14:54] here's what I love it when you when
[14:56] you're baptized in the Holy Ghost it
[14:58] causes you to walk in my statutes and ye
[15:00] shall keep my judgments so people that
[15:03] aren't born again they don't keep all
[15:05] the Commandments and the statutes like
[15:07] they ought to it's glaring obvious in
[15:10] their life they're not they're not lined
[15:11] up their life isn't lined up with living
[15:13] the word of God Amen right there are
[15:15] statutes they don't obey there's
[15:17] attributes up there we see on the
[15:18] statute perfect man they don't manifest
[15:20] it right but a a man or a woman who's
[15:22] got the spirit of God God's spirit just
[15:24] causes you it leads you it empowers you
[15:27] it it leads you into obeying these
[15:29] things Hallelujah that's right amen
[15:32] glory to God we see it plainly here in
[15:34] the scripture what an obvious thing it
[15:36] is here to cause you to walk in my
[15:38] statues now let's go to uh John 7 I'm
[15:40] thinking of brother Chris here I want to
[15:41] lay this in here um brother Chris has
[15:43] been reading the Bible I want to lay in
[15:45] some foundational things here now
[15:46] brother Chris I want you to see this
[15:47] here and the whole church especially the
[15:48] children too John
[15:53] 7:37 John 7:37
[15:59] and I'm saying this um for Chris's sake
[16:01] but also our sake I over 10 years i' you
[16:04] know 18 years of preaching I've been in
[16:06] contact with so many emails so many
[16:07] comments so many phone calls this this
[16:08] week I talked to numerous preachers you
[16:10] know on the phone and one of the biggest
[16:12] problems people have is with the three
[16:14] parts of man and we have three parts we
[16:16] have a body we have a spirit and then we
[16:18] have a soul and so many problems happen
[16:21] people wonder how does this happen it's
[16:23] because God hasn't got down into the
[16:24] soul in other words the people haven't
[16:26] uh fulfilled my spirit like eel 36:27
[16:30] says they might have a new heart they
[16:31] might have a new spirit but they haven't
[16:33] got God's spirit yet so they backslide
[16:36] and then their their new spirit gets
[16:37] corrupted they get living in sin
[16:39] addictions uh they just get they just
[16:42] get sinful by God's grace but this is so
[16:44] important so brother Chris in the Old
[16:46] Testament they could get the Holy Ghost
[16:47] on their flesh they could get it in
[16:49] their mind but they could never get it
[16:50] in their soul because their sins had
[16:52] never been abolished by the blood of
[16:54] Jesus Christ the blood of animals and
[16:56] bulls and goats could only cover over
[16:58] their sin right like this would this
[17:01] would cover over uh the pen right this
[17:03] would cover over but the Pen's still
[17:05] there but now when the blood of Jesus
[17:07] comes it's all gone Hallelujah and
[17:10] that's what we live under praise God
[17:12] hallelujah so now that now that the
[17:14] blood of Jesus Christ has washed away
[17:15] all the sin now God can get down deep
[17:18] into our soul into the third part of our
[17:20] being flesh Spirit Soul all right and
[17:24] here here's where Jesus says it Jesus
[17:25] says it plainly in the last day that
[17:27] great day of the feast Jesus stood and
[17:29] cried saying if any man thirsts let him
[17:31] come unto me and drink notice he cried
[17:33] out he wasn't Whispering on this one if
[17:35] anybody's thirsty come and drink of Me
[17:38] no he cried out if anybody thirst for
[17:40] the spirit of God let him come unto me
[17:42] hallelujah it's a desperate thing
[17:44] hallelujah it's a serious thing most
[17:46] people don't get born again Jesus said
[17:48] few there be that find the narrow road
[17:51] Hallelujah that's right verse
[17:54] 38 he that believeth on me as the
[17:56] scripture has said out of his belly
[17:58] shall shall flow rivers of Living Water
[18:00] Well then people say they're born again
[18:02] and they can't praise God and they can't
[18:04] testify they can't memorize the Bible
[18:06] they they they can't nothing flows out
[18:07] of their mouth except complaints right
[18:09] or or uh uh depression or something like
[18:12] that or criticism or something like that
[18:14] if you got the Holy Ghost Jesus said
[18:16] it'll flow outside of you Hallelujah
[18:18] people will see it amen right glory to
[18:21] God I love that amen church we all go
[18:24] through trials but you understand what
[18:26] I'm saying the spirit of God stirs up in
[18:27] you and it flows out like a river
[18:29] Hallelujah that's right verse
[18:32] 39 but this spake he of the spirit see
[18:36] he was speaking of the Holy Spirit which
[18:38] they that believe on him should receive
[18:39] in the future remember they received it
[18:41] in Acts chapter 2 after Jesus died
[18:44] resurrected and then ascended to
[18:46] Heaven that's right yes sir 10 days yes
[18:49] good brother good see he's got that
[18:50] Bible knowledge that's I was telling you
[18:52] brother Chris I was saying brother Chris
[18:53] you're getting that Bible knowledge
[18:54] right there by God's grace see and then
[18:56] what's next brother Chris Temperance
[18:57] right that's for you Hallelujah
[18:59] Temperance is self-control over all the
[19:01] bodily passions and desires of your
[19:03] flesh so the flesh wants to do that the
[19:05] flesh is craving but you got but they're
[19:07] forbidden Cravings Cravings our B's
[19:10] desire but we got to crucify that and we
[19:12] got to get the anointing of the Holy
[19:13] Ghost for self-control Hallelujah so
[19:17] brother that that is your pathway to the
[19:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost right there
[19:19] that's why I hung it up there by God's
[19:21] grace I love that he says uh for the
[19:24] Holy Ghost was not yet given yet I could
[19:26] take you to many scriptures and say how
[19:28] the the Holy Ghost fell on Saul the Holy
[19:30] Ghost fell on David the Holy Ghost fell
[19:32] on bezel Moses Daniel Daniel was filled
[19:35] with the Holy Ghost Joshua and Caleb had
[19:36] a different Spirit it was the Holy Ghost
[19:38] so what does this mean it just means
[19:40] they couldn't receive it in the soul yet
[19:43] Hallelujah because they the the the
[19:45] blood of Jesus Christ had not been shed
[19:47] yet and the blood of Jesus Christ
[19:49] abolishes and sends away and remits uh
[19:52] uh all sin away and Jesus blood was the
[19:55] payment for the
[19:56] ransom right when when we when we sin
[19:59] the Bible said the wages of sin is death
[20:01] when we sin uh all those sins are
[20:03] recorded and someone's someone's got to
[20:04] pay for those sins thank God we didn't
[20:07] have to pay for when Jesus came and shed
[20:09] his blood he paid the punishment for all
[20:11] that sin Hallelujah he paid our Ransom
[20:14] and now we're free Hallelujah I don't
[20:16] know if you saw that this week but
[20:17] numerous times I've been brought to
[20:18] tears Donald Trump I know he's might not
[20:21] be safe but he signed one think about
[20:23] this he signed one uh executive order
[20:27] and it set free 1,000 500 prisoners that
[20:31] were wrongly in there including a 75y
[20:33] old grandmother who was just praying
[20:35] outside of abortion clinic and was in
[20:37] jail as a hostage to that last
[20:40] regime and I watched video after video
[20:42] probably five or six videos of grown men
[20:44] women crying say my life was taken from
[20:47] me but now I've been pardoned and I
[20:49] couldn't help but think of brother man
[20:50] preaching the sermon pardoned amen and
[20:52] if a natural pardon will produce that in
[20:54] someone's life what will it produce in
[20:56] the spiritual life Hallelujah
[20:59] when you've been forgiven of your
[21:01] natural sins some of us probably should
[21:02] be in jail for some of the things we've
[21:04] done our natural sins but not only we'
[21:06] forgiven that but we've forgiven all of
[21:08] our spiritual sins all of it's been
[21:10] washed away we've come to the fountain
[21:12] filled with blood and we've washed our
[21:13] robes white in the blood of Jesus Christ
[21:16] Hallelujah it'll make a grown man cry
[21:18] it'll make a grown woman cry because
[21:20] they received The Parting love of Jesus
[21:22] Christ
[21:23] blood oh my I wanted to uh make a video
[21:27] maybe I'll share it Wednesday I want to
[21:28] make a video just all of them so you can
[21:29] see right in a
[21:30] row uh it's so heart it's so
[21:32] heartwarming to see the mothers some of
[21:34] these mothers were just uh praying
[21:36] outside of abortion clinic and now
[21:38] they're reunited with their little
[21:39] babies and they're just crying saying oh
[21:41] boo boo or whatever your name is you
[21:42] know goooo boo boo and they couldn't
[21:45] have their babies for all these years
[21:47] because they were unlawfully persecuted
[21:50] but a pardon he said I'm free I just
[21:52] listen this morning she said I'm free
[21:54] I'm Free Church you're free from sin
[21:56] hallelujah amen you're paren by the
[21:59] blood of Jesus
[22:00] Christ his name's way more powerful than
[22:03] any president
[22:04] Hallelujah glory to God it's a name
[22:07] above all names the Lord Jesus Christ
[22:11] Hallelujah so we can see it there it's t
[22:14] here plainly so hope hope you got that I
[22:16] I want all the children to get that too
[22:17] you got to get and our teens here too
[22:19] you got to get a new heart a new spirit
[22:22] and then God's spirit Hallelujah all
[22:25] right
[22:27] now let's uh move here I want to look at
[22:29] this here let's go to acts 1614 it kind
[22:31] of deals with the new heart this is
[22:32] about Lydia I always remember Lydia of
[22:34] course my first
[22:38] born acts 16:14 I just love how it says
[22:42] this about uh Lydia here now in this
[22:46] case it looks like it's taken from God's
[22:48] perspective right and a certain woman
[22:51] named Lydia a seller of purple of the
[22:53] city of thyra which worshiped God heard
[22:55] us whose heart the Lord opened
[22:59] that she attended unto The Words which
[23:01] were spoken of Paul so before this she
[23:04] was just down at the I think they were
[23:05] having prayer down at the river if I'm
[23:06] not mistaken uh she just having prayer
[23:10] and she had a a Stony heart she wasn't
[23:12] saved right maybe she maybe she's a Jew
[23:15] something like that but she was praying
[23:17] she was trying to find God and God sends
[23:19] the prophet and the prophet tells her
[23:21] about Jesus Christ just like brother Ram
[23:23] did for us amen hallelujah and then the
[23:26] Bible said God opened our heart God came
[23:28] down and opened the door of her heart
[23:31] and God gave her a new heart but see God
[23:34] couldn't do that God couldn't force
[23:35] himself upon her so obviously while she
[23:37] was praying she says God she's probably
[23:38] saying God give me more revelation God I
[23:41] want to know you God I see the favors of
[23:43] my life I want a new heart and see when
[23:45] we when we ask God to give us a new
[23:47] heart God will be faithful God will give
[23:49] us a new heart amen H so see that's what
[23:52] if you want to be saved if you want to
[23:54] make sure you're saved make sure you
[23:56] open your your heart to God say God open
[23:58] open my heart and put your heart in
[24:00] there the desires of your
[24:03] heart and then you'll stop chasing the
[24:05] desires of the world right you won't
[24:07] care about the world so much anymore you
[24:08] got to pay your bills but you won't care
[24:10] about that because now you have a new
[24:12] heart you have a heart of Flesh not a
[24:15] Heart of Stone
[24:16] Hallelujah that's
[24:19] right see we got to understand this God
[24:21] said I'll give you a new heart I'll give
[24:23] you a new spirit I'll give you my spirit
[24:25] and then God will open your heart but we
[24:27] really realize God can't force himself
[24:29] so you've got to open your heart how
[24:30] many believe that by God's grace
[24:33] Glory now I want to um look at this here
[24:36] verse I want to go to let's go to Psalm
[24:38] 374 I've used this before it's been a
[24:40] while Psalm
[24:52] 374 what a beautiful scripture this is
[24:54] hallelujah it says Delight thyself also
[24:57] in the Lord in other words make the most
[25:00] delightful part of your life God Amen I
[25:04] hope you look forward to Sunday mornings
[25:05] and Wednesday nights if you don't you
[25:07] got the wrong
[25:09] Delights that's the truth didn't David
[25:12] say David said I set my affection on the
[25:15] house of God hallelujah and what was he
[25:18] a man after whose heart God's heart so
[25:22] you see can you put those scriptures
[25:23] together if you have a heart for God you
[25:25] want to be in God's house amen if you're
[25:27] after God heart you want to go to God's
[25:29] house
[25:31] Hallelujah that's right amen that's why
[25:33] Jesus we saw in Luke 4:16 Jesus always
[25:36] had the custom to go to the synagogue on
[25:37] the Sabbath to go to church when the
[25:39] church doors were open but people make
[25:42] excuses skip church all these kind of
[25:44] things why because they got different
[25:45] Delights they're delighting in different
[25:47] things but we want our Delight to be in
[25:49] Jesus Christ that's right amen delight
[25:52] yourself also in the Lord now what does
[25:55] he do so if you make God your Delight
[25:57] that's your reaction he's going to react
[25:59] back right there's always an opposite
[26:01] equal reaction the laws of uh what's it
[26:04] called the laws of
[26:06] physics right if you make God if you say
[26:09] God open my heart and then God will then
[26:11] give you the desires of your heart
[26:14] Hallelujah now this verse is also used
[26:18] to to show that God will give every
[26:20] person their heart's desire whether good
[26:22] or
[26:23] bad right God will give you a heart's
[26:25] desire because God's not going to force
[26:26] things upon you
[26:29] right he's going to give you what you
[26:30] want uh the Bible said in Romans 1
[26:33] because they did not like to pertain
[26:35] God's knowledge in their mind God gave
[26:37] them over to a reprobate
[26:39] mind Hallelujah so God will just give
[26:41] you over if you won't humble yourself if
[26:43] you won't uh believe God's word if you
[26:44] won't keep God's word in your mind God
[26:46] will just say okay I'm done we went
[26:47] through we went through it on the
[26:48] blasphemy of the Holy Ghost and he'll
[26:49] just give you over to a reprobate mind
[26:52] okay and then you still get what you
[26:54] want right bam still got what he want
[26:56] Judas still got what he wanted that's
[26:58] what they want they don't want to be
[26:59] with God eternally they don't want to
[27:01] obey God's word they don't want to love
[27:03] Jesus they get what they want
[27:05] Hallelujah all right Delight thyself
[27:07] also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee
[27:09] the desire of thy heart so you want to
[27:12] ask God for the desires of from your new
[27:15] heart not your old deceitful heart
[27:18] that's where people get mixed
[27:20] up
[27:21] right like one time there's an
[27:23] individual that said oh God hasn't given
[27:25] me a marriage spouse so I'm I I hate God
[27:28] that was such an awful thing to say now
[27:31] that person is now married but that's
[27:32] what they told me I said you need to
[27:33] repent of that they repented of that and
[27:35] I don't know if it's sincere but that's
[27:36] an example like you got to wait on God
[27:40] right you got to trust God you got to be
[27:43] you got to you just got to know that God
[27:45] is writing my story God's in control
[27:48] Hallelujah if I try to figure it out I
[27:51] know I'm gonna fail having having people
[27:54] learn enough if you try to bring it to
[27:55] pass if you try to figure it out you're
[27:57] going to fail
[27:59] Hallelujah so
[28:01] true now brother Ram say he uses this
[28:03] verse uh regarding
[28:06] balum he said uh now balam was not a
[28:09] true word Prophet because remember he
[28:11] taught false Doctrine brother said what
[28:13] was the difference between Moses and
[28:14] balum the difference was Moses had
[28:16] perfect
[28:18] teaching perfect and what did balam do
[28:21] he taught them to commit fornication
[28:23] 24,000 died but did both have right
[28:26] prophecy yes they were both both
[28:28] prophets they both said thus say the
[28:30] Lord and it came to pass but what did
[28:31] God tell Moses he said find out what
[28:34] they say after they do that after they
[28:36] prophecy prophesy correctly watch where
[28:38] they Lead You amen a true child of God
[28:40] will only lead you to the word of God
[28:42] hallelujah deeper in the word not to
[28:45] compromise and lust of the flesh lust of
[28:47] the eyes pride of life a true servant of
[28:49] God will always point you to Jesus
[28:52] Christ so he was not a true word Prophet
[28:55] for God told him not to go honor BAC
[28:57] with his presence
[28:58] but he sought to go anyway for he was
[29:00] motivated for his Lust For Gold and prge
[29:03] his heart's
[29:05] desire so God let him go the perfect
[29:07] will of God gave way to the permissive
[29:09] will of God because of the heart desire
[29:11] of balam God actually said go ahead
[29:14] after God had already given his perfect
[29:16] will so Bal could have left there and
[29:18] said I've got thus sayith the Lord God
[29:20] said I could go down but what he didn't
[29:21] tell you was that God first said don't
[29:24] go down so see people people might like
[29:27] like like the pastor of brown Tabernacle
[29:30] God might have told him that it's his
[29:31] will to play tapes but there's no way
[29:33] that could be the first will of God
[29:35] because that's not what the Bible
[29:36] teaches Hallelujah I don't doubt that
[29:38] one
[29:39] bit but it can't be the original plan of
[29:43] God because God's original plan is not
[29:45] to press play and Obey Hallelujah God's
[29:48] original plan is to hear the preaching
[29:49] of God's word faith comes by hearing
[29:51] hearing by the word of God and Obey that
[29:53] and then God gives the Holy Ghost to
[29:54] them that obey the word of God
[29:56] hallelujah
[29:58] that's
[29:59] right he says it was balam who was the
[30:03] loser see brother man said God had his
[30:06] way regardless listen church if we take
[30:09] the permissive will of God we're going
[30:10] to lose a lot who's the loser in the
[30:12] situation balum did he get more money
[30:14] yes did he get more popularity yes but
[30:17] what did he eventually lose he lost his
[30:21] soul so the person who chooses the
[30:23] permissive will of God ultimately is
[30:25] going to lose out but if you go with
[30:27] Jesus obey the word of God you're always
[30:29] going to win hallelujah amen praise God
[30:32] you might be martyred like Paul you
[30:34] might be Shipwrecked like Paul you might
[30:35] go through some awful trials but God
[30:37] will be with you he'll never leave you
[30:39] nor forsake you
[30:42] Hallelujah it was balam who was the
[30:44] loser for he bypassed the word of God
[30:46] and today we have that very same thing
[30:48] oh do we brother Brandon yes we do women
[30:50] preachers organization false Doctrine
[30:52] Etc and people worshiping God
[30:54] manifesting in the spirit and going
[30:56] right on as bam did cling that God was
[30:58] spoken to them even when the commission
[31:00] received is opposite of the revealed
[31:02] word that's just like brandom Tabernacle
[31:05] it's they're doing opposite of what the
[31:07] revealed word in Hebrews 10:24 and 25
[31:10] says
[31:12] hallelujah but let's not just look at
[31:14] them let's look at our lives are we
[31:15] obeying the revealed word that's what we
[31:18] got to look at today let's not it's
[31:20] always so easy I can point to them Point
[31:22] let's look at ourselves we're going to
[31:23] get there here by God's grace that's
[31:24] that's where I'm going of course you
[31:25] know prob know where I'm going
[31:28] brother said I will not deny that God
[31:30] spake to them but it was just like when
[31:32] he spake to ba that second time and he
[31:34] knew that God wanted I'm sorry he knew
[31:36] that balam wanted his own heart's desire
[31:38] above the word and God gave it to him
[31:40] yet all the while in the end having his
[31:42] own way see balum got his own way he got
[31:45] what he wanted he got money he got
[31:47] Prestige he got the ability to teach
[31:49] when he wasn't called to teach he was
[31:51] just called to
[31:52] prophesy right he wanted a bigger
[31:54] platform oh don't we all talk about that
[31:56] everybody on social media wants a bigger
[31:58] platform you better be careful so to BM
[32:00] you want a bigger
[32:01] platform do it the right way that's what
[32:03] we're doing buddy right do it the right
[32:06] way Hallelujah do it the right let God
[32:08] grow let let God and if God doesn't grow
[32:10] it praise God anyway Hallelujah then I'm
[32:12] more like Jesus and Paul I'm more
[32:13] rejected at the end of my life than I
[32:14] was at the
[32:15] beginning Hallelujah that's right church
[32:22] amen he knew that balam wanteded his own
[32:24] heart's desire see his heart was
[32:26] deceitfully wicked above all
[32:30] things above the word and God gave it to
[32:32] them so even today God tells folks to go
[32:35] ahead in their own Hearts desires for
[32:36] they have already rejected the word but
[32:38] the will of God will be done
[32:40] regardless other words God knows all
[32:43] these people are going to make these
[32:43] selfish decisions go ahead God's will
[32:45] will still be done you can't stop God
[32:48] hallelujah you can run from people you
[32:50] can run from problems but you cannot run
[32:52] from
[32:53] God if you're a child of God God will
[32:55] come running after you amen he'll spank
[32:58] you and bring you right back to the fold
[33:02] Hallelujah that's right that's right
[33:04] just like the prodigal he'll let you run
[33:06] he'll go but he'll he'll still have
[33:08] Grace in the midst of that he'll give
[33:09] you a new heart amen a new mind amen
[33:12] that's what he got he got a new mind why
[33:13] am I living like this why I I could be
[33:15] better off as a servant my father's
[33:17] house God is merciful even in your
[33:19] deepest darkest places God will send a
[33:21] new heart a new spirit and then he'll
[33:23] give you his Spirit Hallelujah God knows
[33:25] how to do it
[33:31] Glory now let's look at a few more
[33:33] scriptures here by the grace of the Lord
[33:34] I got uh lots of lots of scripture let's
[33:38] go to Psalm 51:10 this is of course
[33:40] after David committed murder and
[33:43] adultery think of that murder and
[33:48] adultery what's his
[33:51] prayer Psalm
[33:53] 51:10 now remember church he just
[33:55] committed murder adultery he hid it for
[33:57] a long time he HIIT it right he thought
[34:00] he could hide it but Church you can't
[34:01] hide your sins somebody's going to
[34:03] eventually come tell you your sins is
[34:05] that right Nathan comes and says you are
[34:08] the
[34:09] man right you can't hide from God God's
[34:12] going to come correct you is that right
[34:14] church and that's what we want if we've
[34:16] sinned against our father we want our
[34:18] father to show us we're wrong amen right
[34:21] what does he say he's murdered he sins
[34:24] he I'm sorry he's murdered he's
[34:25] committed adultery he's hid it from
[34:27] everybody he thought could have a secret
[34:28] sin and then he's exposed and then he
[34:30] falls on his face and he says create in
[34:33] me a clean heart who's got it can you
[34:36] create your clean heart no can I create
[34:38] my clean heart no you have to let God
[34:40] create a clean
[34:43] heart say God come into my heart come
[34:46] into my thinking and give me give me the
[34:48] right thoughts forgive me of all my evil
[34:50] thoughts all my words in this case
[34:52] forgive me a murder forgive me adultery
[34:55] and create something clean in me
[34:57] everybody say uh everybody say uh uh a
[34:59] right Spirit ready right Spirit right
[35:02] Spirit created me a right spirit in
[35:04] other words I know my spirit was wrong
[35:06] but I want it to be right and I can't do
[35:09] it I need God and then remember this is
[35:11] after he's saved this is after he's got
[35:13] the Holy Ghost in his Spirit right he
[35:16] needs a fresh anointing he needs a uh A
[35:19] Renewed mind he needs a transformed mind
[35:22] he's already been anointed he's already
[35:23] slain
[35:24] Goliath he's already expanded the
[35:26] kingdom and fulfilled the whole Kingdom
[35:28] of
[35:29] Israel and he's saying God come into my
[35:31] heart come into my mind come into my
[35:33] spirit and create a clean heart and
[35:36] renew bring back the spirit I used to
[35:39] have remember the Bible said he despised
[35:42] the Commandment of God now some of us we
[35:44] wouldn't say we despise God's word but
[35:46] we would despise God's children
[35:48] sometimes right some of us now some of
[35:52] us might look at the word and we might
[35:53] despise that I can't believe the Bible
[35:55] says that I don't want to do that but it
[35:57] could go either either way or could be
[35:58] your enemy you could despise your enemy
[36:00] despise your boss but see When sin
[36:03] happens it's because we purposely
[36:06] despise the word of God and all it takes
[36:08] is a a humble repentance say God forgive
[36:10] me I'm I've sinned I've sinned against
[36:12] you it's my fault I let my spirit get
[36:15] dirty so created me a clean heart and
[36:17] this is the same word creation from
[36:19] Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created
[36:22] the Heaven and the Earth Hallelujah and
[36:24] what did he do he took his Spirit his
[36:26] Spirit started covering over the Earth
[36:28] right and started bringing up the plans
[36:30] when God called for that's what you say
[36:32] when you say God created me a clean
[36:33] heart say God let your anointing come on
[36:35] me let me feel you let me raise my hands
[36:37] and worship let me praise and create
[36:39] something brand new in my heart
[36:41] hallelujah what I used to have but I
[36:43] don't have anymore because I never would
[36:45] have done those sinful things if I would
[36:47] have had a right a clean heart
[36:51] Hallelujah same Hebrew word for Genesis
[36:53] 1:1 in the beginning God created
[36:59] what a blessing to know this is a man
[37:00] after what a big
[37:02] paycheck this is a man after a worldwide
[37:06] Fame this is a man after God's Own Heart
[37:10] Hallelujah and he knows I've got to set
[37:12] my affection on of the house of God
[37:14] let's pull that up there I think it's 2
[37:19] Samuel I think it's set an
[37:22] affection 2 Chronicles 29 yes 2
[37:25] Chronicles 293
[37:30] I want you to see this how closely
[37:32] related they are you can't say you love
[37:35] God with all your heart soul and mind
[37:36] and not love the house of God it's
[37:40] impossible impossible 2 Chronicles 29:3
[37:43] moreover because I have set my affection
[37:45] to the house of my God see mine it's
[37:47] personal it's my God's house now
[37:50] somebody else's God that's my God that's
[37:52] his house so it means it's mine too
[37:55] Hallelujah Glory he says uh the house of
[37:59] my God the gold for the things I'm sorry
[38:02] that's verse two I'm go down to verse
[38:03] three moreover because I have set my
[38:04] affection to the house of my God I have
[38:06] of my own proper good of gold and silver
[38:08] which I've given to the house of my God
[38:10] over and above all that I prepared for
[38:12] the Holy House Hallelujah now pull up
[38:15] Colossians I believe it's Colossians 3:5
[38:17] set your affection on things above so we
[38:19] got two things to set our affection on
[38:21] and I believe by God's grace if our
[38:23] affections are set on heaven then we'll
[38:25] set our affection on the house of God
[38:27] because judgment begins at the house of
[38:28] God this is where God is going to start
[38:30] deciding listen God's going to come down
[38:32] the roads and say who is the wise virgin
[38:34] who's the foolish virgin he's starting
[38:36] right here hallelujah who's the
[38:38] borderline believer who's the make
[38:40] believer who's the unbeliever he's
[38:41] starting right here in the house of God
[38:48] hallelujah Colossians
[38:54] 3 verse two set your affection on things
[38:57] things above not on things of the earth
[38:59] so we got to we got to learn to love the
[39:01] Heavenly things the Heavenly Promises of
[39:04] God we got to set our affection on
[39:05] Heavenly rewards by God's
[39:08] grace verse four for when Christ who is
[39:11] our life what life do you got I have no
[39:13] other life except the life of Jesus
[39:14] Christ and I only have that life if I
[39:17] let him live through me that's right
[39:19] shall appear who shall I'm sorry then
[39:22] shall ye also appear with him in glory
[39:23] mortified now that means
[39:26] crucified so if you want to set your
[39:28] affection on things above you have to
[39:29] crucify The Temptations of the world
[39:32] mortify Therefore your members which are
[39:34] upon the Earth fornication sexual
[39:36] temptation to com commit sexual sin
[39:38] before you're married you've got to
[39:39] crucify that think about that you've got
[39:41] to nail that to the Cross you got to
[39:43] nail that desire and say you're gonna
[39:45] die I'm gonna
[39:47] live that that's how you set your
[39:49] affection on I in other words I'm going
[39:51] to flee evil and I'm going to obey
[39:53] righteousness
[39:55] Hallelujah uncleanness again that's kind
[39:57] of related there uh I think that's uh
[40:00] Financial living like living it up with
[40:03] wealth inordinate affection that might
[40:05] be homosexuality evil concience and
[40:08] covetousness which is idolatry so
[40:10] coveting after anything is the same as
[40:13] idolatry all right so now you can see
[40:16] that setting our affections we want to
[40:18] set our affections on things of God that
[40:20] is having a heart after the heart of God
[40:24] glory now we see how David did it now
[40:26] brother says this brother man's giving a
[40:28] uh's giving a a prayer call and the
[40:31] eagle stir her nest
[40:34] 1957 he says if you just preach for what
[40:36] money you get out of it shame on you
[40:38] Pastor shame on you I pastored a lot
[40:42] where I didn't take a lot of money right
[40:44] and brother Cam's never taken a penny so
[40:46] that's why I know God will bless and
[40:47] honor him because of my my family size
[40:50] I've got to use some of the ties by
[40:51] God's grace I know uh Paul said that
[40:54] that's what the Bible said they that
[40:55] preach the gospel should live of the
[40:56] Gospel
[40:57] that's the way it's ordained Hallelujah
[41:00] and you just to be popular or just to go
[41:03] to the conventions so see some people
[41:05] are so drawn to Christian conventions
[41:06] brother says and enjoy the blessings and
[41:09] have Fellowship is that all you're a
[41:11] Christian for so one he one he uses
[41:13] money and the other he says big
[41:14] Christian
[41:15] conventions is that all you're a
[41:17] Christian for he says shame on you
[41:19] you're not willing to die to yourself
[41:21] and sacrifice everything you are brother
[41:24] for the cause of Christ then shame on
[41:26] you
[41:27] and raise your hand and say God create
[41:29] within me a clean heart so how does a
[41:32] person get a a clean heart they have to
[41:34] acknowledge to God lord I haven't
[41:36] surrendered everything to you I've got
[41:38] sins in my life that I haven't cleaned
[41:40] out and create in me a clean heart that
[41:43] I can know
[41:44] Christ all right everybody see that God
[41:47] created me a clean heart die to yourself
[41:50] sacrifice everything you
[41:53] are he says will you raise your hand and
[41:55] say God be merciful to me Christ many's
[41:57] put up their hands and we're going to
[41:58] have a word of prayer just in a few
[42:00] minutes
[42:02] Hallelujah all right so we can see that
[42:04] God must create in us a clean heart we
[42:06] must let God do it we must crucify
[42:09] mortify the Deeds of our flesh and the
[42:12] evil thoughts of our mind and then God
[42:14] will give us his thoughts his Spirit uh
[42:17] his heart
[42:21] Glory now I'm going to jump ahead now
[42:23] let let's look I'm going to start going
[42:25] a different um
[42:28] different or yeah let me start getting
[42:30] ready to come down this direction let's
[42:32] go to Jeremiah 22 verse 13 please
[42:34] Jeremiah
[42:35] 223 here's the verses I read over the
[42:37] last few weeks and they just kind of uh
[42:39] stirred up my heart about the
[42:43] heart the Lord knoweth them that are his
[42:46] Jeremiah
[42:51] 22:13 woe unto him that buildeth his
[42:53] house by unrighteousness and his
[42:55] Chambers by wrong that you uses his
[42:57] neighbor service without wages so see if
[43:00] your neighbor helps you out you better
[43:01] pay him and the church
[43:03] said right and giveth him not for his
[43:06] work so the neighbors work for you but
[43:08] Bible said all of us are neighbors right
[43:09] everybody's your
[43:11] neighbor that saith I will build me a
[43:13] wide house and large Chambers and
[43:15] cutteth him out windows and it is sealed
[43:17] with cedar and painted with Vermilion so
[43:19] look all these outstanding
[43:21] decorations and not even paying the
[43:23] people that are helping him shalt thou
[43:25] Reign because thou closest thyself in
[43:28] Cedar in other words because you have a
[43:31] a beautiful home is that going to make
[43:32] you reain is that going to make you give
[43:34] you any Authority with God the answer is
[43:37] no did not thy father eat and drink and
[43:40] do judgment and Justice and then it was
[43:42] well with him so Jeremiah is showing
[43:45] difference between I think it was Josiah
[43:47] and his son if I'm not mistaken I could
[43:48] be wrong on that if you go back early in
[43:50] the
[43:51] chapter so the the or the the good King
[43:55] he did judgment Injustice and then his
[43:58] son was after just outward lavish living
[44:02] uh fancy homes fancy cars we'll say like
[44:04] that big bank accounts uh what do they
[44:07] call it bling what do they call it just
[44:10] after all kinds of fantastic natural
[44:12] things and looking handsome or pretty
[44:15] but God said verse 26 he judged the
[44:18] cause of the poor and needy then it was
[44:22] well with him was not this to know me
[44:26] sayeth the Lord did everybody catch
[44:29] that wasn't this to know me so who wants
[44:32] to know God
[44:34] today here Jeremiah gives this just
[44:36] struck me like
[44:38] wow we can know God by not focusing on
[44:42] the outward Financial blessings of life
[44:44] but focusing on the poor and the needy
[44:47] you can learn to know God by helping
[44:49] others instead of helping
[44:52] yourself
[44:54] Hallelujah I thought my that was
[44:56] beautiful
[44:57] Jeremiah says by the Holy Ghost wasn't
[44:59] this to know me so taking all your time
[45:01] to build up your home or your your
[45:03] future all these things or doing
[45:06] judgment and Justice caring about the
[45:07] needs and Justice and the lives of
[45:09] others he said if you do that if you
[45:11] look to the needs of others he said then
[45:13] you'll know me this is this was given to
[45:16] you so you would know me Hallelujah so
[45:19] what does that teach us we see God's
[45:20] character and those that are hurting we
[45:23] see God's character in the sick and the
[45:25] poor and the needy that's where we can
[45:27] find God's character I'm not talking
[45:29] about people that uh rig the system I'm
[45:31] not talking about those people we all
[45:32] know we all heard of people like that
[45:34] they rig the system they could work but
[45:35] they're just getting unemployment for
[45:36] something like that so sad but there's
[45:39] genuinely people out there that are
[45:41] needy and and that are poor and the
[45:43] Bible says when we minister to them then
[45:45] we actually learn to know
[45:48] God Allelujah it's just not one place in
[45:50] the Bible as you're probably familiar
[45:52] with verse
[45:53] 17 but thine eyes and thine heart are
[45:56] not but for thy covetousness so see it
[45:58] just shows this King's son he was just
[46:00] all about himself what can I get in life
[46:02] what can I do what can I do for me and
[46:04] for to shed innocent blood and for
[46:06] oppression and for violence to do it so
[46:08] Not only was he thinking about himself
[46:09] building up his own house he was killing
[46:11] his denters he was killing anyone that
[46:13] would uh go against him verse 20 I'm
[46:16] sorry verse 18 therefore thus sayi the
[46:18] Lord
[46:19] concerning jeim the son of yep Josiah
[46:22] was Josiah the king of Judah they shall
[46:24] not lament for him saying ah my brother
[46:26] or ah my sister they shall not lament
[46:27] for him saying ah Lord or ah his glory
[46:30] verse 19 he should be buried with the
[46:32] burial of an ass drawn and cast forth
[46:35] beyond the Gates of Jerusalem What a Sad
[46:38] ending to the son of a king a lot of
[46:41] people walk around this message saying
[46:42] I'm a son of the King right I'm a son of
[46:44] the king your life declares whose son
[46:46] you are or daughter is that right but
[46:50] here he says how can you know me he said
[46:52] you can know me by helping the poor and
[46:54] the needy and judging things with just
[46:56] Justice and judgment not taking sides
[46:59] because oh I like this brother I like
[47:01] this sister or I don't like this brother
[47:03] I don't like this sister I'll take sides
[47:04] with somebody else being neutral and
[47:07] just standing with God hallelujah I'm
[47:09] not gonna stand with you I'm not gonna
[47:10] stand with you I'm gonna stand with
[47:11] God's word hallelujah see that's the
[47:14] people that get to know God's character
[47:17] all right now Jeremiah
[47:19] 24:4 these were good I hope you like
[47:21] those by God's grace it's really
[47:22] refreshing like wow that jeim had a
[47:25] chance to know God if he would have just
[47:27] turned away from this covetousness and
[47:29] just looked at the humble needs of
[47:31] people people asking him for help he
[47:34] could have known
[47:39] God verse four again the word Lord came
[47:41] unto me saying thus sayith the Lord the
[47:43] god of Israel like these good figs so
[47:45] will I acknowledge them that are carried
[47:47] away captive so he God gave him a vision
[47:49] of two baskets some had good figs some
[47:50] had bad
[47:52] figs whom I sent out of this place in
[47:54] the land of calans for their good verse
[47:57] six for I will set mine Eyes Upon them
[48:00] for good and I'll bring them again to
[48:02] this land and I'll build them and not
[48:04] pull them down right that happened with
[48:06] zerubabel right Ezra Nehemiah Hallelujah
[48:10] and I'll plant them and not pluck them
[48:11] up now look at verse seven here's what I
[48:13] want to get to and I will give them in
[48:15] heart to know
[48:18] me that I am the
[48:21] Lord Glory see if we want to know God we
[48:25] have to let God give us his heart
[48:27] amen right he said I he said here here's
[48:30] ways you can know my heart serving the
[48:32] needy finding a way to serve the poor to
[48:34] judge things the right way this is a way
[48:35] to know me he said but I'm also I'll
[48:38] give you a heart to know me I will give
[48:41] it to you I'll give you a new heart
[48:43] because people want to stay with their
[48:45] deceitfully wicked Hearts they'd rather
[48:48] have like brother man said they love
[48:49] their sin they love uh whatever sin
[48:52] Pride or lust or whatever it is they
[48:54] love that more than they love the truth
[48:56] of God's word
[48:58] but thankfully God says I'll give you a
[48:59] heart to know me that I am the Lord and
[49:02] they shall be my people hallelujah and I
[49:04] will be their God for they shall return
[49:06] unto me with their whole heart
[49:09] Hallelujah I just want you to these
[49:11] these scriptures are so beautiful to me
[49:13] God set up a way you can know his heart
[49:15] yes set your affection on the house of
[49:17] God help the poor help the needy do
[49:20] justice when there's a problem do the
[49:21] right thing don't take sides
[49:25] Hallelujah and then God Saidi give you a
[49:28] heart to know me if you'll receive it
[49:30] hallelujah what a beautiful
[49:32] promise uh Zechariah
[49:35] 78 Zechariah 78 and the word Lord came
[49:37] unto Zechariah saying verse 9 thus
[49:39] speaketh the Lord of hosts saying
[49:41] execute true judgment and show mercy and
[49:44] compassions every man to his
[49:46] brother verse 10 and oppress not the
[49:49] Widow nor the fatherless The Stranger
[49:52] nor the poor and let none of you imagine
[49:55] evil against his brother in your heart
[49:58] Hallelujah my look at that this is the
[50:01] way to know
[50:03] God we would all I would say who who
[50:05] wants to know God here I hope all the
[50:07] hands would go up this is the way to
[50:10] know God when you see a widow help out a
[50:12] widow if they're a widow indeed right
[50:13] we'll get to that in
[50:15] Thessalonians see someone fatherless or
[50:17] motherless help them out see the
[50:19] stranger help them out help out the poor
[50:22] and don't take evil imaginations in your
[50:25] heart have a Pure Heart pure thoughts
[50:28] toward your sister pure hearts toward
[50:30] your
[50:32] brother verse 11 but they refused to
[50:34] hearken now what happened now watch they
[50:36] pulled away the shoulder and stopped
[50:38] their ears that they should hear right
[50:39] they pulled away their shoulder in other
[50:41] words they're not going to listen
[50:42] anymore see verse 12 what they do they
[50:45] made their own Hearts as an admitted
[50:47] stone that could be a Flint stone which
[50:48] is a hard Stone remember Jesus had a
[50:49] face like a flint it also can mean
[50:51] Diamond they Harden in other words they
[50:53] Harden their heart extremely hard
[50:56] against obeying the word of God lest
[50:58] they should hear the law and the words
[51:00] which the Lord of hosts has sent in his
[51:02] Spirit by the former prophets see they
[51:05] won't listen to what brother Ram said
[51:06] about cutting hair or crossdressing or
[51:09] water baptism or the godhead they won't
[51:11] hear brother brother Rams preaching
[51:12] Bible preaching about that Bible they
[51:15] won't hear that and many times their
[51:16] hearts just become
[51:19] stoned therefore came a great wrath from
[51:21] The Lord of hosts therefore verse 13 it
[51:24] should come to pass that as he cried
[51:26] they would not hear so God would refuse
[51:27] to hear their cries so they cried and I
[51:29] would not hear say the Lord of
[51:30] hosts but I scatter them with a
[51:32] whirlwind among all the nations whom
[51:34] they knew not thus the land was desolate
[51:36] after them that no man passed through
[51:38] nor returned for they laid the pleasant
[51:40] land desolate all
[51:43] right so God you know God through
[51:46] judging things the right way justice
[51:48] among the poor and the needy remember
[51:50] Jesus said in Matthew 25 when you've
[51:52] done it to the least of these my
[51:54] brethren you've done it unto me
[51:58] Hallelujah so we can see it plainly here
[52:01] when we see people through difficult
[52:02] times that's when we've really got to uh
[52:05] open up our hearts we got to go out our
[52:06] way to help somebody by God's grace
[52:09] Hallelujah if you want the heart of God
[52:10] I know you want the heart of God you
[52:12] wouldn't be here if you're done with the
[52:13] heart of God look at Jeremiah 17:10 I'm
[52:16] almost get ready to get to the main po
[52:17] part here Jeremiah 17:10 there's a part
[52:20] in my book uh in the 2021 book where I I
[52:23] call it soul searching
[52:27] remember uh well Jeremiah 17:10 I the
[52:31] Lord search the heart I try the rain
[52:32] even to give every man according to his
[52:34] own ways now see see there it is God's
[52:37] going to give you what you
[52:38] want God went down into balam's heart
[52:41] and had a conversation and baam's like
[52:43] well I'd really like to go to I really
[52:45] like to go to Bao and make this money
[52:46] and God said okay you can do it but God
[52:49] found that sin in his heart God dealt
[52:51] with him and showed him and searched his
[52:53] heart and said this is not right you
[52:55] need to stay I'm giving you thus sayith
[52:56] the Lord but he wanted his own way so
[53:00] God said okay that's as far as God
[53:01] that's as far as he let God search into
[53:03] his heart and life then God left him
[53:07] right let him do what he wanted to
[53:09] do see God's going to give you whatever
[53:12] according to your own ways according to
[53:14] the fruit of his doings then God's going
[53:15] to let all the repercussions come upon
[53:17] you for the actions you
[53:19] chose right uh now for us Revelation 223
[53:23] Revelation 223 I am he which searches
[53:25] the Reigns and hearts and I will give
[53:28] unto every one of you according to your
[53:30] Works remember your Works come from your
[53:33] faith faith comes from your love so if
[53:36] you got perverted love then you won't
[53:37] have the right faith and you do the
[53:38] corrupt fruits corrupt Works
[53:43] Hallelujah so we see that God wants to I
[53:46] love that God wants to walk and many
[53:48] times it happens while we're laying in
[53:49] our beds at night Psalm 4:4 stand in awe
[53:53] and sin not commune with your own heart
[53:55] upon your bed and be still maybe it's
[53:57] your
[53:58] couch but when you're alone at night or
[54:00] you're alone before you go to bed that's
[54:02] when many times God will come down he'll
[54:04] start dealing with you about your life
[54:06] and he does it out of
[54:08] love he wants your night to end well and
[54:10] he wants you to have a good day tomorrow
[54:12] he wants you to obey him he wants you to
[54:14] be a child after the heart of God and so
[54:16] the Bible said he'll walk through with
[54:17] your hearts He he'll open this door that
[54:20] door and he'll just go through all the
[54:21] areas of your life Lord do my is my life
[54:23] lining up with your
[54:25] word right
[54:26] he's the Lord that tries everyone's
[54:29] heart while we're getting ready to rest
[54:32] or maybe got that quiet time in the
[54:33] morning and after a good rest or a hard
[54:35] rest a bad rest No Rest he'll commune
[54:39] with you in your own heart while you're
[54:40] on your bed while you're just sit on
[54:42] your your your your
[54:45] seat see you commune with you talk with
[54:47] him so God came down to baalam and
[54:49] talked with him but baam said no I want
[54:51] the money I want this and God had to
[54:53] leave him but look God came to David and
[54:55] said you've got murder and sin and God
[54:57] said created me a or David said created
[54:59] me a clean heart then take this
[55:02] murderous uh spirit take this adulterous
[55:04] Spirit out of my heart take this
[55:07] attitude that hates the word of God take
[55:09] this out of my heart and create in me a
[55:10] clean heart amen hallelujah and then
[55:13] what God's spirit came back on David
[55:15] Hallelujah because he opened up his
[55:17] heart he he let God commune with him in
[55:21] every door of his heart in every area of
[55:24] his life
[55:27] oh it's
[55:28] beautiful Psalm 77:6 says I call to
[55:31] remembrance my song in the night I
[55:33] commune with my own heart and my spirit
[55:36] made diligent search so see God will
[55:38] come down and he'll you you'll have to
[55:40] spend a few minutes really thinking
[55:42] about your actions and say Lord did I do
[55:46] anything wrong Lord show me if I've done
[55:48] wrong I'll make it right if something's
[55:50] wrong in your
[55:53] life so Jesus Remember the said he
[55:56] stands at everyone's door and knocks so
[55:59] every night when getting ready for bed
[56:00] he comes around and said can I communion
[56:02] with you
[56:03] tonight I like to walk down with the
[56:07] with you into the the deeper parts of
[56:08] your heart and
[56:10] life is everything right in your heart
[56:13] and life is everything lined up to the
[56:15] word of God I'd like to have some
[56:16] communion with you will you open up
[56:18] tonight and how many people just roll
[56:19] over or go to bed or whatever they do or
[56:21] just turn on a
[56:22] video instead of communing with the King
[56:25] of Kings and Lord of lords the god of
[56:28] heaven and
[56:30] earth oh what a what a striking thing
[56:33] what a what a privilege though that
[56:34] he'll come to every heart praise
[56:36] God what an amazing expression of his
[56:39] love that he'll come to your heart he'll
[56:42] come to my heart praise God because he's
[56:46] faithful so notice if you have a pure
[56:48] heart you have pure Works James
[56:51] 1:27 this is just one of always been an
[56:54] ultimate not ultimate but just amazing
[56:56] scripture me pure religion and undefiled
[56:59] before God and our father's is so
[57:00] religion is just acts right so pure
[57:04] works is to visit the fatherless and
[57:07] widows in their Affliction and to keep
[57:08] himself unspotted from the world live
[57:12] nothing like the world right keep all
[57:15] the sin off me I want to be pure I want
[57:16] to be loving I want to be kind I want to
[57:18] be gracious I want to help those who are
[57:19] hurting like Kyla right that's a great
[57:22] testimony want to help go pray for
[57:24] people that's what we should do that
[57:26] should be our heart's desire our heart
[57:28] should be the heart of
[57:30] Christ and as we battle against the
[57:32] deceitfulness and wickedness of our
[57:34] human mind we've got to constantly
[57:36] mortify that cast that down and say Lord
[57:38] create in me a clean heart and then if
[57:41] you got a pure heart this is the kind of
[57:43] life that you want to
[57:44] live
[57:46] Hallelujah so if you want pure works you
[57:49] need a pure heart
[57:53] Hallelujah
[57:54] now so Church I just I'll just kind of
[57:57] summarize it like this we have to
[57:59] constantly daily search our hearts and
[58:01] lives now God wants to do it usually
[58:03] before we go to bed right on your bed
[58:05] could be in the morning
[58:06] too when you're alone you got this
[58:09] quietness of the day the quietness of
[58:10] the night that's when God wants to come
[58:12] down and commune with
[58:14] you and there's going to be times like
[58:17] David there's going to be times after
[58:19] You' made awful mistakes but yet God
[58:21] will still come and commune with you and
[58:23] you all you have to do is say Lord
[58:24] forgive me again I acknowledge my sin
[58:27] David said David said I acknowledge my
[58:28] sin I Repent of it and create in me a
[58:31] clean heart give me a clean heart
[58:33] because I can't create a clean heart
[58:35] myself I can't do it I don't have it
[58:37] within me I need the Holy Spirit to uh
[58:40] anoint me overshadow me like the Earth
[58:42] was overshadowed and all the darkness
[58:44] was vanished and light came in
[58:46] hallelujah praise God the spirit moved
[58:49] above above the the darkness of the
[58:51] earth Lord take the darkness out of my
[58:52] life and let the light of Christ shine
[58:54] into my mind Hallelujah
[58:57] so we're either like that or like Psalm
[59:00] 139 says it's the last two verses I I
[59:04] didn't get a chance to write down Psalm
[59:05] 139 can you pull it up there on the last
[59:07] two
[59:08] verses so you're either in you know
[59:10] sometimes church we make mistakes and
[59:11] God's saying uh you know confess this
[59:15] you got a dirty heart or if you're
[59:17] living right with God then you have
[59:18] verse 23 and
[59:20] 24 when you hear sermons like this you
[59:22] won't just say oh that was for brother
[59:24] so and so that's for sister and so and
[59:25] so you know you'll say no let me see if
[59:27] that's for
[59:28] me because David said now this is David
[59:31] after he's forgiven right 139 he said
[59:33] search me oh God in other words god
[59:35] let's let's talk about my
[59:37] life is my life really pointing people
[59:39] to Jesus Christ do I really have a
[59:41] Christian testimony that's what David's
[59:43] saying search me oh God do I have all
[59:45] these attributes like I should have
[59:48] because that's the life that overcomes
[59:50] the statue of perfect
[59:52] man search me God in other words Lord I
[59:54] am going to take a few moments I'm gonna
[59:56] stay a few minutes after service or I'm
[59:57] gonna come to service a few minutes
[59:59] early or I'm gonna stay up just a few
[1:00:01] extra minutes and Lord let me just go
[1:00:03] through my life and Lord make sure
[1:00:04] everything that in my life is pleasing
[1:00:05] to
[1:00:07] you walk with me through my words did I
[1:00:10] say the right thing did I do the right
[1:00:12] thing search me oh God in other words I
[1:00:14] want I'm inviting you in I'm inviting
[1:00:16] you in to investigate into my life
[1:00:19] what's pleasing what what may not be
[1:00:21] pleasing and I'm letting you show me so
[1:00:24] I can get rid of it
[1:00:26] search me oh God and know my heart and
[1:00:30] know my thoughts see we we think we can
[1:00:33] hide our thoughts from God we can't hide
[1:00:34] our thoughts from God he sees everything
[1:00:36] we're
[1:00:37] thinking so we got to let God and say
[1:00:40] God you know those thoughts I thought
[1:00:41] you know those words I said you know you
[1:00:44] know what my heart feels forgive me of
[1:00:46] that search me now if you're clean
[1:00:49] praise God lord if there's anything I
[1:00:51] did wrong Lord search me and he says and
[1:00:54] see if there be any wicked now David
[1:00:56] knew there was wicked in him that's why
[1:00:58] he confessed his sins right that's why
[1:01:00] he said God created me clean AR but here
[1:01:02] here he's he's at a spot where he's
[1:01:03] actually living true to God he's
[1:01:04] faithful to God and said see if there's
[1:01:07] any evil thing in there and then lead me
[1:01:09] in the right way lead me in the way of
[1:01:11] everlasting lead me in the way of
[1:01:13] eternal life hallelujah what would
[1:01:15] eternal life do it would set its
[1:01:17] affection on the things of God
[1:01:19] hallelujah so see we got two different
[1:01:22] applications where if we're in sin we
[1:01:24] must confess it and invite him in and
[1:01:26] say God created me a CL a clean heart
[1:01:29] but if you're not in sin then you can
[1:01:30] say Lord just search me
[1:01:32] over investigate all my motives and
[1:01:35] objectives and create in me a clean
[1:01:37] heart because I don't want to sin
[1:01:39] against you
[1:01:42] Hallelujah beautiful
[1:01:48] scriptures see if there's any wicked way
[1:01:51] me case you prepare that song search me
[1:01:53] oh God I'm almost done uh Matthew 7
[1:01:56] 21 it's not even noon I usually go to
[1:01:58] noon all right glory to God at
[1:02:04] 7:21 so this scripture is going to tie
[1:02:06] in with our text our text was 2 Timothy
[1:02:08] 2
[1:02:16] 192021 this be a good one for brother
[1:02:18] Chris here uh as he's freshly looking at
[1:02:21] the scriptures Again by God's grace
[1:02:23] Matthew 7:21 not everyone that saith un
[1:02:25] to me Lord Lord shall enter into the
[1:02:27] kingdom of
[1:02:29] heaven but he that doeth the will of My
[1:02:32] Father which is in heaven now when I
[1:02:34] first read this brother Chris I about
[1:02:36] fell out of my chair I was in my dorm
[1:02:37] room in
[1:02:38] akan uh Brown Street it's not even there
[1:02:41] anymore they they tore it down I was
[1:02:43] there and I was like oh my goodness what
[1:02:45] how how is this even
[1:02:47] possible they're saying Lord Lord but
[1:02:50] then there's another verse where Jesus
[1:02:51] says U you you say Lord Lord but you
[1:02:54] don't do the things that I say so we get
[1:02:56] two witnesses of it at least people can
[1:02:59] and then oh third one Matthew 15 Jesus
[1:03:01] said they draw nigh with me or to me
[1:03:03] with their lips but their heart is far
[1:03:04] from me there it is amen hallelujah
[1:03:06] that's there it is yes
[1:03:16] brother yes yes or even selling them out
[1:03:19] like Judas Judas wasn't going to bars
[1:03:21] Judas he was just had he just had a
[1:03:22] thief's heart he just took some of the
[1:03:24] money from the bag but he wasn't out
[1:03:26] with harlots he wasn't out adultery he
[1:03:29] just had those those small little Sins
[1:03:31] Not small big sins in this case yeah
[1:03:33] very good
[1:03:34] brother see in other words people can
[1:03:37] say the right thing but their their
[1:03:38] heart they still have a a dirty heart
[1:03:41] they've lost the clean
[1:03:43] heart so not everyone that says Lord
[1:03:45] Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven
[1:03:46] but he that doeth the will so we have to
[1:03:49] do the will of God if we want to go to
[1:03:50] heaven praise God
[1:03:53] hallelujah now this this is not teaching
[1:03:56] Works salvation but it's teaching if you
[1:03:58] have a clean heart it will produce works
[1:04:00] of gratitude Hallelujah in other words
[1:04:02] I'm not saved by my works but I do works
[1:04:04] out of my gratitude for being
[1:04:06] saved Hallelujah I'm so happy he's
[1:04:08] forgiven me Lord what do you want me to
[1:04:10] do I'm right here praise God fill my
[1:04:13] hands fill my mouth lead my feet you
[1:04:15] know uh just give me what to say I I'll
[1:04:17] do whatever you want I'm your servant
[1:04:18] Hallelujah I'm Your Vessel to honor
[1:04:22] Hallelujah see not everyone that says
[1:04:24] Lord Lord will go enter the kingdom of
[1:04:25] heaven
[1:04:26] but only those who do the will of My
[1:04:28] Father which is in
[1:04:29] heaven Hallelujah now verse 22 many will
[1:04:32] say not a few look at that brother Chris
[1:04:35] many remember at the at the last
[1:04:37] judgment there's going to be uh
[1:04:39] everyone's going to stand before God
[1:04:40] every person down through all history
[1:04:42] Julius Caesar Donald Trump Joe Biden
[1:04:44] Adolf Hitler you name it St Paul we're
[1:04:46] all going to be there and many of them
[1:04:49] are going to try to say many people rise
[1:04:52] up and say Lord Lord have we not
[1:04:54] prophesied in thy name in thy name like
[1:04:56] that's balum balum prophesied in his
[1:04:58] name and in thy name cast out Devils
[1:05:00] that's Judas Judas cast out Devils he
[1:05:02] had all that power and in my name done
[1:05:05] many wonderful
[1:05:06] works right next
[1:05:09] verse and then will I profess unto them
[1:05:12] I never knew
[1:05:14] you depart from me ye that work iniquity
[1:05:18] now leave that up there I've just gone
[1:05:20] over all these verses about how you can
[1:05:21] know
[1:05:23] God but here God said I never knew you
[1:05:27] they thought they knew God but they
[1:05:30] didn't know God and then God is here
[1:05:32] saying I never knew
[1:05:35] you so the the truth of God's word is
[1:05:38] that we've got to know God and God has
[1:05:40] to know us hallelujah amen just like my
[1:05:43] wife she's my wife I know her she knows
[1:05:48] me because we live together we're we're
[1:05:51] on holy wedlock or I'm sorry Holy
[1:05:53] Communion is it holy wedlock yeah
[1:05:56] for uh 21 years yes
[1:05:59] Glory didn't forget the number of years
[1:06:02] but I know her in the only way I know
[1:06:05] any woman my wife Hallelujah and that's
[1:06:08] what Jesus saying here he said you've
[1:06:11] got to know me and I've got to know you
[1:06:13] I just show you how you can know God do
[1:06:16] justice help the poor help the needy
[1:06:18] keep all the sin off you if you do that
[1:06:20] you'll know God Amen Hallelujah but now
[1:06:23] God's saying I don't know you
[1:06:26] and why not because they were workers of
[1:06:28] iniquity iniquity is lawlessness in
[1:06:31] other words it's it's purposefully
[1:06:33] breaking the commands of God brother
[1:06:36] Braham says you you uh uh brother Braham
[1:06:39] says uh you're you're doing what you
[1:06:40] know you shouldn't do I'm kind of
[1:06:43] paraphrasing that I can't get the right
[1:06:44] quote right now I've not been studying
[1:06:46] on
[1:06:47] that that topic lately so in other words
[1:06:50] these worker iniquity so brother what
[1:06:52] what would happen they would do Miracles
[1:06:53] but they would also do iniquity when
[1:06:55] they weren't doing the Miracles and all
[1:06:57] the all these Mega preachers do it today
[1:06:59] oh they might have good Miracles but
[1:07:01] watch what they do afterwards Watch what
[1:07:03] it comes comes in their their personal
[1:07:04] life uh drugs uh prostitutes all these
[1:07:07] things money riches all these and they
[1:07:10] might have real testimonies but Jesus
[1:07:12] will say I never knew
[1:07:14] you
[1:07:16] Hallelujah now what does the Bible say
[1:07:18] the Seal of God we started with it the
[1:07:20] Seal of God is the Lord knows them that
[1:07:22] are his hallelujah amen and see this is
[1:07:26] what God Jesus is going to say at at the
[1:07:28] this is the final judgment I never knew
[1:07:31] you Hallelujah now look at that and this
[1:07:34] is what we preached on a few weeks
[1:07:35] remember I went through some of the
[1:07:36] things that people will say on the day
[1:07:37] of judgment this is one I forgot people
[1:07:39] are going to stand there and say Lord uh
[1:07:42] I did this I did that how could you not
[1:07:44] know me how could you uh uh say depart I
[1:07:48] did this I did that and Jesus is going
[1:07:50] to tell them you did works of iniquity
[1:07:53] you didn't do the right works well we'
[1:07:55] seen this morning the right works are
[1:07:57] Justice judgment helping the poor
[1:08:00] keeping yourself unspotted from the
[1:08:01] world we have the privilege to know but
[1:08:03] they knew too so we better do what God
[1:08:06] called us to do hallelujah amen
[1:08:10] glory oh
[1:08:12] my so we know God fully by doing his
[1:08:17] works not works of iniquity but his
[1:08:19] works and that's because we yield to his
[1:08:22] spirit and let his Spirit work through
[1:08:24] us alah now this no this word no I never
[1:08:28] knew you this word is used 208 times in
[1:08:31] the New Testament it's just simple
[1:08:32] knowledge now it can mean the marriage
[1:08:34] relationship it can mean that but most
[1:08:36] of the time it doesn't so you could use
[1:08:38] that in other words uh I never knew you
[1:08:40] in other words uh you never had an
[1:08:42] intimate relationship with me I was
[1:08:45] never your husband you were always
[1:08:47] chasing after others other uh other
[1:08:50] lovers that's what the Bible said
[1:08:52] brother Chris the Bible said in the end
[1:08:53] days the people be lovers of pleasure
[1:08:55] more than lovers of God second Timothy
[1:08:57] chapter 3 so that's why we got to make
[1:08:59] sure we got to make sure we chase the
[1:09:00] pleasures of God and not the pleasures
[1:09:02] of the
[1:09:03] world
[1:09:06] Hallelujah that's
[1:09:08] right this can also mean to the Jew and
[1:09:10] the and the Lexicon it says to the Jew
[1:09:13] true knowledge or I never knew you true
[1:09:15] knowing is always manifesting itself in
[1:09:18] one's conduct which I believe works well
[1:09:20] with this one because your conducts are
[1:09:22] your Works they're either works of
[1:09:23] obedience or works of iniquity
[1:09:28] in the Jewish life one did not know
[1:09:30] something until the fact had a practical
[1:09:32] outworking in his life in other words
[1:09:35] like today these young people if you ask
[1:09:36] them what's hard work they they'll tell
[1:09:38] you but a lot of them don't even know
[1:09:40] what they're talking about like I've
[1:09:42] seen on on the news uh this what's the
[1:09:45] next what's this current generation is
[1:09:47] it gen Z what is it gen
[1:09:51] Alpha okay I didn't know that that's
[1:09:54] good but they in the last few years they
[1:09:56] just got on the workforce and they're
[1:09:58] like I got to work 40 hours a week I'm
[1:10:02] done I'm like bunch of poor
[1:10:05] babies can I get you a
[1:10:09] bottle right try working 60 hours I
[1:10:11] working 70 hours Cam and Simon have
[1:10:13] worked 80 hours when they got
[1:10:16] emergencies and pipes reading cam just
[1:10:18] worked 14 hours on Friday you and I were
[1:10:20] texting back a pipe
[1:10:22] burst and so see in other words they
[1:10:24] never knew they don't really know they
[1:10:27] can tell you what hard work is but they
[1:10:29] don't they haven't experienced it amen
[1:10:31] and Jesus said I never had an experience
[1:10:32] with you oh thank God if we've had an
[1:10:34] experience with the Holy Ghost today
[1:10:36] Hallelujah Jesus won't say I never knew
[1:10:38] you Jesus said I knew you Hallelujah
[1:10:41] you're mine you're my you're my you're
[1:10:42] my child you're my bride Hallelujah and
[1:10:44] your Works follow your confession
[1:10:47] Hallelujah Glory you won't do the works
[1:10:50] of iniquity you do the works of
[1:10:53] righteousness that's right Church
[1:10:56] now I got some good verses here the
[1:10:58] Bible said in uh Genesis 18- 19 the
[1:11:00] Bible said I'll visit Abraham because I
[1:11:02] know him and he will keep his
[1:11:04] Commandments and he'll command his
[1:11:06] children to do works of righteousness
[1:11:09] God said I know
[1:11:11] Abraham Hallelujah so see God has to
[1:11:14] know us the Lord knows that how do we
[1:11:17] how does he know us we got to open our
[1:11:18] hearts and let him come in and form his
[1:11:20] heart in our hearts put his thoughts in
[1:11:24] our
[1:11:25] mind Hallelujah also would you put up
[1:11:28] Amos 3 verse two this is a beautiful
[1:11:32] scripture Amos
[1:11:35] 3:2 you only have I known of all the
[1:11:38] families now just pause right there
[1:11:39] doesn't God have knowledge of everybody
[1:11:42] doesn't God know about the Babylonians
[1:11:43] and the syrians too doesn't God know
[1:11:45] about of course so this is a different
[1:11:48] no this is a know by
[1:11:50] relationship this is a know by
[1:11:53] Oneness we've have intimacy I've let you
[1:11:56] know the Oracles of God Amen the Angels
[1:11:58] delivered the Oracles of God to Israel
[1:12:02] Hallelujah Thou shalt not Thou shalt not
[1:12:04] Thou shalt not but they also said Thou
[1:12:06] shalt love the Lord thy God with all
[1:12:08] your heart Hallelujah they also had that
[1:12:10] one that's not a negative that's a
[1:12:11] positive amen love the Lord your God
[1:12:13] with all your heart therefore I will
[1:12:15] punish you for all your there it is
[1:12:18] iniquities and see God's faithful if
[1:12:20] you're a child of God you want God to
[1:12:22] punish you if you're wrong Hallelujah
[1:12:25] but notice the word know he said I know
[1:12:28] Abraham I knew
[1:12:30] Israel we we must live a life where God
[1:12:32] can say I know her I know him because
[1:12:36] we've opened up our hearts and let the
[1:12:38] word of God come in Hallelujah so see
[1:12:41] the workers of iniquity in Matthew 7
[1:12:43] they never truly followed
[1:12:46] Jesus they followed his uh they followed
[1:12:50] the the the the the formula for
[1:12:52] miracles right a miracle has a pretty
[1:12:54] simple formul
[1:12:55] get the person to confess their sins and
[1:12:58] then uh ask God to move that's really
[1:12:59] all you got to do is they all you have
[1:13:01] to have is legal rights over that demon
[1:13:04] if that person wants to be free and
[1:13:05] you've got power and authority they can
[1:13:07] be free right there right or prophecy is
[1:13:10] just getting in uh the anointing and
[1:13:11] letting God just speak just God gives
[1:13:13] you a word just like if you had a dream
[1:13:14] and it came to pass it's just that just
[1:13:16] in the channel of
[1:13:17] God but see then the rest of their life
[1:13:20] they spent working iniquity going
[1:13:22] outside of God's word so the the workers
[1:13:25] of iniquity never F him the workers of
[1:13:27] iniquity never did God's will God's
[1:13:30] perfect will for their life
[1:13:33] Hallelujah they did their own selfish
[1:13:35] will because God's will uh was rejected
[1:13:39] in their life he said I never knew you
[1:13:41] Hallelujah now let's look at a few
[1:13:44] verses here uh John 10:14 I'm going to
[1:13:46] get you moving here Cas by God's grace
[1:13:48] John
[1:13:49] 1014 I am the Good Shepherd and I know
[1:13:52] my Sheep amen and I am also known of
[1:13:57] mine see there is this intimacy with
[1:14:00] Christ and his followers I know Jesus
[1:14:03] but thank God Jesus knows me too
[1:14:06] Hallelujah glory to
[1:14:08] God those are the I I've seen YouTube
[1:14:11] videos and thumbnails and some some of
[1:14:13] them will say the the scariest words in
[1:14:15] the
[1:14:15] Bible and where does it always go to it
[1:14:17] goes to Matthew 7 Lord did I not say
[1:14:20] Lord Lord did I not cast out Devils
[1:14:22] didn't I do this for you and he said
[1:14:24] depart from me workers of iniquity I
[1:14:26] never knew
[1:14:28] you now it's scary for them but it's not
[1:14:30] scary for us because God doesn't give us
[1:14:32] the spirit of fear but a power love and
[1:14:36] what a new spirit sound mind
[1:14:41] Hallelujah see that isn't it so
[1:14:43] beautiful God's sheep know the voice of
[1:14:46] the shepherd and the shepherd knows the
[1:14:48] Sheep
[1:14:50] Hallelujah wonderful John repeats it in
[1:14:53] John 10:27
[1:14:58] my sheep hear my voice and I know them
[1:15:01] and they follow me see who see who he
[1:15:03] knows those who follow the word of
[1:15:06] God that's who he knows so that means
[1:15:09] all the rest of those goats never
[1:15:11] followed
[1:15:12] him the goats would come around and eat
[1:15:14] on some of the uh the food of the
[1:15:16] shepherd but then they go run off and do
[1:15:17] their own thing but the Sheep stayed
[1:15:20] with the
[1:15:21] shepherd the Sheep stayed with Jesus
[1:15:23] Christ the revealed word of
[1:15:25] God glory you've been very patient I'm
[1:15:28] trying to close up here by God's
[1:15:31] grace all right now we see it plainly
[1:15:33] there in the scripture and then back to
[1:15:34] our let's go back to our starting verse
[1:15:36] second Timothy 2:19
[1:15:43] Hallelujah second Timothy
[1:15:50] 2:19 nevertheless the foundation of God

[1:16:18] just review as I'm closing if you want a
[1:16:20] clean heart you got to open up your
[1:16:21] heart to God confess any sin and then

[1:16:36] create a clean heart within me that
[1:16:38] loves the word of God that wants to obey
[1:16:40] the word of
[1:16:41] God and manifest the stature of Christ
[1:16:44] I'm going to close with that one second

[1:16:48] looking over there might might be a good
[1:16:50] blessing to you brother let's read
[1:16:51] second Peter chapter 1

[1:18:54] partakers of the divine nature having
[1:18:57] escaped the corruption that's in the
[1:18:58] world through lust so what happened in
[1:19:01] the Garden of Eden it was lust right
[1:19:03] that's how corruption came into the
[1:19:05] world but if we want the divine nature
[1:19:07] if we want all these blessings we got to
[1:19:09] look at the promise of God and accept
[1:19:11] the promise of
[1:19:13] God that's

[1:21:08] self-control Hallelujah where you keep
[1:21:10] your body under subjection right bring

[1:21:22] good or or whatever you want to do uh
[1:21:25] any bodily passions they've got to be
[1:21:27] mortified and uh I preached it a couple
[1:21:29] years ago at K christen's event and one
[1:21:31] of the women come up and said Jesse was
[1:21:32] my favorite speaker but there's only one

[1:21:48] want to be healthy you need an anointing
[1:21:50] to eat the healthy
[1:21:51] foods it's it's an anointing if you want
[1:21:55] to live pure sexually you need the

[1:22:11] there amen that wants to obey the word
[1:22:13] of God that wants to do it so for that

[1:23:27] one before you get the Holy Ghost the
[1:23:29] last thing God gives you before you get
[1:23:30] the Holy Ghost is brotherly kindness so
[1:23:32] you'll treat people in this church like
[1:23:34] a real brother sister
[1:23:36] would Hallelujah a real brother sister
[1:23:40] that's how you know some people lost the
[1:23:41] anointing or never had the
[1:23:43] anointing before God will let you into
[1:23:46] his family with the Holy Ghost he's got
[1:23:47] to make sure you're going to treat his
[1:23:49] family the right
[1:23:50] way Jesus said whatever you treat how

[1:26:40] good answer Paul said why are they
[1:26:42] baptized for the dead then it doesn't
[1:26:44] mean they're baptizing for the dead it's
[1:26:45] referring to Christ why are we baptized
[1:26:47] for the dead they're saying if Christ is
[1:26:49] dead why we baptize for the dead he's
[1:26:52] dead we baptized because he's alive
[1:26:55] Hallelujah if if we're dead if he died
[1:26:58] and raised then we we'll die to our sins
[1:27:01] and we'll raise Hallelujah why would you
[1:27:03] baptize for the dead if we don't raise
[1:27:05] again oh it's
