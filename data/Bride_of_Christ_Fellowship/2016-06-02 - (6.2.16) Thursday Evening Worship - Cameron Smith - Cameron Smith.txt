during our prayer service and things like that they said it you just feel the Lord just come right in there so we appreciate that a man may God for the gifts encounter the privilege and an honor to be here once again yeah several months ago and i'll tell you i just love Jesus and then he's worth all the sack of all all of all the shortcomings all the failures tonight I'll be honest with you I flat out to have two other directions I was thinking I was going to go and trying to be spray fearful as possible this morning maybe this afternoon sometime Lord just kind of brought this tomb that he wanted me to preach this and I pray that'll be a blessing to you it's a little bit different of a thought I thank God that the Lord is established a mystery here for 10 years by the grace of God view certainly kind of a privilege to be able to share with the Lord is placed on our hearts so if we were might while we remain standing if we'd like to move to our Bibles here I preached a series own on this at home and I will not do it justice in one service compared to what the tree like Lord is revealed to change through it but I say I have a greater understanding of these things and what I previously have and I thank God for that if you have your bottles are going to read three portions of Scripture Galatians 5 verse 1 then we're going to go to acts 10 24 and then acts 15 or little bit of reading but today yet we sure love the Word of God don't ya yes sir Galatians 5 1 says here stand fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ have made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage and I are going to deal with one of the the major dissensions in the message of that our let's continue acts 1044 says here the next 10 44 while Peter yet spake these words under yeah the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word Amen yes familiar with the Bible what's he talking about he's talking about Jen's house here and then this is our introduction yeah the Holy Spirit again I was here thank you Lord for that 45th verse it says and they of the circumcision which believe were astonished as many as came with Peter because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God then Peter answered can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as a wee they commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord they then prayed they him to Terry certain days I bet they did acts 15 verse one that will say a word prayer will I have your seats or it says here in certain men which came down from Judea taught the brother and said except he be circumcised after the manner of Moses he cannot be saved a lot of us that our thoughts we say boys this in the Old Testament here it is in the book of Acts let's say a word of Prayer almost precious Lord Jesus Christ how we love you tonight Lord and God is we believe that you've called us here no there's no coincidences with you Lord the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of God or you have certainly set our straight past them for our feet long and or tonight has become before you lord we're longing to hear from you Lord or you don't need the mind of a camp smith you don't need the mind of anyone here Lord you're looking Oh God for us to find your my lord so in that ideal God we submit ourselves unto you O God we say Lord have your way Lord oh god let me not say one word oh my oh god and lord I pray O God in the desire for an expectation for you to preach I pray that the bride and their seats they find that desire that you might preach oh god through the expectation you play through sample I asked o goddess Freyja special movie or skirts tonight oh God we do have a need of you God in such a dark time oh God thank God there is a light it goes Oh God we're a people that are set aside while the sixth seal is breaking oh God and Lord allow us oh god to see the light of this our stress in a way but it's never expressed oh god we just eat your Lord we're thirsting for your word Lord s I trust oh god you'll find all things in the court it's gone the beauty sit in this room God we trailed audience my it from us God forgive us o God oops aside front of them we're all creatures of God that are saved by grace given that verse you did pray for the glory in Jesus Christ's name and the church says and then makes it if we had a title for this evening sermon just something the Lord has brought me to a little thought on I'm going to entitle this message this even coming into the message of the hour and then by the grace of God will make some sense out of this very quickly here brietta in looking at the idea coming into the message of the hour I love that we live in a day where the message of our of the hour has been preached and we know that Noah had a message of his our bows his head a message in his out and what he was always gone since I'm you couldn't put know us that's his phrase our inmost is Damon forgot in a particular message for every one of those days they never but yet they all want it to Christ oh no never see heart that is three level heart safety that they had to get in here then God stay in hoses he gave that lot oh my god Christ when we look at today we gonna dl found a Mexican more interest if not ocean is Roman again looking at the concept God got us to a place that we will see the word for this outside in a book hey Shay tal he look at the fire she's a pillar of fire yes my sister-in-law she painted that picture of brother Graham with the colored barber head and she she could have most of other brands face off and just put the fire on put the pillar of fire on there yeah I look at that I say that right there is a true interpretation 19 hallelujah yeah what by God's face we have found that this is the truth for now they then looking at her title coming into the message of the hour I'd like to get to a different type of a thought uh extremely different for anniversary needs but yet look at the idea you
