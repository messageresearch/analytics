[0:00] David looking at iniquity. I didn't
[0:02] finish it on Sunday, so I'd like to
[0:04] finish it here tonight.
[0:07] Psalm chapter 40:12.
[0:13] As I said, uh my inspiration for this
[0:15] was just kind of reading through the
[0:17] book of Psalm and I just was overwhelmed
[0:20] each time I saw the word iniquity. David
[0:22] said, I'm sorry, there's 60 cases of
[0:24] iniquity just in the book of Psalms.
[0:26] There's 60 verses and a lot of those are
[0:28] about David. I've been through most of
[0:30] them. I got to get through a few more.
[0:32] But it's just to me it's really
[0:33] inspiring to see what he said about his
[0:35] iniquity because that can help us with
[0:38] our iniquity. How many how many believe
[0:39] the Holy Spirit wrote all those songs?
[0:41] Praise God. Amen. It wasn't David's own
[0:43] ideas. The spirit of God uh came into
[0:46] his heart and allowed him to write all
[0:47] these beautiful songs we'd say about uh
[0:50] overcoming iniquity by the power of God.
[0:54] Hallelujah.
[0:56] And at the end, I think I I want to try
[0:57] to share a wonderful testimony a brother
[1:00] shared with me from overseas. It's a
[1:02] pretty awesome testimony, overcoming
[1:04] iniquity. So, I like to share that at
[1:06] the end. Uh by God's grace, I trusted. I
[1:08] asked the brother online, could I share
[1:10] it? He said, "Yes." Uh feel free to
[1:12] share it.
[1:15] So, Psalm 40:12.
[1:19] And as we said on Sunday, have you ever
[1:20] been so discouraged by your own sins
[1:23] that you could hardly lift your head at
[1:25] church or you couldn't even raise your
[1:27] hand at church because you're so
[1:29] discouraged by your own sins? That's how
[1:31] David felt here when he wrote Psalm 40.
[1:38] Verse 12. Let's read verse 12 if we can.
[1:40] Ready? One, two, three. For innumerable
[1:43] evils have compassed me about. Mine
[1:47] iniquities have taken hold upon me, so
[1:51] that I am not able to look up. They are
[1:54] more than the hairs of mine head.
[1:57] Therefore, my heart faileth me. May God
[2:01] add his blessing to the reading of his
[2:02] word. You may be seated.
[2:05] Bless you.
[2:08] So, I'm not going to review too much
[2:09] because I got a whole lot uh I want to
[2:11] get through, but uh we kind of looked at
[2:13] how we don't wrestle against flesh and
[2:15] blood. We looked at Romans 7 uh about
[2:18] the war within us, the war between the
[2:20] the law of the mind, the Bible said, and
[2:22] the the sin in our members, the law of
[2:24] our members, the Bible calls it. And
[2:26] then we saw how Brother Ram said, if you
[2:28] listen to it this week in part four of
[2:30] questions and answers, Brother Random
[2:31] said, "Do the vice versa of whatever sin
[2:34] you're battling, whatever complex, do
[2:37] exactly the opposite of what the flesh
[2:39] or could be a demon tells you to do. Do
[2:41] the exact opposite." Praise God. So
[2:44] hopefully that was helpful uh by the
[2:46] grace of the Lord. Then we looked at,
[2:48] you know, David's iniquities and he lied
[2:50] to the priest. He pretended to be insane
[2:53] uh yet it saved his life. And I thought
[2:54] about that today, how, you know, uh God
[2:57] kind of winked at his ignorance, right?
[2:58] Or God winked at his weakness. Kind of
[3:00] like how God spared Abraham's life when
[3:03] he lied when uh Moses murdered a person,
[3:06] right? We know David, of course, would
[3:07] eventually do that later. Uh but I even
[3:10] thought of how uh wasn't it Rahab that
[3:12] lied to the spies, right? So God uh in
[3:14] our moments of weakness, the angel Lord
[3:16] is going to protect us, right? No matter
[3:18] what, uh sins we do, no matter what
[3:20] failures we commit, right?
[3:22] Transgressions or iniquities,
[3:25] uh if it's not God's time for us to go
[3:27] home, right? Uh and we and something
[3:29] like that, we have to do even a lie or
[3:31] something or pretend to do something,
[3:34] God will forgive us and he'll extend our
[3:36] lives. So I thought that was really
[3:38] beautiful with Rahab there. She's a type
[3:40] of the gentile bride, right? uh getting
[3:42] saved right before the destruction of
[3:44] Jericho. So, it's a type of uh the
[3:46] rapture. So, uh uh we see that in
[3:49] David's life, he lied to the priests and
[3:52] all that. The lie caused uh all these
[3:54] priests to be murdered. Of course, that
[3:56] was all or mostly on Saul there. He
[3:58] pretended to be insane. He committed
[4:00] adultery, then committed uh uh murder,
[4:04] and then he was prideful to the census.
[4:06] He was uh he committed polygamy when the
[4:09] Bible said he he wouldn't. Let's pull
[4:10] that up there, would you, hun? And if
[4:12] you got your Bibles, let's get ready to
[4:13] read. I'm going to go through some new
[4:14] verses here tonight. So, everybody get
[4:16] out their Bible, please, if you're a
[4:17] reader. But, would you put up
[4:19] Deuteronomy 17:17 there?
[4:23] Remember Moses had told uh he had
[4:25] prophesied basically telling all the
[4:26] future kings, make sure you read the
[4:28] scripture every year. Remember, they do
[4:31] a fresh copy of the Bible. The kings
[4:32] were supposed to do that every year.
[4:35] So, this is uh the wisdom of God to uh
[4:37] the kings. Neither shall he multiply
[4:40] wives to himself.
[4:42] Right now, we don't know how many
[4:43] hundreds of wives David or I'm sorry, we
[4:45] don't know how many wives David had. We
[4:46] know Solomon had uh 700 wives, I think,
[4:49] and 300 concubines, if I'm not mistaken.
[4:51] It's either one or the other. So, he had
[4:53] a thousand uh women in his life, right?
[4:56] And the Bible said they turned his heart
[4:58] away from God, right? Now, I think I
[5:01] proved one time that David had at least
[5:03] eight wives, if I'm not mistaken, that
[5:04] were by name. Seven or eight by name, if
[5:07] I'm not mistaken. So, we don't know how
[5:08] many wives David actually had, but um
[5:12] that his heart turned not away. Neither
[5:14] shall he greatly multiply to himself
[5:16] silver or gold. Now, we can see Solomon
[5:18] clearly owed disobeyed dad, but but
[5:19] David did have a lot of wives, right?
[5:21] David did uh Abraham just had three,
[5:24] right? Sarah, uh Coutura, and then
[5:27] Hagar, right? Three. So, we see David,
[5:30] I'm sorry, we see Abraham didn't
[5:32] multiply wives, right? But David did,
[5:34] right? Because you you you can do
[5:36] multiplication, right? If he had eight
[5:37] or seven or eight wives, he's one,
[5:39] right? So one time eight or something
[5:41] like that or two, you know, two times
[5:43] four maybe, you know, uh so there was
[5:45] multiplication there. And then David had
[5:47] poor fathering as well. He failed to
[5:49] correct Amnan
[5:51] uh and Abselon and there was awful awful
[5:54] consequences, lots of murders in his
[5:56] family. Of course, that was partly due
[5:58] to because of his adultery and murder
[6:00] with Uriah Basheba. But then he he did
[6:03] fail to correct his sons.
[6:06] Now uh we also looked at how uh you know
[6:08] I want to get back to this how he
[6:10] changed his countenance. I I was reading
[6:12] uh more and church there's another psalm
[6:15] David wrote about that moment when he
[6:17] was captured by the Philistines and he
[6:19] was brought before King Akish and he
[6:21] pretended like he was insane. So let's
[6:24] go there. Let's go to Psalm 56 if you
[6:26] would. Let's go to Psalm 56.
[6:29] I'll do my reading here and then maybe
[6:30] after that we'll go individual verses
[6:32] and I can have the everybody read if
[6:35] they'd like to read tonight.
[6:39] So here's another one. Now look at the
[6:40] words here the before verse one, right?
[6:43] Because that's what we saw on Psalm 34.
[6:45] The words before the psalm sometimes
[6:47] tell the context. Not always, but
[6:49] sometimes they tell the context. to the
[6:51] chief musician upon Jonathan Elam
[6:55] Retrokim Mitchtam of David when the
[6:58] Philistines took him in Gath. So here we
[7:00] see the same thing, right? He's taken uh
[7:04] by the Philistines at Gath. And this was
[7:08] uh this seems like it was right before
[7:10] he went in before the king and and
[7:12] pretended to be insane. Look, let's look
[7:15] at this chapter though. Be merciful unto
[7:16] me, oh God, for man would swallow me up.
[7:19] be fighting daily oppresseth me. My
[7:22] enemies would daily swallow me up." Now,
[7:24] of course, he's speaking of King Saul
[7:25] there, but also the Philistines, for
[7:27] they be many that fight against me, oh
[7:29] thou most high. So, not not only is he
[7:32] fighting King Saul's men, right, and
[7:34] trying to escape them, but now he's
[7:35] amongst Philistines.
[7:37] So, he's just surrounded by enemies all
[7:39] around.
[7:42] Uh, what time I am afraid, I will trust
[7:44] in. Now, there's a good confession,
[7:45] right? He recognizes, well, when I'm
[7:47] afraid, what can I do? All I can do is
[7:49] trust in you. So that's a great song,
[7:51] right? Don't you love that? In God I
[7:54] will praise his word.
[7:56] Hallelujah. In God I have put my trust.
[7:59] I will not fear what flesh can do unto
[8:02] me. That's quite a statement there.
[8:04] Hallelujah. Every day they rest my
[8:06] words. And remember that means twist.
[8:08] Rest means twist. That's an oldfashioned
[8:10] King James word. But it means they they
[8:12] take what I say, but they give it a
[8:14] meaning that I didn't intend to mean,
[8:16] right? They twist the scriptures. They
[8:18] twist my words. That's not what I meant
[8:19] to say. You're twisting my meaning of my
[8:22] words,
[8:23] right? All their thoughts are against me
[8:26] for evil. In other words, no matter what
[8:28] I say, they're not going to say anything
[8:29] good about me. It's kind of like the
[8:31] politics, right? Uh when the Democrats
[8:33] are in, the Republicans can't say
[8:35] anything good. When the Republicans
[8:36] Republicans are in, the Democrats can't
[8:38] say anything good,
[8:40] right? Verse six, they gather themselves
[8:42] together. They hide themselves. They
[8:44] mark my steps. they or when they wait
[8:46] for my soul. Shall they escape by
[8:48] iniquity? In thine anger cast down the
[8:50] people, oh God. So in other words, God
[8:53] is not going to let them get away with
[8:54] their iniquity. Verse eight, thou tell
[8:56] us my wonderings, put thou my tears into
[8:59] thy bottle. Are they not in thy book?
[9:02] What a beautiful scripture that is. See,
[9:04] when you cry out to God, when you
[9:06] actually cry tears, God holds them,
[9:08] right? Put them in your bottle. Look at
[9:10] that. God collects all your tears. In
[9:12] other words, he hears all your prayers.
[9:14] Amen. Hallelujah.
[9:17] Think about that. All your tears he
[9:18] catches. All in other words, he knows
[9:20] everything you're crying about.
[9:23] Right? What a what an encouragement that
[9:24] is. And this is right before he goes
[9:26] before the king in the hometown of
[9:29] Goliath, the man he killed, the giant he
[9:31] defeated.
[9:33] Verse nine, when I cry unto thee, then
[9:36] shall my enemies turn back. This I know,
[9:38] for God is for me. Hallelujah. What a
[9:42] testimony. this. You can tell he's on
[9:45] he's he's battling fear, right? He's
[9:46] battling fear, but he's claiming the
[9:48] promise of God. Hallelujah. God is for
[9:52] me. So, see church, that's why we sing
[9:53] that song, the blessing, right? He is
[9:55] for me. Remember, we sing that. He is
[9:57] for me. He is for me. Now, some people
[9:58] complain that that's repetitive, but you
[10:00] might need that to encourage yourself
[10:02] sometimes. You might have to repeat it a
[10:04] couple times. God's for me. God's for
[10:06] me. God is for me. I believe God is for
[10:08] me. Sometimes you just got to repeat
[10:10] that. Sometimes you just got to repeat
[10:11] the word of God. Hallelujah. Until it
[10:14] becomes a reality, God is for me. And I
[10:16] know if I cry unto him, he's going to
[10:18] collect my tears. He's going to write
[10:20] down my prayers. Hallelujah. The angels
[10:22] are going to correct my or collect my
[10:23] prayers. And God is going to be for me.
[10:26] He's going to help me fight my enemies.
[10:29] Verse 10. I in God will I praise his
[10:31] word. In the Lord will I praise his
[10:34] word. In God and in the Lord.
[10:36] Hallelujah. In God have I put my trust.
[10:39] I will not be afraid what man can do
[10:41] unto me. Sounds like Jesus. Remember
[10:43] Jesus said, "Don't fear what man can do
[10:45] to you. They only have power over your
[10:47] body." But he said, "Fear God who has
[10:50] power over your soul." Hallelujah. Very
[10:53] scriptural here. Very inspired of the
[10:55] Holy Spirit. Now, I don't quite
[10:57] understand verse 12. Thy vows are upon
[11:00] me, oh God. I'm not sure what that
[11:01] means. Thy vows. Maybe God's promises to
[11:03] him. I will render praises unto thee.
[11:06] So, he's going to when he's afraid, he's
[11:08] going to call on God. He knows God is
[11:10] for him. He's going to give God the
[11:12] praise. So surely we can give God some
[11:14] praise tonight. Hallelujah. No matter
[11:16] what we're going through, we can give
[11:17] God praise. For thou hast delivered my
[11:21] soul from death. Now look at this. Wilt
[11:23] not thou deliver my feet from falling
[11:26] that I may walk before God in the light
[11:29] of the living. So what is he saying
[11:30] here? God's already delivered me before.
[11:32] Isn't he going to guide my steps now?
[11:34] Amen. In other words, God's not done
[11:36] with me, church. God's not done with
[11:39] you. Praise God. I know I'm preaching to
[11:41] young people here, you know, but I'm
[11:42] sure you've had battles and trials and
[11:44] you've had fearful moments, right? And
[11:46] those of us who are a little older,
[11:48] we've had more of those moments, but
[11:50] we've learned that if God did it once,
[11:51] he'll do it again. Praise God. Amen.
[11:54] Hallelujah. It's going to be probably
[11:55] different each time, but God will
[11:57] deliver us. Praise God. Hallelujah. What
[12:00] a And now look, look yours. This is his
[12:02] prayer to go along with the other one.
[12:04] Remember the other one? The high the
[12:05] highlight to me was now that was just
[12:07] me. The highlight to me was that the
[12:09] angel of the Lord encamps around all
[12:12] those that fear God. Amen. So, how can I
[12:15] fear if God's angel's here? If God's for
[12:18] me, God will deliver me again. And God
[12:20] did. Hallelujah. Now, church, I could be
[12:23] wrong here, but imagine David, he's
[12:25] spitting, right? He's scratching on the
[12:26] walls or he's scribbling. Remember, he's
[12:28] got like a pencil. He's scribbling on
[12:30] the walls. He's spitting up. But you
[12:31] know what that reminded me of? That
[12:33] reminded me of the day of Pentecost.
[12:35] Amen. Because the Bible said, "Are these
[12:37] drunk men?"
[12:39] See, see, see the similarity there.
[12:41] Yeah, that I believe that was a
[12:43] foreshadowing, right? There's a
[12:45] foreshadowing. David looked insane. Was
[12:47] they looked insane on the day of
[12:48] Pentecost as well? Hallelujah. But Peter
[12:51] says, "This is they're not drunk on
[12:52] natural, wine, but this is the Holy
[12:54] Spirit." God said, "Behold, I'll pour
[12:56] out my spirit upon all flesh."
[12:58] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. So, both
[13:01] cases, I believe both cases, they looked
[13:03] unnatural. uh they looked uh we'd say
[13:06] unnormal. I'm probably making false
[13:09] English words here. They looked uh
[13:11] strange. But in both cases, God brought
[13:14] about the victory despite their
[13:15] behavior. Amen. Hallelujah. And in other
[13:18] words, God used their behavior to bring
[13:20] about the victory. Hallelujah.
[13:23] Amen. Are you okay, Z? You okay, bud?
[13:29] Okay. Uh you want to help him out,
[13:30] Casea? I don't know if he's feeling
[13:32] sick. We've had sickness go through our
[13:34] house here lately. Thank you, Kesha.
[13:38] Yeah, just you don't cry very much. So,
[13:40] thank you, Casea. Appreciate that.
[13:42] So, how many like Psalm 56? That was
[13:45] fresh to me. Now, we got two Psalms, two
[13:47] songs about the same event. And church,
[13:50] if we're ever discouraged, we ought to
[13:52] go there and remember that that God
[13:54] collects all of our tears. Think of all
[13:56] the tears you cried at your seat or your
[13:58] altar or, you know, here at the altar or
[14:00] uh in your prayer closet at home or you
[14:02] cried in the car. Every time you cried,
[14:05] God saw it. Hallelujah. What an
[14:07] encouragement. You know, I've always
[14:09] wondered where that verse was. Uh
[14:10] because I've forgotten, but there it is.
[14:12] Praise God. Psalm 56. Hallelujah. Now,
[14:15] I'd like to get some readers here. Um if
[14:18] you got uh reading or maybe we'll start
[14:20] up front, Sister Zer, would you like to
[14:21] read tonight? Would that be okay? All
[14:22] right. Would you go to Psalm 40, sister?
[14:24] Psalm chapter 40. back to our text and
[14:27] then I want to get uh nature would you
[14:29] get Ezra 96
[14:32] then Caris Luke 18:13
[14:36] Victoria Luke 5'8 and I can repeat them
[14:38] here
[14:40] so we're going to start with Zur with
[14:41] Psalm 40 uh verse
[14:44] u I'm going to have her read uh 112 and
[14:46] 13 I'm going to have Zur read that for
[14:48] us so let everybody get there and then
[14:50] we'll start up a moment so I'm going to
[14:52] bring out uh what I'm bringing out is
[14:54] more verses where David talked about
[14:56] iniquities because I want you to see how
[14:59] he handled iniquities in his life.
[15:01] Church, does God ever delight in us
[15:03] sinning? Does God No. But does God know
[15:05] we're going to sin? Yes. That's why he
[15:08] provided a a bleach. Brother Ram says he
[15:11] provided a bleach, a way that we could
[15:12] get clean. Praise God. Not just uh and
[15:16] on Calvary. Yeah, it was one time he
[15:18] paid for everything, right? But that was
[15:20] that was future. That was uh forgiving
[15:22] us for all the future. uh but in our
[15:25] present life we get dirty in our
[15:27] thoughts or in our actions or in our
[15:29] deeds and so we need a cleansing daily
[15:31] in our lives. Hallelujah. So I'd like
[15:34] sister Z would you read uh Psalm 40 11
[15:37] 12 and 13 please.
[16:01] Amen. Thank you, sister. Wonderful job.
[16:03] Wonderful. Now, look, look, I just want
[16:05] to point out a few things. David's
[16:07] saying, "God, you have tender mercy on
[16:10] me. Your loving kindness and truth
[16:13] preserve me." So, what's going to keep
[16:15] us when we're struggling? Am I forgiven?
[16:17] Am I saved? What's going to keep us
[16:19] remembering God has loving kindness for
[16:21] us. Hallelujah. That's what David That's
[16:24] what David has to remember. Remember God
[16:26] is loving. God is merciful. And church
[16:30] uh I wanted her to read that because it
[16:32] says uh my my iniquities are more than
[16:36] the hairs in my head. Now Sunday I said
[16:37] there was like a thousand hairs. I was
[16:39] way off. There's between uh the average
[16:42] is between a 100,000 and 120 hairs on
[16:46] your head. I was way off. I was off by
[16:49] like a hundred times.
[16:52] Now, so if you put your hands on your
[16:53] hair real quick, that's that's a lot.
[16:55] That's a 100 thousand hairs right there.
[16:57] And David said, "My sins are like the
[16:59] number of hairs." Now, church, do you
[17:02] think he was lying? No, he wasn't lying.
[17:05] And remember that one time, Brother Ram
[17:07] said, "I uh" he said, "I I sin thousands
[17:09] of times in a year." Now, does doesn't
[17:12] that make sense?
[17:14] David said, "I my iniquities are like a
[17:16] hundred thousand." And brother Ram's
[17:17] like, "I sin thousands of times in a
[17:19] year." See how it fits perfectly?
[17:23] Now, is God big enough to forgive us?
[17:25] Absolutely.
[17:26] Is God's grace great enough to forgive
[17:28] us? Is his grace sufficient? And the
[17:30] church said, "Amen." If God forgave
[17:33] David, as we said, God forgave Brother
[17:35] Brandham, God will forgive us. If God
[17:37] forgave Paul of standing there as an
[17:39] accomplice to murder and then how he
[17:41] would drag Christians into jails and
[17:43] prisons and try to get them to get them
[17:46] to blaspheme. If God would forgive that,
[17:48] God will forgive us too. So I hope these
[17:52] sermons encourage you just how to uh
[17:54] understand for me it encouraged me uh to
[17:56] understand how God was so merciful to
[17:58] David even in his iniquities and God
[18:01] will be merciful to us even in our
[18:03] iniquities. So that's what it's helping
[18:05] me. All right. Now, and then look at
[18:08] verse 13. Be pleased, oh Lord, to
[18:11] deliver me. So, David is expecting God
[18:13] to be pleased with him. Despite having
[18:16] 100,000 sins,
[18:18] David still expects God to forgive all
[18:20] those and love him and be pleased with
[18:22] him. In other words, God's not angry
[18:25] with you of all the sins you you you
[18:27] make as long as you confess them.
[18:31] Okay? Does that make sense? David
[18:33] expects God to be pleased with him. And
[18:35] God was, right? Because God called him,
[18:37] God told uh uh Samuel, he's a man after
[18:40] my own heart, yet he's got 10,000 sins.
[18:45] I'm sorry, 100,000. I'm still I'm still
[18:47] way below. I keep messing up the number.
[18:49] A 100,000 sins. Now, just so the girls
[18:53] understand, that's less than the number
[18:55] of people in that live in Akran. I think
[18:58] the last census was about 120,000 if I'm
[19:00] not mistaken. Or maybe it's 200,000. So,
[19:03] think about that. When you drive through
[19:05] Akran, all the people in all those
[19:06] homes, that's about the number of of
[19:09] hairs on your head. And that's the
[19:11] number of sins David said he had. And
[19:13] yet God could still forgive him. And God
[19:15] could say, "You're a man after my own
[19:17] heart."
[19:19] That's mercy. That's loving kindness.
[19:22] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[19:25] So all God expects is that we daily
[19:28] repent of our sins. That's all God
[19:30] expects.
[19:32] Now, let's go to uh nature. Now, here's
[19:35] some more verses about the heads hanging
[19:37] low. Ezra 96. Nature got that one.
[20:00] Amen. So Ezra, remember Ezra, he came to
[20:04] teach the people the word. He left from
[20:07] Babylon to go back to Jerusalem after
[20:10] Zerubabel had gone back. Remember that?
[20:12] So that was called the return from
[20:14] exile. Israel got exiled to Babylon. But
[20:16] then God put it on Cyrus's heart for
[20:18] some of them to come back. Well, Ezra,
[20:20] when he comes back, he praises us and
[20:22] says, "God, we have been so wicked and
[20:24] he's so ashamed of the people's sins
[20:27] that he can't even raise his head."
[20:30] Hallelujah.
[20:32] So, does that sound familiar? Just like
[20:34] David. David couldn't even lift his
[20:36] head. So, see friends, should we feel
[20:38] bad for our sins? Yes. Yes, we should
[20:41] feel bad. And there's going to be times,
[20:42] you young girls especially, as you get
[20:44] older, Lydia probably knows, I'm sure
[20:46] Zur and I understand, there's going to
[20:47] be times we're ashamed that we did the
[20:49] sins that we did, and it makes us hang
[20:51] our heads, right? I can say amen to
[20:53] that. There's times I don't feel worthy
[20:56] to even lift my head to heaven. But you
[20:59] got to go through that to experience
[21:01] God's loving kindness.
[21:03] Hallelujah.
[21:06] So, David did it. Ezra did it. Now, the
[21:08] next one was Luke 18:13. Carris, the
[21:10] publican. I love this one. The publican.
[21:25] Very good. So, which one did Jesus say
[21:28] got forgiven? The prideful one or the
[21:30] humble one? The one that wouldn't lift
[21:33] up his head. So, other guy's like, "Oh,
[21:35] thank God I fast twice a week. Thank God
[21:37] I'm so holy." And the other guy that
[21:39] couldn't even lift up to heaven, he just
[21:40] smites his chest. Which one was
[21:42] forgiven? The humble one with his head
[21:44] down. So that shows how God wants us to
[21:47] look at ourselves. We need his mercy. We
[21:50] need to confess our sins every day.
[21:52] Amen. Hallelujah. Now church, there's
[21:54] going to be days you didn't sin, maybe
[21:56] much or maybe at all. Brother Bam says,
[21:58] uh, in one place, Brother Bam says you
[22:01] can go without sinning. Another place he
[22:02] says you'll sin every day. So, and like
[22:05] I said, maybe you make it through a day
[22:06] you didn't sin. Hallelujah. But either
[22:08] way, there's going to be times you come
[22:09] to church where you're really rejoicing
[22:11] and you can't lift your head. There's
[22:12] going to be times maybe you can't lift
[22:14] your head, but keep trusting in the
[22:16] loving kindness and mercy of Almighty
[22:18] God because that's what David had to do.
[22:20] That's what Ezra had to do. That's what
[22:22] the publican had had to do.
[22:24] And also the next one is Peter. So I
[22:27] think we're at Victoria. Uh Luke 5'8.
[22:29] Hun, you want to read that?
[22:41] So now Peter, the man with the keys to
[22:43] the kingdom, praise God, the man with a
[22:46] revelation from the father that Jesus
[22:48] was the Christ. Even his sins make him
[22:51] bow his head at the feet of Jesus and
[22:54] say, "I am a sinner. I'm a wicked man."
[22:57] Because he wouldn't take Jesus' uh uh
[23:00] wisdom to throw the net on the other
[23:01] side, right? It took him a while to
[23:03] obey. So, see church, if it takes us a
[23:06] while for us to obey, we should feel
[23:08] ashamed of that. We should have to
[23:09] repent of that. Praise God. But no, he's
[23:12] not done with us. He's going to give us
[23:14] another chance. He's going to deliver us
[23:16] again. Hallelujah. Just like David.
[23:18] Amen. He said, David said, "I know he's
[23:20] going to deliver me again. If he did it
[23:22] once, he'll do it again." Praise God.
[23:24] We're talking about a loving father. No
[23:26] wonder the Bible said, "For God so loved
[23:29] and God but God who's rich in mercy."
[23:31] Praise God. No wonder the Bible says
[23:34] that.
[23:36] And remember church, he had sins from
[23:37] his youth. So in case you put up uh a
[23:39] member Psalm 25:7. So David wasn't a
[23:42] perfect child. So children, you don't
[23:45] have to be perfect. Now you want to try.
[23:47] You want to try, but you're not going to
[23:49] be perfect. So remember, God's not going
[23:51] to remember your sins if you confess
[23:53] them.
[23:54] Remember not the sins of my youth, nor
[23:56] my transgressions according to thy
[23:58] mercy. Remember thou me for thy goodness
[24:01] sake, oh Lord. In other words, remember
[24:03] the good things I did in middle school.
[24:05] Right. Me too.
[24:08] Right. Remember the good things I did in
[24:10] high school, Lord.
[24:13] Case's in high school. Haven. Uh what
[24:16] grade are you going in next next year?
[24:18] Okay. Not not yet. So you're one year
[24:20] away. Haven's close to high school. So
[24:22] remember my sins that I committed in
[24:24] middle school or elementary or high
[24:26] school or college or whatever, wherever
[24:28] you are, Lord, but use me. Remember me
[24:31] for your goodness sake. Remember what I
[24:33] wanted to do for you. Praise God. And
[24:35] the good things I did do for you.
[24:39] So it just shows David said, "I got a
[24:41] 100,000 sins right on his hair, on his
[24:43] head." He's like, "These remind me of
[24:44] all my sins, but I know he'll forgive
[24:47] them and he'll remember the good things
[24:49] I did as well." Amen. Praise God.
[24:51] Hallelujah.
[24:53] So he, in other words, he wasn't perfect
[24:55] like Jesus. Jesus was the only perfect
[24:57] child.
[24:59] Hallelujah.
[25:01] That's right. Now church, let's look at
[25:03] Psalm 31. Virtue, do you want to read,
[25:05] hun? Okay. Psalm 31:9. Eden, do you want
[25:09] to read, hun?
[25:10] Okay. Can you get Psalm 32:5?
[25:15] Pardon me?
[25:17] Share Bible. That's fine. Huh? Very
[25:18] good.
[25:20] So Psalm 31:9
[25:23] for virtue and then Psalm 32:5. So there
[25:27] are two consecutive chapters. Psalm 31,
[25:29] Psalm 32.
[25:31] And then Lydia, you want to get uh 2
[25:34] Timothy 2:25.
[25:41] I can tell I'm not going to make it very
[25:42] far. I thought I'd get through all this.
[25:44] There's no way I'm going to get close.
[25:50] I wanted to be done at a good time too,
[25:52] just for my family's sake here. Uh, so
[25:55] let me set a timer. Maybe do like half
[25:57] an hour more. How long is that? I've
[25:58] been on the live stream. 25. Okay. So
[26:01] I'll do 30 minute time.
[26:04] Okay. Uh, God, virtue. Psalm 319 and 10.
[26:08] Can you read 9 and 10? 31 9 and 10.
[26:38] sighing.
[26:47] Amen. Okay. So, David's asking for
[26:50] mercy, right? This is David.
[26:52] And what he said, he has grief in his in
[26:55] his soul and his belly. So he can feel
[26:57] it real deep inside, right? He has grief
[27:00] because he he's had lots of years of
[27:02] sighing. You ever know what a sigh is?
[27:04] When you go, can this day get any worse?
[27:07] You know, can can any other trials come
[27:10] all my life?
[27:12] I've waited so long.
[27:15] And he's these are the years he spent
[27:16] running from King Saul. Okay? And now I
[27:20] want you to notice his strength failed
[27:22] because of what? His own iniquity. Not
[27:24] Saul. Not his enemies, but his own
[27:28] iniquity.
[27:30] So see this kind of goes along with your
[27:32] heads hanging down. You can hardly
[27:33] worship, hardly pay attention to the
[27:35] preaching or or maybe at home you can
[27:37] hardly read your Bible, hardly pray
[27:39] because your iniquities impact you,
[27:42] right? The enemy will try to bring
[27:44] guilt. The enemy will try to bring
[27:46] discouragement. So much that affects
[27:48] your body too,
[27:51] right? It affects your body where your
[27:53] head hangs down. Can't even look up to
[27:56] heaven.
[27:57] You don't you don't even feel strong
[27:59] enough to get out of your chair. We'll
[28:00] say it like that. Or sometimes you ever
[28:02] feel like that you don't want to get out
[28:03] of bed. Now, that might be because
[28:05] you're tired, but David had it where it
[28:07] was because of his sin. Ever felt like
[28:09] that? You don't want to get up because
[28:11] of your sin? You don't want to face the
[28:13] next day because of your sin?
[28:16] You're not alone. David was there.
[28:18] Hallelujah. But if David overcame, you
[28:21] can overcome, too. Hallelujah. Because
[28:23] you've got a better covenant and better
[28:25] promises.
[28:27] Hallelujah. Praise God. We have a blood
[28:30] that can clear our conscience.
[28:33] So, see, we've got we will go through
[28:35] this, but our going through this should
[28:36] be shorter because we've got more
[28:38] powerful blood.
[28:40] Amen.
[28:42] I read it this morning. Uh, Hebrews
[28:44] 10:4, put up there. Hebrews 10:4, the
[28:46] it's impossible for the blood of bulls
[28:48] and goats to take away sin. That's
[28:51] right. So, that's what that's part of
[28:53] the reason David had so much guilt on
[28:55] him. His head was hanging down. He had
[28:57] no strength because of all the
[28:59] hundred,000 iniquities. I'm going to
[29:00] keep going like that. 100,000 or maybe
[29:04] 120,000.
[29:06] He felt like iniquities, but he still
[29:09] trusted in God. It was Hebrews, I'm
[29:11] sorry, 10:4. Honey, I said the wrong
[29:13] one. Hebrews 10:4. My fault. Yes. Thank
[29:16] you. So, it wasn't possible. So, see,
[29:18] this is very important. No wonder David
[29:22] struggled with sin so much.
[29:25] Now, we got a different situation. We've
[29:27] got the blood of Jesus. Hallelujah.
[29:29] Amen. Uh, hold your spot. Let me go to
[29:33] Hebrews 10.
[29:36] I think it says I think it's 10:29. I
[29:38] could be wrong, huh? But it says, "How
[29:40] much more shall the blood of Jesus
[29:41] Christ uh purge our conscience?" Is it
[29:44] 10:29?
[29:46] I'm thinking,
[29:50] No, that's the
[29:56] So, at least once a service I I want to
[29:58] go try to find a quote where I lose
[30:00] something, right? And so, you're always
[30:02] very patient.
[30:04] Conscience.
[30:07] Yep. I'm sure that's it. There you go,
[30:10] hun. Thank you. All right, let's let's
[30:11] give her two claps. Ready?
[30:13] How much more shall the blood of Christ,
[30:15] Now, he's comparing the Old Testament
[30:18] and the New Testament. How much more
[30:19] shall the blood of Christ, who through
[30:21] the eternal spirit offered himself
[30:23] without spot to God, purge your
[30:25] conscience from dead works to serve the
[30:27] living God?
[30:29] So, the conscience says, "Oh, I can't
[30:31] believe I mistreated Haven like that
[30:33] yesterday. I can't believe I said that
[30:34] to Acacia yesterday. Or I can't believe
[30:36] I sinned against Lydia when I did that
[30:37] yesterday. You know, your conscience
[30:40] will get on you. Oh, you're not worthy
[30:42] of going to church. You're not worthy of
[30:44] preaching. You're not certainly not
[30:45] worthy of song leading. But the Bible
[30:47] says the blood of Jesus Christ purges
[30:50] that. It sends that away as long as we
[30:53] confess it. He's faithful when we're
[30:55] not. Hallelujah. Amen. He's faithful to
[30:58] cleanse us from all unrighteousness and
[31:00] purge our conscience so we can go do our
[31:02] duty, right? We can do our works. We can
[31:04] do the good works. We can serve our
[31:06] husband, serve our wife. We can serve
[31:08] our children. We can go to work and face
[31:10] our boss again. Whatever. We can go to
[31:11] school, face our teachers, even though
[31:13] we made mistakes and say, "I'm
[31:14] forgiven." Hallelujah. Amen. I'm not
[31:17] going to live in guilt. I'm not going to
[31:18] live in shame. I'm not going to live
[31:19] with my head down. I'm going to lift up
[31:21] my head. Praise God. Amen. Because the
[31:24] blood of Jesus Christ has purged my
[31:26] conscience. So now I can go serve him.
[31:30] Right? I'm not going to sit in an idol
[31:32] condition. I'm going to go serve God.
[31:35] And I put out a YouTube video this
[31:36] morning, you know, and I was even honest
[31:39] on there. Some days I don't feel like
[31:41] making a YouTube video. Amen. Some days
[31:44] I'm really excited to do it. Some days
[31:45] I'm not
[31:47] because I don't feel worthy. Some days I
[31:50] don't feel worthy to come preach and
[31:51] song lead. But you know what? I got two
[31:53] choices. I can either live under the
[31:54] condemnation or I can confess a sin and
[31:57] have no condemnation. Amen. Amen. So
[31:59] what do I choose? Romans 8:1. There is
[32:02] now therefore no condemnation to them
[32:04] who are in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah. And
[32:07] walk after the spirit and not the flesh.
[32:11] Right? You got to make a choice. And so
[32:14] church, as long as you confess your
[32:15] sins, God hears your confession. And
[32:18] then your conscience can be purged even
[32:20] though you got 120,000 sins. You might
[32:23] feel like
[32:26] like I told Lydia in the van on the way
[32:28] to church. Do you think David was lying
[32:29] when he said I now he might have been
[32:31] using hyperbole, right? Where you make
[32:33] exaggerations, but he wasn't lying.
[32:36] He wasn't lying saying, "Well, yeah, I'm
[32:38] just going to make up this crazy
[32:39] number." In other words, everybody sins,
[32:42] right? We all fall short of God's glory,
[32:45] and it's a pretty big number.
[32:50] Okay. Now, good reading there. Uh,
[32:51] wonderful. That was virtue, right? So,
[32:53] we got Eden. Eden. Psalm 32:E5.
[33:01] Good.
[33:22] Very
[33:32] good. Give it to class. Great job, Eden.
[33:35] Now, for the live streamers, they didn't
[33:36] hear that. I acknowledge my sin unto
[33:38] thee, and my iniquity have I not hid. I
[33:41] said, I will confess my transgressions
[33:42] unto the Lord, and thou forgavest the
[33:45] iniquity of my sin. Sila. Now, cila
[33:47] means to stop and pause. So, you got to
[33:49] stop and pause that. As long as I don't
[33:51] hide my sin and I confess it, he
[33:53] forgives me. That's why it's so
[33:56] important to pray every night before
[33:57] bed, right? Confess all your sins,
[34:00] right? Could get it all confessed. Don't
[34:03] hide it from God. He sees it anyway,
[34:04] church. Let's not think we can hide
[34:07] something from the allseeing God whose
[34:09] eyes run to and forth on the earth all
[34:11] day, all night. His eyes are running
[34:14] through this church. His eyes are
[34:15] running through our cars. His He's
[34:17] everywhere. Praise God. So, let's just
[34:18] confess what we've done. He saw it
[34:20] anyway. Praise God. And then stop and
[34:23] think and pause and said, "As long as I
[34:25] didn't hide it and confess it, he's
[34:27] forgiven it." This is not a license to
[34:30] sin. But I'll say like this. It's a
[34:32] license to confess your sins and feel
[34:34] forgiven.
[34:35] Amen. It's a license to know you're a
[34:38] sinner, but if you confess, he will
[34:40] forgive you. Praise God.
[34:43] You still have the law in your members.
[34:45] That's what I mean. Now, in one way,
[34:46] you're a saint. Yes. In one way, you're
[34:48] a saint. another way you're a saint and
[34:49] a sinner, right?
[34:53] And brother Bam says, at church all the
[34:55] way to the end of his life, he says,
[34:56] "I'm a sinner saved by grace." Even
[34:59] after preaching the greatest services,
[35:00] he called him, he said, "If I ever
[35:02] preach anything inspired, it was those
[35:04] seven seals." And even at the end of
[35:06] that, he said, "I'm just a sinner saved
[35:08] by grace, not fit to live." He said,
[35:10] "Put all this grace on Jesus Christ."
[35:13] So even in the most even in your most
[35:15] anointed times, think about that. When
[35:17] were you most anointed by the Holy
[35:18] Ghost? Even in that, you should have
[35:20] been able to say, "I'm a sinner." Say,
[35:22] "By grace, God did it." Whatever it was.
[35:24] Amen. Whatever it was, God did it.
[35:27] Praise God. Because in Brother Ram's
[35:29] greatest time of anointing of services,
[35:31] he said, "I'm still a sinner saved by
[35:32] grace."
[35:36] Now, so see that? And it's so simple.
[35:38] Just acknowledge to God, I sinned, but
[35:41] I'm not going to hide it. God, forgive
[35:43] my sins. And then you'll be forgiven.
[35:46] Now, here's here's where when people
[35:48] remain in sin and they're trapped in sin
[35:51] and addiction, here's this is the
[35:53] problem. They won't acknowledge their
[35:54] sin. They act like they haven't done
[35:56] anything wrong.
[35:59] Right? So, Lydia's got that. Second
[36:00] Timothy 2:25 and 26. So, when people get
[36:03] caught in a snare or a complex or an
[36:06] awful sin, their problem is they don't
[36:09] acknowledge that they are in sin
[36:12] and they hide their sin from others.
[36:14] They hide their sin from God because
[36:16] they're say, "Oh, I haven't done nothing
[36:18] wrong." Go ahead, Lydia.
[36:32] Good. Leave that up there, hun.
[36:33] Wonderful job. See, so if someone's
[36:35] going to if someone's opposing
[36:37] themselves to their own personal sin, if
[36:40] they're going to repent, they have to
[36:41] acknowledge the truth that they got
[36:43] caught in Satan's snare,
[36:46] right? They have to admit it was my sin.
[36:49] It was my fault. They have to
[36:51] acknowledge I gave into the sin, whether
[36:54] it's lust of the eyes, lust of the
[36:56] flesh, pride of life, right?
[36:59] And then if they do that, then they can
[37:01] recover themselves out of the snare or
[37:04] out of the trap.
[37:06] Right? That's what David did. David
[37:08] said, "I acknowledge my sin.
[37:11] I'm the one that sinned against God."
[37:13] David said, "I'm not blaming on Basheba.
[37:15] It was me." Right? That's what he said.
[37:18] He said, "Against you only have I
[37:20] sinned." Now, also, he sinned against
[37:21] Israel and Basheba and Uriah. But he it
[37:24] was so personal to him. He said, "I
[37:26] you're the one I sinned against. I'm
[37:28] acknowledging that I sinned. Amen.
[37:30] Hallelujah. Now, that ought to help us,
[37:33] especially as our with our siblings,
[37:35] right? Children, can you look up here?
[37:37] If you hurt your brothers or sisters,
[37:38] now you got brothers. If you hurt your
[37:40] brother or sister's feelings, you go
[37:42] say, "I'm sorry. It's my fault." That's
[37:45] you acknowledging your sin.
[37:48] Say that. It's my fault. It's It was my
[37:52] sin. Okay? Does that make sense? That's
[37:54] when you'll be really forgiven. Not
[37:57] like, "Well, I sinned, but it's your
[37:58] fault because you did." No, no, no, no.
[38:00] There's no, "But it's your fault." It's
[38:02] your fault.
[38:04] Just confess your sins. Acknowledge your
[38:06] sins. Don't make excuses for sins
[38:09] because you can overcome. You had every
[38:11] opportunity to overcome sin. Amen. No
[38:14] one forced you to sin. Amen. So, you
[38:17] just have to say, "I'm sorry. No matter
[38:19] what you did to me, it doesn't matter. I
[38:21] sin back." Or, "I sinned as well."
[38:23] Praise God.
[38:25] There's going to be sometimes children,
[38:26] there's going to be some times as you
[38:27] grow up, other people, you might repent
[38:29] to them and you might hope they repent
[38:31] back and they won't and you still got to
[38:32] forgive them, especially when you get
[38:34] older, right? Nature's going to see that
[38:37] as you get to middle school, high
[38:38] school, you're going to see that. You'll
[38:40] apologize to a friend, but maybe a
[38:41] friend won't apologize back. You still
[38:43] got to love them. And you got to pray
[38:45] that they will they'll get this. They'll
[38:47] get the acknowledging of the truth and
[38:50] they'll repent that they did some wrong
[38:52] as well.
[38:54] Very good. Good. Lydia, thank you, hun.
[38:58] Okay, so I'm already at uh Okay, it's
[39:00] almost 8 o'clock. All right,
[39:05] now church, I just want to remind you of
[39:06] this quote. I have a quote here um
[39:12] that sometimes
[39:14] brother Brandham would go to the pulpit
[39:16] knowing he was battling sin. So, I'm
[39:18] going to read that quote again about
[39:19] crit having a critical spirit.
[39:22] He said, 'I want, this is 1954, October
[39:24] 3rd. I want to ask the church one more
[39:27] thing before we get some place to study
[39:29] the scriptures. That is that you'll pray
[39:31] for me. I've developed a critical spirit
[39:34] and it haunts at me. I told my wife
[39:37] yesterday the first time something
[39:39] happened now that I was sitting in the
[39:40] yard and I told her, she had reminded me
[39:42] and I told her about it. I said, "Honey,
[39:44] I've got to a place till I become
[39:47] critical of people. I don't want to be.
[39:50] Whose job is it? It's not mine. God's
[39:53] the one to criticize, not me.
[39:57] But he asks he So, what am I saying?
[40:00] You're going to have to just go through
[40:01] events knowing you're battling spirits.
[40:04] Amen. Right. You like brother, he
[40:06] couldn't get away from it. He's like,
[40:08] I'm currently
[40:10] I'm current this currently haunts me.
[40:13] I've developed this. In other words, I
[40:15] got a complex, but I still got to do my
[40:17] duty.
[40:20] So, see, church, what do you give up or
[40:21] you just keep pressing through? You keep
[40:23] pressing through. You don't give up. God
[40:27] wants you. Did Did David give up when
[40:28] he's running for all those years? No. He
[40:30] just kept believing. He kept trying to
[40:33] sing new songs. Amen. Right. He just put
[40:36] on a He just put on a happy song. He put
[40:39] on Omema or something like that or
[40:41] praise. I'm gonna praise. He just put on
[40:44] a happy song to try to lift his spirits.
[40:46] So if God did it once, he can do it
[40:48] again. Praise God. Hallelujah. But
[40:51] brother comes and he preaches knowing
[40:55] he's got a complex, but he still asks
[40:57] for the people's prayers. Now, most of
[40:59] you here are never going to preach,
[41:01] right?
[41:02] But you're going to make supper or
[41:05] you're going to fold some laundry,
[41:07] right? Or you're going to make Yeah.
[41:08] You're going to make breakfast, right?
[41:11] or you're going to sing a song special
[41:13] or you're going to work on the computer
[41:14] or you're going to play on the organ.
[41:17] Or you're going to play tambourine.
[41:20] You're going to do something and you
[41:21] might be battling, but don't quit. Just
[41:24] trust in God. Just keep trying to get
[41:26] through it and do the best you can and
[41:28] God will bring deliverance at the right
[41:29] time. Hallelujah. Think about that. For
[41:32] years, David wanted delivered from Saul.
[41:34] Did he get it right away? No.
[41:36] apparently here, brother Bam, I I don't
[41:38] know how long he had this, but when he
[41:40] went to the pulpit, he still didn't have
[41:41] deliverance from this. He said, "Pray
[41:43] for me. I've developed a critical
[41:45] spirit." So, I'm just letting you know
[41:47] there's going to be sometimes we're
[41:49] doing things for God, but we're battling
[41:51] inside. We're battling complexes inside.
[41:54] Amen.
[41:56] But you don't quit. You don't give up.
[41:58] You don't let not what do you do? You
[42:00] don't hide it. Now, look at that.
[42:03] That's that's one reason I know brother
[42:05] Ham was a true prophet. He didn't hide
[42:07] sins all the time. He was able to humble
[42:10] himself and say, "I've got a critical
[42:12] spirit." Remember he said, "I feel like
[42:14] a jellyfish." Remember that? I feel like
[42:16] a son of kish. I'm walking in Balum's
[42:18] shoes. I've never to this day I've never
[42:21] heard a preacher say that other than
[42:22] brother Brandham. No. No preacher is
[42:26] ever that honest to tell us.
[42:29] Now, I'm not saying all the preachers
[42:31] have to. I don't want to know some of
[42:32] their sins, okay? Just like I wouldn't
[42:34] want to tell some of my sins.
[42:37] But in these minor ones, Brother Ram's
[42:39] able to just be honest. You know why?
[42:41] Because he had the Holy Ghost and he the
[42:43] Holy Ghost wrote these words and said,
[42:45] "I'm not going to hide it." So there's
[42:47] certain certain things he could confess
[42:49] before the people. So in other words,
[42:51] you're going to have to do your duty
[42:53] while still battling your iniquity. And
[42:55] the church said,
[42:57] just like brother Brandham, you can be
[42:59] haunted by your iniquities or your
[43:01] critical spirit or whatever it is. Uh
[43:04] could be lust. Like I had a brother
[43:06] email me today. He said he keeps falling
[43:07] to lust. And I said, don't be
[43:09] discouraged. Just keep battling those
[43:11] demons. Keep fighting. Keep fighting the
[43:14] good fight of faith. Praise God. Don't
[43:17] give up. Because some people might
[43:18] battle lust. Some people might battle
[43:20] greed. Some people might uh battle uh uh
[43:24] you know pride as we're saying with
[43:25] their call themselves the greatest of
[43:26] all time and all these things. Some
[43:29] people might battle of that critical
[43:31] spirit, right? But whatever we're going
[43:32] to battle, we've got one answer. We've
[43:34] got the blood of Jesus Christ to wash us
[43:36] clean. Hallelujah.
[43:39] Sometimes it's going to take longer than
[43:40] others for us to really repent and truly
[43:43] repent fully and get the victory like we
[43:46] want.
[43:48] All right. Um,
[43:51] let's read a couple more. Um, I'll read
[43:54] these because I think everybody's read
[43:56] once. Let's go to Psalm 38:3. Everybody
[43:57] got your Bible? Psalm 38:3.
[44:06] I think I'll stop the verses at that
[44:09] point. I'll close with those few
[44:10] testimonies. I think they'd be a
[44:12] blessing.
[44:14] Psalm 38:3, please.
[44:20] I think it really helped you.
[44:23] It helped me. It brought me to tears.
[44:25] I'm reading this email and I'm and I'm
[44:26] almost crying. I'm like, "Oh my
[44:28] goodness, God is so rich in mercy."
[44:30] Praise God.
[44:32] That's why, church, we can have hope for
[44:34] people who fall away or whatever
[44:36] happens, people that live in sin, we can
[44:38] have hope for them because if God saved
[44:39] this person, God can save anybody.
[44:43] God can save anybody. Psalm 38:3, "There
[44:46] is no soundness in my flesh because of
[44:48] thine anger. Neither is there any rest
[44:51] in my bones because of my sin." So now
[44:54] he's seen his head is down because of
[44:56] his sin. He's hanging his head. He has
[44:58] no strength
[45:00] and he feels like he's got no rest.
[45:02] Anybody ever feel like that? Amen.
[45:06] I try to sleep it off. I still don't
[45:07] feel rested because of my sin.
[45:11] David, a man after God's own heart, a
[45:14] man who slew Goliath, a man who they'd
[45:16] sing songs about. Anybody ever sang a
[45:19] song about you? No. No one's ever sang a
[45:22] song about me either. But this is a
[45:24] great man. We'd say, we'd say, a man
[45:26] that was really used by God,
[45:28] yet he feels like I have no strength. I
[45:31] can't get any rest because of my sin.
[45:35] See, don't let the devil beat you up too
[45:37] long. confess your sins and realize God
[45:40] has forgiven you.
[45:44] I appreciate uh appreciate the Lord's
[45:46] word tonight.
[45:47] Look at look at verse four. For my
[45:50] iniquities have gone over mine head. So
[45:54] they're just it's like it's like a
[45:55] flood, right? When the enemy comes in
[45:57] like a flood. Sometimes the enemy comes
[45:59] in because we let him in.
[46:03] Sometimes the flood comes in because uh
[46:05] we let the flood come up.
[46:07] Okay.
[46:09] My iniquities are going over my head.
[46:11] I'm just overwhelmed with my mistakes.
[46:14] A man after God's own heart
[46:19] as in heavy burden. They are too heavy
[46:21] for me. So I don't have any rest. And
[46:23] church, you ever feel like that? What's
[46:25] the picture of that? Uh Pilgrim's
[46:26] Progress. You ever seen Pilgrim's
[46:27] Progress? Before he gets saved, he's
[46:30] carrying that burden. But look, David
[46:31] says it can happen after you get saved,
[46:33] too.
[46:35] So, if you never seen Pilgrim's
[46:36] Progress, it's this man. It's a it's a a
[46:38] it's a not symbolism, but it's a
[46:41] metaphor. What's another word? Allegory.
[46:44] There you go. It's an allegory of a
[46:46] Christian. He hears he reads in a book
[46:48] about this eternal city, right? And he's
[46:50] making his way there, but as he goes,
[46:51] his burden gets heavier and heavier
[46:53] until he comes to the cross and then
[46:54] this huge backpack falls off. It's an
[46:57] awesome p. It's awesome movie if you
[46:59] haven't seen it. It's just a beautiful
[47:01] story. But then he then he's free. Then
[47:03] he's got the armor on. You know, he's
[47:05] like a new man. Christian's his name.
[47:06] Praise God. Beautiful story.
[47:10] But David, after he's already slain
[47:12] giant Goliath, he's got a giant burden
[47:16] from his sins.
[47:19] So, see church, what am I saying? We
[47:20] fight different giants.
[47:23] Sometimes it's a giant trying to take
[47:24] our life like Goliath, but sometimes
[47:26] it's the giant amount of sin that we've
[47:28] done.
[47:30] Brother Brandon had it. It haunts me. It
[47:33] wasn't helping him. It was haunting him.
[47:36] Our sin should haunt us
[47:39] until we what? Cast our burdens. Cast
[47:41] all your cares on the Lord. For he cares
[47:44] for you.
[47:46] Whichever felt like that, church, that
[47:48] my burdens, my sins, I can't I can't
[47:50] carry my sins anymore. So, what can you
[47:52] do? I must tell Jesus. That's why I love
[47:55] when Simon sings that song. I must tell
[47:57] Jesus all my troubles.
[48:02] What's the What's the verse say? I must
[48:03] tell Jesus. Jesus will what? Help. Jesus
[48:06] will help. Jesus will hear me. Right?
[48:09] Jesus cares. Hallelujah. Just don't hide
[48:12] your sin. Confess it. And if you know
[48:15] you confess it in prayer, he forgives
[48:17] it.
[48:22] But church, if anybody if if there's
[48:24] anyone in the Bible you can relate to to
[48:26] having trouble with sin and feeling
[48:27] guilty or shame, it's David.
[48:30] That's what's been inspired to me. I'm
[48:33] I'm seeing this. I'm like, "Oh my
[48:34] goodness, how did I miss this before?"
[48:36] But you know what? There's a time and
[48:37] season for everything. Amen. Hallelujah.
[48:41] Look at verse five. My wounds stink and
[48:43] are corrupt because of my foolishness.
[48:47] So even even his own mistakes even cause
[48:49] his body to to stink. So somehow he got
[48:52] pains. And if that's literal, verse six,
[48:56] I am troubled. I am bowed down greatly.
[48:59] I go mourning all the day long. Ever
[49:01] felt like you wasted a whole day feeling
[49:03] sorry for yourself? Join the club.
[49:06] The club of the people after God's own
[49:08] heart.
[49:10] That's David's club. That's Ezra, right?
[49:13] We saw it. Ezra,
[49:15] Daniel, they pray. They mourn over other
[49:18] people's sins.
[49:21] Now, skip down to verse 15. Psalm 38:15.
[49:26] For in thee, O Lord, do I hope. Thou
[49:30] wilt hear, O Lord my God. So see, as we
[49:33] look as we looked at a few years ago,
[49:35] it's okay to complain to God and tell
[49:36] God all your feelings, but you got to
[49:38] end with hope.
[49:40] Don't let the devil you bring you to
[49:42] depression, right? Let the Lord bring
[49:44] you out of that depression. Hope in the
[49:46] Lord. Praise God. You're still alive.
[49:49] You still got a chance to sing. You
[49:50] still got good parents. You still got a
[49:51] good church. There's hope. You still got
[49:53] the Bible. Hallelujah. Amen. You still
[49:55] got the Holy Ghost. Amen. You still got
[49:57] the message to listen to. You have so
[49:59] many blessings. Hallelujah. Hope in the
[50:01] Lord. Praise God.
[50:03] Glory.
[50:05] For in thee I hope. Do I hope? Verse 16.
[50:09] For I said, hear me, lest otherwise they
[50:11] should rejoice over me. When my foot
[50:13] slipth, they magnify themselves against
[50:15] me. Verse 17, for I'm ready to halt and
[50:18] my sorrow is continually before me. So
[50:20] now, not only is he drowning in it, now
[50:24] it's also in front of him.
[50:27] Look, I mean, is this can everybody
[50:30] understand this is David?
[50:33] This is the man who slain 10,000,
[50:36] but he also must have failed 10,000
[50:38] times, too.
[50:41] Maybe church is like this. Maybe as many
[50:44] times as he vict got the victory, that's
[50:45] many times he failed because it just
[50:48] said, "I got a hundred thousand There's
[50:50] the number of the hairs in my head.
[50:54] Look at verse 18. For I will declare
[50:58] mine iniquity.
[51:00] I will be sorry for my sin. There it is.
[51:04] Declare it to God. Now, if you sin
[51:06] against an individual like brother used
[51:08] with adultery, uh a woman asked Brother,
[51:10] "Uh, I confess my sin to my husband. I
[51:14] commit adultery with another man. Do I
[51:15] need to go to that man and his wife?"
[51:17] Brother man's like, "Yes, you need to go
[51:19] to them.
[51:21] Can't just confess it to your husband."
[51:22] He she he said, "You got to go confess
[51:24] it to the other person's spouse as well,
[51:28] right?" So, there's times you Yeah. If
[51:30] you sin publicly or something like that,
[51:32] uh you got to go confess that publicly,
[51:36] right?
[51:38] And then we'll be sorry for our sin.
[51:41] Now, I will get back to this here. Um,
[51:47] my there's just so much
[51:52] hit a scripture here, though.
[51:59] Uh, yeah. There's so so many here.
[52:06] Yeah. Let's go to uh let's go back to
[52:07] Psalm 25. I think I'll end with that one
[52:09] and then we'll do the story here.
[52:12] Psalm 25:10. We already were in Psalm
[52:14] 25, but let's go back to Psalm 25:10.
[52:19] Psalm 25:10. All the paths of the Lord
[52:22] are mercy and truth unto who? Such as
[52:25] keep his covenant and his testimonies.
[52:28] Well, that must include somebody who
[52:29] failed a h 100,000 times as well.
[52:33] Hallelujah.
[52:34] Because David's like, I'm keeping them,
[52:36] but I'm also breaking them. Hallelujah.
[52:40] We're keeping the message, but sometimes
[52:41] we disobey the message. That's okay.
[52:44] We're still in the covenant. Praise God.
[52:46] Hallelujah. Because we're in the
[52:48] covenant through the blood of the
[52:49] sacrifice. Who's our sacrifice? The Lord
[52:51] Jesus Christ. Remember we preached on
[52:54] communion. You're sprinkled with the
[52:55] spirit of God. You're sprinkled with the
[52:58] blood of Jesus Christ. When when you're
[52:59] joined to the covenant, when you got
[53:01] baptized in water.
[53:04] Hallelujah.
[53:07] Oh my. Thank you, Lord. Verse 11, for
[53:10] thy name's sake, oh Lord, pardon mine
[53:12] iniquity, for it is great.
[53:15] It's like a hundred thousand 100
[53:16] thousand hairs. It's great iniquity.
[53:19] Pardon it, oh Lord. What man is he that
[53:22] fearth the Lord? Him shall he teach in
[53:24] the way that he shall choose. Now
[53:26] remember, church, what's the fear of the
[53:27] Lord? Hate evil and depart from evil.
[53:30] So David had the fear of the Lord. He
[53:32] knew his iniquity was great, but he was
[53:34] able to depart from it and get right
[53:36] back on the right track. the right path.
[53:43] Verse 13, his soul shall dwell at ease
[53:46] and his seed shall inherit the earth. So
[53:48] look, there's ease. Remember before he
[53:50] couldn't have any rest. He couldn't rest
[53:52] because of his sin. But now he's
[53:53] confessed his sin. And now he feels that
[53:55] he can be at ease. He can have rest in
[53:58] his life because I didn't hide my sin. I
[54:01] told the Lord about my sin. Praise God.
[54:05] So the same man, he could have no rest
[54:06] and have all this all this guilt and
[54:08] shame, but then as soon as he confesses
[54:10] it, now I'm at ease. Now I got peace in
[54:12] my life.
[54:14] And that peace is available to all of us
[54:16] tonight here present and also on the
[54:18] live stream. God's peace is available to
[54:20] us. The next verse 14, I think is my
[54:23] last verse.
[54:25] Yes.
[54:27] The secret of the Lord is with them that
[54:29] fear him, and he will show them his
[54:32] covenant. A man that sinned a hundred
[54:34] thousand times, yet if he confess, God
[54:37] will still show him the secrets. And
[54:39] church, we've been given the mysteries
[54:40] of God.
[54:42] We got the, as I put out today, we have
[54:44] the mystery of the baptism of the Holy
[54:46] Ghost. Church, most people think if you
[54:48] just come up and say a prayer, "Oh, I
[54:50] want to ask Jesus in my heart." Now
[54:51] you're filled with the Holy Ghost. We
[54:53] know that's a bunch of foolishness.
[54:54] Amen. Why do we know that? Because the
[54:57] secret of God is with us.
[55:00] I've stood in a a church meeting and the
[55:05] preacher said, "You know, you five year
[55:06] old children, you're filled with the
[55:08] Holy Ghost and you can do greater works
[55:10] than Jesus." And I just went like this.
[55:12] Oh, God have mercy. Because they don't
[55:14] believe in the three works of grace.
[55:16] They don't believe in the real baptism
[55:18] of the Holy Ghost. They think you're
[55:20] filled with the Holy Ghost as soon as
[55:21] you say a sinner's prayer, a scripted
[55:23] prayer. But God has shown us the secret
[55:27] of the Lord. Amen. How many How many
[55:29] thankful for that? Praise God. And I'm
[55:32] glad we know that. Brother Brandham
[55:33] said, "It's not that we're going to do
[55:35] greater works than Jesus. How could you
[55:36] do greater than Jesus? It just means the
[55:38] church is going to do more." Hallelujah.
[55:41] Amen. Because the Holy Ghost is in more
[55:43] people's lives. Nobody could do greater
[55:45] than Jesus. Hallelujah.
[55:48] Let's stand to our feet. Musicians can
[55:50] come. Keep the live stream on because I
[55:51] want them to hear this testimony. I'm
[55:53] going to close with this one.
[55:59] I want to be mindful of the time just
[56:00] for my family's sake. Boy, we've had a
[56:03] whole month or more of sickness and
[56:04] hopefully we get out of this here pretty
[56:05] soon. There's my 30 minutes anyway.
[56:10] So now church, let me read this here.
[56:11] This is especially helpful for our young
[56:13] people here by God's grace.
[56:17] Now this is a brother uh in the message.
[56:20] So I want you to listen to this. I was
[56:22] growing up in a Christian family knowing
[56:23] the message. I was baptized at 13 years
[56:26] old.
[56:28] So, a lot of you were baptized before
[56:30] this man.
[56:32] I understood that Jesus died for my sins
[56:35] and I tried to be a good Christian.
[56:36] Notice try.
[56:43] When I was 14, I got into bad company in
[56:46] school and I started to smoke cigarettes
[56:48] and drink alcohol.
[56:54] As I was older, I started to use drugs
[56:56] and I was in I was in a deep way down.
[57:01] I stopped going to school and went away
[57:03] from home. I was using all sorts of
[57:06] drugs. I'm not going to read them. At
[57:08] least three kinds of drugs every day.
[57:10] Three different kinds of drugs every
[57:12] day. He was raised in the message. He
[57:15] had been baptized in the name of the
[57:16] Lord Jesus Christ.
[57:21] I went to Switzerland for a time and
[57:23] there I started to use even worse drugs.
[57:25] I'm not going to read them. I totally
[57:28] lost control of my life. I was stealing
[57:31] money, selling drugs, sleeping on the
[57:34] streets many times.
[57:38] And as he'll as he'll tell later, he
[57:40] left the message, but the message people
[57:42] kept praying for him. Hallelujah. So
[57:46] church, we just got to keep praying.
[57:49] Now, we don't we haven't had anybody
[57:50] here that's left us and is sleeping on
[57:52] the streets. Now, Austin did, but God
[57:55] brought him back,
[57:57] right? But think how low this person
[57:59] stooped into sin.
[58:04] I spent all my money for drugs and
[58:06] women. So, fornication or whorongers. We
[58:10] talked about that. He was a fornicator
[58:12] and a hormonger.
[58:14] And all my friends were addicts and
[58:16] criminals. Because remember, he's
[58:18] stealing.
[58:20] God saved my life from overdose more
[58:22] than once and also tried to commit
[58:24] suicide, but the hands of God spared me.
[58:27] I didn't want to even hear about God.
[58:34] I was mocking him, cursing him. I hated
[58:36] everything that was connected to God.
[58:38] Yet, he'd already been baptized.
[58:42] My life was all about drugs, money, and
[58:44] women. At one point, I realized that if
[58:47] I continue like this, I will die soon. I
[58:50] tried to stop my addiction, but I failed
[58:52] miserably every time I tried. So now
[58:54] he's in a snare. He can't get out.
[59:00] I was cold and my heart was like stone.
[59:03] Sound familiar? When you get saved, you
[59:04] get a heart of what? Flesh. New heart,
[59:07] new spirit. God's spirit. Three works of
[59:11] grace. Nothing satisfied me anymore. I
[59:14] couldn't sleep and I hated to be awake
[59:16] and sober. One night I was in the
[59:18] Netherlands in a small apartment. I was
[59:20] alone. My backpack was full of drugs and
[59:22] alcohol. As usual, I couldn't sleep. I
[59:25] was deeply troubled. I didn't know what
[59:27] is happening with me. And this brother
[59:29] told me I felt led to share this with
[59:30] you with me. And he said I could share
[59:33] it with you.
[59:37] I didn't know what was happening with
[59:39] me. I was so empty. It was about
[59:40] midnight. I turned on my laptop and I
[59:42] wrote into the internet something like
[59:44] William Brandon message.
[59:47] He's at he's like the prodigal son,
[59:49] right? He's as far away from God as he
[59:51] possibly could be. But something started
[59:53] taking control of him. I wonder if God
[59:55] was hearing prayers that were I wonder
[59:57] if God was collecting all those tears
[59:59] for all those years. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:00:02] Hallelujah.
[1:00:08] I clicked on the first thing and I
[1:00:09] turned on a message. It went for about 5
[1:00:11] minutes. I didn't listen to what he
[1:00:12] tells was telling. I was just standing
[1:00:15] in an empty dark room. Then I realized
[1:00:17] what I did and I quickly turned it off
[1:00:18] and closed my laptop. I didn't
[1:00:20] understand what was happening. I was not
[1:00:23] in church for six or seven years.
[1:00:26] He was out doing drugs, money, women.
[1:00:31] I thought I went insane. I didn't know
[1:00:33] why I turned on a message. It was like
[1:00:35] it's not me. Then I started to think
[1:00:37] about my life. I remember the 13 year
[1:00:40] olds of mine
[1:00:42] when I gave my life to God. Isn't that
[1:00:44] just like the prodigal? I remembered,
[1:00:46] oh, I've got a dad. I've got a dad who
[1:00:49] could take care of me. I don't have to
[1:00:51] live like this.
[1:00:53] I remembered how I was mocking God. How
[1:00:55] I brought shame on his name with my
[1:00:57] behavior. I remember that once I loved
[1:00:59] him, but I left him. I left him to go
[1:01:02] sin and spit on him by the sinful things
[1:01:05] that I did intentionally to mock
[1:01:07] Christians. Then I felt something
[1:01:09] strange. I felt like there's somebody
[1:01:11] else in the room with me. Hallelujah.
[1:01:15] Praise God. He leaves the 99 to go get
[1:01:18] the one. Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you,
[1:01:21] Jesus.
[1:01:25] I felt a presence and I heard a voice in
[1:01:27] my heart. You did all these things to
[1:01:30] mock me and went far in sin, but you're
[1:01:32] still my son and I'm waiting for you in
[1:01:35] the crossroad where you left me.
[1:01:38] Hallelujah. Glory to God. I felt his
[1:01:41] overwhelming love. See, church, that's
[1:01:44] what that's what wins souls is God's
[1:01:46] divine love.
[1:01:48] What's going to help you overcome any
[1:01:49] guilt or condemnation? The love of Jesus
[1:01:52] Christ. Didn't David say that? Thy
[1:01:54] loving kindness is better than life.
[1:02:01] This was too much for me. I broke. I
[1:02:04] fell on my knees and cried for
[1:02:05] forgiveness.
[1:02:07] Afterwards, I told him, "Lord Jesus, you
[1:02:09] know that I want to go to you, but this
[1:02:11] chains of drugs are holding me. If you
[1:02:15] if you help me to get free from it, I
[1:02:17] promise I will serve you in all of my
[1:02:19] life.
[1:02:25] God set me free in that very moment.
[1:02:29] Since I stood up from that prayer, I
[1:02:30] didn't have any desire for drugs. That
[1:02:33] was eight years ago. I threw all my
[1:02:35] drugs in the trash. I deleted everything
[1:02:38] that was connected me to the world. My
[1:02:41] first way was to my brother who is my
[1:02:44] pastor now.
[1:02:47] And church, look at that. He deleted and
[1:02:48] got rid of everything that would tempt
[1:02:50] him. So if the if the phone's causing
[1:02:53] you trouble, get a different phone.
[1:02:56] If the computer's causing you trouble,
[1:02:57] get rid of that. Whatever's causing you
[1:03:00] trouble, get rid of sin. Amen.
[1:03:07] My brother, I went to see my brother. He
[1:03:08] was shocked to see me in the late night.
[1:03:10] He opened the door and I told him, "I
[1:03:11] want to pray with him." He couldn't
[1:03:13] believe what he heard.
[1:03:16] I said, "I told you I want you to pray
[1:03:18] with me. I want to be a Christian like
[1:03:20] you are." Needless to say, we prayed and
[1:03:22] cried together from the joy that God
[1:03:24] gave a miracle in my life.
[1:03:27] Later, I went home and took all my
[1:03:29] sinful stuff outside, poured gasoline on
[1:03:31] it, and lit it on fire. Hallelujah.
[1:03:34] Sounds like the book of Acts when they
[1:03:36] took all those witchcraft books and burn
[1:03:38] it.
[1:03:41] All my worldly clothes, all the things
[1:03:43] that connected me with the world now was
[1:03:46] burning. I still not can tell I still
[1:03:48] cannot tell this story without tears in
[1:03:50] my eyes.
[1:03:52] Thank you, Jesus. He said, 'I can give
[1:03:54] thanks for everything. What I have only
[1:03:57] to God. He took my addiction, restored
[1:04:00] my life, gave me back my family,
[1:04:02] parents, gave me a wife,
[1:04:06] and now we expect our second baby very
[1:04:09] soon.
[1:04:11] He gave me a little humble ministry also
[1:04:13] so I can serve him. So, I don't know
[1:04:14] what he does, but he does some type of
[1:04:16] ministry for God.
[1:04:19] Hallelujah.
[1:04:21] He is my everything. So when it comes to
[1:04:23] the message in the gospel, I know what
[1:04:26] power is there.
[1:04:28] A simple gospel, hearing about the blood
[1:04:30] and the sacrifice of Jesus can save
[1:04:32] sinners.
[1:04:34] It can clean a person and fill him with
[1:04:35] his Holy Ghost. For me, there's no
[1:04:38] greater thing than that.
[1:04:43] I believe that Jesus can do the same
[1:04:45] thing today that he did for me. And
[1:04:47] that's why it's so important to spread
[1:04:48] that message and keep it clean how it's
[1:04:50] told. You do a great job for it and now
[1:04:53] you know why I appreciate it so much.
[1:04:56] Sorry for the long message. Well,
[1:04:57] brother, I'm gonna say you don't have to
[1:04:59] apologize. It's bringing tears to my
[1:05:00] eyes. I want to say thank you. Don't
[1:05:03] apologize. Thank you for this message.
[1:05:06] It was on my heart to tell you.
[1:05:09] He said, "I'm also interested in your
[1:05:10] book, Restoring Christian Modesty. How
[1:05:12] can I get it?" Let's give the Lord a
[1:05:15] round of applause. Praise God.
[1:05:16] Hallelujah.
[1:05:18] Church, we sang about the blood tonight.
[1:05:21] The blood did this. The blood can take
[1:05:24] someone who's close to death and bring
[1:05:27] them back to life. How many thankful for
[1:05:30] that? If God can forgive that man,
[1:05:34] everybody put your hands on your head,
[1:05:35] feel your hairs, 100,000. If God can
[1:05:38] forgive him of
[1:05:40] eight years, I'm sorry, you know, seven
[1:05:42] years of sins like that and take every
[1:05:45] every desire away, surely God can take
[1:05:48] our desires for sin away as well. Do you
[1:05:50] believe that? Let's bow our heads.
[1:05:54] Keep the live stream on there. Let's
[1:05:55] pray for the live streamers. God bless
[1:05:56] our live streamers. Live streamers, if
[1:05:59] there's any addiction or any trap or
[1:06:01] snare you're fighting, Jesus can deliver
[1:06:03] you tonight.
[1:06:06] Maybe
[1:06:08] Maybe be like the the one the man who
[1:06:10] got on his knees
[1:06:12] and just prayed a humble prayer. I don't
[1:06:14] want to live like this. I want to be
[1:06:16] free.
[1:06:17] The blood of Jesus Christ can set each
[1:06:19] person free.
[1:06:21] Hallelujah.
[1:06:25] Let's pray. Father God, we thank you for
[1:06:27] tonight. Lord God, we've seen again how
[1:06:29] our iniquities can be so great, but yet
[1:06:31] your grace is greater. Hallelujah. Your
[1:06:35] grace is enough. Hallelujah, Jesus.
[1:06:39] Lord, thank you for this testimony, this
[1:06:41] brother. Lord, it just reminds me again
[1:06:43] similar to brother Austin.
[1:06:48] Lord, it reminds me of my life when I
[1:06:50] ran from you, Lord God, in certain
[1:06:51] avenues.
[1:06:54] Lord, how amazing is the loving kindness
[1:06:56] of Almighty God? I love what he said. It
[1:07:00] was the love of God that changed
[1:07:01] everything. A presence came in the room.
[1:07:04] Lord, may your presence come in the
[1:07:05] rooms now, Lord, of those live
[1:07:07] streaming.
[1:07:08] If they're willing to acknowledge their
[1:07:11] sin
[1:07:13] and not hide it from you and confess it,
[1:07:15] well, then surely your love is there to
[1:07:16] forgive them.
[1:07:20] Lord, I pray for our church in this
[1:07:22] physical place. God, may we not hide our
[1:07:24] sins. May we confess our sins. And God
[1:07:26] is faithful and just to forgive us of
[1:07:29] all unrighteousness.
[1:07:33] The blood will never lose its power.
[1:07:36] Hallelujah. Jesus, bless this brother.
[1:07:38] Lord, may his wife have this healthy
[1:07:40] second baby. Lord God, thank you for
[1:07:42] giving him ministry. Strengthen him in
[1:07:44] his ministry. Lord God,
[1:07:50] keep us all humble. Lord, keep us
[1:07:52] constantly confessing our sins,
[1:07:53] acknowledging our sin, trusting in the
[1:07:55] grace of God. Give us days where we can
[1:07:57] raise our heads and say, "Thank you,
[1:07:59] God, for the power to overcome
[1:08:01] And Lord, on the days where we might
[1:08:03] hang our heads low, God, give us an
[1:08:05] encouraging word. Strengthen us somehow,
[1:08:07] Lord. We know you will. You won't let
[1:08:08] our enemies triumph over us. Hallelujah.
[1:08:10] As David said,
[1:08:13] I believe the Psalmist also said,
[1:08:15] "You're the lifter of my head.
[1:08:18] You're my glory and the lifter of my
[1:08:21] head." Lord Jesus,
[1:08:24] for anyone who needs sins confessed, I
[1:08:26] pray they'll confess them tonight so
[1:08:28] they can be forgiven. And Lord, may we
[1:08:29] go here with a greater appreciation for
[1:08:31] your forgiveness
[1:08:33] as we see David battling iniquity and
[1:08:36] getting the victory.
[1:08:39] We thank you, God, for your mercy and
[1:08:40] grace. Bless your people now with
[1:08:43] forgiveness in Jesus Christ's name. And
[1:08:45] the saints said,
