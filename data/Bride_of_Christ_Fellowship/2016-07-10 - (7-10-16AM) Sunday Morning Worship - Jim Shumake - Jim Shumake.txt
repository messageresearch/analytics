as well amen for God's safety upon them and God's purpose should be done Glory Glory any other requests I have a testimony it's a it's encouraging we had a an accident on our little farm and uh we had a my son and my wife was trying to hook up the finishing mower that we pulled behind our our big tractor if anyone's familiar with the finishing mower it's a it's a five foot wide finishing mower it's pretty big and uh they're hooking it up trying to get hooked up and they uh sometimes when you hook them up you got to bump the PTO so it spins the PTO shaft so you can get the tracker shaft and the and the Implement shaft lined up because they're splines and they go on engaging in each other So Lisa was down there trying to get it on Elijah's up on the tractor she said go ahead and bump it and they went and bumped it know apparently a cat was under there under the mower they didn't know it so it had spun it engaged the the blades and went turned on and hit the cat and threw it out the out the uh ejected it out the finishing low you know they shot out there and it was like seemed like it was almost dead so they quickly prayed for the thing and it's going fine now yeah she called me up and said this cat's dead we hit it accidentally I think it's going to die you know was like all curled up you know it it defecated everything all the signs that it was going to die and uh so I said you know did you pray for it they said yeah we prayed for it right away so that was a good thing to do now the cat's doing fine healing up fine I you know God grace right amen a little kitten too so didn't have much a chance against that mower I'll tell you that but God does amen God all things are possible so let's with that take that encouragement to our Lord in prayer he cares about the kittens on a farm he certainly cares about his sons and daughters so let's go before him in reverence here Lord Jesus we thank you Lord God for this time of prayer this time of gathering Lord God how we're reminded that life is sacred Lord how even the example on my little farm here where a cat was Lord struck by the blades of a mower where that cat had no chance Lord but father you know how we value life and we know you value life Lord God we know that father when that tragedy happened that cat was hit and ejected out Lord the first things on our mind was prayer and going to our God because you're more than able we didn't know what to do Lord we couldn't really do anything for the cat Lord whatever internal injuries it sustained and Lord God whatever broken bones it might have had Lord God no matter what the cases you came on the scene and you were the Great position of that cat Lord so we thank you Lord Jesus and how we're reminded Lord by this example to Value life and to bring all life before you and to let you be our Lord and savior and King Lord for you can govern and rule over all things even the very laws of physics Lord the laws that Set This World In Motion you govern over those Lord and when they're contrary to your will you override them Lord thank you Lord Jesus so for all these requests Lord God where we come against for the natural laws that are against us here Lord God whether it be in our health or body or mind Lord father you can override these things Lord the tragedies and the health problems the Mind battles Lord God the psychological problems and issues Lord it doesn't matter what these natural laws are in place that are against us Lord it doesn't matter Lord You're the God of all of those Lord You've created those actual laws Lord so father you can override them in our case we're your sons and daughters Lord we're asking you Lord Jesus to meet our needs here Lord we're asking for miracles Lord we're asking that you would move upon the scene Lord Jesus that you would show your Mighty spirit and your presence is far greater than anything natural Lord anything in this natural realm Lord God and even anything in the spirit spiritual realm Lord You're The King and ruler so we bring these before you Lord for this prayer request for Todd Bennett Lord may help him in his surgery Lord again Lord God whatever variables might be against his body Lord whatever the situation is you can certainly govern Lord you can have your way Lord Jesus just like the unsaved loved ones this fles Lord this is a spiritual battle Lord here for them may you meet their needs Lord and come and show them that you're God you're the ruler of all creation you can save them Lord and you can bring them to an enlightened State Lord to see your word and see your presence Lord yes help those unsaved loved ones Lord for our little brothers Alex and Winston Lord help them with the rash Lord again Lord the laws of nature Lord are against them Lord God their body is reacting in a certain way to whatever more might be affecting them in a negative way but you can certainly come Lord and be that anointing Lord that that uh that medicine Lord that comes Lord and just hovers over them Lord God and just brings them back to Hell Lord so may you do so Lord For Your Glory we pray and ask for this request Lord having compassion upon them Lord for our sister Wendy's request Lord God may you be with you with that as well Lord Jesus our brother Craig Lord God and those that are traveling as well as she had mentioned Lord Jesus may your will be done Lord may you protect them may your mercy and Grace Be With You Lord for our brother amen request Lord God those a person who needs your help touching Healing Touch Lord may you meet his needs right there and our brother Jose Lord God who says there's innumerable adversity at his doorstep Lord father we're thankful that you are infinite which is greater than numerous infinite is greater than any number we can think of Lord or conceive it's greater than any number we can't conceive that comes against us Lord and we're thank you for that Lord we're thankful for because you are infinite Lord nothing can contain you nothing can bottle you up nothing can box you Lord nothing can limit you nothing can stop you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus for being infinite Limitless Lord yes yes come and meet all these needs here Lord so Lord we bring these things again before you anything else that we might be missing here in in spoken word may you Lord meet those needs Lord may you help us to bring them to remembrance Lord as we thank on these things Lord for your word says whatever is pure and holy honest just Lord think on these things and we are thinking just now Lord we're bringing that world of thought that mind battle Lord into subjection Lord we're claiming the victory right now full over it Satan can't have this ground because you already have it Lord you've already conquered it Lord you're already the Lord and ruler of this ground of this flesh of this mind Lord so we bring it into subjection in Jesus name yes that's who we are thank you Lord for making us your very essence Lord

so let's give them round Applause God Lord God for his mercy and his love there we'll have brother Jim come just a moment but I just want to say a few things you know since I met Brother Jimmy's always been such a fine Brother you know to me and such a wonderful F kind of like a mentor to me you know and a real a real servant uh been a real friend to me all the way back since 2008 when we met and uh I was just thinking the other day how it's been too long since we seen him and uh uh just been such a real strength to me you know there so many times you can ask my wife how many times I've talked about how brother Jim just been such a a friend that I needed you know many many times so I really thank God for that and I've been able to ask over years of asked many questions that a pastor might asked you know different doctrinal things you know and always had wonderful faithful counsel from him and I thank God for that but there's one thing about brother Jim you know he's got he's got Eternal fruit in our little assembly I think back in 2009 when he preached at our garage back there in North akaran on Mo Drive uh he preached that message about sighing and crying for the Abominations and uh my sister-in-law sister Beth came up for pray prayer afterwards and was weeping and her tears were hitting the concrete floor we didn't have carpet you know and she was weeping s crying for her sister Barb and two years later Barb got saved and she goes to brother Cam's church now been faithful there for many many years and she quit smoking when I came and preach and she heard the word and she said I was delivered you know and so uh God you know puts us all together for a purpose I thank God you know that uh that we can see Eternal fruit eternal life salvation and that's such a tremendous fruit know God has allowed brother gy to have in our ministry so we thank God for that and we're so thankful it means the world to me it means the world to me so very thankful for that uh you know yesterday I just get closing up now just a few things I want to say we're at a a family wedding and um it's so awful to see the condition the world's in but it's so glorious as everybody else is you know they're popping champagne and popping beers and we look over here our little Christian section over here and they're all you know faithfully and hum nobody's laughing at the sin everybody's just you know trying to uh you know in our hearts pray and meditate and and then you go from that atmosphere you know and even in that atmosphere I'm talking to my cousin he's thanking me for my walk with the Lord and you know just sharing all these testimonies and I felt the presence of God come down in the midst of that I start crying you know just talking about the Lord so Jesus comes wherever you want to talk about it we can be we can be around all that worldliness but we can be totally separ we can be shut in with Christ amen and I just want to say I'm so thankful for this message praise God aren't you thankful for it amen oh it's us that's why my heart was you just pray for my lost loved ones that God would save them and I'm praying as well and uh God will do it if we believe amen so very thankful for that let's stand and sing number 120 I Just Want to Thank You Lord for letting me hear this word praise God aren't you glad to hear this word oh my what a blessing this message of the hour oh changed my life I telling the Sunday school kids it's just changed my life it's it's been a life to me and uh it's it's it's all we need by God's grace because it's God's word for the S you didn't have to Open Eyes brother Jim comes here praise God you didn't have to open my eyes could have easily passed me by all the age I was [Music] for [Music] your [Applause] m Glory [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] glor even in my [Applause] my Jesus as the of the I but [Music] now for let me your [Music] [Applause] [Music] word GL [Applause] I was amazed when I was sitting in the back room there I heard brother John start to sing some songs uh been a long time since I've been here and heard brother John lead song was was a blessing sitting back there but uh he had no idea what I want to speak of this morning but God did and and that always amazes me you know and uh sometimes people come to our church and they'll Minister the word of God and somebody will come up to me and say did you talk to him before he came I said no I think the Holy Ghost was talking amen and sometimes I'll preach maybe some of the same messages I preached just the week before or something like that it's just amazing but brother John Sang a a song back there he said thank God I am free free free and I thought to myself brother John didn't know I I wanted to speak on being free this morning so he had to sing a song I was gonna sing a song when I come up here because uh sometimes that helps me not feel quite as nervous I was gonna think I'm so glad that Jesus Set Me Free but I thought well brother John's already singing about being glad he set free I guess I won't have to but amen sometimes amen we we don't really appreciate the fact that we are free appreciate the freedom that God has given us in him and uh some sometimes that's a that's a terrible tragedy that we just let that freedom amen go unappreciated I don't want that to happen this morning so I want to minister word if I could have been preaching a series at home at the home Church on being more than a conqueror amen amen if you have your Bibles I'd like to read that scripture just to get started amen and maybe uh that's not the scripture I want to preach on but to get an idea I've been preaching this series of being more than a conqueror and um in this series uh it's more than a conquer by uh by knowing his word and more than a conquer by and different things that makes us more than a conqueror and uh I thought when I preached it the first time I had I did had a little more than I wanted to speak so I went ahead and preached another message number two in that series and I thought that would finish it off I then last uh Wednesday night I preached number 16 and and I don't think there's anything uh there's there's no ending spot in the Conquering power of our Lord Andor Jesus Christ what he's done for us and I was listening to Brother John testify about the prayer in the prayer before your prayer service and and how God is able and he's he's concerned about every little thing amen yes and he's more than able to cure and to heal and to deliver and I want to peek on that this morning if I can if you have your bibl turn with to Romans the 8th chapter I'm sure we're all familiar with the scripture but I would like to just go over it amen it said Romans 8:35 Romans 8:35 good to see yall again to see brother bang haven't seen him I see some faces I recognize and some faces that I don't recognize but I'm sure some of you don't know me know who I am but that's all right God knows who I am that's the one I'm really concerned about yes sir I always love to meet new people make new friends and I pray something I'll be said this morning it'll be a blessing to you brother Jesse said he gets counsel for me I think it's really the other way around amen I never met a young man like brother Jesse uh who has such a grip on this message and uh every time I listen to him every time he comes and preaches for us I learned something and I said wow that's something I wish I I wish I had know that I wish I could have said that or I wish i' have thought of that and uh you know brother Jesse's a teacher I think we all know he he teaches in the natural but I believe he's more of a teacher in the spiritual than anything I've learned quite a bit from Jesse and from his ministry and I appreciate him so much and uh you are very fortunate that God sent you a man like that Amen to Pastor your church and uh he's always been a blessing in my life and I thank you for the opportunity to be here with you this morning amen so if you have your Bibles this morning read real quick Romans 8:35 it says who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation how many have had some tribulation maybe me shall distress none of us are having any stress D persecution famine nakedness pearl sword as is written for last sake we are killed all the day long and we are counted as sheep for the slaughter they in all these things Paul says we are more than a conqueror amen now it means something to be a conqueror amen but that's the guy who goes out and he wins the battle that's the Conqueror but the Bible says here that we are more than a conqueror what's it mean to be more than a conqueror I don't have time to preach that message I won't get to the one I want to preach this morning but I preached that when we had his first thought but you know the Conqueror is the one that conquer amen and wins the battle and wins you the victory amen we know that one did that for us amen his name is Christ Jesus we know he did that for us 2,000 years ago but then he made us more than a conqueror amen he made us possessors of what he had conquered possessors of what he had already went ahead and purchased for us so he said we're more than conquerors and I am persuaded Paul says that neither death nor life nor angels no principalities no powers nor things present nor things to come nor height or depth or any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus Paul had a revelation that he could say I am persuaded I know beyond the shadow of a doubt and you know what the problem with the bride of Christ is sometimes we are not persuaded sometimes we don't really know who we are sometimes we don't realize amen we are more than conquerors in him this morning I want to preach on that along that line this morning but uh with that thought in mind I want to preach a message this morning I saw I just said being set more than conquerors by being set free how many are glad you're free this morning thank God I'm free free free from this world of sinl what was it to set me free the Conqueror amen Set Me Free shed his blood on Calvary that I can know Freedom this morning that's something to Rejoice about Hallelujah we ought to be the most rejoicing people I like our brother here that sang the song Amen he got he got something to thank God for amen he's thanking for all these things we all ought to have that Heart of Thanksgiving when we realize what God has done for us we realize amen all the blessings that are ours this morning every Redemptive blessing has already been purchased for us through the blood of Jesus Christ how many say Amen to that so that thought in mind this morning again if you have your Bibles amen uh St John chapter 8 amen the verse I want to speak on Amen it's okay if I take off my coat and I don't I don't work good in a coat and I just plan on doing a little battle with the Enemy this morning so I don't fight C on either so uh if you have your Bible St John chapter 8 verse 31 you love the Lord this morning good to see sister Megan and children there God Winnie Al Hannah then it's always good to see home Folk amen and uh prise God and uh just thank God that they are worshiping God and and God is feeding them and they're doing well man look at them kids grow it's always a blessing to see them Hallelujah so if you have your Bibles there St John 8:31 everybody have it say amen amen and Jesus and then said Jesus to the Jews which believed on him I want you to notice who it is Jesus is talking to he's talking to Believers yeah he says if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free what is that makes us tree it's knowing the truth how do you know the truth by continuing in his word those thoughts in mind this morning Jesus said we be and the Jews said and they answered said we be Abraham seed we never were in bondage to any man how sayest thou he shall be made free and Jesus answered them verily very I saying whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth amen if the son therefore shall make you free he shall be free indeed amen how many want to be free indeed this morning let's just ask God to bless his word Heavenly Father we thank you for your word this morning what it means to us we pray Lord God that you take this worthy unworthy vessel Lord God to speak through my lips words that would encourage this portion of the body of Christ this morning Lord God we surely don't want to say anything would hurt anyone but father how we need sometime just to be maybe reminded of who we are what we are in Christ Jesus that we are more than conquerors Lord that the enemy do no longer have us held in bondage father but father we ask this morning as we look into your word is simple thought Lord God not great deep teachings but Lord God something that would help us realize amen our position in Christ this morning we pray Lord God that you be with those who aren't here whatever the reason might be we keep them from the house of God maybe they're sick and body maybe there's a problem that they having father we ask that you would go and Minister unto them in a special way Lord be with the home church this morning as brother Matt ministers the word of God in my place father I pray that you would just bless him and make him a blessing to those that come and to receive from your word Lord God have your way here in this service this morning amen guard my lips lest I say one thing that's contrary to the word but let all things be said to edify this portion of the body of Christ to lift us just a little bit higher in Christ Jesus we now Commit This Time and people and myself and your hand Lord God ask your perfect will be done in Jesus name amen you can be seated this morning you love him amen amen last week I said I want to speak G amen uh uh more than conquerors by being set free amen being set free uh by knowing the truth by knowing the truth the word of God says you'll know the truth and the truth will make you free and last week I was studying in a in a study there it was on a Saturday evening and and there's a lot going on U you know last weekend how many knows what last weekend was 4th of July 4th of July everybody was celebrating the 4th of July I was while everybody was celebrating the 4th of ju I was in my study and I was studying I was getting lost in this thought and I was trying to get myself together for Sunday morning and all of a sudden I heard all this racking like boom bam I thought I thought a bomb went off outside the house and I thought what in the world I jumped up I'm my mind's not even thinking about the 4th of July and my and all of a sudden I up and I head out the door and my wife I said what in the world she said it's fireworks and we lived like two miles from town and you could hear the fireworks like they were in my backyard and it was boom bang boom and I stepped out you know I I stepped out the door and you could see them above the trees it just this and then as I heard the noise fade away and then I heard the I heard this yeah yeah people were screaming I thought what in the world they acted like a bunch of crazy like what in the world is going on but you know what it was amen they were celebrating something that happened like 240 years ago they were out there celebrating the fact that amen they had been set free amen they were under a tradical government if you would amen from from Great Britain or England amen and and there they were they were being they were being held down they were being they were being held under the thumb they were held they were being being treated unfairly they were being oppressed amen and afflicted by a government and I thought to myself that's exactly like the Bride of Jesus Christ was but you know why these people were celebrating they were out there they were shouting they were jumping they were hauling they were clapping their hands amen every time one of those things that go off boom like that they yell a little bit more and get real excited and I thought wow I said if they can get that excited Amy man because 240 years years ago ever what it was amen that that some Sons of Liberty shed their blood on this American soil that I might know Freedom amen I thought how much more are we to celebrate the fact that the Son of God come and shed his life's blood and set us free amen 2,000 years ago that's something to celebrate about but church not just on a Friday night or a Saturday night or the Fourth of July that it ought to be a celebration in our hearts every day amen amen and I thought to myself why are these people because they know they're set free amen they know that they're free American citizens they know they're sons of this country amen and all the freedom this country affords them is theirs amen amen how many knows that therefore they had their hands in the air they were rejoicing they were eating they was they was partying they was demonstrating anden the great joy that was in him for something that happened 240 years ago amen that really if you start to look at it amen it's not going to be long but that same tyrannical government spirit is start to coming right back in and trying to hold them back down amen oh it might not be Britain amen but it's still a brother BR said it'll be a three-fold cord amen political satanical spiritual power will come in and begin to hold that bride try to hold that bride down amen and if you don't know that you're free you know what it'll hold you down you won't be able to rejoice yes he knows that to be the truth amen and you know what we come to church on a Sunday morning amen and I don't see no fireworks going off is it okay if I if I move around I can hold still when I pr but you know we don't see any fireworks going off right you know when I pulled in this morning I knew I was in the right place because I see brother John picking up the mail I've never been to the this new church amen last time I was here it was over on waterl or whatever it was yes sir amen but you know I I couldn't find a place I should have been able to find a place John should have out there setting a firework off what do you sell John I'm free he's out I said good morning brother good morning said how you doing good to see but you know what why aren't we all the time excited about the fact that I've been set free amen and I thought that myself 2,000 years ago amen a son of Liberty a Son of God come and set me free he shed his life's Blood on the soil man that I might know Freedom amen sometimes I get out of bed and sometimes I don't even thank him for right right I Just Want to Thank You Lord amen for letting me hear a word and then why because the word he said you're going to know the truth what is the truth the word is truth and he says that the truth will set you free I want to speak on that this morning if I can amen so if you continue in my word then are you my decip IES indeed amen and you shall know the truth if you're going to have to to know the truth you're going to have to continue in the word amen now that word amen continue it's a it's a Greek word I believe it is I don't have it I think it's a Greek word a Greek or Hebrew word amen I I cut that top of the page off when I printed somehow I'm not good at this kind of stuff I don't do this computer stuff too well amen mean that's why my notes are on a piece of paper not an iPad man I'm old school I'm old and of course I don't have to tell you that you can tell by looking amen but he says that word amen to continue means to be held to kept continually to continue to be Amen to survive or to live in I believe it says over I in him we live and move and have our being in it me to continue in the word not just hit it on Sunday not just hit it on Wednesday but that word should ever be in your heart ever left ever before your mind and I like what I read out there sit at the pastor's desk and made a little thing there on front he said before you make any decision before you make any move man you ought to ask God is this what you want that's continuing in the word amen it's going to keep you from being bound by something you don't want to be in Hallelujah says so when you do that he says you're going to know the truth and the truth shall make you free church amen we ought to we ought to be rejoicing as much as those people were in the city of Al the other day because we've been made free the only reason we find out that we're not amen the onlyon we see people that are not we find that we don't always is because maybe we don't really realize that we are actually free right right right you say well wait a second brother Jim I know we've been I know I'm set free and then I know you do it then why don't you act like if I know if I know that I'm free from sin why don't I act like it I know I'm free from sickness why don't I act like that why know I'm free from turmoil and all all this unrest why don't I act like it why do I allow that devil to come here and hold me down sometimes but that purchase possession has already been bought it's already mine it was bought 200 years ago by the son of Goden when he spilled his last blood on Cal he set me free amen how you know that the word says so Hallelujah now I can continue in the word and know that it'll Set Me Free but if I don't continue in that word if I don't stay in that word that word sometimes has a way of getting stale how many know that to be the truth that's why I don't see how people can stay out of church two and three weeks and and not get stale amen it doesn't happen it does guess you didn't tell me to say that amen but church if you if you are here every time the doors are open something's wrong you will get stale you will begin to Wayne Amen that that knowledge of the truth will begin to be a little bit more distance from youbody knows that to me the truth but the Bible says you shall know the truth what's it mean to know the truth what's it mean to know the truth again this is a Greek word it's a I probably won't pronounce it right it's gesco gesco something like that it means to know to understand to perceive or have a knowledge or a revelation of have a revelation of to understand to know amen I like is it said to the Greeks this meant to know facts amen you know we read this amen this scripture amen he says you're going to know the truth and the truth will set you free yes the truth isn't just a bunch of facts the truth is a reality the truth is a life that word is a living word amen it said to know to the Greeks it meant to know facts but these facts may or may not affect one's conduct now we know I know I know beond the sh of up it's a fact that Jesus Christ shed his life's blood to set me free 2,000 years ago but the question is do I really know it or is it like a Greek a heathen do I just have an intellectual conception that he set me free there's a big difference Church it says here to the Greeks have meant to know that those facts may or may not affect one's conduct right right now it may affect my conduct it may make me shout it make me Rejoice but it may make me say oh Lord what am I going to do now oh Lord I just don't know which way to turn oh Lord you know what that is that's because it's not really known just it's not really understood it hasn't become a revelation to you it said that's the way it was to the Greeks but to the Jews the believer the true knowledge always manifested itself in one's conduct this word says ye shall know truly to know not just have an intellectual conception that God Is A Healer you've got to experience that healing you got to know it for yourself if you know Salvation am it's because you experience salvation you realize what it felt like he sent from that Old Devil he no longer has you under his th there's fireworks going off hallelujah amen he said oh he said to Jew true knowledge always manifest himself one conduct he said one did not know something to the Jew there's God's chosen people he said one did not know something until that fact had a practical outworking in that person's life amen if you're going to know a truth that will set you free it's got to have a practical outworking in your life say Amen to that Amen brother B made this statement I want to read it here this morning found the unconditional Covenant God made with the people is it okay to read these words yes sir I believe God sent a prophet am you know what I was so messed up before I got the word of God that a prophet sent that I was preaching this and I was preaching that but the prophet of God come along and it wasn't his interpretation it was the spirit of God through him that made this word of God live so I kind of try to stay close to what the prophet said yes sir yes sir had a guy tell me one time he said you come he said I have issue with something that you said this weekend I said okay come on in the office we'll talk about it he said you said I said oh he said yeah you said this I said no I didn't I was reading quote boy it got real quiet I said no I didn't say that I was just reading a quote amen that's what the prophet said now if you have an issue you don't have an issue with me you have an issue with the prophet I got my oh that's I'm glad I have it on notes I got it said did I say uh did I say I found a weak spot of Pentecost and me that I didn't say that that day but that's what I'm want to say here in a minute right right say well brother there no weak spot in this message left out what the prophet said right right so I read sometimes I read from the quotes amen it keeps me out of trouble not that I can't make a mistake and don't amen right right but I pray every time I said Lord God guard my lips lest I should say something that's contrary to the word amen amen you know what I believe God ansers prayer yes amen I make mistakes and sometimes I have to go back and correct them but it's not too often you know why because God answered prayer I say God guard my lips he guards my lips I believe God how many believe God answered prayer this morning am that's the way we all be with everything we do Hallelujah he said I found a weak spot in the Pentecost amen he says you don't know who you areen I could take that and not say Pentecost I found a weak spot in the message sometimes we don't know who we are say Amen to that amen we don't know who we are see if you only realize the position you have in heaven tonight there'd be something take place here tonight uhhuh he said uhhuh see see he says every I put down every Redemptive blessing is already ours amen as a freed son they were purchased amen 2,000 years ago at Calvary amen and I can say like Paul none of these things are going to move me I am persuaded amen no matter what it is whether it's death or persecution or problems or or or or turmoil in my life those things amen I've already been conquered amen yes they are already under the blood they have already been overcome by Jesus Christ now all I have to do is realize that realize that Glory he said here he said oh if You' only realize the position you have in heaven tonight there would be something take place here tonight you know what it would be it would be fireworks it would be shout you said well what are you so what are you so shouting about I said I know the truth and the truth say even though it looks like I'm sick even though this situation looks real bad and me that situation is already overcome I'm set free from that no power the Bible says he says the Bible said now are you the sons of God not will be right now how many sons of gods of God we have here this morning when did you become a son and daughter of God you always were amen but there was a time when you became placed as that son when that adoption took place when you were born again that spirit of God come down amen and he put that robe of adoption Upon Us amen made us sons of God and we appear to be doing just exactly what he was doing amen I know that to be the truth amen he said now are you the sons of God not will be right now you're the sons of God right now you're seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Hallelujah somebody say amen amen but the problem is we we we know that we read it here but we just have a head knowledge until it has it practical outworking in our lives and then we don't really know it he doesn't really set us free he says that's the problem because you don't realize who you what your position is he says he said when you can think now instead not not sometime far off amen he's quoting the scripture he said and it's found over here and I get ahead of myself sometimes he said beloved now are we the sons of God 1 John 3:2 he said it do not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear me how many believe he made an appear yes you know where I see him tonight I see him sitting back there I see him sitting here and here and here he made an appear he's coming he's taken up his Tabernacle himself in people Amen in human and what is it it's nothing more than a seed Gene of God it was placed there from amen it was placed there when you were born amen but before the foundation of the world and lay in the dust of the Earth the prophet God said but that seed was a germinated amen when that blood came down at Calvary say Amen to that but he said one day that seed come under the influence of that spirit and he said it begin to come forth it begin to it begin to it begin to live amen yes until that it would just a a word seed laying there amen that's the way that a lot of this word is to us as Believers it's just a word seed laying there but all of a sudden when it starts to catch and that that Spirit begin to Quicken that word he said he said what do we see appearing we don't see brother Jim appearing we see him appear when he shall appear we're going to be just like him for we shall see him as he is I want to be able to see him as he is this morning I don't want to see him as he is in Jesse I want to see him as he is living right here in me right there my wife said oh I found a weak spot he said we're sons of God but when you think now we are sons of God said now we are the sons of God not th yet appear we shall be when he shall appear we shall be like him he says it's not some place off in the future Christ Jesus is tabernacled here on Earth now amen amen amen showing his great manifestation of his Blessing and Power Willing that everyone should be saved everyone should be healed none should have to have you said none should have to have a prayer line amen how many say Amen to that amen he said oh you shouldn't have to have a prayer line he says everyone should be saved none should perish I tell you if that really if you really fathomed that in your mind you wouldn't have to pray for the sick it would all be over he said because he says you have but first for that to take place you have to see it first amen you have to see it first amen and he said now that word see it's not the word like you and I look at it's not the word see it doesn't mean uh to see something with a natural eye necessarily but it means to understand amen it's the same thing he says do you know the word do you understand the word yes had become a personal revelation to you amen he says oh he says it doesn't mean that you can see it it it's certainly it's it's it's not that you have to see it with the natural eye he said but he said if you have to have to see it first and you can't see it you certainly can't see it or understand it if you can't see it you know how the prophet talks back and forth he said now the word see doesn't mean to look at he says the word see doesn't mean look the word see means to understand that's right like Jesus told Nicodemus he said except you be born again you can't even see the kingdom of God how many knows he said that you know you can stand here and and you could try to explain to me computers and and all this stuff here I keep seeing somebody moving over there it's me and uh I don't know how that works I don't understand understand it and you know what I can say but I can see it right but Jesse said well let me show you how this works and let me tell you how this works and he could he could stand there and tell me said you push this button you push that button and it goes in there and your picture comes out on that screen I said I don't see it I don't see it I can see it but I don't understand what he's talking about right let me say Amen to that right who knows what he's how how many knows what I'm talking about yes yes and I just don't see what you're I don't understand it in other words not that I can't see with my natural eyes that's the same thing he was telling Nicodemus but Nicodemus couldn't understand what he was saying he was what brother brand referring to as the scripture over here in St John 3 said there was a man of the Pharisees whose name was Nicodemus the ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know look at what he said we know he had a mental conception he understood with the mind and the natural mind he said we know that thou art a teacher hey man come from God for no man can do these Miracles except God God be with him he said I know that yes yes church I know that 2,000 years ago I was set free amen something to shout about I know that 2,000 years ago Not only was I set free from sin but I was set free from sickness I was set free from sadness I was set free from turmoil I was set free from all that all that on Calvary and I know that but church until that is quickened to me I can read Isaiah 53 all day long but until that is Quicken to me I don't see it I don't understand iten I'll go around sick amen I'll go around depressed amen I'll go around amen uh uh with not knowing which way to go amen yes how many knows it's the truth amen how many ever been there yes amen and he said Jesus he said we know th the teacher come from God Amen for no man can do these Miracles except God be with him and Jesus said in ver say Toto you except a man be born again he can't see the Kingdom of Heaven amen you can't see the kingdom of God excuse me amen so what was he telling Nicodemus he said not that he couldn't see he said but you'll never understand you'll never experience that Kingdom that word Kingdom there is a word aen it's a Greek word I believe it or Hebrew word it's called basilia amen and what it means amen is it means not to be confused with a natural Kingdom amen so to speak but it means a a royal power and it means a a a a authority to rule over a of a king or a domain in this life yes amen that's what it's talking about that King says you'll never know the power of God in your life Nicodemus until you're born again amen somebody say Amen to that here here he had a mind he had a mind understanding of a mental conception but he he didn't know he didn't have what he want he was hungering and thirsting for something that he saw and he knew he didn't have it amen he said he he said and he came to Nicodemus he said how how can a man be born again his old second time there musl see he had didn't have an understanding he said I don't I don't see what you're saying and he could see the word sitting right there he could hear the word talking to it but he said I don't understand it he said except a man be born of the water and of the spirit he can't enter into that kingdom of God you'll never see you'll never enter in it'll never be you'll never have a gra you'll never be a part of it it won't be a part of your life amen he says that which is born to flesh is fleshed that for the spirit Spirit Mar not that I say Toto you that you must be born again amen amen he was telling Nicodemus he says see you can't see it you can't understand it he said you'll never know the truth amen you'll never be set free because you can't see it aen you can't understand he said that word see does me to look at except man be born again you'll not see the Kingdom of Heaven you can't understand it until you're bored again and neither can we he said until you're Bor B again of the spirit amen you can't know you'll never know the freedom you'll never be able to shout when I see people not shouting I see people not rejoicing when they have the truth of this word amen I say unto them they need another refilling of the Holy Ghost spirit you know the Bible say to be filled with the spirit amen you know the Bible says that that doesn't mean one time 20 years ago I remember when that Spirit come down and fill me that means that everyday continual refreshing filling of the Holy Spirit making that word is to continue in that word amen the word says be filled I want it continually every day refreshing infilling of his word to make that word live every day of my life he says you can't until you can't understand it until you're born again by the spirit he said when you're born again you realize what makes the people act as goofy as brother Jim is amen you realize what makes them people shout and glorify God hallelujah I'm free free free yes what's the matter with them if F if what happened 2,200 years ago in the natural makes him sh what this do to the of Christ when they know that he says you have to accept it for yourself it has to be a personal revelation to you yes amen wonderful and he said that Revelation no man can give it to you it has to come by the indwelling of his holy spirit that's why I said I need that Spirit fresh every day amen yes how many say Amen to that praise God when this body receives the spirit of God listen what prophet God says who is this he said when this body receives that spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you listen what he says is inside of you there's an immortal life inside of you how many knows there's only one form of immortal life that's God's life that's a little Jean seed of God down inside he said when you receive the spirit he said this little mortal life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God hallelujah Glory it throws you in subjection to that word amen that that that word says you're free and there's something this body identifies with it says I'm free amen but what does it take to that takes that spirit of God inside to Quicken that word seed brother brand put in I don't have it right here but just popped into my head he said he says you were seed and therefore could be reborn because he says in nonseed there's nothing to Quicken amen he said because you were a seed that that Spirit come down it quickens that word and then you can say hallelujah I'm free said oh what is it he says there you are see it throws the body subject you see your body is subject to the spirit it's no more subject to the things of the world he says they are dead so that means I'm no more subject to that old devil and his worldly devices to hold me under his thumb I'm no longer subject to sickness I'm no longer subject to unbelief I'm no longer subject to the depression and the the mullet grubs that we find ourselves in amen we find ourselves going around all the oh I just wish something was different amen the footstep to the righteous order of the Lord we've got to believe that we've got to move on regardless of what happens what comes what go sickness Health amen problems distress amen the word of God says I've already conquered all that amen and you are possessors of what I've already come but church amen until becom a personal revelation to you through the new birth through that spirit of God Amen you don't really know it and you'll never know what it's like to be set right right now church when we can't Rejoice then it's time to start checking up on our spiritual life is that spirit quickening that word am I abiding in that word like I to he said when you continue in my word then you're my disciples and you shall know the truth you can't know the truth if you don't stay in the truth so it says when you become subject to Spirit and throws the whole body subject that spirit is nothing more but the word seed that seed word made manifest and quickened Hallelujah it been made alive inside of you amen you know that's what it is he said that spirit is nothing more than a quickening of that word seen inside of when that Spirit comes in IND dwells in you it's just a quick and word seed amen that the spirit brings to life and Jesus Christ when he show here will see him just like it will be just like him it's not going to be another seed you know I planted some uh some garden seeds this year and we ate my first squash last night it was delicious but I went out there where I planted that yellow squash and guess what I I went out there and I and I said now where is those cucumbers I didn't look for cucumbers I was looking for yellow spash cuz I planted yellow spash there church you don't have to look for some some other fruits coming forth am me guess what you didn't plant it there amen if there's a seat of God in there it's going to produce God it's going to produce the same thing amen said oh it's nothing more than that little seed word made manifested quick and Hallelujah Made Alive he said and what is it he said it's no more than just the earnest of the Resurrection he said this body will we raised up again because it's already started once it's it was once subject to sin one subject to the m one subject to corruption one subject to that old devil that held him bound but I've been set free hallelujah how by knowing the word yes and it Set Me Free amen is that all right yes glory amen he said oh he says now he says you've turned Heavenly he said that is he's just like a sick person laying here dying he said I've seen them with nothing left but death there's nothing left for him but death he said but guess what when that word of healing is quickened to them by the spirit of God he said I've seen people laying there ate up with cancer breathing their last he says and see them a year later he says and walking around in perfect health he saids what is it he said he said they knew the truth and the truth said by your stripes I'm healed amen and they were set free Hallelujah he says you're that's the earnest money he says you know what it is it's a down payment he was wounded for our transgression Bru for our iniquity by his stripes we are healed notice how wonderful that is amen how many say amen that's wonderful brother amen amen he says you know what it is it say nothing more than the spirit coming down and quickening that word seat and church it's about time that that Spirit began to Quicken this word seed it'll set the bride free long amen the devil hasn't we got the greatest truth we got the greatest word there is in this day amen never never before we had the Revelation that we have in this hour amen and it just becomes unfolding more and more to us amen every once in a while you hear they find another tape another portion of take say oh wow it's just it's just 10 words but maybe it's that last nugget brother Jesse I need amen amen if there's a nugget that I he I'll go back and listen to it again I want to hear more amen amen what is it it's the the spirit quickening that word amen he said that's how you know the truth he said if you're not born again if that Spirit has Quicken you'll never know that word you'll never know that truth he said how many believe that he says see he says you'll never know it you'll never see it he says until you're born again you realize what make then you'll realize what makes you act this way yes he says the word of God says over St John 4:23 the hour come and now is when the true worshipper how many want to be a true worshipper amen he said the true worshipper will worship the father in spirit and in truth yes the spirit and the word are going to come together he said what is it until then it's just so much dead letter the letter kill but the spirit giveth it life amen is that right he said the hour is comeing now is I said that when was that written for I believe that was written for right now because it says now is yes amen now is amen that the true worshipful shall worship the father in spirit and Truth he said God is a spirit they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen so if you're ever going to see this Revelation you have got to have that spirit of God inside of you amen that word is got to have been quickened by that Spirit down on the inside Amen to that until then he says you'll never see it you'll never know what it's like to be free yes when I see people in the bride of Christ amen going around amen under bondage never happy never rejoicing I say they don't know the truth because the word of God won't fail but said if you know the truth the truth will set you free and you know why they don't know the truth he said because you've got to continue in that word well I read that verse 10 times he said go back and read it again if you can't see Jesus Christ every verse go back and read it again again what's the seed that's inside of me it's a seed of Christ down on the inside go back and read it again I want to see it manifested in my life that's continuing in the word that's how you know the word that's how it sets you free Hallelujah the disciples came to Jesus one time you know what to this to to a lot of people in this message there's just so many parables that we don't understand I'm not trying to dechristianize anybody and like I said I pray Lord if I say something wrong your pastor can correct that am and he he's got he's such a there's such a way about him he can do it and just so smooth too that's that's that's that's the gift that God placed in his life but church amen I'm not here to hurt you but you know I wonder sometimes if we really understand or the message just a bunch of Parables to us yes sir yes sir the disciples the ones who followed Jesus Christ amen who followed his word came to him one time said why do you speak to the people in parables you know to the world out there this message is nothing more than a bunch of Parables something that they don't quite understand it's quite there they saying I just can't quite see it yes you know why that is because the spirit of God never quickened it to him right right he says you'll never see it until you're born again he said thees came unto him and he said answer them because it's given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God he says you shall know the truth the word amen the mes you're going to know those he said it's given to you to know but he said to them it's not given right you know church if you understand the mysteries of this message you ought to get up and shout you ought to shout and praise God you been set free because he says it's not given to everybody to know what a privileged people we are amen how we ought to thank God for what he's given us amen yeah he said but he goes on there in the 13th uh verse of that 13th chapter wherefore speak to therefore I speak to them in Parable because they they see see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand a lot of people can see the message they can quote the message they can some people can tie me up in knots with quotes amen right they say well you say brother BR said this what about what he said over here what about what he said over here I said we just don't quite understand that we need to pray for the spirit to make it real to us no I think it's a contradiction that's you know that's because they don't know never quickened it to them amen amen so what he says but it's given to them can see it they can hear it but they don't understand it they don't know it it doesn't do a thing for them well I'm over here rejoicing I've been set free by it they don't understand right right what a privileged people we are to understand amen this is no more than fulfillment of Isaiah which said and hearing you shall hear and not understand and seeing you shall see and you'll not perceive there's a lot of people that have been gifted or or allowed to see this message but they don't understand it that's right there's a lot of people that look at had it so for so long I knew some people real good friends of mine amen and I really loved themen then I I went back to the church I said where's brother soul and so and sister so and so and their daddy come to me and he says I'm not here no more he said just said just too hard just too narrow just too straight broke my heart yes sir yes sir you know what it was it was no more than a parable to them the word had never been quick yeah oh church if you ought to just get up and shout and thank God Amen if you got this message and you saw this message and you held on to this message it's not hard it's not straight Set Me Free that's right the church am it's not given to them to see what a blessed people we are here this morning see you shall see and and they and they don't see it amen for there people is wax gross their hearts are wax gross their ears are full of hearing their eyes are closed less than any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and they should be converted and I should heal them he said she said what is it if they would do all that then the blessings theirs too they'd be set free too but he turned right around to those disciples and he began to speak to them he said but blessed are your ears amen how many you thank God for having blessed ears this morning mine don't work too good anymore I got to have these silly things amen you know what God could that too I believe he to heal I believe one of the days he's going amen amen amen he said blessed are your ears amen he says that he said they should see said but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear he said for B I said the many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which you see and have not seen them and to hear the things which you hear and have not heard them and then he turned around he says hear ye therefore the parable of the Sword and the seed and the spirit of God walking around in flesh begins to Quicken that word that he'd been talking to everybody else and they didn't understand but there was the spirit there was there was God himself walking in flesh and he turned to his disciples and he began to explain to them that Parable he began to make it known to them and they said oh we see it they didn't see it with their eyes they understood it they knew what the word was saying and that word set him free how many believes that tonight it's it's not just church amen it's not just seeing this message amen a lot of people see it and they just use it for reasons to argue and debate and to fuss with amen church that's not what it's for it's here to set us free it's here that we might rejoice and thank God for the day and hour which we live and that God's allowed us to see this Worden and when we see this amen we see people doing this it just shows to me that they don't quite understand what that word is about yes they haven't quite seen it they've seen it with their eyes you know what we need to do for people like that we need to pray Lord God Quicken that word to them let that Spirit make that word real to them because there's a lot of people in this message that have a great understanding of message but it never made them free what good does that do it makes you more miserable than you were right right brother right Amen brother BR told it like this I want to share this story and many of you have heard it I'm sure he told about an old sea captain on the se he said he pretty near lived his whole life out in sin and unbelief amen he was held Bound by the devil his whole life he never knew what it was like to be free but one time he' heard about God he'd heard about the Bible he' heard that there was a God who could save but you know what it had never become Quicken to he'd never really see it just like a lot of people in the message amen they've heard about this message they've heard about this word but it's never become real to them and therefore they're still under Bond that's why they can't shout that's why there's no fireworks in their life that's why they're not selling celebrate because it's just a mental Conception Church when you get that Revelation I'm here to tell you amen oh do you have it all the time brother Jim know but when the minute I see myself start falling back I fall my say Lord God I need a refilling amen I need a refreshing Amen to Quicken that word because he said without it you'll never understand he said but here was this man lived his life near and said but once he'd heard of a Bible he heard about God he would laying there dying amen without this word that's where we all we're all dead am well I was what time of my trespasses and sin amen I didn't know that God would heal I didn't know God would deliver him and I was there one time too amen but then I heard about Jesus what a wonderful hour I'm so glad that I found out that he could bring me out good song brother John amen I'm glad that I'm free this morning so what was it he said he heard about this Bible but he said is there one on my ship is there anybody that knows could read me to tell me about it and he waited a long time but he said God was still full of rich and mercy in there and he said they found a little boy on the ship how many knows the story yes they found a little boy on the ship that had a Bible and he came to the the captain SE captain's bed there he laid dying amen and he said I know that God's word says all these truths and all these things but he said oh if somebody could just read them to me and make them real to me and the little boy started to reading the Bible he says read me that Bible son and he said he opened it up to Isaiah chapter 53 am and he began to read the Bible and he read out Isaiah 5 three he says he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed amen he began to preach that word or speak that word to God and it said that little boy turned to him and the captain just lay there miserable no joy and a little boy sitting there with a big smile on his face thinking isn't that great you know why it was because it was real to him Spirit quickened it to him the captain just lay there man like see a lot of people in church sometime the word of God comes forth they just sit there yeah I wish you get done time for dinner right brother right you know it's a truth say thank you Lord for letting me hear that word what have I done to deserve amen his glory he said there lay that Captain expression never changed and little boy turned and said Captain sir he said yes lad he said let me read it to you the way my mama used to read it to me amen he said sure he said I read it the way it's found in the Bible he said but let me read it to you the way my mom used to read it yes he says go ahead son surely can't hurt and he says he was wounded for Willie pu's transgressions yes beautiful he was he was bruised for Willie pu's iniquity the chastisement of Willie puits peace was upon him and with his stripes Willie puit was healed and he turned to the captain he had a big SP his face handicaps and they said oh I wish I'd had a mama like that oh I wish I i' had a mama that could have read me the Bible like that perhaps I could have known that my by his TR I was heal but you know what this word he said this boy wanted the captain set free how many want to see your neighbor set free how many want to see your loved one set free I want to see your wife or your husband set free what was it so Willie didn't just say well there's no hope you just must not be seen you know what he did the Bible said if you continue in my word he said if you continue in my word he said wait a second captain let me continue in the word and read it on to you I want you set free amen he laying there dying amen he said let me read it to you like this he said let me put your name in there Captain he said all right read my name in there son he said he was wounded for John Court's transgressions he was bruised for John Court's iniquity the chastisement of John courtz peace was upon him and with his stripes John courtz was healed and he said and he turned and he looked at the captain that time and he says the light of the Holy Ghost lit on his face and he says I see it I see it the books on I got up and put my pants on and he lived for God the rest of his life and what was he continued in the word and the word quickened by the spirit made him free Hallelujah glory amen you know sometimes we just we read it one time and it doesn't have any effect on us amen so what is it don't don't close the book until I see it oh Lord I'm going to read it over I'm going to continue in my word and you'll know the truth and the truth that's a promise church if you read by his scripes are healed you're still sick go back and read it again continue in it continue claiming that prise amen because something amen is real and it's the word it's not that Devil he's already he's already been conquered I'm B A conquer he can't hold me sick any longer because I've been set free GL said but the problem is you said that's got to be a revelation to you yes said until was a revelation to you you'll never see it he said he saids see it's like Nicodemus set the man Bor he cannot see the Kingdom of Heaven you can't understand it until you're born again when you're born again you realize what makes people act the way you do you realize why will Pro it with smiling amen what is it when it becomes a personal Affair when you can read your name in here who is wounded for William Brand's transgression Bru for William Brand's iniquity peace of William brand then the peace comes he said not when it's a wholesale Affair and not just when it's so much mind but when it has a practical outworking in your life then you know it other than that it'll never set you free yes he said what this stries he said then it's a different story when it becomes a personal revelation to you when you see it then you know it that's the knowing of the word that sets you free when that spirit of God quickens it to you amen that's why I said I need a fresh feeling of that Spirit every day amen because as I get fresh word every day I want that Spirit to Quicken it every day I say Lord God I thank you for the fing that you give me yesterday but fill me up again I was thirsty yesterday you come and gave me a drink but I'm thirsty again today I'm hungry again today I ate yesterday am but I'm hungry again today amen you know what I do when I'm hungry the next day I go to the fridge or I go to my wife and I say would you fix me something to eat and she starts to rustle it all up and I eat again man I'm not satisfied with what I ate yesterday that was good that produced life yesterday but I need life again today how many wants that kind of spirit amen it's when you that's how you know the word that's how you see the word Hallelujah by continuing in the word yes God wants you born again of the spirit and you know what there might be a little something in your life that he's working on you know brother BR said he was working on job how many knows that to be the truth Prophet God said there was some things in job's life he still needed to find tune but yet he testifies in the Book of Job have you considered my servant job there's none like him there's not another one like he the righteous and upright he hates he hates evil he fears God am me he reverences the word of God they're not another like in all the world but yet there were some things that weren't quite policy man you know what we can say well I believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God I believe the message of the hour I believe he's sent a prophet I can believe all this but maybe there's a few things in our lives brother Jesse they just aren't quite lined up the way God wants them Lin up though he begins to work on us amen he might send a tribulation he might send a trial he might send trouble he might send this he might send that he might send something a situation into your life that's what he did to job he knows that to be the truth but you know what the fact still remain that he was already conquered that devil was a conquered devil in the mind of God he' already been defeated everything that he allowed job to go through amen he allowed job to go through that amen knowing that he had already conquered he couldn't take job's life yes he had already been set free but here job man he sure didn't feel free you know why that was because he knew it up here but he hadn't got it down in here how many know that the truth you read the book you know the story brother brand put it like this amen no brother brand the word of God puts it like this and job answered the Lord he said I know that thou can't do everything and that no thought can be withholden from the see what he knew the word yes he had an under he knew that word he knew you know everything he knows I know you know what I'm going through I know no thought can be withhold from you job had a good understanding up here of what God knew and what he was amen he says who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore I have uttered that I understood not things that were too wonderful for me that I knew not amen he talked about him but he didn't know him he said right there I uttered things that I didn't know I talked about things that I didn't understand amen but he said now that I've come through this now that I've seen amen your hand now that I've seen what you're doing in my life heard of thee with the hearing of the ear he said but now my eyes see thee he said now I understand now I have a know now I know you for who you are then he could say the lightning Flash and in the Thunder Road he says now I know my redeemer liveth amen and my Shall Behold him I'll see him I'll understand him not another it became a personal revelation to Jo and he said I know my redeemer liveth Hallelujah Church he comes in personal revelation to you we can have the same Redemption amen revealed to us how many those that we've already been redeemed how many know that we've already been bought back our healing been redeemed and been bought back when the devil tries to steal it's already been paid forah I know my redeemer living have that Revelation that Spirit got to Quicken that word he in to Hallelujah brother BR said Redemption God already has a way of redemption redeem means to be bought back he said you know remind you the devil put us all in the pawn shop he said but Jesus Christ come down how many are glad that he came down and brought us out Jesus Christ come down and he redeemed us he came in like and and he redeemed us out of the devil's pawn shop you see he put us in the pawn shot like Christ come down and he paid the price on Calvary 2,000 years ago he shed his life's blood another son of Liberty Set Me Free that's something to shout about that's why I see the lightness such why I can say I know my redeemer liveth amen the spirit's made that real to me amen but if you don't you don't know it till the spirit until you're born again of the spirit of God hallelujah he said you know the trouble is people don't realize he said he said Christ come down and pth we're already made free you're free of sin yes you're free of all your iniquities free of all your trouble and trials amen you said well brother Jim amen are the Affliction of righteous yeah but God delivers them out of the all they might be there but I got a promise amen that I got delivered so when I'm in a trial in the midst of a trouble I'm say I can't wait to feel how good it's going to be when God delivers me out of this why why can you say that why can you rejoice in the midst of it because I know my redeemer liveth amen I know the price has already been paid and he's already been called he says you know the trouble it is that people just don't realize that right they don't realize what he was saying actually says we don't realize we are more than a conqueror we are a possessor yes he says oh he says you know the trouble is people don't realize it he says they think you have to do something to be free he says you're already free the only thing you have to do is to know about it because the word of God says you shall know the truth and the trth knowing the truth the knowing the truth what is the truth brother Jim the truth is his word and his word says in Isaiah 53 that I'm already set free the devil has to to come against the word says over here in Romans the 8 chapter I persuaded that not death nor life nor Angel principalities Powers these things none of these things can move me said things present things to come height or depth amen life or death famine Peril sword I've already been set free from those amen yes that's that's a whole that's a whole lot to Rejoice about he says always said there you are trouble is he says he says you're already free the only things you have to know about said brother I have to do some no he said they not one they can do it's by grace that you're saved the plan's already made redemption's already paid for the only thing you have to do is accept it in other words you have to get a spiritual Revelation he says you can't accept it you can't see it you can't know it it sets you free until you get born again of the spirit of God Amen Glory Church man I didn't say it Prophet did yes he said without that Spirit you'll never know what it's like to be set free Hallelujah you're going around thinking you're still set you're still Bound by the devil when you're already set free is anybody sitting here this morning man I don't know your situation I don't know I don't know hardly any of you then especially not your situations I know some I know sister Wendy and I know brother van I know a few of you to see you but I don't know your life I don't know your I don't know what you're going through if you're sitting in here this morning the devil has you bound amen you the only reason he can hold you bound is because you don't know that you've been set free yes if you're being troubled be do what you need to pray for go God brother Brown said what we need to pray for every day more than anything else is revelation more than anything else so that comes from the Holy Spirit making the word of God quick than the word of God to you amen problem is we go around already set free and we don't know it and that's why we act the way we do yes sir told a little story about a crow I wish he'd told it about an eagle but he told it about a crow he said a farmer one time was in a field he said and this Crow come by and was always picking his corner so he said you know what he did he set a trap and he caught that old crow and he tied him and he bound him by the leg amen he said I'll set him out here and I'll scare the rest of the crows away because they'll see him bound they say I want to get bound so I'm staying away from that good food I'm staying away from there so here this bird that was born to fly with bounds here on the ground going around and around in circles tied to a peg many knows the story yes well brother random said here that here his buddies had come by and say come on Johnny crow flies it's getting cold it's time to get out of here death is creeping in but we got to get out of here we're going to die and old Johnny Crow says I can't I'm bound I can't I'm bound and you just go around and around in circles you know that's way a lot of people are in the messes keep going around around Circle the devil hasn't bound amen unbelief of his word the devil hasn't bound because they can't see that he's already set him free amen the word of God is already settled the Redemption plan is already made amen but we just have to accept it he said yes he said and what it was he says but one time he said but then one day that Crow would try to call and he said he could not he was tied him in so one day he said there came a good kindhearted poor man to come by and he said and there was that old poor old crow tied down there and he says he said I felt so sorry for him and I thought to myself that's the same thing that happened to me one day I was sitting and he says and he sent his Lord the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ come down and he said you know poor brother Jim I feel so bad that he's down there he don't belong there he's supposed to be sword he's an eagle amen he don't belong bound and tied down here and so he come along and he cut that Bond loose that had that the devil had be held with he cut that Bond unbelief he cut that Bond of of not being able to see amen he cut the blindfold off of my spiritual eyes amen and the spirit of God come down and reveal the word of God to me and by his blood I was saved there on Calvary I was set free amen and then I was sitting there and I was still under depression amen and still still all all tied down and and people come by and say rejoice brother J you're free he said no I'm still I'm still here but I was free all the time yes you know what I always was free yes I never was bound yes but they just had me tricked through unbelief to thinking that I was bound and he had a lot of people in the message tricked into thinking that they're bound when they're already set free so what is it he saids he said what was it he said oh this poor HED guy I feel sorry for him he goes over he cuts the B he lets a crow grow and they cried come on Johnny the wind's blowing he said I can I'm still bound see and all the time he was already set free all the time church amen you're already set free if you're sitting here this morning the devil had you B and said oh I'm still sick I'm still troubled this situation amen you need a revelation of the holy spirit that that thing is already under the blood that thing's already taken care of it's already been purchased yes he said that's the way many people are tonight he said the lady whoever it was was sitting here in that wheelchair they heard the good news last night he said tonight those wheelchairs aren't here he says why is that he says they were probably sitting out there in the audience he says see they were free all the time he said Jesus cut them loose at Calvary when the bloodstream came from his body and to free every person from their sicknesses they were set free 2,000 years ago he says and so were you he says the only reason we stay there because they just didn't know it he said they didn't know the truth the word that would set him free they didn't have a spiritual understanding why was that because they didn't continue in the word just continue in that word brother says you get a vision of you're sick you get a vision of a well man and just keep walking towards him every day he said one day you'll walk right into that well man you'll walk right into that well person so what is it he said he says he's the high priest of our confession he says every day you confess the word you confess the word you confess the word if you got a save un saved love and every day you confess the Worden every day you confess the word he says he's the high priest your confession he takes that confession before God and God is obligated to come and answer that word for you amen amen he said he would do it amen they beli it tonight oh he said there you are you're free all the time Jesus cut you loose in Calvary amen he said the problem is we don't see it amen Heen the Sinners here last night that accepted Christ as their savior was sitting here bound last night by sin and unbelief he says he said but Satan come along and cut that chain of sin and tonight they're enjoying freedom of the Lord after they've heard that Emancipation Proclamation was signed they were set free amen how many believes that tonight amen church that's the way a lot of us are we sit in church and then week after week amen Sunday after Sunday Wednesday after Wednesday every what weekend you have your midday service amen and we sit there bound because we don't know the truth yes yes then you say well know it no you have a mental conception but when it has a practical outworking in your life then you really know it he said it can't do that the prophet God said he said you'll never see it until you're born again amen says you'll never see it looking at the symptoms brother BR said one message he said any man that ever looks at the symptom loses his victory every time how many say Amen to that amen but every man that looks to the word of God is set free every time because the word say he's set free every time he says what was it I'm gonna close amen I don't know how long you preach brother Jesse amen but sometimes I preach long sometimes I preach short amen I guess I'll be I think it's F short today I don't know I don't know how long I've been going good that's good if I was preaching this lateer at our church we'd be in trouble how many loves the Lord this morning amen how many glad to be set free this morning hallelujah how many knows you're free this morning don't Church you know what you need to do you need to say Lord God I need this morning and fresh and filling of your Holy Spirit Hallelujah I need to see the word this morning if I see that word the word of God says I'm going to know the word or see the word that I'm going to be set free brother BR told this a story I'm going to tell this in close if musician would come or whatever amen I'm going to sing this or U read this word before we sing a little song Here said during the time of slavery when that Iman Proclamation was signed how many back in January 1st of 1863 or 53 brother Jesse knows he's a school teacher probably I don't know amen but way back then amen Lincoln signed a letter of intent Amen to set the slaves free and a mancipation proclamation but brother BR they tell me the slaves in the South would climb to the hill that they were going to be because they knew they were going to be free at the sunrise on that date amen according to this Proclamation he says for as soon as they seen the sun they knew they were free how many are glad that you've seen the sun this morning Satan held us like slaves bound amen under his thumb amen under sickness and depression and all these things he said but guess what he said the word of God said I am set free but that has I've got to see that I've got to understand that I've got to be quick and to I got to be like John courts now I see it amen and the Lightning's got to flash job said now I see it amen and now I understand it in other words now I'm born again now that word's been quickened by the spirit of God in my life and now it's become a revelation he said every man that sees the son is free yes know you might read brother man where did he get this you got it right here a joh you shall know the truth you shall see that son and he say be set free every man that sees the sun is free you see the son you see him in a way of Revelation that God has revealed him to you that's the only way you'll ever know it he says when God has revealed it to you that's the basis of all scriptural promise he says when God reveals it to you that's the only way you'll ever know yes but he tells Simon one time he says he says Flesh and Blood hasn't revealed this to you it's not some teacher it's not some man it's not reading of a book or listening to a tape he said all that's good he said that's continue word he said but it takes the spirit to come down and Quicken that word really know that that word is real amen that's what John Court he heard the Bible he knew that there was a God that healed but it never become a reality to him amen it has to be a personal revelation to you church and when this word becomes a personal revelation to you that devil Can't Hold You bound anymore you talk about a Fourth of July celebration you talk about fireworks that's the way it ought to be in our lives every day why why can't I feel that brother Jim you might need the spirit of God more than you've ever needed it before this morning amen he said oh he says flesh and blood has not revealed this you but my father's in heaven upon that rock that Revelation that's where the church is built amen that's where we're set free he said when you are built upon that rock spiritual revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ that's where we bu the church that's where we know we are free how many say there want to be how many want to know that this morning put you stand praise God amen amen this word of God is true and are more than conquer through him I am persuaded that none of these things that the devil can bring no longer have an effect on me they no longer can have an effect on you the reason they do is because you need a quickening of that word god you need to stay in that word amen you don't give up the first time and say well I prayed last night and I'm still sick amen you need Lord God I'm gonna keep praying I'm going to keep Lord God till that word is quick to my heart amen that by your stripes I am healed I'm G to keep praying for that lost loved one you said I can claim them am I can claim my whole house amen the Philippian Jailer did I can do it too amen somebody believe that this morning that what when that becomes a revelation to you church amen then you'll have something to shout about then you'll have a reason to celebrate the freedom we have because then you'll know the truth and the truth will set you free would you buy your head with me this morning I wonder how many out there this morning amen was sitting here this morning and say you know what the devil tried to bind me this week under situations under trial under trouble I need a fresh filling of that spirit this morning I need a fresh anoint of that Spirit upon that word to Quicken that word to my life that I can be set free I'm tired of that devil trying to hold me down I'm tired of only rejoicing in the natural things I want to rejoice in the fact that by his stripes I've been set free just look your hand say pray for me brother Jim I need a fresh anointing for that Holy Spirit upon that word he said because without that anointing without that quickness Spirit the word never becomes known to you Hallelujah he says you can see it all day long you can read it all day long but what we need this morning more than anything else is that fresh anointing of that Spirit Hallelujah to Quicken that word to us he says Flesh and Blood doesn't reveal it to you he'll never get a revelation you'll never know the truth he said but my spirit he said that what reveals that word to you heavly father you see hands round about the building Lord God if I had another hand i' have it in the air this morning Lord God I I beg for a fresh anointing every day Lord God that that word would be real to My Heart Lord God I see Brothers and Sisters in Christ here that no doubt

knows that their sins are under the blood that Satan would come by and daily try to hold them bound amen when they've already been set free father we pray Lord that you would just Quicken that word that's ever settled in heaven Lord God Quicken that word by your spirit this morning allow a fresh anointing of God's holy spirit to fall down upon each one of us Lord that we might leave this place
