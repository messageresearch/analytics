[32:42] i think we're on part 12 tonight yet
[32:44] we're looking at the the
[32:45] type the mystery of the church as the
[32:48] bride
[32:49] i just like to uh real briefly read this
[32:52] quote it just kind of came to my mind
[32:54] here as i was uh praying
[32:57] um brother brahma was teaching in the
[32:59] authority or church age
[33:03] and he's talking about the two kinds of
[33:05] women he's talking about you know
[33:06] mystery babylon
[33:07] and he's talking about the bride of
[33:09] christ and he said uh
[33:12] the woman is brought to a very peculiar
[33:14] position before god in his word
[33:17] she's the type of all things vulgar foul
[33:20] and lowsome on one hand
[33:22] but on the other hand she's the type of
[33:23] all things clean and beautiful
[33:26] and holy as the receptive receptacle
[33:30] of the spirit and blessings of god on
[33:33] one hand she's called the who's
[33:34] drunk with the wine of her fornications
[33:37] on the other hand she's called the bride
[33:39] of christ
[33:41] amen praise god on one hand she's called
[33:45] mystery babylon the abomination before
[33:48] god on the other hand she's called the
[33:49] new jerusalem
[33:51] our mother on one hand she is so fouled
[33:54] wicked and lewd that she is
[33:56] summarily cast in the lake of fire as
[33:58] the only
[33:59] fit place for her and on the other hand
[34:02] she is exalted to heaven sharing the
[34:05] very
[34:06] throne of god as the only place
[34:08] befitting
[34:09] such a queen ah let's thank the lord for
[34:13] that praise god amen
[34:15] bye that's beautiful i just want a
[34:18] really quick review all these women we
[34:20] preached on it uh
[34:22] you know we looked at eight women that
[34:24] type uh
[34:25] the gentile bride right and i just wanna
[34:29] real quick
[34:29] go over them real quick think about the
[34:32] character of these women
[34:33] sarah think about the character that she
[34:36] had to have to receive the seed
[34:38] uh and receive a body change rebecca to
[34:42] leave her husband leave her family for
[34:44] her husband
[34:44] on the drop of a hat notice azinath
[34:49] right to marry joseph the gentile she
[34:52] was gentile to marry
[34:53] joseph and bring forth his seed
[34:56] rahab to believe as we looked at sunday
[34:58] to believe the word of god
[35:00] and to want to be saved we want to be
[35:02] found in god
[35:04] instead of with the world samson's bride
[35:07] from timnath
[35:09] right ruth esther solomon's wife look at
[35:13] all those
[35:14] uh godly women look at the lessons that
[35:16] you can learn there
[35:18] and now uh since then we jumped into
[35:21] other women
[35:22] uh specifically eve the lessons we can
[35:24] learn there keeping all the word of god
[35:27] praise the lord uh jochebed
[35:31] uh trusting god to uh protect our
[35:34] children praise god
[35:36] what beautiful lessons deborah getting
[35:39] in the spirit the spirit of prophecy
[35:41] praise god uh macau of course we learned
[35:45] a good lesson from her on the
[35:46] what not to do never make fun of the
[35:49] holy spirit praise god
[35:50] and rejoice in the holy spirit amen love
[35:53] the lord and
[35:55] enjoy worship and then last week we
[35:58] looked at hannah
[35:59] the lesson of cherishing life above all
[36:02] else right being desperate for natural
[36:04] life
[36:05] and spiritual life we learn a great
[36:07] lesson and notice church all these
[36:09] lessons are from women right
[36:11] they're all from women of course you can
[36:12] learn a lot of good lessons from men
[36:15] but i think it's just amazing that god
[36:16] types even men uh you know as part of
[36:19] his bride
[36:20] part of his church because we've all got
[36:21] to submit to the holy spirit
[36:24] and i just thought we'd just quick just
[36:25] briefly just review those what
[36:27] uh what wonderful character god has
[36:30] placed in these women
[36:32] and he says this is the very in other
[36:34] words the the godly woman is the epitome
[36:36] of holiness
[36:38] right she's the very epitome of
[36:40] everything beautiful
[36:41] that you'd want to find right in nature
[36:44] right or
[36:45] in creation um just an amazing
[36:49] uh thing now i've heard one preacher say
[36:51] i think he went a little too far he said
[36:53] the woman was the height of all creation
[36:54] because she was the last one i don't
[36:55] know about that
[36:56] i would just say man overall because
[36:59] remember she was in man right
[37:01] uh when adam was created when he had his
[37:03] own body
[37:04] uh because i i don't know if brother
[37:06] brown said that i'm not i have to look
[37:07] that up
[37:08] um but the last thing that was brought
[37:11] forth
[37:12] was a woman right and she has the choice
[37:14] to be both
[37:16] uh she has a choice to be either uh the
[37:19] lowest or the highest
[37:20] right and jesus of course is uh
[37:23] the husband but she's the type of
[37:25] everything beautiful
[37:27] as a bride amen and so
[37:30] we learned these great lessons and i was
[37:31] just thinking that you know there's so
[37:33] much to her character look at
[37:34] there's so much to the golly woman's
[37:36] character we'll keep reviewing that you
[37:38] know we'll go back to uh proverbs 31 but
[37:40] just think about that for a moment
[37:42] remember all those things
[37:43] there are so many attributes to the
[37:44] godly woman in proverbs 31 just
[37:47] look at all that list look at all that
[37:49] she can accomplish
[37:51] praise god i just think come on look
[37:52] what god uh all the blessings god has
[37:55] put in a godly woman
[37:57] and uh it's it's exalted brother man
[37:59] said she's exalted
[38:01] to share the throne of heaven praise god
[38:04] i just you know want to remind us here
[38:06] that the scripture came to my mind
[38:08] i think i'll just uh look it up real
[38:10] quick
[38:11] you know we're not worthy of salvation
[38:15] but we are worthy of the rewards of
[38:18] heaven
[38:20] let's say it again we're not really
[38:21] worthy of salvation
[38:23] because christ took our place but we are
[38:26] worthy
[38:26] of the rewards after salvation because
[38:30] jesus said so amen
[38:33] so revelation chapter 2
[38:38] i'm sorry it's revelation chapter 3
[38:39] verse 4 you are worthy
[38:42] because of your walk i'm going to say
[38:45] that again
[38:46] you're worthy because of your walk
[38:49] amen verse 4 revelation 3 verse 4. if
[38:52] you got that case you can pull it up
[38:54] thou has a few names even in sardis
[38:56] which have not defiled their garments
[38:58] and they shall walk with me in white for
[39:00] they are
[39:01] worthy how are they worthy how could the
[39:04] bride and sardis
[39:05] this is the the church age of martin
[39:07] luther
[39:08] how could they be worthy because they
[39:11] chose to walk
[39:12] in the right path right right
[39:16] we're not worthy of salvation we're
[39:18] saved by grace but we are worthy
[39:20] according to jesus
[39:21] you're worthy of rewards because of the
[39:24] walk you choose to walk
[39:25] amen hallelujah so
[39:28] we thank the lord for that and i just
[39:31] want to bring that out
[39:32] just real briefly remember your walk is
[39:35] so important praise god the walk your
[39:37] daily walk
[39:38] if you keep your garments undefiled if
[39:40] you keep them clean
[39:42] if you keep them white then jesus looks
[39:44] down from heaven he says you're worthy
[39:45] to sit with me on the throne amen
[39:48] oh just what a blessing that is praise
[39:50] god your walk
[39:51] makes you worthy of the eternal life
[39:53] rewards not of eternal life right that's
[39:56] my grace
[39:57] that's a gift for anyone who will
[39:58] believe anyone who will surrender you're
[40:01] you're given that as a gift of grace but
[40:03] the rewards and the position as the
[40:05] bride of christ
[40:06] is given because you're worthy of that
[40:08] because you walked
[40:10] you crucified the lust of the flesh you
[40:12] crucified
[40:13] the cares of this world you crucified
[40:15] all that and jesus said you'll walk with
[40:17] me in white
[40:17] because you're worthy amen now tonight i
[40:20] want to get now to abigail
[40:22] mary the mother of jesus and the perhaps
[40:26] we'll get to anna the prophetess
[40:28] so i want to look at these women here
[40:30] tonight by the grace of the lord what
[40:31] great lessons we can learn
[40:35] so abigail we don't have time to read of
[40:36] course everything in here but
[40:38] abigail is uh it's called beautiful and
[40:41] wise in the scripture in first samuel
[40:43] 25. uh she had though
[40:46] a really awful husband named nabel right
[40:49] his name means fool
[40:51] i mean who would what kind of parent
[40:53] would name their child fool but
[40:55] he must i don't know i don't know what
[40:56] happened but anyways he's named fool
[40:59] well
[40:59] he was rich right so apparently
[41:01] abigail's uh
[41:03] father must have married you know
[41:05] arrange the marriage right
[41:06] because he had a lot of money well he'll
[41:08] take care of her he's got a lot of money
[41:10] well she ends up and just has an awful
[41:11] husband right
[41:13] uh and you know the story you know david
[41:16] took care of
[41:17] uh you know nabels shepherds out there
[41:20] then he's
[41:20] he said mabel i'd like some help could
[41:22] you help me out
[41:24] and uh nable said who is david now
[41:27] everybody knew
[41:28] and history said they were all singing
[41:30] about david a few years earlier
[41:33] right all the women were danced around
[41:34] and said saul's killed his thousands
[41:37] david's killed his ten thousand
[41:38] everybody knew about david right he
[41:40] delivered them from the philistines
[41:41] right
[41:43] but a few years later nabel's like who
[41:45] who cares who's david
[41:47] and david said i'm gonna go kill this
[41:48] guy and every male in his house
[41:52] and uh abigail gets the uh the
[41:54] revelation
[41:55] i gotta go stop it right now and she
[41:59] watch your approach although she's got
[42:00] an awful husband
[42:02] uh she wants to save his life and look
[42:04] at that she wants to save his life
[42:06] right uh so she she packs up the camel's
[42:10] full right of all the
[42:12] all the uh the oil the wine and
[42:15] she takes all the figs and all the food
[42:17] and the bread and
[42:18] everything like that and what we learned
[42:21] from her is she has the right approach
[42:24] she stands in the gap for her husband
[42:28] right you don't deserve it but she tells
[42:32] david let
[42:32] his sin be upon me now how could god
[42:36] resist that kind of character praise god
[42:39] where she said put his his wickedness
[42:42] on me and don't do it
[42:46] and she has such wisdom she she doesn't
[42:49] rebuke david because david was going to
[42:50] do something awful
[42:51] right but she uses such wisdom to say no
[42:55] the lord is going to keep you from this
[42:57] david
[42:59] and she's able to uh she's able to
[43:02] dismantle
[43:04] david's rage now that's such a
[43:08] now think about that he's a man after
[43:09] god's own heart
[43:11] he's so passionate and you know good
[43:14] he's in good ways he's passionate
[43:16] but some ways it's bad right if he
[43:19] doesn't keep that
[43:20] and what can slow down a man what's the
[43:22] one thing that can slow down a man who's
[43:24] gonna go kill uh passionately kill these
[43:26] men what can slow him down
[43:28] a godly wise humble woman
[43:32] what what can stop this guy the only
[43:35] thing that can stop him is a woman
[43:37] who's led by the holy spirit praise god
[43:40] a man after god so not a mighty warrior
[43:42] who took down the giant goliath what can
[43:44] stop this man
[43:45] another giant no one's like this
[43:48] giant character can stop him amen
[43:51] hallelujah amen
[43:52] the character of a godly woman
[43:56] stops him from going to do the rage that
[43:59] had filled his heart
[44:01] so one thing is just like one thing got
[44:03] to him and he snapped right david just
[44:04] snapped he said
[44:06] i'm going to go destroy this guy all
[44:08] because he wouldn't give us a little bit
[44:09] of food you know
[44:10] wouldn't help us out a little bit
[44:12] because we'd helped him
[44:13] he snapped but then the wisdom of
[44:15] gabagail
[44:16] stops him uh from doing some awful
[44:20] things
[44:22] now she's such a wise woman now she's
[44:24] wise and beautiful the bible says
[44:27] right and uh
[44:30] we know the story she goes home she
[44:33] waits till uh nable's done
[44:35] getting drunk the next morning he tells
[44:37] her all that happened
[44:38] listen hon listen hon
[44:42] david was going to kill you last night
[44:44] but i went and gave him some of that and
[44:46] what the bible say she he instantly
[44:48] turned like stone and
[44:49] died you know 10 days later
[44:52] so look at this he's a he's a
[44:54] stone-hearted person
[44:56] but uh he's shocked by the love of god
[44:59] and the grace
[45:00] of his wife and and then he dies right
[45:03] after that like a temporary judgment
[45:05] right
[45:06] on his foolishness and look how it works
[45:09] out
[45:10] uh she's able now to marry in
[45:13] uh to david right married to david
[45:16] marian to the royalty
[45:17] right all because of her humble approach
[45:21] so she's in this awful situation but
[45:23] because she approached
[45:25] david the right way and waited on the
[45:27] lord in wisdom and
[45:28] and even stood up for this man her
[45:30] husband honored her vibes look at that
[45:32] she honored her vows she honored
[45:34] everything because she honored the lord
[45:36] in every area
[45:38] god is able to separate her from this
[45:40] past life this this
[45:41] this awful man and give her a a a
[45:44] husband who's after the heart of god
[45:47] oh man what a story all because of her
[45:51] wisdom
[45:52] and her approach now you know the story
[45:54] remember she fall down so it's a
[45:56] type of like coming to christ right just
[45:58] fall down just
[45:59] and bring an offering amen bring some
[46:01] worship amen
[46:02] bring some love approach jesus in the
[46:05] right manner praise god
[46:06] amen
[46:09] and so what does she do she offers a
[46:12] pleasing sacrifice
[46:14] to the husband i'm sorry to her future
[46:16] husband right
[46:18] and then she's accepted so we see this
[46:20] is a great type of romans
[46:22] 7 4. casey can you pull it up there
[46:24] romans 7
[46:26] 4.
[46:29] so she gives us this idea of a woman she
[46:31] stays in her position
[46:33] no matter what situation she's in you've
[46:35] got an awful husband or awful
[46:36] or opposite even a a wife i'm sorry a
[46:40] husband who's got an awful wife and
[46:42] you like paul said stay in that
[46:44] situation amen
[46:45] yeah there we are first corinthians 7
[46:47] wherever you're called stay in that
[46:48] position
[46:49] your life will either sanctify their
[46:51] life or something will work out
[46:52] god will work it out you just honor the
[46:54] lord your life
[46:56] amen wherefore my brethren you also are
[47:00] become dead to the law by the body of
[47:02] christ
[47:03] that ye should be married to another
[47:05] even to him who is raised from the dead
[47:08] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[47:10] god
[47:11] now like this the bible said we were
[47:13] married to the law right
[47:15] and the bible said the law was a slave
[47:17] master
[47:18] it wasn't a good it wasn't a good
[47:20] marriage right but we're separated from
[47:22] that
[47:23] and now we're married to another praise
[47:26] god
[47:26] and so when i look at abigail i see that
[47:29] she's got a
[47:30] she's got a bad marriage to start but
[47:32] she keeps serving she approaches christ
[47:34] the right way
[47:35] and keeps the word honors the word and
[47:37] then god fixes it
[47:38] and god brings her into the best
[47:41] marriage possible praise god
[47:44] amen i think it's a type of spiritual
[47:47] things amen
[47:51] so we can see that god honors our
[47:53] approach
[47:54] our approach must be pleasing sacrifice
[47:57] uh
[47:57] we we must uh uh we must not try to
[48:00] fight our own battles amen glory
[48:03] we gotta let the lord fight our battles
[48:05] amen like that's what that's what david
[48:07] was gonna say there
[48:08] uh david said he was gonna work out his
[48:10] own salvation
[48:12] but god uh he didn't he didn't pray to
[48:14] god about that right
[48:15] so the lord allowed he sent a humble
[48:17] messenger
[48:18] right to stop him from trying to fight
[48:20] for himself and that's what that's what
[48:22] we need to learn constantly that
[48:24] the battles the ours the battles the
[48:26] lords amen
[48:28] he was going to try to fight his own
[48:30] battles and win his own wars and
[48:32] and he didn't pray about this one
[48:33] beforehand right
[48:36] he just he snapped right thank god
[48:39] church thank god when we snap
[48:41] god's mercy is there for us praise the
[48:44] lord
[48:44] but we we might we might think oh i'm
[48:46] going to do this now or well i can't
[48:48] i'm sure they're going to do that but
[48:49] the lord is merciful
[48:52] and he keeps us from doing greater evil
[48:54] praise god
[48:55] amen
[49:00] just a beautiful lesson there from a
[49:02] woman now look how she's just
[49:04] look who who's really the powerful one
[49:06] there he was we'd say oh david
[49:07] he's got the anointing he's but who's
[49:09] the powerful one that humble sweet woman
[49:12] that humble sweet woman who was obeying
[49:15] the lord and
[49:16] and used wisdom and grace and honored
[49:19] every she honored everyone in every
[49:21] situation
[49:22] she didn't try to do anything she let
[49:24] god do everything for her amen
[49:27] oh my so we see the the we see a woman's
[49:31] wisdom
[49:32] exalted in her approach unto god at
[49:34] church that's all we got to do in every
[49:36] situation
[49:37] we got to you know before we make any
[49:38] big decisions we got to go to the
[49:40] lord in prayer give him praise give him
[49:43] worship
[49:44] make sure we we're not a respecter of
[49:46] persons amen
[49:47] we don't respect persons praise god uh
[49:50] we oh we honor everyone with the word we
[49:53] respect everyone with the word
[49:54] and watch god he'll just work everything
[49:56] out amen
[49:58] abigail is a great teacher of this
[50:03] now for some reason i got a scripture on
[50:04] here revelation 19
[50:06] 16 and i'm not familiar with that right
[50:08] off hand so let me go check that out
[50:10] revelation 19 16
[50:14] oh it says and he hath on his vesture
[50:16] and on his thigh name written king of
[50:17] kings
[50:18] and lord of lords okay as the type of
[50:20] christ or david as king and then christ
[50:22] is the true king of kings
[50:24] and lord of lords okay i see that all
[50:27] right now let's go to bathsheba he wrote
[50:28] real quickly
[50:29] like i said i'm going to go a little bit
[50:30] faster through these bathsheba i never
[50:32] set my timer here so let me set a timer
[50:34] here
[50:35] oh boy
[50:38] bathsheba now she was a disgraced a
[50:42] woman by adultery
[50:44] uh before legally becoming david's wife
[50:46] was forgiven by god and that blessed
[50:49] with think about that
[50:53] macau was cur
[50:56] right all is because she didn't like his
[50:59] day
[51:00] in the spirit all because she didn't
[51:02] like that worship and that
[51:04] that real holy ghost emotional worship
[51:06] she didn't like that
[51:08] she's cursed with no children but
[51:10] bathsheba
[51:14] we know she doesn't fight against it you
[51:15] know as far as david coming together
[51:17] on that awful night but yet
[51:20] she's forgiven by god and her womb is
[51:24] blessed
[51:26] think about that her womb is blessed
[51:29] so it makes us think that the thought
[51:31] was mostly with david that's what it
[51:32] makes me think
[51:33] right because if michael did that and
[51:35] she has not nothing coming out of the
[51:36] womb
[51:38] then it makes me think that she was you
[51:39] know bathsheba was just an awful place
[51:41] you know she really couldn't do much
[51:43] about it
[51:45] remember the bible said remember the
[51:46] bible said about david he obeyed the
[51:48] lord in everything except in the case of
[51:50] uriah's wife
[51:52] so it makes us think that she was just
[51:53] you know as a woman you know what
[51:55] in the day bible days she was a woman's
[51:57] value was little
[51:58] above property in other words
[52:02] the men would be more just as excited
[52:04] about having land as having a wife
[52:07] that's awful that's that's awful uh
[52:11] of course that's before the holy ghost
[52:12] came amen the baptism of the holy ghost
[52:15] but what was god saying the whole time
[52:17] she's far above rubies
[52:20] i don't know these men just gonna get
[52:21] the picture sister so i'm sorry and you
[52:22] little ones
[52:24] i don't know what it just it was the
[52:25] time in season sorry they just it wasn't
[52:27] their time and season to know that
[52:29] but sisters you little sisters remember
[52:31] that your value is more than rubies amen
[52:36] hallelujah you know just wasn't the time
[52:39] for it
[52:43] now she was so forgiven that she's
[52:45] blessed with four
[52:46] sons and remember her son nathan
[52:50] is in the lineage of christ
[52:53] right her son nathan and of course uh
[52:57] solomon too
[52:58] no no it's nathan it's nathan yeah it's
[53:00] nathan
[53:01] yeah nathan her uh she had four sons one
[53:04] of them solomon
[53:05] nathan is in the very lineage of jesus
[53:07] christ praise god
[53:10] it's amazing what god does uh his mercy
[53:13] and grace to these
[53:14] uh precious women now remember and then
[53:16] she helped secure
[53:17] solomon's succession to the throne
[53:21] right when david's other son was trying
[53:23] to take the throne
[53:24] without her you know solomon might not
[53:27] have got on the throne
[53:29] so let's read that that's first
[53:30] chronicles three verse five
[53:32] first chronicles three verse five i'll
[53:34] turn there
[53:36] if you can get up there but okay that's
[53:37] right first chronicles three verse five
[53:52] everybody glories in solomon which we
[53:54] know in his glory he was a mighty man
[53:56] of god but so often we forget that he
[53:58] might not have got there
[53:59] it's except god used bathsheba to do it
[54:02] and i know there's prophecy i know it
[54:03] all been fulfilled but
[54:04] look who god uses to carry out his will
[54:07] in other words look who
[54:08] look who god writes into the drama look
[54:11] at the parts that god writes in here
[54:12] this woman bathsheba and these were born
[54:15] unto him in jerusalem
[54:16] shimaya and shobab and nathan and salman
[54:20] 4
[54:21] of bashua the daughter of amiel
[54:25] okay that shows the four sons there
[54:28] okay but through the story we learned
[54:31] that bathsheba
[54:33] she went to she went to david and
[54:35] ensured
[54:36] that solomon was on the throne in other
[54:38] words she made sure
[54:40] the word of the lord was carried out
[54:42] amen
[54:44] in other words she did everything in her
[54:46] power to make sure the word was obeyed
[54:49] and make sure that the word came to pass
[54:51] that's what we can do as well
[54:52] amen make sure we do our part to
[54:55] help the word of god come to pass amen
[54:58] right in other words the bride has made
[54:59] herself ready well
[55:00] in order for the rapture to take brace
[55:02] the bride's got to get ready
[55:03] so let's make ready praise god let's do
[55:05] our part to make it come to pass
[55:07] right and i love this she gave she made
[55:10] sure solomon
[55:11] got to the throne uh in other words
[55:14] we've got to
[55:15] make sure christ rules with preeminence
[55:18] both
[55:18] in the church and in our hearts right
[55:21] she
[55:21] she gave solomon the preeminence she
[55:23] worked to give solomon
[55:25] the throne and that's what we got to do
[55:27] we got to labor
[55:28] to give christ preeminence both in the
[55:30] in our church right here
[55:32] and in our hearts amen because
[55:35] colossians 1 verse
[55:36] 18 said that christ might have the
[55:39] preeminence in all things
[55:40] praise god so this godly woman we see
[55:43] her
[55:45] we see her in disgrace it looks like
[55:47] it's mostly david's fault
[55:49] but she's being able to be forgiven and
[55:52] bring forth
[55:53] sons right have great fruit to her life
[55:56] oh what a blessing church
[55:57] that great fruit can come out of our
[55:59] lives no matter what wickedness we've
[56:01] been we've been
[56:02] trapped in can i say like that no matter
[56:04] what wickedness we've been trapped in or
[56:06] guilty of ourselves
[56:07] great fruit can come out of our lives
[56:09] amen god is the god of grace
[56:11] god is the god of forgiveness amen
[56:15] and he's looking at our hearts right
[56:16] he's looking uh he's looking
[56:18] at our heart reaction like david every
[56:21] time he got caught in a lie what'd he do
[56:22] he said i'm sorry lord forgive me i
[56:24] you know that's what we got to do judas
[56:27] said
[56:28] i'm guilty threw the money away what
[56:30] rhett and hung himself
[56:31] but david didn't do that that wasn't
[56:33] david went back to god
[56:34] and he laid in the house of god amen he
[56:37] laid in the house of god until
[56:39] you know until he just had hope that god
[56:42] would do something right
[56:43] he had hoped for that baby that was lost
[56:45] but he he was looking for god's mercy
[56:47] he would always trust in god he knew god
[56:50] was a god of grace amen
[56:53] what great lessons we can learn from
[56:55] abigail bathsheba
[56:59] let's go now to mary the wife of joseph
[57:01] mother of jesus
[57:03] she is the epitome of childlike faith
[57:05] right
[57:06] she just humbly received the angel
[57:08] gabriel's promise
[57:10] that she would conceive the christ child
[57:12] in her virginity
[57:14] and then uh decades later she received
[57:18] uh the baptism of the holy ghost in the
[57:22] upper room is that something she
[57:25] received the seed of god
[57:26] she received the natural seed of god
[57:28] that everybody else might receive the
[57:30] spiritual seed of god
[57:33] she received the natural seed of god
[57:35] first when jesus
[57:37] was conceived in her womb but then on
[57:39] the day of pentecost
[57:41] her soul received the spiritual seed of
[57:43] the holy ghost
[57:44] amen i didn't see that until right now
[57:47] praise god
[57:49] what a blessing right she received the
[57:52] seed the natural seed
[57:53] and then she received the spiritual seed
[57:55] on the day of pentecost amen
[57:57] because of her childlike faith she said
[58:00] i rejoice in god my savior amen
[58:04] oh my praise god what a testimony
[58:09] mercy
[58:12] and church look at this so her testimony
[58:15] inspires us to live as
[58:16] chase virgins she just did everything in
[58:20] her
[58:20] ability to stay a virgin right natural
[58:24] and spiritual and she just
[58:28] you know so not only was she we always
[58:29] think about virgin mary natural
[58:31] but really she was just as much virgin
[58:33] spiritually praise god right she wasn't
[58:36] taking
[58:37] the lies of the enemy she wasn't
[58:38] believing lies
[58:40] she just believe the word receive it
[58:42] praise god
[58:43] amen because she wasn't going to receive
[58:46] anything from the devil right
[58:47] she was in the cast out and everything
[58:49] that satan brought and remember brother
[58:51] and said that
[58:52] that word from isaiah 9 a virgin shall
[58:56] conceive brother
[58:56] said that prophecy circled the earth
[58:58] until it confined a virgin that would
[59:00] receive it amen
[59:03] and then it struck her because she had a
[59:05] virgin heart to the lord amen
[59:07] that's what brother have said eve lost
[59:09] her spiritual virginity first
[59:11] before the natural because she received
[59:13] the wrong seed in the womb of her mind
[59:15] brother brahm said
[59:16] that's true that's very true but see
[59:19] this virgin was different praise god
[59:21] natural and spiritual she only receives
[59:25] the virgin word of god
[59:26] because she's the epitome of a child
[59:29] like faith
[59:31] glory she just quickly accepted it in
[59:34] one conversation just
[59:35] quickly accepted being unto me whatever
[59:38] you say
[59:39] whatever god's angel would say whatever
[59:41] god's messenger says
[59:42] amen to that praise god look at the
[59:45] faith
[59:46] that mary gives us
[59:49] now brother said it like this i love
[59:50] this quote so i'm going to read this
[59:52] quote
[59:54] this is just an awesome quote but man
[59:57] said i want you to look at the
[59:58] difference between mary and zacharias
[1:00:01] zacharias that minister that gossip
[1:00:03] minister or preacher
[1:00:05] church look at this man this guy's
[1:00:07] 60-something he's probably 50 or 60
[1:00:09] years old
[1:00:09] he's been a fine scholar priest all
[1:00:11] these years and here's a 15 or 16 year
[1:00:14] old lydia right
[1:00:15] lydia 16 right so it's like a real
[1:00:18] adult you know man a warrior of the
[1:00:21] faith you know
[1:00:22] he's just rugged soldier
[1:00:26] god comes to him and then god comes to a
[1:00:29] 16 year old
[1:00:30] and who do you think would receive it
[1:00:31] better huh brothers
[1:00:34] just maokai knights brothers on the
[1:00:37] internet
[1:00:37] who's going to receive it this wise
[1:00:40] seasoned preacher man
[1:00:42] gospel preacher or a 16 year old girl
[1:00:46] who's got the real virgin heart to
[1:00:48] receive the word of god
[1:00:50] goodness gracious oh god help us praise
[1:00:53] god
[1:00:54] that's why church like we said a few
[1:00:55] weeks ago that's why we could expect
[1:00:57] some of our virgin daughters to prophesy
[1:00:58] in here
[1:01:00] because they don't don't take just
[1:01:01] because you're a man the word can come
[1:01:03] to you
[1:01:03] the prophesied word can come to any
[1:01:05] woman in here praise god
[1:01:09] because it don't matter if you're marrow
[1:01:10] female as far as the gifts of god
[1:01:13] just the preachings that's the only one
[1:01:14] that's separate but the branson that
[1:01:16] woman can do
[1:01:16] everything else except take the pulpit
[1:01:19] right
[1:01:20] everything else
[1:01:24] that gospel minister brother said a
[1:01:26] preacher as it was in that day
[1:01:28] priest in the temple he had known all
[1:01:30] kinds of things that happened before
[1:01:32] of all the miraculous power of god
[1:01:38] this man studied all the all the all the
[1:01:40] quotes can i say like that he said in
[1:01:42] all the scriptures he knew about all the
[1:01:44] powerful things of god
[1:01:46] and brother man said when the angel came
[1:01:47] to him he doubted it
[1:01:52] but mary he said said behold
[1:01:55] the handmaid of the lord she didn't
[1:01:57] question what could be
[1:02:00] or so forth
[1:02:03] so let's just remind our sisters and our
[1:02:06] brothers
[1:02:07] here tonight that
[1:02:11] god wants to give us promises but we've
[1:02:13] got to be humble enough to receive them
[1:02:16] praise god god is not a respecter of
[1:02:19] persons
[1:02:20] yes i hope god as the pastor i hope god
[1:02:23] gives me many revelations to help our
[1:02:25] church
[1:02:26] but i want to encourage our sisters god
[1:02:28] can reveal many things to you as well
[1:02:35] he said look how much more she had to
[1:02:37] believe than what he had to believe
[1:02:39] hannah had had a baby before when she
[1:02:41] was past that age
[1:02:42] sarah had had a baby before she was past
[1:02:44] that age but that had already happened
[1:02:46] many times but mary had to believe
[1:02:49] something that had never happened before
[1:02:52] right no other woman had ever brought
[1:02:55] forth a child like that into the world
[1:02:57] by knowing a man
[1:02:58] but she had to believe more than zac
[1:03:00] zacharias did
[1:03:02] so therefore she didn't question god she
[1:03:04] just took god at his word amen i like
[1:03:07] that
[1:03:07] take god at his word believe it anyhow
[1:03:09] no matter how impossible it looks to be
[1:03:11] believe god
[1:03:12] and he will bring it to pass
[1:03:16] praise god
[1:03:19] god help us praise the lord amen that's
[1:03:21] my prayer he will help us he's faithful
[1:03:23] he's a good and gracious king as we say
[1:03:25] amen
[1:03:29] but let me tell those our sisters
[1:03:30] tonight don't ever think you're too low
[1:03:32] that god can't give you a revelation
[1:03:34] because he can
[1:03:36] he can give you great revelations
[1:03:41] because the revelation of god's own son
[1:03:43] the coming of the messiah right
[1:03:45] the revelation of god in flesh it came
[1:03:48] to a 16 year old girl
[1:03:51] praise the lord right the word was made
[1:03:54] flesh
[1:03:55] and dwelt among us amen that revelation
[1:03:58] came to a 16 year old girl
[1:04:00] and it bypassed the preachers
[1:04:03] oh what is this what's going to happen
[1:04:05] in this rapture praise god i wonder
[1:04:06] i wonder who's going to catch that
[1:04:08] revelation verse in the body change
[1:04:10] the i said i'll sweep from one church to
[1:04:12] another you know
[1:04:13] i'm not sure but it's going to get the
[1:04:15] people ready and then the moment
[1:04:16] twinkling of an eye
[1:04:17] they'll be changed in a moment in tweak
[1:04:18] never night but the season of the
[1:04:21] rapture
[1:04:21] it'll be it'll sweep it'll start going
[1:04:23] around the world to small
[1:04:25] or maybe some big some big bride
[1:04:26] churches around the world no doubt
[1:04:30] but it's going to go to those who have
[1:04:31] childlike faith just to believe the word
[1:04:35] amen he said just take god at his word
[1:04:39] i like that no matter how impossible it
[1:04:41] looks to be believe god
[1:04:43] and he'll bring it to pass and the
[1:04:44] church said amen amen what a promise of
[1:04:47] god
[1:04:48] this is mary's testimony natural and
[1:04:51] spiritual
[1:04:52] virginity to bring forth the word of god
[1:04:56] amen the word and flesh
[1:05:03] let's look at anna here anna anna was an
[1:05:06] elderly widowed prophetess
[1:05:09] she served god with fastings and prayers
[1:05:12] night and day
[1:05:13] and gave witness a baby jesus being the
[1:05:16] promised messiah redeemer
[1:05:18] at the same instant simeon prophesied of
[1:05:21] jesus's mission
[1:05:22] that was in luke 2 verses 22
[1:05:26] through 38. now look at this woman she
[1:05:28] was married for a short while
[1:05:30] but then her husband died and she just
[1:05:32] said i'm not going to try to
[1:05:33] well i don't know what happened exactly
[1:05:35] but she found herself
[1:05:37] she said i'm just going to serve god in
[1:05:39] the temple day and night i wonder who
[1:05:40] was paying her bills but
[1:05:42] somehow god was able to provide for anna
[1:05:46] she didn't have a husband
[1:05:47] so god became her husband amen of course
[1:05:50] god always was
[1:05:51] right the spiritual husband but she she
[1:05:54] had such a love for god
[1:05:55] she said my ministry is to pray and fast
[1:06:00] for the church of god amen
[1:06:04] she said i don't have a husband i uh uh
[1:06:07] uh i'm widowed but i'm gonna devote my
[1:06:11] life
[1:06:11] to prayer and fasting you know that was
[1:06:13] in the book of titus as well
[1:06:14] paul says uh women he said
[1:06:18] women that are real widows have piety in
[1:06:20] the home
[1:06:21] and they don't go run off with young men
[1:06:23] that got money of course widows can
[1:06:25] remarry in the lord
[1:06:26] but it was a it was a it was a major
[1:06:28] thing in that day to be a widow because
[1:06:30] you had no way to get a job you had no
[1:06:31] way to make money
[1:06:33] and so god god elevates anna
[1:06:37] for her faithful service her prayers
[1:06:40] and fasting for the nation of israel
[1:06:43] in the house of god amen and brother and
[1:06:46] the bible said it was
[1:06:47] lifelong it was a lifelong ministry
[1:06:51] of prayer and fasting now think about
[1:06:53] that church he was i think 80 years old
[1:06:58] look and when does she when does she get
[1:07:00] the reward for all this
[1:07:02] when does she get the reward for all the
[1:07:03] praying fasting she gets it at the end
[1:07:06] of her life
[1:07:07] after decades and decades of faithfully
[1:07:10] serving god
[1:07:12] you know uh no one no one knew when the
[1:07:14] messiah was going to come
[1:07:16] but here her life her life is a
[1:07:18] testimony that if you serve god decades
[1:07:20] and decades and decades
[1:07:22] there will be rewards god sees our
[1:07:25] prayers and our fasting
[1:07:27] god sees our love and our praises and
[1:07:30] god's going to honor that
[1:07:31] he's going to pour out a great blessing
[1:07:32] upon us amen
[1:07:34] hallelujah like i told you about that
[1:07:36] brother herb who died last year
[1:07:38] but before he died his 60 year old
[1:07:41] daughter got healed
[1:07:42] of cancer and came in the message when
[1:07:43] she was out of the message i mean
[1:07:45] to me that's just a great example
[1:07:48] of just serve god faithfully week after
[1:07:51] week year after year decade after decade
[1:07:53] just like anna's testimony shows and god
[1:07:56] will
[1:07:57] bless you now for her she got to see god
[1:08:00] in the flesh
[1:08:01] so few people got to see god in the
[1:08:03] flesh she saw
[1:08:04] the word made flesh in church she'll be
[1:08:07] a witness
[1:08:08] praise god that god is a rewarder of
[1:08:11] them that diligently seek him hallelujah
[1:08:14] amen that's right praise god
[1:08:17] amen so what does diligence mean it
[1:08:21] means
[1:08:21] faithfulness decade after decade and if
[1:08:24] you
[1:08:25] diligently seek god he'll reward you
[1:08:27] with seeing god in flesh
[1:08:28] amen now to me i apply like this if
[1:08:31] we're diligent
[1:08:32] we'll see god in the flesh of our
[1:08:33] children right
[1:08:35] we'll see the word made flesh in our
[1:08:37] children or we'll see new souls saved or
[1:08:39] we'll see in other words we'll see
[1:08:41] people baptized with the holy ghost
[1:08:42] praise god
[1:08:43] amen and if and if god is really
[1:08:45] gracious to us
[1:08:46] then we'll meet jesus in the air he's
[1:08:48] the real one that was the word made
[1:08:50] flesh praise god
[1:08:51] we'll see him at the rapture just like
[1:08:53] she saw him at the first coming
[1:08:55] we'll see him at the second coming amen
[1:08:58] oh my that's beautiful
[1:09:01] god's rewarder of those that diligently
[1:09:03] seek him keep reading your bibles in the
[1:09:04] morning keep praying
[1:09:06] keep coming to church keep giving god
[1:09:08] everything that you have right
[1:09:09] give him everything you have he'll
[1:09:11] reward you as you diligently
[1:09:13] seek his face he's faithful
[1:09:17] and one example of a widow who don't
[1:09:19] have nothing she throws herself on the
[1:09:21] mercy of god the house of god
[1:09:22] and god lets her see the holy one of
[1:09:25] israel amen
[1:09:27] oh the the one that all they all wrote
[1:09:29] about for four thousand years they just
[1:09:31] wrote about him wrote about him wrote
[1:09:33] about it
[1:09:33] she got to see him face to face amen
[1:09:37] hallelujah faithful widow that just
[1:09:39] dedicated all of her life to praying
[1:09:42] and fasting for the people of god amen
[1:09:46] what a testimony
[1:09:51] i'll say like that i want my life to be
[1:09:52] like that too i want to have decades and
[1:09:54] decades
[1:09:55] of giving myself to the things of god
[1:09:57] praying and fasting right
[1:09:59] uh having a ministry serving god in uh
[1:10:02] faithfully at his house how many want
[1:10:04] that testimony
[1:10:06] oh my what a beautiful testimony that is
[1:10:13] mary magdalene i'll go to the next one
[1:10:15] here was healed from seven demons the
[1:10:17] bible said healed from seven demons
[1:10:20] healed from seven demons by christ
[1:10:23] then faithfully followed and supported
[1:10:25] his ministry
[1:10:28] and she was even present at the cross
[1:10:30] notice that while all the men
[1:10:32] all the big time preachers i'm not i'm
[1:10:34] not bashing them i would have done the
[1:10:36] same thing
[1:10:37] so i'm just trying to encourage our
[1:10:38] sisters well all the big-time preachers
[1:10:40] left that were sent out and had
[1:10:42] campaigns and miracles and
[1:10:44] they they these women just stayed there
[1:10:46] they just made sure jesus had food and
[1:10:48] they took care of him and clothes and a
[1:10:50] place to lay his head they made sure
[1:10:51] that
[1:10:52] you know could find a place to sleep at
[1:10:54] night just to take care of him
[1:10:57] she was one of those but she stayed with
[1:11:00] jesus
[1:11:00] and went to the cross right and saw
[1:11:03] jesus
[1:11:04] die what a powerful testimony
[1:11:08] jesus rewarded her faith
[1:11:11] remember she had the choice she could
[1:11:12] have went back to prostitution
[1:11:15] right bible said she had made a lot of
[1:11:17] money
[1:11:18] right she could have went back to that
[1:11:22] but she forsook all of it to support the
[1:11:25] ministry of jesus christ
[1:11:26] so jesus rewarded her by making her the
[1:11:29] first
[1:11:30] to see him after the resurrection my
[1:11:34] wedding something right there goodness
[1:11:37] gracious
[1:11:38] a prostitute who had seven demons is the
[1:11:41] first one
[1:11:41] to see the resurrected christ amen and
[1:11:44] what
[1:11:45] lesson it is for us that we were uh we
[1:11:48] were uh
[1:11:49] we were adulterers with the world the
[1:11:51] bible said we are adulterers and
[1:11:52] whoremongers and
[1:11:54] liars and stealers all these things
[1:11:56] right but god blesses us
[1:11:57] we get to see jesus one day praise god
[1:12:00] that's the great promise that we have
[1:12:02] in fact the dead in christ will see him
[1:12:04] first amen
[1:12:06] hallelujah and then we which are alive
[1:12:08] and remain shall be called together to
[1:12:10] meet the lord
[1:12:11] in the air amen so see we get the same
[1:12:15] the same idea we get to see the
[1:12:17] resurrected christ
[1:12:18] right if we're faithful with him if we
[1:12:20] if we follow his
[1:12:22] ways if we're we're dedicated to him and
[1:12:24] we don't run from him
[1:12:25] and we thank him and we live our lives
[1:12:28] in gratitude
[1:12:29] for his healing power praise god
[1:12:33] then he will let us see him uh
[1:12:36] face to face at the rapture praise god
[1:12:42] now church look at that
[1:12:46] we should be thankful right we can enjoy
[1:12:48] the same freedom from devils as mary
[1:12:50] magdalene
[1:12:52] right some of us you know thankfully the
[1:12:55] children hopefully
[1:12:56] haven't had demon possession right thank
[1:12:59] the lord for that praise god
[1:13:03] there was things things i did i'm sure
[1:13:05] there was at least one demon inside of
[1:13:06] me you know
[1:13:07] at least one but
[1:13:10] she you know after being healed by jesus
[1:13:15] she comes out of that right she comes
[1:13:17] out of that and she's like i know what
[1:13:19] it's like to be bound by seven of them
[1:13:22] and this man he's a great man
[1:13:25] he's he's the greatest man ever he drove
[1:13:27] these demons out of him i'll never go
[1:13:29] back to those things
[1:13:30] i'm gonna follow this man amen this man
[1:13:33] speaks with authority praise god
[1:13:35] he this man's got power and she
[1:13:38] dedicated her life to that
[1:13:40] she knew what it was like to be free and
[1:13:42] so she stuck with
[1:13:44] stuck with him throughout all the trials
[1:13:46] of life
[1:13:47] amen and that's what we must do
[1:13:50] we must be devoted to christ in
[1:13:53] gratitude for our freedom in the lord
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:58] hallelujah we once were chained up right
[1:14:00] and unbelieved for our sins
[1:14:02] but we've been set free and so we must
[1:14:04] thank god for our freedom that we have
[1:14:06] be devoted despite our trials and one
[1:14:09] seat one day we'll see the messiah
[1:14:11] at his second coming amen we'll see the
[1:14:13] resurrected christ
[1:14:16] where do we get all these great lessons
[1:14:17] from women
[1:14:20] because the church it's a mysterious but
[1:14:22] she's actually the bride of christ
[1:14:24] the highest calling in the bible
[1:14:28] brother graham said the highest calling
[1:14:29] is to sit on the very throne with christ
[1:14:34] how am i doing on time all right good
[1:14:35] got by six more minutes praise god
[1:14:39] looks like our close to this one the
[1:14:41] samaritan woman
[1:14:46] well we'll see we'll see how it goes
[1:14:47] here the samaritan woman meets
[1:14:50] jesus at jacob's well instantly
[1:14:53] recognizes jesus's prophetic gift when
[1:14:56] he reveals her secrets oh that's just
[1:14:58] like me
[1:14:59] the first time i saw brother ram's gift
[1:15:01] i knew that was a prophet amen
[1:15:03] i don't know i seen it on a video i seen
[1:15:05] him discerning the thoughts and tense of
[1:15:06] the heart
[1:15:07] i've never seen anything like that
[1:15:08] praise god
[1:15:11] and it caused her to boldly testify to
[1:15:14] her city
[1:15:15] making many more converts to christ
[1:15:18] believers experience the same
[1:15:20] discernment ability of the living word
[1:15:22] today right
[1:15:23] the holy spirit discerns the thoughts
[1:15:26] and intents of our heart
[1:15:29] and women in particular learn the power
[1:15:32] of testifying
[1:15:34] to others about jesus without preaching
[1:15:36] right
[1:15:38] so that's what our sisters can do our
[1:15:40] little sisters right uh our adult women
[1:15:43] they have all the author or power or
[1:15:45] authority to testify
[1:15:47] right women can testify come see with a
[1:15:50] man
[1:15:52] come see a man that told me all the
[1:15:53] things i ever did right
[1:15:55] here's a woman who shows the power of a
[1:15:57] testimony and this is what
[1:15:59] priscilla must have done with apollos
[1:16:01] right because the bible said priscilla
[1:16:03] and aquila
[1:16:04] talked to apollos and showed him a more
[1:16:07] excellent way the baptism of the holy
[1:16:09] ghost because all he knew was john the
[1:16:10] baptist
[1:16:11] so apollos must have been teaching the
[1:16:13] word and priscilla must have been
[1:16:15] testifying one of the holy spirit did
[1:16:16] this
[1:16:17] the holy spirit did that then the holy
[1:16:19] spirit did that and she was testifying
[1:16:21] and it was such a testimony
[1:16:23] that uh it it allowed apollos to enter
[1:16:26] into the holy ghost baptism
[1:16:28] amen and notice it was it was a team
[1:16:33] aquila and priscilla worked together to
[1:16:36] help apollos
[1:16:37] it wasn't just aquila it was priscilla
[1:16:42] right and that's what we asked to be our
[1:16:43] prayer for our sisters
[1:16:45] that their testimonies can be so
[1:16:47] powerful
[1:16:48] it will turn others to love jesus right
[1:16:52] without even preaching she'll have to
[1:16:53] say any well this means this in the
[1:16:56] bible she have to interpret anything
[1:16:57] she just has to say come see what jesus
[1:17:00] did for me
[1:17:01] praise god they can testify
[1:17:05] and it has powerful effects
[1:17:11] that's what we learn from her
[1:17:13] recognizing the prophetic gift right
[1:17:15] instantly we see that and we go make
[1:17:17] others known
[1:17:18] of what we've seen praise god amen
[1:17:22] mary the mary of bethany a sister of
[1:17:25] jesus's close friend lazarus
[1:17:28] she's a powerful example of hearing the
[1:17:29] word and acting upon it
[1:17:31] right despite her sister's objection
[1:17:34] mary chose to sit
[1:17:35] and listen to jesus rather than complete
[1:17:37] the housework
[1:17:38] and christ approved of mary's decision
[1:17:43] is there ever an end to housework
[1:17:44] sisters
[1:17:46] is there ever brothers well there's just
[1:17:48] two of us here that's right
[1:17:49] brothers is there ever end of your to-do
[1:17:51] list
[1:17:53] no i wish there was sometimes i really
[1:17:55] wish there was
[1:17:56] but you know she mary had work she could
[1:17:58] have done
[1:17:59] right martha said master i'm doing all
[1:18:02] this by myself
[1:18:05] but christ approved of mary's decision
[1:18:08] saying she chose the better thing and
[1:18:10] all that she heard would never be taken
[1:18:13] away from her
[1:18:15] so that's where we learned that the
[1:18:17] revelations we receive
[1:18:19] are eternal and the gates of hell cannot
[1:18:22] prevail against us
[1:18:23] but we've got to put revelation above
[1:18:26] all our worldly duties we've got to put
[1:18:29] uh
[1:18:29] sacrificing uh things we've got to
[1:18:32] report sacrificing the cares of the
[1:18:34] world amen
[1:18:35] we got to sacrifice the cares of the
[1:18:36] world and put the revelation of the word
[1:18:38] high above that
[1:18:41] that's the lesson we learn from her
[1:18:44] and it can never be taken from us praise
[1:18:47] god
[1:18:48] hallelujah yeah we go we could all go
[1:18:50] make another buck right i mean we
[1:18:52] tonight we could we could get a
[1:18:53] part-time job we could have gone made
[1:18:54] another dollar right
[1:18:56] could have worked a little harder you
[1:18:57] could go get a part-time job you could
[1:18:59] fill out a survey and win something you
[1:19:01] know you could
[1:19:02] you know earn some cash some kohl's cash
[1:19:05] actually i don't know where that came
[1:19:06] from goes cash but just
[1:19:08] you can earn cash right we could all do
[1:19:10] that but we choose to
[1:19:12] set aside the things of the world that
[1:19:14] we might gain the spiritual treasures
[1:19:16] amen
[1:19:17] that's right
[1:19:21] and i'll close with priscilla who i kind
[1:19:23] of mentioned earlier
[1:19:24] the wife of aquila she showed diligence
[1:19:27] in the faith
[1:19:27] by working alongside her husband to help
[1:19:30] paul
[1:19:31] she hosted church services in her house
[1:19:34] remember the bible said uh send
[1:19:36] greetings to aquila and priscilla
[1:19:38] and the church in their house remember
[1:19:40] that scripture
[1:19:42] that's first corinthians uh i'm sorry
[1:19:44] romans 16 3
[1:19:45] they had a house church
[1:19:49] and they also testified to apollos about
[1:19:52] god's further revelations the message of
[1:19:54] the hour
[1:19:56] so here we see the importance from
[1:19:57] priscilla we've got to stay in our
[1:19:59] position right she didn't become a
[1:20:01] preacher
[1:20:02] but her testimonies help the preachers
[1:20:06] hallelujah she wasn't a preacher but her
[1:20:09] testimony helped the preachers
[1:20:13] that's beautiful
[1:20:16] and of course opening your home to the
[1:20:18] gospel right
[1:20:20] and the power of testimonies we learn
[1:20:23] all this
[1:20:24] from priscilla all right a woman's home
[1:20:27] is her domain right that's her nest
[1:20:29] right
[1:20:30] but she was willing to be flexible open
[1:20:32] up that home
[1:20:34] in order that the word of god might be
[1:20:36] preached
[1:20:38] there's my hour where's yeah there's my
[1:20:40] hour let's stand to our feet praise god
[1:20:49] the bride of christ is the type of all
[1:20:51] things clean and beautiful
[1:20:55] holy she is a womb
[1:20:58] for the seed of the holy spirit and the
[1:21:01] all the receptor of all the blessings of
[1:21:03] god
[1:21:05] by she's the bride of christ
[1:21:10] she's so worthy that she's exalted to
[1:21:12] heaven sharing the very throne of god
[1:21:15] as the only place befitting such a queen
[1:21:18] musicians you can come how many like
[1:21:21] those queens they've heard about tonight
[1:21:24] priscilla mary sister of lazarus
[1:21:28] the samaritan woman at the well mary
[1:21:30] magdalene
[1:21:31] anna mary mother of jesus bathsheba and
[1:21:34] abigail
[1:21:36] all these lessons we learned
[1:21:42] now you little sisters you got a lot of
[1:21:43] great role models in the bible now
[1:21:46] there's and plus the ones in your home

[1:22:06] to you and you can
[1:22:08] pull such power and such uh uh such
[1:22:11] encouragement from them
[1:22:12] like when i first started pastoring
[1:22:13] hezekiah was my favorite guy
[1:22:16] he was 25 when he took the kingship i
[1:22:18] was 25 when i took the pastor here you
[1:22:19] know
[1:22:20] i just i gained so much strength from
[1:22:22] that at that moment in my life
[1:22:24] you know last year paul became really
[1:22:26] important to me because he was
[1:22:28] set for a defense of the gospel i felt
[1:22:30] like i was defending this message last
[1:22:32] year
[1:22:36] and so i you know as we go through life
[1:22:38] you know david you know
[1:22:39] before that it was david a man after
[1:22:41] god's own heart he served god
[1:22:43] for his generation i want to be i want
